    "challenges posed by the constantly growing urbanisation are complex and difficult to handle .",
    "they range from the increasing dependence on energy , to serious environmental and sustainability issues , and socio - spatial inequalities @xcite .",
    "in particular , we observe the appearance of socially homogeneous zones and dynamical phenomena such as urban decay @xcite and gentrification @xcite that reinforce the heterogeneity of the spatial distribution of social classes in cities . such a segregation  characterized by an important social differentiation of the urban space  has significant social , economic @xcite and even health costs",
    "@xcite which justify the attention it has attracted in academic studies over the past century . despite the abundant literature in sociology and economics , however , there is no consensus on the adequate way to quantify and describe patterns of segregation . in particular",
    ", the identification of neighbourhoods where the different groups gather is still in its infancy .    as stated many times , and at different periods in the sociology literature  @xcite",
    ", the study of segregation is cursed by its intuitive appeal . the perceived familiarity with the concept favours what duncan and duncan  @xcite called ` naive operationalism ' : the tendency to force a sociological interpretation on measures that are at odds with the conceptual understanding of segregation . as a matter of fact , segregation is a complex notion , and the literature distinguishes several conceptually different dimensions .",
    "massey  @xcite first proposed a list of @xmath0 dimensions ( and related existing measures ) , which was recently reduced to @xmath1 by reardon  @xcite .",
    "( i ) _ exposure _ which measures the extent to which different populations share the same residential areas ; ( ii ) the _ evenness _ ( and _ clustering _ ) to which extent populations are evenly spread in the metropolitan area ; ( iii ) _ concentration _ to which extent populations concentrate in the areal units they occupy ; and ( iv ) _ centralization _ to which extent populations concentrate in the center of the city .",
    "we identify several problems with this picture .",
    "the first  fundamental",
    " issue lies in the lack of a general conceptual framework in which all existing measures can be interpreted .",
    "instead , we have a patchwork of seemingly unrelated measures that are labelled with either of the aforementioned dimensions .",
    "although segregation can indeed manifest itself in different ways , it is relatively straightforward to define what is _ not _ segregation : a spatial distribution of different categories that is undistinguishable from a uniform random situation ( with the same percentages of different categories ) .",
    "therefore , we can define segregation as _ any pattern in the spatial distribution of categories that deviates significantly from a random distribution _",
    "the different dimensions of  @xcite then correspond to particular aspects of how a multi - dimensional pattern can deviate from its randomized counterpart .",
    "the measures we propose here are all rooted in this general definition of segregation .",
    "the other issues are technical in nature .",
    "first , several difficulties are tied to the existence of many categories in the underlying data .",
    "historically , measurements of racial segregation were limited to measures between @xmath2 population groups . however , most measures generalise poorly to a situation with many groups , and the others do not necessarily have a clear interpretation  @xcite .",
    "worse , in the case of groups based on a continuum ( such as income ) , the thresholds chosen to define classes are usually arbitrary  @xcite .",
    "we propose in the following to solve this issue by defining classes in a unambiguous and non - arbitrary way through their pattern of spatial interaction .",
    "applied to the distribution of income categories in us cities , we find @xmath3 emergent categories , which are naturally interpreted as the lower- , middle- and higher - income classes .",
    "second , most authors systematically design a single index of segregation for territories that can be very large , up to thousands of square kilometers  @xcite . in order to mitigate segregation , a more local ,",
    "spatial information is however needed : local authorities need to locate where the poorest and richest concentrate if they want to design efficient policies to curb , or compensate for the existing segregation . in other words ,",
    "we need to provide a clear _ spatial _ information on the pattern of segregation .",
    "previous studies  @xcite were interested in the characterisation of intra - urban segregation patterns , but they suffer from the limitations of the indicators they use .",
    "in particular , the values they map come with no indication as to when a high value of the index indicates high segregation levels . as a result ,",
    "the maps are not necessarily easy to read .",
    "furthermore , all the descriptions are cartographic in nature and while maps are a powerful way to highlight patterns , we would like to provide further , quantitative , information about the spatial distribution that goes beyond cartographic representation .",
    "the lack of a clear characterization of the spatial distribution of individuals is not tied to the problem of segregation in particular , but pertains to the field of spatial statistics  @xcite .",
    "many studies avoided this spatial problem by assuming implicitely that cities are monocentric and circular , and rely on either an arbitrary definition of the city center boundaries , or on indices computed as a function of the distance to the center ( whatever this may be ) .",
    "however , most if not all cities are anisotropic , and the large ones , polycentric ( see  @xcite and references therein ) . many empirical studies and models in economics",
    "aim to explain the difference between central cities and suburbs @xcite . yet",
    ", the sole stylized fact upon which they rely  city centers tend to be poorer than suburbs ( in the us )  lacks a solid empirical basis .",
    "in the first part of the paper , we define a null model  the unsegregated city  and define the representation , a measure that identifies significant local departures from this null case .",
    "we further introduce a measure of exposure that allows us to quantify the extent to which the different categories attract or repel one another .",
    "this exposure is the starting point for the non - parametric identification of the different social classes . in the second part",
    ", we define neighbourhoods by clustering adjacent areal units where classes are overrepresented and show that there an increased spatial isolation of classes as population size of cities grows .",
    "we also show that larger cities are richer in the sense that the wealthiest households tend to be overrepresented and the low - income underrepresented in large cities .",
    "finally , we discuss how density is connected to the spatial distribution of income , and how to go beyond the traditional picture of a poor center and rich suburbs .",
    "we focus here on the income distribution , using the data for the 2014 core - based statistical areas",
    ". however , the methods presented in this paper are very general , and can be applied  @xcite to different geographical levels , to an arbitrary number of population categories , and to different variables such as ethnicity , education level , etc .",
    "most studies exploring the question of spatial segregation define measures before comparing their value for different cities .",
    "knowing that two quantities are different is however not enough : we also have to know whether this difference is significant . in order to assess the significance of a result , we have to compare it to what is obtained for a reasonable null model .",
    "we assume that we have @xmath4 areal units dividing the city and that individuals can belong to different categories .",
    "the elementary quantity is @xmath5 which represents the number of individuals of category @xmath6 in the unit @xmath7 .",
    "the total number of individuals belonging to a category @xmath6 is @xmath8 and the total number of individuals in the city is given by @xmath9 .    in the context of residential segregation",
    ", a natural null model is the _ unsegregated city _",
    ", where all households are distributed at random in the city with the constraints that    * the total number @xmath10 of households living in the areal unit @xmath7 is fixed ( from data ) .",
    "* the numbers @xmath8 are given by the data ;    the problem of finding the numbers @xmath11 in this unsegregated city is reminiscent of the traditional occupancy problem in combinatorics  @xcite .",
    "if we assume that for all categories @xmath6 , we have @xmath12 , they are then distributed according to the multinomial denoted by @xmath13 , and the number of people of category @xmath6 in the areal unit @xmath7 is distributed according to a binomial distribution .",
    "therefore , in an unsegregated city , we have @xmath14 & = n_\\alpha\\,\\frac{n(t)}{n } \\\\      { \\mathrm{var}}\\left [ n_\\alpha(t ) \\right ] & = n_\\alpha\\,\\frac{n(t)}{n } \\left ( 1 - \\frac{n(t)}{n }   \\right ) \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "the fundamental quantity we will use in the following is the _ representation _ of a category @xmath6 in the areal unit @xmath7 , defined as @xmath15 the representation thus compares the relative population @xmath6 in the areal unit @xmath7 to the value that is expected in an unsegregated city where individuals choose their location at random . or , equivalently , the representation compares the proportion of individuals @xmath6 in the unit @xmath7 to their proportion in the city as a whole .    in metropolitan areas",
    ", @xmath8 is large compared to @xmath16 , and the distribution of the @xmath5 can be approximated by a gaussian with the same mean and variance .",
    "therefore we have in the unsegregated case    @xmath17 & = 1 \\\\          { \\mathrm{var}}\\left [ r_\\alpha(t ) \\right ] & = \\sigma_\\alpha(t)^2 = \\frac{1}{n_\\alpha } \\left (      \\frac{n}{n(t ) } - 1   \\right )       \\end{split}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    an important merit of the representation is the possibility to define rigorously the notion of _ over-_representation and _ under-_representation of a category @xmath6 in a geographical area . a category @xmath6 is overrepresented ( with a @xmath18 confidence ) in the geographical area @xmath7 if @xmath19 .",
    "a category @xmath6 is underrepresented ( with a @xmath18 confidence ) in the geographical area @xmath7 if @xmath20 .",
    "if the value @xmath21 falls in between the two previous limits , the representation of the category @xmath6 is not statistically different ( at this confidence level ) from what would be obtained if individuals were distributed at random .",
    "existing measures output levels of segregation ( typically a number between 0 and 1 ) but do not indicate whether these levels are _ abnormally _ high . to this respect , the representation is a significant improvement over previous measures .    note that the above null model is reminiscent of the ` counterfactuals ' used in the empirical literature on agglomeration economies  @xcite .",
    "also , the expression of the representation ( eq . [ eq : repre ] ) is very similar to the formula used in economics to compute comparative advantages  @xcite , or to the localisation quotient used in various contexts  @xcite . to our knowledge , however , this formula has never been justified by a null model in the context of residential location .",
    "the representation allows to assess the significance of the deviation of population distributions from the unsegregated city . as we will show below , it is also the building block for measuring the level of repulsion or attraction between categories allowing us to uncover the different classes and to identify the neighbourhoods where the different categories concentrate .",
    "last , but not least , the representation defined here does not depend on the category structure at the city scale , but only on the spatial repartition of individuals belonging to each category .",
    "this is essential in order to be able to compare different cities where the group compositions  or inequality  might differ .",
    "inequality and segregation are indeed two separate concepts , and the way they are measured should be distinct from one another .    finally , we would like to mention that using the uniform distribution as a null model can have implications broader than the study of residential segregation . indeed , from a very abstract perspective , the study of residential segregation is the study of labelled objects in space .",
    "the methods presented here can therefore be applied to the study of the distribution of any object in space . in particular , it can be used to identify the locations in a territory where populations with different characteristics ( not necessarily socio - economic ) concentrate .",
    "another shortcoming of the literature about segregation is the lack of indicator to quantify to what extent different populations attract or repel one another .",
    "such a measure of attraction or repulsion is however important to understand the dynamics and scale ( intensity of attraction / repulsion ) of residential segregation .",
    "our indicator is inspired by the m - value first introduced by marcon and puech in the economics literature to measure the concentration of industries  @xcite and used as a measure of interaction between retail store categories in  @xcite .",
    "these authors were interested in measuring the geographic concentration of different type of industries .",
    "while previous measures ( such as ripley s k - value ) allow to identify departures from a random ( poisson ) distribution , the m - value s interest resides in the possibility to evaluate different industries tendency to co - locate .",
    "the idea , in the context of segregation is simple : we consider two categories @xmath6 and @xmath22 and we would like to measure to which extent they are co - located in the same areal unit . to quantify the tendency of households to co - locate , we measure the representation of the category @xmath22 as witnessed on average by individuals in category @xmath6 , and obtain the following quantity @xmath23 @xmath24 although it is not obvious with this formulation , this measure is symmetric : @xmath25 ( see supplementary information below .",
    "effectively , this ` e - value ' in this context is a measure of exposure , according to the typology of segregation measures proposed in  @xcite . however , unlike the other measures of exposure found in the literature  @xcite , we are able to distinguish between situations where categories attract ( @xmath26 ) or repel ( @xmath27 ) one another . in the case of an unsegregated city , every household in @xmath6 sees on average @xmath28 and we have @xmath29 .",
    "if populations @xmath6 and @xmath22 attract each other , that is if they tend to be overrepresented in the same areal units , every household @xmath6 sees @xmath30 and we have @xmath31 at the city scale . on the other hand ,",
    "if they repel each other , every household @xmath6 sees @xmath32 and we have @xmath33 at the city scale .",
    "the minimum of the exposure for two classes @xmath6 and @xmath22 is obtained when these two categories are never present together in the same areal unit and then @xmath34 the maximum is obtained when the two classes are alone in the system ( see supplementary information below for more details ) and in this case we get @xmath35 in the case @xmath36 , the previous measure represents the ` isolation ' defined as @xmath37 and measures to which extent individuals from the same category interact which each other . in the unsegregated city , where individuals are indifferent to others when chosing their residence , we have @xmath38 . in contrast , in the extreme situation where individuals belonging to the class @xmath6 live isolated from the others , the isolation reaches its maximum value @xmath39 of course , in order to discuss the significance of the values of exposure and isolation , one needs to compute the variance of the exposure in the unsegregated situation defined earlier .",
    "the calculations for the variance as well as for the extrema are presented in the supplementary information below .",
    "finally , we note that co - location is not necessarily synonymous with interaction , as pointed out by chamboredon  @xcite , and we should rigorously talk about _ potential _ interactions .",
    "nevertheless , in the absence of large scale data about direct interactions between individuals , co - location is the best proxy available .",
    "studies that focus on the definition of a single segregation index for cities as a whole can avoid the problem of defining classes , either by measuring the between - neighbourhood variation of the average income ( examples are the standard deviation of incomes  @xcite , the variance of logged incomes  @xcite and jargowsky s neighbourhood sorting index  @xcite ) , or by integrating over the entire income distribution ( for instance the rank - order information theory index defined in  @xcite ) .",
    "however , when they investigate the behaviour of households with different income and their spatial distribution , studies of segregation must be rooted in a particular definition of categories ( or classes ) .",
    "unfortunately , there is no consensus in the literature about how to separate households in different classes according to their income , and studies generally rely on more or less arbitrary divisions  @xcite .",
    "while in some particular cases grouping the original categories in pre - defined classes is justified , most authors do so for mere convenience reasons . however , as some sociologists have already pointed out  @xcite , imposing the existence of absolute , artificial entities is necessarily going to bias our reading of the data .",
    "furthermore , in the absence of recognized standards , different authors will likely have different definitions of classes , making the comparisons between different results in the literature difficult .    from a theoretical point of view",
    ", entities such as social classes do not have an existence of their own .",
    "grouping the individuals into arbitrary classes when studying segregation is thus a logical fallacy : it amounts to imposing a class structure on the society before assessing the existence of this structure ( which manifests itself by the differentiated spatial repartition of individuals with different income ) . here ,",
    "instead of imposing an arbitrary class structure , we let the class structure emerge from the data themselves .",
    "our starting hypothesis is the following : _ if there is such a thing as a social stratification based on income , it should be reflected in the households behaviours _ :",
    "households belonging to the same class should tend to live together , while households belonging to different classes should tend to avoid one another .",
    "in other words , we aim to define classes using the way they manifest themselves through the spatial repartition of the different categories .",
    "we choose as a starting point the finest income subdivision given by the us census bureau ( @xmath40 subdivisions ) and compute the @xmath41 matrix of @xmath42 values for all cities .",
    "we then perform a hierarchical clustering on this matrix , succesively aggregating the subdivisions with the highest @xmath42 values .",
    "the process , that we implemented in the python library marble  @xcite , goes as follows :    1 .",
    "check whether there exists a pair @xmath6 , @xmath22 such that @xmath43 ( i.e. two categories that attract one another with at least 99% confidence according to the chebyshev inequality ) .",
    "if not , stop the agregation and return the classes ; 2 .",
    "if there is at least one couple satisfying ( 1 ) , normalize all @xmath44 values by their respective maximum values .",
    "find then the pair @xmath45 , @xmath22 whose normalized exposure is the maximum ; 3 .   aggregate the two categories @xmath22 and @xmath45 ; 4 .   repeat the process until it stops .    in order to aggregate the categories at step 3 ,",
    "we need to compute the exposure between @xmath46 and any category @xmath6 , as well as its variance .",
    "the corresponding calculations are presented in the supplementary information ( below ) .",
    "we stress that the obtained classification does not rely on any arbitrary threshold .",
    "indeed , we stop the aggregation process when the only classes left are indifferent ( @xmath29 with @xmath18 confidence ) or repel each other ( @xmath47 with @xmath18 confidence ) .      strikingly , the outcome of this method on us data is the emergence of 3 distinct classes ( fig .",
    "[ fig : classes_alluvial ] ) : the higher - income ( @xmath48 of the us population ) and the lower - income classes ( @xmath49 of the us population )  which repel each other strongly while being respectively very coherent  and a somewhat small middle - income class ( @xmath50 of the population ) that is relatively indifferent to the other classes .",
    "this result implies that there is some truth in the conventional way of dividing populations into @xmath3 income classes , and that what we casually perceive as the social stratification in our cities actually emerges from the spatial interaction of people .",
    "our method has several advantages over a casual definition : it is not arbitrary in the sense that it does not depend on a tunable parameter ( besides the significance threshold ) and on who performs the analysis .",
    "its origins are tractable , and can be argued on a quantitative basis .",
    "because it is quantitative , it allows comparison of the stratification over different points in time , or between different countries .",
    "it can also be compared to other class divisions that would be obtained using a different medium for interaction , for instance mobile phone communications  @xcite .    in the following",
    ", we will systematically use the classes obtained with this method .          at the scale of an entire country",
    ", segregation can manifest itself in the unequal representation of the different income classes across the urban areas .",
    "we plot on fig .",
    "[ fig : inter - urban_representation ] the ratio @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the number of cities of population greater than @xmath53 , and @xmath54 the number of cities of population greater than @xmath53 for which the class @xmath6 is overrepresented .",
    "a decreasing curve indicates that the class @xmath6 tends to be underrepresented in larger urban areas , while an increasing curve shows that the category @xmath6 tends to be overrepresented in larger urban areas ( the representation is here measured with respect to the total population at the us level ) .",
    "these results challenge sassen s thesis on social polarization , according to which world ( very large ) cities host proportionally more higher - income and lower - income individuals than smaller cities  @xcite .",
    "if this thesis were correct , we should observe an overrepresentation of both higher - income and lower - income households in larger cities . instead , as shown on fig .",
    "[ fig : inter - urban_representation ] , higher - income households are overrepresented in larger cities , while lower - income households tend to be underrepresented ( see supplementary information for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "these results support the previous critique of the social polarisation thesis by hamnett  @xcite .    , scaledwidth=49.0% ]",
    "the representation measure introduced at the beginning of this article allows to draw maps of overrepresentation and thus to identify the areas of the city where categories are overrepresented . in the following ,",
    "we propose to characterise the spatial arrangement of these areas for the different categories .        in many studies ,",
    "the question of the spatial pattern of segregation is limited to the study of the center versus suburbs and is usually adressed in two different ways .",
    "in the first case , a central area is defined by arbitrary boundaries and measures are performed at the scale of this central area and the rest is labelled as ` suburbs ' .",
    "the issue with this approach is that the conclusions depend on the chosen boundaries and there is no unique unambiguous definition of the city center : while some consider the central business district  @xcite , others choose the urban core ( urbanized area ) where the population density is higher .",
    "the second approach , in an attempt to get rid of arbitrary boundaries , consists in plotting indicators of wealth as a function of distance to the center  @xcite .",
    "this approach , inspired by the monocentric and isotropic city of many economic studies such as the von thunen or the alonso - muth - mills model  @xcite , has however a serious flaw : cities are not isotropic and are spread unevenly in space , leading to very irregular shapes  @xcite . representing any quantity versus the distance to a center",
    "thus amounts to average over very different areas and in polycentric cases ( as it is the case for large cities @xcite ) is necessarily misleading .",
    "as we show below , this method mixes together areas that are otherwise very different .",
    "we propose here a different approach that does not require to draw boundaries between the center and the suburbs .",
    "in fact , it does not even require to define and locate the ` center ' at all .",
    "in the case of a monocentric and isotropic city , our method gives results similar to those given by the other measures . in the more general case where cities are not necessarily monocentric neither isotropic",
    ", our method allows to compare regions of equivalent densities .",
    "the center of a city is usually defined as the region which has the highest population ( or employment ) density .",
    "we therefore propose the density as a proxy to measure of how ` central ' an area is .",
    "we thus plot quantities computed over all areal units ( blockgroups in this dataset ) that have a density population in a given interval @xmath55 $ ] where @xmath56 decreases from its maximum to its minimum value .",
    "we illustrate this idea and compare its results to the traditional ` distance to the center ' method on fig .",
    "[ fig : illustrate_percolate ] . with very anisotropic and polycentric cities such as los angeles ,",
    "the order in which the areal units are considered is very different with both methods . as a result ,",
    "measurements as simple as the average income will yield very different results .",
    "this is particularly striking with the example of seattle , wa shown on fig .",
    "[ fig : illustrate_percolate ] . the average income as a function of the distance to the center ( areal unit with the highest density ) increases from the center to a peak at roughly @xmath57 km ( bottom left figure ) . on the other hand , the bottom left figure shows that average income is , in fact , a simple decreasing function of residential density .",
    "where does the discrepancy come from ?",
    "as one can see on the maps on the top of fig  [ fig : illustrate_percolate ] , the units considered in a given distance range can be very different in terms of density . because real cities are neither monocentric or isotropic , units at a same distance from the center can in fact be very different .",
    "this shows , if anything , the importance of expliciting what one means by ` central ' before presenting measures . in the following ,",
    "we express centrality in terms of residential density .          here , we compute the representation of groups as a function of residential density .",
    "this method sheds a new light on the difference of social composition between the high - density and low - density areas in cities .",
    "indeed , as shown on fig .",
    "[ fig : high_low_densities ] , we find that low - density regions in cities are on average rich neighbourhoods and that higher density regions are on average lower - income neighbourhoods , in agreement with the dichotomy rich suburbs / poor centers usually found in the literature .",
    "but the dichotomy is not the full picture .",
    "the method indeed entails a surprising result : areas with very large densities ( typically above @xmath58 inhabitant@xmath59 ) are on average rich neighbourhoods .",
    "only few cities in the us have neighbourhoods that reach the threshold of @xmath60 inhabitants per km@xmath61 , which can explain why people have reported in most cases the existence of poor centers and rich suburbs .",
    "in fact , among all @xmath62 blockgroups with a population density greater than @xmath60 inhabitants , @xmath63 are located in new york , ny . most high - density blockgroups belonging to other metropolitan areas exhibit an overrepresentation of the higher - income group and it is thus difficult to conclude at this stage that we are observing an effect specific to manhattan . in any case",
    ", this result suggests that density is very relevant in the usual discussion about income strucutre differences between north american and european cities .     of the higher- , middle- and lower - income classes over the @xmath64 cbsa as a function of the local density of households . on average",
    ", we find that low - density regions ( the suburbs ) are on the richer end , while high density regions ( the center ) are on the poorer end .",
    "this confirms on a large dataset a stylized fact that had previously emerged from local studies .",
    "interestingly , we also find that high income households are on average overrepresented in very large density areas ( @xmath65 ) , suggesting that density may be one relevant factor in the explanation of the differences between neighbourhoods .",
    "[ fig : high_low_densities],scaledwidth=49.0% ]      intra - unit measures such as the representation or the exposure are not enough to quantify segregation . indeed , areal units where a given class is overrepresented can arrange themselves in different ways , without affecting intra - unit measures of segregation  @xcite .",
    "in order to illustrate this , we consider the schematic cases represented on fig .",
    "[ fig : checkerboard ] , and assume that they are obtained by reshuffling the various squares around .",
    "obviously , the checkerboard on the left depicts a very different segregation situation from the divided situation on the right while intra - unit measures would give identical results .",
    "of @xmath66 for the black squares .",
    "( middle ) an intermediate situation between the checkerboard and the divided city , corresponding to @xmath67 .",
    "( right ) the divided city , corresponding to @xmath68 .",
    "[ fig : checkerboard],scaledwidth=49.0% ]      defining neighbourhoods in which categories tend to gather is a difficult task .",
    "indeed , what individuals call neighbourhoods often depend on their perception of the city , and field work is often necessary to identify which areas are socially recognised as being a large , middle or low income neighbourhood . however , it is often not possible to do field work and finding a way to define neighbourhoods from population counts is by more convenient and reliable .    what is usually defined as a neighbourhood defies the most naive measures .",
    "for instance , to be a member of an ` @xmath6 neighbourhood ' ( where @xmath6 is here higher , middle or low income class ) it is not necessary for an area to have a majority of individuals from the class @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "more sophisticated methods are thus required and the literature is not exempt of such measures , that are all rooted in different assumptions about the nature of neighbourhoods  @xcite .",
    "for instance , logan et al .",
    "@xcite use local k - functions in order to assess the prevalence of individuals from a class in an area .",
    "the areas are then clustered using a standard k - means clustering algorithm .",
    "the main issue with this approach is the use of k - functions which measure absolute concentration and are based on the null hypothesis of a completely random distribution of individuals across space . as mentioned earlier in this manuscript , it is more accurate to consider deviations from the null hypothesis of a random distribution of individuals _ among existing locations_. we thus propose here an improvement over logan et al.s definition based on data given at the areal unit level ( but could easily be generalised to data with exact locations ) . as in  @xcite , we start with the intuitive idea that an @xmath6 neighbourhood is an area of the city where the category @xmath6 is more present than in the rest of the city . in other words ,",
    "an areal unit @xmath7 belongs to an @xmath6 neighbourhood if and only if the category @xmath6 is overrepresented in @xmath7 , i.e. @xmath69 .",
    "we then build neighbourhoods by aggregating the adjacent areal units where the income class @xmath6 is also overrepresented ( see for example of atlanta fig .",
    "[ fig : atlanta_neighbourhoods ] ) .",
    "a way to distinguish between different spatial arrangements is to measure how clustered the overrepresented areal units are .",
    "the ratio of the number @xmath70 of @xmath6-neighbourhoods ( clusters ) to the total number @xmath71 of areal units when the class @xmath6 is overrepresented ( before constructing the neighbourhood as defined above ) gives a measure of the level of clustering and the quantity @xmath72 is such that @xmath73 in a checkerboard - like situation , and @xmath74 when all areal units form a unique neighbourhood .",
    "we show on fig .",
    "[ fig : clustering ] the distribution of @xmath75 for the three classes over all cities in our dataset .",
    "as one could infer from the maps on fig .",
    "[ fig : atlanta_neighbourhoods ] , the higher - income and lower - income areal units are well clustered , with a respective average clustering of @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "the middle class is on the other hand less spatially coherent , with a average clustering @xmath78 .         of the value of the clustering coefficient @xmath79 per class for all cities in our dataset .",
