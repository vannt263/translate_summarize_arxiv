    "large bodies in the periphery of planetary systems have the potential to wreak havoc on the orbits of inner planets through secular interactions",
    ". @xcite posit this effect to be responsible for the migration of hot jupiters ; @xcite describe how planet - planet scattering can result in moderately eccentric planetary orbits ; and @xcite demonstrate how kozai - type interactions @xcite can result in highly eccentric planet orbits , inward of a large planet or brown dwarf",
    ".    given that conventional planet formation models , including both core accretion @xcite and gravitational instability @xcite , describe planets forming in mostly circular , well - aligned circumstellar disks , it is important to explain why the mean eccentricity of discovered exoplanets is currently 0.19 , with many of the highest eccentricities found in single - planet systems ( 78% with @xmath4 are single planets ) .",
    "if secular effects involving a massive companion are responsible , these companions may be observable , if they have not yet been ejected from the system .",
    "@xcite conclude that most planet scattering instabilities should occur on timescales comparable to the planet formation timespan , but do acknowledge that triple planet systems in certain configurations could potentially be quasi - stable on timespans from @xmath5 to @xmath6 years , so it is not impossible to have planet ejection occur in an old system .",
    "@xcite found brown dwarf companions @xmath7  au from the primary , and @xcite found hd  3651b , a brown dwarf orbiting 476  au from a star with an eccentric planet .",
    "however , the same formation models mentioned above do not explain how such a massive companion could form so far from the parent star : that far - separated substellar companions and highly eccentric planets both exist deserves explanation .",
    "one such explanation is that all objects form close to their parent stars and end up in their current configurations through scattering events ( @xcite , @xcite ) .    whether causing havoc or not , widely separated companion brown dwarfs are interesting in their own right , as relatively few are known : of the 992substellar - mass companion objects discovered , only 36 ( all with mass @xmath8 ) are farther than 10  au from their parent , and 21 of those lie between 10 - 300  au . in part , this is a selection effect :",
    "the timescales necessary to find these objects with either radial velocity ( rv ) or transit methods are prohibitive , and all of the aforementioned brown dwarfs have been detected by direct imaging .",
    "ground - based direct imaging searches have been successful in finding gas giant companions ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) , but have lower sensitivity to the coolest t- and y - dwarfs ( which have distinctive [ 3.6]@xmath2[4.5 ] colors ) because of telluric absorption in the thermal infrared .",
    "space telescopes get around this problem , and wise has been successful in finding many field t- and y - dwarfs @xcite , but is less sensitive to brown dwarfs around stars because of the high contrast ratios involved",
    ". studies like @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite have searched for stellar - mass companions to planet - host stars , but are generally not sensitive to brown - dwarf - mass objects .",
    "the inner working angle of any direct - imaging companion search is limited by the brightness of the parent star compared to its companion . at optical wavelengths ,",
    "this is determined by the contrast ratio between the parent star s emission and the companion s reflected light .",
    "this can be problematic at close angular distances or if the starlight saturates the detector .",
    "however , the contrast ratio in the infrared ( e.g. at 3.6  @xmath1 m ) , where thermal emission dominates over reflected light , is much more manageable .",
    "this lower ratio opens up the possibility of searching for planetary mass companions with advanced point spread function ( psf ) subtraction techniques , provided that the psf is both stable and well spatially sampled .",
    "for these reasons , we have used the infrared array camera ( irac , @xcite ) onboard the spitzer space telescope @xcite to search for companions around 14 nearby stars .",
    "using irac gives the added advantage of being able to characterize t - dwarfs , in particular , using their characteristically red [ 3.6]-[4.5 ] color due to methane absorption bands @xcite .",
    "this work builds on our previous irac low - mass companion searches ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , which have resulted in the discovery of two brown dwarf companions @xcite , including a t7.5 companion of the exoplanet host star hd  3651 . in @xcite , in particular , we have developed the same technique used in the work presented here , adopting irac shorter frame - time subarray observing mode .",
    "this allows us to reduce the primary star saturation and the area with high psf - subtraction residuals , narrowing our inner working angle from 20@xmath0 to 5@xmath0 . building on this previous work , we used irac s subarray mode to probe for @xmath9 companions at separations of 25 to 350  au ( for a star 15  pc distant ) around a sample of 14 nearby planet host stars .",
    "herein , we present our target list in section  [ targetselection ] , our analysis methods ( section  [ dataanalysis ] ) , sensitivity limits ( section  [ sensitivitysection ] ) , and companion candidates selected on the basis of their irac colors ( section  [ detectedsources ] ) . in section  [ discussion ] we discuss our results .",
    "because so few brown dwarf companions to exoplanetary systems are known , it would be equally interesting to find a perturbing brown dwarf companion as to find one around an exoplanet system that does not exhibit abnormal eccentricity , or likewise one that is bound to a system known to already have another brown dwarf companion . therefore , we selected 14 target stars to observe ( table  [ targetstardata ] ) with only the criteria that they be located within @xmath1015  pc from the sun and have exoplanets detected by radial velocity .",
    "this 15  pc distance restriction was chosen to provide the best inner working angle , equivalent to a few tens of au from the target star , and an outer working angle of a few hundreds of au ( due to the subarray field of view ) : a range in which perturbing companions acting through the kozai mechanism are expected .",
    "target stars range in age from 0.1 to @xmath11  gyr , estimated from various factors including rotational periods , magnetic activity , galactic velocity , and emission lines ( for more information , see individual notes at the bottom of table  [ targetstardata ] ) .",

    "nine of the targets have at least one planet with @xmath45 , which may be an indication of the presence of a perturbing companion .",
    "gj  876 has two high - eccentricity planets inward of a 2.3  m@xmath3 planet , which may be an example of the type of secular interactions we are exploring @xcite .",

    "this system may be an example of the type of secular interactions we seek , although @xcite refit the rv data of hd  3651 and claim that instead of one high - eccentricity planet , there are likely two lower - eccentricity ( e=0.06@xmath170.20 and e=0.04@xmath170.20 ) planets in a 2:1 period commensurability .    similarly , @xmath46  and  c and d have high eccentricities ( e=0.24 , e=0.274 , @xcite ) , which @xcite explains as due to a 3:1 resonance between @xmath46  and  d and e. @xmath46  and  e has a mostly circular orbit , so an external perturber may not be necessary to explain the dynamics of this system .",
    "finally , gj  436 has one planet with moderate eccentricity ( e=0.15 , @xcite ) .",
    "this eccentricity was revalidated by @xcite and attributed by @xcite to an unseen 22.5m@xmath47 object 0.0285  au from the star .",
    "if that object exists , we would not be able to resolve it .",
    "ten of our targets were previously observed with irac @xcite to search for brown dwarf companions at large separation ( projected separation of @xmath10100 to @xmath101500 au ) .",
    "as these observations had frame times of 30  sec , they heavily saturated the primary star , limiting our inner working angle to 20@xmath0 from the target ( see @xcite ) .",
    "for this reason we chose to observe our target stars in subarray mode , allowing for dramatically shorter exposure times and restricting saturation to the innermost one or two pixels of the brightest sources .",
    "our observations were executed between sept 2007 and aug 2008 ( pid  40976 ) , and were modeled on our previous observations of @xmath48  eridani and fomalhaut ( pid 30754 , @xcite ) , adapted to the lower brightness of the selected targets .",
    "we selected frame times for k , g , and f stars were 0.1  seconds ( 0.08  sec integration time ) , and 0.4  sec ( 0.32  sec integration time ) for m stars .",
    "each subarray image is 32@xmath4932 pixels , 1.22@xmath0/pix , and is composed of 64 exposures repeated for each dither position .",
    "we used the standard irac nine - point reuleaux dither pattern to obtain non - redundant spatial sampling to build up a total integration time of 921.6  sec per target , with 5 or 20 images ( 320 or 1280 exposures ) per pointing for the 0.4 and 0.1  sec exposures , respectively .",
    "the large number of exposures was required to increase the signal - to - noise ratio of potential companions .",
    "the total overlap area of the exposures is @xmath50 .",
    "only 3.6  @xmath1 m and 4.5  @xmath1 m observations were needed because t- and y - dwarfs have characteristically red [ 3.6]@xmath2[4.5 ] colors , due to the presence of methane absorption bands near 3.3  @xmath1 m @xcite . the total integration time was set to allow the detection of 5  gyr old , 5  m@xmath3 planetary mass bodies at 10 pc from the sun , based on the predicted photon noise from the psf of the primary star @xcite .",
    "this was our goal , but we had to compromise for an integration time that resulted in lower sensitivity .",
    "once the psf was subtracted , however , the detection limit in the innermost 5@xmath0 was not photon noise , but rather the residual noise from subtracting the psf ( see figure  1 in @xcite ) .",
    "outside of 5@xmath0 , these residuals diminish and electronic artifacts dominate the noise profile .",
    "this issue was already encountered in ( * ? ? ? * see section 2.1 ) . in this work",
    "we have improved our artifact removal technique significantly in order to reach higher sensitivity .",
    "as the goal of this project is the detection of faint companions around bright stars , our data reduction procedure is designed to combine the individual exposures into a single high - dynamic - range final image , while suppressing the light from the primary star with an accurate psf subtraction .",
    "other direct imaging searches have employed the loci algorithm @xcite or principal component analysis ( @xcite ; @xcite ) for psf subtraction .",
    "both of these methods use psf segmentation to compensate for instabilities in the psf by using a library of psfs produced with a large number of roll angles .",
    "we have an insufficient number ( only one ) of roll angles to use these methods .",
    "furthermore , the thermal stability of irac s psf makes them less necessary , and electronic artifacts are the strongest source of noise , above the psf subtraction residual noise in most of our field of view .",
    "instead , our data reduction technique builds upon the work of @xcite .",
    "we started from basic calibrated data ( bcd ) images from the spitzer heritage archive , processed with the irac pipeline version s18.18.0 .",
    "we then wrote our own custom procedure to combine the nine individual frames from each dither position into a final image , for each star , in each irac band .",
    "standard mosaicing procedures are not suitable for our targets because , due to the small field of view of the subarray fields , the lack of background stars in the individual bcds prevents accurate world coordinate system ( wcs ) alignment of individual frames by the irac pipeline coordinate refining routine . as a consequence",
    ", mosaics made with the standard spitzer science center mopex software @xcite would be blurred .    as mentioned in section  [ targetselection ] , for subarray",
    ", electronic artifacts dominate the noise profile of psf - subtracted images outside of approximately @xmath51 from the center of the psf . these electronic artifacts ( shown in figure  [ electronicartifacts ] ; details provided in section  [ elec ] ) are produced by bright stars falling on the detector array .",
    "the response of the array to bright sources differs from pixel to pixel , so these artifacts need to be characterized and removed in situ , before the nine dither positions are shifted and co - added for sub - sampling .",
    "m. field of view is @xmath52.[electronicartifacts ] ]    two different psf subtractions were necessary .",
    "the first was performed to remove the light from the central bright star in order to better characterize the electronic artifacts .",
    "once characterized , the artifacts were removed from the bcds , allowing a second , cleaner psf subtraction to be performed to characterize the stars and search for companions .",
    "the irac psf is stable , but position dependent , differing in shape across the focal plane due to light - path geometry , with the most extreme differences near the edges , where the subarray field is located . because electronic artifact characterization requires a precise psf subtraction at each dither position , and since there is not a reliable , high s / n ratio spitzer irac psf available for subarray mode , we created our own psf for each star , using the other stars in our sample , on a per - dither - position basis .",
    "figure  [ process ] demonstrates our data reduction procedure . in order to characterize ,",
    "pixel by pixel , the pattern of the electronic artifacts , we subtracted the psf from each bcd image ( figure  [ process ] , panel a ) on the original 32@xmath4932-pixel grid . in @xcite , we used a psf made from archival data ( pid 30666 ) , but this was not ideal due to the different dither pattern used in those observations . for this analysis",
    ", we created a psf for each dither position from the other images in our data set .",
    "each image was aligned and stacked at the pixel size of the original 32@xmath4932 subarray grid to create a psf ( figure  [ process ] , panel b ) for each frame .",

    "a detected source is visible to the lower left of gj  581 in frames ( a ) and ( d ) .",
    "field of view is @xmath52 . [ process ] ]    irac starts to become non - linear at 10,000 and 12,000  dn in bands 1 and 2 , respectively @xcite , so we masked off any pixels higher than 99% of those threshold values .",
    "the fwhm of irac s 3.6  @xmath1 m psf is 1.66@xmath0 , or 1.36 native pixels ; assuming the core to be gaussian , a 0.1-pixel alignment error affects up to 11% of the image flux .",
    "the wcs coordinate uncertainty for our images is on the order of 1@xmath0 , roughly 0.8 pixels , making the wcs coordinates provided with the frames too imprecise for sub - pixel alignment of the individual frames .",
    "as previously mentioned , wcs coordinates could not be refined due to a lack of field objects in the subarray images .",
    "a simple 2-d centroid of each image was also inadequate for alignment purposes : the psf core changes shape even for small shifts of the stars on the pixel grid , due to irac under - sampling , pixel - phase effects , and position - dependent focus of the camera @xcite .",
    "instead , we calculated the stationary points of the numerical gradient of the core of the psf ( its not - saturated part ) along three evenly spaced ( 120 degrees ) axes and used the intersection of those gradients as the center coordinate for each image , giving a typical alignment precision ( average error ) in 3.6  @xmath1 m of 0.0027@xmath0 and 0.0028@xmath0 in 4.5  @xmath1 m . for comparison ,",
    "using a centroid for alignment of a 1.22@xmath0/pix image produced an average error of 0.07@xmath0 in 3.6  @xmath1 m and 4.5  @xmath1 m .",
    "@xmath46  and was too saturated for this technique to work and required manual adjustment .    using these coordinates to align the images together",
    ", we created a psf for each dither position of each star out of the other twelve star images in our data set ( omitting the star itself and 55  cnc , which has strong horizontal artifacts and was therefore not included in any psf ) .",
    "we normalized each star image to the target image by finding a multiplicative scale factor and a pedestal offset between them .",
    "the scale factor was initially estimated as the ratio of the total fluxes of the two images ( this would be incorrect to use as a final value because saturation and field star light differ among images ) , while the initial offset was set to zero . using these initial values",
    ", we calculated the slope of the radial profile of the difference of the two images .",
    "a subtraction with perfect normalization would have zero slope , and the slope is linearly related to the scale factor . after two more scale factor  best guesses \" , their respective subtraction slopes were used as the basis for a linear regression to calculate the final scale factor between the two images . using this scale factor , we performed a similar calculation to obtain the linear offset between each image and the target .",
    "the resulting aligned , normalized frames were stacked together .",
    "any pixels with values greater than @xmath53 above the median were discarded , and the mean of the remaining pixels became the psf for that dither position of that target star ( figure  [ process ] , panel b ) . by scaling our model psf to have the same irac flux as vega , we were able to use this same technique to calculate the photometry of each of our target stars ( results given in table  [ targetphot ] ) .",

    "there are several effects , shown in figure  [ electronicartifacts ] . ",
    "muxstripe \" is a ",
    "jail - bar \" pattern caused by excess charge in a pixel ( from a bright source ) unbalancing the multiplexer ( readout ) channel pedestals .",
    "this is superimposed with a repeating decay pattern in the lower half of the image .",
    " muxbleed \" is a horizontal bleeding of charge along the row(s ) and readout channel(s ) containing excess - charge pixels .",
    " pulldown \" is a central - column bias shift caused by a pixel with excess charge .",
    "we characterized these effects in sequence by creating and subtracting a correction matrix of each artifact before moving to the next : first , we masked off a circle with radius out to 10% saturation from the center of the psf in order to reduce the psf subtraction residuals that get included in our calculations , then removed each artifact type in turn .",
    "the muxstripe is a difference in pedestal value per multiplexer channel ( every fourth column of the image is read by a different channel ) , affecting the top and bottom of the image ( above and below the bright source ) differently .",
    "similarly , the muxbleed affects every fourth pixel of each of the @xmath103 rows surrounding the core of a bright source differently .",
    "both of these effects are characterized by the median value of the group of affected pixels , which we evaluated and then assigned to the corresponding area in the correction matrix .",
    "for example , to characterize the segment of the muxstripe in the bottom of the image in the first multiplexer channel , the median of all of the pixels comprising columns 0 , 4 , 8 , ... , 28 from rows 0 through the row containing the central star was assigned to the correction matrix in those locations .",
    "this was done similarly for the other channels and for the muxbleed .",
    "this matrix was then subtracted from the psf - masked image , to prepare for the next artifact to be removed .",
    "the decay artifact does not occur in every image , nor every readout channel , but when it occurs , it again affects every fourth column of the lower half ( below the bright source ) of the image similarly .",
    "previously @xcite , we had removed this artifact by fitting an exponential or linear function to each affected column , separately .",
    "we discovered , however , that the artifacts are better removed by assuming the pattern to be the same exponential function in every affected column and subtracting the median of the pixels in each row of those columns .",
    "affected readout channels were flagged manually and the median of each row in those columns was saved as a new correction matrix .",
    "this matrix was subtracted from the muxbleed / muxstriped - removed image .",
    "the pulldown always occurs in the same column as the core of the target star , and is different above and below the star .",
    "when the core of the target star falls within @xmath100.25 pixels of the boundary between pixels , the pulldown occurs on two adjacent columns .",
    "we modeled the pulldown as the median of the column(s ) containing the target star , top and bottom separately , then saved it as a third correction matrix .    at this point , we added the previous three correction matrices together to obtain a complete matrix of the pixel - dependent electronic artifacts in each bcd ( result shown in figure  [ process ] , panel c ) .",
    "subtracting this matrix from the psf - subtracted image gives us a visual check to show all artifacts have been removed ( figure  [ process ] , panel d ) .    to mitigate contamination from residual artifacts in our psfs , we subtracted the artifact correction matrix for each image from its bcd and remade new psfs from the result . because all pixel dependency had been removed , and because all stars were observed with the same dither pattern , the individual dither images",

    "we co - added the artifact - cleaned images at @xmath54 subsampling ( @xmath55/pix ) , then created a psf for each star using the process described in section  [ 1stpsf ] using the other sub - sampled images ( again omitting 55  cnc and the star itself ) .",
    "with nine spatially distinct dither positions , each pixel can be sub - sampled into at most nine ( 3@xmath493 ) sub - pixels , so after subtracting each star s model psf from its final mosaic , we rebinned the images back to @xmath56 sub - sampling ( @xmath57 ) for analysis ( figures  [ ch1regions ] & [ ch2regions ] ) .    combining these images with those from pid 30666",

    "once the psf and electronic artifacts are removed and the images are co - added , other sources become readily visible ( see figures  [ ch1regions ] & [ ch2regions ] ) . given the small number of sources in each image , we visually inspected each and measured the photometry of every area that seemed brighter than the background , using a custom procedure based on daophot .",
    "we used an aperture radius of two irac pixels ( 2.44@xmath0 ) where possible , or one ( 1.22@xmath0 ) for sources near the edge of the final images .",
    "sky annuli were chosen to fit the background while avoiding excessive psf subtraction noise for the typical source , and had an inner radius of 3.17@xmath0 ( 1.59@xmath0 ) with an outer radius of 5.12@xmath0 ( 2.56@xmath0 ) for the larger ( smaller ) apertures .",
    "aperture corrections were calculated as the difference in magnitudes between the flux inside each aperture listed above versus the flux inside a 10-irac - pixel aperture placed on a vega - scaled psf .",
    "these corrections in 4.5  @xmath1 m are @xmath59 mag for the larger aperture , @xmath60 mag for the smaller .",

    "four objects ( 47  uma-1 , hd  160691 - 8 , gj  86 - 1 , and gj  581 - 3 ) have potential colors that can be as red as a t5 or later brown dwarf , due to non - detections in 3.6  @xmath1 m .",
    "the subarray field of view is too small for the analysis pipeline to perform automatic pointing refinement .",
    "no subarray frames had sufficient 2mass sources to perform manual astrometric calibration , and our observations were taken before the  peak up \" function was available . therefore , the accuracy by which the wcs coordinates are known is limited by spitzer s star tracker , plus pointing drift , which is especially important for short exposures like subarray mode , and jitter ; the combination of these is on the order of 1@xmath0 .",
    "we performed relative astrometry on each source by computing its centroid and calculating the distance and position angle relative to the centroid of the central source ( table  [ sourcephot ] ) .",
    "because the psf is pixelated and has internal structure , the centroid can converge in a slightly different location depending on the subsampling of the psf due to the source falling on different parts of a pixel . to calculate the error of our relative astrometry , we randomly shifted our 0.24@xmath0/pix model psf 1000 times , each time rebinning to 0.407@xmath0/pix and comparing the known shift to the difference in measured centroids .",
    "the average of the resulting distribution is 0.05 pixels , or 0.02@xmath0 .",
    "this represents the best - case radial distance error for high signal - to - noise , isolated sources . for",
    "more crowded , dim sources , the convergence point of the centroid also depends on the initial guess . to calculate this error , we randomly picked 1000 starting locations within a radius of 2.1 pixels ( half the fwhm of irac s band 2 at 0.407@xmath0/pix ) around each source , and calculated the centroid using a box size of 6 pix .",
    "this produced a distribution of between 1 and 6  centroids . \"",
    "we report the center of the distribution as the source position and the rms spread as the initial - guess error .",
    "this error was on the order of 0.1@xmath0 and was added in quadrature with the psf - discretization error to find our total relative astrometry error , reported per source in table  [ sourcephot ] .      to supplement and confirm our subarray results , we performed follow - up photometry for all stars that had full - frame images available in the spitzer heritage archive ( listed in  full \" columns of table  [ sourcephot ] ) .",
    "these observations were performed with 30-second frame times and 5 gaussian dithers .",
    "we used iracproc to create mosaics and subtract the target stars psfs , then we performed aperture photometry . to isolate the typical source from artifacts and other sources of noise",

    "we restricted our analysis to this region because everything outside the subarray field of view in the full frame images had already been discounted by a previous proper motion search for widely separated companions without psf subtraction @xcite .",
    "several sources detected in subarray images were found to have counterparts in the full - frame images , including sources near the edge of the subarray frame that we originally thought to be noise ( see sources at the edges of hd  160691 , hd  147513 , and scr  j1845 - 6357 ) .",
    "some sources appearing in full - frame images were below the sensitivity of the subarray images .",

    "taking the lowest - error photometry in each band from either subarray or full frame , and assuming all of these sources to be at the same distance as their parent star , we plotted their [ 3.6]@xmath2[4.5 ] color versus 4.5 @xmath1 m absolute magnitude ( see figure  [ hrdiagram ] ) to compare with model substellar - mass objects of various temperatures @xcite and previously detected l and t dwarfs @xcite .",
    "we calculated sensitivity limits for each of our targets as a function of projected distance from the central star .",
    "our photometric sensitivity at any location within an image is limited by the local noise level around that point .",
    "the noise level within the frame is generally highest at the location of the target star and decreases radially outward , but with azimuthal deviations due to psf spikes and other features .",
    "we generated azimuthally averaged sensitivity curves , giving the noise - equivalent flux density ( nefd ) for given radial distances from the target star ( figures  [ sensitivity ] and [ sensitivity2 ] ) .",
    "we calculated the nefd in each point of the psf - subtracted image as the total rms noise flux over an aperture with diameter equal to the fwhm of the stellar psf ( 1.66@xmath0 for 3.6  @xmath1 m , 1.72@xmath0 for 4.5  @xmath1 m ) .",

    "less - massive objects should have lost more of their primordial heat by the time they reach 5  gyr old , thus they would be expected to dim by less than this amount over the following 5  gyr , so we feel confident that we are not significantly overestimating our mass sensitivity for objects older than 5  gyr .",
    "our best sensitivity occurs for nearby , young systems like scr  j1845 - 6357 , where we detected no @xmath625  m@xmath3 objects at projected separations between 25 - 80 au from its parent , and gj  876 , for which our limit is of a @xmath626  m@xmath3 object at projected separations from 50 - 100 au . for the older , more distant stars like @xmath46  and , 55  cnc , and 51  peg , we detected no objects greater than 25  m@xmath3 between projected separations of roughly 200 - 300 au , with the caution that our mass model sensitivity is overestimated for systems older than 5  gyr .",
