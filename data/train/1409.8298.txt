    "* ) and on the central versus satellite rank of a galaxy within its host group ( e.g. , colors and concentrations ; see , e.g. , @xcite , and also our papers i , ii and iii ) , it is important to compare the structural and star formation properties of merging galaxies and nonmerging control - sample galaxies at constant stellar mass _ and _ central versus satellite rank within the host group .",
    "consequently , we will compare @xmath50 merging satellites involved in satellite ",
    "satellite mergers , as well as satellite companions in mergers with central galaxies , with nonmerging satellites of similar masses and , @xmath51 merging centrals with nonmerging centrals of similar mass .",
    "the corresponding control sample will contain _ all _ nonmerging satellites or centrals with stellar masses within @xmath52dex from the median mass of the merger sample in a given mass bin .",
    "in particular , in the following we split the merger ( and control ) sample into two mass bins : a ` low galaxy mass bin ' , defined within the range [ @xmath53 [ @xmath54 ( median mass : @xmath55 ) , and a ` high galaxy mass bin ' , defined within the range [ @xmath56 @xmath54 ( median mass : @xmath57 for satellites and @xmath58 for centrals ) .",
    "the lower mass limit of @xmath39 is the 85@xmath59 stellar mass completeness level for our star - forming sample ; the corresponding value for quiescent galaxies is @xmath60 ( see paper ii ) .",
    "thus , our low galaxy mass bin is incomplete for passive galaxies and hence we will not comment on this population of galaxies .",
    "in contrast , a comparative analysis between merging galaxies and nonmerging control - sample galaxies is nevertheless robust because both galaxy populations suffer from identical incompleteness .",
    "furthermore , star - forming galaxies are mass - complete at these mass scales , enabling a sound comparison between merging and nonmerging star - forming galaxies .",
    "note that , because of the sample construction of zens ( see papers i and iii ) , in this low - mass bin there are no central merging galaxies and thus our analysis at these mass scales will refer to satellites only .",
    "on the other hand , the high galaxy mass bin is also complete for passive galaxies and is substantially populated by both satellite and central galaxies .",
    "therefore , at these higher galaxy masses we are able to explore mergers involving quenched or star - forming galaxies as well as central  satellite or satellite  satellite encounters . in the high - mass bin",
    "we have 28 mergers involving a central among the pairs in the sample and four centrals that are in the class of coalesced mergers .",
    "the remaining merging systems are , formally , satellite  satellite mergers .",
    "incompleteness in the parent 2dfgrs spectroscopic sample and statistical uncertainties in the group - finding algorithm may of course introduce errors in ranking central and satellite galaxies ( see paper i ) .",
    "as far as we could check , these merging systems involve genuine satellites , at least in the sense that they occur in relaxed groups that , considering the errors on the galaxy stellar mass estimates , clearly host substantially more massive galaxies ( identified as the centrals of these groups ) .",
    "only three mergers occur in unrelaxed groups in which the mass of the primary galaxy is consistent with being the largest in the group ( although it has been discarded as central on the basis of velocity constraints ; see paper i ) .",
    "finally , the zens detection limits ( given by the 1@xmath61 background fluctuations in a uniform area of 1 arcsec@xmath62 ) of @xmath63 = 27.2 magarcsec@xmath64 and @xmath65 = 25.5 magarcsec@xmath64 ( ab magnitudes ) prevent us from detecting ( smooth ) weak tidal features at lower surface brightnesses ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "according to simulations @xcite , such features are distinctive of either minor mergers or of the late stages of major encounters .",
    "they are visible 34 gyr after the mergers if created by the interaction of a bulge - dominated system with a disk - dominated one . in this case",
    ", we may only miss mergers that occurred @xmath66 gyr prior to the observation .",
    "on the other hand , very low surface brightness features are visible for @xmath11 gyr if originated in a merger of two dynamically hot systems @xcite . in this case ,",
    "strong features quickly fade away , so we may miss somewhat more recent mergers .      in sections [ sec : satellites ] and [",
    "sec : centrals ] we will compare colors and derived properties such as sfr and ssfr of merging and nonmerging galaxies .",
    "we hence briefly discuss here the sources of uncertainties on such quantities .",
    "we refer the interested reader to paper iii for a general discussion on errors affecting the parameters derived from the sed fitting and focus instead on the aspects that are more specific to the merger sample .    for mergers in which the two galaxies are sufficiently separated or for the disturbed isolated galaxies ( class 4 ) , the main sources of uncertainties are those also affecting the other zens galaxies , i.e. , background noise and errors in the sed modeling .",
    "namely , we expect typical errors on the masses , color and ssfr of a given galaxies to be on the order of 0.05 mag , 0.1 dex and 0.2 dex , respectively .",
    "we show these average uncertainties for the individual measurements with gray crosses in figures [ figure_4]-[figure_7 ] .",
    "however , for class 3 mergers or very close pairs almost at coalescence in classes 1 and 2 , the blending between the two merging galaxies can introduce further biases in the estimates of magnitudes and colors ( and hence masses and sfr ) . to test the effects of such galaxy confusion",
    ", we generated a set of artificial images consisting of two model galaxies placed at increasingly closer separations , starting from the maximum distance of 50 kpc .",
    "the simulated galaxies were selected to have magnitudes and sizes within the range observed in our merger sample and the artificial images were processed to reproduce the typical zens resolution and noise properties .",
    "while it is important to probe different combinations of inclinations and steepness of the light profiles for testing the efficiency of recovery of the intrinsic fluxes ( see the extensive discussion in paper ii ) , a dense sampling of all regions of the parameter space is beyond the scope of this test .",
    "to bracket the typical observed distributions , we thus created galaxies with either srsic index @xmath67=1 or @xmath67=4 and ellipticities between 0 and 0.6 .",
    "we then processed these artificial mergers as the real zens pairs and compared the fluxes measured within our fiducial 2@xmath68 aperture ( see paper iii for all details of the photometric measurements in zens ) with those that would be obtained if the galaxy were in isolation .    as a result of this test we found that robust flux estimates can be derived for pairs with separations down to 8 kpc , resulting in a median magnitude difference from the isolated case smaller than 0.05 mag , i.e. comparable with the photometric uncertainty . in our sample of class 1 and 2 mergers about 25% ( six out of 26 )",
    "are located at separations smaller than 8 kpc .",
    "we have tested our results by excluding these objects with larger uncertainties and found no substantial change with respect to what is discussed in the following for the entire sample .",
    "let us start by addressing the question of whether and how the galaxy merger fraction @xmath0 at a constant galaxy stellar mass depends on any of the environments that we study in zens , i.e. , group halo mass @xmath31 , group - centric distance @xmath69 , and lss density @xmath38 .",
    "note that , unless specified otherwise , we join together the samples of merging satellites and centrals in the _ total = central+satellite _ merger fractions , independent of galaxy rank within the group potentials .",
    "specifically , in each of our galaxy stellar mass and environmental bins , we estimate the merger fraction as @xmath70 , i.e. , as the ratio between the number of merging systems in that bin and the number nonmerging galaxies ( central plus satellites ) in the same galaxy mass and environmental bin . for this calculation ,",
    "we count merging pairs as a single system with the mass assigned by the primary galaxy .          in figure  [ figure_1 ]",
    "we show the merger fraction @xmath0 as a function of the host halo mass , split into bins of primary galaxy stellar mass ( dark blue : high - mass primaries - light blue : low - mass primaries ) .",
    "the results for all mergers ( i.e. , separation @xmath71 kpc ) in our sample are shown with dashed lines ( dotted when the mergers involving centrals are removed at high galaxy masses ) , whereas the measured fraction for close ( @xmath72 kpc ) mergers are shown with solid lines ( dot - dashed when the mergers involving centrals are removed ) .",
    "focusing at first on the entire sample of zens groups ( left panel in the figure ) and @xmath73 galaxies , we find that the merger fraction is a factor of @xmath1 23 higher in the low group - mass bin relative to the high group - mass bin .",
    "specifically , @xmath0 increases from @xmath74 in groups with @xmath75 , up to @xmath76 in lower mass groups , with a @xmath77 significance at both separations of @xmath72 kpc and @xmath71 kpc .",
    "the decline of the merger fraction between our low and high group - mass bins suggests that low - mass galaxy  galaxy merger activity is virtually fully suppressed in potential wells above mass scales of order @xmath78 . no dependence on halo mass",
    "is instead observed at galaxy masses @xmath79 when considering all groups ; however , if we restrict the sample to relaxed groups only ( right panel ) a @xmath80 decrease in the merger fraction with halo mass is also observed at these high masses . considering @xmath72 kpc pairs as our reference",
    ", we find a variation in the fraction @xmath81 for both galaxy mass bins .",
    "similar slopes , within the errors , are also measured at separations of @xmath71 kpc and @xmath82 kpc ( not shown ) , strengthening the inference of the halo mass being the main driver of the change , with no effects due to the stage at which the mergers are observed .",
    "as discussed in paper i , the statistical scatter in our group - mass estimates most likely decreases the strength of any measured trend with halo mass ; tests performed in paper i indicate a flattening of a factor of @xmath83 of the slope of the relationship between merger faction and group halo mass ( paper i ) .",
    "hence , the increase in the merger fraction from high- to low - mass groups is estimated to be intrinsically @xmath84dex@xmath7 .",
    "given the specifics of our sample , removing the mergers that involve a central galaxy ( dotted and dot - dashed lines in figure  [ figure_1 ] ) affects only the high galaxy mass bin .",
    "because satellite ",
    "central mergers make up @xmath85 of the total number of merger occurrences at these masses , the net effect is a strong suppression of the merger fraction at any halo mass .",
    "more specifically , at @xmath72 kpc ( dot - dashed line ) the exclusion of such mergers leaves a flat trend with halo mass .",
    "the trend becomes instead positive when considering mergers with all separations ( dotted line ) , owing to the presence of a few massive satellite  satellite mergers in high - mass groups . as discussed above",
    ", three such cases occur in unrelaxed groups and the masses of the merging satellites are similar ( within the errors ) to the masses of the centrals in the same halos . removing them ( by considering only relaxed groups ; right panel of the figure ) would also produce a flat trend , within errors , of the massive satellite ",
    "satellite merger fraction with the host halo mass .    finally ,",
    "as a consistency check , we note that measured @xmath0 values for the entire sample of zens mergers are consistent with previously reported merger fractions for low - redshift galaxies of similar masses ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . also , the @xmath0 value that we measure in the high galaxy mass bin at high halo masses is in agreement with the results reported by @xcite , who studied the properties of high - mass ( @xmath86 ) galaxy pairs with @xmath87 kpc separation in sdss groups above @xmath88 ; these authors found a merger fraction of @xmath113% at a halo mass scale of @xmath88 , consistent with our result .",
    "considering the variation of the merger fraction with distance from the group center in figure [ figure_2 ] , the most striking effect we observe is a strong decrease in @xmath0 moving from the inner ( @xmath89 ) group regions toward the group outskirts , if mergers with @xmath90 are considered .",
    "the effect is seen at all separations and at more than the @xmath91 level in the full merger sample , where @xmath0 varies by a factor of @xmath13 , from @xmath92 to @xmath93 .    however , remembering what was already discussed in the previous section regarding the frequency of central ",
    "satellite mergers at these high galaxy masses , we stress that the increase in merger fraction toward the group centers is largely driven by mergers involving the central galaxy of the given group , which are at @xmath94 by construction .",
    "in fact , when systems in which the primary is also a central galaxy are excluded ( dotted and dot - dashed lines in figure  [ figure_2 ] ) we do not measure any significant change in @xmath0 with group - centric distance .",
    "this highlights the importance of categorizing galaxies according to their rank within their host - group halos , to avoid incorrect interpretations of the observational signals .    as the only marginal effect of the group dynamical state",
    ", we mention that in _",
    "unrelaxed _ groups the fraction of mergers with @xmath95 kpc formally increases in the group outskirts when centrals are excluded , with a slope of @xmath96 and a @xmath97 significance .",
    "one can speculate that the massive satellite  satellite mergers giving rise to this trend have probably just been accreted .",
    "coupled with what was mentioned in the previous section , that their masses are consistent within the errors with that of the nominal central galaxy of their halos , we could identify these mergers as one of the channels that will create the new central galaxy when the group will have relaxed .    in the low galaxy mass bin , which instead includes only satellite galaxies , we measure a @xmath98 variation of @xmath0 with @xmath69 when the entire @xmath71 kpc merger sample is considered ( dashed line ) suggesting a mild dependence on group - centric distance of satellite ",

    "in other words , a substantial fraction of the low - mass satellites in mergers with the highest sfrs are those in groups that are not yet relaxed . in contrast , low - mass satellites in mergers with low ( @xmath148 ) sfr are mostly in relaxed systems .",

    "the control sample is however of a similar amount , keeping the merger - induced bluening almost constant with environment .",
    "therefore , turning the argument around , we demonstrate that the effect of mergers is to induce a @xmath149 mag blueing of the color irrespective of environment ( within the errors ) at low galaxy masses .",
    "this is a clear example that highlights the need for comparing merging galaxies and control samples at fixed mass _ and _ environment in order to isolate the effect of mergers on galaxy properties .",
    "third , for low - mass merging satellites , the enhancement in the sfr becomes more significant in the group outer regions .",
    "although the radial trend is partly due to the fact that the low - mass nonmerging satellites are preferentially located at large radii rather than in the group cores thus reducing the scatter ( i.e. , the width of the shaded area ) around the median sfr in the former regions , our data suggest that the _ strength _ of the merger - induced star - formation episode may change with environment .",
    "we checked , by generating random control subsamples matching in mass distribution and number of galaxies those involved in mergers in a given environmental bin , that any little difference in the mass distributions of both the merger and the control sample in the low galaxy mass bin did not contribute to the signal .    in conclusion , we are able to order the different environmental indicators by importance in setting the star - formation properties of the merging system : the most important indicator is the proximity to the companion , then the status ( relaxed or unrelaxed ) of the host group and finally the position within the halo .",
    "we now focus on the properties of merging _ central galaxies _ with an analysis similar to that done for satellite galaxies . as highlighted in section [ sec : biases ] , this analysis of centrals is limited to the high galaxy mass bin , and is conducted at a median galaxy stellar mass of @xmath150 .    at these galaxy masses , merging central galaxies have red colors ( @xmath151 mag ) similar to the control - sample nonmerging centrals of comparable masses , reflecting the fact that the high - mass centrals of our sample are mostly passively evolving systems , whether they are in a merger or not ( middle and bottom panels of figure  [ figure_4 ] ) .",

    "moreover , we note that high - mass secondaries ( which are by definition satellite galaxies ) that are members of merging pairs are as red as their primaries : the median color difference between primary central galaxies and high - mass secondary satellite galaxies involved in the merging pairs is always @xmath153 mag ( figure  [ figure_4 ] ) .",
    "this is a straightforward consequence of the fact that both primary central galaxy and secondary satellite companion galaxies have stellar masses in the regime where passive bulge - dominated galaxies dominate the global galaxy population at @xmath154 . following a similar reasoning as in section [ sec : satsizes ]",

    "the median sfr in the centrals of such pairs are also low ( @xmath158 yr@xmath7 ) .",

    "[ figure_8 ] and [ figure_10 ] , the environment ( including the relaxed or unrelaxed status of the host group ) does not strongly affect the stellar or structural properties of central galaxies involved in mergers . the only suggested environmental effect is an increase in the difference between the half - light radii of merging and noninteracting centrals with halo mass / lss density , in the sense that merging centrals appear more noticeably extended than the control sample when located in a massive group or low @xmath38 .",
    "the number of zens central galaxies in these bins is however small ( @xmath162 ) , and the observed trends should be confirmed with larger samples .",

    "large catalogs of simulated mergers show that the strongest bursts happen in a minority ( 15% ) of the cases and are short lived , whereas 76% of fly - bys and 50% of mergers display an integrated sfr only 1.25 larger than that of isolated galaxies ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) .",

    "the predicted star - formation enhancement in these simulations is comparable during fly - bys and coalescence , justifying a posteriori our choice to discuss mergers at coalescence and those in very close pairs at the same time .",

    "this is potentially interesting in light of the results in @xcite , where we discuss the possibility that quenching may not significantly alter the structural properties of galaxies , which are instead set prior to star - formation cessation , and find that the increase in the median b / t of quenched satellite galaxies with respect to star - forming ones can be explained by fading of the disks following quenching .    despite the boost in ssfr induced by the merger event ,",

    "halo - occupation models further support this interpretation by showing that the merger efficiency ( i.e. , the merger timescale relative to the hubble time ) is about an order of magnitude higher at halo masses @xmath168 than in massive halos with @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "these overall trends discussed when showing figure  [ figure_1 ] aggregate both mergers onto the central and satellite  satellite mergers . at high galaxy masses , from figure  [ figure_1 ] we can infer that the biggest contribution to the slope @xmath169 comes from mergers involving central galaxies .",
    "this is further highlighted in figure  [ figure_11 ] , where we present once again our results on the merger fraction as a function of @xmath31 for relaxed groups , this time considering separately mergers with a central as the primary galaxy ( left panel ) and mergers with a satellite as the primary galaxy ( right panel ) .",
    "the slope @xmath169 stays almost constant with pair separation around a value of @xmath170 .",
    "such a value for the slope can be qualitatively understood in terms of the merger rate scaling as the inverse of the group velocity dispersion to the third power ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , further considering that this latter quantity scales as @xmath171 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "for example , in their sdss sample of @xmath172 galaxies , @xcite find that at least half of their merger events involve a central  satellite systems .",
    "the increase in the merger rate with decreasing group - centric distance is expected in analytical estimates ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . moreover , the important role of mergers in building up the central galaxies of groups is well documented in numerical simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and is supported by observations at both similar @xcite and earlier epochs ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as that of the zens sample .",
    "finally , we note that the mild increase in the merger fraction of low galaxy mass satellites in regions of low ( relative to high ) lss density is also found in other data sets ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this would also be supported by the predictions of the @xcite semianalytical model that show a decrease ( 9% @xmath173 6% ) in the merger fraction as the density increases , in agreement within the errors with the zens data .      in order to make a more quantitative comparison with theoretical expectations , we made use of the publicly available data from the @xcite semianalytical model . in brief",
    ", the model follows the dynamics of the subhaloes hosting the satellite galaxies until their dark matter content exceeds their baryonic mass , switching a _ merger clock _ based on the estimated dynamical friction timescale afterward . by construction ,",
    "satellite galaxies merge with the central of their halo .",
    "groups fulfilling the zens specifics in terms of redshift , masses , number of members and @xmath174 magnitude of the galaxies were selected from a snapshot of the simulation box that was projected onto one of its axes in order to define the projected lss density exactly as in paper i and to compute projected distances among galaxies .",
    "mergers were then identified according to the projected separation and velocities @xmath175 , as in the empirical sample .",
    "the dark red lines in figure  [ figure_11 ] show the predictions from @xcite for the merger fraction versus @xmath31 relation .",
    "as shown in the left panel , by selecting @xmath4920 kpc ( @xmath17650 kpc ) pairs involving central galaxies , we estimate in the models a merger fraction of @xmath16% ( @xmath117% ) at low @xmath31 and @xmath12% ( @xmath15% ) at higher group mass , respectively .",
    "the predicted variation @xmath177 of the merger fraction with halo mass for mergers involving a central is in excellent agreement with our findings at small separations .",
    "when selecting @xmath17650 kpc pairs , the model predicts instead a steeper slope than the observed one , but still in agreement within the errors .    because in the @xcite model the satellite mergers are computed on the basis of the dynamical friction formulae , in light of what was discussed at the outset of this section , it is not surprising that the simulation broadly matches the observed trend with halo mass .",
    "it is , however , remarkable the agreement in the normalization , namely in the actual merger fractions . given this consistency with observations for the merger fraction in groups of different halo masses , we can use the model predictions to estimate that 1/6 ( @xmath11/2 ) of the central ",
    "satellite mergers at low ( high ) halo masses and d@xmath17620 kpc in zens will coalesce in less than @xmath178300myr , whereas the remainder of the systems will take @xmath11gyr .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ figure_11 ] shows that mergers involving only high - mass satellite as primaries are instead significantly underestimated in the model with respect to our measure for relaxed groups . in the @xcite semianalytical model , real satellite ",
    "satellite mergers are in general extremely rare , with a fraction lower than 0.1% that is well below our measured fraction . in the model , these mergers involve a central of a halo that has been accreted and still is a cooling site . similarly rare are satellite ",
    "satellite mergers fraction in other semianalytical models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "there are two possible interpretations of these findings .",
    "the first is that these models miss a key ingredient , namely satellite  satellite merging , which , if happening in nature ( as indicated by our data ) , would be an important channel through which environment operates on galaxies .",
    "another possibility is , however , that our results are affected by projection effects , which increase the number of close satellite  satellite pairs . to disentangle between these alternatives",
    ", we estimate the fraction of close ( @xmath179 kpc ) low - mass satellite  satellite pairs that are sufficiently distant from their central galaxy to avoid satellite ",
    "central mergers ; we thus set a threshold distance of 50 kpc between the satellite ",
    "satellite pair and the central galaxy . in the models ,",
    "the fraction of such systems that we find in low and high @xmath31 groups is respectively @xmath180% and @xmath181% .",
    "these fractions are well below our estimated fractions in the zens sample ( see figure  [ figure_1 ] ) , and they provide support for the interpretation that only a small fraction of our detected satellite  satellite mergers are due to projection effects that lead to galaxy closeness or even superposition",
    ".    dark matter simulations also provide support in the same direction .",
    "@xcite show that satellite  satellite mergers occur in a @xmath13cdm universe and become increasingly more frequent with decreasing subhalo versus main - halo mass ratio .",
    "these authors interpret this result as being due to mergers of progenitor satellites that are members of a subhalo that is in the process of being accreted by a larger halo .",
    "we finally also use the models to estimate whether spurious galaxy superpositions may have led us to overestimated the central  satellite merger fractions . to this purpose",
    "we compute in the zens sample the fraction of non - member galaxies which lie at a projected distance @xmath182 kpc from the central of a given group .",
    "we compare this fraction with the population of galaxies in the simulation cube that lie within a 20 mpc thick slice centered on the given group , which have a velocity difference @xmath183 and projected distance @xmath184 relative to the central galaxy of that group .",
    "this returns a probability of a random projection @xmath185 at all group masses under study .",
    "we therefore also conclude that the central  satellite merger fractions that we have estimated from our sample are not severely affected by superposition effects .",
    "in contrast to the above - mentioned complex galaxy formation simulations , a simple yet successful empirical picture of galaxy formation has been recently presented to explain the role of galaxy mass and environment in the evolution of the mass function of both active and passive galaxies @xcite .",
    "this scenario explains the evolution of galaxies as a population driven by the cosmic run of the ssfr and its interplay with both internally and environmentally induced quenching rates . for what concerns our paper ,",
    "it is useful to remind that in the @xcite framework , mergers are proportionally more important for the growth of massive galaxies than at lower galaxy masses , and that the merger fraction is about a factor of four higher in the densest regions ( which in their definition roughly corresponds to the inner group regions , @xcite ) than in the less dense environment .",
    "massive galaxies , however , have already been _ mass _ quenched .",
    "therefore , the mergers involving massive galaxies are dry and the fraction of passive galaxies undergoing subsequent dry mergers quickly increases at masses above @xmath186 .",
    "this is consistent with zens data where : ( 1 ) the median mass of centrals involved in high mass mergers exceeds @xmath186 ; ( 2 ) their colors are as red as galaxies in the control sample at the same mass , and ( 3 ) a strong radial dependence of the merger fraction linked to the growth of the centrals ( e.g. , figure  [ figure_2 ] ) is found . in addition",
    ", we find that the star formation is generally not enhanced in low - mass satellites merging with centrals .",
    "taking into account the mass ratios of the pairs in our sample , we expect that the increase in mass caused by these dry mergers will be between 15% ( median contribution of low - mass secondaries ) and 38% ( median contribution if the secondary is in the high galaxy mass bin ) .",
    "a quantitatively similar average increase in mass is also expected by @xcite considering the constraints given by the galaxy mass function evolution .",
    "therefore , our data offer to the broad picture of galaxy formation a quantitative estimate of the typical growth of central galaxies in the @xmath187 group environment .",
    "we have utilized the sample of @xmath3 zens galaxies with @xmath2 ( 1274 galaxies ) and its 162 identified merging or close pairs systems to investigate : @xmath30 the dependence of the merger fraction @xmath0 on three different measurements of environment , i.e. , halo mass , group - centric distance , and lss density ; and @xmath32 the internal properties of merging satellite and central galaxies in comparison with galaxies of a control sample having similar stellar masses , rank within the host group potentials , and environment .",
    "our main findings are as follows :    1 .   in relaxed groups and at any galaxy mass scale in the range",
    "@xmath188 10@xmath189 , an enhancement in @xmath0 by a factor of @xmath190 is observed in groups with masses @xmath191 relative to higher mass groups . the sharp drop in @xmath0 at halo masses",
    "@xmath192 suggests that merger activity is effectively suppressed by the large galaxy velocities sustained in high mass halos . in the case of relaxed groups ,",
    "we infer a variation in the merger fraction @xmath193 dex@xmath7 , which is almost independent on galaxy mass and merger stage .",
    "2 .   a similar increase in the merger fraction at low lss densities ( @xmath194 )",
    "is seen in our data at the @xmath195 level for low - mass pairs or high - mass mergers involving a central galaxy .",
    "we find that it holds at the @xmath196 level if we restrict the analysis to groups with @xmath197 and hence it is not caused by an underlying correlation between halo mass and overdensity .",
    "this interesting suggested effect is thus a possible indication of the influence of the lss density on low - mass mergers and central  satellites interactions which should be further investigated with larger data sets .",
    "most mergers that we observe in our sample at galaxy masses @xmath198 are central ",
    "satellite , gas - depleted dry mergers ( see also , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "these high - mass dry mergers occur preferentially in relaxed groups , and support numerical experiments indicating a substantial role of mergers in the mass assembly histories of the central galaxies of group halos ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "4 .   the high frequency of central  satellite mergers at high galaxy masses results in a nominal increase of @xmath0 in the inner , @xmath199 group regions ; this highlights the need to accurately disentangle the galaxy populations of groups / clusters into centrals and satellites , in order to properly interpret any observational trend in galaxy properties with group or cluster - centric distance .",
    "5 .   at low galaxy masses of @xmath200 , where in zens we are only probing satellite galaxies , we find evidence of merger - induced star formation in the gas - rich ( satellite  satellite ) mergers . the relevant environments in determining the amount of induced star formation are , in decreasing order of importance , the proximity to the companion , the status ( relaxed / unrelaxed ) of the host group , and to a minor extent the position within the halo .",
    "in particular , the low - mass satellite ",
    "satellite mergers have ( specific ) sfrs enhanced by a factor of @xmath4 relative to their nonmerging counterparts when we consider either coalesced or very close ( @xmath14 kpc ) systems .",
    "furthermore , a substantial fraction of the low - mass satellites in mergers with the highest sfr are those in groups that are not yet relaxed , whereas low - mass satellites in mergers with low ( @xmath201 ) sfr are mostly in relaxed systems",
    ". 6 .   from the analysis of the color maps and the comparison of the color gradients of merging galaxies to those of the control sample",
    ", it appears that these boosted star - formation activities are mostly distributed over the whole galaxy body , rather than being concentrated in a nuclear ` burst ' of star formation .",
    "the most recent numerical simulations also correct earlier claims for a merger - driven nuclear enhancement of star formation and ascribe to stellar feedback the diffusion of the star - formation activity throughout the extent of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "this may also explain the @xmath12 larger sizes ( implying @xmath123@xmath202 lower surface mass densities ) of these low - mass merging satellites relative to nonmerging satellites of similar mass .",
    "the mass doubling timescales for low - mass satellite ",
    "satellite mergers is 23 gyr , a factor of @xmath190 times shorter than that of similar nonmerging galaxies , but it remains nevertheless a factor of @xmath203 longer than numerically estimated merging timescales for these systems @xcite .",

    "<S> we use the _ zurich environmental study ( zens ) _ database to investigate the environmental dependence of the merger fraction @xmath0 and merging galaxy properties in a sample of @xmath11300 group galaxies with @xmath2 and @xmath3 . in all galaxy mass bins investigated in our study , we find that @xmath0 decreases by a factor of @xmath4 in groups with halo masses @xmath5 relative to less massive systems , indicating a suppression of merger activity in large potential wells . in the fiducial case of relaxed groups only , we measure a variation @xmath6 dex@xmath7 , which is almost independent of galaxy mass and merger stage . at galaxy masses </S>",
    "<S> @xmath8 , most mergers are dry accretions of quenched satellites onto quenched centrals , leading to a strong increase of @xmath0 with decreasing group - centric distance at these mass scales . </S>",
    "<S> both satellite and central galaxies in these high mass mergers do not differ in color and structural properties from a control sample of nonmerging galaxies of equal mass and rank . at galaxy masses @xmath9  where we mostly probe satellite  satellite pairs and mergers between star - forming systems  close pairs ( projected distance @xmath10 kpc ) show instead @xmath11 enhanced ( specific ) star formation rates and @xmath12 larger sizes than similar mass , nonmerging satellites . </S>",
    "<S> the increase in both size and sfr leads to similar surface star - formation densities in the merging and control - sample satellite populations . </S>"
