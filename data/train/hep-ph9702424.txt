    "recent years have seen improvements in the calculational techniques for one - loop amplitudes @xcite . besides calculations of new amplitudes for phenomenological @xcite purposes , a number of infinite sequences of amplitudes have been obtained @xcite . at two- or higher - loops",
    "there has not been analogous progress as yet , although there is a need for such calculations in the analysis of experiments .",
    "for example , experiments at lep are currently sensitive to next - to - next - to leading order corrections to @xmath1 jets @xcite ; this requires two - loop amplitudes as an input .",
    "before this and other two - loop calculations can be undertaken , a number of technical issues must be addressed .",
    "it would be useful to have an efficient technique for obtaining compact analytic expressions for two - loop amplitudes .",
    "some first steps in developing such a technique have recently been reported using ideas motivated by string theory @xcite .",
    "in particular , reuter , schmidt and schubert @xcite have performed an elegant evaluation of two - loop quantities using a world - line approach .",
    "kim and nair @xcite have also set up a multi - loop formulation of the recursive approach @xcite .",
    "another technical hurdle is that many of the required integrals are uncalculated @xcite .",
    "the construction of a numerical program to extract jet cross - sections would also require significant work ; in particular , one would need to extend the known techniques for handling the infrared divergent corners of phase space @xcite .    in this letter",
    "we explore the use of cutting rules @xcite to obtain compact analytical expressions for two - loop amplitudes .",
    "in particular , we compute the @xmath2 supersymmetric four - gluon amplitudes in terms of a basic set of scalar integral functions . amplitudes in @xmath3 super - yang - mills are particularly simple and are therefore a good starting point .    at tree - level @xcite and one - loop , infinite sequences of gauge theory amplitudes have been explicitly constructed .",
    "can one find such sequences for higher - loop amplitudes ?",
    "in this letter we also present a pattern for the leading - color four - gluon amplitudes to all orders of perturbation theory consistent with two - particle cuts .",
    "we do not , however , have a proof that the pattern is the complete answer and it is possible that a more complete analysis including three- or higher - particle cuts might reveal additional terms .    in the past , cutting rules @xcite have been widely used in field theory and provide powerful constraints on the form of amplitudes . in order to construct complete amplitudes one must have control of the ambiguities and subtractions . at one - loop",
    "it has been shown that for amplitudes satisfying a power counting criterion , such as supersymmetric ones , one can obtain the complete answer from four - dimensional cuts and knowledge of the set of integral functions that can appear in the result @xcite . for amplitudes",
    "not satisfying the power counting criterion one may unambiguously obtain the amplitudes by computing the cuts to all orders in the dimensional regularization parameter @xcite , since all terms develop cuts . at two loops",
    "much less is known about the integral functions . nevertheless , for the supersymmetric two - loop amplitudes considered in this letter one can perform a complete reconstruction .",

    "this will be useful later when we construct two - loop amplitudes .    when using cuts to obtain the @xmath0 gluon amplitudes we also need tree and one - loop amplitudes with either two external scalars or fermions , since these particles can also cross the cuts .",

    "first we briefly review the cut construction method @xcite , extending it to the case of two loops . following the discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite , a convenient way to obtain amplitudes is by considering cuts of unrestricted loop momentum integrals . in this way",
    ", one may simultaneously construct the imaginary and associated real parts of the cuts .",
    "consider for example , the cuts of the two - loop amplitude @xmath49 . at two loops",
    "one must consider both two- and three - particle cuts . in each channel",
    "there may be multiple contributing cuts .",
    "for example , in the @xmath50 channel there are two two - particle cuts , as depicted in .",
    "the first of these has the explicit representation @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the momenta of the cut legs and the sum runs over all particle types ( including helicity ) @xmath54 and @xmath55 which may propagate across the two cut lines .",
    "we may use the on - shell conditions @xmath56 and @xmath57 in the integrand ( but not on the cut propagators ) since this equation is valid only for those terms which have explicit @xmath52 and @xmath53 propagators .",
    "it is convenient to apply the color decomposition ( [ twoloopcolor ] ) before computing the various cut contributions .",
    "the three - particle @xmath50-channel cut is depicted in .",
    "the @xmath58-channel cuts , of course , have a similar structure to the @xmath50-channel cuts . by combining all cuts into a single function ,",
    "one obtains the full amplitude . when combining the cuts ,",
    "care must be exercised not to over - count a particular term .    -.7 cm    -.75 cm    as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , by computing cuts to all orders in the dimensional regularization parameter , one may perform a complete reconstruction of a massless loop amplitude .",
    "this follows from dimensional analysis since every term in an amplitude must have a prefactor of powers of @xmath59 , which necessarily have cuts . for reasons of technical simplicity",
    ", it is convenient to use helicity amplitudes which implicitly replace the @xmath60-dimensional momenta of the cut lines by four - dimensional momenta .",
    "however , to do so we must ensure that errors , especially through @xmath61 , are not introduced . in section  [ validitysection ] , we shall argue that at least for the @xmath0 four - point amplitudes there are no such errors .",
    "we also find it convenient to perform the cut construction in components instead of using superfields .",
    "the potential advantage of a superfield formalism would be that one would simultaneously include contributions from all particles in a supersymmetry multiplet .",
    "however , for maximally helicity violating amplitudes , the supersymmetry identities are sufficiently powerful that once the contribution from one component is known the others immediately follow .",
    "a component formulation is also more natural for extensions to qcd .",

    "the @xmath70 term in the trace does not contribute because a four - point amplitude has only three independent momenta to contract into the totally anti - symmetric levi - civita tensor .",
    "the above sewing algebra is particularly simple because it is identical to that of the one - loop case , discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "thus , after canceling numerator factors against propagators and identifying the remaining integral as a two - loop scalar integral we obtain @xmath71 where the two - loop planar scalar double - box integral is @xmath72    the evaluation of the two - particle @xmath50-channel cut in b is similar and gives the same result .",
    "the evaluation of the @xmath58-channel two - particle cuts are again similar , but a bit more involved since all particles in the super - multiplet contribute . however , after summing over the contribution of all particles , with the help of the supersymmetry identities and spinor identities , the integral appearing in the @xmath58-channel cut coincides with the one appearing in the @xmath50-channel cut in , but with @xmath50 and @xmath58 interchanged .    -.7 cm",
    "-.75 cm    the three - particle cuts reproduce the results obtained from the two particle cuts without adding any new integral functions . the result of evaluating the three - particle @xmath50-channel cut in is depicted in .",

    "this calculation is more complicated than the two - particle cut calculation since one must sum over a total of sixteen intermediate particle and helicity configurations .",
    "nevertheless the @xmath0 supersymmetry ensures that the various terms combine neatly .",
    "combining all cuts into a single function that has the correct cuts in all channels yields the final result for the leading color @xmath0 four - gluon partial amplitude , @xmath74 this is depicted in .",
    "we comment that although substantial progress has been made in the calculation of such integrals @xcite , the scalar integral appearing in this amplitude has not yet been evaluated in terms of known functions .",
    "this amplitude exhibits the cyclic symmetry for the leading color partial amplitudes ( up to an overall @xmath75 ) implied by the supersymmetry identity ( [ cyclicidentity ] ) , as expected .",
    "we may also use the supersymmetry identity ( [ cyclicidentity ] ) to immediately obtain the leading color partial amplitude with non - adjacent negative helicities .    -.7 cm",
    "-.75 cm    the computation of the subleading color pieces is similar to the leading color computation , so we only quote the results .",
    "there are two types of subleading color contributions .",
    "firstly , there are contributions arising from planar diagrams .",
    "these can be determined by evaluating the color algebra for the feynman diagrams and are given by nothing more than sums of permutations of arguments of the same functions that appear at leading color .",
    "secondly , there is a new contribution characterized by diagrams with non - planar topology .",
    "the cut construction of the non - planar contributions is quite similar to the planar one , with the main difference being the appearance of non - planar scalar integrals in the final results .",
    "the results for the subleading in @xmath14 partial amplitudes are @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "the planar scalar integral is defined in , while the non - planar one , depicted in , is @xmath79    -.7 cm    -.75",
    "cm    a simple consistency check on the amplitudes ( [ leadingcolorresult ] ) and ( [ subleadingcolorresult ] ) is that they satisfy the expected finiteness condition ( [ finiteness ] ) .",
    "we now discuss potential errors arising from our use of four - dimensional helicity amplitudes in the cuts .",
    "such errors would not occur if the sewing were done using formal spinors and polarization vectors . when using the four - dimensional spinor helicity formalism potential errors will be of the form , @xmath80 where we have explicitly separated the loop momenta into four- and @xmath81-dimensional parts .",
    "( a discussion of the @xmath81-dimensional parts of loop momenta can be found , for example , in refs .",
    "terms in the integrand proportional to @xmath81-dimensional momenta @xmath82 or @xmath83 , may in principle have been dropped in the above cut construction .",
    "note that terms containing such factors are necessarily suppressed by a power of @xmath34 .",
    "however , this suppression may be cancelled if the integrals contain poles in @xmath34 .",
    "the @xmath84 amplitudes are , however , special .",
    "we may use the fact that the algebra associated with the two - particle cuts is identical at one and two loops . as discussed in section  [ twoloopcutsection ] ,",
    "the one - loop amplitudes ( [ oneloopnfour ] ) are valid in any dimension when expressed in terms of formal polarizations and spinors .",
    "since the one - loop amplitudes are proportional to @xmath35 , the two - loop sewing procedure for the two - particle cuts using formal spinors and polarizations reproduces the one - loop result , except for the prefactors and the two - loop scalar integral function .",
    "this implies that all feynman diagrams with two - particle cuts have been accounted for exactly .",
    "this , of course , does not rule out errors of the type in from diagrams with no two - particle cuts .",
    "two examples of such diagrams are given in .",
    "here we may appeal to the superspace power counting rule that requires the extraction of a power of external momentum for each external leg of a superspace feynman diagram @xcite . after extracting four powers of external momenta ,",
    "four - point diagrams with no two - particle cuts can not contain any powers of @xmath85 in the numerators of their integrands since there are no remaining powers of loop momenta in the non - vanishing diagrams .",
    "this means that there are no potential errors of the type in arising from three - particle cuts . a more complete discussion of the @xmath85 terms , especially for theories with less supersymmetries ,",
    "will be presented in the future .    -.7",
    "cm    -.75 cm",
    "following the same cut construction procedure used for the two - loop amplitudes , we have found a pattern for the @xmath8-loop @xmath84 four - gluon leading color partial amplitudes .",
    "the three - loop leading color partial amplitude is given in .",
    "note that there are one - loop pentagon sub - diagrams .",
    "this complicates the analysis of the three - particle cuts since one - loop pentagons can be reduced to sums over box integrals @xcite . in some cuts",
    "it is the box integrals that appear and in some it is the pentagon ; this must be disentangled in order to identify the form appearing in .    -.7 cm    -.75 cm    observing the results for the leading color one- , two- and three - loop @xmath0 amplitudes one can recognize a pattern which can be used to construct the @xmath86-loop amplitude from the @xmath8-loop result .",
    "the pattern is that one takes each @xmath8-loop graph in the @xmath8-loop amplitude and generates all the possible @xmath86-loop graphs by inserting a new leg between each possible pair of internal legs .",
    "diagrams where triangle or bubble subgraphs are created should not be included .",
    "the new loop momentum including an additional factor of @xmath87 in the numerator is integrated over , where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the momenta flowing through each of the legs to which the new line is joined .",
    "( this is depicted in ) .",
    "momentum conservation ensures that it does not matter on which side of the new line the momentum pair @xmath52 and @xmath53 are taken .",
    "note that no four - point vertices are created by this procedure .",
    "each distinct @xmath86-loop graph should be counted once , even though they can be generated in multiple ways .",
    "the @xmath86-loop amplitude is then the sum of all distinct @xmath86-loop graphs .    -.7 cm",
    "-.75 cm    we have verified that this pattern is consistent with two - particle cuts to all loop orders and with four - dimensional three particle cuts , up to five loops .",
    "the two - particle cuts are not difficult to check because the same algebra appears at any loop order .",
    "it is , however , possible that there are further terms in the amplitudes . in order to show that nothing has been missed",
    ", one would need to demonstrate that higher order in @xmath34 terms in lower - loop amplitudes do not cause errors through @xmath61 .",
    "one would also need to verify the consistency of higher - particle cuts .",
    "presumably , a similar pattern can be found for subleading in color contributions .",
    "in this letter we have made an initial step in applying the one - loop cut construction technique @xcite reviewed in ref .",
    "@xcite to two - loop amplitudes . as an explicit example we computed the two - loop @xmath0 supersymmetric four - gluon amplitudes in terms of a basic set of scalar integrals .",
    "( the amplitudes with two fermions or scalars and two gluons trivially follow from a supersymmetry identity @xcite . )",
    "we also presented a pattern for the leading - color @xmath84 four - gluon amplitudes to all loop orders consistent with two - particle cuts .",
    "for the two - loop @xmath84 amplitudes presented in this letter , we showed that the cut construction yields the complete amplitude without any rational function or subtraction ambiguities .",
    "this argument was based on the fact that the one - loop four - point amplitudes are known in any dimension and that the amplitudes satisfy a power counting criterion related to the finiteness of the theory .",
    "a next step , along the lines of this letter , would be to obtain amplitudes in @xmath88 supersymmetric theories as a precursor to computing qcd amplitudes .",
    "however , before two - loop amplitudes can be used in phenomenological studies , one would need a numerically stable method for evaluating the basic integral functions that occur @xcite .",
