    "there is an extensive literature on the development and the use of high - energy electron - induced knockout of both one or two nucleons from the ground states of stable nuclei as probes of nucleonic correlations and of pair correlations .",
    "relevant and recent reviews include references @xcite , which cite the essential experimental developments and data sets : see also the citations in @xcite .",
    "quite recently , new conclusions have been drawn regarding the observation of enhanced short - ranged correlations ( src ) between nucleon - nucleon pairs from @xmath3 experiments on a carbon target @xcite .",
    "specifically , measurements that selected high momentum transfer and large missing momentum events from the few - body final - state phase - space found evidence that @xmath2 pairs were more than an order of magnitude more prevalent than like - nucleon pairs in this selection ; deduced from the corresponding @xmath4 and @xmath5 yields .",
    "the probabilities of these high relative momentum two - nucleon components have been computed , using the microscopic ground - state wave functions from _ ab - initio _ variational monte carlo calculations , for systems with masses @xmath6 @xcite and , using a linked cluster expansion , for @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "these computations involve the wave functions of the nucleons over the entire volume of the nuclei concerned .",
    "these theoretical studies are strongly suggestive that the tensor force , in the spin @xmath8 , isospin @xmath9 , @xmath2 channel , plays the major role in generating these enhanced @xmath2-spatial correlations and their associated high - relative - momenta signatures in the two - nucleon density distribution . in such @xmath3 measurements , the specific final - state phase space selection ( of high relative momentum back - to - back two - nucleon events )",
    "provides the leverage and the amplification of the short - ranged pair - correlation sensitivity .    the behavior of the wave functions of single nucleons and of pairs of nucleons ( in a mass @xmath10 projectile ) can also be probed if the nucleons are removed ( suddenly ) in fast collisions with a light target nucleus . within this strong - interaction probe case ,",
    "the sensitivity is now to the nuclear wave functions at and near the nuclear surface .",
    "such processes are also referred to as one- and two - nucleon knockout ( or removal ) reactions .",
    "these direct reaction mechanisms , combined with @xmath11-decay spectroscopy , to determine the final state of the reaction residues , and their momentum distributions , are being actively exploited as a spectroscopic tool to study the evolution of nucleonic single - particle structure near the two ( often very displaced ) fermi surfaces of exotic nuclei .",
    "they are proving to be robust techniques , see e.g. @xcite .    unlike the final - state - exclusive measurements in electron induced reactions , observables in such nuclear - induced fast nucleon removal reactions are inclusive with respect to the final states of the removed nucleon(s ) and of the fate of the struck light target nucleus .",
    "the cross sections are thus relatively large . measurements usually consist of the total removal reaction yield , often the momenta of the fast , forward travelling projectile - like residues , and sometimes the differential yields to the ground and bound excited states of the mass @xmath12 or mass @xmath13 residual nuclei ; the latter obtained by @xmath11-ray spectroscopy .",
    "however , in such collisions between the projectile and a light composite target nucleus , such as beryllium or carbon , the reaction is _ geometrically _ very selective @xcite , and the removal of two nucleons will be enhanced if nucleon pairs have a strong spatial correlation ( and localization ) in the projectile ground state .",
    "an interesting question therefore is whether like and unlike two - nucleon removal under such conditions also exhibits any evidence of enhanced @xmath2 over @xmath14 and @xmath15 spatial correlations on a longer length scale than implied by the ( src ) observations of the electron knockout data ? here , the spatial ( geometrical ) selectivity of the reaction mechanism would provide the leverage and probe of the presence of spatially localized pairs and evidence of an enhanced @xmath2 correlation .",
    "experimental data are available in the form of high - energy , primary beam measurements of the inclusive cross sections to the bound states of the residues after @xmath2 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 removal @xcite .",
    "we will show that these data reveal a significant enhancement of unlike - pair yields , @xmath16 , relative to those , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , for like - nucleon pairs , the enhancement being significantly greater than would be expected ( trivially ) from the numbers of such pair combinations available .",
    "the removal of two ( well - bound ) nucleons of the deficient species from asymmetric nuclei has been shown to proceed as a direct reaction @xcite . a description of the reaction making use of configuration - mixed shell - model wave functions and elastic and inelastic breakup contributions to the removal cross section has been shown to reproduce experiment @xcite .",
    "such calculations have also recently been extended to describe the reaction - residue momentum distributions @xcite , where it was shown that the shapes and widths of the residue momentum distributions are indicative of both the total angular momentum ( @xmath19 ) and the total orbital angular momentum components @xmath20 ) of the removed nucleon pair @xcite .    here",
    "we will exploit the eikonal reaction model in the isospin formalism @xcite for the removal of like ( @xmath21 ) and unlike ( @xmath22 ) nucleon pairs .",
    "we also discuss the possible role of indirect population of the residue final states of interest , i.e. by single - nucleon knockout paths that populate particle - unbound states of the intermediate mass @xmath13 + 1 system .",
    "such indirect paths severely limit the number of systems that , in the absence of an empirical means to distinguish between direct and indirect knockout events , may be studied quantitatively with unlike pair knockout .",
    "these indirect contributions to final state yields are expected , in general , to be large in @xmath2 removal from asymmetric systems @xcite where one or other of the nucleon thresholds will be at relatively low excitation energy .",
    "attractive @xmath2-removal test cases thus suggest symmetric light nuclei , e.g. or . for such less - massive cases one must however consider core - recoil effects in the reaction and the analogous center - of - mass corrections to the ( fixed center ) shell - model two - nucleon amplitudes .",
    "both are expected to affect , in detail , the absolute magnitudes of the cross sections .",
    "these are discussed here .",
    "regardless of these two ( relatively small ) effects , comparisons of the relative like- and unlike - pair knockout yields may be made .    in section",
    "[ sec : carbon ] we outline the specific features of the reactions using @xmath0c projectiles .",
    "the necessary formalism has been presented elsewhere and will only be outlined in section [ sec : formalism ] , exploiting the notation used in previous work .",
    "the calculated results for are discussed in section [ sec : results ] and a summary made in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "our current expectation is that a quantitative discussion of pair - correlation effects can only be made when the residue final states are populated predominantly via a single - step direct reaction .",
    "it is thus vital to select examples that minimize the indirect ( evaporative ) contributions to the reaction yield : and that we assume can not ( at present ) be distinguished from the direct reactions of interest .",
    "we must therefore consider systems with large ( and symmetric ) nucleon separation thresholds , such that the single - nucleon removal strength to particle - unbound states will be weak .",
    "for the same reason , we require the projectile nucleus to be relatively light to minimize population of the ( bound ) final residue states via the removal of deeply bound ( non - valence ) nucleons .",
    "ideally , any experiment would also measure single - nucleon and like - pair removal in addition to the unlike pair removal , in order to verify shell- and reaction - model predictions for the distribution of single - nucleon spectroscopic strength and for the direct @xmath21 pair knockout .",
    "the above considerations severely constrain the potential candidates , the best examples being and .",
    "the former of these will be considered in detail here .",
    "the choice of an @xmath23 projectile poses the additional ( experimental ) complication of distinguishing the mass @xmath13 residue from the incident beam , the residue and projectile having identical mass - to - charge ratios .",
    "consideration of two - nucleon knockout from @xmath0c is valuable for two reasons .",
    "first , its shell model description and that of the residual nuclei @xmath1c , @xmath1be and @xmath1b are extensively studied and so establish a valuable point of reference .",
    "second , the existing experimental cross sections for two - nucleon knockout from @xmath0c @xcite are accurate to @xmath24 10% and were taken at high energies , where the eikonal model used here is at its most reliable .",
    "the experimental data were obtained using reactions of a carbon beam on a carbon target at 250 , 1050 and 2100 mev per nucleon incident energies .",
    "these show an expected enhancement of the @xmath1b production cross sections ( @xmath2 removal ) over those for the @xmath14 ( to @xmath1c ) and @xmath15 ( to @xmath1be ) removal reactions ( see table [ 12c ] ) .",
    "the significance of this observed enhancement is quantified here .",
    "in addition to two - nucleon removal , single - nucleon removal cross sections were also measured at high energy ( and previously studied theoretically , see ref .",
    "these verify the expectation , from the shell - model , that the majority of single - particle removal strength is exhausted in transitions to final states lying below the nucleon separation thresholds of @xmath25c and @xmath25b .",
    "this point will be developed further in later sections .",

    "fig : c12_seps ] ]    the simplest of the three two - nucleon removal cases is two - neutron ( @xmath14 ) removal , leading to the @xmath1c residual nucleus .",
    "this has only two bound final states below the first proton threshold , the 0@xmath30 ground state and a 2@xmath30 excited state at 3.354 mev @xcite .",
    "the level scheme of @xmath1be , the residual nucleus in the @xmath15 removal case , is only slightly more complex .",
    "we must consider population of the 0@xmath30 ground state , the 2@xmath30 states at 3.368 and 5.958 mev , and a second 0@xmath30 state at 6.179 mev , all below the neutron threshold of 6.812 mev .",
    "the most complicated final state is that for @xmath1b , the @xmath2 knockout residue . the @xmath31-shell",
    "shell - model calculations used include even - parity states up to a maximum of spin 3 .",
    "for we have shown states up to the proton separation threshold , however the low @xmath26-particle separation threshold means that the @xmath9 states at 4.774 ( 3@xmath30 ) , 5.180 ( 1@xmath30 ) and 5.920 mev ( 2@xmath30 ) are reported to decay ( with branching ratios of near 100% ) by @xmath26-emission .",
    "we will show the cross sections for population of these states but will assume that they do not contribute to the calculated yield .",

    "the cross sections to a given final state , being proportional to the square of these tna , suggest unlike : like two - nucleon inclusive cross section ratios @xmath38 if all strength leads to bound final states . the same result is obtained from the counting of available valence - nucleon pairs .",
    "the primary motivation for the present study is that this simple combinatorics expectation is not corroborated by the available data ; the ratio @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) from the experiments at 250 , 1050 and 2100 mev / nucleon are 8.1 ( 8.9 ) , 5.3 ( 6.3 ) and 6.0 ( 8.5 ) , respectively @xcite , the observed enhancement of the @xmath2 removal cross section being significantly larger than expected .",
    "clearly our simple estimate , from the number of available pairs of each type , assumes that all of the removal strength leads to bound configurations in the residue of interest , which is not the case , and part of the enhancement noted above may be attributable to this ( channel - dependent ) fraction of events leading to particle - unbound states .",
    "here we seek to address this question quantitatively , by use of a direct reaction model for two - nucleon removal .",
    "specifically , our aims are to quantify : ( i ) whether this enhancement is accounted for by those two - nucleon correlations that are included in the truncated , @xmath31-space shell model calculation , and ( ii ) to make a simple estimate of the contributions one might reasonably expect from indirect reaction pathways in this model picture .",

    "<S> reactions that involve the direct and sudden removal of a pair of like or unlike nucleons from a fast projectile beam by a light target nucleus are considered . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we study the three two - nucleon removal channels from @xmath0c that populate final states in the @xmath1be , @xmath1b and @xmath1c reaction residues . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated two - nucleon removal cross sections and the residue momentum distributions are compared with available high energy data at 250 , 1050 and 2010 mev per nucleon , data that are inclusive with respect to the bound final - states of the residues . </S>",
    "<S> the measured @xmath2-removal cross sections only are significantly greater than the values calculated , suggesting that the reaction mechanism observes enhanced @xmath2 spatial correlations compared to those present in the shell - model wave functions . </S>"
