    "gr is a classical field theory for 10 independent variables  the components of metric tensor @xmath0 .",
    "it is well known , however , that some problems inside and beyond einstein s gravity require a richer set of 16 independent variables  the components of the coframe ( aka reper , vierbein , ... ) . in the following issues of gravity ,",
    "the coframe is not only a useful tool but often can not even be replaced by the standard metric variable :    * hamiltonian formulation @xcite,@xcite ; * positive energy proofs @xcite ; * fermions on a curved manifold @xcite,@xcite ; * supergravity @xcite ; * loop quantum gravity @xcite , @xcite .",
    "absolute ( teleparallel ) frame / coframe variables were introduced in physics by einstein in 1928 with an aim of a unification of gravitational and electromagnetic fields ( for classical references , see @xcite ) . in gr description ,",
    "the additional six degrees of freedom do not have a physical sense and treated as a type of a gauge symmetry of the metric tensor .",
    "it was already noticed by einstein , that 16 reper components can not be completely equivalent to 10 components of the metric tensor .",
    "indeed , the supergravity and the loop quantum gravity models apparently can be formulated only in term of vierbein .",
    "so , it is natural to study which geometric structure can be constructed from the vierbein ( frame / coframe ) variables and which field models can be related to this geometry .",
    "this is a subject of the current paper .    the frame field @xmath1 and its dual , the coframe field @xmath2 , have a well defined geometrical sense .",
    "in particular , even been considered as independent physical fields , they provide a special ( absolute ) reference basis . for the bases , @xmath3 , fixed at a point , the construction gives an invariant meaning to the components of a tensor , thus it emerges in violation of the rotational and lorentz invariance @xcite .",
    "however , when the _ global _ ( rigid ) lorentz transformations of the absolute basis fields are acceptable , the frame components of a tensor are transformed merely by the lorentz transformation law .",
    "thus , some interrelation between the lorentz invariant field theories and the diffeomorphism invariant gravity emerges .",
    "when the absolute basis field is restricted to a point , the lorentz invariance requires to consider it not alone but as a member of a class of equivalent bases .",
    "the equivalence relation for this class is provided by a group @xmath4 of transformations @xmath5 , which has to include local physics symmetries , i.e. , the rotations and the boosts .",
    "when we are dealing with the absolute basis fields on a manifold , the relation between the frames at different points is not governed by the constrains of local physics .",
    "consequently , three principally different possibilities are open :    \\(i ) _ riemannian geometry . _ the frames at distinct points",
    "are not related to one another at all , i.e. the dependence of the elements of the group @xmath4 on a point is absolutely arbitrary .",
    "it is possible only if the corresponding geometry , i.e the metric and the connection , respect the arbitrary transformations of the frame field .",
    "the unique connections with this property is the _ levi - civita connection _ of riemannian geometry .",
    "this case is realized in the standard gr when it is formulated in an arbitrary non - holonomic frame .",
    "the frame / coframe fields are not physical in this case and only play a role of a useful reference tool .",
    "they can be replaced even by holonomic bases generated by local coordinates .",
    "\\(ii ) _ teleparallel geometry . _",
    "another limiting case emerges when the frames in distinct points are strongly connected to one another .",
    "it means that when a frame in an arbitrary point is rotated in a certain angle , the frames at distant points immediately rotated in the same angle .",
    "the unique connection with this property is the flat _ weitzenbck connection . _",
    "although the scalar curvature is zero for such a connection , the action functional can be constructed from the torsion tensor .",
    "it is natural to require this action functional to be invariant only under global transformations of the basis field .",
    "the analysis of this model shows that it has not spherical symmetric solutions with newtonian behavior at infinity . as a result , this absolute teleparallel gravity model is not physical .",
    "\\(iii ) _ gauge geometry . _ besides the two limiting cases given above , there is a family of geometries with the field of frame rotations satisfying some system of differential equations .",
    "the basic geometrical quantities , metric and connection , have to be invariant under local transformations of the frame field satisfied these equations . in this construction",
    ", the frame field does not emerge explicitly , so we will refer to the corresponding geometrical structure as a _ gauge coframe geometry_.    in alternative gravity models ( see @xcite  @xcite and the reference given therein ) , the frame variable appears as an independent physical field . in the first order approximation @xcite , the coframe field",
    "is separated to a sum of two independent fields - a metric field and an antisymmetric field of the rang two .",
    "the same separation emerges in the lagrangian , in the field equation and also in the energy - momentum tensor . in the current paper",
    "we show that a geometrical and physical interpretation of the antisymmetric part can be prolongated in the higher order approximations .",
    "our main result is : in the viable coframe models , alternative to gr , the additional degrees of freedom can be interpreted as a new dynamical field which behavior in the first order approximation is described by the vacuum maxwell - type system .      the aim of this paper is to derive the mentioned coframe gauge geometrical structure and its possible applications to classical fields .",
    "the paper is organized as followed .    in section 2",
    ", we construct a most general class of connections which are linear in the first order derivatives of the coframe field .",
    "this six - parametric family involves the levi - civita and the weitzenbck connections as special limiting cases .",
    "we also identify the sub - families of torsion - free and metric compatible connections .    in section 3 , the behavior of the coframe connections under local @xmath6 transformations of the coframe is considered .",
    "besides the levi - civita and the weitzenbck connections , we identify a sub - family of gauge invariant connections .",
    "the corresponding constraints compose a system of 8 first order partial differential equation for six independent entries of a @xmath6 matrix .",
    "this situation is very similar to the standard maxwell system of eight field equations for six independent components of the electromagnetic field .    in section 4",
    ", we derive the same system of constrains from a different ( physical ) point of view .",
    "we require a most general quadratic coframe lagrangian to be invariant under @xmath6 transformations of the coframe .",
    "the gauge invariant lagrangians turn out to be in a correspondence with the known viable coframe models having the schwarzschild solution .    in section 5 ,",
    "we study the first order approximation to the system of the constrains . on a flat manifold ,",
    "this system coincides with the vacuum maxwell equations . on a curved manifold",
    ", it turns out to be a system of covariant maxwell - type equations when the covariant derivatives are considered relative to the weitzenbck connections .    in section 6",
    ", we derive an exact spherical symmetric solution to our system of constrains .",
    "we also compare our model with the standard description of interaction between gravitational and electromagnetic fields .",
    "in contrast to the standard einstein - maxwell system , our model predicts mass dependence in the coulomb - type law .",
    "we derive the exact expression of the corresponding correction term .    in section 7",
    ", we give an outlook of the proposed alternative model and discuss how ( and if ) the additional degrees of freedom can be related to the ordinary electromagnetic field .",
    "we use the greek indices @xmath7 to identify the specific vector fields of the frame @xmath1 and the specific 1-forms of the coframe @xmath2 .",
    "the roman indices @xmath8 refer to local coordinates .",
    "summation from 0 to 3 is understood over repeated indices of both types ( einstein s summation convention ) .",
    "two types of indices and basically different . in particular , they can not be summed ( contracted ) in the expressions @xmath9 or @xmath10 .",
    "the lorentz metric is used with the sign agreement @xmath11 .",
    "the spatial indices are denoted as @xmath12 .",
    "we denote the coefficients of connection as @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "such notation is useful for the exterior form representation . in order to go back to the ordinary tensorial notations @xmath15 ,",
    "it is enough to move the last index to the first position .    the symmetrization and antisymmetrization operators are used in the normalized form , i.e. , @xmath16 and @xmath17}= ( 1/{p!})(a_{i_1\\cdots i_p}-   \\cdots)$ ]",
    "let a @xmath18-manifold be endowed with a frame field @xmath1 and a coframe field @xmath2 .",
    "all the structures are assumed to be smooth almost everywhere . in local",
    "coordinates @xmath19 , the fields are expressed respectively as @xmath20 i.e. , by two @xmath21 matrices @xmath22 and @xmath23 of smooth functions .",
    "these two basis fields are assumed to be reciprocal to each other : @xmath24so , in fact , only one field , @xmath1 or @xmath2 , is an independent variable .",
    "we prefer to use the coframe field @xmath2 as a basis variable since it is suitable for a compact exterior form representation .    for a rigidly fixed coframe field ,",
    "the components of an arbitrary tensor obtain an invariant sense when referred to the special bases @xmath25 .",
    "it emerges in hard violation of lorentz invariance .",
    "thus , in order to have a lorentz invariant field model , the coframe field has to be defined only up to global lorentz transformations .",
    "the gauge paradigm requires to localize the global transformations , so we define a _ coframe structure _ as a triplet @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a smooth manifold , @xmath2 is a smooth coframe field on @xmath27 , and @xmath28 is a local ( pointwise ) group of transformations @xmath29 .",
    "although the coframe variable itself is a pure geometrical object , it is not clear what geometry is generated by the structure ( [ str1 ] ) for different groups @xmath4 .",
    "we accept the cartan viewpoint that treats a geometrical structure as a pair of two independent objects : a metric tensor @xmath30 and an asymmetric connection field @xmath31 .",
    "for the specific coframe structure ( [ str1 ] ) , we require both fields to be explicitly constructed from the coframe components . in other words ,",
    "we specify ( [ str1 ] ) to @xmath32 in correspondence to local physics , the metric tensor has to be defined as @xmath33 or , in components , @xmath34here @xmath35 is the lorentzian metric in the tangential vector space .",
    "indeed , in a small neighborhood of a point , the coframe field is approximately holonomic @xmath36 , so ( [ metr1 ] ) is locally approximated by lorentzian metric , see @xcite .",
    "due to the index content , ( [ metr ] ) is a unique construction up to a constant scalar factor .",
    "this factor can be neglected by rescaling the coframe field ( recall that the global @xmath37-transformations of the structure are admissible ) .",
    "hence ( [ metr ] ) is a unique construction of the metric tensor from the coframe components when the conformation with the local lorentz metric is required .",
    "this definition restricts the freedom of the coframe transformation to local pseudo - rotations , i.e. , at every point @xmath38 .",
    "the entries of this @xmath6-matrix remain arbitrary functions of a point .",
    "let a manifold be endowed with a field of asymmetric cartan connections .",
    "relative to a local coordinate chart @xmath19 , every connection is represented by a set of @xmath39 independent functions @xmath40  the coefficients of the connection .",
    "the only condition the functions @xmath40 have to satisfy is to transform , under a change of coordinates @xmath41 , by an inhomogeneous linear rule : @xmath42 where the derivatives are denoted as @xmath43 and @xmath44 .    for the coframe connections , we require @xmath13 and @xmath45 to be explicitly constructed from the coframe components and their derivatives .",
    "moreover , we require @xmath13 to be linear in @xmath46  linear connection .",
    "this requirement is in parallel to the standard construction of riemannian geometry .",
    "indeed , the levi - civita connection can be treated as a unique linear connection which can be constructed from the first order derivatives of the metric components @xmath47 .",
    "two examples of the coframe connection satisfied the requirement above are well known :    \\(i ) the weitzenbck connection is defined as @xmath48 it is straightforward to check the transformation rule ( [ cc1 ] ) for this expression .",
    "the riemann curvature of this connection is identically zero , so the connection is flat .",

    "\\(ii ) the levi - civita connection of riemannian geometry , @xmath50 can be rewritten as a linear combination of the first order derivatives of the coframe components .",

    "geometrically , a non - trivial non - metricity tensor means change of the lengths and angles when a parallel transport of vectors over a closed curve is applied .",
    "such violation of rotational and lorentz invariance bring us rather far from the standard physical paradigm .",
    "so , from the physical point of view , the metric - compatible constrains ( [ m - comp ] ) are better motivated then the torsion - free constrains ( [ tor - free ] ) .",
    "when the requirements ( [ tor - free],[m - comp ] ) are considered together , we come to a unique torsion - free and metric - compatible coframe connection given by the parameters @xmath77 certainly , it is no more than the ordinary levi - civita connection ( [ lc - con ] ) .",

    "a coordinate basis , the coframe components change under ( [ l - tr0 ] ) as @xmath89 in this paper , we will deal only with the infinitesimal version of the transformations ( [ l - tr0 ] ) .",
