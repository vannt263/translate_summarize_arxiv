    "the discovery of the higgs boson with wonderful precision of its mass is one of the biggest discoveries for the particle physics in this decade .",
    "the standard model ( sm ) of the particle physics has been finally completed by this .",
    "however , we should wonder that whether the higgs boson is the last ingredient of the particle physics .",
    "the answer is obviously no .",
    "there are many problems to answer from the viewpoint of observations .",
    "one of them is the origin of inflation .",
    "higgs inflation is one of attractive scenarios for the answer .",
    "if this scenario is true , the particle contents might become minimal .",
    "however , when we assume that a model explain the inflation within sm particles , it is well known that the top mass should be slightly smaller than the observational one and non - minimal coupling to the gravity should be quite large @xcite . on the other hand , the ref .",
    "@xcite points out that an extended model by scalar dark matter ( dm ) and right - handed neutrinos can explain required values for the e - foldings , scalar spectral index , and sizable tensor - to - scalar ratio with the higgs and top masses which are consistent with the experimental values .    in this work ,",
    "we reanalyze the possibility of the higgs inflation in the extended sm by the right - handed neutrinos and the scalar dm . by solving the renormalization group equations ( rges ) at 2-loop level for the quantum corrections to the coupling constants ( @xmath1-functions ) .",
    "in this work , we consider the extended sm by a real singlet scalar and the right - handed neutrinos .",
    "the lagrangians can be written as @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the sm lagrangian in which the higgs potential is contained as shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq : higgs ] ) .",
    "@xmath4 is the higgs doublet field and @xmath5 is its vacuum expectation value .",
    "@xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the lepton doublet , a sm gauge singlet real scalar and the right - handed neutrino fields , respectively .",
    "the coupling constants @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the portal coupling of @xmath4 and @xmath7 , the quartic self - coupling of @xmath7 , and the neutrino yukawa coupling constant .",
    "@xmath12 denotes the right - handed neutrino mass .",
    "we assume that the singlet scalar has odd parity under an additional @xmath13 symmetry .",
    "hence , we can have a candidate for dm when the mass and the portal coupling @xmath9 of @xmath7 are taken to be appropriate values .",
    "the observed tiny neutrino masses can be obtained by the conventional type - i seesaw mechanism .",
    "the heaviest right - handed neutrino with the mass @xmath12 generates one active neutrino mass .",
    "others can be obtained by lighter right - handed neutrinos with the smaller yukawa coupling . when the neutrino yukawa couplings are smaller than the bottom yukawa coupling , the contributions from the neutrino yukawa couplings to the @xmath1-functions are negligible . in this work ,",
    "we consider a case that the neutrino yukawa coupling of only one generation of the right - handed neutrino is effective to the @xmath1-functions .",
    "we have fixed the active neutrino mass as @xmath14 ev here and hereafter .",
    "the rges are solved from z boson mass scale , @xmath15 , to the planck scale , @xmath16 . in this analysis",
    ", we divide the energy region into three parts in this region .",
    "the each part can be considered as @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 .",
    "the behavior of @xmath20 can be roughly supposed as follows : at first , the evolution of @xmath9 becomes small as @xmath21 becomes small , because the @xmath1-function for @xmath9 is proportional to @xmath9 itself . in this case",
    ", the evolution of @xmath22 is really close to the sm one .",
    "second , the contribution from the additional scalar pushes up the evolution of @xmath20 .",
    "thus , we can make @xmath20 to be positive up to @xmath23 with sufficient magnitude of the additional scalar contribution . on the other hand ,",
    "the contribution from the right - haded neutrinos pulls down @xmath20 in the region of @xmath19 .        a behavior of the running of the higgs quartic coupling is shown in fig.[fig : running ] .",
    "as a result , we can have a suitable higgs potential with a plateau for the inflation around @xmath24  @xcite .",
    "these are the important features for the higgs inflation with the real scalar field and the right - handed neutrinos . just as a sample point . ] in our estimation , the free parameters are the values of right - handed neutrino and dm masses and non - minimal coupling @xmath25 .",
    "at first , we briefly review the ordinary higgs inflation @xcite with the action in the so - called jordan frame , @xmath26 where @xmath25 is the non - minimal coupling of the higgs to the ricci scalar @xmath27 , @xmath28 is given in the unitary gauge , and @xmath3 includes the higgs potential of eq .",
    "( [ eq : higgs ] ) . with the conformal transformation ( @xmath29 with @xmath30 ) which denotes the transformation from the jordan frame to the einstein one",
    ", one can rewrite the action as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the ricci scalar in the einstein frame given by @xmath33 , and @xmath34 is a canonically renormalized field as @xmath35 one can calculate the slow - roll parameters as @xmath36 where @xmath37 is obtained - functions of coupling constants including the self - coupling of the higgs up to 2-loop level .",
    "this means that our analysis also contains quantum effects , which partially include effects from loop level potential . ] as @xmath38 using slow - roll parameters , the spectral index and the tensor - to - scalar ratio are evaluated as @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively .",
    "finally , the number of e - foldings is given by @xmath41 where @xmath42 @xmath43 is the initial ( final ) value of @xmath44 corresponding to the beginning ( end ) of the inflation .",
    "the end point @xmath45 is defined as the slow - roll conditions @xmath46 are broken .",
    "the higgs inflation can be realized even in the sm if the top mass is fine - tuned as @xmath47 for @xmath48  @xcite . with these values ,",
    "the higgs potential have a plateau and @xmath49 can be achieved by taking @xmath50  @xcite .",
    "even though this framework can accomplish a relevant amount of e - foldings , the required top mass , @xmath51 , is out of @xmath52 @xcite . on the other hand , without the plateau ,",
    "the enough amount of e - foldings can be obtained by assuming @xmath53 . however",
    ", this case is plagued with too tiny tensor - to - scalar ratio as order of @xmath54 which is inconsistent with the result of bicep2  @xcite on the other hand , the joint analysis of bicep , keck array , and planck concludes that this signal can be explained by the dust  @xcite .",
    "however , this setup is still attractive in phenomenological points of view .",
    "furthermore , we will show that the main results do not change so much even if we take the tensor - to - scalar ratio as @xmath55 which is the center value reported in ref .",
    "consequently , we extend the sm with a real scalar and right - handed neutrinos , in which an evolution of @xmath56 ( equivalent to the higgs potential ) is changed , in order to reproduce the values of cosmological parameters within the experimental range @xmath57 .",
    "in this section , we give results of our numerical analysis .",
    "we solve rges . ] at 2-loop level for the @xmath1-functions of the relevant couplings in the model . as we discussed above , we analyze within the experimental ranges of the higgs mass @xmath58 @xcite and the top mass @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "the detail of the 2-loop @xmath1-functions    as we mentioned in the section ii , we assume that the additional real scalar is dm . in the case that the dm mass is greater than the higgs mass ( @xmath59 ) , the portal coupling @xmath21 is well approximated as @xcite , @xmath60 where @xmath61 denotes the mass of dm given by @xmath62 .",
    "our results are shown in fig.[fig : mr_ms ] .",
    "one can see that required values of @xmath12 , @xmath61 , and @xmath25 for reproducing suitable cosmological parameters are on a line in @xmath12-@xmath61 plane .",
    "this is because the form of the higgs potential is strictly constrained and it should be uniquely realized by taking suitable values of @xmath12 , @xmath61 , and @xmath25 for given @xmath63 and @xmath57",
    ". a lighter ( heavier ) top ( higgs ) mass gives lower bounds on @xmath12 , @xmath61 , and @xmath25 while a heavier ( lighter ) top ( higgs ) mass leads to upper bounds on those parameters .",
    "we have investigated the higgs inflation model with the higgs portal dm and the right - handed neutrinos by the use of the @xmath1-functions up to 2-loop level .",
    "in addition , the latest experimental errors of the top and higgs masses have been taken into account in the calculations . as a result , we pointed out that this inflation model can explain the results of cosmological observations @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 within regions of @xmath67 of the dm mass , @xmath68 of the right - handed neutrino mass , and @xmath69 of the non - minimal higgs coupling to the ricci scalar with @xmath70 of the higgs and @xmath71 of the top masses .",
    "furthermore , we have shown that the scale of right - handed neutrino and dm are not significantly changed even though the tensor - to - scalar ratio decreases as @xmath72 . on the other hand , the non - minimal coupling should be slightly larger than the @xmath73 case as @xmath74 .",
    "there is a strong correlation between the dm and the right - handed neutrino masses because the form of the higgs potential is strictly constrained and it should be uniquely realized by taking suitable values of @xmath12 , @xmath61 , and @xmath25 for given @xmath63 and @xmath57 .",
    "the dm mass region in our analysis will be confirmed by the future dm detections .",
