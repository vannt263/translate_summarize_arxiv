    "<S> in the simplest model of open inflation there are two inflaton fields decoupled from each other </S>",
    "<S> . one of them , the tunneling field , produces a first stage of inflation which prepares the ground for the nucleation of a highly symmetric bubble . the other , a free field , drives a second period of slow roll inflation inside the bubble </S>",
    "<S> however , the second field also evolves during the first stage of inflation , which to some extent breaks the needed symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this generates large supercurvature anisotropies which , together with the results of tanaka and sasaki , rule out this class of simple models ( unless , of course , @xmath0 is sufficiently close to one . ) </S>",
    "<S> the problem does not arise in modified models where the second field does not evolve in the first stage of inflation .    </S>",

    "<S> open inflation has recently received some attention as a viable model for the early universe @xcite@xcite . the first version of the open universe model was based on the theory of one scalar field @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , no realistic models of that type have been proposed so far . </S>",
    "<S> then linde and mezhlumian proposed a class of models involving two scalar fields @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the simplest model discussed in @xcite describes a tunneling field @xmath5 , responsible for bubble nucleation , and a free field @xmath6 of mass @xmath7 that undergoes slow rollover . </S>",
    "<S> the two fields are decoupled from each other , except of course gravitationally . </S>",
    "<S> when the field @xmath5 is in its false vacuum , it dominates the energy density and the universe is in a de sitter phase with constant hubble rate @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the true vacuum of the the field @xmath5 has vanishing energy density , and when a bubble nucleates , the slowly rolling field @xmath6 drives a second period of inflation in its interior , with hubble rate @xmath9 .    in order for this model to work , </S>",
    "<S> the field @xmath6 has to evolve very slowly outside the bubble </S>",
    "<S> . otherwise the surfaces of constant @xmath6 would not be well synchronized with the hyperboloids of constant @xmath5 inside the bubble , and large anisotropies could be expected . </S>",
    "<S> the danger of this effect was already realised in @xcite , therefore linde and mezhlumian also suggested the possible modifications of the simplest model where synchronization was exact and no such problems appear . </S>",
    "<S> however since the simplest model looks more natural , it would still be interesting to clarify whether it is compatible with observations for some range of the parameters or not .    outside the bubble of the field </S>",
    "<S> @xmath5 , we have @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the cosmological time in the flat friedmann robertson walker ( frw ) chart , and @xmath12 is the slow - rollover parameter </S>",
    "<S> . we shall now concentrate on fluctuations which will arise because of the @xmath11 dependence of @xmath6 , so we take @xmath13 to be constant over the region of interest .    </S>",
    "<S> the true and false vacua for the field @xmath5 are strongly non - degenerate , which means we are in the thick wall regime .. for simplicity , we shall take the solution ( [ roll ] ) to be valid everywhere outside the forward light - cone from the nucleation event . </S>",
    "<S> this approximation is clearly valid if the bubble size at the moment of nucleation is small compared with @xmath14 .    inside the light - cone </S>",
    "<S> , the spacetime can be covered with the open chart @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> \\label{open}\\ ] ] the scale factor @xmath16 obeys the friedmann equation @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the density parameter and at early times @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> to propagate the solution ( [ roll ] ) to the inside of the light - cone we can use the following trick . let us assume that inside the bubble , and for @xmath20 , the universe is still de sitter , with the same hubble parameter @xmath8 . since at early times the universe is dominated by curvature , this assumption will turn out to be harmless . </S>",
    "<S> introducing in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ roll ] ) the relation between the flat and open de sitter coordinates @xmath21 , we have @xmath22 of course ( [ rollopen ] ) satisfies the field equation to first order in the slow - rollover parameter @xmath23 @xmath24 with @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> however , we should note that from the point of view of the open chart , ( [ rollopen ] ) is not a slow - rollover solution . </S>",
    "<S> the largest terms in ( [ eomphi ] ) for @xmath26 are the gradient and friction terms , which balance each other .    </S>",
    "<S> the question is now to evolve the approximate solution @xmath27 which is valid for @xmath20 , into the second period of inflation . </S>",
    "<S> since ( [ approx ] ) is not an eigenfunction of the laplacian , one might be tempted to expand it treating @xmath28 as a small quantity , given that @xmath29 can be chosen as small as desired . </S>",
    "<S> however this would not be appropriate . </S>",
    "<S> the scale factor behaves as @xmath30 up to a time @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the hubble rate at the beginning of the second period of inflation . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the comoving size of our causal past ( i.e. the region that has an influence on our observable universe ) at the time @xmath29 is @xmath33 and @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> hence the second term in the parenthesis in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ approx ] ) is not uniformly small compared to the first over a sufficiently large patch .    </S>",
    "<S> a better strategy is to study a region where the second term in ( [ approx ] ) dominates . </S>",
    "<S> note that since ( [ approx ] ) is spherically symmetric , the universe would still look isotropic around us if we lived in the privileged position @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> the most interesting effects will occur if we live at some @xmath36 . actually , since the volume grows exponentially with @xmath37 , that is where we are most likely to be found . </S>",
    "<S> taking @xmath38 , we have @xmath39 over a region of comoving size ( [ width ] ) centered around @xmath40 .    </S>",
    "<S> it is now convenient to change the coordinates @xmath41 on the spacelike hyperboloid to a new set @xmath42 such that the point @xmath43 will be the new origin of coordinates @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> one can show that @xmath45 our solution is now of the form @xmath46 where @xmath47 note that , to first order in @xmath23 , @xmath48 is an approximate eigenfunction of the laplacian ( with eigenvalue @xmath49 ) , and therefore we can factorize the time dependence in ( [ factor ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> it can be checked that between the times @xmath29 and @xmath50 the gravitational backreaction of the scalar field perturbations can be neglected , and hence all that will happen is that @xmath51 will evolve as @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> after @xmath50 slow rollover will set in and gravitational backreaction has to be taken into account . for this purpose </S>",
    "<S> , one has to separate the field into a background part @xmath53 and a perturbation @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> since the gradient terms are negligible in the slow rollover regime ( the wavelength of the perturbations we consider is much larger than the horizon ) , @xmath54 need not be an eigenfunction of the laplacian , and the decomposition into background and perturbation has some degree of arbitrariness . we choose @xmath55 and @xmath56 at the time when the slow rollover starts inside the bubble . </S>",
    "<S> the standard procedure then yields the answer that at the end of inflation the gauge invariant potential is given by @xmath57 somewhat surprisingly , the answer does not depend on @xmath58 but only on the ratio between the hubble rates inside and outside the bubble ( of course , in a slow roll model , @xmath59 indirectly depends on @xmath58 , for fixed spatial curvature . ) in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 we plot the potential @xmath60 at the surface of last scattering @xmath61 $ ] for different values of @xmath18    it remains to be seen how @xmath60 contributes to observables . </S>",
    "<S> the present hubble radius @xmath62 corresponds to the co - moving distance @xmath63^{-1}=(1-\\omega_0)^{1/2}$ ] , where the subindex zero indicates the present time , and we have used ( [ friedmann ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> if the present spatial curvature is small , then @xmath64 and @xmath65 can be expanded as @xmath66 where @xmath67 as mentioned before , @xmath65 is not an eigenfunction of the laplacian , and is not normalizable , another illustration of how non - normalizable supercurvature modes can arise in the open inflationary models .    </S>",
    "<S> the dominant contribution for small curvature is proportional to @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> the term in parentheses in equation ( [ x ] ) is a supercurvature mode with eigenvalue of the laplacian equal to + 3 , and it can actually be checked that it is pure gauge . </S>",
    "<S> it corresponds to the shift @xmath69 during the curvature dominated period . </S>",
    "<S> the constant @xmath70 in ( [ x ] ) will also not induce any anisotropies . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the first nontrivial contribution will stem from the @xmath71 term in the expansion of @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> this is proportional to @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the dominant effect will in the quadrupole . </S>",
    "<S> higher multipoles , labeled by @xmath73 , will be accompanied by @xmath74 . since @xmath75 , we have @xmath76 where @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> we have numerically checked that the above estimate works well by order of magnitude even for @xmath0 as low as @xmath78 and @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> notice that this is a classical effect , and cosmic variance can not be invoked to minimize it . </S>",
    "<S> the integrated sachs - wolfe effect is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 as a function of the polar angle @xmath80 and for different values of @xmath0 ( the monopole and dipole contributions have been subtracted . ) for low @xmath0 , the anisotropy would show up as a cold spot of small angular size .    unless the curvature of the universe is very small , the ratio @xmath81 would have to be large in order to avoid conflict with observations . for moderate curvature , we need @xmath82 , whereas for @xmath83 one can get away with a lower ratio .    </S>",
    "<S> however , tanaka and sasaki have shown that the quantum fluctuations of @xmath6 generated during the first stage of inflation induce an enhancement of the temperature anisotropies in supercurvature modes compared with the fluctuations in subcurvature modes @xcite @xmath84 comparing with equation ( [ effect ] ) the ratio of hubble constants appears reversed . if what we observe is due to quantum fluctuations generated during inflation , then @xmath85 . with @xmath82 , </S>",
    "<S> as required above for moderate curvature , the model would give rise to temperature anisotropies of order @xmath86 , which are ruled out by observations . </S>",
    "<S> of course the model can be saved if the curvature is sufficiently small , say @xmath87 .    also , as we already mentioned , there are alternative models @xcite in which the slow roll field @xmath6 does not evolve during the first stage of inflation . </S>",
    "<S> these would not be constrained by the mechanism discussed above . </S>"
