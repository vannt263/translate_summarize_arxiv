    "improvements in mass spectrometer resolution , accuracy and sensitivity coupled with the development of increasingly sophisticated algorithms for protein identification from spectra have resulted in mass spectrometry ( ms ) becoming the tool of choice in large scale proteomics research .",
    "typically , the mass spectrometer is used to measure short portions of the proteins called peptides .",
    "these are subjected to a process called tandem mass spectrometry ( ms / ms ) which ultimately yields a mass spectrum containing peaks which correspond to the primary amino acid sequence and enable the identification of peptides . when samples are labeled with itraq ( isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation ) stable isotope reagents ,",
    "the ms / ms spectra also contain peaks at predefined masses , whose intensities provide a relative measure of the peptide abundance in a set of samples .",
    "a single experiment can yield tens of thousands of spectra identifying thousands of peptides belonging to thousands of proteins .",
    "analysis of samples from different sources , for example , cells expressing different mutations in a known oncogene versus the wild - type ( e.g. , nontransforming ) counterpart can provide insight as to the mechanisms by which specific genetic lesions manifested in the same protein drive a malignant phenotype . a workflow diagram and a brief explanation of the itraq technique",
    "are given in part a of the supplemental article [ @xcite ] ; for a detailed discussion on ms techniques see @xcite .     versus @xmath1 in the march experiment .",
    "right : pointwise estimates of mean and variance and different models for the variance . ]    in an experiment conducted in march 2009 and described below , @xcite applied the itraq protocol using two different labels for the same biological sample .",
    "the experiment yielded 2174 pairs of measurements corresponding to the amounts of 2174 peptides in the sample .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ figdata ] depicts the data ( on a logarithmic scale ) and clearly shows that the variance of peak intensity measurements is nonconstant and depends on the mean .",
    "this variance should be estimated for better understanding of the results of the ms analysis and to enable statistical inference about the peptide amounts .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ figdata ] displays the mean of each pair against its variance together with several estimates of the variance function described in section  [ secmix ] .",
    "the purpose of the current paper is twofold : first , to estimate the variance function related to observations obtained by the common technique of itraq stable isotope labeling [ @xcite , @xcite ] , which provides measurements of the relative amounts of peptides from two different biological samples in a single experimental run ; and second , to construct confidence intervals for the abundance of a given peptide in a biological sample and to the ratio of two abundances under different conditions ( e.g. , cancer and wild type cells ) using the estimated variance function , and to calculate @xmath0-values for the hypothesis of equality in peptide amounts in two independent samples .",
    "models that define the variance as a function of the mean have been studied intensively in the framework of heteroscedastic regression , where different estimation techniques have been suggested [ e.g. , @xcite ] . however , in ms , the variance function depends on the unknown peptide amount and the estimation problem is much more involved .",
    "a similar problem arises in certain immunoassay studies where few or no standard concentrations are available [ @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ] , and in the evolving area of microarray mrna expression analysis [ @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ] . unlike immunoassay and microarray ,",
    "labeled ms data can contain as few as two measurements of each peptide relative quantity and , therefore , analysis requires a special experiment for estimating the variance function .    in a previous study ,",
    "@xcite suggest a novel controlled experiment for the estimation of the variance function in the itraq protocol . using the standard workflow , they held the sample constant by generating pairs of itraq intensities from identical biological samples . under this experiment",
    ", it is reasonable to assume that the itraq labels are interchangeable in their error characteristics since labeled samples are mixed before processing and , therefore , the difference within pairs of such measurements are entirely attributable to the measurement error of the instrument itself .",
    "two controlled experiments were conducted in january and march of 2009 with the sole goal of estimating the variance function [ @xcite ] .",
    "a separate experiment was conducted to explore differences observed between wild - type and cancer cells expressing distinct mutations of the same oncogenic kinase ( flt3 ) ; this experiment relied on the variance function estimated in the controlled study .",
    "the motivation for our current study arises from these past experiments , and below we describe in detail the mathematical problem , suggest statistical methods to tackle it and apply them to the three data sets mentioned above .    in section  [ secestim ]",
    "we present a naive method for estimating the variance function employed by zhang et  al . and explore its validity .",
    "we show that the method works well when the error terms are typically small , as is the case in the instrument explored by @xcite , but may yield biased estimators for the variance function in other situations .",
    "we then suggest an alternative mixture model approach for estimating the variance function and prove its consistency .",
    "in section  [ secci ] we use the estimated variance function for interval estimation of the ratio of peptides across two different biological conditions , and we apply the method to itraq - based ms analysis that is intended to decipher the oncogenic potential of two different clinically relevant mutations in the flt3 receptor tyrosine kinase . section  [ secpval ] discusses testing of the hypothesis that the amounts of peptides in two biological samples are equivalent . the properties of the estimation approaches are investigated in section  [ secsim ] by simulation .",
    "section  [ secdisc ] completes the paper with some remarks .",
    "consider a controlled itraq experiment that quantifies @xmath2 peptides .",
    "let @xmath3 denote two measures of intensity of peptide @xmath4 ( on a logarithmic scale ) having an unknown mean @xmath5 .",
    "assume that @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) are independent following the model : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a vector of unknown variance parameters , and @xmath10 is a known positive function , such as the power function @xmath11 or the exponential function @xmath12 . in problems where",
    "@xmath13 are known or are modeled by a small number of auxiliary variables , standard techniques for estimating heteroscedastic regression models apply [ e.g. , @xcite ] . however , this is not the case in ms data where @xmath13 are unknown nuisance parameters .",
    "@xcite and @xcite developed an em algorithm that maximizes over @xmath13 and @xmath9 the likelihood corresponding to @xmath2 independent observations , @xmath14 , from model  ( [ varmodel ] ) : @xmath15 however , since the number of nuisance parameters increases with sample size , the maximum likelihood approach may provide biased estimators .",
    "the bias is readily seen in the classical example by @xcite of the one - parameter homoscedastic model @xmath16 .",
    "the maximum likelihood estimator for @xmath9 under this model is @xmath17 having expectation @xmath18 , hence it converges to half the true variance .",
    "thus , although the model is parametric , alternatives to the maximum likelihood technique should be employed .",
    "motivated by immunoassay data , @xcite suggests to modify the likelihood ( [ eqlik ] ) by multiplying the contribution of each of the pairs @xmath6 by @xmath19 , and then to maximize the modified likelihood with respect to @xmath13 and @xmath9 .",
    "raab shows by simulation that the standard maximum likelihood estimator is biased , but the modified estimator performs reasonably well .",
    "raab s method is computer intensive , as it requires the estimation of all nuisance parameters .",
    "@xcite estimate @xmath9 by maximizing raab s modified likelihood at the point @xmath20 @xmath21 : @xmath22 where @xmath23 .",
    "this approach , called maximum approximate conditional likelihood ( macl ) by sadler and smith , reduces the estimation task to solving a small set of nonlinear equations .",
    "the resulting estimating equations under the normal model are therefore @xmath24 for example , for the model @xmath25 , the estimating equations reduce to @xmath26 and can be easily solved by standard optimization algorithms using , for example , the r function _ optim _ [ @xcite ] . as pointed out by sadler and smith , the solution for ( [ eqgenprb ] ) can be obtained by an iterative reweighted least squares algorithm .",
    "we applied the macl approach to the january ( @xmath27 ) and march ( @xmath28 ) experiments described in section  [ secintro ] using the functional form @xmath29 and obtained the estimates @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively .",
    "the similarity of the two estimated variance functions is remarkable , suggesting that the between - study variability is small .",
    "this is a very important finding , as the variance function can be estimated in a control experiment and be applied to data obtained in independent experiments on the same instrument .",
    "we finally pooled the data together and obtained an overall macl estimate of @xmath32 .",
    "neither raab nor sadler and smith provide sound theoretical justification for their methods , but explore them in several special relevant cases . in general ,",
    "the expectation of the estimating equations differs from 0 , hence , the estimators of the variance function are , in general , inconsistent .",
    "this is shown in appendix  [ appa ] and is illustrated by simulation in section  [ secsim ] .",
    "however , appendix  [ appa ] suggests that the bias is small when the variance ( for all @xmath5 ) is small , because in such circumstances @xmath33 is a good estimator for @xmath5 , even though it is based on only two observations .",
    "recently , @xcite studied variance functions for microarray experiments and showed a similar inconsistency problem of estimators obtained by the method of moments .",
    "a possible strategy to deal with the inconsistency of the macl approach is to impose additional reasonable assumptions on the nuisance parameters .",
    "we consider the model @xmath34\\\\[-8pt ] \\mu_i&\\sim & g_0,\\qquad i=1,\\ldots , n,\\qquad \\mbox{independent},\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where",
    "( i ) the support of @xmath35 is in the segment @xmath36 $ ] , that is , @xmath37 , ( ii ) the variance is bounded , that is , @xmath38 for all @xmath39 in the support of @xmath35 for some @xmath40 , ( iii ) @xmath10 is continuous on @xmath36 $ ] and identifies @xmath9 , that is , knowing @xmath10 on the support of @xmath35 implies knowledge of @xmath9 .",
    "the assumptions on @xmath41 are satisfied by most practical models .",
    "the reason for bounding @xmath35 and the choice of the values @xmath42 and @xmath43 are discussed in section  [ secci ] . to see the importance of the identifiability assumption , consider the model @xmath44 and a degenerate @xmath35 that assigns all the mass to some @xmath45 .",
    "in such a model , @xmath46 is identifiable , but the pair @xmath47 is not .",
    "[ theo1 ] under model ( [ eqmixmod ] ) and the assumptions following it , the maximum likelihood estimator of @xmath48 is consistent .",
    "the proof , which is sketched in appendix  [ appb ] , is based on the seminal paper by @xcite who prove the consistency of the maximum likelihood estimator in mixture models such as ( [ eqmixmod ] ) .",
    "a recent application of mixture models for variance estimation in microarray analysis can be found in @xcite , though they suggest a different estimation strategy for @xmath9 .    several algorithms for deriving the maximum likelihood estimator of a mixture model",
    "have been suggested in the literature [ see , e.g. , @xcite ] .",
    "here we estimate @xmath9 and @xmath35 by employing the em algorithm , treating @xmath49 as the complete data on the @xmath4th peptide .",
    "one strategy for estimating @xmath35 is to restrict the search to distributions supported on a fine grid and to find the maximum likelihood among these distributions . in the current problem ,",
    "the variance becomes small for large values of @xmath39 and using a simple grid may lead to data points which are too far ( in terms of standard deviations ) from all support points .",
    "we found that defining the support points of @xmath35 as a function of the variance performed better than using a simple grid .",
    "thus , we first obtained an initial estimate of the variance function using , for example , the macl approach , and then restricted the distance between two support points to be at most @xmath50 standard deviations according to the estimated function .",
    "specifically , let @xmath51 be an initial estimate for @xmath9 , and define the maximal support point to be @xmath52 , the second to maximal to be @xmath53 and recursively @xmath54 .",
    "the selected points of support depend on the initial estimate of the variance function and can be updated as part of the algorithm , though in our experience , this update made no significant improvement when using @xmath55 . once the support points for @xmath35 are determined , the em algorithm is applied to estimate @xmath9 and @xmath35 .",
    "the algorithm is quite standard and its description is detailed in appendix  [ appc ] .",
    "we fit the following three forms for @xmath10 that have been suggested in the literature : @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ figdata ] presents estimates of these three functions on a scatter diagram of @xmath59 against @xmath60 .",
    "the x - axis is a naive estimate of the mean of each pair , @xmath5 , and the y - axis is a naive estimate of the variance .",
    "all three models give similar results in most of the range with some deviation for very small values of @xmath39 .",
    "a loess fit , presented in the figure by the dotted line , is quite close to the functional form @xmath29 originally suggested by @xcite .",
    "this latter model is used throughout this paper .    applying the em approach using the functional form @xmath61",
    ", we obtained the estimates @xmath62 and @xmath63 based on the january and march experiments , respectively .",
    "the estimates are very similar to the estimates obtained by the macl approach .",
    "we then pooled the data from the two experiments together and obtained our final estimate , @xmath64 .",
    "the corresponding estimate of @xmath35 is displayed in the supplemental article [ @xcite ] .",
    "initial values for the em algorithm were obtained by the macl approach .",
    "starting the algorithm from different points resulted in essentially the same estimate ( details are provided in the supplementary materials ) .",
    "having estimated the variance function , confidence intervals for various parameters of interest can be constructed based on data from a new experiment that compares different biological samples .",
    "we construct frequentist confidence intervals that are based on the estimate @xmath65 of @xmath9 under model ( [ eqmixmod ] ) , but do not use the estimate of the mixing distribution @xmath35 .",
    "we take this approach since the variance function is a stable characteristic of the mass spectrometer , whereas @xmath35 depends on the biological sample and may differ from sample to sample .",
    "it is of interest to attach a measure of uncertainty to the observed intensity or to report a range rather than one value for each peptide .",
    "this section discusses the construction of @xmath66 confidence intervals for the peptide amount , @xmath39 , based on one observation @xmath67 from the model @xmath68 ; the next section deals with the construction of confidence sets for the relative abundance of a peptide in two different samples .",
    "similar to the macl approach for estimation , construction of confidence intervals can be simplified by plugging an estimate of @xmath39 in @xmath10 .",
    "thus , a naive confidence interval is constructed by @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the @xmath71 quantile of the standard normal distribution .",
    "this method is expected to perform reasonably well only in cases were the variance is small and changes slowly with @xmath39 .    an exact @xmath66 confidence set for @xmath39",
    "can be constructed using the pivotal quantity @xmath72 .",
    "this interval is defined as @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the @xmath71 quantile of the chi - squared distribution with @xmath75 degrees of freedom .    for the model",
    "@xmath29 , this set can be easily found by a bisection search using the following observations :    @xmath76 is a local minimum .    for @xmath77 , @xmath78 is a local maximum of @xmath79 , with @xmath80 .",
    "we thus obtain the following properties of the confidence procedure :    * if @xmath81 , then the confidence set is a one - sided interval of the form @xmath82 . * if @xmath83 , then the confidence set is a union of two intervals , @xmath84 , where @xmath85 .",
    "this nonstandard shape of the confidence set reflects the fact that a realization @xmath86 is likely either when @xmath39 is close to @xmath86 or when @xmath39 is much smaller than @xmath86 and the variance of the measurement is very large .",
    "often , the range of @xmath39 is a priori bounded so that values smaller than @xmath87 do not belong to the parameter space , and the confidence set is always an interval .    since the parameter @xmath9 is unknown , a consistent estimator based on the mixture approach is plugged in to generate confidence intervals with an approximate level @xmath66 .",
    "let @xmath88 and @xmath89 be the log intensities of the same peptide obtained by the itraq protocol under two different conditions , and assume that @xmath90 and @xmath91 are independent conditionally on @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "we consider the construction of a confidence set for @xmath94 , which is the parameter of primary interest in many quantitative ms studies .    as in the one - parameter case , a naive confidence interval for @xmath94",
    "can be obtained by plugging @xmath90 and @xmath91 into the variance term : @xmath95 .",
    "however , such intervals may be anti - conservative , as the estimator @xmath96 for @xmath5 is inconsistent , and hence so is the estimator @xmath97 for @xmath98 .    a direct and a relatively simple way of calculating conservative intervals is by bonferroni correction , that is , by first constructing @xmath99 intervals for @xmath92 and for  @xmath93 , as described in the previous section , and then calculating the minimum and maximum differences of the two intervals",
    "however , a more direct construction uses the reparametrization @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "let @xmath102 and @xmath103 then @xmath104 has a bivariate standard normal distribution with correlation @xmath105 thus , @xmath106 has a @xmath107 distribution and can serve as a pivot for constructing confidence regions .",
    "specifically , @xmath108 is an exact @xmath66 confidence region for @xmath109 and , therefore , @xmath110 is a conservative confidence set for @xmath111 .      in this section",
    "we analyze data from the two control experiments mentioned in section  [ secintro ] .",
    "as the two biological samples in these experiments were identical , @xmath112 for all peptides @xmath7 . in order to evaluate the performance of our confidence intervals",
    ", we used the parameters estimates from one experiment to construct 95% level confidence intervals for the difference of peptide abundances in the other experiment , and calculated the proportion of intervals that did not cover 0 , the true difference .",
    "as in the uni - parameter case , the confidence set for @xmath109 is not necessarily a connected set and the resulting confidence set for @xmath111 is not always an interval .",
    "figure  [ figci ] demonstrates the shape of the confidence region for the pairs @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "the x and y axes are , respectively , @xmath111 and @xmath115 , and the confidence sets are the shaded areas .",
    "the figure reveals that without restricting the parameter space of @xmath39 ( hence the parameter space of @xmath111 ) , the confidence interval for @xmath111 comprises all of the real line and is noninformative .",
    "we therefore assumed that @xmath116 $ ] , where the limits were determined from typically observed values as well as the expected range of the intensity values .",
    "this decision restricts the values of @xmath111 and @xmath115 to the large parallelograms depicted in figure [ figci ] , and enables the construction of informative confidence intervals .",
    "the smaller parallelograms represent confidence sets obtained by bonferroni correction applied to univariate confidence intervals for @xmath92 and for @xmath93 .",
    "constructed for two data points : @xmath117 ( left ) and @xmath118 ( right ) . ]    using estimates from the january data , we calculated confidence intervals for @xmath111 for peptides in the march experiment by ( [ cinu ] ) , bonferroni correction and the naive approach , and found that , respectively , 18 ( 0.8% ) , 1 ( 0.05% ) and 86 ( 3.96% ) of the 2174 intervals did not include the true parameter @xmath119 .",
    "the corresponding numbers for the 2144 peptides in the january experiments using estimates from the march data are 47 ( 2.19% ) , 8 ( 0.4% ) and 106 ( 4.94% ) .",
    "this exercise suggests that interval ( [ cinu ] ) is better than the bonferroni interval , but is still conservative .",
    "the naive approach performs surprisingly well in our experiment , but , in general , its theoretical coverage probability is not controlled .",
    "further research is needed to understand this phenomenon .",

    "( @xcite ) used itraq labeling to study a key modification to proteins called phosphorylation , which is important in cell signaling , and is often deregulated in cancer cells .",
    "their study focused on aberrant signaling arising from oncogenic flt3 mutations in acute myeloid leukemia .",
    "in particular , they monitored a key , subcomponent of signal transduction , namely , protein tyrosine phosphorylation , in order to obtain a global understanding of the oncogenic potential of two clinically identified flt3 mutants ( flt3-d835y and flt3-itd ) .",
    "both flt3 mutants induce constitutive signaling even in the absence of proper external cues , which results in uncontrolled cell proliferation , a  hallmark of cancer development [ @xcite ] . since receptor tyrosine kinases are often constitutively active in cancer cells , it is not surprising that a large proportion of downstream phosphorylation events diverge from a 1:1 value ( measured relative to a control cell line ) , effectively eliminating the possibility of deriving a variance function from the experimental data themselves .",
    "based on the mixture model results of the pooled control experiments , we calculated 95% confidence intervals for the ratio of phosphopeptides mentioned explicitly in the figures of zhang et  al . ;",
    "these are reported in table  [ tabdata ] . for comparison ,",
    "we calculated confidence intervals based on a naive approach mentioned in section  [ secci2par ] . using the intensity - dependent variance function described in this paper , as opposed to a constant cutoff point often used in the literature , subtle changes in phosphorylation levels can be found ( e.g. , peptide vlpqdkepyyk ) .",
    "such ratios can be considered statistically significant despite being smaller than the typical cutoff of 2:1 .",
    "this in turn suggests that experiments can be designed to explore phosphorylation under physiological conditions , unlike many current experimental designs where artificial or extreme environments are used in order to amplify the observed ratios .",
    "for a given peptide , consider testing the hypothesis @xmath129 versus the two - sided alternative @xmath130 . theoretically , this can be done by inverting the confidence intervals discussed in the previous section . however , for calculating @xmath0-values , this inversion is computationally difficult and the current section explores an alternative approach .    as before , let @xmath88 and @xmath89 be independent , then @xmath131 and a reasonable test may compare @xmath132 to the chi - squared distribution with one degree of freedom .",

    "this approach is simple and easy to implement but results in an overly conservative @xmath0-value .",

    "the following scenarios were considered :    * observations fixed : a set of @xmath5 values was sampled from the observed @xmath33 s ( with replacement ) and the same values were used in all 1000 replications . * observations random : a different set of @xmath5 values was sampled from the observed @xmath33 s ( with replacement ) for each simulation . * u@xmath156 : the @xmath5 values were generated from the continuous uniform distribution over @xmath156 . * u@xmath157 : the @xmath5 values were generated from the discrete uniform distribution over @xmath157 .",

    "more importantly , the variance estimated here corresponds only to the variance of the instrument itself , and does not include error terms corresponding to the natural variability of biological samples or the processing required to solubilize proteins from cells and tissues , generate peptides , etc .",
    "two inference approaches are considered .",
    "the first estimates the nuisance parameters by simple averages and then maximizes a target function ; the second approach assumes a mixture model and estimates the variance function by maximum likelihood .",
    "when the variance is small and changes slowly as a function of the mean , as is the case in the data we analyzed , an average of two itraq reporter ions per peptide provides a reasonable estimate for the unknown @xmath39 and the first approach gives good results .",

    "on the other hand , for inference on the difference or the ratio of peptide abundance measured across two biological conditions , the naive approach performs quite well , yielding a significant level only slightly larger than the aimed one .",
    "the itraq protocol is somewhat more complicated than presented here , as it involves preprocessing of the spectral data to correct for differences in total protein amount , itraq label purity and instrument - specific parameters .",
    "moreover , itraq is known to suffer from contamination due to co - eluting chromatographic peaks that also share similar precursor masses ( i.e. , peptides which have a similar @xmath178 value and retention time ) .",
    "theoretically , these factors may induce dependence between measurements that is ignored in the current analysis .    in order to test the underlying normal assumption , zhang et  al .",
    "produced a q  q plot of @xmath179 that showed a very good fit .",
    "although the graph is suggestive , it relies on @xmath33 as an estimate for the nuisance parameter @xmath5 , hence it does not have a theoretical support . a  formal approach",
    "we intend to explore requires at least three observations for each peptide . a  simple transformation of each of the triplets results in variables that , under the normal model , have a cauchy distribution , and a q  q plot or formal goodness - of - fit tests can be easily employed .",
    "this approach requires itraq data from a control experiment that yields more than two independent and identically distributed measures for each peptide .",
    "we intend to conduct such an experiment in the future .",
    "the conservative results of the exercise conducted in section [ secci2par ] are partially due to the inherently conservative construction of the intervals , but may also be a result of the special parametric shape for the variance function we considered .",
    "our chosen parametric model is very simple , enabling the implementation of simple algorithms , and is supported quite well by the data .",
    "a nonparametric method has been recently suggested for the analysis of microarray data [ @xcite ] ; the possibility of adopting this method to ms data and of using it for goodness - of - fit testing should be further explored .",
