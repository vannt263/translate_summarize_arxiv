    "the measurement of 21  cm line of neutral hydrogen from high redshifts is eagerly awaited as a probe of the epoch of reionisation ( eor ) . during the eor , the first collapsed objects heat and ionise the intergalactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "therefore , the epoch and the process of reionisation are tightly related to the evolution of cosmological structure and the formation of the first objects @xcite .",
    "the 21  cm fluctuations are sensitive to the density , temperature , and ionised fraction of igm .",
    "studying the 21-cm tomography tells us about the physics of igm gas and structure formation during the eor @xcite , and several 21-cm experiments are recently designed and built ( e.g. mwa , lofar , ska ) .",
    "the 21  cm cross - correlation with other complementary probes is expected to provide additional information other than their respective auto - correlations .",
    "besides , the cross - correlation has an advantage for observations of 21  cm fluctuations whose signal is weak , because it suffers from foregrounds and systematic effects less than the auto - correlations .",
    "the cross - correlation between the 21  cm line and the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) has been studied by many authors . on large scales ( @xmath3 ) , the 21-cm fluctuations cross - correlate with the cmb doppler temperature anisotropies which are due to the motions of ionised baryons @xcite . because the maximum amplitude of the cross - correlation is reached at the redshift",
    "when the ionised fraction is one half , it is sensitive to the eor . on small scales ( @xmath4 )",
    ", cross - correlation between the 21  cm fluctuations and cmb temperature anisotropies from reionisation bubbles arises @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that these two signals are anti - correlated on the scale corresponding to the typical size of an ionised bubble .",
    "@xcite studied the 21  cm cross - correlation with cmb @xmath5-mode polarisation on large scales .",
    "they have shown that the peak of the cross - correlation spectrum reaches its maximum value when the average ionised fraction of the universe is about half as shown in the case of the 21  cm cross - correlation with the cmb doppler temperature , and there is a damping that depends on the duration of reionisation . the cross - correlation between the 21  cm fluctuations and high redshift galaxy distribution has also the potential to probe the eor @xcite . on large scales ,",
    "the 21-cm and galaxy distributions are anti - correlated , while on scales smaller than the typical size of an ionised bubble , these fields become roughly uncorrelated .",
    "therefore , the cross - correlation between the 21  cm fluctuations and high redshift galaxy distributions provides access to the evolution of the typical scale of the ionised bubble .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the detectability of the cross - correlation between the 21  cm fluctuations and cmb by performing a signal - to - noise ( sn ) analysis .",
    "particularly , we focus on the cross - correlation on large scales and we discuss the detectability of the signals and the sensitivity to the reionisation properties by planck and lofar which will release useful data for the cross - correlation in the near future .",
