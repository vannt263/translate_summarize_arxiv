    "<S> @xmath55 is approximately constant and @xmath56 linear with magnetic field in both the weak coupling regime ( @xmath74 ) and the strong coupling regime ( @xmath49 ) . in both limits </S>",
    "<S> the hanle curve has the same shape , but in the case of strong coupling the amplitude and peak width are reduced drastically . </S>",

    "<S> we assume these properties to be equal for both devices , so the blue curves in fig  [ fig:3](a ) and ( b ) are the same . in the intermediate regime , which is around @xmath79  ps @xmath80  </S>",

    "<S> the shape is the same as a regular hanle curve , but its amplitude and peak width both decrease drastically . in this regime </S>",
    "<S> the spin properties are dominated by the localized spin states , therefore @xmath81 .    </S>",
    "<S> we now discuss how the simulated data from the localized states model relates to the experiment . </S>",
    "<S> when we compare fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2 ] and [ fig:3 ] we see a similar double peak shape emerging when going from high to low temperature or from strong to weak coupling , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the similarity of the two figures points to a coupling rate that is temperature dependent . </S>",
    "<S> this can be explained by two possible mechanisms : 1 ) the localized states are at the fermi energy and the coupling is mediated by activated transport , where the thermal energy is used to overcome a tunnel barrier or 2 ) the localized states are distributed over a range of energies , depending on the available thermal energy . </S>",
    "<S> the strength of the effect is different for the two materials under investigation , eg by sublimation and eg by cvd . </S>",
    "<S> this can be explained by the structural difference of the bufferlayer , resulting in a different density and/or energy distribution of the localized states .    when comparing the experiment and simulations we see a difference in ratio between the signal amplitude and curve width . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests more of the fitting parameters are temperature dependent , limiting the usefulness of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : effbloch ] for fitting the experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> we also attempted to simulate the data using more free fit parameters . </S>",
    "<S> this , however , leads to a result with too many uncertainties of which the interpretation is unclear and an even higher value for @xmath64 ( see supplementary information for the details of this analysis ) . </S>",
    "<S> a possibility would be to incorporate a distribution of coupling rates similar to a so - called heavy tail distribution of trapping times that is seen in disordered semiconductors,@xcite which influences the hanle shape even outside the intermediate coupling regime according to ref .  . </S>",
    "<S> such an analysis might also shed more light on the high value we find for @xmath64 , giving @xmath82  ev@xmath16@xmath22 or higher . </S>",
    "<S> this , however , is outside the scope of this paper .    in short </S>",
    "<S> , we investigated a new regime of intermediate coupling strength between diffusive and localized electron spins in eg on sic and observed anomalous hanle curves , giving novel insights in the effects that can play a role in widely used hanle precession experiments . </S>",
    "<S> the interaction between channel and localized states is complex , reflected in the number of variables in the model . </S>",
    "<S> nonetheless , we found a qualitative agreement between the temperature dependence of the anomalous experimental hanle curves and our model . </S>",
    "<S> we observed a significant difference in the density of localized states between the two material types , which is likely to be related to the structure of the bufferlayer , the effect being stronger in eg by cvd ( type ii ) . </S>",
    "<S> for both types , the analysis leads to a high density of localized states in the buffer layer .    </S>",
    "<S> on the one hand this work might provide new answers for how to control transported spins by coupling them to their environment . on the other </S>",
