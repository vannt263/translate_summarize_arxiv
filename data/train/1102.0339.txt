    "mass loss from asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars is one of the major stellar sources that supply dust grains to the interstellar medium ( ism ) and is a key process of the material circulation in galaxies @xcite .",
    "agb stars are suggested to be efficient sources even in low metallicity environments @xcite .",
    "mass loss is also crucial to the late evolutionary stages of low- to intermediate - mass stars .",
    "radiation pressure on forming dust grains is thought to play a significant role as a mass - loss mechanism , but there still remain several open issues , such as the trigger of the mass - loss process , the dependence of the mass loss on the stellar parameters , and the change of the mass loss along the stellar evolution @xcite . far - infrared ( fir ) studies based on _ iras _ observations indicate the presence of detached shells around carbon stars , suggesting that the mass - loss process is sporadic rather than steady due to thermal pulses in the star @xcite .",
    "detailed analyses of fir data in fact confirm the presence of detached shells in several agb stars @xcite .",
    "detached shells are also investigated in detail with co line observations @xcite and their spatial structures are studied in optical scattered light @xcite . while co and optical scattered - light observations provide detailed information on the shell dynamics and structure , infrared observations yield estimates of the dust mass and temperature of the detached shell .",
    "mid - infrared ( mir ) data can add crucial constraints on the temperature and mass of dust grains because they measure the wien side of the thermal emission from the detached shell .",
    "however , no detached shells of agb stars have so far been detected in the mir .",
    "u ant is an n - type carbon star of irregular variability at a distance of 260pc @xcite .",
    "the circumstellar envelope around u ant is studied in the fir @xcite , the co emission @xcite , and the optical scattered light @xcite .",
    "these studies resolve 5 shells at @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath5 from the central star ( hereafter shell 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 5 , respectively ) .",
    "@xcite argued that there is no strong evidence for the existence of full shells inside shell 3 . very recently",
    "the shell around u ant is studied with pacs @xcite onboard _ herschel space observatory _ @xcite , which resolves the detached shell clearly in the fir @xcite . in this _ letter _ , we report the first detection of the detached shell around at mir wavelengths with the infrared camera ( irc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) onboard _ akari _ @xcite .",
    "the observations are made under the _ akari _ mission program `` excavating mass loss history in extended dust shells of evolved stars '' ( mlhes , pi : i. y. ) .",
    "observations of u ant were made in the l15 ( 15@xmath0 m ) and l24 ( 24@xmath0 m ) bands of the irc on 2006 december 20 .",
    "the fwhm of the point spread function ( psf ) is @xmath6 and @xmath7 for l15 and l24 , respectively .",
    "the obtained dataset consists of long- and short - exposure images .",
    "since u ant is very bright in the mir ( @xmath8jy at 15@xmath0 m ) , the long - exposure images are all saturated around the central star position and several artifacts appear in the images due to reflections between the optical elements of the irc @xcite .",
    "we use the short - exposure data to complement the saturated inner region and employ the long - exposure data to investigate the outer region .",
    "the short - exposure data of l24 are not saturated even at the central star , but those of l15 are nearly at the saturation level . thus the very central part ( @xmath9 ) of the l15 image is not used in the following analysis .",
    "the short- and long - exposure data are smoothly connected at the unsaturated region by scaling with the exposure time .",
    "( a factor of 28 )",
    ". accurate determination of the artifacts and the psfs with a large dynamic range are needed to detect faint emission from the detached shell .",
    "we employed the data of the bright star iras 22396@xmath104708 taken in the mlhes program as a calibration source , the archival data of crl618 of an open time program , and iras f06009@xmath106636 taken in the irc calibration observations to investigate the artifacts and psfs .",
    "the first two objects were used to investigate the artifacts and the psfs in the outer part , while the last one was used to determine the inner psfs , where the former data were saturated .",
    "the artifacts show movement patterns different from real objects in the image . using this characteristic , we separated the artifacts from the psf .",
    "details of the procedure will be given in a separate paper .",
    "we determined the psfs down to @xmath11 of the peak brightness both at the l15 and l24 bands ( figs .",
    "[ fig : images]b and e ) .",
    "the psfs of the irc mir images are extended over the entire field - of - view due to the scattering within the detector array as recognized in the irac onboard _",
    "@xcite , which uses the same type of the detector array @xcite .",
    "correction for the artifacts was applied for each exposure frame after the sky background had been subtracted . except for this additional process , the data were reduced by the standard imaging process with the latest flat data and the dithered images were co - added to obtain the final images ( figs .  [ fig : images]a and d ) .",
    "the obtained psfs were fitted to the inner @xmath12 region of the co - added images and subtracted ( figs .",
    "[ fig : images]c and f ) .",
    "the scaling of the psfs is determined with an accuracy better than 0.5% .",
    "extended structures due to the psf patterns produced by the central star are cancelled out almost completely and the detached shell appears clearly in the central - star - subtracted images of both bands .",
    "the psf well fits the image both at the inside and outside of the shell , confirming the detection of the shell at l15 and l24 .",
    "u ant was also observed with the far - infrared surveyor ( fis , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) onboard _ akari _ on 2006 december 21 with the slow scan mode for a compact source .",
    "data in four fir bands , n60 ( 65@xmath0 m ) , wide - s ( 90@xmath0 m ) , wide - l ( 140@xmath0 m ) , and n160 ( 160@xmath0 m ) were simultaneously obtained for a @xmath13 area .",
    "the fis data were processed in the same manner as described in @xcite and the same psf subtraction procedure was applied as for the irc data .",
    "the fis data are in agreement with the iras and pacs data within the uncertainties and have finer spectral sampling than them .",
    "the observational data used in this study , including the calibration data , are summarized in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "the central - star - subtracted image of l24 shows a smooth , symmetrical shell .",
    "the shell is also clearly seen at l15 ( figs .",
    "[ fig : images]c and f ) .",
    "the presence of an extended component is evident even in the original l24 image ( fig .",
    "[ fig : images]d ) , when compared to the psf ( fig .",
    "[ fig : images]e )",
    ". the brightness peaks at around @xmath14 in the both bands . to investigate the shell structure in detail , we assume that the shell is optically thin at mir and spherically symmetric .",
    "we integrate the flux density in each projected annulus to obtain the 1-d radial brightness profile ( rbp ) .",
    "the density distribution of the shell along the radial direction is approximated by a gaussian according to @xcite .",
    "the model emission is integrated along the line of sight , convolved with the psf , and compared with the observed profile .",
    "we found that any single gaussian distribution can not give a reasonable fit with the observations and that the double shell with the gaussian parameters of shell 3 and 4 estimated in @xcite fits the observations fairly well .",
    "figures  [ fig : profile]a and b show the double - shell model fit .",
    "the model fit parameters are summarized in table  [ table2 ] .",
    "the errors in the rbp are estimated from the variance of the intensity in each annulus , which includes the error in the central star subtraction , the background sky fluctuation , and the deviation from the spherical symmetry . although the mir images do not resolve the second shell , the tail of the rbp at larger radii requires a second gaussian component whose peak is located at around 50 , especially at l24 .",
    "the flux densities of both shells are estimated from the gaussian parameters .",
    "the total shell fluxes at the fis bands are estimated by the same procedure as for the irc .",
    "the flux density of each shell can not be determined separately at the fis bands because of the low spatial resolution .",
    "together with the fis and pacs @xcite data , we now obtain the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the detached shell of u ant from 15@xmath0 m to 160@xmath0 m , from which the temperature and mass of dust grains in the shell can be estimated .",
    "we assume that the variability at ir wavelengths is negligible because the visual magnitude amplitude is only about 1 mag .",
    "first we assume that dust grains in the both shells have the same temperature .",
    "the pacs data are given only for the sum of the flux densities of the central star and the shells , whereas the irc and fis data are available for the central source and the shells separately .",
    "thus we estimate the dust temperature and mass by minimizing @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the planck function of the temperature @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 are the observed flux densities of the central source , the shells , and the sum of the central source and the shells , respectively , at the wavelength @xmath20 : @xmath20=1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , and 8 correspond to 15 , 24 ( irc ) , 65 , 90 , 140 , 160 ( fis ) , and 70 , and 160@xmath0 m ( pacs ) , respectively .",
    "the flux densities of the central source are estimated from the psf fit , which include those from the star and the circumstellar envelope produced by the present mass - loss .",
    "we assume that flux densities are in the rayleigh - jeans regime in the spectral range in question .",
    "the dust emissivity is assumed to be given by @xmath21 . in eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) , @xmath17 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 are the fitting parameters , where @xmath17 is the dust temperature and @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the scaling factor for the central source and the shell emission , respectively . in the fitting , we take account of the color corrections of each filter band ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : sed ] ) .",
    "the dust mass @xmath24 can be estimated from @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the distance to the star ( 260pc ) and @xmath27 is the dust mass absorption coefficient .",
    "the dust mass given by eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) is independent of the dust size when the dust size is much smaller than the wavelength in question .",
    "we adopt the dust parameters employed in @xcite as @xmath28 and @xmath29(60@xmath0m)=150@xmath30g@xmath31 .",
    "they are in agreement with those of amorphous carbon grains with the specific density of 1.5g@xmath32 @xcite .    the best fit result for the single - temperature case is shown in fig .  [ fig : sed]a , which gives @xmath33k and @xmath34m@xmath35 .",
    "the single - temperature model can not fit the observed sed well .",
    "the reduced @xmath36 is 6.6 , which arises mostly from excess emission at 15@xmath0 m .",
    "if the data point of 15@xmath0 m is removed from the fit , the reduced @xmath36 improves to be 1.9 and the model underestimates the observed flux density at 15@xmath0 m by a factor of 3 .",
    "alternatively , we assume that dust grains in each shell ( shell 3 and 4 ) have different temperatures .",
    "the same shell parameters adopted by @xcite ( table  [ table2 ] ) are assumed . using the flux densities obtained for each shell at the irc bands , we derive the best fit parameters for the two - shell model in a manner similar to eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) . the best fit result for the two - shell model",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sed]b and its parameters are given in table  [ table2 ] .",
    "the reduced @xmath36 becomes 1.5 .",
    "the fit is significantly improved compared to the single - temperature model .",
    "the model flux density at 15@xmath0 m agrees with the observation within the uncertainty .",
    "the two - shell model well accounts for the observed sed from 15 to 160@xmath0 m .",
    "optical scattered light observations indicate the presence of 4 detached shells around u ant @xcite , among which the present observations detect mir emission from shells 3 and 4 .",
    "shells 1 and 2 are seen only at the bands that contain the nad lines and not full shells @xcite .",
    "it is not clear whether these are real shells or merely patchiness present in shells 3 and 4 .",
    "optical polarization images of dust - scattered light , line - scattered light data , and medium - resolution co radio line observations suggest that shell 3 is gas - rich and most dust grains reside in shell 4 .",
    "our results indicate that shell 4 dominates in the dust mass ( table  [ table2 ] ) , confirming their results .",
    "@xcite detect fir emission from the detached shell at @xmath37 at 60 and 100@xmath0 m as well as that at @xmath38 around u ant .",
    "they estimate the dust mass associated with the shell at @xmath37 as @xmath39m@xmath35 , which is in good agreement with the present estimate of @xmath40m@xmath35 . @xcite",
    "derive the gas mass in shell 3 as @xmath41m@xmath35 from co observations and the dust mass in shell 4 as @xmath42m@xmath35 from polarization observations .",
    "the dust mass in shell 4 derived in the present study agrees with their result , taking account of the large uncertainty in the estimation from polarization observations .",
    "the dust - to - gas ratio in shell 3 is thus @xmath43 , supporting that shell 3 is dust - poor .",
    "the total dust - to - gas ratio for the sum of shells 3 and 4 is 0.008 , which is in a reasonable range for carbon - rich agb stars .    adopting the distance of 260pc , the locations of shells 3 and 4 are @xmath44 and @xmath45 cm from the star , respectively .",
    "the dynamical age of shell 3 is estimated as 2700 yr from the co line velocity of 19.5kms@xmath31 @xcite .",
    "the width of shell 3 indicates that the average mass - loss rate was @xmath46m@xmath35yr@xmath31 at the shell formation .",
    "it should be noted that this includes the swept - up material and the shell may have widened .",
    "detached shells around u ant are resolved in pacs maps at 70 and 160@xmath0 m .",
    "the peak intensity is located at around @xmath1 and they attribute it to shell 3 @xcite .",
    "the present analysis suggests that the fir emission arises mostly from shell 4 with a negligible contribution from shell 3 .",
    "we calculate the rbp of the fir emission by adopting the same radial dust density distributions as required to explain the mir emission ( table  [ table2 ] ) and assigning the flux densities derived from the sed fit to each shell .",
    "then it is convolved with the model psf of pacs .",
    "figure  [ fig : profile]c plots the result .",
    "the intensity peaks at around @xmath47 and shows a broad profile similar to the observations , which also suggest the presence of an extended emission component beyond shell 3 @xcite . because the column density peaks at the inner part of the shell on the line - of - sight and shell 4 has a relatively large fwhm , the peak of the rbp is shifted to a position inside the actual shell location .",
    "therefore , the two - shell model explains the observed rbps and sed from 15 to 160@xmath0 m consistently .",
    "if amorphous carbon grains of 0.1@xmath0 m size located at @xmath45 cm from the star are heated by a star of 5800l@xmath35 @xcite , their temperature will be about 70k , which is marginally in agreement with the derived temperature of 60k .",
    "on the other hand , the temperature of shell 3 ( @xmath48k ) is definitely too hot since the estimated temperature at shell 3 is only 76k .",
    "the dust drift with respect to the gas as an explanation for the two - shell structure was suggested by @xcite and further elaborated on by @xcite .",
    "the estimated drift velocity is 3kms@xmath31 . in a steady state ,",
    "the drift velocity @xmath49 is given by @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the gas velocity , @xmath52 is the stellar luminosity , @xmath53 is the mass loss rate , @xmath54 is the velocity of light , and @xmath55 is the radiation pressure efficiency factor , which is proportional to @xmath56 , if @xmath56 is much smaller than the wavelength @xcite .",
    "thus small grains have a low drift velocity .",
    "if grains of 0.1@xmath0 m have a drift velocity of 3kms@xmath31 , that of 10 nm grains will be 1kms@xmath31 .",
    "this makes only a @xmath57 offset in the dust distribution relative to gas in 2700 yr , which can not be resolved clearly in the present observations .",
    "carbonaceous grains of 10 nm have small heat capacity and will be heated up to 100k if they absorb a photon of 1ev by the temperature fluctuation mechanism ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "thus shell 3 can still retain very small grains , whose temperature can be quite high .",
    "these crude estimates suggest a possibility that smallest grains are still trapped in the gas - rich shell 3 and emit hot mir radiation .",
    "the actual relative motion between the gas and dust and the temperature of very small grains need to be investigated by numerical simulations for a given size distribution of dust grains .",
