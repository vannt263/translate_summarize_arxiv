    "the main subject of this paper is the following 2003 conjecture of james m^c^kernan :    [ conj : eps - delta ] for fixed positive integers @xmath5 and a real number @xmath6 there exists a @xmath7 such that the following holds : let @xmath0 be a @xmath8-factorial variety , and @xmath9 be a mori fiber space with @xmath10 , @xmath11 .",

    "then @xmath1 is @xmath3-log terminal .",

    "then there exists @xmath7 and an effective moduli part @xmath20 , such that @xmath22 is @xmath3-log terminal .",
    "conjecture  [ conj : shokurov ] clearly implies conjecture  [ conj : eps - delta ] : for a mori fiber space consider a large integer @xmath23 and a generic element @xmath24 of a very ample linear system @xmath25 for some @xmath26 on @xmath1 , and let @xmath27 .",
    "then @xmath16 and for the minimal log discrepancies one has @xmath28 taking the limit @xmath29 gives the implication .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for basic definitions and results of the minimal model program , some of which we briefly recall below . for any normal variety @xmath0 for which some positive multiple of the canonical class @xmath30 is cartier , one defines _ discrepancies _ @xmath31 by the formula @xmath32 in which @xmath33 is a resolution of singularities , and @xmath34 are the irreducible exceptional divisors of @xmath35 .",
    "the _ log discrepancies _ are the numbers @xmath36 .",

    "a variety is said to be @xmath4-log terminal ( abbreviated below to @xmath4-lt ) if its log discrepancies are @xmath41 , i.e. if for ordinary discrepancies one has @xmath42 .",
    "similarly , a variety is @xmath4-log canonical if the log discrepancies are @xmath43 . in particular",
    ", @xmath44-log terminal is the same as kawamata log terminal ( klt ) , and @xmath44-log canonical is the same as log canonical .",
    "we recall that @xmath12 is a _ mori fiber space _ if @xmath45 is projective , @xmath46 is @xmath45-ample , and the relative picard number is @xmath47 .",
    "the assumption that @xmath0 is @xmath8-factorial implies that so is @xmath1 ( cf .",
    "* lemma 5 - 1 - 5 ) ) .",
    "finally , a variety @xmath0 is called a variety of fano type ( ft ) if there exists an effective @xmath8-divisor @xmath24 such that the pair @xmath48 is klt and @xmath49 is nef and big .",
    "there are numerous motivations for the above conjectures .",
    "the case @xmath50 of conjecture  [ conj : eps - delta ] , i.e. `` @xmath0 is klt implies @xmath1 is klt '' follows easily by cutting @xmath0 with @xmath51 general hyperplanes and reducing to a finite surjective morphism . even if @xmath0 is _ not _",
    "@xmath8-factorial , the implication `` @xmath0 is klt implies @xmath52 is klt for an appropriate divisor @xmath14 '' is true , as proved by fujino @xcite .",
    "the first nontrivial case with @xmath6 appears when @xmath53 and @xmath54 , i.e. when @xmath12 is a singular conic bundle .",
    "mori and prokhorov @xcite considered the case when @xmath0 is terminal . in this case , they proved iskovskikh conjecture which says that @xmath1 must have at worst du val singularities .",
    "this proves that one can take @xmath55 for any @xmath56 .",
    "yuri prokhorov also showed us several examples of conic bundles of the form @xmath57 for a cyclic group @xmath58 which indicate that conjecture  [ conj : eps - delta ] is plausible .",
    "conjecture  [ conj : eps - delta ] may also be viewed as the local analogue of borisov - alexeev - borisov ( bab ) boundedness conjecture @xcite which says that for fixed @xmath59 and @xmath6 the family of @xmath59-dimensional @xmath4-lt fano varieties is bounded .",
    "indeed , if @xmath0 happen to be fano varieties , then the family of possible @xmath4-lt varieties  @xmath0 is bounded by the bab conjecture .",
    "then the family of possible varieties @xmath1 must be bounded , so some @xmath60 must exist .",
    "vice versa , when trying to prove bab conjecture by induction , conjecture  [ conj : eps - delta ] naturally appears as one of the steps . in this sense",
    ", it can be considered to be `` the local bab conjecture '' .",
    "the main result of the present paper is the following    [ thm : main ] conjecture  [ conj : eps - delta ] holds in the toric case , i.e. when @xmath12 is a morphism of toric varieties corresponding to a map of fans @xmath61 .    note that in the toric case , if one denotes by @xmath14 the sum of torus invariant divisors with coefficients 1 , then one has @xmath62 and the pair @xmath21 is log canonical with @xmath63 .",
    "thus , the more general conjecture  [ conj : shokurov ] does not fit the toric case very well .",
    "a very interesting question is to find the asymptotic of the function @xmath64 as @xmath65 .",
    "concerning this , we prove the following :    [ thm : fiber - fixed ] in the conditions of theorem  [ thm : main ] , suppose additionally that the generic fiber of @xmath45 is a finite , unramified in codimension one , toric quotient of a fixed toric fano variety @xmath66",
    ". then there exists a constant @xmath67 such that @xmath68 .    on the other hand ,",
    "we prove :    [ thm : example ] there exist a sequence of toric mori fiber spaces with @xmath69 such that @xmath70 and @xmath71    this research originated in a discussion at the acc workshop at the american institute of mathematics in may of 2012 , as an attempt to answer a question brought up by yuri prokhorov .",
    "the authors wish to thank yu .",
    "prokhorov , v.v .",
    "shokurov and other participants of this workshop for many fruitful discussions .",
    "we continue with the notation of the introduction . we first need to examine the combinatorics of the fans of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "we refer to @xcite or @xcite for the general theory of toric varieties .",
    "we work over @xmath72 for simplicity , although , as usual in toric geometry , the results remain true over a field of positive characteristic as well .",
    "recall that a toric variety @xmath0 is given by a pair @xmath73 where @xmath74 is a lattice ( called the lattice of valuations ) and @xmath75 is a rational polyhedral fan in @xmath76 .",
    "a toric map from a toric variety @xmath0 to a toric variety @xmath1 is given by a linear map @xmath77 such that its extension @xmath78 sends every cone in the fan @xmath75 to a cone in the fan @xmath79 .",
    "we denote by @xmath80 the lattice @xmath81 , and by @xmath82 the restriction of @xmath75 to @xmath83 .",
    "we recall the following basic facts :    the morphism @xmath12 is proper iff @xmath84 .",
    "a general fiber of @xmath12 is a product of a torus of dimension @xmath85 with the finite part , the product of finitely many copies of the group schemes @xmath86/(z^{r_i}-1)$ ] .",
    "the character group of the finite part is the torsion subgroup of @xmath87 .",
    "a mori fiber space @xmath12 is a surjective proper morphism with connected fibers , and a general fiber is connected and reduced .",
    "therefore , in our situation one has @xmath88 , and the morphism of lattices @xmath77 is surjective .",
    "a toric variety @xmath0 is @xmath8-gorenstein , i.e. the canonical divisor @xmath30 is @xmath8-cartier iff there exists a function @xmath89 which is linear on each cone @xmath90 and such that @xmath91 for each shortest integral generator @xmath92 of each ray @xmath93 of @xmath94 .",
    "a toric variety @xmath0 is @xmath8-factorial , i.e. every weil divisor is @xmath8-cartier iff the fan @xmath95 is simplicial , i.e. every cone is a simplex .",
    "[ fact : mld ] the @xmath37 is computed as the minimum of the piece - wise linear function @xmath96 on @xmath97 .",
    "obviously , our problem is local on @xmath1 , so we can assume that @xmath1 is affine . since @xmath0 and @xmath1 are @xmath8-factorial , @xmath1 is a quotient of @xmath98 by a finite abelian group .",
    "combinatorially , it is obtained from the standard cone @xmath99 in @xmath100 , with the lattice being a finite extension of the standard lattice @xmath101 .",
    "thus , the fan @xmath79 consists of the cone @xmath67 and its faces .",
    "if the shortest integral generators of the cone @xmath67 are the standard basis vectors @xmath102 then the linear function computing @xmath103 is simply @xmath104 .",
    "suppose that @xmath105 is a toric mori fiber space , with @xmath106factorial @xmath0 and affine @xmath1 as above .",
    "denote by @xmath107 the map of the corresponding lattices , and extend it to the linear map @xmath108 from @xmath109 to @xmath110 we choose the basis of @xmath76 so that the map @xmath108 is the projection of @xmath111 to the last @xmath59 coordinates",
    ". then the following is true about the fan of @xmath0 in @xmath112 .",
    "\\1 ) it has exactly @xmath113 one - dimensional cones ( rays ) @xmath93 , @xmath114 of which @xmath115 are in @xmath83 and for all @xmath116 the ray @xmath117 is mapped by @xmath108 to the ray of @xmath67 , which is the span of the standard basis vector @xmath118    \\2 ) any generators of @xmath93 for @xmath119 form a simplex that contains @xmath120    \\3 ) the cones in the fan of @xmath0 are precisely the simplicial cones generated by @xmath93 for @xmath121 , where @xmath122 does not contain @xmath123 .",
    "the condition @xmath124 implies that    1 .",
    "the fan @xmath82 is complete , i.e. @xmath125 . in particular , @xmath75 has at least @xmath126 rays in @xmath127 .",
    "2 .   for each of the @xmath59 rays of @xmath67 , there exists at least one ray of @xmath75 lying over it .",
    "recall that the picard group of @xmath128cartier divisors on a toric variety @xmath0 is the quotient of the space of piece - wise linear functions modulo the space of linear functions on @xmath75 . since both fans are simplicial ( because @xmath129 are both @xmath8-factorial ) and full - dimensional , the relative picard number @xmath130 is the difference between the number of rays of @xmath0 and @xmath1 minus the relative dimension , @xmath51 .",
    "therefore , @xmath75 has @xmath131 rays .",
    "thus , @xmath75 has no other rays other than the @xmath132 rays listed above , and over each ray of @xmath67 there exists a _",
    "unique _ ray of @xmath75 .",
    "this proves ( 1 ) .",
    "finally , for this set of @xmath133 rays there is only one simplicial fan with support @xmath134 : the one described in ( 3 ) .",
    "this proves ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) .",
    "we now choose a basis in @xmath76 so that the last @xmath59 coordinate vectors are the primitive elements of @xmath74 on the rays @xmath135 denoted by @xmath136 for @xmath137 we also denote by @xmath92 the primitive elements of @xmath138 on the rays  @xmath139    by the above proposition , the fan @xmath75 is isomorphic to the cartesian product @xmath140 . since a general fiber of @xmath141 is connected , the map @xmath142 is surjective .",
    "therefore , one has @xmath143 . however , one need _ not _ have @xmath144 .",
    "in particular , it is possible that @xmath145 are not primitive in the lattice @xmath146    denote by @xmath14 the simplex with vertices @xmath92 in @xmath147 this structure defines the toric fano variety @xmath148 of picard number one , which is the generic fiber of @xmath149 we choose the coordinates in @xmath150 so that the lattice generated by @xmath92 is the standard @xmath151 the lattice @xmath80 is a finite extension of it .",
    "we now describe our basic strategy for the proof of theorem 1 .",
    "recall that @xmath103 of a toric variety @xmath1 is computed as the minimum of the linear function @xmath152 over the non - zero points of @xmath153 .",
    "according to fact  [ fact : mld ] , the mld of a toric singularity is the minimum of the log discrepancies of the non - zero points of the corresponding cone , where the log discrepancy of a point is the value on it of the linear function that equals @xmath154 on the rays of the cone .",
    "suppose that for @xmath1 this minimum is achieved at some point @xmath155 .",
    "we want to prove that if the log discrepancy of @xmath155 is very small , there must exist a point in @xmath74 , in one of the cones of @xmath75 , for which the log discrepancy is also small ( less than the given @xmath2 ) . to look for this point",
    ", we take a preimage @xmath66 of @xmath155 in @xmath74 ( it is possible , because @xmath156 is surjective ) , and consider its multiples @xmath157 modulo the lattice @xmath158 , for some @xmath159 to be specified later .",
    "if the log discrepancy of @xmath155 is really small , then we can choose a fairly large @xmath159 such that for all these points the sum of the last @xmath59 coordinates is still small .",
    "by dirichlet box principle , we can choose two of these points to be close to each other , and take their difference .",
    "if we subtract in the correct order , this produces a point @xmath160 in @xmath74 with the last @xmath59 coordinates nonnegative and with small sum ; and the projection to the first @xmath51 coordinates being near the origin . because the union of the cones for @xmath148 is the whole @xmath161 this projection must belong to some cone , which implies that @xmath160 lies in some cone for @xmath0 and has a small log discrepancy there .    to illustrate the method , we first establish theorem 1 in the particular case when @xmath148 is an unramified in codimension one quotient of the usual projective space @xmath162 .",
    "this means that the barycentric coordinates of @xmath44 in the simplex @xmath14 are @xmath163    [ prop : special - simplex ] in the above notation , suppose additionally that the points @xmath92 for @xmath164 are the standard @xmath165 , and @xmath166 ( here the semicolon separates the first @xmath51 coordinates from the last @xmath59 ) .",
    "then for any @xmath167 , if @xmath168 then @xmath169    suppose that @xmath170 denote the point in @xmath171 on which the mld is achieved , by @xmath172 in other words , @xmath173 where @xmath174 are nonnegative , not all zero , and @xmath175 because @xmath176 is surjective , @xmath177 for some @xmath178 suppose @xmath179 we may additionally assume that all @xmath180 are in @xmath181 because @xmath182    choose @xmath183 . for all integers @xmath184 consider the points @xmath185 and their projections to @xmath186 : @xmath187 .",
    "suppose for all integer @xmath184 , @xmath188 are arbitrary points in @xmath189 .",
    "then there exist @xmath190 and @xmath191 so that for all @xmath192 we have @xmath193    identify @xmath189 with the quotient @xmath194 with the usual haar probability measure . for",
    "each @xmath195 consider a closed box neighborhood of it defined by the conditions @xmath196 \\mod z.$ ] the volume ( i.e. the haar measure ) of each such box is @xmath197 note that the total number of points is @xmath198 so the total sum of the volumes is greater than @xmath154 .",
    "thus there exist @xmath190 and @xmath191 such that the corresponding boxes intersect .",
    "the triangle inequality in @xmath199 implies the result .",
    "we apply the above lemma to the points @xmath200 without loss of generality , we can assume that @xmath201 consider the point @xmath202 in coordinates , @xmath203 .",
    "note that @xmath204 so the sum of the last @xmath59 coordinates of @xmath160 is at most @xmath205 .",
    "suppose that for @xmath206 we have @xmath207 .",
    "then the contribution to the log discrepancy of @xmath160 from the last @xmath59 coordinates is @xmath208    the first @xmath51 coordinates of @xmath160 are less than @xmath209 in absolute value .",
    "denote by @xmath210 the natural projection of @xmath160 to @xmath211 : @xmath212 then @xmath210 belongs to one of the cones of the fan for @xmath148 as follows .",
    "all @xmath213 are nonnegative .",
    "then @xmath210 belongs to the cone @xmath214 which is the span of @xmath215 for @xmath216 the contribution to the log discrepancy from the first @xmath51 coordinates is at most @xmath217 .",
    "at least one of the numbers @xmath213 is negative . without loss of generality",
    ", we can assume that @xmath218 is the smallest ( i.e. the most negative ) of @xmath213 . then @xmath210 lies in the span of @xmath219 its coordinates in that basis are @xmath220 the contribution to the log discrepancy from the first @xmath51 coordinates is at most @xmath221 .",
    "putting it together , the log discrepancy of @xmath160 is at most @xmath222 .",
    "since we chose @xmath183 , we get the log discrepancy of @xmath160 to be at most @xmath223 which contradicts @xmath224    this completes the proof of proposition  [ prop : special - simplex ]",
    ".    one can improve the above estimate slightly by choosing @xmath159 to be a suitable constant times @xmath225 , and by a more `` projectively symmetric '' estimates for @xmath210 .",
    "but it will still give the result of the form @xmath226 , and would make the exposition considerably more muddled .    a slight generalization of the above argument yields theorem  [ thm : fiber - fixed ] .",
    "indeed , suppose @xmath148 is an arbitrary toric fano variety of dimension @xmath51 with the corresponding simplex @xmath227 and suppose that the barycentric coordinates of @xmath44 in @xmath14 are @xmath228 we can fix the vertices @xmath229 in @xmath230 as before , we can take @xmath159 to be @xmath231 .",
    "we apply the same lemma ( though one can get a somewhat better estimate by generalizing scaling the boxes , keeping the same volume ) . as a result , the absolute values of all coordinates of the point @xmath210 are again at most @xmath232 .",
    "so for each of the @xmath233 linear functions corresponding to the @xmath234dimensional cones of the fan for @xmath235 the log discrepancy for @xmath210 will be bounded by constant multiple of @xmath236 .",
    "the same estimate as above proves that for the fixed @xmath237 one can choose @xmath238 thus proving theorem  [ thm : fiber - fixed ] .    finally , theorem  [ thm : main ] follows from theorem  [ thm : fiber - fixed ] by a simple observation that if @xmath239 then also @xmath240 . by the main result of @xcite ( bab conjecture for toric varieties )",
    "there are only finitely many possible fano varieties @xmath148 with @xmath241 .",
    "while the above argument may seem to imply the existence of a general estimate for the @xmath103 in terms of @xmath242 in the form @xmath243 the constant depends implicitly on @xmath2 . in fact , one simply can not hope for the estimate above , in light of the following example which proves theorem 3 .",
    "we fix @xmath244 .",
    "suppose @xmath245 is a natural number .",
    "consider a triangle in @xmath246 with vertices @xmath247 .",

    "the variety @xmath1 is a cyclic quotient singularity of type @xmath254    we claim that for the above example the @xmath103 is asymptotically @xmath255 while @xmath37 is asymptotically at least @xmath256",
    ". this would obviously imply theorem 3 .",
    "the first part is easy : @xmath257 which is asymptotically @xmath258 .    for the estimate on @xmath37 , consider the point @xmath259 in @xmath260 .",
    "we need to prove that no sums @xmath261 and points of @xmath262 have small log discrepancy , in any of the cones of @xmath0 .",
    "consider such point @xmath263 where @xmath264 is an integer from @xmath154 to @xmath265 and @xmath266 .",
    "clearly , we can assume that the last two coordinates of @xmath20 are zero , thus @xmath267 note the following .",
    "\\1 ) if @xmath268 then the contribution from the last two coordinates is already too big .",
    "so we are only concerned with @xmath269    \\2 ) since @xmath270 the first coordinate in @xmath261 is between @xmath44 and @xmath271 therefore the points in the left cone are of no concern : they would have log discrepancy contribution from the first two coordinates at least @xmath272 . for the points in the upper or lower cone , if @xmath273 then the log discrepancy is at least @xmath274 , which is about @xmath275 .",
    "so we only need to consider @xmath276    \\3 ) since @xmath277 the second coordinate of @xmath261 is between @xmath44 and about @xmath271 this rules out points in the lower cone .",
    "for the upper cone , we clearly only need to be concerned with the points @xmath278 .",
    "and there the smallest @xmath279 value is at least @xmath280 which is about @xmath281",
    "it may seem like one can not avoid using the bab conjecture to prove theorem 1 . however , there is an explicit version of the toric bab theorem ( proved by lagarias and ziegler @xcite , and originally by hensley @xcite , before @xcite ) which may probably be used to get an explicit bound of the form @xmath282 .",
    "however this is by no means automatic , and the correct power @xmath283 is highly mysterious .",
    "probably , for @xmath284 it is @xmath285 , but in higher dimensions the answer is not obvious .    by a more careful generalization of the argument for @xmath286 one can get an estimate for @xmath3 in terms of @xmath287 @xmath2 and the tian s alpha invariant of @xmath148 ( that essentially measures `` asymmetry '' of the simplex @xmath14 ) .",
