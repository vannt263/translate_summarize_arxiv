    "the space sol , with the group operation @xmath4 is a lie group and the metric @xmath5 is left - invariant .",
    "although sol is a homogenous space and the action of the isometry group is transitive , the fact that the number of isometries is low ( for example , there are no rotations ) makes that the knowledge of the geometry of submanifolds is far to be complete .",
    "for example , it is known the geodesics ( @xcite ) and more recently , the totally umbilical surfaces ( @xcite ) and some properties on surfaces with constant mean curvature ( @xcite ) .    a first step in the understanding of the geometry of sol consists into consider some type of symmetric property in the surface that allows easier to realize a problem of classification . on the other hand",
    ", it is also natural to take some assumptions of constancy on the curvatures of the surface .",
    "for these reasons , we will study surfaces invariant by a group of isometries of the ambient space as well as that some condition on the curvature , for example , that the mean curvature or the gaussian curvature is constant .",
    "as we have pointed out , the isometry group iso(sol ) has dimension @xmath0 and the component of the identity is generated by the following families of isometries : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a real parameter .",
    "these isometries are left multiplications by elements of sol and so , they are left - translations with respect to the structure of lie group .",
    "remark that the elements @xmath8 and @xmath9 are euclidean translations along horizontal vector and that the set of fixed points are totally geodesic surfaces in sol . in this work",
    "we consider surfaces invariant under the 1-parametric group of isometries @xmath10 , with @xmath11 .",
    "a surface @xmath12 in sol is said an invariant surface if it is invariant under one of the 1-parameter groups of isometries @xmath13 , with @xmath11 .",
    "after an isometry of the ambient space , an invariant surface under the group @xmath14 converts into an invariant surface under the group @xmath15 : this can done by taking the isometry of sol given by @xmath16 .",

    "we classify all invariant surfaces of sol with constant mean curvature @xmath17 , including minimal surfaces ( some pictures of surfaces with @xmath18 appeared in @xcite ) . in section [ sect4 ] we construct and classify all invariant surfaces with constant ( intrinsic or extrinsic ) gaussian curvature ( @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) .",
    "the fact that the sol geometry has not constant sectional curvature makes that the constancy of @xmath19 or @xmath20 does not imply the other one .",

    "the study of surfaces with constant curvature , specially with constant mean curvature , in homogeneous 3-spaces and invariant under the action of a one - parameter group of isometries of the ambient space has been recently of interest for many geometers .",

    "the understanding of the geometry of sol is given by the next three foliations : @xmath28 the foliations @xmath29 and @xmath30 are determined by the isometry groups @xmath15 and @xmath14 respectively , and they describe ( the only ) totally geodesic surfaces of sol , being each leaf isometric to a hyperbolic plane ; the foliation @xmath31 realizes by minimal surfaces , all them isometric to euclidean plane .    the riemannian connection @xmath32 of sol with respect to @xmath33 is @xmath34 now we are going to compute the curvatures of an invariant surface .",
