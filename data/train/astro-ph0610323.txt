    "supernovae and supernova remnants ( snrs ) power galactic turbulence and cosmic rays , drive galactic chemical evolution , and illustrate the recent history of star formation .",
    "however , the galaxy suffers a well - known shortage of young remnants .",
    "we are sure of only a few , whereas typical supernova rates ( e.g. , van den bergh & tammann 1991 ) predict three or more sne per century , or 60 expected snrs younger than 2000 yr . if we have not misunderstood galactic supernova rates , star formation rates , or snr evolution , then we are missing many young remnants .",
    "some of the missing young remnants may be concealed among known , but poorly studied , small - diameter radio remnants .",
    "we have begun a program to identify young snrs by conducting observations with the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory of several remnants with high radio surface brightnesses in order to obtain spectra to estimate ages and to search for evidence of ejecta .",
    "the first results of that program are presented in this paper . the compact radio - bright remnant g15.9 + 0.2 reveals enhanced elemental abundances and has an inferred age of a few thousand years or less , making it one of the dozen or so youngest snrs in the galaxy .",
    "it is among the highest surface brightness radio snrs in the galaxy ( see refs .  in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and has a fairly symmetrical radio shell structure ( fig .",
    "[ radioxim ] ) , both of which properties are indications of relative youth .",
    "we have also made the unexpected discovery of a central compact source in g15.9 + 0.2  that is likely to be associated with this remnant .",
    "if this is the case , we can identify g15.9 + 0.2  as the remnant of a core - collapse supernova .",
    "the distance to g15.9 + 0.2  is poorly known , but there are several indications of a large distance , including a high absorption column density ( verified by our spectral fits ) and an estimate of 14 kpc from the ( untrustworthy ) @xmath10 relation ( caswell et al",
    ".  1982 , corrected to a galactocentric distance of 8.5 kpc ) . in the absence of any other information , we scale all results for a fiducial distance of that to the galactic center , 8.5 kpc . for this nominal assumed distance ,",
    "the mean remnant radius is 6.2 pc .",
    "we observed g15.9 + 0.2  with _ chandra _ using the acis - s ccd camera ( s3 chip ) on 2005 may 23 ( 10 ks ) , may 25 ( 5 ks ) , and may 28 ( 15 ks ) .",
    "we checked the aspect correction , removed pixel randomization in energy , corrected for charge transfer inefficiency , and filtered the light curve to reject background flares .",
    "we used calibration data from caldb version 3.1.0 . for spectral analysis",
    ", data were binned to a minimum of 25 counts per bin to allow the use of @xmath11 statistics .",
    "our source extraction region contained 32,000 counts ( 19,700 after background subtraction ) .",
    "background was taken from essentially the entire area of the s3 chip not occupied by the source and not too near the chip edge .",
    "the relatively high percentage of background reflects galactic ridge emission , along with the relatively low surface brightness of g15.9 + 0.2 .",
    "figure  [ radioxim ] shows the chandra image of g15.9 + 0.2 , with radio contours .",
    "the shell is almost complete , with a very sharp outer edge .",
    "an unresolved source ( hereafter cxou j181852.0 - 150213 ) can be clearly seen in the interior , though well offset from the remnant center .",
    "the radio image was produced after re - processing archival data obtained in 1993 at 1385 and 1465 mhz with the vla in two hybrid configurations bnc and cnd @xcite .",
    "in addition to the 1.4 ghz image shown in fig .",
    "[ radioxim ] , we have also processed vla data acquired in the direction to g15.9 + 0.2 at 327.5 and at 5 ghz .",
    "no evidence for a radio counterpart for the central point source , or for a radio flat - spectrum pulsar wind nebula , is evident in any of these radio images .",
    "the integrated remnant spectrum is shown in fig .",
    "[ totspec ] . clearly apparent",
    "are strong k@xmath12 emission features of mg , si , s , ar , and ca , and the effects of high interstellar absorption .",
    "the integrated remnant spectrum can not be adequately fitted with a model for a planar shock with solar abundances ( xspec model _ pshock _ ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but a model with variable abundances is much more successful ( see fig .",
    "[ totspec ] ; @xmath11 moved from 378 to 245 for 233 degrees of freedom ) .",
    "the fitted column density of @xmath13 @xmath7 is relatively insensitive to the model .",
    "( errors throughout are 90% confidence intervals . )",
    "the electron temperature and ionization timescale are @xmath14 kev and @xmath15 @xmath2 s. this model has a peculiar abundance pattern , requiring s and ar at 2  5 times solar , but solar si . such an anomaly might arise if the spectrum were more complex than assumed , for instance if there were actually two thermal components .",
    "we can obtain good fits ( @xmath16 ) with two components , one with solar abundances and the other with all abundances co - varied ( in solar ratios ) .",
    "solar abundances in both components are ruled out at a high level of significance ( @xmath17 with 235 degrees of freedom ) , but the amount of enhancement is strongly correlated with the emission measure ( the product of these quantities being roughly constant ) .",
    "the fitted absorption is consistent with the value given above for a single component .",
    "the solar and elevated - abundance components have temperatures of 0.7 ( 0.6 , 0.9 ) and 2.3 ( 1.9 , 3 ) kev , respectively , and ionization timescales of @xmath18 and @xmath19 @xmath2 s. the poorly constrained emission measure of the hotter component is an order of magnitude below that of the cool component for the 90%-confidence lower limit on the enhancement ( a factor of ten ) .",
    "the rms electron density implied by the dominant cool component @xmath20 of @xmath21 @xmath2 is similar to that of the one - component model , about 3.8 @xmath22 @xmath2 .",
    "lines of several elements are labeled .",
    "model : plane shock with variable abundances ( _ vpshock _ ) .",
    "lower points : spectrum of central source , binned to 15 counts per channel .",
    "[ totspec ] ]    supporting evidence for spatial variations in spectra comes from separate examination of two regions in the se of the shell : one including the outer edge of emission , of width about @xmath23 in the radial direction , and a second one inside the first , also of width @xmath23 ( fig .",
    "[ radioxim ] ) . fits to these two regions using _ vpshock _ ( elements mg , si , s , ar , and ca allowed to vary in abundance ) show significant differences ( fig .",
    "[ 2fits ] ) .",
    "in particular , the fitted ionization timescale for the outer region is @xmath24 @xmath2 s , six times larger than that of the interior region .",
    "while the errors on fitted parameters are substantial , a fit to one spectrum when applied to the other increased @xmath11 by 81 after renormalization ( 92 degrees of freedom ; reduced @xmath11 increased from 0.5 to 1.3 ) .",
    "furthermore , there is a suggestion of higher overabundances in the inner region : s about three times solar , ar about six times , but with substantial errors .",
    "while these results do not constitute firm evidence for a distinct ejecta component , they do suggest it , and indicate spectral complexity in the remnant that is consistent with the relatively young age we infer below .",
    "a more complete understanding of the thermal shell emission in g15.9 + 0.2  will require a deeper observation , but this is not necessary for our general conclusions .    ]",
    "the cxou j181852.0 - 150213 emission is consistent with a point source , and contains about 120 total counts in our observation ( after background subtraction ) .",
    "the spectrum is highly absorbed with an @xmath25 value consistent with that of the shell .",
    "we therefore froze @xmath25 at the shell value of @xmath26 @xmath7 for fitting of the cxou j181852.0 - 150213 spectrum .",
    "we used gehrels weighting of the data , appropriate for our count rates @xcite , and binned the data to at least 15 counts per bin , resulting in only 7 bins ( we have no evidence of counts below 1 kev ) .",
    "( churazov weighting [ churazov et al .",
    "1996 ] , an alternative method for low count - rate data , gave similar results . ) a power - law fit gives a photon index @xmath27 .",
    "a blackbody fit with @xmath28 kev is equally acceptable .",
    "the inferred source flux is relatively insensitive to spectral parameters : @xmath29 erg @xmath7 s@xmath9 ( 2  9.5 kev ) giving an x - ray luminosity in that energy range of @xmath30 ergs s@xmath9 .",
    "the total luminosity of a spherical blackbody with @xmath31 kev is @xmath32 erg s@xmath9 .",
    "this luminosity is comparable to that of other point sources associated with snrs , as we discuss below .",
    "the time resolution of ccd full - frame imaging observations is only 3.2 s , so it is impossible to search for the fast periods characteristic of normal pulsars .",
    "furthermore , our sparse data are inadequate for period searches on longer timescales .",
    "the source position ( fit with wavdetect ) is @xmath33 ( j2000 ) .",
    "the quoted ( @xmath34 ) errors reflect the statistical accuracy of the x - ray measurement only .",
    "the statistical error in the x - ray coordinate system registration is also 100 mas ; we measured the position of a bright star visible in x - rays and shifted x - ray coordinates by a total of @xmath35 mas based on its usno ucac2 position @xcite .",
    "the combined @xmath34 statistical error is 150 mas .",
    "no other bright x - ray sources coincident with stars with accurate position are present in the _ chandra _ field of view , so we can not improve the coordinate registration accuracy and check for a potential rotation of _ chandra _ images ( but rotation errors are generally negligible ) .",
    "we searched various catalogs for optical or ir counterparts within @xmath36 of our best - fit position .",
    "there is a star @xmath37 away to the s in the glimpse survey using _ spitzer _ s irac camera ( benjamin et al .",
    "2003 ) , g015.8774 + 00.1966 , and another fainter star @xmath38 to the n ( g015.8781 + 00.1970 ) .",

    "s spatial resolution these two stars blend together , with the x - ray source located between them .",
    "these two stars have no counterparts in the 2mass catalog of point sources , but their blend is faintly visible on images in all ( j , h , and k@xmath45 ) 2mass bands .",
    "nothing is visible at the x - ray source location on either optical sky survey images or in the _ spitzer _ mipsgal survey of the inner galactic plane at 24 and 70 @xmath39 m .",
    "the absence of a bright ir / optical counterpart rules out a stellar coronal origin for the detected x - ray source .",
    "the registration of the glimpse and ucac2 coordinate systems is accurate , as demonstrated by the small ( 200 mas ) difference between glimpse and ucac2 coordinates of the reference star used to align the x - ray image .",
    "this difference is consistent with the internal glimpse @xmath34 error of 100 mas for this star .",
    "the measurement error for g015.8774 + 00.1966 is comparable , so the total @xmath34 statistical error in the coordinate difference measurement between this star and the compact source does not exceed 200 mas . because systematic errors are not expected to exceed statistical errors , the spatial offset between the two glimpse stars and the x - ray source makes them unlikely candidates for the ir counterparts .",
    "their presence in all 2mass band images suggests that they are located much closer than g15.9 + 0.2 .",
    "the high ( @xmath46 @xmath7 ) column density @xmath25 toward g15.9 + 0.2 implies a very high ( @xmath47 ) optical extinction , and expected absorption is high even in the ir ( @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 in j , h , k@xmath45 , [ 3.6 ] , and [ 4.5 ] photometric irac bands , respectively ; we used an ir extinction curve of * ? ? ?",
    "such high extinction would cause reddening by @xmath53 between the j and @xmath54 $ ] bands , making detection of the faint 18@xmath55 ir counterpart in the j band unlikely ( the 2mass point source catalog sensitivity limit in this band is @xmath56 at 99%completeness in regions of low stellar density ) .",
    "the two glimpse stars are seen in all 2mass bands , however , implying less extreme extinction ( and hence a smaller distance than for g15.9 + 0.2 ) .",
    "this and a lack of spatial alignment with the x - ray source strongly suggests that they are just two foreground stars projected against the snr .",
    "an identification of an ir counterpart to the central compact x - ray source in g15.9 + 0.2 is not possible with either 2mass or glimpse data because of high spatial confusion in the galactic plane and the relatively low sensitivity of these surveys .",
    "deep near - ir observations with much better spatial resolution are necessary to identify the ir counterpart to the central compact x - ray source in g15.9 + 0.2 .",
    "explanations other than the neutron star interpretation for cxou j181852.0 - 150213 are unlikely , but can not be excluded without additional observations . at the observed 210 kev x - ray flux of @xmath57 ergs @xmath7 s@xmath9 ,",
    "most x - ray sources seen within the milky way are extragalactic but with a nonnegligible contribution from low - luminosity galactic x - ray sources such as cataclysmic variables @xcite .",
    "we expect only 0.01 sources with equal or larger fluxes in the central region of g15.9 + 0.2 encompassing cxou j181852.0 - 150213 , based on the count rate of 40 such sources per deg@xmath58 measured by @xcite .",
    "the power - law fit to the spectrum of cxou j181852.0 - 150213 excludes at the 90% confidence level the typical value of @xmath59 we would expect for an agn , though a deeper observation would be desirable to confirm this conclusion .",
    "an accurate measurement of the interstellar absorption would be very helpful in establishing the true nature of cxou j181852.0 - 150213 .",
    "unfortunately , the current 90%  confidence ranges for @xmath25 are too broad ( @xmath60 \\times 10^{22}$ ] @xmath7 and @xmath61 \\times 10^{22}$ ] @xmath7 for fits with the black body and the power law , respectively ) to allow us to distinguish between various alternatives .",
    "we may attempt to estimate the age of g15.9 + 0.2  in various ways .",
    "most directly , we assume an average time evolution of the shock radius of @xmath62 , and take @xmath63 pc , and a shock velocity on the order of @xmath64/(1000 km s@xmath9 ) based on measured gas temperatures above 0.7 kev .",
    "( in the absence of electron - ion temperature equilibration , the shock velocity would be higher , and the inferred age lower . ) assuming @xmath65 as for sedov evolution , we then find @xmath66 yr . if the remnant has not fully reached the sedov stage , then @xmath67 and this age is an upper limit . we can also use the sedov relation @xmath68 and an assumed explosion energy @xmath69 erg to estimate @xmath70 yr . from the emission measure for the single - component fit , we estimate an upstream density of @xmath71 @xmath2 assuming a factor of four compression at the shock .",
    "the inferred swept - up mass is then @xmath72 , which is comparable to the expected ejected mass for a core - collapse explosion , as required for the assumption of sedov dynamics to be self - consistent .",
    "however , it is not much larger than that expected ejecta mass , consistent with a young age .",
    "the upstream density and swept - up mass inferred from the solar - abundance component of our two - component fits are very similar to those found from the single - component fit , since the elevated - abundance component contributes little to the total emission measure .",
    "the age may also be estimated from the ionization age and the density as @xmath73 yr .",
    "since the fitted values of the ionization age are less reliable than , say , @xmath74 , it is not surprising that this estimate is somewhat different .",
    "we consider the nature of the point source located inside g15.9 + 0.2 . the compact source in g15.9 + 0.2  has properties that are typical of compact point sources associated with supernova remnants : a blackbody temperature of 0.4 kev and a luminosity of order @xmath8 ergs s@xmath9 @xcite .",
    "an association with the remnant is strengthened because the high absorption of the point source s spectrum implies that it and the remnant are at a comparable distance .",
    "the blackbody temperature , however , is too high for a normal cooling neutron star of any age @xcite , and the low luminosity would require that the emission arise from only about 0.3% of the surface .",
    "this is a common property of the cco [ central compact object ] class ; in particular , thermal emission from small `` hot spots '' on the surface of a neutron star was proposed by pavlov et al .",
    "( 2000 ) to explain the low x - ray luminosity of the cco in cas a. compared to anomalous x - ray pulsars , our point source s luminosity is one to two orders of magnitude too low @xcite , and our data do not allow us to verify either the typical blackbody plus power law spectrum or the long periodicities typical of axps . if we have underestimated the distance by a factor of three to ten , the luminosity would fall in the axp class , but that would require g15.9 + 0.2  to be at least 25 kpc away  an unlikely possibility .",
    "magnetospheric emission from a rotation - powered pulsar may also explain the compact central source in g15.9 + 0.2 .",
    "the observed @xmath75 is typical of such objects , as is a power - law spectrum ( though the slope in this case is somewhat steep ) .",
    "however , if the compact source is an active pulsar , it might be expected to produce a pulsar - wind nebula ( pwn ) .",
    "we see no evidence for extended emission around the source , though , as with other issues , a considerably deeper observation would be desirable .",
    "we consider a cco or rotation - powered pulsar to be viable possibilities for the point source in g15.9 + 0.2 .",
    "if the compact source is indeed associated with g15.9 + 0.2 , a somewhat high space velocity is required assuming that it was born near the geometric center of the shell emission .",
    "its current position is offset by about @xmath76 from a visual estimate of the shell center , which translates to a sky - plane velocity of about @xmath77 km s@xmath9 , where @xmath78 is the remnant age . while high , this velocity is not implausible , since as many as 15% of pulsars",
    "may be born with the implied 3-d spatial velocity required of over 1000 km s@xmath9 ( arzoumanian , chernoff , & cordes 2002 ) ; the cco in pup a has a directly measured velocity of order 1000 km s@xmath9 @xcite .",
    "we conclude that g15.9 + 0.2  is probably no more than a few thousand years old , making it one of the 10 or 20 youngest remnants in the galaxy .",
    "the tidy shell morphology is consistent with a young age , and our spectral analysis indicates enhanced abundances which are likely to be ejecta emission ( although ambient abundances at the galactocentric radius of 2.4 kpc for g15.9 + 0.2  may be somewhat higher than locally ) .",
    "ejecta emission alone does not demand extreme youth since several snrs in the galaxy and the lmc show detectable ejecta even at ages of order @xmath79 yr ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "taken as a whole with the low emitting mass and relatively low ionization timescale we are confident that g15.9 + 0.2  is a young remnant .",
    "the compact object in g15.9 + 0.2  may be a candidate for addition to the very short list of cco s in supernova remnants ( pavlov et al .  [",
    "2004 ] cite six cco s ) .",
    "its age of 10003000 yr is comparable to that of several of the ccos , as is its x - ray luminosity .",
    "the richness of the x - ray spectrum of the shell remnant indicates that a deeper x - ray observation could allow improved inferences on the remnant age and abundances .",
    "it would also clarify the nature of the central source , whether a pwn - less rotation - powered pulsar , a cco , or a background agn ."
