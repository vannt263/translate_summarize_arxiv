    "any entanglement of the two objects tends to rather rapidly decline with time , as it is described by the general phenomenon of quantum - mechanical decoherence @xcite . on the other hand , by exchanging bath bosons the objects do indirectly interact with each other , which , as like any interaction , tends to entangle the two objects .",
    "depending on which of the two effects of the bath is dominant , the two objects in an initially separable common state will either stay separable or develop some amount of entanglement . to find out whether under some given conditions the former or the latter case is realized is generally a difficult theoretical problem which has been addressed in numerous publications during the last decade @xcite .    while there seems to be agreement that for sufficiently small distances entanglement develops under quite general conditions , it is still controversial whether the mechanism under discussion can also generate entanglement between objects in a macroscopic distance . here",
    "we extend and generalize our previous work on the distance dependence of entanglement generation via a bosonic heat bath @xcite .",

    "starting from an lagrangian formulation describing the coupling of two remote harmonic oscillators to a scalar field environment , we derived the langevin equations of motion .",
    "the coupling of the oscillators to the field momenta guaranteed the positivity of the corresponding hamiltonian .",
    "this led to an counter - term which was already proposed in @xcite in order to preserve causality and to avoid runaway solutions .    in case of a free space environment the generated entanglement drops quickly to zero if the distance between the ocsillators exceeds the spatial extension of the individual quantum systems . for one and three spatial dimensions",
    ", we found that this statement is independent of the initial conditions .    in contrary , by imposing boundary conditions on the heat bath it is possible to generate entanglement over distances which exceeds significantly the spatial extension of the quantum systems .",
    "in particular , we considered a waveguide with a transversal extension corresponding to the inverse system frequency .",
    "the boundary condition leads to a van hove peak in the coupling spectral density .",
