    "inclusive charged particle multiplicity distribution had been extensively studied for a long time in hadronic collisions .",
    "the multiplicity distribution characterizes the hadronic final state and provides important insights on the production mechanism of muti - particle final states .",
    "in particular , they are sensitive to the underlying qcd dynamics in hadron - hadron collisions . the previous phenomenological studies of multiplicity distributions at various energies have been done in terms of parameters of the negative binomial distribution ( nbd ) function . although the interpretation of the nbd in terms of particle production is not fully understood , it remarkably described the data at lower energies @xcite .",
    "however , deviations from the nbd were observed at higher energies @xcite which puts constraints on its universal applicability for wider range of energies .",
    "it was followed by two - component model of particle production , interpreting one as the soft and the other as the semi - hard component @xcite .",
    "this led to the description of the data by the weighted combination of two nbd s .",
    "the multiplicity distributions at lhc energies and for all pseudorapidity intervals were well described by this approach @xcite .",
    "however , it was pointed out that the excellent description of multiplicity distributions of hard qcd events in larger @xmath1 window of @xmath2-@xmath2 collisions at 7 tev contradicts the very concept of two component model @xcite .",
    "a very detailed discussion on multiplicity measurements and various approaches can be found at @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we introduce a statistical distribution , namely , the weibull distribution @xcite which we found to describe the @xmath2-@xmath2(@xmath2-@xmath3 ) data at all available energies ranging from isr to lhc .",
    "in addition , this distribution gives an appealing physical interpretation .",
    "many evolving systems in nature exhibit skewed distributions and among them weibull and lognormal distributions appear more ubiquitously in a variety of systems @xcite .",
    "in particular , the weibull distribution is widely used to describe size distribution obtained in diverse fields such as material fragmentation @xcite , cloud droplets @xcite , biological systems @xcite , wind speeds @xcite and extreme value statistics @xcite etc . since final state particle multiplicity can be seen as evolved from initial hadron - hadron collisions",
    ", one can expect to use the weibull distribution to describe the probability of producing charged particles .",
    "the probability distribution of a continuous random variable ` @xmath4 ' in terms of two parameter weibull distribution is given by @xmath5    where @xmath6 is the shape parameter and @xmath7 is the scale parameter of the distribution .",
    "the mean of the distribution is given in terms of @xmath7 and k as , + @xmath8    the description of a physically based derivation of weibull distribution with respect to fragmentation processes can be found at @xcite . in this particular work @xcite",
    ", it was shown that the result of a single event fragmentation leading to a branching tree of cracks in the material that show fractal behaviour can be described by weibull distribution .",
    "this can be related to the mass distribution or particle number distribution developed by fragmentation process .",
    "it was also shown that a particular mass distribution closely resembles the lognormal distribution which was quite popular for sometime describing fragmentation distributions @xcite .",
    "the lognormal distribution also described well the particle multiplicities at isr energies @xcite .",
    "the underlying mechanism of particle production in hadronic collisions as given by current models of particle production is based on the fragmentation of partons into observed hadrons .",
    "irrespective of particular details , most of the models of multi - particle production contain an evolution composed of various steps that are based on previous intermediate steps and are influenced by the same .",
    "the steps involving hard and semi - hard processes are well explained by perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) @xcite while models for soft interactions involve large class of string fragmentation models @xcite .",
    "regardless of differences in details , the cascade nature of models involving fragmentation of partons is apparent and thus one can use weibull distribution to model the basic multiplicity distribution in hadron - hadron collisions .",
    "this also corroborates to the clan model involving particle cascades as mechanism of particle production @xcite .",
    "in the present scenario where we have experimental data on multiplicity distributions in widest range of energies and pseudorapidity intervals , it is worth trying to check whether we can parametrize the data in terms of weibull parameters .",
    "we identify the variable @xmath4 with the charged particle multiplicity and perform the fits to the data points using the chi - square minimization method .",
    "we fitted the multiplicity distribution in @xmath2-@xmath3 and @xmath2-@xmath2 collisions as measured by ua5 experiment at sps energies @xcite and by cms experiments @xcite at lhc energies , respectively .",
    "figure 1(a ) shows the weibull fits to the multiplicity distribution at mid - rapidity for the @xmath2-@xmath3 collisions as measured by ua5 experiments at 200 gev , 540 gev and 900 gev .",
    "the fits to the recent multiplicity distributions in @xmath2-@xmath2 collisions as measured by the cms experiment at 900 gev , 2.36 tev and 7 tev are shown in figure 1(b ) .",
    "as can be seen from the figures , the weibull fit gives an excellent description of the data at all energies .",
    "the values of the parameters and the chi - square of the fit is tabulated in table 1 .",

    "figure 3(a ) shows the mean multiplicity as a function of the center of mass energy . as can be seen from the figure , the variation of mean multiplicity with beam energy can be quantified by the expression + @xmath10 n @xmath11 = * a * + * b * [ ln ( @xmath9 ) ] + * c * [ ln@xmath12 ( @xmath9 ) ] + we also observe that the scale parameter , @xmath7 shows an energy dependence which is similar to that of the mean multiplicity .",
    "this is shown in figure 3(b ) .",
    "we can see from table 1 that the values of the shape parameter @xmath6 do not vary significantly with the center of mass energy . taking this into account and the extrapolated values of the @xmath7 parameter , we predict the multiplicity distribution at mid - rapidity in @xmath2-@xmath2 collisions at the upcoming lhc run at @xmath9 = 5.5 tev ( @xmath7 = 6.88 , k = 1.15 ) and 14.0 tev ( @xmath7 = 9.02 , k = 1.15 ) .",
    "figure 4 depicts the predicted multiplicity distribution at @xmath9 = 5.5 tev and 14.0 tev at mid - rapidity .",
    "the mean multiplicity , @xmath13 , at 5.5 tev and 14.0 tev turns out to be 6.54 and 8.56 , respectively .",
    "the measurement of multiplicity distribution at larger @xmath9 at lhc will be a first test of the further applicability of the weibull distribution and will add credibility to the extrapolation .",

    "we have demonstrated that the weibull distribution provides an excellent description of the multiplicity distributions of inclusive charged particles in hadronic collisions at all available energies and at all pseudorapidity intervals .",
    "this is particularly significant since the weibull distribution arises in cascade processes involving fragmentation of the source .",
    "this leads to a very interesting physics interpretation in terms of current dynamical models of multi - particle production .",
    "because of the universal nature of the parton emission and hadronization process , we claim that the weibull distribution gives the most proper description compared to the previous distributions used in multi - particle production processes .",
