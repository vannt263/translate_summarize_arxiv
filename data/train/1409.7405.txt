    "the formulation of a microscopic picture of black hole production in high  energy particle scattering is crucial for understanding the nature of quantum gravity at ultra - planckian energies . in particular",
    ", this issue is central to the idea that gravity is uv - complete in a non - wilsonian sense @xcite , based on the concept of classicalization @xcite .",
    "the standard ( wilsonian ) approach to uv - completion implies that interactions at higher and higher energies are regulated by integrating - in weakly - coupled degrees of freedom of shorter and shorter wave - lengths . when applied to gravity",
    ", the wilsonian picture would imply that at energies exceeding the planck mass , @xmath7 , the uv - completion must be achieved by new quantum degrees of freedom of wavelength much shorter than the planck length , @xmath8 . in the classicalization approach , instead of introducing new hard quanta ,",
    "the uv - completion is accomplished by means of _ collective _ states composed of a large number @xmath9 of soft gravitons of wavelength @xmath10 @xcite that , in the mean - field approximation , recover the semi - classical behavior of macroscopic black holes @xcite . to put it",
    "shortly , classicalization replaces the hard quanta by a multiplicity of soft ones , which in mean - field ( large @xmath0 ) approximation acquire some properties of classical objects .    in the conventional semi - classical",
    "approach , the current understanding of black hole production is rather unsettling . on one hand",
    ", it is widely accepted that scattering of very highly energetic particles results into a black hole formation .",
    "this acceptance is based on the following argument : according to classical gravity any source of center of mass energy @xmath11 when localized within its gravitational ( schwarzschild ) radius @xmath12 must form a black hole .",
    "this argument is insensitive to the precise nature of the source and in particular should be applicable to elementary particle sources .",
    "thus , it is reasonable to expect that , for example , a two - particle scattering with center of mass energy of the order of the solar mass for an impact parameter less than @xmath13 km , should result into the formation of a solar mass black hole .    on the other hand",
    ", we have to admit that this way of thinking challenges the view about black holes as _ classical _ macroscopic objects , since production of usual macroscopic objects in two - particle collisions is expected to be exponentially - suppressed . for example , in the above thought experiment of two - particle collision at solar mass energy it is exponentially - unlikely for a sun - like object to be produced in the final state instead of a black hole .    what makes black holes so different from ordinary classical objects from the point of view of their microscopic structure ?",
    "of course , one can certainly say that what makes black holes very special is their bekenstein  hawking entropy . however , without a microscopic explanation of entropy creation in two - particle collision , this invocation of the entropy is only making the puzzle more complicated . indeed , it is totally mysterious how an initial two - particle state with zero entropy gains such an enormous entropy in the process of the collision .",
    "the above questions are impossible to answer without having a microscopic theory of the black hole and the corresponding microscopic mechanism of black hole formation in particle scattering processes .",
    "this is why the above questions have not been settled although the study of black hole formation in particle collisions at ultra - planckian energies has been pioneered long ago @xcite and since then has even been taken as far as predicting production of micro black holes at lhc @xcite .",
    "the reason is the lack of a quantum corpuscular picture of black holes which subsequently makes it impossible to figure out how the quantum gravity amplitude translates into the formation of a black hole final state .",
    "the present paper is an attempt to establish the missing link between quantum gravity amplitudes and a corpuscular picture of black holes .",
    "in particular we will provide the link between the corpuscular black hole portrait @xcite on the one hand and the classicalization idea for gravitational scattering amplitudes graviton amplitudes into a ladder loop diagram and coherently summing over different @xmath0 in an eikonal region . ] . by employing the corpuscular black hole picture together with the expressions of graviton scattering",
    "amplitudes both in field and string theory we shall uncover some key elements underlying the microscopic origin of black hole formation .    more concretely :    * guided by non - perturbative input from the corpuscular black hole @xmath0-portrait , we identify the black hole formation regime as the regime of multi - particle creation , in form of @xmath14 graviton scattering amplitudes , with number of soft gravitons in the final state being given by the number of black hole constituents , as suggested by classicalization .",
    "* next , by using powerful field and string - theoretic techniques , in particular scattering equations @xcite and kawai - lewellen - tye ( klt ) relations @xcite , we estimate the perturbative part of these @xmath0-graviton amplitudes . * finally , using the microscopic corpuscular picture of black holes as @xmath0-graviton self - bound states at a quantum critical point , we provide the missing non - perturbative information that enables us to translate the @xmath0-graviton production processes into the black hole formation , both in field and string theory scatterings . *",
    "we provide a cross - check of perturbative @xmath0-graviton amplitudes by applying them to the production of non - black hole type classical configurations described by multi - particle coherent states for which semi - classical estimates must also be valid .",
    "we then match the two results and observe that the exponential suppression expected in the semi - classical theory is indeed reproduced by the perturbative @xmath15 gravity amplitudes .",
    "thus , this matching besides of providing an independent information about the multi - graviton amplitudes , also confirms that the microscopic origin of the black hole dominance , relative to other possible multi - particle final states of the same energy , lies in the quantum criticality of the black hole constituents , which is absent for other classical objects .",
    "* one of the outcomes of our analysis is to show the very different large-@xmath0 behavior of multi - particle amplitudes in gravity in comparison with non - derivatively coupled scalar theories .",
    "the above framework supplies a correct physical picture that among other things explains why the black hole production is the dominant process while the production of other macroscopic multi - particle states is exponentially - suppressed .",
    "the perturbative kinematics that we shall identify has just the right suppression to be compensated by the degeneracy of states at the quantum critical point . in other words , in this multi particle production kinematics , the amplitude itself anticipates what would be the right value for the entropy .",
    "we also observe a nice interplay between the field and string theory amplitudes . in particular , we observe that the string and field theory amplitudes agree whenever the size of the produced black hole is larger than the string length , or equivalently , when the reggeization of the amplitude does not take place .    before moving into the technical part of the paper , to be covered in the following sections , we shall summarize the basic results and their physical meaning . in order to do it",
    "we shall briefly review the non - perturbative input coming from the corpuscular black hole portrait , which being a microscopic quantum theory , provides a crucial missing link between the perturbative @xmath0-graviton production amplitudes and the unitarization of the theory by black hole formation .      in order to make the connection explicit",
    "let us summarize some non - perturbative input coming from the black hole corpuscular quantum portrait @xcite ( for other aspects of this proposal see @xcite and some similarities with this proposal can be found in @xcite ) .",
    "this portrait is based on the idea that the black hole is a composite entity .",
    "its corpuscular constituents are gravitons with the characteristic de broglie wavelength given by the classical size of the black hole , @xmath16 .",
    "that is , the internal ( and near - horizon ) physics of black holes is fully determined by the quantum interaction of gravitons of wave - length @xmath16 .",
    "we shall be interested in the regimes in which the black hole is much heavier than the planck mass @xmath17 , or equivalently , @xmath18 .",
    "the two crucial properties are :    * for macroscopic black holes , the quantum gravitational coupling @xmath19 among the individual corpuscles , @xmath20 is extremely weak . *",
    "the number @xmath0 of constituents of wavelength @xmath16 is : @xmath21    thus , quantum - mechanically a black hole represents a self - bound state of soft gravitons , with a very special interplay between the quantum coupling and the number of constituents , @xmath22 . or equivalently ,",
    "the black hole is a state in which the wave - lengths of gravitons satisfy , @xmath23 .",
    "this property implies that the physics of black holes is similar to that of a graviton bose - einstein condensate at a _ quantum critical point _",
    "this critical point separates the following two phases . for @xmath24 ,",
    "the system is in the phase in which collective graviton - graviton attraction is not enough to form a self - bound - state and the graviton bose - gas is essentially free . for @xmath25",
    "the bound - state is formed .    at this critical point ,",
    "order @xmath0 collective bogoliubov modes become gapless leading to an exponential degeneracy of states , of order @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is some positive constant .",
    "this exponential degeneracy of states is quickly lifted when we deform the system and move away from the critical point @xmath28 . while for the generic attractive bose - gas , moving away from the critical point is possible in both directions , ( @xmath29 or @xmath30 ) , for gravitons this is not the case .",
    "the gravitons can not form a sensible state with @xmath31 . , but maintaining quantum criticality for each @xmath0 .",
    "this is how the corpuscular picture accounts for the hawking radiation . for the purpose of the present paper",
    ", we shall ignore the further evolution of black holes after their formation in the scattering process . ] thus , the viability and the nature of the deformed state depends in which direction we move from the critical point .    for @xmath32 ,",
    "the system of @xmath0 gravitons is essentially free .",
    "the bogoliubov frequencies are positive and bogoliubov levels are separated by a large energy gap ( @xmath33 ) from the lowest level obtained in the free - graviton approximation . due to this , the non - perturbative collective quantum effects can be ignored and the system can be well - approximated by an asymptotic @xmath0-particle eigenstate of the @xmath1-matrix , with no additional non - perturbative information required . hence , non - perturbative physics gives no additional essential input for states with @xmath34 , and the perturbative approximation can be trusted .",
    "in particular , the perturbative amplitudes can be directly applied to the formation of final states with @xmath34 .",
    "however , for the states with @xmath35 the situation is very different .",
    "the bogoliubov frequencies of the @xmath0-graviton state in this regime are complex , with the liapunov exponent being much larger than the inverse size of the system .",
    "this indicates that such state can not be treated as a viable asymptotic state of the @xmath1-matrix , even approximately .",
    "this is remarkable , since translated into the language of @xmath0-graviton perturbative amplitudes , this regime would include the region that violates perturbative unitarity .",
    "thus , non - perturbative @xmath0-graviton physics provides a selection rule that cuts - out from the hilbert space those would - be @xmath0-particle final states that perturbatively violate unitarity .",
    "non - perturbative corpuscular physics is telling us that such states are not part of the physical hilbert space .    the situation is schematically depicted on fig .",
    "the critical point @xmath25 corresponds to the point of black hole formation . at this point",
    "the levels become nearly gapless ( up to @xmath36 resolution ) , and there is a maximal degeneracy of states . for estimating the production rate of @xmath0-graviton state at the critical point",
    ", the perturbative amplitudes must be supplemented by a non - perturbative factor @xmath37 counting the degeneracy of states , which at the same time represents the black hole entropy factor .",
    "the region to the left corresponds to a nearly - free graviton gas .",
    "these states are close to asymptotic @xmath1-matrix states of @xmath0 free gravitons and their creation in two graviton collision can be estimated via perturbative matrix elements , with non - perturbative corrections being small .",
    "the region to the right is excluded by non - perturbative physics .",
    "the above outline summarizes the non - perturbative information that provides the missing link between the perturbative amplitude and unitarization by classicalization via black hole formation .",
    "-3 cm      based on the previous discussion the following picture emerges . in order",
    "to estimate the production rate of a @xmath0-graviton state we need to supplement the perturbative scattering amplitude , that views a given @xmath0-particle state as an asymptotic state of free gravitons , by the non - perturbative information about the viability and quantum degeneracy of this state .",
    "this information either will further enhance the rate or will diminish it depending where the given state is in the @xmath39 plot .",
    "the perturbative amplitudes relevant for describing the production of a black hole of mass @xmath40 are the perturbative amplitudes at center of mass energy @xmath11 in which @xmath0-gravitons of momenta @xmath41 are created in the final state .",
    "as we shall see , the transition probability of this process obtained from the corresponding @xmath1-matrix element scales as , @xmath42 in order to understand the physical picture , we must superimpose the non - perturbative information that we have distillated from the many - body analysis of the @xmath0-graviton state .",
    "namely , the region @xmath43 is excluded as physically not viable due to the presence of complex bogoliubov frequencies and very large liapunov exponent .",
    "it is convenient to rewrite the matrix element in terms of the effective ( t hooft - like ) collective coupling , @xmath44 which parameterizes the strength of the collective gravitational interaction of the @xmath0-graviton system . in this notation",
    "the matrix element becomes @xmath45 this form makes the physics point very transparent . as we just explained above , the region @xmath46 is excluded by non - perturbative physics , because in this region the graviton gas is overcritical .",
    "this includes the region in which perturbative amplitudes would violate unitarity , but multi - particle physics prevents us from going there .",
    "the point @xmath47 is a critical point .",
    "it is allowed both perturbatively as well as non - perturbatively , but the non - perturbative information is very important .",
    "notice , that for @xmath47 , this amplitude has just the right scaling for being compensated by the black hole entropy factor . in the microscopic picture",
    "such a factor is indeed appearing due to the exponential degeneracy of states at the critical point @xmath47 .",
    "for values of @xmath48 , the system is sub - critical .",
    "this means that not only graviton - graviton interaction is weak , @xmath49 , but also that the collective non - perturbative effects are negligible .",
    "thus , the gravitons are essentially free .",
    "the perturbative suppression of the amplitude can not be compensated by the multiplicity of states , because for @xmath50 the degeneracy of bogoliubov levels is lifted and there is no longer an enhancement of the number of states .",
    "therefore , using stirling s formula and the large @xmath0 limit , the production rate of such multi - particle configurations , unlike black holes , is exponentially suppressed : @xmath51 as already mentioned , the exponential suppression factor can be compensated by the black hole entropy .",
    "hence , in this picture , the microscopic explanation of the black hole dominance over other possible multi - particle final states , is that the latter systems are far away from quantum criticality and one must pay an exponential suppression price for their production . in particular",
    ", this explains , why at a given ultra - planckian center of mass energy @xmath11 , the production rate of a non - black hole classical configuration is exponentially - suppressed relative to the production rate of a same - energy black hole .",
    "the reason is that a non - black hole classical configuration of a given mass represents a coherent state of constituents that are softer and have larger occupation number than the constituents of the same mass black hole . as a result such states always are at the subcritical value of the collective coupling , @xmath50 , and no enhancement is available .",
    "we shall discuss this point in more details towards the end of the paper , by estimating a production probability of a particular classical configuration both via the quantum @xmath15 process as well as semi - classically and comparing it to the black hole production rate .",
    "it is instructive to summarize the various regimes of multi - particle production amplitudes , by superimposing the perturbative and non  pertubative inputs . in doing",
    "so we shall use both field theory as well as string theory data , namely , @xmath52 and @xmath0 .",
    "let us consider first the perturbative input .",
    "here we can distinguish two regimes .",
    "* the stringy regime is achieved for @xmath53 this is the regime for which the amplitudes effectively reggeize . * the field theoretic regime is achieved for , @xmath54 in this case , we can use both scattering equations and the klt prescription and the amplitudes computed within field and string theory agree .    on the above perturbative information we need to superimpose the non - perturbative input coming from the black hole s corpuscular portrait .",
    "this gives the following three regimes    * the regime of black hole formation at the critical point @xmath47 , @xmath55 in this regime the perturbative amplitudes must be supplemented by the information about the exponential multiplicity of the final states .",
    "* sub - critical regime @xmath56 , @xmath57 in this regime the bogoliubov degeneracy is lifted and the perturbative amplitudes are better and better applicable as we move towards @xmath58 .",
    "* over - critical regime @xmath59 , @xmath60 in this regime , the @xmath0-graviton states have very high liapunov exponents and imaginary bogoliubov frequencies and therefore are not legitimate final states .",
    "the overlap of the perturbative and non - perturbative information is summarized in the plots on fig . 2 and 3 , where various perturbative and non - perturbative regimes are plotted on the @xmath61 axis .",
    "in order to allow the variation of @xmath61 , we vary @xmath0 while keeping @xmath62 and @xmath63 fixed . in this way",
    ", we scan all possible multi - graviton final states of the desired kinematical regime for the fixed center of mass energy .    the first plot on fig .",
    "2 describes various regions on the @xmath61-axis from purely field - theoretic perspective of non - perturbative @xmath0-graviton physics .",
    "the second plot , describes the interplay between the string - theoretic and field - theoretic domains from purely perturbative perspective .",
    "notice , that after translating ( [ stringyregime ] ) in terms of the string coupling , the transitional point between the string and field - theory regimes is marked by @xmath64 .",
    "this makes a nice physical sense .",
    "specifically , the stringy regime becomes important when the gravitational coupling between the constituents becomes weaker than the string coupling .",
    "the same plot indicates the obvious point , that for any fixed value of @xmath63 , and for sufficiently large @xmath0 the field theory regime becomes a good approximation .",
    ".,title=\"fig : \" ] -3 cm    fig .",
    "3 described the result of super - imposing the above two perturbative and non - perturbative plots for two different cases , @xmath65 and @xmath66 respectively . in the first case , there is a region , @xmath67 , in which on one hand unitarity is perturbatively violated in field theory and on the other hand perturbative string theory corrections are not effective for restoring it . in this domain unitarity",
    "is restored by non - perturbative collective @xmath0 graviton physics described above , which excludes this region as unphysical .",
    ".,title=\"fig : \" ] -3 cm    in the second plot on fig .",
    "3 , the choice of parameters is such that perturbative string theory and field theory amplitudes crossover without violating unitarity for any @xmath61 .",
    "of course , for fixed @xmath63 and @xmath68 , if we allow @xmath0 to grow , the situation of the first plot is sooner or later achieved . in other words , for sufficiently high @xmath2 , there is always a window of @xmath61 for which some perturbatively - allowed would - be final states violate unitarity .",
    "the unitarity in this window is only restored by classicalization , which excludes it from the hilbert space due to non - perturbative corpuscular physics of the @xmath0-graviton system .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we will specify some of the technical steps concerning the computation of the gravitational scattering amplitudes for a large number of gravitons in the final state in a specific high energy regime called classicalization regime .",
    "together with other high energy limits the classicalization regime will be defined in section 3 . in section 4",
    "we will present the calculation of the gravitational scattering amplitude exhibiting the details to determine the on  shell scattering amplitude and derive in this way for a large number of @xmath0 an explicit expression for the transition probability of two particles into @xmath69 . in section 5",
    "an analogous computation is presented for the case of @xmath0point open and closed string scattering amplitudes in the high energy limit of classicalization . in particular , we show how the relevant combinatorial factor can be derived by using the methods of scattering equations yielding the correct result for the field theory factor appearing in the previous section . in the remaining sections",
    "we will provide the interpretation of the results for the scattering amplitudes in the light of the corpuscular picture of black holes together with the idea of classicalization . more concretely ,",
    "in section 6 we extend the discussion of sections 1.2 and 1.3 by explaining in which way the full gravitational scattering amplitude is built as an overlap between the perturbative @xmath0-graviton amplitude , calculated in sections 4 and 5 , and the non - perturbative projection between the @xmath0-graviton state and the black hole state , which is provided by the entropy factor @xmath70 .",
    "this discussion about the perturbative insights into non - perturbative physics is continued in section 7 , where we also compare the gravitational case with the scalar @xmath71 theory .",
    "finally , section 8 contains the outlook of the paper , including also a speculation about the planar limit of gauge theories with a large number of colors @xmath72 and the limit of a large number @xmath0 of gravitons , considered in this paper .",
    "as discussed above , the basic idea of this paper is to describe some key aspects of classicalization and black hole formation in the light of high - energy scattering amplitudes with a large number  @xmath0 of soft , elementary quanta in the final state .",
    "as already indicated , the phenomenon of classicalization implies a particular high  energy limit of the corresponding @xmath0-particle scattering amplitudes . specifically we shall analyze the tree - level scattering in the kinematics of @xmath73 particles , with @xmath0 being arbitrarily large and with the high center of mass energy @xmath74 uniformly distributed over the @xmath69 particles in the final state .",
    "we will call this particular kinematical limit theclassicalization \" or eikonal regge limit .     into @xmath69 particles .",
    "the blob can be thought of as the sum over all feynman diagrams at tree level . ]    since it is quite involved to compute the large @xmath0 field theory amplitudes via standard feynman diagrams we will employ novel methods in amplitude technology called on - shell methods which were developed over the recent years .",
    "see @xcite and references therein for an overview of the vast progress .",
    "in addition , we make profit of deriving tree  level amplitudes by the scattering equations @xcite .",
    "concretely , we shall perform the following computations with the following main new results :    * field theory gravity amplitudes in the classicalization regime : we first compute the @xmath73 graviton amplitudes for arbitrary @xmath0 in the eikonal regge high  energy kinematics . in order to derive these amplitudes we use a version of the klt relations for so - called maximally helicity violating ( mhv ) graviton amplitudes .",
    "these are amplitudes with two negative helicity gravitons and the rest positive .",
    "the scattering equations allow us to fix the combinatorial factors of these amplitudes . from these amplitudes",
    "we extract key information about the underlying unitarization mechanism , based on the dominance of this kinematics , as well as on the perturbative suppression factors .",
    "these perturbative results provide a strong support both to the physics picture of unitarization by black hole formation as well as to the microscopic picture of black holes as bound states of gravitons .",
    "this picture is completed once we superimpose these perturbative results with non  perturbative information derived from the many body physics of graviton condensates . *",
    "secondly we shall compute the high  energy open / closed string tree level scattering amplitudes for arbitrary ( large ) number of external legs .",
    "furthermore we will compare the string amplitudes with field theory amplitudes and discuss the classicalization regime in both cases .",
    "in particular , for fixed @xmath11 , the two agree for sufficiently large @xmath0 .",
    "however , depending on the value of the string coupling , intermediate domains of @xmath0 are possible when either perturbative stringy effects as reggeization or non - perturbative field theory black hole regimes dominate and exclude certain regions .",
    "one generic observation is that the regions that are not unitary in perturbative treatment are cut - out by non - perturbative corpuscular black hole physics . on the basis of the concrete form of the string amplitudes we shall make some remarks about some hidden color kinematics duality that at the threshold of black hole formation appears to be reminiscent of the well known gauge gravity duality .",

    "the circle with the wiggly double lines depicts the bose - einstein condensate nature of the black hole . ]",
    "in this section we first review the various high  energy limits and their relevance .",
    "generically , for @xmath0 particle scattering amplitudes there are @xmath76 kinematic invariants [ kininv ] s_ijs_i , j= ( k_i+k_j)^2=2  k_ik_j  . however , the number of independent invariants depends on the number of space ",

    "in the sequel , however , we shall not be concerned with this issue and our results are independent of this number .      for the high  energy limits of the four  point amplitude",

    "note that the phase factors do not scale with @xmath69 since the scaling cancels .",
    "let us now turn to gravity amplitudes . to use the klt relation we need to know how the momentum kernel scales in this regime : its entries roughly scale as @xmath148_{n-1}\\sim \\left(\\frac { s}{(n-2)^2}\\right)^{n-3}\\ ] ] as all particle labels involved in the momentum kernel belong to outgoing particles .",
    "combing this with the scaling of the yang - mills amplitudes via , leads to the following scaling for the gravity mhv amplitude @xmath149 where the function @xmath150 is a complicated double sum over the phase factors arising when one rewrites the spinor brackets in terms of mandelstam invariants and sums over the different permutations in the klt sum .",

    "naively , the behavior of the gravity amplitude would then also be more complicated as a consequence .",
    "however , due to bose symmetry the overall result is independent of the choice of incoming momenta and the seemingly more complex scaling will cancel in the sum over terms in giving back equation .",
    "the next step is to go from the on - shell scattering amplitude above to the physical ( dimensionless ) transition probability of two particles scattering into @xmath69 , i.e. to @xmath153 ( cf . equation ( 1.1 ) ) . in order to do so",

    "as already advertised in the introduction this physical amplitude starts to unitarize for @xmath0 given by @xmath160 .",
    "moreover the amplitude at this kinematical unitarity threshold is suppressed by @xmath161 anticipating at this perturbative level exactly the suppression factor that can be compensated by the entropy of a black hole with mass @xmath162 .",
    "the high  energy behavior ( i.e. energies much larger than the string scale @xmath163 ) of perturbative string amplitudes is rather different than that of field  theory amplitudes . while the high",

    "for such a monochromatic wave , the classical energy per wave - length - cubed is @xmath340 . in order to be both in a weak gravity regime as well as in the domain of semi - classical approximation",
    ", we shall demand that the schwarzschild radius corresponding to this energy is much shorter than the wave - length , @xmath341 . or",
    "equivalently , @xmath342 the leading behavior of the transition probability to such a classical wave can be reliably estimated in the semi - classical approximation , and is given by , @xmath343 where the quantity in the exponent is the euclidean action , @xmath344 .    in order to make contact between the perturbative matrix element ( [ pert ] ) and the semi - classical one ( [ prob2towave ] )",
    ", we have to translate the monochromatic wave in the quantum language . in this language ,",
    "the wave is a coherent state @xmath345 of gravitons of momenta @xmath346 and the average occupation number @xmath347 , @xmath348 where @xmath349 are @xmath294-graviton fock states of momenta @xmath346 .",
    "notice , that the condition ( [ weakl ] ) is simply @xmath48 , signalling that we are in a weak - coupling regime in which gravitons can be treated as free and thus the perturbative amplitudes must be fully applicable .    by choosing @xmath338 and @xmath339 appropriately",
    ", we can make the parameter @xmath0 of the coherent state arbitrarily - large for an arbitrary choice of @xmath80 . in this way",
    ", we can create an _ arbitrarily - classical _ wave of arbitrarily low or high energy .",
    "in particular , @xmath80 can be chosen to be ultra - planckian or well below the planck scale , without affecting the validity of the classical approximation for the final monochromatic wave .",
    "this fact suggests that for the estimate of the transition probability we should be able to reliably use both semi - classical as well as perturbative quantum amplitudes , and the two must match to the leading order .",
    "the rest of the analysis is straightforward .",
    "we need to estimate the perturbative @xmath1-matrix element @xmath350 using ( [ pert ] ) and match it with ( [ prob2towave ] ) .",
    "notice , that since the fock states that enter in the coherent state ( [ coh ] ) correspond to different occupation numbers of the same fixed momentum ( or wavelength ) gravitons , for each choice of this wave - length only one fock state from this sum matches the center of mass energy of the initial @xmath351-graviton states .",
    "this is the state @xmath352 with @xmath353 .",
    "correspondingly , only the transition to this particular state is possible .",
    "that is , @xmath354 , where @xmath355 is given by ( [ pert ] ) .",
    "we thus obtain , @xmath356 matching this expression with ( [ prob2towave ] ) reproduces the exponential suppression of the classical state .",
    "the factor @xmath357 reveals an extra suppression , due to weak coupling .",
    "this is expected , since the transition must be absent in a free theory .",
    "this extra suppression is absent for the case of black hole production , since @xmath358 , which is one of the reasons of black hole dominance .",
    "the other , as explained , is the enhancement by an @xmath359 factor due to multiplicity of states at the quantum - critical point .",
    "we would like to stress the possible subtleties of the perturbative framework we are working in and its validity for black hole physics . _ a priory _ , it is not obvious that signatures of black hole formation in two - particle scattering can be captured by perturbative amplitudes .",
    "in particular , by tree - level amplitudes that are suppressed by the powers of some weak coupling , such as , the gravitational or string coupling .",
    "it could happen that no single class of feynman diagrams describing such weak coupling expansion can be pin - pointed as a source of black hole formation in two - particle scattering .",
    "the answer instead could require either a full re - summation of infinite number of diagrams , or even inclusion of contributions of yet unknown non - perturbative processes .",
    "so what makes us think that black hole formation can be captured perturbatively ?    first , an encouragement comes from the fact that our results allow to create a link between the production of black holes and other classical objects , composed out of softer gravitons than a would - be black hole at a given @xmath11 .",
    "in other words , we identify a kinematical regime in which the questions of reliability of black hole production description is linked , with the reliability of the description of production of other classical objects , whose quantum composition can be identified beyond any reasonable doubt .",
    "however , we are going beyond this link by postulating that there exists a part of the information that can be extracted from a class of perturbative diagrams within a properly identified kinematical regime .",
    "these are the @xmath14 transition processes .",
    "what we are suggesting is that in the process of black hole formation , which in general is expected to be a highly non - perturbative phenomenon , there exists a well - defined division between the contribution that can be interpreted in the language of perturbative diagrams and the fully non - perturbative one .",
    "what is important is that the knowledge of the latter contribution is crucial for identifying the former one . in other words , without having the non - perturbative input that black holes represent a @xmath0-graviton bound - state it would be impossible to look for the perturbative counterpart of the process in the form of @xmath14 scattering .",
    "thus , we are postulating that it is meaningful to represent , schematically , the black hole formation probability as the sum over probabilities , @xmath360 with each member of the sum representing a product of perturbative and non - perturbative matrix elements . here",
    "the sum over @xmath361 runs over non - perturbative black hole states @xmath362 , with their multiplicity scaling as @xmath70 . of course",
    ", one can say that such a scaling is expected from the black hole entropy counting , and one does not need any microscopic theory for postulating it .",
    "this is certainly true , but solely knowledge of the multiplicity of unknown hypothetical micro - states is useless for understanding the mechanism of black hole production .    the new ingredient is contained in the identification of the projection @xmath363 of these states on a @xmath0-graviton state .",
    "it is this identification what enables to conclude that black hole formation process includes a perturbative part in the form of the perturbative amplitude of @xmath0-graviton production . of course",
    ", drawing such a connection is impossible without a microscopic theory and this is where the black hole corpuscular portrait enters in our analysis . since in this picture black hole",
    "represents an @xmath0 soft graviton bound - state at the critical point , it naturally suggest a significant projection on an out - state of @xmath0 free gravitons of wave - lengths equal to the ones of the black hole constituents .    the subtle point here is not in accepting such an overlap between the @xmath0 graviton state and a black hole state , but rather in the perturbative part of the probability , which assumes that we can reliably estimate the @xmath0-graviton production in perturbation theory .",
    "viability of the latter assumption has nothing to do with a particular microscopic theory of a black hole and , as shown above , is generic for perturbative computation of the production rate of arbitrary @xmath0-particle states in two - particle collision , including the ones not even remotely related to black holes .",
    "this separation of the issues is crucial for understanding the framework we are working in .    in order to explain why this latter assumption is so subtle ,",
    "let us consider the two - particle scattering at ultra - planckian center of mass energy from a fully non - perturbative corpuscular point of view .",
    "in fact , we can very quickly realize that the initial state can be represented as a genuine two - particle state only at _ infinite _ separation . at finite separation , @xmath338 , the center of mass energy sources a newtonian gravitational field @xmath364 , which in the corpuscular language itself represents a coherent state of longitudinal gravitons in which the gravitons of wavelength @xmath338 have average occupation number @xmath365 @xcite .",
    "schematicaly , we can write this in the following form , @xmath366 where @xmath367 are the fock states with definite occupation numbers of longitudinal gravitons of wavenumber @xmath274 and the summation is taken over all possible distributions of @xmath368-s .",
    "the function @xmath369 represents the data that determine the average occupation number of gravitons of wave number @xmath274 in the given coherent state .",
    "the function @xmath370 is exponentially decaying for @xmath371 .",
    "the dominant contribution to gravitational self - energy , @xmath372 is coming from the modes of momenta @xmath373 , with their number being , @xmath374 .",
    "notice that this number coincides with the number of black hole constituent gravitons .",
    "the only difference is that the gravitons that are present in the initial state have extremely long wave - lengths and their collective coupling @xmath61 is negligible .",
    "correspondingly , neither they contribute significantly to the energy , nor are they capable of forming a bound - state .",
    "nevertheless , the message is that an ultra - planckian initial state for any finite value of @xmath338 is secretly a multi - particle state that on top of the two source particles contains @xmath0 additional gravitons .",
    "as the system evolves in time , decreasing the separation between the initial two source particles , @xmath338 , the multi - particle nature of the initial state becomes more and more apparent .",
    "the peak of the dominant graviton distribution in the coherent state evolves towards the higher momenta .",
    "the non - perturbative @xmath0-particle physics becomes fully important for @xmath375 of order @xmath376 . at this stage @xmath61",
    "becomes order one signalling that the constituent gravitons are driven into the quantum critical point at which they form the bound - state and bogoliubov modes become gapless .",
    "what we are suggesting in our current analysis is that the above fully non - perturbative evolution can be substituted by a perturbative creation of @xmath0-graviton state and its projection on a black hole state using the non - perturbative input from the microscopic theory .",
    "the fact that we are able to cross - check the result by normalizing the amplitude to the creation of a generic @xmath0-particle state , indicates that the failure of the above program would imply a problem in the description of the production of the @xmath0-graviton state in perturbation theory , rather than in the projection of such state into a black hole quantum state .",
    "it is interesting that at the level of the studied kinematic regimes the perturbative treatment comes up with the adequate physical results .",
    "one of the outcomes of our analysis is to reveal a special property of multi - particle gravitational amplitudes in contrast to similar amplitudes in _ non - derivatively _ interacting bosonic theories , such as , for example , in a self - interacting scalar theory @xmath377 , with a non - derivative coupling @xmath378 .",
    "it has been known for some time @xcite that multi - scalar production amplitudes in such theories exhibit ( at least at the threshold of producing @xmath0 on - shell massive scalars of mass @xmath379 out of some initial few - particle state , the simplest being a single virtual boson of energy @xmath380 ) a factorial growth , @xmath381 and a corresponding growth of the cross - section , @xmath382 where we have omitted the phase - space and other irrelevant factors . in non - derivatively",
    "coupled theory the tree - level coupling @xmath378 is momentum - independent and the factorial growth violates unitarity at sufficiently large @xmath0 .",
    "perturbation theory breaks down for @xmath383 .",
    "the physical implications of this phenomenon is not fully understood .",
    "it may signal inapplicability of the perturbative treatment or even an inconsistency of the theory . since , this question is not the focus of our paper we shall not discuss it further , but rather confront the growth of the scalar amplitude with the analogous factorial behavior in gravity and stress the important differences .",
    "notice that the equation ( [ aphi4 ] ) is very similar to ( [ pert ] ) with the difference that @xmath19 of gravity is replaced by the scalar self - coupling @xmath378 .",
    "however , the momentum dependence of the gravitational coupling , @xmath384 , makes a dramatic difference .",
    "in particular , for large @xmath0 it overpowers the factorial growth of diagrams .",
    "the resulting amplitude in gravity is exponentially - suppressed as opposed to the factorially - exploding counterpart in non - derivative @xmath71 theory .",
    "notice , that the perturbative tree - level amplitudes in gravity and in non - derivative scalar theory have problems in the opposite domains of @xmath0 , with the dramatic difference that in the problematic domain gravity amplitudes are cured by black holes , whereas in @xmath71 theory no obvious helper is visible .    on the other hand , in @xmath71 theory scattering for @xmath385 is unitary , whereas for gravity tree - level unitarity is violated for small @xmath0 and large @xmath2 .",
    "however , as discussed above , in gravity this very domain is excluded by the black hole quantum portrait , due to collective effects of graviton bose - gas .",
    "thus , the black hole physics prevents us from entering there .",
    "in contrast , the domain @xmath386 in gravity is perturbatively - safe , since in this domain @xmath387 , whereas the analogous domain in @xmath71 violates unitarity . in particular , as we have seen , in gravity this large-@xmath0 behavior takes care of the exponential suppression in the production of classical configurations composed of gravitons softer than the schwarzschild radius of a @xmath11 mass black hole .",
    "the property of suppression of multi - particle amplitudes in @xmath388 domain is expected to be shared by other derivatively - coupled theories , which are also considered as candidates for classicalization .",
    "for example , in a theory @xmath389 the effective quartic coupling scales as the fourth power of momentum and the multi - particle production must be suppressed in the domain @xmath390 .",
    "the former discussion on the factorial growth of the cross section for scalar theories of type @xmath71 sheds light on how the perturbative amplitudes can foresee the non perturbative existence of black holes .",
    "the simplest way to identify non perturbative physics within perturbation theory is to look for the limits of applicability of perturbation theory .",
    "as previously discussed a key aspect of the approach to quantum gravity based on classicalization lies in replacing ultra ",
    "planckian @xmath391 strongly coupled processes , violating unitarity already at tree level , by @xmath15 weakly coupled processes where the total center of mass energy @xmath11 is equi - distributed into the @xmath0 soft outgoing gravitons .",
    "irrespectively how large is @xmath11 the corresponding process at tree level is , for large enough @xmath0 , well defined perturbatively .",
    "indeed , all vertices involved in the process can be made , tuning @xmath0 , arbitrarily small .",
    "however , there is a prize that we need to pay when we proceed in this way , namely the growth of the number of tree feynman diagrams contributing to the @xmath15 process .",
    "this growth is at the origin of the factorials discussed in the previous subsection .",
    "the interplay between the effective coupling constant and the growth of the number of diagrams sets the regime where weakly coupled perturbative analysis at tree level is reliable .    to fix ideas",
    "let us consider a generic bosonic theory where amplitudes @xmath15 for arbitrary large value of @xmath0 are not forbidden by any form of the selection rule .",
    "to characterize the theory we need to know the number of vertices involved in the process , the number @xmath392 of tree level diagrams and the value of the effective coupling @xmath393 entering into each vertex . if we assume @xmath0 to be large enough and we consider a three point vertex the number of vertices will be order @xmath0 and the number of trees will grow with @xmath0 as ( up to exponents unimportant for this discussion ) , where the factor @xmath394 depends on the specific assumption that the vertex is a three point vertex .",
    "incidentally , note that the factor @xmath395 is consistent with the similar factor appearing in the string result ( [ esti ] ) presented at the end of section 5 . ]",
    "@xmath396 consequently the cross section will behave as , @xmath397 for @xmath398 .",
    "note that for a @xmath71 theory we get ( [ crossphi4 ] ) ) .",
    "the leading dependence of @xmath399 on the center of mass momentum is implicitly contained in the effective coupling @xmath398 .",
    "the effective coupling is defining the interaction in the underlying lagrangian .",
    "this interaction term can define a relevant or an irrelevant operator depending on the spin of the bosonic field involved in the process .",
    "the @xmath71 case corresponds to the marginal case . if it is a relevant operator ( as it will be with a @xmath400 type of theory ) then the effective coupling @xmath19 will depend on the corresponding momentum transfer @xmath401  which for the classicalization kinematics ( where @xmath11 is equi - distributed ) is of order @xmath402  as @xmath403 .",
    "however , if the interaction vertex defines an irrelevant operator , as it is the case for the three - point vertex of gravitons , @xmath19 goes as @xmath404 . in this case",
    "we obtain @xmath405 that is precisely what we have reached for these amplitudes both in the klt approach ( supplemented by the results from scattering equations ) as well as in the string approach .",
    "once we have fixed the effective coupling and its dependence both on @xmath2 and @xmath0 we can set the limits of perturbation theory .",
    "the perturbative approach to multi particle scattering is reliable only if @xmath406 which leads to @xmath407 although the amplitude in absolute terms may not violate unitarity , the turning point indicates that some non - perturbative information must be included for the corresponding value of @xmath0 .",
    "thus , for gravity the bound ( [ boundnonp ] ) implies .",
    "@xmath408 this is a very interesting result since this bound is telling us that @xmath0 should be larger or equal to the corresponding black hole entropy ( equivalently number of constituents ) of a black hole with mass equal to the center of mass energy .",
    "it is instructive to see how the limits of applicability of perturbation theory are teaching us about the underlying physics . for large value of @xmath2 and @xmath0",
    "much smaller than @xmath2 in planck units , the amplitude is obviously violating unitarity . at this point",
    "you can wonder if increasing the value of @xmath0 for the same value of @xmath2 will improve the situation .",
    "what you observe is that while you are in the regime with @xmath0 much smaller than @xmath2 , increasing @xmath0 is not making the situation better but worst . in other words in this regime",
    "the ratio ( [ boundnonp ] ) is bigger than one .",
    "this perturbative situation changes only when you reach a critical value of @xmath0 where the ratio ( [ boundnonp ] ) reaches one and starts to decrease .",
    "the regime where the ratio ( [ boundnonp ] ) is bigger than one is precisely the regime corresponding , in the black hole portrait , to the strong coupling regime with @xmath61 larger than one .",
    "thus , whenever we violate the above perturbative bound we enter into a regime that requires , in order to be analyzed , non - perturbative input .",
    "nicely enough this regime precisely agrees with the region @xmath409 , i.e. , with the region that is cut out using the non perturbative corpuscular information of the black hole portrait .",
    "moreover the turning point happens precisely when @xmath0 is equal to the black hole entropy .",
    "this makes explicit the way perturbation theory anticipates not only the non perturbative black hole formation but also , as already stressed many times , its corpuscular constituency . in other words the perturbative analysis , both in field theory as well as in string theory , sets the limit of applicability of perturbation theory in the classicalization kinematics precisely at the point where the system of outgoing gravitons reaches the dynamical condition defining the critical point of the black hole portrait .",
    "furthermore perturbation theory encodes information about the black hole existence , despite the fact that for corresponding value of @xmath0 the amplitude is still unitary in the absolute sense .",
    "finally let us stress the difference with the case where the three point interaction vertex is a relevant operator .",
    "in this case the former bound becomes @xmath410 .",
    "this means that we do nt have problems for arbitrarily large @xmath2 and small @xmath0 but instead for large @xmath0 and small @xmath2 .",
    "this is a key difference with the case of irrelevant operators i.e with the case of gravity .",
    "in previous sections we have collected some results regarding tree level @xmath0 graviton amplitudes in the eikonal - regge kinematical regime . in this summary section",
    "we shall complement the discussion , already initiated in the introduction , on the physical meaning of these findings .    in the field theory context",
    "we have focused our attention on two key issues .",
    "first of all , we have analyzed how for ultra - planckian values of @xmath11 the amplitude is smoothed - out once we increase the number @xmath0 of outgoing gravitons .",
    "this kinematic mechanism of unitarization  which is at the core of the idea of classicalization  would be nevertheless completely useless if the contribution of this kinematics to the total scattering rate were very much suppressed .",
    "so our second task has been to extract from the concrete expressions of the amplitudes this suppression factor . by using the scattering equations in the classicalization limit",
    "this has been accomplished for graviton amplitudes ( [ newgr ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ esti ] ) . for large @xmath0",
    "the graviton scattering matrix element in this kinematic regime depends on @xmath2 and @xmath0 as @xmath411 . from this expression",
    "we observe that the amplitude starts to be smoothed - out for @xmath412 .",
    "we can interpret this value of @xmath0 as the unitarity threshold for the given value of @xmath2 .",
    "in other words , a slower growth of @xmath0 in the double - scaling limit ( @xmath413 ) violates unitarity . indeed , parameterizing the scaling as @xmath414 , the matrix element in large @xmath0 scales as @xmath415 , which for @xmath416 blows up for sufficiently large @xmath0",
    "however , notice that the final states obtained in unitarity - violating scaling are precisely the ones excluded by non - perturbative corpuscular physics , since they correspond to the over - critical region of the graviton bound - state , with @xmath59 , since @xmath417 .",
    "the key lesson we learn from the expression of the amplitude is how much this concrete kinematical configuration contributes to the total amplitude .",
    "indeed , for this threshold value the suppression factor is @xmath418 .",
    "the amplitudes with faster growing values of @xmath0 with @xmath2 are more suppressed , while the slower - growing ones , that would naively violate unitarity , are excluded by the non - perturbative many - body physics of soft gravitons .",
    "as we have discussed , the physics interpretation of the previous result is quite transparent .",
    "the value of @xmath0 at which the amplitude starts to smooth - out is precisely what would be the bekenstein  hawking entropy of a black hole of mass equal to the center of mass energy , i.e. , @xmath11 .",
    "moreover , the suppression factor is precisely what would be the multiplicity of states of such a black hole according to the corpuscular quantum portrait .",
    "the crucial information we extract from here is how the amplitude reveals the microscopic structure of the black hole as being composed of the @xmath0 soft outgoing gravitons .",
    "this is precisely , as already stressed in the introduction , what we expect from the @xmath0-portrait of black holes as composite systems of soft gravitons .",
    "moreover , the kinematical conditions of the outgoing gravitons for @xmath412 are the ones determining the critical point of the graviton bose - einstein condensate .",
    "it is this criticality what accounts for the entropy needed to compensate the exponential suppression factor in the form of a large multiplicity of gapless bogoliubov modes .",
    "as already argued the regime with @xmath0 larger than the threshold value determined by the perturbative amplitude corresponds to @xmath419 and although is not violating unitarity is very much suppressed . from the microscopic point of view",
    "we understand the large suppression of this multi - particle kinematics as due to the fact that the system defined by the outgoing gravitons is far from the critical point with a well - defined finite gap for the bogoliubov modes .",
    "the regime with small number of outgoing gravitons violates unitarity and corresponds from the microscopic point of view to the strong collective - coupling regime @xmath420 .",
    "this is the regime that the microscopic non - perturbative dynamics is cutting out and this is the key of the unitarization mechanism through the black hole formation .",
    "but what have we learned from the string theory amplitudes in this kinematical regime ? in this eikonal - regge kinematics it is easy to identify when purely stringy effects become relevant .",
    "indeed , the effective center of mass energy @xmath421 between two consecutive final state gravitons goes like @xmath422 .",
    "thus , this partial contribution to the total amplitude becomes sensitive to string effects if @xmath423 for @xmath163 being the string mass scale .",
    "in such a case each of the @xmath128 vertical graviton propagators ( see fig .",
    "7 ) should be effectively reggeized .",
    "in other words , in this multi regge kinematics and in the regime ( [ one ] ) , we should effectively dress each propagator with the regge factor @xmath424 leading to an overall contribution of the order of @xmath425 with @xmath2 measured in string units .",
    "this estimate is to be compared with the result ( [ highgg ] ) from the string theory computation .      consequently , the field theory computation is reliable if @xmath426 . in this case",
    "the factor coming from the reggeization of the exchanged gravitons becomes one .",
    "in section 5 we have considered both situations in the double - scaling limit of both @xmath2 and @xmath0 large . in this double - scaling limit",
    "stringy reggeization effects become relevant for @xmath402 larger than one ( case ( i ) ) while they are suppressed for @xmath402 smaller than one ( case ( ii ) ) ( in both cases written in string units ) .",
    "notice that the concrete value of @xmath164 setting the regime where string effects are relevant only enters , in this kinematics , in the form of the formerly - described reggeization of the exchanged gravitons .    in order to compare the field theoretic and the string theoretic pictures we need the relation between the two relevant mass scales , namely @xmath68 and @xmath164 given in eq .",
    "( [ planck ] ) . with this relation",
    "we can , as described already in the introduction , consider different regimes . in the regime where @xmath427 stringy effects due to the reggeization of the exchanged gravitons starts to be relevant before the created soft gravitons organize themselves into a field theoretic self - sustained condensate i.e. in the weak coupling regime @xmath428 .",
    "for @xmath429 instead the string effects are relevant only in the regime where the outgoing gravitons would be strongly coupled and therefore we could wonder if these regge effects tame the field theoretical violation of unitarity .    however , the interesting value at which we want to focus our attention is @xmath430 , i.e. , when the threshold of string effects exactly matches the field - theoretic critical point of black hole formation . for this special point",
    "we have , @xmath431 what is the meaning of this relation ?",
    "the answer is simply that this value corresponds to the well known string - black hole correspondence .",
    "the previous discussion sheds however a new light on this correspondence as determining the point where  for given kinematics ",
    "the threshold of string effects coincides with the critical point of the graviton bose - einstein condensate . or ,",
    "as already stressed in the introduction , this is the situation when at the would - be critical point the string coupling between the constituent quanta becomes equally important as the gravitational coupling @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "finally , we would like to put forward a slightly more speculative observation .",
    "until this point although we have been working within the general frame ( _ closed @xmath432 open @xmath433 open _ ) or equivalently ( _ gravity @xmath432 ym@xmath434 _ ) we have not used in any explicit way the information about the color of the ym gauge sector . what do we get if we naively use it ?",
    "as it is customary , we have to use @xmath435 , cf .",
    "( [ opcl ] ) .",
    "moreover , if we think of the open string , as originally pointed out by t  hooft , as the planar limit of the gauge theory , we should identify @xmath436 for @xmath72 being the rank of the gauge group .",
    "if we naively combine these two ingredients we arrive to the formal `` color - kinematics '' relation , @xmath437 of course in this formal relation @xmath0 refers to the number of created soft gravitons and thus it must be interpreted with a bit of care .",
    "note that we arrive to this formal relation only when we put ourselves at the threshold of black hole formation . in these conditions",
    "the former relation between @xmath0 and @xmath72 becomes very reminiscent of the gauge / gravity duality relations . indeed what this relation does is to identify the black hole entropy @xmath0 with what would be the @xmath27function of the gauge theory .",
    "incidentally , an information that we have never used in our computation of graviton amplitudes .",
    "pushing a bit forward the analogy , it seems to indicate a deep connection , taking place at the black hole threshold formation , between the hidden chan - paton factors dressing the _ open _ string we have used in the computation of the gravitational amplitudes and the gauge holographic dual .",
    "obviously , this observation should be taken with a grain of salt but we feel it certainly deserves a further study .",
    "the former `` color kinematics '' relation could be anticipated from a different point of view directly working with the gauge theory ( or equivalently open string ) amplitudes by simply imposing a good planar limit for higher loop amplitudes built using as generalized vertex the gauge theory amplitudes @xmath438 .",
    "for instance with the gauge theory amplitudes @xmath438 interpreted as effective vertex with @xmath0 external lines we can define a @xmath439 scattering amplitude with @xmath128 internal loops .",
    "this loop gauge amplitude scales with the number of colors as @xmath440 and therefore in order to get a good large @xmath72 planar limit we need to impose ( for @xmath0 large enough ) @xmath441 using now @xmath442 the former condition becomes @xmath443 ( in open string units ) which translated into planckian language with @xmath444 leads to the black hole threshold relation @xmath445 .",
    "in other words what we observe is that at the level of the gauge amplitudes the condition of having a good planar limit in thooft sense ( for loop amplitudes ) underlies the mechanism of unitarization by black hole formation for the corresponding tree level gravitational amplitudes .    in conclusion , in this paper we have discussed a particular high  energy limit of yang - mills and gravity scattering amplitudes , both from the field theory as well as from the string perspective . from the technical side ,",
    "we have derived new closed expressions for the tree - level string scattering amplitudes at high energies , which are valid for an arbitrarily large number of external particles .",
    "moreover , we have considered a particular high  energy limit , which corresponds to the case of classicalization via black hole production , where black holes are bound states of a large number of very soft gravitons . as discussed",
    ", this correspondence finds additional support by the existence of a potentially new kind of large @xmath0 gauge - gravity correspondence with @xmath0 the number of external particles in eikonal regge kinematics .",
    "as pointed out it would be interesting to relate this large @xmath0 duality to the standard large @xmath0 duality arising in the context of holography and the ads / cft correspondence .",
