    "the past five years has been the golden time for the 30 year old internet , during which it experienced fascinating evolution , both exponential growth in its traffic and endless expansion in its topology .",
    "such growth makes more thorough and rigorous analysis of the nature of internet traffic and topology an urgent task .",
    "it is also a very difficult one .",
    "it was ever believed that the mathematical theories for _ circuit switching _ telephone networks might be good enough for analyzing the internet traffic and topology .",
    "however , later it was found that the internet , as a _ package switching _",
    "network , has very different nature and successful mathematical theories for the internet can be quite different from those for telephone networks(see willinger and paxson(1998 ) for more details ) .",
    "as the internet grows at an astonishing speed , more and more high quality data have been collected in recent years .",
    "these data make thorough studies possible .",
    "the pioneering work by leland ( 1994 ) shows that the traffic of local area network(lan ) appears to be self - similar at different scales .",
    "discoveries of other self - similarities such as the one found in wide area network(wan ) by paxson and floyd(1995 ) make internet engineers and interested mathematicians contemplate that some special power laws such as the heavy tail distribution might be the hidden rules in internet traffic(see willinger and paxson(1998 ) or willinger , paxson and taqqu(1998 ) ) .",
    "the discovery of three power laws by faloutsos , faloutsos and faloutsos(1999 ) is one of the most recent work on the internet topology .",
    "they view the internet as an undirected graph . for each node in the graph , it has properties such as the out - degree .",
    "faloutsos discovery is not just power laws for the large scale properties of the internet , but rather the relationships between nodes at different scales , running from a host on a lan to the range encompassed by the whole internet . without a doubt , such discovery is important not only to our understanding of the very nature of the rapidly growing internet , but also to any reasonable simulations of lans or wans or the whole internet .    yet , as we will point out in section 2 of this note , the first two power laws in faloutsos discovery are not independent to each other .",
    "in fact , they are equivalent so each one can be derived from the other . in section 3 , we will go further to show that the data analysis in faloutsos work toward discovering power law 1 is superior to the data analysis work done for power law 2 , simply because the former data analysis will give more accurate estimate comparing to the later one .",
    "conclusions are summarized in the last section , section 4 .",
    "throughout this note , we adopt the notations used in faloutsos work .",
    "the internet is viewed as an undirected graph @xmath2 , and the number of nodes and the number of edges in @xmath2 are @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "the out - degree of a node @xmath5 , which is the number of edges incident to the node , is denoted by @xmath6 .",
    "note that in @xmath2 , different nodes may have the same out - degree .",
    "that is , if we can group all the nodes which have the same out - degree @xmath7 and index the group , then for the nodes in the @xmath8 group , they have the same out - degree denoted by @xmath9 .",
    "the number of nodes in this @xmath8 group , which gives the frequency of appearances of out - degree @xmath9 in @xmath2 , is denoted by @xmath10 .",
    "sometimes we just write @xmath11 to denote the frequency of @xmath7 in @xmath2 .",
    "this is because the out - degree @xmath7 , which always starts from 1 throughout this note , can be used to index the groups of nodes of different out - degrees , thus @xmath11 is the number of nodes in the @xmath12 group for out - degree @xmath7 .",
    "the _ rank _",
    ", @xmath13 , of a node @xmath5 which has an out - degree @xmath7 is the global index of the node among all of the nodes in the order of decreasing out - degree .    the first and second faloutsos power laws can be stated as d_v = c_1 r_v^r and f_d = c_2 d^o respectively . here",
    "@xmath14 is a constant and can be determined by any given pair of @xmath6 and @xmath15 measured from data collected from the internet .",
    "@xmath16 is another constant and can be calculated from a pair of @xmath17 and @xmath7 . @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the two exponents of the power laws .    by definition , the frequency of out - degree @xmath7 in @xmath2 , @xmath11 , is related to the ranks of those nodes which have out - degree @xmath7 .",
    "suppose node @xmath20 is a node of out - degree @xmath21 , and it is the last indexed node with rank @xmath22 in the group consisting of nodes which all have out - degree @xmath21 .",
    "further suppose that node @xmath23 is a node of out - degree @xmath7 , and it is the last indexed node , with rank @xmath15 , in the group consisting of nodes of out - degree @xmath7 .",
    "then @xmath11 is related to @xmath22 and @xmath15 through the relation f_d = r_v^ - r_v .",
    "we may re - write relation ( 1 ) as r_v= ( ) ^ d_v^. note that the first order approximation to the right hand side of ( 3 ) is in fact the first order derivative of the right hand side of ( 4 ) with respect to @xmath7 : f_d = r_v^ - r_v - ( ) ^ d^-1 from ( 4 ) to ( 5 ) we changed @xmath6 to @xmath7 because for all nodes of the group where node @xmath23 is in , they all have the same out - degree @xmath7 . comparing ( 5 ) and ( 2 )",
    ", we have o -1 and c_2 - ( ) ^. thus we have derived the second power law from the first power law .",
    "to derive the first power law from the second , we have to integrate relation ( 2 ) from 1 to @xmath6 to get @xmath15 , then compare the result with relation ( 4 ) . by doing this",
    ", we have r and c_1 ( ) ^r . ( 6 ) , ( 7 ) and ( 8) , ( 9 ) shows that whenever we have one of the two power laws , exponent and the constant of the other one can be derived from the given parameters . that is , in data analysis of the internet topology , once we have measured @xmath15 at different out - degrees and found a power law relation with exponent @xmath18 between them , we do not need to measure @xmath11 at different out - degrees because the power law relation between @xmath15 and out - degree will guarantee the power law relation between @xmath11 and @xmath7 with an exponent @xmath24 . in simulations",
    ", samples generated according to power law 1 will follow power law 2 automatically , and _ vice versa_.    in table 1 and table 2 , we list the comparisons of the derived parameters using above relations and the measured parameters given in the work of faloutsos. from table 1 we find our calculated exponent @xmath19 of power law 2 is quite close to the measured one , except the last case , which is the rout-95 dataset .",
    "the small discrepancy shows that mere coincidence is not likely . for the comparison of our calculated exponent @xmath18 and the measured @xmath18 in table 2 , although the relative errors are larger than those in table 1 , for the first three cases they are still below 15% .",
    "when deriving relations ( 6 ) and ( 8) in above section , we assumed first that one of the power laws must hold . in the derivation , we used differentiation and integration , which can only be approximately correct because the real datasets are discrete samples .",
    "suppose at one sampling position , such as an out - degree @xmath7 , the measured rank is @xmath15 , and our calculated rank by integrating equation ( 2 ) is @xmath25 .",
    "we denote the difference between @xmath15 and @xmath25 by @xmath26 , and call it an _ error term _ for the estimation of rank at out - degree @xmath7 .",
    "we can define a similar error term , @xmath27 , for the estimation of frequency at out - degree @xmath7 with equation ( 5 ) .",
    "the errors , both @xmath26 and @xmath27 , can be the measurement errors , the round - off errors , or the errors due to the discrete nature of our sampling , and in most cases , the combination of them all .",
    "non - zero @xmath26 will affect our estimation of @xmath19 made in table ( 1 ) .",
    "non - zero @xmath27 will also affect our estimation of @xmath18 in table ( 2 ) , but in a different way from how @xmath26 affects estimating @xmath19 .",
    "we find that the relative errors for the first three cases in table ( 1 ) are smaller than those in table ( 2 ) .",
    "in other words , the derivation of @xmath19 from @xmath18 by differentiating equation ( 4 ) gives closer to measured results than the derivation of @xmath18 from @xmath19 by integrating equation ( 2 ) .",
    "this is because that if rank @xmath15 has error @xmath26 , then from equation ( 3 ) the error in @xmath11 will be of the order @xmath28 .",
    "however , if @xmath11 has error @xmath27 , then the error in @xmath15 , which can be obtained by integrating equation ( 2 ) , is in fact an accumulation of @xmath27 in the summation , which is @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the number of out - degrees used in the integration .",
    "hence , even though the two power laws are equivalent , deriving the second power law from the first one will give better estimate , i.e. , estimate with smaller errors if @xmath31 , of the second power law than the estimate of the first power law derived from the second one .    in faloutsos work , they applied linear regression to obtain the power laws .",
    "we have shown above that power laws 1 and 2 are equivalent , therefore the two linear regressions applied in faloutsos work should give the same answer .",
    "that is , if we start from a power law relation between rank @xmath32 and out - degree @xmath7 , for example , @xmath33 , and deduce the relation between frequency @xmath11 and @xmath7 , the relation should also be a power law .",
    "for example , @xmath34 , and the exponent @xmath19 should be related to @xmath18 through ( 6 ) . in figure 1 , the @xmath35 s show the relation d = c_1 r^-1.0 .",
    "note the logarithmic scales on both axes .",
    "there are 2000 data generated , so the rank @xmath32 runs from 1 to 2000 .",
    "the heavy solid line is the linear fitting to the @xmath35 s , with slope @xmath36 , instead of @xmath37 as we expect .",
    "this is due to the discretization of the data .",
    "the @xmath35 s with out - degree @xmath38 have a linear fitting of slope @xmath39 , which is shown in figure 1 as the dash line .",
    "apparently the data of out - degree 1 have large effect on the linear fitting .    in figure 2",
    ", we plot the relation between @xmath11 and @xmath7 based on the data(@xmath35 s ) collected in figure 1 . a few data of frequency 1 and out - degree @xmath40 are outliers and discarded in the fitting made in figure 2 , which is shown as a heavy solid line .",
    "the number of these discarded outliers is 26 , only 1.3% of the total data .",
    "the slope of the linear fitting is @xmath41 , which is what we expect because of the equivalence of the two power laws , i.e. , equation ( 6 ) .",
    "given the definitions of frequency @xmath11 and rank @xmath32 , it is not surprising to see the equivalence of the first two power laws proposed by faloutsos we have proved such equivalence and demonstrated the mutual determination of these two relations , therefore it is not possible nor necessary for any simulations to follow these two power relations independently .",
    "however , as we have shown in section 3 , determining the power relation between frequency @xmath11 and out - degree @xmath7 by analyzing the data of rank @xmath15 as a function of our - degree @xmath7 , will give estimates of smaller error comparing to the estimate made in reversed order , i.e. , the estimate of the power law relation between rank @xmath32 and out - degree @xmath7 by analyzing the data of frequency @xmath11 as a function of out - degree @xmath7 .",
    "for any set of data measured from the internet , they will follow the power law only _ approximately _ , not always exactly , especially the nodes of very high out - degree and frequency 1 , or the nodes of out - degree 1 , as we show in figures ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) . in simulations ,",
    "these nodes should be treated with special care .",
    "if the probability density function for the appearance of nodes with out - degree @xmath42 in the internet is @xmath43 , then the average number of nodes whose out - degrees run from @xmath44 to @xmath45 is _",
    "d_1^d_2 s ( s ) ds , with which we can deduce the relation between frequency @xmath11 at out - degree @xmath7 and the probability density function @xmath43 as f_d _ d - d^d+d s ( s ) ds ( d ) d , where we assume @xmath46 . if @xmath34 , we have the probability density function @xmath47 as ( s ) c_2 d^o-1 which is a heavy tail distribution .",
    "the rank @xmath32 is related to the function @xmath47 through the integration r(d)=_1^d s ( s ) ds for @xmath38 .",
    "the power laws show the relations between nodes of different out - degrees when the internet is in steady state . in order to study the dynamics of the internet",
    ", it would be very interesting to inject nodes of some specific out - degrees into the internet , and follow the temporal evolution of these nodes . by the time we inject nodes of some specific out - degree , we alter the power law relationship between @xmath11 and @xmath7 by adding a spike - like disturbance(see figure 3 ) .",
    "if a steady internet does follow power laws , tracing the evolution of the spike - like disturbance will tell us how the disturbance will be propagated , or _ cascaded _ , toward higher out - degree and lower out - degree directions(shown by the two arrows in figure 3 ) ,",
    "the spike being broadened at the same time(shown by the dash line in figure 3 ) . in real life",
    ", such spike - like disturbance could be due to the sharp increase in the number of internet users signing onto their isps .",
