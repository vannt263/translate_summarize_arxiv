    "one of the definitive predictions of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is that at sufficiently high density and temperature , strongly interacting matter will be in a deconfined state of the quarks and gluons , called the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) . in a qgp",
    "the strong interactions become screened .",
    "the production of heavy quarkonia states in p+p , p+a and a+a collisions provide an important tool to study the properties of qgp  @xcite .",
    "the larger production cross - sections for charmonium  @xcite states compared to bottomonium states have initiated the studies of charmonium along with the observation of charmonium suppression  @xcite in relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "the high energy at rhic allows the measurement of the @xmath0 states in heavy ion collisions , where the lattice qcd studies of quarkonia spectral functions suggest that while the @xmath2 melts at rhic and the @xmath3 is likely to melt , the @xmath0 is expected to survive  @xcite .",
    "their suppression pattern can be used as a thermometer to the qcd matter  @xcite and henceforth the study of @xmath0 production is of paramount importance .    as the bottomonium state is massive ( @xmath4 10 gev/@xmath5 )",
    "its decay leptons have sufficiently large momenta and bottomonium spectroscopy requires higher luminosities .",
    "its decay leptons have sufficiently large momenta above the background processes which helps in high - level triggering even in central au+au collisions . in this paper",
    ", we report preliminary @xmath0 measurements in p+p collisions ( from run 6 ) along with preliminary results from au+au collisions ( in run 7 ) at mid - rapidity obtained with the star detector .",
    "the golden quarkonium decay mode for star is @xmath6 .",
    "the main detectors for this analysis are the tpc ( time projection chamber )  @xcite and the bemc ( barrel electro - magnetic calorimeter )  @xcite .",
    "the advantages of star are its large acceptance along with the trigger capabilities of the bemc and combined electron identification using the tpc+bemc .",
    "the suitable triggers using the bemc allows us to suppress the hadrons , achieving a higher signal to background ratio .",
    "thus we can trigger on electron - positron pairs with a given invariant mass at sufficiently high rates .",
    "the star @xmath0 trigger is a two - stage setup which comprises of a fast level-0 ( l0 ) hardware component ( @xmath7s ) and a level-2 ( l2 ) software component ( @xmath8s ) .",
    "the l0 trigger is a fast hardware trigger taking a decision for each rhic bunch crossing and consisting of a four layer tree structure of data storage and manipulation boards ( dsm ) .",
    "such a trigger is issued if at least one bemc tower is above the adjusted quarkonium threshold of @xmath9 3.5 gev and the associated trigger patch having a total energy above 4.3 gev , along with a minimum bias condition .",
    "the l2 trigger is a software trigger which analyses events at the rate of about 1 khz . in the initial step l2",
    "starts finding towers with similar l0 threshold .",
    "it performs clustering to account for energy leaking into the adjacent towers , and to improve the position resolution by calculating the mean cluster position , weighted by the energy seen in each tower .",
    "cuts are applied on the invariant mass @xmath10 and the opening angle @xmath11 between clusters .",
    "thus it aborts the read - out of all detectors if the algorithm does not detect at least one pair with the invariant mass within a given mass window .",
    "the trigger though limited by dead - time of the data acquisition system ( daq ) was utilized efficiently for p+p ( in 2006 ) and au+au collisions ( in 2007 ) . thus enabling to process the complete data - set covering the total luminosity provided by rhic , in just a few weeks after the completion of physics run .",
    "for p+p collisions at @xmath12 gev in 2006 , with the full bemc acceptance , star sampled @xmath4 9 pb@xmath13 of integrated luminosity .",
    "two different trigger setups were deployed . the preliminary analysis focused on one trigger setup with the integrated luminosity @xmath14",
    "5.6 pb@xmath13 was reported in ref  @xcite .",
    "electrons were identified by selecting charged particle tracks where number of fitted points are greater than 20 out of 45 , along with the specific @xmath15 ionization energy loss in the tpc that deposited more than 3 gev of energy in a bemc tower .",
    "electron - positron pairs were then combined to produce the invariant mass spectrum . finally the like - sign electron pairs were combined to form the invariant mass spectrum of the background which was subtracted from the unlike - sign spectrum as shown in fig .",

    "the systematic error is dominated by the uncertainty in the integrated luminosity .    in 2007 ,",

    "two different trigger setups were used but the preliminary analysis in au+au collisions was centered on one trigger setup with larger integrated luminosity of @xmath23b@xmath13 .",
    "the electron identification conditions were kept close to what we had used for p+p 2006 analysis .",
