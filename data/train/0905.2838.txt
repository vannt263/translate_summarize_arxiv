    "tunneling control of ultra - cold atoms via time - periodic shaking  @xcite of potentials is currently established as an experimental method both on the single particle level  @xcite and on the level of bose - einstein condensates ( becs )  @xcite .",
    "an interesting effect is an analog of photon - assisted tunneling in periodically shaken systems of ultra - cold atoms .",
    "it was predicted theoretically both for the case that the driving frequency matches the potential difference between neighboring wells  @xcite and for the case that the driving frequency is resonant with the interaction energy  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2-photon resonances essentially are a single - particle effect which survives interactions ; one- and two - photon resonances have been observed experimentally for becs in periodically shaken lattices  @xcite .",
    "the `` photons '' are time - periodic potential modulations in the kilo - hertz - regime .",
    "however , photon - assisted tunneling is not restricted to integer photon resonances .",
    "also half - integer shapiro - like  @xcite resonances have been predicted numerically both on the mean - field ( gross - pitaevskii ) level and on the level of the multi - particle quantum dynamics ( down to @xmath1 particles )  @xcite .",
    "while the occurrence of higher or lower harmonics in non - linear equations is easy to understand qualitatively , it is not clear a priori how these resonances should occur in the linear @xmath0-particle schrdinger equation .",
    "thus , analytic calculations which can explain the occurrence of such resonances within the linear quantum dynamics will explain how effective non - linearities can arise from linear dynamics even for small particle numbers .",
    "realistic experimental values for the number of atoms in a double well can be of the order of 1000 atoms  @xcite for becs and down to less than 6 atoms  @xcite for few - atoms experiments .    often , floquet - states  @xcite help to understand the physics of becs in periodically driven systems  @xcite .",
    "the focus of the present paper , lies on a different approach : analytic calculations on the @xmath0-particle level developed in ref .",
    "@xcite ( cf .  ref .",
    "@xcite ) . by assuming the experimentally realistic initial condition of all particles being in one well  @xcite , the calculations are done analogously to the time - dependent perturbation theory .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : after introducing the two - mode model for a bec in a double well ( sec .  [",
    "sec : a ] ) , we develop the technique to calculate half - integer resonances in sec .  [",
    "sec : the ] .",
    "a crucial test is to show that the analytic result vanishes in the limit of non - interacting particles ( sec .",
    "[ sec : half ] ) .",
    "other fractional resonances are discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : frac ] .",
    "bose - einstein condensates in double - well potentials are interesting both experimentally and theoretically  @xcite . in order to describe a bec in a double well",
    ", we use a model originally developed in nuclear physics  @xcite : a multi - particle hamiltonian in two - mode approximation  @xcite , @xmath3 where the operator @xmath4 annihilates ( creates ) a boson in well  @xmath5 ; @xmath6 is the tunneling splitting , @xmath7 is the tilt between well  1 and well  2 and @xmath8 is the driving amplitude .",
    "the interaction between a pair of particles in the same well is denoted by @xmath9 .",
    "the gross - pitaevskii dynamics can be mapped to that of a nonrigid pendulum  @xcite . including the term describing the periodic shaking , the hamilton function is given by : @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are canonically conjugate variables .",
    "the quantity @xmath13 is the population imbalance with @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) referring to the situation with all particles in well  1 ( well  2 ) .",
    "the corresponding observable on the @xmath0-particle level is given by @xmath16    for integer photon - assisted tunneling , the potential difference between both wells , @xmath17 has to be bridged by an integer number of photons : @xmath18 the @xmath19-integer resonance occurs for @xmath20 for an interacting bose gas , these resonances are furthermore shifted  @xcite .    for some parameter regimes ( especially for interactions comparable to the onset of the self - trapping transition  @xcite ) , the differences between mean - field ( gross - pitaevskii ) dynamics and the @xmath0-particle quantum dynamics can be quite remarkable  @xcite .",
    "however , when concentrating on the ( experimentally measurable  @xcite ) time - averaged population imbalance , @xmath21 for _ low _ interactions , the qualitative agreement between mean - field and @xmath0-particle dynamics for the occurrence of both integer and half - integer photon - assisted tunneling is excellent  @xcite .",
    "photon - assisted tunneling is clearly visible in the experimentally measurable time - averaged population imbalance  ( [ eq : timeaveraged ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : quasi ] shows integer resonances  ( [ eq : integerphoton ] ) , namely the one - photon peak with @xmath22 and the two - photon peak at @xmath23 .",
    "furthermore , there are pronounced fractional - integer resonances at @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 corresponding to the 1/2 , 3/2 and 5/2-photon peaks . while some of the resonances disappear  @xcite for specific choices of the driving _ amplitude _ , the initial phase of the periodic driving ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) does not influence the occurrence of resonances in the situation investigated in this manuscript .",
    "figure  [ fig : timeaveraged ] shows that it is not essential to start with all particles in one well in order to observe photon - assisted tunneling . both for the ground - state of the untilted , undriven system ( for which the initial population imbalance is zero ) and for the ground - state of the tilted system with an initial population imbalance of @xmath27 , the main resonances of fig .",
    "[ fig : quasi ] , where all particles were initially in well  1 , can easily be identified .",
    "figure  [ fig : einhalb ] displays the half - integer resonance for @xmath1 particles .",
    "contrary to what was observed for both larger particle numbers and for mean - field , the position of the @xmath19 photon resonance does not shift with increasing energy .",
    "a first test of our analytic calculations towards the end of the next section will thus be to explain this feature .",
    "in order to analytically describe the time - evolution of the interacting system , the fock basis @xmath28 is used .",
    "the label @xmath29 refers to a state with @xmath30  particles in well  @xmath31 , and @xmath32  particles in well  @xmath33 .",
    "the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : h ] ) now is the sum of two @xmath34-matrices , @xmath35 while the non - diagonal matrix  @xmath36 is given by the tunneling - terms of eq .",
    "( [ eq : h ] ) , the diagonal matrix  @xmath37 includes both the interaction between the particles and the applied potential difference . for the solution of the schrdinger equation @xmath38 the ansatz @xmath39 \\;\\ ] ] turned out to be useful  @xcite .    within this framework ,",
    "a set of differential equations was derived  @xcite which is mathematically equivalent to the @xmath0-particle schrdinger equation governed by the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : h ] ) : @xmath40 in eq .",

    "to simplify the expression for subsequent integrals , one can use the expansion in terms of bessel functions  @xcite @xmath44 equation  ( [ eq : equiv ] ) furthermore needs @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the kronecker delta ( which is zero except for @xmath47 where @xmath48 ) .",
    "the idea is to proceed along the lines of time - dependent perturbation theory  @xcite . starting with a typical experimental initial condition such that all particles are in the first well  @xcite , one has in zeroth order perturbation theory : @xmath49 where @xmath50 in first order perturbation theory , one gets : @xmath51 if @xmath52 and @xmath53 using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : phase ] ) and ( [ eq : bessel ] ) one thus has @xmath54 with @xmath55 therefore , after solving the integral , eq .  ( [ eq : a11 ] ) is a sum of time - periodic functions except for the special case with @xmath56 which recovers the integer photon resonances of eq .",
    "( [ eq : integerphoton ] ) investigated in refs .  @xcite .",
    "while for a double well as in ref .",
    "@xcite , the population imbalance is ideal to investigate photon - assisted tunneling , the experiment  @xcite was performed in an optical lattice .",
    "the signatures of photon - assisted tunneling were seen in the width of the bec after expansion in the shaken lattice . surprisingly , a @xmath57 dependence was measured .",
    "while this might be interpreted as being an indication for transition from ballistic to diffusive transport  @xcite , the present experiments can not exclude other explanations .",
    "the @xmath57-dependence could either be an interaction - induced effect  @xcite or the result of an effective average over the precise instant within the cycle at which the current is measured  @xcite .    as the aim of the present paper is to understand the fractional photon peaks like the interaction induced half - integer resonances of ref .",
    "@xcite , we can discard the integer - photon resonances characterized via @xmath56   the amplitude @xmath58 would contain a part which increases linearly in time .",
    "this both signifies the break - down of our perturbation theory ( for too large times ) and the onset of photon - assisted tunneling . ] and thus write @xmath59 in second order perturbation theory one has ( see the appendix  [ sec : second ] ) : @xmath60 with @xmath61 again , @xmath62 can be discarded because it corresponds to integer photon resonances .",
    "however , if @xmath63 then @xmath64 does have parts which increase linearly in time . in order to see that this indeed corresponds to a half - integer resonance , we choose @xmath1 and @xmath65 .",
    "this implies @xmath66 and @xmath67 and the condition @xmath68 thus becomes independent of the interaction ; it results in the simple equation @xmath69    the above reasoning explains why we observe no shift of the resonance with increasing interaction in the numerics displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : einhalb ] . the amplitude to find both particles in well two",
    "is given by ( appendix  [ sec : second ] ) : @xmath70 where the expression @xmath71 contains oscillatory terms which can be found in eq .",
    "( [ eq : a2oscil ] ) .",
    "the convergence of this sum is ensured both by the scaling of @xmath72 on @xmath73 and the behavior of bessel functions with increasing @xmath73  @xcite @xmath74 combined with the fact that @xmath75 ( for integer @xmath73 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : a2 ] shows good qualitative agreement between the analytic and numeric calculations for the time - averaged probability that both particles , which initially have been in the first well , have tunneled to the second well .",
    "already perturbation theory in the first order , in which the half - integer resonance becomes visible , correctly describes the occurrence of maxima and minima in the probability for both particles to occupy the second well .",
    "despite the agreement displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : a2 ] , at the first glance eq .",
    "( [ eq : a22 ] ) seems to contain a flaw : numerically , we observe that the half - integer resonance disappears for zero interaction",
    ". however , there seems to be a sum of non - zero terms proportional to @xmath76 even for @xmath77 .",
    "as it is not obvious that these terms cancel , the next step will be to demonstrate that @xmath64 indeed approaches zero for vanishing interaction .    as shown in the appendix ,",
    "the terms proportional to @xmath76 in @xmath64 are due to situations such that eq .",
    "( [ eq : summesigma ] ) is fulfilled . in the limit",
    "@xmath78 this results again in the condition  ( [ eq : summekell ] ) , independent of the particle number .",
    "the part of @xmath64 which increases linearly in time is thus proportional to @xmath79 dividing the sum into two parts ( @xmath80 ) and then setting @xmath81 , one obtains @xmath82 in the limit @xmath78 , the position of the half - integer resonance approaches the value for @xmath1 particles .",
    "therefore , one has @xmath83 and thus @xmath84 which implies @xmath85 thus , in agreement with the numerics , the half - integer photon peak disappears with vanishing interactions .",

    "[ fig : drittel ] ) . as",
    "this resonance only occurs in third order perturbation theory ( rather than second order for the half - integer resonances ) , the amplitudes would be rather small for interactions as in fig .",
    "[ fig : einhalb ] .",

    ", smaller fractions could be treated in higher order perturbation theory .",
    "as the resonances thus are a higher order effect , they will tend to decrease .",
    "contrary to the integer - photon peaks  @xcite , fractional - integer photon peaks can not be explained by simply replacing the time - dependent hamiltonian by a time - independent hamiltonian with renormalized tunneling frequencies . as half - integer resonances already appear for two particles in a double well , this experimentally relevant case  @xcite was investigated both numerically and analytically .",
    "the perturbation calculations can explain for which parameters the non - integer resonances occur .",
