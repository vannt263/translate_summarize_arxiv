    "the pragmatically applied rules of quantum mechanics involve two distinct laws of evolution for the state of the system : these are the schrdinger equation and quantum state reduction .",
    "a long - standing problem is how to make sense of this since there is no underlying theory stating when one or the other of these laws is to be used .",
    "instead it is left to a judgment whereby state reduction is associated with the fuzzy concept of measurement .    based on the premise that quantum state reduction should be taken seriously as a genuine physical process , collapse models @xcite are an attempt to resolve this situation by suggesting a composite dynamics incorporating state reduction events or collapses and unitary state evolution ( for general reviews see @xcite ) .",
    "the idea is that the schrdinger equation should be viewed as an approximation to this more general dynamics valid when collapse effects are negligible .",
    "conversely , collapse effects should be seen to dominate in situations where state reduction is an appropriate description .",
    "the most familiar model of this type is that of ghirardi , rimini , and weber ( grw ) @xcite describing a system of nonrelativistic quantum particles .",
    "the essential idea of grw is that the state of each particle , as a matter of physical law , occasionally ( but very infrequently ) undergoes a random collapse to a state localized in position space . from this law of collapses",
    "it follows that quantum wavelike behavior becomes increasingly unstable for systems of increasing size @xcite .",
    "collapse models thus offer a mathematical framework capable of unifying quantum and classical domains .    the nonrelativistic continuous spontaneous localization ( csl ) model @xcite is an improvement on grw since it preserves the symmetries of systems of identical particles .",
    "the formulation of csl , in terms of a stochastic differential equation , invites a straightforward generalization to relativistic quantum field theory ( qft ) , but it is well known that this results in physically unacceptable divergent behavior @xcite . here",
    "we shall address the question of how these infinities can be avoided .",
    "the source of divergences , as with other infinite behavior in qft , can be traced to point interactions between quantum field operators in the dynamical equations for the state vector . however , in the case of relativistic collapse models , attempts to renormalize with the inclusion of subtractive counter terms fail .",
    "this way of viewing the problem of infinities suggests that a solution could be to smear out the point interactions .",
    "the same idea was considered by nicrosini and rimini @xcite although their implementation requires the unsatisfactory inclusion of a locally preferred frame . in this article",
    "we propose the use of a novel relativistic field responsible for mediating the collapse process which enables us to fulfill the aim of smearing the interactions whilst preserving lorentz covariance and frame independence .",
    "this forms the basis of a relativistic collapse mechanism which naturally resembles csl , describing state reductions in a smeared number density eigenbasis .",
    "the structure of the article is as follows .",
    "we begin the presentation of our model in section [ pf ] by stating the properties of the mediating field ( which we subsequently refer to as the pointer field ) . in section [ sd ]",

    "the pointer field state nevertheless depends on the given hypersurface since this demarcates a boundary of past interactions with the quantum field .    in the tomonaga picture we are required to think of state evolution with regards to an ordered sequence of spacelike hypersurfaces .",

    "this shows an equivalence between the two proposals .    in each case ,",
    "whether or not these variables are treated as local beables , they are nevertheless well defined lorentz covariant and frame independent local properties of the theory .",

    "the exponent is negative definite since for @xmath18 within the future cone of @xmath12 we can always choose a frame in which @xmath109 defines the time direction and in this frame only the positive definite @xmath110 component contributes .",
    "the stress - energy factor ensures that the function decays more rapidly in those timelike directions in which the magnitude of the field momentum is large ( e.g. at the extremes of the light cone ) .",
    "the function @xmath20 thus defines a distribution of points @xmath18 near to @xmath12 from the point of view of a field rest frame at @xmath12 .",
    "of course this function could take many other forms  this example is intended as an illustration .",
    "similarly for @xmath17 we choose the smeared form @xmath111 for @xmath18 in the past cone of @xmath12 and @xmath112 elsewhere .",
    "since @xmath113 is involved in the equations of motion of the state then the model is nonmarkovian : in order to advance the state from some arbitrary surface @xmath14 to another surface @xmath27 which differs from @xmath14 only at the point @xmath12 we must determine @xmath113 . since this depends of the surface @xmath95 we require stochastic information encoded in @xmath114 for @xmath18 to the past of @xmath14 ( but outside the past cone of @xmath12 ) .",
    "this makes exact calculations difficult to perform .",
    "in this section we consider a specific example involving an initial superposition of different quantum matter density states . by decomposing into different time stages where either the field interactions dominate or the collapse process dominates we will demonstrate the characteristics of the state dynamics .",
    "let us express the initial state ( assigned to an initial hypersurface @xmath115 ) as a direct product of the quantum field state ( describing matter ) and the pointer state @xmath116 we contrive a situation in which the matter field is initially in a superposition of idealized @xmath73-eigenstates , i.e. @xmath117 are normalized and satisfy @xmath118 ( @xmath119 is some real valued function of @xmath12 ) .",

    "applying this solution to our initial condition ( [ init ] ) we find that after the system has evolved to some hypersurface @xmath124 ( denoting the end of this pure interaction phase ) the state is given by @xmath125 where @xmath126 \\right\\}|0\\rangle , \\label{coh}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath127 from equation ( [ coh ] ) it is straightforward to show that the state @xmath128 has the property @xmath129 the pointer field state is therefore a coherent state .",
    "equation ( [ coheig ] ) entails that the pointer field is excited in proportion to the matter density and is only excited in locations near where the matter density is nonzero ( see equation ( [ g ] ) ) .",

    "an initial superposition of different @xmath73-states results in an entangled superposition of @xmath130-eigenstates after a short period of interaction .",
    "notice that this will lead to a loss of coherence for the matter field state in cases where the pointer field is significantly excited ( the pointer field behaves as an environment ) .",
