    "the class of the regular black holes , i.e. , the black holes for which the curvature invariants are regular as @xmath0 has received much attention recently",
    ". the first constructions of such systems ( in which singular interiors have been replaced by the regular cores ) appeared in the mid-1960s in the works of sakharow , gliner and bardeen  @xcite .",
    "nowadays , quite a number of solutions of this type are known , supplemented by the no - go theorems which forbid their construction in certain circumstances  @xcite .",
    "one of the most interesting and intriguing solutions of this type has been proposed by ayon - beato and garcia  @xcite and subsequently reinterpreted by bronnikov  @xcite .",
    "it is a static and spherically - symmetric solution of the coupled system of nonlinear electrodynamics and gravity describing a class of the two - parameter regular black holes . for @xmath1 and for small values of the ratio @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the ( magnetic ) charge and",
    "@xmath4 is the black hole mass , it closely resembles the reissner - nordstrm solution .",
    "noticeable differences appear for the extreme and nearly extreme configurations .",
    "we will refer to this family of the exact solutions of the einstein equations as the abgb black holes .    although the metric potentials of the @xmath5 black hole involve the hyperbolic functions of @xmath6 it can be demonstrated that the radii of the event and the inner horizon can be expressed in terms of the real branches of the lambert functions  @xcite .",
    "this property together with the relative simplicity of the metric tensor have stimulated continued interest in the abgb black holes  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we shall analyze a class of the regular abgb black holes in the asymptotically ( anti-)de sitter universe .",
    "it clarifies our earlier results presented in ref .",
    "@xcite and extends them to the case of the negative cosmological constant .",
    "subsequently , we construct the stress - energy tensor of the quantized massive scalar , spinor and vector field inside the extremal and ultraextremal horizon of the degenerate black hole .",
    "the calculations are carried out within the framework of the schwinger - de witt approximation  @xcite .",
    "this approach is quite general as the sole criterion for its applicability is demanding that the ratio of the compton length associated with the field and the characteristic radius of the curvature of the background geometry is small . in practice , it turns out that the reasonable results can be obtained for @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "we shall explicitly demonstrate that important and interesting information regarding the stress - energy tensor can easily be obtained by studying the geometry of the closest vicinity of the degenerate horizon and the regular center .",
    "indeed , near the regular center of the black hole the line element reduces to that of the ( anti-)de sitter , whereas near the degenerate event horizon the line element has a product form , where each part describes maximally symmetric two - dimensional subspace .",
    "this is a very fortunate feature of the problem as the stress - energy tensor is extremely complicated . on the other hand ,",
    "the full stress - energy tensor inside the degenerate horizons reveals interesting features .",
    "indeed , although the interior of the degenerate regular black hole in the asymptotically ( anti)-de sitter universe is described by simple functions , the components of the stress - energy tensor in the intermediate region are many orders of magnitude greater that the components at the center and in the neighborhood of the horizon .",
    "this behavior , although not quite unexpected , is totally different from what one usually encounters in the calculations of the quantum processes in the curved background , provided the calculations are carried out in the regions that are sufficiently distant from the central singularity . in the regular models",
    "the singularity is absent and the oscillatory character of the components of the stress - energy tensor is due to various response of the curvature terms constituting @xmath8 to the changes of the metric inside the ( degenerate ) event horizon .",
    "the lengthy and complicated formulas describing the components of the stress - energy tensor of the quantized massive scalar , spinor and vector fields can be downloaded from the computer code repository  @xcite . moreover , it should be noted that the general solution constructed here provides a natural setting for calculations presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : the regular abgb black holes in the ( anti-)de sitter universe are introduced in the next section . in section",
    "iii the geometries of the vicinity of the degenerate horizons are analyzed with the special emphasis put on the bertotti - robinson , nariai , anti - nariai and plebanski - hacyan solutions .",

    "nevertheless , one can always refer to the horizon - defined mass   @xmath56 in the latter , for brevity , we shall denote both masses by a single symbol @xmath57 demanding the regularity of the line element as @xmath58 yields @xmath59 and , consequently , the resulting line element has the form ( [ el_gen ] ) with @xmath60 and @xmath61 it should be noted that with such a choice of @xmath45 and @xmath42 both ( [ madm ] ) and ( [ mhor ] ) are consistent with ( [ el_gen1 ] ) , i.e. , depending on the sign of the cosmological constant @xmath62 is equivalent either to ( [ madm ] ) or to ( [ mhor ] ) .",
    "we shall call this solution the ayn - beato - garca - bronnikov-(anti-)de sitter solution ( abgb-(a)ds ) .",
    "it could be easily shown that putting @xmath63 yields the schwarzschild - de sitter ( kottler ) solution , whereas for @xmath64 one gets the ayn - beato , garca line element as reinterpreted by bronnikov .    to study abgb-(a)ds line element it is convenient to introduce the dimensionless quantities @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "here we shall concentrate on configurations with at least one horizon .",
    "first , let us observe that for small charges @xmath68 as well as at great distances form the black hole @xmath69 the abgb-(a)ds solution closely resembles that of rn-(a)ds . indeed , expanding the function @xmath70 in powers of @xmath71 ( or in powers of @xmath72 ) one obtains @xmath73 similarly , near the center one has @xmath74 and the metric in the closest vicinity of @xmath75 may by approximated by the ( anti-)de sitter line element as the second term in the right hand side of the approximation rapidly goes to zero . it should be noted that for a given @xmath4 and @xmath3 and small cosmological constant ( @xmath76 ) some of the features of the abgb-(a)ds geometry are to certain extend similar to that of the abgb spacetime .",
    "simple analysis shows that for @xmath77 there are , at most , three distinct positive roots of the equation @xmath78 one expects that the two of them are located closely to the inner and event horizons of the abgb black hole , whereas the third one ( absent in the abgb geometry ) is approximately located at @xmath79 and interpreted as the cosmological horizon .",
