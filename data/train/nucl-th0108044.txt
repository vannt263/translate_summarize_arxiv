    "high - precision experiments at intermediate energies with electromagnetic probes are presently being carried out with the goal to investigate the internal structure of the participating hadrons and to probe details of the reaction dynamics .",
    "a recent example is the measurement of pion electroproduction on the nucleon to determine the axial and electromagnetic form factors of the nucleon and the pion , respectively @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will point out some of the limitations and shortcomings in the commonly used phenomenological approaches to describe these reactions and show how in contrast structure and dynamics are addressed consistently in microscopic approaches such as chiral perturbation theory .",
    "most theoretical descriptions of intermediate - energy reactions , such as compton scattering or pion electroproduction on a nucleon , have dealt with internal hadron structure and the reaction dynamics in a more global fashion and not used a microscopic model for these aspects . instead , a description based on covariant tree - level feynman diagrams ( born or pole terms ) has been used , where the free hadron properties are the building blocks . the limitations of this approach are immediately obvious from this simple observation : these reactions necessarily involve intermediate particles that are not free , _",
    "i.e. _ are  off mass shell . \" for example , two - step processes on the nucleon , such as compton scattering , necessarily involve off - shell nucleons ; in pion photo- or electroproduction on the nucleon , in addition , there is an off - shell pion .",
    "this fact implies that for the interpretation of these reactions we need more input than just the free , on - shell properties of the participating particles .",
    "it adds complexity to the theoretical description : the general structure of the electromagnetic vertex of a given hadron , for example , is more complicated and the associated form factors will depend on more scalar variables than in the free case @xcite . nevertheless , encouraged by theorems which express reaction amplitudes in certain low - energy limits in terms of on - shell properties of the participating particles ,",
    "it has been customary for decades to describe two - step processes on _",
    "e.g. _ nucleons also at intermediate energies in terms of simple `` born amplitudes , '' which only involve on - shell information in vertices and propagators .",
    "interestingly enough , the articles deriving these low - energy theorems @xcite were the first to point out the more complex structure of vertices and propagators in the general case at higher energies .",
    "what they also emphasized was that the internal structure of the hadrons necessarily leads to new classes of amplitudes .",
    "for example , a diagram that in a given model contributes to the electromagnetic structure of a nucleon , will give rise to irreducible two - photon amplitudes for compton scattering ( see fig .",
    "[ diagramnucleonemvertex : fig ] ) . however , these aspects are absent in the widely used born - term description of compton scattering or pion photo- and electroproduction .    an objective indication that some important physics is missing in the usual theoretical approaches",
    "is provided by gauge invariance . when form factors are included in the born terms ,",
    "one typically obtains amplitudes that are not gauge invariant .",
    "even though the cause of this problem can be understood and addressed when one consistently deals with the origin of the internal structure , most authors reverted to a variety of _ ad hoc _ recipes to restore gauge invariance in born - type amplitudes : terms are added by hand or form factors are adjusted to yield a conserved current . in pion electroproduction , for example",
    ", a commonly made assumption for this purpose is that the pion and nucleon isovector form factors are identical @xcite .",
    "similary , both the pion - pole term and the nucleon - pole term , which is needed for gauge invariance , are proportional to the pion form factor in the model @xcite used to analyze the data in ref .",
    "these assumptions may very well limit the use of this model for extracting the pion form factor from experiment .    another way to deal with this problem are",
    "the extended born terms by haberzettl _",
    "they include off - shell modifications at the hadron vertices in pion photoproduction , consistent with current conservation .",
    "this approach ( which has recently been shown to violate crossing symmetry in its original form @xcite ) can , through its additional free parameters , lead to an improved phenomenology .",
    "however , without a ( field - theoretical ) microscopic basis it is unclear how it can be used to reliably extract information about hadron structure . as has been stressed in refs .",
    "@xcite , off - shell properties of particles are not observables .",
    "they are not unique , depending not only on the microscopic model , but also on the representation one chooses for the interpolating fields of the ( intermediate ) particles @xcite . in some cases ,",
    "they can completely be transformed into reaction - specific contact terms .",
    "when we talk below about `` off - shell effects '' this caveat should be kept in mind .    a direct way to preserve gauge invariance for phenomenological models",
    "is the minimal substitution .",
    "it couples a photon to a given charged system , generating a restricted or `` minimal '' set of terms which guarantee a gauge - invariant amplitude .",
    "this prescription has been critically reviewed in ref .",
    "it has mainly been applied in pion photoproduction @xcite , where the use of a strong pion - nucleon form factor leads in general to a photoproduction amplitude that is not gauge invariant .",
    "the importance of the terms one misses by using this prescription has been illustrated in ref .",
    "@xcite in the context of a simple model for pion photo- and electroproduction .",
    "in this paper we address these general questions related to the internal hadron structure in electromagnetic reactions and to gauge invariance .",
    "we use the pion as the main example , since the formalism remains simple in comparison to the nucleon or particles with higher spin , while all important aspects can be studied .",
    "we start in sec .",
    "ii with a discussion of the features of the general pion electromagnetic vertex .",
    "many of them have been known for decades @xcite , but have largely been ignored in theoretical descriptions of modern experiments .",
    "we examine to what extent this vertex can be obtained through minimal substitution into the pion self energy for real and virtual photons .",
    "we then extend the discussion to the electromagnetic vertex of the nucleon . in sec .",
    "iii we investigate compton scattering off a pion as a protoptype for a two - step process .",
    "special attention is paid to the question how `` off - shell effects '' can contribute to the amplitude .",
    "we then contrast the general compton scattering amplitude for a pion with the amplitude generated through minimal substitution .    clearly the most sensible way to address the physics of hadron structure and reaction mechanism in a consistent fashion , while avoiding the complications and recipes mentioned above , is to work in the framework of a well - defined ( effective ) field theory , such as chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) . in sec .",
    "iv we illustrate this by looking at the pion electromagnetic form factor to one loop in the framework of chpt and investigate if the minimal substitution recipe can be applied on the level of the lagrangian itself .",
    "general conclusions are presented in sec .",
    "in this section we discuss the most general structure of the electromagnetic vertex of spin-@xmath1 and spin-@xmath2 particles and contrast it with the vertex of the free particles .",
    "we show what restrictions the ward - takahashi ( wt ) identity @xcite imposes and stress how a consistent treatment of propagator and vertex structure makes it unnecessary to interrelate pion and nucleon form factors as is commonly done . finally , we discuss to what extent the minimal substitution generates the off - shell vertices needed for the description of the electromagnetic interaction with intermediate particles .      for a spin-@xmath1 particle ( we will for simplicity focus on a charged pion )",

    "it is instructive to use the above result to rewrite the general electromagnetic vertex of the scalar particle as [ eq : pifg ] ^(p,p ) = e , [ eq : form ] where @xmath19 is defined as [ eq : deriv ] f(p^2 , p^2 ) & = & f(q^2 , p^2 , p^2 ) + g(q^2 , p^2 , p^2 ) + & = & f(q^2 , p^2 , p^2 ) + q^2 g(q^2 , p^2 , p^2 ) . by contracting eq .",

    ", such a term can be understood in terms of the gauge - invariant combination @xmath26 representing the fourier component of the electromagnetic field strength tensor @xmath27 associated with a plane - wave ( virtual ) photon @xmath28 . in a reaction amplitude , the structure multiplying the function @xmath17 then results from the contraction of @xmath29 with the sum of the pion momenta @xmath30 .",
    "thus , for the pion , such a separately gauge - invariant term is at least of second order in the photon four - momentum .",
    "furthermore , powers of @xmath25 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 in @xmath31 can be thought of as originating in powers of ( covariant ) derivatives acting on the field - strength tensor , and the final and initial charged - particle fields , respectively .",

    "the significance of the second term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : genlorentz ] ) is not clearly recognized in much of the literature .",
    "this term is often dropped right from the start .",
    "the reason given for ignoring it is that a term in the vertex proportional to @xmath20 will not contribute for virtual photons originating from a conserved current .",
    "however , this argument only works in a covariant gauge , _",
    "e.g. _ in the feynman or landau gauge @xcite . in noncovariant gauges , such as the coulomb gauge ,",
    "the gauge term proportional to @xmath20 must not be neglected since one otherwise would not arrive at the same physical amplitude as in other gauges . by dropping this term in the vertex ,",
    "one gives away the possibility to freely choose a convenient gauge .",
    "for the interaction of a pion with a real photon , the term proportional to @xmath20 can be ignored when calculating an amplitude since @xmath35 . since @xmath36 , one only needs [ eq : real1 ] ^ _ q^2 = 0(p , p ) & = & e ( p + p)^ f(p^2 , p^2 ) + [ eq : real2 ] & = & e ( p+p)^ f(0 , p^2,p^2 ) + [ eq : real3 ] & = & e_(p + p)^ .",
    "thus by using lorentz symmetry and gauge invariance , the electromagnetic vertex needed for real photons can be shown to be entirely determined in terms of the finite derivative of the inverse meson propagator .",
    "this includes the dependence of the vertex on the off - shell variables @xmath22 and @xmath21 .",
    "the situation is entirely different for virtual photons .",
    "the function @xmath8 depends on @xmath25 as well and the term involving @xmath9 must in general be kept .",
    "we now address the question of form factors in pion electroproduction on the nucleon . in the usual description based on pole terms or born diagrams ,",
    "the pion - pole term is the only term where the electromagnetic form factor of the pion appears .",
    "since this term is not separately gauge invariant , gauge invariance of the total amplitude is achieved through cancellation with other terms . to make this cancellation with other diagrams , which involve _ nucleon _ form factors , possible , one is forced to make assumptions about these form factors , namely @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the electromagnetic isovector form factor of the nucleon . in a similar vein ,",
    "both the reggeized pion - pole term and the nucleon - pole term were described through the same form factor , @xmath39 , to insure gauge invariance in refs .",
    "@xcite , which was the basis for the form factor determination of ref .",
    "clearly such assumptions , which are commonly made ( see , _ e.g. _ , refs .",
    "@xcite)unless they can be put on a firm physical basis  should be avoided when extracting detailed information such as a pion form factor from electroproduction experiments .    in contrast , a description that consistently uses a dressed pion propagator and vertex in agreement with the wt identity does not have to make this assumption . the intermediate pion in the pion - pole term is half off shell ( see fig.[pionpoleterm : fig ] ) .",
    "when one tests gauge invariance and contracts the pion - pole term with the photon momentum , it is then easily seen from eq.([eq : wti ] ) that , with @xmath40 and @xmath41 the momentum of the intermediate pion , one obtains q _ ^(p , p ) ( p ) & = & e _",
    "( p ) + & = & - e _ .",
    "the divergence of the pion - pole term , where internal structure is consistently included in pion vertex and propagator , is thus independent of any detailed pion properties .",
    "analogous statements hold for the nucleon - pole terms and the mutual cancellation of pion- and nucleon - pole terms is obtained without any assumptions about the different form factors .",
    "what the wt identity obviously tells us is that we must simultaneously and consistently deal with both the electromagnetic vertex and the propagator of the same hadron to arrive at a gauge - invariant description .",

    "furthermore , the possibility to move off - shell effects into contact terms makes assumptions about the analyticity of the amplitude . above production thresholds",
    "one will therefore face difficulties in this respect @xcite .",

    "the validity of this expansion is implied by the applicability of the renormalization procedure ; in the on - shell renormalization scheme one has @xmath48 . in performing the above substitution",
    ", we have to keep in mind that @xmath49 and the electromagnetic field , @xmath46 , do not commute .",

    "@xmath51 we can rewrite the result in terms of the finite - difference derivative of the inverse propagator : ^_ms(p,p ) & = & e_(p + p)^ + & = & e_(p + p)^f(p^2,p^2 ) .",
    "[ gaminimal ] by comparing to the general form in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pifg ] ) , one sees that the minimal - substitution vertex differs in two respects : its operator structure and the dependence on scalar variables .",
    "minimal substitution generates the first term @xmath52 , which depends only on @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "it does not produce the second , separately gauge - invariant term , which is crucial for having a vertex that depends on the scalar variable @xmath25 . in the following we will refer to this second term as `` non - minimal '' in distinction of the minimal term of eq .",
    "( [ gaminimal ] ) . the minimal - substitution recipe , while producing a vertex in general compliance with the wt identity , clearly leads to an unsatisfactory result for virtual photons .",

    "( [ eq : real3 ] ) , ^_ms(p , p ) = ^ _ q^2 = 0(p , p )",
    ".    thus for the interaction of a real photon with a pion , the result of minimal substitution into the self energy and of a microscopic lorentz- and gauge - invariant calculation are identical , as long as the underlying dynamics is dealt with consistently in the calculation of both the vertex and the self energy , _",
    "e.g. _ both are calculated to the same order in an expansion parameter .",
    "however , this finding at @xmath36 , where minimal substitution leads to the same answer as a microscopic calculation , is an exception .",
    "it is due to the fact that for a scalar particle the wt identity completely specifies the vertex needed for the interaction with a real photon . for @xmath54",
    "the minimal substitution makes little sense , since it does not yield a vertex that depends on the scalar variable @xmath25 .",
    "to obtain such a dependence we would need a `` non - minimal '' term involving the function @xmath17 , which minimal substitution does not generate .      in concluding this section",
    ", we point out that similar considerations also apply to particles with spin 1/2 , such as the nucleon @xcite .",

    "microscopic models will yield for their vertex a much more general structure than that of a free hadron .",
    "while similar statements also apply to the strong vertices , such as the @xmath42-vertex , the insufficient treatment of internal structure of the electromagnetic vertices leads to an easily noticable shortcoming : gauge invariance is not satisfied .",
    "it has been customary to deal with this particular problem by invoking _",
    "ad hoc _ recipes .",
    "examples are restrictive assumptions about the individual form factors , even though these are the objects one wants to study , or the addition of extra terms that make the amplitude gauge invariant .",
    "we started by discussing the general structure of the electromagnetic vertex of hadrons with spin @xmath1 and @xmath179 , and the restrictions imposed by covariance and gauge invariance .",

    "their off - shell behavior is not determined by the hadron propagator .    in phenomenological models a frequently used prescription to obtain a gauge - invariant amplitude",
    "is the `` minimal substitution . ''",
    "given the self energy of a particle , it allows one to obtain a vertex that will at least satisfy the ward - takahashi identity .",
    "it is _ a priori _ clear that this method can only yield a very limited result : it is blind to neutral particles and , for example , can not provide an electromagnetic coupling to a neutron .",
    "but even where it does yield a result , we showed that it is restricted in terms of its operator structure and the dependence on scalar variables .",
    "an exception is the pion vertex for a real photon , where minimal substitution into the pion propagator yields the exact result , including the dependence on the invariant mass of the off - shell pion .",
    "that is because the non - minimal term in the vertex does not contribute for a real photon . for virtual photons , a non - minimal term can contribute , but the minimal substitution of course fails to reproduce it . as a result this method predicts no dependence on @xmath25 ; this latter statement applies also to the spin-1/2 electromagnetic vertex",
    "nevertheless , minimal substitution has been used in some instances for virtual photons , see _",
    "e.g. _ @xcite .",
    "another method to enforce gauge invariance in the case of pion electroproduction is to assume that the pion electromagnetic form factor and the nucleon isovector form factor are identical , @xmath180 , or to assume the pion form factor that applies to the @xmath181 channel also can be used for the @xmath75 or @xmath76 channel .",
    "this is clearly an assumption one wants to avoid when trying to extract the pion electromagnetic form factor from pion electroproduction .",
    "this kind of problem can be expected in all reactions involving different hadrons .",
    "we stress that in principle even the definition of born terms containing on - shell information , such as electromagnetic form factors , is not unique .",
    "an example is the electromagnetic vertex of the nucleon parametrized in terms of the form factors @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "it yields of course an on - shell equivalent nucleon current , but different results when applied off - shell such as in the born - terms for virtual compton scattering .",
    "in contrast to the amplitude parametrized with a dirac- and pauli term with the form factors @xmath182 and @xmath183 , respectively , the @xmath184 version leads to a vcs amplitude that is not gauge invariant unless specific contact terms are included @xcite .",
    "after the discussion of the electromagnetic vertex of a hadron , we turned to the description of two - step processes , using real compton scattering off a pion as an example .",
    "we showed how the general structure of vertices and propagators carries through to the final result . by starting from the general amplitude , consisting of pole terms and irreducible contributions ,",
    "it was shown how for real photons one arrives through the requirement of gauge invariance at the born terms of a point particle , which are free of any reference to off - shell properties .",
    "the same born terms were obtained by using minimal substitution .",
    "off - shell effects were seen to occur in the amplitude through separately gauge - invariant terms . due to photon - crossing symmetry",
    "off - shell contributions start appearing in the compton amplitude only in second order , namely in the polarizabilities .",
    "( for a discussion of virtual compton scattering and systematics of the @xmath25-dependence we refer to refs .",

    "the total cancellation of off - shell effects observed in the @xmath135 channel in ref.@xcite does not prove in general a complete cancellation of off - shell effects .",
    "the observed cancellation only occurs since due to angular momentum conservation there is no net @xmath135 contribution .",
    "finally , we stressed that `` off - shell effects '' can not uniquely be associated with features of a vertex or a propagator ; they can , for example , be shifted from a vertex to reaction - specific contact terms of an effective theory .    while the approaches based on ( extended ) born term amplitudes",
    "are often simple and intuitively appealing , they should be improved in view of the detailed questions one wants to answer through the interpretation of the measurements with the new generation of electron accelerators .",
    "one way to deal consistently with hadron structure in vertices , propagators , irreducible contributions or contact terms , is by starting out from an ( effective ) field theory .",

    "<S> simple prescriptions such as choosing @xmath0 in pion electroproduction or the `` minimal substitution '' are used . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the limitations of such approaches by comparing to the most general structure of electromagnetic vertices and propagators for pions and nucleons . </S>",
    "<S> the recipes to enforce gauge invariance are critically examined and contrasted with the exact treatment . </S>",
