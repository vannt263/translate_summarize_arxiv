    "the axial - next - nearest - neighbor ising ( annni ) model , which includes competing ferro and antiferromagnetic interactions between pairs of spins along an axial direction , is known to display a spectacularly rich phase diagram , with a host of modulated phases @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "the annni model is perhaps the simplest lattice statistical model to account for the presence of spatially modulated phases in a large variety of physical systems @xcite@xcite .",
    "the energy of the annni model on a simple cubic lattice may be written as@xmath3   , \\label{annni1}%\\ ] ] where the sum is over all lattice sites , and @xmath4 is a spin-@xmath0 variable at site @xmath5 .",
    "we assume ferromagnetic interactions , @xmath6 , between nearest - neighbor sites on the @xmath7 planes , and competing ferromagnetic , @xmath8 , and antiferromagnetic , @xmath9 , interactions between nearest and next - nearest neighbors along the axial @xmath10 direction .",
    "we then introduce a parameter @xmath11 to gauge the strength of the competitions , and look at the @xmath12 phase diagram , where @xmath13 is the absolute temperature . at zero temperature , with @xmath14 , one easily shows that the ground state is a trivial ferromagnet . for @xmath15",
    ", however , the ground state displays a peculiar antiferromagnetic structure , which has been called a @xmath16 phase , with two planes of @xmath17 spins followed by two planes of @xmath18 spins , along the @xmath10 direction . in the special ( multiphase ) point @xmath19 ,",
    "the ground state becomes infinitely degenerate , with the coexistence of a ferromagnetic phase , the antiphase @xmath20 , associated with a period of @xmath21 lattice spacings along the @xmath10 direction , and a multiplicity of modulated phases of larger periods @xcite@xcite .",
    "several theoretical approaches have been used to account for the complex @xmath22 phase diagram of the annni model , including careful layer - by - layer mean - field calculations @xcite@xcite@xcite , monte carlo simulations @xcite@xcite and analyses of ( exact ) low - temperature series expansions @xcite@xcite . at finite temperature ,",
    "all of these calculations indicate the springing from the multiphase point of larger - period modulated phases . in particular , early mean - field calculations by selke and duxbury @xcite , which are in asymptotic agreement with",
    "the analysis of the low - temperature series expansions , support the existence of a branching process of ramification that explains the onset of new modulated phases at higher temperatures .",
    "more recent self - consistent @xcite@xcite and monte carlo @xcite calculations may differ in a number of details , but do confirm the general qualitative features of the @xmath12 phase diagrams .",
    "taking into account the relevance of the annni model , and some remaining questions about the @xmath12 phase diagram in the region of intermediate temperatures , in special the need of a better characterization of the devil 's staircase behavior of the succession of commensurate modulated structures , we decided to revisit this problem and check some points .",
    "we then consider the exact formulation of a special annni model , with fully connected spins at each layer , which amounts to solving the original problem in the layer - by - layer mean - field approximation with the addition of spin fluctuations along the axial direction .",
    "in other words , we investigate the effects of the introduction of additional fluctuations in the old mean - field calculations . this layered - connected annni model , which we call lc - annni , can also be obtained from the usual annni model hamiltonian on a hypercubic lattice in the limit of infinite coordination of the spins on each layer . in this limit",
    ", we assume a coordination @xmath23 within each layer , with pair interactions of the form @xmath24 , and a fixed value of @xmath25 .",
    "spin variables on each layer are fully connected , but we preserve the short - range character of the competing interactions ( and correlations ) along the @xmath10 direction . the free energy of this special model can be written exactly , leading to equations of state that can be numerically analyzed in great detail .",
    "the layout of this paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii we define the lc - annni model , write an exact expression for the free energy , and establish the equations of state , which are amenable to a detailed numerical analysis . also , we describe the equivalent layer - by - layer mean - field approximation for the analogous annni model .",
    "a global @xmath12 phase diagram is obtained in section iii , which also contains some comments on the previous mean - field results . except for some expected quantitative changes , due to taking into account additional axial fluctuations",
    ", we do agree with the mean - field calculations of selke and duxbury @xcite , including the branching process , and the recovery of the asymptotic domain - wall analysis near the multiphase point .",
    "we draw some graphs of the main wave number of the modulated structures as a function of @xmath26 , for fixed values of @xmath13 , and perform a detailed numerical analysis of the fractal character of these devil 's staircases .",
    "we obtain numerical values for the hausdorff dimension @xmath27 of these fractal structures , and show that @xmath1 increases with temperature , with a limiting value @xmath28 , which seems to be a common feature of several problems represented by area - preserving maps @xcite , and does support the view that the commensurate modulated structures occupy most of the ordered region of the @xmath12 phase diagram .",
    "some concluding remarks are presented in the final section .",
    "the hamiltonian of the analog of the annni model with fully connected spins at each layer , which we call lc - annni model , is given by a sum of a long - range , mean - field term , @xmath29 , and a short - range term that includes the axial interactions,@xmath30 with@xmath31 and@xmath32   , \\label{sr}%\\ ] ] where we assume that there are @xmath33 sites along the sides of a cubic lattice .",

    "similar results had already been obtained in previous calculations for the annni model , which were , however , limited to the analysis of the paramagnetic border @xcite@xcite .",
    "the mean - field equations ( [ eme ] ) were solved numerically using quadruple precision .",
    "all integer values of @xmath53 should be considered to obtain the modulated structures that minimize the free energy functional ( [ fi2 ] ) . however , since this is not feasible , earlier calculations were limited to a relatively small set of modulated phases ( with @xmath100 ) @xcite@xcite .",
    "a real advance in these calculations has been achieved by selke and duxbury @xcite@xcite , with the proposal of a structure combination branching mechanism to explain the onset of different commensurate phases at increasing temperatures . according to this mechanism , at @xmath101 ,",
    "the boundaries between two adjacent modulated phases , which we call @xmath94 and @xmath102 , will become unstable against a new intervening phase @xmath103 .",

    "these phases will become unstable against the new intervening phase @xmath106 . in more general terms , given the phases @xmath107 and @xmath108 , with @xmath109 , @xmath45 , @xmath110 , ... ,  we have the new intervening phase @xmath111 .    in fig . 1",
    ", we show the main commensurate structures in the @xmath12 phase diagram , with @xmath112 , and @xmath113 . we have four large regions : paramagnetic , ferromagnetic ( ferro ) , the antiphase @xmath20 , and the large region of modulated structures .",
    "according to the expectations , the paramagnetic critical border meets tangentially the first - order ferro - modulated border at the lifshitz point ( lp ) . as the temperature increases",
    ", we checked that long - period structures become stable in smaller regions of this phase diagram .",
    "we recall that the notation @xmath114 means that there are @xmath110 planes of @xmath17 spins followed by @xmath110 planes of @xmath18 spins along the axial direction .",
    "although we use a different temperature scale , the general qualitative topology of this phase diagram is the same as obtained in the earlier mean - field calculations .",
    "modulated phases @xmath16 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 , and @xmath117 still occupy large portions of the modulated region .    in the vicinity of the multiphase point , both the lc - annni and the standard annni model display the same qualitative features .",
    "simple periodic structures of the type @xmath118 still play a major role at low temperatures .",
    "in addition , the @xmath116 phase displays a range of stability between @xmath119 and @xmath114 .",
    "this behavior is consistent with the predictions of the domain - wall analysis for sufficiently anisotropic cases @xcite . in all of our calculations ,",
    "we have fully confirmed the branching mechanism , which keeps working in the modulated regions , as the temperature increases , and helps to drastically reduce the number of phases to be analyzed .",
    "the wave number of the new modulated phase is in the interval between the wave numbers of the parent modulated phases , according to the rule for the construction of a farey tree . as the temperature increases",

    "we now turn to the question of the fractal dimension of the @xmath129 versus @xmath26 graphs .",
    "we use a well - known box - counting algorithm to estimate the fractal dimension of the set of points that remain in an interval of values of @xmath129 if we subtract all of the intervals corresponding to plateaux of the commensurate phases larger than a certain ( limiting small ) width .",
