    "there is growing interest in the low - temperature electrical transport phenomena of perovskite manganites in order to elucidate the microscopic origin of the colossal magnetoresistance ( cmr ) effect.@xcite recent studies on single crystals of the three - dimensional 3d pseudocubic compounds r@xmath21a@xmath22mno@xmath23 ( @xmath24 is a trivalent rare - earth ion and @xmath25 is a divalent alkaline - earth ion ) show a @xmath26 dependence of the resistivity,@xcite which has been interpreted as either electron - electron @xcite or one - magnon @xcite scattering .",
    "however , low - temperature resistivity measurements of epitaxial thin films of la@xmath21ca@xmath22mno@xmath23 provide support for the presence of small - polaron conduction in the ferromagnetic ( fm ) state.@xcite in the same system , a @xmath12 term attributed to electron - magnon scattering was also found in the @xmath0 dependence of resistivity at low - temperatures.@xcite therefore , the low - temperature electrical transport mechanism of manganites remains controversial and is far from being fully understood .",
    "the bilayer manganite la@xmath27sr@xmath28mn@xmath6o@xmath7 has proven to be a fruitful system for understanding the cmr and has become the focus of many recent investigations.@xcite this is an ideal system for the study of the low - temperature conduction mechanism .",
    "its reduced dimensionality gives rise to anisotropic characteristics of charge transport and magnetic properties and also enhances the cmr effect near the magnetic transition temperature , although at the cost of reducing it to about 100 k.@xcite the magnetic structure of heavily doped bilayer compounds always shows the coexistence of fm and antiferromagnetic ( afm ) correlations.@xcite the magnetic correlations are predominantly fm within the two - dimensional mno@xmath6 layers , while the magnetic coupling between the mno@xmath6 layers changes from fm for @xmath29 0.4 to canted afm for @xmath30 0.4 .",
    "the interplay between fm double exchange and afm superexchange interactions between mn ions in these compounds becomes more subtle and is expected to be responsible for the unusual transport properties observed in the bilayer manganites . for examples ,",
    "( i ) an up - turn in the resistivity at low temperatures is generally observed for the @xmath31 0.30,@xcite 0.35,@xcite 0.38,@xcite and 0.4@xcite samples ; ( ii ) despite the anisotropic crystal structure,@xcite @xmath2 and @xmath3 of the @xmath31 0.38 compound display virtually identical temperature dependences at low - temperatures , indicating the same conduction mechanism in both @xmath32 and @xmath33 directions.@xcite    a lot of effort has been devoted to understanding the low - temperature electrical transport properties of bilayer manganites .",
    "okuda , kimura , and tokura @xcite found that the in - plane conductivity @xmath17 of @xmath31 0.35 single crystals is almost proportional to @xmath19 for @xmath16 4 k , indicating weak localization .",
    "this square - root temperature dependence of @xmath17 was also observed in the @xmath31 0.40 samples.@xcite recently , abrikosov , based on the theory of quantum interference , has shown that @xmath34 and @xmath35 should be isotropic and proportional to @xmath36 ( the phase coherence destruction probability @xmath37 for the 3d conduction ) in the 3d ( low - temperature ) regime.@xcite it is , therefore , desirable from the experimental point of view to determine @xmath35 of bilayer manganites and , hence , to establish which scattering mechanism is mainly responsible for the low - temperature transport properties of this system .",
    "an important question is also whether there is any common conduction mechanism responsible for the low - temperature electrical transport in both the infinite - layer and bilayer manganites .    in this paper , we address the above issues through resistivity measurements on la@xmath4sr@xmath5mn@xmath6o@xmath7 single crystals , performed at low temperatures and in magnetic fields applied parallel to the @xmath32 plane .",
    "the anisotropic resistivities @xmath10 and @xmath11 are proportional to @xmath12 in the intermediate temperature regime below @xmath38 .",
    "this points toward a two - magnon scattering mechanism responsible for the electrical dissipation in this @xmath0 range .",
    "the validity of this scattering mechanism is further supported by the @xmath1 dependence of the proportionality coefficients @xmath39 obtained by fitting the data and by the fact that the value of @xmath13 and the ratio of the exchange interaction @xmath14 obtained by fitting the data are in excellent agreement with the calculated @xmath15 based on the two - magnon model and @xmath14 deduced from neutron scattering , respectively . at lower temperatures , in the non - metallic regime ( @xmath40 ) , _ both _ anisotropic conductivities @xmath34 and @xmath35 exhibit a @xmath19 dependence , a result of electron - electron correlations , which is consistent with the weak localization effect in a 3d disordered metal .",
    "the common mechanisms responsible for both the in - plane and out - of - plane electrical transport indicate the 3d metallic nature of the bilayer manganite la@xmath4sr@xmath5mn@xmath6o@xmath7 at @xmath20 .",
    "single crystals of la@xmath4sr@xmath5mn@xmath6o@xmath7 were grown from sintered rods of the same nominal composition by the floating zone method using a mirror furnace , as described in detail elsewhere.@xcite plate - shaped crystals were separated mechanically from the bar .",

    "@xcite the up - turn in the resistivity of la@xmath4sr@xmath5mn@xmath6o@xmath7 at low temperatures is accompanied by a decrease of the @xmath48 susceptibility , which is related to the reentrant spin glass phase,@xcite an indication of a crossover from a fm to a canted state.@xcite the canted structure at low temperatures comes from the competing interactions along the @xmath33-axis mn - o - mn bonds , @xmath59 the afm superexchange interaction between half - filled @xmath60 orbitals and the fm double - exchange interaction via @xmath61 conduction electrons.@xcite    in ordinary fm metals , the contribution to resistance from the @xmath62-@xmath63 interaction is known to be proportional to @xmath26 at low temperatures.@xcite this @xmath26 dependence of resistivity has been generally observed in single crystals of la@xmath21sr@xmath22mno@xmath23 ( x @xmath64 0.18),@xcite la@xmath21ca@xmath22mno@xmath23 ( x @xmath65 0.22),@xcite and la@xmath66(pb , ca)@xmath67mno@xmath23,@xcite and has been attributed to either electron - electron @xcite or one - magnon @xcite scattering . however , our low - temperature resistivities data ( 50 k @xmath68 110 k ) of la@xmath4sr@xmath5mn@xmath6o@xmath7 single crystals measured in various applied magnetic fields do not follow a @xmath69 dependence of the form @xmath70 .",

    "this indicates that the conduction mechanism in this bilayer manganite is different from that in the infinite - layer compounds .",
    "in fact , specific heat measurements on bilayer manganites @xcite show that their reduced dimensionality , compared to infinite - layer manganites , enhances the magnetic specific heat , but does not affect the electronic specific heat coefficient @xmath72 , indicating the presence of an anomalous carrier scattering process such as electron - phonon , electron - magnon , or a combination of them .",

    "we found that our resistivity data of la@xmath4sr@xmath5mn@xmath6o@xmath7 can not be adequately fitted with this expression . presently , there is no experimental evidence for the presence of small polarons in the fm state of bilayer manganites .",
    "in fact , recent raman scattering data on la@xmath4sr@xmath5mn@xmath6o@xmath7 single crystals suggest the formation of small polarons _ only _ at @xmath78.@xcite moreover , x - ray and neutron scattering measurements @xcite on la@xmath4sr@xmath5mn@xmath6o@xmath7 directly demonstrate that the polarons disappear abruptly at the fm transition because of the sudden charge delocalization .",
    "on the other hand , the giant magnetothermal conductivity @xcite observed in la@xmath4sr@xmath5mn@xmath6o@xmath7 indicates that spin - fluctuation scattering or magnon contribution is dominant over other carrier scattering processes .",
    "kubo and ohata @xcite calculated the low - temperature resistance produced by scattering of holes by spin waves , on the basis of an effective hamiltonian for double exchange in the spin wave approximation .",

    "this value of @xmath15 has the same order of magnitude as the fitting parameter @xmath13 , showing that the two - magnon scattering can account for the @xmath0 dependence of resistivity of la@xmath4sr@xmath5mn@xmath6o@xmath7 in the metallic range of temperatures .    in a conventional heisenberg system ,",

    "the decrease of @xmath13 and @xmath117 with increasing @xmath1 is the source of the small negative magnetoresistance for 50 @xmath116 110 k. their @xmath1 dependence is also consistent with the spin wave scattering mechanism .",

    "<S> the temperature @xmath0 and magnetic field @xmath1 dependence of anisotropic in - plane @xmath2 and out - of - plane @xmath3 resistivities have been investigated in single crystals of the bilayer manganite la@xmath4sr@xmath5mn@xmath6o@xmath7 . below the curie transition temperature @xmath8 125 k , @xmath2 and @xmath3 display almost the same temperature dependence with an up - turn around 50 k. in the metallic regime ( 50 k @xmath9 110 k ) , both @xmath10 and @xmath11 follow a @xmath12 dependence , consistent with the two - magnon scattering . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the value of the proportionality coefficient @xmath13 and the ratio of the exchange interaction @xmath14 obtained by fitting the data are in excellent agreement with the calculated @xmath15 based on the two - magnon model and @xmath14 deduced from neutron scattering , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> this provides further support for this scattering mechanism . at even lower @xmath0 , in the non - metallic regime ( @xmath16 50 </S>",
    "<S> k ) , _ both _ the in - plane @xmath17 and out - of - plane @xmath18 conductivities obey a @xmath19 dependence , consistent with weak localization effects . hence , this demonstrates the three - dimensional metallic nature of the bilayer manganite la@xmath4sr@xmath5mn@xmath6o@xmath7 at @xmath20 . </S>"
