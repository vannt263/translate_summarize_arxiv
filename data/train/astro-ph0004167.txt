    "classical novae are rather frequently observed in our galaxy ( liller & mayer 1987 , shafter 1997 ) , and have also been studied in external galaxies ; typically @xmath2 34 per year are detected in our galaxy ( duerbeck 1995 , warner 1995 ) .",
    "most of the discoveries and observations of galactic novae have been made by amateur astronomers with little access to spectroscopic and photometric equipment .",
    "sky coverage has been episodic and extremely hard to calculate .",
    "classification attempts have also been hindered . as a result , many of the most basic properties involving their global rate and distribution are surprisingly uncertain . for example , a number of arguments suggest that the galactic rate of novae must be much higher than @xmath3 :    \\(a ) the typical limiting apparent magnitude obtainable with amateur apparatus and methods has been increasing steadily in recent years , but for the period covered by this paper may be taken to be @xmath4 , within a very wide range , and with extremely uneven coverage .",
    "application of the expanding - photosphere method to a subset of relatively nearby and bright novae has yielded the empirical relation @xmath5 ( warner 1995 ) for the absolute magnitude , where @xmath6 ( the _ speed class _ ) is the time taken for @xmath7 to increase by 2 from discovery .",
    "it follows that the distance out to which amateur astronomers are detecting typical novae is @xmath8 kpc , or only about one - half the volume of the galaxy .",
    "furthermore , the rate of discoveries at the faintest magnitudes ( @xmath9 ) is greater than what would be extrapolated from brighter novae .",
    "this indicates that a new population  presumably associated with the galactic bulge rather than the disk  is present and poorly sampled ( duerbeck 1990 ; see below ) .",
    "\\(b ) even within that part of the galaxy which is effectively searched for novae , the discovery rate is blatantly incomplete",
    ". not only does the discovery rate for novae with @xmath10 fall below the extrapolated rate for brighter events ( thus , in contrast to the preceding argument , suggesting that many events in this range are missed : duerbeck 1990 ) , but there is a marked deficiency of discoveries in the southern celestial hemisphere ( warner 1995 ) .",
    "this is relevant to our work , since the tgrs detector is permanently pointed at the southern sky (  2.1 ) . during its period of operation ( 19951997 )",
    "five novae were discovered in the southern hemisphere ( harris et al .",
    "1999 , hereafter paper i ) , but there is no way of knowing how many were missed . a few days ) which rise and fall in between successive visits to a given location . ] the possibility of detecting undiscovered novae as bright as @xmath11 ( marginally within tgrs s capabilities ) is one of the justifications for the present work .",
    "\\(c ) in galactic latitude , the distribution of classical novae is somewhat concentrated toward the equatorial plane ( scale heights for disk and bulge populations 125 and 500 pc respectively : duerbeck 1984 , 1990 ) .",
    "they must therefore be affected to some degree by interstellar extinction , and a deficiency of discoveries close to the plane is indeed observed ( warner 1995 ) .    in terms of the composition of their ejecta , novae are classified into co - rich and one - rich ; it is thought that the distinction reflects the composition of the underlying white dwarf material , with the one class coming from more massive progenitors whose cores burned beyond the early he - burning stage which yields c and o. different levels of positron annihilation line flux are expected from each class (  4 ) .",
    "if the progenitors of the one subclass are really more massive , they will tend to lie closer to the galactic plane , and the resulting novae will be more strongly affected by extinction and relatively under - represented in the discovered sample ( of which they compose @xmath12 : gehrz et al .",
    "evidence of this has been detected by della valle et al .",
    "( 1992 ) .",
    "\\(d ) the three preceding factors would all tend to enhance the true galactic nova rate above that observed .",
    "however , a second , quite distinct approach to the problem tends to produce systematically lower rates . in this approach",
    ", several external galaxies ( particularly the magellanic clouds , m31 and m33 ) have been monitored for novae , and their observed rates extrapolated in some fashion to the milky way ( ciardullo et al .",
    "1987 , della valle & livio 1994 ) .",
    "the usual basis for extrapolation is absolute blue luminosity ( della valle & claudi 1990 ) . as can be seen in table 1 , the results from this approach are systematically smaller than attempts to correct for the missing galactic novae directly .",
    "the original explanation for this effect was provided by duerbeck ( 1990 ) , who postulated two different classes of event by spatial distribution  disk and bulge novae .",
    "it was claimed that the bulge population has a systematically slower speed class , and is therefore generally less luminous by equations ( 13 ) , which might account for the discrepancy , given a larger bulge in the main external source of novae , m31 . as will be seen (  4.1 ) ,",
    "our search method is probably relevant only to a disk population .",
    "a third approach to the problem is theoretically possible , by which classical nova outbursts are assumed to be part of a life - cycle of which other cataclysmic variables are manifestations .",
    "the galactic nova rate is then derived from the assumed space densities of these related objects , together with some model for the outburst recurrence time ( warner 1995 ) .",
    "this approach is more reliable at predicting the galactic space density rather than the global rate , which is more directly related to the measurements we shall present .",
    "it is important to correct for and combine these various factors into an overall global galactic nova rate , which would govern the input of novae into galactic chemical evolution , dust grains and interstellar radioactivity ( gehrz et al . 1998 ) .",
    "however attempts to do so have yielded wildly discordant results , ranging from 11260 novae yr@xmath13 ( see table 1 ) .",
    "we have therefore adopted in this work yet a fourth ( and simplest ) approach which is to make an _ unbiased _ search for novae in our galaxy .",
    "the detection of @xmath14-ray lines from radioactive decays of the nucleosynthesis products produced in novae is such an approach ; these decays in general emit positrons , whose annihilation with electrons produces a line at 511 kev .",
    "an obvious advantage of this approach is the very small absorption of @xmath14-rays in the galaxy .",
    "we will also see that problems of uneven coverage and sensitivity are minimal .",
    "these advantages are realised when the @xmath14-ray detector tgrs , on board the _ wind _ mission , is used (  2.1 ) .    in paper",
    "i we determined that tgrs does indeed have the capability to perform a sky survey for classical novae .",
    "the target of paper i was to detect the positron annihilation line in five known novae ; although none was detected , the viability of such a method was established .",
    "the key to the method ( see  2 below ) is that the line arises in nova material expanding towards the observer , and is therefore broadened and blueshifted ( leising & clayton 1987 ) .",
    "its peak is therefore shifted away from a strong background line at exactly 511 kev , which arises in the instrument itself from decays of unstable nuclei produced by cosmic ray spallation .    in the next section",
    "we give a brief description of the detector and data , and of our analysis .",
    "none of these is substantially different from that of paper i , where the reader may find a more detailed description .",
    "the tgrs experiment is very well suited to a search for the 511 kev line , for several reasons .",
    "first , it is located on board the _ wind _ spacecraft whose orbit is so elliptical that it has spent virtually all of its mission since 1994 november in interplanetary space , where the @xmath14-ray background level is relatively low .",
    "second , these backgrounds are not only low but very stable over time .",
    "third , tgrs is attached to the south - facing surface of the rotating cylindrical _ wind _ body , which points permanently toward the south ecliptic pole .",
    "the detector is unshielded , and tgrs therefore has an unobstructed view of the entire southern ecliptic hemisphere .",
    "taken together , these three facts make possible a continuous and complete survey of the southern sky .",
    "fourth , and most importantly , the tgrs ge detector has sufficient spectral resolution to detect a 511 kev line which is slightly doppler - shifted away from the background 511 kev line mentioned in  1 . the doppler blueshift in the nova line , for the epochs @xmath1512 hr which we consider , is predicted to be 25 kev ( hernanz 1999 , kudryashov 2000 ) , which compares with the tgrs energy resolution at 511 kev of 34 kev fwhm ( harris et al .",
    "1998 and paper i ) .",
    "the tgrs detector is a radiatively cooled 35 @xmath16 n - type ge crystal sensitive to energies between 20 kev8 mev . since the launch of _ wind _ in 1994 november ,",
    "tgrs has accumulated count rates continuously in this energy range .",
    "the few gaps in the data stream are due either to perigee passes , which are rare ( lasting @xmath17 d at several month intervals ) thanks to _ wind _ s very eccentric orbit , or to memory readouts following solar flare or @xmath14-ray burst triggers , which may last for @xmath18 hr . the data were binned in 1 kev energy bins during 24 min intervals .",
    "we searched in data covering a period of nearly three years , from 1995 january to 1997 october . in the fall of 1997",
    "the performance of the detector began to degrade seriously , and the energy resolution became too coarse to resolve the 511 kev background and nova lines .",
    "this degradation is believed to result from crystal defects induced by accumulated cosmic ray impacts , which trap semiconductor holes and reverse the impurity charge status .",
    "a region of the crystal thus becomes undepleted and the effective area is reduced ( kurczynski et al .",
    "we terminated our search of the data when the photopeak effective area at 511 kev fell below an estimated 80% of its original value .",
    "the total live time accumulated was about @xmath19 s , which was nominally 88% of the entire interval .",
    "in fact , the distribution of live times among the 6 hr intervals was such that 41% of all intervals had the full 6 hr of live time , and almost 99% of intervals contained some live time .",
    "our analysis procedure relies heavily on the most recently theoretically - predicted properties of the 511 kev line ( hernanz et al .",
    "1999 , kudryashov 2000 ) , mainly its light - curve , energy and shape .",
    "the timescale over which the background spectra described above are summed is set by the predicted @xmath14-ray light - curve from the `` thermonuclear flash '' which powers a nova . in this process",
    "a degenerate accreted h layer on the surface of a co or one white dwarf ignites proton capture reactions involving both accreted material and some material dredged up from the interior of the white dwarf .",
    "the timescale for this process is set by the @xmath0-decay timescales of the unstable nucleosynthesis products of rapid proton capture on c , o and ne .",
    "these unstable species fall into two groups , one having very rapid decays ( @xmath20 minutes : e.g. @xmath21n , @xmath22o , @xmath23f ) and the more slow - decaying @xmath24f ( @xmath25 min ) .",
    "the light - curve results from the convolution of these decays with the reduction of opacity to 511 kev @xmath14-rays due to envelope expansion ; it thus tends to be double - peaked at values @xmath2010100 s and @xmath2036 hr ( gmez - gomar et al .",
    "1998 ) , with significant emission lasting for @xmath26 hr ( hernanz et al . 1999 ) .",
    "the 10100 s peak is ultimately due to the decay of the very short - lived group of isotopes , and is thus especially prominent in the co nova light - curve ( though these isotopes are essential to the energetics of both classes ) .",
    "the 36 hr peak reflects the survival of slower - decaying @xmath24f in both classes ( gmez - gomar et al .",
    "1998 ) .    with these timescales in mind",
    ", we summed the 24-min background spectra into 6 hr intervals the 4005 resulting 6-hr spectra were fit by a model ( described in paper i ) containing the strong background 511 kev line at rest , and a broadened blueshifted nova line .",
    "the energies of the nova line were fixed at the predicted values ( 516 kev after 6 hr , dropping to 513 kev after 12 hr : gmez - gomar et al .",
    "1998 , hernanz et al .",
    "1999 , kudryashov 2000 ) .",
    "the widths were taken to be 8 kev fwhm and the shapes to be gaussian , as in paper i ; the shapes are poorly documented in published models , but the approximation is probably reasonable at an epoch of a few hours ( leising & clayton 1987 ) .",
    "instrumental broadenings of these lines and of the background 511 kev line were very small during 19951997 ( harris et al .",
    "although our analysis is somewhat sensitive to the departure of the actual line parameters from these predictions , we believe that it should be adequate to detect lines in the parameter range appropriate for fast novae .",
    "for example , we estimate that lines with energies in the range 513522 kev are detected with @xmath27% of true amplitude , corresponding to expansion velocities 12006500 km s@xmath13 which bracket the range observed in fast novae ( warner 1995 ) .",
    "the 4005 count spectra were fit to the above model ( plus an underlying constant term ) and the line amplitudes were divided by the photopeak effective area at 511 kev .",
    "this photopeak efficiency was determined from monte carlo simulations as a function of energy and zenith angle ( seifert et al .",
    "1997 ) , taking into account the effects of hole - trapping in the detector (  2.1 ) ; we found that the efficiency remained extremely stable until the fall of 1997 , whereupon it rapidly fell to 80% of its value at launch .",
    "the effective area is a slowly varying function of the zenith angle of the source . to calculate the average effective area",
    ", we assumed the galactic distribution of the synthetic population of several thousand novae computed by hatano et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , for the southern part of which the mean tgrs zenith angle is @xmath28 , corresponding to an effective area 13.6 @xmath16 .",
    "the fits were performed by the standard method of varying the model parameters to minimize the quantity @xmath29 , with errors on the parameters computed from the parameter range where @xmath29 exceeded the minimum by + 1 ( paper i ) .    with a sufficiently large sample of spectra , there is a probability that a fitted line of any given amplitude may be produced by chance .",
    "we therefore imposed a rather high value of significance as the threshold above which a detection would be established . if the significances are normally distributed ( see  3 below ) then our sample size of 4005 spectra implies that a threshold level of @xmath30 yields a probability @xmath31% of a single false detection by chance ( abramowitz & stegun 1964 ) .",
    "a typical fit to a 6 hr spectrum is shown in figure 1 ( there is a more detailed discussion in paper i ) .",
    "the fits are generally acceptable , with values of @xmath29/d.o.f .",
    "close to 1 .",
    "the amplitudes of the nova lines are significantly positive in all cases ( see below ) .",
    "this arises from a significant departure of the blue wing of the 511 kev background line from the gaussian shape assumed in the fits , whose origin is unclear ( paper i ) .    the full series of measurements for a nova line of fwhm 8 kev and blueshift 5 kev , ( parameters corresponding to typical predicted values after 6 hr : hernanz et al .",
    "1999 and paper i ) is shown in figure 2 .",
    "it can be seen that the systematic positive offset mentioned above was extremely stable throughout the mission ; there are very weak linear trends on @xmath20year timescales which are almost invisible in fig .",
    "we subtracted this quasi - constant systematic value from all nova line measurements .",
    "a very similar time series was obtained for a nova line at position predicted for 12 hr after the explosion ( 513 kev ) , except that the error bars were very much larger ( see paper i ,  3.4 ) . each fitted 6 hr line was combined with the following 12 hr fit in the proportions suggested by the light curve of hernanz et al .",
    "the results closely resembled those of fig . 2 after subtraction of the quasi - constant systematic , since the 12 hr lines contributed little on account of their large error bars .",
    "it is also clear from inspection of fig .",
    "2 that there are no highly significant line amplitudes lying above the mean .",
    "we further show in figure 3 that the distribution of significant deviations from the mean is very close to normal .",
    "the variability in the error bars comes almost entirely from the variability in live times , which is small (  2.1 ) .",
    "there is therefore a well - defined mean @xmath32 error of @xmath33 photon @xmath34 s@xmath13 ( compare results of paper i for zenith angle @xmath28 ) . the @xmath30 threshold based on this average error",
    "is shown by a dotted line in fig .",
    "the only points lying above this line are a few 6 hr periods with low live time and large errors .",
    "we therefore conclude that no previously - undetected novae were discovered by tgrs during 19951997 , in an almost unbiased search covering a live time of @xmath19 s.",
    "recent developments in the theory of nucleosynthesis in classical novae ( hernanz et al .",
    "1999 ) have been discouraging for our purpose of a positron annihilation @xmath14-ray search , since new measurements of nuclear reaction rates have led to much lower predictions of the flux in this line after 6 and 12 hr .",
    "the discussion in paper i of the capability of constraining the global galactic nova rate using our present results was therefore over - optimistic .",
    "nevertheless , we will discuss the application of our method in general terms , so that even though important constraints can not now be derived , it may be useful for more sensitive future experiments ( e.g. _ integral _ ) or for more optimistic theoretical predictions .",
    "a formal expression for the number of novae detectable by tgrs is @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the galactic nova rate ; @xmath37 is a given ( time varying ) threshold flux for detection by tgrs ; @xmath38 is the fraction of the mass of the galaxy within tgrs s detection radius @xmath39 and @xmath40 ; @xmath41 is the total tgrs live time ; @xmath42 is the fraction of tgrs live time for which @xmath43 ; @xmath44 is the distribution of white dwarf masses in classical novae ; and @xmath45 is the predicted 511 kev line flux at 1 kpc for mass @xmath46 .",
    "the white dwarf mass distribution in novae , @xmath47 , is very poorly known . whereas field white dwarf",
    "masses appear to peak at @xmath48 and to decline in number for higher masses up to the chandrasekhar limit @xmath49 ( warner 1990 ) , the mass distribution in nova systems must be weighted towards higher masses .",
    "this is because the thermonuclear runaway occurs when the basal pressure of the material accreted onto the white dwarf exceeds some critical value .",
    "the critical pressure is proportional to the -4 power of the white dwarf radius , to the white dwarf mass , and to the accreted mass . since white dwarf radii decrease with increasing white dwarf mass ,",
    "the accreted mass necessary to reach critical pressure is a strongly decreasing function of white dwarf mass .",
    "if the accretion rate from the secondary star is roughly independent of white dwarf mass , it follows that explosions on more massive white dwarfs will recur after much shorter intervals ( gehrz et al .",
    "there have not been reliable measurements of this effect , although theory indicates that the ratio of one : co novae of 1:2 is compatible with a distribution peaking at about @xmath50 ( truran & livio 1986 ) .",
    "further , the mass ranges corresponding to the co and one compositions are poorly known and may well overlap ( livio & truran 1994 ) .",
    "theoretical predictions of 511 kev line emission are only available for a few values of @xmath46 . in table 2",
    "we show the parameters of the most recent models suitable for use in eq .",
    "( 4 ) ( hernanz et al . 1999 ) .",
    "earlier models suggest that emission from lower - mass co white dwarf events is considerably less ( gmez - gomar et al .",
    "1998 ) . in view of the remarks above about the one : co ratio , we will make the crude assumption that the ratio of `` low mass '' co objects to `` high mass '' co objects to one objects is 1:1:1 , where `` high mass '' co objects have the properties given in table 2 and `` low mass '' co objects are assumed to produce no 511 kev line emission at all .",
    "this eliminates the integral over _ m _ in eq .",
    "the remaining integral in eq .",
    "( 4 ) can be approximated by the value of the integrand when @xmath37 has its mean value  this follows from our result in   2.1 , 3 that the variation of live times in our sample ( and therefore of the errors in fig .",
    "2 ) is very small . for a given model in table 2 , therefore , taking @xmath51 photon @xmath34 s@xmath13 , the problem is reduced to the computation of the fraction @xmath52 of galactic mass which lies within the radius @xmath53 kpc .    as an example , let us consider the hernanz et al .",
    "( 1999 ) model of a @xmath54 co nova from table 2 . here",
    "@xmath55 photon @xmath34 s@xmath13 , so that @xmath56 kpc . within this value of @xmath39",
    "we determined that 0.61% of the galaxy s mass resides , according to the widely used bahcall - soneira model of the galaxy ( bahcall & soneira 1984 ) : one - half of this value ( i.e. the southern hemisphere ) gives @xmath57 . for the @xmath54 co model , eq .",
    "( 1 ) then reduces to @xmath58 .",
    "our upper limit for @xmath59 is @xmath60 , with 63% probability ( for poisson - distributed events : gehrels 1986 ) , and the live time is @xmath19 s (  2.1 ) , giving us a 63% upper limit on the rate of `` high - mass '' co novae of @xmath61 yr@xmath13 .",
    "this is quite close to the exact value 123 yr@xmath13 obtained by explicitly integrating eq .",
    "( 4 ) over @xmath37 ( table 2 ) .    in the same way we obtain an upper limit of 238 yr@xmath13 on the rate of novae occurring on one white dwarfs from hernanz et",
    "al.s ( 1999 ) prediction .",
    "our best result comes from the co model in table 2 , which we have assumed to be one - third of the total , from which we derive a global galactic nova rate of @xmath62 yr@xmath13 .",
    "uncertainties in this value clearly arise from uncertainties in the nova models , in the fraction of white dwarfs in nova systems of each type , in the bahcall - soneira model , and in the possibility of distinct spheroid and disk nova populations having differing rates , since our typical detection radius @xmath31 kpc includes almost none of the bahcall - soneira spheroid .",
    "since our results do not significantly constrain previous measurements of the nova rate ( table 1 ) , we do not make estimates of these errors , which will require attention from other , more sensitive experiments ( see next section ) .",
    "an attempt has been made , using the batse instrument on the _ compton _ observatory , to detect 511 kev line emission from a recent nearby nova ( v382 vel ) by a similar method to that used here and in paper i ( hernanz et al .",
    "the advantage of observing with batse over tgrs is its much larger effective area .",
    "its disadvantages are much poorer energy resolution with a nai spectrometer , and a background varying on very short ( @xmath63 min ) timescales .",
    "the sensitivities achieved are comparable to those obtained here .",
    "degradation of the ge detector (  2.1 ) prevented tgrs from achieving comparable sensitivity on v382 vel ( harris et al .",
    "2000 ) , so future efforts in this field will rely on batse and on the _ integral _ mission , which is scheduled for launch in 2001 september carrying a ge spectrometer ( spi ) with resolution comparable to tgrs but a much larger effective area .",
    "hernanz et al .",
    "( 1999 ) estimated that spi could detect the model novae of table 2 out to @xmath64 kpc .",
    "however they also pointed out that the short duration of the 511 kev line emission would make it difficult for _ integral _ to slew to a candidate event .",
    "thus the detection rate would be limited to novae within the spi field of view , which is @xmath65 fwhm .",
    "the search method which we have used , i.e. an _ ex post facto _ search in background spectra , ought to be perfectly feasible with _",
    "integral_. the chief requirements for this method are very high energy resolution and a sufficiently low and stable background . while the spi detector has excellent resolution , the background level in it has not yet been rigorously computed . nevertheless , qualitative arguments suggest that the background will be no worse than that in tgrs . like _ wind",
    "_ , _ integral _ will be in a high - altitude elliptical orbit which avoids extensive exposure to earth s trapped radiation belts and to albedo @xmath14-rays from earth s atmosphere .",
    "the main disadvantages of _ integral _ for nova detection are the small spi field of view and the planned observing strategy which cuts down the amount of time spent pointing towards the main concentration of novae near the galactic center .",
    "we can make use of the planned program of integral observations of the central galactic radian in the first year of operation ( winkler et al .",
    "1999 ) to estimate the rate at which novae might be detected in the spi data . as previously",
    ", we assume that novae follow the bahcall & soneira ( 1984 ) galactic distribution .",
    "the planned first - year _ integral _ observations may be approximated by a @xmath66 grid with @xmath67 spacing between @xmath68 and @xmath69 , the exposure to each point being 1180 s per pass , with 12 passes per year covering the whole grid .",
    "thus the live time for the whole grid is 0.153 yr . from the bahcall - soneira model , the pointing geometry , and the spi aperture @xmath65 we calculated that the _ integral _ detection radius @xmath64 kpc intercepts @xmath200.75% of the galactic nova distribution .",
    "the live time 0.153 yr is then multiplied by a typical galactic nova rate @xmath70 yr@xmath13 , ( of which 2/3 are practically detectable , as assumed in  4.1 ) , and by the intercepted fraction , to imply that _ integral _ ought to detect 0.04 novae yr@xmath13 . unless theoretical estimates of the 511 kev line flux turn out to be considerably larger , the prospects for such a detection appear to be small .",
    "the same conclusion probably applies to a different method of detecting 511 kev line emission indirectly , by observing the 170470 kev continuum produced by compton scattering in the nova envelope using spi s large - area csi shield ( jean et al .",

    "<S> the good energy resolution ( 34 kev fwhm ) of the transient gamma ray spectrometer ( tgrs ) on board the _ wind _ spacecraft makes it sensitive to doppler - shifted outbursts of 511 kev electron - positron annihilation radiation , the reason being that the doppler shift causes the cosmic line to be slightly offset from a strong instrumental background 511 kev line at rest , which is ubiquitous in space environments . </S>",
    "<S> such a cosmic line ( blueshifted ) is predicted to arise in classical novae due to the annihilation of positrons from @xmath0-decay on a timescale of a few hours in an expanding envelope . a further advantage of tgrs  its broad field of view , containing the entire southern ecliptic hemisphere  has enabled us to make a virtually complete and unbiased 3year search for classical novae at distances up to @xmath1 kpc . </S>",
    "<S> we present negative results of this search , and estimate its implications for the highly - uncertain galactic classical nova rate and for future space missions . </S>"
