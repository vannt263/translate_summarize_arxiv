    "such @xmath0 symmetric structures were constructed straightforwardly by coupling a system with loss to a system with equal amount of gain .",

    "thus it is also interesting to note the dynamics of conservative @xmath0 symmetric structures in comparison with the dissipative ones .",
    "+    one of the most interesting and useful characteristics of classical @xmath0 symmetric systems is the non - reciprocal nature which helps to localize the energy in the gain component of the coupled systems @xcite .",
    "thus there occurs unidirectional propagation of light in the usual @xmath0 symmetric systems .",
    "but in the systems which we consider there are no loss or gain terms and thus we look at whether such non - reciprocal nature sustains in these type of @xmath0 symmetric systems as well . in other words",

    "the present article shows the criterion required for the existence of non - reciprocity in these @xmath0 symmetric systems is the existence of self - trapping nonlinearity .",

    "we show the spontaneous symmetry breaking through the pitchfork bifurcation in the reciprocal cases and the spontaneous symmetry breaking through a tangent like bifurcation in non - reciprocal cases admitting unidirectional transport of light . +    in order to focus on the above objectives , we present this manuscript in the following form . in sec .",

    "<S> in this article , we consider an interesting class of optical and other systems in which the interaction or coupling makes the systems to be @xmath0-symmetric . </S>",
    "<S> we aim to compare their dynamical behaviors with that of the usual @xmath0 symmetric systems with intrinsic loss - gain terms . in particular , we focus on the interesting non - reciprocal nature of the @xmath0 symmetric systems which has a promising application in optical diodes and optical isolators . </S>",
    "<S> we check whether the non - reciprocal nature is common to all @xmath0 symmetric systems and , if not , what are the situations under which it can be observed . due to the recent interest in studying spontaneous symmetry breaking in coupled waveguide systems , </S>",
    "<S> we here present such symmetry breaking bifurcations in certain reciprocal and non - reciprocal @xmath0 symmetric systems . </S>"
