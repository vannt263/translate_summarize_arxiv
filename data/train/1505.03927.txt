    "systems of @xmath0 atoms have attracted significant interest , both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "the main reason is a special feature of @xmath0 few - atom clusters , namely , an extremely weak binding of few - body ground states .",
    "this weakness of binding is responsible for the manifestation of phenomena such as the efimov physics or superfluidity ; see ref .",
    "@xcite for an overview .",
    "the understanding of these phenomena requires precise theoretical calculations of the properties of cold @xmath0 few - body systems ; up to now such calculations with realistic interaction models predominantly have been performed in various coordinate - space frameworks .",
    "three - atom bound ( trimer ) and scattering states have been calculated solving faddeev equations @xcite or using adiabatic hyperspherical approach @xcite , while tetramer properties have been obtained solving the faddeev - yakubovsky equations @xcite , using the variational gaussian expansion method @xcite or the hyperspherical monte - carlo approach @xcite .",
    "the latter was extended to more than four atoms and provided estimates for scattering lengths , whereas ref .",
    "@xcite produced results also for the atom - trimer scattering at finite energy .",
    "the dynamics of cold @xmath0 atoms is essentially governed by the local two - atom potential ; there exist a number of realistic parametrizations @xcite .",
    "main features of those realistic potentials are long attractive van der waals tail and a very strong repulsion at short distances",
    ". especially the latter causes difficulties in calculations of systems containing three or more @xmath0 atoms .",
    "indeed , even a special form of the differential three - particle faddeev equations with hard - core potentials has been developed and applied for the study of the three- @xcite and four - atom systems @xcite .",
    "another difficulty , encountered in the scattering calculations , is a slow convergence of the results with the employed grid size @xcite . to avoid these difficulties , simplified dynamic models based of short - range soft or separable potentials",
    "have been invented and used in coordinate- @xcite and momentum - space calculations @xcite ; despite their simplicity such models are quite reliable for the study of efimov physics .    given the success of momentum - space three - nucleon scattering calculations @xcite",
    ", one may raise the question whether the above difficulties in the description of atomic @xmath0 systems with realistic potentials can be resolved in the framework of momentum - space integral equations for the transition operators .",
    "therefore the goal of the present work is to study the @xmath0 trimer and three - atom scattering processes employing the momentum - space methods .",
    "since the @xmath0 triatomic system has already been investigated using several coordinate - space methods @xcite , in this work i will concentrate on demonstrating the reliability of momentum - space calculations with realistic potentials and providing highly accurate benchmark results .",
    "the considered observables are the trimer binding energy , atom - dimer scattering length , phase shifts , inelasticity parameters , inclusive cross sections as well as differential cross section for the atom - dimer breakup ; the latter is most difficult to obtain in the coordinate - space framework and , to the best of my knowledge , has not yet been calculated .    among the variety of realistic atomic @xmath0 potentials ,",
    "the one by aziz and slaman , called lm2m2 @xcite , is probably most widely used and therefore is an optimal choice for a benchmark calculation ; having van der waals tail and very strong short - range repulsion its behaviour is characteristic for all realistic @xmath0 potentials . the fact that lm2m2 does not include the retardation correction which may be quite significant @xcite is irrelevant for demonstrating the abilities of the method . as in most previous calculations",

    "in order to apply the momentum - space techniques to the three - body problem one has to formulate it in the integral representation . in this way",
    "the asymptotic boundary conditions are implicitly built into the form of equations but lead to kernels with integrable singularities .",
    "considering the three @xmath0 atoms as identical bosons it is most convenient to use the symmetrized form of faddeev equations in the alt - grassberger - sandhas ( ags ) version @xcite ; formally they coincide with the ones employed for the fermionic three - nucleon system @xcite .",
    "the only difference is in the properties of the basis states , namely , they must be symmetric under the exchange of particles within pair ( 12 ) which is chosen as a representative pair .",
    "the potential @xmath4 acting within this pair in the integral formulation is summed up into the respective two - particle transition matrix using the lippmann - schwinger equation @xmath5 with @xmath6 being the free green s function of the three - particle system with energy @xmath7 and kinetic energy operator @xmath8 .",

    "the ags equations are formulated for three - particle transition operator @xmath16 it contains the full information about the scattering process .",
    "the amplitude for the elastic scattering is obtained from the on - shell matrix element @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the atom - dimer channel state given by the product of the dimer wave function @xmath19 and plane wave with the relative atom - dimer momentum @xmath20 .",
    "the latter is related to the available energy @xmath7 as @xmath21 with @xmath22 being the dimer binding energy and @xmath23 the reduced mass .",
    "the breakup amplitudes @xmath24 , with @xmath25 and @xmath26 being the jacobi momenta of three free particles in the final state , are obtained as on - shell matrix elements of the breakup operator @xmath27 the above equations are solved in the momentum - space partial - wave basis @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are magnitudes of the jacobi momenta and @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) is the orbital angular momentum for the relative motion within the pair ( between the pair and spectator ) , coupled to the total angular momentum @xmath33 with the projection @xmath34 .",
    "the solution technique employs the same numerical methods as in the three - nucleon scattering calculations , i.e. , real - axis integration with subtraction and special weights , spline interpolation , and pad summation .",

    "given the two difficulties encountered in the coordinate - space calculations , the essential questions for the momentum - space calculations are : ( i ) to what extent the hard core region is important and causes difficulties ; ( ii ) at what distances the van der waals tail becomes irrelevant . in the latter case ,",
