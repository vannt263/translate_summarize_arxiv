    "the study of the class of extremely red objects ( eros ; @xmath16mag ; e.g. cimatti et al . 2002 ; roche et al .",
    "2002 , 2003 ) has gained significant impetus over the last few years with the realisation that they can provide valuable information on galaxy evolution and formation scenarios ( c.f .",

    "2000 ; roche et al . 2002",
    "; visnen & johansson 2004a , b ) . the very red colours of these objects suggest that they comprise evolved galaxies at redshifts @xmath11 , the progenitors of present - day ellipticals .",
    "study of the properties of such high-@xmath14 systems can indeed provide tight constraints on competing elliptical galaxy formation scenarios : monolithic collapse early in the universe ( @xmath17 ) followed by passive evolution ( e.g. eggen et al .",
    "1962 ; larson 1975 ) versus hierarchical merging and relatively recent formation epochs ( baugh et al . 1996 ; kauffmann 1996 ) .",
    "spectroscopic follow - up observations of either complete ero samples ( cimatti et al . 2002 ; cimatti et al .",
    "2003 ) or individual systems ( dunlop et al . 1996 ; spinrad et al . 1997 ; stanford et al .",
    "1997 ) have indeed confirmed that a large fraction of eros ( @xmath18 per cent ) have absorption - line spectra .",
    "in addition to early type galaxies however , these follow - up programs also showed that a significant fraction of high-@xmath14 dust - shrouded active galaxies ( starburst or agns ) are also present among eros ( cimatti et al .",
    "1998 ; dey et al . 1999 ; afonso et al . 2001 ; smith et al . 2001 ; brusa et al . 2002 ) .",
    "although the relative mix between early type and dusty systems remains poorly constrained , eros have strong spatial clustering which is comparable if not larger than that of present day luminous ellipticals ( daddi et al .",
    "2000 , 2001 , 2003 ; firth et al . 2002 ; roche et al .",
    "2002 , 2003 ) .",
    "this may be interpreted as evidence that the populations of distant eros and nearby ellipticals may be evolutionary linked .",
    "study of the clustering of eros , usually quantified via the 2-d correlation function , can indeed provide valuable information on the nature of these systems , their formation and evolution history as well as their environment ( e.g. daddi et al .",
    "2001 ; roche et al .",
    "2002 , 2003 ) .",
    "comparison of the clustering properties of eros with those of local e / s0 may provide important insights into the evolution of early - type galaxies out to @xmath11 .    in this paper",
    "we explore the clustering properties and the environment of eros detected in a @xmath19 deep ( @xmath2mag ) @xmath3-band survey carried out as part of the phoenix deep survey ( hopkins et al .",
    "2003 ) , a large multiwavelength program aiming to investigate the nature and the evolution of faint ( sub - mjy and @xmath20jy ) radio sources .",
    "compared to previous studies of the clustering of eros , the present sample has the advantage of depth combined with wider area providing a large sample of eros to @xmath2mag .",
    "this is essential to increase the sample size and to improve the statistical reliability of the results compared to previous studies at similar depths ( e.g. roche et al .",
    "2002 , 2003 ) .",
    "we caution the reader however , that although our survey is larger than previous samples at comparable magnitude limits , cosmic variance is an issue and may affect our correlation amplitude measurements .",
    "much larger , degree scale , @xmath10-band surveys are required to address this issue ( e.g. noao deep wide survey ; brown et al .",
    "our contiguous @xmath3-band survey also allows study of the association of eros with regions of enhanced galaxy density .",
    "indeed , although eros are believed to reside in dense regions there is still no direct link between eros and galaxy overdensities .",
    "the overlap of our sample with the ultra - deep and homogeneous radio observations of the phoenix deep survey provides a unique opportunity to investigate the association of the radio and the ero populations and how they trace the underlying mass distribution .",

    "the radio observations were carried out at the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) at 1.4ghz during several campaigns between 1994 and 2001 , covering a 4.56 square degree area centered at ra(j2000)=@xmath26 dec.(j2000)=@xmath27 .",

    "( 1998 , 1999 , 2003 ) .",
    "the observational strategy adopted resulted in a radio map that is homogeneous within the central @xmath28 radius , with the @xmath29 rms noise increasing from @xmath30 in the most sensitive region to about @xmath31 close to the edge of the @xmath32 field .",
    "the radio source catalogue consists of a total of 2148 radio sources to a limit of 60@xmath33jy ( hopkins et al .",

    "the completeness limit is estimated to be @xmath2mag for the full mosaic and @xmath36mag for the deeper central subregion .",

    "( @xmath38-bands ) and the mosaic - ii camera on the ctio-4 m telescope on 2002 september 3 ( @xmath39-band ) , fully overlapping the sofi @xmath3-band survey .",
    "full details on the data reduction , calibration and source detection are again presented in sullivan et al .",
    "( 2004 ) . in this study",
    "we will use the @xmath40-band observations these being the deepest ( @xmath41mag ; see next section ) and most appropriate for identifying eros .",
    "the @xmath3-band selected catalogue was constructed using sextractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) .",
    "sources were detected on the @xmath3-band image and their photometric properties were then measured from the seeing matched @xmath3 and the @xmath40-band frames ( see sullivan et al .",
    "2004 for details ) . to facilitate comparison with previous studies ,",
    "the estimated magnitudes are calibrated to the standard vega based magnitude system .",
    "the star - galaxy separation was performed using the class_star flag of sextractor ( class_star@xmath42 ) which is reliable to @xmath43 .",
    "the pds is selected to lie at high galactic latitude and therefore any contamination by stars at fainter magnitudes is expected to be small .",
    "the @xmath3-galaxy number counts from these observations are plotted in figure [ fig_kcounts ] showing that the turnover magnitude lies at @xmath2mag .",
    "sullivan et al . (",
    "2004 ) estimate moderate incompleteness of about 2030 per cent in the magnitude range @xmath44mag . in section [ cor_fun ]",
    "we argue that this small level of incompleteness is unlikely to alter our main conclusions .",
    "the central deep pointing of our @xmath3-band survey has a turnover magnitude of @xmath36 . in this paper",
    "however , we consider sources brighter than @xmath4mag the approximate completeness limit of the entire catalogue .    eros are selected to have @xmath45mag with the @xmath40 and @xmath3-band magnitudes measured in kron ( 1980)-like elliptical apertures ( magauto parameter of sextractor ) .",
    "we note that the @xmath46 detection threshold for the @xmath40-band catalogue is 24.2mag , sufficiently deep to identify eros with @xmath4mag .",
    "we find a total of 289 eros to this magnitude limit within the @xmath34 area of our survey .",
    "figure [ dnds_eros ] compares the differential counts of our eros with previous studies , suggesting that our sample is complete to @xmath2mag .",
    "a total of 95 radio sources brighter than @xmath12jy overlap with the @xmath3-band survey region . using a matching radius of 3arcsec",
    "we find that 17 of them with fluxes in the range @xmath47 are associated with eros .",
    "the properties of these sources will be presented in a future paper ( afonso et al .",
    "2004 , in preparation ) and are not considered in the analysis that follows .",
    "we also attempt to estimate the mean radio properties of eros using the stacking analysis method described by hopkins et al .",
    "in brief we extract sub - images from the radio mosaic at the location of the non radio detected eros , and construct the weighted average of the sub - images ( weighted by 1/rms@xmath48 , to maximise the resulting signal - to - noise , since the radio mosaic has a varying noise level over the image ) .",
    "sub - images where low s / n emission ( @xmath49 ) is present at the location of the non - detected source are excluded from the stacking , in order to avoid biasing the stacking signal result by the presence of a small number of low s / n sources .",
    "the stacked image has an rms noise of @xmath50jy , and a @xmath51 detection at @xmath52jy .",
    "while the actual redshift distribution of eros remains poorly constrained , they are believed to lie at @xmath53 ( e.g. cimatti et al .",
    "2002 ; cimatti et al . 2003 ) . assuming that the average redshift of these sources is @xmath54 , the inferred average ero 1.4ghz luminosity is @xmath55 .",
    "for the luminosity estimate we use a k - correction assuming a power law spectral energy distribution of the form @xmath56 with @xmath57 .",
    "the luminosity above corresponds to an average star formation rate ( assuming the eros are all star - forming systems ) of @xmath58 , adopting the recent calibration of bell ( 2003 ) .",
    "clearly these results rely on a large number of assumptions , but they serve the useful purpose of providing a preliminary estimate for the average radio properties of these systems .",
    "the two - point angular correlation function , @xmath59 , is defined as the joint probability @xmath60 of finding sources within the solid angle elements @xmath61 and @xmath62 , separated by an angle  @xmath8 , in the form    @xmath63    where @xmath64 is the mean surface density of galaxies . for a random distribution of sources @xmath59=0 .",
    "therefore , the angular correlation function provides a measure of galaxy density excess over that expected for a random distribution .",
    "various methods for estimating @xmath59 have been introduced , as discussed by infante ( 1994 ) . in the present study ,",
    "a source is taken as the ` centre ' and the number of pairs within annular rings is counted . to account for the edge effects , monte",
    "carlo techniques are used by placing random points within the area of the survey .",
    "we use the @xmath59 estimator introduced by landy & szalay ( 1993 )    @xmath65    where dd and dr are respectively the number of sources and random points at separations @xmath8 and @xmath66 from a given galaxy .",
    "similarly , rr is the number of random points within the angular interval @xmath8 to @xmath66 from a given random point .    for a given ero sample ,",
    "a total of 100 random catalogues are generated , each having the same number of points as the original data set .",
    "the random sets were cross - correlated with the galaxy catalogue , giving an average value for @xmath59 at each angular separation .",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath67(@xmath8 ) is determined from the relation    @xmath68    finally , before fitting a power law to @xmath59 , we take into account a bias arising from the finite boundary of the sample . since the angular correlation function is calculated within a region of solid angle @xmath69 , the background projected density of sources , at a given magnitude limit ,",
    "is effectively @xmath70 ( where @xmath71 is the number of sources brighter than the limiting magnitude ) .",
    "however , this is an overestimation of the true underlying mean surface density , because of the positive correlation between galaxies in small separations , balanced by negative values of @xmath59 at larger separations .",
    "this bias , known as the integral constraint , has the effect of reducing the amplitude of the correlation function by    @xmath72    where @xmath69 is the solid angle of the survey area . following roche et al .",
    "( 2002 ) we estimate @xmath73 numerically using the random - random correlation    @xmath74    where we assume that @xmath59 is a power - law of the form @xmath75 . the sum in equation [ eq_9 ] is from 1arsec to 15arcmin . adopting @xmath76 we find @xmath77 .",
    "having fixed the exponent @xmath78 to 0.8 the amplitude @xmath79 is obtained by fitting the function @xmath80 to the observed @xmath59 using standard @xmath81 minimisation procedures weighting each point with its error .",
    "we estimate the @xmath59 and determine the amplitude @xmath79 for different @xmath3-band magnitude limited ero subsamples .",
    "the results are summarised in table [ tab_1 ] .",
    "the estimated correlation function is plotted in figure [ fig_corfun ] . for the @xmath82 and @xmath83mag sub - samples",
    "the correlation function signal is significant at the @xmath13 level with @xmath84 and @xmath85 respectively . for the sub - sample with @xmath86mag",
    "the detected signal is significant at the @xmath87 confidence level ( @xmath88 ) .",
    "the amplitudes estimated above must be corrected for contamination of the galaxy sample by stars at faint magnitudes ( @xmath89mag ) .",
    "the presence of an uncorrelated population of uniformly distributed stars within the galaxy catalogue , reduces @xmath90 by the factor    @xmath91    where @xmath92 is the number of objects ( both stars and galaxies ) used to calculate @xmath59 and @xmath71 is the number of stars in the catalogue . in the present study , stars were identified and removed to @xmath93mag ( section 2.2 ) . at fainter magnitudes , the milky way stellar population synthesis model described by robin et al .",
    "( 2003 , 2004 ) was employed to predict the expected number of stars within our ero sample at different @xmath3-band magnitude limits .",
    "the correction factors estimated from equation [ eq_3.19 ] are also listed table [ tab_1 ] along with the corrected amplitudes , @xmath94 . the @xmath94 ( with @xmath8 measured in degrees )",
    "are consistent with previous studies at similar magnitude limits ( e.g. daddi et al .",
    "2001 ; roche et al .",
    "2002 , 2003 ) .",
    "this is demonstrated in figure [ fig_aw ] plotting the @xmath94 for eros as a function of the limiting @xmath3-band magnitude .",
    "compared to previous ero surveys to @xmath4mag our sample has the advantage of larger size and hence more statistically reliable results .",
    "cosmic variance however , is likely to be an issue for surveys with areal extent similar to our own .",
    "daddi et al .",
    "( 2001 ) estimated that the relative dispersion on the amplitude of the angular correlation function due to this effect is @xmath95 , where @xmath73 is the integral constraint defined in equation [ eq_8 ] . for our survey geometry using this relation we estimate an uncertainty to the amplitudes listed in table [ tab_1 ] due to cosmic variance of @xmath96 .",
    "we note however , that this result is likely to be a lower limit since it does not take into account the higher order moments of the galaxy distribution .",
    "for example barger et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and mccracker et al .",
    "( 2000 ) find a factor of three difference in the surface density of eros to @xmath97mag in their independent small area surveys ( @xmath98 ) .",
    "although our sample has 3 times larger field of view the result above illustrates the effect of cosmic variance to relatively small area surveys .",
    "much larger , degree scale , @xmath10-band samples will be able to address this issue ( e.g. noao deep wide survey ; brown et al .",
    "n - body simulations can also be used in principle to provide a realistic estimate of the cosmic variance effect ( e.g. somerville et al . 2004 ) .",
    "this calculation however , requires a number of assumptions on the redshift distribution and clustering properties of eros and is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we also attempt to quantify the effect of the @xmath3-band catalogue incompleteness at faint magnitudes ( 20 - 30% in the range 19.6 - 20mag ) to the estimated @xmath59 of eros .",
    "we need a sample that does not suffer from incompleteness in the above magnitude range to create mock catalogues by randomly removing 20 - 30% of the sources at faint magnitudes .",
    "the angular correlation function for each mock catalogue is then estimated to quantify the bias introduced by the @xmath3-band catalogue incompleteness .",
    "the above prescription could have been applied to the central @xmath99 subregion of our survey which is deeper in the @xmath3-band ( @xmath36mag ) and thus does not suffer from incompleteness in the 19.6 - 20mag range . however , only about 30 eros lie in this subregion and therefore the small number statistics do not allow us to use this sample .",
    "nevertheless , we apply the above method to the @xmath100mag subsample ( total of 177 sources , see table [ tab_1 ] ) by randomly removing 20 - 30% of the sources in the range 19.0 - 19.5mag .",
    "a total of 500 mock catalogues are created and the amplitude of the angular correlation function of each one of them is estimated . within the @xmath29 uncertainties we find no difference between the mean @xmath79 from the 500 mock realisations and that quoted in table [ tab_1 ] .",
    "extrapolating the above result to the @xmath86mag we argue that the estimated amplitude is not going to be significantly affected by incompleteness at faint magnitudes .",
    "we caution the reader however , that the above conclusion holds only if the missed objects have the same clustering properties as the detected sources .",
    "the agreement between the angular correlation amplitudes estimated here and those found in previous studies also implies an agreement on the spatial correlation length @xmath101 assuming a similar redshift distribution , which is not unreasonable given the similarity of the sample selection .",

    "( 2002 , 2003 ) to deproject the ero angular correlation amplitudes and to determine their spatial correlation length , @xmath101 , yields @xmath102 .",
    "the range in @xmath101 depends on the adopted luminosity function and clustering evolution model . as discussed above the uncertainty in @xmath101 due to cosmic variance",
    "is estimated to be at least @xmath96 .",
    "we also caution the reader that the relatively small extent of our survey may result in systematic underestimation of the derived correlation length .",

    "2001 ) estimate this effect to be @xmath103 .    . clustering amplitudes of the @xmath104 eros at different magnitude limits .",
    "the @xmath79 is estimated at 1degree and is _ not _ corrected for dilution due to stellar contamination of the ero sample at faint magnitudes .",

    "the last column gives the clustering amplitudes , @xmath105 , corrected for stellar contamination [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "in this section we study the environment of eros to explore their association with regions of enhanced density at relatively high redshifts ( @xmath106 ) .",
    "we quantify this by cross - correlating the positions of our ero sample with the smoothed @xmath3-band galaxy density map produced using the matched filter algorithm described by postman et al .",

    "the matched filter algorithm was developed by postman et al .",
    "( 1996 ) to identify galaxy overdensities using photometric data only .",
    "it has the advantage that it exploits both positional and photometric information producing galaxy density maps where spurious galaxy fluctuations are suppressed .",
    "a drawback of the matched filter method is that one must assume a form for the cluster luminosity function and its radial profile .",
    "clusters with the same richness but different intrinsic shape or different luminosity function from the adopted ones do not have the same likelihood of being detected .",

    "the survey area is binned into pixels @xmath122 of fixed size ( for the choice of values see below ) and the observed galaxy distribution is convolved with the filters above producing a likelihood map according to the relation    @xmath123    where @xmath124 is the total number of galaxies in the catalogue . the sum above is evaluated for every pixel of the density map .",

    "we produce a total of 100 mock catalogues by randomly selecting galaxies from the full @xmath3-band source list with @xmath152 ( i.e. not eros ) and magnitude distribution similar to that of our @xmath86mag ero sample .",
    "each of these mock catalogues are cross - correlated with the @xmath3-band density maps providing , at different redshifts , an estimate of the mean cross - correlation function and its rms for each separation .",
    "this is then compared against the signal for eros . for the @xmath150 and @xmath153 maps",
    "we find that the ero signal is higher than that of non - ero galaxies , on average , at the @xmath154 and @xmath155 confidence level respectively . for lower redshifts",

    "together this all provides direct evidence that eros are associated with regions of enhanced density at @xmath11 .",
    "radio galaxies are another class of sources that are believed to be good cluster tracers to high-@xmath14 ( e.g. zirbel 1997 ; zanichelli et al . 2001 ) .",
    "we exploit the deep 1.4ghz radio observations available for our @xmath3-band survey to explore the association of eros with radio sources and whether they trace similar structures .",
    "these are quantified using the two - point cross - correlation function @xmath156 between radio sources and eros .",
    "the cross - correlation function is estimated taking radio sources as centres and counting the number of eros around them in successive annuli .",
    "this is then compared with the expectation for a random distribution by placing a total of 40000 random points in the surveyed area and counting the number of pairs between radio sources and the random points .",
    "the cross - correlation function is defined    @xmath157    where @xmath158 , @xmath159 is the number of radio / ero and radio / random pairs respectively with separation @xmath8 and @xmath160 , @xmath161 is the total number of random points and eros respectively .",
    "as already discussed , in the cross - correlation we have excluded a total of 17 radio sources that are associated with eros .",
    "the results for the remaining 78 radio sources in our sample are plotted in the bottom panel of figure [ fig_corfun_radio_eros ] with the errors being poisson estimates .",
    "there is little signal with the estimated @xmath156 consistent with zero .",
    "this suggests that the bulk of the eros and the radio source populations are probing different structures .",
    "we further explore this by grouping the radio sources into high and low-@xmath14 sub - samples using the photometric redshift estimates presented by sullivan et al .",
    "the low-@xmath14 sub - sample comprises 35 sources with @xmath162 while , the high-@xmath14 sub - sample includes a total of 43 sources both without optical counterparts to the limit @xmath163mag ( assumed to lie at high redshifts ) and with @xmath164 .",
    "the cross - correlation results using the above sub - samples are plotted in the middle ( low-@xmath14 ) and top panels ( high-@xmath14 ) of figure [ fig_corfun_radio_eros ] .",
    "although there is no signal in the case of the low-@xmath14 radio sources , the high-@xmath14 sub - sample shows signal for separations 730arcsec , albeit at the @xmath165 significance level ( @xmath166 ) .",
    "although the statistics are poor the evidence above suggests that the different redshift distributions of the radio and ero populations are responsible for the lack of cross - correlation signal in the bottom panel of figure [ fig_corfun_radio_eros ] .",

    "this is also supported by the cross - correlation of the full radio sample with the @xmath3-band density maps produced in section [ mfa ] .",
    "the cross - correlation is performed using the method outlined in section [ mfa_res ] .",
    "the expectation in the case of a random distribution of points is quantified by producing 100 mock radio catalogues by randomising the positions of the radio sources .",
    "each of these random catalogues is cross - correlated with the @xmath3-band density maps providing , for a given separation @xmath8 , an estimate of the cross - correlation function expected in the case of a random distribution of galaxies ( i.e. without clustering ) .",

    "the significance in this figure is expressed in units of standard deviations , @xmath148 . in figure [ fig_cross_sign_radio ]",
    "the significance of the cross - correlation signal decreases with redshift falling below the @xmath146 when the cross - correlation is performed with density maps generated for redshifts @xmath168 .",
    "adopting a passively evolving @xmath132 for the luminosity function ( see section [ mfa ] ) does not qualitatively change our results but only shifts to higher-@xmath14 the point that the significance of the cross - correlation signal falls below @xmath146 .",
    "this is demonstrated in the insert plot of figure [ fig_cross_sign_radio ] .",
    "the trend for radio sources in figure [ fig_cross_sign_radio ] is opposite to that for eros in figure [ fig_cross_sign ] suggesting that the bulk of the radio and the ero populations are tracing structures at different redshifts .",
    "in this paper we explore the clustering properties of @xmath86mag eros ( @xmath0mag ) using a @xmath3-band sample covering @xmath169 and overlapping with the pds region .",
    "we use angular correlation function analysis to estimate a statistically significant clustering signal ( @xmath170 ) with amplitude consistent , within the errors , with previous studies ( roche et al .",
    "2002 , 2003 ; daddi et al .",
    "the advantage of our study is that our sample size is larger than previous surveys to @xmath4mag ( e.g. roche et al .",

    "nevertheless , cosmic variance remains an issue in our survey .",
    "the @xmath59 amplitudes estimated here are consistent with 3-d clustering lengths @xmath171 depending on the adopted model luminosity function and the evolution of the clustering ( daddi et al .",
    "2001 ; roche et al .",

    "daddi et al .",
    "( 2002 ) also discuss evidence that eros with optical / nir colours suggesting old stellar population are significantly more clustered than those showing evidence for dusty starbursts .",

    "( 2003 ) estimated the correlation length of @xmath172 red ( @xmath173 ) galaxies in the noao deep wide field survey and found that systems with @xmath174 have higher clustering lengths ( @xmath175 ) than @xmath176 galaxies ( @xmath177 ) .",
    "similar results are obtained for the early type galaxies in the 2df galaxy redshit survey ( norberg et al .",
    "the eros identified in our sample comprise systems with @xmath178 .",
    "for example at @xmath137 and 1.5 the magnitude limit @xmath4mag corresponds to about @xmath179 and @xmath180 respectively , assuming a passively evolving elliptical galaxy model .",
    "the large clustering lengths of @xmath2mag eros ( @xmath181 ) are therefore difficult to reconcile with the above @xmath101 estimates for @xmath178 early type galaxies at @xmath172",
    ". this may be due to uncertainties in the model redshift distribution of eros used to deproject the angular correlation function amplitudes .",
    "combination of photometric and spectroscopic redshifts for complete ero samples are essential to refine these models and to better understand the clustering properties of this population .",
    "the evidence above on the large correlation length of eros may suggest these sources are tracing high density regions .",
    "we further explore the association of eros with galaxy overdensities using a novel method : we first smooth the @xmath3-band galaxy distribution using the matched filter algorithm of postman et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and then cross - correlate the resulting density maps with the ero positions .",
    "the matched filter algorithm parameters are tuned to produce density maps each one of which is sensitive to galaxy clusters at a different redshift in the range 0.51.2 .",
    "we find a statistically significant cross - correlation signal ( @xmath182 compared to the random distribution ) only for density maps tuned to @xmath11 clusters . at these redshifts ,",
    "eros also have higher cross - correlation signal , albeit at the @xmath183 confidence level , than the non - ero @xmath3-band selected galaxies with the same magnitude distribution .",
    "this provides direct evidence that eros are , on average , associated with regions of enhanced galaxy density at redshifts @xmath11 .",

    "the red @xmath184 colours of these systems can only be explained by either early type galaxies or dusty starbursts at @xmath53 ( e.g. pozzetti & mannucci 2000 ; visnene & johansson 2004a ; roche et al .",
