    "cognitive radio communication has emerged as a new paradigm to tackle down the problem of inefficient use of the spectrum , which arises mainly due to rigid rules allowing only the licensed users to have exclusive access to certain frequency bands . in order to bring flexibility to the spectrum usage ,",
    "three different strategies , namely underlay , overlay , and interweave operations of cognitive radio systems have been proposed ( see e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) . in underlay cognitive radio networks , secondary users are allowed to coexist with the primary users as long as they satisfy strict constraints on the interference inflicted on the primary users . on the other hand , in interweave cognitive radio networks ,",
    "secondary users initially perform channel sensing and then opportunistically access the spectrum holes .",
    "these two spectrum access techniques can be combined for improved performance @xcite .",
    "for instance , secondary users can sense the activities of the primary users in order to transmit with full power over idle - sensed channels and also communicate over a busy - sensed channel while keeping the interference inflicted on the primary users within tolerable limits .",
    "due to their significance , channel sensing algorithms and spectrum access policies have recently been extensively studied ( see e.g. , @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) and a considerable number of challenges and design issues from the perspectives of cognitive secondary and/or primary users were addressed .",
    "several sensing methods , such as matched filtering , cyclo - stationary feature detection , and energy detection were investigated , cooperation among secondary users was considered ( @xcite-@xcite ) . additionally , wideband channel sensing algorithms were studied .",
    "for instance , the authors introduced novel wideband spectrum sensing techniques in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the authors in @xcite studied the transmission collision between the primary and secondary users , and they optimized the transmission time of the secondary users between consecutive sensing phases to maximize the their throughput .",
    "finally , in @xcite the authors analyzed the limits of channel sensing methods by analyzing the snr - wall below which sensing performance will not improve further .",
    "as another challenge for cognitive radios , wireless transmission medium is subject to variations over time due to mobility and/or changing environment .",
    "most practical wireless systems attempt to learn the channel conditions , and due to this , different channel estimation methods and their performances have been investigated in detail in the literature . transmitting known pilot symbols",
    "is generally used as a method to obtain channel state information @xcite .",
    "for instance , the authors in @xcite focused on pilot symbol assisted modulation approach for transceiver design for time - varying channels , and proposed causal and non - causal estimation algorithms , and compared different algorithms by maximizing the mutual information between input and output over the spacing of pilot symbols .",
    "further results and characterizations on pilot - symbol assisted wireless communications can be found , for instance , in @xcite@xcite .",
    "several recent studies have addressed the channel estimation problem in cognitive radio systems as well and focused on pilot allocation strategies .",
    "for instance , by minimizing the mean - squared error ( mse ) of the least - squares channel estimation method , a practical pilot design method for ofdm - based cognitive radios was proposed in @xcite .",
    "the relationship between the optimal pilot pattern and the power loading was investigated in @xcite under the constraint that primary users did not experience interference above a certain threshold . however , in these studies , channel sensing errors have not been considered .    in a practical cognitive radio",
    "setting , channel sensing errors are experienced due to false - alarms and miss - detections , and this sensing uncertainty can have an impact on the design of channel estimation algorithms and pilot placement policies . additionally , it is of interest to identify how channel sensing errors affect the quality of channel estimation . on the other hand , despite the practical significance of these considerations , there has only been limited work focusing on the joint treatment of channel sensing and estimation . in @xcite , gao _",
    "et al . _ addressed channel training and estimation in a multiple - antenna cognitive radio setting . in their model",
    ", cognitive users initially listen to the primary users transmission in order to learn the structure of the covariance matrices of the received signals and perform receive and transmit beamforming in their own transmissions . following this learning phase ,",
    "the cognitive users enter into a training phase in which pilot signals are sent and the linear minimum mean - square - error ( lmmse ) estimation is performed . in @xcite , we studied the interactions between channel sensing and estimation . more specifically , we investigated the structure and performance of different channel estimation schemes in the presence of sensing uncertainty .    while channel sensing and estimation are critical tasks in a practical setting , the ultimate goal of cognitive users is to perform data transmission and reception . with that , capacity and throughput of cognitive radio systems",
    "have been investigated in numerous studies .",
    "for example , assuming that the channel between the secondary transmitter and the primary receiver is known by the secondary users , the authors in @xcite investigated the capacity gains offered to the secondary users by opportunistically sharing the spectrum when the communication channels vary due to fading .",
    "liang @xmath0 in @xcite studied the problem of optimizing the channel sensing duration to maximize the achievable throughput for the secondary network under the constraint that the primary users are sufficiently protected .",
    "furthermore , under transmit power constraints and also interference power constraints for primary user protection , optimal power allocation strategies for the secondary users were derived in @xcite .",
    "more recently , the authors in @xcite focused on the average achievable throughput and spectrum sensing capabilities compared to the conventional opportunistic spectrum access cognitive radio systems .",
    "we note that in the above - mentioned studies , the authors worked on cognitive radio models in which the secondary users have complete channel side information ( csi ) between the secondary receiver and the secondary transmitter , and the secondary transmitter and the primary receiver , and did not consider imperfectly known channel conditions . in @xcite",
    " @xcite , the authors addressed the impact of imperfect channel knowledge on the capacity of cognitive radio channels in underlay scenarios under interference power limitations . in these studies ,",
    "imperfect channel knowledge was regarding the channel conditions in the links between the secondary and primary users rather than the link between the secondary users .",
    "moreover , since underlay schemes were considered , channel sensing was not addressed , and explicit channel estimation methods and the interplay between channel sensing and channel estimation were generally not investigated .    in this paper , we consider a cognitive radio model in which the secondary users communicate over randomly - varying fading channels with memory in the presence of channel sensing uncertainty and with imperfect channel knowledge . throughout the paper ,",
    "we assume that only statistical knowledge is available a priori , regarding the channel conditions , noise , primary user activity , and primary users received signals . in this",
    "setting , secondary users initially sense the channel using a quadratic detector , and then perform the estimation of their own channel conditions in a correlated fading environment , and finally establish communication with imperfect sensing and estimation results . in both channel estimation and data",
    "transmission , secondary users select their power levels depending on the sensing results .",
    "for instance , if the channel is sensed as busy , they can operate with lower power than they would otherwise or cease transmission altogether in order to protect the primary users . under these assumptions ,",
    "our key contributions in this paper can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "we unveil the relationship between imperfect channel sensing and imperfect channel estimation in a fading channel with memory .",
    "therefore , unlike in @xcite in which the estimation of a single fading coefficient is considered , we address the estimation of a block of correlated fading coefficients .",
    "we concentrate on two different estimation methods , mmse and l - mmse , and obtain analytical expressions for the channel estimates and mean - squared error ( mse ) values .",
    "we identify the impact of channel sensing uncertainty on the channel estimator structure and channel estimation quality .",
    "we characterize the achievable rates when linear modulation schemes or gaussian input signaling are employed at the secondary transmitter with imperfect csi at the secondary receiver obtained through channel estimation .",
    "we determine efficient energy allocation strategies among data symbols and channel training symbols , and efficient training period values via numerical analysis .",
    "the organization of the rest of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : channel_model_sensing ] , we introduce the cognitive radio channel with channel sensing imperfections . in section [ pilot_symbol_modulation ] ,",
    "we discuss different causal channel estimation techniques , and provide expressions for the channel estimates and mse values . in section [ achievable_rates ] ,",
    "we determine the rates achieved with linear modulation schemes and gaussian signaling , and address the achievable - rate - maximizing energy allocation among data and pilot symbols , and also of pilot symbol period .",
    "we present the numerical results in section [ numerical_results ] and conclude in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "in this section , we describe a cognitive radio model in which a secondary transmitter and a secondary receiver communicate over a time - selective correlated rayleigh flat fading channel in the presence of primary users as seen in figure [ fig : res1_ek ] .",
    "first , the secondary users enter the channel sensing phase and sense the activities of the primary users in the channel in the first @xmath1 seconds of the frame duration of @xmath2 seconds .",
    "based on the sensing results , the power level for the transmission phase is selected . following channel sensing",
    ", the secondary transmitter sends the pilot and data symbols in @xmath3 blocks of @xmath4 seconds .",
    "this transmission frame structure is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : res1 ] .",
    "more specifically , in each block of @xmath4 seconds , the secondary transmitter initially sends a pilot symbol to enable channel estimation at the secondary receiver and subsequently transmits the data .",
    "this procedure is repeated @xmath3 times until the next channel sensing phase . note that sensing is performed with a period of @xmath2 seconds and , from the above description , we have @xmath5 .",
    "we further assume that the bandwidth available in the system is @xmath6 and symbol rate is @xmath6 complex symbols per second .",
    "meanwhile , the discrete - time channel input - output relation in the @xmath7 symbol period is given by @xmath8 if the primary users are active in the channel .",
    "on the other hand , if there are no active primary users in the channel , we have @xmath9 in the above equations , @xmath10 is the complex - valued channel input and @xmath11 is the complex - valued channel output .",
    "@xmath12 is assumed to be a sequence of independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "zero mean gaussian random variables with variance @xmath13 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath14 denotes the channel fading coefficient between the secondary transmitter and the secondary receiver , and @xmath15 is assumed to be a zero - mean gaussian random process with an auto - correlation function @xmath16 and variance @xmath17 . while both the secondary transmitter and the secondary receiver know the channel statistics , neither has the prior knowledge of the instantaneous realizations of @xmath15 .",
    "finally , in ( [ input - out1 ] ) , @xmath18 represents the sum of the active primary users _ faded _ signals arriving at the secondary receiver represents sum of the primary users signals multiplied with the fading coefficients . ] .",
    "we assume that transmissions are subject to average power constraints .",
    "in particular , average transmission power in each transmission block of @xmath4 seconds is @xmath19 when the channel is sensed as idle , and @xmath20 when the channel is sensed as busy .",
    "hence , the average transmission energy in each block is @xmath21 or @xmath22 depending on the sensed primary user activity . note",
    "that we consider a general scenario in which the secondary users can coexist with the active primary users as long as their transmissions do not result in excessive interference on the primary users .",
    "however , if secondary users are not allowed to transmit in a busy - sensed channel , we can set @xmath23 .",
    "hence , the consideration of this two - level transmission power policy gives flexibility and enables better control of the interference inflicted on the primary users .",
    "for instance , the power levels @xmath19 and @xmath20 can be dictated by average interference power constraints where @xmath24 is the detection probability in channel sensing .",
    "this is due to the fact that interference is proportional to @xmath20 with probability @xmath24 when primary user activity is correctly detected , and is proportional to @xmath19 with probability @xmath25 when primary user activity is missed .",
    "hence , @xmath19 and @xmath20 can be selected so that @xmath26 does not exceed a certain threshold and average interference power remains within tolerable limits . ] .",
    "finally , we consider a practical scenario in which errors such as miss - detections and false alarms may occur in channel sensing .",
    "we denote the correct - detection probability of the active primary users by @xmath24 , and the false - alarm probability by @xmath27 .",
    "in the training phase , periodically inserted pilot symbols , known by both the secondary transmitter and the secondary receiver , are used to estimate the channel fading coefficients .",
    "we assume a simple scenario in which the first symbol of each block of @xmath28 symbols is transmitted as a pilot symbol every @xmath4 seconds as seen in fig . [",
    "fig : res1 ] ( i.e. , at time indices @xmath29 , @xmath30 ) , and the secondary receiver estimates the channel fading coefficients . as described in the channel model , transmission power / energy is assumed to depend on the sensing decision .",
    "a similar two - level transmission energy is also considered in the training phase .",
    "more specifically , the energy of the pilot symbol is @xmath31 when the channel is sensed as idle , and is @xmath32 when the channel is sensed as busy .",
    "such a scheme of transmitting at two different energy levels , depending on the sensing results , enables the secondary users to better control the interference inflicted on the primary users .",
    "for instance , in order to protect the primary users , interference constraints can be imposed , and the transmission energy / power levels can be determined under such constraints .",
    "further details on interference limitations can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we examine two different channel estimation methods : mmse and l - mmse .",
    "one pilot symbol , transmitted at the beginning of each block of @xmath28 symbols , is used to estimate the channel fading coefficient at the moment the pilot symbol is transmitted and also the following @xmath33 channel fading coefficients . in other words , the secondary receiver utilizes the past pilot symbol and the correlation structure of the fading to obtain information about the current channel fading coefficient . for the sake of notational simplicity",
    ", we henceforth denote @xmath28 by @xmath34 , i.e. , @xmath35 .",
    "we further note that in order for clarity in notation we also assume that the first transmitted symbol after channel sensing , i.e. , the first pilot symbol , is transmitted at time 0 .",
    "the input - output relation in the training phase is given as @xmath36}_{y_{l } } = \\underbrace{\\begin{pmatrix }      0 & 0 & \\cdots & 0 & 0 & \\sqrt{\\mathcal{e}_{t , i } } & 0 & \\cdots & 0\\\\      0 & 0 & \\cdots & 0 & \\sqrt{\\mathcal{e}_{t , i } } & 0 & 0 & \\cdots & 0\\\\      \\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots & \\cdots & \\vdots\\\\          0 & \\sqrt{\\mathcal{e}_{t , i } } & \\cdots & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \\cdots & 0\\\\          \\sqrt{\\mathcal{e}_{t , i } } & 0 & \\cdots & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \\cdots & 0    \\end{pmatrix}}_{{\\mathbf{q}}_{l , t , i}}\\underbrace{\\left [              \\begin{array}{c }                              r_{(l - k+1)m}\\\\                              r_{(l - k+2)m}\\\\                              \\vdots\\\\                r_{lm } \\\\                              r_{lm+1}\\\\                \\vdots \\\\                r_{(l+1)m-1 } \\\\",

    "moreover , @xmath40 denotes the vector of @xmath41 fading coefficients to be estimated in the @xmath42 data transmission block and the last @xmath43 pilot symbols transmitted before the data symbols to be sent in the @xmath42 block , and we define @xmath44 as the pilot matrix to be used in channel estimation .",
    "here , we assume that the secondary receiver uses the last @xmath43 transmitted pilot symbols .",
    "however , it could be also designed in such a way that the secondary receiver uses all the pilot symbols transmitted after channel sensing .",
    "hence , we further note that the pilot symbol transmitted at time @xmath45 is the first pilot symbol transmitted after channel sensing if all pilot symbols transmitted after channel sensing are utilized is a not fixed value for every @xmath46 .",
    "for instance , when @xmath47 , @xmath48 , or when @xmath49 , @xmath50 . ] .",
    "in other words , the channel estimation method uses the strategy of accumulating past pilot symbol data in order to obtain channel side information regarding the fading coefficients following the last transmitted pilot symbol .",
    "since the channel fading coefficients are correlated and this correlation structure is available at the receiver , the receiver incorporates all available transmitted pilot symbols up to that time in order to estimate the channel fading coefficients .",
    "however , we underline that since the correlation among channel fading coefficients is in general decreasing with the increase in the time difference between the channel fading coefficients , it will be sufficient to use a certain number of pilot symbols rather than using all of the transmitted past pilot symbols .",
    "especially , if the channel decorrelates fast , it will be enough to use one pilot symbol to estimate the few number of channel coefficients following the pilot .",
    "we refer the interested reader to @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the receiver obtains the estimate @xmath51 when the channel sensing decision is @xmath52 , and obtains @xmath53 when the channel sensing decision is @xmath54 .",
    "now , we can express the mmse estimation as the following optimization problem : @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the probabilities of channel being sensed as idle and busy , respectively , and they can be expressed as @xmath58 and @xmath59 with @xmath27 and @xmath24 again denoting the false - alarm and detection probabilities , respectively .",
    "note that @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the channel estimation error vectors , and @xmath62 and @xmath63 represent the variances of the @xmath7 elements of @xmath60 and @xmath61 ( i.e. , @xmath64 and @xmath65 ) obtained when channel is sensed as idle and busy , respectively .",
    "from the two separate minimization problems in ( [ mmse_single_pilot2 ] ) , it is well - known that the optimal mmse estimates are given by the conditional expectations of @xmath40 given the observation @xmath66 and the sensing decision @xmath67 for @xmath68 , i.e. , we have @xmath69 the mmse estimates can further be formulated in terms of the conditional expectations of @xmath40 given the true hypothesis @xmath70 or @xmath71 , sensing decision @xmath67 and the observation @xmath66 as follows : @xmath72 from bayes rule , we can express the above conditional probabilities as @xmath73 note that @xmath74 above denotes the conditional probability of @xmath75 given @xmath76 and @xmath77 , and @xmath78 is the conditional distribution of @xmath75 given @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "if the fading coefficients , background noise , and primary users faded received signal are all gaussian distributed as we considered , the conditional expectations in ( [ estimate_single_pilot ] ) are given by @xmath79 for the special case where only the last pilot symbol is employed in channel estimation ( i.e. , @xmath48 ) , we have @xmath80^*|\\mathcal{h}_{i},\\widehat{\\mathcal{h}}_{j}\\}}{\\mathbb{e}\\{|{\\mathbf{q}}_{l , t , j}{\\mathbf{r}}_{l}+w_{lm}|^{2}|\\mathcal{h}_{i},\\widehat{\\mathcal{h}}_{j}\\}}y_{lm}\\nonumber\\\\ & = \\frac{\\mathbb{e}\\{{\\mathbf{r}}_{l}{\\mathbf{r}}_{l}^{\\dagger}{\\mathbf{q}}_{l , t , j}^{\\dagger}|\\mathcal{h}_{i},\\widehat{\\mathcal{h}}_{j}\\}}{\\mathbb{e}\\{{\\mathbf{q}}_{l , t , j}{\\mathbf{r}}_{l}{\\mathbf{r}}_{l}^{\\dagger}{\\mathbf{q}}_{l , t , j}^{\\dagger}+w_{lm}w_{lm}^{*}|\\mathcal{h}_{i},\\widehat{\\mathcal{h}}_{j}\\}}y_{lm}\\nonumber\\\\ & = \\frac{\\mathbb{e}\\{{\\mathbf{r}}_{l}{\\mathbf{r}}_{l}^{\\dagger}\\}{\\mathbf{q}}_{l , t , j}^{\\dagger}}{{\\mathbf{q}}_{l , t , j}\\mathbb{e}\\{{\\mathbf{r}}_{l}{\\mathbf{r}}_{l}^{\\dagger}\\}{\\mathbf{q}}_{l , t , j}^{\\dagger}+\\sigma_{w , i}^{2}}y_{lm}\\nonumber\\\\ & = \\frac{\\lambda_{{\\mathbf{r}}_{l}}{\\mathbf{q}}_{l , t , j}^\\dagger}{\\mathcal{e}_{t , j}\\sigma_r^2+\\sigma_{w , i}^2}y_{lm},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath81 @xmath82 is the covariance matrix of @xmath83 , and the superscripts @xmath84 and @xmath85 are used to denote the conjugate and conjugate transpose , respectively .      as seen in ( [ estimate_single_pilot ] ) ,",
    "the mmse estimates are given in terms of the weighted combination of the conditional expectations of the fading vector @xmath83 given the observation , sensing decision , and the true state of the primary user activity .",
    "these conditional expectations in general do not have closed - form expressions unless gaussian fading and gaussian noise are considered .",
    "additionally , even in a gaussian setting , evaluation of the mean - squared error of the mmse estimation is a difficult task due to the presence of the conditional distributions of @xmath66 in ( [ p1 ] ) .",
    "more specifically , while the conditional expectations @xmath86 for @xmath87 are linear functions of the observation @xmath66 , the mmse estimates @xmath88 for @xmath89 are complicated non - linear functions of @xmath66 due to having @xmath90 in the conditional probabilities in ( [ p1 ] ) .    motivated by these considerations , we now study linear mmse ( l - mmse ) estimation as a suboptimal method that can alleviate the concerns regarding the complexity of the optimal mmse estimation but can still perform close to being optimal . as",
    "also briefly discussed above , it is important to note that mmse and l - mmse estimators are in general different in our cognitive radio setting even if fading @xmath83 , noise @xmath91 , and the primary users received faded signal @xmath92 are all gaussian distributed .",
    "the primary reason for this is that the experienced additive disturbance , which is either @xmath93 or @xmath94 , has a gaussian mixture distribution in the presence of sensing uncertainty .",

    "now , the mse of l - mmse estimation is given by @xmath100 where , for the special case when only the last pilot symbol is employed in channel estimation ( i.e. , @xmath48 ) , we have @xmath101",
    "having addressed channel sensing and channel estimation , we next study the achievable rates in the cognitive radio channel when the secondary users are equipped with only imperfect channel sensing and estimation results .",
    "we note that an intricate relationship exists between sensing reliability , channel estimation quality , and transmission rates . in general , sensing performance affects the structure and quality of the channel estimation , which in turn have implications on the achievable rates .      in this subsection , we consider that memoryless linear modulation schemes ( e.g. , pulse amplitude modulation ( pam ) , phase - shift keying ( psk ) or quadrature amplitude modulation ( qam ) ) are employed at the secondary transmitter to send information to the secondary receiver in the data transmission phase with imperfect csi obtained by performing single mmse estimation at the secondary receiver .",
    "we assume that csi is available only at the secondary receiver .",
    "when the channel is sensed as idle ( i.e. , the sensing decision is @xmath52 ) , the secondary transmitter sends the signal @xmath102 in the @xmath7 symbol interval where @xmath103 , @xmath104 , and @xmath105 is the modulation size . under sensing decision @xmath52 ,",

    "note that the data transmission is performed after the channel is estimated in the training phase .    over a duration of @xmath34 symbols ,",
    "an achievable rate expression can be obtained by considering the mutual information between the input and output vectors : @xmath111&\\geq\\frac{1}{m}\\sum_{k = lm+1}^{lm+m-1}\\mathbb{e}\\left[i(x_{k};y_{k}|\\hat{r}_{k})\\right ] \\label{capacity_lower_bound_1 } \\\\ & = \\frac{1}{m}\\sum_{k = lm+1}^{lm+m-1}\\sum_{j=0}^{1}\\mathbb{e}\\bigg[\\pr\\{\\widehat{h}_{j}\\}i(x_{j , u , k};y_{k}|\\hat{r}_{j , k},\\widehat{h}_{j})\\bigg]\\label{capacity_lower_bound_8}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] on the left - hand side of ( [ capacity_lower_bound_1 ] ) , @xmath112 $ ] and @xmath113 denote the @xmath41 ( or equivalently @xmath33 ) dimensional input data and output vectors , respectively , in each transmission block of @xmath4 seconds and the expectation is with respect to @xmath114 , which is the vector of the estimates of corresponding channel fading coefficients .",
    "the lower bound in ( [ capacity_lower_bound_1 ] ) is due to the fact that a channel with memory has a higher reliable communication rate than the memoryless channel with the same marginal transition probability @xcite .",
    "hence , the mutual information between the input and output vectors is in general larger than the sum of the symbol - wise mutual information terms given on the right - hand side of ( [ capacity_lower_bound_1 ] ) .",
    "finally , ( [ capacity_lower_bound_8 ] ) is obtained by conditioning the mutual information on the sensing decisions .",
    "henceforth , our achievable rate analysis is based on the achievable rate expression in ( [ capacity_lower_bound_8 ] ) .    for a linear modulation scheme with @xmath105 signals ,",
    "the input - output mutual information given the channel estimate and the channel sensing decision @xmath95 can be expressed as @xmath115 where @xmath116 and @xmath117 with @xmath118 we know that the total average energy in one training and data transmission block is @xmath119 or @xmath120 ( or equivalently @xmath121 or @xmath122 recalling that @xmath35 ) when the channel is sensed as idle or busy , respectively , over an interval of @xmath34 symbols .",
    "if @xmath123 fraction of the total energy is allocated to the training symbol , we have the pilot energy given by @xmath124 for @xmath125 .",
    "note that @xmath126 and @xmath127 are fractions when the channel sensing results are @xmath128 and @xmath129 , respectively .",
    "remaining energy is assumed to be equally allocated among the data symbols .",
    "hence , energy per data symbol is @xmath130 for @xmath125 . in ( [ training_power ] ) and ( [ data_power ] ) , @xmath34 , @xmath131 , and @xmath132 are the design parameters that control the pilot assisted cognitive radio transmissions .",
    "@xmath34 is the frequency of the pilot symbol , and @xmath126 and @xmath127 are the fractions of the total energy , dedicated to channel training when the channel sensing decisions are @xmath128 and @xmath129 , respectively . clearly , the training parameters have an impact on the quality of data transmissions . for instance , improving the estimation quality with increasingly more frequent pilot symbol transmissions or by allocating more energy to training eventually reduces the data transmission rate since a smaller duration or smaller energy is allocated for data transmission . on the other hand , decreasing the pilot frequency or the training energy beyond a threshold decreases the data transmission rate as well due to the degradation of the channel estimate quality .    for given @xmath133 , @xmath134 , and channel fading statistics , the training period , @xmath34 , and training energy fractions , @xmath126 , @xmath127 , which maximize the achievable rates , can be determined by solving the optimization problem given in @xmath135 since closed - form solutions of this optimization problem are unlikely to be found , we resort to numerical techniques in section [ numerical_results ] to obtain the achievable - rate maximizing training and transmission parameters . for ease of exposition and computation , in the numerical results , we consider equiprobable binary psk ( bpsk ) modulation with signals @xmath136 and @xmath137 under @xmath52 and signals @xmath138 and @xmath139 under @xmath54 .      in this subsection",
    ", we assume that the channel input signals are gaussian distributed .",
    "as discussed before , in the presence of sensing errors , the additive disturbance has a gaussian mixture nature .",
    "for instance , given that the channel sensing result is @xmath67 and the input is @xmath140 , the additive disturbance is either @xmath141 or @xmath142 depending on whether the channel is actually idle or busy , respectively , and it has the following gaussian mixture conditional probability density function : @xmath143 note that we have included the channel estimate error in the additive disturbance above .",

    "we set the probability of detection @xmath178 and the probability of false alarm @xmath179 .",
    "we consider the period of pilot symbols to be @xmath180 .",
    "moreover , when the channel is sensed as busy , the pilot power is set to @xmath181 , and when the channel is sensed as idle , the pilot power is set to @xmath182 .",
    "hence , if the channel is sensed busy , the pilot power is dropped by @xmath183 db .",
    "we finally note that we consider a single pilot - symbol estimation technique in our numerical results .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] , we plot the mse in channel estimation as a function of probability of false alarm , @xmath184 , for a fixed probability of detection , @xmath185 and for @xmath186 and @xmath187 . we compare two different estimation methods .",
    "we observe that the mmse and the l - mmse methods give almost the same results , which is very promising , since l - mmse estimation has a simpler structure .",
    "furthermore , we see that the mse is increasing with the increase in @xmath184 .",
    "this is due to the fact that channel is sensed as busy more frequently due to increased probability of false alarms , and consequently the transmitter adjusts its pilot energy to the lower value , @xmath32 , more frequently with the goal of protecting the primary users . as a result ,",
    "the estimation quality degrades . note",
    "that since the primary users are not active in false alarm scenarios , the secondary users indeed miss the opportunity to transmit at high powers due to sensing uncertainty .",
    "we also notice that mse expectedly increases as @xmath166 drops from 0.95 to 0.90 , resulting in a faster varying channel .",
    "this indeed is the common theme in all mse curves . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] , we plot the mse as a function of probability of detection , @xmath185 , for a fixed probability of false alarm , @xmath184 .",
    "again , we see that l - mmse and mmse perform almost identically . additionally , even though the channel sensing becomes more reliable with increasing @xmath24 , mse increases as well .",
    "this is again due to increased detection rates of primary user activity , leading the secondary transmitter to choose the lower energy , @xmath32 , more often . while this results in the degradation of the channel estimation quality , better protection of the primary users is achieved .",
    "overall , both in figs .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] and [ fig : fig2 ] , we see that the channel estimation quality is critically dependent on the channel sensing performance .    in order to investigate the effects of the received signal interference from the primary users on the mse",
    ", we plot the mse vs. @xmath188 in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] .",
    "we see that the performances of mmse and l - mmse estimators are again close , with discrepancy increasing as @xmath188 becomes larger .",
    "note that when @xmath189 , we have channel estimation in gaussian noise in which case mmse and l - mmse estimators are identical . for @xmath190 , estimation",
    "is performed in gaussian mixture noise due to sensing uncertainty .",
    "as @xmath191 increases and @xmath188 grows , the departure from the gaussian setting is emphasized and so is the difference between the performances of mmse and l - mmse estimators . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] , we also immediately notice that the mse of both estimation schemes gets larger with increasing @xmath191 .",
    "obviously , in the presence of stronger interference from primary user transmissions , channel estimation is being performed in a noisier channel and mse is higher .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] , the mses of l - mmse and mmse estimations are plotted as a function of the pilot symbol period , @xmath34 . it is clearly seen that the mse is increasing with increasing @xmath34 . note that as @xmath34 increases , pilot symbols are sent less frequently and estimation quality for fading coefficients experienced long after the transmission of the pilot signal degrades severely .",
    "the further away the channel fading coefficient is from the pilot symbol , with lesser quality the estimation is performed for that channel fading coefficient . since we are considering the average mse for each block , the average mse increases with the increasing pilot symbol period .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] , we plot the achievable rates of bpsk and gaussian input signaling vs. pilot symbol period , @xmath34 for @xmath192 , and @xmath193 .",
    "average input signal - to - noise ratio is @xmath194 db when the channel is idle , and @xmath195 db when the channel is busy .",
    "note that the average input power is less when the channel is busy in order to protect the primary users .",
    "furthermore , the fractions of training symbol energies are @xmath196 .",
    "we observe that when @xmath197 , the maximum achievable rates are obtained when the periods of pilot symbol transmissions are @xmath198 and @xmath199 for bpsk and gaussian input , respectively , and the achievable rate of bpsk is almost half of the achievable rate of the gaussian input . by employing modulations with larger constellations",
    ", the gap can be narrowed .",
    "we also note that when @xmath166 decreases ( e.g. , @xmath200 ) and hence the channel varies faster , smaller achievable rates are attained and the rates are maximized at smaller values @xmath34 , indicating that pilot symbols should be sent more frequently . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] , we set @xmath197 and plot the same rates when @xmath201 db while @xmath202 db .",
    "hence , we have a lower value for @xmath203 now , which can arise due to more strict interference limitations .",
    "rate - maximizing training pilot period for both types of input is now @xmath204 .",
    "the gap between these two rates is less compared to that observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig7 ] , we plot the achievable rates as a function of @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "we observe that the maximum achievable rate with bpsk is obtained when @xmath205 and @xmath206 .",
    "however , when the input is gaussian , we observe that we attain the maximum achievable rate when @xmath205 and @xmath207 . finally , in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig8 ] , the achievable rates of bpsk and gaussian inputs maximized over @xmath34 , @xmath126 , and @xmath127 values are plotted as a function of @xmath203 .",
    "as expected , achievable rates increase as @xmath203 increases .",
    "also , while the achievable rate of the gaussian input progressively grows , bpsk rate saturates due to the finite size of the constellation , and hence the gap between the maximum achievable rates is proportionally increasing with increasing @xmath203 .    heretofore in the numerical results , we have always considered the setting in which the secondary users communicate over both busy- and idle - sensed channels while keeping the transmission power lower in a busy - sensed channel",
    ". however , the analysis is easily applicable to an interweave scenario in which the secondary transmitter transmits only when the channel is sensed as idle .",
    "this can be accomplished by setting @xmath208 and @xmath209 . in figs .",
    "[ fig : mse_idle ] and [ fig : achievable_idle ] , we address this scenario . in fig .",
    "[ fig : mse_idle ] , we note that unlike in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] , mse decreases with increasing detection probability @xmath24 .",
    "this is due to the following . in the case of miss - detections ,",
    "secondary receiver performs channel estimation in the presence of interference from primary user transmissions and hence suffers from higher noise and experiences higher mse with respect to that achieved when the channel is truly idle .",
    "as @xmath24 increases , miss - detection events occur less frequently and consequently channel estimation is affected less by the primary user interference .",
    "however , this does not necessarily improve the achievable rates .",
    "indeed , as we observe in fig .",
    "[ fig : achievable_idle ] , intermittent transmission due to being silent in busy - sensed channels results in lower rates and the achievable rates diminish further with increasing @xmath24 .",
    "in this paper , we have considered mobile cognitive radio systems , operating over correlated fading channels with two different power levels in three phases , namely channel sensing , channel estimation , and data transmission .",
    "we have addressed a practical setting in which channel sensing and channel estimation are being performed with possible errors .",
    "we have initially addressed channel estimation in the presence of sensing uncertainty .",
    "we have derived the mmse and l - mmse estimators for a block of @xmath34 correlated fading coefficients and determined the mse of the l - mmse estimation . through numerical analysis",
    ", we have demonstrated that the performance of l - mmse estimator generally closely matches that of the mmse estimator unless @xmath188 is large .",
    "hence , due its simpler structure , we have noted that l - mmse estimation can be preferred .",
    "numerically , we have also investigated the impact of the channel sensing performance and training parameters on the mse .",
    "for instance , increasing false - alarm or detection probabilities tend to increase the mse of estimation if the secondary users communicate over both idle- and busy - sensed channels .",
    "furthermore , we have studied the achievable rates of linear modulation schemes and gaussian inputs under both channel and sensing uncertainty . in particular , by using the sum of symbol - wise mutual information terms as our achievable rate expression , we have formulated the rates achieved by linear modulation schemes and also gaussian input signals .",
    "we have derived a closed - form achievable rate expression for the gaussian input in terms of the sensing reliability , channel estimate , variance of the channel estimation error , and data transmission energy .",
    "we have identified how achievable rates vary with the training parameters such as pilot period and pilot energies , and determined the rate - maximizing values of these parameters numerically .    1 a. goldsmith , s. a. jafar , i. maric , and s. srinivasa , `` breaking spectrum gridlock with cognitive radios : an information theoretic perspective , '' _ proceedings of the ieee _ , vol .",
