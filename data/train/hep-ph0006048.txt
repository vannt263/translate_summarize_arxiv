    "in high energy heavy ion collisions , hot and dense hadronic matter is expected to be created in conditions similar to the ones in the early universe about a few @xmath0sec after the big bang . under these conditions",
    ", strongly interacting particles may propagate with a mass that differs from the mass in the asymptotic vacuum .",
    "recently , it has been discovered that in - medium mass - modifications induce large back - to - back correlations ( bbc ) among pairs of asymptotic , observable bosons  @xcite .",
    "however , it was not known before if the bosonic bbc would have an analogous effect in the fermion sector . in this letter",
    "we show that fermion - anti - fermion pairs also exhibit bbc , if they propagate with a modified mass in the medium .",
    "the physical picture is that of a system in thermodynamical equilibrium which freezes - out suddenly .",
    "the masses and other properties of the hadrons in the system are modified due to interactions and a quasi - particle description is assumed . at freeze - out",
    "the quasi - particles are converted into the free particles that will be detected . particle ",
    "anti - particle pairs detected with momenta back - to - back give rise to a quantum - mechanical correlation due to a nonzero overlap between the in - medium states and the free states .",
    "the quantum correlation can be calculated with a bogoliubov - valatin transformation between a quasi - particle basis and a free - particle basis .",
    "the bosonic bbc ( bbbc ) have a quantum optical analogy , namely the correlations in thermalized ensembles of two - mode squeezed states .",
    "it turns out that fermion bbc ( fbbc ) also have an analogy , which is the andreev reflection , well - known in solid state physics .",
    "it refers to the scattering of electrons off the boundary of a superconductor - normal conductor junction .",
    "the reflected electrons are used to study the properties of the superconductors  @xcite .",
    "our results for fbbc generalize andreev s reflection to the case when superconductivity is suddenly switched off in the whole volume of the material , so that a junction prevails not at a given position for a long time but in the whole medium at a given instant .",
    "quantum statistics enhances the probability of observing pairs of bosons in similar momentum states , while it suppresses the probability of observing pairs of fermions with nearby momenta . in spite of such fermi - dirac suppression factors that appear in the evaluation of the correlation function , we find that the dominant term of the fbbc , due to the bogoliubov - valatin transformation , is positive and similar in strength to the bosonic bbc of refs .",
    "the fbbc could be observed experimentally in @xmath1au + @xmath1au collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) , which started to take data at the brookhaven national laboratory at @xmath2 and @xmath3 agev in 2000 and which will reach its full designed energy of @xmath4 agev in the near future .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii we consider the in - medium mass modification state at finite temperature .",
    "the spectra and the correlations for mass - shifted fermions are described in section iii and section iv contains concluding remarks .",
    "we assume the validity of the concepts of local thermalization , hydrodynamics , and a short duration of particle emission .",
    "these concepts are in agreement with the observable single - particle spectra and two - particle correlations of pions , kaons and protons  @xcite .",
    "we also assume the validity of the effective hamiltonian h = h_0+h_i , [ h ] [ e : ham ] where _ 0 = d*x * : |(*x*)(-i + m ) ( * x * ) : [ h0 ] is the hamiltonian in vacuum , and the interaction hamiltonian @xmath5 describes the medium modifications and will be discussed shortly below . in eq .",

    "these creation and annihilation operators are defined through the expansion of the baryon field operator as ( * x*)= _ , ^,*k * ( u_,*k * a_,*k * + v_^,-*k * a_^,-*k*^ ) e^i*k * , [ fe ] where @xmath17 is the volume of the system , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are dirac spinors and the summation extends over momenta @xmath20 and spin projections @xmath21 .",

    "the expectation values involving @xmath24 and @xmath25 give rise to the chaotic amplitudes , while @xmath26 gives rise to the `` squeezed '' amplitude , defined as @xmath27 the chaotic amplitudes are non - vanishing for identical type of fermions and anti - fermions , while the squeezed amplitude is non - vanishing only for particle - anti - particle pairs .",
    "we will show in the following that , as in the case of bosons  @xcite , the squeezed @xmath28 can be considerably large if the in - medium masses of the baryons are different from their free - space values .    in order to evaluate the thermal averages above we model the system as a globally thermalized gas of quasi - particles ( quasi - baryons ) .",
    "the density matrix for such a system is given not in terms of the free - space creation and annihilation operators @xmath29 , @xmath15 , @xmath30 , but by a new set that we denote by @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath30 .",

    ", one can write its self - energy function as = ^s + ^0 ^0 + ^i ^i .",
    "this function can be determined from a detailed calculation based on , for example , the walecka or the zimnyi - moszkowski models  @xcite .",

    "we observe that the fbbc are strongly enhanced when the net baryonic density decreases , and that the shape of fbbc for @xmath77 is rather similar to bbbc .",
    "for a fixed temperature , as we increase the net baryon density obviously we have an excess of baryon over anti - baryons . on the other hand",
    ", the fbbc will be larger for approximately equal baryon and anti - baryon densities and therefore the effect will be enhanced as we approach zero net baryon density .",
    "our result shows that for a baryon free region , the bbcs are approximately independent of the bosonic or the fermionic nature of the particles .",
    "in addition , the fbbc are not only positive , as in the bosonic case , but they are also of the same order of magnitude as the corresponding bbbc .    the expected magnitude of the effect is illustrated in fig .  2 for two , typical momenta of thermal - looking proton spectrum in pb + pb collisions at cern sps  @xcite , for @xmath82 mev and for @xmath83 mev .",
    "as in fig .  1 , the finite time suppression factor of eq .  ( [ suppr ] ) is used .",
    "2 indicates that the fbbc is strongly enhanced for increasing momentum @xmath60 .",
    "2 also highlights that the magnitude of the fbbc is greatly enhanced as the net baryon density decreases from normal nuclear density to a vanishing value .",
    "similarly to the bbbc case , the strength of fbbc is very sensitive to the shape of the freeze - out distribution , as well as to the value of the parameter @xmath84 , the particle freeze - out duration , as discussed in ref .",

    "these correlations appear if in - medium interactions lead to the modification of hadronic masses in the medium .",
    "the origin of these back - to - back correlations is an entirely quantum effect , related to the propagation of particle fields through a space - like boundary surface between the medium and the asymptotic region",
    ". the strength of these correlations can be unlimitedly large , and the shape of the bbc is similar for fermions and bosons .",
    "deep mathematical and physical reasons are behind these similarities . a sudden freeze - out of thermalized medium - modified quanta to asymptotic fields",
    "is described by a bosonic or a fermionic bogoliubov transformation .",

    "anti - particle states of the asymptotic quanta .    at large values of momenta ,",
    "the similarity of fermionic bbc to bosonic bbc reflects a symmetry of the decaying medium to observable boson - anti - boson and fermion - anti - fermion pairs .",
    "this effect vanishes in case of exactly zero in - medium mass - modification , but for large values of @xmath60 and small values of mass - shifts , bbc can be very large and should be observable if the freeze - out process of the medium modified quanta is sufficiently sudden , for example if the duration of particle freeze - out is within @xmath93  fm / c .    in this letter , we have extended the concept of back - to - back correlations to an important new domain of broad experimental and theoretical interest . as a reduction of the net baryon density by a factor of 10 increases dramatically the magnitude of the effect",
    ", the almost baryon - free mid - rapidity region of @xmath94 collisions at rhic seems to be an ideal place to find the back - to - back correlations of proton - anti - proton or @xmath95 - @xmath96 pairs experimentally .",
