    "[ sec : introduction ] the first heavy - ion run at the lhc took place in the fall of 2010 with pb+pb collisions at @xmath0 = 2.76 tev , a factor of @xmath114 higher than the top rhic energy of @xmath0 =  200  gev , opening a new energy frontier in the investigation of the strongly interacting quark gluon plasma .",
    "although the run was relatively short with an integrated luminosity of @xmath19  @xmath2b@xmath3 the three experiments , alice , atlas and cms , reported shortly after the run an impressive amount of high quality results @xcite .",
    "the prime question being asked with the advent of lhc results is what is different at the lhc compared to the knowledge accumulated over the last decade at rhic ?",
    "there are obvious quantitative differences between the two cases but the interesting issue is whether there are qualitative differences . in these proceedings ,",

    "this translates into an energy density that is estimated to be at least a factor of 3 larger at lhc than at rhic .",

    "the almost constant value of @xmath12 from sps to lhc could reflect that some saturation scale is at play already at the sps or that geometrical effects dictate the shape of the @xmath13 centrality dependence .",
    "measurements of two pion bose - einstein correlations ( hbt ) show an increase in the radii r@xmath14 , r@xmath15 and r@xmath16 above the rhic values that indicate an increase of the freeze - out volume by a factor of about 2 @xcite .",
