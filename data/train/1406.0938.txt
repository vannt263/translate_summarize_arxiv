    "a chain of binary interacting units is a simple model for discussing the emergence of collective phenomena . despite its simplicity",
    ", such setup appears frequently in various physical contexts such as for the description of mechanical and electrical systems , polymers , networks of superconducting elements , chemical reactions in connected discrete boxes , to name but a few @xcite .    in this study",
    "we use the linear chain and its cooperative dynamical phenomena as a paradigm of a multidimensional dynamical system .",
    "we aim to investigate escape processes of the chain out of a metastable state@xcite also known as the nucleation of a kink - antikink pair @xcite in biased sinusoidal potentials . to this end",
    "we place a chain with linear springs being responsible for the interaction between the units in a nonlinear potential modelled by polynomial of 3rd degree . as will be seen , energy along the chain will become inhomogeneously distributed and parts of the chain with large elongations will collect energy from their neighbouring regions .",
    "such localized modes of energy are know as breather - solutions and have been studied intensively in the past in various contexts including micro - mechanical cantilever arrays @xcite , arrays of coupled josephson junctions @xcite , coupled optical wave guides @xcite , bose - einstein condensates in optical lattices @xcite , in coupled torsion pendula @xcite , electrical transmission lines @xcite , and granular crystals @xcite .",
    "we concentrate here on the escape process and elaborate how the localized breathers modify this process @xcite . for this purpose",
    "we consider first the pure deterministic set - up and study the properties of breathers arising on the chain whose units evolve in the nonlinear potential . in",
    "the second set - up we investigate thermally activated escape dynamics .",
    "the chain will be exposed to a thermal bath with temperature @xmath1 . consequently damping and noise",
    "is added to the deterministic dynamics accounting for coupled langevin equations .",
    "our main new findings concern the study of how a change of the friction coefficient modifies the escape process . while for stronger damping breather solutions do not play a significant role , in case of weak damping the escape times become even shorter compared to the deterministic case .",
    "notably , the establishment of breathers along the chain helps the emergence of critical elongations from thermal fluctuations .",
    "this work is structured as follows : in sec .",
    "[ 1d:1d - chain_model ] we introduce the model of a linearly coupled chain situated in an external nonlinear potential describing a metastable situation .",
    "we study the critical transition state , i.e. the bottleneck configuration which the chain has to cross in order that a transition over the potential barrier takes place . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] we derive conditions for the modulational instability which determine the time scale for the growth of the breathers .",
    "we find two generic scenarios which govern the transition . with larger energy singular breathers",
    "achieve large elongations and can surpass the transition states alone .",
    "differently , if the elongation of the breathers are too small , they undergo an erratic motion . on collision , breathers tend to merge .",
    "thereby they cumulatively localize energy which can eventually cause the barrier crossing . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] we study the thermally activated escape of the interacting chain in the metastable potential landscape .",
    "finally , we summarize our findings .",
    "we study an one - dimensional chain of @xmath0 linearly coupled oscillators of mass @xmath2 with elongations @xmath3 .",
    "the chain is positioned in a cubic external potential .",
    "every mass point experiences a nonlinear force caused by the potential @xmath4 and spring forces created from the neighbours with spring constant @xmath5 .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are applied .",
    "positions of particles perpendicular to the potential variation are kept constant@xcite , ( for an alternative case see @xcite ) .",
    "first , we assume that there is no noise and no damping , hence yielding a canonic situation with a hamiltonian dynamics and corresponding momenta @xmath6 canonically conjugate to the positions @xmath7 . consequently the total energy of the chain is conserved .    in order to obtain dimensionless quantities",
    "we rescale units and parameters , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 . as a result",
    ", we remain with dimensionless hamiltonian with one remaining parameter only , the effective coupling strength @xmath11 . in what follows",
    "we omit the tildes .",

    "a study of the dependence of the escape process on the number of oscillators can be found in @xcite .    for the study of an escape , we initially place the units of the chain close to the bottom of the external potential , that is nearby @xmath15 and provide them with energy @xmath16 .",
    "as will be seen , the chain eventually generates critical elongations surpassing the potentials local maximum .",
    "this initiates a transition of the chain into the unbounded regime @xmath17 , which we refer to as an escape . for a single particle to overcome the potential barrier it needs to be supplied with an energy @xmath18 .    in the following we want to illustrate that the generation of these critical states is efficient even in cases where the chain energy @xmath16 is small compared to @xmath19",
    "this low - energy setting is obtained through the following initial preparation of the system @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are small random perturbations taken from a uniform distribution within the intervals @xmath23 \\text { and } \\delta p_i\\in \\left[-\\delta      p^{\\mbox{ic}},\\delta p^{\\mbox{ic } } \\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the coordinate shift , @xmath24 , is chosen to increase the system energy to a desired value .",
    "this procedure results in a variety of perturbed flat initial states comprising a specific energy which we view as a statistical ensemble .      for hamiltonian systems the local minima of the energy surface ( in phase space )",
    "are lyapunov stable .",
    "that is , orbits in the vicinity of a local minimum never leave it as their associated energy is conserved .",
    "therefore , orbits with an energy exceeding the energy associated with a neighbouring saddle point of first order are no longer bound to the basin . thus the saddle point",
    "is referred to as transition state , as it separates bounded from unbounded orbits .",
    "concerning our problem , the system s energy has to exceed the transition state energy to make escape events possible . to determine this transition states",
    ", we have to solve @xmath25 , where @xmath26 denotes the potential energy ( thus the transition state is a fixed - point ) and the solution must render all eigenvalues of the hessian matrix of @xmath26 positive , except for a single negative one . in general , this is a non - trivial task requiring sophisticated numerical methods . here",
    ", we used the dimer method .",
    "it is a minimum - mode following method that solely makes use of gradients of the potential surface .",
    "it was first introduced in @xcite and its computational effort scales favorable with the system size .    in the one - dimensional chain model",

    "consequently , the fixed points of the system consist of all the configurations where each oscillators is placed either on the maximum of the potential barrier or the potential valley , @xmath31 . in this case also",
    "the hessian matrix , @xmath29 , becomes diagonal and we can directly read off its eigenvalues , @xmath32 . demanding all eigenvalues to be negative except for one positive",
    "the transition states are found to be all the configurations where all oscillator are positioned in the potential valley except for one that is placed on the potential barrier .",
    "the according energy reads @xmath33 .",
    "in contrast , a very large coupling strength corresponds to a situation where the chain effectively becomes a single oscillator so that the transition state refers to a chain configuration where all oscillators are placed on the maximum of the potential .",

    "the maximal amplitude of the hair pin - like transition state configuration grows with increasing @xmath5 until it reaches a critical elongation from which on it decreases until the entire chain approaches the maximum of the potential barrier as described above .",
    "the energy that is initially homogeneously distributed along the entire chain quickly concentrates into local excitations of single oscillators .",
    "this process is governed by the formation of regularly shaped wave patterns , so - called breathers which are spatially localized and time - periodically varying solutions .",
    "their emergence is due to a modulation instability the mechanism of which applied to our situation is described later on .",

    "furthermore , we assume our envelope functions to vary slowly ( @xmath50 ) as well as the phonon band to be small ( @xmath51 ) . within the limits of these assumptions",

    "[ 1d:1d - chain_model ] that our system is initially prepared in a slightly perturbed @xmath75 mode .",
    "this is thus the only possible carrier wave mode as the amplitudes , @xmath76 , of all other modes ( which scale with the amplitude of the perturbation ) are likely to be too small to generate growing modes  see inequality ( [ mi1d : unstable_q ] )  or the arising maximal growth rates are suppressed .",
    "evaluating the growth rate of instabilities on the @xmath75 carrier mode for different values of @xmath5 ( fig .",

    "in particular its prominent mode number , and therefore the number of breathers , gets smaller , all of which results in an efficient energy localization .",

    "we can analytically approximate the optimal @xmath5 by assuming that the entire system energy is evenly distributed among @xmath77 non - interacting oscillators , where @xmath77 is the number of breathers related to the prominent wave length , @xmath78 , of the modulational instability .",
    "the ratio of such an oscillator s energy , @xmath79 , to the activation energy can be regarded as a measure of escape efficiency .",

    "instead , breathers start an erratic movement . after an inelastic interaction they merge and",
    "can thereby eventually result in a configuration exceeding the critical chain elongation , see also @xcite . however , this secondary process is slow compared to the ( direct ) breather formation which explains the different orders of magnitude of the escape times scale in fig . [",

    "the relaxation time of the chain scales with the inverse of the damping constant . correspondingly , the life times of local excitations grow with decreasing @xmath96 .",
    "the outcome is a more heterogeneous energetic structure where thermal fluctuations are more likely to cause critical chain elongations .",
    "this explains the faster escape comparing small with large damping constants .",
    "but even in the case of very small @xmath96 the relaxation time is still much shorter than the time needed for the coalescence of multiple breathers ( which is of the order of several hundred time units , see fig .",
    "[ fig : ts : energy_evolution_b ] ) .",
    "therefore , the long term cumulative concentration of energy , as described in [ 1d : optimal_coupling ] , is generally inhibited in the thermal case .",
    "this explains the virtual impossibility of a thermal escape for small energies .    in the opposite case of higher energies",
    "the deterministic escape is mostly proceeded by initial breathers .",
    "the formation time of the initial breather array can be estimated by the inverse of the maximal growth rate , @xmath110 from eq .",

    "we recall from sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] that @xmath110 was determined starting with a linear expansion in the perturbations .",
    "we believe that this explains the better match in the case of smaller initial perturbations .",
    "the divergence of @xmath107 with the average escape times for small energies again gives evidence to the fact that the initial breather array does not induce an escape and other mechanisms are needed .    in the thermally activated case the large energy setting holds two characteristic scenarios",
    "the mobility of the breathers becomes amplified if noise acts . if the breathers possess longer life times , _",
    "i.e. _ for smaller damping , a few ( usually not more the two ) breathers can temporarily merge and thus approach a critical chain elongation .",
    "starting with a heterogeneous energy structure after thermalization , this then leads to smaller escape times compared to the deterministic setting that first has to re - allocate energy from an initially homogeneous state .",
    "oppositely for stronger damping , the life times of breather is too short and the energy distribution is mostly homogeneous ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1d : e_evo_thermal_2 ] ) .",
    "the escapes then relies entirely on rare , large enough spontaneous fluctuation of the noise term and the average escape times generally become comparatively large .",
    "finally , we want to examine the converse behaviour for different magnitudes of the initial perturbations in the deterministic case .",
    "as the initial conditions for smaller perturbations are closer to the @xmath75 phonon mode the initial breather array emerges more quickly so that the escape times are smaller when the energy is high enough for initial breathers to ignite the escape .",
    "contrarily , stronger perturbations lead to a higher breather mobility which accelerates the breather coalescence so that the escape times become smaller when low energy necessitates coalescence .",
    "we have studied various examples of collective escape processes in many - particle systems .",
    "first we started with a noise - free escape in a chain of coupled oscillators evolving in a metastable potential .",
    "the second part of this work examined a thermally activated escape .",
    "to this end the original system has been augmented by a linear friction term and gaussian thermal , white noise of vanishing mean satisfying the fluctuation dissipation theorem .",
    "while a thermally activated escape becomes virtually impossible at low system energy , the deterministic system remains capable of efficiently crossing the potential barrier . in more detail , the deterministic dynamics of interacting chain units",
    "leads to the formation of breather solutions localizing energy such that the chain passes through a transition state and crosses the potential barrier .",
    "in particular at low system energy , the interaction between several formed breathers resulting in their coalescence eventually enables the chain to accumulate sufficient energy to overcome the potential barrier .",
    "interestingly , in the thermally activated setting with a sufficiently weak damping , the breather formation and thermal fluctuation cooperate to localize energy which accomplishes effective barrier crossings .",
    "we underline that the dynamics of interacting particles exhibiting collective behaviour such as breather formation and their interaction has a huge impact on the escape and activation dynamics in such many - body systems .",
