    "supersymmetry ( susy ) is one of the most attractive extensions of the standard model .",
    "this symmetry solves the naturalness problem and predicts gauge coupling unification at the gut scale @xmath1 .",
    "it also predicts the existence of superpartner of the standard model ( sm ) particles . from the naturalness argument , their masses should be below tev range , hence these particles will be discovered at tevatron or large hadron collider ( lhc )",
    ".    mechanisms of susy breaking and its mediation to the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) sector are one of the most important problems in the susy phenomenology . in many models ,",
    "this dynamics is related to high energy physics far above the electroweak(ew ) scale , e.g. , gut scale or planck scale .",
    "once the mechanism is specified , mass spectrum and flavor structure of susy particle at the ew scale can be determined by a small number of parameters .",
    "hence it may be possible to confirm or exclude the mechanism by direct search or flavor - changing - neutral - current ( fcnc ) experiments in near future .",
    "if susy breaking is mediated by gravity , the structure of susy breaking masses of scalars are determined by khler potential . in the present paper ,",
    "we focus on the no - scale type khler potential , in which the hidden sector and the observable sector are separated as follows : @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are hidden sector fields and observable sector fields , respectively",
    ". this type of khler potential is originally investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite with @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "characteristic features of the khler potential eq.([eq : noscalekahler ] ) is that all scalar masses and trilinear scalar couplings ( a - terms ) vanish as the cosmological constant vanishes@xcite .",
    "the only source of susy breaking is gaugino masses .",
    "hence this scenario is highly predictive , various phenomenological consequences are obtained with a few parameters . the separation in eq.([eq : noscalekahler ] ) implies that couplings of the hidden sector and the observable sector is flavor blind , and contributions of susy particles to fcnc are suppressed .",
    "therefore this khler potential is also interesting from the viewpoint of the susy flavor problem .",
    "the no - scale structure of the khler potential is obtained in various models .",
    "it has been shown that in some classes of string theory , for example weakly coupled @xmath7 heterotic string theory , khler potential becomes the no - scale type@xcite . if the hidden sector and the observable sector are separated in the superspace density in the supergravity lagrangian , the khler potential is indeed given as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : noscalekahler ] ) . in the two cases ,",
    "the gaugino masses can be induced if the hidden sector fields couple to the gauge multiplets via the gauge kinetic function .",
    "recently it has been pointed out that the form eq.([eq : noscalekahler ] ) is realized naturally in a five - dimensional setting with two branes , namely , sequestered sector scenario@xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "the hidden sector fields live on one brane and the visible sector fields live on the other .",
    "it has been shown that the form of the khler potential of the effective theory obtained by dimensional reduction is indeed eq.([eq : noscalekahler])@xcite .",
    "if the sm gauge fields dwell in the bulk , gaugino mediate the susy breaking on the hidden sector brane to the visible sector brane and the no - scale boundary condition is given at the compactification scale of the fifth dimension ( gaugino mediation @xcite ) .    in the no - scale scenario , degrees of freedom of susy particle mass spectrum",
    "is limited because only non - zero soft susy breaking masses are gaugino masses and higgs mixing mass @xmath8 at the energy scale where the boundary condition is given . hence phenomenological aspects of this scenario have been investigated in the literature , mainly focusing on the mass spectrum .",
    "direct search bounds and the cosmological constraint ( i.e. , a charged particle can not be the lsp if the r - parity is conserved ) were considered and allowed region in the parameter space was identified . for the boundary condition ,",
    "the following three cases were considered .",
    "first , universal gaugino masses are given at the gut scale .",
    "in this case , the cosmological constraint is severe and only the region @xmath9 and @xmath10 is allowed since stau tends to be light@xcite .",
    "the second case is that universal gaugino masses are given above the gut scale .",
    "and the third case is that non - universal gaugino masses are given at the gut scale . in this case wino ,",
    "higgsino or sneutrino can be the lsp . in the latter two cases ,",
    "it is shown that the cosmological constraint is not severer than the first case .    in the present paper ,",
    "current limits from the lightest higgs mass @xmath11 and the branching ratio for @xmath0 are also used to constrain the no - scale scenario . combining these constraints",
    ", we will show that almost all the parameter region is excluded when universal gaugino masses are given at the gut scale .",
    "however , when the boundary condition is given above the gut scale , relatively large parameter region is allowed .",
    "we also consider the case that the non - universal gaugino masses are given at the gut scale .",
    "we will show that these constraints are important when the higgsino - like neutralino is the lsp .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : noscalsebc ] , we review some phenomenological aspects of the no - scale models , especially indications of the direct search bounds and the cosmological bound . in section [ sec : higgsbsgamma ] , we further constrain these models from the higgs mass bound and @xmath12 result . indications of these bounds for the tevatron are also discussed .",
    "our conclusions are given in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "in this section , we briefly review phenomenological aspects of susy models with no - scale boundary condition , mainly indications of the cosmological bound and direct search limit at lep 2 .",
    "we consider the following three cases .    *",
    "universal gaugino masses are given at the gut scale .",
    "hereafter we call this case the minimal scenario . *",
    "universal gaugino masses are given above the gut scale @xmath13 . throughout this paper",
    ", we take the minimal su(5 ) to be the theory above the gut scale as a typical example . *",
    "non - universal gaugino masses are given at the gut scale .",
    "once one of the above boundary conditions is given , mass spectrum of susy particles at the ew scale and their contributions to fcnc can be calculated . in this paper",
    "we solve the one - loop level rges to obtain the soft susy breaking mass parameters at the ew scale .",
    "the higgsino mass parameter @xmath14 is determined by potential minimum condition at the one - loop level .",
    "first , we discuss the minimal scenario . in this case",
    ", the following boundary condition is given at the gut scale , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the common scalar mass and @xmath17 is universal trilinear scalar coupling . with this boundary condition , bino and right - handed",
    "sleptons are lighter than other susy particles .",
    "their masses are approximately , @xmath18 from eq.([eq : minimalmneumtau ] ) we see that the charged right - handed slepton is the lsp if the d - term @xmath19 is negligible , i.e. , @xmath20 .",
    "hence this parameter region is excluded by the cosmological consideration . on the other hand ,",
    "lep 2 experiments yields the upper bound on the cross section for smuon pair production , @xmath21 for @xmath22 and @xmath23@xcite , so the parameter region @xmath24 is excluded in fig .",
    "[ fig : limitmimposmu ] and [ fig : limitmimnegmu ] , allowed region of the parameter space are shown in the @xmath25 plane .",
    "the regions above the dash - dotted line and the left side of the dash - dot - dotted line are excluded by cosmological bound and lep 2 bound on smuon pair production , respectively .",
    "therefore the minimal scenario is constrained severely .",
    "next we see the case that the universal gaugino masses are given above the gut scale . in the minimal su(5 ) case , the right - handed slepton belongs to 10-plet , so the large group factor makes slepton masses heavier .",
    "for example , when @xmath26 the bino mass and the right - handed slepton mass at the weak scale are approximately given , @xmath27 hence the cosmological constraint is not severe because the stau mass is large enough and neutralino is the lsp in the large parameter region @xcite . in the fig.[fig : limitmbc1e17posmu ] and [ fig : limitmbc1e17negmu ] , the same figures as in the fig.[fig : limitmimposmu ] and [ fig : limitmimnegmu ] are shown .",
    "unlike in the minimal case , the stau search bound at lep @xcite is also plotted because mass difference between @xmath28 and @xmath29 is larger than in the minimal case and it can be stronger than the smuon search . from these figures we see that the @xmath29 lsp is avoided unless @xmath30 is larger than about 20 .",
    "the charged stau lsp can also be avoided if gaugino masses at the gut scale are non - universal@xcite , i.e. , the following boundary condition is given , @xmath31 this boundary condition can be given naturally within the gut framework @xcite . in this case ,",
    "not only bino - like neutralino , but also wino - like , higgsino - like neutralino or sneutrino can be the lsp . for @xmath32 and @xmath33 ,",
    "the lsp is wino - like neutralino .",
    "for example , when @xmath34 and @xmath35 , then wino mass and charged slepton mass are ( notice that in this case the left - handed sleptons are lighter than right - handed sleptons ) ; @xmath36 the higgsino is the lsp if @xmath37 . for example , when @xmath38 and @xmath39 , then the higgsino mass and the right - handed slepton mass are @xmath40 in the two cases given above , neutral wino or higgsino is the lsp .",
    "in fact from fig.[fig : limit12r432r2posmu ] - [ fig : limit12r232r0.5negmu ] we find that neural particle is the lsp in large parameter region , thus it is cosmologically viable .",
    "in the previous section we take into account only lep 2 bound and the cosmological constraint .",
    "we find that the minimal scenario is severely constrained , but the other two scenarios are not . in this section",
    "we also include the current higgs mass bound and @xmath41 constraint .",
    "as we will see , combining the above four constraint , not only the minimal case but also the other two scenarios can be constrained more severely .",
    "we also discuss the possibility whether this scenario can be seen at the tevatron run 2 or not .",
    "before we show the numerical results , some remarks on our calculation of the higgs mass and @xmath12 are in order .",
    "it is well known that radiative correction is important when the lightest higgs mass is evaluated @xcite . in the present paper ,",
    "the lightest higgs mass is evaluated by means of the one - loop level effective potential@xcite .",
    "this potential is evaluated at the renormalization point of the geometrical mean of the two stop mass eigenvalues @xmath42 .",
    "we compared our result with a two - loop result by using _",
    "feynhiggs_@xcite , and checked that the difference between these two results is smaller than 5 gev as long as @xmath30 is bigger than 5 .",
    "when @xmath30 is close to 2 , the difference can be 7 gev .",
    "however , as we will see later , higgs mass bound plays an important rule around @xmath43 . and",
    "the two - loop effects always make the higgs mass lighter than that obtained at the one - loop level .",
    "so our conclusion is conservative and is not significantly changed by the two - loop effect .",
    "we exclude the parameter region where the lightest higgs mass is lighter than the current 95% c.l .",
    "limit from lep 2 experiments , @xmath44 @xcite .    in the present paper , @xmath12",
    "is calculated including leading order ( lo ) qcd corrections@xcite , and compare it to the current cleo measurement . in the mssm",
    ", chargino contribution can be comparable to the sm and charged higgs contributions .",
    "they interfere constructively ( destructively ) each other when @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "the difference between the lo and the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) result can be sizable only when cancellation among different contributions at the lo is spoiled by the nlo contributions .",
    "as we will see , however , the @xmath41 constraint is severe when the interference is constructive . in the case of destructive interference where the deviation from the nlo result may be large ,",
    "this constraint is not so important .",
    "hence we expect that our conclusion is not changed significantly by the inclusion of the nlo corrections . for the experimental value",
    ", we use 95% c.l .",
    "limit from cleo , @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "first we show the numerical results for the minimal case .",
    "the case for @xmath48 is shown in fig.[fig : limitmimposmu ] . in this case , for small @xmath30 region , the stop mass is not so large that radiative correction factor @xmath49 which raises the higgs mass is small .",
    "( for example , @xmath50 gev and @xmath51 gev for @xmath52 gev and @xmath53 ) .",
    "hence the higgs mass limit constrains this scenario severely . in fig.[fig : limitmimposmu ] , the higgs mass bound and @xmath12 constraints in the @xmath54 plane are shown .",
    "the regions below the solid line and above the dashed line are excluded by the higgs mass and @xmath12 bound , respectively .",
    "the indication of @xmath55 reported by lep 2@xcite is also shown in this figure . from the figure we find that the higgs mass bound almost excludes the region where the stau lsp is avoided .",
    "note that , as we discussed earlier , the bound we put on the higgs mass may be conservative , because the two loop correction may further reduce the higgs mass .    the same figure but for @xmath56 is shown in fig.[fig : limitmimnegmu ] .",
    "now @xmath12 also constrains parameter region strongly since chargino contribution to @xmath0 interferes with sm and charged higgs ones constructively .",
    "the region above the dashed line is excluded by @xmath12 constraint .",
    "we find that only one of the two constraints is enough to exclude all the region where cosmological bound and the smuon mass bound are avoided .",
    "hence if r - parity is conserved , i.e. , the cosmological bound is relevant , this scenario with @xmath56 is excluded .",
    "next we show the numerical results in the case that the cutoff scale is larger than the gut scale . as a typical example , we choose the minimal su(5 ) as the theory above the gut scale . in fig.[fig :",
    "limitmbc1e17posmu ] and [ fig : limitmbc1e17negmu ] , results are shown for positive and negative @xmath14 , respectively . in both figures ,",
    "we take @xmath58 gev . for @xmath48 case , large parameter region",
    "is allowed and susy scale @xmath59 can be as small as about 180 gev , which indicates the lsp mass @xmath60 gev . for @xmath56 , as in the minimal case , @xmath12 constraint is severer , and @xmath59 must be larger than around 280 gev .",
    "we also considered other values of the boundary scale @xmath61 from @xmath62 to @xmath63 , and checked that the behavior of the contour plot does not change so much .",
    "according to ref.@xcite , tevatron run 2 experiment can explore up to @xmath64 gev for integrated luminosity @xmath65 .",
    "hence if @xmath66 and @xmath67 , susy particles can be discovered at the experiment . in this range ,",
    "trilepton from chargino - neutralino associated production @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 is one of clean signals for susy search .",
    "notice that now two body decay @xmath71 opens .",
    "so same flavor , opposite sign dilepton from @xmath72 decay may be useful .",
    "the two body decay allows us to observe the peak edge of invariant mass of two leptons at the @xmath73 .",
    "it is expressed in terms of the neutralino masses and the slepton mass as , @xmath74 in table [ tab : mllmax ] , the dependence of @xmath73 on @xmath61 is shown . here",
    "we fix @xmath75 .",
    "notice that as @xmath61 changes , the right - handed mass changes sizably while the neutralino masses do not .",
    "hence we can obtain the mass relation among them and also cutoff scale @xmath61 , which corresponds to the compactification scale in the sequestered sector scenario , by measuring @xmath73 . on the other hand , since only @xmath76 gev is allowed for @xmath45 , the tevatron run 2 can not survey this scenario , and we have to wait lhc experiment .",
    "next , we turn to the case that gaugino masses are non - universal at the gut scale .",
    "we explore the following three cases , wino - like neutralino lsp , higgsino - like neutralino lsp and the tau sneutrino lsp .",
    "we will see that in the wino - like neutralino lsp and tau sneutrino lsp cases , constraint is not so severe even if we combine higgs mass bound and @xmath12 data , but in the higgsino - like lsp case where stops are as light as sleptons and charginos , the predicted higgs mass tends to be small , and thus the higgs mass bound becomes important .",
    "first , we discuss the wino - lsp case .",
    "the results for @xmath34 , @xmath35 are shown in fig.[fig : limit12r432r2posmu ] and fig.[fig : limit12r432r2negmu ] , for @xmath46 and @xmath45 , respectively . in this case , we obtain a relatively large higgs mass since @xmath77 is large and so are the masses of stops .",
    "hence , for @xmath46 , @xmath78 can be as small as 100 gev at @xmath43 , where the mass of the lsp @xmath79 is about 90 gev . for @xmath45",
    ", though @xmath12 constraint is slightly severer than in the @xmath46 case , @xmath80 is allowed , which corresponds to @xmath81 .",
    "hence the wino - lsp with mass around 100 gev is allowed .",
    "examples of the mass spectrum in this case are listed as point a ( @xmath46 ) and point b ( @xmath45 ) in table [ tab : spectrum ] . at the both points ,",
    "@xmath59 is chosen to be near the smallest value such that all constraints are avoided .",
    "in general , however , masses of @xmath28 and @xmath82 are highly degenerate when wino is the lsp .",
    "in fact , from table [ tab : spectrum ] , we see that the mass difference is less than 1 gev .",
    "therefore a lepton from @xmath70 is very soft and trilepton signal search is not useful because acceptance cut usually requires the smallest transverse momentum of the three leptons @xmath83 to be larger than 5 gev@xcite .",
    "recently collider phenomenology in such cases are studied in ref .",
    "it is shown that certain range of @xmath84 and @xmath85 , susy signals which are different from those in the minimal case can be detected .",
    "the high degeneracy requires to include radiative corrections to calculate @xmath85 @xcite , which is beyond of this work .",
    "it deserves detail study to estimate the mass difference in the scenario .",
    "since the constraint for the sneutrino lsp case in the @xmath86 plane is similar to those in the wino - lsp case , we show the result for @xmath46 only in fig.[fig : limit12r2.532r1.5posmu ] . in the figure",
    ", we take @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "notice that the decomposition of the lsp depends on @xmath30 and the sneutrino is the lsp for @xmath89 .",
    "an example of the mass spectrum is listed as the point c in table [ tab : spectrum ] . in this case ,",
    "trilepton signal comes from @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 .",
    "since @xmath93 , @xmath94 of a lepton from @xmath82 decay is small and this signal may be hard to be detected .",
    "we may need unusual trigger to explore this scenario .",
    "next , we turn to the higgsino lsp case .",
    "higgsino lsp scenario is realized when @xmath77 is smaller than half of @xmath78 , which indicates that colored particles are lighter than in the universal gaugino mass case .",
    "hence the one - loop correction to the higgs potential which enhances the higgs mass is small and the higgs mass constraint is important . the same figures as fig.[fig : limitmimposmu ] and [ fig : limitmimnegmu ] are shown in fig.[fig : limit12r232r0.5posmu ] ( @xmath46 ) and fig.[fig : limit12r232r0.5negmu ] ( @xmath45 ) for @xmath95 and @xmath39 . in order to satisfy the higgs mass bound , @xmath78 must be larger than around 300 gev .",
    "combining the bound with @xmath12 , constraint becomes severer , especially for @xmath45 case where @xmath96 is required .",
    "example of mass spectrum in this scenario is listed as point d and e in table [ tab : spectrum ] .",
    "again we choose almost the smallest value of @xmath78 where all constraints are avoided .",
    "we see that the lsp mass must be at least @xmath97 for @xmath46 and @xmath98 for @xmath45 .",
    "hence this scenario can not be explored at the tevatron run 2 .",
    "the no - scale type boundary conditions are obtained in various types of susy models .",
    "this scenario is attractive because it is highly predictive and can be a solution to the susy flavor problem . in this paper",
    "we investigated the indication of the current higgs mass and @xmath41 constraint on susy models with the boundary condition .",
    "first we considered the minimal case where the universal gaugino mass are given at the gut scale .",
    "this scenario has been already constrained by direct search at lep and the cosmological bound severely , under the assumption of the exact r - parity .",
    "we showed that the higgs mass bound and @xmath41 constraint are also taken into account , then almost all the parameter region is excluded , leaving very narrow allowed region for @xmath48 .",
    "next we considered the case that the boundary condition is given above the gut scale .",
    "since the cosmological constraint is not severe , wide region of the parameter space is allowed . in the @xmath46 case ,",
    "tevatron have a chance to observe susy signatures like trilepton events .",
    "the scale @xmath61 may be explored by measuring the peak edge of invariant mass of two leptons at the @xmath73 .",
    "however for the @xmath45 case , since @xmath99 is required , we have to wait lhc .",
    "finally we considered the case where non - universal gaugino masses are given at the gut scale .",
    "we see that the higgs mass bound is strong in the higgsino lsp case because stop masses are as light as sleptons and charginos .",
    "the mass of the higgsino - like neutralino must be larger than about 245 gev and 370 gev for @xmath46 and @xmath45 , respectively . in the wino lsp and sneutrino lsp case",
    ", the mass of the lsp can be as small as 150 gev .",
    "however , the mass difference between the lsp and parent particles produced at the collider is much smaller than in the minimal case , unusual acceptance cut may be required .",
