    "over the last 15 years significant progress has been made in the development of light sources , capable of generating ultra - short pulses lasting just a fraction of a femtosecond @xcite .",
    "one of the key experimental challenges has been the characterisation of these light pulses @xcite . by overlapping the ultra - short pulse with an ir pulse during an ionization process , sidebands are observed in photoelectron spectra .",
    "examination of these sidebands allows the extraction of the phase differences between the different harmonic constituents of the ultra - short pulse @xcite .",
    "knowledge of these phase differences then allows the reconstruction of the ultra - short light pulse .",
    "interest in sidebands created when photoionization by high - frequency light occurs in the presence of an ir field is not just limited to the characterisation of ultra - short light pulses . with the advent of free - electron lasers operating at high photon energies @xcite , the interplay between euv photons and ir photons in the photoionization process @xcite can give valuable information about the time delay between the euv and the ir pulse .",
    "the experimental interest in sidebands generated by the addition of an ir field to an euv field should be complemented by theoretical investigation . a good description of these sidebands is given by the soft - photon approximation ( spa ) @xcite , in which the angular distribution of the ejected electron is modified by bessel functions , depending on the number of ir photons absorbed and the angle at which the electron is emitted with respect to the polarization direction .",
    "this approximation applies when the energy of the ir photon is much larger than the energy of electrons emitted by the euv field by itself .",
    "when the energies of the emitted electron and the ir photon are comparable , the ionic potential will affect the motion of the outgoing electron , and the predictions of the spa may not be as accurate .    in the present study",
    ", we investigate the effect of the residual ionic potential on the angular distributions of sidebands generated during euv+ir photoionization of he using the r - matrix including time - dependence ( rmt ) approach @xcite .",
    "the he atom has been chosen , since the angular distributions of the photoelectron ejected in two - colour fields have been the subject of experimental investigation , either when the euv pulse is sufficiently energetic to eject an electron from he @xcite , or when the pulse excites one of the 1s electrons to an excite np state @xcite .",
    "in addition , for he , it is straightforward to change the amount of atomic structure retained in the calculations . a similar study of photo - electron angular distributions has recently been performed for ar using the time - dependent r - matrix ( tdrm ) approach @xcite , including a comparison with experiment @xcite , the spa @xcite and model potential anisotropy parameters @xcite .",
    "the present calculation thus also allows us to assess the computational efficiency of the two different time - dependent r - matrix approaches .",
    "the rmt approach was developed only a few years ago@xcite , and has since been applied to study time delays in photoionization of ne @xcite , to two - photon double ionization of he @xcite , and to ir - assisted photoionization of ne@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "similar to the tdrm approach @xcite , it employs the standard r - matrix technique of separating configuration space into an inner region and an outer region .",
    "however , the wavefunction is propagated using an arnoldi approach @xcite in the rmt approach , compared to a crank - nicholson scheme in the tdrm approach .",
    "spatially , the tdrm approach applies a sequential r - matrix propagation scheme , which restricts the degree of parallelisation to about 100 - 200 processors .",
    "this sequential step does not occur within the rmt approach , and it can therefore be efficiently parallelised over substantially larger numbers of processors @xcite .    in the present report , we will first describe the rmt approach and indicate the differences between the rmt approach and the tdrm approach .",
    "we then apply the rmt approach to two - colour two - photon ionization of he , and present the associated anisotropy parameters .",
    "we briefly investigate how these parameters depend on the theoretical description of he .",
    "we compare the obtained parameters to those obtained experimentally as well as the predictions from the spa .",
    "the r - matrix including time ( rmt ) approach is a new _ ab initio _ method to solve accurately the time dependent schrdinger equation ( tdse ) for multi - electron atoms in intense laser light @xcite .",
    "the approach adopts the standard r - matrix approach @xcite of splitting configuration space into two distinct regions : an inner region and an outer region . in the inner region ,",
    "all @xmath1 electrons in the system are contained within a sphere of radius @xmath2 around the nucleus of the atom .",
    "@xmath3 therefore indicates the number of electrons left on the ion after a single electron has been ejected . in the outer region @xmath3",
    "electrons still remain within the sphere of radius @xmath2 , but one of the electrons has now left the sphere , so that its radial distance from the nucleus , @xmath4 , is larger than @xmath2 .    in the inner region ,",
    "a standard r - matrix basis expansion is used to describe the wave function @xcite . in this expansion ,",
    "states of the system under investigation are described in terms of antisymmetrised direct products of residual - ion states with a full continuum basis for the outgoing electron .",
    "additional correlation orbitals can be included to improve the description of the system .",
    "all interactions are accounted for in the hamiltonian , including electron exchange and correlation effects between all pairs of electrons . in the outer region ,",
    "the wavefunction is described in terms of a direct product of residual - ion states , coupled with the spin and angular momentum of the outgoing electron , with the radial wavefunction for the outgoing electron .",
    "since the outer electron is separated from the other electrons , its wavefunction can be treated separately from the others , and hence exchange effects can be neglected . in the rmt method ,",
    "the radial wavefunction for the outer electron is described in terms of a finite difference grid , similar to the approach pursued in the helium codes @xcite .",
    "this is the first difference compared to the tdrm approach @xcite , in which the wave function was described in terms of a very dense set of b - spline functions .    in sections [ sec : outer ] and [ sec :",
    "inner ] , we give a brief overview of the theory underpinning the rmt approach . a full description of the approach is given in @xcite . to obtain the properties of the system under investigation , we start with the time - dependent schrdinger equation ( tdse ) , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the full hamiltonian for the system , given by : @xmath7 in this equation @xmath8 and @xmath9 , with @xmath10 and @xmath11 the position and spin vectors of the @xmath12 electron , respectively .",
    "@xmath13 indicates the nuclear charge and @xmath14 is the electric field of the light pulse .",
    "furthermore , @xmath15 .",
    "the nucleus has been taken at the origin of the coordinate system .      in the outer region",
    "the @xmath16-electron wavefunction is expanded as follows @xcite : @xmath17 where _",
    "@xmath18 _ is the radial distance of the @xmath19 electron .",
    "the channel functions @xmath20 are formed by coupling relevant states of the residual @xmath3-electron ionic system @xmath21 with angular and spin components of the ejected - electron wavefunction . the functions _",
    "@xmath22 _ describe the radial wavefunction of the outer electron in the @xmath23 channel .    by left - projecting the tdse ( [ eq : tdse ] ) onto the channel functions @xmath20 , and integrating over all spatial and spin",
    "coordinates except @xmath24 , equation ( [ eq : tdse ] ) can be rewritten in terms of a set of coupled partial differential equations for @xmath22 @xcite : @xmath25f_{p'}(r , t ) , \\label{equation2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 describes the energy of the residual - ion state , the kinetic energy , the screened nuclear attraction and centrifugal repulsion for the outer electron , @xmath27 the other terms in equation ( [ equation2 ] ) describe the coupling between the different channels .",
    "@xmath28 describes the coupling due to long - range repulsion terms arising from the residual electrons , excluding the screening term , @xmath29 @xmath30 describes the coupling due to interaction between the light field and the residual - ion states , @xmath31 finally , @xmath32 describes the coupling due to interaction between the light field and the outer electron , @xmath33     and the outer region boundary is at @xmath34 . ,",
    "width=302 ]    equation ( [ equation2 ] ) describes a system of equations , which can be solved efficiently using finite - difference techniques @xcite .",
    "the radial wavefunction for the outer electron , @xmath22 , is discretised on a radial grid as shown in figure [ fig : rmt_partition ] .",
    "the potential - energy terms and the angular - momentum repulsion term can be determined directly at each grid point for each channel . the second derivative term in the kinetic energy operator",
    "is implemented using a five - point finite - difference rule . near the boundary with the inner region ,",
    "wavefunction information from the inner region is required .",
    "we therefore extend the finite difference grid into the inner region by @xmath35 points , where @xmath36 is the order of the arnoldi propagator . following the determination of the inner - region field - free eigenstates , we project these inner - region eigenstates onto the channel functions . using the time - dependent coefficients",
    "@xmath37 associated with the field - free inner - region eigenstates ( see section [ sec : inner ] ) , we can evaluate the time - dependent inner - region wavefunction on the finite - difference grid extension into the inner region ( eg . the points @xmath38 and @xmath39 in figure [ fig : rmt_partition ] ) .",
    "once the wavefunction is known on these points , all required orders of the kinetic energy operator can be evaluated accurately in the outer region . to propagate the outer region wavefunction in time from @xmath40 to @xmath41",
    "we employ the arnoldi propagator @xcite .",
    "the most demanding part in the solution of equation ( [ equation2 ] ) in the present approach is the evaluation of the right - hand side .",
    "this is effectively a matrix - vector multiplication , where the matrix will be sparse due to the angular - momentum constraints on the individual matrix elements . on the other hand , solution of the outer - region equations in the tdrm approach requires the ( computationally demanding ) determination of time - dependent green s functions across the entire outer region @xcite .",
    "in addition , the tdrm approach determines the updated wavefunction through an r - matrix propagation scheme , which can not be carried out in parallel . in the rmt approach",
    ", the updated wavefunction is obtained through a purely local computational scheme , and can therefore be parallelised over very large numbers of cores . as a consequence ,",
    "the rmt codes are substantially faster than the tdrm codes , especially for large - scale problems .",
    "the time dependent @xmath16-electron wavefunction in the inner region @xmath42 is expanded over field - free eigenstates of the hamiltonian in the inner region @xmath43 as follows @xcite : @xmath44 where all @xmath45 and the @xmath46 are the time - dependent expansion coefficients associated with the field - free eigenstates .",
    "the tdse in the inner region is given by : @xmath47 where the time - dependent hamiltonian is the same as given in expression ( [ eq : ham ] ) .",
    "however , in the inner region , the hamiltonian @xmath48 can not be hermitian .",
    "ionization requires an electron to escape to infinity , and for this to occur , some part of the wavefunction must have left the inner region .",
    "hence the total population in the inner region can not be conserved .",
    "the non - hermiticity arises in the evaluation of the kinetic energy operator at the boundary . in the determination of the field - free inner - region eigenstates ,",
    "however , this non - hermiticity is compensated for through the addition of a bloch operator @xcite , @xmath49 where the value of @xmath50 can , in principle , be chosen freely .    to propagate the inner - region wavefunction in time using the correct time - dependent hamiltonian",
    ", we therefore have to remove the bloch operator @xcite : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the inner - region hamiltonian including the bloch operator .",
    "however , since the bloch operator only acts on the wavefunction at the boundary , we can apply the bloch operator upon the outer - region wavefunction instead of the inner - region wavefunction : @xmath53 we now expand the inner - region wavefunction in terms of the field - free eigenstates @xmath54 , and project the inner region tdse ( [ equation17 ] ) onto these eigenstates .",
    "this projection then provides a set of equations for the time evolution of the coefficients @xmath46 : @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the time - dependent hamiltonian matrix element between field - free states @xmath57 and @xmath58 , and @xmath59 are the surface amplitudes of eigenstate @xmath57 with respect to outer region channel @xmath60 @xcite .    using the approximation that the time - dependent hamiltonian is constant within the time interval @xmath61 $ ]",
    ", we can now obtain an approximate solution to the inner - region tdse ( [ eq : tdinner ] ) in terms of the so - called @xmath62 functions @xcite . in matrix notation @xcite ,",
    "@xmath63 where @xmath64 with @xmath65 the @xmath66 functions can be regarded as  shifted \" exponentiation functions , as can be appreciated through their taylor series @xcite , @xmath67    for the propagation of the inner region wavefunction , we again use an arnoldi method @xcite .",
    "however , we now need separate propagators to evaluate each of the @xmath62-functions as well as the @xmath68 term .",
    "thus each of the @xmath69 terms in equation ( [ eq : innerprop ] ) is propagated separately , and the final wavefunction at time @xmath70 is obtained by combining all terms .",
    "our interest focuses on the anisotropy parameters in two - colour photoionization of he and the amount of atomic structure included in the theoretical description .",
    "hence we describe the he atom using three different basis expansions .",
    "these basis expansions can be characterised by the residual he@xmath0-ion states retained in the calculations .",
    "the he basis is built by combining these residual ion states with a complete set of continuum and bound - state functions for a single outgoing electron .",
    "the simplest basis expansion included employs only the 1s state of he@xmath0 as a residual - ion state .",
    "hence the he basis contains all 1s@xmath71 states . the second basis set we employed including the 1s , 2s and 2p states of he@xmath72 as residual - ion states , so that the he basis contains all 1s@xmath71 , 2s@xmath71 and 2p@xmath71 states . for the third basis",
    "set , we use pseudo - orbitals , @xmath73 and @xmath74 , as residual - ion states rather than the physical 2s and 2p orbitals . these pseudo - orbitals are constructed as sturmian - type orbitals @xmath75 with the same exponential decay as the 1s orbital , minimal power of the polynomial term , and orthogonality with respect to the 1s orbital .",
    "these basis sets are similar to the ones employed in the investigation of the choice of gauge for the laser field for time - dependent r - matrix theory @xcite .",
    "rmt calculations require a choice for the maximum angular momentum to be included within the calculations .",
    "the calculations using the 1s residual - ion state only were performed with 3 different values for the maximum angular momentum , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 , with the last two calculations producing very similar results .",
    "we therefore report results for all three basis sets investigated using a maximum angular momentum @xmath77 .    in the generation of the he basis , we have used an r - matrix inner region radius of 20 a@xmath79 .",
    "this inner region is sufficiently large to contain the he ground state .",
    "the basis used for the description of the continuum electron within the inner electron contains 70 b - splines with order _ k _ = 11 .",
    "the knot point distribution varies from a nearly quadratic spacing near the nucleus to a nearly linear spacing near the inner region boundary .",
    "additional knot points are inserted further inward to improve the description of functions close to the nucleus .",
    "the outer region radial wavefunction for the ejected electron is described on a finite difference grid extending to 1200 a.u . with a grid spacing @xmath80 = 0.075 a@xmath79 .",
    "the time step in the propagation is set to @xmath81 = 0.005 a.u .",

    "we investigate ionization of helium irradiated by a combination of two laser pulses : an euv pulse corresponding to the @xmath82 @xmath83 @xmath84 harmonic of the fundamental laser field and an overlapping fundamental dressing field .",
    "the wavelength of the fundamental field ranges from 790  @xmath83  810 nm and were chosen closely to resemble those used in the experiment @xcite .",
    "the ir laser field considered is linearly polarized in the _",
    "z_-direction with an intensity of @xmath85@xmath86 w @xmath87 at peak .",
    "the ir pulse profile is given by a 3-cycle @xmath88 ramp on , followed by 2 cycles at a peak intensity and a 3-cycle @xmath88 ramp off ( 3 - 2 - 3 ) .",

    "in this report , we investigate the asymmetry parameters of two - colour two - photon ionization of he irradiated by a combination of a short euv pulse and a short ir pulse using the rmt approach .",
    "these parameters can be obtained from the final - time wavefunction obtained at the end of the calculations .",
    "this wavefunction is described in terms of total angular momentum , whereas the experimental observations relate primarily to the ejected electron . in order to compare the results from our investigations to experiment",
    ", we therefore first have to decouple the wavefunction of the outer electron and the wavefunction of the residual ion states using clebsch - gordan coefficients @xcite . following this decoupling",
    ", we can construct the spatial wavefunction for the outgoing electron .",
    "this spatial wavefunction is then transformed into a momentum distribution for the outgoing electron under the assumption that the coulomb potential of the residual ion can be neglected .",
    "plane for helium irradiated by an ir field with wavelength of 790 nm and its 17@xmath92 harmonic.,width=302 ]    figure [ fig : momdist ] shows the ejected - electron momentum distribution of the ejected electron in the @xmath93-plane for the case that he is irradiated by an ir laser field with a wavelength of 790 nm and an euv field given by the 17@xmath94 harmonic of the ir field .",
    "the ir field is relatively weak , and we therefore show the momentum distribution on a logarithmic scale .",
    "the photoionization spectrum is dominated by the central euv photoionization peak at @xmath95 atomic units .",
    "since the central peak is given by a @xmath60 outgoing electron , a node is clearly visible at @xmath96 for this central peak .",
    "the sidebands generated by absorption or emission of an additional ir photon can also be identified easily in figure [ fig : momdist ] .",
    "as will be illustrated later in more detail , these sidebands show no node at @xmath96 .",
    "the relative magnitudes between the central euv peak and the sidebands can be better assessed in figure [ fig : photoe ] , which shows the photoelectron momentum spectra along the laser polarization axis for a 790-nm ir field and its 17@xmath94 harmonic .",
    "the figure shows that for the present laser parameters ( short ir pulse , weak intensity ) , the photoelectron momentum spectrum is dominated by the central photoemission peak , whereas the sidebands are significantly weaker in intensity .",
    "two sidebands can be seen immediately by the side of the main euv photoelectron peak .",
    "these peaks originate from the pulse shape of the euv laser pulse , which introduces additional frequency components .",
    "the sidebands associated with absorption or emission of an additional ir photon are well separated from the main euv peak , and we can thus easily obtain a total intensity for each of the sidebands at a given emission angle by integration over the sideband .",
    "harmonic along the polarization axis of the two laser fields .",
    "the momentum spectrum shows that , for an eight - cycle ir - pulse with peak intensity of @xmath97 w/@xmath98 , the spectrum is dominated by the central euv peak .",
    "two further sidebands can be seen directly by the side of the euv pulse .",
    "these originate from the euv pulse shape .",
    ", width=302 ]    the asymmetry parameters for the two - colour two - photon ionization process describe the variation of the sideband intensity with emission angle , relative to the laser polarization axis , @xmath99 .",
    "figure [ fig : angle ] shows the variation of the integrated sideband intensity with @xmath100 for the case of a 790-nm ir field and its 17@xmath94 harmonic .",
    "the figure demonstrates that the positive sideband ( absorption of an ir photon ) and the negative sideband ( emission of an ir photon ) show significant differences . this difference between positive and negative sidebands , and hence differences in the asymmetry parameters ,",
    "has already been observed before in studies of ar @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : angle ] shows that the angular distribution for the higher sideband is more peaked along the laser polarization axis , whereas the negative sideband shows a more constant behaviour as a function of angle .",
    "this difference between positive and negative sideband is not too unexpected .",
    "the present choice of laser parameters means that the lower sideband corresponds to emission of electrons with an energy of only 0.8 ev , less than the ir photon energy . at this small energy ,",
    "interactions with the residual ion can become important .",
    "furthermore , the centrifugal repulsion potential can significantly affect the angular distribution . whereas @xmath101 electrons do not see this repulsive potential , @xmath102 electrons do .",
    "the classical turning point for a @xmath102 electron with an energy corresponding to the negative sideband is about 2.8 @xmath103 , whereas it is about 1.8 @xmath103 at an energy corresponding to the positive sideband .",
    "hence , the overlap between the @xmath102 continuum and the he ground state will be significantly greater for the higher sideband than for the lower sideband .",
    "the emission in the lower sideband should then be more isotropic than the emission in the higher sideband .",
    "once we have obtained the angular distributions associated with the sidebands , we can use them to derive the anisotropy parameters .",
    "it is also possible to derive the anisotropy parameters using a perturbative approach , in which one can derive the anisotropy parameters from the magnitude and relative phase between the excitation of the @xmath101 and the @xmath102 continuum . in the present time - dependent calculation , we have chosen not to use the latter method , as @xmath104 and @xmath105 channels are also populated during the calculations . since these channels can receive population , they should be included in the determination of the anisotropy parameters .",
    "we also include possible contributions from @xmath60 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 and 7 channels , even though , for long weak pulses , they do not contribute to two - photon ionization .     for he irradiated by the 17@xmath92 harmonic and overlapping fundamental of the 790 nm pulse.,width=302 ]    the photoelectron angular distributions for two - photon ionization",

    "we can thus obtain these parameters by fitting this formula to the theoretical angular distribution .",
    "for the data in figure [ fig : angle ] , this gives anisotropy parameters of @xmath112 and @xmath113 for the negative sideband , and @xmath114 and @xmath115 for the positive sideband .",
    "[ cols=\"^,<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in the recent experimental investigation of the anisotropy parameters @xcite , six combinations of ir wavelength and associated harmonic were investigated . for an ir wavelength of 790 nm , and an euv pulse given by its 17@xmath94 harmonic , anisotropy parameters of @xmath116 and @xmath117",
    "were obtained for the negative sideband , and anisotropy parameters of @xmath118 and @xmath119 were obtained for the positive sideband . although the theoretical calculations lie slightly outside the experimental error bars for @xmath120 for the negative sideband and @xmath121 for the positive sideband , the overall agreement for this choice of laser wavelengths is very good .",
    "a more detailed comparison of the theoretical and experimental anisotropy parameters is given in table [ tab : aniso ] , where anisotropy parameters are presented for all combinations reported experimentally .",
    "for the case discussed above , an ir wavelength of 790 nm , and an euv pulse given by its 17@xmath94 harmonic , we also show in table [ tab : aniso ] , a comparison of the anisotropy parameters obtained using the different he basis sets .",
    "the table shows that the differences in the anisotropy parameters with respect to basis size are minimal in the present calculations , with a change of 0.01 in @xmath120 for the negative sideband .",
    "this level of change is typical : the largest difference is seen for case a , where @xmath120 for the negative sideband increases to 1.45 when only the 1s state of he@xmath0 is included .",
    "the changes between the different basis sets lie thus within the experimental uncertainty .",
    "we have therefore chosen to present results only for the case where the he basis is constructed using the he@xmath0 1s , @xmath122 and @xmath123 residual - ion states .",
    "the anisotropy parameters calculated using the rmt method , shown in table [ tab : aniso ] , are noticeably smaller in magnitude for the negative sideband than for the positive sideband .",
    "@xmath124 is very similar in all cases studied , with a value very close to 3 .",
    "@xmath125 shows greater variation : it increases with increasing photon energy of the harmonic .",
    "the negative sideband straddles the ionization threshold at a wavelength of 810 nm . just above the ionization threshold ,",
    "ionization will be dominated by @xmath101 electrons , and therefore the closer the negative sideband gets to the ionization threshold , the emission process should become more and more isotropic .",
    "however , it may be difficult to obtain accurate anisotropy parameters very close to threshold in the present calculations , as the wavefunction may need to be propagated for long times to separate population in high rydberg states from population in the low - energy continuum .",
    "the @xmath126 parameters show variation in both cases : we find a relatively small decrease in @xmath127 with increasing euv energy , whereas the @xmath128 shows a steady increase .",
    "we can compare our anisotropy parameters with predictions using the soft photon approximation ( spa ) @xcite . in this approximation",
    ", it is assumed that the absorption of the ir photon does not significantly affect the energy of the outgoing electron .",
    "this approximation may not work well for the 17@xmath94 harmonic due to its proximity to the ionization threshold , but the approximation should be more appropriate for higher harmonics . if it is assumed that the ir intensity is weak , then simple analytic expressions can be derived for the anisotropy parameters , in terms of the single - photon anisotropy parameter , estimated at the energy of the sideband @xcite : @xmath129 for single - photon ionization of the he ground - state to just above the he@xmath0 1s threshold , only @xmath60 electrons can be ejected , and therefore the parameter @xmath130 at all photon energies considered here .",
    "substitution of this value into the spa estimates for the anisotropy parameters gives the following values , @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",

    "table [ tab : aniso ] also provides a comparison of the experimentally obtained anisotropy parameters with the present ones .",

    "reasonably good agreement is obtained for all cases involving the 17@xmath94 harmonic , but the differences become pronounced for the cases involving the 19@xmath94 and 21@xmath135 harmonic .",
    "the origin of the differences between the experimental results and theory is unclear .",
    "the @xmath121 parameters can be related directly to the relative magnitude between the emission of a @xmath102 electron and emission of an @xmath101 electron @xcite .",
    "the present results , in particular those for the negative sideband , are consistent with a picture in which the emission of @xmath102 electron is reduced when one approaches the ionization threshold .",
    "extrapolation of the numerical results to higher photon energy gives anisotropy parameters consistent with the predictions of the spa .",
    "on the other hand , the present calculations use very clean laser pulses for both the ir and the euv pulse .",
    "it is unrealistic to expect such a clean pulse for the euv pulse experimentally , as it is obtained through harmonic generation .",
    "these differences in laser parameters may well be the root origin for the differences seen between theory and experiment .",

    "the negative sidebands tend to be more isotropic than the positive sidebands .",
    "the obtained anisotropy parameters differ noticeably from the predictions of the spa due to the proximity of the euv photon energy to the ionization threshold . for increasing euv photon energy ,",
    "the anisotropy parameters move closer to the predictions of the spa .",
    "the agreement with experiment is good for the case of an ir pulse with a wavelength of 790 nm and an euv pulse given by its 17@xmath94 harmonic , but notable differences are seen for other combinations of laser pulse .",
    "the rmt approach has been developed recently for the investigation of atomic processes in intense ultra - short light fields .",
    "the present calculations demonstrate that the approach can be used to obtain photoelectron distributions . in the present study",
    ", we compare these distributions for the case that the ir field is weak , but the approach should also be capable of treating more intense ir fields . in these cases , the sideband structure becomes significantly more complicated @xcite , and it would be interesting to see how the approach compares to , for example , the spa when more ir photons are absorbed by the ejected electron . whereas calculations at low ir intensity can be carried out using either the tdrm or rmt approach , at high ir intensities , the rmt approach would be strongly preferred , as the rmt approach is more suitable for large - scale parallelisation .",
    "this increase in parallelisation scale becomes particularly important when many angular momenta need to be included in the calculations .",
    "this research has been supported by the european commission marie curie initial training network corinf and by the uk engineering and physical sciences research council under grant no .",
