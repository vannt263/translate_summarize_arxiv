    "a theory of poisson manifolds gives us a possibility to construct an interesting field theory ( classical ) .",
    "it was first introduced by peter schaller and thomas strobl in 1994 in @xcite .",
    "it turned out that this theory included limit cases of the well - known models , such as two - dimensional yang - mills model or @xmath0 gravity model .",
    "the basic idea is to use a poisson manifold as a target , instead of a riemannian manifold",
    ".    we will in detail review the definition of poisson sigma model fields , using the formalism of fibre bundles .",
    "this is in great detail discussed in @xcite .",
    "after the necessary introduction of involved objects , we will proceed and give a definition of a globally defined action integral of the model .",
    "usually ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite or @xcite ) the equations of motion are derived using the lagrange formalism of the classical field theory . in subsection [ sec_psmvar ]",
    "we will derive the equations of motion starting once again from the variational principle , after giving a geometric sense to the variation of the fields .    in subsection [ sec_psmlinear ]",
    "we show one of the simplest non - trivial examples of a poisson manifold - linear poisson structure .",
    "we work out ( as was already done by many others , see e.g. @xcite ) an intrinsic form of the equations of motion using the involved lie algebra structures .",
    "we intend this as an important but simple example , where the `` zero curvature '' equation for the field of poisson sigma model appears .",
    "poisson - lie groups constitute a natural combination of poisson structures with the theory of lie groups .",
    "the poisson bivector of poisson - lie group is then a multiplicative bivector field , allowing the computation of its intrinsic derivative .",
    "this intrinsic derivative is in fact a lie bialgebra structure , @xmath1-cocycle of particular lie algebra cohomology .",
    "more interestingly , for given lie bialgebra there exists a unique poisson bivector on a corresponding lie group , so that this lie bialgebra is its intrinsic derivative @xcite . for coboundary lie bialgebras there exists a well known explicit formula for the poisson bivector , called sklyanin bracket ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , there exists a procedure for a general lie bialgebra , not so widely known at the moment .",
    "this is why we present it in the subsection [ sec_construction ] , not going into details .",
    "the key element is the equivalent description of lie bialgebra - manin triple , lie algebra with distinguished lie subalgebras and a non - degenerate bilinear ad - invariant symmetric form .",
    "corresponding ( connected ) lie group , called drinfeld double , allows us to define ( mutually dual ) poisson - lie group structures on its lie subgroups .    in section [ sec_psm ] we will in detail discuss the case , where the target poisson manifold of the model is moreover a poisson - lie group .",
    "we call such models a poisson - lie sigma models . with the help of globally",
    "valid equations of motion ( with no restrictions on the range of the fields at all ) derived in subsection [ sec_psmvar ] , we can use global frame fields of lie group , right - invariant vector fields , to derive a intrinsic ( coordinate - free ) form of equations of motion for poisson - lie sigma model .",
    "most interestingly , we again get a `` zero curvature '' form of equation for the fields of the model .",
    "this result can be reproduced using the language of lie algebroid morphisms , which was described in @xcite .    in the final subsection",
    "we give a simple example of non - linear @xmath2-dimensional poisson - lie sigma model with non - coboundary lie bialgebra , using the construction of poisson - lie group structure on drinfeld double .",
    "the aim of this section is to introduce the elements and notation of the poisson geometry .",
    "its central point lies in the study of poisson manifolds - differentiable manifolds equipped with a poisson bracket .",
    "the convenient way to describe such structures is the language of multivector fields , completely skew - symmetric contravariant tensor fields on manifolds .",
    "this is why we have included a brief introduction to multivector fields .",
    "let @xmath3 be a differentiable manifold of dimension @xmath4 .",
    "we denote @xmath5 the space of @xmath6-times contravariant tensor fields on @xmath3 and @xmath7 its subspace of completely skew - symmetric tensor fields .",
    "we define the * multivector field algebra * as a direct sum @xmath8 equipped with the exterior product @xmath9 , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 for @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "multivectors lying in the particular @xmath7 subspace are called * homogeneous*. the * grade * of a homogeneous non - zero element @xmath14 of some @xmath7 is defined as @xmath6 and denoted @xmath15 .    the elements of @xmath7 in the form of @xmath16 , are called * simple*.    * schouten - nijenhuis bracket * @xmath17 : l(m ) \\times l(m ) \\rightarrow l(m)$ ] is the @xmath18-bilinear mapping defined on homogeneous simple elements of @xmath19 as @xmath20 : = \\ ] ] @xmath21 \\^ x_1 \\^ \\cdot \\cdot \\^ \\widehat{x_i } \\^ \\cdot \\cdot \\^ x_n \\^ y_1 \\^ \\cdot \\cdot \\^ \\widehat{y_j } \\^ \\cdot \\cdot \\^ y_m},\\ ] ] where @xmath22 denotes the omission of the vector field in the product and @xmath23 $ ] is an ordinary commutator of the vector fields . for @xmath24 and homogeneous @xmath25 the schouten - nijenhuis bracket is defined as @xmath26 : = -\\mathit{i}_{df}{x},\\ ] ] @xmath27 : = ( -1)^{(|x|+1)}\\mathit{i}_{df}{x},\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is the common interior product operator ( insertion operator ) .",
    "it is obvious that the schouten - nijenhuis bracket of two multivector fields is again a multivector field , it is just the sum of exterior products of vector fields on @xmath3 . during a study of the classical hamiltonian mechanics there naturally arises an interesting geometric structure , a poisson bracket of two observable quantities ( functions on a phase space ) .",
    "we define poisson bracket on an arbitrary differentiable manifold @xmath3 .",
    "differentiable manifold @xmath3 is called a * poisson manifold * if it is equipped by an additional structure @xmath29 called a * poisson bracket * , which is a bilinear map @xmath30 having the following properties : @xmath31 @xmath32 @xmath33 in the other words , @xmath34 adds on @xmath35 the lie algebra structure and for every @xmath36 the map @xmath37 lies in @xmath38 .",
    "the poisson bracket on @xmath3 can be easily encoded into the special bivector field @xmath39 on @xmath3 , called ( not surprisingly ) a poisson bivector on @xmath3 .",
    "the skew - symmetry of the poisson bracket will lead onto a skew - symmetry of @xmath39 ( this is why we talk about a bivector field ) .",
    "the leibniz rule ( [ pb_derivation ] ) will be satisfied `` for free '' by every bivector field @xmath39 .",
    "the only problem arises with the jacobi identity for the poisson bracket .",
    "it turns out that it can be encoded into the words of schouten - nijenhuis bracket , which we have canonically defined on every manifold @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath3 be a differentiable manifold .",
    "every poisson bracket @xmath34 on @xmath3 corresponds to the unique bivector field @xmath40 , such that @xmath41 = 0.\\ ] ] conversely , every bivector @xmath40 satisfying ( [ pt_schoutenvanish ] ) can be used to define a poisson bracket on @xmath3 .",
    "the bivector field @xmath39 is called a * poisson bivector ( field ) * on @xmath3 .      for definition of dynamical variables of poisson sigma models we shall need the concept of the vector bundle map .",
    "for this reason we will bring in a few definitions essential for the proper setting . we do not intend to go in details , there exists a plenty of classical literature on this topic .",
    "let us denote differential fibre bundle as @xmath42 and the set of all its smooth sections as @xmath43 .",
    "the subset of global smooth sections is denoted as @xmath44 .",
    "let @xmath42 , @xmath45 be two fibre bundles .",
    "a pair @xmath46 is called the * bundle map * , if :    1 .",
    "@xmath47 is a smooth map of the base manifolds .",
    "2 .   @xmath48 is a smooth map of the total spaces .",
    "following diagram commutes : @xmath49    if @xmath50 and @xmath51 are vector bundles , we call @xmath52 the * vector bundle map * , if @xmath46 is a bundle map and @xmath48 is linear `` in the fibres '' , i.e. : @xmath53    ( see e.g. @xcite ) let @xmath54 and @xmath3 be differentiable manifolds and @xmath55 be a fibre bundle with the typical fibre @xmath56 .",
    "let @xmath57 be a smooth map .",
    "then we can induce a fibre bundle structure above @xmath54 , called the * pullback bundle * , as follows :    its total space @xmath58 is defined as @xmath59 its base manifold is @xmath54 , projection is @xmath60 and typical fibre @xmath56 remains the same .",
    "it is clear that the fibre @xmath61 at @xmath62 is just the same , as the fibre @xmath63 of the original bundle .",
    "let us suppose we have a @xmath2-dimensional differentiable orientable manifold @xmath64 , called usually the * worldsheet*. let us remark that in general we do not demand a ( pseudo-)metric structure on @xmath64 .",
    "we usually take @xmath65 ( empty boundary ) and we want @xmath64 to be such manifold , where integration and the stokes theorem have a good sense .",
    "otherwise we have to impose some ( boundary ) conditions on the fields .",
    "next suppose an @xmath4-dimensional poisson manifold @xmath66 .",
    "again we do not demand @xmath3 to be a ( pseudo-)riemannian manifold .",
    "the manifold @xmath3 is called a * target manifold*.    * dynamical field of poisson sigma model * is a vector bundle map @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the tangent bundle of @xmath64 and @xmath69 is the cotangent bundle of @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath70 is a smooth map of the base manifolds , whereas @xmath71 is a smooth map of the total spaces .",
    "let @xmath42 be a vector bundle .",
    "its set of global smooth sections @xmath44 has a natural @xmath35-linear structure : @xmath72 in particular , we will use this property for the pullback bundle @xmath73 and the set @xmath74 .",
    "a @xmath1-form @xmath75 on @xmath64 with values in the set of global smooth sections @xmath74 is a smooth assignment @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is a linear map .",
    "@xmath78 denotes the projection of the pullback bundle @xmath73 .",
    "we define the action of @xmath75 on a smooth vector field @xmath79 as @xmath80 for every @xmath81 , where @xmath82 denotes the value of @xmath83 at @xmath84 .",
    "@xmath85 can be thus interpreted as the global section of the pullback bundle @xmath73 .",
    "the requirement of the smooth assignment can be then more precisely stated as the smoothness of the section @xmath85 .",
    "therefore @xmath75 defines a @xmath86-linear map from @xmath87 to @xmath74 .    in the same way we can define a @xmath6-form on @xmath64 with values in @xmath74 and a @xmath6-form on @xmath64 with values in @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the pullback bundle of @xmath90 by @xmath14 .",
    "previous definition can be equivalently stated as follows : @xmath1-form @xmath75 on @xmath64 with values in @xmath74 is a @xmath86-linear map from @xmath87 to @xmath74 .",
    "the reason and proof is similar to the same statement for ordinary @xmath1-forms @xmath91 .",

    "we can define @xmath98 as @xmath99 where @xmath79 is a smooth vector field .",
    "@xmath100 thus indeed maps linearly vectors from @xmath101 to @xmath102 .",
    "> from the smoothness of @xmath83 and of the map @xmath96 follows , that the resulting section @xmath103 is smooth .",
    "hence @xmath98 .    conversely , let @xmath104 .",
    "then for @xmath105 we define the map @xmath106 as @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the projection of the tangent bundle @xmath68 .",
    "the map @xmath106 clearly satisfies the condition @xmath109 where @xmath110 denotes the projection of the cotangent bundle @xmath69 and it is linear in the fibres .",
    "the smoothness of @xmath106 follows from the smoothness of @xmath75 and the projection @xmath108 .",
    "hence @xmath111 is a vector bundle map .    since now we will not distinguish between @xmath96 and @xmath112 , and we will use the notation @xmath113 for @xmath81 .    let @xmath114 be a set of local coordinates on @xmath3 .",
