    "in a previous paper  @xcite , we obtained diffractive parton densities by fitting diffractive deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) and photoproduction data from hera , and then we used these to predict diffractive production of @xmath0 s and dijets at the tevatron .",
    "the underlying principle behind these calculations was the notion of hard scattering factorization , a property which we aimed to test .",
    "a factorization theorem has been proven @xcite for diffractive dis and direct photoproduction processes .",
    "the proof establishes the universality of diffractive parton densities for the class of processes to which the theorem applies .",
    "this means that one may extract the parton densities from a subset of data , and then , using these same densities , reliably predict other diffractive dis and direct photoproduction distributions .",
    "the results of our work in @xcite are consistent with this theorem .    in contrast",
    ", no factorization theorem has been established for diffractive hadron - hadron processes , and in fact , there have been several arguments put forward in favor of nonfactorization @xcite in this case .",
    "again , our results in @xcite were consistent with this , when we compared our predictions for hadron - hadron processes to data .    in this paper",
    ", we seek to further extend our tests of factorization . using the same diffractive parton densities that we extracted in @xcite , we present calculations of cross sections for one process where factorization is predicted to be valid  diffractive heavy quark production from dis  and for two processes where",
    "factorization is predicted to fail  diffractive heavy quark production in @xmath1 interactions , and diffractive dijet production via double pomeron exchange .",
    "we will compare our predictions with preliminary data from hera @xcite and the tevatron @xcite .",
    "apart from the general desire to test hard - scattering factorization , a particular motivation for studying diffractive dis charm production is that we expect charm production to be a substantial fraction of the diffractive dis cross section .",
    "( recall that in inclusive dis , the charm structure function @xmath2 is @xmath3 of the inclusive @xmath4 . ) moreover , since open charm production is dominated by the photon - gluon fusion process , it also provides a good test of the normalization of the diffractive gluon density .",
    "a particular result of our work in @xcite was that the diffractive gluon density is much larger than the diffractive quark density .",
    "this was most strongly driven by the photoproduction data .",
    "the hadron - induced processes that we study in this paper are also highly sensitive to the diffractive gluon density .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : cs ] , we discuss the diffractive parton densities and cross section formulae that we will use in the calculations .",
    "our numerical results are then presented and discussed in relation to preliminary data in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "we then summarize our findings and give our conclusions in section [ sec : concl ] .",
    "since our goal is to test hard scattering factorization , we will use , in our calculations of the diffractive cross sections , the parton densities which we previously obtained @xcite from fits to diffractive dis and photoproduction data from zeus and h1 .",
    "similar fits were also obtained independently in @xcite , using only data from zeus .",
    "note that there have also been previous fits to diffractive dis data alone @xcite .    in @xcite , where we assumed that the diffractive parton densities can be adequately represented as a pomeron flux factor times parton densities in the pomeron",
    ", the fits are labeled a , b , c , d and sg . in",
    "fits a , b , c and d , the parton densities in the pomeron all have the form , @xmath5 , \\nonumber \\\\      \\beta f_{g/\\pomeron}(\\beta , q_{0 } )    & = &          a_g \\beta   ( 1-\\beta   ) , \\label{paramabcd}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] at an initial scale @xmath6 , but with different constraints on the parameters . for example , in parameterizations a and c we required that there be no gluons in the initial parton densities , i.e. , @xmath7 .",
    "the super - high - glue fit , sg , has the same form of quark density as in eq .",
    "( [ paramabcd ] ) but with a gluon density that is peaked near @xmath8 and is given by @xmath9 the appropriate pomeron flux factor to use with the above parton densities is one due to donnachie and landshoff @xcite : @xmath10^{2}x_{\\pomeron}^{1 - 2\\alpha ( t ) } , \\label{dlflux}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the proton mass , @xmath12 is the pomeron - quark coupling and @xmath13 is the pomeron trajectory .",
    "the explicit parameters for our fits are presented in table [ params ] .",
    "note that fits a and c have low gluon content ( i.e. , gluons are only produced via evolution ) while fits b , d and sg contain large amounts of initial gluons . in @xcite",
    ", we found that only the high - glue fits are able to fit the photoproduction data while the low - glue fits badly underestimate the same data .",
    "all five parameterizations are in reasonable agreement with the dis data , at least as regards normalization .",
    "our motivation for working with fits that do not in fact fit all the data is that the gluon distributions that are needed to provide good fits to photoproduction data are an order of magnitude above the quark distributions .",
    "this is quite unlike the usual inclusive parton densities in the proton .",
    "thus , a comparison of results obtained with the low - glue and high - glue fits should dramatically distinguish those processes that are particularly sensitive to the diffractive gluon density from those that are merely sensitive to the gluon densities in their finer details .",

    ". the next - to - leading order form of this function may be found in @xcite .",
    "the sum in eq .",
    "( [ hvqrkdis ] ) runs over all active parton flavors .",
    "the calculation that we have used is based on hvqdisv1.1 by b.  w.  harris and j.  smith @xcite which computes inclusive ( i.e. , without the diffractive requirement ) , fully differential heavy quark distributions in dis both to leading ( lo ) and next - to - leading order ( nlo ) .",
    "a peterson fragmentation routine is built - in and can be applied to the final state heavy quark four - vectors to simulate hadronization effects .",
    "we modified this calculation to compute diffractive cross sections using the diffractive parton densities obtained in @xcite .",
    "the cross sections for heavy quark pair @xmath33 production in @xmath34 collisions for the case when the @xmath35 diffracts are calculated using @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the proton parton distribution function , @xmath38 is the center of mass energy squared , @xmath39 is the heavy quark mass and @xmath40 is the partonic hard scattering function for heavy quark pair production .",
    "the analytic expressions for this function up to nlo are given in @xcite .",
    "it is useful to present the above cross section as a fraction of the inclusive cross section .",
    "thus , we will also compute the diffractive rate @xmath41 , where @xmath42      for the production of dijets via double pomeron exchange in @xmath34 collisions , we compute the cross section by using @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the partonic @xmath45 scattering function .",

    "we will also compute the ratio of the above double diffractive cross section to that for single diffraction @xmath46 .",
    "the latter , assuming the @xmath35 diffracts , is calculated with the formula @xmath47",
    "in computing the diffractive cross sections , we used the diffractive parton densities discussed in section [ sec : cs ] .",
    "these are evolved using full nlo qcd , via the cteq package @xcite , from the initial scale @xmath48 to the appropriate scale in the particular calculation .    for the calculations involving heavy quarks ,",
    "nlo hard scattering matrix elements @xcite were used together with a two - loop running coupling @xmath49 . to be consistent with the renormalization scheme used in @xcite , one needs to use the coupling @xmath49 which is valid for three and four flavors for charm @xmath50 and bottom @xmath51 production , respectively . at nlo",
    ", the matching condition between the 3- and 4-flavor couplings at @xmath52 is that the coupling is continuous , and similarly for the transition from 4 to 5 active flavors  see @xcite . for consistency in the calculations of @xmath53",
    ", we also used proton parton densities with the appropriate number of flavors @xcite in the fixed flavor scheme @xcite : cteq4f3 ( cteq4f4 ) for charm ( bottom ) production .      both the h1 @xcite and zeus @xcite collaborations have reported preliminary data on diffractive charm production in deep inelastic scattering of 27.5 gev positrons and 820 gev protons .",
    "they studied charm quark production , by tagging @xmath54 mesons through their decay , via the process @xmath55",
    "h1 has measured a preliminary cross section for diffractive @xmath54 production shown in the last column of table [ table : h1chrm ] .",
    "this is subject to the following cuts : @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the photon virtuality , @xmath62 is the fractional energy loss of the incident @xmath63 in the proton rest frame while @xmath64 are the transverse momentum and pseudorapidity , respectively , of the @xmath54 meson .",
    "these data include proton dissociation with masses up to @xmath65 .",
    "the nlo cross sections that we calculated with the same cuts are also given in table [ table : h1chrm ] .",
    "these values were obtained with peterson fragmentation switched on in the code with @xmath66 and the probability for the charm to fragment into a @xmath54 meson , @xmath67 , set equal to @xmath68 .",
    "the renormalization and factorization scales in eq .",
    "( [ hvqrkdis ] ) were both set to @xmath69 , where the mass of the charm quark , @xmath70 , is set equal to @xmath71 .",

    "our cross sections are about two and five times smaller than the central data value but within the errors .",
    "fit d , which provided our best fit to the dis and photoproduction cross sections , yields a diffractive charm cross section which is in best agreement with the data , being within 10% of the central value .",
    "for the same process , the cross section obtained by zeus , corrected for a @xmath74 double dissociation contribution , is given in the bottom row of table [ table : zschrm ] .",
    "the following experimental cuts apply for this measurement : @xmath75 , @xmath57 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 .",

    "we used the same fragmentation parameters and choice of scale as in the calculations for comparison with the h1 data .",
    "since the zeus data have an @xmath79 cut , it is not clear what limit to impose on @xmath80 .",
    "hence , we have chosen several different values , as shown .",
    "we find that if we use the cut @xmath81 , the predictions badly underestimate the data . using cuts of @xmath82 and @xmath83 ,",
    "the predictions obtained with the low - glue fits a and c are still one to two orders of magnitude smaller than the data .",
    "the predictions using the high - glue fits b , d and sg have better agreement , with those obtained from d being closest to the data .",
    "we make several remarks on the relative sizes of our predictions for this process .",
    "the cross sections derived with the low - glue fits ( a and c ) are from 16 to about 100 times smaller than those obtained from the high - glue fits b , d and sg .",
    "this large discrepancy is due to the fact that the production of heavy quarks in dis is dominated by the @xmath84 channel , with quark contributions entering only at next - to - leading order .",
    "with fits a and c , gluons are generated only via evolution of the parton densities .",
    "therefore , the predictions using fits a or c are suppressed by at least a factor of @xmath49 relative to those with the high - glue fits .",
    "furthermore , another factor of 10 suppression results from the quark coefficients in table [ params ] being an order of magnitude smaller than the gluon coefficients .    among the high - glue fits ,",
    "the cross section using sg is smallest .",
    "this indicates that , for this process , the bulk of the contribution comes from partons with momentum fractions @xmath85 that are moderately far from unity ; the gluon density of sg dominates that of b or d only in the region @xmath86 .",
    "the cross sections using fits b and d have about a factor of two difference .",
    "this is due to the gluon coefficient @xmath87 for d being about twice that for b and the dominance of gluon - induced scattering in this process .",
    "figure [ chrmdist.h1 ] shows our predicted differential cross sections using h1 cuts plotted as functions of @xmath0 ( the center - of - mass energy of the virtual photon - proton system ) , @xmath61 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "the same comments apply regarding the relative sizes of the predictions for each distribution as those made above .",
    "the plots strongly illustrate how well diffractive charm production in dis can determine the gluon density as evidenced by the large difference between the predictions using the realistic high - glue fits ( d , b and sg ) and the low - glue ones ( a and c ) .      at this time , there are no data available for comparison with our predictions although there is a preliminary report from cdf @xcite which quotes that `` @xmath91 of central @xmath92 are diffractively produced '' in @xmath34 interactions at @xmath93 .",
    "one may thus expect that data on diffractive heavy quark production will soon become available .",
    "it is useful , therefore , to make some predictions to study the differences between the diffractive parton densities .    for open heavy flavor @xmath94 production from @xmath34 interactions at @xmath95",
    ", we obtained the nlo diffractive cross sections ( assuming that only the @xmath35 diffracts ) shown in table [ table : hqtevhf ] .",
    "the corresponding rates , @xmath96 , are also shown in the same table .",
    "we used @xmath97 and @xmath98 for the charm and bottom quark masses , respectively , and set the scale @xmath29 in eqs .",

    "again , this is because most of the cross section for this process results from gluon - induced @xmath101  and  @xmath102 scattering .    from table [ table : hqtevhf ]",
    ", we see that for charm ( bottom ) production , the predicted diffractive cross sections using the high - glue fits are about 3% to 40% ( 1% to 20% ) of the inclusive cross section . the low - glue fits result in much smaller rates : 0.2% to 0.5% and 0.1% to 0.5% for charm and bottom production , respectively .",
    "cdf has preliminary data @xcite on double diffractive dijet production from @xmath34 interactions at @xmath95 which are characterized by central dijets bounded by rapidity gaps near the direction of each incoming hadron .",
    "they used a roman pot to trigger on the diffracting antiproton and tagged on rapidity gaps along the direction of the diffracting proton . the measured cross section @xcite for dijets with transverse energy @xmath103 and cuts of @xmath104 and @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is the fractional momentum lost by the diffracting hadron @xmath107 , is shown in the last column of table [ table : dpe ] .",
    "there also exist data on the double diffractive cross section @xmath108 expressed as a fraction of the single diffractive cross section @xmath109 .",
    "the fraction @xmath110 measured by cdf @xcite is shown in table [ table : dpe ] . in this case",
    ", the denominator @xmath109 is the cross section for production of dijets with @xmath111 and a cut @xmath104 ( obtained with a roman pot trigger on the diffracting antiproton ) .",
    "the cross sections @xmath108 and ratios @xmath110 that we obtain using the same cuts and the diffractive parton densities shown in section [ sec : cs ] are also presented in table [ table : dpe ] . in our calculations , we set the scale @xmath29 in eqs .",

    "however , as we have seen , these fits substantially underestimate diffractive photoproduction and diffractive charm production .",
    "with the realistic high - glue fits b , d and sg , the predictions badly overestimate the data , being one to two orders of magnitude larger .",
    "the relative sizes of the predicted cross sections in table [ table : dpe ] can be explained in the following way . as in the case of heavy quark production ,",
    "dijet production is dominated by gluon - induced scattering at the parton level . however , in this case , quarks do contribute at the leading order .",
    "even then , the cross sections using fits a and c are much smaller relative to those obtained with the fits b , d and sg than in the heavy quark case ( see tables [ table : h1chrm ] , [ table : zschrm ] and [ table : hqtevhf ] ) .",
    "the reason is that in the double pomeron exchange cross section , there is an extra factor of the gluon density for the second pomeron .",
    "fits a and c are then expected to produce smaller cross sections because they can only supply gluons for the hard scattering via evolution . similarly , the factor of four difference between the results for fits b and d is a consequence of fit d having about twice as much initial gluon as b.",
    "we have presented diffractive heavy quark and dijet cross sections calculated with the assumption of hard scattering factorization .",
    "diffractive parton densities that were fitted @xcite to dis and photoproduction data from hera were used in these calculations . in @xcite , our best fit to the data resulted in fit",
    "d.    we find that in the case of diffractive @xmath54 production , the predicted cross sections using the best - fit parton densities , fit d , also have the best agreement with the data .",
    "this strongly supports the notion of hard scattering factorization for diffractive lepton - hadron processes .    for heavy quark production from @xmath34 collisions and assuming only the @xmath35 diffracts , we obtained rates @xmath96 , using the high - glue fits , from 3% to 40% and 1% to 20% for open charm and bottom production , respectively .",
    "the rates obtained with the low - glue fits are less than 1% for either charm or bottom production",
    ". it will be interesting to see how well these figures compare when data from the tevatron become available .",
    "our results for diffractive dijet production at the tevatron indicate a breakdown of factorization for diffractive hadron - hadron processes .",
    "the predicted double pomeron exchange cross sections @xmath108 with the high - glue fits are factors of 10 - 100 times larger than data .",
    "similar results are obtained when comparing the ratio @xmath110 with data . only the low - glue fits , which do not fit diffractive photoproduction data at all , yield numbers that agree well with the data .",
