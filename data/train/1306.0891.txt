    "it is well known that several properties of galaxies depend on environment .",
    "pioneering work by @xcite shows that galaxy morphology depends on local galaxy density : late type galaxies prefer low density environments , while dense environments tend to be populated by early type galaxies .",
    "there is also a strong correlation between galaxy star formation rates ( sfrs ) and environment : galaxies in high density environments present a decrease in sfrs compared to field galaxies @xcite .",
    "the effect of local environment on galaxy colours has been studied by @xcite .",
    "this authors find that at @xmath4 faint galaxies show a clear increase in the fraction of red galaxy as the local density increases . on the other hand , bright galaxies , present a constant red galaxy fraction .",
    "there are several known processes that influence galaxy properties .",
    "the hot intra - cluster gas is the main responsible for stripping the gas of galaxies in the core of clusters .",
    "mechanisms such as ram - pressure stripping @xcite and the strangulation or starvation scenarios @xcite lead to a decrease in the star formation rate of cluster galaxies .",
    "tidal interactions of galaxy pairs and mergers affect the morphology of galaxies and can convert spiral galaxies into elliptical and s0s @xcite .",
    "these processes can also trigger star formation , depending on the gas reservoir of the galaxies @xcite . in the extremely dense environments of compact groups ,",
    "galaxies are separated only by a few galaxy radii from each other and with a low relative velocities , an ideal scenario for interactions and mergers @xcite .",
    "several studies have analysed the properties of galaxies in different systems , such as pairs , compact groups , groups with four or more members , and clusters .",
    "nevertheless , there are few works addressing the properties of galaxies in triple systems .",
    "@xcite performed _",
    "surface photometry of a sample of 54 galaxies selected from the catalogue of isolated triplets of galaxies in the nothern hemisphere @xcite and investigate the properties of 34 galaxies in 13 triplets .",
    "these authors found that these systems are spiral dominated and a fraction of 56% of the triplets present morphological signatures associated with interactions .",
    "they also found a fraction of 35% of bars , that can rise up to 66% in the late - type spirals , and a fraction of 20% of rings , hosted preferentially in late - type components .",
    "based on these results the authors suggest that triple systems are essentially different from hickson compact groups and more representative of the field .",
    "however , the results of this work are based mainly in observations of a low number of systems .",
    "for this reason , these authors also highlight the relevance of building a complete sample of local isolated triplet of galaxies , that allows a significant statistical analysis .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter paper i ) constructed a sample of isolated triplets of galaxies brighter than @xmath5 and complete up to @xmath6 from the data release 7 of sloan digital sky survey @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to analyse the properties of a sample of spectroscopic galaxies derived from this triplet catalogue and compare them with the properties of galaxies in different systems such as pairs , compact groups and clusters .",
    "the proximity and low relative velocities of galaxy members in triplets present an ideal scenario for galaxy interactions and mergers , placing these systems in a state of ongoing collapse .",
    "for these reason in this paper we will also investigate the properties of the system as a whole .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the triplet and galaxy system samples used in this work . in this section",
    "we also build control samples in order to avoid biases in the comparison of properties of galaxies in different systems . in section 3",
    "we analyse the specific star formation rate ( @xmath7 ) , the strength of the @xmath8  break , @xmath2 , which is an spectral indicator of the stellar population mean age , and ( @xmath3 ) colour index of galaxies in the different systems under analysis .",
    "we study all these properties as a function of the stellar mass content in order to avoid biases due to differences in this parameter . in section 4",
    ", we analyse de triplet as a system .",
    "we use bootstrap techniques in order to assess the probability that the configurations of galaxies in triple systems are correlated or , on the contrary , can be explained by a random sampling .",
    "we also investigate how the total stellar mass of the system affect the properties of galaxies in triplets and analyse global properties as total star formation rate and global ( @xmath3 ) colour index of the system as a whole .",
    "we also analyse the compactness of the triplets by defining a parameter s that is a measure of the percentage of the system total area that is filled by the light of member galaxies . in this section",
    "we also compare the properties of triple systems with the global properties of compact groups .",
    "finally in section 6 we discuss our main results .    throughout this paper",
    "we adopt a cosmological model characterised by the parameters @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "in this work we analyse several samples of galaxy systems derived from the data release 7 of sloan digital sky survey ( sdss - dr7 , * ? ? ?",
    "sdss @xcite has mapped more than one - quarter of the entire sky , performing photometry and spectroscopy for galaxies , quasars and stars .",

    "it comprises @xmath12 sq . deg . of imaging data , with an increment of @xmath13 sq .",
    ", over the previous data release , mostly in regions of low galactic latitude .",

    "the survey has spectroscopy over 9380 sq .",

    "i we analysed spectroscopic and photometric data extracted from sdss - dr7 in order to build a catalogue of isolated triplets of galaxies .",
    "the spectroscopic data were derived from the main galaxy sample ( mgs ; @xcite ) .",
    "k - corrections for this sample were calculated bandshifted to @xmath21 , using the software ` k - correct_v4.2 ` of @xcite .",
    "the photometric data were derived from the photometric catalogue constructed by @xcite , which contains photometric redshift and k - correction for the photometric data of the sdss - dr7 . for both data sets ,",
    "k - corrected absolute magnitudes were calculated from petrosian apparent magnitudes converted to the ab system .",
    "the final catalogue comprises 1092 isolated triplets of galaxies with absolute r - band magnitude brighter than @xmath5 in the redshift range @xmath22 .",
    "a full description of the algorithm developed to build this catalogue can be found in paper i.    one of the aims of this paper is to analyse different properties of galaxies in triplets by including information extracted from their spectra .",
    "for this reason we have considered only triple systems composed by three spectroscopic galaxies that are close in projected separation @xmath23 and with a radial velocity difference @xmath24 . due",
    "to completeness in the spectroscopy , we have restricted our analysis to the redshift range @xmath25 .    in order to select isolated systems , we implement two of the isolation criteria described in paper 1 :    1 .",

    "then we compiled a sample selecting the ten first ranked cluster galaxies ( 10frcgs ) of each system , excluding the most luminous galaxy , since these galaxies usually have very distinctive properties .",
    "the sample of galaxy pairs analysed in this work was obtained by @xcite .",

    "these authors analysed in detail the properties of galaxy interactions in high - density environments , identifying pairs that reside in groups by cross - correlating the total galaxy pair catalogue of @xcite with the group catalogue constructed by @xcite , updated to the sdss - dr7 .    in order to compare the properties of galaxies in different systems ,",
    "we cross - correlate all the galaxy samples described above , with the derived galaxy properties from the mpa - jhu emission line analysis for the sdss - dr7 . from this catalogue",
    "we extract several galaxy properties : as a spectral indicator of the stellar population mean age , we will use the strength of the @xmath8  break , @xmath2 , defined as the ratio of the average flux densities in the narrow continuum bands 3850 - 3950  and 4000 - 4100  @xcite .",
    "we also use the star formation rate ( sfr ) and specific star formation rates ( @xmath7 ) according to @xcite and total stellar masses ( @xmath65 ) calculated from photometry @xcite .      when comparing properties of galaxies that belong to different samples it is important to consider differences in the galaxy redshift distribution .",
    "for this reason , we construct control samples using a monte - carlo algorithm to randomly select galaxies that matched the galaxy triplet redshift distribution , for the different systems samples analysed in this work .",
    "the distribution of @xmath66 of triplet galaxies is truncated by definition at @xmath5 @xcite . in order to avoid biases due to less luminous galaxies , we restrict our analysis to galaxies brighter than @xmath5 .",
    "we performed a kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test between the resdhift distribution of the control samples and the redshift distribution of triplet galaxies . from this test",
    "we obtain a ` p ` value that represents the probability that a value of the ks statistic will be equal or more extreme than the observed value , if the null hypothesis holds . in all cases we obtained",

[ cols=\"<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the results obtained from this analysis indicate that both blue triplets and red triplets have such a combination of galaxies that can not be explained by a random reassignment of the galaxies . in particular , we conclude that systems comprising blue , star forming , young stellar population galaxies , have a high probability of being real systems and not a mere configuration of interloping galaxies . in support of this result",
    ", @xcite found that galaxy triplets are spiral rich systems populated mostly by late - type spirals with an excess of @xmath68 mag in the global blue luminosity in comparison to field galaxies .",
    "in the previous section we found that the galaxy configurations of triplets can not be explained by a random sampling of the triplet galaxies .",
    "in particular there are six blue triplets that are comprised by blue , young stellar population and star forming galaxies . in this section",
    "we investigate the dependence of triplet members properties on the total stellar mass of the system considering separately blue and red triplets and by comparison to the results from compact groups .",
    "this joint analysis of our results and those for compact groups is based on their similar stellar mass range , a fact that does not hold for pairs nor clusters .",
    "for the samples of triplets and compact groups described in section 2.1 and 2.2.1 , we calculate the redshift of each system as the mean redshift of their member galaxies .",
    "we restrict our analysis to the redshift range of triplets and perform a ks test to the redshift distributions of triplets and compact groups .",
    "the value obtained for ` p ` is greater than 0.05 so we can not reject the null hypothesis that the redshift of triplets and compact groups are drawn from the same distribution .",
    "the samples of triplets and compact groups used in this section comprises 71 and 163 systems , respectively and we show in figure [ f5 ] the distributions of redshift and log total @xmath69 for these samples .",
    "it can be appreciated that compact groups have a higher stellar mass content than triplets .",
    "this is somewhat expected since triplets consist of three bright galaxies while compact groups are composed by more than four members . in our study , we have considered the total stellar mass range spanned by the triplet sample ( 10.6@xmath70log total @xmath7111.8 ) and analyse the properties of galaxies as a function the total stellar mass content of the system .",
    "the contours shown in figure [ f6 ] represent the properties of compact groups members and the points correspond to galaxies in triplets .",
    "we have considered separately blue triplets ( light - blue filled triangles ) , and red triplets ( red filled squares ) , as well as triplets that do not fulfil these categories ( blue dots ) . the top , middle and bottom panel of this figure correspond to the @xmath7 , the ( @xmath3 ) colour index and the concentration index @xmath72 , where @xmath73 and @xmath73 are the radii containing 90% and 50% of the petrosian galaxy light ] , respectively , as a function of the total stellar mass content .",
    "the @xmath72 parameter is a suitable indicator of galaxy morphological type bimodality : early - type galaxies have @xmath74 while later type galaxies have typically @xmath75 @xcite    [ c][c][1.3]log total @xmath65/@xmath76 [ c][c][1.3]c [ c][c][1.3](@xmath3 ) [ b][c][1.3]log sfr/@xmath65 [ 1/yr ]    ( 190,610 ) ( 12,400 ) ( 12,200 ) ( 12,0 )    it can be appreciated , as expected , that the compact groups tend to have a tail towards larger total stellar masses .",
    "nevertheless , triplets and compact groups members present a similar behaviour . from this figure",
    ", we can also observe that blue triplets correspond to low total stellar mass systems .",
    "galaxies in these triplets also show a higher star formation activity and lower values of the concentration index , @xmath72 , corresponding to disk objects .",
    "on the other hand , galaxies in red triplets prefer higher total stellar mass systems and tend to be ellipticals with a low star formation efficiency .",
    "the dynamic of galaxy systems suggests that interactions are common in compact systems such as triplets and compact groups @xcite .",
    "@xcite performed dissipationless n - body simulations finding that compact configurations are continually replaced by new systems because within a single rich collapsing group , compact groups of galaxies form continuously . from the observational point of view ,",
    "@xcite combined near - infrared imaging and optical spectroscopy with archival hubble space telescope imaging and spitzer imaging and spectroscopy , revealing that the luminous ir galaxy ( lirg ) iras 19115 - 2124 is actually a triple system where the lirg phenomenon is dominated by the smallest of the components .",
    "since galaxies in triplets and compact groups may finally end in a single system , in this section we analyse different global properties of triplets of galaxies by considering the system as a whole .",
    "we will also perform the same analysis on compact groups in order to compare the results obtained for these systems . for this purpose",
    "we used the samples of triplets and compact groups defined in the previous section .    with the aim to complement the previous analysis",
    ", we also explore the dependence of the total star formation rate and total colour as a function of the total stellar mass of the systems.to measure the level of compactness of the systems , we have defined a geometric criteria in order to guarantee that the systems under analysis are not limited by the selection criterion commonly used in determining the system compactness .",
    "radii of compact groups are defined by the hickson criteria as the smallest circle that contains the geometric centres of compact group members . in order to define an homogeneous compactness criterion for triplets and compact groups we calculate the triplets minimum enclosing circle using the code of @xcite .",
    "then we define the compactness @xmath77 , as :    @xmath78    where @xmath73 is the radius enclosing @xmath79 of the petrosian flux of the galaxy in the r - band , @xmath80 is the minimum enclosing circle that contains the geometric centres of the galaxies in the system and n is the total number of members of the system . by definition , this quantity is a measure of the percentage of the system total area that is filled by the light of member galaxies .    left panels in figure [ f7 ] show the properties of the systems as a whole , as a function of the total stellar mass content . here",
    "again , the contours represent the compact groups , and the points correspond to the triplets .",
    "right panels in this figure show the distribution of the total sfr , global @xmath81 colour , and compactness @xmath77 for both samples .",
    "as it was observed for individual galaxies , it can be seen that the blue triplets have a high total star formation activity and tend to be less massive systems .",
    "red triplets are more massive objects and show a lower total star formation rate . from this figure",
    "it can also be appreciated that there is a correlation between the total star formation rate and total stellar mass for the triplets , while compact groups present an approximately constant trend .",
    "this is reflected in the total sfr distribution ( right upper panel ) : triplets are clearly bimodal , while the compact groups distribution is more consistent with a single population .    regarding total colour",
    ", there is a positive correlation with total stellar mass in both samples . as expected by its definition ,",
    "blue triplets are located in the blue , low mass tail of the distribution .    in the left bottom panel of figure [ f7 ]",
    ", we show the s parameter as a function of the total stellar mass .",
    "as can be appreciated , the compactness s of triplets increases toward high total stellar masses , and blue triplets tend to have less compact configurations .",
    "on the other hand , compact groups show a nearly constant trend .",
    "besides , as seen in the right bottom panel , it can be appreciated that the light in triplet systems is even more concentrated than in compact groups .",

    "we have studied 71 galaxy triplets in the redshift range @xmath0 with galaxy members brighter than @xmath82 .",
    "our study also includes a comparative analysis of galaxies in compact groups , the ten brightest members of rich clusters , and pair galaxies .",
    "we also analyse the stellar mass content , the star formation rates , the spectral @xmath2 index and the ( @xmath3 ) colour index of member galaxies .",
    "galaxies in triplets show star formation rates , colours and stellar populations comparable to those of galaxies in compact groups and clusters .",
    "this contrasts with pair galaxy members , which have systematically higher star formation activity indicators .",
    "thus , we conclude that triplets can not be considered as an extension of galaxy pairs with a third extra member .    with the aim of determining whether the configurations of galaxies in the sample of triple systems are strongly correlated or , on the contrary ,",
    "can be explained by a random sampling , we generate 1000 random triplet catalogues by a random reassignment of the galaxies from the real sample . from this analysis",

    "we have analysed different properties , such as total star formation rates and total global colours , finding that , in general , triplets and compact groups exhibit a similar behaviour .",
    "nevertheless we find that blue triplets , located in the less massive tail of the total stellar mass distribution , show an efficient total star formation activity with respect to compact groups which present low efficiency in forming new star generations , in the same total stellar mass range .",
    "in contrast , both , high stellar mass red triplets and compact groups in the same stellar mass region , show low total star formation activity .    in order to provide a compactness parameter of the triplets that can be suitably compared to the other systems ,",

    "this quantity is a measure of the percentage of the system total area that is filled by the light of member galaxies .",
    "the distribution of this compactness parameter shows , surprisingly , that light is even more concentrated in triplets than in compact groups .",
    "the results obtained in this work suggest that triplets composed by three luminous galaxies , have member with properties more similar to compact group members than to galaxies in pairs , and that the behaviour of triplets as a whole is similar to compact groups .",
