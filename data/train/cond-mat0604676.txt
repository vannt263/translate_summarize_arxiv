    "almost never occur in highly homogenized media @xcite , and one may reasonably inquire whether an inhomogeneous fluid , with a symmetry that is broken due to the variation of either a material property or a control parameter ( or both ) along some specific direction , will give rise to significant new physics . in the case of convection in horizontal fluid cells , broken up -",

    "a seminal work for broken lateral symmetry was the 1982 theoretical study by kramer and coworkers @xcite on very small material - property ramps in pattern - forming media , which motivated a number of new experiments and simulations on ramped systems .",
    "@xcite , for example , discovered convection patterns with a uniform group drift in a rbc experiment in which both u / d and lateral symmetry were broken due to the temperature - dependence of the viscosity and spatial modulations in the cell height .",

    "the liquid crystal is planar - nematic 4-methoxybenzylidene-4-butylaniline ( mbba ) .",
    "our experiments , which expand on a preliminary study limited to much smaller pattern areas @xcite , rely on ( 1 ) the use of nonuniform laser irradiation to produce a long strip parallel to the director that is slightly warmer than its surroundings , and ( 2 ) the fact that the control parameter in this medium is ( in general ) strongly dependent on temperature , as we show directly in experimental detail below .",
    "the experimental results are of interest because they differ qualitatively both from known near - threshold electroconvection patterns in planar mbba @xcite , and from work ( cited above ) on other systems with a broken lateral symmetry .",
    "we find that the temporal variation of the roll amplitude at a fixed position is clearly nonsinusoidal .",
    "we investigate the new dynamics by studying spacetime diagrams , the temporal variation of the amplitude at fixed positions , and wavenumber profiles .",
    "although a theory applicable to electroconvection in liquid crystals with strong spatial inhomogeneities is not available at present , we proffer suggestions , based on the experimental results , for potentially useful approaches to developing a theoretical model to explain our observations . many of these considerations should be applicable to other broken - symmetry pattern - forming fluids driven outside of equilibrium .",

    "[ eqgl ] above will have both real and imaginary parts .",
    "a direct comparison of experiment with cgle - based theory can be difficult , because the cgle can describe an extraordinary variety of different traveling - wave dynamics , and the coefficients of the equation are in general difficult to determine experimentally@xcite .",
    "however , it is well - known that a reduction of the dimensionality or localization in the experimental patterns , which have both been achieved in the present experiments by using a long strip of laser light to localize the rolls , can reduce considerably the difficulty of determining the coefficients .",
    "a useful starting point would appear to be the cgle modeling approach adopted by pastur _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite in describing their heated - wire experiments",
    ". these authors observed left- and right - traveling waves separated by sources and sinks .",
    "if the cgle model employed by pastur _",
    "_ could be extended to the case of nonuniform spatial heating by introducing a spatially dependent control parameter @xmath78 , it would be very interesting to see if the traveling - wave dynamics resulting from the model displayed characteristics that reproduced the experimental results above .    to conclude , we have presented experimental results on electroconvection - pattern formation in a narrow strip in which the lateral symmetry has been broken with a laser - induced thermal gradient .",
    "our main purpose was to report new experimental results that differ in a qualitative manner from previous experiments on broken - symmetry fluidized patterns .",
    "our measured temperature dependence of the threshold voltage showed that is possible to create a thermally localized supercritical strip .",
    "the spacetime profiles along the strip displayed a slow counterpropagating phase drift and an asymmetric relaxation - oscillation temporal profile , in addition to a strong slowly varying temporally periodic amplitude modulation that generates a central - zone gap .",
    "measurement of the spatial variation of the wavenumber displayed a wavenumber bandwidth that exceeded the eckhaus stability limit .",
    "we noted some simple connections to eckhaus unstable states and to the complex ginzburg - landau equation in an attempt to provide some potential guidance for the development of a theoretical model to explain the results .",
    "we are at present upgrading our apparatus and software to gain an improved understanding of the patterns discussed above .",
    "there are two future tasks that we believe are especially exigent .",
    "first , it is very important to carry out a _ direct _ measurement of the temperature as a function of position along the pattern strip .",
    "this would allow a determination of the control parameter @xmath78 as a function of position , which is important for the development of a model .",
    "this is difficult experimentally since the maximum temperature variation is only on the order of @xmath79 , but is crucial nonetheless .",
    "second , one should investigate whether numerical simulations of coupled cgl equations with a driving force consistent with fig .",
    "[ figlaserprofile ] can show an amplitude modulation and counterpropagating phase drifts akin to the experimental results .",
    "code - writing for such simulations is currently in progress .",
    "we gratefully acknowledge very helpful conversations with guenter ahlers , bill collins , stephen morris , matthias schrter , harry swinney , and richard wiener .",
    "drs is very grateful to ingo rehberg and werner pesch for their kind hospitality and important feedback on experimental and modeling questions during a brief visit to bayreuth .",
