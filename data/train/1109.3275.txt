    "recently , to solve the fowler equation some numerical experiments have been performed using mainly finite difference approximation schemes @xcite .",
    "however , these schemes are not effective because if we opt for an explicit scheme , numerical stability requires that the time step @xmath25 is limited by @xmath26 and , if we choose an implicit scheme , we have to solve a large system which is a computationally expensive operation .",
    "thus , the splitting method becomes an interesting alternative to solve the fowler model . to our knowledge",
    ", there is no convergence result in the literature for the splitting method associated to the fowler equation .",
    "this method is more commonly used to split different physical terms , such as reaction and diffusion terms , see for instance @xcite .",
    "splitting methods have also been employed for solving a wide range of nonlinear wave equations .",
    "the basic idea of this method is to decompose the original problem into sub - problems and then to approximate the solution of the original problem by solving successively the sub - problems .",
    "various versions of this method have been developed for the nonlinear schrdinger , korteweg - de - vries and modified korteweg - de - vries equations , see for instance @xcite . + for the fowler model , we consider , separately , the linear cauchy problem @xmath27 - \\eta \\ , \\partial_{x}^2 v = 0 ; \\quad v(0,x ) = v_0(x ) ,   \\label{nlocal}\\ ] ] and the nonlinear cauchy problem @xmath28 where @xmath29 are fixed _ positive _ parameters such that @xmath30 . equation is simply the viscous burgers equation .",

    "first , we can remark that if we do not consider the nonlinear term in , the analytical solutions are available using the fourier transform .",
    "thus , the linear part may be computed efficiently using a fast fourier transform ( hereafter fft ) algorithms .",
    "note also that the laplacian and the fractional term @xmath2 can not be treated separately .",
    "indeed , the equation @xmath40 = 0 $ ] is ill - posed .",
    "we next decide to handle the nonlinear term by adding a bit of viscosity in order to avoid shock problems in the standard burgers equation .",
    "therefore , the splitting approach presented in this article differs from e.g. the one analyzed in @xcite , which corresponds to assuming @xmath41 in the above definitions .",
    "the splitting operators associated to this approach when @xmath42 ( which amount to considering alternatively the heat equation and the burgers equation ) have been studied in @xcite ( as well as other equations involving the burgers nonlinearity , such as the kdv equation , see also @xcite ) .",
    "the main difference with the result presented in @xcite is that the operator @xmath2 is not a differential operator , so its action on nonlinear terms is rather involved , while this point would be needed to compute the lie commutator between the two operators @xmath43,\\quad b(v ) = -v\\d_x v + \\eps^2\\d_x^2 v,\\ ] ] as in e.g. @xcite .",
    "note that since we consider the lie splitting operator , we could in principle use the exact formula established in @xcite for the local error .",

    "* theorem  1 ) .",
    "we finally point out that we use smoothing effects associated to the viscous burgers equation ; see corollaries  [ cor : condest ] and [ cor : split1 ] .",
    "we motivate this choice by the presence of artificial diffusion in classical numerical schemes used to solve the convection equations .",
    "an alternative to reduce this effect is to consider numerical schemes of high order which are usually computationally expensive and do not seem to be very useful for the fowler model because of the diffusion term .",
    "we consider the lie formula defined by @xmath45 the alternative definition @xmath46 could be studied as well , leading to a similar result . also , the following evolution operators @xmath47 corresponding to the strang method @xcite could be considered .",
    "following the computations detailed in the present paper for the case , it would be possible to show that the other lie formula generates a scheme of order one , and to prove that the strang method is of order two ( for smooth initial data ) , in the same fashion as in , e.g. , @xcite .",

    "which yields the first two estimates of the induction , provided one takes @xmath329 , which is uniform in @xmath112 and @xmath25 .",

    "indeed , in @xcite , the fowler equation has been discretized using finite difference method and the numerical analysis showed that this operation is computationally expensive .",
    "this observation has also motivated the use of splitting methods , in particular the implementation of split - step fourier methods .    in order to avoid numerical reflections due to boundaries conditions and to justify the use of the fft method , we consider initial data with compact support displayed in figure  [ cinitiale ] to perform numerical simulations .        since we do not know the exact solution of the fowler equation , a classical numerical way to determine the convergence numerical order of schemes is to plot the logarithm of the error @xmath352 in function of the logarithm of the step time @xmath25 , where @xmath353 and @xmath354 are computed for time steps @xmath355 and @xmath356 , respectively , up to the final time @xmath57 .",
