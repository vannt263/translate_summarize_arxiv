    "not rarely , the actual or perceived difficulty of this computation is a hurdle that prevents adequate data analysis .",
    "specifically , relaxation in disordered systems is often described by the stretched exponential function @xmath2 . however ,",
    "when the same dynamics is measured in the frequency domain , experimentalists often resort to other fit functions ( like a sum of two lorentzians or a havrialiak - negami function ) that should be shaved away by occam s razor since they introduce additional parameters without providing better fits , let alone deeper insights .",
    "this paper describes the mathematical foundations of a new software that allows for speedy computation of the fourier transform of the stretched exponential function . for low and high frequencies ,",

    "the stretched exponential function arises in different mathematical contexts , for instance as lvy symmetric alpha - stable distribution , or as the complement of the cumulative weibull distribution . in recent years , it has been found to provide a good fit to various socio - economic statistics , like urban agglomeration sizes , currency exchange rate variations , or the ` success ' of scientists , musicians , and hollywood blockbusters @xcite .    in physics ,",
    "the most important use of the stretched exponential function is the approximative description of relaxation in glass - forming liquids and amorphous polymers . in 1993 , bhmer _ et al . _",
    "@xcite listed stretching exponents for over 70 materials , obtained by viscoelastic , calorimetric , dielectric , optical , and other linear response measurements . as of 2008 ,",
    "that review has been cited over 900 times , indicating a huge increase in the use of the stretched exponential function for describing relaxation phenomena .",
    "an impressive body of literature on stretched exponential relaxation in molecular and electronic glasses has been reviewed in 1996 by phillips @xcite ; i disagree , however , with his theoretical views , starting on the second page where he claims that @xmath1 tends towards  1 for high temperatures , which is not confirmed by recent measurements in normal and slightly supercooled liquids ( e.  g.  @xcite ) .",
    "other physical applications of the stretched exponential function are the time dependence of luminiscence or fluorescence decays @xcite , and the concentration dependence of diffusion coefficients and viscosities @xcite .",
    "in most applications , the exponent is restricted to values @xmath3 . however , in recent years some uses of the `` compressed '' or `` squeezed '' exponential function with @xmath4 have been proposed , mostly in protein kinetics @xcite , but also in magnetism @xcite .",
    "the use of the fourier transform to describe dynamic susceptibilities and scattering experiments has its foundations in linear response theory .",
    "the relations between response functions , relaxation functions , susceptibilities , correlation functions , and scattering laws are briefly summarized in appendix  [ alr ] .      in physics ,",
    "the earliest known use of the stretched exponential function is by rudolf kohlrausch in 1854 to describe charge relaxation in a leiden jar .",
    "he was followed by his son friedrich kohlrausch in 1863 who used the stretched exponential to describe torsional relaxation in glass fibers , thereby improving previous studies by wilhelm weber ( 1841 ) and rudolf kohlrausch ( 1847 ) . in the modern literature , these early accomplishments are often confounded , and a majority of references to poggendorff s annalen der physik und chemie is incorrect @xcite .    in 1970 , williams and watts introduced the fourier sine and cosine transform of the stretched exponential function to describe dielectric response as function of frequency @xcite .",
    "their intuition is remarkable , since they were neither aware of earlier uses of the stretched exponential in the time domain , nor had they the technical means of actually computing the fourier transform : based on analytic expressions for @xmath5 and @xmath6 , they courageously extrapolated to @xmath7 . in a subsequent paper @xcite",
    "it is quite obvious that the curves , perhaps drawn with a curving tool , are not really fits to the data .",
    "it was noticed soon that series expansions can be used to calculate the fourier transform of the stretched exponential in the limit of low or high frequencies @xcite .",
    "based on this , computer routines were implemented that complemented these series expansions by explicit integration for intermediate frequencies @xcite . in actual fit routines ,",
    "it was found more convenient to interpolate between tabulated values than to calculate the fourier transform explicitely @xcite .",
    "other experimentalists fit their data with the havriliak - negami function , and use some approximations @xcite to express their results as kohlrausch - williams - watts parameters .",

    "one obtains @xmath155 where @xmath156 is the negative primitive of the response function , @xmath157 .",
