    "in the last few years , several authors have proposed using directional transforms for various signal and image processing tasks .",
    "examples include the directional @xcite and steerable @xcite discrete cosine transform , the rotational transform @xcite , as well as other transforms employing sophisticated nonseparable geometries , e.g. curvelets @xcite , bandlets @xcite , contourlets @xcite , and so on .",
    "such transforms are appealing in many applications , including signal analysis and compression , because the adaptation of geometric parameters can optimally match the transform to the signal of interest .",
    "along the same lines , the discrete fourier transform ( dft ) is one of the most important tools in digital signal processing .",
    "it enables us to analyze , manipulate , and synthesize signals and it is now used in almost every field of engineering @xcite . in the past , some generalizations of the fourier transform have been presented , such as the short time fourier transform @xcite and the fractional fourier transform ( also called angular fourier transform ) @xcite @xcite . the short time fourier transform subdivides the signal into narrow time intervals in order to obtain simultaneous information on time and frequency",
    "instead , the fractional fourier transform , and its discrete version called discrete rotational fourier transform @xcite , can be interpreted as a rotation on the time - frequency plane .",
    "recently , the concept of a graph fourier transform ( gft ) has been introduced in @xcite ; this new transform generalizes the traditional fourier analysis to the graph domain .    in @xcite ,",
    "the theory of graph signal processing @xcite , and particularly the relationship between the graph fourier transform and grid graphs , has been exploited to define a new directional 2d - dct @xcite that can be steered in a chosen direction . in this letter , we extend this concept and present a new generalization of the dft , called steerable discrete fourier transform ( sdft ) .",
    "the proposed sdft can be defined in one or two dimensions ( unlike the steerable dct which can be defined only in the 2d case ) . in 1d , we start from the definition of the gft of a cycle graph and we obtain a new transform , the 1d - sdft , by rotating the 1d - dft basis .",
    "the 1d - sdft can be interpreted as a rotation of the basis vectors on the complex plane .",
    "instead , in the 2d case we use the gft of a toroidal grid graph to introduce the new 2d - sdft , which can be obtained by rotating the 2d - dft basis .",
    "the 2d - sdft represents a rotation on the two - dimensional euclidean space .",
    "since the dft is used in a wide range of applications , the sdft represents an interesting generalization that could be applied in various fields , including e.g. filtering , signal analysis , or even multimedia encryption where parametrized versions of common transforms have been used for security purposes @xcite . we also show that the sdft is related to other well - known transforms , such as the fourier sine and cosine transforms and the hilbert transform .",
    "a graph can be denoted as @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the set of vertices ( or nodes ) with @xmath2 and @xmath3 is the set of edges .",
    "it is possible to represent a graph by its adjacency matrix @xmath4 , where @xmath5 if there is an edge between node @xmath6 and @xmath7 , otherwise @xmath8 .",
    "the graph laplacian is defined as @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is a diagonal matrix whose @xmath6-th diagonal element @xmath11 is equal to the number of edges incident to node @xmath6 . since @xmath12 is a real symmetric matrix , it is diagonalizable by an orthogonal matrix @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the eigenvector matrix of @xmath12 that contains the eigenvectors as columns , @xmath15 is the diagonal eigenvalue matrix where the eigenvalues are sorted in increasing order and @xmath16 denotes the hermitian transpose .",
    "a graph signal @xmath17 in the vertex domain is a real - valued function defined on the nodes of the graph @xmath18 such that @xmath19 , where @xmath20 , is the value of the signal at node @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "the eigenvectors of @xmath12 are used to define the graph fourier transform ( gft ) @xcite of the signal @xmath22 as follows @xmath23",
    "the forward one dimensional discrete fourier transform ( 1d - dft ) of the signal @xmath17 can be computed in the following way @xmath24 we can write it in matrix form @xmath25 , where @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath27 is the 1d - dft matrix and it has the following property .",
    "[ theo ] the rows of the dft matrix are eigenvectors of any circulant matrix .    .",
    "on the right : a toroidal grid graph @xmath28.,title=\"fig:\",width=90 ] . on the right : a toroidal grid graph @xmath28.,title=\"fig:\",width=173 ]    let us now consider an undirected cycle graph @xmath29 with @xmath30 vertices , whose structure is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : graph ] .",
    "this type of graph is called a circulant graph because its adjacency matrix , and therefore its laplacian matrix , is circulant .",
    "circulant graphs are of great importance in graph signal processing , because they accommodate fundamental signal processing operations , such as linear shift - invariant filtering , downsampling , upsampling , and reconstruction @xcite .",
    "it is well known that a valid set of eigenvectors for any circulant matrix is the set of dft matrix rows , then the 1d - dft is a valid gft for @xmath29 ( i.e. @xmath31 ) .",
    "however , repeated eigenvalues are present in the spectrum of @xmath32 , because the following property holds @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the @xmath35-th eigenvalue of @xmath32 with @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath34 can be computed in the following way @xcite : @xmath37 for @xmath38 .",
    "in addition , @xmath32 has @xmath30 orthogonal eigenvectors @xmath39 , where @xmath40^t$ ] for @xmath38 @xcite .    from and",
    ", we can state that , if @xmath30 is even , @xmath41 and @xmath42 have algebraic multiplicity 1 , instead all the other eigenvalues have algebraic multiplicity 2 with @xmath43 , where @xmath44 . since the eigenvectors are orthogonal , the geometric multiplicity is equal to the algebraic multiplicity .",
    "this means that the dimension of the eigenspaces corresponding to @xmath34 where @xmath44 is 2 , then the vector basis of the 1d - dft is not the only possible eigenbasis of @xmath32 .",
    "we can then introduce the following corollary , whose proof follows from the discussion above and is omitted for brevity .",
    "the graph fourier transform of a cycle graph @xmath29 may be equal to the 1d - dft , but it is not the only possible graph fourier transform of a cycle graph .",
    "we now proceed to define the 1d - sdft . given an eigenvalue @xmath34 of @xmath32 with multiplicity 2 and the two corresponding 1d - dft vectors @xmath45 and @xmath46",
    ", we can define any other possible basis of the eigenspace corresponding to @xmath34 as the result of a rotation of @xmath45 and @xmath46 @xmath47 where @xmath48 is an angle in @xmath49 $ ] .    for every @xmath34 where @xmath44",
    ", we can rotate the corresponding eigenvectors as shown in . in the 1d - dft matrix , the pairs @xmath45 and @xmath46 are replaced with the rotated ones @xmath50 and @xmath51 obtaining a new transform matrix @xmath52 called 1d - sdft .",
    "the vector @xmath53 contains all the rotation angles used and its length is @xmath54 .",
    "the new transform matrix @xmath55 can be written as @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the 1d - dft matrix and @xmath58 is the rotation matrix , whose structure is defined so that , for each pair of eigenvectors , it performs the rotation as defined in .",
    "it is important to underline that the choice of the eigenvector pairs is given by the analysis of the eigenvalue multiplicity . in this way , the transform defined in is still the graph transform of a cycle graph",
    ".    equation shows that the sdft can be obtained by applying the rotation described by @xmath59 to the output of the standard dft , that can be easily computed using the fft .    from a geometrical point of view , represents a rotation in the complex plane .",
    "given a real - valued signal @xmath60 , its dft coefficients @xmath61 have the symmetry property @xmath62 , where @xmath63 and the `` @xmath64 '' symbol denotes conjugation @xcite .",
    "then , using the rotation in we can break this symmetry .",
    "for example , if we perform a rotation by @xmath65 , we can completely separate the real part and the imaginary part . in fact , given @xmath66 and @xmath67 , which are obtained rotating @xmath45 and @xmath46 by @xmath65 as in , the new transform coefficients are @xmath68 where @xmath69 . as an example , fig .",
    "[ fig : plot1d ] shows a plot of a pair of coefficients @xmath70 and @xmath71 as a function of the rotation angle @xmath72 $ ] . for both coefficients",
    ", we can clearly see that the absolute values of the real and imaginary part are inversely proportional .",
    "moreover , when @xmath73 with @xmath74 one coefficient is a real value and the other one is a pure imaginary value .     and @xmath71 as a function of the rotation angle @xmath75$].,width=283 ]    finally , it is important to underline that the rotation described in preserves the total energy of the coefficients in the eigenspace , i.e. @xmath76      we have already shown that if @xmath77 the 1d - sdft is equal to the 1d - dft . instead if @xmath78 , it is interesting to show that for @xmath79 we have that @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the @xmath35-th coefficient of the fourier cosine transform @xcite .",
    "analogously , for @xmath82 we have that @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the @xmath35-th coefficient of the fourier sine transform @xcite . in turn ,",
    "the fourier cosine and sine transform are highly related respectively to the dct and dst @xcite .",
    "moreover , we can also relate the 1d - sdft with the hilbert transform @xcite .",
    "in fact , given a signal @xmath22 it can be proved that @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the hilbert transform of @xmath22 and @xmath87 is the sdft-1d correspondig to the improper rotation @xcite @xmath88 moreover @xmath89 .",
    "these relationships are interesting because they may open the way to new generalizations of these transforms .      in the two dimensional case ,",
    "the 2d - dft of a signal @xmath90 can be computed as follows @xmath91 in matrix form we can write it as @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is the vectorized signal @xmath94 and @xmath95 is the 2d - dft matrix , which is defined in the following way @xmath96 where @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "we now consider a grid graph with periodic boundary conditions that is called toroidal grid graph @xmath101 @xcite , where @xmath102 .",
    "an example of a toroidal grid graph is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : graph ] .",
    "it is known that the toroidal grid graph @xmath103 corresponds to the product graph @xmath104 , where @xmath105 is a cycle of @xmath106 vertices @xcite .    in order to study the spectrum of the toroidal grid graph",
    ", we recall the following theorem on the spectrum of the product graph .",
    "[ theo : compute_eigen ] let @xmath107 and @xmath108 be graphs on @xmath109 and @xmath110 vertices , respectively . then",
    ", the eigenvalues of @xmath111 are all possible sums of @xmath112 , where @xmath113 and @xmath114 . moreover , if @xmath115 is an eigenvector of @xmath107 corresponding to @xmath116 and @xmath117 an eigenvector of @xmath108 corresponding to @xmath118 , then @xmath119 ( where @xmath120 indicates the kronecker product ) is an eigenvector of @xmath18 corresponding to @xmath112 .",
    "we now show that there is a strong connection between 2d - dft and toroidal grid graph .",
    "let @xmath121 be a toroidal graph , then the 2d - dft basis is an eigenbasis of @xmath122 .",
    "let @xmath123 and @xmath124 , where @xmath125 , be the eigenvectors of @xmath126 corrisponding respectively to the eigenvalues @xmath127 and @xmath128 , as defined in sec .",
    "then , using theorem [ theo : compute_eigen ] we can compute the eigenvector @xmath129 of @xmath121 corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath130 @xmath131 where @xmath132 and @xmath133 is the @xmath35-th row of the 2d - dft matrix @xmath134 .",
    "therefore , the 2d - dft is an eigenbasis of the laplacian of @xmath121 ( i.e. @xmath135 ) .    since @xmath136 and recalling property for the eigenvalues @xmath34 of @xmath29 , in the spectrum of @xmath137 several repeated eigenvalues are presents :    * the eigenvalues @xmath138 where @xmath139 and @xmath140 have algebraic multiplicity 8 since @xmath141 . *",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath142 where @xmath143 have algebraic multiplicity 4 since @xmath144 . * the eigenvalues @xmath138 where @xmath145 and @xmath146 ( or @xmath143 and @xmath147 ) have algebraic multiplicity 4 because @xmath148 ( @xmath149 ) . *",
    "the eigenvalue @xmath150 has multiplicity 2 . *",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath151 and @xmath152 are the only ones with algebraic multiplicity 1 .",
    "since the kronecker product is not commutative , the eigenvectors @xmath129 of @xmath153 are orthogonal .",
    "then , the geometric multiplicity is equal to the algebraic multiplicity . therefore , the dimension of the eigenspaces corresponding to the repeated eigenvalues is bigger than one .",
    "this proves that the 2d - dft is not the unique eigenbasis for @xmath137 and , thus , the 2d - dft is not the unique gft for @xmath153 .",
    "as shown above , in the spectrum of @xmath137 many eigenvalues with multiplicity greater than 2 are present .",
    "therefore , it may be possible to define rotations in more than two dimensions .",
    "however , these rotations may not have a clear geometrical meaning .",
    "for this reason , in the following of this section we restrict our study to rotations in two dimensions that exploit the symmetric property @xmath154 . instead",
    ", the rotations that exploit the property @xmath155 and @xmath156 are analog to the ones shown in the 1d case .    given any vector pair of the 2d - dft , @xmath129 and @xmath157 where @xmath140",
    ", we can obtain a new pair of eigenvectors of @xmath137 by performing the following rotation @xmath158 where @xmath159 is an angle in @xmath49 $ ] .",
    "then , analogously to the 1d case , we can define a new transform matrix @xmath160 , called 2d - sdft , that is obtained by replacing in the 2d - dft matrix the pairs @xmath129 and @xmath157 with the rotated ones @xmath161 and @xmath162 .",
    "the vector @xmath163 contains all the angles used and its length is equal to the number of vector pairs , that is @xmath164 . similarly to the 1d case , also the 2d - sdft matrix @xmath55 can be computed as in , where , in this case , @xmath165 is the rotation matrix whose structure is defined so that , for each pair of vectors , it performs the rotation as defined in .    given a signal @xmath166 , we can compute the sdft coefficients of @xmath22 corresponding to the eigenvectors @xmath161 and @xmath162 in the following way @xmath167 therefore , we can state that , from a geometrical point of view , performs separately a rotation of the real and imaginary part in the 2d euclidean space . then , by applying the total energy of the real and imaginary part of the coefficient pair remains unchanged , that is @xmath168 @xmath169 but it is possible to unbalance the energy of the real and imaginary part of each coefficient .",
    "for example , we can compact all the energy of the real part in one coefficient , zeroing out the other one .",
    "in fact , given the pair of dft coefficients @xmath170 and @xmath171 we rotate the pair of corresponding dft vectors @xmath129 and @xmath157 as in by an angle defined as follows @xmath172 then , we get that @xmath173 and the energy of the real part of the coefficient pair is conveyed to @xmath174 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rot_xy ] .     and @xmath157.,width=143 ]",
    "in this section we discuss possible applications of the sdft .    the 1d - sdft can be useful for signal analysis and processing .",
    "for example , it can be used for easily filtering the even / odd component of a signal .",
    "in fact , if we rotate the pairs of vectors @xmath45 and @xmath46 by @xmath65 , we can design a filter that , convolved with the input signal , retains only the first ( last ) @xmath175 coefficients and outputs the even ( odd ) signal component , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sym ] where we obtain as output of the filter the even component of the input signal .",
    "we can also easily filter the even or odd component of specific frequencies .",
    "analogously in 2d , we can perform the same filtering operation by rotating by @xmath65 the pairs of vectors @xmath129 and @xmath176 and the pairs @xmath177 and @xmath178",
    ". this filtering operation could be useful for signal representation , as in @xcite .",
    "moreover , in we have already shown that the sdft-1d may be used to perform the hilbert transform , this could be useful for computing the local phase and amplitude , that is used in many applications , such as edge detection @xcite and image feature extraction @xcite .",
    "the 1d - sdft can be applied also in multimedia encryption problems . in this field ,",
    "several works use parametrized versions of common transforms for security purposes @xcite .",
    "since the sdft is a parametrized version of the dft , one can use the parameter @xmath179 as a secret key .",
    "more specifically , given a signal @xmath180 we can obtain @xmath181 and then consider the first @xmath175 components of @xmath61 as the encrypted signal .",
    "given @xmath182 , it is possible to reconstruct @xmath61 and then we can obtain the original signal @xmath22 by applying the inverse sdft .",
    "we can also consider the sdft as a keyed transform basis that can be used for compressed sensing - based cryptography @xcite .",
    "the applications presented in this section are just a few examples of possible applications of the sdft , but the sdft could be of interest for a wide range of fields , such as array signal processing , phase retrieval and magnetic resonance imaging .",
