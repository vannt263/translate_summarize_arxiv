    "the binding energies of negatively or positively charged trions are known to be typically lower than those of biexcitons in the same nanostructure , although the specific trion to biexciton binding energy ratios are strongly sample fabrication dependent.@xcite first experimental evidence for the trion formation in carbon nanotubes was reported by matsunaga et al.@xcite and by santos et al.@xcite on @xmath0-doped ( 7,5 ) and undoped ( 6,5 ) cns , respectively .",
    "theoretically , rnnow et al.@xcite have predicted that the lowest energy trion states in all semiconducting cns with diameters of the order of or less than 1  nm should be stable at room temperature .",

    "trion binding energies greater than those of biexcitons are theoretically reported by watanabe and asano,@xcite due to the energy band nonparabolicity and the coulomb screening effect that reduces the biexciton binding energy more than that of the trion .",
    "watanabe and asano have extended the first order ( @xmath8)-perturbation series expansion model originally developed by ando for excitons ( see ref.@xcite for review ) to the case of electron - hole complexes such as trions and biexcitons .",

    "if they are not , then the method brings up an underestimated binding energy value , especially for molecular complexes such as biexciton and trion where the kinematics of complex formation depends largely on the asymptotic behavior of the wave functions of the constituents .",

    "very recently , the problem of the trion complex formation in cqws was studied theoretically in great detail for trions composed of a _ direct _ exciton and an electron ( or a hole ) located in the neighboring quantum well@xcite [ as sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ]  ( a ) ] .",
    "significant binding energies are predicted on the order of @xmath119  mev at interwell separations @xmath120  nm for the lowest energy positive and negative trion states , to allow one suggest a possibility for trion wigner crystallization .",
    "figure  [ fig6 ]  ( b ) shows another possible trion complex that can also be realized in cqws . here",
    ", the trion is composed of an _ indirect _ exciton and an electron ( or a hole ) in such a manner as to keep two same - sign particles in the same quantum well with the opposite - sign particle being located in the neighboring well .",
    "this can be viewed as the two equivalent configurations of the three - particle system in the configuration space ( @xmath121 , @xmath122 ) of the two _ independent _ in - plane projections of the relative electron - hole distances @xmath123 and @xmath124 in the two _ equivalent _ indirect excitons sharing the same electron , or the same hole as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ]  ( b ) .",
    "such a three - particle system in the quasi-2d semiconductor cqw nanostructure is quite analogous to the quasi-1d trion presented in sec .  3 above [ cf .",
    "[ fig6 ]  ( b ) and fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ] .",
    "therefore , the landau - herring configuration space approach can be used here as well to evaluate the binding energy for this special case of the quasi-2d trion state .",
    "following is a brief outline of how one could proceed with the configuration space method to obtain the ground state binding energy for the quasi-2d trion complex sketched in fig  [ fig6 ]  ( b ) .",
    "a complete analysis of the problem will be presented elsewhere .",
    "the method requires knowledge of the ground state characteristics of the indirect exciton ( abbreviated as `` @xmath125 '' in what follows ) .",
    "specifically , one needs to know the quasi-2d ground state energy @xmath126 and corresponding _ in - plane _ relative electron - hole motion wave function @xmath127 for the indirect exciton in the cqw system with the interwell distance @xmath128 .",
    "these can be found by solving the radial scrdinger equation that is obtained by decoupling radial relative electron - hole motion in the cylindrical coordinate system with the @xmath129-axis being perpendicular to the qw layers [ see fig  [ fig6 ]  ( b ) ] . such an equation was derived and analyzed previously by leavitt and little.@xcite the energy and the wave function of interest are as follows @xmath130 \\label{indirect}\\\\[-0.2 cm ] \\psi_{i\\!x}(\\rho , d)=n\\exp[-\\lambda(\\sqrt{\\rho^2+d^2}-d)]\\,,\\hskip0.5cm\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath131 is the exponential integral , @xmath132 , the normalization constant @xmath133 is determined from the condition @xmath134 and all quantities are measured in atomic units as defined in sec .  2 .",
    "= 12.0 cm    with eq .",
    "( [ indirect ] ) in place , one can work out strategies for tunneling current calculations in the configuration space ( @xmath121 , @xmath122 ) of the two _ independent _ in - plane projections of the relative electron - hole distances @xmath123 and @xmath124 in the two _ equivalent _ indirect excitons as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ]  ( b ) . both tunneling current responsible for the trion complex formation and that responsible for the biexciton complex formation can be obtained in full analogy with how it was done above for the respective quasi-1d complexes .",
    "the only formal difference now is the change in the phase integration volume from @xmath135 to @xmath136 . minimizing the tunneling current with respect to the center - of - mass - to - center - of - mass distance of the two equivalent indirect excitons results in the binding energy of a few - particle complex of interest .",
    "note that the method applies to the complexes formed by _",
    "excitons only as they allow equivalent configurations for a few - particle system to tunnel throughout in the configuration space ( @xmath121 , @xmath122 ) , thereby forming a respective ( tunnel ) coupled few - particle complex .",
    "binding energy calculations for indirect exciton complexes in semiconductor cqw nanostructures are important to understand the principles of the more complicated electron - hole structure formation such as that shown in fig .",
    "this is a coupled charge - neutral spin - aligned wigner - like structure formed by two trions , one positively charged and another one negatively charged .",
    "the entire structure is electrically neutral , and it has an interesting electron - hole spin alignment pattern .",
    "this structure can also be viewed as a triexciton , a coupled state of three indirect singlet excitons .",
    "one could also imagine a wigner - like crystal structure formed by unequal number of electrons and holes , as opposed to that in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , whereby the entire coupled structure could possess net charge and spin at the same time to allow precise electro- and magnetostatic control and manipulation by its optical and spin properties .",
    "such wigner - like electron - hole crystal structures in cqws might be of great interest for spinoptronics applications .",
    "all in all , indirect excitons , biexcitons and trions formed by indirect excitons are those building blocks that control the formation of more complicated wigner - like electron - hole crystal structures in cqws .",
    "the configuration space method presented here allows one to study the binding energies for these building blocks as functions of cqw system parameters , and thus to understand how stable electron - hole wigner crystallization could possibly be in these quasi-2d nanostructures .",
    "the method should also work well for biexciton and trion complexes in quasi-2d self - assembled transition metal dichalcogenide heterostructures , where electrons and holes accumulated in the opposite neighboring monolayers are recently reported to form indirect excitons with new exciting properties such as increased recombination time@xcite and vanishing high - temperature viscosity.@xcite",
    "presented herein is a universal configuration space method for binding energy calculations of the lowest energy neutral ( biexciton ) and charged ( trion ) exciton complexes in spatially confined quasi-1d semiconductor nanostructures .",
    "the method works in the effective two - dimensional configuration space of the two relative electron - hole motion coordinates of the two non - interacting quasi-1d excitons .",
    "the biexciton or trion bound state forms due to under - barrier tunneling between equivalent configurations of the electron - hole system in the configuration space .",
    "tunneling rate controls the binding strength and can be turned into the binding energy by means of an appropriate variational procedure .",
    "quite generally , trions are shown to be more stable ( have greater binding energy ) than biexcitons in strongly confined quasi-1d structures with small reduced electron - hole masses .",
    "biexcitons are more stable than trions in less confined structures with large reduced electron - hole masses . a universal crossover behavior is predicted whereby trions become less stable than biexcitons as the transverse size of the quasi-1d nanostructure increases .",
    "an outline is given of how the method can be used for electron - hole complexes of indirect excitons in quasi-2d semiconductor systems such as coupled quantum wells and van der waals bound transition metal dichalcogenide heterostructures . here",
    ", indirect excitons , biexcitons , and trions formed by indirect excitons control the formation of more complicated wigner - like electron - hole crystal structures .",
