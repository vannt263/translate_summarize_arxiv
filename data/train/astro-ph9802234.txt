    "the extragalactic background ir field potentially contains a wealth of information relevant to both cosmology and particle physics ( see for example @xcite ) , but has so far eluded any conclusive detection .",
    "direct measurement of the characteristics of this radiation are frustrated by the dominance of local , galactic ir sources .",
    "tev gamma - ray astronomy provides a means to study the ir background indirectly , free of such complications , by looking for modifications to high energy gamma ray spectra due to interactions with this background field via the process @xmath9 .",
    "this idea was first noted by gould and schrder @xcite and has been more recently restated by stecker and de jager @xcite .",
    "previous ir studies making use of this phenomenon have generally used spectral data from the active galactic nucleus ( agn ) mrk 421 taken by the egret @xcite and whipple @xcite experiments at gev and tev energies , respectively .",
    "these studies have relied on extrapolating flux measurements between these two energy regimes in an effort to determine the inherent shape of the source spectrum @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "this approach has several difficulties : * 1 ) * since the flux level is known to be highly variable at tev energies , the relative normalization between egret and whipple flux measurements is not known ; * 2 ) * the flux of ir photons can not be assumed to be zero in the intervening energy range ; and * 3 ) * the shape of the inherent source spectrum is not known and can not be assumed to necessarily follow a single power law from gev to tev energies .",
    "indeed , current best fit values for mrk 421 at tev energies indicate a steeper spectrum than is reflected by the egret data @xcite , suggesting that the spectral shape changes in the intervening energy range .",
    "in addition , most of the analyses have assumed a particular model to describe the shape of the ir photon spectrum .",
    "even a more recent attempt at a less model - dependent limit using data from mrk 501 nevertheless assumes a power - law source spectrum , an arbitrary ir flux normalization and constant ir energy densities over energy ranges spanning up to an order of magnitude in extent @xcite .",
    "limits derived in this manner may not apply if the background ir spectrum is of a different shape and , in particular , can not necessarily be used to constrain mechanisms which might produce sharp features in the spectrum on a scale smaller than that of the assumed model .",
    "this current paper will attempt to define more robust limits based on recent high energy observations of agn which do not rely on extrapolation from lower energies or the assumption of a strict power - law source spectrum and are independent of the ir model down to scales corresponding to a factor of 2 change in ir energy .",
    "these limits will then be used to constrain significantly the possible contribution of very massive objects ( vmos ) to the dark matter problem and also to place improved bounds on the radiative decay of massive neutrinos in the mass range above @xmath10 ev , which is in the regime of interest to the atmospheric neutrino problem .",
    "two active galaxies , mrk 421 and mrk 501 , have thus far been seen to produce tev gamma - ray emission by independent experimental groups . these active galaxies",
    "are both of the blazar class and are located at redshifts of 0.031 and 0.033 , respectively .",
    "both objects have exhibited significant flux variability at tev energies , changing by an order of magnitude or more with characteristic timescales of less than an hour ( in the case of mrk 421 , as short as 15 minutes ) .",
    "recent analyses of data from mrk 421 by the whipple group @xcite @xcite indicate a differential spectrum with an @xmath11 power law extending to energies beyond 5 tev , possibly as high as 8 tev . similarly , the hegra collaboration has measured the `` high - state '' spectrum of mrk 501 @xcite and has found it to be described by an @xmath12 power law extending to energies as high as 10 tev .    for the purposes of this paper , the available data on active galaxies at a redshift of @xmath13",
    "will thus be taken to indicate a spectral shape which is bounded at the 90% confidence level between the power laws @xmath14 and @xmath15 and normalized by an arbitrary flux constant .",
    "it will be assumed that the measured spectra continue up to energies of 10 tev .",
    "however , due to possible systematic uncertainties in energy scale of @xmath1630% , more conservative limits will also be computed assuming a maximum gamma - ray energy of 6 tev .",
    "finally , it will be assumed that the inherent differential source spectrum is steeper than an @xmath17 power law , although the specific shape need not be a power law itself .",
    "the limits derived are relatively insensitive to this latter choice .",
    "for example selecting @xmath18 as a bound was found to change the inferred limits by less than 30% .",
    "for ease of computation , the high energy spectrum is taken to consist of differential flux measurements at the following discrete energies : 0.4 , 0.75 , 1.0 , 1.5 , 2.0 , 3.0 , 4.0 , 6.0 and 10.0 tev .",
    "the spectrum of ir photons is approximated by a series of separate intervals spanning the energies 0.025 - 0.042 , 0.042 - 0.083 , 0.083 - 0.167 , 0.167 - 0.33 , 0.33 - 0.625 and 0.625 - 1.0 ev . within each interval ,",
    "the value of @xmath19 is taken as constant , where @xmath20 is the energy of the ir photon and @xmath21 is the number density of photons ( _ i.e. _ photons/@xmath22/ev ) .",
    "the value of @xmath19 among these intervals can thus be varied to reflect different background ir models , and the corresponding effect of @xmath0-@xmath0 absorption on tev gamma - rays calculated according to the prescription described by previous papers @xcite , @xcite . for these calculations , a conservative value for the hubble constant of 85 km / s / mpc is assumed @xcite .    to calculate upper limits then , the inherent agn differential spectrum was allowed to assume any shape steeper than @xmath17 and the values of @xmath19 among ir intervals were allowed to take on any values subject to the following constraints : * 1 ) * that these values are lower than the directly determined upper bounds imposed by other experiments ( shown in figure 1 ) ; and * 2 ) * that the attenuation implied by the ir model would not cause the shape of the observed tev spectrum to deviate outside of the power - law bounds previously defined based on the data .",
    "this approach essentially anchors the lower energy tev data to the appropriate observational upper bounds and then extends these bounds based on the shape and extent of the agn spectra at higher energies . from these considerations ,",
    "the maximum value of energy density permitted in each ir interval was determined .",
    "the resulting limits are summarized in table 1 and are also plotted in figure 1 for assumed maximum gamma - ray energies of 6 tev and 10 tev .",
    "note that this choice of maximum energy primarily effects only the two lowest energy ir intervals .",
    ".derived upper limits to @xmath19 [ cols= \" < , < , < \" , ]     in the range of @xmath23 ev , the limits presented here are up to 2 orders of magnitude more restrictive than those of dirbe @xcite .",
    "note that these limits apply only to models which would produce features in the ir spectrum on a scale comparable to or larger than the interval widths used in the calculation .",
    "monoenergetic line features , for example , are not necessarily constrained by these limits .",
    "under certain cosmological scenarios , density fluctuations in the early universe at a redshift of @xmath161000 could give rise to the pregalactic formation of massive stars ( @xmath24 ) at redshifts in the range of @xmath16100 - 300 @xcite .",
    "such very massive objects ( vmos ) would collapse to black holes after their main - sequence phase without any significant metal ejection .",
    "it has been suggested that the remnants of vmos , which would ultimately cluster with galaxies , might provide an explanation for the dark matter associated with galaxy rotation curves @xcite , @xcite .",
    "such rotation curves indicate that the amount of dark matter is in excess of 5 percent of the critical density , while other studies of galaxy motion and hot gas in clusters of galaxies suggest a value as high as 20 percent @xcite .    while invisible now",
    ", vmos would have produced a significant flux of ir photons during their burning phase .",
    "the peak number density of these photons is given @xcite by :    @xmath25    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is the ir photon energy ( in ev ) corresponding to the peak of the vmo contribution , @xmath28 is the photon number density due to vmos in @xmath29 , @xmath30 is the mass - density of vmos expressed as a fraction of the critical density , @xmath31 is the formation redshift of the vmos , and the hubble constant is given by @xmath32 km / s / mpc .",
    "thus , the ir limits derived previously may be used to place upper bounds on @xmath30 .",
    "these bounds are shown in figure 2 as a function of the assumed vmo formation redshift for @xmath33=0.65 ( which is conservative for this limit ) .",
    "note that for either maximum gamma - ray energy assumed , the limit on @xmath30 is less than 0.05 for the redshift range of 100 - 200 and less than 0.065 for the range 200 - 300 . if the maximum gamma - ray energy is taken to be 10 tev , the limit is less than 0.05 for the the entire 100 - 300 range .",
    "hence , assuming minimal reprocessing by dust grains , these limits appear to rule out vmo models as providing the explanation for observed galaxy rotation curves .",
    "several experiments have observed an apparent descrepency in the ratio of @xmath34 to @xmath35 fluxes expected from cosmic ray interactions in the atmosphere @xcite @xcite @xcite . a possible explanation for this effect may involve 2-component neutrino oscillations with @xmath36ev@xmath37 and , thus ,",
    "a neutrino mass in the regime of 0.1 ev ( provided the mass of the lighter neutrino is comparable to or smaller than this value ) . if neutrinos have mass and different flavor eigenstates may mix , then massive neutrinos might decay via the process @xmath38 , where @xmath39 . for neutrino masses in the @xmath16ev regime , such a radiative decay process would contribute to the infrared background .",
    "although mono - energetic photons would be initially produced from a 2-body decay , the photon spectrum would be broadened for relic neutrinos which decay over a range of redshifts such that the background density can be constrained by the limits presented previously .",
    "some unstable relic neutrinos with a lifetime longer than that of the universe would still be decaying now and would have produced a background photon density given by : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is half the rest mass of the unstable neutrino in ev , @xmath42 is the photon number density due to neutrino decay in @xmath29 , @xmath43 is the branching ratio for the radiative decay mode and @xmath44 is the neutrino lifetime in years @xcite",
    ". implied lower bounds for @xmath45 in the neutrino mass range @xmath46 are shown in figure 3 based on the ir limits presented in this paper for @xmath47 .",
    "previous constraints in this mass range from the work of ressell and turner @xcite are shown for comparison .",
    "this represents an improvement of the constraints in some cases by more than 2 orders of magnitude .",
    "similarly , neutrinos with lifetimes shorter than the age of the universe but longer than the age at which decoupling of matter and radiation occurred will result in a background photon density given by : @xmath48 where , in this case , @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the mass - density of the universe in units of the critical density .",
    "ir limits given here have thus been used to define exclusion contours which can be conveniently characterised by @xmath51 for the region defined by @xmath52 where @xmath53 for an assumed maximum gamma - ray energy of 10 tev , and @xmath54 for a maximum energy of 6 tev . once again",
    ", this represents an improvement in branching ratio sensitivity of approximately two orders of magnitude .",
    "recent data from very high energy gamma - ray observations of active galaxies has been used to set improved upper limits to the infared background radiation which are robust and relatively model - independent .",
    "these limits cast doubt on vmo models as providing the explanation for dark matter in galactic halos and tighten constraints on the radiative decay of relic neutrinos in the mass range near 0.1 ev by approximately two orders of magnitude .",
    "substantial improvement in the ability to study the infrared background via @xmath0-@xmath0 interactions is expected with the next generation of instruments which will allow the behavior of more distant sources to be examined .",
    "in fact , the procedure used to derive the limits given in table 1 may also be used to determine lower limits to the maximum distance out to which tev gamma - ray telescopes can be expected to probe .",
    "this has been done for the gamma - ray energy range of 0.4 - 10 tev , assuming that a source remains `` visible '' out to an optical depth of 2 and that the majority of the ir was produced prior to the epoch of the sources under study .",
    "ir and uv upper bounds from direct observations in the energy range greater than 2 ev have also been used to calculate this minimum distance for gamma - ray energies of 0.05 and 0.1 tev .",
    "the results are shown in figure 4 .",
    "the current generation of ground - based , gamma - ray telescopes have a typical lower energy threshold of @xmath160.5 tev and are thus expected to be able to see sources possessing redshifts up to or beyond @xmath55=0.1 .",
    "the next generation of instruments is expected to have an energy threshold in the region of 0.05 to 0.1 tev , and will therefore be able to see out to a redshift of at least @xmath55=0.5 .",
    "this represents a substantially larger volume of space than has so far been explored at tev energies .",
    "this , and the known preponderance of agn at larger redshifts , indicates a bright future for ground - based , gamma - ray astronomy and strongly suggests a drive towards higher duty cycles , larger apertures and greater dynamic ranges for such instruments to explore this regime thoroughly ."
