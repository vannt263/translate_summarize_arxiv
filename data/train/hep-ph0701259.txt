    "the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven national laboratory has announced that there is a new phase of matter , the quark - gluon plasma , produced in the au - au collision .",
    "experimental results from rhic indicate that this new phase of nuclear matter has a small shear viscosity per entropy density ratio @xmath5 near @xmath6 ( phase transition temperature from hadronic matter to quark - gluon plasma ) .",
    "this implies the strongly coupled quark - gluon plasma was formed near @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "one can investigate its thermal properties based on the probes which provide us with the information about the presence of this nuclear matter .",
    "one of the tools is the quarkonium .",
    "quarkonium is bound state of the heavy quark and antiquark pair . to estimate the energy and radius of these bound states",
    ", one can solve the schrdinger equation with the non - relativistic empirical potential  @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the qcd - string tension and @xmath9 is the effective coupling . in the hot quark - gluon plasma , the deconfined charges would modify the interaction between the heavy quark pair such that we expect the colour - screened potential  @xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the screening radius .",
    "when the temperature increases , the screening radius @xmath11 decreases .",
    "roughly speaking , once the screening radius @xmath11 is smaller than the radius of bound state of the heavy quark pair , the heavy quark and antiquark would not bind together and the quarkonium dissociates . at rhic",
    ", the relatively light charmonia such as @xmath12 could be produced in a large number in the initial stage of the collision process .",
    "if there is a quark - gluon plasma formed in the region of produced charmonium , it will affect the production such that the yield of @xmath12 will be suppressed as compared with the yield without the quark - gluon plasma .",
    "thus the strong suppression of @xmath12 production can be used as the indication of the formation of the quark - gluon plasma  @xcite .",
    "the screening radius is a good indicator of the presence of the quark - gluon plasma , as well as a good probe to estimate the temperature profile of the produced quark - gluon nuclear phases .",
    "the screening radius @xmath11 estimated by the lattice calculations gives @xmath13 fm at @xmath14 mev for @xmath15 mev  ( from fig .",
    "11 of ref .",
    "remarkably , the screening length calculated by the gravity dual theory in the original ads / cft correspondence  @xcite for zero - spin meson gives the value @xmath16 fm at @xmath14 mev  @xcite .",
    "even this is close to the lattice result , it is desirable to take into account the nonzero angular momentum of the quark antiquark pair in the calculation .",
    "one way to incorporate the angular momentum of the mesonic states is to rotate the background metric of the corresponding gravity dual theory  @xcite .",
    "we will adopt this approach in this article .",
    "the original ads / cft correspondence proposes that the @xmath17 super yang - mills ( sym ) theory at large @xmath18 in four dimensions is dual to the low energy super gravity approximation to type ii@xmath19 string compactified on @xmath20  @xcite . because of the conformal invariance and supersymmetry , @xmath17 sym is not exactly equivalent to qcd . in qcd ,",
    "the coupling constant is the function of momentum transfer with a non - zero @xmath21 function and quark is in the fundamental representation . in @xmath17 sym ,",
    "the coupling constant is constant ( @xmath21 function is equal to zero ) and all the particles are in the adjoint representation . even though sym is fundamentally different from the real qcd , they both have certain similar properties of the strongly coupled non - abelian gauge plasma .",
    "the calculation of ratio of the shear viscosity divided by entropy density is equal to @xmath22 in sym .",
    "this result is taken to be the lower bound of the strongly coupled quark - gluon plasma  @xcite .",
    "this gravity dual , however , does not contain chiral quarks and the corresponding chiral symmetry restoration transition .",
    "ad hoc _ way of introducing heavy quark into the theory is to use probe `` flavor '' branes sitting at certain position in the radial direction .    as an alternative gravity dual to the strongly interacting qcd plasma",
    ", we also consider sakai - sugimoto model  @xcite in this article .",
    "the dual gauge theory is the maximally supersymmetric gauge theory in 5 dimensions  ( with one dimension compactified ) .",
    "it contains chiral quarks and a natural description of the deconfinement and chiral symmetry breaking transitions .",
    "the open - string excitations connecting the ( anti-)d8-branes to the d4-branes are identified as heavy quarks .",
    "using this model , we recalculate the screening lengths incorporating angular momentum of the classical string , and compare with the ones obtained from the @xmath23 gravitational background .",
    "a few comments on drag force and energy loss in this gravity dual and in typical @xmath1 are made .",
    "we note the different temperature dependences due to the dimensional t  hooft coupling in 5 dimensional gauge theory .",
    "the article is organized as the following . in section",
    "ii , we describe the general setup for both gravity duals , and write down the equation of motion for the classical rotating connected - string configuration . in section iii",
    ", we numerically estimate the screening lengths in both gravity duals and discuss the characteristics of the meson `` melting '' in the quark - gluon plasma .",
    "finally , calculations of the drag force , energy loss , and relaxation times have been performed in section iv .",
    "section v is the conclusions and discussions .",
    "to calculate the potential between the static quark and antiquark pair at the finite temperature , one can use a schwarzschild - anti - de sitter type ii@xmath19 supergravity compactification  @xcite .",
    "however one may consider the more general situation where the quark and antiquark are rotating in the deconfined quark - gluon plasma .",
    "the bound state of quark and antiquark with rotation corresponds to the meson with angular momentum . in order to calculate the potential between the rotating quark and antiquark pair",
    ", we will consider the following 5 dimensional metrics given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 @xmath26 is the radial direction , @xmath27 is the direction perpendicular to the plane of rotation and position of the horizon @xmath28 for @xmath29 respectively .",
    "the @xmath30 metric , known as sakai - sugimoto metric  @xcite  ( modulo details of the compact 5 dimensional manifold which we ignore here ) in the high temperature phase  @xcite , is the near - horizon limit of the metric induced by a configuration of @xmath18 d4-branes intersecting with @xmath31 d8-branes and @xmath31 anti - d8-branes .",
    "the ( anti-)d8-branes are located at @xmath32 of the compactified @xmath33 around which the d4-branes wrap . the string theory in this background is dual to the maximally supersymmetric @xmath34 yang - mills theory in @xmath35 dimensions with one dimension compactified on a circle with radius @xmath36 .",
    "the @xmath37 metric is the near - horizon limit of the metric induced by a configuration of @xmath38 d3-branes in the 1 + 9 dimensional background . in this limit ,",
    "the non - compact 5 dimensional subspace is approximately @xmath1 .",
    "the string theory in this background is dual to the supersymmetric @xmath17 yang - mills in 1 + 3 dimensions when the other compact 5 dimensional manifold is @xmath39 .",
    "the horizon in the gravity picture induces the scale and hawking temperature into the theory .",
    "the dual of these quantities in the gauge picture are @xmath40 and temperature of the quark - gluon plasma respectively .",
    "the nambu - goto action is given by @xmath41    in order to calculate the potential and solve the equation of motion , we assign the following _ ansatz _ for the rotating connected - string configuration , @xmath42    the nambu - goto action becomes @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the derivative on @xmath45 .",
    "now we can get the potential between quark and antiquark which is @xmath46 the conserved angular momentum can be written as @xmath47    the equation of motion for the connected - string configuration is @xmath48 the string ending on the probe brane is vertical to brane and the position is fixed to the position of brane . in order to solve the equation of motion numerically ,",
    "we impose the boundary condition @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the position of the probe brane , @xmath51 is the position of endpoints of the string . using the boundary conditions , we can solve this differential equation numerically for each value of @xmath52 to get the string configuration solution @xmath53 .",
    "then we use this solution to calculate the potential @xmath54 and the angular momentum @xmath55 .",
    "notice that both the potential and angular momentum depend on the angular frequency @xmath52 .",
    "we can see that the potential between the quark and antiquark will depend on the angular momentum @xmath0 after we eliminate @xmath52 from eqn .",
    "( [ eq : v ] ) and eqn .",
    "( [ eq : j ] ) .",
    "first , we will consider the simplest case when there is no rotation .",
    "the dual yang - mills state in this case will be the zero angular - momentum mesonic state . for @xmath56 the action @xmath57 with the simplified action , we have one more symmetry which could simplify our analysis by the use of the corresponding conserved quantity .",
    "since the lagrangian does not depend on @xmath58 explicitly , we have a constant of the motion @xmath59    then we can find the shape of the string which minimizes the action in terms of the relationship between @xmath60 and @xmath61 as @xmath62 leading to the distance between quark and antiquark @xmath63 where @xmath64 , and @xmath50 is position of the probe brane .",

    "at non - zero temperature , there will be certain distance between quark and antiquark such that the potential of the connected - string starts to be larger than the potential of the parallel strings configuration .",
    "therefore the distance signifies the dissociation of the quark antiquark system .",
    "it could be identified with the screening length of the meson in the gauge plasma .    for the parallel strings configuration ,",
    "we choose the following worldsheet gauge , @xmath66 where @xmath51 is the position of endpoints of the string .",

    "@xcite without mentioning the relaxation time and its temperature dependence .",
    "we emphasize that this non - universal behaviour of the drag forces and energy losses is due to the dependence on the t  hooft coupling of the quantities we are considering .",
    "we have considered two gravity duals of the non - abelian gauge theory in 1 + 3 dimension  ( after compactified the extra dimension ) .",
    "one is sakai - sugimoto model and another is the usual near - horizon metric @xmath1 .",
    "both metrics have horizons which induce scales and temperature into the dual theories .",
    "the angular momentum is incorporated into the analysis by rotation of the background metrics .",
    "this provides us with a quantitative way to calculate the screening lengths for varying angular momentum , as well as the temperature dependences of the screening length for non - zero angular momentum states .",
    "an interesting result is the fact that @xmath80 dependence of the screening lengths appears to be valid with good accuracy even for non - zero angular momentum states .",
    "a naive comparison  ( table  [ t2 ] ) to the melting of physical quarkonium states is performed and shown that both gravity duals , at least in the rotated approach , can not explain the surprising lattice results on the resistance to melt of the 1s charmonium states such as @xmath12 and @xmath137  @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the realistic melting of quarkonium is more complicated and could not probably be explained by consideration of the plasma after its formation alone in terms of the screening radius .",
    "however , the non-1s states such as @xmath138 seem to melt away both in lattice and by consideration of the screening length .",
    "it is not unnatural to wonder the same phenomenon would repeat for the bottomonia where @xmath139 melt but @xmath140 resist when submerged into the quark - gluon plasma .",
    "the drag forces in both gravity duals share the same aspect that they depend on positive power of the t  hooft couplings  ( @xmath141 ) .",
    "theoretically this shows that the relaxation times vanish in the large t  hooft limit @xmath142 , in other words , the quark - gluon plasma becomes extremely resistive against the quarks passing through .",
    "this is in contrast to the shear viscosity per entropy density value which approaches finite constant in the large @xmath128 limit due to the fact that it does not depend on the t  hooft coupling at the leading order  ( for @xmath1 ) .",
    "interestingly , the screening length in the @xmath81 limit for @xmath143 also share the same characteristic that it does not depend on the t  hooft coupling , and thus shows the same temperature dependence @xmath80 in both gravity duals .",
    "even though some phenomena such as the realistic `` melting '' of quarkonium are more complicated and require detailed understanding of the phase transitions in the qcd either from the lattice approach , or from other qcd methods , some `` universal '' aspects of the hot gauge plasma and the behaviour of quarkonium in the medium could be understood and even quantitatively predicted by analysis on the gravity duals of the strongly - coupled gauge theories .",
    "we hope that the results in this article would reveal more or less certain aspects of the quark - gluon plasma as well as providing some hints into the exact nature of this nuclear phase to be produced at the upcoming lhc .",
