    "our everyday way of looking at space - time as a stage for physical events conflicts with the requirement of defining all physical quantities  including space and time  through precise measurement protocols .",
    "this means that we should more properly regard space - time as emerging from events , instead of pre - existing them .",
    "the operational definition of space - time is defined by the protocol that sets up the coordinate system .",
    "for example , in the einstein protocol light pulses are sent back and forth between different locations : at the place where the signal has been originated , from the arrival time of the reflected signal one infers both the distance and the time of the remote event of signal - reflection .",
    "the protocol shows how space - time is indeed a coherent organization of inferences based on a causal structure for events .",
    "the clock itself is just a sequence of events  a light pulse bouncing between two mirrors .",
    "the closest are the mirrors , the more precise is the clock , and the more refined is the coordinate system .",
    "the above reasoning shows that ultimately space and time are defined through pure event - counting , precisely counting _ tic - tacs _ of the observer s clock , and we are thus lead to regard space and time as emergent from the topology of the causal network of events .",
    "the events of the network do not need to be regarded as actual , but can be just potential , and the fabric of space - time is precisely the network of causal links between them .",
    "the idea of deriving space - time from purely causal structures is not new .",
    "raphael sorkin started an independent research line in quantum gravity based on this idea more than two decades ago @xcite .",
    "this was motivated by the potentialities of the approach residing in the natural discreteness of the causal network , which also provides a history - space for a path integral formulation @xcite .",
    "the possibility of recovering the main features of the space - time manifold ",
    "topology , differentiable structure , and conformal metric  has been shown , starting from discrete sets of points endowed with a causal partial ordering @xcite .",
    "along these lines , in an operational context , lucien hardy has also formulated a _ causaloid _",
    "approach @xcite , which considers the possibility of a dynamical treatment of the causal links .    in the causal - set approach of sorkin events",
    "are randomly scattered in order to avoid occurrence of their sparseness in the boosted frames that would lead to violation of lorentz invariance .",
    "clearly the randomness of sorkin s events should not be regarded in terms of their location on a background , otherwise we contradict the same idea of space - time emergence .",
    "we then need to consider randomnes at the pure topological level , and this means having random causal connections .",
    "however , regarding the causal connections as an irreducible description of the physical law , a random topology would then corresponds to having a random physical law at the most microscopic level ( the planck scale ) , and one may argue that a `` random law '' would contradict the same notion of law .",
    "instead , the randomnes should results from the law itself , e.g. in a quantum cellular automaton , where randomness comes from quantum nature of the network .",
    "the universality of the physical law thus lead us to take the causal network as topologically homogeneous .",
    "topological homogeneity has then the added bonus that metric simply emerges from the pure topology by just counting events along the network .",
    "it is obvious that the discreteness of the network will lead to violation of lorenz covariance ( and the other space symmetries ) at the planck scale level : however , one must have a theory where covariance is restored in the large scale limit  the fermi scale  corresponding to counting huge numbers of events .    with the above motivations , in this paper we analyze the mechanism of emergence of space - time from the pure homogeneous topology in @xmath0 dimensions .",
    "we present a digital version of the lorentz transformations , along with the corresponding digital - analog conversion rule . upon considering the causal connections as exchanges of classical information",
    ", we can establish coordinate systems via an einsteinian protocol , leading to a digital version of the lorentz transformations . in a computational analogy first noticed by leslie lamport @xcite",
    ", the foliation construction can be regarded as the synchronization protocol with a global clock of the calls to independent subroutines ( the causally independent events ) in a parallel distributed computation .",
    "the boosts are determined by the relative lengths of the _ tic _ and _ tac _ of the clock , and the lorentz time - dilation corresponds to an increased number of leaves within a clock _ tic - tac _ , whereas space - contraction results from the corresponding decreased density of events per leaf , as first noticed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we will see that the operational procedure of building up the coordinate system introduces an in - principle indistinguishability between neighboring events , resulting in a network that is coarse - grained , the thickness of the event being a function of the observer s clock .",
    "the digital version of the lorentz transformation is an integer relation which differs from the usual analog transformation by a multiplicative real constant corresponding exactly to the event thickness .",
    "the composition rule for velocities is independent on such constant , and is the same in both the analog and the digital versions .",
    "preliminary results of the present work were already presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the illustrated simple classical construction can be extended to space dimension greater than one , but at the price of anisotropy of the maximal speed , due to the weyl - tiling problem .",
    "this issue is cured if the causal network is quantum , as e.g. in a quantum cellular automaton , and isotropy is recovered with quantum coherence , corresponding to superposition of causal paths .",
    "we will thus argue that in a causal network description of space - time , the quantum nature of the network is crucial .",
    "the first problem to address is which specific lattice should be adopted for the causal network . in our convention",
    "the causal arrow is directed from the bottom to the top of the network .",
    "the dimension of the emerging space - time corresponds to the graph - dimension of the network , which is the dimension of the embedding manifold such that all links can be taken as segments of straight line with the same length .",
    "we will require that the lattice be pure topology ( namely with all events equivalent ) , corresponding to a locally homogeneous space - time , and with no redundant links .",
    "it is then easy to see that in 1 + 1 dimensions there are only three possible lattices : the square , the triangular , and the honeycomb ones .",
    "the honeycomb - lattice has two inequivalent types of events ( having one input and two output links and viceversa ) , and the corresponding `` undressed '' topology  where each couple of connected inequivalent events are merged into a single event  reduces to the square lattice .",
    "the triangular - lattice , on the other hand , has redundant causal links ( the middle vertical ones ) .",
    "we are thus left with the square - lattice .",
    "we always assume the network links as oriented according to the causal arrow . in the square - lattice network",
    "there are thus two types of link : toward the right and toward the left ",
    "shortly _ r_-link and _ l_-link .",
    "two events are in the same position ( for some boosted reference frame ) if they are connected by a path made with a sequence of _ r_-links followed by a sequence of _ l_-links .",
    "when the two sequences contain the same number of links the reference is at rest .",
    "a clock is a sequence of causally connected events periodically oscillating between two positions . for an einstein clock the oscillation ( _ tic - tac _ ) is exactly the same couple of sequences of _ l_- and _ _ r-__links identifying events in the same position .",
    "the precision of the clock , namely the minimum amount of time that it can measure , is the number of links of a complete _ tic - tac_. the _ tic - tac _ is indivisible , namely the sole _ tic _ ( or _ tac _ ) is not a complete measured time interval , since it involves two different positions .     and @xmath1 ( see text ) . from the left to the right",
    "we have the rest - frame clock , clock corresponding to @xmath2 , and boosted - frames for @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 , respectively , corresponding to digital speed @xmath6 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "the case @xmath4 has doubled imprecision , compared to the case @xmath3 .",

    "r_-links or by _ _",
    "l-__links , namely making segments at 45 degrees with the horizontal in the network .",
    "their `` speed '' is equal to `` one event - per - step '' , and is the maximum speed allowed by the causality of the network , since connecting events along a line making an angle smaller than @xmath8 with the horizontal would require to follow some causal connections in the backward direction from the output to the input",
    ". in this way in a homogeneous causal network suffices to guarantee a bound for the speed of information flow .    in the following",
