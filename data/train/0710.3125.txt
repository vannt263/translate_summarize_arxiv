    "the cosmic ray ( cr ) spectrum is characterized by a sharply falling power law behaviour , @xmath0@xcite .",
    "the spectrum gets more steeper around @xmath1 gev with the spectral index @xmath2 changing from @xmath3 to @xmath4 - this region is called the _ knee_. around @xmath5 gev , one observes a flattening of the spectrum , with the spectral index @xmath2 falling between @xmath6 and @xmath3 .",
    "this is the so called _",
    "ankle_. these two breaks of the primary spectrum are still open questions of cr physics .",
    "the region beyond the ankle is the regime of ultra high energy cosmic rays .",
    "there is not much data available in that region and no clear consensus exists on the composition or the particle content in this region @xcite .",
    "it is generally believed that the change in the slope around the knee is astrophysical in nature rather than any specific change in hadronic properties and/or interactions  @xcite .",
    "an overview of hadronic interactions and cosmic rays can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the atmospheric muon flux originated from decays of pions and kaons is commonly called the _ conventional muon _ flux .",
    "there is expected rather sharp reduction of the conventional muon flux above a few tev @xcite due to the increasing decay lengths and decreasing interaction lengths of pions and kaons .",
    "therefore , at very high energies the bulk of muons is expected to arise from the semileptonic decay modes of heavy shortlived hadrons , predominantly the charmed ones .",
    "this component is called the _",
    "prompt muons_. it is known that the prompt muon flux is only about @xmath7 smaller than the prompt @xmath8 flux at the surface of the earth . therefore , measurement of the atmospheric prompt muon ( apm ) flux at high energies will ensure a normalization for the atmospheric prompt neutrino ( apn ) flux , and a direct comparison of the two is both desirable and necessary .",
    "this study is necessary because the atmospheric neutrino flux is unavoidable background to vhe neutrino experiments .",
    "there are sizeable uncertainties in theoretical predictions for the prompt lepton fluxes ( see  @xcite for review ) .",
    "the reason is mainly due to the vastly different choices for the charm production cross - section  perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) with a @xmath9 factor @xcite , next - to - leading order ( nlo ) pqcd @xcite , phenomenological nonperturbative approach , such as the recombination quark - parton model ( rqpm ) or quark - gluon string model ( qgsm )  @xcite .",
    "the experimental situation is not very precise either at this stage .",
    "various experiments  @xcite provide upper limits on the apm fluxes in the energy range of interest , which allow a large variation in the prompt fluxes .",
    "one can therefore expect that better measurements of high - energy muon fluxes can play a definitive role in selecting the charm production models , and thereby , also providing invaluable information about parton densities at such low-@xmath10 and high energy values .",
    "another related source of large theoretical uncertainties is strong dependence of the hadronic cross - sections on the renormalization and factorization scales .",
    "this is partly related to the naive extrapolation of parton distribution functions to very different energy and @xmath10-values . for the case of conventional fluxes originating from the pions and kaons ,",
    "these issues are in much better control and therefore the predictions stand on a sound footing .",
    "earlier authors of ref .",
    "@xcite explored the possibility of utilizing the high energy prompt muon flux(es ) in order to investigate whether the general expectations expressed above can in practice help in selecting the charm production model / parameterization and also the importance of the heavy composition of cosmic rays above knee .",
    "they chose some of the models often used and compare the predictions , incorporating the saturation model of golec - biernat and wuthsoff  @xcite .",
    "however while esimating their event rates of muons in a 50 kt iron detector like ino one  @xcite they did not consider the angular dependence of the muon fluxes at rock depth .",
    "angular dependence of muon flux due to surrounding rock is really important for correct estimation of the muon event rate inside such a detector . in this work",
    "we calculate the high - enery am flux , conventional as well as prompt , at ino rock depth taking into account the distortion in the surface muon zenith - angle distribution due to specific topography of the ino site .",
    "it is therefore quite clear from all these models that the lepton fluxes at the end are strongly sensitive to the charm production cross section . till the knee ,",
    "the cosmic ray flux and composition is rather established and therefore , the only source of large error is the charm cross section .",
    "this therefore gives us a unique possibility to gain information about heavy quark production mechanism at high energies and low @xmath10 .",
    "the slant depth @xmath11 depends on the topography of the rock surrounding the ino detector .",
    "pushep is the selected site for this purpose .",
    "one can assume a constant depth which is equal to the vertical depth just above the cavern .",
    "the vertical depth of pushep site is 1.3 km of rock .",
    "another assumption is that of a triangle topogarphy . in this case",
    "the slant depth for given zenith angle @xmath12 is calculated as @xmath13 where @xmath14 km is the vertical depth , @xmath15 km is the half - length of the approach tunnel and @xmath16 is the slope of the mountain .",
