    "it took more than eighty years from its discovery till it was possible to experimentally determine and visualize the most fundamental object in quantum mechanics , the wave function . the forward route from quantum state",
    "to probability distribution of measurement results has been the basic stuff of quantum mechanics textbooks for decennia . that the corresponding mathematical inverse problem had a solution , provided ( speaking metaphorically ) that the quantum state has been probed from a sufficiently rich set of directions , had also been known for many years .",
    "however it was only with @xcite , that it became feasible to actually carry out the corresponding measurements on one particular quantum system  in that case , the state of one mode of electromagnetic radiation ( a pulse of laser light at a given frequency ) .",
    "experimentalists have used the technique to establish that they have succeeded in creating non - classical forms of laser light such as squeezed light and schrdinger cats .",
    "the experimental technique we are referring to here is called quantum homodyne tomography : the word homodyne referring to a comparison between the light being measured with a reference light beam at the same frequency .",
    "we will explain the word tomography in a moment .",
    "the quantum state can be represented mathematically in many different but equivalent ways , all of them linear transformations on one another .",
    "one favorite is as the wigner function @xmath0 : a real function of two variables , integrating to plus one over the whole plane , but not necessarily nonnegative .",
    "it can be thought of as a `` generalized joint probability density '' of the electric and magnetic fields , @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "however one can not measure both fields at the same time and in quantum mechanics it makes no sense to talk about the values of both electric and magnetic fields simultaneously .",
    "it does , however , make sense to talk about the value of any linear combination of the two fields , say @xmath3 . and",
    "one way to think about the statistical problem is as follows : the unknown parameter is a joint probability density @xmath0 of two variables @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the data consists of independent samples from the distribution of @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is chosen independently of @xmath8 , and uniformly in the interval @xmath9 $ ] .",
    "write down the mathematical model expressing the joint density of @xmath10 in terms of that of @xmath8 .",
    "now just allow that latter joint density , @xmath0 , to take negative as well as positive values ( subject to certain restrictions which we will mention later ) . and",
    "that is the statistical problem of this paper .",
    "this is indeed a classical tomography problem : we take observations from all possible one - dimensional projections of a two - dimensional density .",
    "the non - classical feature is that though all these one - dimensional projections are indeed bona - fide probability densities , the underlying two - dimensional `` joint density '' need not itself be a bona - fide joint probability density , but can have small patches of `` negative probability '' .",
    "though the parameter to be estimated may look strange from some points of view , it is mathematically very nice from others .",
    "for instance , one can also represent it by a matrix of ( a kind of ) fourier coefficients : one speaks then of the `` density matrix '' @xmath11 .",
    "this is an infinite dimensional matrix of complex numbers , but it is a positive and selfadjoint matrix with trace one .",
    "the diagonal elements are real numbers summing up to one , and forming the probability distribution of the number of photons found in the light beam ( if one could do that measurement ) .",
    "conversely , any such matrix @xmath11 corresponds to a physically possible wigner function @xmath0 , so we have here a concise mathematical characterization of precisely which `` generalized joint probability densities '' can occur .",
    "the initial reconstructions were done by borrowing analytic techniques from classical tomography ",
    "the data was binned and smoothed , the inverse radon transform carried out , followed by some fourier transformations . at each of a number of steps ,",
    "there are numerical discretization and truncation errors .",
    "the histogram of the data will not lie in the range of the forward transformation ( from quantum state to density of the data ) .",
    "thus the result of blindly applying an inverse will not be a bona - fide wigner function or density matrix .",
    "moreover the various numerical approximations all involve arbitrary choices of smoothing , binning or truncation parameters .",
    "consequently the final picture can look just how the experimenter would like it to look and there is no way to statistically evaluate the reliability of the result . on the other hand the various numerical approximations tend to destroy the interesting `` quantum '' features the experimenter is looking for , so this method lost in popularity after the initial enthousiasm .",
    "so far there has been little attention paid to this problem by statisticians , although on the one hand it is an important statistical problem coming up in modern physics , and on the other hand it is `` just '' a classical nonparametric statistical inverse problem .",
    "the unknown parameter is some object @xmath11 , or if you prefer @xmath0 , lying in an infinite dimensional linear space ( the space of density matrices , or the space of wigner functions ; these are just two concrete representations in which the experimenter has particular interest ) .",
    "the data has a probability distribution which is a linear transform of the parameter . considered as an analytical problem , we have an ill - posed inverse problem , but one which has a lot of beautiful mathematical structure and about which a lot is known ( for instance , close connection to the radon transform ) .",
    "moreover it has features in common with nonparametric missing data problems ( the projections from bivariate to univariate , for instance , and there are more connections we will mention later ) and with nonparametric density and regression estimation .",
    "thus we think that the time is ripe for this problem to be `` cracked '' by mathematical and computational statisticians . in this paper",
    "we will present some first steps in that direction .",
    "our main theoretical results are consistency theorems for two estimators .",
    "both estimators are based on approximating the infinite dimensional parameter @xmath11 by a finite dimensional parameter , in fact , thinking of @xmath11 as an infinite dimensional matrix , we simply truncate it to an @xmath12 matrix where the truncation level @xmath13 will be allowed to grow with the number of observations @xmath14 .",
    "the first estimator employs some analytical inverse formulas expressing the elements of @xmath11 as mean values of certain functions , called pattern functions , of the observations @xmath10 .",
    "simply replace the theoretical means by empirical averages and one has unbiased estimators of the elements of @xmath11 , with moreover finite variance . if one applies this technique without truncation the estimate of the matrix @xmath11 as a whole will typically not satisfy the nonnegativity constraints .",
    "the resulting estimator will not be consistent either , with respect to natural distance measures . but provided the truncation level grows with @xmath14 slowly enough , the overall estimator will be consistent .",
    "the effect of truncating the density matrix @xmath11 is to project on the subspace generated by the first elements of the corresponding basis , we shall call it the pattern function projection estimator ( pfp ) .",
    "the second estimator we study is sieve maximum likelihood ( sml ) based on the same truncation to a finite dimensional problem .",
    "the truncation level @xmath13 has to depend on sample size @xmath14 in order to balance bias and variance .",
    "we prove consistency of the sml estimator under an appropriate choice of @xmath15 by applying a general theorem of @xcite .",
    "to verify the conditions we need to bound certain metric entropy integrals ( with bracketing ) which express the size of the statistical model under study .",
    "this turns out to be feasible , and indeed to have an elegant solution , by exploiting features of the mapping from parameters ( density matrices ) to distributions of the data .",
    "various distances between probability distributions possess analogues as distances between density matrices , the mapping from parameter to data turns out to be a contraction , so we can bound metric entropies for the statistical model for the data with quantum metric entropies for the class of density matrices . and the latter can be calculated quite conveniently .",
    "our results form just a first attempt at studying the statistical properties of estimators which are already being used by experimental physicists , but they show that the basic problem is both rich in interesting features and tractable to analysis .",
    "the main results so far are consistency theorems for pfp and sml estimators , of both the density matrix and the wigner function .",
    "these results depend on an assumption of the rate at which a truncated density matrix approximates the true one .",
    "it seems that the assumption is satisfied for the kinds of states which are met with in practice .",
    "however , further work is needed here to describe in physically interpretable terms , when the estimators work .",
    "secondly , we need to obtain rates of consistency and to further optimize the construction of the estimator .",
    "thirdly , one should explore the properties of penalized maximum likelihood .",
    "this will make the truncation level data driven .",
    "fourthly , one should try to make the estimators adaptive with respect to the smoothness of the parameter .",
    "we largely restrict attention to an ideal case of the problem where there is no further noise in the measurements . in practice , the observations have added to them gaussian disturbances of known variance .",
    "there are some indications that when the variance is larger than a threshold of @xmath16 , reconstruction becomes qualitatively much more difficult .",
    "this needs to be researched from the point of view of optimal rates of convergence .",
    "we also only considered one particular though quite convenient way of sieving the model , i.e. , one particular class of finite dimensional approximations .",
    "there are many other possibilities and some of them might allow easier analysis and easier computation .",
    "for instance , instead of truncating the matrix @xmath11 in a given basis , one could truncate in an arbitrary basis , so that the finite dimensional approximations would correspond to specifying @xmath13 arbitrary state vectors and a probability distribution over these `` pure states '' .",
    "now the problem has become a missing data problem , where the `` full data '' would assign to each observation also the label of the pure state from which it came .",
    "in the full data problem we need to reconstruct not a matrix but a set of vectors , together with an ordinary probability distribution over the set , so the `` full data '' problem is statistically speaking a much easier problem that the missing data problem .",
    "we shall use a version of this to derive an expectation - maximization algorithm ( em ) for the practical implementation of the sml estimator , see section [ sec.experimental ] .",
    "one could imagine that bayesian reconstruction methods could also exploit this structure .",
    "the analogy with density estimation could suggest new statistical approaches here .",
    "finally , it is most important to add to the estimated parameter , estimates of its accuracy .",
    "this is absolutely vital for applications , but so far no valid approach is available .    in section [ sec.problem ]",
    "we introduce first , very briefly , the statistical problems we are concerned with .",
    "we then give a short review of the basic notions of quantum mechanics which are needed in this paper .",
    "concepts such as observables , states , measurements and quantum state tomography are explained by using finite dimensional complex matrices . at the end of the section",
    "we show how to generalize this to the infinite dimensional case and describe the experimental set - up of quantum homodyne detection pointing out the relation with computerized tomography .    in section [ sec.densitymatrixestimation ] we present results on consistency of density matrix estimators : projection estimator based on pattern functions , and sieve maximum likelihood estimator .",
    "the last subsection extends the results of the previous ones to estimating the wigner function .",
    "section [ sec.efficiency ] deals with the detection losses occurring in experiments due in part to the inefficiency of the detectors .",
    "this adds a deconvolution problem on the top of our tomography estimation .",
    "section [ sec.experimental ] shows experimental results .",
    "we illustrate the behavior of the studied estimators and propose some practical tools for the implementation  em algorithm .",
    "the last section finishes with some concluding remarks to the whole paper and open problems .",
    "the main purpose of the paper is to bring the attention of the statistical community to these problem ; thus , some proofs are just sketched .",
    "they fully appear in a complementary paper , @xcite .",
    "our statistical problem is to reconstruct the quantum state of light by using data obtained from measuring identical pulses of light through a technique called quantum homodyne detection ( qhd ) . in particular we will estimate the quantum state in two different representations or parameterizations : the density matrix and the wigner function .",
    "the physics behind this statistical problem is presented in subsection [ sec.qmeasurements ] which serves as introduction to basic notions of quantum theory , and subsection [ sec.qhomodyne ] which describes the model of quantum homodyne detection from quantum optics .",
    "the relations between the different parameters of the problem are summarized in the diagram at the end of subsection [ sec.qhomodyne ] followed by table [ tbl.states ] containing some examples of quantum states . for the reader",
    "who is not interested in the quantum physics background we state the statistical problem in the next subsection and we will return to it in section [ sec.densitymatrixestimation ] .      we observe @xmath17 , i.i.d .",
    "random variables with values in @xmath18 $ ] and distribution @xmath19 depending on the unknown parameter @xmath11 which is an infinite dimensional matrix @xmath20_{j , k=0,\\ldots,\\infty}$ ] such that @xmath21 ( trace one ) and @xmath22 ( positive definite ) .",
    "the probability density of @xmath19 is @xmath23 where the functions @xmath24 to be specified later , form a orthonormal basis of the space of complex square integrable functions on @xmath25 . because @xmath11 is positive definite and has trace @xmath26 , this is a probability density : real , nonnegative , integrates to @xmath26 . the data @xmath27 comes from independent qhd measurements on identically prepared pulses of light whose properties or state are completely encoded in the matrix @xmath11 called a density matrix .",
    "we will consider the problem of estimating @xmath11 from a given sample .",
    "previous attempts by physicists to estimate the density matrix @xmath11 have focused mainly on the estimation of the individual matrix elements without considering the accuracy of the estimated density matrix with respect to natural distances of the underlying parameter space . in section [ sec.densitymatrixestimation ]",
    "we will present consistency results in the space of density matrices w.r.t . @xmath28 and @xmath29-norms using two different types of estimators , namely projection and sieve maximum likelihood estimators .",
    "an alternative representation of the quantum state is through the wigner function @xmath30 whose estimation is close to a classical computer tomography problem namely , positron emission tomography ( pet ) , @xcite . in pet",
    "one would like to estimate a probability density @xmath31 on @xmath32 from i.i.d .",
    "observations @xmath33 , with probability density equal to the radon transform of @xmath31 : @xmath34(x,\\phi)=\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty   f(x\\cos\\phi+t\\sin\\phi , x\\sin\\phi - t\\cos\\phi)dt.\\ ] ] although the wigner function is in general _ not _ positive , its radon transform is always a probability density , in fact @xmath35(x,\\phi ) = p_\\rho(x,\\phi)$ ] .",
    "as the wigner function @xmath36 is in one - to - one correspondence with the density matrix @xmath11 , our state reconstruction problem can be stated as to estimate the wigner function @xmath37 .",
    "this is an ill posed inverse problem as seen from the formula for the inverse of the radon transform @xmath38 where @xmath39 makes sense only as a generalized function . to correct",
    "this one usually makes a cut - off in the range of the above integral and gets a well behaved kernel function @xmath40 .",
    "then the tomographic estimator of @xmath37 is the average sampled kernel @xmath41 for consistency one needs to let the ` bandwidth ' @xmath42 depend on the sample size @xmath14 and @xmath43 as @xmath44 at an appropriate rate .    in this paper",
    "we will not follow this approach , which will be treated separately in future work . instead",
    ", we use a plug - in type estimator based on the property @xmath45 where @xmath46 s are known functions and we replace @xmath11 by its above mentioned estimators",
    ". we shall prove consistency of the proposed estimators of the wigner function w.  r.  t.  @xmath29 and supremum norms in the corresponding space .",
    "this subsection serves as a short introduction to the basic notions of quantum mechanics which will be needed in this paper . for simplicity",
    "we will deal first with finite dimensional quantum systems and leave the infinite dimensional case for the next subsection . for further details on quantum statistical inference",
    "we refer to the review and the classic textbooks @xcite and @xcite .    in classical mechanics the state of macroscopic systems like billiard balls , pendulums or stellar systems",
    "is described by points on a manifold or `` phase space '' , each of the point s coordinates corresponding to an attribute which we can measure such as position and momentum .",
    "therefore the functions on the phase space are called observables .",
    "when there exists uncertainty about the exact point in the phase space , or we deal with a statistical ensemble , the state is modelled by a probability distribution on the phase space , and the observables become random variables .",
    "quantum mechanics also deals with observables such as position and momentum of a particle , spin of an electron , number of photons in a cavity , but breaks from classical mechanics in that these are no longer represented by functions on a phase space but by hermitian matrices , that is , complex valued matrices which are invariant under transposition followed by complex conjugation .",
    "for example , the components in different directions of the spin of an electron are certain @xmath47 complex hermitian matrices @xmath48 .",
    "any @xmath49-dimensional complex hermitian matrix @xmath50 can be diagonalized by changing the standard basis of @xmath51 to another orthonormal basis @xmath52 such that @xmath53 for @xmath54 , with @xmath55 .",
    "the vectors @xmath56 and numbers @xmath57 are called eigenvectors and respectively eigenvalues of @xmath50 . with respect to the new basis",
    "we can write @xmath58 the physical interpretation of the eigenvalues is that when measuring the observable @xmath50 we obtain ( randomly ) one of the values @xmath57 according to a probability distribution depending on the state of the system before measurement and on the observable @xmath50 .",
    "this probability measure is degenerate if and only if the system before measurement was prepared in a special state called an eigenstate of @xmath50 .",
    "we represent such a state mathematically by the projection @xmath59 onto the one dimensional space generated by the vector @xmath56 in @xmath51 . given a probability distribution @xmath60 over the finite set @xmath61 , we describe a statistical ensemble in which a proportion @xmath62 of systems is prepared in the state @xmath59 by the convex combination @xmath63 .",
    "the expected value of the random result @xmath64 when measuring the observable @xmath50 for this particular state is equal to @xmath65 which can be written shortly @xmath66 similarly , the probability distribution can be recovered as @xmath67 thanks to the orthogonality property @xmath68 .",
    "now , let @xmath69 be a different observable and suppose that @xmath69 does not commute with @xmath50 , that is @xmath70 , then the two observables can not be diagonalized in the same basis , their eigenvectors are different .",
    "consequently , states which are mixtures of eigenvectors of @xmath50 typically will not be mixtures of eigenvectors of @xmath69 and vice - versa .",
    "this leads to an expanded formulation of the notion of state in quantum mechanics independent of any basis associated to a particular observable , and the recipe for calculating expectations and distributions of measurement results .",
    "any preparation procedure results in an statistical ensemble , or state , which is described mathematically by a matrix @xmath11 with the following properties    1 .",
    "@xmath22 ( positive definite matrix ) , 2 .",
    "@xmath71 ( normalization ) .    in physics @xmath72 is called a _ density matrix _ , and is for a quantum mechanical system an analogue of a probability density .",
    "notice that the special state @xmath73 defined above is a particular case of density matrix , since it is a mixture of eigenstates of the observable @xmath50 .",
    "the density matrices of dimension @xmath49 form a convex set @xmath74 , whose extremals are the _ pure _ or _ vector _ states , represented by orthogonal projections @xmath75 onto one dimensional spaces spanned by _ arbitrary _",
    "vectors @xmath76 .",
    "any state can be represented as a mixture of pure states which are not necessarily eigenstates of a particular observable .    when measuring an observable , for example @xmath50 , of a quantum system prepared in the state @xmath11 we obtain a random result @xmath77 with probability distribution given by equation ( [ eq.quantumprobability ] ) , expectation as in equation ( [ eq.quantumexpectation ] ) , and characteristic function @xmath78 in order to avoid confusion we stress the important difference between @xmath50 which is a matrix and @xmath64 which is a real - valued random variable . more concretely ,",
    "if we write @xmath11 in the basis of eigenvectors of @xmath50 then we obtain the map @xmath79 from states to probability distributions @xmath80 over results @xmath81 @xmath82 notice that @xmath83 is indeed a probability distribution as a consequence of the defining properties of states , and it does not contain information about the off - diagonal elements of @xmath11 , meaning that measuring only the observable @xmath50 is not enough to identify the unknown state . roughly speaking , as @xmath84 , one has to measure on many identical systems each one of a number of @xmath85 mutually non - commuting observables in order to have a one - to - one map between states and probability distributions of results .",
    "the probing of identically prepared quantum systems from different ` angles ' in order to reconstruct their state is broadly named _",
    "quantum state tomography _ in the physics literature .",
    "let us suppose that we have at our disposal @xmath14 systems identically prepared in an unknown state @xmath86 , and for each of the systems we can measure one of the fixed observables @xmath87 .",
    "we write the observables in diagonal form @xmath88 where @xmath89 eigenvalues and @xmath90 eigenstates .",
    "we will perform a randomized experiment , i.e.  for each system we will choose the observable to be measured by randomly selecting its index according to a probability distribution @xmath91 over @xmath92 .",
    "the results of the measurement on the @xmath93 system are the pair @xmath94 where @xmath95 are i.i.d .",
    "with probability distribution @xmath96 and @xmath97 is the result of measuring the observable @xmath98 whose conditional distribution is given by @xmath99 the statistical problem is now to estimate the parameter @xmath11 from the data @xmath100 . in the next subsection",
    "we will describe quantum homodyne tomography as an analogue of this problem for infinite dimensional systems .",
    "although correct and sufficient when describing certain quantum properties such as the spin of a particle , the model presented above needs to be enlarged in order to cope with quantum systems with ` continuous variables ' which will be central in our statistical problem .",
    "this technical point can be summarized as follows : we replace @xmath51 by an infinite dimensional complex hilbert space @xmath101 , the hermitian matrices becoming _ selfadjoint operators _ acting on @xmath101 .",
    "the spectral theorem tells us that selfadjoint operators can be ` diagonalized ' in the spirit of ( [ eq.diagonalization ] ) but the spectrum ( the set of ` eigenvalues ' ) can have a more complicated structure , for example it can be continuous as we will see below .",
    "the density matrices are _ positive _ selfadjoint operators @xmath102 such that @xmath71 and can be regarded as infinite dimensional matrices with elements @xmath103 for a given orthonormal basis @xmath104 in @xmath101 .",
    "the central example of a system with continuous variables in this paper is the quantum particle .",
    "its basic observables position and momentum , are two unbounded selfadjoint operators @xmath105 and @xmath106 respectively , acting on @xmath107 , the space of square integrable complex valued functions on @xmath108 @xmath109 for @xmath110 arbitrary functions .",
    "the operators satisfy heisenberg s _ commutation relations _ @xmath111 which implies that they can not be measured simultaneously .",
    "the problem of ( separately ) measuring such observables has been elusive until ten years ago when pioneering experiments in quantum optics by @xcite , led to a powerful measurement technique called _ quantum homodyne detection_. this technique is the basis of a continuous analogue of the measurement scheme presented at the end of the previous subsection where @xmath85 observables were measured in the case of a @xmath49-dimensional quantum system .",
    "the quantum system to be measured is a beam of light with a fixed frequency whose observables are the electric and magnetic field amplitudes which satisfy commutation relations identical to those characterizing the quantum particle , with which they will be identified from now on .",
    "their linear combinations @xmath112 are called _ quadratures _ , and homodyne detection is about measuring the quadratures for _ all _ phases @xmath113 $ ] . the experimental setup shown in figure [ fig.qhtomography ] contains an additional laser called a local oscillator ( lo ) of high intensity @xmath114 and relative phase @xmath115 with respect to the beam in the unknown state @xmath11 .",
    "the two beams are combined through a fifty - fifty beam splitter , and the two emerging beams are then measured by two photon detectors .",
    "a simple quantum optics computation ( see @xcite ) shows that in the limit of big lo intensity the difference of the measurement results ( countings ) of the two detectors rescaled by the lo intensity @xmath116 has the probability distribution corresponding to the measurement of the quadrature @xmath117 .",
    "the result @xmath64 takes values in @xmath108 and its probability distribution @xmath118 has a density @xmath119 and characteristic function ( see equation ( [ eq.generating.function ] ) ) @xmath120 the phase @xmath115 can be controlled by the experimenter by adjusting a parameter of the local oscillator .",
    "we assume that he chooses it randomly uniformly distributed over the interval @xmath9 $ ] .",
    "then the joint probability distribution @xmath19 for the pair consisting in measurement result and phase @xmath121 has density @xmath122 equal to @xmath123 with respect to the measure @xmath124 on @xmath125 $ ]",
    ". an attractive feature of the homodyne detection scheme is the invertibility of the map @xmath126 that associates @xmath19 to @xmath11 , making it possible to asymptotically infer the unknown parameter @xmath11 from the i.i.d .",
    "results @xmath127 of homodyne measurements on @xmath14 systems prepared in the state @xmath11 .",
    "we will see now why this state estimation method is called _ quantum homodyne tomography _ by drawing a parallel with computerized tomography used in the hospitals . in quantum optics",
    "it is common to represent the state of a quantum system by a certain function on @xmath128 called the _ wigner function _",
