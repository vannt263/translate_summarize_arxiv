    "i explained how to generalize this result to perturbation theory about a smooth component @xmath6 of the moduli space of flat connections .",
    "specifically , i proved the following theorem .",
    "let @xmath6 be a smooth component of the moduli space of flat connections on @xmath11 .",
    "then chern - simons perturbation theory about @xmath6 defines a differential invariant @xmath12 depending on the choice of @xmath8 and @xmath6 .",
    "let @xmath13 be the set of all flat connections on @xmath10 representing elements of @xmath6 .",
    "our smoothness assumption on @xmath6 includes the requirement that @xmath14 be a smooth bundle ( with fibers a homogeneous space @xmath15 ) and that the tangent space @xmath16 to @xmath13 at a point @xmath17 be equal to the deformation tangent space , that is , the kernel of the exterior derivative operator acting on the space @xmath18 of @xmath19-forms on @xmath8 with values in the adjoint bundle associated to @xmath10 .",
    "the ring , @xmath20 , of perturbation series is the ring generated by formal power series in @xmath21 , fractional powers of @xmath0 , and oscillatory exponentials in @xmath0 of the form @xmath22 . since @xmath0 only takes on integer values , @xmath23 is an element of @xmath24 .",
    "let us explain our strategy for arriving at a definition of `` chern  simons perturbation theory about @xmath6 '' . to begin , we consider a finite dimensional integral of the form @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a morse - bott function , and @xmath2 is a smooth measure on a manifold @xmath27 , both of which are invariant under the action of a compact symmetry group @xmath28 with a bi - invariant volume form of total volume @xmath29 . using a partition of unity",
    ", we can break up the above integral into a sum of contributions from the integral near each of the components of the critical point set of @xmath3 and a contribution from the integral away from the critical point set .",
    "the large @xmath0 asympotics of the latter vanish faster than any power of @xmath0 .",
    "the large @xmath0 asymptotics of the integral  near a component @xmath13 of the critical point set is what we mean by `` perturbation theory '' about @xmath13 .",
    "since we can also think of the integral as an integral over @xmath30 , we can equally well speak of this as perturbation theory about the quotient space @xmath31 . for this finite dimensional integral",
    ", the stationary phase approximation yields an algorithm to calculate perturbation theory near @xmath13 .",
    "for simplicity , we assume @xmath27 , @xmath13 , and @xmath6 are oriented so that a smooth measure on any of these spaces is just a smooth top form .",
    "the challenge is to formulate the stationary phase approximation computing the large @xmath0 asymptotics of  in a way such that the result can be generalized to the case of chern ",
    "simons theory where the space @xmath27 becomes the infinite dimensional space of connections on a principal bundle @xmath10 , the group @xmath28 becomes the group of base preserving automorphisms of @xmath10 , the morse - bott function @xmath3 becomes the chern ",
    "simons functional , @xmath6 is a smooth component of the moduli space of flat connections on @xmath10 , and @xmath0 is a positive integer called the level of the theory .",
    "the generalization of the stationary phase algorithm to the field theory case involves integrals over multiple copies of the spacetime manifold @xmath8 . in most quantum field theories",
    "these integrals diverge and one has to perform the procedure of perturbative regularization and renormalization .",
    "fortunately , just as in @xcite , it is possible to package the finite dimensional answer in such a way that its generalization to the chern - simons case involves only convergent integrals .",
    "( for experts , there is a single point - splitting regularization one must introduce for the `` tad - pole '' . ) to formulate a concrete algorithm to compute the perturbation theory in the case of a finite dimensional integral , we need to pick a metric @xmath32 in the space @xmath33 of @xmath28 invariant metrics on @xmath27 .",
    "the result , however , is _ a priori _ independent of @xmath32 because the integral  that one is calculating the asymptotics of does not depend on @xmath32 . in the chern ",
    "simons case , the space @xmath33 will denote the space of riemannian metrics on @xmath8 , each of which determines a @xmath28 invariant metric on the space @xmath27 of connections .",
    "the difficulty is that there is no _ a priori _ proof of the independence of @xmath32 in the chern ",
    "simons case since the functional integral is ill - defined .",
    "what we do is formulate not only the algorithm to compute the stationary phase approximation but also a proof of independence of @xmath32 in the finite dimensional case in a way that can be carried over to the quantum field theory problem .    to calculate the stationary phase approximation in the finite dimensional case",
    "what one has to do is to first integrate over the directions normal to the set @xmath13 of critical points of @xmath3 and then to subsequently integrate over @xmath13 .",
    "the standard method of stationary phase about an isolated critical point ( as for example captured in the feynman rules described in the appendix ) applies to the integral in the normal directions . to do this properly",
    "however , one needs to carefully keep track of what happens to the differential forms as one makes the split between the normal directions and the directions tangent to @xmath13 .",
    "we pick a metric @xmath34 in order to identify `` normal directions '' with directions orthogonal to the tangent space of @xmath13 . to have a mechanism to keep track of the dependence on the metric",
    ", we introduce the evaluation map @xmath35 here @xmath36 is the normal bundle to @xmath13 in @xmath27 .",
    "the fiber of the bundle @xmath37 above a point @xmath38 is just the orthocomplement of the subspace @xmath16 in @xmath39 with respect to the metric @xmath32 .",
    "the evaluation map takes an element @xmath40 of this space and sends it to the point determined by the exponential map coming from the geodesic flow from @xmath32 , i.e. @xmath41 for brevity , we will write @xmath42 for @xmath43 , @xmath44 for @xmath45 , and @xmath46 for @xmath47 . in general , objects adorned with a hat fiber over @xmath33 or depend on a choice of @xmath34 .",
    "in addition , to get a formula that will be well defined and not involve infinite dimensional integrals in the chern  simons example , we must make use of invariance under the group @xmath28 to replace the ill - defined integral over the infinite dimensional space @xmath13 by a well - defined integral over the finite dimensional space @xmath31 of gauge equivalence classes of flat connections .",
    "so far we have stated the basic conceptual idea .",
    "there are quite a few technical details where we generalize some standard tricks of supermanifold theory and gauge fixing theory in order to come up with an explicit formula for the perturbation series . for the main result ,",
    "the definition can be stated in terms of the structures on the deformation complex for the calculation of @xmath6 that arise because we have metrics present and so may define hodge theory and we have the taylor series for the action @xmath3 near @xmath6 .",
    "even though we expended a lot of effort in order to find the `` right formulation '' of the definition , it is rather technical . to make this paper accessible to non - experts",
    ", we will focus our attention in  2 to a trivial example which illustrates some of the important points that one needs to understand in formulating the general perturbaton theory . a more detailed overview of the general finite dimensional construction and the application to chern  simons theory is given in  3 and",
    " 4 , but the complete details will appear elsewhere @xcite .",
    "an appendix reviewing the derivation of the feynman rules and a list of notations are included at the end for the reader s convenience .",
    "for our trivial example we take @xmath27 to be @xmath48 with the usual @xmath49 coordinates , @xmath28 to be the trivial group , @xmath2 to be the standard area form @xmath50 , and the morse - bott function @xmath3 to have the form @xmath51 hear @xmath23 is a constant , @xmath52 is any positive function of @xmath53 and we assume for simplicity that the taylor series with respect to @xmath54 stops at the fourth order term .",
    "the positivity of @xmath52 insures that the real axis @xmath55 is a smooth component of the critical point set . for our purposes",
    ", we will just assume that there are no other components .",
    "since we are assuming @xmath28 is trivial , the `` moduli space '' @xmath6 is the same as @xmath13 . to be honest",
    ", we should note that the integral  does not actually converge . to make it converge",
    "we should replace @xmath27 by @xmath56 or multiply @xmath50 by a bump function supported near the origin , but we wo nt introduce notation for this .    the stationary phase approximation for this example",
    "is of course just the integral over @xmath13 of the result obtained by doing the stationary phase approximation to the integral over @xmath54 .",
    "abstractly , one can think of the integral over @xmath54 as the integral over the normal directions to @xmath13 with respect to the standard metric on @xmath48 .",
    "our goal is to see very explicitly why one gets the same result if one uses a different metric . to keep things simple , we take @xmath57 and identify @xmath34 with the translationally invariant metric represented by the matrix @xmath58 .",
    "the normal directions to @xmath13 are then lines with slope @xmath32 relative to the @xmath54 axis .",
    "note that the normal bundle to @xmath13 is trivial ( as one would expect in such a trivial example ) .",
    "we may identify the total space of @xmath42 with @xmath59 , with coordinates @xmath60 ; @xmath61 determines a point @xmath62 in @xmath13 ; @xmath32 is a point in @xmath33 ; and @xmath63 is the coordinate on the fibers of @xmath42 . since the exponential map is linear , we have @xmath64 going through @xmath65 with slope @xmath32 .",

    "this gives us a quantity which we write @xmath74 the symbol @xmath75 means that we are not to actually evaluate the integral , but merely to calculate its stationary phase approximation .",

    "of course , in this finite dimensional example , @xmath72 actually is the asymptotic series for @xmath82 and so is _ a priori _ independent of the metric . in the case of chern  simons field theory , however , to prove metric independence , we need to give a direct proof that @xmath80 is closed . as a warmup , we will verify explicitly @xmath80 is closed to subleading order for the trivial example .    applying the result in appendix a ,",

    "thus we see that graphically the exterior derivative of an edge , which has no vertices , is given by the labelled graph on the right in  which has one internal vertex .",
    "one can then proceed to find an algebra which is generated as a vector space by graphs with various kinds of edges and vertices which contains the orginal feynman rules and has an operator @xmath238 capturing exterior derivative .",
    "in fact , there is more than one way to do this .",
