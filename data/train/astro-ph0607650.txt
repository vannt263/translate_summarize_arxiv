    "rs oph is one of the well - observed recurrent novae and is suggested to be a progenitor system of type ia supernovae ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it has undergone its sixth recorded outburst on 2006 february 12 ut @xcite .",
    "the five previous recorded outbursts occurred in 1898 , 1933 , 1958 , 1967 , and 1985 .",
    "these short @xmath4 yr recurrence periods indicate that the white dwarf ( wd ) mass is very close to the chandrasekhar mass and that the mass accretion rate is as large as @xmath5  yr@xmath6 ( see , e.g. , fig.2 of * ? ? ?",
    "if the wd mass increases after each outburst , rs oph will eventually explode as a type ia supernova ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , it is important to estimate the wd mass and the accreted mass left on the wd after the outburst .",
    "it is well known that the x - ray turnoff time is a good indicator of the wd mass ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "when the hydrogen shell - burning atop the wd extinguishes , a supersoft x - ray phase ends ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in a visual light curve , however , this turnoff is not clear because many strong emission lines contribute to it . to avoid such contamination to the continuum flux ,",
    "we have observed rs oph with the strmgren @xmath0-band filter .",
    "the @xmath0-filter is an intermediate bandpass filter designed to cut the strong emission lines in the wide @xmath7 bandpass filter , so that its light curve represents the continuum flux of novae ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we have further modeled the light curve of rs oph and have determined the wd mass by fitting our modeled light curve with the observation .",
    "section [ observation_rs_oph ] presents our multi - band photometry of the rs oph 2006 outburst .",

    "optical observations were started just after the discovery of the 2006 outburst @xcite .",
    "each observer and their observational details are listed in table [ observers ] .",
    "we have put a special emphasis on the strmgren y - filter to avoid contamination by the strong emission lines .",
    "these y - filters were made by custom scientific inc . and distributed to each observer by one of the authors ( m. kato ) .",
    "kiyota , kubotera , maehara , and nakajima ( vsolj members ) started observation on february 13 and obtained 65 nights data for @xmath0-magnitudes ( from february 17 to july 27 ) .",
    "osaka kyoiku university ( oku ) team obtained @xmath7 and @xmath0 magnitudes of 25 nights starting from february 17 ( until july 14 ) .",
    "the magnitudes of this object were measured by using the local standard star , tyc2 5094.92.1 ( kiyota ) or tyc2 5094.283.1 ( the other observers ) .",
    "we adapted the brightness and color of ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) for tyc2 5094.92.1 and ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) for tyc2 5094.283.1 from tycho2 catalog .",

    "we have also added visual magnitudes of the 1985 outburst from the american association of variable star observers ( aavso ) for comparison .",
    "our @xmath0-magnitudes show very small scatter and follows the bottom of the 1985 visual magnitude .",
    "the essential feature of the light curve is very similar to the previous outbursts .",
    "the @xmath0 light curve , however , clearly shows a plateau phase from day 40 to day 75 and the sharp final decline starting from day 75 .",
    "such mid - plateau phases are also observed in two other recurrent novae , u sco ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and ci aql ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these authors interpreted the mid - plateau phase as a bright disk irradiated by the hydrogen - burning wd and a sharp start of the final decline as the epoch when the hydrogen shell - burning ends .",
    "our binary model , essentially the same as that in @xcite except for the free - free emission model ( see below ) in the early phase of the outburst , consists of a red giant ( rg ) star , which is not filling its roche lobe , a white dwarf ( wd ) , and a disk around the wd",
    ". a circular orbit with the ephemeris given by @xcite is assumed .      after a thermonuclear runaway sets in on a mass - accreting wd , its photosphere expands greatly and an optically thick wind massloss begins .",
    "the decay phase of novae can be followed by a sequence of steady state solutions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "after the optically thick winds stop , the envelope settles into a hydrostatic equilibrium where its mass is decreasing by nuclear burning .",
    "when the nuclear burning decays , the wd enters a cooling phase , in which the luminosity is supplied with heat flow from the ash of hydrogen burning .",
    "we have followed nova evolution , using the same method and numerical techniques as in @xcite .    in our nova light curve model",
    ", we assume that free - free emission of the optically thin ejecta dominates the continuum flux in the early phase of rs oph outbursts as in many classical novae ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this is the main and most important difference from previous hachisu & kato s ( 2001b ) model , in which the blackbody emission is assumed .",
    "the free - free emission of optically thin ejecta is estimated by equation ( 9 ) in @xcite .",
    "the calculated free - free light curves are shown in figure [ mass_v_uv_x_rs_oph_x50z02 ] .",
    "the decline rate of the light curve , i.e. , the evolutionary speed depends very sensitively on the wd mass if its mass is very close to the chandrasekhar mass ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is because the wd radius is very sensitive to the increase in mass near the chandrasekhar mass .",
    "the timescale also depends weakly on the chemical composition of envelopes .",
    "hydrogen depletion is expected .",
    "this is because , just after the unstable nuclear burning sets in , convection widely develops and mixes processed helium with unburned hydrogen .",
    "this mixing reduces the hydrogen content by 10%@xmath2820% for massive wds like in rs oph .",
    "the cno abundance is not enriched in the recurrent novae , so we adopt the hydrogen content of @xmath29 and the solar metallicity of @xmath30 .",
    "we added infrared @xmath31-magnitudes of the 1985 outburst observed by @xcite .",
    "very little dependence of the light curve shape on the wavelength is a characteristic feature in the free - free emission light curves .",
    "however , the free - free light curve can not reproduce the mid - plateau phase , so we introduce an irradiated disk in the next subsection .",
    "we assume an axi - symmetric disk with a size of @xmath32 and a thickness of @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the outer edge of the disk , @xmath35 is the effective radius of the inner critical roche lobe for the wd component , @xmath36 is the height of the surface from the equatorial plane , @xmath37 is the distance from the symmetry axis , and @xmath38 is the power index which describes flaring - up of the disk edge ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we also assume a companion red giant star with a radius of @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the effective radius of the inner critical roche lobe for the red giant component , its mass of @xmath41 , and the inclination angle of the binary , @xmath42 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite suggested @xmath43 for the distance of 1.5 kpc .",
    "the disk surface absorbs uv and supersoft x - ray photons from the wd and emits a part of it as a thermal emission with a lower temperature than that of the wd photosphere .",
    "the resultant light curve depends mainly on the disk size ( @xmath18 ) , the efficiency of irradiation ( @xmath44 radiated energy@xmath45absorbed energy ) , and also the radius of the rg , but depends very weakly on the other two parameters of @xmath38 and @xmath46 . here , we assume @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "the dependence on these parameters was widely discussed in the previous papers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the irradiation efficiency of the rg hardly affects the light curve as shown in figure [ nuclear_burning_rs_oph_x50z02_m1350_wide ] .",
    "we have obtained three best fit models of the 2006 outburst in table [ parameter_of_rsoph ] .",
    "the calculated light curves for the 50% efficiency are plotted in figure [ nuclear_burning_rs_oph_x50z02_m1350_wide ] .",
    "these models reproduce the mid - plateau phase and the sharp final decline identified as the end of hydrogen shell - burning .",
    "the turnoff date of day 83 in our @xmath49 wd model is very consisting with the supersoft x - ray turnoff on day @xmath50 observed with _ swift _ @xcite .",
    "the distance is obtained from the light curve fitting both at the plateau phase and at the post - outburst minimum phase as shown in figures [ mass_v_uv_x_rs_oph_x50z02 ] and [ nuclear_burning_rs_oph_x50z02_m1350_wide ] .",
    "the disk luminosity depends mostly on the disk size , @xmath18 , and the irradiation efficiency , @xmath17 .",
    "we have changed these two parameters and calculated the brightness at the mid - plateau phase .",
    "fitting the calculated brightness with the observation , we obtain the apparent distance moduli , i.e. , @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "then we calculate the absorption from @xmath53 where we use @xmath54",
    "( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "once @xmath55 is obtained , the distance is calculated from @xmath56 .",
    "thus , we obtained the absorption - distance relation for the irradiated disk as shown in figure [ rsoph_absorption_distance ] .",
    "we further restrict the distance with the observed absorption of @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "the same method is applied to the companion star , in which we have changed the companion size , @xmath22 , and the effective temperature , @xmath58 .",
    "the absorption - distance relation for the companion is also plotted .",
    "the largest ambiguity of our model is the irradiation efficiency of the disk . here",
    ", the distances of 0.9 , 1.3 , and 1.7  kpc are derived for the three different assumed efficiency , i.e. , 25% , 50% , and 100% , respectively .",
    "the actual efficiency is somewhere between 50% and 100% , so we have a reasonable distance of @xmath59  kpc .",
    "the decline rate of free - free light curve and the hydrogen burning turn - off date depend not only on the wd mass but also on the chemical composition of the envelope @xcite .",
    "we have examined two other cases of hydrogen content , @xmath60 and @xmath61 , and found that the best fit models are obtained for @xmath62 and @xmath63 , respectively .",
    "so we conclude that the wd mass is @xmath3 .",
    "there are still debates on the distance to rs oph . in the previous outburst , @xcite estimated the distance to be 1.6 kpc from absorption - line measurements .",
    "@xcite also obtained the distance of 1.6 kpc assuming the uv peak flux is equal to the eddington luminosity .",
    "@xcite calculated a distance of 1290 pc from the @xmath31-band luminosity .",
    "@xcite obtained a smaller distance of 0.6 kpc from the comparison of observed and theoretical uv fluxes integrated for the wavelength region of 911 - 3250   .",
    "this shorter distance is caused by their blackbody assumption , because the flux is much larger than the blackbody flux in this wavelength region .",
    "@xcite estimated the distance of 1.6 kpc from vlba mapping observation with an expansion velocity indicated from emission line width .",
    "@xcite estimated a shorter distance of @xmath64 pc assuming that the ir interferometry size corresponds to the binary separation .",
    "if we assume this corresponds to a circumbinary disk , however , a much larger distance is obtained .",
    "therefore , our new value of @xmath59 kpc is consistent with other estimates .",
    "we thank the variable star observing league of japan ( vsolj ) and the american association of variable star observers ( aavso ) for the visual data of rs oph .",
    "this research has been supported in part by grants - in - aid for scientific research ( 16540211 , 16540219 ) of the japan society for the promotion of science .",
