    "the non - central chi - square distribution function of probability appears in many applications .",
    "for example , in radar communications it appears when computing the detection of signals in noise using a square - law detector .",
    "its cumulative distribution function is also known as the generalized marcum @xmath0 function , which is defined by using the integral representation @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 is the modified bessel function .    in radar problems , if the signal - to - noise power ratio is @xmath4 for the sum of @xmath5 independent samples of the output of a square - law detector , this integral gives the probability of that the sum will be @xmath6 or more .",
    "the complementary function of the generalized marcum @xmath0 function is given by    @xmath7    and the following relation holds @xmath8    methods and an algorithm for computing the functions @xmath9 and @xmath10 are described in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath11th moment of the partial non - central chi - square distribution function is given by    @xmath12    in this manuscript , we give properties satisfied by the moments of the partial non - central chi - square distribution functions and discuss methods for computing these moments , also known as nuttall q - functions @xcite .",
    "there are several applications where these functions are involved as for example , the analysis of the outage probability of wireless communication systems with a minimum signal power constraint @xcite , to mention just one example within the telecommunications field .",
    "the maclaurin series for the modified bessel function reads    @xmath13    by substituting this expression in the integral representation , we obtain the series expansion for the @xmath11th moment of the non - central chi - square distribution function :    @xmath14    this expansion is given in terms of one of the standard incomplete gamma functions defined by    @xmath15    introducing the factor @xmath16 in , the expansion can be also given in terms of the incomplete gamma function ratio @xmath17 , defined by    @xmath18    and for which algorithms are given in @xcite .",
    "the expansion for the @xmath11th moment of the non - central chi - square distribution function in terms of incomplete gamma function ratios is given by    @xmath19    the series representation can be computed by using the algorithms for the incomplete gamma ratios described in @xcite . the recurrence relation    @xmath20    is stable for @xmath21 in the forward direction , so the evaluation of the terms in the series for this function in ( [ qseries2 ] ) is rather easy .",
    "a recurrence relation for the moments of the non - central chi - squared distribution function can be obtained considering integration by parts in the integral in , together with the relation @xmath22 .",
    "this gives    @xmath23    when @xmath24 , this recurrence reduces to a first order difference equation for the marcum - q function ( see , for instance , @xcite is missing in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq .  ( 1.4 ) ) .",
    "the recurrence relation given in can be used for testing , and it can be also used for computation , as we describe later .",
    "the series expansion given in has been tested by using the recurrence relation of written in the form    @xmath25    the deviations from @xmath26 of the left - hand side of ( in absolute value ) will measure the accuracy of the tested methods .",
    "the series expansion has been implemented in the fortran 90 module * nuttallf*. this module uses another module ( * incgamfi * ) for the computation of the gamma function ratios .",
    "we have tested the parameter region @xmath27 .",
    "the tests show that an accuracy better than @xmath28 in this region can be obtained with the series expansion .    when @xmath5 or @xmath29 are large , it is convenient to use approximations for the ratio of gamma functions appearing in the expression , in order to avoid the appearance of overflow problems sooner than expected . in the case",
    "@xmath30 we have :    @xmath31    the following table shows some values of moments of the chi - square distribution function computed with the series expansion and the corresponding values obtained with the direct computation of the integral representation using maple with 50 digits ( the results shown in the table correspond to the first 18 digits obtained with these computations ) .",
    "the computation of the series expansion has been implemented in the double precision fortran 90 module * nuttallf*. as can be seen , an agreement of minimum 14 - 15 digits is obtained in all cases , which is consistent with the expected accuracy of the double precision fortran 90 module .    in some cases , maple fails to compute the integral and acceleration can be obtained by suitably truncating the improper integral and changing the variable of integration .",
    "we notice that , as before commented , the modified bessel function is exponentially increasing for large arguments and then the integrand in ( [ intro04 ] ) can be estimated by @xmath32 , @xmath33 which is related to a gaussian centered @xmath34 .",
    "the maximum value of this function is attained at @xmath35 and integrating around this value with a sufficiently wide interval is enough .",
    "this truncated integral over finite interval @xmath36 $ ] can be then transformed with a linear change to an integral in @xmath37 $ ] and the convergence is further accelerated by considering the change of variable @xmath38 , particularly if the trapezoidal rule is used for evaluating the integral ( see @xcite ) .",
    "these modifications are observed to speed up the computation of the integrals using maple , particularly for the last value in table 1 for which maple does not appear to be able to converge to an accurate value .",
    "@xmath39 values of the moments of the chi - square distribution function for different choices of the parameters @xmath11 , @xmath5 @xmath4 and @xmath6 .",
    "the values shown are obtained with the series expansion and with the direct computation of the integral representation using maple with 50 digits .",
    "if we write the recurrence relation ( [ recq1 ] ) as @xmath40 then it is clear that we have a numerically stable relation because all the terms in the right hand side are positive .",
    "now , assume that the moments of order zero ( marcum functions ) @xmath41 are known for @xmath42 ( or for a sequence of real values @xmath43 , @xmath44 , with @xmath45 ) .",
    "if @xmath46 is also known , the relation ( [ rec2 ] ) can be used to compute @xmath47 ; therefore , starting from the value @xmath48 we can compute @xmath46 , @xmath42 in a stable way . in the same way , after determining @xmath46 , @xmath42 and if @xmath49 is know , we can compute @xmath46 , @xmath50 and so on .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the inhomogeneous recurrence has to be applied with care , particularly the inhomogeneous term . as @xmath4 and/or @xmath6 becomes large the bessel function increases exponentially",
    "; therefore we have the product of a small exponential times an exponentially large function and because of the bad conditioning of the exponentials , this translates into larger relative errors ; additionally , the exponentials may overflow / underflow .",
    "part of this error can be avoided by considering the scaled bessel function @xmath51 . in terms of this function @xmath52",
    "an alternative way of computing with recurrences is considering a homogeneous equation , which we can be constructed from the inhomogeneous equation writing @xmath53 & c_{\\mu+1}=\\displaystyle\\sqrt{\\frac{y}{x}}\\frac{i_{\\mu + 1}(2\\sqrt{xy})}{i_{\\mu}(2\\sqrt{xy})}. \\end{array}\\ ] ] then , if @xmath54 is know @xmath50 , we can compute @xmath55 @xmath50 , starting from @xmath56 and @xmath57 with the recurrence @xmath58    the advantage of this recurrence is that the overflow problems are reduced because ratios of bessel functions appear instead of bessel functions themselves . also , for computing these ratios , continued fraction representations can be used . in table 2 the use of the recurrence relation for computing @xmath59 is tested for several values of @xmath60 .",
    "the values of @xmath4 and @xmath6 are fixed to @xmath61 and @xmath62 , respectively .",
    "the table shows the relative error obtained when comparing the value obtained with the recurrence relation and the direct computation using the series expansion of :    @xmath63    the continued fraction for the ratio of bessel functions is computed using the modified lentz algorithm @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xmath64 test of the application of the recurrence relation given in .",
