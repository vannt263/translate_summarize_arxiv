    "high precision , high duty time - series photometry from _ kepler _ has contributed to numerous fundamentally new discoveries in the exoplanet field ( e.g. @xcite ) .",

    "after this huge success , the next spacecraft photometry missions with improved technology are expected for 2017 ( transiting exoplanet survey satellite , _ tess _",
    "@xcite ) and 2024 ( planetary transits and oscillations of stars , _ plato 2.0 _ @xcite ) .",
    "we asked the obvious question : what can we expect from these missions in the very best case ? and ultimately : assuming near - perfect photometric technology at some point in the future , what can we expect from photometry as such ?",
    "where are the fundamental limits ?",
    "to begin , we will examine and define instrumental and stellar noise ( section  [ sec : instruments ] ) .",
    "afterwards , we will discuss the _ kepler _ , _ tess _ and _ plato 2.0 _ mission designs and limitations ( section  [ sec : sim ] ) .",
    "we will not focus on the high numbers of discoveries , but on the very best cases with respect to their instrumental noise . in section  [ sec :",
    "inject ] , we will present the view of a distant observer at _ our _ planets transiting _ our _ sun , assuming near - perfect photometry . inversely , this is what we can expect from future space missions when it comes to finding solar system analogues .",
    "we will conclude with an outlook to the limits of photometry .",
    "noise in data is often the limiting factor of data analysis .",
    "noise in exoplanet transit photometry is caused by instrumental imperfections ( @xmath1 ) and stellar jitter ( @xmath2 ) . in the following",
    ", we will discuss both parts separately .",
    "the total noise @xmath3 , assuming gaussian distribution , is then calculated as : @xmath4      stellar noise occurs with different characteristics on all time scales .",
    "first considerations for the _ kepler _ mission by @xcite were theoretical , due to the lack of precise data for other stars . in our sun",
    ", there is the 11-year solar activity cycle @xcite , a phenomenon we also find on different time scales in other stars @xcite .",
    "the solar rotation of @xmath527 days @xcite introduces noise from spots , first noted by galileo galilei in 1612 @xcite .",
    "it has also been argued that the solar activity is modulated by planetary gravitational and electromagnetic forces acting on the sun , namely those by mercury , venus , earth and jupiter @xcite .    in the following",
    ", we will ignore trends longer than a few days , and assume they can be removed using filters such as @xcite used by @xcite to analyze _ kepler _ noise , median filtering ( e.g. @xcite ) or polynomial fitting ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "instead , we focus on the jitter on time scales of planetary transits , mostly 110 hours @xcite .",
    "this jitter originates mainly from stellar oscillation modes , granulation at the surface of the star , and rotational activity @xcite .",
    "our sun s noise varies by a factor of @xmath52 during the 11-year solar cycle , from 7.8ppm ( 2007.77 , quiet period ) in 6.5hrs bins to 14.7ppm ( 2002.39 , active period ) @xcite .",
    "this is at the quiet side of g - type stars , of which the most quiet 1% have 6ppm , with a total cut - off at 5ppm @xcite .",
    "although the noise measures and results differ slightly between these authors , it can also be seen from figure  [ fig : jittersun ] that there are few stars more quiet than our sun .",
    "there is a strong dependence of stellar noise to temperature : cooler stars are usually more active , so that among m - dwarfs only very few are as quiet as our sun , and most are around @xmath550ppm .",
    "however , there might be a few extremely quiet ( 14ppm ) g - dwarfs @xcite , theorized to exhibit a time of almost no spots , as was the case for our sun during the maunder minimum @xcite .",
    "the detection of such a fortunate case , where mainly granulation ( 1ppm ) contributes to stellar noise , would allow for extreme observations , given near - perfect technology .",
    "as we have not detected such a very - low noise star yet , we will instead concentrate on the known quiet end of g- and m - dwarfs .",
    "_ kepler _ instrumental noise ( straight line ) depends on the brightness of the star .",
    "this plot shows only the brightest end , and only g - dwarfs . our sun would exhibit a total noise ( instrumental plus stellar ) in between the dashed lines , which give the limits for the active ( upper ) and quiet ( lower ) sun .",
    "few other stars are more quiet than our sun , and many are more active .",
    "+ ]    noise in sun - like stars , on this timescale , originates mostly from asteroseismic oscillations .",
    "solar - like oscillations , mostly acoustic or pressure ( p ) modes , are reported with their highest amplitudes at frequencies between 29.9@xmath6hz ( 10 hours ) and 3619@xmath6hz ( 4 minutes ) among _ kepler _ stars @xcite . regarding the solar noise properties on time scales of @xmath5hours ,",
    "it can clearly be seen from figure  [ fig : sunjitter ] ( top ) that the jitter is not gaussian .",
    "clearly , there are trends , mostly from oscillations and spots , lasting a few hours , showing spots appearing and disappearing on the disc .",
    "this is the same timescale on which exoplanet transits occur , so that these trends can not easily be filtered out .",
    "time - correlated red ( brownian ) noise becomes more and more gaussian with stacks from different epochs , because the correlation of the total noise decreases ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this will be explained in more detail in section  [ sub : red ] .",
    "another noise source is contamination of the starlight from background ( or foreground ) stars in the aperture , which can occur when the angular separation of the contaminator is smaller than the spatial resolution of the instrument .",
    "for _ kepler _ s ( low ) spatial resolution , this is a problem in some cases , but not in general : `` the overall increase of median and mean noise ( ... ) are only 0.2 and 0.1 ppm '' @xcite .",
    "data for the sun from _ virgo / diarad _ @xcite shows trends on time scales of hours and longer ( top ) .",
    "we inject synthetic transit shapes into these raw data ( middle ) .",
    "to retrieve the transit , we fit a long - time sliding median while masking the times of transit ( bottom ) .",
    "instrumental noise ( @xmath50.4ppm ) is smaller than the symbol size .",
    "+ ]      stars show brightness variations on different time scales , with different amplitudes , and characteristics . on the extreme side , there are for example rrab lyrae with an amplitude of @xmath550% over 0.5d , but near - perfect repetition in some cases @xcite . on the quiet side , there are stars like our sun , or kepler-197",
    "@xcite , which show very low ( 0.1% ) long - time ( months ) variation , but stochastic trends on an hour to day timescale .",
    "intermediate cases are most common , e.g. kepler-264b @xcite with strong short - time trends , or",
    "kepler-96 @xcite with prominent long - time trends .",
    "we show these examples in figure  [ fig : stellartrends ] and use them for the following discussion of suitable noise models .",
    "the most fortunate case is to have trends that are on a much longer timescale than the transit signature .",
    "kepler-96 is an example for this behavior , where a `` stellar noise model '' using splines or polynomials will successfully remove the trends which are induced mostly by stellar rotation .",
    "the short transit times can be masked for the detrending , and the transit analysis can be done afterwards .",
    "a simultaneous fit would only complicate the process , and have no additional benefit .",
    "the limits of this method are reached in cases where the trends are less sinusoidal , as is the case for corot-7b @xcite .",
    "then , gaussian processes ( gps ) are suitable to treat these systematics .",
    "their main advantage is to naturally handle correlations irrespective of their origin , by specifying high - level properties of the covariance @xcite .",
    "commonly used correlations are radial - velocity measurements @xcite , different wavelengths @xcite , or instrumental systematics such as the drift in the roll - angle of _ kepler s _ k2 mission @xcite .",
    "when the noise timescale gets closer to the transit duration , other methods must be chosen .",
    "most prominently , the wavelet - based formalism described in @xcite is being used , e.g. by @xcite in their analysis of spin - orbit misalignment in the multiplanet system kepler-56 , or by @xcite in their confirmation of kepler-91 being a `` giant planet orbiting a giant star '' .",
    "using wavelets , the noise is modeled by the sum of two stationary ( gaussian ) processes ; one is uncorrelated in time , and the other has a spectral power density as @xmath7 .    in any such model , parameters must be estimated and validated individually for each star , using monte - carlo simulations .",
    "this is also true for competing methods , such as the `` time - averaging '' method @xcite , or the `` residual - permutation '' method ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "consequently , stellar noise modeling is not applied to the large number ( thousands ) of planets found with automatic pipelines . for interesting individual cases , however , stellar noise modeling can and should be used .",
    "it is important to note that these cases have , beforehand , been detected _ without _ modeling , so that any detection must pass this initial threshold .",
    "in the course of this paper , we choose the same approach : we use the `` standard '' pipeline without noise modeling , but introduce it after the detection of the earth , which can be assumed to be of distinguished interest for any distant observer .",
    "noise modeling reaches its current limits for signals so small that they become indistinguishable from permanent noise features ; for our sun , this would be the case for signals on ppm - level as for earth s moon .",
    "therefore , we limit our example to earth itself .    after removing instrumental trends ,",
    "different characteristics in stellar noise are evident .",
    "kepler-96 ( top , black ) shows strong long - time ( weeks ) variations , but is as quiet as the other examples on hours to days timescale . kepler-197 ( middle , red ) is a star with low noise on all time scales , like our sun .",
    "kepler-264b ( bottom , blue ) is as quiet long - time , but shows more prominent short - time ( hours , days ) trends .",
    "all stars have been centered to exhibit a transiting planet at t=5d .",
    "+ ]      even the most perfect instrument will produce _ some _ noise .",
    "fundamentally , this originates from the fact that photons ( starlight ) and electrons ( detector ) are quantized @xcite , so that only a finite number can be counted in a given time .",
    "this phenomenon is the _ shot noise _ @xcite , which is correlated mostly to the brightness of the target .",
    "in addition , noise occurs from the readout of the ccd , when the small signal gets amplified . on a timescale of 6.5hrs ( 13 bins of @xmath530min )",
    ", the _ kepler _ instrumental noise for a @xmath8=12 star from poisson ( shot ) and readout is 16.8ppm .",
    "two other instrumental noise sources have been quantified for the kepler spacecraft : intrinsic detector variations ( 10.8ppm ) , and a quarter - dependent term ( 7.8ppm ) @xcite .",
    "the total instrumental noise is then 20.4ppm . for reference",
    ", the design of the spacecraft expected instrumental noise of 17.0ppm .",
    "it is a common practice in exoplanet science @xcite to define the signal - to - noise ratio as the depth of the transit model , compared to the out - of - transit noise : @xmath9 with @xmath10 as the number of transit observations , @xmath11 the transit depth and @xmath12 the standard deviation of out - of - transit observations .",
    "this measure overestimates s / n for large planet - to - star radius ratios , and large impact parameters , but these configurations will be neglected in the present work . as pointed out by @xcite ,",
    "the detection of kois becomes unreliable for a s / n @xmath13 10 .",
    "this assumes gaussian noise  the noise distribution of our sun , even during the quiet year 2007 , is distinctly not gaussian .",
    "it has strong time - correlated ( red ) noise features and a `` long tail '' .",
    "two statistical methods should be employed to quantify this .",
    "first of all , we recommend a skewness and kurtosis tests for normality , e.g. by @xcite .",
    "for our sun , as expected , the difference to gaussian noise is significant , at the 0.1% level . after establishing that the noise is not gaussian",
    ", we propose to measure the `` redness '' per bin length @xmath14 , as described by @xcite : @xmath15 for completely uncorrelated noise , @xmath16 , while for gaussian noise @xmath17 . instead of giving @xmath18-values for each bin length , we chose to calculate the achieved percentage ( where gaussian noise is 100% ) , and show the result in figure  [ fig : snratio ] .",
    "this gives the recoverable s / n of transits , when compared to gaussian noise .",
    "as shown in the figure , the s / n in solar red noise is significantly lower .",
    "this issue originates from the simple fact that subsequent data points are time - correlated , and are thus more likely to have ( nearly ) _ the same error _",
    "( positive or negative ) when binned together on the time axis .",
    "in other words : red noise data does nt bin as well as white noise data .",
    "the penalty of this noise characteristic is also time - correlated , because , over time , it diminishes . for an earth - analogue transit ( 13.2hrs ) , only 49% of the expected s /",
    "n can be achieved ; 60% for a jupiter ( 33hrs ) and 71% for a neptune ( 76hrs ) ( figure  [ fig : snratio ] ) . when stacking different years ( of similar noise ) , the penalty is zero , as there is no time - correlation any more .",
    "the original intra - transit penalty can not be recovered , of course , but stacking different epochs brings the expected ( like gaussian ) stacking bonus .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : snratio ] , the expected power law when binning data ( for mainly gaussian noise ) begins at @xmath57hrs . for shorter times ,",
    "the best - fit is given by a linear correlation ( @xmath19 ; best - fit power law gives lower @xmath20 ) .",
    "the location of the structural break can be calculated using the test by @xcite , asking the question whether the coefficients in two regressions for different data sets are equal .",
    "the result is a clear structural break at the 0.1% level , with a best - fit location at 7@xmath21hrs . to sum up",
    ", our sun produces gaussian noise on long ( @xmath221d ) timescales , but suffers red noise punishment on shorter timescales .",
    "in this section , we will discuss the instrumental performance of the future _ tess _ and _ plato 2.0 _ missions .",
    "we will define the properties for two `` telescopes '' to use : the best - case _ plato 2.0 _ performance , and a theoretical near - perfect instrument , dubbed _",

    "@xcite ( the areas of the sky with one year coverage from _ tess _ will also fall into the continuous viewing zone for _ jwst _ ) .",

    "( @xcite , their figure 8) . in this paper",
    ", we strive for best possible photometry , and are interested in solar system analogues , so that we will neglect _ tess _ , as it does `` not address the science case of characterizing rocky planets at intermediate orbital distances ( a@xmath00.3au , including the hz ) around solar - like stars , which remains unique for _ plato 2.0_. '' @xcite .",
    "instrumental noise from _ plato 2.0 _ is expected to be as low as 10ppm on 30min timescale for bright ( v=9 ) stars @xcite , or 8ppm in 1hr integrations @xcite , when observed by many ( up to 36 ) cameras simultaneously , thus producing @xmath53ppm of instrumental noise on the same 6.5hrs timescale .",
    "while _ kepler _ observed @xmath530 bright ( v@xmath248 ) stars , _ plato 2.0 _ will collect data for @xmath53,000  giving a good chance for a useful share of quiet stars among them .",
    "observing our sun through _ plato 2.0 _ would then give a stellar noise fraction of 74% ( quiet sun ) to 84% ( active sun ) , making such an observation strongly limited by intrinsic stellar noise .",
    "for smaller , but generally more active m - dwarfs ( with noise levels around 50ppm @xcite ) , this ratio can reach 95% to 99% , making the technology near - perfect and observations only limited by intrinsic stellar noise .",

    "plato 2.0 _ is expected to launch in 2024 and end its nominal operation in 2030 . for the following decade ( the 2030s )",
    ", one might imagine a successor mission , with even better instruments .",
    "we should assume that many noise sources can be reduced ( or eliminated completely ) using the knowledge and expertise gained throughout previous missions , such as pointing jitter and thermal variations .",
    "sensor sensitivity , for instance , has improved over the decades and approaches @xmath080% quantum efficiency today , over the wavelength range 0.62.5@xmath6 m ( e.g. , @xcite .    for those stars where the photon flux ( shot noise ) is not the limiting factor , instrumental noise will be dominated by these other sources .",
    "as we have seen , total instrumental noise from _ kepler _ is at @xmath520ppm , whereas we expect @xmath510ppm from _ plato 2.0_. it will be interesting to check the perfect telescope with zero instrumental noise .",
    "as explained in section  [ sub : instrumentalnoise ] , this is in principle unphysical , but a noise floor down to 0.4ppm as for _ virgo / diarad _ might be achievable",

    "also , they can not have their orbit inside the roche lobe , otherwise they would be torn apart and create a ring system .",
    "similar arguments can be made for ring systems : when a flux increase ( through diffractive forward - scattering ) favours a ring composition of ice over rock , then such a ring planet can not be too close to its host star , otherwise the ice would evaporate .",
    "furthermore , we can count the fraction of transits that exhibit _ no _ moon - like signals ( assuming a coplanar moon ) , and compare this to the theoretical upper limit of @xmath56.4% , as derived by @xcite using the roche stability criterion .    sometimes , however , the situation is less clear .",

    "the best - fit parameters were a physically possible @xmath53 planet orbited by a @xmath54 exomoon .",

    "it is also worth noting that the detectability function in figure  [ fig : snmap ] has a step at @xmath80 ( not shown in the figure ) , i.e. when only one transit is observed during the mission duration .",
    "then , all else equal , longer periods are _ preferred _ due to their longer transit duration which makes the detection easier . for comparison",
    ", neptune has a transit duration of 3.1d , and jupiter `` only '' 1.4d , giving a s / n advantage of @xmath81 from transit duration .",
    "of course , the occurrence rate of neptunes and jupiters is likely different ( see section  [ strategies ] ) , as is their transit probability .",
    "it is important , however , that the s / n differences are taken into account when calculating population statistics with _ plato 2.0 _ data .    on the other side , to answer the question of what near - perfect photometry can deliver in the future , we have repeated our injections without the instrumental noise .",
    "the results for the g2 star are very similar , as most of the noise already comes from stellar trends in the _ plato 2.0 _ scenario . as has been shown in section  [ sub : earth ] ,",
    "the improvements towards _ perfect _ are only @xmath510% , and up to @xmath550% for the smaller m - dwarfs . according to our blind retrieval simulations ,",
    "even with the inclusion of standard noise models , a detection of mercury or mars analogues is beyond the photometric limits .",
    "this , however , is not necessarily the _ ultimate _ limit of photometry ( as asked in the introduction ) ; we might improve noise models using proxy data from radial velocity , spectroscopy , hydrodynamical modeling , and other methods yet to be developed .",
    "in this work , we have shown that future photometry will be able to detect earth- and venus - analogues when transiting g - dwarfs like our sun ( table  [ tab : sntable ] ) .",
    "larger sized planets ( @xmath82 ) will be detected in a single transit around g - dwarfs , in low stellar noise cases , and assuming one can find them in the first place .",
    "the search techniques for such single transits will require further research and validation , and will likely be performed remotely , due to the large storage requirements .    while the detection of moons in a solar system configuration will remain problematic in the next decades , the situation is better for rings , and for moons in m - dwarf systems .    for source stars with strong red noise characteristics , such as our sun , we suggest to shift the usual s / n limit from 7 to 14 , in order to prevent too many false positives . this limit can be set individually for each star in question , by multiply injecting and retrieving artificial signals to the one that is in question .",
    "alternatively , we recommend to model the noise and set an appropriate threshold for the noise model using simulations .",
    "we release all data used in this paper , plain and injected , for the community and encourage testing different ( and also blind ) retrieval techniques in preparation for _ plato 2.0 _ and other missions .    despite these challenges",
    ", we believe that the era of transit planet detection is still in its infancy , and photometry will have a bright future in the coming decades .",
