    "during the last few years , multiband superconductivity has again been at the forefront of condensed matter physics , and particularly so after the discovery of high - temperature superconductivity in the family of intrinsically multiband iron - based materials@xcite .",
    "as with all newly discovered superconductors with unconventional behavior , one principal question is to determine the pairing symmetry of the superconductor . in the pnictide superconductors much effort",
    "has been devoted to this central issue , so far without entirely conclusive answers .",
    "nevertheless , the leading contender has for some time been @xmath0-wave pairing@xcite , which in its simplest realization for the iron - based superconductors means that the hole - like and electron - like fermi surfaces both host @xmath3-wave superconductivity , but with opposite sign of the order parameter .",
    "( in the past , similar sign - shifted order parameters have also been considered as a candidate pairing state _",
    "e.g. _ of high - t@xmath5 cuprates@xcite . )",
    "distinguishing such a state from an isotropic @xmath3-wave pairing state is highly non - trivial , since both @xmath3-wave and @xmath0-waves states have the same symmetry , and do not have nodes in the order parameter on the fermi surface . in order to establish conclusively the internal phase shift characterizing a possible @xmath0-wave state in the iron - based superconductors it is therefore crucial to devise phase sensitive pairing probes .",
    "a large number of proposals for such experiments have been put forth in the literature recently .",
    "theories for multiband tunneling spectroscopy have been developed@xcite as well as calculations of the surface density of states for a @xmath0-superconductor@xcite . in a related context , andreev",
    "bound states ( abs ) are often pointed out as possible pairing probes @xcite .",
    "another class of experiments suggested involves josephson junctions , both single junctions@xcite , trijunction loops@xcite and also various corner geometries employed for josephson interferometry@xcite .",
    "yet another work considered possible signatures in the ac josephson effect@xcite .",
    "in addition , we should mention that the josephson effect for multiband superconductors with sign - shifted order parameters has previously been discussed also in the context of mgb@xmath6@xcite and bilayer cuprates@xcite .    of the probes listed above ,",
    "tunneling spectroscopy is probably the one that is experimentally most accessible ( see refs .  ,   and references therein ) , and results here are routinely compared with the theory of blonder , tinkham and klapwijk ( btk ) for andreev reflection@xcite . recently ,",
    "one theoretical work@xcite augmented the btk - approach to also incorporate interband scattering in the superconducting region , which was shown to result in interference effects and subgap bound states in the conductance spectra . however , as pointed out soon after@xcite , the phenomenological approach employed in ref .   may fail to capture the effect of interband coupling correctly . in this work",
    ", we will present an alternative approach of including interband scattering into the btk framework .",
    "another probe which has not been considered in the literature so far is crossed andreev reflection@xcite ( car ) .",
    "this is a process contributing to the nonlocal conductance in a two - lead normal metal / superconductor junction@xcite in which an electron impinging on the superconductor from one of the leads is converted to a hole in the other lead .",
    "this phenomenon has previously attracted attention as a possible probe both for ferromagnetic superconductors@xcite and non - centrosymmetric superconductors @xcite . however , crossed andreev reflection has not yet , to the best of our knowledge , been considered in the context of the @xmath7-wave pairing state .",
    "yet another possible experimental signature , which was first proposed in the context of iron - based superconductors by the present authors in ref .  , is 0-@xmath4 transitions @xcite . to explain this phenomenon",
    ", we draw upon results from josephson junctions with ferromagnetic elements . for such systems , _ e.g. _ a s@xmath2f@xmath2s junction , the critical current @xmath8 switches sign for given thicknesses @xmath9 of the ferromagnetic interlayer , resulting in non - monotonous dependence of @xmath8 on @xmath9 .",
    "this phenomenon is ascribed to the junction switching between being a ( conventional ) 0-junction with zero phase difference across the junction in the ground state and a @xmath4-junction , which has phase difference @xmath4 across the junction in the ground state .",
    "furthermore , the critical thicknesses @xmath9 of s@xmath2f@xmath2s systems are often temperature dependent , which allows for the observation of thermally induced 0-@xmath4 transitions at @xmath10 as well as transitions as a function of interlayer width .",
    "the possibility of @xmath4-junctions consisting of @xmath0-wave superconductors has been mentioned previously in some theoretical works@xcite , but in ref .",
    "we showed that 0-@xmath4 transitions were possible in a diffusive @xmath3-wave@xmath2n@xmath1-wave junction both as a function of temperature and as a function of the ratio of interface resistances for each band .",
    "the present work is motivated by the question of whether these effects persist in the ballistic limit , and we perform a complementary , more comprehensive study of the josephson effects for a simple model capturing the essential features of a @xmath0-wave superconductor with interband coupling .",
    "we find that the 0-@xmath4 transition for varying ratio of interband resistance persists , but that non - sinusoidality of the current - phase relation is significant for the present case .",
    "for varying temperature we find a somewhat weaker phase shift effect , which we will relate to the more clear - cut 0-@xmath4 transition reported for the diffusive case .",
    "these results for the temperature dependence of the josephson current can be compared with the non - monotonous josephson current between a multigap and a single - gap superconductor previously obtained by agterberg _",
    "et al._@xcite    the outline of this work is as follows . in sec .",

    "although the formalism used in eq . imposes the multiband basis also on the normal metal wavefunction , this does not necessarily imply that the normal metal has two physically distinct bands .    for an incoming electron from band @xmath42 , the n side wave function is simply obtained by letting @xmath43 { \\mathrm{e}^{\\i k x}}$ ] go to @xmath44{\\mathrm{e}^{\\i k x}}$ ] in eq . . here , @xmath45 are the normal and andreev reflection scattering coefficients for band @xmath18 .",

    "as two decoupled @xmath55 systems , we obtain the analytical solution as given by eqs . and in appendix b. we also refer to this appendix for some more information regarding validity , existence and uniqueness of this solution",
    ".    we will assume bcs - like temperature dependence of the gaps , with the @xmath3-wave gap of the left superconductor closing at a temperature @xmath173 while both gaps of two - band superconductor on the right hand sides close simultaneously at @xmath174 .",
    "we will parameterize the difference in gap magnitudes by @xmath175 and @xmath176 , and will in most of what follows restrict ourselves to @xmath177 and @xmath178 as a representative set of gap ratios , although we stress that our results are valid in a much larger portion of parameter space .",
    "the resulting temperature dependence of the three superconducting gaps is illustrated in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : ic_vs_t_rs05_rd03_2xd_inset ] .",
    "first , we compare the temperature dependence of the critical current both for a @xmath0-wave and a two - gap @xmath3-wave superconductor in fig .",
    "[ fig : ic_vs_t_rs05_rd03_2xd_inset ] .",
    "the most distinctive feature for both these cases is the sharp peak at high temperature .",
    "this is exactly the temperature @xmath179 for which two of the gaps cross , _ i.e. _ @xmath180 , and although this peak is not a signature of the @xmath0-state as such , since it is present irrespective of the phase difference between the two right hand side gaps , it would be interesting to disclose the mechanism behind this feature .",
    "we turn therefore to the energy dispersion of the abss , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : abs_rs05_rd03_t0855 - 0875 ] for two temperatures close to the peak in the critical current .",
    "firstly , this illustrate how @xmath181 tracks the gap edge of @xmath182 and @xmath183 the gap edge of @xmath184 as the temperature is increased , whereas for @xmath185 both states track the smallest of the gaps , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath186 .",
    "secondly , we observe that the energy states are non - dispersive for a phase interval centered around @xmath187 and @xmath188 , for @xmath183 and @xmath181 , respectively ( _ cf . _",
    "the discussion in appendix b ) , so that in these regions the current contributions of the states vanish .",
    "thirdly , we also observe that the dispersion of @xmath181 is strongly enhanced at @xmath179 .",
    "this last observation can be understood by glancing at the expression for @xmath181 in eq . for a given @xmath189 ,",
    "from which we realize _ e.g. _ by setting @xmath190 , that the band width of the energy state is at its maximum for @xmath191 .",
    "this is of course exactly the case for @xmath179 .",
    "moreover , since the contribution from @xmath183 vanishes for a large @xmath139-interval for this temperature , whereas it is non - vanishing for @xmath181 for all @xmath139 in this limiting case of equal gap magnitudes , one does not get the effect of partial cancellation of the two current contributions that was present for lower temperatures and for @xmath192 .",
    "we note that although the peak strength for these gap ratios is somewhat extreme , we have verified that similar peaks or bumps persists in a major part of parameter space .",
    "we have concluded that a peak in the critical current can not be taken as a signature of @xmath0-pairing since it results from the energy gap crossing of the right hand and left hand superconductor in general .",
    "we therefore return to our investigation into possible thermally induced 0-@xmath4 phase shifts as an unambiguous sign of @xmath0-wave pairing , although apparently no such phase shift is present in our results .",
    "however , we remember from the analysis of the current - phase relation in sec . [ sec : equalgaps ] that in the presence of a second harmonic component to the current , a prospective 0-@xmath4 transition was smeared out into a @xmath139-state region for which the critical current remains nonzero .",
    "we therefore consider the current - phase relation for the junction with different gap magnitudes in fig .",
    "[ fig : cpr_rs03_rd05_t04 - 07 ] for two intermediate temperature values .",
    "it is evident that the second - harmonic component dominates , a fact which can be traced back to the vanishing of the abs contributions for complementary phase intervals as discussed above .",
    "a related result is that the two maxima shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cpr_rs03_rd05_t04 - 07 ] originate predominantly from one of the energy states each .",
    "furthermore , we have seen that the contribution from an abs is larger the closer the values of the gap magnitudes @xmath186 and @xmath193 , and as @xmath194 , @xmath186 and @xmath182 are closing in on each other whereas @xmath186 and @xmath195 are moving apart .",
    "thus the difference in the rate at which the gaps decrease causes the @xmath183 state to lose dominance to @xmath181 for increasing temperature .",
    "( since @xmath196 is by far the largest of the gaps , the corresponding abs dominates for @xmath197 even though @xmath196 is further from @xmath198 than is @xmath199 . )    in fig . [",
    "fig : cpr_rs03_rd05_t04 - 07 ] we have also indicated the phase difference @xmath149 in the current - phase relation that supports the critical current for each of the two temperatures .",
    "we now understand that as the dominant contribution to the current changes from @xmath183 to @xmath181 with increasing temperature , there must be a jump in this phase value from @xmath200 to @xmath201 , and this jump needs to happen discontinuously at the temperature @xmath202 where the two contributions balance ( _ cf . _ our discussion of @xmath203 in sec .",
    "[ sec : equalgaps ] ) .",
    "this is our main result in this section : although the josephson junction is at no point in a 0-state or a @xmath4-state , the system may nevertheless exhibit discernible phase shifts when residing in the @xmath139-state .",
    "we illustrate this phenomenon for different parameters in fig . [",
    "fig : ic_vs_t_rs05_rd03_w_phi ] , and note that similar behavior was observed for a large set of different gap ratios as long as @xmath204 and @xmath205 , the basic mechanism behind it being different temperature dependence of the different gaps . for the case of a two - gap @xmath3-wave state ,",
    "a phase shift is of course not possible , as the two contributions to the current are then acting cooperatively at all times .",
    "comparing the three systems considered in the previous section , it is easy to see that role played by interband scattering differs fundamentally . on the one hand ,",
    "tunneling spectroscopy and nonlocal conductance in the absence of interband coupling is not dependent upon the relative phase difference of the two @xmath0-wave order parameters , being merely the sum the contribution from two decoupled @xmath3-wave states . on the other hand , phase information enters explicitly into the calculation of the josephson current , so that the interplay between the phases of the two order parameters is evident also for zero interband coupling .",
    "furthermore , it seems that the behavior observed for the josephson current remains qualitatively unaltered also for finite @xmath28 .",
    "this explains how it seems much more appealing to obtain phase information from multiband superconductors by the use of josephson junctions than by tunneling spectroscopy , and why we will focus our discussion on this experimental probe .    to be able to compare our results for the ballistic limit with our previously obtained results for the diffusive limit in ref .",
    ", we now briefly recapitulate this work .",
    "here we employed the quasiclassical usadel equation@xcite to study josephson coupling in a @xmath3-wave@xmath2n@xmath1-wave junction in the limit of weak proximity effect , an approximation which is warranted for low - transparency interfaces .",
    "we showed that for this case , 0-@xmath4 transitions were observed both as a function of barrier transparency ratio ( for arbitrary gap ratios @xmath206 , @xmath207 ) and as a function of temperature ( for some values of the gap ratios ) . here",
    ", the obtained current - phase relation was purely sinusoidal irrespective of parameter values , a result which can be explained by the fact that the linear usadel equation corresponds to only a 1st order approximation in the interface resistance , so that no 2nd harmonic terms will appear .",
    "our present results , on the other hand , are valid for arbitrary interface resistance , and we see that in this model the 2nd harmonic term plays a crucial role in the behavior of the josephson junction , which we will discuss more below .",
    "we should also remark here on the difference between the diffusive and the ballistic model in that the former in contrast to the latter has a interlayer with finite thickness , which was needed to justify the assumption of weak proximity effect .",
    "the importance of a prospective 2nd harmonic contribution to the josephson current is natural when we are concerned with 0-@xmath4 transitions , as this component may dominate when the 1st harmonic component vanishes close to the transition point .",
    "this fact , and the @xmath139-junction behavior that follows , has been pointed out several times in the context of s@xmath2f@xmath2s junctions @xcite . for our model ,",
    "the influence of the 2nd harmonic is seen to be particularly prevalent in the case of different gap magnitudes and/or high interface transparency . before discussing its implication on the thermal phase shift effect observed here",
    ", we consider the case of more conventional 0-@xmath4 transitions .",
    "most often when establishing 0-@xmath4 transitions in a josephson junction , one looks for a sharp cusp in the critical current as a function of the parameter in question , although this method can not discern which side of the transition represents the 0-state and which represents the @xmath4-state . by using a rf squid configuration @xcite one may however measure the jump in the critical phase difference across the junction , which for a sinusoidal current - phase relation would be from @xmath208 to @xmath209 or vice versa .",
    "( note that it is crucial to this argument that one considers a current - biased experiment in which a current @xmath210 is forced through the junction , letting the phase difference adjust accordingly . ) in the presence of higher harmonics in the current - phase relation the jump from @xmath200 to @xmath201 or vice versa will in general be different , _ cf . _",
    "the transition for varying @xmath116 , but the principle remains the same .",
    "this also holds when the sinusoidal component to the current - phase relation is subdominant for all parameter values , such as for the thermal transitions reported here , so that the critical current is not even close to zero at the transition point . inspecting fig .",
    "[ fig : ic_vs_t_rs05_rd03_w_phi ] , one sees that the critical current does in fact reach a minimum at @xmath202 .",
    "hence this phase - shift effect can be regarded as a degenerate form of 0-@xmath4 transition which can only be established by squid measurement of the critical phase difference .",
    "alternatively , one could of course demonstrate the transition by using squid to map out the entire current - phase relation@xcite , but observing a single phase - shift of the critical phase @xmath149 may be simpler experimentally .    considering then the peak phenomenon described for the temperature dependence of the critical current ,",
    "as pointed out earlier , it does not pertain to the @xmath0-state per se , but is a general result in this framework of two gaps crossing at a certain temperature .",
    "in fact , this even holds when none of the two superconductors are multiband superconductors .",
    "experimentally , this can however be understood to be a somewhat artificial situation , as the phenomenon would not occur for a junction consisting of two conventional superconductors with different zero - temperature gap magnitudes because of the universal ratio @xmath211 for bcs superconductors . and",
    "for _ e.g. _ high-@xmath212 cuprates , for which the corresponding ratio is larger , the value of @xmath213 is typically much larger than for any conventional superconductor as well .",
    "so although multiband superconductors are not necessary as such , the described situation can occur here much more easily because the superconducting pairing for both bands typically vanish at the same critical temperature , whereas the gap ratio @xmath205 .",
    "this is the situation for the conventional multiband superconductor mgb@xmath6@xcite , and also seems to be the case for the iron - based superconductors@xcite .",
    "we should note that similar behavior was not found in the diffusive case@xcite , but that a finite temperature maximum in the critical current for multiband superconductors was predicted in ref .  .",
    "in that case , the effect was however ascribed to thermal effects combined with different sign of the two order parameters , and is not related to gap crossing irrespective of the order parameter sign as in our case .",
    "furthermore , in ref .   as well as in our results for the diffusive case , the current - phase relation was implicitly assumed to be purely sinusoidal , which may explain some of the differences with our present results for the ballistic case .",
    "as the dependence of various observable quantities on the barrier strength ratio @xmath116 was considered frequently throughout sec .",
    "[ sec : jos ] , we would now like to present a more thorough rationale for this parameterization .",
    "firstly , we note that although our model assumes the same fermi wavevector @xmath214 for all bands in all regions of our setups , any fwvm between the different regions is equivalent with an increase in the barrier strength @xmath64 . and for different fermi wavevectors @xmath215 , @xmath216 for the @xmath3-wave superconductor on the left hand side and band 1,2 of the @xmath0-wave superconductor on the right hand side in the josephson junction , respectively , this gives rise to different effective barrier strengths @xmath217 for the two bands .",
    "this line of thought is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fs ] .",
    "the idea of tailoring the experimental setup by the use of materials with appropriate fermi surfaces was first proposed in ref .  , and as we discussed in ref .",
    ", it might be possible to produce a series of junction samples with different barrier strength ratios @xmath116 by varying the doping level in the non-@xmath0-wave region of the junction . in this manner , it is conceivable that a 0-@xmath4 transition can be observed for varying doping level , analogously as to how 0-@xmath4 transitions are observed s@xmath2f@xmath2s junctions for varying interlayer thickness .",
    "the preceding argument naturally raises the question whether it might be more appropriate with a parameterization in which increased transmittance through the barrier for one of the bands was accompanied by decreased transmittance for the other band .",
    "we did nevertheless define @xmath116 as simply the effective barrier strength ratio because it is hard to tell exactly how the relative transmittance will change with doping level .",
    "this does probably also make it quite challenging to experimentally produce the right series of samples to observe 0-@xmath4-transitions , which is what makes possible observable signatures for varying temperature all the more appealing .",
    "finally , we discuss our model in context of the recently discovered iron - based superconductors .",
    "it should be stressed that our model is to be taken as a minimal model describing the generic behavior of transport phenomena in a two - band @xmath0-superconductor , but we would like to point out how a more realistic model should take into account the specifics of the iron - based superconductors .",
    "firstly , the btk approach does not incorporate any details of the band structure , and spherical fermi surfaces are assumed .",
    "secondly , ours is a two - band model whereas it has been argued that at least four bands , two hole - like ( @xmath218 ) and two electron - like ( @xmath219 ) , should be included to capture the physics behind the superconductivity in these materials@xcite .",
    "the main effect of their inclusion from the point of view of transport would be the possibility of @xmath219-@xmath219 and @xmath218-@xmath218 interband scattering between nearly - degenerate electron and hole bands , respectively .",
    "since these scattering processes would involve no internal phase - shift , we expect that the result would be qualitatively similar to the two - band case .",
    "this assumption can also be justified by the fact that @xmath218-@xmath218 and @xmath219-@xmath219 scattering processes should be weak in iron - based superconductors compared to the spin density - wave - enhanced @xmath219-@xmath218 interband processes@xcite , so that we to a good approximation can consider degenerate @xmath219 and @xmath218 bands .",
    "generalization to a non - degenerate four - band model could nevertheless be made in our theory by a straightforward extension of eqs . and , with the inclusion of @xmath218-@xmath218 and",
    "@xmath219-@xmath219 interface scattering terms in eq . ,",
    "although an analytical treatment in that case would be a daunting task .",
    "furthermore , one might have gap magnitudes that were momentum dependent , but the approximation of constant @xmath3-wave gaps on each of the fermi surfaces should be reasonable .",
    "( the possibility of a @xmath220-wave gap or other pairing symmetries with nodes on the fermi surface is left out of the question in this work , since the majority of experiments so far seem to indicate a nodeless gap on the fermi surface . )",
    "another extension would be to include interband scattering in the bulk of the @xmath0-superconductor , and not only near the interfaces as in our case , or even more sophisticated models _",
    "e.g. _ including momentum dependence in @xmath28 .    regarding the magnetic field dependence of the critical josephson current described in sec .",
    "[ sec : fraunhofer ] , we may compare our results with the experimental results for iron - based superconductors available at the moment . inspecting the diffraction pattern in fig .",
    "3 of ref .  , we note an intriguing similarity with ours for @xmath221 in that the critical current is nonvanishing between the diffraction maxima",
    ". this may however just as well be the combined result of nonuniform current distribution , trapped flux and deviation from the small junction limit@xcite , so that we can not with any certainty interpret this observation as evidence for a non - sinusoidal current - phase relation , nor would non - sinusoidality necessarily imply @xmath0-wave pairing .",
    "( the diffraction patterns obtained in refs .   and   can on the other hand not be compared with our results at all , as the experimental situations for those works are different . )",
    "it should also be noted that our modelling of the flux threading the junction is rather simplified , and does not include effects that may be present in real samples @xcite .",
    "more importantly , assuming isotropic order parameters and fermi surfaces , our model is insensitive to how the junction geometry is chosen .",
    "we therefore can not capture the directionality of the electron - like fermi surfaces in the folded brillouin zone of iron - based superconductors , which is essential in other proposals for phase - sensitive corner junctions @xcite and related geometries .",
    "it would also be very interesting to see how robust the results presented here are to the introduction of material impurities .",
    "the iron - based superconductors are mostly expected to reside in some intermediate regime of impurity concentration@xcite , thereby making neither the ballistic nor the diffusive limit a completely accurate description .",
    "in fact , a number of theoretical works@xcite depend upon a significant influence of impurities to explain the experimental results or to induce experimentally observable bound states .",
    "our study in ref .   was motivated by the fact that the diffusive regime is often the experimentally relevant one .",
    "although taking the diffusive limit may not be strictly valid in this case , the results found might nevertheless capture important features of the real materials . in light of this",
    ", it would be very interesting to compare the results obtained in the diffusive and the ballistic limit with calculations performed using the quasiclassical eilenberger equation@xcite , which allows for arbitrary impurity concentration .",
    "this would require a multiband extension of the zaitsev boundary conditions@xcite , and such a theory has only very recently been developed ( see ref .  ) .",
    "possible signatures of @xmath0-wave pairing in tunneling spectroscopy stem mainly from the multigap nature of the superconductor , but also from interference effects when the interband coupling is strong relative to the barrier strength .",
    "this may lead to subgap peaks in the conductance spectra not present for a corresponding @xmath3-wave model , although the appearance of these are relatively sensitive to the parameter values used .",
    "similarly for the nonlocal conductance , it is found to be very difficult to discriminate qualitatively the interference effects of a @xmath0-wave state from those of a two - band @xmath3-wave state .",
    "josephson coupling is on the other hand an intrinsically phase - dependent phenomenon , so it is natural that it is here that we find the most promising signatures of @xmath0-wave pairing , namely 0-@xmath4 transitions or similar phase shifts in a @xmath3-wave@xmath2i@xmath1-wave junction .",
    "these are neither dependent on , nor considerably affected by , the presence of interband coupling . as in the diffusive case@xcite",
    ", we find 0-@xmath4 phase shifts as a function of the relative interface transparency , an effect whose detection is possible in principle , but difficult in practice .",
    "we have also shown that a phase - shift effect is present as a function of temperature , and although this effect is not as robust as the one reported for the diffusive case , it may nevertheless be possible to observe using a squid setup .",
    "for both cases , we have shown how the phase shifts can be ascribed to the competition between andreev bound states for the two bands , and how the non - sinusoidality of the josephson current is essential in the description of the phase shifts .",
    "we have also pointed out that this 2nd harmonic component in the current - phase relation may induce half - integer quantum flux modulations in the magnetic diffraction pattern of the josephson junction .",
    "in addition , we found a peak feature in the temperature dependence of the critical current for the case of different gap magnitudes , an effect ascribed to the crossing of two gaps . although it is hard to tell",
    "how relevant the signatures reported in this simplified model are for possible experimental realizations of the @xmath0-wave pairing state , our results shed more light on the basic mechanisms of transport and their implications in such systems .",
