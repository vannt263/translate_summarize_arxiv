    "extremely red objects ( eros ) , which have optical - to - infrared colors which differ significantly from typical field sources , encompass a wide variety of phenomen .",
    "galaxies of assorted types make up the dominant component of ero samples , but one can also find low mass stars , gravitationally lensed sources , and transient sources such as variable stars , asteroids or supernovae which may not be initially recognized as such .",
    "the term extremely red galaxies ( ergs ) is also commonly used , sometimes interchangeably , but usually refers to a sample of eros which has been cleaned of the objects which are not galaxies .",
    "ergs are therefore a subset of the eros .",
    "we adopt the more general term ero throughout this paper .",
    "both the definition and interpretation of eros has evolved somewhat since their initial discovery , and it is useful to review the subject here for some historical perspective . when first identified as a distinct population of sources  @xcite , eros were thought to be good candidates for primeval galaxies .",
    "subsequent observations  @xcite , however , showed these early eros to be @xmath13 elliptical galaxies .",
    "additional eros were noted in the following years @xcite .",
    "most of these were serendipitous detections , identified on images targeting known , high - redshift radio galaxies or other active galactic nuclei .",
    "little or no followup work was done on these objects at the time , which to some extent reflected the limited capabilities of existing instruments and telescopes .",
    "these eros were identified with colors spanning a wide range : ( @xmath8)@xmath1457 , or ( @xmath7)@xmath1446 .",
    "a resurging interest in eros accompanied the development of the submillimeter common user bolometer array ( * ? ? ? * scuba ) , and the subsequent detection of the extremely red galaxy hr10  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* this source is also known as hr9410 or eroj164502 + 4626.4 ) at 850@xmath15 m  @xcite . at a redshift of 1.44  @xcite ,",
    "the detection of hr10 in the submillimeter implied the presence of massive quantities of dust accompanied by very high star formation rates .",
    "the ero population was thought to provide fertile hunting grounds for more submillimeter - bright galaxies at high redshift .",
    "additional observations have not supported this idea , however , with only a relatively small fraction , on the order of 20%  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* thompson , priv .",
    "comm . ) , of the bright eros ( @xmath16 ) showing strong submillimeter emission .",
    "the development of larger - format infrared arrays and wider field instrumentation enabled subsequent field surveys to cover enough area to assemble significant samples of systematically selected eros for further study , in blank fields  @xcite as well as targeted surveys  @xcite .",
    "@xcite adopted a color selection for eros of ( @xmath8)@xmath1760 . the motivation was that this color was redder than the expected colors of elliptical galaxies with anything but the highest formation redshifts ( @xmath18 ) , and thus represents an extreme color for any normal galaxy .",
    "the assumption at the time was that the extremely red galaxy population consisted of either old ellipticals or young , dusty starbursts  @xcite .",
    "the relative contribution of these two types of galaxies would have a bearing on the timing of massive galaxy formation and their subsequent evolution .",
    "it is important to emphasize that , at that time , the term `` young , dusty starbursts '' referred specifically to massive starbursts like that seen in hr10 or luminous infrared galaxies .",
    "multi - band photometry could potentially distinguish between ellipticals and starbursts  @xcite , but this technique requires very low photometric uncertainties to work well ( see , for example ,  @xcite ) .    in order to better",
    "study the @xmath12 elliptical galaxy population , @xcite adopted a bluer color selection limit , ( @xmath8)@xmath175.3 , set by the expected colors of a @xmath19 passively evolving old stellar population .",
    "this definition , or the roughly equivalent ( @xmath7)@xmath174.0 , for the ero color selection criterion has generally been adopted in the majority of subsequent work .",
    "while there are a number of redshifts now known for eros  @xcite , systematic redshift surveys of complete samples are only now becoming available  @xcite .",
    "morphological information based on high - resolution hst imaging for complete samples of eros are also only now starting to appear  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* this work ) . without similar spectroscopic or morphological information ,",
    "earlier ero surveys divided the ero population into two components : old , evolved systems or dusty , massive starbursts .",
    "but the true nature of k - selected eros is likely to be much more complex , as suggested by recent work  @xcite .",
    "@xcite find a large scatter in the @xmath20 colors of their ero sample , best fit by passive evolution models with extended star formation ( @xmath21  gyr ) .",
    "this implies that the star formation history of eros is more complex than a binary division into evolved ellipticals or dusty , massive starbursts implies . from their k20 survey",
    ",  @xcite found that about half of their spectroscopic sample of @xmath430 eros are dusty star - forming galaxies with emission lines , while the remaining half are old stellar populations with absorption line spectra .",
    "however , the simple presence of line emission could span a wide range of galaxy types , from bulge - dominated , late type spiral galaxies with a small amount of star formation through the more massive starbursts like hr10 .",
    "dust could also completely obscure any on - going star formation , to the point that the optical and uv emission lines are not seen  @xcite .",
    "examples of what appear to be quiescent disks at @xmath22 exist  @xcite .",
    "there are important differences in the formation and evolution of quiescent normal galaxies and young , dusty , massive starbursts .",
    "morphologies have the potential to distinguish between the various interpretations , which motivated this work .    in this paper , we present the high resolution morphologies derived from hst wfpc2 images for a large sample of k - selected eros .",
    "our results reveal for the first time a new type of ero which dominates the population and is neither an early - type galaxy nor a dusty , massive star forming galaxy .",
    "we will also discuss the implications of our results for the past and future evolution of massive galaxies at @xmath12 .",
    "the data used in this survey come from two sources .",
    "deep , high resolution hst / wfpc2 f814w images from archival data , specifically from the medium deep survey ( mds ;  @xcite ) , are used for the optical dataset .",
    "images in the @xmath23 band were obtained from the palomar 60-inch telescope for a total of 77 mds fields .",
    "details on the survey design , observations , reductions and analysis , as well as the details of our visual morphological classification and the automated two - component profile fitting results from the mds , are given below .",
    "in summary , magnitudes were extracted in matched apertures after rotating , rebinning , and convolving the hst data to match the infrared data . a final set of 115 unique eros satisfying the selection criteria ( f814w - k@xmath2 ) @xmath14 4 and with a k - band signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) @xmath24 were identified over a total area of 409 sq .",
    "the coordinates , photometry , and morphological classifications for the 115 eros are listed in table  [ ero_tab ] , along with the field name and source identification from the medium deep survey .",
    "our target fields were selected from the mds database to have a 5@xmath25 sensitivity of f814w@xmath1424@xmath26 ( vega ) , which would provide a good signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) , high resolution optical image for morphological classifications for the majority of the eros we might detect .",
    "this corresponds to a minimum total exposure time of @xmath27s , typically split over 2 or more exposures to aid in the removal of cosmic rays .",
    "we restricted the target fields to high galactic latitudes , @xmath28 , to minimize foreground stellar contamination , and make no explicit corrections for galactic extinction .",
    "for most fields , the color correction is under 01 . finally , we selected primarily northern hemisphere fields ( @xmath29 ) to preserve accessibility from palomar observatory .",
    "the fields were selected without regard to any specific science targets .",
    "the majority of the mds database is composed of random parallel fields imaged while the primary science target was observed in another hst instrument . however , there are a significant number of fields containing known clusters present in the mds database , twelve of which we imaged as part of this survey . gravitational lensing from these foreground clusters ( typically at redshifts of a few tenths )",
    "can boost the observability of faint eros .",
    "this technique has been used with success in surveys targeting eros  @xcite , submillimeter - bright galaxies  @xcite , and other high redshift sources  @xcite .",
    "we note here that any lensing will be unbiased with respect to galaxy morphologies , and so we make no specific corrections for lensing from cluster fields observed in this survey .",
    "lensing can , however , boost the surface densities of eros ( see  [ sdsect ] ) .",
    "we note that there is no overlap in target fields between our survey and that of  @xcite .",
    "we retrieved the f814w images from the mds database at space telescope science institute ( see http://archive.stsci.edu/mds/cdrom.html ) .",
    "these data have been processed through the mds data reduction pipeline , which includes warm pixel correction , image stacking , removal of cosmic rays , and photometric calibration . for a complete description of the mds reduction pipeline ,",
    "see  @xcite . in general",
    ", this automated reprocessing produces the best results on fields where multiple ( n@xmath173 ) , dithered images were obtained , and where the field and its immediate surroundings are free of bright stars .",
    "these processed images are stored in the mds database in the hst standard geis format , where each of the 4 ccds and their associated header information is stored in a separate layer of the disk file .    for each of our target fields",
    ", we retrieved these geis format images , then processed them further to meet the needs of our survey .",
    "the data were processed using standard iraf tasks , plus specialized routines developed for wfpc data found in the stsdas package .",
    "first , we interpolated over bad pixels flagged by the mds processing , subtracted the background , and corrected any additional deviant pixels identified by the cosmicray routine .",
    "the stsdas task wmosaic was used to correct for distortion in the wfpc2 images and assemble the data from the four separate ccds into a single mosaic image .",
    "this additional processing does miss some cosmic rays , but any contamination of the eros is minimal , and only serves to make the sources bluer than they would otherwise be .",
    "ground - based @xmath23 images were obtained using the near - ir camera on the palomar 60  inch telescope  @xcite .",
    "the camera has a @xmath30 field of view , well - matched to wfpc2 .",
    "the detector is a 256@xmath31 pixel hgcdte , covering 062 per pixel .",
    "a total of 42 nights went into this project , spanning the time period of 2000 august 11  2001 june 06 ut .",
    "useful data was collected on 21 photometric nights .",
    "we imaged 77 mds fields under photometric conditions , with repeat observations on about one - third of the fields to help determine the photometric uncertainties .",
    "the repeat observations show less than 01 of systematic variations .",
    "we targeted exposure times of 75 minutes ( 4500 seconds ) per field , which yields a 5@xmath25 point - source sensitivity of @xmath321875 in good seeing .",
    "the data were reduced following standard infrared reduction procedures .",
    "each frame was sky - subtracted with temporally - adjacent images and then flatfielded with a combination of dome and twilight sky flats .",
    "offsets were determined from as many sources as possible ( with a minimum of one , as the header coordinates were insufficiently accurate to stack the data with confidence ) .",
    "a bad pixel mask was used to reject dead or excessively hot pixels , and the data combined with integer pixel offsets into the final mosaics for each field .",
    "observations of the persson infrared photometric standards ( persson et al 1996 ) were obtained throughout the night , and used to derive the zero points and airmass corrections .",
    "for the photometric data , the zero points show only 0.02 mag rms variations from night to night .",
    "this is added into the photometric uncertainties of individual objects in quadrature .",
    "the 5@xmath25 sensitivities in the centers of the infrared mosaics ranges from 182 @xmath33 195 .",
    "this was calculated from the per - pixel sky noise at the center of the infrared mosaics , and scaled to an aperture diameter equal to 2.5 times the fwhm of the seeing .",
    "the seeing ranges from 12 to 25 , with the majority of the data better than 18 ( 3 pixels fwhm ) .",
    "the lower sensitivities are generally due to poorer seeing conditions , while the deeper data are from stacking observations from multiple nights .",
    "a summary of the useful observations are given in table  [ obs_tab ] , which lists the field , exposure times for both the @xmath23 and f814w images , and the central 5@xmath25 @xmath23 sensitivity .",
    "the original full resolution f814w images were rotated , rebinned and convolved to match the infrared image orientation , scale and seeing .",
    "the optical and infrared images were then co - aligned and cropped to matching areas on the sky .",
    "the resulting image pairs were used for extraction of the photometry .",
    "a set of iraf scripts were written to speed the execution of these and subsequent tasks in creating the final photometric catalogs .",
    "because the k - band image mosaics have increasing noise at the edges , source detection was performed on a noise normalized image so that a uniform detection threshold could be applied .",
    "the noise normalization was done by multiplying the k - band image mosaic by the square root of an exposure time map .",
    "we used the source extractor software  @xcite for the initial source detection on the k - band data .",
    "however , uncorrected distortions and/or small residual offsets between the image pairs ultimately required recentering on objects in the scaled and seeing - convolved hst data .",
    "re - centering of the photometric apertures on the hst data was reviewed interactively for all sources with initial colors greater than ( @xmath34 ) @xmath17 38 , as illustrated in figure  [ mdsreview ] .",
    "this review process also allowed for rejection of spurious sources from the photometric catalog , as well as noting the effects of uncorrected cosmic rays or contamination from nearby galaxies .",
    "note the complete lack of morphological information in the ground - based imaging , while the full - resolution image clearly shows a galaxy with a disk .",
    "the final aperture photometry was extracted using the apphot package in iraf .",
    "we adopted an aperture diameter of 2.5 times the seeing fwhm of the corresponding k - band image .",
    "this represents a compromise between a larger aperture , which yields a fairer measurement of a galaxy s total magnitude as well as provides a better measure for intrinsically large galaxies , and a smaller aperture , which would minimize contamination from other sources close to the line - of - sight to the ero .",
    "the majority of the k - band data are better than 18 fwhm ( 3 pixels ) , so the photometry was extracted in apertures typically smaller than 45 in diameter . because the k - band images have non - uniform noise and depth , the snr for each galaxy was determined locally . for faint objects ,",
    "the snr is dominated by the sky noise within the photometric aperture .    in 20%  of the cases ,",
    "the photometric apertures do include close companions which could affect the f814w photometry .",
    "this has the effect of making our measured colors for these objects bluer than the true color of the ero , and thus a lower limit .",
    "we were able to correct for the majority of contamination problems during the review process , but we note that the presence of companions should not be biased toward any particular morphological type .      because our survey is composed of many separate images obtained on different nights , under different seeing conditions , and with different exposure times , the depth of each field varies .",
    "also , since the infrared camera field size is only slightly larger than the hst wfpc2 mosaic , and given the random orientations for the hst data , portions of the hst images often overlap the higher - noise area around the edges of the infrared mosaics .",
    "these factors combine to make the total survey area a function of the depth , while allowing maximal use of the survey data .",
    "we integrated the survey area as a function of magnitude on a per pixel basis .",
    "ideally , this should be done over resolution elements .",
    "however , aside from single - pixel deviations due to masked bad pixels or cosmic rays , the depth in the infrared data only changes relatively slowly with position around the edges .",
    "to sum the survey area , we first created a mask for the co - aligned images covering the area on the sky outside the borders of the wfpc2 data .",
    "an effective exposure time map for the infrared mosaic was then converted into a map of the limiting magnitude in each pixel as :    @xmath35    where @xmath36 is the exposure time that went into the individual pixels in the final infrared mosaic , and @xmath37 is the total exposure time for that image .",
    "a histogram of the unmasked pixel limiting magnitudes ( pixels also covered by the hst data ) was then created for each survey image in 01 bins .",
    "the resulting 77 histograms were combined , and scaled by the area per pixel .",
    "this differential area histogram was finally integrated from the faint to the bright limits .",
    "a plot of the integrated area as a function of the limiting magnitude is shown in figure  [ surveyarea ] .",
    "the full survey area is 409 square arcmin , with more than half of this ( 228 sq .",
    "arcmin ) reaching to at least a depth of @xmath381875 .",
    "a total of 115 unique galaxies satisfy the selection criteria of ( f814w - k@xmath2 ) @xmath14 4 and with a k - band signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) @xmath24 , were selected over a total area of 409 sq .",
    "the coordinates , photometry , and morphological classifications for these 115 eros are listed in table  [ ero_tab ] , along with the field name and source numerical identification from the medium deep survey .",
    "we show the combined color - magnitude diagram for all 77 fields in figure  [ fullcmd ] .",
    "all independent observations are included , so some sources are plotted more than once . in figure  [ zoomcmd ]",
    "we detail the photometric uncertainties on the ero sample .",
    "not included in table  [ ero_tab ] are six sources which were obvious stars , most of which were not intrinsically red but simply saturated on the hst images .",
    "we also excluded the gravitationally lensed system mg 0414@xmath390534",
    "@xcite , which does satisfy the adopted selection criteria , but was the science target for the hst observations and thus was not a randomly selected source .",
    "the main goal of this survey is to utilize the high resolution wfpc2 images to study the morphological properties of eros .",
    "we classified the sources visually , but also compare our results to the automated profile fitting from the mds .",
    "the details are described below .",
    "the full - resolution hst / wfpc2 images of all of the eros in our sample are shown in figure  [ hstimgs ] .",
    "the authors strongly caution the reader against attempting to morphologically classify the eros solely from these grayscale images .",
    "the hst data are freely available from stsci , and interested readers are encouraged to retrieve the original data .",
    "visual morphological classification on nearby galaxies has had a significant impact on our understanding of galaxy formation , environment , and evolution .",
    "however , it is widely acknowledged that visual classification is an inherently uncertain and subjective process . in the high redshift regime ,",
    "the visual classification of galaxy morphology is further complicated by limited resolution ( even with hst ) , lower snr , @xmath40 cosmological dimming , and observations at restframe wavelengths which vary with the redshift .",
    "several detailed studies on the biases in visual morphological classifications of high redshift galaxies have been made  @xcite . despite its inherent uncertainties and subjectiveness ,",
    "visual morphological classification has proved to be a powerful tool for galaxies at @xmath12 , as demonstrated by by many studies using deep hst images in the hdf , as well as morphological studies of galaxies in high - redshift clusters  @xcite .",
    "one important point illustrated in these empirical studies , and also in simulations @xcite , is that the extended morphological features remain readily visible in deep hst f814w images out to @xmath12 . in light of this",
    ", we have visually classified all the eros in our sample .",
    "because of the bright k@xmath2 magnitude limits in this survey , all 115 galaxies in our sample are detected in the f814w images , most well resolved and with a high snr . as a training set for our visual classification , we examined in detail the f814w images from the mds database for _ all _ of the galaxies in @xmath41 cluster cl1603@xmath394304 , which is one of the target fields included in this work ( u2845 ) .",
    "most of the cluster members are much brighter than the eros .",
    "since the cluster is quite distant , the cluster members have similar apparent sizes and suffer from similar cosmological dimming as the eros .",
    "morphological classifications for these galaxies were published in  @xcite .",
    "working down the full range of apparent magnitudes , it was increasingly difficult to classify the fainter galaxies into the traditional galaxy morphological types ( elliptical , s0 , sa / sb / sc spirals , irregulars ) , although it was still possible to distinguish between spheroidal systems ( presumably mostly elliptical and s0 galaxies ) and disky systems ( sb / sc / irr ) .",
    "spirals of type sa represent a somewhat fuzzy boundary . depending on the snr or strength of any ongoing star formation",
    ", these could be classified either way .",
    "we therefore opted to simplify our morphological classification of the eros .",
    "we visually classified the galaxy morphologies into four broad categories .",
    "these categories were selected to parallel the mds classifications , as well as reflect the difficulties in placing faint , high - redshift sources into the traditional morphological classes , however there are close parallels between the two systems .",
    "eros classified as spheroids or pure bulge galaxies ( b ) show no convincing evidence for the presence of a disk .",
    "bulge - dominated ( bd ) systems show evidence of a disk , but the majority of the luminosity is coming from the spheroidal component , and any disk component is generally featureless .",
    "disky systems with some evidence of a bulge ( db ) generally show some evidence for structure in the disk ( e.g. spiral arms or dust features ) , and the luminosity is not generally dominated by the spheroidal component .",
    "finally , disks ( d ) do not show any obvious bulge component , and often have mottling or other structure visible in the disk .",
    "some sources were too low of a snr to classify , so they were listed as unclassifiable ( u ) .",
    "we further noted whether the ero appeared to be undergoing a strong merger or interaction with other nearby galaxies regardless of their color .",
    "all of the eros in our hst images were classified independently on a video display by both authors .",
    "we then combined the classifications and reviewed the sources together to resolve the disagreements , which involved @xmath420% of the sample , and to settle on a final classification .",
    "we also reviewed the eros grouped into their separate categories .",
    "this review involved looking at our reprocessed images as well as the mds pipeline - processed images .      for a more quantitative analysis of the galaxy properties",
    ", we utilized the galaxy profile fitting results from the mds database . for almost all of our eros ,",
    "the mds database includes a set of morphological parameters derived from their automated object detection and classification algorithms .",
    "more detailed information on the entire mds reduction pipeline and morphological classification process can be found in  @xcite and  @xcite , as well on the mds website at http://astro.phys.cmu.edu/mds.html .",
    "the mds automated object classification involved a two - dimensional maximum likelihood estimator ( mle ) analysis that automatically optimizes the model and the number of parameters to be fitted to each object image .",
    "two scale - free , axisymmetric models are chosen to describe the galaxy profile .",
    "the spheroidal component , which would include elliptical galaxies and the bulges of spirals , is assumed to follow a de vaucouleurs profile , while the extended disk component follows an exponential profile .",
    "each profile is characterized by a major axis half - light radius and axis ratio .",
    "point - like stellar sources are examined through the same procedure , except that a gaussian profile is used .",
    "a maximum likelihood parameter estimation is used to determine the best model and the parameter values . for each set of model parameters , a model image of the object",
    "is created and compared with the actual object images .",
    "finally , a best - fit model and its parameters are classified with the following categories for resolved sources : bulge , bulge@xmath39disk , disk , and galaxy ( generally for low snr sources where neither a bulge nor disk classification is significant ) .",
    "we use the model bulge to total luminosity ratio to divide bulge@xmath39disk galaxies into our classes bd ( for @xmath42 ) and db . this method does not classify irregulars , mergers , or interacting systems as such .",
    "figure  [ crossclass ] shows a comparison of the visual and mds classification results for eros classified by both methods .",
    "we group the b and bd classes under the label `` spheroids '' and the db and d classes under the label `` disks . ''",
    "the darker gray areas show where the two methods agree reasonably well , while the lighter gray areas show the disagreements .",
    "overall , the agreement is good , where both the `` spheroids '' and `` disks . '' in the two classification methods agree at the 70% level .",
    "the largest source of disagreement comes from eros which were visually classified as db ( disk with a bulge ) , but which the mds classified as a pure bulge .",
    "a majority of these systems are relatively faint in the hst images , where it can be difficult to distinguish between an extended spheroid or a disk , but also acknowledge the possibility of a fundamental failure in properly classifying sources visually .",
    "most of the remaining disagreement stems from the split between bd and db , and can be tuned out by modifying the division in the mds bulge - to - total luminosity ratio from the arbitrary 50% bulge - to - total adopted for this study .",
    "our morphologies are based on f814w images . assuming the median redshift of one for eros from the  @xcite sample with k@xmath43 , the wfpc2 data sample a rest - frame wavelength of 4100 .",
    "the f814w images thus represent a compromise between sensitivity to star formation at shorter restframe wavelengths and better probing any extended old stellar populations at longer restframe wavelengths . as shown in simulations by  @xcite",
    ", morphological classifications using f814w images do not show any significant biases at @xmath12 .    using the results from our visual classification",
    ", we find that 30@xmath55% of our eros have morphologies consistent with spheroidal ( b and bd ) galaxies .",
    "disks ( d and db ) dominate the eros at 64@xmath57%   of the sample .",
    "only 6% of the eros were unclassifiable , due primarily to low snr on the wfpc images .",
    "the uncertainties are derived simply from the square root of the number of eros in that subset , and does not try to include the unclassifiable sources .",
    "we plot in figure  [ relfrac ] the relative fractions of spheroids and disks in our visual classification as well as from the mds profile fitting .",
    "we find that the relative morphological mix of eros in subsets constructed of the eros in known foreground galaxy cluster fields vs. those selected in the remaining `` blank '' fields is consistent to within the uncertainties .",
    "since any lensing should be unbiased with respect to background galaxy morphologies , we do not differentiate between cluster and field sources in the remaining analysis .",
    "some of the eros , including both disks and spheroids , appear to be involved in recent mergers or show evidence of strong interactions ( e.g. tidal tails , strong asymmetries ) .",
    "these comprise 17@xmath54% of the sample . without additional information ,",
    "these systems represent the most likely source of possible large - scale starbursts .",
    "this is consistent with the observation that among _ bright _ eros , roughly 20% have 850@xmath15 m detections  @xcite .",
    "one third of the galaxies we classed as spheroids have one or more faint companions or show signs of recent interaction , suggesting that a significant fraction of otherwise old stellar populations may not be in purely passively evolving systems .",
    "the morphological classifications derived from the mds profile fitting are largely consistent with our visual results , but show a slightly higher fraction of spheroidal galaxies , with 37@xmath56% of the sample classed as b or bd ( with a bulge fraction larger than 50% ) .",
    "there is a corresponding drop in the disk fraction , with 50@xmath57% classed as db or d , but disks still dominate the overall @xmath44 ero population .",
    "a larger fraction of the sample , 14@xmath53% , were not fit with the bulge@xmath39disk models due to low snr or a more conservative avoidance of the ccd edges in the wfpc2 data .",
    "we find that our ero sample selected with @xmath45 is dominated by disk galaxies , and not by spheroids or strongly interacting systems .",
    "the star formation rates in these disks could span a wide range , including normal galaxies with fairly quiescent star formation .",
    "hr10 type systems , with mostly young stars and undergoing massive starbursts , may comprise only a small fraction of the sample .",
    "the origins of their red colors may be traced to a significant old stellar population combined with some dust extinction , especially considering the edge - on orientation of many of the disks in our sample of eros .",
    "even though most of the stellar mass may already be in place by @xmath46 for these eros , such a large fraction of disk galaxies implies that there is still a substantial amount of gas available to feed on - going star formation .",
    "the existence of such a large fraction of disk galaxies and interacting systems in our sample suggests that hierarchical merging may be an important mechanism for the formation and evolution of the ero population .",
    "however , the scenario in which ellipticals were formed in a `` monolithic collapse '' at high redshifts and evolve passively thereafter can not be excluded . while 30% of our ero sample are clearly early type galaxies , whose colors are consistent with old stellar populations formed at high redshifts .",
    "we also found that one - third of the spheroids in our sample have faint companions or signs of interaction .",
    "this suggests that although a majority of their mass could be assembled rapidly at high redshift , these systems are not simply isolated , passively evolving old stellar populations , and continuing accretion of gas or merger events plays a significant role in their evolution .",
    "examples of secondary star formation in field e / s0s ( @xmath47 ) can be found in  @xcite .",
    "our results contradict those of  @xcite , which are also based on hst morphologies .",
    "they find that 5080%  of their sample have e / s0 morphologies on the basis of one - component exponential model fits .",
    "however , we note that their ero sample was assembled from the published literature , with the corresponding heterogeneous selection functions of the original surveys . in addition , the morphologies were determined on hst images from both wfpc2 and nicmos , probing widely different rest - frame wavelengths and thus differing sensitivities to star formation or old stellar population .      the integrated surface density of eros ,",
    "is defined as total number of eros brighter than a given magnitude per unit area on the sky . because the area covered in this survey",
    "is a function of the magnitude , the differential number of eros selected in each magnitude bin is a function of both the magnitude and the area surveyed . calculating the integrated surface density thus required rescaling the number of eros in each of the brighter bins by the appropriate area ratio prior to integration .",
    "we plot the resulting surface density of eros from our survey derived by this method in figure  [ surfdens ] ( filled diamonds ) .",
    "the uncertainties were derived simply from the square root of the rescaled number of eros .    for comparison",
    ", we also plot in figure  [ surfdens ] the results from other recent surveys  @xcite .",
    "the primary difficulty in making such comparisons is that each survey used a different set of filters and different selection criteria for identifying eros . in order to make a general comparison between these disparate surveys ,",
    "we make several simplifying assumptions .",
    "first , we treat all k filters as functionally equivalent ( e.g. @xmath48 ) , so no color terms are applied to convert magnitudes between them .",
    "the same is true for the several different i filters and r filters used .",
    "we note that these assumptions are generally made in most recent published ero surveys unless the color selection limit is explicitly tied to some fiducial model sed , typically a passively evolving @xmath49 old stellar population ( i.e. elliptical galaxies ) , _ and _ the specific filters used for the survey .",
    "second , we adopt the generic colors of ( @xmath50)@xmath5113 and ( @xmath52)@xmath5110 to convert the surveys based on r band or h band data to our @xmath7 colors .",
    "third , we plot without additional correction the  @xcite results , even though they select eros at a bluer limit : ( @xmath53)@xmath1450 .",
    "finally , we adopt the  @xcite results directly for ( @xmath54)@xmath1437 , which they show to be equivalent to ( @xmath7)@xmath1440 for that filter set .",
    "while the generic color conversions we adopt obviate the possibility of more detailed comparisons between the different ero surveys , they do allow us to consider broad trends in the surface densities as a function of the selection filters .",
    "first , the two i - band based surveys ( this work and  @xcite ) agree quite well over the region @xmath55 .",
    "this suggests that our sample is neither significantly inhomogeneous nor incomplete over this range , although the turnover in counts to fainter magnitudes suggests incompleteness in our sample for @xmath56 .",
    "the two larger r - band based surveys  @xcite also agree with each other over this same range in k - band magnitude , but are systematically about a factor of three lower than the i - band surveys .",
    "the lensing - corrected surface density of eros from the cluster - pointed survey of  @xcite , despite using an r - band filter , agrees well with the i - band based surveys at brighter magnitudes ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "the other two surveys ,  @xcite , differ from the other results .    aside from the uncertainties in converting from one filter system to another , there are two primary effects which can qualitatively account for the similarities and differences in the surface densities of eros from these different surveys : cosmic variance , and color selection effects . both the  @xcite and  @xcite surveys cover relatively small , connected areas on the sky , and are thus more subject to cosmic variance , especially considering the strong clustering seen in  @xcite .",
    "the  @xcite survey is composed of 10 widely - separated sight lines and thus should be less sensitive to cosmic variance , but their sample does show a wide field - to - field variation in the number of eros .",
    "@xcite selects eros at a bluer limit , ( @xmath53)@xmath1450 , which likely contributes to their higher ero surface density .",
    "a color selection effect may contribute to the apparent differences in surface density between r - band based  @xcite and i - band based ( this work and  @xcite ) ero surveys .",
    "we offer below ( see  [ colsel ] ) a qualitative argument on this , as we do not have a proper multiband deep survey to address this with real data .",
    "we can make an estimate of the volume density of eros with some assumptions on the range of redshifts at which they may be found , and compare these results with the local density of massive galaxies .",
    "the color selection limit of ( @xmath7)@xmath1440 sets the lower redshift bound to @xmath19 , which is appropriate for passively evolving old stellar populations . however , photometric uncertainties could make this @xmath19 boundary somewhat fuzzy .",
    "galaxies with significant dust extinction ( see the following section ) could also lie at lower redshifts .",
    "@xcite obtained spectroscopic redshifts for a sample of eros with ( @xmath8)@xmath175 which includes sources of both types down to @xmath58 .",
    "we adopt an upper cutoff to the assumed redshift range of @xmath59 , as higher redshift eros would be anomalously luminous given their bright @xmath60-band magnitudes .    under the above assumptions ,",
    "we derive a co - moving volume covered by our survey to be @xmath61mpc@xmath62 .",
    "this volume is only weakly dependent on the assumed redshift range , and only changes by a factor of two if the redshift range is narrowed to @xmath63 or broadened to @xmath64 .",
    "this volume was derived from the total survey area of 409 square arcminutes , and does not take into account the variable survey depth with magnitude .",
    "the galaxies classed as spheroids in our survey have a co - moving volume density of @xmath65mpc@xmath66 .",
    "the disks have a co - moving volume density about twice as large , and the total ero sample ( 115 eros ) reach a density of @xmath67mpc@xmath66 .",
    "to compare with nearby massive galaxies , we adopt the local k - band luminosity functions for early - type and late type galaxies from  @xcite .",
    "we integrate from 10l@xmath68 down to 1l@xmath68 , which corresponds to our k - band limit at @xmath19 after correcting for passive evolution and cosmological k - corrections .",
    "we find that the eros can account for only one - third of the local massive galaxies , and that the relative morphological mix is about the same in the two samples .",
    "this is reasonable , but should be considered only an order - of - magnitude agreement given the factors of @xmath42 uncertainties in the volume densities arising from the assumptions on the redshift distributions , area surveyed as a function of depth (  [ sec : area ] ) , and contamination (  [ sec : eodisks ] ) .",
    "while classifying the eros , we also noted that 40% of the disky systems ( db and d ) appeared to be sufficiently edge - on that even small amounts of dust in a disk could have a disproportionately large effect on the overall system color .",
    "these systems are noted in table  [ ero_tab ] with italicized entries under morphology : _ db _ and _ d _ , and we show two examples of edge - on eros in figure  [ edgeon ] .",
    "this is far more than expected from a set of randomly oriented galaxies , suggesting that orientation effects are responsible for their inclusion in the ero sample .",
    "given the potentially large extinctions possible from dust in otherwise normal disk galaxies , it is possible that the edge - on systems are at lower redshift ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "several of these show extended disks of large apparent size ( several arcseconds ) , which would be unusually large ( tens of kiloparsecs ) if at @xmath12 or more .",
    "the edge - on systems comprise half of the disky eros , or one - third of the total ( @xmath7 ) selected ero sample .",
    "they thus represent a large and previously unanticipated source of contamination in the ero population .",
    "how comparable are ero samples selected using an @xmath70 color versus an @xmath71 color ?",
    "this important issue has never been clearly addressed .",
    "we investigated this issue using model spectral energy distributions , but lack the necessary multiband data to compare to the models .",
    "deep , wide - field infrared / optical surveys should be able to address this point in more detail .",
    "in figure  [ modelrik ] we plot the ( @xmath8 ) vs. ( @xmath7 ) colors for a  @xcite model approximating an old stellar population ( osp , @xmath72 ) or passively evolving elliptical galaxy .",
    "we also plot two models with longer exponential decay times ( @xmath73 ) but differing formation redshifts ( @xmath74 ) , which should contain a significant fraction of old stars in the range of @xmath75 , but still have some residual star formation .",
    "a similar plot covering the @xmath76 color - color plane can be found in  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* their figure 2 ) .",
    "their data show that eros selected with ( @xmath77)@xmath143 have a wide scatter in the @xmath20 color , which the authors interpreted as due to prolonged star formation .",
    "the two dotted lines in figure  [ modelrik ] mark the fiducial colors ( @xmath78)@xmath5153 and ( @xmath79)@xmath5140 , representing the colors of a @xmath19 passively - evolving elliptical galaxy used by most surveys to select eros .",
    "the squares mark the @xmath12 points in each model curve .",
    "assumptions on the models used , as well as the assumed cosmology and the specific filter bandpasses used for ero surveys can account for several tenths of a magnitude variation in the expected colors of a @xmath19 passively - evolving elliptical galaxy .    several predictions can be made from this color selection effect .",
    "first , is that both r - band and i - band based ero surveys should select the",
    "_ same population _ of passively - evolving old stellar populations ( elliptical galaxies ) .",
    "second , i - band based ero surveys should preferentially include disk galaxies .",
    "light from a bulge comprised of older stars would dominate the ( @xmath7 ) color , while even small amounts of residual star formation in the disk keeps them too blue in ( @xmath50 ) to be included in an ( @xmath8 ) selected sample .",
    "other factors , such as dust extinction , may counteract the star - formation and contribute significantly to their overall color .",
    "this implies that ero samples selected on their ( @xmath78 ) color may not be comparable to samples selected on their ( @xmath79 ) color .",
    "figure  [ modelrik ] can also be used to set some constraints on the formation redshift for the eros .",
    "models with exponential decay times longer than about 1.5gyr ( @xmath80 ) , or with a formation redshift lower than five ( @xmath81 ) simply have too much residual star formation . without any reddening from dust , the blue light from a young population of stars",
    "would be sufficient to drop these galaxies out of either ( @xmath8 ) or ( @xmath7 ) samples of eros .",
    "thus , the brighter eros classed as spheroids , especially those without any evidence of a disk or ongoing star formation , are likely to have formed a majority of their stars at relatively high redshift ( @xmath82 ) .    the morphological mix in our sample of relatively bright , ( @xmath7)-selected eros is similar to that of  @xcite among a sample of fainter eros ( @xmath83 , @xmath84 ) identified in the fields of foreground clusters massive enough to gravitationally lens the higher redshift eros .",
    "they classify 18% of their sample as compact , and 50% as irregulars ( including disk - like systems ) , while 32% are too faint to be classified .    considering redder subsamples from both this work ( @xmath85 ) and  @xcite ( @xmath86 )",
    ", we again find similar results . of the 11 redder eros in our sample ,",
    "nine were classifiable .",
    "of these nine , 89@xmath531% have disk morphologies , a much higher fraction than in the full sample .",
    "the redder  @xcite subsample has @xmath490% with disk / irregular morphologies .",
    "the expectation from the color selection effect is that ( r - k ) samples should contain a higher fraction of spheroids at a given @xmath60 magnitude limit .",
    "however , the fainter  @xcite sample , about three magnitudes deeper than our ero sample , is composed primarily of irregulars and disks .",
    "this suggests that the morphological mix of eros does change at fainter magnitudes , and  @xcite conclusion that fainter and redder samples are dominated by massive , dusty starbursts does not contradict our findings .",
    "clearly , this color selection effect needs to be investigated further , with larger and deeper samples of eros with both ( r - k ) and ( i - k ) selection on the same area of sky , so that a proper comparison can be made .",
    "our results highlight the complex nature of optical / near - ir color selected eros .",
    "the high resolution hst morphologies indicate that disks are the dominant constituent of the bright ( @xmath87mag ) ero population selected with an @xmath88 color greater than or equal to 4 magnitudes .",
    "galaxies classified as spheroids , which can be considered comparable to passively evolving elliptical or s0 galaxies , and strongly interacting systems which may represent dusty starbursts , only contribute small fractions to the total ero population .",
    "there are real differences in the surface densities of eros selected by their @xmath89 color as compared to the @xmath88 samples , which may reflect a preferential selection of disks in i - band based ero surveys and in any case complicates the comparison of various surveys and their interpretation .",
    "in addition , edge - on disk galaxies comprise a significant fraction of our ero sample : 40% of the disks , or 28% of the full sample . even small amounts of dust in this orientation",
    "could redden otherwise normal disk galaxies at lower redshift ( @xmath69 ) sufficiently to be included in the ero samples .",
    "our results imply that hierarchical merging and continuing accretion of gas still play an important and continuing role in the evolution of massive galaxies , even though most of their stellar mass may already be in place by @xmath12 .",
