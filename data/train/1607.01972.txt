    "when the stars in the solar neighbourhood ( snhd ) are binned by age , the velocity dispersion of each bin increases with its age . this age - velocity dispersion relation ( avr )",
    "has been known and studied for decades ( e.g. @xcite ) and similar relations have now also been inferred for external galactic discs ( @xcite for m33 , @xcite for m31 ) .",
    "it is generally agreed that understanding the physics that establishes the avr would be a significant step towards understanding how galaxies form and evolve .    despite many efforts ,",
    "the shape of the avr is still not adequately constrained .",
    "the major constraints on the avr come from observations of stars in the snhd",
    ". the measured ages of stars suffer from substantial errors , and samples of stars with measured ages typically have a selection function that favours young stars over old @xcite . alternatively modelling the velocity dispersions as functions of stellar",
    "colour has been used to determine the shape of the avr ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter ab09 ) .",
    "whereas the vertical density profile of the milky way ( mw ) is well fitted by a double - exponential in @xmath8 , the avr is typically described as a simple power - law in age @xmath9 with exponent @xmath6 .",
    "@xcite claimed to detect a jump in the vertical avr for ages @xmath10 and connected this jump to the double - exponential nature of the density profile .",
    "however , more recent studies find that the avr in the snhd can be reasonably described by a single power - law ( @xcite , ab09 ) .",
    "moreover , @xcite demonstrated that the observed vertical density profile is fitted well by a model in which the histories of star formation and disc heating are continuous , and @xcite showed that subsets of stars selected at different points in the @xmath11,[\\hbox{fe / h}])$ ] abundance plane have scale heights that vary continuously , with no evidence for a dichotomy .    to constrain the heating processes responsible for the snhd avr ,",
    "three diagnostics have been used in addition to the value of @xmath6 : ( i ) the axis ratios @xmath7 of the velocity ellipsoids of old and young populations ; ( ii ) the magnitude @xmath12 of @xmath13 for the oldest populations ; ( iii ) the vertical density profile of the mw s disc .",
    "several physical processes work together to establish the avr",
    ". the goals of this paper are to deepen our understanding of the collaboration of secular heating processes and to show how the avr responds to one or the other process playing a more prominent role .",
    "external heating due to interaction with dark substructure is not considered in this paper .",
    "@xcite showed that scattering of stars off small - scale irregularities in the potential of the galactic disc would transform the nearly circular orbits of young stars , which reflect their origin from the gas disc , into orbits with higher radial and vertical energy .",
    "the discovery of giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) with masses @xmath14 provided a suitable candidate for the heating agent . using analytic arguments , @xcite showed that gmc heating could have contributed significantly to the observed avr , but that the dispersion @xmath12 of the oldest stars could be reproduced only if the masses and / or number density of gmcs was significantly higher in the past than they are now .",
    "lacey further derived values @xmath15 and @xmath16 that are , respectively , larger and smaller than the data indicate .",
    "@xcite used analytical calculations more sophisticated than that of lacey to show that scattering by gmcs in discs actually yields values @xmath17 that are consistent with observations .",
    "this was confirmed with particle simulations by @xcite and @xcite : to obtain correct values it is essential to take into account that in a thin disc impact parameters are concentrated towards the galactic plane , whereas lacey had assumed an isotropic distribution of impact parameters @xcite .",
    "however , the conflict between observations and lacey s values for @xmath6 and @xmath12 remained @xcite .",
    "gmcs are not the only sources of a non - axisymmetric component to the gravitational field experienced by disc stars , and any such component will heat the disc .",
    "@xcite showed that spiral structure could significantly heat the disc , when the spiral pattern has either a very high density contrast or is of a transient and recurring nature .",
    "two - dimensional simulations of discs continuously fed with young , cold particles showed that transient and recurrent spiral structure is always present in star forming discs and provides sufficient heating to explain the in - plane avr @xcite . from such two - dimensional simulations and analytical arguments for vertical cloud heating , @xcite concluded that a combination of gmc and spiral heating could explain the observations .",
    "however , spirals do not directly increase @xmath13 significantly ( e.g.@xcite ) , and the question remained open whether deflections by gmcs can convert in - plane heat to vertical heat in an appropriate manner . @xcite used analytic arguments to examine this question for growing discs .",
    "they concluded that the observed value of @xmath7 could be explained , but the observed value of @xmath12 was problematic .",
    "another continuous secular heating process that has been discussed in the literature is heating by the bar @xcite .",
    "the interaction of galactic discs with satellite galaxies and the corresponding dark matter substructure can also cause disc heating @xcite .",
    "however , in the case of the mw this process has likely only made a minor contribution to the observed avrs @xcite .",
    "another contributor to the avr could be a decline over cosmic time in the velocity dispersion of stars at their time of birth as discs have become less gas - rich and and less turbulent @xcite .",
    "these models are motivated by observations of gas kinematics in disc galaxies at various redshifts , mostly based on h@xmath18 emission .",
    "these observations have revealed significantly ( @xmath19 times ) higher velocity dispersions @xmath20 at redshifts @xmath21 than in corresponding observations of the local universe ( e.g. @xcite ) , and a decline of @xmath20 with decreasing redshift @xcite .",
    "it is , however , unclear how the kinematics of young stars which form from cold gas , relate to these observations .",
    "fully cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation have recently reached reasonable levels of success in reproducing mw like disc galaxies and the avrs in some of these simulations have been studied @xcite . at @xmath22",
    "the stellar populations in the majority of these simulations are significantly hotter than the stars in the mw at all ages ( but see model _",
    "g92 _ of martig et al . ) .",
    "especially young stars have overly high @xmath13 which has been linked to numerical effects and insufficient resolution and shown to depend on the specifics of the numerical sub - grid star - formation models @xcite .",
    "better agreement with the snhd avr is generally found for galaxies unaffected by mergers .",
    "martig et al .",
    "find that the thin disc stars in their more successful models are born cold and heated with time , which they attribute to heating by spirals and overdensities and possibly the coupling between transient spirals and weak bending waves @xcite .",
    "note that gmcs are not resolved in these simulations .",
    "for many years it was assumed that the chemodynamical evolution of any annulus of the galactic disc could be modelled in isolation of other annuli .",
    "now there is clear evidence that radial migration of stars within discs is an important process @xcite , with the consequence that the production of a hot population in one annulus , for example through the action of a bar , can subsequently endow a distant annulus with a hot population that could not have been locally heated . on account of radial migration , it is essential to understand the origin of the avr _ globally _ , that is by tracking the evolution of the disc at all radii . in general",
    "we expect the mean birth radius of a coeval cohort of snhd stars will decrease with increasing age , and on account of the radial gradient in velocity dispersion the decrease in birth radius will be reflected in the avr @xcite .",
    "in this paper we use the simulations presented in ( * ? ? ? * hereafter abs16 ) to study the formation of the avr . unlike the previously cited studies , these simulations include simultaneously all the following important aspects : growing discs with multiple coeval populations , gmcs , recurring spiral structure with evolving properties , a bar , an evolving gmc - to - stellar mass fraction , radial migration and sufficiently cold young stars .",
    "abs16 showed that although the vertical profiles of their models do not show a thick disc like that of the mw , some models do provide quite good fits to the avr of the snhd .",
    "hence they concluded that the thick disc requires additional sources of heat , but the thin disc can be explained by combined gmc and spiral heating .",
    "they showed that the efficiency of gmc heating declines over time because the fraction of the disc s mass contained in gmcs falls steadily as a consequence of a declining star - formation rate ( sfr ) and a growing disc mass .",
    "their simulations are thus a promising tool to study what shapes the avr in thin galactic discs .",
    "two major conclusions will emerge from our study : ( i ) biased ages and age uncertainties cause measured avrs to deviate significantly from the true avrs ; ( ii ) it is vital to distinguish between an avr @xmath23 , which gives velocity dispersion as a function of age for stars that are now co - located , and a _ heating history _",
    "@xmath24 , which gives the velocity dispersion as a function of time for a cohort of currently co - located stars that were born at a given time @xmath25 .",
    "whereas the avr @xmath23 for @xmath26 quantifies the current kinematics of stars born contemporaneously with the sun , the heating history @xmath24 for @xmath27 quantifies the kinematics of stars @xmath28 after they were born , which would be @xmath29 ago in the case of @xmath30 old stars in the disc .",
    "if stars were born into a statistically stationary environment providing heating processes which are constant in time , the cohort born @xmath30 ago would @xmath29 ago have been in the same dynamical state that the sun s cohort is in now .",
    "that is , given a stationary environment the avr would be the same function of @xmath31 that the heating history is of @xmath32 . if a galaxy undergoes a major merger , stars born before and after the merger will undergo different heating histories @xmath24 .",
    "here we argue , that even in the absence of mergers or declining birth dispersions , the thin discs of galaxies change beyond recognition over cosmological timescales , so the environment is very far from stationary , and the heating experienced by stars born @xmath30 ago during the first gyr of their lives was very different from the environment experienced by recently born stars during the first gyr of their lives .",
    "consequently heating histories are described by entirely different functions from the avr .",
    "nevertheless we will find that both avrs and heating histories can be well approximated by the modified power law @xmath33 used by ab09 , with @xmath34 or @xmath35 . to differentiate between parameters derived from avrs and heating histories",
    ", we will mark the latter with a tilde , i.e. @xmath36 , @xmath37 etc .",
    "we will find that the indices @xmath6 and @xmath36 of these power laws are often dissimilar .",
    "moreover , we find that in the case of a heating history the value of @xmath37 can evolve strongly with the time @xmath25 of the cohort s birth , whereas in most models @xmath36 evolves only mildly .",
    "our paper is organised as follows : in section [ sec : simulations ] we briefly describe the simulations . in section [ sec : biases ] we examine the effects of observational age errors and biases on the avr . in section [ sec : avr ] we describe the model avrs and compare them to local data .",
    "topics discussed include the uncertainties of the comparisons arising from azimuthal variations in the model avrs ( sections [ sec : azimuth ] and [ sec : specifics ] ) , and the diagnostic content of the axis ratios of velocity ellipsoids ( section [ sec : arat ] ) , and power - law fits to avrs ( section [ sec : heatindex ] ) . in section [ sec : heathistory ] we consider the heating histories for different populations of coeval model stars and show how these relate to avrs . in section",

    "the small upturn in the number densities at @xmath107 can be mostly ascribed to a pile - up of maximum likelihood values from main - sequence stars with temperature and/or metallicity over - estimates , and hence underestimated maximum likelihood ages .",
    "consistently , there is little evolution in gcs velocity dispersions for ages below @xmath108 , stalling at values typical for @xmath109 old stars and far above the values derived by ab09 for their bluest stars .",

    "models such as y4f@xmath86- and e2 with bars that nearly reach @xmath138 , show larger spreads , even at young ages , because bars have strong effects on stellar orbits and significant differences in orbit populations occur in regions positioned differently with respect to the bar .",

    "green horizontal lines at low ages indicate the lowest values found for each of the three quantities for blue _ hipparcos _ stars by ab09 to give an indication of the uncertainties at low ages .",

    "abs16 showed that models that start from ic f , which has a low - density dark halo , produce thicker discs , which are , however , too hot .",
    "in particular model f2 has a vertical profile that is significantly thicker than those of our standard models , run from initial condition y , and is slightly double - exponential , but still significantly thinner than that of the mw .",
    "when the azimuthal variation in its avrs is taken into account , model f2 becomes marginally acceptable because at the right end of the lower row of panels in fig .",
    "[ azi ] , the lowest grey curve for @xmath131 is consistent with the observations .",

    "these models have standard dark halos and total baryonic masses @xmath143 .",
    "model y1 is slightly too cold radially for old stars , and slightly too cold vertically for stars of intermediate age . the more compact model y2 has a radial avr that fits observations better because it has higher surface densities and thus stronger non - axisymmetric structures . in model",
    "y1s2 the sf timescale is longer so the disc grows more slowly .",
    "the consequence is old populations that are too cold radially and vertically because the total mass and the gmc mass fraction at early times are both low .",
    "model y1f@xmath20 , which uses a fixed cutoff and has a higher value for the input velocity dispersion @xmath59 , shows a mildly better fit to the data than y1 , as does model yg1 , which has an isothermal gas component .",
    "the best fits by a y model are provided by model y1@xmath86- , which has a lower sf efficiency and thus a higher total gmc mass at all times .",
    "whereas the y models start from a small , compact and thin disc , model e2 starts from a more extended and more massive thick disc . if we consider that we should not trust any points at @xmath144 and that the blue lines in fig .",
    "[ azi ] are more relevant than the red lines , e2 also provides acceptable fits to both @xmath131 and @xmath130 . at old ages",
    "its avr @xmath130 differs from that of model y2 on account of the thick ic , and at young ages it differs on account of its extended and buckling bar .",

    "the ( pink ) observational values show substantial scatter around @xmath145 , with lower values at young ages and higher values at old ages .",
    "although the @xcite values lie in @xmath146 , ab09 found values as low as 0.33 for the bluest stars in the _ hipparcos _ catalogue , which , as we noted above , are excluded from the gcs sample , but may be biased by moving groups . at old ages , @xmath147 , @xmath148 appears rather constant .",

    "the values of @xmath258 and @xmath259 scatter much less than do the values of @xmath246 , which cover the range @xmath260 , presumably because this parameter has the smallest influence on the fits .",
    "although we have seen that the avrs of models f2 and y2 yield significantly different values of @xmath3 , the heating histories of these two models yield almost identical values of @xmath5 . as was discussed in section [ sec : heatindex ] , model f2 has a large bar early on and thus at early times the cutoff radius and the early surface density of gmcs at @xmath261 are both larger than in y2 .",
    "consequently , the efficiency of gmc heating and thus @xmath262 decline more strongly in f2 , causing the fit to the avr @xmath130 to yield a larger value of @xmath3 .",
    "direct vertical heating by the bar likely plays a role for this model as well , but disentangling the effects is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "model a2@xmath31 has a thicker disc in its ics than model y2 and an input velocity dispersion @xmath59 that decreases with time ( eq .  [ sigmazerot ] ) , so stars at early times are born significantly hotter than stars at late times , which are born as cold as those in model y2 .",
    "the declining input dispersions are nicely visible in @xmath227 .",
    "as noted in abs16 , vertical dispersions for younger stars are lower than input dispersions @xmath59 as all stars are added at @xmath22 and thus lose kinetic energy when moving away from the midplane .",
    "interestingly , this decline in @xmath227 is also reflected in a milder decline in @xmath37 and smaller values of @xmath36 in both vertical and radial directions for stars born at early times .",
    "small values of @xmath36 are likely connected to an earlier saturation of heating due to higher initial dispersions . at late times",
    "we find only mild differences between the heating indices of model a2@xmath31 and model y2 .",
    "model e2 has an even thicker and more extended disc in its ic than model a2@xmath31 , and the same small , constant input dispersion @xmath59 as model y2 . at early times",
    "the thick , extended disc suppresses spiral and bar formation below the level seen in the thin , compact disc in the ic of model y2 . consequently , early on radial heating is less powerful in model e2 , with the consequence that the oldest populations heat more slowly in model e2 and thus have large @xmath263 as the saturation phase happens later ( fourth panel in second row ) . a long ( @xmath264 ) , strong and buckled bar forms in e2 after @xmath197 .",
    "this bar significantly influences the heating of the populations which end up at @xmath138 . for populations born after bar formation",
    ", @xmath4 decreases strongly as a strong bar leads to a very fast increase in @xmath113 for young stars and thus a quicker saturation and a low value of @xmath4 . at the same time @xmath245 decreases , implying that populations born at late times are expected to attain lower velocity dispersions after @xmath30 .",
    "this is likely driven by the lower @xmath4 , as for these stars there is no information available at @xmath265 and thus the fits likely over - predict the saturation effect and thus under - predict the continuous in - plane heating . by adding an additional vertical heating mechanism for young stars , bar buckling increases @xmath5 and @xmath262 .",
    "then the fits very likely over - predict the vertical dispersion these stars would attain after @xmath30 .",
    "a different situation is found in the leftmost panel of the second row for model y4f@xmath86- . in this model , which has a very compact feeding history , a fixed cutoff and a high gmc mass fraction , strong and extended @xmath196 and @xmath177 modes form around @xmath197 .",
    "these events lead to deviations from simple @xmath266 avrs and heating histories as was shown in abs16 and in fig .",
    "[ heatrad ] .",
    "consequently the quality of fits of equation to the heating histories is worse than for other models and there are strong variations in the radial heating parameters . @xmath4",
    "varies between 0 and 1 for stars born after @xmath126 , @xmath267 is generally high at @xmath268 due to the strong non - axisymmetries and also scatters strongly for stars born after @xmath126 , and @xmath246 varies systematically between 0 and @xmath269 .",
    "the decrease in @xmath262 is strong , which explains the high avr value of @xmath3 .",
    "finally , we also show one model without gmcs , model yn1 ( second panel second row ) .",
    "both the radial and vertical heating histories have @xmath36 values that differ sharply from those of the standard y models as the heating curves are shaped only by non - axisymmetric structure .",
    "@xmath4 decreases from 0.4 to 0.15 with increasing time of birth , whereas @xmath5 is rather high , with typical values @xmath270 and a tendency to increase with @xmath25 . as in model e2 , the decrease in @xmath4 and the decrease in @xmath267 for stars born at late times , is likely caused by a strong bar , which in yn1 forms early and extends to @xmath271 by the end of the simulation . on account of the change in the main source of vertical heat , the value of @xmath5 for model yn1 differs sharply from the values yielded by models with gmcs .",
    "in a galactic disc the random velocities of stars are increased by the fluctuating non - axisymmetric component of the gravitational field .",
    "gmcs and spiral arms are both major contributors to this component .    in a naive picture of the heating of the solar neighbourhood , stars diffuse through velocity space from the velocities of circular orbits under the influence of fluctuations that constitute a stationary random process @xcite .",
    "if the diffusion coefficient that governed this process were independent of @xmath272 , the velocity dispersion of a coeval cohort of stars would grow as @xmath273 .",
    "in reality the diffusion coefficient must be a declining function of @xmath274 because a given potential fluctuation deflects fast stars through smaller angles than slow stars ( typically @xmath275 ) . hence if the fluctuating component of the gravitational potential is statistically stationary , the exponent in the _ heating law _",
    "@xmath276 has to be less than @xmath277 : @xcite found @xmath232 for analytical models of gmc heating . in the case of spiral structure",
    "the concept of a deflection angle is problematic , but stars with significant random velocities and therefore eccentric orbits , encounter a given spiral wave at a variety of orbital phases , so the time - averaged impact of the wave on a fast star is small .",
    "that is , very general physical principles leave no doubt that in the presence of statistically stationary fluctuations , the exponent in any heating law is @xmath278 @xcite .",
    "the black and red asterisks in the first and forth rows of fig .",
    "[ betae ] plot the exponents of heating histories rather than heating laws : they relate to the variation with @xmath32 of @xmath113 and @xmath13 for a group of stars that are now at @xmath138 rather than the variation with @xmath32 of a group of stars that formed at @xmath138 . nonetheless , these two groups are similar , so it is interesting to see that in the standard y models @xmath4 tends to be constant at a value @xmath278 , consistent with fairly stationary fluctuations .",
    "in some y models @xmath5 is constant at a similar or slightly larger value than @xmath4 , and in other models it increases mildly with @xmath25 , remaining at @xmath279 for most coeval cohorts .",
    "spiral structure in discs with @xmath280 is maintained by swing amplification of noise @xcite .",
    "since the efficacy of swing amplification rises very sharply as toomre s @xmath281 drops towards unity , a cold ( @xmath282 ) stellar disc very rapidly heats until @xmath283 .",
    "hence from an early time , a galactic disc will have @xmath283 . as the disc grows in mass , its surface density @xmath284 rises and @xmath113 is driven upwards by spiral structure to keep @xmath225 approximately constant ( see fig . 9 in abs16 ) .",
    "hence , the time dependence of @xmath113 for stars of all ages at a given radius is essentially prescribed by the history of gas accretion . as a consequence , young stars which are born cold",
    "are heated efficiently by constantly excited spiral structure at all times .",
    "spiral structure heats within the plane but does not directly increase @xmath13 .",
    "gmcs , by contrast heat the disc vertically as well as horizontally .",
    "consequently , the ratio @xmath7 is a measure of the relative importance of gmcs and spirals as heating agents .",
    "[ betae ] reveals that for almost all heating histories , @xmath239 .",
    "consequently , the velocity ellipsoids of groups of coeval stars tend to become rounder over time .",
    "the natural explanation is that after in - plane heating , driven by spiral structure , has essentially saturated , gmcs continue to increase @xmath13 by deflecting stars from eccentric near - planar orbits to less eccentric and more highly inclined orbits .",
    "one may plausibly argue , as abs16 did , that the mass of gas in all gmcs is proportional to the sfr , since over the lifetime of a gmc a fraction @xmath86 of the gmc s mass is converted to stars .",
    "hence , the rate at which gmcs heat the disc declines with the sfr . moreover , early on the disc has a low mass , so each gmc represents a larger fraction of the total disc mass .",
    "since the rate at which an individual gmc heats scales with its mass relative to the mass of the galaxy interior to its orbit , each gmc is individually a more effective heating agent early in the life of the disc .",
    "hence over time the heating power of the ensemble of gmcs declines faster than the sfr .",
    "large - scale spiral structure , by contrast , is associated with the self - gravity of the stellar disc , which grows steadily over time from a small initial value .",
    "that is , over the life of the disc , the impact of spiral structure has increased relative to that of gmcs .",
    "if the fluctuations that heat the disc were a stationary random process and the disc were homogeneous , heating histories would be independent of @xmath285 and have the same functional form as the avr .",
    "we have seen that in the models heating histories do depend on @xmath25 and are very different from the avr .",
    "while the dependence of heating histories on @xmath25 and their deviation from the avr could be entirely attributed to the non - stationary nature of the fluctuations , a contributing factor is undoubtedly radial migration @xcite , which adds significant complexity to the problem by mixing stars that were born at small and large radii .",
    "motivated by the desire to understand data for the snhd , we have studied samples of stars that are currently at @xmath286 . in a future paper",
    "we will consider groups of stars with a common birth radius .",
    "in this paper , we have used a series of @xmath0-body simulations of growing disc galaxies ( abs16 ) to study ( i ) age - velocity - dispersion relations ( avrs ) and ( ii ) the heating histories of the coeval cohorts of stars which make up the avrs .",
    "as these models feature heavy gmc particles , secular heating is dominated by a combination of scattering of stars off gmcs and non - axisymmetric disc structures .    to be able to compare these simulations to observational data from the snhd , we analysed the impact on the avr of biases and errors in measured stellar ages .",
    "stars with ages @xmath287 are very much over - represented in the gcs data ( fig .",
    "[ gcs ] ) .",
    "scattering of such stars to young ages artificially boosts @xmath23 at the youngest ages , and depresses @xmath23 at the oldest ages .",
    "when a power law in @xmath31 is fitted to the measured avr , lower values of the exponent @xmath6 are recovered than would be in the absence of errors ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the reduction in @xmath6 is particularly marked in the case of @xmath13 ( fig .",
    "[ heatfits ] ) .    on account of spiral structure and bars ,",
    "avrs vary with azimuth as well as radius .",
    "[ azi ] quantifies the extent of this azimuthal variation , which must be borne in mind when considering whether a given model is consistent with data for the snhd , which are measured at one particular azimuth . after taking azimuthal variation into account",
    ", we concluded that the gcs data are consistent with some models in abs16 that have the expected disc mass ( @xmath160 ) and the cosmologically motivated dark halo ( @xmath288 , @xmath289 ) .",
    "models with a significantly different disc mass or a less concentrated dark halo are inconsistent with data for the snhd .",
    "the data also favour the model that starts with a massive , extended thick disc over models in which ( a rather inadequate ) thick disc forms as a consequence of powerful non - axisymmetries developing in the thin disc . as we do not self - consistently form appropriate thick discs and as we lack heating by dark matter substructure , which may contribute a minor part of the observed disc heating , we are not able to put tight constraints on our model parameters",
    ".    avrs vary with radius . at locations currently inside the bar ,",
    "the avr s index @xmath2 is generally very small , @xmath290 , as there are no circular orbits and young stars thus acquire high @xmath113 rapidly . at the end of the bar ,",
    "@xmath2 rises abruptly and is thereafter constant or slowly rising with @xmath60 ( fig .",
    "[ heatrad ] ) .",
    "by contrast , @xmath3 sometimes increases and sometimes decreases at the end of the bar .",
    "a buckling bar can lead to exceptionally high @xmath13 for young stars in the bar regions .",
    "the heating history , @xmath24 , of stars now in the snhd that were born at time @xmath25 can also be fitted by the power - law .",
    "we mark the corresponding parameters with a tilde . for standard models ,",
    "the heating history depends on @xmath25 more strongly in the case of @xmath13 than @xmath113 .",
    "smaller values of the exponent @xmath36 are required to fit heating histories than avrs .",
    "in fact , values of @xmath4 are consistent with the predictions of dynamics in the case that the fluctuating gravitational potential is a stationary random process .",
    "the values of @xmath5 are generally somewhat larger than is consistent with a stationary random process , but in agreement with numerical simulations of stationary gmc heating @xcite .",
    "the avr reflects the history of star and bar formation .",
    "the past sfr strongly affects the avr for two reasons : the time integral of the sfr determines the mass of the disc , and thus the fraction of the gravitational force on a star that derives from the disc rather than the dark halo . at early times",
    "this fraction is small , so spiral arm formation is already suppressed by a low value of @xmath113 . as the mass of the disc increases , spiral structure increases @xmath113 to keep toomre s @xmath225 nearly constant .",
    "if the sfr is rapidly declining , the rate at which @xmath113 increases will decline rapidly , and a relatively small value of @xmath4 will be required to fit the heating histories of the oldest stellar groups .    in contrast , the vertical heating is dominated by gmcs . by analysing histories of stars that end up at @xmath138 , we showed that the heating histories of older stars reach higher @xmath13 after @xmath30 ( @xmath37 ) than those of younger stars .",
    "the corresponding @xmath5 values only vary mildly with @xmath25 .",
    "this decline in heating efficiency is connected to the declining influence of gmcs , the total mass of which declines due to a declining sfr and the mass fraction of which declines due to a growing stellar disc . when coeval cohorts , whose @xmath37 values decline with @xmath25 , are superposed to form an avr , a value of @xmath3 in excess of @xmath277 is needed to fit the curve .    by combining all these results we have been able to clarify long standing discrepancies between the observed avr and theoretical predictions for combined spiral and gmc heating .",
    "some of our models correctly reproduce the general shape of both @xmath131 _ and _ @xmath130 as observed in the snhd and thus also the ratio of the two components .",
    "the key ingredient is that each coeval cohort of stars that contributes to the avr has undergone a different heating history and the avr is not produced by a single stationary heating law .",
    "we conclude that combined gmc and spiral / bar heating has likely shaped the mw thin disc avr .",
