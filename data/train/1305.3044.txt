    "<S> we place observational constraints on slow - variation single - field inflationary models by carrying out the cosmological monte carlo simulation with the recent data of planck combined with the wmap large - angle polarization , baryon acoustic oscillations , and act / spt temperature data . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis covers a wide variety of models with second - order equations of motion including potential - driven slow - roll inflation , non - minimally coupled models , running kinetic couplings , brans - dicke theories , potential - driven galileon inflation , field - derivative couplings to the einstein tensor , and k - inflation . in the presence of running kinetic exponential couplings , covariant galileon terms , and field - derivative couplings , the tensor - to - scalar ratio of the self - coupling potential </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 gets smaller relative to that in standard slow - roll inflation , but the models lie outside the @xmath1 observational contour . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that k - inflation models can be tightly constrained by adding the bounds from the scalar non - gaussianities . the small - field inflationary models with asymptotic flat einstein - frame potentials in the regime </S>",
    "<S> @xmath2 generally fit the data very well . </S>",
    "<S> these include the models such as khler - moduli inflation , non - minimally coupled higgs inflation , and inflation in brans - dicke theories in the presence of the potential @xmath3 with the brans - dicke parameter @xmath4 ( which covers the starobinsky s model @xmath5 as a special case ) . </S>"
