    "there is a strong consensus that spiral galaxies are embedded in massive , non - luminous halos , the structure and scaling properties of which have been intensively investigated ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "studies of galaxy kinematics and of the density and temperature distributions of hot intergalactic gas in galaxy groups ( @xcite ) and clusters ( e.g. , @xcite ) have demonstrated the dominance of dark matter on larger scales . in the context of existing theories of the formation of galaxies and large scale structure , it is therefore natural to expect non - luminous material within elliptical galaxies as well .",
    "however , until very recently , the evidence for dark matter in ellipticals has been less forthcoming and more controversial",
    ".    dark matter in ellipticals has been elusive largely due to the lack of internal dynamical indicators at optical and radio wavelengths that are as ubiquitous , spatially extensive , and unambiguous as hi rotation curves in spirals .",
    "although mergers have endowed some early - type galaxies ( many classified as s0 ) with neutral ( e.g. , @xcite ) or ionized ( @xcite ) gas disks , these are rare and may not be representative of the population of ellipticals as a whole .",
    "studies of stellar kinematics have , until recently , been inadequate in quality and extent to significantly constrain the large scale mass distribution in ellipticals in light of the complicating effects of projection and anisotropic velocity distributions .",
    "most , if not all , giant elliptical galaxies contain extended distributions of hot x - ray emitting gas that provide a means for probing the large scale dark matter distribution  a means potentially as powerful as rotation curves in spiral galaxies . since these hot gaseous halos should be close to hydrostatic equilibrium ( @xcite ) , measurements of the density and temperature distributions from x - ray imaging and spectroscopy yield constraints on the mass distribution on the scale and with the accuracy and spatial resolution of x - ray temperature profiles .",
    "observations of elliptical galaxies by the _ einstein observatory _ ipc were presented as strong evidence for the presence of extensive dark halos in early - type galaxies ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) ; however , the temperature profiles were of sufficiently poor quality to foster a continuing skepticism ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "progress on a number of fronts has been rapid during recent years . in the optical , improvements in detector capabilities , data analysis , and modeling",
    "have now provided robust stellar dynamical constraints on the mass distribution out beyond the optical half - light radius @xmath5 for several ellipticals ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , while gravitational lensing observations are providing the first evidence for dark matter in intermediate redshift galaxies ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "x - ray observations using the _ rosat _ and _ asca _ satellites have improved the accuracy , spatial resolution , and extent of derived hot gas density and temperature profiles . of particular interest",
    "is the recent study of _ asca _ observations of @xmath15 early - type galaxies by matsushita ( 1997 ) that shows that gas temperature profiles are relatively flat out as far as can be reliably measured ( 5@xmath16 , depending on the intrinsic luminosity and galaxy distance ) . the existence of isothermal 0.51 kev gaseous halos extending , in some cases , to well beyond 10@xmath5 is strong evidence for the presence of extended dark matter in elliptical galaxies .",
    "the case for dark matter halos in a number of elliptical galaxies is now overwhelming , and the following pattern seems to be emerging from the latest results on individual galaxies : dark matter comprises a significant but not dominant fraction of the total mass within @xmath5 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; but , see @xcite for an exceptional case : ngc 4636 ) ; dark matter becomes increasingly dominant at large radii : @xmath17m@xmath18 kpc@xmath19 to within a factor of two for @xmath20 kpc ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , corresponding to mass - to - light ratios @xmath21m@xmath13l@xmath22 measured at ( or extrapolated to ) @xmath23 kpc ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "while there is now little doubt that some elliptical galaxies do contain dark matter , a number of broader issues remain to be addressed . among the most important with respect to our understanding of galaxy formation is whether dark matter in ellipticals is ubiquitous , and how the relative scaling of dark and luminous matter varies  both within galaxies as a function of radius , and between galaxies with different optical properties . in this paper",
    "we use the recently derived collection of x - ray temperatures in a complete , optically selected sample from davis & white ( 1996 ; hereafter dw ) to constrain the _ average _ properties of dark halos in the _ population _ of @xmath2 elliptical galaxies .",
    "dw analyzed x - ray spectra from 42 of the 43 optically brightest elliptical galaxies , using _",
    "pspc data if available and _ einstein _ ipc data otherwise ( _ i.e. _ for four galaxies ) .",
    "see dw and white & davis ( 1998 ) for details about the sample and data analysis . for the purposes of this work , we use only the mean relationship between x - ray temperatures , @xmath24 , and central projected optical velocity dispersions , @xmath25 ( hereafter , the `` @xmath0@xmath1 relation '' )  @xmath26  or equivalent x - ray / optical correlations .",
    "more precisely , we consider the variation of the observable @xmath9 with optical luminosity @xmath27 ( figure 1 ) , where @xmath28 and @xmath29 is the mean mass per particle . if dark matter dominates the gravitational potential on large scales , then @xmath24 is essentially a measure of the dark matter content within the extraction radii used by dw ( @xmath8 , where @xmath5 is the optical effective radius ) .",
    "since the observed scaling relations ( _ i.e. _ the fundamental plane ) for elliptical galaxies provide a link between @xmath25 and the global luminosity , @xmath9 is an excellent diagnostic of the dark - to - luminous matter ratio within the optical radius .",
    "temperature profiles can provide additional dark matter constraints , but are measurable for only the x - ray brightest galaxies in the sample .",
    "likewise , extended stellar velocity dispersion profiles are useful , but data of sufficient detail to be unambiguously interpreted are not generally available . on the other hand ,",
    "central velocity dispersions have been accurately measured for the entire sample ; central velocity dispersions are known to correlate with other optical properties and are less likely to suffer from the uncertainties caused by anisotropic stellar orbits .",
    "our goal in this paper is to make general inferences about the presence of dark matter halos and their mean systematic variation with optical luminosity . toward that end ,",
    "we utilize a set of physically and observationally well - motivated mass models and scaling relations in order to reproduce the @xmath0@xmath1 relation .",
    "although we address the scatter in the @xmath0@xmath1 relation , a detailed examination of individual galaxies is beyond the scope of this paper and is deferred to future investigation .",
    "our results can be considered in three stages .",
    "first , we demonstrate how the observed range of @xmath9 _ necessarily _ requires the existence of dark halos in elliptical galaxies .",
    "second , we derive conservative lower limits on the dark matter scale length and dark - to - luminous mass fraction , and discuss how the dark matter content must scale with optical luminosity so as to reproduce the observed @xmath0@xmath1 relation .",
    "finally , we discuss possible implications of our results for cosmology and galaxy formation , by embedding our models within particular scenarios for large scale structure formation .",
    "as stated above , we use the observable @xmath9 , defined in equation ( 1 ) , to constrain the dark matter distribution in elliptical galaxies .",
    "this parameter is the ratio of suitable averages ( to be defined below ) of the square of the stellar velocity dispersion and the gas temperature .",
    "therefore , we must derive the expected distributions of stellar velocity dispersions @xmath1 and gas temperatures @xmath0 , given specified total gravitational mass distributions .",
    "recently published _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) observations of the centers of elliptical galaxies show that their surface brightness profiles can generally be characterized by the function @xmath30^{(c - b)/a},\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the projected radius and @xmath32 is a break radius such that @xmath33 for @xmath34 and @xmath35 for @xmath36 , while @xmath37 characterizes the sharpness of the break ( @xcite ) . in order to accurately calculate the central stellar velocity dispersion ,",
    "this observed departure from distributions with `` analytic cores '' must be accounted for . in the appendix",
    "we demonstrate that , for @xmath38 and @xmath39 , equation ( 2 ) provides a good approximation to the projection of a space density profile @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) for @xmath42 and @xmath43 for @xmath44 . to derive the luminosity density distribution @xmath45 , we numerically deproject the surface brightness profile : @xmath46 where @xmath47 , and the change of variables @xmath48 has been made .",
    "the dw sample is magnitude - limited , and we are primarily interested in the most luminous ellipticals , since they have the most accurate x - ray temperatures ( see  3.3 ) .",
    "we adopt the typical values for @xmath49 galaxies ( adopting @xmath50 km s@xmath19 mpc@xmath19 ) of @xmath38 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 ( @xcite ) .",
    "for the nine galaxies in common with dw ( excluding the highly flattened ngc 4697 ) , the mean surface brightness parameters and variances from faber et al .",
    "( 1997 ) are as follows : @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 .",
    "the resulting stellar density profile diverges slightly faster than @xmath56 for @xmath42 .",
    "the asymptotic surface brightness slope @xmath57 is flatter than in conventional surface brightness parameterizations and the integrated luminosity @xmath58 does not converge .",
    "therefore , we truncate the optically luminous distribution at radius @xmath59 , determined so that @xmath60 consequently @xmath61 .    as an alternative stellar model",
    ", we consider the density profile from hernquist ( 1990 ) , @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the total luminosity and @xmath64 ( as adopted here ) provides the best match to a de vaucouleurs ( dev ) model with effective radius @xmath5 ( @xcite ) .",
    "an advantage of this model is that the density and mass profiles are analytic .",
    "we shall subsequently refer to the stellar distribution of equation ( 3 ) as the `` hst '' model , and that of equation ( 5 ) as the `` hernquist '' model .",
    "a comparison of the luminosity density ( in units of the average density , @xmath65 ) as a function of normalized radius ( @xmath66 ) in these models with the corresponding dev model is shown in figure 2 , where @xmath67 .",
    "all three models produce similar slopes at very small @xmath68 ; however , dev and hernquist models fail to reproduce the flattening at @xmath69 observed by _",
    "hst_. on the other hand , while @xmath70% of the total luminosity is contained within @xmath71 in all three models , the hst model concentrates the entire remaining @xmath72% of the mass between @xmath73 and @xmath8 as opposed to spreading it out from @xmath73 to @xmath74 .",
    "in order to accurately characterize the observed central stellar properties as required by the definition of @xmath9 without introducing additional parameters ( _ i.e. _ an additional break radius and a distinct asymptotic form for the density profile ) , such a redistribution of the stellar light is necessary .",
    "if the light profile does indeed steepen outside of the _ hst _ field - of - view , then the only effect on our results for the hst model is that , by overestimating the stellar mass at large radii , we would underestimate the dark halo mass required to reproduce any observed value of @xmath9 .",
    "the stellar velocity dispersion is derived by solving the jeans equation in the form @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the stellar density distribution obtained from multiplying the luminosity density ( see equations 3 and 5 , above ) by a constant stellar mass - to - light ratio ; @xmath77 is the total mass within radius @xmath68 ( the dark matter component of which is described in the next section ) ; @xmath78 is the velocity dispersion anisotropy parameter ( @xmath79 ) ; and @xmath80 ( @xmath81 ) is the radial ( tangential ) component of the velocity dispersion . we make the reasonable assumption that the velocity dispersion becomes isotropic at small @xmath68 but radial at large @xmath68 ( @xcite ) , and adopt the functional form @xmath82 where the transitional scale radius @xmath83 is a free parameter of our models .      the dark matter mass distribution is assumed to follow the `` universal '' density profile ( @xcite ) , @xmath84 that , when integrated , yields @xmath85.\\ ] ]    it is not clear how appropriate equations ( 8) and ( 9 ) are for elliptical galaxy dark halos . on one hand",
    ", there is evidence for cores in spiral galaxy dark matter distributions ( e.g. , @xcite ) ; on the other , dissipational collapse of the baryonic component in ellipticals can increase the dark matter concentration .",
    "moreover , models with cores can not generally be consistently coupled with stellar mass distributions as cuspy as those often observed in elliptical galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "we have verified the existence of self - consistent two - component mass models with dark matter following equation ( 8) and hernquist stellar models ( equation 7 ) , in the parameter range of interest , according to the criterion of ciotti and pelligrini ( 1992 ) .    from the virial theorem it follows that the integrated mass can be robustly estimated from the mean temperature .",
    "constraints on the dark matter concentration can also be placed from consideration of the @xmath0@xmath1 relation ; however , any inferences about dark matter at small or large radii are contingent on the corresponding assumed asymptotic dark matter density slopes .",
    "our choice of equation ( 8) for the dark matter distribution does allow us to connect our results with predictions of dark halo structure from numerical structure formation simulations .",
    "however , the true shape of the dark matter spatial distribution can only be constrained from temperature and stellar velocity dispersion _",
    "profiles _ of sufficient extent and resolution .",
    "the hot , x - ray emitting gas is assumed to be in hydrostatic equilibrium so that @xmath86 the mass in hot gas is not significant compared to the stellar mass , so its contribution to the gravitational potential is neglected . since we are interested in the average properties of the dw sample , and because spatial analysis is not available for most of the sample , we assume that @xmath87 ; this has been found to be a good approximation for x - ray bright galaxies , and is expected if heating is balanced by cooling locally ( @xcite ) .",
    "both assumptions , hydrostatic equilibrium and @xmath87 , are more likely to break down for galaxies with low x - ray - to - optical luminosity ratios , where a partial or transient outflow might obtain ; however , the @xmath0@xmath1 relation for these relatively x - ray faint systems does not differ , within the statistics of the sample , from that of the sample as a whole .",
    "a significant unifying simplification for the hst stellar models follows from the observations that the ratios of core mass to total stellar mass ( @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is @xmath90 [ equation 4 ] multiplied by the stellar mass - to - light ratio ) , and break radius @xmath32 to @xmath5 ( the `` true '' @xmath5 as observed , not the half - light radius in our models ) are approximately constant : @xmath91 and @xmath92 ( @xcite ) .",
    "our adoption of these scaling relations , along with the empirical relation @xmath93 , insures that our model galaxies are consistent with the fundamental plane ( fp ) as long as the core is baryon - dominated , since it follows that @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the central velocity dispersion .. ] in order to provide us with a one - parameter family of models ( the quality and quantity of the x - ray data is insufficient to attempt to derive a `` @xmath0@xmath1@xmath5 '' or equivalent fp - like relation ) , we take a `` faber - jackson cut '' through the fp such that @xmath96 , normalized so that @xmath97 kpc ( and @xmath98 km s@xmath19 ) at @xmath99 for @xmath50 km s@xmath19 mpc@xmath19 .",
    "the root - mean - square deviation of galaxies in the dw sample from this projection of the fp is only 34 km s@xmath19 ( 13.5% of the mean ) .",
    "the hernquist models ( equation 5 ) likewise adhere to the fp , since we universally adopt @xmath64 .",
    "equations ( 6 ) and ( 10 ) are solved in dimensionless form .",
    "there are two fundamental ( luminosity - dependent ) dimensional quantities that we denote as @xmath100 ( chosen to be @xmath32 for the hst model or @xmath101 for the hernquist model ) and @xmath102 ( @xmath89 for the hst model or total stellar mass @xmath103 for the hernquist model ) .",
    "thus , adopting the above scaling relations , the length- , mass- , density- , velocity- , and temperature - scaling relations are as follows : @xmath104 @xmath105 @xmath106 @xmath107 and @xmath108 here @xmath109 is the hubble constant in units of 80 km s@xmath19 mpc@xmath19 , @xmath110 with @xmath111l@xmath14 , and @xmath112 is defined such that the stellar mass - to - light ratio @xmath113m@xmath13l@xmath14 for @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "@xmath116 corresponds to @xmath99 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath117 .",
    "the dark matter mass distribution is scaled accordingly , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the ratio of dark to stellar mass at the hst stellar model cutoff radius , i.e. @xmath120 and @xmath121 is the dimensionless dark matter scale length . in the above , @xmath122 , @xmath123 , and the function @xmath124",
    "is defined in equation ( 9 ) .    to determine the average values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , the hydrostatic and jeans equations",
    "are integrated inward from a zero - pressure boundary at @xmath125 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "although the stellar mass has a cutoff ( @xmath59 ) for the hst model , the gas and dark matter halos are likely to extend beyond this and are not truncated in the models .",
    "this results in a pressure contribution to the gas virial temperature within @xmath59 that leads to lower values of @xmath9 for a given @xmath119 , and is therefore conservative in the sense of minimizing the required amount of dark matter .",
    "the average quantities that constitute the observable @xmath9 are calculated as follows : we define @xmath25 as the average projected stellar velocity dispersion within a circular aperture of size @xmath32 , and @xmath24 as the emission - weighted projected gas temperature within @xmath59 ( the same aperture over which the temperature is measured in dw , corresponding to the radius enclosing @xmath126% of the optical light ) .",
    "the value of @xmath9 is robust to the precise choice of these radii since @xmath127 .",
    "the aperture - averaged , projected velocity dispersion for all central radii @xmath128 ( @xmath129 ) is within 10% of its value at @xmath32 for the hst ( hernquist ) model , assuming isotropic orbits and that the central potential is dominated by the stellar component . by averaging over constant multiples of the fundamental stellar scale length ( @xmath100 )",
    ", we assure that our computed values of @xmath9 depend only on the _ relative _ ( to stellar ) dimensionless dark matter and velocity dispersion anisotropy parameters .",
    "these parameters are the following : the ratio of dark to luminous matter scale length , @xmath121 ; the mass ratio @xmath130 within @xmath59 , @xmath119 ; and the dimensionless anisotropy scale length , @xmath131 .",
    "the only additional model parameters are the stellar distribution slopes .",

    "the redistribution of the stellar mass at large radii in the hst model is irrelevant .      in the absence of dark matter ,",
    "the only free parameter in our models is the anisotropy length scale @xmath83 ; recall that this is defined such that orbits become isotropic for @xmath136 and radial for @xmath137 . therefore ,",
    "if stars dominate the gravitational potential within @xmath59 , and if the shape of the velocity ellipsoid does not vary systematically with @xmath27 , then @xmath9 should be independent of @xmath27 and @xmath25 ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath138 ) , contrary to the observed @xmath0@xmath1 relation ( dw ) .",
    "moreover , as we now show , the typical observed value of @xmath139 can not be reproduced in the absence of dark matter .",
    "the solid and dotted curves in figure 3 show the variation of @xmath9 with the dimensionless anisotropy scale length @xmath140 for , respectively , the hst and hernquist stellar models without dark matter .",
    "evidently , @xmath9 falls with increasing @xmath83 , but is essentially constant for @xmath141@xmath142 ( @xmath143@xmath144 ) , since @xmath25 is an average over a much smaller radius .",
    "the asymptotic values of @xmath9 are @xmath145 and @xmath146 for the the hst and hernquist stellar models , respectively .",
    "the lower value for the hernquist model is the result of a temperature maximum at several @xmath32 that substantially contributes to the emission - averaged temperature because of the high stellar ( and , by assumption , gas ) density there . as dark matter",

    "a comparison with the observed values of @xmath9 , as shown in figures 8a  c , confirms that the constant baryon fraction cdm scenario provides the poorest match to the observations , on average , and further illustrates the magnitude of variations about the mean correlation .",
    "further investigation into these variations will be pursued in a future work that examines the individual galaxies in detail .    both of these alternative scenarios have drawbacks .",
    "mass loss induced by supernovae - driven galactic winds during the star - forming epoch of elliptical galaxies has been inferred from both the color - magnitude diagram and the enrichment of the intracluster medium ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "however the magnitude of this effect must be extreme ( _ i.e _ @xmath240 , in equation 22 , on the order of 1 or greater ) if it is to explain the increasing dominance of dark matter in less luminous galaxies required to explain the observed @xmath0@xmath1 relation . the mass loss implied by equation ( 22 ) with the required set of parameters , when integrated over the elliptical galaxy luminosity function ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , corresponds to @xmath250% of the original baryonic mass of @xmath2 galaxies .",
    "moreover , in such a scenario , all elliptical galaxies with @xmath251l@xmath14 would span a range in total mass of less than a factor of three ; the large range in mass loss could not , therefore , be due to less luminous galaxies lying within shallower potential wells . instead , one must presume that variations in the relative timing of star formation and the merging of pre - galactic fragments is responsible for the large range in mass loss , with galaxies with smaller present - day luminosities having lost the largest fraction of their original baryonic mass .",
    "light would be a very poor tracer of mass for elliptical galaxies , and the luminosity function would be a reflection of the rarity of elliptical galaxies sufficiently relaxed at the star formation epoch to prevent copious mass loss from galactic winds .",
    "it might therefore seem more appealing to resort to a concentration - mass relationship for dark halos ( equation 21 ) that is steeper than predicted in cdm simulations in such a way that optically less luminous galaxies are more dark matter dominated within @xmath59 , despite having the same total ( within @xmath197 ) baryon fraction .",
    "the basic requirement is that the dark matter scale length @xmath148 increase from @xmath252 at the low - luminosity end of the observed range , to @xmath253 at @xmath254l@xmath14 , to @xmath255 ( @xmath256 ) at the high luminosity range .",

    "a basic and general result of our calculations is that , in the absence of dark matter , @xmath300 ( see figure 3 ) . since @xmath139 is observed , a convincing case is made that dark matter is an extremely common , if not ubiquitous , constituent of elliptical galaxies . although x - ray ( and other ) observations have been used to infer the presence of dark matter in individual cases , we have shown that dark halos are generic to luminous , nearby elliptical galaxies .",
    "furthermore , the dark matter / stellar temperature ratios ( derived at the peak of their velocity dispersion distributions , assuming isotropic orbits ) are greater than one for models with @xmath297 .",

    "because we attempt to match only the single global observable @xmath9 , there is an allowed range in the details of the dark matter spatial distribution ; however , we have derived absolute limits on the dark matter parameters required to obtain any particular value of @xmath9 ( see figures 6a - b ) .",
    "the observations do not require that dark matter dominate the inner luminous regions of elliptical galaxies : more than half of the mass within @xmath5 is baryonic for models with @xmath303 if @xmath158 .",
    "the most natural explanation of the tendency for galaxies with lower stellar temperatures to have larger gas - to - stellar temperature ratios is that @xmath132_{r_{\\rm max}}$ ] decreases with @xmath27 in such a way that , on average , the total mass - to - light ratio inside @xmath59 is nearly independent of optical luminosity .",
    "this ratio , @xmath304m@xmath13l@xmath14 , is exactly what is predicted for mass models of elliptical galaxies designed to explain the gravitational shear of background field galaxies .",
    "if one specifies a scaling relation for the dark halo concentration , one can extend the dark matter distribution out to the virial radius and calculate the total baryon fraction and mass - to - light ratio .",
    "when we attempt to embed our models within the cdm theory of hierarchical halo formation , the implied dark matter scaling badly fails to reproduce the observed @xmath0@xmath1 relation unless smaller galaxies lose an increasingly larger fraction of their initial baryonic content ( see figure 7b ) , such that the average @xmath2 galaxy has lost most of its initial baryonic mass .",
    "alternatively , the global dark - to - luminous mass ratio could be constant if the dark halo concentration declines much more steeply with virial mass than cdm models predict , so that the decrease in @xmath132_{r_{\\rm max}}$ ] for larger systems is a result of a more diffuse dark matter halo rather than a less massive ( relative to the stars ) halo . in this latter scenario ,",
    "dark matter may become increasingly important inside @xmath5 as @xmath27 decreases , becoming dominant for @xmath305 .",
    "this deviation from cdm predictions of dark halo scaling could conceivably be due to a relatively flat primordial fluctuation spectrum on mass scales @xmath306m@xmath18 or to the effects on the dark matter density profile of the evolution of the baryonic component ; to date , large scale structure numerical simulations that can resolve halos on galactic scales _ and _ include a dissipational component have not been attempted .",

    "<S> given the recently deduced relationship between x - ray temperatures and stellar velocity dispersions ( the `` @xmath0@xmath1 relation '' ) in an optically complete sample of elliptical galaxies ( @xcite ) , we demonstrate that @xmath2 ellipticals contain substantial amounts of dark matter _ in general_. we present constraints on the dark matter scale length and on the dark - to - luminous mass ratio within the optical half - light radius and within the entire galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> for example , we find that minimum values of dark matter core radii scale as @xmath3 kpc and that the minimum dark matter mass fraction is @xmath420% within one optical effective radius @xmath5 and is @xmath6@xmath7% within @xmath8 , depending on the stellar density profile and observed value of @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> we also confirm the prediction of davis & white ( 1996 ) that the dark matter is characterized by velocity dispersions that are greater than those of the luminous stars : @xmath10@xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0@xmath1 relation implies a nearly constant mass - to - light ratio within six half - light radii : @xmath12m@xmath13l@xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> this conflicts with the simplest extension of cdm theories of large scale structure formation to galactic scales ; we consider a couple of modifications which can better account for the observed @xmath0@xmath1 relation . </S>"
