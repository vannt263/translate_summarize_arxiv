    "the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) has been successfully accumulating data at the highest recorded collision energies , opening up the teraelectron - volt ( tev ) energy region to direct experimental exploration . at a hadron collider",
    "as the initial states are composed of colored particles , the lhc will produce new colored resonances at a large rate .",
    "this makes the lhc an ideal machine for exploring new colored particles associated with new strong dynamics .",
    "there are many theories of physics beyond the standard model ( bsm ) that give rise to new colored particles .",
    "one such possibility is a massive vector boson in the color - octet representation .",
    "such a particle has been proposed in various scenarios of which we list a sample here .",
    "colorons are predicted in the flavor - universal coloron model , in which the qcd gauge group is extended to @xmath2 with all the quarks assigned to the triplet representation of the strong @xmath3 group  @xcite .",
    "topgluons represent a coloron variant in which the quarks of the third generation are assigned to a representation of one @xmath4 group and the light quarks are assigned to the other ; they arise in topcolor models  @xcite .",
    "axigluons appear in the chiral color model , in which the extension of qcd gauge structure is through new strong chiral gauge symmetry @xmath5 and can feature several kinds of assignment of quark charges to the gauge groups  @xcite .",
    "other examples include kaluza - klein ( kk ) gluons which are the excited gluons in extra - dimensional models @xcite , technirhos which are composite colored vector mesons found in technicolor  @xcite , models that include colored technifermions and low - scale string resonances  @xcite .    the high production rate of a colored resonance ( due to strong coupling ) and the simple topology of the final state ( decay into two jets ) makes the search for di - jet resonances one of the early signatures that are studied at hadron colliders , e.g. the cern @xmath6  @xcite , tevatron  @xcite and lhc  @xcite .",
    "once a new colored resonance is discovered , measuring its properties will be the next important task .",
    "the di - jet invariant mass @xmath7 and the angular distributions of energetic jets relative to the beam axis are sensitive observables to determine the properties , such as mass and spin of the resonance . although one can constrain the coupling strength of the colored resonance to the standard model ( sm ) quarks using the total cross section , this is not sufficient to determine the chiral structure of the couplings .",
    "some additional information about the chiral couplings can potentially be gleaned from the measurement of the forward - backward asymmetry of the top - antitop pair ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "such a measurement has been made at the tevatron @xcite .",
    "motivated by these results , various models with specific chiral structures of the color - octet particle that give rise to a large asymmetry have been proposed  @xcite@xcite . unfortunately due to the proton - proton initial states at the lhc",
    ", the forward backward asymmetry of the top - antitop pair is diluted at that machine compared to the large asymmetry at the tevatron @xcite .",
    "we propose a new channel for studying coloron couplings : the associated production of a @xmath9 or @xmath10 gauge boson with the color - octet at the lhc .",
    "the chiral couplings of the weak gauge bosons to the fermions in the associated production channel provides additional information about the chiral structure of the new strong dynamics .",
    "combining the associated production channel with the di - jet channel makes it possible to extract the chiral couplings of the colored resonance because the cross - sections of each channel have a different dependence on the coloron s couplings to fermions .",
    "the functional form of the dependance of these measurements on the chiral couplings in the di - jet channel is @xmath11 ; in the wjj channel it is @xmath12 and in the zjj channel it is @xmath13 .",
    "a cartoon illustration of these three measurements along with the di - jet measurement is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cartooncouplings ] .",
    "notice that while combining the different channels will narrow the allowed range of couplings , there remains an ambiguity in extracting the sign of the couplings .",

    "boson ( solid black parallel lines with green band ) and the channel with associated production of a @xmath10 boson ( dotted black ellipse with blue band ) .",
    "combining the constraints from different channels will narrow the range of allowed couplings.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ]    in this article we study the sensitivity of the lhc with center of mass ( c.m . ) energy of 14 tev to probe the chiral structure of the couplings for colored resonances with 10 @xmath1 and 100 @xmath1 integrated luminosity by the method proposed above .",
    "we study colored resonances with masses in the range 2.5 tev to 4.5 tev and various couplings and widths ; this mass range runs from the lightest colorons still allowed by lhc dijet searches to the heaviest colorons to which the lhc is likely to be sensitive .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec.[sec : genpar ] we present a simple parameterization for the colored resonances and our notation . in sec.[sec : collph ] we discuss the signal and associated backgrounds , the monte carlo simulation details in sec.[sec : collph - mcsim ] and the channels with charged and neutral gauge bosons in sec .",

    "the color - octet resonance of interest to our study may be motivated in many bsm scenarios as noted in the introduction .",
    "hence we explore a phenomenological model of color - octet resonances independent of the underlying theory .",
    "the interaction of the color - octet resonance @xmath15 with the sm quarks @xmath16 has the form = i g_s|q_ic^_(g_v^i + g_a^i_5 ) q_i = i g_s|q_ic^ _ ( g_l^i p_l + g_r^i p_r ) q_i , [ eq : axicoupl ] where @xmath17 with @xmath18 an @xmath19 generator , @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( or @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) denote vector and axial ( or left and right ) coupling strengths relative to the qcd coupling @xmath24 , the projection operators have the form @xmath25 and the quark flavors run over @xmath26 for simplicity , we will denote the color - octet resonance by @xmath27 and its chiral couplings to light quarks by @xmath28 and to the third generation by @xmath29",
    ".    the various couplings @xmath30 can all be independent in the most general non - universal case and can all be the same in simple flavor universal scenarios .",
    "a study of the former case would be desirable but it is computationally cumbersome and the latter case , while simple , does not include some interesting scenarios . furthermore the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite found that the flavor universal case is excluded at 99.5% by a global fit to top pair data for color - octet masses less than 3 tev .",
    "an interesting ( yet manageable and general ) example is that of a color - octet resonance that can enhance top - pair forward - backward asymmetry in models allowing non - universal couplings when @xcite g_a^q g_a^t < 0 .",

    "a more general study involving fully independent couplings is beyond the scope of this study and will be addressed in a future publication .",

    "it is safe to assume that the final acceptance will be at least equal to or even better than the current one and the small black region in the center could shrink even further .    finally , the dijet reach is much better than that of associated production channel at the lhc , essentially probing near zero couplings .",

    "varying the scales by a factor of two around the central value results in a variation of the signal cross sections of order @xmath136 and can be used as an estimate of the uncertainty of the leading order ( lo ) cross sections . for the backgrounds one can use the k - factors where available or they can be normalized to data in regions outside the signal .",
    "multijet events , which are abundant at the lhc , can fake the signal for the @xmath38 channel if jets are misreconstructed as leptons and if jet transverse energies are poorly measured , leading to a presence of missing energy in the events . as explained in ref .  @xcite these effects will be small with optimized experimental methods .",
    "also high luminosity measurements have to contend with the issue of pile up effects which become important for the longer run . estimating these effects are beyond the scope of this article and we only mention them as possible sources of uncertainties that will need to be accounted for in an experimental analysis .",
