    "paragraph  f9 of  @xcite includes the following problem , attributed to brizolis : given a prime @xmath4 , is there always a pair @xmath1 such that @xmath3 is a primitive root of @xmath0 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 in other words , is there always a primitive root @xmath3 such that the discrete logarithm @xmath7 has a fixed point ?",
    "as we shall see , zhang  ( @xcite ) not only answered the question for sufficiently large @xmath0 , but also estimated the number @xmath8 of pairs @xmath1 which satisfy the equation , have @xmath3 is primitive root , and also have @xmath2 a primitive root which thus must be relatively prime to @xmath9 .",
    "this result seems to have been discovered and proved by zhang in  @xcite and later , independently , by cobeli and zaharescu in  @xcite .",
    "campbell and pomerance ( @xcite , @xcite ) made the value of `` sufficiently large '' small enough that they were able to use a direct search to affirmatively answer brizolis original question .",
    "as in  @xcite , we will also consider a number of variations involving side conditions on @xmath3 and @xmath2 .    in  @xcite",
    ", the first author also investigated the two - cycles of @xmath7 , that is the pairs @xmath1 such that there is some @xmath10 between @xmath11 and @xmath9 such that @xmath12 as we observed , attacking  ( [ tc ] ) directly requires the simultaneous solution of two modular equations , presenting both computational and theoretical difficulties .",
    "whenever possible , therefore , we instead work with the modular equation @xmath13 given @xmath3 , @xmath2 , and @xmath10 as in  ( [ tc ] ) , then ( [ ha ] ) is clearly satisfied and the common value is @xmath14 modulo @xmath0 .",
    "conditions on @xmath3 and @xmath2 in  ( [ tc ] ) can ( sometimes ) be translated into conditions on @xmath2 and @xmath10 in  ( [ ha ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "given a pair @xmath15 which satisfies  ( [ ha ] ) , we can attempt to solve for @xmath3 such that @xmath1 satisfies  ( [ tc ] ) and translate conditions on @xmath15 into conditions on @xmath1 . again , we will investigate using various side conditions .",
    "using the same notation as in  @xcite , we will refer to an integer which is a primitive root modulo @xmath0 as @xmath16 and an integer which is relatively prime to @xmath9 as @xmath17 .",
    "an integer which is both will be referred to as @xmath18 and one which has no restrictions will be referred to as @xmath19 .",
    "all integers will be taken to be between @xmath11 and @xmath9 , inclusive , unless stated otherwise .",
    "if @xmath8 is , as above , the number of solutions to  ( [ fp ] ) such that @xmath3 is a primitive root and @xmath2 is a primitive root which is relatively prime to @xmath9 , then we will say @xmath20 and similarly for other conditions .",
    "likewise the number of solutions to  ( [ tc ] ) will be denoted by @xmath21 and the number of solutions to  ( [ ha ] ) will be denoted by @xmath22 . if @xmath23 , we say that @xmath24 .",
    "the idea of repeatedly applying the function @xmath25 is used in the famous cryptographically secure pseudorandom bit generator of blum and micali .",
    "( @xcite ; see also  @xcite and  @xcite , among others , for further developments . )",
    "if one could predict that a pseudorandom generator was going to fall into a fixed point or cycle of small length , this would obviously be detrimental to cryptographic security .",
    "our data suggests , however , that the chance that a pair @xmath1 is a non - trivial two - cycle is @xmath26 for most of the conditions on choosing @xmath3 and @xmath2 that we have investigated .",
    "likewise the chance that a pair @xmath1 is a fixed point is generally @xmath26 .",
    "this might perhaps be taken as an indication that the seed of one of these pseudorandom generators should be chosen to avoid redundant conditions which would increase the chances of a small cycle .",
    "this paper is meant to serve as a summary of the authors recent work .",
    "for detailed proofs and explanation we refer the reader to our forthcoming paper  ( @xcite ) , in preparation .",
    "numerical examples are provided here to illustrate the conjectures and results .",
    "a list of conjectures and theorems on fixed points appeared in  @xcite and was corrected in the unpublished notes  @xcite . these conjectures and theorems",
    "are summarized in table  [ fptalktable ] , which appeared in  @xcite .",
    "the table also contains new data collected since  @xcite .",
    "@xmath27    [ fpthmsec ]    the first rigorous result on this subject was for @xmath28 . both  @xcite and  @xcite provided bounds on the error involved",
    "; we will use notation closer to  @xcite .",
    "[ cz1thm ] @xmath29    we next turn our attention to @xmath30 , for which we can prove the following result :    [ thm3 ] @xmath31    unfortunately , @xmath32 in the worst case and in any case @xmath33 .",
    "thus the error term overwhelms the main term .",
    "the problem occurs because we use the fact that  ( [ fp ] ) can be solved exactly when @xmath34 and @xmath2 is a @xmath35-th power modulo @xmath0 , and in fact there are exactly @xmath35 such solutions .",
    "when @xmath2 is @xmath18 then @xmath35 is always @xmath11 so counting the number of @xmath2 is sufficient .",
    "when @xmath2 is @xmath19 , however , we need to count the number of @xmath2 such that @xmath36 and @xmath2 is a @xmath35-th power modulo @xmath0 and then multiply by @xmath35 , and do this for each divisor @xmath35 of @xmath9 .",
    "thus an error of even @xmath11 in calculating the number of @xmath2 above for a large value of @xmath35 will result in an error of @xmath37 .",
    "( we can improve the situation somewhat by separating out the elements where @xmath35 is @xmath9 or @xmath38 , but the results are still not what one would wish for .",
    "more details will appear in  @xcite . )",
    "the case where @xmath3 is @xmath16 and @xmath2 is @xmath19 is very similar to the previous case , and unfortunately has the same problem :    [ thm4 ] @xmath39    finally , we should mention that the second author ( in  @xcite ) pointed out that we could also estimate the number @xmath40 of values @xmath2 such that there exists _ some _ @xmath3 satisfying  ( [ fp ] ) , with @xmath41 and @xmath42 :    [ thm5 ] @xmath43    similarly , we have :    [ thm6 ] @xmath44    since we are no longer counting multiple solutions for each value of @xmath2 the problem mentioned above disappears ; the error terms are @xmath45 while the main terms look on average like a constant times @xmath0 .",
    "conjectures relating to equations  ( [ ha ] ) and  ( [ tc ] ) also appeared in  @xcite and were corrected in the unpublished notes  @xcite .",
    "these are summarized in tables  [ hatalktable ] and  [ tctalktable ] , which appeared in  @xcite .",
    "the table also contains new data collected since  @xcite . as in  @xcite ,",
    "we distinguish between the `` trivial '' solutions to  ( [ ha ] ) , where @xmath46 , and the `` nontrivial '' solutions .    it was observed in  @xcite that when neither @xmath2 nor @xmath10 is @xmath17 the relationship between  ( [ tc ] ) and  ( [ ha ] ) is more complicated than in the other cases .",
    "( summaries of the conjectures in these cases are given in tables  [ hatalktable ] and  [ tctalktable ] . )",

    "( the formulas in conjecture  [ conj7]([conj7a ] ) and conjecture  [ conj7]([conj7c ] ) appear in  @xcite with typos .",

    "@xmath55    as observed in  @xcite , conditions on  ( [ tc ] ) can sometimes be translated into conditions on  ( [ ha ] ) in a relatively straightforward manner . in other cases , however , things are more complicated .",
    "let @xmath56 , and let @xmath57 and @xmath58 be such that @xmath59 taking the logarithm of the two equations of  ( [ tc ] ) with respect to the same primitive root @xmath60 and using smith normal form , we can show that  ( [ tc ] ) is equivalent to the equations :    @xmath61    in the case where @xmath62 then this becomes just    @xmath63    thus :    [ equivprop ] if @xmath64 , then there is a one - to - one correspondence between triples @xmath65 which satisfy  ( [ tc ] ) and pairs @xmath15 which satisfy  ( [ ha ] ) , and the value of @xmath3 is unique given @xmath2 and @xmath10 .",
    "in particular , this is true if @xmath2 is @xmath17 or @xmath10 is @xmath17 .    in  @xcite it was claimed that given a pair @xmath15 which is a solution to  ( [ ha ] ) we expect on the average @xmath66 pairs @xmath1 which are solutions to  ( [ tc ] ) .",
    "it is clear from  ( [ tcsmith ] ) , however , that the proper equation to look at in this case is not  ( [ ha ] ) , but @xmath67    now we can approximate the number of nontrivial solutions of  ( [ hasmith ] ) using a similar birthday paradox argument to that used in  @xcite for conjecture  [ conj7 ] .",
    "the end result ( see our forthcoming paper for details ) is the following conjectures :    [ conj8 ]    1 .",

    "almost all of the conjectures on  ( [ fp ] ) , ( [ ha ] ) , and  ( [ tc ] ) lend themselves easily to average versions of the sort treated above .",
