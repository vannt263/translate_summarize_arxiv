    "the spin angular momentum ( sam ) of the photon is a basic quantity in the nature .",
    "since it was conceived  @xcite and experimentally detected  @xcite , the photon spin has been puzzling and still remains mysterious for the time being .",
    "first of all , the separability of the spin from the orbital angular momentum has been a controversial issue for a long time @xcite . the key point for this",
    "is usually attributed @xcite to the transversality of the radiation field . but there appeared in the past decade more and more experimental evidences that the sam is different from the orbital angular momentum .",
    "the spin and orbital angular momentum have distinct effects on tiny birefringent particles held in optical tweezers @xcite .",
    "the conversion of the sam to the orbital angular momentum was observed in anisotropic @xcite , isotropic @xcite and nonlinear @xcite media .",
    "the spin - orbit interaction of a photon was also detected @xcite .",
    "secondly , a common opinion as for the relation between the spin and the polarization is that the spin is the polarization itself @xcite or is , ambiguously , associated with the polarization @xcite .",
    "this seems all that we can say about the relation between the spin and the polarization .",
    "but we are faced with a dilemma .",
    "on one hand , it was observed @xcite that the cartesian components of the spin operator in a second quantized theory commutate with one another .",
    "on the other hand , the photon polarization is usually taken as a classical analogue in quantum mechanics @xcite to illustrate the non - commutability of the cartesian components of the spin of the electron .",
    "the question arises naturally as to how to understand the aforementioned commutativity between the cartesian components of the spin operator .",
    "more importantly , though the photon spin is equal to @xmath2 , it has only two independent eigen components corresponding to the left - handed and right - handed circular polarizations .",
    "so the pauli matrices are frequently used for the spin operator in either theoretical or experimental works , concerning , for example , the sam transfer @xcite and the spin hall effect @xcite .",
    "but it is not without problem @xcite to regard the pauli matrices as the cartesian components of the spin operator . in the first place",
    ", they do not obey the commutation relations appropriate for a spin-@xmath2 particle .",
    "in the second place , they are not in consistency with van enk and nienhuis observation @xcite that the cartesian components of the spin operator are commutative with one another .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate whether and how the spin operator of the photon can be expressed in terms of the pauli matrix .",
    "as we know  @xcite , the spin operator that obeys the commutation relations appropriate for a spin-@xmath2 particle is given by 3-by-3 matrices @xmath3 , which act on three - component vectors referred to as the photon wave function , where @xmath4 with @xmath5 the levi - civit pseudotensor .",
    "it will be shown that the previously introduced 3-by-2 matrix @xcite on the basis of transversality condition is a quasi - unitary transformation ( qut ) .",
    "the spin operator @xmath6 defined on the space of three - component vectors is transformed by this qut into one that is defined on the space of two - component spinors .",
    "it is the transformed spin operator that is expressible in terms of the pauli matrix , but in quite an unusual way .",
    "we will see that ( i ) the spin operator on the spinor space has only component along the wave vector , so that its cartesian components commutate with one another ; ( ii ) the spin operator on the spinor space generates a rotation of the spinor about the wave vector ; ( iii ) the sam in units of @xmath1 is exactly the component of the stokes vector along the wave vector .",
    "consider in free space an arbitrary normalized monochromatic radiation field .",
    "the photon wave function  @xcite @xmath7 in momentum representation satisfies @xmath8 , where the boldfaced symbol stands for a column vector of three components , the superscript @xmath9 denotes the conjugate transpose , and @xmath10 means the inner product @xmath11 of two complex vectors @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "its sam was rigorously separated very recently @xcite from its orbital angular momentum on the basis of transversality condition by observing that the density of the linear momentum can be separated in a similar way @xcite .",
    "the separation of the sam from the orbital angular momentum is gauge - independent .",
    "the sam per photon is given by @xcite @xmath14 . by virtue of the equality @xcite @xmath15 , where the superscript `` t '' denotes the transpose",
    ", it turns into @xmath16 which has a quantum - mechanical interpretation as the expectation value of operator @xmath17 in the state represented by the wave function @xmath7 .",
    "factorizing @xmath7 into @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is a complex unit vector determining the state of polarization and satisfying @xmath20 , @xmath21 is generally a complex scalar function representing the amplitude and satisfying @xmath22 , and substituting into eq .",
    "( [ tsam ] ) , one obtains @xmath23 .",
    "this shows that the sam per photon in a plane wave is @xcite @xmath24      the transversality means that the three - component polarization vector @xmath25 is in reality a two - dimensional vector @xcite . as a result",
    ", @xmath25 can be expanded in terms of a real linearly - polarized basis as @xmath26 where the real unit vectors @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the base vectors that form a right - handed triad with the wave vector obeying @xcite    [ triad ] @xmath29    the unit vector @xmath30 denotes the direction of the wave vector , and @xmath31 is a complex two - component unit spinor satisfying @xmath32 . in eq .",
    "( [ qut3 ] ) the base vectors @xmath27 and @xmath28 of the polarization basis constitute the 3-by-2 matrix @xcite @xmath33 that satisfies @xmath34 when eq .",
    "( [ triad ] ) is considered . with the polarization basis @xmath35 , the spinor @xmath36 plays the role of determining @xcite the state of polarization and",
    "will be referred to as the polarization spinor .",
    "the meaning of subscript `` 3 '' will be clear shortly .",
    "the polarization basis @xmath35 is a qut in the following sense .",
    "firstly , it operates on a unit spinor and yields a unit vector as eq .",
    "( [ qut3 ] ) shows .",
    "secondly , one readily obtains @xmath37 from eq .",
    "( [ qut3 ] ) by making use of eq .",
    "( [ unitarity a ] ) .",
    "this shows that the 2-by-3 matrix @xmath38 operates on a unit vector and yields a unit spinor , indicating the following property : @xmath39 as a matter of fact , direct multiplication gives @xmath40 .",
    "because the matrix @xmath38 always operates on the polarization vector @xmath25 that is perpendicular to @xmath41 , @xmath42 reduces to @xmath2 .",
    "that is to say , eq .",
    "( [ unitarity b ] ) has taken the transversality condition into account .",
    "@xmath38 is the moore - penrose pseudo - inverse @xcite of @xmath35 .",
    "( [ unitarity a ] ) and ( [ unitarity b ] ) express the quasi unitarity of the matrices @xmath35 and @xmath38 . in this regard ,",
    "we will term as the jones space the space of all the unit polarization spinors on which @xmath35 is defined . correspondingly",
    ", we will term as the pancharatnam space the space of all the unit polarization vectors on which @xmath38 is defined , upon considering that pancharatnam @xcite made the first investigation into the physical significance of the phase of polarization vector by exploring the interference between two non - orthogonal polarization vectors .",
    "the qut s @xmath43 and @xmath44 relate these two spaces to each other .",
    "now we are ready to show that the spin operator on the jones space is expressible in terms of the pauli matrix . substituting eq .",
    "( [ qut3 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ spin in pw ] ) and considering eq .",
    "( [ triad ] ) , one arrives at @xmath45 where @xmath46 , @xmath47 is one of the three pauli matrices @xcite , and @xmath48 means the inner product of the matrix vector @xmath49 and the unit wave vector @xmath41 .",
    "the spin operator @xmath49 that is defined on the pancharatnam space is transformed by the qut into @xmath50 that is defined on the jones space .",
    "this shows that @xmath49 is equivalent to @xmath51 when the qut is taken into account .",
    "the photon spin is thus always along @xmath41 .",
    "remarkably , contrary to what might be expected @xcite , the spin operator @xmath0 contains only one of the pauli matrices , @xmath52 .",
    "it describes exactly the fact that the spin has only two eigen states of eigen values @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "in addition , its cartesian components commutate with one another , in complete agreement with van enk and nienhuis conclusion @xcite .",
    "it is the real - valuedness of the polarization basis @xmath35 that makes the spin operator on the jones space have the form of pauli matrix @xmath54 .",
    "this is why we adopt the subscript `` 3 '' to denote that polarization basis .",
    "as we know , the change of polarization basis is represented by a unitary transformation @xcite .",
    "let us first consider the following unitary transformation , @xmath55 inserting the identity @xmath56 into eq .",
    "( [ qut3 ] ) and letting    @xmath57    one has for the same polarization vector , @xmath58 the complex unit vectors @xmath59 and @xmath60 in eq .",
    "( [ pb1 ] ) describe the two orthogonal circular polarizations .",
    "they form the new polarization basis @xmath61 , which is also a qut . substituting eq .",
    "( [ qut1 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ spin in pw ] ) yields @xmath62 where @xmath63 , @xmath64 , showing that the spin operator @xmath49 on the pancharatnam space is transformed by @xmath61 into @xmath65 .",
    "as is expected , the spin operator @xmath65 on the jones space has only component along @xmath41 and contains only one of the pauli matrices , @xmath66 .",
    "now we consider a second polarization - basis change represented by another unitary transformation @xmath67 .",
    "inserting the identity @xmath68 into eq .",
    "( [ qut1 ] ) and letting    @xmath69    one has another expression for the polarization vector , @xmath70 the matrix @xmath71 , again a qut , represents a third polarization basis that consists of a pair of complex rectilinear base vectors . upon substituting eq .",
    "( [ qut2 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ spin in pw ] ) , one gets @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "again , the transformed spin operator @xmath75 from @xmath76 by @xmath71 is along @xmath41 and contains only one of the pauli matrices , @xmath77 .",
    "in summary of this section we see that in a particular polarization basis @xmath78 , the polarization vector is expressed as @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the polarization spinor associated with @xmath43 , the base vectors @xmath81 and @xmath82 obey    [ base vectors ] @xmath83    which guarantees that @xmath43 and @xmath44 satisfy @xmath84 and act as the qut s connecting the jones and pancharatnam spaces . the spin operator @xmath49 on the pancharatnam space is transformed into @xmath85 on the jones space , where @xmath86 is an hermitian unitary matrix satisfying @xmath87 .",
    "this shows that the spin operator on the jones space is expressed by a single hermitian unitary matrix and is always along the direction of the wave vector .",
    "denoting the eigen spinors of operator @xmath88 by @xmath89 satisfying @xmath90 and noticing eq .",
    "( [ unitarity ] ) , one then has @xmath91 , where @xmath92 .",
    "this means that the eigen spinors of @xmath88 correspond to the eigen vectors of operator @xmath48 via eq .",
    "( [ qut ] ) . if the polarization basis is changed according to @xmath93 and @xmath94 with a unitary transformation @xmath95 , the operator @xmath96 is changed as @xmath97 consequently , the hermitian unitary matrix in the spin operator @xmath98 takes different forms in different polarization bases .",
    "berry @xcite once observed that the sam is invariant when the polarization vector is rotated about the wave vector .",
    "this is the case because it is just in the direction of the wave vector . in this section",
    "we will show that a so(3 ) rotation of the polarization vector about the wave vector corresponds , via the qut , to a su(2 ) rotation of the polarization spinor about the same axis through the same angle , a relation that is quite different from what is known in the literature  @xcite .    consider a polarization vector @xmath25 that is given by eq .",
    "( [ qut ] ) .",
    "a so(3 ) rotation @xmath99 about @xmath41 through an angle @xmath100 transforms @xmath25 into @xmath101 this can be interpreted as rotating the polarization basis about @xmath41 , @xmath102 , with the polarization spinor remaining unchanged .",
    "since @xmath103 commutates with @xmath104 , it follows from eq .",
    "( [ spin on js ] ) that the spin operator on the jones space is invariant under a rotation of the polarization basis about @xmath41 , @xmath105 as a matter of fact , the two conditions in eq .",
    "( [ base vectors ] ) do not uniquely determine the polarization basis up to such a rotation  @xcite .",
    "the so(3 ) rotation operator can be written as @xcite @xmath106 substituting it into eq .",
    "( [ rotated pv ] ) and noticing that the base vectors in @xmath43 are perpendicular to @xmath41 , one has @xmath107 by making use of eqs .",
    "( [ unitarity ] ) and ( [ spin on js ] ) , one may rewrite it as @xmath108 this can be reinterpreted as rotating the polarization spinor about @xmath41 , @xmath109 the generator being the spin operator , with the polarization basis remaining unchanged . because the generator of this su(2 ) rotation is without the factor @xmath110 that we encounter in the case of electrons , the rotation angle is the same as the so(3 ) rotation .",
    "this completes our proof .",
    "the invariance of the sam under the rotation of the polarization vector or the polarization spinor about @xmath41 means that the spin is different from the polarization .",
    "since the polarization state of a completely polarized plane wave can be exactly described by the stokes vector , we will explore in the next the relation of the sam with the stokes vector .",

    "now that the sam is in the direction of the wave vector , it is exactly the component of the stokes vector along the wave vector .",
    "this is easily proven .",
    "suppose that the spin operator on the jones space is given by @xmath140 with @xmath132 the pauli vector in a particular polarization basis .",
    "( [ gamma from sigma ] ) guarantees that the component of the stokes vector along @xmath41 , @xmath141 , is invariant under the rotation of the polarization spinor about @xmath41 by virtue of eq .",
    "( [ rotated ps ] ) , the same as the sam is .",
    "so the component of the stokes vector along @xmath41 is the sam .",
    "jauch and rohrlich  @xcite once found that the sam is equal to one component of the stokes vector in a second quantization theory of the radiation field .",
    "unfortunately , their result received little attention .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown that the photon spin operator on the jones space is given by @xmath142 in terms of an hermitian unitary matrix @xmath88 .",
    "it is in the direction of the wave vector .",

    ", we found that a so(3 ) rotation of the polarization vector about the wave vector corresponds to a su(2 ) rotation of the polarization spinor through the same angle about the same axis .",
    "it is very interesting to note that the generator of the former rotation is the component of spin operator @xmath49 along the wave vector and that of the latter rotation is the spin operator @xmath0 itself .",
    "furthermore , the sam is just the component of the stokes vector along the wave vector .",
    "the theory advanced here for the photon spin on the jones space is a probabilistic one that is compatible with the quantum mechanical description @xcite of a photon state . upon transforming from the pancharatnam space to the jones space by the qut ,",
    "one arrives at the two - component polarization spinor , which is much suitable to deal with the angular momentum problem of the radiation field .",
    "it is noted that the two conditions in eq .",
    "( [ triad ] ) or eq .",
    "( [ base vectors ] ) leave the polarization basis undetermined up to a rotation about the wave vector .",
