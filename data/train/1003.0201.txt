    "dwarf galaxies are , apart from stellar clusters , the most fundamental stellar systems .",
    "they are believed to be the building blocks of larger galaxies in hierarchical galaxy formation theories ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and can provide insight into galaxy formation and evolution on the smallest scales @xcite . the local volume",
    "( lv , @xmath7 ) provides a diverse environment in which these systems can be studied .",
    "the observations of dwarf galaxies in the lv , however , remain challenging due to their characteristic low surface brightness ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "the availability of more sensitive detectors has led to the discovery of numerous dwarf galaxies in the lv .",
    "these stellar systems can now be studied in unprecedented detail to measure their physical properties ( e.g.,stellar , gas and dark matter content ) .",
    "overall , an understanding of the physical mechanisms driving the observational properties of dwarf galaxies can significantly impact our current views of galaxy formation and evolution , as well as the nature of dark matter .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the @xmath2-band stellar @xmath16 ratio of the galaxies was computed using the linear relation : @xmath17 the stellar @xmath16 ratio was calculated for each of the irsf dwarfs by substituting their individual @xmath14-@xmath2 colour into equation ( [ ml_eqn ] ) . to increase the statistics by using a larger galaxy sample ,",
    "galaxies having absolute magnitudes in the range of @xmath18 in the @xcite sample were also used in calculating the @xmath16 ratio .",
    "these magnitudes span the range of @xmath2-band absolute magnitudes observed for the irsf dwarf galaxies ( see table  [ 2mass_comp ] ) .",
    "a total of 33 dwarf galaxies were identified in this magnitude range .",
    "it should be noted that the dirr galaxy am  0521 - 343 in the @xcite sample was excluded as the photometry of this galaxy is compromised by a bright foreground star .",
    "the @xmath16 ratio of the dwarf galaxies was computed by taking the mean of the individual ratios obtained for both the irsf and @xcite galaxy samples .",
    "this gives an @xmath2-band stellar @xmath16 ratio of @xmath19 where the error in the @xmath16 ratio represents the standard deviation of the mean .",
    "this value overlaps with the @xmath16 ratio of @xmath20 obtained by @xcite for their full sample of 57 galaxies ( consisting mostly of irregulars ) .",
    "the @xmath16 ratio of @xmath19 was used to calculate the stellar mass of each of the irsf dwarfs .",
    "the extinction - corrected , absolute @xmath2-band magnitudes @xmath21 of the galaxies were converted into luminosity using the standard relation @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the @xmath2-band luminosity of the sun @xcite .",
    "the total stellar masses of the galaxies are listed in table  [ ml_ratio1 ] .",
    "the two brightest dwarfs ( ngc  3115  dw01 and ngc  5206 ) in the sample ( @xmath24 ) , have the largest stellar masses which are of the order of @xmath25 .",
    "@xcite measure @xmath26 as the lower mass estimate of ngc  3115  dw01",
    ". this mass estimate was obtained from the kinematics of seven gcs in the galaxy .",
    "we have derived an @xmath2-band stellar mass of @xmath27 for ngc  3115  dw01 which is @xmath28 times lower than the mass estimate imposed by the kinematics of the seven gcs .",
    "the dynamical mass of ngc  3115  dw01 is measured out to a projected radius of @xmath29 , making it almost twice as large as the radius in which the stellar mass of the galaxy was determined .",
    "this result suggests that ngc  3115  dw01 is a very dm dominated galaxy with no direct evidence of an extended dm halo ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , it is also possible that the gc system of @xcite is not virialised around ngc  3115  dw01 giving the higher dynamical mass estimate for the galaxy .",
    "given the masses for the galaxies ngc  59 and eso  384 - 016 , we are able to derive the gas - to - star mass fractions for these systems ( see table  [ ml_ratio1 ] )",
    ". the mass of ngc  59 corresponds to @xmath303% of its total stellar mass .",
    "this galaxy contains the largest amount of gas compared to the other early - type dwarfs in the scl group @xcite .",
    "the relatively large content of ngc  59 together with the ionized gas in the galaxy center @xcite suggests that this galaxy can not be classified as a genuine ds0 galaxy .",
    "instead , this detection supports the claim of @xcite that this dwarf should rather be classified as a mixed - type ds0/im galaxy as it exhibits the characteristics of both early and late - type galaxies .",
    "the galaxy eso  384 - 016 shows a larger gas fraction to that detected for the star - forming galaxy ngc  59 .",
    "this correlates with the mass to @xmath14-band luminosity ratios measured by @xcite where the lower gas fraction was measured for ngc  59 .",
    "these were found to be @xmath31 for eso  384 - 016 while ngc  59 has @xmath32 .",
    "eso  384 - 016 represents one of four mixed - type dwarfs in the cen  a group @xcite .",
    "only two of the mixed - type dwarfs ( including eso  384 - 016 ) have been detected in .",
    "these galaxies show @xmath33 ratios similar to that found for mixed - morphology dwarfs in the local group @xcite .",
    "in addition , the distribution of eso  384 - 016 shows an eastern extension of the gas ( see * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite suggest that the distribution of this galaxy is a result of mild ram pressure exerted by an intergalactic medium of density @xmath34 .",
    "the upper mass limit for ngc  5206 was used to estimate the gas fraction of this dwarf .",
    "the stellar mass is the main contributor to the baryonic mass of this galaxy .",
    "the gas content of ngc  5206 is found to be less than 0.1% of the total stellar mass .",
    "deep nir @xmath0- , @xmath2- and @xmath4-band imaging were obtained for a sample of six early - type dwarf galaxies in the lv ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "the galaxies are detected down to a sb limit of @xmath35 in the @xmath0- and @xmath2-bands , and @xmath36 in the @xmath4-band .",
    "the low sb galaxies leda  166099 and ugca  200 are detected in the nir for the first time .",
    "a detailed nir photometric study was conducted for each of the dwarf galaxies to explore the properties and various characteristics of the old stellar component of the galaxy .",
    "the deep nir observations allow for an accurate measure of the total magnitudes of even the faintest galaxies in our sample .",
    "the total magnitudes of the three brightest ( @xmath37 ) galaxies ngc  3115  dw01 , ngc  59 and ngc  5206 were compared to those obtained by 2mass . for these galaxies , we find that 2mass can underestimate the magnitudes by up to @xmath38 .",
    "the remaining galaxies in our sample were not detected by 2mass .",
    "these findings highlight the selection biases faced when using photometric data from the 2mass galaxy survey .",
    "the structure of the underlying stellar component was determined by fitting an analytical function to the one - dimensional light profile of the galaxy .",
    "an exponential law was fit to the stellar disk of those galaxies hosting a nucleus .",
    "the effective radius @xmath13 and corresponding sb @xmath12 associated with the disk component were derived for these galaxies .",
    "the light profiles of the non - nucleated galaxies were best modeled by a srsic law .",
    "the six dwarf galaxies are found to have similar nir structure to early - type dwarf systems in the virgo cluster . a first indication of the extension of the relations between the structural parameters ( @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) and @xmath2-band luminosity to low luminosities ( @xmath39 ) is given by the faintest galaxies in our sample .",
    "this parameter space remains largely unexplored due to the lack of nir data for low sb dwarf galaxies .",
    "the @xmath0-@xmath4 colour was derived for the individual dwarf galaxies to explore its variation with the @xmath4-band luminosity of the galaxy .",
    "we found that the six dwarfs exhibit almost constant @xmath0-@xmath4 which is independent of their luminosity .",
    "in addition , the nearly constant @xmath0-@xmath4 colours with luminosity are observed for early - type dwarf galaxies in the virgo cluster .",
    "these results suggest that the @xmath0-@xmath4 colour is not a strong tracer of the galaxy metallicity in early - type dwarf systems .",
    "the six dwarfs were also found to have typical @xmath14-@xmath4 colours to those seen in early - type dwarf galaxies which are independent of environment .",
    "the correlation between the @xmath14- and @xmath2-band luminosities implies that the dwarf galaxies are not strongly affected by dust attenuation so that similar galaxy morphologies are revealed at optical and nir wavelengths .",
    "finally , the stellar masses of the six galaxies were determined from the @xmath2-band observations .",
    "the dwarf galaxies are found to have stellar masses in the range of @xmath40@xmath41 .",
    "for the case of ngc  3115  dw01 , the stellar mass was compared to its dynamical mass estimate indicating that this galaxy is dm dominated and a possible candidate for hosting a dm halo .",
    "the gas - to - star mass fractions were determined for those galaxies in which neutral hydrogen gas has been detected .",
    "the galaxies ngc  59 and eso  384 - 016 show gas - to - star mass fractions of @xmath42% providing further support that these are mixed - type systems rather than pure dwarf elliptical ( de ) or lenticular ( ds0 ) galaxies .",
