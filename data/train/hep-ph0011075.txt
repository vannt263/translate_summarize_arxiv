    "the cdf collaboration has recently published the results of a first measurement of the helicity content of the @xmath1 gauge boson in top quark decays  @xcite .",
    "their results are @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 denote the rates into the longitudinal and transverse - plus polarization state of the @xmath1-boson and @xmath13 is the total rate .",
    "the errors on this measurement are still rather large but will be much reduced when larger data samples become available in the future from tevatron run ii , and , at a later stage , from the lhc . optimistically the measurement errors can eventually be reduced to the @xmath14 level  @xcite . if such a level of accuracy can in fact be reached it is important to discuss the radiative corrections to the different helicity rates  @xcite considering the fact that the @xmath0 radiative corrections to the total width @xmath13 are rather large ( @xmath15 )  @xcite .",
    "the transverse - plus rate @xmath12 is particularly interesting in this regard .",
    "simple helicity considerations show that @xmath12 vanishes at the born term level in the @xmath16 limit .",
    "a nonvanishing transverse - plus rate could arise from i ) @xmath8 effects , ii ) @xmath0 radiative corrections due to gluon emission , or from iii ) non - sm @xmath17 currents .",
    "as we shall show the @xmath0 and the @xmath18 corrections to the transverse - plus rate occur only at the sub - percent level .",
    "it is safe to say that , if top quark decays reveal a violation of the standard model ( sm ) @xmath19 current structure that exceeds the @xmath20 level , the violations must have a non - sm origin . in this context",
    "we mention that a possible @xmath21 admixture to the @xmath17 current is already severely bounded indirectly by existing data on @xmath22 decays  @xcite .",
    "the results of the radiative correction calculation have already been published before by some of us  @xcite . however , in ref .",
    "@xcite the emphasis was on polarized top decay .",
    "besides , in ref .",
    "@xcite the results on the transverse components of the @xmath1 were given for the `` unpolarized - transverse '' and the `` forward - backward '' components which differ from those used in the cdf analysis .",
    "we thought it would be useful to collect together in one place all formulae relevant for an understanding of the new cdf measurement .",
    "this includes also a discussion of @xmath18 effects for the born term and for the @xmath9 radiative corrections , which is new .",
    "let us begin by writing down the angular decay distribution for the decay process @xmath23 followed by @xmath24 ( or by @xmath25 ) . for unpolarized top decay the angular decay distribution",
    "is determined by two transverse components ( transverse - plus and transverse - minus ) and the longitudinal component of the @xmath1-boson .",
    "one has  @xcite @xmath26 integrating over @xmath27 one recovers the total rate @xmath28    we describe the angular decay distribution in cascade fashion , i.e.  the polar angle @xmath29 is measured in the @xmath1 rest frame where the lepton pair or the quark pair emerges back - to - back .",
    "the angle @xmath29 denotes the polar angle between the @xmath30 momentum direction and the antilepton @xmath31 ( or the antiquark @xmath32 ) ( see fig .  1 ) . the various contributions in ( [ ang ] ) are reflected in the shape of the lepton energy spectrum in the rest frame of the top quark .",
    "from the angular factors in ( [ ang ] ) it is clear that the contribution of @xmath12 makes the lepton spectrum harder while @xmath33 softens the spectrum where the hardness or softness is gauged relative to the longitudinal contribution .",
    "the only surviving contribution in the forward direction @xmath34 comes from @xmath12 .",
    "the fact that @xmath12 is predicted to be quite small implies that the lepton spectrum will be soft .",
    "the cdf measurement of the helicity content of the @xmath30 in top decays was in fact done by fitting the values of the helicity rates to the shape of the lepton s energy spectrum .    the angular decay distribution of the antitop decay @xmath35 followed by @xmath36 ( or by @xmath37 ) can be obtained from the angular decay distribution ( [ ang ] ) by the substitution @xmath38 . the polar angle @xmath29 is now defined with regard to the lepton @xmath39 ( or the quark ) direction .",

    "in the standard model the top decay rate is dominated by the decay process @xmath40 with a branching ratio close to @xmath41 .",
    "the corresponding born term contribution is shown in fig .",
    "we use the scaled masses @xmath42 , @xmath43 and the klln - type function @xmath44 . including the full @xmath45-dependence ,",
    "the born term rate is given by @xmath46 the partial helicity rates are given in terms of the born term rate .",
    "one has @xmath47 in eqs .",
    "( [ born+ ] ) we have also listed the leading components of the small @xmath48 expansion of the born term rate ratios . as the second equation of ( [ born+ ] ) shows and as already remarked on before , the transverse - plus born term contribution vanishes in the @xmath16 limit .",
    "note that the leading contribution to the transverse - plus rate is proportional to @xmath49 and not proportional to @xmath50 as stated in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the @xmath8 effects are quite small . using @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and a pole mass of @xmath53  @xcite",
    ", one finds that @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 decrease by @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 , resp .  when going from @xmath16 to @xmath53 .",
    "the leakage into the transverse - plus rate ratio @xmath60 from bottom mass effects is a mere @xmath61 .",
    "the @xmath0 corrections are determined by the one - loop vertex correction shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2]b and the gluon emission graphs shown in figs .",
    "[ fig2]c and [ fig2]d .",
    "the one - loop results have already been known for quite some time  @xcite and will not be discussed any further .",
    "we do want to make a few technical remarks about how the tree - graph integration was done .",
    "we use a gluon mass to regularize the ir singularity . concerning the collinear singularity we have kept the full bottom mass dependence in our calculation and have only set the bottom mass to zero at the very end .",
    "we have thus effectively used a mass regulator to regularize the collinear singularity .",
    "the tree - graph integration has to be done over two - dimensional phase space . as phase space variables we use the gluon energy @xmath62 and the @xmath1 energy @xmath63 .",
    "the ir behaviour of the hadronic tree - graph matrix element @xmath64 was improved by subtracting from it the soft - gluon contribution @xmath65 which was then added again according to the prescription @xmath66 the first piece @xmath67 has thereby been rendered ir finite and can be integrated without a gluon mass regulator which considerably simplifies the phase space integration .",
    "the ir singularity resides in the soft gluon piece @xmath65 which is , however , simple and universal and can be easily integrated .",
    "in fact the soft gluon contribution factorizes into the born term contribution @xmath68 and a universal soft gluon factor @xmath69 according to @xmath70 the born term contribution @xmath68 is given by @xmath71 while the soft - gluon factor in ( [ sga ] ) has the standard form @xmath72    note that the tensor structure carrying the spin information of the produced @xmath1-boson has been factored out and is now entirely contained in the born term factor @xmath68 . since the born term factor does not depend on the phase space variables , the phase space integration needs to be done only with respect to the soft gluon factor @xmath69 and",
    "thus needs to be done only once irrespective of the polarisation of the @xmath1-boson .",
    "needless to say that this is a very welcome simplifying feature of the above subtraction procedure .",
    "this is different for the phase space integration of the ir - finite piece @xmath67 where the integration has to be done separately for each polarization state of the @xmath73-boson . to do the necessary two - dimensional phase space integrations in analytical form",
    "is somewhat involved .",
    "in particular the integrations are more difficult than those needed for the total rate calculation which has already been done some time ago  @xcite .",
    "the complicating feature can be best appreciated by discussing how one obtains the various helicity components of the @xmath1-boson .",
    "we chose to use covariant projectors to project out the various helicity components of the @xmath1-boson .",
    "for the total rate one has the familiar form @xmath74 where we have added the label @xmath75 for added emphasis . in the following we shall freely switch between the notation @xmath13 and @xmath76 for the total rate .",
    "the projector ( [ projtot ] ) can be seen to reduce to the appropiate three - dimensional form @xmath77 in the @xmath1 rest system .",
    "the longitudinal helicity rate is obtained with the help of the projector @xmath78 the transverse - plus and transverse - minus helicity projectors are obtained in an indirect way by first considering the sum and the difference of the transverse - plus and transverse - minus projectors .",
    "the sum is labelled by the index @xmath79 ( unpolarized - transverse ) , and the corresponding projector is obtained from @xmath80 .",
    "the difference of the transverse - plus and transverse - minus helicity projectors is labelled by the index @xmath81 ( forward - backward ) projector which is given by @xmath82 the transverse - plus and transverse - minus projectors are thus determined by the linear combinations @xmath83 .",
    "the inverse powers of the magnitude @xmath84 of the three - momentum of the @xmath1-boson appear in the projectors for normalization reasons .",
    "it is mainly because of the additional factors of @xmath85 in the helicity rates that makes their phase space integration technically more involved than the total rate integration since new classes of phase space integrals appear .",
    "our final results are presented for the @xmath16 limit where the rate expressions reduce to a rather compact form .",
    "we add together the born term , the one - loop and the tree - graph contribution .",
    "the results are taken from ref .",
    "we divide out the total @xmath86 born term rate and denote the scaled rates @xmath87 ( @xmath88 ) by a hat symbol .",
    "the two transverse helicity rates @xmath89 are obtained from the @xmath90 rates given in  @xcite by taking the linear combinations @xmath91 as discussed before .",
