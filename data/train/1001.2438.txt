    "constructing the shape model of a three - dimensional object or a surface is often based on images obtained at various viewing geometries .",
    "this is the standard case in human and robot vision as well as in cartography . when individual points on the surface can be identified in different images",
    ", one can directly solve for their position vectors and use this as a top - down basis for stereographic mapping or model construction .",
    "in many cases , however , the model construction reduces to an inverse problem rather than a cartographic one as the image information is based purely on the projections of the target in the viewing directions .",
    "when surface illumination and other effects are taken into account , we talk about _ generalized projections _ @xcite to distinguish these from simple shadow - like projections or silhouettes . as discussed in @xcite , there are various types of such projections , ranging from the volume - like quantity of integrated brightness @xmath2 ( generalization of the area of a shadow on a projection screen ) to resolved images @xmath3 ( for one wavelength ) .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the case where images @xmath4 obtained at various viewing and illumination directions @xmath5 are available , but the infomation in these images is only contained in the boundary curves between the dark background or a shadow and the illuminated portion of the target surface .",
    "this situation is typical for faraway objects in space for which low - resolution images are available via large telescopes through adaptive optics ( ao ) @xcite or other deconvolution and image processing techniques . due to the deconvolution process",
    ", the actual brightness levels of the pixels in these images tend to portray artificial and exaggerated features , so they are usually less reliable than profile contours , i.e. , the locations of the light / dark boundary pixels @xcite .",
    "as the coverage of viewing geometries is seldom wide enough to enable a full reconstruction of the model from images alone , we also consider the possibility of augmenting the image dataset with a set of measured brightnesses @xmath6 of the target at various observing geometries .",
    "subsets of these , measured within some time intervals , are called lightcurves . as discussed in @xcite-@xcite",
    "( see also references therein ) , a global , usually convex , model of the target can be obtained from a large enough set of @xmath6 . the possibility to use images @xmath7 both serves to reconstruct more details in the model and to use a combined dataset for successful modelling when neither the available @xmath8 nor @xmath7 are sufficient alone .",
    "the ratio of profile contour pixels to all pixels of the target is approximately @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is a typical diameter of the target in pixels . for the largest few asteroid ao targets ,",
    "@xmath10 is around 30 .",
    "when @xmath10 is less than about 10 , the location accuracy of the border pixels is not necessarily very much better than the brightness accuracy of the pixels , but on the other hand there is no particular loss in the number of information points when only borders are used . for higher @xmath10 , border points are a smaller subset of available pixels , but now their location accuracy is far better than the brightness accuracy of all pixels @xcite .",
    "the profile contours of the ao images are obtained as a solution of a separate inverse ( or imaging ) problem , where an approximation of the atmospheric point - spread function ( psf ) is first used to deconvolve the raw image ( with , e.g. , connectedness of the processed image as a constraint ) , and the contours can be separately modelled with wavelet techniques @xcite .",
    "this independence from the actual model of the target is advantageous in the sense that the assumptions and inevitable deficiencies of the model ( particularly in the adopted light - scattering model on the surface @xcite ) do not affect the outcome of the ao image processing . on the other hand , from the methodological point of view",
    ", all information should usually be employed simultaneously when solving an inverse problem , so another approach would be to use the raw ao image data and the approximated psf directly in model construction without separate image deconvolution . however , in practice it appears that the profile curve extraction procedure , in particular , retains valuable independent information @xcite , and the model deficiencies affect the fit deviation between the predicted and observed model profile curves less than they affect that between the full model and ao images . what is more , below we show that the profile curves convey almost as much information on the shape as the full images , so we can conclude that the two - step inversion of ao ( and brightness ) data is well justified .",
    "the paper is organized in sections in the following manner . in section 2",
    "we study the information content of profile contours and show uniqueness results for the inverse problem of reconstructing shapes from these .",
    "section 3 deals with the posing of the inverse problem and the choice of regularization functions . in section 4",
    ", we discuss the weighting and maximum compatibility estimates for inverse problems with multiple data modes , and examples of the use of real brightness data @xmath8 and images @xmath7 are presented in section 5 .",
    "section 6 sums up .",
    "in this section , we define the concept of generalized profiles as boundary curves corresponding to generalized projections , and show that a large class of shapes is reconstructable from these . while many practical procedures for shape - from - profiles ( also known as volume carving ) and shape - from - shading are well known in , e.g. , computer vision ( see @xcite and references therein ) and cartography ( clinometry ) , some of their geometric characteristics and the properties of the corresponding shape classes and inverse problems discussed here have not been previously stated in the mathematical literature , to the best of our knowledge .",
    "let us first look at classical profiles defined by one direction @xmath11 , i.e. , @xmath12 .",
    "the projection @xmath13 of a compact set @xmath14 ( a set of points on closed surfaces ) in the direction @xmath11 maps @xmath15 : =(    ccc 0&1&0 + 0&0&1    ) r_y(-)r_z ( ) x , where @xmath16 are the polar coordinate angles defining @xmath17 and @xmath18 is the rotation matrix corresponding to the rotation of the coordinate frame through angle @xmath19 in the positive direction about the @xmath20-axis .",

    "the endpoints of @xmath200 are at @xmath204 and @xmath205 , i.e. , at the values of @xmath192 that result from using only one of the data modes in inversion .",

    "denote x_0&=&x()_=0=_1 ^ 2 + y_0&=&y()_=_2 ^ 2 .",
    "then the `` ideal point '' @xmath206 is the new origin in the @xmath207-plane .",
    "a natural choice for an optimal location on @xmath187 is the point closest to @xmath206 , i.e. , the parameter values @xmath208 such that p_0=([^2_1(p)-x_0]^2+[^2_2(p)- y_0]^2 ) , so we have , with @xmath88 as argument , _ 0=([x()-x_0]^2+[y()- y_0]^2).[lambda0 ] in this approach , neither the numbers of data points in each @xmath185 nor the noise levels as such affect the solution for the optimal @xmath209 as their scaling effects cancel out in each quadratic term .",
    "@xmath209 is thus a pure compatibility estimate describing the best model compromise explaining the datasets of different modes simultaneously .",
    "we call the point @xmath209 the _ maximum compatibility estimate _ ( mce ) , and @xmath210 the _ maximum compatibility weight _ ( mcw ) .",
    "this corresponds to the maximum likelihood estimate in the case of one data mode , or to the maximum a posteriori estimate as well since we can include regularization functions here .",
    "if regularizing is used , the weights for the functions are either determined in a similar manner ( see below ) , or they can be fixed and the regularization terms are absorbed in @xmath211 ( otherwise @xmath199 does not hold ) .",
    "another choice , frequently used in the l - curve approach , is to find the @xmath88 at which @xmath187 attains its maximum curvature @xcite , but evaluating this point is less robust than finding @xmath210 , and ( [ lambda0 ] ) is a more natural prescription , requiring no assumptions on the shape of @xmath187 .",
    "we make two implicit assumptions here :    1 .",
    "the solutions @xmath212 corresponding to points on @xmath188 should be continuous ( and one - to - one ) in @xmath191-space along @xmath188 at least in the vicinity of the solution corresponding to @xmath210 .",
    "if this is not true ( in practice , if @xmath213 makes large jumps in @xmath191 for various @xmath88 around @xmath210 ) , one should be cautious about the uniqueness and stability of the chosen solution @xmath209 , and restrict the regions of @xmath191 included in the analysis .",
    "the optimal point @xmath210 on @xmath187 should be feasible : if we have upper limits @xmath214 to acceptable @xmath185 , the feasible region @xmath215 is the rectangle @xmath216 .",

    ". however , it is useful ( though computationally somewhat noisier ) to approximate @xmath187 via the minimization of @xmath223 with sample values of @xmath88 ( see fig .  1 ) , as in addition to obtaining the mcw @xmath210 ( and hence mce as well ) we can plot @xmath187 to examine the mutual behaviour of the complementary data sources ( including the position of the feasibility region @xmath215 w.r.t .",
    "@xmath187 ) .",
    "the solution for @xmath210 is also needed for constructing distributions based on @xmath83 .",
    "another possibility to examine @xmath196 and @xmath188 is direct adaptive monte carlo sampling , but this is computationally slow .",
    "this approach straightforwardly generalizes to @xmath182 @xmath89-functions and @xmath224 parameters @xmath225 describing the position on the @xmath224-dimensional boundary surface @xmath188 of an @xmath182-dimensional domain @xmath196 : the mce is p_0=_i=1^n^2 , ^2_i0:=^2_i(p),[p0 ] and the mcw is r^n-1:_0=_i=1^n^2 , _",

    "this , however , is exactly the first - order approximation of ( [ p0 ] ) and ( [ l0 ] ) in @xmath228 when @xmath229 , giving virtually the same result as ( [ p0 ] ) and ( [ l0 ] ) as usually @xmath230 in the region around @xmath231 , and any larger ratios of @xmath226 are not eligible for the optimal solution ( see fig .  1 ) .    instead of the @xmath232-norm @xmath89 ( and the corresponding @xmath89-distribution",
    ") , we can choose some other goodness - of - fit measure @xmath233 ( and distribution ) for the individual data modes . for a linear combination of these",
    ", we have @xmath234 in lightcurve measurements , for example , the effect of systematic errors in both model and data dominates over random noise when the noise level is not high @xcite , so it is not mandatory to use @xmath89 as a standard measure of fit .",
    "curve plotted for 2 pallas with various weights @xmath88 ( lc for lightcurves , ao for adaptive optics profiles).,width=415 ]    it is possible to use this approach for general regularizing functions @xmath86 as well ( change @xmath235 for some @xmath20 ) , but in such cases the shape of @xmath187 must be taken into account .",
    "if it is possible to have a solution @xmath236 for a regularizing function @xmath237 ( or an almost vanishing @xmath238 such that @xmath239 ) , the above scheme automatically returns @xmath240 and ignores the actual data altogether .",
    "thus one should , e.g. , set a lower practical limit to @xmath86 by looking at the shape of @xmath241 , and choose the @xmath210 within the restricted part of @xmath241 .",
    "likewise , one can use the above scheme for assigning noise - level - independent weights to subsets of the same data mode ( rather than have the standard @xmath89 evaluated from all data points ) , but obviously the subsets can not be chosen arbitrarily if the result is to make sense .",
    "for example , one can estimate the optimal weight for one lightcurve that appears to reveal features not contained in other lightcurves and thus judge its real significance .",
    "even one noisy lightcurve with a few points , taken at a special observing geometry , may well contain significant information that needs to be weighed more against less noisy but more ordinary lightcurves .",
    "as examples of the optimal combining of lightcurves and ao profiles , we show representative results for the asteroids 2 pallas and 41 daphne .",
    "full detailed descriptions of the observations and models of these targets are presented in @xcite and carry et al .",
    "( in preparation ) .",
    "an example of an even more irregular shape constructed with our procedure is the model of the primary body of the binary asteroid 121 hermione @xcite .",
    "the lightcurve @xmath242 was computed as in @xcite and profile @xmath99 as in the starlike case of section 3 , and the minimization of @xmath83 was performed as in @xcite .",
    "the observed profiles are projections of the target on the plane - of - sky @xmath26 converted to pixels on the instrument plane , while the model is constructed in absolute ( km ) size , so the model / profile scale conversion is given by the ao instrument s angular resolution and the distance between the target and the observer .",
    "the profile contour extraction procedure with wavelets ( as an average of several ao images obtained in a short time interval ) is described in @xcite",
    ".    in general , the resolution of the model must be somewhat lower than the apparent resolution of the ao images as the sparse profile samples will produce artificial features elsewhere in the model if a near - perfect profile fit is enforced ( even if the observed profile details were exactly right ) .",
    "the inverse problem has thus some ill - posedness at local scales starting near the profile resolution level , but the ill - posedness at more global scales , inherent to lightcurve data @xcite , is removed with ao profiles .",
    "the weight factor @xmath88 mostly takes care of this , and fine - tuning is obtained with @xmath243 for the smoothness constraint @xmath166 . for the examples here ,",
    "the weight of the inertia regularization function @xmath180 was low as there were several profiles available ; virtually the same result was achieved with @xmath244 .",
    "the weights @xmath88 and @xmath243 were determined with the scheme of section 4 ; the examined interval of @xmath243 was restricted to realistic values corresponding to the resolution level of the ao images .",
    "1 depicts a typical evaluation of the curve @xmath187 at various choices of @xmath88 ; or rather , this plot portrays the cross - section of the 2-surface @xmath188 in @xmath1 with @xmath243 fixed at its final optimal value .",
    "the values for @xmath192 are normalized to be the rms deviations of model fits @xmath245 , as in logarithmic scale this corresponds only to a shift of origin and a uniform linear change of plot scaling .",
    "the plotted points outline the curve @xmath200 that is rather an oblique line than an l - shape , and the ideal point region , i.e. , the point closest to the lower left - hand corner , can directly be found .",
    "the endpoints @xmath204 and @xmath205 stop at saturation regions rather than continue to large distances in the @xmath246-space . as can be seen from fig .  1 , computational noise in the estimated points at @xmath204 and @xmath205 , corresponding to a small change of the position of the new origin w.r.t .",
    "@xmath187 , does not affect the estimated location of the optimal point on @xmath187 significantly .",
    "sample observed vs.  modelled profiles for 2 pallas and 41 daphne are shown in figs .  2 and 3 .",
    "the starlike surface model was described by the exponential laplace ( spherical harmonics ) series for the surface radius @xmath163 @xcite r(,)= , ( , ) s^2 , truncated at suitable @xmath247 , with @xmath248 as the shape parameters to be solved for .",
    "other model parameters are the profile offset @xmath109 for each image and the spin parameters . for asteroid 2 pallas ( a rather spherical body with size class 500 km )",
    ", the laplace series was truncated at maximal @xmath249 , while for the more irregular 41 daphne ( size class 200 km ) the truncation point @xmath250 was more appropriate . the early truncated laplace series and the choice of the truncation point are implicit regularization measures as such .",
    "we leave the discussion of the choice of model discretization level elsewhere ( cf .  @xcite ) as here its effect on the data mode weighting was negligible ( within a feasible set of choices ) , and the resolution level of ao images ( as well as keeping @xmath243 low and avoiding artificial surface features ) essentially determined the choice in practice after some sampling . for ao data , the choice of the laplace series as a model is practical , while for , e.g. , detailed space probe data a mesh of independent surface points is more accurate and computationally feasible .        once the weight factors @xmath88 and @xmath243 are determined , the result is usually stable and restricted to one region in the parameter space @xmath191 : probing feasible solutions @xmath158 corresponding to @xmath251 slightly lower than @xmath252 produces essentially the same results . due to restricted orbital geometries ,",
    "lightcurve data alone often imply two almost equally possible pole directions with mirror - like shape solutions @xcite ; even one ao ( or other ) image usually resolves this typical ambiguity @xcite .",
    "the result is also typically stable w.r.t .",
    "weights in the vicinity of mcw .",
    "the obtained mce appears to be well justified when one samples the solutions along @xmath187 : it provides a very good match to profile details without straying far from the observed lightcurves , and does not predict too prominent features on the parts of the surface not projected onto the profile contours .",
    "we have examined the classes of shapes reconstructable by the ( generalized ) profiles of objects in @xmath1 , and presented a method for using lightcurves and the observed contours of generalized profiles simultaneously to produce shape ( and spin ) models with more details ( and a lower degree of ill - posedness ) than in the pure lightcurve mode .",
    "we have also shown that there is a well - justified criterion and an efficient method for determining the optimal weighting of data modes . applied to real data",
    ", the method works very well , and we can use simple regularization functions .",
    "in addition to adaptive optics observations , asteroid profiles can also be obtained from other sources such as interferometry , space telescopes , and stellar occultations ( partial profiles ) .",
    "the use of profiles is practical as it removes two sources of systematic errors inherent to using full images ( brightness distributions @xmath7 on the image plane ) : the errors in @xmath7 from ao deconvolution and the model @xmath7 errors due to the insufficently modellable light - scattering properties of the surface of the target body . on the other hand ,",
    "profile determination requires the data to be sharp enough , not with fuzzy images .",
    "if the images are fuzzy , we usually have to resort to using some brightness and blurring model for fitting full images , even though the result will be less certain .",
    "the concept of the maximum compatibility estimate is directly applicable to any inverse problems with complementary data modes .",
    "the invariance properties of the mce make it more generally usable than heuristic strategies for choosing the weights , especially when they use assumptions on the shape of @xmath188 or other case - specific characteristics .",
