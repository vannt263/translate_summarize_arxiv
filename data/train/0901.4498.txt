    "frustrated spin systems represent one of the actively developing topics in solid state physics .",
    "the vast interest in magnetic frustration originates from a number of unusual phenomena ( spin - liquid ground state,@xcite the formation of supersolid phases in high magnetic fields,@xcite etc . )",
    "suggested by theory .",
    "the theoretical predictions challenge the experiment that , however , requires proper frustrated materials .",
    "the search for the respective compounds has been a long story in inorganic chemistry,@xcite and the problem turned out to be quite complex . to meet the theoretical predictions ,",
    "one has to find a material that reveals frustrated geometry of magnetic atoms and presents spin degrees of freedom only to avoid any foreign effects ( e.g. , orbital ordering ) tending to lift the frustration .",
    "a number of frustrated spin models still lack the proper realizations , especially for the case of spin-1/2 , where the strongest quantum effects and the most interesting phenomena are expected . for other models ,",
    "few appropriate materials are known and extensively studied .",
    "for example , the mineral herbertsmithite zncu@xmath12(oh)@xmath13cl@xmath14 was recently proposed as a spin-1/2 kagom material.@xcite however , the actual physics of this compound is still debated due to the cu / zn antisite disorder and the presence of non - magnetic sites within the kagom layers.@xcite other natural kagom materials  minerals kapellasite and haydeeite  are proposed .",
    "their structures do not suffer from the disorder effects , but the pure kagom physics is again modified due to the non - negligible interactions beyond nearest neighbors.@xcite    clearly , the task of finding an ideal frustrated material is hardly solvable at all .",
    "therefore , it is instructive to examine which deviations from the ideal spin model may be allowed and , to a certain extent , do not qualitatively modify the properties of this model . considering structural distortions and",
    "the resulting spin lattice distortions is especially attractive , since lots of known materials have low symmetry in contrast to the high geometrical symmetry of the most theoretically studied frustrated spin models .",
    "the major part of the frustrated magnetic materials are the so - called geometrically frustrated magnets . in these systems ,",
    "the frustration arises due to the competition of equivalent exchange couplings : in the most simple case , antiferromagnetic ( afm ) couplings on a triangle .",
    "then , any structural distortion should inevitably reduce this competition hence reducing the frustration . in the other group of the frustrated materials ,",
    "the competing interactions are inequivalent but their topology and magnitudes can be tuned so that the strong quantum fluctuations destroy the long - range ordering , similar to the geometrically frustrated magnets .",
    "the latter group looks more favorable to tolerate the structural distortions , since the modification of the spin lattice can probably be balanced by the ratios of the competing interactions hence preserving the strong frustration . to study this issue in more detail , we focus on a specific model  spin-1/2 frustrated square lattice ( fsl )  and consider a number of recently proposed fsl materials .    the ideal ( regular ) fsl model assumes two competing interactions : the nearest - neighbor ( nn ) interaction @xmath2 running along the side of the square and the next - nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) interaction @xmath4 running along the diagonal of the square ( see the inset of fig .  [ fig_diagram ] ) . the phase diagram ( fig .",
    "[ fig_diagram ] ) reveals three ordered phases ( ferromagnet , nel antiferromagnet , and columnar antiferromagnet ) and two critical regions around @xmath15 , where a spin - liquid ground state is expected.@xcite recent theoretical studies also considered the extended model with inequivalent nn couplings @xmath2 and @xmath3 ( refs .  ) .",
    "this spatial anisotropy tends to narrow the critical region@xcite and to destroy it completely at a certain value of @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , the distortion is not favorable for the frustration , but the specific geometry of the lattice enables to preserve the strong frustration and the resulting critical region at moderate distortion .",
    "below ( sec .  [ simulation ] ) , we will show that the anisotropy of the nnn couplings on the square lattice should have an even weaker ( and , likely , opposite ) effect on the frustration .",
    "( color online ) phase diagram of the fsl model@xcite and the respective model compounds ( see text for references ) .",
    "the inset shows the regular fsl with the nn ( @xmath2 ) and nnn ( @xmath4 ) couplings denoted by solid and dashed lines , respectively . ]",
    "experimental studies of the fsl systems have utilized a number of model compounds .",
    "first reports focused on li@xmath14voxo@xmath16 ( x = si , ge ) materials that lay far away from the critical regions and did not show any specific properties caused by the frustration.@xcite later on , the vanadyl molybdate vomoo@xmath16 was found to reveal unusual structural changes upon cooling , and this effect was tentatively ascribed to the magnetic frustration despite the frustration ratio @xmath17 was quite small ( likely , @xmath18).@xcite the region of ferromagnetic ( fm ) @xmath2  afm @xmath4 was accessed by studying the layered vanadium phosphate pb@xmath14vo(po@xmath1 ( refs .  ) and the related aa@xmath0vo(po@xmath1 compounds with aa@xmath0 = srzn and bazn.@xcite quite recently , we proposed two more compounds , pbvo@xmath12 ( refs .   and ) and bacdvo(po@xmath1 ( ref .  ) , that lay very close to the critical regions at @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "interestingly , the latter material lacks the tetragonal symmetry and reveals a distorted fsl .",
    "nevertheless , we succeeded to observe two effects predicted for the regular fsl : the suppression of the specific heat maximum@xcite and the pronounced bending of the magnetization curve.@xcite    in other systems , the problem of the spin lattice distortion may also be crucial .",
    "the layered copper oxychloride ( cucl)lanb@xmath14o@xmath21 was recently proposed as a promising fsl material , lacking long - range magnetic order.@xcite however , careful studies indicated the structural distortion@xcite that completely changed the underlying spin model and precluded from any interpretations within the fsl framework.@xcite thus , it is important to understand whether the fsl model can be applied to bacdvo(po@xmath1 and , more generally , to the low - symmetry materials .",
    "below , we study this issue in detail , discuss the whole family of the aa@xmath0vo(po@xmath1 compounds ( hereinafter , we imply that aa@xmath0 = pb@xmath14 , srzn , bazn , and bacd ) , and provide quantitative estimates for the spin lattice distortion .",
    "our approach combines several computational methods ( band structure calculations , subsequent analysis of the exchange couplings , and model simulations ) in order to analyze magnetic interactions in these systems , derive the proper spin model , and facilitate the comparison with the experimental data .",
    "we show that the structural distortion in the aa@xmath0vo(po@xmath1 compounds is a minor effect as compared to the frustration , and the fsl description holds .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "we start with an analysis of the crystal structures in sec .",
    "[ structure ] and review the computational methods employed in our work ( sec .",
    "[ methods ] ) . then",
    ", we address several problems : ( i ) the realistic spin model and the magnitude of the distortion ( sec .",
    "[ distortion ] ) ; ( ii ) structural factors that influence the distortion of the spin lattice ( sec .",
    "[ factors ] ) ; and ( iii ) thermodynamic properties of the extended model ( sec .  [ simulation ] ) . in sec .",
    "[ discussion ] , we discuss the results of our study that suggests an accurate ( and , within the heisenberg model , exact ) way to treat the fsl - like spin systems of the aa@xmath0vo(po@xmath1 phosphates .",
    "we also present a more general recipe for finding strongly frustrated square lattices in the compounds with similar topology of the magnetic layer , being generic for most of the fsl materials .",
    "finally , we show how the distortion of the square lattice affects thermodynamic properties of the model and the magnitude of the frustration .",
    "most of the vanadium - based fsl compounds reported so far reveal similar [ voxo@xmath16 ] magnetic layers .",
    "these layers are built of vo@xmath23 pyramids and xo@xmath16 tetrahedra ( see left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig_layer ] ) with x being a non - magnetic cation ( p , si , ge , or mo@xmath24 ) . the connections via the tetrahedra provide superexchange pathways for both nn and nnn couplings .",
    "vanadium atoms have the steady oxidation state of + 4 ( implying the electronic configuration @xmath25 and spin-1/2 ) , while the valence of the x cation can be changed and controls the filling of the interlayer space .",
    "thus , the interlayer space is empty in vomoo@xmath16 ( ref .  ) , filled by lithium atoms in li@xmath14voxo@xmath16 ( x = si , ge)@xcite and filled by complex interlayer [ aa@xmath0po@xmath16 ] blocks in the aa@xmath0vo(po@xmath1 phosphates.@xcite the magnetic layer is compatible with the tetragonal symmetry , hence the fsl model can be realized . yet",
    "the overall symmetry of the structure is sometimes reduced due to the complex configuration of the interlayer block , and this is the case for the aa@xmath0vo(po@xmath1 compounds .",
    "the crystal structure of the aa@xmath0vo(po@xmath1 phosphates ( fig .  [ fig_layer ] ) is fairly flexible with respect to the accommodation of different divalent metal cations a and a@xmath0 in the interlayer block .",
    "most of the compounds combine a larger ( ba or sr ) and a smaller ( cd or zn ) cation , yielding the orthorhombic symmetry of the structure ( space group @xmath26).@xcite yet it is also possible to use the same cation ( pb ) for a and a@xmath0 , and the resulting structure has monoclinic symmetry ( space group @xmath27).@xcite different symmetries produce slightly different geometries of the magnetic [ vopo@xmath16 ] layers , hence different types of the spin lattice distortion should be expected . in the following ,",
    "we will focus on the magnetic layer typical for the orthorhombic aa@xmath0vo(po@xmath1 compounds with different a and a@xmath0 ( fig .",
    "[ fig_layer ] ) . to ease the comparison to monoclinic pb@xmath14vo(po@xmath1",
    ", one should convert the crystal structure@xcite to the non - standard setting @xmath28 with @xmath29 being the monoclinic axis ( in this setting , the layer corresponds to one shown in fig .  [ fig_layer ] ) .",
    "basically , the whole discussion of the spin lattice distortion is applicable to pb@xmath14vo(po@xmath1 , but due to the lower lattice symmetry this compound has one additional feature : two inequivalent nn couplings along the @xmath30 axis .",
    "however , our estimates show that these couplings nearly match .",
    "therefore , the spin system of pb@xmath14vo(po@xmath1 can be adequately described with four parameters similar to the other aa@xmath0vo(po@xmath1 compounds .",
    ".[tab_experiment ] experimental exchange couplings ( @xmath31 ) evaluated within the regular fsl model and the resulting frustration ratios in the aa@xmath0vo(po@xmath1 compounds [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the lack of the tetragonal symmetry in the aa@xmath0vo(po@xmath1 phosphates gives rise to four different interactions in the magnetic [ vopo@xmath16 ] layers . according to fig .",
    "[ fig_layer ] , we label the nn interactions as @xmath2 , @xmath3 and the nnn interactions as @xmath32 .",
    "previous experimental works implicitly assumed the ideal fsl model with @xmath33 and @xmath34 as a natural , albeit therein unjustified , approximation.@xcite in the previous studies , experimental data on the magnetic susceptibility and the specific heat were fitted with high - temperature series expansions ( htse ) for the regular fsl@xcite to yield the effective couplings @xmath35 and @xmath36 ( table  [ tab_experiment ] ) .",
    "the fm @xmath2 ",
    "afm @xmath4 regime of the fsl was further supported by analyzing field dependence of the magnetization of bacdvo(po@xmath1 ( ref .  ) and the ground states of pb@xmath14vo(po@xmath1 and srznvo(po@xmath1 ( refs .   and  ) .    within the phenomenological approach ,",
    "the consistent interpretation of the experimental results justifies a posteriori the application of the ideal fsl model to the aa@xmath0vo(po@xmath1 compounds .",
    "of course , a microscopic approach requires a more careful consideration of all the four inequivalent exchange couplings in the magnetic [ vopo@xmath16 ] layers .",
    "however , it is quite difficult ( at least , experimentally ) to go beyond the regular fsl description due to the lack of theoretical results for the extended @xmath37 model . in the following ,",
    "we address the problem using computational methods .",
    "these methods are known to provide a reliable microscopic description of complex spin systems , including the fsl compounds li@xmath14voxo@xmath16 ( refs .   and ) .",
    "yet we also refer to the phenomenological results and show that at sufficiently high temperatures the distorted fsl can be considered as a regular fsl with effective , averaged nn and nnn couplings .",
    "scalar - relativistic band structure calculations were performed within the full - potential local - orbital scheme ( fplo7.00 - 27),@xcite and the exchange - correlation potential by perdew and wang@xcite was applied .",
    "our calculations employed experimental crystal structures and a number of modified and model structures , as described below .",
    "different @xmath38-meshes were used depending on the size and the geometry the unit cell . in all the calculations , the convergence with respect to the @xmath38-mesh",
    "was carefully checked .    to evaluate the exchange couplings in the aa@xmath0vo(po@xmath1 compounds , we use two different approaches .",
    "first , local density approximation ( lda ) calculations are performed .",
    "these calculations enable to select relevant states and to estimate hopping parameters ( @xmath39 ) for the respective bands by fitting these bands with a tight - binding ( tb ) model .",
    "the lda calculations fail to reproduce the strong correlation effects in the vanadium @xmath40 shell ; therefore , the correlations are included on a model level .",
    "the hoppings are introduced to an extended hubbard model with the effective on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath41 ev ( this value is representative for vanadium oxides , see refs .  , , , and ) .",
    "the strongly correlated limit @xmath42 and the half - filling regime justify the reduction to the heisenberg model for the low - lying excitations .",
    "then , afm contributions to the exchange couplings are estimated as @xmath43 . within this approach , all the possible afm couplings are evaluated .",
    "second , we consider the correlation effects within the self - consistent calculations and employ the local spin density approximation ( lsda)+@xmath44 method .",
    "total energies for a number of ordered spin configurations are mapped onto the classical heisenberg model to yield the estimates for both fm and afm couplings , hence supplementing the tb analysis .",
    "lsda+@xmath44 treats correlation effects in a mean - field approximation and uses two input parameters , @xmath45 and @xmath46 , to describe the on - site coulomb repulsion and the intraatomic exchange , respectively . since the exchange parameter has minor influence on the results , we fix @xmath47 ev as a representative value .",
    "yet the choice of the repulsion parameter @xmath45 may be crucial , especially in case the exchange couplings are weak ( see ref .",
    "for an instructive example ) . to reduce the ambiguity related to the choice of @xmath45 , we thoroughly compare the computational results with the experimental data , as further discussed in sec .",
    "[ distortion ] .",
    "the lda calculations employed the full symmetry of the crystal structures , 112-atom orthorhombic unit cells , and the @xmath38-mesh of 256 @xmath38-points with 75 points in the irreducible part of the first brillouine zone ( ibz ) . in case of pb@xmath14vo(po@xmath1",
    ", the 56-atom monoclinic unit cell and a mesh of 512 @xmath38-points ( 170 in ibz ) were used .    to realize different spin orderings within the lsda+@xmath44 calculations",
    ", one has to reduce the crystal symmetry and , in some cases , to extend the unit cell .",
    "the evaluation of the four exchange couplings in the aa@xmath0vo(po@xmath1 compounds requires the doubling of the unit cell in the @xmath29 direction , hence 224-atom unit cells should be constructed . for such unit cells ,",
    "full - potential calculations are extremely time - consuming and , likely , not accurate enough for a reliable evaluation of the rather small exchange constants.@xcite therefore , in our lsda+@xmath44 calculations we simplify the crystal structures of the aa@xmath0vo(po@xmath1 compounds and construct a number of modified structures .",
    "the idea resembles our study of ag@xmath14vop@xmath14o@xmath21 ( ref .  ):",
    "the leading magnetic interactions take place in the layers , hence it is essential to use the correct geometry of the layer , while the stacking of the layers and the filling of the interlayer space have minor effect on the leading exchange couplings .    to build the simplified structures of the aa@xmath0vo(po@xmath1 compounds , we keep the exact geometry of the [ vopo@xmath16 ] layers , stack these layers one onto another , and fill the interlayer space with lithium atoms , providing the proper charge balance .",
    "the resulting composition is livopo@xmath16 .",
    "the interlayer separation is fixed at 6.5 a to achieve realistic , sufficiently weak interlayer hoppings ( below 2  mev ) . to justify the structure simplification",
    ", we perform the tb analysis .",
    "the difference between the respective hoppings in the experimental and modified structures does not exceed 5  % , implying an error below 10  % for the exchange couplings .",
    "such an error is definitely acceptable for the further lsda+@xmath44 calculations .",
    "basically , the structure simplification provides a promising computational approach to the magnetic properties of low - dimensional spin systems with complex crystal structures . in our lsda+@xmath44 calculations , we use 64-atom supercells [ @xmath48 a ) ] with triclinic symmetry ( space group @xmath49 ) and a mesh of 108 @xmath38-points .",
    "finally , we also performed a number of lda calculations for model structures in order to study the influence of individual structural changes on the spin lattice distortion .",
    "the model structures were built similar to the simplified structures described above .",
    "the initial geometry was taken from the structure of @xmath50-livopo@xmath16 that includes regular [ vopo@xmath16 ] layers separated by li cations.@xcite then , we introduced a number of structural distortions and checked the changes of the exchange couplings ( see sec .",
    "[ factors ] for details ) .",
    "the initial structure reveals a rather low interlayer separation of 4.45 a and yields sizable interlayer interactions . to reduce the interlayer interactions and to properly emulate the two - dimensional ( 2d ) character of the fsl compounds",
    ", we increased the interlayer spacing up to 6.5 a. we also reduced the symmetry down to the orthorhombic space group @xmath51 ( @xmath52 in the standard setting ) that allowed the distortions of the [ vopo@xmath16 ] layer .",
    "a @xmath38-mesh of 4096 points ( 729 in the ibz ) was used .",
    "full diagonalization ( fd ) simulations were performed for the @xmath53 cluster using the alps simulation package.@xcite basic thermodynamic quantities ( magnetic susceptibility and specific heat ) were evaluated by an internal procedure of the program .",
    "in general , the fd simulations suffer from finite - size effects , because current computational facilities do not allow to perform the calculations for large clusters . the presently available cluster size ( normally , 16 or 20 sites )",
    "is sufficient to obtain the quantitatively correct information on thermodynamic properties of one - dimensional spin systems only .",
    "the accuracy of the fd simulations for two - dimensional systems is challenged by the experimental data and the results of other simulation techniques.@xcite yet , the fd simulations are able to provide qualitatively correct trends upon the change of the model parameters ( e.g. , the change of the frustration ratio in the fsl , see ref .  ) . keeping in mind these considerations , we restrict ourselves to the analysis of the relative changes in the thermodynamic properties , as the spin lattice is distorted .",
    "investigation of the ground state and quantitative simulation of thermodynamic properties for the extended fsl model are clearly beyond the scope of the present paper that intends to stimulate further studies of the problem .",
    "in this section , we consider the band structures of the aa@xmath0vo(po@xmath1 compounds and evaluate individual exchange couplings .",
    "the lda density of states ( dos ) for bacdvo(po@xmath1 is shown in fig .",

    "this plot is representative for the whole family of the aa@xmath0vo(po@xmath1 materials .",
    "the electronic structure resembles that of other vanadium phosphates.@xcite the states below @xmath54 ev are mainly formed by oxygen orbitals , while the states close to the fermi level reveal predominant vanadium contribution .",
    "the vanadium bands are rather narrow and show @xmath40-related crystal field levels ( see the inset of fig .",

    "the lda energy spectrum is metallic in contradiction to the experimental green or yellow - green color that indicates insulating behavior .",
    "the lack of the energy gap is a typical failure of lda due to the underestimate of strong electron correlations in the @xmath40 shell . applying lsda+@xmath44 , we find insulating spectra with an energy gap of @xmath59 ev depending on the @xmath45 value .",

    "the trends presented in fig .  [ fig_simulation ] suggest that the distortion of the nnn bonds enhances quantum fluctuations ( see the explanation below ) , while the distortion of the nn bonds reduces the fluctuations , and the latter effect is more pronounced .",
    "the effect of the nn bonds distortion is consistent with the previous theoretical results for the spatially anisotropic fsl model.@xcite the narrowing and closing of the critical ( spin - liquid ) region corresponds to the reduction of the quantum fluctuations , as observed in the thermodynamic data .",

    "this conclusion is consistent with the relatively weak effect of the nnn bonds distortion .",

    "although detailed investigation of the ground state of the extended fsl model lies beyond the scope of the present study , the introduction to the extended model and the evaluation of the model parameters is a first step toward understanding the ground state of aa@xmath0vo(po@xmath1 .",
