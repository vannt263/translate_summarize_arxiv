    "a number of high - energy theories of fundamental physics are formulated in higher - dimensional spacetimes . in particular , the idea of extra dimensions has been used in supergravity and superstring theories .",
    "two types of models with extra dimensions were discussed in the literature .",

    ", the standard model fields are localized on a 3-dimensional hypersurface ( brane ) and the extra dimensions are accessable for the gravitational and for some additional hypothetical fields .",
    "these models provide a solution to the hierarchy problem between the gravitational and electroweak mass scales @xcite .",
    "the main idea to resolve the large hierarchy is that the small coupling of four dimensional gravity is generated by the large physical volume of extra dimensions .",
    "these theories provide a novel setting for discussing phenomenological and cosmological issues related to extra dimensions .    in both types of models with extra dimensions",
    "the boundary conditions imposed on possible field configurations change the spectrum of the vacuum fluctuations and lead to the casimir - type contributions to the vacuum expectation values of physical observables .",
    "the casimir effect ( for a review see ref . ) has been used as a stabilization mechanism for moduli fields parametrizing the size of the extra dimensions .",
    "the casimir energy coming from the extra dimensions can also serve as a model for dark energy ( see ref .   and references therein ) .",
    "in the first part of the present talk , based on refs .  , we describe the effects of the toroidal compactification of spatial dimensions in de sitter ( ds ) spacetime on the properties of quantum vacuum for a scalar field with general curvature coupling parameter .",
