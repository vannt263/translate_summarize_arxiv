    "the scalar potential of the flat directions vanishes in the supersymmetry ( susy ) limit , and is lifted by susy breaking effects and higher order operators .",
    "it is well known that the @xmath0 balls form during the course of the affleck - dine baryogenesis @xcite . in particular , @xmath0 balls with large enough charge @xmath0 are stable against the decay into baryons ( nucleons ) in the gauge - mediated susy breaking .",
    "ball is small enough , the lightest susy particles , such as the gravitino @xcite or the axino@xcite , decayed from the @xmath0 ball , may be the dark matter , while the baryons are produced by the @xmath0-ball decay as well . ] in this case , @xmath0 balls would be dark matter of the universe , and could be detectable .",
    "the baryon asymmetry of the universe is explained by the baryon numbers that are not remained inside the @xmath0 balls .",
    "it has been considered that the single flat direction transforms into dark matter @xmath0 balls , and the baryon numbers are emitted through the @xmath0-ball surface in the thermal bath of the universe @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , this simple scenario is observationally excluded @xcite",
    ".    however it is natural to consider more than one direction which take part in the affleck - dine mechanism .",
    "there are at most 29 complex degrees of freedom for @xmath1-flat and renormalizable @xmath2-flat directions which do not involve higgs field @xcite .",
    "most of the directions are lifted by @xmath3 nonrenormalizable superpotential of the form @xmath4 , which applies to the even @xmath5 case , where @xmath6 is the field of a flat direction . for the odd @xmath5 case ,",

    "it could be originated from gravitational waves produced during inflation , which leads to the large tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath13 and the large hubble parameter during inflation @xmath14  gev .",
    "in such high - scale inflation , in general , large baryonic isocurvature fluctuations will be induced in the affleck - dine mechanism @xcite . in order to suppress isocurvature fluctuations sufficiently",

    "this is usually realized by the so - called negative hubble - induced mass term @xcite @xmath37 which stems from the susy breaking effect by the finite inflaton energy density . here",
    "@xmath38 is the hubble parameter , and @xmath39 is a constant of @xmath40 . during inflation",
    "the flat direction stays at the minimum determined by the balance of @xmath41 and @xmath42 : @xmath43 well after inflation when the hubble parameter decreases as large as @xmath44 , the field begins oscillations .",
    "the field actually rotates due to the usual soft @xmath45 terms , and the baryon number of the universe is created .",

    "during high - scale inflation the flat direction acquires quantum fluctuations along the phase direction if there is no sizable @xmath45 terms , and it may lead to too large baryonic and cdm isocurvature fluctuations in this case . actually , the hubble - induced @xmath45 terms do not appear for most inflation models in supergravity @xcite .",
    "the amplitude of the baryonic isocurvature fluctuations can be estimated as @xmath50 on the other hand , observational upper bound is calculated as @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are respectively the primordial isocurvature fraction and the amplitude of the curvature power spectrum obtained in the planck results @xcite .",

    "it might be at most @xmath55 times larger than eq.([phiinf ] ) for @xmath56 . ]",
    "@xmath57 thus the field should stay at around @xmath58 during inflation in order to have small enough isocurvature fluctuations .",
    "this can be achieved for small enough @xmath19 : @xmath59 here and hereafter , @xmath60 means that we evaluate values for @xmath3 . moreover , if the amplitude of the flat direction is as large as @xmath58 during inflation , the terms such as @xmath61 would come from a nonminimal khler potential of the form @xmath62 ( the @xmath2 term of the @xmath63 field is responsible for inflation ) and results in the mass scale of @xmath64 for the phase direction @xcite , which further suppresses the isocurvature fluctuations .",
    "therefore , we adopt @xmath65 , and investigate the scenario that the gauge - mediation type @xmath0 balls from one flat direction decay into baryons , while another direction forms new - type @xmath0 balls to be dark matter of the universe in this situation .",
    "the @xmath0-ball solution exists in those potential that are flatter than @xmath66 , which is the case for susy . in the gauge - mediated susy breaking there exist two types of the @xmath0 ball .",
    "one is the gauge - mediation type @xcite , and the other is the new type @xcite .",
    "the former forms when the potential is dominated by @xmath32 when the field starts oscillations and fragments into lumps .",

    "the charge of the new - type @xmath0 ball is given by @xcite @xmath79 where @xmath80 @xcite .",
    "the properties of the new - type @xmath0 ball are as follows : @xmath81    the charge @xmath0 is in fact the @xmath17-number , and relates to the baryon number of the @xmath0 ball as @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the baryon number of @xmath17-particle . for example , @xmath84 for the @xmath85 direction .",
    "the @xmath0 ball is stable against the decay into nucleons for large field amplitude when the charge is very large .",
    "since @xmath76 corresponds to the effective mass of the field inside the @xmath0 ball , the stability condition is given by @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the mass of the decay particles .",
    "the new - type q ball is generally stable against the decay into nucleons , except for the gravitino mass larger than that of nucleons . on the other hand ,",
    "the gauge - mediation type @xmath0 ball is stable for @xmath88 , where @xmath89 with @xmath90 being the nucleon mass .",
    "since we need unstable @xmath0 ball to produce the baryon number of the universe , we consider the gauge - mediation type @xmath0 ball with the charge smaller than @xmath91 .",
    "the unstable gauge - mediation type @xmath0 ball decays into baryons through its surface  @xcite .- ball decay is many orders of magnitude smaller than the bbn bound in our successful scenario . ]",
    "the decay rate is reestimated in refs.@xcite as @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the number of the decay quarks .",
    "then the temperature at the decay is obtained as @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the relativistic degrees of freedom at the decay time .",
    "since the decay must take place before the bbn , the charge of the gauge - mediation type @xmath0 ball has the upper limit .",
    "we consider two @xmath3 flat directions with different values of @xmath19 . the direction with smaller @xmath19 forms the new - type @xmath0 balls to be the dark matter of the universe , while that with larger @xmath19 becomes the unstable gauge - mediation type @xmath0 balls to produce baryon asymmetry in the universe .",
    "the fields starts their oscillations when the hubble - induced mass term @xmath41 becomes smaller than @xmath96 .",
    "the amplitudes at the onset of oscillations are thus calculated as @xmath97 for the gauge - mediation type and the new type , respectively .",
    "therefore , the charges of both types of the @xmath0 balls are obtained as @xmath98    since all the charges ( the baryon numbers ) are released by the decay of the gauge - mediation type @xmath0 balls , the baryon number is given by @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the reheating temperature after inflation . in this @xmath3 case , @xmath100 is independent of @xmath28 and solely determined by @xmath48 as @xmath101 at the same time , the dark matter is composed by stable new - type @xmath0 balls . their abundance is estimated as @xmath102 which is rewritten as @xmath103 we must have @xmath104 in order to have right amount of the dark matter . for explaining both the baryon asymmetry and the dark matter of the universe , we have @xmath105 where we insert eqs.([trh ] ) and ( [ rhoqobs ] ) with @xmath3 into eq.([m32bdm ] ) .",
    "we call this the b - dm relation in the following .",
    "let us now investigate how the b - dm relation ( [ bdm ] ) is satisfied .",

    "the former condition is expressed , from eqs.([form - gauge ] ) and ( [ omegaqg ] ) , as @xmath111 with @xmath112 and @xmath113 being used .",
    "the latter condition comes from @xmath114  mev , which leads to @xmath115 for @xmath3 , from eqs.([td ] ) and ( [ form - gauge ] ) . since eqs.([cond - unst ] ) and ( [ cond - bbn ] ) have different dependences on @xmath48 , the latter gives more stringent constraint for @xmath116 .",
    "in addition , ( e ) the new - type @xmath0 ball must be stable to be the dark matter of the universe . from eq.([omegaqn ] ) , @xmath117 is nothing but the upper bound on the gravitino mass : @xmath118 there is also the condition ( [ mflimit ] ) .",
