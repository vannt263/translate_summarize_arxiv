    "the twin voyager space probes are currently exploring the distant heliosheath region and are expected to reach the heliospheric boundary , known as the heliopause , and pass into the surrounding interstellar space before the end of the decade . before crossing the heliopause , the voyagers are expected to enter a region of rapidly changing magnetic field which is a remnant of magnetic sectors separated by an oscillating heliospheric current sheet ( hcs ) . from global heliospheric simulations reported by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , it emerges that sectors become narrower as the solar wind plasma slows down as it nears the heliopause .",
    "it was suggested by @xcite that highly energetic charged particles , such as galactic cosmic ray ions , will be profoundly affected by the compressed sector structure in the heliosheath .",
    "charged particles find it much easier to travel across the sectors , and hence across the magnetic field , when the width of a sector is comparable to or smaller than their larmor radius ( rather than being much larger than the latter , as is typically the case in the solar wind ) .",
    "the enhanced cross - field transport process is a consequence of fast drift - like motion across the stack of magnetic sectors .",
    "voyager observations @xcite show no regular magnetic sector pattern in the distant solar wind , a trend that appears to persist into the heliosheath @xcite . measured sector durations in the solar wind were , on average , shorter than 13 days expected from a simple two - sector pattern implying a significant distortion of the shape of the hcs .",
    "the widths of magnetic sectors reported by @xcite varied by almost a factor of 10 and had a sufficiently broad distribution .",
    "@xcite only reported sectors observed during three years near the maximum of solar activity . close to solar minima magnetic sectors occupy only a narrow range of heliolatitudes .",
    "they were not observed by the voyagers during the pre - termination shock part of the mission when the spacecraft was above ( v1 ) or below ( v2 ) the current sheet .",
    "the situation changes dramatically in the heliosheath . here",
    "the flow is deflected away from the radial direction @xcite stretching the hcs in latitude and longitude @xcite . in the hemisphere facing the interstellar flow the sector structure is expected to exist at all latitudes deep into the heliosheath .",
    "it is then of great importance to understand the effect of the tightly folded current sheet on energetic particles , such as galactic cosmic rays .",
    "it was proposed in @xcite that variability in sector width results in an enhanced cross - field diffusion of galactic cosmic rays with a larmor radius greater than about 0.1 au .",
    "the process could well be responsible for very high intensities of galactic helium ions measured by voyager 1 , intensities that are presently ( 20112012 ) near or in excess of the predicted interstellar values @xcite .",
    "@xcite used a simple , one - dimensional sector model that did not take into account variations in the shape of current sheets .",
    "the present paper reports a much more complete , two - dimensional model of particle transport near a rapidly oscillating hcs .",
    "here we assume that the sector width in the distant heliosheath varies about a well defined mean , and that the variation occurs as a result of differential ( variable in latitude ) current sheet displacement in the radial direction .",
    "this work therefore builds upon the ideas proposed in @xcite to develop a _ quantitative _ model of cosmic - ray transport in a sectored magnetic field of the distant heliosheath .",
    "it is noteworthy that a partially related concept was proposed much earlier as a mechanism of interstellar dust grain transport in the solar wind @xcite .",
    "high rigidity and small velocity of dust grains makes their transport qualitatively different from that of cosmic rays .",
    "dust particles larger than about 0.01",
    "@xmath0 m have gyroradii comparable to the size of the heliosphere and their trajectories are only mildly perturbed by the sector structure in the solar wind .",
    "these slowly moving particles acquire a velocity component perpendicular to the interplanetary magnetic field and parallel to the sectors as a result of the motional electric field in the frame of the particle .",
    "random variations in sector duration then lead to a diffusion in pitch angle . for galactic cosmic rays with their high velocities",
    "this effect is negligible , and the principal mode of transport is drift associated with the current sheet crossings .    the paper is structured as follows . in section 2",
    "we discuss the fundamental physics of particle drift in a sectored magnetic field . in section 3",
    "we investigate cosmic ray transport through a stack of magnetic sectors with a test - particle orbit integration method commonly used to simulate scattering and cross - field transport in turbulent magnetic fields ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we demonstrate that particle transport in a magnetic field composed of variable - width sectors of alternating polarity is diffusive both parallel to and across the current sheets .",
    "the results from this study are reported in section 4 .",
    "these results reveal the dependence of the diffusion coefficients on the distribution of sector widths and on the cosmic - ray energy .",
    "finally , section 5 explores some consequences of the new diffusion mechanism for cosmic - ray propagation through the heliosheath .",
    "consider an energetic charged particle , such as a galactic cosmic ray ion placed in a magnetic field that has the same magnitude everywhere , but can change sign .",
    "a change of sign occurs across a neutral sheet with negligible thickness ( i.e. , thickness much smaller than the larmor radius of the energetic particle ) .",
    "it is well known that in the absence of a large - scale plasma flow , the particle can either gyrate in place ( ignoring the motion along the magnetic field , which is of no interest here ) , or undergo a meandering motion ( drift ) along a single current sheet .",
    "when the sectors become squeezed together , as one expects will happen on approach to the heliopause , the distance between adjacent neutral sheet folds would become comparable or smaller than the cosmic ray cyclotron radius @xmath1 , which is typically between 0.05 and 0.3 au in the heliosheath .",
    "the slowly moving heliosheath plasma is thought to be nearly incompressible , which appears to be consistent with voyager 2 results @xcite .",
    "the plasma is therefore not compressed , but follows different paths toward the tail ( spreads out in latitude and longitude ) .",
    "evidently , for primarily north - south flows the magnitude of the mean field need not increase because the decrease in the radial distance between field lines ( as the sectors become thinner ) is balanced by spreading of the field lines in latitude . for azimuthal flows , the magnitude of @xmath2 should increase because in that case plasma follows magnetic field lines .",
    "altogether , we expect the magnetic field to increase by a modest amount , so that the ratio of @xmath1 to the mean distance between sectors @xmath3 increases with heliocentric distance . at some distance , therefore , the critical condition @xmath4 will be satisfied .    to support our estimate",
    "we calculated the magnetic field and the mean sector width in the heliosheath as a function of radial distance from the sun using a three - dimensional model of the heliosphere that includes neutral hydrogen atoms @xcite . from this data we calculated the larmor radius @xmath1 for 20 , 200 , and",
    "2000 mev / n he@xmath5 ions as a function of heliocentric distance .",
    "figure [ fig_radial ] shows the radial dependence of @xmath3 and @xmath6 in the upwind ( nose ) direction . because of its blunt shape , the termination shock stand - off distance , marked by the dotted line , is smaller ( @xmath7 au ) than in the directions of voyager 1 and 2 .",
    "the model is steady - state and does not include dynamic solar wind structures , but is sufficient to illustrate our point .",
    "readers interested in the model boundary conditions for the solar wind and the local interstellar medium are referred to @xcite .    from the figure ,",
    "the gyro - radius does decrease with distance , but not as rapidly as the sector width . in the model",
    "the magnetic field magnitude increases from 0.15 nt to 0.5 nt between the termination shock and the heliopause , whereas the sector width decreases by nearly two orders of magnitude .",
    "the point of intersection between the solid and the dashed curves in figure [ fig_radial ] ( @xmath4 ) gives the approximate distance beyond which the effects of neutral shift diffusion become noticeable . for 200 mev / n ions",
    "this occurs about two - thirds of the way through , but only close to the heliopause for 20 mev / n and lower energy particles .    as discussed in @xcite , for @xmath8 there exist gyrophase angles for which meandering or gyrating particles are unable to complete their cycle before encountering a neighboring current sheet . at that point the particle s sense of rotation will change as its guiding center `` jumps '' across the sheet and into an adjacent sector .",
    "figure [ fig_drift ] shows a typical trajectory of an energetic particle in an ensemble of sectors of uniform width .",
    "the particle drifts in both @xmath9 and @xmath10 directions .",
    "however , unlike the former drift , it is easy to see by drawing a similar diagram for a different starting gyrophase , that drift across the magnetic boundaries can proceed in either direction ( to the left or to the right on the figure , depending on the gyrophase ) .",
    "it follows that the net drift velocity is zero for a gyrotropic ensemble of particles .",
    "however , the process itself may lead to a separation of an initially symmetric distribution into left- and right - going components .    despite the limitation ,",
    "the drift process discussed above could enhance the _ diffusive _ transport of energetic particles if the sector structure is not uniform .",
    "observations clearly show that the sector widths ( or duration , in terms of spacecraft measurements ) vary by a factor of @xmath11 in the outer heliosphere @xcite .",
    "this variability is presumably due to both an irregular magnetic field structure on the sun and the dynamic interaction between structures in the solar wind further distorting the shape of the hcs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "one expects the sector thickness to vary with both latitude and longitude ; we include only latitudinal variations in our two - dimensional model ( see below ) .",
    "the advantage of the present model is simplicity stemming from the assumption that the magnetic field varies in direction only , but not in magnitude ( this condition can not be maintained in the fully three - dimensional case ) .",
    "this allows us to focus on the fundamental physics of the diffusion process due to current sheet fluctuations , a feature that would otherwise be hidden underneath the complexity of a fully 3d simulation .    in the last part of this section we present a simple two - dimensional model , based on the boltzmann equation , that illustrates the qualitative features expected from closely packed alternating sectors . in this model ,",
    "the sector width is fixed and the randomness is provided by scattering centers embedded in the plasma . for the sake of brevity , we consider only the motion in the @xmath12 plane ( with the background magnetic field directed along @xmath13 ) , and disregard scattering in pitch angle , which would lead to quantitative modifications but would not change the robust qualitative features .",
    "we assume the pitch angle to be @xmath14 and consider scattering in gyrophase angle @xmath15 only .    as in figure [ fig_drift ]",
    "we take the distribution function of cosmic rays to be independent of @xmath9 . assuming that diffusion is a result of independent small - angle scattering in @xmath15 , the boltzmann equation for the phase space density @xmath16 can be written as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the gyro - frequency and @xmath19 is the mean scattering time .",
    "the velocity @xmath20 is the same for all particles .",
    "physically , @xmath21 is related to the quasi - linear fokker - planck coefficient @xmath22 that describes diffusion in gyrophase through resonant interactions with turbulent magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "the latter is a function of pitch - angle cosine @xmath0 and velocity @xmath20 ; since both are constant in our model , we accordingly take @xmath23 .    for a unipolar field pointing in the @xmath13 direction ( i.e. constant @xmath24 ) , eq .",
    "( 1 ) entertains the following steady - state solution @xmath25 implying that a steady gradient ( @xmath26 ) produces streaming @xmath27 in the @xmath28 and @xmath29 directions , respectively , consistently with the nominal diffusion coefficients of @xmath30 $ ] and @xmath31 .",
    "next , we place alternating sectors of widths @xmath32 and @xmath33 periodically in the @xmath34 plane .",
    "though the solution shown in eq .",
    "( 2 ) remains formally a solution , one should bear in mind that @xmath35 now becomes discontinuous at the current sheets , while the physical solution must be continuous .",
    "we note that an approach based on parker s equation @xcite can not be directly applied near current sheets because parker s equation does not include shear .",
    "its extension to include second - order terms shows that shear produces significant higher harmonics @xcite , which can not be neglected in our case .    to represent a large scale gradient , @xmath26",
    ", we assume a solution of the boltzmann equation ( 1 ) in the form : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is periodic in @xmath10 and is required to be continuous at the currents sheets . integrating eq .",
    "( 1 ) immediately yields a physically plausible result that streaming in the @xmath10 direction , @xmath38 , must be constant .",
    "the ratio of the computed @xmath39 represents the effective diffusion coefficient appropriate to this situation .",
    "we solve eq .",
    "( 1 ) numerically on a @xmath40 grid in @xmath10 and @xmath15 .",
    "numerical results presented here were all obtained with @xmath41 ( i.e. , @xmath42 ) .",
    "furthermore , we consider a symmetric arrangement with @xmath43 , as well as an asymmetric one with a dominant sector by choosing @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "figure [ fig_kj1 ] shows how the streaming @xmath38 changes if the sectors become narrower , i.e. , @xmath46 increases . because @xmath47 ( assuming a constant spatial gradient ) , the figure also shows the ratio between the cross - field diffusion coefficients with and without the sectors .",
    "the two curves refer to the symmetric and asymmetric arrangements , respectively . clearly , particle transport is significantly faster as the thickness of the sectors becomes comparable or smaller than the particle s gyro - radius , @xmath1 .",
    "the increase is larger in the symmetric case , when @xmath38 approaches the limiting case obtained without any background field ( @xmath48 ) , which is about a 25-fold increase for our parameters ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "for the asymmetric case the increase is slower .",
    "intuitively one can see that particles will sense the average @xmath24 , which implies a twofold decrease in @xmath49 , and a corresponding fourfold increase in @xmath38 relative to the unipolar case .",
    "figure [ fig_kj2 ] illustrates the spatial variation of the @xmath35 streaming component for the values of @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 within a single pair of sectors ( the complete solution is of course periodic in @xmath10 ) . for small",
    "@xmath46 the solution is close to the formal discontinuous solution , with a sharp transition occurring near the current sheet .",
    "we note that the directional distribution has significant higher order anisotropies in this region .",
    "@xmath35 decreases as @xmath46 increases .",
    "the right panel of figure [ fig_kj2 ] shows the asymmetric case , with one sector dominating .",
    "this case yields a remarkably large streaming in the @xmath9-direction in both sectors for @xmath51 .",
    "this seemingly counter - intuitive result can be readily understood recalling that multiplying eq .",
    "( 1 ) by @xmath53 and averaging over @xmath10 gives @xmath54 which means that large streaming in the @xmath10 direction implies large streaming in the @xmath9 direction as well , if one sector dominates .",
    "building upon the conceptual random sector thickness model introduced in @xcite , we now proceed to investigate the transport of energetic particles across a more realistic representation of magnetic sectors in the heliosheath using a test - particle computer code for orbit integration .",
    "measured plasma velocities are small in the distant heliosheath @xcite , and we ignore the background flow altogether . inside the sectors we assume that the magnetic field @xmath2 is constant in magnitude and points either in the @xmath55 or the @xmath56 directions , corresponding to the primarily azimuthal heliosheath magnetic field .",
    "the motion of a charged particle is unrestricted along the field , and we only consider their trajectories in the @xmath12 plane ( in other words , @xmath57 is an ignorable coordinate in the present model ) .    in the computer model used here particles",
    "are injected into a two - dimensional rectangular simulations box of size @xmath58 containing a few hundred alternating polarity sectors separated by current sheets ( which represent different segments of the same hcs ) .",
    "whereas a theoretical number of sectors in one 11-year solar cycle is about 150 , we use a larger number in the model to obtain a correct asymptotic behavior for large times .",
    "the current sheets are , on average , parallel to the @xmath34 plane , and their mean spacing along the @xmath10 ( radial ) direction is @xmath3 .",
    "we introduce perturbations to the form ( @xmath10-displacement ) of each current sheet according to @xmath59 where @xmath60 ( @xmath61 is the integer label enumerating the sheets ) , @xmath62 is the wavenumber of mode @xmath63 , @xmath64 is the random phase , and @xmath65 is the amplitude , related to the power spectrum of the fluctuations @xmath66 as ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "we use @xmath72 logarithmically equidistant modes separated by @xmath73 . for the heliosheath",
    "we assume that @xmath74 and @xmath75 , a difference of 3.2 orders of magnitude , with @xmath69 at the midpoint of the logarithmic interval .",
    "this is our `` standard '' sector boundary displacement structure . from the central limit theorem",
    "one may infer that the sector width distribution thus obtained should be gaussian , with mean @xmath3 and dispersion @xmath76 .",

    "note that particles traveling the farthest from their starting point contribute the most to diffusive transport statistics at later times .",
    "if such particles were allowed to leave the system , the resulting diffusion coefficients would be underestimated .",
    "figure [ fig_sectors ] shows a fragment of the sector boundary structure calculated with @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "the wiggles in the shape of the sheet are assumed to be a result of turbulent flows in the solar wind and heliosheath that displace the hcs radially .    in our model",
    "the sector structure is controlled by three parameters : @xmath3 , @xmath76 , and @xmath69 ( assuming the ratio @xmath86 is a constant ) .",

    "the particle may subsequently transfer to an adjacent sheet when the two become sufficiently close . by examining figure [ fig_traj ] one can envision a certain parallel between particle motion along the current sheets vs. motion across the sectors and motion along and across the mean magnetic field in a conventional slab/2d composite turbulence . indeed , in the latter case a particle stays on the same field line for a long time , but can at times switch to a different field line as a result of pitch - angle scattering events randomizing its gyrophase .",
    "a constriction in the sector structure acts similar to a scattering center allowing a particle to transfer from one current sheet to another .    from our simulations",
    "it emerges that particle transport in both directions becomes diffusive after a certain period of time ( dependent on particle s energy , mean sector width , and sector displacement properties ) .",

    "the main reason for this difference is the fact that the power spectrum of neutral sheet oscillations is the same in both simulations ( with 50 mev / n and 250 mev / n ) . the two would be alike only if the neutral sheet displacement wavelengths were also varied @xmath116 .    in the final experiment",
    "we vary the turbulence spectrum for a fixed energy ( 100 mev / n ) and sector width ( @xmath117 ) . instead of a broadband spectrum employed in the previous simulations , here we use a narrow - band spectrum with a constant power spectral density between @xmath68 and @xmath71 .",
    "the spectrum extends a single decade in wavenumber and is represented with @xmath118 modes . running diffusion coefficients at the end of each run are recorded as the asymptotic values .",
    "the results are plotted in figure [ fig_wave1 ] .",
    "we see that increasing the wavelength leads to an increase in @xmath82 and a decrease in @xmath81 .",
    "the latter is easily understood from the fact that by reducing @xmath68 the mean distance between neutral sheet constrictions , acting as scattering centers , increases leading to a reduction in scattering rates .",

    "the analytic treatment of the problem was performed using the boltzmann equation for a non - gyrotropic velocity distribution .",
    "unlike the numerical model , the sector width was constant .",
    "instead , stochasticity was provided by small - angle gyrophase scattering events .",

    "gyration can produce net streaming along the sector planes if the widths of the positive and the negative sectors are different .",
    "the magnitude of the streaming flux tends to increase with @xmath120 .    in our test - particle simulations we found that particles undergo diffusive random walk in the plane perpendicular to @xmath2 , i.e. , in the radial and latitudinal directions .",
    "the efficiency of this process depends critically on the size of neutral sheet `` wiggles '' and the mean thickness of the alternating polarity sectors .",
    "the ratio of perpendicular and parallel diffusion coefficients is zero in the limit of very long - wavelenfth fluctuations , and when the ratio @xmath120 is small . in the opposite limit ( short - wavelength fluctuations , @xmath121 ) the ratio approaches unity . in the latter regime",

    "these values are larger than the perpendicular diffusion coefficients calculated using the standard theory for solar - wind fluctuations . for example , in the model of @xcite @xmath125 is between @xmath126 and @xmath127 @xmath124/s for 100 mev and 1 gev protons , respectively . for helium with the same energy per nucleon",
    "the diffusion coefficients will be larger by up to a factor of 4 ( for resonant interactions in the energy range of the turbulence with @xmath128 and @xmath129 ) .",
    "the current - sheet radial diffusion coefficient is about a factor of 5 larger .",
    "remember , however , that conventional scattering by turbulence was not included in our model .",
    "we expect our results to be more reliable in a situation where the level of background turbulent activity at resonant wavenumbers is relatively low .",
    "the interplay between the sheet - parallel and perpendicular transport in our model resembles in several ways conventional diffusion along and across the magnetic field .",
    "constrictions between the adjacent sheets appear to play the role of scattering centers .",
    "nevertheless , one should exercise caution before drawing parallels between the two .",
    "parallel diffusion in qlt is a resonant process , which is clearly not the case for current sheet diffusion .",
    "the current sheet transport mechanism is most efficient for galactic ions with energies of the order 100 mev per nucleon and above .",
    "voyager 1 observations of galactic helium made near the end of 2011 at a heliocentric distance of @xmath130 au ( mcdonald et al . , agu abstract ) are close or in excess of the predicted interstellar intensities from @xcite .",
    "if voyager 1 is 10 au in front of the heliopause , the current - sheet effect could be responsible for the lack of modulation .",
    "another possible cause is the absence of a radial plasma flow @xcite which would otherwise expel energetic particles from the heliosheath .",
    "the diffusion mechanism discussed here may facilitate the transport of interstellar dust grains with size @xmath131 m that have a gyroradius similar to that of a few hundred mev cosmic - ray ion @xcite .",
    "conversely , it is not efficient for low - rigidity particles such as electrons , because their gyro - radius is much smaller than the distance between the adjacent sheets .",
    "the recent rise of the low - energy electrons measured by the voyagers @xcite , is probably not directly related to the current sheet diffusion effect discussed here . at such small rigidities",
    "the effect of magnetic field meandering is likely to take precedence over current sheet transport as described by our current model .",
    "the model is somewhat restricted by the assumption that the direction along @xmath2 is an ignorable coordinate ; this could lead to an under - estimate of the diffusion rate in the radial direction .",
    "we realize that a more accurate diffusion model should include `` conventional '' turbulence ( variations in the magnitude and direction of @xmath2 ) in addition to the current - sheet oscillations .",
    "such a project would require massively larger computer simulations taking thousands of cpu - hours for a single run , but may be ultimately needed solve the problem of cosmic - ray transport in the distant heliosheath . despite technical difficulties , in the future it might be possible to combine the two kinds of diffusion into a single three - dimensional model of energetic charged particle transport .",
