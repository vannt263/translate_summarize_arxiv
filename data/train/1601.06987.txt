    "in particle physics , the exact hadronization process is unknown . to determine the structure of events at high and low energies a model for hadronization from first principles",

    "there have been many attempts at modeling creation within the quark model ( qm ) formalism arising from micu s suggestion @xcite that hadron decays proceed through @xmath6 pair production with vacuum quantum numbers , i.e. @xmath7 . since the @xmath6 pair corresponds to a @xmath8 quark - antiquark state , this model is known as the @xmath8 pair - creation model @xcite .",
    "new studies have been conducted by the clas collaboration @xcite .",
    "these have tried to extract the flavor - dependence of the creation in two - body exclusive reactions .",
    "the study of creation can help us to understand how quarks become observable hadrons , which now is an open problem .    in this letter",
    ", we will focus on the role of nucleon sea quarks in hadron production of baryon - meson final state for the exclusive reactions , when there are no decay chains . since the evidence for the flavor asymmetry of the proton sea was found by nmc at cern @xcite",
    ", many studies have been carried out to explain the importance of the quark - antiquark content in the nucleon and its role in the observables .",
    "we computed the ratios of this baryon - meson production by inferring them from the continiuum components of the nucleon using the unquenched quark model ( uqm ) for baryons@xcite .",
    "we also extracted the probabilities of the sea quarks and their relation with creation in electroproduction .",
    "the uqm is based on a quark model ( qm ) with continuum components , which quark - antiquark pairs with vacuum quantum numbers are added as a perturbation employing a @xmath9 model for @xmath10 pair creation .",
    "this approach , which is a generalization of the unitarized quark model by trnqvist and zenczykowski @xcite , was motivated by the work by isgur and coworkers on the flux - tube breaking model .",
    "they showed that the qm emerges as the adiabatic limit of the flux - tube model to which the effects of pair creation can be added as a perturbation @xcite .",
    "the pair - creation mechanism is inserted at the quark level and the one - loop diagrams are calculated by summing over a complete set of intermediate baryon - meson states . under these assumptions ,",
    "the baryon wave function consists of a zeroth order three - quark configuration @xmath11 plus a sum over all the possible higher fock components due to the creation of @xmath9 quark - antiquark pairs .",

    "the production ratios in exclusive reaction from proton target were just measured by the clas collaboration @xcite .",
    "we computed the ratios , inferring from the ratio of probability to find the virtual - baryon - meson - components ( bc ) in the nucleon wave function .",
    "@xmath40 in the electroproduction process we could assume that the proportional constant could be the same for baryon - meson final states , the production ratio from proton target , for example , could be written as follow : @xmath41    [ we have noticed that this assumption is not always true , since in the process a phase space factor should be added . however , in the recent study by mestayer _",
    "@xcite the ratios between @xmath42 and @xmath43 are approximately independent of @xmath44 ( total hadronic energy in the center of mass frame ) .",

    "[ fig1 ] , where the virtual photon @xmath45 is absorbed by the virtual baryon @xmath14 , by the quark created in the @xmath8 vertex . under this picture , after the quark from the @xmath8 vertex absorbs the photon , it can not close the @xmath8 loop and the hadronization occurs .",
    "since the final baryon - meson state @xmath46 is observed experimentally in exclusive reactions , only the virtual component bc in the nucleon wave function will contribute if @xmath46 virtual state is the same as the @xmath46 state that can be observed in exclusive reactions .",
    "in the ratios , the coupling constants and other factors due to the process cancel out , thus the ratios in exclusive reactions are inferred from the sea quarks of the nucleon .    here",

    "the contribution of this creation process is expected to be small and is not considered here .    in the uqm",
    "the probability of finding a @xmath46 component is the product of a spin - flavor - isospin factor and a radial integral as follows : @xmath49 where the factor @xmath50 is the ratio of the color - flavor - spin - isospin ( cfsi ) factors and the integral @xmath51 is simply defined in general for the production of a baryon b and a meson c , from a baryon a , as @xmath52    the value of @xmath53 depends on the size of the harmonic oscillator wave functions for baryons and mesons , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 respectively , and the gaussian smearing of the pair - creation vertex , @xmath56 , it is taken from ref .",

    "the energy denominator represents the energy difference between initial and final hadrons calculated in the rest frame of the initial baryon .",
    "the color - flavor - spin - isospin factor plays an important role in the production rates .",
    "in fact , for example if we consider the limit case in which , the two final bc states in the ratio are in the same isospin channels , the radial contribution is the same and the production rate will only depend on this factor .",
    "thus the predicted ratio for @xmath59 is well understood on the basis of isospin symmetry ( it is conserved in the uqm ) , for which the value is @xmath60 .",
    "however , the general result is determined by a combination of ratios of cfsi factors and integrals over the relative momentum , see eq .",

    "inspection of table  [ tab : res ] shows that the observed rates are reproduced very well by our calculations .",
    "in addition , we present the results for some other channels . moreover , using the isospin symmetry we computed the production rates from the neutron .",

    "in summary we computed the production ratios of baryon - meson final states in exclusive reactions and we found that our predictions of those ratios are in good agreement with the new experimental data at jlab @xcite as a first theoretical calculation that explains the new data reported in the letter @xcite .",
    "we also computed other baryon - meson production ratios still unobserved but that in principle could be observed in exclusive reactions from proton or neutron initial states in future new experiments . in particular , for the neutron case we suggested new experiments on deuterium or tritium .",
    "we showed that sea quarks play an important role in the electroproduction since our predictions are in agreement with the experimental results , thus we found that the meson - baryon production in exclusive reactions could provide information on the sea components of the nucleon .",

    "the extraction of quark - antiquark production in exclusive reactions from nucleon gave us a suppression of strange quark - antiquarks compared to nonstrange pairs .",

    "@xcite the experimentalists observed that the measured rates are independent from the type and energy of any resonance formed in the intermediate state .",
    "as such , the results should reflect some fundamental aspect of flavor production like the breaking of the underling su(3 ) symmetry induced by the sea quark components .",
