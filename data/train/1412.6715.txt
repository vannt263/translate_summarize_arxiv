    "the probabilistic approach to the area of quantum games @xcite shows how quantum probabilities can result in non - classical outcomes that defy intuition . without referring directly to the mathematical machinery of quantum mechanics ,",
    "this approach shows how a game - theoretic setting can benefit from quantum probabilities obtained from quantum mechanical experiments . as classical probabilities , quantum probabilities are normalized but they also obey other constraints that are dictated by the rules of quantum mechanics .",
    "our earlier studies @xcite have investigated coevolution @xcite in quantum games and also developing a probabilistic approach to quantum games @xcite .",
    "the solution concept of the nash equilibrium ( ne ) from non - cooperative game theory @xcite has been studied from the outset of the field of quantum game theory . named after john nash , it consists of a set of strategies , one for each player , such that no player is left with the incentive to unilaterally change her action .",
    "players are in equilibrium if the change in strategies by any one of them would lead that player to earn less than if she remained with her current strategy .    for a physical system used in implementing a quantum game ,",
    "one usually considers violation of bell s inequality in relation to the outcome of the game as represented by the concept of a ne . in almost all cases of interest within the area of quantum game theory , one notices that bell s inequality violation",
    "may only be indirectly proportional to the ne ( or equilibria ) of the game .",
    "the question then arises whether there exist other solution concepts for which the mentioned connection becomes a direct proportionlity . in the present paper",
    ", it is shown that when one considers a particular refinement of the ne concept , a direct connection can indeed be established between bell s inequality and the outcome of the game as represented by that refinement .",
    "pareto optimality is a refinement on the set of nash equilibria .",
    "an outcome of a game is pareto optimal if there is no other outcome that makes every player at least as well off and at least one player strictly better off .",
    "that is , a pareto optimal outcome can not be improved upon without disadvantaging at least one player . quite often",
    ", a ne is not pareto optimal implying that players payoffs can all be increased .",
    "for the prisoners dilemma game , it is well known that the ne is not pareto optimal .",
    "a stronger refinement of the ne concept , which is even simpler to state , is known as _ social optimality _",
    "@xcite . it is a choice of strategies , one by each player , which is a social welfare maximizer as it maximizes the sum of the players payoffs .",
    "of course , this definition is only appropriate to the extent that it makes sense to add the payoffs of different players together .",
    "maximizing the sum of players payoff may not necessarlily lead to the satisfaction of all the participating players .",
    "as the pareto optimal outcome is a refinement on the set of ne , the outcomes that are socially optimal must also be pareto optimal .",
    "if such an outcome were not pareto optimal , there would be a different outcome in which all payoffs were at least as large , and one was larger",
    ". this would be an outcome with a larger sum of payoffs .",
    "on the other hand , a pareto optimal outcome need not be socially optimal and a  ne may not be socially optimal even though it can be pareto optimal .",
    "however , a socially optimal outcome is always pareto optimal .    in an earlier work @xcite",
    "we have studied the solution concept of a bayesian nash equilibrium using a probabilistic approach to quantum games @xcite . in the present paper ,",
    "we study how quantum probabilities can result in a different outcome for the solution concept of social optimality in a bayesian game .",
    "we notice that with this refinement of the ne concept , a direct connection appears between violation of chsh form of bell s inequality @xcite and the social optimal outcome of the bayesian game .",
    "the decision - makers in a strategic game are called players who are endowed with a set of actions . in a bayesian game",
    "@xcite the players have incomplete information about the other players payoffs i.e. the payoffs are not common knowledge .",
    "incomplete information means that at least one player does not know someone else s payoffs .",
    "random values are assigned to the players that take values of _ types _ for each player and probabilities are associated to those types .",
    "a player s payoff function is determined by his / her type and the probability associated with that type .",
    "examples include auctions in which bidders do not know each others valuations and bargaining processes in which another player s discout factor is unknown .",
    "the game of battle of the sexes @xcite when one does not know if the other prefers to be alone or go on a date provides a clearer exposition of a social dilemma that can be analysed using the theory of bayesian games .",
    "more formally @xcite , a bayesian game consists of players and states .",
    "each player has a set of actions , a set of signals that the player may receive , and a signal function that associates a signal with each state .",
