    "density functional theory ( dft ) simulations ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) have become popular tools for electronic structure calculations .",
    "compared to the exact solution of the many - body schrdinger equation , discrepancies in the electron density obtained from dft - based kohn - sham ( ks ) @xcite schemes are , by construction , caused by the unavoidable approximation to the generally unknown exact exchange - correlation ( xc ) potential . however , in practice it is common to apply additional approximations , most notably `` pseudopotentials '' or the `` frozen - core approximation '' ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) in order to avoid the numerical effort of treating tightly - bound inner electrons .",
    "the justification for this neglect is that core electrons do not take directly part in , e.g. , the formation of bonds .",
    "dft has been extended to systems in time - dependent external potentials . in principle , time - dependent density functional theory ( tddft ) ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) allows to study many - electron systems such as atoms , molecules , or clusters in strong laser fields , even beyond linear response .",
    "it is known , however , that switching from dft to tddft makes the unknown exact xc functional even more inaccessible because of memory effects and the initial - state dependence it should contain @xcite but all practicable approximations to it do not .    in this paper , we study inner - electron dynamics induced by time - dependent external fields .",
    "in contrast to typical applications of dft concerning the ground state electronic structure of the system at hand , even the lowest ks orbitals may undergo a significant modification if the system is subjected to a strong external laser field in tddft beyond linear response .",
    "evidently , it is invalid to freeze those ks orbitals which directly contribute to , e.g. , the outgoing electron density of an atom being ionized .",
    "if , on the other hand , solely the ks valence orbital dominates ionization , it is an eligible question if the essential dynamics can be reproduced by a frozen - core , pseudo , or single - active - electron ( sae ) potential .",
    "in fact , the sae approximation is ubiquitous in the strong - field ionization community ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "only recently it has been recognized that in multi - electron molecules it is often not permissible to consider only the highest occupied molecular orbital in strong - field processes @xcite .",
    "the question we address in this paper is whether core electrons in atoms can be considered `` frozen '' or not in the interaction with _",
    "long _ wavelength radiation . here",
    ", `` long '' means that the photon energy @xmath0 should be small compared to the energy by which the core electrons are bound .",
    "given the energy level spacings of the li atom , we thus need to consider the multiphoton regime , and the single - photon regime up to photon energies well below values where the core electrons are accessed `` directly '' by the applied laser field .",
    "we employ a model li atom , for which we are able to numerically solve the time - dependent schrdinger equation ( tdse ) _",
    "ab initio_. lithium is the simplest element with core electrons in the ground state configuration and thus serves as a perfect testing ground .",
    "however , strong - laser driven li in full dimensionality is well beyond nowadays computational capabilities .",
    "even with the spatial degrees of freedom restricted to one dimension ( i.e. , the laser polarization direction ) per electron , the numerical demand is enormous for strong laser fields .",
    "we have been able to speed up the calculations by employing properties of the time - dependent , spatial three - body wavefunction in the ionization regime considered and by optimizing the tdse solver for graphics processing units .",

    "the ionization probability is chosen as the primary observable for our investigations because it is well - defined and comparable among all considered methods . in the tdse simulation ,",
    "position space @xmath62 is divided into four regions , differing by the number of electrons which are located far away from the nucleus ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - box ] ) .",
    "the respective ionization regions are ( i ) no ionization : single small cube around the nucleus , ( ii ) single ionization : six channels pointing to the surface centers of the simulation box , ( iii ) double ionization : twelve cuboids , four lying in each of the three central plains , ( iv ) triple ionization : eight cubes in the corners of the simulation box .",
    "the laser parameters considered throughout this paper are such that multiple ionization is negligible .",
    "thus , the ( single- ) ionization probability @xmath63 reduces to @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the norm inside the cube around the nucleus ( representing neutral li ) .",
    "the whole purpose of applying the floquet approach in this work is the determination of resonances , taking the ac stark effect into account .    in general , the floquet method ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) allows to study time - dependent problems without an explicit time - propagation .",
    "this is possible if the hamiltonian @xmath47 is periodic in time , i.e. @xmath66 because the so - called floquet theorem then allows to obtain a time - independent eigenvalue equation for the field - dressed states and the corresponding quasienergies .",
    "quasienergy spectra are useful for predicting resonance enhancements in the ionization rate as a function of the laser frequency with the ac stark effect automatically included .",

    "dft @xcite and its time - dependent extension tddft @xcite are approaches to overcome the exponential scaling of the numerical effort with the number of particles .",
    "they are based on the fact that all information about the system is included in the ( time - dependent ) single - particle density @xmath73 , as proven by the hohenberg - kohn theorem  @xcite and its time - dependent analog , the runge - gross theorem  @xcite .",
    "( td)dft calculations are performed in practice within a ks scheme , i.e. , the single - particle density is reproduced with the help of a fictitious , much easier - to - solve noninteracting system evolving in an effective ks potential .    in this work ,",
    "the spin - polarized li - system is studied .",
    "we therefore consider the spin - densities @xmath74 , @xmath75 .",

    "the exchange functional for the three - dimensional electron gas is considered because the one - dimensional model introduced in sec .",
    "[ chapter - model ] is meant to mimic a three - dimensional three - electron atom in a linearly polarized laser field rather than a true one - dimensional system .",

    "a known problem of lda is the wrong asymptotic behavior of the ks potential @xmath84 .",
    "each ks orbital in an , e.g. , unperturbed , neutral atom should experience a potential @xmath85 far away from the nucleus , representing one unscreened nuclear charge .",
    "this correct behavior can be enforced by the so - called perdew - zunger ( pz ) self - interaction correction ( sic ) @xcite .",
    "pz sic corrects the hartree and xc potentials for each orbital @xmath39 by subtracting the potentials evaluated for the `` own '' single - particle density @xmath86 . in the case of pz - corrected lda ,",
    "the final corrected xc potential is calculated as ( time and space arguments suppressed ) @xmath87-v^{(\\mathrm{h})}[n_i ] -v^{(\\mathrm{lda})}[n_i].\\quad\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is easy to see that this leads to the correct sic in the single - electron limit . however , due to the nonlinearity of the ks potential , i.e. , @xmath88-v^{(\\mathrm{xc})}[n_i]\\neq v^{(\\mathrm{xc})}[n - n_i]$ ] , the self - interaction is not completely removed by pz - sic in general .",
    "the pz - corrected ks hamiltonian is orbital - dependent , i.e. , it is in general different for each orbital @xmath39 ( i.e. , not only different for orbitals with different @xmath89 , as in `` conventional '' spin - dft ) .",
    "an unpleasant consequence of this orbital - dependence of the ks hamiltonian is the non - orthogonality of the pz - sic ks orbitals ( although in practice they are usually very close to orthogonal ) .",
    "positive consequences of the pz - sic are that , besides the correct asymptotic behavior of potentials and densities , the values for the total energy , and ionization energies ( or electron affinities of negative ions ) typically improve .",
    "all - electron ( td)dft calculations often become numerically too demanding . hence , it is common to apply additional approximations in order to reduce the numerical effort further .",
    "one may employ the fact that chemical bonds and reactions are governed by valence electrons so that the relaxation of electronic core shells may be considered negligible .",
    "consequently , tightly localized ks orbitals may be self - consistently determined for the initial state configuration but `` frozen '' during the actual tddft time - propagation .",
    "this approach will be referred to as `` frozen - core approximation '' ( fca ) .",
    "one of the issues in this work is the validity of the fca for atoms interacting with a strong laser field , i.e. , in tddft calculations beyond linear response .      consider a one - dimensional ( e.g. , radial ) ks orbital , which is orthogonal to @xmath90 other mutually orthogonal orbitals . if these other orbitals are constructed with the minimum number of nodes the considered orbital must have at least @xmath90 nodes .",
    "a numerical grid thus requires a fine spatial resolution in order to resolve all orbital nodes , including the behavior in - between where the second derivative can reach high absolute values .    a popular tool which aims at circumventing the numerical demand caused by orbitals with many , densely - distributed nodes are `` pseudopotentials '' ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "after applying the fca , an artificial potential is constructed such that those orbitals which are not frozen yield the same single - particle density outside a certain cutoff radius @xmath91 as in the full calculation but have less nodes within @xmath92 $ ] .",
    "moreover , the pseudopotential is `` designed '' to reproduce the ks energies of the unfrozen orbitals ( and possibly also those of the unpopulated , excited states ) . as in the motivation of the fca ,",
    "the argument for using pseudopotentials in chemistry is that only valence electron densities are important for the questions of interest such as molecular binding properties and chemical reactions . in other words ,",
    "only the electron density far away from the nuclei is important .    in the hierarchy of approximations ,",
    "pseudopotentials reside below the fca .",
    "hence we do not test particular pseudopotentials in this work .",
    "if the fca fails , pseudopotentials will fail too ( unless there is a lucky cancellation of errors caused by the removal of the nodes for @xmath93 ) .",
    "in the single - active - electron ( sae ) picture it is assumed that the electron under investigation can be described as a single particle moving in an effective , external potential .",
    "it thus may be also viewed as an fca .",
    "dft provides one option to approximate this effective , external potential : one performs an all - electron dft calculation for the desired initial electron configuration ( usually the ground state ) and subsequently `` freezes '' all ks orbitals but the one for the sae of interest for the real - time propagation . in that way",
    ", a dependence on the xc potential is introduced only indirectly through the initial state . in the strong - field community ,",
    "often simple analytical expressions for screened coulomb potentials with adjustable screening parameters are used @xcite .",
    "the question arises which state the sae should populate in the effective potential .",
    "common choices are ( i ) the ground state ( corresponding to a pseudopotential approach with one valence electron ) or ( ii ) some excited state ( corresponding to pure fca ) .",
    "the latter choice is more relevant for applications to intense laser - atom interaction , as the orbital symmetry of the initial state of the valence electron is important and can be measured in ionization experiments @xcite .",

    "we further observe the antisymmetry plane @xmath104 and the preference of spatial regions where no more than one electron is located at a position comparatively far from the nucleus .",
    "the ionization rate @xmath105 for a certain photon energy @xmath68 was determined by fitting @xmath65 to @xmath106 ( see the definition of @xmath63 in sec .  [ sec - channels ] ) during the flat - top part of a trapezoidal laser pulse .",
    "given a maximum simulation time @xmath107 , the electric field amplitude @xmath69 during the flat - top part of the pulse is chosen high enough to make the relevant ionization timescales for a `` numerically measurable '' ionization yield shorter than @xmath108 .",
    "besides the inverse ionization rate @xmath109 also the inverse @xmath90-photon rabi frequency @xmath110 matters here . on the other hand , the ponderomotive energy @xmath111 should be smaller than both the ionization potential @xmath112 and the photon energy @xmath68 . otherwise , ( strong field ) effects such as ac stark shifts , above - threshold ionization , and stabilization @xcite could influence the ionization dynamics dramatically .",

    "the results have been so unreasonable that they are not even shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - rates - all ] but are just mentioned here .",
    "first , the pure lda tddft approach completely fails in generating a reasonable behavior of ionization probability vs time in the multiphoton regime @xmath117 so that a rate could not be extracted .",
    "second , the tddft approach using pz sic leads to resonances of inner electrons at high frequencies @xmath163 , leading to a non - monotonous behavior of the ionization rate not seen in the exact result .    the results shown in fig .  [ fig - rates - all ]",
    "share a similar qualitative behavior . in the low - frequency limit @xmath164 the ionization rate changes rapidly with the frequency , as",
    "the exact result does due to the many avoided crossings discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec - floquet - results ] . to the right of the two - photon ionization",
    "peak a sharp minimum at @xmath165 $ ] shows up in all results . in the remaining multiphoton ionization part up to @xmath166 one or two peaks are visible , corresponding to one - photon excited - state - assisted ionization . in the single - photon ionization regime",
    "@xmath167 a monotonic decrease of the ionization rate , starting from its maximum value for @xmath168 , is observed in all cases .",
    "however , the correct linear behavior ( on the logarithmic scale ) is reproduced solely by the lda tddft approach _ without _ pz sic .    at first sight ,",
    "no approximation is able to reproduce the peak structure of the ionization rate in the multiphoton ionization regime quantitatively . as mentioned already",
    ", tddft in pure lda does not even allow for a fit @xmath106 .",
    "the lda sae approach yields too few peaks and an incorrect curvature around @xmath169 .",
    "furthermore , the excited - state - assisted ionization peak around @xmath170 is blue - shifted while the ionization threshold is red - shifted .",
    "this can be partially explained by the wrong asymptotic behavior of the ks potential originating from self - interaction in pure lda .",
    "the multiphoton ionization curve for tddft utilizing lda and pz sic appears to be calculated with less spectral resolution than the corresponding sae result and also does not match the exact curve .",
    "the sae approximation in the pz - corrected case leads to the correct number of peaks .",
    "if each of the @xmath90-photon - peaks is shifted to the right by @xmath171 one finds a striking agreement with the exact tdse result with respect to peak positions , widths , and heights .",
    "this improvement over pure lda is due to the asymptotically correct ks potentials in the case of pz sic .",
    "in fact , three - dimensional dft calculations applying the pz sic are often useful to quantitatively reproduce experimental values for ionization thresholds and excitation energies .",
    "hence , the required shift @xmath172 may be due to the one - dimensionality of the li model system considered in this work .",
    "the full tdse and the lda tddft calculations yield an exponential decrease of the ionization rate for increasing photon energies .",
    "the corresponding slopes approximately equal each other . however , the rate predicted by lda tddft is too high .",
    "a possible explanation for the overestimated rate is the following : the _ down_shift of the ks energy during ionization in lda without sic ( see sec .  [",
    "sec - sic - for - reso ] below ) leads to an _ increased _ ionization probability in the single - photon regime ( because the ionization probability drops with increasing excess energy @xmath173 ) .",
    "hence , one may view the lda rate as rather being blue - shifted than up - shifted .",
    "all approaches neglecting inner electron dynamics completely ( pure lda sae and pz - corrected sae ) or partially ( spin - selective laser _ gedankenexperiment _ ) yield a convex curvature in the logarithmic plot . with increasing photon energy the slopes of these three curves approach zero so that the error in the ionization rate rises .",
    "surprisingly , the pz - corrected tddft calculations yield the worst rate , which is too small at the threshold , decreases too rapidly with increasing @xmath68 , and has a concave curvature .    concluding this subsection",
    ", we can state that none of the considered approximations is able to yield correct ionization rates over the frequency interval @xmath174 $ ] , the best performing being the pz - corrected sae approximation in the multiphoton and the pure lda tddft in the single - photon ionization regime .    in the remainder of this section , the reasons for this will be explained .",
    "specifically , the importance of sic and the problem of pz sic in the high - frequency regime will be studied .",
    "the pz sic leads to `` better '' ks energies of the populated levels in the sense of being closer to the respective ionization energies .",
    "the energies of the unpopulated levels in the groundstate ks potential also benefit from the sic , leading to `` better '' excitation energies . both are important ingredients for a correct ionization rate in the multiphoton regime .",
    "however , in a time - dependent calculation sic also helps taking into account the discontinuity of the ks potential at integer orbital occupation numbers ( this is the so - called `` derivative discontinuity '' in the xc energy , cf .",
    "the ionization potential must not depend on the ionization probability @xmath63 .",
    "hence , the ks energy of the orbital from which predominantly ionization occurs should be independent of @xmath175 .",
    "only when @xmath176 is reached , the ks potential , and thus the orbital energy , should change discontinuously .",
    "the single - particle density in the vicinity of the nucleus decreases as @xmath63 increases . as a result ,",
    "the repulsive hartree potential is weakened so that all orbital energies would shift to lower values if the xc potential did not counteract .",
    "in fact , pure lda does not counteract properly so that the ks level energies vary continuously with @xmath63 .",
    "pz sic implements the derivative discontinuity , at least approximately .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig - occupation ] for a valence ks orbital occupation @xmath177 $ ] for pure lda and pz sic applied to lda . by considering fractional occupations in the stationary groundstate calculations",
    "we are mimicking adiabatically evolving ionization , i.e. , @xmath178 with @xmath179 the instantaneous ionization probability .",
    "for the neutral atom ground state @xmath180 the pz sic lowers the valence orbital energy compared to the uncorrected lda case,@xmath181 in the li@xmath95-limit @xmath182 both approaches almost agree,@xmath183 in pure lda the orbital energy shifts almost linearly during ionization down to small values of @xmath184 . with",
    "pz sic the orbital energy is shifted much less during ionization as long as @xmath185 . in the region",
    "@xmath186 $ ] the pz - sic orbital energy describes a `` smoothed jump '' down to the li@xmath95-value .",
    "hence , we find that the pz sic smoothes the step - function - like behavior the unknown , exact sic would yield .",
    "the improvement over pure lda regarding the constancy of the orbital energy of the `` ionizing ks level '' is essential .      with all the benefits from pz sic concerning ks level energies and the asymptotic behavior of the ks potential",
    ", it is an obvious question why pz - sic - corrected lda fails so badly in the single - photon ionization regime .",
    "the _ gedankenexperiment _ in sec .",
    "[ sec - gedankenexperiment ] indicates that dynamical coupling effects between electrons such as anti - screening become increasingly important as the photon energy @xmath68 rises . in tddft",
    ", the coupling between ks orbitals is mediated by the hartree part and the xc part of the ks potential . with pz sic",
    "the orbital - dependent ks potential reads @xmath187(x ) + v^\\mathrm{(h)}[n](x ) \\nonumber\\\\ *    & & - v^\\mathrm{(lda)}[n_i](x ) - v^\\mathrm{(h)}[n_i](x ) \\label{eq - pz - kohn - sham - potential}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the hartree potential is a linear functional of the total electron density so that @xmath187(x)\\nonumber\\\\ *   & & - v^\\mathrm{(lda)}[n_i](x ) + v^\\mathrm{(h)}[n - n_i](x).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the effective hartree term @xmath188(x)$ ] for the valence ks orbital after sic is solely determined by the core ks orbital density . as a result , the anti - screening mechanism is more pronounced than in pure lda , leading to a lower ionization rate at higher photon energies .",
    "although it seems reasonable to calculate the hartree potential without the `` own '' orbital density , the pz sic worsens the ionization rate .",
    "the anti - screening effect seems over - emphasized with pz sic .",
    "moreover , the dependence of the ionization rate as a function of the laser frequency is wrong , pointing to a deficiency in the _ dynamics _ of the xc potential ( note that the pz sae rate bends in the _ opposite _ direction ) . the fact that pure lda leads at least to the correct slope of the ionization rate in the single - photon ionization regime is thus likely due to a lucky cancellation of errors , i.e. , the suppressed anti - screening compensates the error in the adiabatic lda xc potential at all frequencies @xmath189 $ ] .",
    "in this work , we benchmarked various density functional - based approximate approaches to laser ionization with a numerically exactly solvable three - electron model atom . in order to correctly describe ionization in the multiphoton domain",
    ", energy levels as well as dipole transition probabilities must be reproduced by the simulation method , which is very demanding for pseudopotential and single - active - electron approaches .    moreover",
    ", the energy levels should not change as excited states get populated because this would move the system out of resonance . on the other hand",
    ", it is known that once the population is inverted , the density is the ground state density of a `` new , '' discontinuously changing kohn - sham potential @xcite . only proper self - interaction free kohn - sham potentials may capture such multiphoton ionization effects involving resonances .",
    "we found that the perdew - zunger self - interaction - corrected local density approximation performs well for the lithium model atom in this respect , at least qualitatively . in the apparently simple photoeffect regime where only one photon is required for ionization",
    ", a surprisingly pronounced dependence of the ionization dynamics on the correct treatment of the inner electrons is found .",
    "these inner electrons are usually assumed to be passive , justifying frozen - core , single - active - electron , and pseudopotential approaches .",
    "however , because of the opposite timescales of inner and outer electrons with respect to the laser period , the anti - screening of the nuclear charge by the inner electrons is ignored in such approaches .",
    "for instance , frozen - core orbitals lead to ionization rates too high , with an erroneously curved slope of the ionization rate as a function of the laser frequency .",
    "unfortunately , the more advanced perdew - zunger self - interaction - corrected local density approximation fails as well at high frequencies .    in future work , it is worth to compare our exact numerical model - li results with kohn - sham results using more advanced exchange - correlation functionals than we did in the current work @xcite .",
    "there might well be exchange - correlation potentials `` out there '' that perform well in both the multiphoton and single - photon ionization regime .",

    "discussions with v.  kapoor are gratefully acknowledged .",
    "in this appendix , numerical details concerning the solution of the tdse are given .",
    "the full solution of the three - particle tdse for processes involving ionization is numerically demanding even if the spatial degrees of freedom are reduced to one per particle .",

    "a speedup of three orders of magnitude over a single - core cpu implementation covering the full 3d cartesian grid is achieved on a desktop computer featuring an nvidia@xmath190 geforce@xmath190 gtx 580 gpu .",
    "the speedup originates equally from an efficient implementation utilizing the high single - precision performance of the gpu and the adjustment of the simulation grid .",
    "`` mixed precision '' techniques allow to obtain results in double precision although most of the numerical effort consists of single - precision floating point operations .",
    "the kinetic energy operator is discretized using the implicit numerov expression , which is accurate up to fourth order in the spatial gridspacing @xmath192 .",

    "the explicitly time - dependent hamiltonian @xmath47 is evaluated at midpoints @xmath194 .",
    "the linear equations to propagate the discretized wavefunction in time for one timestep can easily be arranged to require the solution of no more than a single implicit equation with a @xmath195 stencil . for a sufficiently small timestep",

    "faster convergence of long - wavelength errors is achieved by applying a multigrid scheme .",
    "finally , a high throughput of floating point operations is obtained by using mixed precision techniques and different data caching stages combined with massive parallelization .",
    "the numerical grid was optimized , exploiting what is known about the probability density dynamics during long - wavelength , single ionization .",
    "recall that the laser is tuned such that solely the outer electron is removed from the atom . as a consequence , the single spin - down inner electron is tightly bound to the core at all times .",
    "this means that @xmath197 will only yield non - vanishing probabilities for small @xmath198 .",
