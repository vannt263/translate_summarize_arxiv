    "there are two experimental pieces of evidence @xcite pressing us to extend the standard model ( sm ) : the evidence for neutrino masses and for the dark matter ( dm ) content of the universe .",
    "the ongoing experiments at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) may provide us with new insights on new heavy particles enabling weinberg s dimension - five operator @xmath2 @xcite as an explanation of the smallness of masses of observed neutrinos .",
    "the known tree level realizations of weinberg s operator proceed by adding to the particle content of the sm a single , gut - scale multiplet : a heavy fermion singlet for the type - i @xcite , a scalar triplet for the type - ii @xcite and a fermion triplet for the type - iii @xcite seesaw mechanism . on the other hand additional discrete symmetries are instrumental @xcite in bringing the seesaw mechanism to the tev scale accessible at the lhc .",
    "alternative lowering of the seesaw scale , without discrete symmetries , can be achieved either by going beyond dimension - five operator or by generating the neutrino masses at the loop level .",
    "the approach used by two recent models is to employ non - zero hypercharge seesaw mediators : the dimension - seven mechanism with fermion triplets in @xcite and the dimension - nine mechanism with fermion quintuplets in @xcite .",
    "both of these mechanisms offer the spectacular triply - charged states verifiable at the lhc .",
    "the approach in @xcite , which we follow here , is to link a dm candidate to the scale of radiatively generated neutrino ( r@xmath0 ) masses .",
    "the authors of @xcite exemplify it by employing a 10 tev scale fermionic quintuplet of zero hypercharge .",
    "let us stress that an isolated @xmath3 fermion field or an isolated septuplet @xmath4 scalar field have been singeld out as viable dm particle candidates within the so - called minimal dark matter ( mdm ) model @xcite .",
    "the dubbed r@xmath0mdm model @xcite claims to achieve the stability of the neutral mdm quintuplet component without introducing a symmetry beyond the sm gauge symmetries , on account of an accidental @xmath1 symmetry arising from the choice of the field content .",
    "it has been adopted in more recent paper @xcite aimed at successful leptogenesis .    from the point of generating the neutrino masses",
    ", the fermion quintuplet has to be accompanied by an appropriate scalar multiplet .",
    "high enough scalar field multiplet @xcite avoids the terms in the scalar potential which may lead to and induced vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the new scalar field , and there are only radiative neutrino masses .",
    "this r@xmath0mdm is realized by accompanying the zero hypercharge quintuplets @xmath3 by a hypercharge one sextuplets , @xmath5 , proposing the neutral component @xmath6 as fermionic dm candidate .    in section 2",
    "we give a brief description of this attempt and explicate a previously omitted term in the scalar potential , which spoils the stability of @xmath6 particle . in section 3",
    "we analyze two new seesaw models , the first in which a tentative dm particle appears as a neutral component of the scalar quintuplet @xmath7 , accompanied by a quadruplet seesaw mediator @xmath8 . in the second model",
    "we show that originally viable mdm scalar septuplet @xmath4 candidate also becomes unstable in the context of generating radiative neutrino masses .",
    "we summarize our results in the concluding section .",
    "to allow a yukawa coupling of the isospin two fermion @xmath3 to the lepton doublet @xmath9 , necessary for a mass generation mechanism , @xmath10 one has to introduce a scalar field @xmath11 of a half - integer ( 3/2 or 5/2 ) isospin in addition to the sm higgs @xmath12 . in order to avoid a vev of @xmath11 which might come from quartic @xmath13 term",
    ", the fermionic quintuplet @xmath3 has to be accompanied by a sextuplet scalar @xmath14 as in @xcite .",
    "these authors have argued that the neutral component of the fermionic quintuplet , @xmath6 , can be a dm candidate on account of an accidental @xmath1 symmetry of the lagrangian .",
    "we show that it is a viable dm candidate only if one forbids or finetunes a renormalizable @xmath15 term with the quartic coupling @xmath16 , omitted in @xcite . in their tensor notation ,",
    "the omitted term reads @xmath17 and it can induce a rapid decay of a dm particle at the loop level .",
    "for example , the loop diagram on fig .",
    "[ decay ] generates an effective dimension - six operator @xmath18 which leads to decays of the dm candidate @xmath6 .",
    "in particular , we estimate the decay amplitude for @xmath19 arising from it , @xmath20     at the loop level . ]",
    "it produces the decay width into four final - state particles , @xmath21 which is given by @xmath22 the inverse of it , a lifetime of a dm candidate , should be longer then the age of the universe given by the hubble time @xmath23 . for @xmath6 to have the lifetime @xmath24",
    ", the quartic coupling @xmath16 has to be tiny . by taking @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 ,",
    "the values adopted from @xcite , we obtain @xmath28 as an upper limit",
    ". in the context of the decaying dm @xcite the bound on the @xmath29 can be nine orders of magnitude larger ( @xmath30 ) , implaying even stronger limit , @xmath31 .",
    "this means that @xmath6 is a viable dm candidate only if the coupling in eq .",
    "( [ dim4 ] ) has an extremely small value .",
    "this is in contradiction with the claim in @xcite , and in order to avoid the fine - tuning one has to impose the @xmath1 symmetry forbidding the renormalizable term in eq .",
    "( [ dim4 ] ) , by hand .    without such discrete symmetry",
    "a model more minimal than in @xcite is possible with scalar quadruplet @xmath32 replacing previous sextuplet field .",
    "like in case of previously studied non - zero hypercharge fermion @xcite , this field @xmath11 develops an induced vev from the quartic @xmath33 term .",
    "the yukawa terms result in a tree - level dimension - nine seesaw operator .",
    "these and additional contributions to the neutrino masses from radiative loop - suppressed diagrams are presented in a separate paper @xcite .",
    "in the light of the described blow to fermionic mdm candidate in the radiative neutrino masses setup , let us now reconsider the scalar mdm multiplets @xcite .",
    "the models involving hypercharge - zero scalar field in radiatively generating neutrino masses through diagrams displayed on fig .",
    "[ mnuloop ] have two essential features : ( i ) the scalar field is accompanied with appropriate fermion multiplet ; ( ii ) there are two scalar fields of different hypercharge in play , the one with hypercharge zero being the dm candidate .          a minimal possibility to realize the diagram on fig .",
    "[ mnuloop ] through the scalar quintuplet @xmath34 as mdm candidate is to accompany it with another scalar quintuplet @xmath35 in conjunction with non - zero hypercharge fermionic quadruplet @xmath8 as the seesaw mediator .    with two scalars @xmath34 and @xmath35",
    ", there are , up to our knowledge previously unconsidered , dimension - three @xmath1 noninvariant operators in the lagrangian @xmath36 which in tensor notation read @xmath37 these terms make the dm candidate @xmath38 unstable through loop diagrams like the one on fig .",

    "the term @xmath48 is forbidden by bose statistics @xcite , but in presence of another septuplet @xmath49 there is the dimension - three @xmath1 noninvariant operator @xmath50 making the dm candidate @xmath38 unstable .     decays . ]",

    "( [ dim3 ] ) is restricted to very small value , @xmath55 .",
    "to conclude , a major blow to scalar r@xmath0mdm variants comes from super - renormalizable dimension - three @xmath56 operators . besides these renormalizable @xmath1 violating operators , there are possible effects from the planck scale considered in @xcite and references therein .",
    "we address in a common framework the open questions of the neutrino masses and the dark matter content of the universe . in view of the immense dm possibilities",
    ", a minimality of the dm model appears as a criterion essential for its predictivity and testability .",
    "the minimality is satisfied by adding only one extra @xmath57 multiplet in the mdm setup . however , by imposing additional seesaw mission to a given mdm multiplet , it has to be accompanied by additional scalar field introducing new obstacles to the dm stability .",
    "it would be appealing if the dm candidate , a neutral component of a certain higher weak - isospin multiplet , could be stabilized without introducing a symmetry beyond the sm gauge symmetries , as claimed in @xcite .",

    "[ mnuloop ] .",
