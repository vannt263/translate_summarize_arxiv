    "@xmath18 ) stars observed to date @xcite .",
    "in particular , the so - called cemp - no stars ( which exhibit sub - solar abundances of neutron - capture elements ; e.g. , @xmath5 $ ] @xmath19 0.0 ) are believed to be direct descendants from the very first stellar generations formed after the big bang @xcite .",
    "in addition , the discovery of high - redshift carbon - enhanced damped ly@xmath20",
    "systems @xcite , which present qualitatively similar light - element ( from c to si ) abundance patterns as the cemp - no stars , provides additional evidence that carbon is an important contributor to the earliest chemical evolution .",
    "one of the main open questions is whether the presence of carbon is required for the formation of low - mass second - generation stars @xcite .",
    "this idea can be tested with low - mass long - lived ump stars that are thought to have formed from an ism polluted by the nucleosynthesis products of massive metal - free population iii ( pop iii ) stars .",
    "these massive stars could have formed as early as several hundred million years after the big bang , at redshift @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "the recently discovered quasar ulas  j1120@xmath40641 at redshift @xmath22 @xcite , with an overall metal abundance ( defined as elements heavier then helium ) of @xmath23$]@xmath24 , could be an example of a viable site for the formation of the first stars .",
    "the lack of heavy metals may prevent the formation of low - mass stars ( due to inefficient cooling ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , supporting the suggestion that the early - universe initial mass function was strongly biased toward high - mass stars . in the picture that has developed , it is these high - mass stars that would quickly evolve and enrich the primordial ism with elements heavier than helium , including carbon @xcite .    even though the relevance of cemp - no stars as probes of the first stellar generations in the universe is well - established , the exact conditions that led to their formation remain an active area of inquiry . there have been a number of advances in the theoretical description of the likely stellar progenitors of cemp - no stars over the last decade ( see * ? ?",
    "* for a recent review on the subject ) .",
    "the suggested scenarios include the `` spinstar '' model ( rapidly - rotating , near zero - metallicity , massive stars ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the `` faint sne '' that undergo mixing and fallback @xcite , and the metal - free massive stars from @xcite .    in the spinstar model , it is assumed that the chemical composition of the observed ump stars is a combination of the evolution of the massive star itself mixed with some amount of interstellar material @xcite .",
    "it follows that the source of heavy metals in the ump stars could arise from a different set of progenitors . for the faint sne and metal - free massive stars , the initial chemical abundances of the progenitor mimic the primordial big bang nucleosynthesis composition : 76% hydrogen , about 24% helium , and a trace amount of lithium . in both cases ,",
    "the observed chemical elements in ump stars were formed during the progenitor stellar evolution , either by internal burning and/or explosive events , and their abundance is the result of mixing between the sne ejecta with surrounding primordial gas .",
    "these two models differ in terms of the treatment of the mixing and fallback of processed materials in the progenitor , which varies with mass and explosion energy ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for details ) .",
    "the @xcite models compute explosion energy and fallback self - consistently based on a hydrodynamic model , considering that the sn explosion is spherical .",
    "all of the aforementioned models are able to reproduce a subset of ( but not all ) of the observed elemental - abundance patterns of ump stars reasonably well .",
    "nevertheless , the question of whether one or more classes of progenitors were present ( and their relative frequencies ) in the primordial universe is still under discussion . in paper",
    "i of this series , @xcite present evidence based on the morphology of the relationship between the absolute abundance of carbon , @xmath7(c ) @xmath25(c ) , and [ fe / h ] , coupled with clear differences in the absolute abundances of the light elements na and mg among cemp - no stars , that at least two classes of progenitors are likely to be required .",
    "it appears that one class ( spinstars ) dominates at the very lowest metallicities , [ fe / h ] @xmath26 , whereas the other ( faint sne ) dominates over the range @xmath27 [ fe / h ] @xmath28 . in the metallicity range @xmath29",
    "[ fe / h ] @xmath30 , there are examples of stars that are associated with either .    for the above reasons",
    ", we suggest that the very best stars to place constraints on the nature of the cemp - no progenitors are the ump stars with metallicities between @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "unfortunately , such stars are still exceedingly rare @xcite . even though their numbers have increased considerably over the last decade ( 21 stars according to * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , many more are needed , in order to fully understand the nature of their stellar progenitors and the associated nucleosynthesis processes .    in this paper",

    "we use the newly derived abundance pattern of , along with literature data for 11 other ump and hyper metal - poor ( hmp ; [ fe / h ] @xmath36 ) stars , to assess evidence in support of the conclusion in paper  i that cemp - no stars require more than one class of stellar progenitors .",
