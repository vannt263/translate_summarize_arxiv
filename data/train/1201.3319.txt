    "as one of the nearest powerful radio - loud active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , cygnus a provides an excellent laboratory to study the environment and activity of powerful agn .",

    "higher energy integral observations show emission between @xmath17 and @xmath18 kev @xcite , although there may be some contamination from intracluster gas .",
    "this hard x - ray emission is likely due to accretion disk emission comptonized in the agn corona , although the uv / optical emission is obscured .",

    "however , a significant portion of the bolometric luminosity comes out in the infrared , via dust reprocessing of the uv / optical continuum .",
    "an accurate determination of the bolometric luminosity then requires an understanding of the contributions to the observed infrared luminosity .    in this paper , we present modeling of the sed of cygnus a. to accomplish this we combined new infrared measurements obtained by the spitzer space telescope s infrared spectrograph ( irs ; * ? ? ?",

    "we aim to reproduce the major features in the sed : the powerlaw emission at radio wavelengths , the strong thermal emission at infrared wavelengths , and the overall character of the silicate absorption . extrapolating the powerlaw from the radio to the infrared requires a modification of the powerlaw spectrum to avoid exceeding the observed mid - infrared flux .",
    "the infrared emission is thermal in nature , coming from dust at a variety of temperatures ranging from the cold ism ( @xmath125 k ) through hot dust near the agn , up to the sublimation temperature ( @xmath126 k ) .",
    "the power source for this dust heating is a combination of star formation and agn activity , with an uncertain balance between the two .",
    "as noted in the introduction previous studies of cygnus a have found evidence for simultaneous ongoing agn activity and star formation , both of which can contribute to the infrared emission .",
    "we model the continuum emission from @xmath127 ghz ( @xmath128 @xmath24 m ; see figure [ fig : sed ] ) using components to represent the agn torus model , a starburst , and synchrotron emission .",

    "smbh and accretion disk can be hidden from view along some lines of sight by an obscuring torus . along these obscured lines of sight",
    "the uv / optical radiation is absorbed and re - radiated in the mid- and far - infrared .",
    "as noted above , cygnus a shows evidence for a hidden blr through observations of h@xmath11 in polarized light .",
    "this suggests that cygnus a harbors a `` hidden '' accretion disk and a blr which is obscured along our line of sight .",
    "@xcite have constructed a model for an obscuring agn torus , where the obscuration is due to the presence of multiple clouds along the line of sight to the agn .",
    "we select this set of models because clumpy models seem to provide better fits to sil features than smooth dust distributions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in order to reproduce the observed ratio of type i / ii agns , the obscuring clouds collectively populate a rough toroidal structure with some opening angle .",
    "the clumpy torus model is specified by multiple geometrical parameters",
    ". the outer radius of the torus ( @xmath130 ) is @xmath131 times the inner radius ( @xmath132 ) , where the inner radius is determined from a dust sublimation temperature of @xmath133 k ( @xmath134 pc .",
    "@xmath135 is the bolometric luminosity of the agn in units of @xmath136 erg s@xmath10 ) .",
    "the geometry of the model is shown in figure [ fig : clumpygeom ] .",
    "the clumps have a gaussian angular distribution , with @xmath137 parameterizing the width of the angular distribution from the mid - plane .",
    "the radial distribution is a power law with index @xmath138 : @xmath139 .",
    "the inclination of the torus symmetry axis to the line of sight is @xmath140 and the average number of clouds along a given line of sight is @xmath141 .",
    "in addition to the geometrical parameters , the models also vary the optical depth of each clump ( @xmath142 ) , using the @xcite dust composition and @xcite grain size distribution .",
    "the overall scaling of the model flux is @xmath143 , the bolometric flux of the agn s accretion disk component ( treating the synchrotron emission separately ) .",
    "the clumpy nature of the obscuration implies that there is a finite probability of a direct line of sight to the blr , even at high inclinations .",
    "however , as cygnus a shows no evidence for directly observed broad lines , we have only fit models where the central regions are fully obscured along our line of sight .",
    "star formation is represented using the @xcite models which assume spherical symmetry and an ism with dust properties characteristic of the milky way .",
    "emission is broken down into two components : an old stellar population uniformly distributed through the volume and hot , luminous o and b stars embedded in dusty hot spots .",
    "the density of ob stars is centrally peaked although the model output is the emission integrated over the entire starburst .",
    "the free parameters for the model are : starburst radius @xmath144 , total luminosity @xmath145 , ratio of luminosity in o and b stars to total luminosity @xmath146 , visual extinction from the center to the edge of the nucleus @xmath147 , and dust density in hotspots around o and b stars @xmath148 .",
    "owing to the spherical symmetry of this starburst model and the known ring morphology of the star formation in cygnus a , parameters such as @xmath147 and the radius @xmath144 do not have straight forward interpretations here .",
    "the assumption of optically thick star formation does not have strong evidence ( either for or against ) , given the absence of high resolution far infrared observations .      the strong radio emission in cygnus a justifies the final model component .",
    "vla core fluxes are consistent with powerlaw emission to the submillimeter where thermal emission begins to dominate . extrapolating",
    "the powerlaw to higher frequencies suggests that the synchrotron spectrum must either be modified or subjected to attenuation .",
    "the agn is known to sit behind a dust lane with significant extinction ( @xmath149 ; * ? ? ?",
    "though some attenuation of the synchrotron flux is expected at higher frequencies , this alone is not sufficient to explain why the synchrotron powerlaw does not continue through the mid - infrared . with extinction alone ,",
    "the flux densities at 30 and @xmath150 m would be similar for the observed spectral index of @xmath110 .",
    "for @xmath151 , the expected flux from the extrapolated synchrotron emission would by itself exceed the measured infrared flux at 10@xmath152 .",
    "we conclude that there must be a break in the population of emitting electrons .",
    "one possible explanation is a simple cutoff in the population of relativistic electrons at some energy ( case i ) .",
    "this would manifest itself as a cutoff in the synchrotron spectrum :    @xmath153    where @xmath154 is the frequency corresponding to the cutoff in the energy distribution of the particles , @xmath155 is the spectral index in the optically thin regime , and @xmath156 is the dust screen between the synchrotron emitting region and the observer .",
    "@xmath156 follows @xcite .    in cygnus a the spectral index @xmath155 is measured from vla core radio fluxes , and the amplitude of the powerlaw fixed from the same observations .",
    "the only free parameters are the cutoff frequency @xmath154 and the optical depth @xmath157 .",
    "these parameters art partly degenerate in that in trial runs we experienced a situation where @xmath158 and @xmath154 would both increase , effectively offsetting each other . to combat this we limited @xmath158 such that @xmath147 does not exceed 500 towards the radio source .",
    "an alternate model for the synchrotron emission at higher frequencies is a broken powerlaw behind a dust screen ( case ii ) .",
    "aging of the population of relativistic electrons results in a broken powerlaw whose spectral index increases for frequencies higher than a break frequency @xcite .",
    "the functional form adopted is :    @xmath159    for a simple aging of the electron population , the post - break spectral index in cygnus a would be @xmath160 . as with case",
    "i , we fit a dust screen in front of the synchrotron emission ( @xmath158 ) .",
    "starlight can potentially contribute to the mid - infrared flux , especially in a large aperture . using the flux of the stellar component from @xcite and their brightness profile",
    ", we determined the contribution due to starlight in a @xmath0 aperture .",
    "the relative fluxes were consistent with an elliptical galaxy template from @xcite .",
    "expected flux densities at 2.2 , 5 , and 10 @xmath24 m were computed using the same template spectrum . after subtracting a nuclear point source , the k - band flux density in starlight is consistent with the flux in a @xmath0 aperture as measured using two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) data products @xcite . at 5 and 10 @xmath24 m ,",
    "the starlight contributes roughly 14% and 2% respectively , of the flux measured by irs .",
    "therefore , we do not include any contribution to the mid - infrared flux from an old stellar population in our modeling .",
    "warm dust in the nlr directly illuminated by the agn can also contribute to the mid- and far - infrared emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite find that a significant contribution to the mid - infrared flux can come from sources other than the agn torus , particularly additional hot dust . in cygnus a @xcite find an extended component to the mid - infrared emission which is consistent with @xmath161 k dust .",

    "dust of this temperature is well reproduced with our choice of starburst models ( with the implicit assumption that this dust is heated by star formation ) .",
    "higher temperature dust is also present in the inner regions of cygnus a. however the resolved mid - infrared images of the nuclear regions by @xcite are unable to distinguish between dust in the `` torus '' and dust in the nlr heated by the agn . without strong observational motivation for an additional dust component we opt not to include one .",
    "as will be shown in the next section we are able to reproduce the observed emission without this additional component .      prior to fitting the models ,",

    "this covers a range of star formation rates from @xmath193 to @xmath92 m@xmath2 yr@xmath10 , as determined by the @xmath4 calibration from @xcite ( for a review of sfr estimates , see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "@xmath194        roughly half the fits within this confidence interval have @xmath195% of the starburst luminosity in the form of ob stars .",
    "the distribution of size parameters is relatively flat , although even the largest sizes would be unresolved by our spitzer observations .",
    "the distribution of dust density @xmath148 peaks around @xmath196 @xmath197 .",
    "the extinction through this starburst is relatively unconstrained .",
    "the strengths of dust features in starburst models falling within the 95.4% confidence interval were also measured using pahfit to compare with the intensities of observed dust feature .",
    "figure [ fig : dust ] shows histograms of the predicted intensities from our models divided by the measured intensity from the irs spectrum .",
    "only dust features which are detected in the irs spectrum have been plotted . in general",
    "the agreement is good with most models matching the measured line intensities .",
    "however for some dust features a significant number of the models within the confidence interval predict emission in excess of what is observed . while a detailed comparison of the relative strengths of dust features is beyond the scope of the paper",
    ", we suggest the models are able to generally reproduce the dust features seen in the spectrum . the dust features which show the greatest discrepancy between observed fluxes and those predicted from the modeling ( @xmath41 , @xmath50 , and @xmath198 m ) comprise 3 of the 5 lowest signal - to - noise dust feature fits in the spectrum .",
    "the discrepancy may then be due to the difficulty of fitting low equivalent width dust features .",
    "pahfit also attempted to fit eight other dust features in the irs spectrum .",
    "the upper limits for three ( @xmath199 , @xmath200 , and @xmath201 m ) are consistent with expectations from the starburst models .",
    "one dust feature ( @xmath202 m ) has a measured limit below that expected from the best fitting starburst model , and so is discrepant .",
    "the other four features ( @xmath203 , @xmath204 , @xmath205 , and @xmath206 m ) also have upper limits from pahfit which are lower than the expected value from the starburst models . however , these are coincident with or near other spectral features ( e.g. , narrow emission lines or the sil absorption ) .",
    "thus an accurate measurement of these dust features in the irs spectrum would rely more heavily on fitting the wings , which could prove difficult in a continuum dominated source such as cygnus a.      the synchrotron emission amplitude was fixed using the non - thermal emission from the radio core , assuming it to be a point source at all frequencies observed .",
    "the synchrotron model , therefore , has only two parameters : cutoff frequency ( @xmath154 ) and extinction due to dust ( @xmath158 ) .",
    "the distribution of cutoff frequencies is somewhat broad , covering the range of @xmath207 thz ( @xmath208 m ) ( figure [ fig : synchist ] ) .",
    "the fits show a range of acceptable extinction for the dust screen , peaking in the range of @xmath209 , slightly lower than the predicted line of sight @xmath147 from the torus models .",
    "the integrated luminosity of the `` core '' synchrotron flux is log@xmath210 .",
    "this break in the synchrotron spectrum is consistent other powerful fr ii radio sources , where an extrapolation of the radio synchrotron emission significantly exceeds the observed optical flux ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in these cases , the similarity of the radio and x - ray spectral indices suggests that the x - ray may be produced by inverse compton ( ic ) scattering .    with the modeled synchrotron spectrum , a magnetic field strength , and the assumption that each electron emits at a single frequency",
    ", the energy distribution of relativistic electrons can be determined :    @xmath211    where all constants and values are in the cgs system of units .",
    "the magnetic field strength has been estimated from vlbi observations to be roughly @xmath212 mg ( @xmath18 mg ) in the jet ( core ) @xcite . using @xmath213 thz and equation [ eq : e - gamma ] we find @xmath214 ( @xmath215 ) for the jet ( core ) .",
    "in addition to radiating energy via synchrotron emission , relativistic electrons can also lose energy via ic scattering .",
    "the ratio of the energy lost through synchrotron to the energy lost to ic is simply given by the ratio of the magnetic and radiation energy densities , with the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) setting a minimum value for the radiation energy density .",
    "using the magnetic field strength assumed above ( @xmath212 mg ) , and @xmath216 k , synchrotron losses are dominant by a factor @xmath217 .",
    "a larger magnetic field would further enhance this ratio , so ic losses from scattering of cmb photons have a negligible effect on the population of relativistic particles .",
    "the range of best fit models for case ii is shown in figure [ fig : sedfit ] ( right ) .",
    "the best fit model had @xmath166/dof = @xmath218 .",

    "ii fits the bolometric accretion disk luminosity is roughly log@xmath219 ( median @xmath220 with an interquartile range of @xmath221 ) . the distribution of luminosities is more strongly peaked than for case i , with over 80% of fits occupying the log@xmath222 bin .",
    "a large torus ( @xmath174 ) is exclusively preferred , corresponding to @xmath223 pc ( using the median value for the luminosity ) . again , by design , the torus covering fraction is between 0.5 and 0.7 .",
    "an inclination of @xmath224 is exclusively preferred .",
    "the distribution of the average number of clumps along a line of sight @xmath141 is again bimodal with either large ( @xmath225 ) or small ( @xmath226 ) numbers of clouds preferred .",
    "the number of clouds is anti - correlated with the extinction through individual clouds .",
    "the spread in equatorial @xmath147 is somewhat large ( @xmath227 ) , but the line of sight @xmath147 is more constrained ( @xmath228 for 80% of fits ) .      the starburst component in case ii fits show qualitatively similar behavior to case i. the typical luminosity is comparable , but shows a smaller tail up to log@xmath229 ( @xmath230 of fits ) .",
    "other parameters are similar to those in case i fits , with the exception of the size which appears to have a very slight preference for a larger size , suggesting an overall cooler dust temperature for a given luminosity .",
    "this may indicate a degeneracy between the starburst and synchrotron models .",
    "the critical frequency for the synchrotron spectrum ( see the next section ) is at lower frequency for case ii , resulting in a smaller contribution to the far - infrared flux .",
    "the starburst model compensates with a larger overall size to provide additional cool dust emission ( for a given starburst luminosity ) .",
    "the dust feature strengths expressed in the models generally compare favorably with case i.      an alternate mechanism for limiting the influence of synchrotron emission at shorter wavelengths is for the spectrum to break at some frequency ( see section [ sec : sync - model ] ) .",
    "case ii fits used a fixed pre - break spectral index of @xmath231 and a post - break spectral index of @xmath160 , consistent with aging of the relativistic population ( without injection of additional particles ; * ? ? ?",
    "as the flux density decreases in a slower fashion when compared to an exponential cutoff , the powerlaw must break at lower frequencies to ensure that the observed mid - infrared flux is not exceeded .",
    "the break frequency is roughly 5 thz ( @xmath232 m ) .",
    "the unobscured synchrotron luminosity is found to be log@xmath233 .",
    "following the same arguments as case i , the electrons emitting at the break frequency have @xmath234 ( @xmath235 ) for jet ( core ) magnetic field values .",
    "again , this is consistent with the observed properties of jets in other fr ii radio sources .",
    "the extinction of the dust screen in front of the radio source is lower than case i fits , with @xmath236 , still within range of the extinction to the central source estimated by @xcite , but lower than the computed line of sight @xmath147 from the torus .",
    "the larger discrepancy compared with case i is due to the enhanced short wavelength emission of the broken power law at shorter wavelengths ( when compared to the case i exponential cutoff ) . the equatorial torus @xmath147 increases to provide an overall cooler temperature , and the modeled dust screen in front of",
    "the synchrotron component remains small ( in order to contribute sufficient flux at shorter wavelengths ) .",
    "our best estimate of the bolometric agn luminosity in cygnus a ( log@xmath237 , including the synchrotron component and x - ray emission ) is above the @xcite estimate using keck mid - infrared observations and a pg - quasar spectrum ( @xmath238 @xmath7 ) , but is somewhat below the estimates of @xcite who find @xmath239 @xmath7 ( although consistent with the low end of their range ) .",
    "the bolometric agn luminosity is the best constrained parameter , and is insensitive to the synchrotron model adopted .",
    "the kinetic power in the expansion of the radio lobes in cygnus a can be inferred from x - ray observations of the cluster environment @xcite . from this analysis of chandra observations",
    "cygnus a has a kinetic power of @xmath240 erg s@xmath10 ( log@xmath241 ) , a factor of three larger than the bolometric agn luminosity inferred from the modeling .",
    "given the uncertainties in the determinations of both the kinetic and bolometric power , it is unclear if the kinetic power dominates significantly over the power emitted as radiation .",
    "the probable torus sizes from the sed modeling give outer radii of @xmath242 pc ( @xmath243 at the distance of cygnus a ) .",
    "generally , the torus parameters provide reasonable estimates of the properties of the obscuring structure .",
    "this predicted outer radius is significantly larger than what is generally assumed to be reasonable for the obscuring torus .",
    "a torus with the angular diameter of the @xmath244 is well within range of multiple mid and near - infrared instruments . at large radii",
    ", the distinction between torus clouds and narrow line region clouds may be somewhat arbitrary .",
    "the observations by @xcite show extended emission on scales including and larger than our fit torus sizes .",
    "the degree of contamination by emission lines is unclear , and it would be interesting to attempt to obtain a line - free continuum image to ascertain the true size and shape of the continuum emitting region",
    ".    the torus size parameters are consistent with those found from modeling of the @xmath101 m sil feature by @xcite .",
    "their radiative transfer modeling suggested some torus properties similar to those presented here , namely a small inner radius ( @xmath245 pc ) and an inner - to - outer radius of @xmath246 .",
    "in contrast they find a steeper radial dependence for the dust distribution @xmath247 , possibly due to the use of a smooth dust distribution .    the preferred parameters for the obscuring torus ; low @xmath138 , high @xmath147 , and large @xmath131 suggest the model is being driven toward a cooler spectrum .",
    "this could influence the starburst component , leading to a lower inferred star formation rate . in order to combat this",
    "it would be beneficial to place tighter constraints on the far - infrared sed to enable better modeling of the star formation in cygnus a.    a comparison of our irs data with mid - infrared observations by @xcite is consistent with the suggestion of our model that at @xmath193 and @xmath248 m , the emission is dominated by the torus+synchrotron component .",
    "@xcite measure a k - band nuclear point source with @xmath249jy .",
    "this flux limit is broadly consistent with some model fits for the torus+synchrotron component .    for the estimated bolometric luminosity @xmath1 @xmath7 , and a black hole mass of @xmath250 @xmath9 ,",
    "the eddington ratio ( @xmath251 ) is @xmath252 .",
    "this is similar to , but slightly lower than previous estimates from @xcite , likely due to the fact that our model attributes some of the ir luminosity to the heating of dust from star formation .",
    "this starburst luminosity is relatively well constrained , with consistent values across the bulk of fits .",
    "the agn ( torus plus jet ) contributes @xmath253 of the infrared luminosity and star formation produces the remaining @xmath254 .      the results of our modeling can be tested and improved with the help of future observations in various wavelength regimes .    around 1 thz ( @xmath255 m )",
    "the synchrotron and starburst model components are of similar flux density , with the synchrotron contribution decreasing and the thermal contribution from star formation beginning to dominate .",
    "unfortunately , data at this location are limited in resolution , sensitivity , and wavelength coverage .",
    "disentangling the emission from the starburst and emission from the agn at this frequency will be possible with the atacama large millimeter array ( alma ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , particularly with the availability of band 10 and full science capabilities .",

    "this result can be tested by future mid - infrared polarimetry or variability studies .",
    "synchrotron emission from a compact source such as the radio core or jet knots should be subject to flaring .",
    "if the emission in this wavelength range is instead of a thermal origin ( e.g. , hot dust in the host galaxy ) , the @xmath150 m flux will remain relatively stable .",
    "using a combination of a new mid - infrared spectrum from the spitzer space telescope and radio data from the literature , the nuclear emission in cygnus a has been modeled as a combination of powerlaw emission from a synchrotron jet , reprocessed agn emission from a dusty torus , and emission from a dusty circumnuclear starburst .",
    "the data are well fit by a combination of these three models , and all three are necessary to reproduce the observed emission .",
    "statistically acceptable fits were found for both an exponential cutoff in the population of relativistic electrons ( case i ) as well as emission from an aging electron population ( case ii ) , however we are unable to distinguish between the two cases .",
