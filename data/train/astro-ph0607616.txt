    "following on the discovery of the anomalous absorption of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) at 4.83 ghz by gas - phase ortho - formaldehyde ( h@xmath0co ) molecules in a few nearby galactic dark nebula @xcite , several surveys were carried out in hopes of establishing the general galactic distribution of distant dusty molecular clouds containing gaseous h@xmath0co .",
    "@xcite used the nrao 140-foot telescope ( beam fwhm @xmath9 , system temperature t@xmath10 k ) to survey 30 positions spread out along the galactic plane near @xmath11 in the range @xmath12 and chosen to be free of radio continuum emission . with the exception of the one position near to the galactic center ( which did indeed appear to have continuum emission in the general area ) , no detections of cmb absorption",
    "could be registered , with a typical peak limits ( 5@xmath13 ) of 0.07 k in a velocity channel of width 1.6 km s@xmath14 .",
    "gordon & roberts concluded either that the excitation temperature of the general galactic distribution of h@xmath0comust be close to the brightness temperature of the cmb ( now known to be 2.73 k ) , or that the dust clouds harboring the h@xmath0co  must be much smaller than the telescope beam .",
    "this disappointing result was corroborated with additional observations by @xcite using the 25-m radio telescope of the onsala space observatory ( oso ) in sweden ( fwhm @xmath15 , t@xmath16 k ) in order to map three @xmath17 fields in the galactic plane at @xmath18 , and @xmath19 .",
    "spectra were obtained in each of these fields on a grid with separation @xmath3 .",
    "no emission or absorption was found , with a typical peak limit of 0.15 k in a 0.62 km s@xmath14  channel .",
    "the first large - scale survey for h@xmath0co  along the galactic plane was carried out by @xcite using the jodrell bank mark ii radio telescope ( fwhm @xmath20 , t@xmath21 k ) .",
    "observations were made at @xmath11 every @xmath22 of galactic longitude in the range @xmath23 and every @xmath24 in the range @xmath25 .",
    "these observations were successful in recording h@xmath0coabsorption in the inner galaxy , and some approximate information on the spatial distribution was obtained .",
    "however , the signal dropped to undetectable levels beyond @xmath26 , and no observations were attempted in the outer galaxy . in fact , at no position did the absorption - line profile depth exceed the observed continuum temperature .",
    "one can therefore safely conclude that what was being measured was not the anomalous cmb absorption ( which was still apparently too weak ) , but rather absorption of the galactic background radio radiation , which is strongest in the inner galaxy .",
    "although gaseous h@xmath0co  may be nearly absent in parts of the ism because it is dissociated or frozen out on grains , these early surveys provided an indication that the physical conditions under which detectable anomalous h@xmath0co  absorption occurs may not be common in the galaxy .",
    "observers turned their attention to other , more easily detected molecules , notably co , and we now have extensive surveys of the co(1 - 0 ) line over large sections of the galactic plane @xcite . these surveys , along with many detailed studies of specific molecular clouds in a wide range of molecular tracers , have all contributed to a much more complete ( and much more complicated ) view of physical conditions in the cool molecular ism .",
    "an explanation for the anomalous cmb absorption by h@xmath0co  was first suggested by @xcite using a classical calculation for collisional excitation",
    ". subsequent work , especially by evans and his collaborators @xcite , confirmed this result using quantum mechanical calculations and observations .",
    "the collisional pumping mechanism is more effective at high collision rates , so in general the absorption is strongest at higher densities and temperatures .",
    "however , the calculations by @xcite showed that the mechanism would still be effective at rather low temperatures , below about 10k .",
    "more precise quantum mechanical calculations reported by @xcite suggested a smaller effect at very low kinetic temperatures , but both methods involved approximations .",
    "this leaves open the possibility that high - density , cold clumps of molecular gas in the ism may be detectable in h@xmath0co  absorption , and has provided part of the motivation for our observing program .",
    "our approach is to carry out long integrations at a set of blindly - selected positions in the general direction of the galactic anticenter . for these observations",
    "we have again used the 25-m oso radio telescope at onsala , the same telescope used by gordon & hglund more than 33 years ago in their failed attempt to detect the general h@xmath0co  cmb absorption .",
    "our present success is due entirely to the availability of more sensitive receivers and to generous allocations of observing time on this telescope .",
    "our survey has two main features : first , it is a `` blind '' survey ; we purposely avoided using maps of any other ism tracer to construct the observing program .",
    "second , we chose to observe in the galactic anticenter region , i.e. in the general direction of the outer galaxy .",
    "the galactic nonthermal background at 6 cm is exceedingly faint in this direction , so we can be fairly confident that any absorption we might detect is indeed anomalous cmb absorption .",
    "we will return to this point later .",
    "also , the velocity gradient owing to galactic rotation is small in the anticenter direction , so we might hope for some degree of `` bunching '' of absorption features , enhancing the probability of detection .",
    "the observations were obtained during two sessions , the first in september - october 2004 , and the second in may 2005 , with the 25 m onsala radio telescope . at 6 cm ,",
    "the angular resolution of the telescope is fwhm @xmath27 , and the pointing precision is better than @xmath28 .",
    "the local oscillator was operated in frequency - switching mode with a `` throw '' of 0.8 mhz , and both ( circular ) polarizations of the incoming signal were recorded simultaneously in two independent units of a digital autocorrelator spectrometer .",
    "each of these units provided 800 channels spaced by 4 khz . at the frequency of the 1@xmath29 - 1@xmath30 line of ortho - h@xmath0co  ( 4829.660 mhz ) ,",
    "this setup provided a total bandwidth of 3.2 mhz = 199 km s@xmath14 and a ( twice - hanning - smoothed ) velocity resolution of 16 khz = 0.99 km s@xmath14 .",
    "daily observations of cas a were made in order to check the overall performance of the receiver .",
    "the system temperature during our sessions varied from 33 to 36 k. the off - line data reduction was done with the class / gildas software system @xcite , and involved only the subtraction of ( flat ) baselines from individual integrations and the averaging of all spectra taken at the same pointing position .",
    "the total integration time at each pointing position was @xmath31 hours , yielding a final typical rms noise level of 0.0035 k ( t@xmath32 ) and a 5@xmath13 detection limit of 0.0175 k in each @xmath33 km s@xmath14  channel .      for our blind search , integrations were made every @xmath3 in 11 strips perpendicular to the galactic plane from @xmath34 to @xmath35 at intervals of @xmath22 in galactic longitude from @xmath36 to @xmath37 .",
    "the spectrometer was centered at a slightly different systemic velocity for each strip ( cf .",
    "table [ table : velocity ] ) , following the expected run of radial velocity according to the `` standard '' model of rotation in the outer galaxy using hi data from @xcite .",
    "cccccccccccc longitude ( deg . ) & 170 & 172 & 174 & 176 & 178 & 180 & 182 & 184 & 186 & 188 & 190 + velocity ( km s@xmath14 ) & -12 & -9.7 & -8.5 & -7.3 & -5.4 & -3.1 & -1.0 & 1.4 & 3.1 & 4.3 & 6.2    the final ( averaged ) spectra are shown as a mosaic in figure [ fig : blindsearch ] .",
    "there is clear evidence for absorption in 10  12 positions , and hints of absorption in several more .",
    "it is evident that , with our increased level of sensitivity , we have successfully detected h@xmath0co  absorption at roughly 10% of the total of 143 positions observed .",
    "it is also interesting to note that we have not recorded any h@xmath0co  emission ; this may indicate that very dense gas with @xmath38 ( see  [ sec : discussion ] ) is rare , with a low area filling factor , and/or the gas is much colder than about 10 k. for reference , figure [ fig : blindsearch ] also shows the disposition of our survey positions with respect to the co emission obtained from the survey by @xcite .",
    "we will return to this comparison later , but we wish to emphasize here that our choice of h@xmath0cosurvey positions took no prior account of the distribution of co emission .",
    "nevertheless , it is clear from this figure that the h@xmath0co  absorption is seen most strongly in regions of strong co emission .",
    "figure [ fig : blindsearch ] also shows regions of faint co emission without corresponding h@xmath0co  absorption ; for instance several survey points at @xmath39 are located in a region of faint co emission .",
    "the absence of h@xmath0co  absorption at such positions is likely to be a reflection of the sensitivity limit of our observations .",
    "the presence of two regions of relatively strong absorption can be identified in figure [ fig : blindsearch ] , the first at @xmath40 , and the second at @xmath41 .",
    "we have mapped these two regions in more detail in order to examine the distribution of h@xmath0co  absorption and to permit a point - by - point comparison with the existing co(1 - 0 ) emission surveys in this region of the galaxy .",
    "the receiver settings for these two maps were identical to those used for the blind survey , and the total integration times per pointing position were similarly long .",
    "figure [ fig : firstmosaic]a ( left panel ) shows profiles at 63 of 66 positions on a grid centered ( position 0,0 ) at @xmath42 , @xmath11 , with an interval of @xmath3 .",
    "similarly , figure [ fig : secondmosaic]a ( left panel ) shows profiles at 101 of 121 positions on a grid centered ( position 0,0 ) at @xmath43 , @xmath11 , also with an interval of @xmath3 .",
    "how can we be sure that the absorption we have recorded , both in our blind search and in our two detailed maps , is actually absorption of the cmb ?",
    "we have earlier argued that it is not likely to be absorption of the galactic nonthermal background , since this background is very faint in the outer galaxy at 6 cm , so we can confidently rule out the type of absorption recorded in the inner galaxy by @xcite .",
    "but what about discrete continuum sources in the background , perhaps distant  regions or radio galaxies ? in order to examine this possibility ,",
    "we have retrieved radio continuum survey data at 21-cm from @xcite covering the two regions we have mapped in detail .",
    "figure [ fig:21 cm ] shows the 21-cm continuum in these two regions observed with the effelsberg 100-m telescope at a resolution of @xmath44 ( contours ) overlaid on our h@xmath0co  absorption data ( grey scale , resolution @xmath27 ) . from the general lack of correspondence of the radio continuum peaks with the h@xmath0co  absorption maxima",
    "we can safely conclude that it is indeed the cmb absorption we have recorded in h@xmath0co .",
    "furthermore , the continuum sources are either behind the h@xmath0co  absorbers , or the area filling factor of the absorbing clouds is small and the line of sight to the sources just misses the clouds .      our blind search has succeeded in recording anomalous h@xmath0coabsorption at approximately 10% of the survey positions .",
    "this is a significant improvement over the earlier blind searches of @xcite and @xcite , which failed to record any such absorption .",
    "since we have no reason to believe that the regions chosen for the early searches are in any way peculiar , we conclude that our success is likely due to the large improvement in sensitivity of our observations .",
    "our rms noise level is typically 0.0035 k ( t@xmath32 ) for a 5@xmath13 detection limit of 0.0175 k. when compared at the same velocity resolution , this is an improvement of @xmath45 over the observations of @xcite and a factor @xmath46 over those of @xcite .",
    "this result strongly suggests that the detection rate is simply sensitivity limited , and that it would increase with further increases in sensitivity .",
    "future searches would benefit from using larger telescope apertures with more collecting area ; beam dilution would also be reduced on the more distant dust clouds .",
    "we have retrieved the co(1 - 0 ) emission line data for our two mapped fields from the survey by @xcite , smoothed that data slightly from its original @xmath47 resolution to the @xmath3 resolution of our h@xmath0co  observations , and extracted profiles at the same positions as on our maps near @xmath42 , @xmath11 and @xmath43 , @xmath11 .",
    "the results are shown in the right panels of figure [ fig : firstmosaic ] and figure [ fig : secondmosaic ] .",
    "a cursory inspection of these mosaics shows that there is an overall general correlation between the two tracers , in particular , at every position where we have detected h@xmath0co , co(1 - 0 ) emission is also detected .",
    "the converse is not always true ; there are many positions where co(1 - 0 ) is easily detected which show no corresponding h@xmath0co  above the noise .",
    "although this may simply be a consequence of a lower s / n for the h@xmath0co  observations , a more detailed look at these profiles reveals that s / n is not the whole story . in particular ,",
    "the h@xmath0co  absorption profiles are not merely scaled versions of the co(1 - 0 ) emission profiles .",
    "consider the profiles on the mosaic of figure [ fig : secondmosaic ] at @xmath43 , in particular those at ( -20,+10 ) , ( -10,+10 ) , and ( 0,+10 ) . in h@xmath0co",
    "this sequence of 3 profiles shows a uniform decrease in the depth of the absorption from about -0.05 to -0.04 to -0.03 k , but in co the emission profiles peak at about 6 , 7 , and 6 k respectively .",
    "another way of showing the general correlation between co and h@xmath0co  is depicted in figures [ fig : firstcomparison ] and [ fig : secondcomparison ] , which show contour maps of the two components in a latitude - velocity plot integrated over a small range in longitude . figure [ fig : firstcomparison ]",
    "shows the two velocity components in this region , a weaker component at @xmath48 km s@xmath14 , and a stronger component at @xmath49 km s@xmath14 .",
    "figure [ fig : secondcomparison ] shows the data for the region centered at @xmath43 in the same latitude - velocity presentation .",
    "the principal component here is observed at @xmath50 km s@xmath14 . these figures confirm the general similarity of the co emission and the h@xmath0co  absorption .",
    "the h@xmath0co  cmb absorption clearly generally traces the same molecular gas seen in the more ubiquitous ( and easier to observe ) co molecule .    a general correspondence of h@xmath0co  and @xmath51co(1 - 0 )",
    "was also noted by @xcite in their extensive mapping study of h@xmath0co  and oh in the orion region .",
    "those authors found a broad general agreement in that well - known star - forming region , but concluded that the detailed agreement was poor .",
    "they found a better correspondence with @xmath52co(1 - 0 ) , and concluded that the reason for this was that the optically - thick @xmath51co(1 - 0 ) line was primarily tracing gas temperature , whereas the @xmath52co(1 - 0 ) emission and the h@xmath0co  absorption are both optically - thin lines that will trace primarily the density . in general",
    "we agree with this interpretation , although as we will discuss in more detail later the dependence of the h@xmath0co  absorption on kinetic temperature is also likely to be playing a role .    in order to study the relation between h@xmath0co  absorption and co(1 - 0 ) emission in more detail , we have computed the moments of the profiles shown in figures [ fig : firstmosaic ] and",
    "[ fig : secondmosaic ] .",
    "the results are listed in tables [ table : mom182 ] and [ table : mom190 ] ( _ see the electronic version of this paper _ ) .",
    "if two components are visible at a given pointing , the moments for each have been computed separately ; in many cases a second component was too weak to be identified in h@xmath0co .",
    "components that exceed the @xmath53 limit are indicated in column 6 of these tables and their values plotted in the correlation diagram of figure [ fig : intensityratio ] .",
    "since the data in the two fields did not seem to show any different trends , we have included the profile intensities from both fields in figure [ fig : intensityratio ] .",
    "we have fitted the data in figure [ fig : intensityratio ] by least squares to a straight line ; the result is :    @xmath54    yielding a value of @xmath55 and @xmath56 . while the fit is not bad , in several cases the data points lie significantly off the best - fit line .",
    "we will return to this point in the discussion below .      in order to have some idea of the distances to our detections ,",
    "we have searched the catalog of star - forming regions in the galaxy @xcite for objects at known distances which may be associated with them .",
    "table [ table : iras ] lists several iras sources which are candidates , and their associated distances .",
    "these distances were obtained from the references listed in the table , and were determined from optical (  regions ) and radio spectroscopy ( co(1 - 0 ) in molecular clouds ) and using a model rotation curve of the outer galaxy .",

    "we conclude that the correspondence is only marginal , but the results suggest that the regions we have found are likely to be located at distances of 1.5 - 3 kpc , probably in the perseus arm of the galaxy ( 2  3 kpc from the sun ) . in that case",
    "our @xmath3 beam corresponds to a linear resolution of 4 - 9 pc .",
    "the general correlation between the integrated line intensities of the co(1 - 0 ) emission and the h@xmath0co  absorption suggests that the excitation characteristics of these two lines are similar .",
    "in fact , both of these lines trace warm , dense molecular gas , as various calculations have shown in many historical papers . for instance , @xcite show examples of emergent brightness calculations for co(1 - 0 ) in the galactic gmc lynds 1204 in the context of one popular model ( the large - velocity - gradient model ) .",
    "as their figure 1 shows , the observed brightness of this ( usually optically - thick ) line is essentially proportional to the kinetic temperature of the gas as long as the density exceeds the critical density of @xmath57 .",
    "it follows that any sensitivity - limited co(1 - 0 ) survey will therefore preferentially record the warm , dense regions of the ism .",
    "the details of h@xmath0co  6-cm line formation have been studied for example in several papers by evans and co - workers ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the 6 cm absorption line arises through collisions to higher rotational levels followed by radiative decay to the ground level , which becomes overpopulated owing to small differences in collision cross sections .",
    "the line is therefore generally stronger if the collision rate is higher , so this too favors warm , dense clouds .",
    "however , the absorption line is quenched at very high collision rates , when the level populations approach a boltzmann distribution , and the 6 cm line then goes into emission . in a future paper on h@xmath0co",
    "mapping of the large galactic dust cloud lynds 1204 @xcite we will present model computations of h@xmath0co  absorption in more detail . for the moment we note that the 6 cm absorption is strongest in the density range of @xmath58 . in our model",
    "the absorption is deepest at @xmath59 , first appearing at @xmath60 k , and saturating at @xmath61 k in the sense that the absorption hardly increases for higher temperatures .",
    "this dependence on kinetic temperature is therefore somewhat different than is the case for the co(1 - 0 ) line ; this is mostly a consequence of the fact that the h@xmath0coline remains optically thin , so it more closely reflects the specific excitation conditions .",
    "one of the premises for doing the blind search for h@xmath62co towards the galactic anticenter was the possibility of finding molecular gas in regions where co emission had not previously been detected .",
    "this could potentially reveal a component of the molecular gas characterized by an excitation temperature lower than that corresponding to the energy level of the first rotational transition of co ( or any other commonly observed molecule ) .",
    "such an excitationally cold molecular gas component would only be observable in absorption , either against a continuum background source or , when using the anomalous absorption of h@xmath62co , against the cmb .",
    "the fact that we do not see h@xmath62co absorption outside the regions where co emission is observed , suggests that either such cold molecular gas is not present , or , as we will argue , the anomalous h@xmath62co absorption is not sensitive to excitationally cold molecular gas .    as shown by townes & cheung ( 1969 ) and evans et al .",
    "( 1975 ) , the anomalous h@xmath62co absorption is due to collisional pumping and most effective at densities between @xmath63 @xmath8 .",
    "our observations of the 6-cm h@xmath62co line therefore seem to exclude the existence of dense molecular gas outside the regions probed by co emission . however , the effectiveness of the collisional pumping at low temperatures has not been decisively determined ( cf .",
    "evans 1975 ; garrison et al .",
    "1975 ) , and we can not exclude the possibility of very cold molecular gas outside the co emission regions , even if it meets the density requirement for inversion . in rodriguez et al .",
    "( 2006 ) we found that the effectiveness of the collisional pumping leading to the anomalous excitation of the 6-cm h@xmath62co transition is indeed temperature dependent , requiring a relatively high temperature .",
    "the combined requirement of a high temperature and density in order to render the anomalous h@xmath62co absorption line observable means that whenever present , the h@xmath62co absorption and co emission lines will be spatially co - existing .",
    "hence , the 6-cm h@xmath62co absorption seen against the cmb is not a viable tracer of cold molecular gas .",
    "this is discussed in more detail in rodriguez et al .",
    "* we have successfully detected anomalous cmb absorption by h@xmath0co - bearing dust clouds at @xmath4 of our blind survey positions in the direction of the outer galaxy .",
    "no emission profiles were found . *",
    "our success is likely due to the large improvement in sensitivity of our observations over that of earlier surveys .",
    "this strongly indicates that the detection statistics will improve further if even higher - sensitivity searches are carried out .",
    "since the absorption signal strength from more distant clouds will suffer from increasing beam dilution , future searches ought to be done with larger radio telescopes .",
    "* h@xmath62co absorption and co emission lines are spatially co - existing .",
    "all observed h@xmath0co  absorption features were associated with know co emission .",
    "* we have found a rough correspondence between the h@xmath0co  and the @xmath51co(1 - 0 ) line fluxes in detailed maps of two regions in our survey area .",
    "we have argued that both lines generally trace warm , dense gas in the ism , with the situation for co(1 - 0 ) being somewhat simpler owing to the fact that this line is usually optically thick .",

    "<S> we have carried out a blind search in the general direction of the galactic anticenter for absorption of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation near 4.83 ghz by molecular clouds containing gaseous ortho - formaldehyde ( h@xmath0co ) . </S>",
    "<S> the observations were done using the 25-m radio telescope at onsala in sweden , and covered strips in galactic latitude @xmath1 at several longitudes in the region @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> spectra were obtained in these strips with a grid spacing corresponding to the telescope resolution of @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we have detected h@xmath0co  cmb absorption at @xmath4 of the survey pointings . </S>",
    "<S> this detection rate is likely to increase with further improvements in sensitivity , and may become comparable to the detection rate expected from a blind co survey with a corresponding sensitivity limit . </S>",
    "<S> we have mapped some of these detections in more detail and compared the h@xmath0co  absorption to existing maps of co(1 - 0 ) emission in the same regions . </S>",
    "<S> there appears to be a rough correlation between the velocity - integrated line strength of the co(1 - 0 ) emission and that of the h@xmath0co  absorption . </S>",
    "<S> however , the scatter in this correlation is significantly larger than the measurement errors , indicating differences of detail at and below the linear resolution of our observations ( @xmath5 pc ) . </S>",
    "<S> although these two tracers are expected to have similar excitation requirements on the microscopic level characteristic of warm , t@xmath6k , dense , @xmath7 @xmath8 condensations in molecular clouds , the co(1 - 0 ) line is expected to be optically thick , whereas the h@xmath0co  line is not . </S>",
    "<S> this latter difference is likely to be responsible for a significant part of the scatter in the correlation we have found . </S>"
