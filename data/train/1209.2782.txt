    "in addition , a mass should relate to the gravity .",
    "for this reason , the ordinary chiral condensate and the dressed polyakov loop have a different dependence for the current mass in the crossover region ( the difference increases with the increasing current mass in the flat space ) , and the positive ( negative ) curvature reduces ( enhances ) the contribution of the current mass .",
    "incidentally , since the difference with increasing curvature for small values of @xmath97 is very small , light particles are scarcely affected by the gravitational effect . thus , the gravitational effect should become effective for heavy particles , such as @xmath7 quark .",
    "due to using the model having no a gluon , only a quark is taken into account in this paper . however , qcd has the gluon dynamics , and a gluon relates to confinement .",
