    "chemical features observed in galaxies can store fossil records of their history of formation since they are the result of different physical mechanisms acting at different stages of evolution @xcite . among them , galaxy interactions and mergers are considered important processes which can affect the star formation activity significantly as has been reported by numerous works ( e.g. @xcite ) . the link of interactions and mergers with chemical properties have been recently started to be addressed ( @xcite ) .",
    "recently , @xcite found the metallicity in the nuclear regions of galaxies in very close pairs to be displaced to lower levels than those measured in more distant pairs and isolated galaxies .",
    "the authors claimed this effect to be caused by gas inflows triggering by the interactions .    in this letter , we study the mass - metallicity relation ( mzr , @xcite ) of close galaxy pairs as a tool to study the effects of interactions on metallicity . in the local universe , @xcite have confirmed the dependence of metallicity on stellar mass with high stastistical signal .",
    "@xcite has extended the study to high redshift finding a similar correlation , although displaced to lower metallicity ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the luminosity - metallicity relation ( lmr ) has been also well estimated in local universe when stellar masses are not possible to measure .",
    "however , it has been shown that luminosity is a less fundamental parameter than mass ( e.g. @xcite ) . despite these new results ,",
    "the origin of the mzr and its evolution remain unclear .",
    "mergers and interactions could play an important role in shaping the mzr .",
    "hence , a statistical analysis of the effects of interactions on chemical properties could help to shed light on this issue .",
    "numerical simulations showed how tidal interactions can trigger star formation activity and can modify the morphology of galaxies ( e.g. @xcite and references therein ; @xcite ) .",
    "gas inflows generated during these interactions feed star formation activity ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite showed that simulated galaxies in the concordance @xmath8-cdm cosmology reproduce the shape of the mzr but not its evolution .",
    "part of the failure could be caused by the lack of supernova ( sn ) feedback in these simulations .",
    "in fact , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , resorting to ad - hoc parametrizations for sn feedback model , claimed to be able to reproduce the observed mzr in a cosmological context .",
    "we performed a statistical analysis of the chemical properties of galaxies in pairs selected from the sdss - dr4 , focusing on the mzr .",
    "since it is already clear that proximity is the main parameter associated to important increases in the star formation activity , hereafter , we will centre our analysis on close galaxy pairs .",
    "these pairs have been reclassified according to the level of morphological disturbances detected by inspection of their images in merging , tidal and non - perturbed @xcite .",
    "merging pairs are those exhibiting the higher level of star formation activity .",
    "this letter is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we described the galaxy samples .",
    "section 3 discussed the results .",
    "the conclusions summarize the main findings .",
    "the main sdss galaxy sample is essentially a magnitude limited spectroscopic sample _ _ @xmath9__@xmath10 with most of the galaxies spanning a redshift range @xmath11 with a median redshift at 0.1 @xcite . following ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , we selected galaxy pairs by requiring members to have a relative projected separation @xmath12  kpc  @xmath1 and a relative radial velocity @xmath13  km  s@xmath14 .    in order to properly assess the significance of the results obtained from the pair catalogue , we defined a control sample by a monte carlo algorithm that selects for each galaxy in a pair , two galaxies with similar redshift and r - band luminosity but without a close companion within the adopted relative velocity and separation thresholds .",
    "this procedure assures that the control catalogue has the same selection effects than the pair sample , and consequently , it can be used to estimate the actual difference between galaxies in pairs and in isolation .",
    "@xcite discussed possible effects of aperture and incompleteness , which were found to have no significant consequences in the analysis .",
    "active galactic nuclei ( agn ) could contribute to the emission spectral features affecting our interpretation .",
    "hence , agns had not been included in neither the control nor the pair catalogues .    as mentioned above",
    ", we focus our analysis on the close galaxy pairs defined as those with a relative projected separation @xmath15  kpc  @xmath1 .",
    "these pairs are subclassified accordingly to the level of morphological disturbances in non - disturbed ( n - type ) , tidal ( t - type ) and merging ( m - type ) pairs as discussed by @xcite .",
    "m - type pairs show clear and strong signals of interactions and have active star formation . for completeness",
    ", we have also included the estimations for more distant pairs , @xmath16  kpc  @xmath17  kpc  @xmath1 ( d - type ) .    for the ssds - dr4 , @xcite estimated gas - phase oxygen abundance , @xmath18log o / h , and derived stellar masses ( @xmath19 ) . in table",
    "[ table1 ] , we show the numbers of pairs and galaxies in the different samples which have oxygen abundances measured for both members or for only one member .",
    "pairs with only one member with oxygen estimations have been used to improve the statistics , when possible .",
    ".number of pairs and galaxies in the different samples used in this work ( @xmath20 total number of pairs ; @xmath21 number of pairs with oxygen abundances measured for both members ; @xmath22 number of galaxies with oxygen abundances estimated for at least one member ) [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table1 ]",
    "in fig .  [ meanmzr ] , we show the mean mzr and lzr for galaxies in m , t , n and d - type pairs and the control sample .",
    "we also plot the fit to the observed mzr given in eq .  3 by @xcite , and the mean value of the observed lzr ( also given by @xcite ) .",
    "it can be appreciated that our different samples are in general agreement with these mean relations except for m - type pairs . for this sample , at low stellar mass , or low luminosity , there is a significant excess in the gas - phase metallicity with respect to the other samples and mean observed values of @xcite .",
    "conversely , at high mass ( or high luminosity ) , we find m - type pairs galaxies to have slightly smaller metallicity .",
    "this behaviour is in agreement with the results reported by @xcite .",
    "these authors found a decrease in the metallicity in the nuclear region of galaxies in close pairs which had members with luminosities consistent with our high luminosity end .",
    "we have also explored the dependence of the mzr on galaxy concentration for the samples analised finding a similar behaviour irrespective of galaxy concentration ( here concentration is defined as the ratio of petrosian 9050 per cent r - band light radii ) . since the concentration parameter is well correlated to morphology ( see however @xcite for a detailled discussion of the relation of morphology and other galaxy properties ) , this result indicates that our findings are not merely a morphology - induced effect .    the change in the slope of the mzr of m - type pairs as a function of @xmath19 shown in fig .",
    "[ meanmzr ] suggests a possible dependence of the effects of interactions on the stellar mass of the members .",
    "hence , we splitted the pair samples into minor and major interaction subsamples by adopting a ratio of 0.20 between the corresponding stellar masses .",
    "we studied the mzr and star formation activity for each component in major and minor interactions in the four defined pair samples .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ minormajor ] , two cases depart considerably from the global relation given by @xcite",
    ". galaxies in major interactions ( fig .",
    "[ minormajor]a ) , which show a lower metallicity , and the small component of minor interactions ( fig .",
    "[ minormajor]c ) with strong disturbances ( m - type ) which exhibit a significantly larger mean metallicity at a given stellar mass .",
    "these results suggest that in major interactions , there is an efficient inflow of pristine gas from the external regions of the halo .",
    "we argue that the lack of an effect for the large component ( @xmath23 ) in minor interactions may reside on the relatively weak perturbation these galaxies are subject to . on the contrary",
    "the small component ( @xmath24 ) of minor interactions are the ones mostly disturbed by the interactions and therefore those subject to major episodes of star formation and metallicity enhancement .",
    "we argue that the ratio between the stellar masses of the galaxies involved in an interaction is an important parameter in setting the metallicity content of galaxies . to explore this ,",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ hist ] ( upper panel ) that the metallicity difference ( @xmath25 ) between the less massive and the most massive components in m - type minor interactions is significantly reduced in comparison to that of galaxies in n - type pairs ( similar to d - type pairs ) .",
    "members of major interactions in m - type pairs have similar metallicity differences than those of n - type pairs ( lower panel in fig .  [ hist ] ) .",
    "an analysis of the star formation activity indicates that metal - rich less massive members in m - type pairs are in general also those exhibiting a high star formation activity , at a given stellar mass .",
    "this somewhat expected result reinforces the idea that minor components in strong interactions are likely to have experienced strong gas shocks leading to star formation and enrichment .    in order to further assess the role of the relative mass ratio of the galaxy members on the mean gas - phase metallicity , we calculated the metallicity excess ( @xmath26 ) as the difference between the oxygen abundance of a given galaxy in a pair and the mean abundance of galaxies in the control sample with similar stellar mass as a function of the ratio between the stellar mass of the companion ( @xmath27 ) galaxy and the stellar mass of the given galaxy ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "we estimated @xmath29 for all subsamples . in fig .",
    "[ dglplot ] , we display the results corresponding to pairs in the m - type and d - type subsamples since these galaxies set the range of variation . as it can be appreciated , in m - type pairs , galaxies with massive companion ( log @xmath30 ) have significantly enhanced their metallicity with respect to galaxies in the control sample with the same stellar mass .",
    "the opposite occurs for galaxies with a less massive companion ( log @xmath31 ) where the metallicity is lower .",
    "conversely , d - type pairs exhibit a remarkable consistency with the control sample .",
    "the behaviour of m - type pairs stresses that the relative mass ratio plays a major role in determining the metallicity properties in galaxies in strong interactions .",
    "we analyse the effects of interaction on the metallicity properties of galaxies . for this aim",
    "we have studied pairs of galaxies with projected separation @xmath32  kpc  @xmath1 and radial velocity @xmath33 from the sdss - dr4 and oxygen abundances from @xcite . using the visual classification of pairs into m - type , t - type , n - type , and d - type pairs of alonso et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , we find that pairs undergoing a strong interaction differ significantly on the mass metallicity relation in comparison to other pair categories and a control sample . in the low mass range ( m@xmath34m@xmath5 )",
    "the mean metallicity of galaxies in m - type pairs is 0.2 dex greater . on the contrary , at large masses ( m@xmath35m@xmath5 ) ,",
    "m - type pair galaxies have a systematically lower metallicity , although with a smaller difference ( @xmath36 dex ) .    when dividing the pairs into minor ( m@xmath37m@xmath38 ) and major ( m@xmath37m@xmath39 ) interactions , we find that the less massive member in strong minor interactions are always enriched irrespective of their mass . the interactions of galaxies of comparable stellar mass content have a systematically lower metallicity content , suggestive of an inflow of unenriched material from the external regions .",
    "we notice that the finite size of the fiber might affect the results in the sense that the smaller the angular size of the objects the larger the region where metallicity is derived .",
    "nevertheless , in this work we have considered galaxies of similar stellar masses and redshifts differing only on the presence of a companion . in order to analyse this effect on the mzr into more detail ,",
    "we have considered separately large and small angular size galaxies ( petrosian 90 per cent r - band light radius @xmath40  arcsec ) for the samples in fig .",
    "[ meanmzr ] .",
    "we find that the trends obtained in this work remain unchanged regardless of the apparent angular size of the galaxies .",
    "therefore , the results are robust against a combination of observational aperture and metallicity gradient in the galaxies",
    ".    we may interpret our results in terms of a combination of the effects of a metal - rich starburst induced by a massive component and the pristine gas inflow triggered by comparable or less massive companion galaxies .",
    "these two effects are expected naturally in current galaxy formation and evolution scenarios , so our findings may help to understand the origin and evolution of the mass - metalicity relation .",
