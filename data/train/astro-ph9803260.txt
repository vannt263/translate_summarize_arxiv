    "neutron stars have been the subject of considerable theoretical investigation since long before they were discovered as astronomical sources of radio and x - ray emission ( @xcite ) .",
    "their properties are determined by the interplay of all four known fundamental forces ",
    "electromagnetism , gravitation , and the strong and weak nuclear forces  but neutron stars remain sufficiently simple in their internal structure that realistic stellar modeling can be done .",
    "measurements of their masses and radii ( as well as detailed study of their cooling histories and rotational instabilities ) provide a unique window on the behavior of matter at densities well above that found in atomic nuclei ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "observations of neutron stars also provide our only current probe of general relativity ( gr ) in the `` strong - field '' regime , where gravitational self - energy contributes significantly to the stellar mass .",
    "the most precisely measured physical parameter of any pulsar is its spin frequency .",
    "the frequencies of the fastest observed pulsars ( psr  b1937 + 21 at 641.9  hz and b1957 + 20 at 622.1  hz ) have already been used to set constraints on the nuclear equation of state at high densities ( e.g. , @xcite ) under the assumption that these pulsars are near their maximum ( breakup ) spin frequency .",
    "however , the fastest observed spin frequencies may be limited by complex accretion physics rather than fundamental nuclear and gravitational physics .",
    "a quantity more directly useful for comparison with physical theories is the neutron star mass .",
    "the basis of most neutron star mass estimates is the analysis of binary motion .",
    "soon after the discovery of the first binary radio pulsar ( @xcite ) , it became clear that the measurement of relativistic orbital effects allowed extremely precise mass estimates .",
    "indeed , the measurement uncertainties in several cases now exceed in precision our knowledge of newton s constant @xmath3 , requiring masses to be quoted in solar units @xmath4 rather than kilograms if full accuracy is to be retained .",
    "after several recent pulsar surveys , there are now about fifty known binary radio pulsar systems , of which five or six are thought to contain two neutron stars .",
    "it is thus possible for the first time to consider compiling a statistically significant sample of neutron star masses .",
    "it is our purpose here to provide a general , critical review of all current estimates of stellar masses in radio pulsar binaries .",
    "the resulting catalog , with a careful , uniform approach to measurement and systematic uncertainties , should be of value both to those who wish to apply mass measurements to studies of nuclear physics , gr , and stellar evolution , and as a guide to the critical observations for observational pulsar astronomers .",
    "we begin with a discussion of known methods for pulsar mass determination (  [ sec : methods ] ) , including a new statistical technique for estimating the masses of millisecond pulsars in non - relativistic systems . in ",
    "[ sec : estimates ] we review all known mass estimates , including new data and analysis where possible .",
    "statistical analysis of the available pulsar mass measurements is presented in ",
    "[ sec : stat ] .",
    "we summarize in  [ sec : summ ] .",
    "a second paper will consider mass estimates for neutron stars in x - ray binary systems ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* paper  ii ) ) . a detailed discussion of the implications of the combined results of this work and paper  ii for studies of supernovae and neutron star formation , mass transfer in binary evolution , the nuclear equation of state , and gr will occur elsewhere ( paper  iii ) .",
    "it is a familiar circumstance that estimates of astronomical masses are available only for bodies in gravitationally bound binary systems or clusters .",
    "compact stars introduce the additional possibility of directly measuring the surface gravitational potential , and hence @xmath5 , through the study of redshifted spectral features .",
    "although this technique has been used with considerable success in the case of white dwarfs , and attempts have been made to fit redshifted x - ray spectra from neutron stars ( paper  ii ) , no lines have been identified in radio pulsar spectra and other gravitational effects on the observed emission from pulsars are sufficiently complex and theory dependent that no useful limits on the neutron star properties have yet been possible . in the following ,",
    "we thus limit ourselves only to the determination of stellar masses in binary systems .      in any binary pulsar system",
    ", five keplerian parameters can be very precisely measured by pulse timing techniques ( @xcite ) : the binary period @xmath6 , the projection of the pulsar s semimajor axis on the line of sight @xmath7 ( where the binary inclination @xmath8 is the angle between the line of sight and the orbital angular momentum vector , defined to lie in the first quadrant ) , the eccentricity @xmath9 , and the time and longitude of periastron , @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "it is frequently more convenient to use the orbital angular frequency in place of the orbital period : @xmath12 .",
    "these observational parameters are related to the pulsar and companion masses , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , through the mass function @xmath15 where @xmath16 , the masses are measured in solar units , and we introduce the constant @xmath17s .",
    "relativistic corrections to the binary equations of motion are most often parameterized in terms of one or more post - keplerian ( pk ) parameters ( @xcite ) . in gr ,",
    "the most significant pk parameters have familiar interpretations as the advance of periastron of the orbit @xmath18 , the combined effect of variations in the transverse doppler shift and gravitational redshift around an elliptical orbit @xmath19 , the orbital decay due to emission of quadrupole gravitational radiation @xmath20 , and the `` range '' and `` shape '' parameters @xmath21 and @xmath22 that characterize the shapiro time delay of the pulsar signal as it propagates through the gravitational field of its companion . in terms of measured quantities and the pulsar and companion masses ( in solar units ) ,",
    "these pk parameters are given by ( @xcite ) : @xmath23 note , by combining equations  ( [ eqn : massfunc ] ) and  ( [ eqn : pks ] ) , that @xmath24 for gr . )    the measurement of the mass function @xmath25 ( equation  [ eqn : massfunc ] ) together with any two pk parameters ( equations  [ eqn : pkomdot][eqn : pks ] ) is sufficient in the context of gr to uniquely determine the component masses @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "with additional assumptions , such as a uniform prior likelihood for orbital orientations with respect to the observer (  [ sec : uniform ] ) , strong statements about the posterior distribution of the masses is often possible if even a single pk parameter is measured .    as an alternative to the pk formalism , which is designed for testing gravitation theory , it is sometimes advantageous to fit the timing data to a model that _ assumes _ the correctness of gr .",
    "for example , the ddgr model of damour , deruelle , and taylor ( @xcite ) describes the pulsar phase as a function of the five keplerian parameters , the companion mass @xmath14 , and the total mass @xmath26 .",
    "a least - squares fit of the timing data to the ddgr model thus gives direct estimates of the uncertainties in @xmath14 and @xmath26 , as well as the covariances between the mass estimates and estimates of other parameters .",
    "it is of interest to note that mass measurements from pulsar timing observations depend on the unknown relative motion of the solar system and the binary barycenters .",
    "damour and deruelle ( 1986 ) have shown that neglecting this velocity is equivalent to changing units of mass and time .",
    "in particular , the rest frame mass @xmath27 and the barycenter frame mass @xmath28 are related by @xmath29 , with doppler factor @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the line of sight unit vector and @xmath32 is the barycentric velocity of the pulsar . although the transverse velocity of the binary system can be estimated from proper motion measurements , the radial component @xmath33 is unknown . for a typical velocity of 100  km  s@xmath34 ,",
    "the systematic mass error is about @xmath35 ; small , but in some cases much larger than other uncertainties .",
    "while timing measurements of relativistic corrections to the keplerian orbital equations provide the most accurate and theory - independent estimates of neutron star masses , they are possible only for close , eccentric binary orbits or when the orbit is observed nearly edge - on . in the great majority of observed binaries , the mass function provides the only timing information about the component masses , and the pulsar mass can only be determined if additional constraints are found on the companion mass and binary inclination through other techniques .",
    "this section describes several ways to use observations or theoretical considerations to limit @xmath14 ; alternate limits on @xmath36 are the topic of  [ sec : sini ] .      in recent years , over a dozen companion stars in radio pulsar binaries have been optically detected ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in most cases ,",
    "the companions are white dwarfs ; the two main sequence exceptions are discussed in the next section .",
    "many of the white dwarf companions are extremely faint ( @xmath37 ) , allowing detection only with the _ hubble space telescope _ and the largest ground - based telescopes .",
    "there are a number of ways to determine white dwarf masses ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) . given a theoretical relation between the white dwarf mass and radius , the measurement of any combination of",
    "the mass and radius is sufficient to determine the mass .",
    "for example , the radius can be estimated directly from estimates of the optical flux , effective temperature , and distance .",
    "alternately , the surface gravity , @xmath38 , can be found by fitting a model atmosphere to the observed spectrum ( @xcite ) , and combining the result with a temperature or luminosity estimate . in practice , difficulties arise from several sources .",
    "first , the white dwarf companions of millisecond pulsars , with typical masses @xmath39 , are usually believed to be helium white dwarfs which were insufficiently massive to burn to carbon ; the luminosity and temperature evolution of such stars has received much less study than for more massive white dwarfs ( e.g. , @xcite ) , leading to uncertainties in the finite temperature contributions to the mass - radius relationship .",
    "hansen and phinney ( 1998a , b ) have recently calculated cooling curves for helium core dwarfs , using their own calculations of h and he opacities at temperatures below 6000  k , and applied their results to a number of radio pulsar companions .",
    "we discuss their results in more detail in ",
    "[ sec : estimates ] .",
    "the measurement of surface gravity in cool stars is also potentially problematic .",
    "a higher helium abundance , as may occur through enhanced convective mixing in cool stars , will produce higher pressure and broader lines and hence mimic a higher white dwarf mass ( @xcite ) ; indeed , there is some evidence that surface gravity measurements overestimate masses below about 12,000  k ( @xcite ) .",
    "two pulsars have been found in binaries with main sequence companions : psr  b1259@xmath4063 , with a be companion ( @xcite ) , and psr  j0045@xmath407319 , with a b star companion ( @xcite ) .",
    "although in both cases the optical companion is quite bright and easily observed , knowledge of the companion mass @xmath14 and pulsar mass function @xmath25 is of little use in limiting @xmath13 when @xmath41 .",
    "if the mass function of the companion can also be measured , then the mass ratio can be determined .",
    "this has been done in the case of j0045@xmath407319 (  [ sec:0045 ] ) .",
    "the binary millisecond pulsars are believed to be spun up to high spin frequencies through mass transfer from a companion star . in many cases ,",
    "these pulsars are observed in wide , low - eccentricity binary systems with white dwarf secondaries .",
    "these characteristics indicate that the secondary must have passed through a red giant phase after the formation of the neutron star primary , during which tidal torques circularized the orbit and the giant probably filled its roche lobe , causing the mass transfer which spun up the pulsar to millisecond periods . at the end of mass transfer , the envelope of the giant",
    "is exhausted or ejected , leaving the degenerate core as a white dwarf secondary .",
    "there is a close relation between the core mass and the radius of low mass giants ( @xcite ) .",
    "combined with the assumption that the giant filled its roche lobe during the mass transfer , this yields a relation between the binary period at the end of mass transfer and the remnant white dwarf mass ( @xcite ) .",
    "following rappaport _",
    "et  al .  _",
    "( 1995 ) and references therein , the relation between the effective radius of the roche lobe @xmath42 and the binary separation @xmath43 can be written @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the total mass of the giant ( core and envelope ) . near the end of mass transfer ,",
    "the envelope mass can be neglected , so that @xmath46 ( where @xmath14 is the final white dwarf mass ) , and the giant radius @xmath47 . using kepler s third law , @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath14 are in solar units .",
    "we note that equation  ( [ eqn : pb ] ) is independent of the pulsar mass @xmath13 , and relates the orbital period at the end of mass transfer to the final white dwarf mass and the giant radius @xmath49 .",
    "the radius depends , in general , on the composition and history of the giant as well as on @xmath14 ; the utility of equation  ( [ eqn : pb ] ) derives from the relatively narrow distribution of @xmath49 for a given @xmath14 .",

    "( although this is also true at an early stage of the formation of double neutron star binaries , an asymmetry in the second supernova explosion may leave the spin and orbit misaligned . )    in the rotating vector model of pulsar emission , the radio signal is elliptically polarized with the major axis of the polarization ellipse aligned with the plane of curvature of the dipolar magnetic field lines .",

    "observations of scintillation rates have been widely used to estimate the proper motions of isolated pulsars ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in binary systems ,",
    "the transverse velocity is modulated by the orbital motion , with a small amplitude of modulation for orbits viewed face - on , and a large amplitude for orbits viewed on edge .",

    "furthermore , to use a bandwidth of 10  mhz requires a spectrometer with @xmath93 frequency channels .",
    "such observations will be more easily done with the new generation of flexible , all - digital pulsar data recorders ( @xcite ) .",

    "proper motion of the binary system across the sky leads to a secular change in the projected semimajor axis @xmath95 .",

    "some models of pulsar evolution predict magnetic field alignment , counteralignment , or both ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "backer ( 1998 ) has claimed , based on the distribution of observed mass functions in 21 pulsar  white - dwarf binaries , that millisecond pulsars have a non - random distribution of observed binary inclinations .",
    "he suggests that an apparent preference for high inclination orbits may arise because the pulsars magnetic fields are preferentially oriented perpendicular to the spin axis .",
    "however , his analysis makes several assumptions and approximations that prove unwarranted .",
    "in particular , he compares the observed distribution of minimum companion masses @xmath102 with the predicted distribution given the observed mass functions , random inclinations and a single fixed value for the true companion masses @xmath14 ( i.e. , a delta function distribution in @xmath14 ) , finding poor agreement .",
    "however , the predicted distribution for @xmath102 actually depends quite sensitively upon the assumed distribution for @xmath14 ; the delta function distribution is an unreasonable assumption .",

    "however , assuming a 0.10.4  @xmath103 range reduces the agreement to the 33% confidence level .",
    "the discrepancy is primarily due to a deficit of observed systems with small values of @xmath102 , as noted by backer .",
    "unfortunately , our knowledge of the true underlying distribution of @xmath14 in these binaries is sufficiently uncertain that no conclusion regarding the distribution of inclinations is possible from this line of analysis .",

    "it is interesting to ask whether a single , simple distribution of neutron star masses is consistent with all of our observational constraints .",

    "finn 1994 ) .",

    "of course , _ any _ model ( even a poor one ) will yield maximum likelihood parameters for a given data set .",
    "however , it is obvious by inspection that both the gaussian and uniform distributions for the neutron star mass are good fits to the extremely narrow observed range of neutron star masses in the double neutron star binaries .",
    "while it is difficult to quantify the goodness - of - fit for the entire data set , because of the diverse assumptions made in the various mass estimates and the sometimes highly non - gaussian error estimates , we can easily test some neutron star subsamples against the maximum likelihood gaussian model @xmath234 . for the thirteen neutron - star  white - dwarf binaries , we used a monte carlo technique to evaluate the fit quality . for each binary",
    "( with its measured @xmath6 and @xmath25 ) , we simulated a large number of monte carlo trials where the neutron star mass @xmath13 was drawn from the maximum likelihood model , @xmath14 was drawn from the appropriate uniform distribution implied by @xmath6 , and @xmath101 was drawn from a uniform distribution .",
    "the monte carlo trials were then used to construct the probability distribution for the mass function , and this distribution was used to compute the cumulative probability for the measured mass function , @xmath235 . if the model and the associated assumptions are correct , then the cumulative probabilities for the 13 measured mass functions should be consistent with a uniform distribution betwen zero and unity ( _ cf . _ a classical @xmath236 test , schmidt 1968 ) .",
    "a ks test of the distribution shows consistency with a uniform distribution at the improbably good 99% level ( figure  [ fig : ks ] ) .",
    "for the ten stars for which gaussian error estimates @xmath237 are available ( both stars in the relativistic binaries b1534 + 12 , b1913 + 16 , and b2127 + 11c , as well as j1012 + 5307 , j1713 + 0747 , b1855 + 09 , and j0045@xmath407319 ) , we can calculate a @xmath238 statistic , @xmath239 , consistent with expectations for a chi - square distribution with @xmath240 degrees of freedom .",
    "we conclude , therefore , that at least in the radio pulsar systems , there is no evidence for neutron star masses above about @xmath241 . indeed",

    "there are now 26 neutron stars in binary radio pulsar systems for which useful mass constraints can be derived . of these ,",
    "about half are neutron star - white dwarf binaries in which the mass determination depends on the validity of the @xmath6@xmath14 relation and the isotropy of the binary orbits with respect to the line - of - sight , as discussed in the previous section .",
    "all other mass constraints are listed in table  [ tab : masssum ] and shown in figure  [ fig : massrev ] .",
    "although we defer a full discussion of the underlying neutron star mass distribution and it implications for neutron star formation and evolution until after analysis of the x - ray binary systems ( paper  ii ) , we note here a few points of particular interest about the radio pulsar binaries .",
    "figure  [ fig : massrev ] is striking primarily for the very small variations in the masses of well measured stars .",
    "this has , of course , been noted before ( e.g. , thorsett _ et  al .  _ 1993 ) , but it remains surprising that no new mass measurements differ greatly from @xmath242 . in the five double neutron star binaries for which a relativistic periastron advance yields an accurate total ( and hence average ) mass , the average neutron star masses vary by less than 7% .",
    "the most surprising implication of the current results is that there is little evidence for mass tranfer of @xmath243 or more in the millisecond pulsar systems .",
    "it is important , then , to reiterate the assumptions upon which this conclusion rests : ( 1 ) the @xmath6@xmath14 is correct , at least within the ( modest ) claimed precision , and ( 2 ) binary orbits are randomly oriented with respect to the line of sight .",
    "there are good prospects for testing both assumptions .",
    "the reliability of the @xmath6@xmath14 relation depends principally upon the core - mass  radius relation for red giants ( eqns .",

    "further , we hope that the power of the @xmath6@xmath14 relation as a statistical tool will encourage more detailed theoretical investigations of , in particular , the extension of the relation to orbital periods below about three days , where x - ray heating and bloating of the companion star become important .",
    "although any technique that limits @xmath36 (  [ sec : sini ] ; e.g. , polarization or scintillation studies ) can be used to test the hypothesis that orbits are randomly inclined , the most precise measurements will come from pulsar timing and shapiro time delay measurements . in table  [",
