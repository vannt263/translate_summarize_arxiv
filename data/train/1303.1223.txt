    "the electron - phonon interaction can lead to the formation of the superconducting state that is characterized by a high value of the critical temperature ( @xmath1 ) . in the first case , it is relevant for the multi - band systems , in the second case , for the high - temperature superconductors ( cuprates ) , and in the third case , for the materials under the influence of high pressure ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "an example of the multi - band system , in which the phonon - mediated superconducting state is induced at a high value of the critical temperature , is magnesium diboride @xcite . on the basis of the conducted experiments ,",
    "it has been stated that @xmath16_{\\rm mgb_{2}}$ ] equals @xmath17 k. from the physical point of view , the anomalous thermodynamic properties of the considered superconducting state are related to the existence of two energy gaps ; the first one value @xmath18 mev corresponds to the two - dimensional @xmath19 band , the second one @xmath20 mev exists in the three - dimensional @xmath21 band @xcite , @xcite .    in the case of cuprates",
    ", some authors have assumed that the electron - phonon interaction , supplemented by the electron - electron - phonon interaction , can be responsible for the creation of the superconducting phase @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "note that cuprates are the materials characterized by the highest experimentally verified values of @xmath1 .",
    "for example , for the compound @xmath22 ( hg1223 ) , the following has been obtained @xmath23 k @xcite , wherein , under the influence of the pressure ( @xmath24 gpa ) , the critical temperature in hg1223 increases to the value of about @xmath25 k @xcite .",
    "as it turns out , the pressure may be the factor that causes the strong increase of the electron - phonon interaction @xcite .",
    "in particular , it is clearly visible in the case of lithium and calcium , where the maximum value of @xmath1 is equal to @xmath26 k ( @xmath27 gpa ) and to @xmath28 k ( @xmath29 gpa ) , respectively @xcite , @xcite .",
    "additionally , it is believed that a very high value of the critical temperature can be obtained in metallic hydrogen @xcite .",
    "for instance , for the pressure at @xmath30 gpa , the superconducting state in the molecular phase of hydrogen is characterized by @xmath31 k @xcite . at the extremely high pressure ( @xmath32 tpa )",
    ", the critical temperature may be even equal to @xmath33 k @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that from the physical point of view , the high value of the critical temperature in hydrogen is associated with the small mass of the atomic nuclei forming the crystal lattice and the lack of the inner electron shells , which results in the high value of the electron - phonon coupling constant .    in order to obtain the superconducting state with a high value of the critical temperature , but at the pressure that is significantly lower than the metallization pressure for hydrogen ( @xmath34 gpa ) , ashcroft proposed the method of the chemical pre - compression @xcite .",
    "the suggestion made by ashcroft caused a rapid increase in the number of the publications on this topic .",
    "in particular , the following chemical compounds have been taken into consideration : @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we can notice that the obtained theoretical results have been so promising that this branch of physics is now one of the most intensively developed .    in the presented paper",
    ", we have discussed the results obtained for pth under the pressure at @xmath0 gpa . in particular , we have determined the most important thermodynamic parameters of the superconducting state in the framework of the eliashberg formalism @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the eliashberg formalism on the imaginary axis ( @xmath39 ) allows us to determine the values of the order parameter function ( @xmath40 ) and the wave function renormalization factor ( @xmath41 ) . the symbol @xmath42 denotes the @xmath43-th matsubara frequency : @xmath44 , where @xmath45 and @xmath46 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "we notice that the order parameter is defined by the ratio : @xmath47 .",
    "the functions @xmath48 and @xmath49 can be calculated using the equations below @xcite , @xcite , @xcite : @xmath50 @xmath51 where the pairing kernel for the electron - phonon interaction is given by the formula : @xmath52 in equation ( [ r3 ] ) , the @xmath53 denotes the eliashberg function . for the pth compound at 76 gpa",
    ", this function has been calculated in the paper @xcite .",
    "the value of the maximum phonon frequency ( @xmath54 ) is equal to @xmath55 mev .",
    "the electron correlations have been modeled by the coulomb pseudopotential @xmath56 ; @xmath57 denotes the heaviside unit function and @xmath58 is the cut - off frequency ; @xmath59 .",
    "this study refers to a wide range of the coulomb pseudopotential : @xmath4 .",
    "the eliashberg equations on the imaginary axis compose the infinite system of the equations . however , for the temperatures greater than the temperature of zero kelvin one can reduce their number due to the fact that @xmath48 and @xmath49 become saturated at large values of @xmath43 .",
    "in particular , the following range of the temperature has been assumed : @xmath60 . in the present case , @xmath61 matsubara frequencies ( @xmath62 )",
    "should be taken into consideration .",
    "the eliashberg equations have been solved using the iterative method , presented and tested in the papers @xcite and @xcite .",
    "figure [ f1 ] ( a ) presents the dependence of the order parameter @xmath63 on the temperature and the coulomb pseudopotential .",
    "the charts have been drawn up on the basis of the results presented in figs .",

    "it can be noted that the value of the function @xmath65 strongly decreases with the increasing temperature and the coulomb pseudopotential .",
    "as it turns out , the course of the order parameter can be parameterized using the simple formula : @xmath66 where @xmath67 , and : @xmath68 it should be noted that the critical temperature is also strongly dependent on @xmath56 , and it belongs to the range from @xmath2 k to @xmath3 k.    from the physical point of view , the quantity of @xmath69 with a good accuracy determines the value of the energy gap at the fermi level .",
    "thus , the formula ( [ r5 ] ) is relatively accurate to estimate the physical value of the coulomb pseudopotential on the basis of the tunnel experiment @xcite .",

    "however , the changes in the value of @xmath71 are not too large .",
    "it is worth noting that the wave function renormalization factor for the first matsubara frequency can be parameterized with the use of the following expression : @xmath72\\left(\\frac{t}{t_{c}}\\right)^{\\gamma}\\\\ & + & z_{m=1}\\left(\\mu^{\\star}\\right).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the value of @xmath73 can be calculated on the basis of the formula : @xmath74 , where @xmath75 denotes the electron - phonon coupling constant : @xmath76 . for the pth compound ,",
    "we have obtained : @xmath77 .",
    "the function @xmath78 has the form : @xmath79 .    from the physical point of view",
    ", the value of @xmath71 with a good approximation determines the dependence of the electron effective mass ( @xmath80 ) on the temperature and the coulomb pseudopotential : @xmath81 , where the symbol @xmath82 represents the electron band mass .",
    "based on the results presented in figure [ f2 ] ( a ) , it can be noticed that the effective mass of the electron in the pth compound is high in the entire range of the considered temperatures .",
    "the thermodynamic critical field and the specific heat can be determined by calculating the difference in the free energy between the superconducting and the normal state @xcite : @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the value of the electron density of states at the fermi level .",

    "on the other hand , the specific heat of the superconducting state should be calculated using the formula : @xmath96 , where the difference between the specific heat of the superconducting and the normal state ( @xmath9 ) equals : @xmath97}{d\\left(k_{b}t\\right)^{2}}.\\ ] ] the obtained results have been presented in figure [ f3 ] ( b ) .",

    "the high value of the electron - phonon coupling constant in the pth compound means that the values of the determined thermodynamic functions will differ from the expectations of the bcs theory @xcite .",
    "the most convenient way to estimate the differences between the results of the eliashberg theory and the results obtained in the framework of the bcs model is to calculate the dimensionless ratios :    @xmath99    the bcs model predicts that the values of @xmath100 and @xmath101 are universal constants for all the superconductors and they are equal to @xmath102 and @xmath103 , respectively @xcite . in the case of the pth compound , the following results have been obtained : @xmath104 and @xmath105 , for @xmath106 . on that basis , it is clear that the superconducting state in the pth compound can not be correctly described by the bcs model , regardless of the physical value of the parameter @xmath56 .",
