    "we can not unambiguously determine those properties .",
    "the 2002 _ xmm - newton _ observation show the presence of a low - ionization / neutral absorber intrinsic to mr  2251@xmath0178 .",
    "we derived the column density of this gas ( @xmath7 ) from the shape of the soft x - ray continuum below 0.6 kev .",
    "the rgs data show evidence for and absorption lines which allow us to constrain its level of ionization ( log@xmath215 ) .",
    "macchetto et al .",
    "( 1990 ) find evidence for circumnuclear gas on distances between 3 and 6 kpc and of gaseous filaments farther out at distances of 3050 kpc .",
    "their lower limits on the [ ] density ( e.g. , their table 4 ) implies a column densities of @xmath216 .",
    "this is entirely consistent with the properties of the low ionization absorber found in our analysis .",
    "thus , it is possible that the same gas responsible for the [ ] emission is detected in absorption via and x - ray absorption lines .",
    "this means that parts of the emission line nebula observed in mr  2251@xmath0178  lie in our line of sight to the central source .",
    "this paper presents the first fuv spectrum of mr  2251@xmath0178 .",
    "we detect emission from , , and .",
    "we also detect at least 4 absorption systems in , , and , three of which are blended together .",
    "the three blended systems are best seen in ( figure  [ velspec]b ) and are definitely suggested in the other absorption lines ( the main absorption system at @xmath217 ^ -1 kms@xmath8  looks like 3 systems blended together , see figure  [ velspec]a ) .",
    "the lyman absorption lines are seen all the way to the lyman edge ( figure  [ fusespec ] ) .",
    "the lower series lines have similar ews which suggests saturation . however , the lines are not completely black which means incomplete line of sight coverage .",
    "figure  [ velspec]a demonstrate that the absorption system with the largest blueshift might not be saturated since the depth of the 1038  line is about half the depth of 1032 , as expected from their oscillator strength ratios .",
    "on the other hand , the three blended absorption systems have the same depth in both lines of the doublet , indicating that these systems are saturated .",
    "the similarity of the and the absorption profiles suggests that all blended lines of the two ions are saturated and have the same covering fraction .",
    "our spectral analysis indicates a covering factor between @xmath4560% and @xmath4590% for these systems .    the total depth in all the fuv and uv absorption lines is larger than the underlying continuum ,",
    "thus the broad emission lines are absorbed by the uv absorber .",
    "this indicates that the uv absorber lies outside of the blr . using mr  2251@xmath0178  continuum flux at 5100    ( @xmath218 ^-2s^-1^-1 erg@xmath6s@xmath8@xmath8 ; bergeron et al .",
    "1983 ) and the relation between the blr size and the object s luminosity ( equation 6 of kaspi et al .",
    "2000 ) we find the blr size to be @xmath219 cm . we take this to be a lower limit on the distance of the uv absorber from the central black hole .",
    "several studies suggested a link between the uv and x - ray absorber in agns ( e.g. , mathur et al 1994 ; mathur , elvis , & wilkes 1995 ; shields & hamann 1997 ; crenshaw et al .",
    "the data presented in this paper enables us to study this connection in mr  2251@xmath0178 .",
    "as explained , the resolution and s / n of the rgs spectrum does not allow the exact measurement of the x - ray absorption systems .",
    "we can only confirm that the velocity shifts and the fwhm of the uv absorption systems are consistent with the ones observed in the x - ray absorber .",
    "we found that the fuv absorption lines ( in , , and ) are blends of at least 4 absorption systems , all blueshifted with respect to the emission line by 0 to -600 ^-1 kms@xmath8 .",
    "the _ hst _",
    "spectra (   [ hst ] ) show a ly@xmath3 absorption line which is consistent with the _ fuse _ absorption lines .",
    "it also shows a absorption which has a width of 400 ^-1 kms@xmath8  and about the same blueshift range as seen in the fuv .",
    "the resolution of the rgs spectrum at 22   is @xmath45550 ^-1 kms@xmath8hence any absorption lines which are similar in width to the uv absorption lines are predicted to be one pixel wide . in the x - ray spectrum we identify , , and which are consistent with the widths and blueshifts of the uv absorption lines , as well as hints for absorption from .",
    "we identify few absorption lines from highly ionized species with lines at wavelength shorter than 19    ( see table  [ linetable ] ) . given the poor s / n , this is consistent with the absorption seen in the uv spectra .",
    "the consistency between the uv and x - ray absorption suggests that they could arise in the same gas .",
    "we have set a lower limit of @xmath219 cm on the distance of the uv absorber from the source using the blr distance . if the uv and x - ray absorptions are the same , this is also a lower limit on the distance of the x - ray absorber .",
