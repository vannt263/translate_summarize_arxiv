    "the identification of the progenitor stars of supernova ( sn ) explosions is one of the central problems of stellar astrophysics . in the case of core collapse supernovae ( cc sne : types ii , ib , ic , and derived subtypes ) the progenitors",
    "are known to be massive ( @xmath5 ) stars whose inner cores collapse to a neutron star or a black hole . in a few cases , it has been possible to constrain the properties of the progenitor star using pre - explosion images or the turn - off masses of compact clusters @xcite , but there are still many open issues regarding which stars lead to specific subtypes of cc sne ( for an extended discussion and a complete set of references , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in the case of thermonuclear ( type ia ) sne , the situation is much more complex .",
    "although a co white dwarf ( wd ) in some kind of binary is almost certainly the exploding star , the exact nature of the progenitor system has never been firmly established , either theoretically or observationally ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "when direct identifications are not possible , the properties of the progenitors can be constrained using the stellar populations around the exploding stars .",
    "a number of studies have done this for sne in nearby galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , but this approach has important limitations .",
    "first , the available information , be it photometric ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) or spectral ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , is usually integrated over the entire host galaxy , although local measurements at the sn sites have been made for a small number of objects ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this effectively ignores the metallicity and stellar age gradients that must be present in the host .",
    "second , even in surveys that work with complete host spectra , the stellar populations are not resolved . among other things , this means that the stellar light is weighted by luminosity , which can conceal many important properties of the stellar populations . in practice , the information that can be obtained from this kind of observations is restricted to average metallicities and ages , unless sophisticated fitting techniques are used to extract the star formation history ( sfh ) of the host ( see * ? ? ?",
    "ideally , one would want to study _ resolved _ stellar populations associated with sn progenitors .",
    "the information that can be obtained in this way is much more detailed and reliable , but it requires focusing on very nearby sne .",
    "the present work is the first in a series of papers aimed at constraining the fundamental properties of cc and ia sn progenitors in the magellanic clouds by examining the stellar populations at the locations of the supernova remnants ( snrs ) left behind by the explosions . to do this",
    ", we take advantage of the large amount of observational data accumulated on the stellar populations of the clouds , in particular the star formation history ( sfh ) maps published by @xcite for the smc and @xcite ( henceforth , hz09 ) for the lmc . to identify the sites of recent sne",
    ", we rely on the extensively observed population of snrs in the mcs @xcite .",
    "much information about the sn explosions can be extracted from the observations of snrs of both ia and cc origin @xcite , and in some cases this information can be complemented by light echoes from the sne themselves @xcite . in this first installment , we focus on the eight youngest snrs in the lmc : sn1987a , n158a , n63a , and n49 ( cc snrs ) ; 0509@xmath067.5 , 0519@xmath069.0 , n103b and dem l71 ( ia snrs ) .",

    "[ sec : targets ] we describe the criteria that have led to the selection of our eight target snrs . in ",
    "[ sec : sntosnr ] we review their types and the characteristics of the parent sne that can be inferred from their observational properties . in   [ sec : map ] we review the fundamental details of the sfh map of the lmc presented in hz09 . in ",

    "finally , in ",
    "[ sec : conc ] we present our conclusions and we outline some avenues for future research .",
    "we will focus on young snrs because they are usually ejecta - dominated and still contain a great deal of information about their parent sne - in particular , the risk of mistyping young cc and ia snrs is minimal ( see   [ sec : sntosnr ] ) . identifying the youngest snrs in a given set , however , is not trivial . among the snrs in the lmc ,",
    "only one has a known age ( sn 1987a ) , and only three ( 0509@xmath067.5 , 0519@xmath069.0 , and n103b ) have more or less accurate age estimates from light echoes @xcite . in the absence of consistent age estimates for all objects ,",
    "size is the best criterion to select the youngest ones .",
    "much information about the snr population in the lmc can be found in the _ rosat _ atlas by @xcite , but the snr sizes in particular are not reliable and must be revised .",
    "sizes of snrs with sharp outer boundaries are overestimated due to the large _ rosat _ psf ( e.g. 0509@xmath067.5 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while sizes of diffuse snrs are underestimated due to the low _ rosat _ effective area ( e.g. n23 , * ? ? ?",
    "we have searched the literature for more recent _ chandra _ observations to constrain the lmc snr sizes , and we have selected the eight smallest objects ( sizes @xmath6 arcmin , see table [ tab-1 ] ) .",
    "the age estimates listed in table [ tab-1 ] merit a few comments .",
    "for snrs without sn or light echo information , ages are calculated from the snr size assuming a specific model for the snr dynamics , which can introduce large uncertainties .",
    "in particular , the standard dynamical models for young snrs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ignore the effect of cosmic ray acceleration at the forward shock .",
    "it is now widely accepted that energy losses due to cosmic ray acceleration can affect the size of young snrs in a noticeable way @xcite , which implies that calculations based on unmodified snr dynamics can overestimate the age by as much as 20@xmath7 ( see   5.2 in * ? ? ? * for a discussion ) .    in figure [ fig-1 ]",
    ", we illustrate the location of our eight target snrs within the large scale structure of the lmc using the data from field 13 of the southern h - alpha sky survey atlas ( shassa , * ? ? ?",
    "two snrs , sn 1987a and n158a , are located in the 30 dor region , the most prominent active star forming region in the lmc .",

    "the last two objects , 0509@xmath067.5  and dem l71 , are in rather inconspicuous parts of the lmc disk , in the area called the northwest void by hz09 .",
    "more specific discussions about the location of each snr will be given in ",
    "[ sec : sfh ] .",
    "typing snrs as cc or type ia can be an uncertain and treacherous business . both cc and ia sne deposit a similar amount of kinetic energy ( @xmath8 erg ) in the ambient medium ( am ) , which often makes it impossible to distinguish mature cc from mature ia snrs based on their size or morphology alone .",
    "a much more reliable way to type snrs is to examine the evidence left behind by the explosion itself : x - ray spectrum from the sn ejecta and am , snr dynamics , and properties of the compact object or pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) , if present . in general , this can only be done for relatively young objects ( but see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . by using methods along these lines ,",
    "we have been able to determine the type of all the objects in our list with a high degree of confidence , and in some cases even the sn subtypes within the broader cc and ia categories . in this section",
    "we will discuss the classification and sn subtypes of our target snrs , but before going into the details of each object , it is important to mention the work of @xcite .",
    "these authors attempted to type _ all _ the lmc snrs known at the time by noting the distance from each object to hii regions and ob associations .",
    "although this is a very crude method , their conclusions regarding the cc or type ia nature of our target snrs coincide with ours , except in the case of snr n103b , which will be discussed in detail in ",

    "the stellar evolution models of @xcite for single stars of lmc metallicity ( @xmath9 ) predict that stars between @xmath10 and @xmath3 will explode as red supergiants , retaining most of their h envelope and becoming type iip sne , stars between @xmath11 and @xmath12 will lose a large part of their envelopes and explode as type iil or type iib sne , and stars above @xmath12 will lose all their envelopes and become naked cc sne of types ib and ic . within naked cc sne",
    ", there is some evidence that type ic sne , which are linked to long duration gamma - ray bursts @xcite come from more massive stars than type ib sne @xcite . stars that retain a massive h envelope but explode as blue supergiants instead of red supergiants form a separate class , often referred to as sn 1987-like events .",
    "the lifetimes associated with these stellar masses range between 41 myr for an isolated @xmath13 star and 5.4 myr for an isolated @xmath12 star ( always taking the @xmath9 models from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in principle",
    ", mass loss will be facilitated by binary interactions , leading to fewer red supergiants and more type ib / c sne in binary systems , but stellar evolution calculations that include these effects are subject to an entirely different set of uncertainties @xcite .",
    "from the point of view of the snrs , the complex and turbulent structure of most young cc snrs makes a quantitative interpretation of the x - ray spectrum in terms of specific explosion models and progenitor scenarios very challenging ( e.g. see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "many times , it is hard to infer the sn subtype from the observational properties of the snr , but the large intrinsic diversity of cc sne as a class can often be used to some advantage in snr studies .",
    "@xcite argues that several aspects of snr evolution are expected to be very different depending on the subtype of the parent sn : mixing in the ejecta , fallback onto the central compact object , expansion of the pwn , interaction with the csm , and photoionization of the am by shock breakout radiation .",
    "using arguments along these lines , @xcite inferred from the positions of the fluid discontinuities , the presence of high velocity h , and the extent of the clumpy photoionized pre - sn wind in the cas a snr that its progenitor must have been a type iin or type iib event .",
    "this ` prediction of the past ' was later confirmed by the spectroscopy of the light echo of the cas a sn @xcite , which is very similar to the spectrum of the type iib sn1993j .",
    "although this agreement is certainly encouraging , we must insist that studies based on snrs are still a long way from providing a robust method of subtyping cc sne - as an example , the type iin / iib classification of cas a by @xcite was challenged by @xcite , who argued for a type ib progenitor .      in the following paragraphs",
    ", we examine each of the four target cc snrs in more detail . for a summary , see table [ tab-2 ] .",

    "taken together , these arguments lend strong support to a cc origin .",
    "the complex filamentary structure of the shocked am suggests that dense material surrounded the sn at the time of the explosion @xcite , which favors a progenitor with a slow wind , maybe a type iip sn .",
    "unfortunately , this is just an educated guess , because the complex multi - phase x - ray emission of the snr and the poorly known age make the interpretation of the observations very challenging .",

    "it is embedded in the large hii region n63 , and it also appears to be located within an ob association ( ngc 2030 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , making a cc type very likely .",
    "the size , morphology , and x - ray spectrum show evident signs of a complex interaction with a highly structured am , and they seem to indicate that it is expanding into a large cavity @xcite , which suggests a massive progenitor with a fast wind , maybe a type ib / c sn . however , there is no additional evidence to support this conclusion because the x - ray emission , which is dominated by the shocked am , reveals very little about the properties of the sn ejecta @xcite .",
    "[ [ sn-1987a ] ] sn 1987a + + + + + + + +    the classification and subtype of sn 1987a are obvious from the sn spectroscopy . the vast amount of information available on this object",

    "[ [ snr - n158a ] ] snr n158a + + + + + + + + +    this object harbors a well - observed pwn that types it as a cc snr and constrains its age to be @xmath16800 yr @xcite . the sn subtype classification has been rather controversial .",
    "the snr dynamics indicate that the shock wave is moving into dense , clumpy csm similar to what can be found around a massive wolf - rayet star , and the presence of strong o and s lines in the x - ray spectrum of the innermost ejecta reveal that at least some of the heavy elements in the ejecta have not fallen back onto the central neutron star @xcite .",
    "this would favor a massive type ib / c progenitor , but both the detection of h in the pwn filaments @xcite and a recent re - analysis of the ejecta emission @xcite seem to indicate that the progenitor might have been in the @xmath17 range , implying a type iip explosion ( for more detailed discussions , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our current understanding of type ia sn progenitors is still extremely sketchy @xcite , but several interesting trends have been inferred from the bulk properties the host galaxies .",
    "any theoretical model for type ia progenitors must account for the fact that type ia sne explode in elliptical galaxies with very little star formation ( sf ) , but at the same time the rate of ia events in star forming galaxies appears to scale with the specific star formation rate @xcite .",
    "moreover , type ia sne exploding in elliptical galaxies are on average dimmer that those exploding in star forming galaxies @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite used these observational facts to postulate _ two _ populations of type ia sn progenitors : a ` prompt ' population with short delay times ( of the order of a few hundred myr ) , associated with recent sf and leading to somewhat brighter sn ia , and a ` delayed ' population with longer delay times ( of the order of gyr ) , not associated with recent sf and leading to somewhat dimmer sn ia . in this two - component model , the specific type ia sn rate in a given galaxy is expressed as @xmath18 , with @xmath19 being the total stellar mass in the galaxy and @xmath20 the specific star formation rate .",
    "it is important to stress that the observed rates do not _ require _ the existence of two components - in some theoretical scenarios , type ia sne from a single progenitor channel can explode with both very short and very long delay times @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , there have been several attempts to associate the prompt and delayed progenitor populations to the two leading theoretical scenarios for type ia sne : single degenerate ( sd ) systems , in which the wd accretes material from a non - degenerate companion and double degenerate ( dd ) systems , in which the wd accretes material from another wd .",
    "so far , none of these attempts has succeeded ( see f.i . * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , and the identity of type ia sn progenitors remains a mystery .    despite all the uncertainties regarding their progenitors , type ia sn explosions as a class are much more homogeneous and have less intrinsic dispersion than cc sne .",
    "in particular , there is a simple relationship between the structure of the ejecta and the peak brightness of the sn that is well reproduced by one - dimensional delayed detonation ( ddt ) explosion models @xcite .",
    "this allows to map the vast majority of sn ia onto a sequence of bright to dim events based on the amount of @xmath21ni that they synthesize . generally speaking , type ia snrs",
    "are also much less turbulent than cc snrs , and most of them seem to be interacting with a relatively unmodified am @xcite , although there are exceptions like the kepler snr @xcite and snr n103b ( * ? ? ?",
    "* , see also the discussion in   [ sec : conc - ia ] ) .",
    "thanks to this set of circumstances , it is generally easier to interpret the x - ray emission of type ia snrs quantitatively in terms of specific explosion models , provided that the dynamic evolution of the snr and the nonequilibrium processes in the shocked plasma are properly taken into account @xcite .",
    "it is also possible to estimate the brightness of the parent event from the mass of @xmath21ni synthesized by the preferred ddt explosion model , as shown by @xcite in the case of the tycho snr .",
    "these four objects were classified as type ia snrs by @xcite based on their lack of compact object or pwn and the general properties of their x - ray emission , which is dominated by fe lines and has only weak or absent lines from o. in order to confirm these classifications and derive the sn subtype , it is necessary to perform an in - depth analysis of the ejecta emission , as done by @xcite for snr 0509@xmath067.5 .",

    "the snr is also remarkable in that it shows a strong east - west asymmetry @xcite , which has been interpreted as a sign of some kind of csm interaction , mainly by analogy to the kepler snr .",
    "this asymmetry also makes the ejecta analysis challenging , but bh09 find a relatively good match to the spectrum using ddt models for moderately bright type ia sne with a snr age close to the 800 yr estimated from the light echo by @xcite .    [",

    "data from more than 20 million stars was assembled to produce color - magnitude diagrams in 500 @xmath29 cells encompassing the central @xmath30 of the lmc ( see figure 4 in hz09 ) , and then the starfish code @xcite was applied to derive the local sfh for each cell .",
    "cells with enough stars in them , like the eight cells that contain our target snrs , were further subdivided into four @xmath31 subcells .",
    "the sfh of each cell is given at thirteen lookback times between @xmath32 ( 6.3 myr ) and @xmath33 ( 17.8 gyr ) , and it is broken into four metallicity bins : @xmath34 and @xmath35 .    for reference in further discussions , we reproduce the sfh of the entire lmc from hz09 in figure [ fig-2 ] .",
    "the error bars on the total sfh represented with the gray shaded area are dominated by crowding effects ( see   3.3 in hz09 ) .",
    "although no metallicities were fitted for ages below 50 myr , the plots display the canonical lmc metallicity ( @xmath9 ) in the most recent age bins , which is reasonable in view of the high degree of homogeneity in the metallicity of the ism and the young stars in the lmc @xcite .",
    "a detailed discussion of the sfh of the lmc and its interpretation in the context of the lmc s past history can be found in   5 of hz09 .",
    "for our purposes , it suffices to note that , after an initial episode of sf in the distant past , the lmc went into a quiescent period that lasted until 5 gyr ago , and since then it has been forming stars at an average rate of @xmath36 , with episodes of enhanced sf at 2 gyr , 500 myr , 100 myr , and 12 myr . from figure [ fig-2 ] , it is obvious that the vast majority of the stars in the lmc have ages above 1 gyr .",
    "most of these old stars have metallicities of one tenth solar or lower .",
    "during the lifetime of a galaxy , several processes naturally mix the stellar populations . these include both internal processes like the ` churning ' of the disk by spiral arms @xcite and external processes like tidal interactions and mergers @xcite . in this context , the properties of the stellar population ( and hence the sfh ) in the neighborhood of a young snr will only be representative of the sn progenitor up to a certain lookback time , @xmath37 . in principle",

    "* ) , and the velocity dispersions for the young disk and old disk populations determined by @xcite are @xmath10 and @xmath40 , respectively .",
    "thus , the length of time that it would take an average star of the young ( old ) disk to drift from one subcell to the next in the absence of restoring forces , @xmath41 , is 43 ( 16 ) myr .",
    "these timescales are not relevant for the progenitors of cc sne , which should belong to the young disk , but they will be very important for sn ia progenitors , which could be quite older . in any case , @xmath37 should be much larger than @xmath41 , because ( a ) some regions of the lmc are more homogeneous than others , which means that stars have to drift over larger distances in order to find substantially different stellar populations , and ( b ) there are restoring forces like gravity that maintain the structural integrity of the disk and act to limit stellar drift .",
    "we have quantified the spatial homogeneity of the stellar populations around our target snrs in figure [ fig-3 ] .",
    "we plot the absolute value of the relative differences in the stellar populations as a function of the distance from the center of each of the eight subcells that contain the cc and ia snrs in our list . to calculate the relative differences , we have integrated the sfh in each neighboring subcell , taking all the time bins were the differences between the neighbor and the snr subcell were statistically significant ( i.e. , the error bars did not overlap ) up to a lookback time of 1.1 gyr , and then divided by the total number of stars formed in the snr subcell . at each distance",
    ", the relative difference is the mean of the relative differences between the snr subcell and all the subcells at that distance . figure [ fig-3 ] shows that some of our target snrs are in remarkably homogeneous regions of the lmc disk .",
    "these include the cc snrs n49 and n63a in the blue arm and the type ia snr 0509@xmath067.5  in the northwest void , with average relative differences in the stellar populations below @xmath42 within 1400 pc of the central subcell .",
    "this distance translates into @xmath41 values of 215 and 80 myr for young and old disk stars in the absence of restoring forces .",
    "the effect of restoring forces on the value of @xmath37 is more difficult to estimate .",
    "if no chaotic processes intervene , neighboring stars will tend to move together through the disk , which explains why some lmc structures like the bar and the northwest arm show up in the hz09 map with lookback times as large as 1 gyr ( see their figure 8) .",
    "this long survival time is not restricted to large structures - in the solar neighborhood , there is evidence that several groups of old stars ( 2 to 8 gyr ) are moving together through the disk of the milky way @xcite .",
    "but smaller structures like young stellar clusters seem to disappear on timescales of the order of @xmath43 myr in the lmc @xcite , which is roughly equivalent to the dynamic crossing time of the lmc disk",
    ". we will adopt this value as a figure of merit for @xmath37 in a single subcell of the sfh maps .",
    "since the result of @xcite applies to young stars , this implies that restoring forces increase the value of @xmath41 by at least a factor @xmath44 , but we stress that this is just a very rough estimate .",
    "we conclude that the relevance of the local sfhs for type ia sn progenitors will depend on both the homogeneity of the stellar populations around each subcell ( figure [ fig-3 ] ) and the age of the progenitors .",
    "if the lifetime of type ia progenitors in the prompt channel is as short as the 180 myr claimed by @xcite , it should be possible to use the local sfhs of type ia snrs in the lmc to explore their properties . for progenitors with longer lifetimes , the stellar context of each snr",
    "should be taken into account .",

    "these averages are always dominated by the large population of old stars in each subcell , and therefore they are irrelevant for the properties of cc sn progenitors - the values in table [ tab-2 ] are merely provided for comparison with the values in table [ tab-3 ] ( see discussion in   [ sec : disc ] ) .",

    "the interval cuts are the stellar masses whose lifetimes correspond to the upper edges of the first and second age bins in the sfhs : 9.4 and 18.9 myr .",
    "we remind the reader that these values of @xmath50 are calculated using isolated star models that do not take into account the potentially large effects of binarity on stellar evolution .",
    "an entirely different but also potentially serious problem comes from the fact that massive stars are notoriously difficult to study using photometry alone @xcite . because starfish uses _",
    "all _ the stars ( not just the massive ones ) in each subcell to calculate the sfr at each age , the values of @xmath50 might not be severely affected by this , but to this date there has been no systematic calibration of the starfish results for young stellar populations . to reflect these and other caveats , we do not list error bars on the @xmath50 values , which should only be regarded as approximate .    [ [ snr - n49 - 1 ] ] snr n49 + + + + + + +    the integrated sfh for the north blue arm region that contains snr n49 and snr n63a is dominated by a coherent episode of low - metallicity star formation 100 myr ago ( see   5.1.3 and figure 16 in hz09 ) , which is apparent in the corresponding panels of figure [ fig-4 ] .",
    "this is the reason why the values of @xmath45 and @xmath46 for snrs n49 and n63a are lower than those of the other snrs .",
    "many parts of the north blue arm have also had noticeable star formation activity in the last 40 myr , although not as intense as in the more prominent star forming regions of the lmc , 30 dor and constellation iii .",
    "snr n49 is in one such region , which had a moderately intense sf burst 12 myr ago , but very little sf activity in the most recent bin centered at 6.3 myr ( see figure [ fig-5 ] ) . from these properties of the sfh",

    "@xcite examined this issue in detail , and came to the conclusion that the link between snr n49 and sgr 0526@xmath066 is considerably less convincing than those of other magnetars in snrs .",
    "more recently , @xcite performed a nir survey of the area around snr n49 and identified a young stellar cluster ( sl 463 ) at a projected distance of @xmath56 pc northeast of sgr 0526@xmath066 that could have been the birthplace of the magnetar .",
    "this cluster does fall partially on a neighboring subcell of the hz09 map with intense sf at 6.3 myr , consistent with the 5 to 20 myr age estimates for sl 463 by @xcite , and much more promising as a birthplace of massive cc progenitors ( @xmath57 above @xmath53 ) .",
    "as pointed out by @xcite , if this hypothesis is true the magnetar must have been ejected from its birthplace with a certain velocity , and should have a measurable proper motion ( see their   3.2 ) .",
    "another possibility is that the association between snr n49 and sgr 0526@xmath066 is indeed real , but not all magnetars have stellar progenitors more massive than @xmath3 .",

    "@xcite conducted a detailed study of the immediate neighborhood of sn1987a within the 30 dor region using _ hst _ data , and found a loose young cluster with an age of @xmath58 myr , which they identified as the birthplace of sn1987a s progenitor .",

    "again , this is compatible with the relatively massive progenitor suggested by the snr properties ( see   [ sec : sntosnr : cc ] ) , but unfortunately the temporal resolution of the sfh does not allow us to discriminate between a type iip progenitor with @xmath63 @xcite and a type ib / c progenitor with @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "from the point of view of the stellar population around snr 158a , both hypotheses are equally plausible .",
    "the local sfhs around the four type ia snrs are displayed in figure [ fig-6 ] . since the age of the progenitors is not known _ a priori _ , we also display the integrated sfhs in figure [ fig-7 ] to provide a more intuitive picture of the makeup of the stellar populations in these locations and how they have evolved with time . with one exception ( snr n103b ,",
    "see below ) , these sfhs are very different from those associated with the cc snrs .",
    "the sfhs of snrs dem l71 , 0509@xmath067.5 , and 0519@xmath069.0  show very little ( but nonzero ) activity in the last 200 myr , resulting in old and metal poor stellar populations , typical of the regions of the lmc without ongoing star formation .",
    "the sfhs of these three snrs are also punctuated by bursts of sf at 600 myr and 2 gyr whose prominence varies from object to object , but this is probably more related to the global properties of the lmc ( see figure [ fig-2 ] ) than to the type ia sn progenitors .",
    "given the coincidence of the lmc disk crossing time and the upper limit for the delay time of short - lived sn ia progenitors ( 180 myr according to * ? ? ?",
    "* see   [ sec : relevance ] ) , it is possible to use the a+b model introduced in   [ sec : sntosnr : ia ] and the local sfhs to predict what fraction of type ia sne will come from prompt and delayed progenitors in each subcell ( @xmath65 ) . for the prompt component ,",
    "we have calculated an average star formation rate by integrating the sfhs between 64 myr ( the minimum time necessary to produce a co wd at the metallicity of the lmc , * ? ? ? * ) and 180 myr , and we have multiplied it by the value of @xmath66 from @xcite , @xmath67 . for the delayed component , we have simply multiplied the number of stars in each subcell by the value of @xmath68 from @xcite , @xmath69 .",
    "the values of @xmath65 for each type ia snr are listed in table [ tab-3 ] , and can be compared with the values obtained for the whole lmc using the integrated sfh from figure [ fig-2 ] : @xmath70 and @xmath71 . even more so than in the case of cc sne , we stress that these numbers should be considered with caution , because they make strong assumptions about the properties of type ia sn progenitors .",
    "in particular , increasing the upper limit to the age of the prompt component from 180 to 300 myr results in an increase of the fraction of _ delayed _ type ia progenitors between 8 and 15 percentual points , depending on the snr .    at a first glance , it is somewhat surprising that the sn ia rates from prompt and delayed progenitors are always comparable both in the whole lmc and at the locations of the individual type ia snrs .",
    "this can be easily understood by examining figure 6 in @xcite : for low values of the sfr , the _ specific _ rate of type ia sne from the prompt and delayed components is very similar , and low - intensity sf has been widespread across the lmc during the last 5 gyr ( see   [ sec : map ] and hz09 ) .",
    "[ [ snr - dem - l71 - 1 ] ] snr dem l71 + + + + + + + + + + +    the exceptionally low rate of sf between 64 and 180 myr in the subcell containing this snr makes it the most likely object ( @xmath72 probability ) to be associated with a delayed type ia sn progenitor .",

    "since even elliptical galaxies appear to have some residual sf during their entire lifetimes @xcite , isolating the delayed type ia progenitors in the local universe to study their properties in detail might be a very challenging task , unless a type ia sn is found in a nearby globular cluster @xcite .",
    "our results allow us to test specific theoretical predictions about type ia progenitors , like the claim by @xcite that the type ia sn rate should be very low for metallicities lower than a tenth of the solar value .",
    "this is based on the so - called ` accretion wind ' scenario for single - degenerate type ia progenitors , which requires a minimum opacity in the material transferred from the companion to the wd @xcite .",
    "the average _ stellar _ metallicity is close to this value or even much lower around three of the four type ia snrs that we have examined , which seems hard to reconcile with the results of @xcite , although we stress that all the regions that we examined do contain a small number of stars with higher metallicities .",
    "similar concerns about this prediction and its implications have been raised by @xcite , who found several type ia sne in low - metallicity dwarf galaxies .",

    "if this technique could be applied to the lmc snrs , we would be able to contrast the results with the properties of the stellar populations , and test theoretical ideas about the role of metallicity in different kinds of type ia sne ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the unusual morphology of snr n103b ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , which is strongly suggestive of some kind of csm interaction , has become even more noteworthy in light of the vigorous recent sf revealed by the local sfh .",

    "evident signs of csm interaction , however , can not be found in other well studied type ia objects like tycho and sn 1006 in our own galaxy or the other three lmc snrs that we have analyzed here @xcite , indicating that a majority of type ia progenitors do not modify their surroundings in a noticeable way .",
    "since it is unlikely that _ all _ these other objects have had progenitors from the delayed component , we are left with two possibilities : either the amount of mass loss during the pre - sn evolution of prompt type ia progenitors has a large dynamic range or there is more than one way to produce type ia sne with short delay times .",
    "the properties of snr 0509@xmath067.5  are also remarkable , for entirely different reasons .",
    "@xcite found @xmath77 for this sn , which translates into to a @xmath78 magnitude at maximum light close to @xmath79 @xcite .",

    "the fact that an object like snr 0509@xmath067.5  appears in a sample of only four snrs implies that bright type ia sne in old stellar populations may not be an exceptional occurrence , which should be taken into account when examining the contribution of bright and dim type ia sne in cosmological studies .",
    "our results underline the dangers of trying to understand the behavior of type ia sn progenitors by studying only the bulk properties of unresolved stellar populations in distant galaxies .",
    "if the lmc had been a distant type ia sn host , two objects with such radically different sfhs as snrs n103b and 0509@xmath067.5  would have been assigned the same age and metallicity .",

    "the timing and intensity of these sf episodes can provide interesting constraints on the masses of cc sn progenitors , but more work is needed to explore the full potential of this method .",
    "the local sfhs have also allowed us to study the ages and metallicities of the stellar populations around our target type ia snrs ( dem l71 , n103b , 0509@xmath067.5 , and 0519@xmath069.0 ) in great detail .",

    "we have seen that extremely bright type ia sne can explode very far away from any significant star formation activity ( snr 0509@xmath067.5 ) , and that type ia sne associated with young stellar populations might sometimes experience significant mass - loss before they explode ( snr n103b ) .",
    "recent studies of extragalactic type ia sn rates and our own findings suggest that reality is probably too complex to be explained with the popular two - component progenitor model .",

    "<S> we use the star formation history map of the large magellanic cloud recently published by harris & zaritsky to study the sites of the eight smallest ( and presumably youngest ) supernova remnants in the cloud : sn 1987a , n158a , n49 , and n63a ( core collapse remnants ) , 0509@xmath067.5 , 0519@xmath069.0 , n103b , and dem l71 ( type ia remnants ) . </S>",
    "<S> the local star formation histories provide unique insights into the nature of the supernova progenitors , which we compare with the properties of the supernova explosions derived from the remnants themselves and from supernova light echoes . </S>",
    "<S> we find that all the core collapse supernovae that we have studied are associated with vigorous star formation in the recent past . in the case of sn 1987a </S>",
    "<S> , the time of the last peak of star formation ( 12 myr ) matches the lifetime of a star with the known mass of its blue supergiant progenitor ( @xmath1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> more recent peaks of star formation can lead to supernovae with more massive progenitors , which opens the possibility of a type ib / c origin for snrs n158a and n63a . </S>",
    "<S> stars more massive than @xmath2 are very scarce around snr n49 , implying that the magnetar sgr 0526@xmath066 in this snr was either formed elsewhere or came from a progenitor with a mass well below the @xmath3 threshold suggested in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> three of our four ia snrs are associated with old , metal poor stellar populations . </S>",
    "<S> this includes snr 0509@xmath067.5 , which is known to have been originated by an extremely bright type ia event , and yet is located very far away from any sites of recent star formation , in a population with a mean age of @xmath4 gyr . </S>",
    "<S> the type ia snr n103b , on the other hand , is associated with recent star formation , and might have had a relatively younger and more massive progenitor with substantial mass loss before the explosion . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss these results in the context of our present understanding of core collapse and type ia supernova progenitors . </S>"
