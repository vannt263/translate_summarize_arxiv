    "as a result of correlations between nucleons inside the nuclear medium , the occupation probability of single - particle shells are lowered with respect to the mean - field prediction .",
    "experimentally , this can be observed as a quenching of the absolute spectroscopic factors for the knockout of a nucleon from a given shell .",
    "studies of  reactions have allowed the determination of spectroscopic factors in many closed - shell nuclei  @xcite demonstrating that the removal probability for nucleons from these systems is reduced by about 35% with respect to the shell - model predictions .    for the  nucleus ,",
    "the experimental spectroscopic strength  @xcite for the knockout of a proton from both the @xmath0 and @xmath1 shells corresponds to about @xmath2 .",
    "the inclusion of relativistic effects in the analysis of data is espected to change these results by not more than a few  %  @xcite .",
    "theoretical calculations for this nucleus seem still far from being able to reproduce quantitatively the experiments and give numbers that depend on the approximation scheme employed .",

    "center of mass corrections are known to raise the spectroscopic factor by about 7%  @xcite , thus worsening the agreement with data .",
    "an improvement of these results seems to require a treatment of low - energy correlations with the inclusion two - hole ",
    "one - particle ( 2h1p ) states  @xcite",
    ". this would be in line with the green s function calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite , in which 2h1p states were taken into account and a reduction of about 25% was obtained , still neglecting center of mass corrections .",
    "a comparison with the experimental result ( and their uncertainties ) suggests that about 20% of the observed single - particle strength removal remains unexplained .",
    "nevertheless , it is important to note that the results of ref .",
    "@xcite indicate the low - energy correlations as an essential ingredient , needed for a complete understanding of this puzzle .    the merit of the calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite lies in the fact that summing 2h1p states and their interactions to all orders , one can achieve a simultaneous description of the effects of both particle - hole  ( ph ) and hole - hole  ( hh ) collective excitations , including the interplay between them .",
    "these effects , though , were accounted for only at a tamm - dancoff approximation ( tda ) level . in order to account for the coupling to collective excitations that are actually observed in @xmath3",
    "it is necessary to at least consider a random - phase approximation ( rpa ) description of the isoscalar negative parity states  @xcite . to account for the low - lying isoscalar positive parity states",
    "an even more complicated treatment will be required .",
    "sizable collective effects are also present in the particle - particle ( pp ) and hh excitations involving tensor correlations for isoscalar and pair correlations for isovector states .    taking a look at the experimental spectral function  @xcite",
    ", one can also notice that the total strength for proton emission of a @xmath1 proton is experimentally distributed over a main peak and two small fragments at slightly higher missing energy .",
    "this splitting is not described by the calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite where only one pole is generated that contains most of the single - particle strength .",
    "the results of ref .",
    "@xcite have been used as a starting point to study the  reaction  @xcite . in these works ,",
    "the two - hole spectral function was obtained by coupling two dressed single - particle ( sp ) propagators and then allowing them to interact to all orders through a ladder type equation .",
    "the distortaion of the two - hole overlap function caused by short - range effects was also included by adding defect functions associated with a g - matrix interaction  @xcite which was computed for the finite   nucleus . these calculations led to a proper description of the experimental cross section for two proton emission  @xcite and yield amplitudes for the transition to the ground state of  and to some of its lowest excited states .",
    "nevertheless a completely satisfactory description is missing here also .",
    "recent developments of nn knockout reactions allow to distinguish several states of the final nucleus and in particular it is now possible to disentangle the two @xmath4 excited states of   at 7.0 and 8.32  mev  @xcite . in spite of this ,",
    "the theoretical calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite can generate only one @xmath4 excited state .",
    "it is interesting to note that the transition to both of the @xmath4 states can be interpreted as the knockout of two protons from a @xmath0 and a @xmath1 state .",
    "although this has not been directly investigated yet , it comes natural to suppose that the fragmentation of the @xmath1 peak seen in the   reaction could play some role in the generation of the @xmath4 doublet in .",
    "moreover , it must be noted that the strength of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 peaks , generated in the calculations of the one - hole spectral function , enters directly in the calculation of the two - hole amplitude .",
    "it is therefore evident that one- and two - hole spectral functions are closely related , the correct description of the first being relevant for a successful description of the second and vice versa . as a consequence , a formalism in which both quantities are generated together in a consistent way is highly desirable .",
    "this can be achieved in the the framework of self - consistent green s function theory ( scgf ) in which the equations of motion are expressed in terms of fragmented propagators and are iterated until self - consistency is reached .    at the same time",
    ", it is also desirable to extend the calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite to include the rpa description of pp  ( hh ) and ph phonons .",
    "this is not completely trivial .",

    "[ fig : pp_ph_sf ] .",
    "the last of the three diagrams on the right hand side is already contained in each of the other two and must therefore be subtracted to avoid double counting .",
    "this subtraction introduces spurious poles in the lehmann representation of the self - energy and generates meaningless ( not even normalizable ) solutions of the dyson equation .",
    "in addition , each of the first two terms in fig .",
    "[ fig : pp_ph_sf ] ignores the pauli correlations between the freely propagating line and the quasi - particles forming the phonons , as noted in  @xcite .    to achieve the inclusion of rpa effects",
    ", one needs to pursue a formalism in which the contribution of the pp and ph phonons to the self - energy are summed to all orders , like the example of fig .  [",
    "fig : faddallo ] .",
    "this , would avoid the subtraction of the second - order diagram .",
    "such a formalism has been proposed recently  @xcite with the intent of attacking the above issues . in this approximation scheme",
    "the effects of both pp ( hh ) and ph phonons can be evaluated at an rpa level and then summed up to all orders by means of the faddeev technique  @xcite .",
    "the treatment of pauli correlations is also improved over methods that include ph rpa phonons directly in the self - energy , since all exchange terms at the 2p1h level are consistently included .",
    "an issue that one needs to be aware of in the application of the formalism of faddeev equations is the apparence of spurious solutions .",
    "the faddeev approach consists in substituting the schdinger equations with a set of three coupled differential equations . as a result ,",
    "more solutions are generated and about 2/3 of them are spurious . in the general three - body problem , though , the properties of such spurious states are well known and they can be eliminated efficiently  @xcite .",
    "the situation is a little more complex if the faddeev formalism is applied in a many - body context , with the intent of studying the motion of quasi - particle and quasi - hole excitations . here",
    ", in particular , the fulfillment of closure relations for pp and ph amplitudes is related to the behavior of the spurious faddeev eigenstates  @xcite .",
    "this makes the choice of the interaction boxes to be used a critical problem , since without a proper treatment of this relation the spurious solutions will irremediably mix with the physically meaningful ones .",
    "the faddeev approach represents a step further with respect to the calculations of refs .",
    "@xcite and it is our aim to apply it to the study of one- and two - hole spectral functions of . in this contribution , the basic formalism is briefly reviewed .",
    "some details and some technical issues ( as the elimination of spurious solutions ) are described more completely in ref .",

    "nevertheless , some preliminary results have been generated for a simplified model and they will be described in the last part , as an example .",
    "the relevant quantities for the study of one- and two - nucleons knockout reactions are the one- and two - hole spectral functions @xmath5 @xmath6    these can be obtained from the diagonal elements of the one- and two- body green s function respectively , which in their lehmann representation take the form  @xcite @xmath7 and @xmath8 in eq .",

    "in the nuclear case , a strong coupling exists between the sp degrees of freedom and both collective low - lying states as well as high - lying states .",
    "the latter coupling is related to the strong short - range repulsion in the nuclear force .",
    "the resulting fragmentation of the sp strength ( as observed in experimental data ) suggests that this feature must already be included in the description of these couplings .",

    "this is achieved by applying the faddeev equations technique .    also , the resulting formalism splits up in two separate expansions for the 2p1h and the 2h1p components .",
    "although the hole spectral function is of primary interest for comparison with experimental data , it must be stressed that both 2p1h and 2h1p components are needed to generate the self - consistent solution for the sp propagator .",
    "since the formalism involved is the same for both components , we will describe only the forward - going ( 2p1h ) expansion in the rest of this section .",
