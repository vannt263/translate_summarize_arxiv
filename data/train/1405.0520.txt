    "the study of transport properties of active ( self - propelled ) particles has received much attention during the past two decades @xcite .",
    "self - propulsion , as a feature of systems out - of - equilibrium , has been introduced in a variety of contexts to describe , just to name a few , the foraging of organisms in ecology problems @xcite , the motion of bacteria @xcite , and photon migration in multiple scattering media @xcite .",
    "a simple model for self - propulsion is to consider that the particles move with constant speed in a manifold of interest , which in many cases coincides with the two - dimensional space .",
    "this simplified modeling of particle activation has been approximately supported by experimental studies in many real biological systems @xcite and has been used in several theoretical studies of systems that exhibit : collective motion @xcite for interacting self - driven particles , anomalous diffusion @xcite when particles move in heterogeneous landscapes , or motion persistence @xcite if the particles are under the influence of fluctuating torques .",
    "former studies on diffusion theory within the framework of random walks , used persistent random walks ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) and their phenomenological generalizations @xcite to incorporate internal states which sometimes are related to kinematic properties of the walker , such as velocity .",
    "generally , the interest lies on a coarse - grained description of the probability density @xmath0 , of finding a particle at position @xmath1 at time @xmath2 , in which the detailed information about the internal states is irrelevant . as a standard procedure , the limit of the continuum is taken which leads to a partial differential equation for @xmath0 .",
    "depending on the spatial dimension , those pde are reminiscent of the well - known diffusion equation .",
    "for instance , the one - dimensional persistent random walk leads to the telegrapher s equation ( te ) whose solution corrects , in the short time regime , the infinite speed of signal propagation exhibited by the solution to the diffusion equation . for longer times",
    ", the solution to the te shows a transition , from a wave - like behavior at short times , to diffusion - like properties in the long - time regime ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .    that dimensionality plays a significant role in various physical phenomena",
    "has been pointed out by many authors ( see ref . @xcite and",
    "references there in ) , particularly regarding the transmission of information described by the wave equation which favors three dimensions for signal fidelity transmission , a feature desired as a part of an anthropic principle . by contrast , the solution to the two - dimensional wave equation presents signal reverberation making impossible the transmission of sharply defined signals , additionally , the solution is negative for points inside the propagating front if initial data corresponds to an impulse with zero velocity @xcite .    generalizations of the persistent random walk to arbitrary dimension @xmath3 greater than one have been formulated @xcite , however physical interpretation of the partial differential equation obtained after taking the limit of the continuum is hindered due to the presence of partial derivatives of order @xmath4 .",
    "this departure from the one - dimensional case , which contains at most partial derivatives of order two , is conspicuously important in the short time regime . thus deriving",
    "an appropriate transport equation for the coarse - grained probability distribution in dimensions larger than one has been a central issue @xcite .",
    "the description of particles that move with constant speed is also susceptible of the dimension of the system and one dimension seems to be particularly exceptional regarding the te , since this last one has been derived exactly from various equivalent _ microscopic _ models @xcite that consider the random transitions between the velocity states @xmath5 ( also known as goldstein - kac process , see ref .",

    "<S> we derive a novel generalization of the telegrapher s equation . </S>",
    "<S> such generalization preserves the hyperbolic structure of the equation and incorporates memory effects on the diffusive term . while no difference is observed for the mean square displacement computed from the two - dimensional telegrapher s equation and from our generalization , the kurtosis results into a sensible parameter that discriminates between both approximations . </S>",
    "<S> we carried out a comparative analysis in fourier space that shed light on why the telegrapher s equation is not an appropriate model to describe the propagation of particles with constant speed in dispersive media . </S>"
