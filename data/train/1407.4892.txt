    "in order to re - quantize the @xmath34 , we have to assume some correspondence rule between classical variables and quantum operators . to this end , we recall that the two - sphere @xmath2 is viewed as a ( co)adjoint orbit of the rotation group @xmath36 or as @xmath36 coherent states",

    "boundary conditions are discussed to make self - adjoint the dirac operator acting on spinors defined on a domain with boundary .",
    "to get an idea of boundary conditions , we start with the green formula for the laplacian @xmath122 where @xmath123 is a domain bonded by the surface @xmath124 , and where @xmath125 and @xmath126 denote the directional derivatives of @xmath127 and @xmath128 with respect to the outward unit normal @xmath129 to the boundary @xmath124 , respectively . introducing the inner product for scalar functions on the domain @xmath123 and on the boundary by @xmath130 respectively , we rewrite the green formula as @xmath131 where @xmath132 and @xmath133 denote the directional derivatives of @xmath127 and @xmath128 with respect to the outward unit normal @xmath129 , respectively , and where @xmath134 and @xmath135 denote @xmath132 and @xmath133 evaluated on @xmath124 , respectively . from this equation",
