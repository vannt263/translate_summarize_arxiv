    "photonic crystal fibres ( pcf ) are a special class of optical fibres where a remarkable dielectric topology facilitates unique optical properties .",
    "guiding of light is accomplished by a highly regular array of air holes running along the full length of the fibre , see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . in their simplest form the fibres",
    "employ a single dielectric base material ( with dielectric function @xmath1 ) and for the majority of fabricated fibres silica has been the most common choice  @xcite .",
    "this preference has of course been highly motivated by silica s transparency in the visible to infrared regimes , but has also been strongly driven by the highly matured glass technology used in the fabrication of standard telecommunication fibres . however , a growing interest in fibre optics for other wavelengths and light sources has recently led to a renewed interest in other base materials including chalcogenide glass  @xcite , lead silicate glass  @xcite , telluride glass  @xcite , bismuth glass  @xcite , silver halide  @xcite , teflon  @xcite , and plastics / polymers  @xcite .",
    "the huge theoretical and numerical effort in the pcf community has been important in understanding the dispersion and modal properties , but naturally there has been a clear emphasize on silica - based pcfs .",
    "pcfs fabricated from different base materials typically share the same overall geometry with the air holes arranged in a triangular lattice and the core defect being formed by the removal of a single air - hole .",
    "however , it is not yet fully clarified how the established understanding may be transferred to the development of pcfs made from other base materials . to put it simple ; pcfs made from different base materials share the same topology , but to which extend do they also have optical characteristics in common ?    when addressing this question it is important to realize that the otherwise very useful concept of scale - invariance of maxwell s equations  @xcite is of little direct use in this particular context . since pcfs made from different base materials",
    "do not relate to each other by a linear scaling of the dielectric function , @xmath2 , scale invariance can not be applied directly to generalize the results for e.g. silica to other base materials .",
    "electro - magnetic perturbation theory is of course one possible route allowing us to take small changes of the base - material refractive index into account , but in this paper we will discuss and elaborate on an alternative approach which was put forward recently  @xcite .    as a starting point",
    "we take the classical description based on maxwell s equations , which for linear dielectric materials simplify to the following vectorial wave - equation for the electrical field  @xcite @xmath3 here , @xmath4 is the dielectric function which in our case takes the material values of either air or the base material . for a fibre geometry with @xmath5 along the fibre axis",
    "we have @xmath6 and as usual we search for solutions of the plane - wave form @xmath7 with the goal of calculating the dispersion @xmath8 relation .",
    "today , several approaches are available for solving eq .",
    "( [ eq : eee ] ) numerically , including plane - wave , multi - pole , and finite - element methods  @xcite .",
    "such methods will typically be preferred in cases where highly quantitative correct results are called for .",
    "however , numerical studies do not always shine much light on the physics behind so here we will take advantage of several approximations which allow for analytical results in the short - wavelength limit @xmath9 . the key observation allowing for the approximations",
    "is that typically the base material has a dielectric function exceeding that of air significantly , @xmath10 . in that case",
    "it is well - known that the short - wavelength regime is characterized by having the majority of the electrical field residing in the high - index base material while the fraction of electrical field in the air holes is vanishing .",
    "the , at first sight very crude , approximation is simply to neglect the small fraction of electrical power residing in the air - hole regions .",
    "mathematically the approximation is implemented by imposing the boundary condition that @xmath11 is zero at the interfaces @xmath12 to air .",
    "since the displacement field @xmath13 is divergence free we have @xmath14 and the wave equation  ( [ eq : eee ] ) now reduces to @xmath15 and since solutions are of the plane - wave form @xmath16 along the fiber axis we get @xmath17 where @xmath18 is two - dimensional laplacian in the transverse plane",
    ". the essentially scalar nature of this equation makes the problem look somewhat similar to the more traditional scalar approximation @xmath19 that has been applied successfully to pcfs in the short - wavelength regime  @xcite .",
    "however , while that approach took the field and the dielectric function in the air holes into account we shall here solve eq .",
    "( [ eq : eeeapprox ] ) with the boundary condition that @xmath11 is zero at the interfaces to air .",
    "we note that this of course is fully equivalent to solving eq .",
    "( [ eq : scalar1 ] ) with the boundary condition that @xmath20 is zero at the interfaces to air . obviously , the scalar problem posed by eq .",
    "( [ eq : eeeapprox ] ) is separable and formally we have that @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the frequency associated with the longitudinal plane - wave propagation with a linear dispersion relation ( i.e. @xmath23 ) and @xmath24 is the frequency associated with the transverse confinement / localization . at this point",
    "we already note how an arbitrary base - material refractive index @xmath25 enters in the frequency associated with the longitudinal plane - wave propagation .",
    "this is solely possible because we have a dirichlet boundary condition in eq .",
    "( [ eq : eeeapprox ] ) which does not depend on the refractive index of the base material .",
    "in the following we rewrite eq .",
    "( [ eq : omega(beta)1 ] ) as @xmath26 where now @xmath27 is a dimensionless number characterizing the confinement / localization .",
    "it is of purely geometrical origin and thus only depends on the normalized air - hole diameter @xmath28 . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : eeeapprox ] ) it follows that @xmath27 is an eigenvalue governed by a scalar two - dimensional schrdinger equation @xmath29 the same equation was recently studied in work on anti - dot lattices in a two - dimensional electron gas  @xcite and there will be many similarities between such quantum mechanical electron systems and the present electromagnetic problem . in the language of quantum mechanics",
    "the wavefunction @xmath30 is subject to hard - wall boundary conditions corresponding to an infinite potential barrier in the air - hole regions .",
    "the task of calculating the optical dispersion properties has now reduced to solving the scalar two - dimensional schrdinger - like eigenvalue problem posed by eq .",
    "( [ eq : schroding ] ) .",
    "the strength is obviously that eq .",
    "( [ eq : schroding ] ) is material independent and thus we may in principle solve it once and for all to get the geometry dependence of @xmath27 and thereby the optical dispersion of the pcf . in the following",
    "we solve eq .",
    "( [ eq : schroding ] ) for different classes of modes and compare approximate results to corresponding numerically exact finite - element solutions",
    ".      the fundamental space - filling mode is a key concept in understanding the light guiding properties of pcfs .",
    "it is the fundamental de - localized mode of eq .",
    "( [ eq : schroding ] ) in an infinite periodic structure and the corresponding mode index corresponds to an effective material index of the artificial periodic photonic crystal lattice . in the language of band diagrams and brillouin zones it is defined in the @xmath31-point where bloch s theorem is particular simple ; as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] the wave function is subject to a simple neumann boundary condition on the edge @xmath32 of the wigner  seitz cell , i.e. @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a unit vector normal to the boundary @xmath32 .",
    "we thus have to solve an eigenvalue problem on a doubly - connected domain . by a conformal mapping , leaving the laplacian and the boundary conditions invariant , one may in principle transform the hexagonal shape with the circular hole of diameter @xmath35 into a simple annular region of inner diameter @xmath35 and outer diameter @xmath36  @xcite leaving us with an eigenvalue problem in the radial coordinate . finding the exact conformal mapping may be a complicated task so here we simply use the approximate mapping with @xmath37 which serves to conserve the area of the wigner  seitz unit cell . neglecting any small changes to the eigenvalue equation caused during the mapping we get the following eigenvalue equation in the radial coordinate , @xmath38 the solution",
    "is given by a linear combination of the bessel functions @xmath39 and @xmath40 and the eigenvalue is determined by the roots of the following expression @xmath41 in general the equation can not be solved exactly except for at the point @xmath42 as is easily verified by insertion and using that @xmath43 is the @xmath44th zero of the @xmath45th bessel function , i.e. @xmath46 .",
    "in particular we have that @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "however , expanding the left and right - hand sides of eq .",
    "( [ eq : claddingeq ] ) around this point to first order in both @xmath49 and @xmath28 we get an equation from which we may isolate @xmath49 yielding an approximate analytical solution of the form @xmath50 the coefficients are given by expressions involving bessel functions @xmath40 and @xmath51 evaluated at @xmath52 and @xmath53 , see appendix , but for simplicity we here only give the corresponding numerical values of these expressions ; @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 .",
    "while the fundamental space - filling mode , discussed above , is a de - localized mode it is also possible to have strongly localized states , especially in the presence of defects such as one formed by removing an air hole from the otherwise periodic lattice of air holes , see figures  [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] . in this way",
    "light can be guided along the defect thus forming the core of the fibre .",
    "the requirement for corralling the light is of course that the core - defect mode has an eigenvalue @xmath57 not exceeding the corresponding eigenvalue @xmath58 of the surrounding photonic crystal cladding . to put it slightly different",
    "the defect in the air - hole lattice effectively corresponds to a potential well of depth @xmath58 and a radius roughly given by @xmath59 , see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .    in order to calculate the fundamental core - defect mode we first note that in the limit of @xmath28 approaching 1 , the problem can be approximated with that of a two - dimensional spherical infinite potential well with radius @xmath59 , see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . for this problem",
    "the lowest eigenvalue is @xmath60 although this expression yields the correct scaling with @xmath28 , the approximation obviously breaks down for small values of @xmath28 . in that limit",
    "we follow the ideas of glazman _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , who studied quantum conductance through narrow constrictions .",
    "the effective one - dimensional energy barrier for transmission through the constriction of width @xmath61 between two neighbouring holes has a maximum value of @xmath62 in the limit where @xmath35 goes to zero .",
    "we thus approximate the @xmath63 problem with that of a two - dimensional spherical potential well of height @xmath62 and radius @xmath64 , @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the heaviside step function which is zero for @xmath67 and unity for @xmath68 .",
    "the lowest eigenvalue @xmath69 for this problem is the first root of the following equation @xmath70 in the case where the potential @xmath62 is replaced by an infinite potential the first root is given by @xmath71 . lowering the confinement potential obviously shifts down the eigenvalue and in the present case",
    "the eigenvalue is roughly @xmath72 .",
    "in fact , expanding the equation to first order in @xmath73 around e.g. @xmath74 we get a straight forward , but long , expression with the numerical value @xmath75 which is in excellent agreement with a numerical solution of the equation . correcting for the low-@xmath28 behaviour we thus finally get @xmath76 for the first high - order mode we may apply a very similar analysis .",
    "this mode has a finite angular momentum of @xmath77 with a radial @xmath78 solution yielding @xmath79 here , @xmath80 is the second eigenvalue of the two - dimensional spherical potential well of height @xmath62 and radius @xmath64 .",
    "again , it can be found from an equation very similar to eq .",
    "( [ eq : pi2 ] ) .",
    "above we have solved the geometrical eigenvalue problem analytically by means of various approximations . in this section",
    "we compare the quality of these results by direct comparison to a numerically exact solution of the two - dimensional eigenvalue problem .",
    "the developments in computational physics and engineering have turned numerical solutions of partial differential equations in the direction of a standard task . here , we employ a finite - element approach@xcite to numerically solve eq .",
    "( [ eq : schroding ] ) and calculate @xmath81 versus @xmath28 .",
    "we employ an adaptive mesh algorithm to provide efficient convergence . for cladding mode",
    "we implement eq .",
    "( [ eq : schroding_fsm ] ) directly while for the defect modes we solve eq .",
    "( [ eq : schroding ] ) on a finite domain of approximate size @xmath82 with the defect located in the center of the domain . for @xmath28",
    "down to around 0.1 we have found this to sufficient to adequate convergence for the strongly localized defect states , thus avoiding strong proximity from the domain - edge boundary condition which for simplicity has been of the dirichlet type .",
    "figure  [ fig5 ] summarizes our numerical results for the first cladding mode @xmath58 as well for the two first core - defect modes @xmath57 and @xmath83 .",
    "the dashed lines indicate the corresponding approximate expressions in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : gammacl ] ) , ( [ eq : gammac1 ] ) , and ( [ eq : gammac2 ] ) obtained by analytical means .",
    "as seen the qualitative agreement is excellent , but in order to facilitate also quantitative applications of the results we also include the results of numerical least - square error fits below .",
    "the thin solid lines show the expressions    @xmath84    which match the numerical data within a relative error of less than @xmath85 around the most important cut - off region @xmath86 .",
    "with eq .",
    "( [ eq : omega(beta ) ] ) at hand we have now provided a unified theory of the dispersion relation in the short - wavelength regime for pcfs with arbitrary base materials and eq .",
    "( [ eq : omega(beta ) ] ) illustrates how geometrical confinement modifies the linear free - space dispersion relation .    in fibre optics",
    "it is common to express the dispersion properties in terms of the effective index @xmath87 versus the free - space wavelength @xmath88 . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : omega(beta ) ] ) it follows straightforwardly that @xmath89 which obviously is in qualitative agreement with the accepted view that @xmath90 increases monotonously with decreasing wavelength and approaches @xmath25 in the asymptotic short - wavelength limit as reported for _",
    "e.g. _ silica - based pcfs  @xcite .",
    "similarly , the group - velocity @xmath91 becomes @xmath92 while the phase velocity @xmath93 becomes @xmath94 the group - velocity dispersion is most often quantified by the wave - guide dispersion parameter @xmath95 which becomes @xmath96^{-3/2},\\ ] ] where any possible material dispersion @xmath97 has been neglected .",
    "we note that since @xmath98 the geometry of the air - hole lattice always causes a positive wave - guide dispersion parameter .",
    "large - mode area pcfs belong to the regime with @xmath9 were we predict the following general magnitude of the wave - guide dispersion of a large - mode area pcf @xmath99 finally , the recently suggested parameter @xmath100",
    "@xcite can be shown to be a purely geometrically defined parameter in the large - mode area limit . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : omega(beta ) ] ) it follows straightforwardly that @xmath101 this implies that the endlessly single - mode property  @xcite is a wave phenomena independent of the base material refractive index of purely geometrical origin .",
    "higher - order modes are only supported for @xmath102 , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , for which @xmath103  @xcite .",
    "in the previous sections substantial analytical progress was made , but we still remain to address the question to which extend the basic assumption behind eq .",
    "( [ eq : eeeapprox ] ) holds except that it becomes exact for the fundamental modes as @xmath104 approaches zero . in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] we compare the analytical results for the effective index in eq .",
    "( [ eq : neff ] ) to results obtained by fully - vectorial plane - wave simulations  @xcite of eq .",
    "( [ eq : eee ] ) . for the fundamental space - filling mode",
    "we have employed a basis of @xmath105 plane waves while for the core - defect modes we have employed a super - cell configuration of size @xmath106 in the case of @xmath107 .",
    "panel ( a ) shows results for the fundamental space - filling mode for various values of the base refractive index . as clearly seen the theory agrees excellently in the short - wavelength limit while pronounced deviations occur as the wavelength increases and the field penetrates deeper into the air hole regions and also vectorial effects become important as reported in  @xcite .",
    "similar conclusion applies to the corresponding results in panel ( c ) for the fundamental core - defect mode . while @xmath107 is a case of particular technological interest because of its endlessly single - mode property we would like to emphasize that equivalent agreement",
    "is found for other values of @xmath28 ( results not shown ) .",
    "however , since the success of the approximation in eq .",
    "( [ eq : eeeapprox ] ) really is that @xmath108 and @xmath109 for the core and cladding results , respectively , there will of course be a small @xmath35-dependence .",
    "however , this also indicates that the agreement will increase with an increasing refractive index @xmath25 of the base material as has also been observed for even higher values of @xmath25 than those studied in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ( results not shown ) .",
    "it is today more than 10 years ago that the pcf was invented by russell and co - workers  @xcite and there is a still growing community of researchers directing their efforts toward fabrication and experimental studies of silica - based pcfs as well as quantitative modelling of the optical properties . at the same time",
    "the community is obviously facing the challenges and opportunities of new exciting fiber materials .",
    "pcfs made from different base materials share the same topology so it seems quite natural to assume that they also have at least some basic optical properties in common .",
    "let s return to the question posed in the introduction : to which extend do pcfs made from different materials have optical characteristics in common ?",
    "the present work do to some extend address this question .",
    "most importantly we illustrate how the waveguide dispersion originates from the geometrical transverse confinement / localization of the mode and how the endlessly single - mode property arises as a sole consequence of the geometry which acts as a modal sieve .",
    "in particular we have shown how pcfs are endlessly single - mode for @xmath110 irrespectively of the base material an analytical expression for the wave - guide dispersion parameter applicable to large - mode area fibres .",
    "for small - core pcfs our theory provides qualitative correct results though more quantitative insight still calls for fully vectorial simulations , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "however , for large - mode area pcfs our expressions not only gives qualitative insight , but also quantitative correct expressions which may be used in straightforward design of large - mode area pcfs with special properties with respect to the group - velocity dispersion and the susceptibility of the fundamental mode with respect to longitudinal non - uniformities  @xcite .",
