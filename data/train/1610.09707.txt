    "the single - particle degrees of freedom constitute the natural basis for any nuclear theory .",
    "however , bulk properties which are more important in medium- and heavy - mass nuclei are traditionally described by means of collective models . in particular",
    ", the bohr - mottelson model @xcite ( bmm ) of nuclear surface oscillations provides an intuitive phenomenology as well as a geometric classification of the collective motion .",
    "alternatively , a group theoretical description of nuclear collective properties is offered by the interacting boson model ( ibm ) @xcite , which is basically a pair coupling model , with coherent monopole and quadrupole pairs of fermions approximated as bosons .",
    "the most general ibm hamiltonian can be expressed in terms of the geometrical shape variables of bmm by means of an intrinsic coherent state @xcite .",
    "the resulted differential equation is , however , far more involved , bearing only a marginal equivalence to the bohr hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "this is not surprising given the conceptual distinction between the two models . indeed , whereas bmm is purely geometrical , ibm is actually a large truncation of the shell model .",
    "however , in the earlier attempts to relate the two approaches @xcite , it was found that the limiting dynamical symmetries @xmath4 @xcite , @xmath5 @xcite , and @xmath6 @xcite , identified as subgroup chains of the @xmath7 symmetry of ibm , have analogues in bmm represented by its solvable instances corresponding to the shape phases describing a spherical vibrator @xcite , an axially symmetric rotor @xcite , and a @xmath0-soft rotor @xcite respectively .",
    "the search for explicit mappings between the two models in their solvable limits revealed that a large range of bmm results can be reproduced in various contraction limits of the ibm @xcite .",
    "the fact that , besides the microscopical upbringing , ibm can be understood also as a compactification of bmm serves as a bridge between the single - particle degrees of freedom and the purely geometrical collective variables defining the shape of the nuclear surface .    the presence of a symmetry is directly related to the exact solvability of the associated hamiltonian , whose solutions can be indexed by many - body quantum numbers .",
    "this is a simpler explanation for the equivalence of the ibm dynamical symmetries with bmm solvable limits .",
    "therefore , a lot of effort was directed to find other exactly solvable cases of the bmm @xcite and their corresponding symmetries . as a result",
    ", it was found that variations of the bmm with a square well potential have analytical solutions adequate for a similar algebraic description of the critical points of the transitions between the aforementioned dynamical symmetries .",
    "indeed , the solutions @xmath8 @xcite and @xmath1 @xcite , associated with the critical points of the transition lines @xmath9 and @xmath10 , are closely related to the five - dimensional euclidean symmetry .",
    "more precisely , it is exactly realized in the former and only partially in the latter @xcite",
    ". the elusive group structure of the @xmath1 critical point at first glance might be ascribed to the adopted approximations .",
    "however , the same algebraic properties are found in its @xmath0-rigid counterpart , the @xmath2 model @xcite , which is exactly separable and solvable but acts in a reduced three - dimensional shape phase space .",
    "thus , regardless of the description associated with the @xmath0 shape variable , the relation of the critical point solutions for the transition between spherical and axially symmetric shapes with the euclidean group is invariable .",
    "this aspect together with the phenomenological compatibility between the @xmath0-stable and @xmath0-rigid conditions inspired a relaxation of the @xmath1 critical point solution in terms of a @xmath0 rigidity parameter .",
    "basically , the measure of the @xmath0 rigidity combines the quantum treatments of the collective excitations corresponding to the limiting shape phase spaces of @xmath2 and @xmath1 solutions .",
    "the intermediary situation obviously involves a mixed shape phase space , _ i.e. _ , something between three and five dimensions . in this paper",
    "we will show that some of the known critical point axially symmetric nuclei prefer this arrangement .",
    "moreover , the degree of the shape phase mixing have a rather smooth evolution in well defined sequences of nuclei .",
    "a similar program was used to define the @xmath3 critical point solution @xcite as well as to combine some exactly separable variations of the @xmath1 model to their @xmath0-rigid limits @xcite .",
    "the general bohr model @xcite for quadrupole shapes has in total five variables : two associated with the nuclear shape oscillations and three euler angles describing the rotational motion . restricting the @xmath0 shape variable to certain values ,",
    "we can obtain more simple models @xcite due to smaller number of degrees of freedom .",
    "indeed , the fixed @xmath0 variable becomes a simple parameter , and the quantum hamiltonian associated with such a case will have a different structure according to the pauli quantization prescription @xcite .",
    "an interesting situation arises in more restrained conditions of a prolate @xmath0-rigid system ( @xmath11 ) @xcite . due to the symmetry properties ,",
    "its rotational motion can be described by only two euler angles and therefore the whole system will have just three variables instead of five as in the usual bohr model .",
    "the small - angle approximations made on the @xmath0 shape variable in @xmath0-stable models is quite similar to the @xmath0-rigid conditions .",
    "this correspondence led to the idea of a hybrid model based on the interplay between @xmath0-stable and @xmath0-rigid collective excitations @xcite .",
    "it was achieved by introducing a control parameter @xmath12 called @xmath0 rigidity , which mediates a coupling between the two types of collective excitations : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the potential energy .",
    "the usual five - dimensional kinetic operator of a @xmath0-soft bohr hamiltonian reads @xmath15 , \\label{ts}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 denote the three projections of the angular momentum on the principal axes of the intrinsic frame of reference . here",
    ", @xmath0 softness is related to the property of the system to have non - axial fluctuations around an equilibrium geometry .",
    "further , depending on the potential energy , we can have @xmath0-stable or @xmath0-unstable conditions .",
    "in the first case the potential has a single localized minimum in the @xmath0 shape variable , while in the latter it does not depend on @xmath0 at all .",
    "this terminology is unfortunately often misused , but very clear definitions can be found in ref.@xcite . in contradistinction ,",
    "the prolate @xmath0-rigid kinetic energy operator @xcite defined in a three - dimensional shape phase space , @xmath17 , \\label{tr}\\ ] ] is associated with a potential energy with an extremely sharp @xmath0 minimum which practically does not allow fluctuations .",
    "the lack of the third component of angular momentum in the above equation is due to the quantum mechanical restriction that the rotation can not take place around the symmetry axis .    for the purpose of this study",
    ", @xmath18 and @xmath19 will be associated with the @xmath2 and @xmath1 models respectively , which share the same infinite square well shape of the separated @xmath20 potential .",
    "the differences in the quantum description of the two situations arising from different shape phase space dimensions are resolved by a suitable weighting of the shape phase metric associated with the full hamiltonian ( [ ht ] ) .",
    "the origin of this deformed shape phase space lies in the general definition of the kinetic energy of the collective hamiltonian as a laplacian operator in curvilinear coordinates @xcite : @xmath21 @xmath22 is the jacobian of the transformation from the quadrupole coordinates @xmath23 to the curvilinear ones @xmath24 defined by the metric tensor : @xmath25 while @xmath26 is a symmetric positive - definite bitensor matrix . in the general five - dimensional bohr model ,",
    "this bitensor is just the transformation tensor @xmath27 up to a common mass parameter and the kinetic operator ( [ pauli ] ) acquires the well known form of the laplace - beltrami operator @xcite .",
    "this is no longer valid if we want to introduce the rigidity dependence .",
    "however , it can be easily shown that the @xmath28 dependent weighting factor arises naturally in the definition of the @xmath20 wave function if we consider the following mass tensor components in the general collective hamiltonian : @xmath29 in this way we will have , in the axial rigid limit , infinite inertial parameters for the conjugate momentum of the @xmath0 shape variable and the angular velocity @xmath30 around the third intrinsic axis @xcite .",
    "as the aim of the paper is to study critical point nuclei , we will treat the schrdinger equation associated with ( [ ht ] ) as in case of the well known @xmath1 model @xcite , where an approximate separation of @xmath20 and @xmath0 angular variables is achieved through a series of approximations conditioned by the following separated form for the total reduced potential : @xmath32 in case of a very sharp @xmath0 potential centered around @xmath11 , the rotational term from ( [ ts ] ) can be very well approximated by @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the total angular momentum vector operator .    assuming a factorized total wave function @xmath35 where @xmath36 are wigner functions of total angular momentum @xmath37 and its projections @xmath38 and @xmath39 on the body - fixed and laboratory - fixed @xmath40 axis respectively , the associated schrdinger equation is separated into @xmath20 and @xmath0 parts : @xmath41\\xi(\\beta)\\nonumber\\\\ & & = \\epsilon_{\\beta}\\xi(\\beta),\\label{b}\\\\ & & ( 1-\\chi)\\left[-\\frac{1}{\\beta^{2}_{0}\\sin{3\\gamma}}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\gamma}\\sin{3\\gamma}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\gamma}\\right.\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\left.+\\frac{k^{2}}{4\\beta^{2}_{0}}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sin^{2}{\\gamma}}-\\frac{4}{3}\\right)+v(\\gamma)\\right]\\eta(\\gamma)=\\epsilon_{\\gamma}\\eta(\\gamma),\\label{ecg}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 .",
    "@xmath43 is a static `` average '' of @xmath20 which assures an approximated adiabatic separation of the @xmath20 and @xmath0 surface oscillations .",
    "the advantages and shortcomings of this approximation were extensively analysed in ref.@xcite .",
    "the angular dependence was extracted through averaging on the wigner states .",
    "the @xmath0 equation is treated as in the usual @xmath0-stable case @xcite by applying a harmonic approximation with respect to @xmath11 for the involved trigonometric functions .",
    "the lowest order symmetry obeying @xmath0 potential @xmath44 gets the same treatment such that constant @xmath45 will acquire the role of the @xmath0 oscillation stiffness . as a result , the @xmath0 differential equation becomes : @xmath46\\eta(\\gamma)\\nonumber\\\\ & & = \\epsilon'_{\\gamma}\\eta(\\gamma),\\,\\,\\,\\,\\epsilon'_{\\gamma}=\\frac{\\epsilon_{\\gamma}}{1-\\chi}+\\frac{k^{2}}{3\\beta^{2}_{0}}. \\label{ecga}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] its similarity with the radial equation for a two - dimensional harmonic oscillator is obvious , such that one readily obtains the corresponding solutions as : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a normalization constant , @xmath49 with @xmath50 for @xmath51 even and @xmath52 for @xmath51 odd , respectively .    in accordance to @xmath1 @xcite and @xmath2 @xcite critical point solutions , we will consider here an anharmonic behaviour reflected into a square well shape of the potential : @xmath53 with @xmath54 indicating the position of the infinite wall .",

    "the transition probability can also be given in a factorized form as @xcite : @xmath71 @xmath72 is the integral over the @xmath0 shape variable of only the second term from ( [ te2 ] ) , @xmath73 because in the present model @xmath0 is very small and consequently @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "@xmath75 is the clebsch - gordan coefficient dictating the angular momentum selection rules , while @xmath76 is defined as : @xmath77",
    "in order to find experimental counterparts of the shape phase space mixing , a thorough analysis is required on the evolution of its spectral properties as function of @xmath28 . besides @xmath28 , the total energy function ( [ et ] ) expressed in @xmath78 units , depends also on @xmath45 and @xmath43 through the @xmath0 energy contribution . however , the excitation energies of the ground and @xmath20 band states are independent of @xmath45 and @xmath43 , while the @xmath0 band ( @xmath79 ) is shifted by the amount @xmath80 therefore , we visualized in fig.[x3x5 ] the evolution of the energy spectrum corresponding to the ground and @xmath20 bands and few strong @xmath81 transition probabilities only as a function of @xmath28 . the energy spectrum depicted in fig.[x3x5](a ) shows that the energy of all ground and @xmath20 states decreases linearly with @xmath28 .",
    "although not shown , the evolution of the even @xmath37 @xmath0 band states follows those of the ground band states with a constant shift in energy .",
    "the slope of the energy level curves is almost the same for states belonging to the same vibrational band , with a variable increase with the energy of the state depending on the band . as a result ,",
    "the steepest decrease in energy is associated to the highest vibrational quantum number . due to different rates of energy decreasing , some levels belonging to different vibrational bands intersect each other at some values of the rigidity @xmath28 .",
    "for example at @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 states are degenerated , while the degeneracy of the @xmath85 and @xmath86 states happens at @xmath87 .",
    "the last intersection is very close to the case of @xmath3 where the @xmath0-rigid / stable mixing is equal . regarding this special case",
    ", we can see that its @xmath88 state , which was shown in ref.@xcite that satisfies exactly the euclidean dynamical symmetry @xmath89 , is positioned right in the middle between @xmath90 and @xmath91 states of the first excited @xmath20 band . for smaller values of @xmath28 , the @xmath88 energy level shifts toward @xmath92 , and when @xmath28 is increased it gets closer to the @xmath93 state .",
    "although this observation is just a numerical peculiarity , it serves as another example of the median role played by the @xmath3 model in the relation between @xmath2 and @xmath1 .",
    "as all states decrease in energy when @xmath28 increases , it is expected that the quadrupole transition probabilities would gain in value . indeed , as can be seen from fig.[x3x5](b ) , all @xmath81 transitions connecting the low lying states have greater probabilities for increased values of @xmath28 . in contradistinction to the energy levels , the @xmath94 rates all have distinct mostly nonlinear evolution from @xmath95 to @xmath96 .",
    "the transition most sensitive to @xmath28 variation is @xmath97 , which might be taken as a distinguishable observable instead of the purely theoretical rigidity parameter . on the other hand ,",
    "the most insensitive transitions are the first inband transitions from the two @xmath20 bands .",
    "moreover , their evolution with @xmath28 shown in fig.[x3x5](c ) is not even monotonous , but has maximum points in the region of @xmath98 .",
    "the model is applied to @xmath1 and @xmath2 nuclei as well as to their isotopic and isotonic neighbours .",
    "the experimental ground , @xmath0 and available @xmath20 band energies normalized to the excitation energy of the @xmath99 state are fitted against rigidity @xmath28 which completely describes the ground and @xmath20 excited bands , and the parameter @xmath100 ( [ d ] ) fixing the @xmath0 band energy shift in respect to the ground state .",
    "the fitness of the present theoretical description is judged by the standard error @xmath101^{2}}. \\label{sigma}\\ ] ] as the minimization of the above quantity tends to be disadvantageous for the low energy states , we consider for the fitting procedure for the ground band only experimental data up to @xmath102 .",
    "such a restriction assures an overall realistic fit of the involved free parameters .",
    "there are two regions of the nuclide chart where such critical phenomena are expected .",
    "the first is the set of rare earth nuclei around @xmath103 where the @xmath1 behaviour was originally found .",
    "the other domain is localized around @xmath104 and consists of os and pt isotopes where @xmath2 candidates were pointed out @xcite and a second island of @xmath1 experimental realisation was predicted @xcite . in what follows",

    "although not considered as @xmath1 representatives , the criticality of the marginal @xmath103 isotopes , @xmath131ce and @xmath134er nuclei , is also well known @xcite .",
    "the comparison of the theoretical and experimental energy spectra made in table [ tab:1 ] shows that the best agreement is obtained especially for these two nuclei .",
    "their deviation from @xmath1 symmetry is also supported by their high values of @xmath28 which shows a more accentuated @xmath0-rigid structure .",
    "although the @xmath20 band states are the main source of discrepancies for all four @xmath103 nuclei , the model predicts quite well the position of the first and even second @xmath20 bandhead state for @xmath132nd and @xmath133dy . especially good reproduction is obtained in all cases for the @xmath0 band states . in what concerns the ground to ground @xmath137 transition rates compared in fig.[tg ] , the non vanishing @xmath28 values obtained in the fits for @xmath132nd and @xmath134er offered an excellent agreement with experimental data . while the poorer agreement with experimental spectrum for @xmath133dy is perpetuated also to the @xmath137 transition probabilities .",
    "looking once again in table [ tab:1 ] at the fitted @xmath28 values , one observes that there is a regular evolution of the @xmath0 rigidity along the @xmath103 nuclei . as can be seen from fig.[n ]",
    ", the maximal @xmath0-stable softness is obviously at the two purely @xmath1 nuclei , @xmath135sm and @xmath136gd , which starts to abate in both directions towards @xmath131ce and @xmath134er nuclei , exhibiting the highest @xmath28 values .",
    "the @xmath28 values of the latter two nuclei are not exceedingly high but actually just above the @xmath138 value , a fact which indicated these nuclei as possible candidates of the @xmath3 symmetry @xcite .",
    "the @xmath139 region provided similarly good results from fits of the @xmath0 rigidity .",
    "the rms values from table ii are , however , lower than those reported in table iii for the pt isotopes .",
    "once again , the first @xmath20 band head is well reproduced , with exceptional matches in the cases of @xmath140os and @xmath141pt .",
    "the major distinction from the results of the @xmath103 nuclei is the larger deviations from experimental @xmath0 band states , which is ascribed to the possible triaxial deformation of these nuclei .",
    "also , while the values of parameter @xmath100 are highly variate in @xmath103 isotones , for os and pt isotopes these are almost constant for each chain , with a lower average in the case of pt nuclei .",
    "this is in agreement with the conspicuously constant structure of the observed low energy spectra for these nuclei @xcite .",
    "moreover , their isotopic trajectory in the ibm symmetry triangle was found to be quiet concentrated and positioned centrally near the shape phase transition region @xcite .",
    "this aspect shows why these nuclei are found as experimental realisations of very different theoretical approaches .",
    "studying now the obtained @xmath28 values , we can see that the os isotopes , with an exception , prefer small rigidity , while all considered pt nuclei are highly @xmath0-rigid .",
    "the lowest @xmath28 values for pt isotopes are obtained for @xmath142pt and @xmath143pt , which are near the @xmath138 instance of the @xmath3 model .",
    "it is then not surprising that these nuclei were considered as good experimental realizations of the @xmath3 model @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the small values of @xmath28 obtained for @xmath144os supports their candidacy for the @xmath1 model proposed in ref.@xcite .",
    "@xmath145os nucleus have however a non - negligible shape phase mixing",
    ". moreover , its lighter neighbour have an even higher @xmath0 rigidity .",
    "this ascending trend of @xmath0 rigidity with decreasing neutron number @xmath146 shown in fig.[z ] continues to the fully @xmath0-rigid nucleus @xmath147os which is one of the best @xmath2 model candidates @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that a similar fitting of the @xmath147os energy spectrum confirmed its complete rigidity .",
    "the same is true for the other @xmath2 candidate nucleus , @xmath148pt , from which @xmath0 rigidity subsides when @xmath146 decreases .",
    "as can be seen from the same fig.[z ] , this evolution is even smoother than in the os nuclei , being almost linear , but does not continue onto @xmath149pt .",
    "although , its fitting results are satisfactory , the latter nucleus completely falls out of this trend with a very high @xmath0 rigidity .",
    "this change , makes the @xmath142pt nucleus a singular or a terminal point in the evolution of @xmath0 rigidity throughout this specific isotopic interval .",
    "a similar but less striking minimum is observed in the @xmath149os nucleus with respect to its isotopic chain , which has a slightly smaller @xmath28 value in comparison to both its neighbouring isotopes .",
    "moreover , both critical nuclei , @xmath142pt and @xmath149os , have the same neutron number @xmath150 and their @xmath28 values are the closest realizations of @xmath3 and @xmath1 limits , respectively . while the evolution of @xmath0 rigidity in os isotopes is in agreement with the ibm results of ref.@xcite , the increase in @xmath0 rigidity for pt isotopes is in contradiction with recent studies and the classical conception about heavier pt isotopes as good @xmath6 realisations .",
    "indeed , the same interval of pt isotopes exhibits an increasing @xmath0-unstable softness for higher neutron numbers in the results obtained within the self - consistent hartree - fock - bogoliubov approximation @xcite and ibm with @xcite and without configuration mixing @xcite .",
    "it is opportune to remark here about the close similarities between the spectral properties of the @xmath0-unstable and @xmath0-rigid collective models @xcite , which originate in the common @xmath0 independence of the collective potential . in the first case",
    "it is by choice , whereas in the later it is due to mathematical constraint . on the other hand , some spectral characteristics , for example @xmath0-band staggering , in some of the heavier pt isotopes which are historically identified as @xmath0-unstable can be reproduced only by considering some degree of @xmath0-rigid @xcite or non - dynamical triaxiality @xcite .",
    "@xmath0-rigid - like triaxial rotations with non - vanishing @xmath39 but without the compulsory dynamical triaxiality were suggested also for the @xmath103 nuclei @xcite .",
    "these arguments show that @xmath0 rigidity is a useful concept in understanding the shape evolution in the regions of the nuclide chart considered in the present study .",
    "the comparison of theoretical and experimental electromagnetic transitions within the ground state band for these nuclei offers additional information about the evolution of the @xmath0 rigidity in these two intervals of nuclei .",
    "first of all , we must mention the excellent agreement with experiment in the cases of @xmath151os and @xmath143pt .",
    "the available experimental data for the os isotopes are found to be consistent with the evolution of their calculated @xmath0 rigidities . indeed , because the @xmath28 value of the @xmath142os nucleus , although very little , still deviates from the uniform decrease of @xmath0 rigidity with neutron number , the corresponding electromagnetic properties do not fall into the present theoretical description .",
    "a similar discordance is observed for the already discussed @xmath149pt nucleus , while its heavier isotope shows just some signs of redressment .",
    "it is worth mentioning that both nuclei are known to exhibit evidences of shape coexistence @xcite .",
    "the @xmath28 value of @xmath142pt recommends it as a typical @xmath3 candidate",
    ". however @xmath143pt seems a more suitable @xmath3 representative in the prism of the additional accord between theoretical and experimental transition probabilities @xcite .",
    "an interesting situation is also obtained in the @xmath141pt nucleus , where the energy spectrum fits prefer high rigidity while the electromagnetic transitions are of the @xmath0-stable type .",
    "the three sets of nuclei , @xmath103 isotones , os and pt isotopes show a regular evolution of the @xmath0 rigidity .",
    "while the @xmath103 nuclei present a @xmath0-stable valley at @xmath135sm and @xmath136gd nuclei , the os and pt isotopes have monotonous decreasing and respectively increasing of @xmath0 rigidity as function of neutron number @xmath146 with some irregular isotopes at the end and respectively start of the considered intervals of nuclei .",
    "these findings are also supported by the evolution of deformation in these isotonic and isotopic chains .",
    "indeed , as can be seen from fig.[b2 ] , the average deformation calculated within the present model is in a qualitative agreement with the deformation @xmath152 calculated in the framework of the relativistic mean - field ( rmf ) theory @xcite . due to the scaled nature of the bohr model results ,",
    "the average of the @xmath20 deformation is calculated here with eq.([bm ] ) , by fixing the position @xmath54 of the infinite wall to reproduce the rmf @xmath152 value of the nucleus with the best fit regarding energy spectrum . in this way",
    ", the ground state average deformation will depend only on the geometry of the shape phase space by means of parameter @xmath28 , just like the spectral properties of the ground and @xmath20 bands .",
    "the combination of prolate @xmath0-rigid and @xmath0-stable rotation - vibration kinetic operators in connection with a flat potential was used to formulate a hybrid critical point model which has as limiting cases the @xmath2 and @xmath1 solutions .",
    "the relative strength of the rigid and stable components is managed through a so - called rigidity parameter @xmath28 .",
    "this parameter serves as a weighting measure which bridges the three - dimensional and five - dimensional shape phase spaces of its limiting realizations .",
    "the analytical consequences of the shape phase mixing was briefly discussed in general and extensively explained when applied to the critical point solutions . as a result",
    ", we obtained a relaxation of the @xmath1 critical point model through its @xmath0 rigidity . in this way",
    ", we not only improved the agreement with experiment for the well known critical point nuclei but also identified new candidates . because of the adopted approximations regarding the separation of variables , the energy spectrum of ground and @xmath20 bands of the resulting model depends only on the rigidity @xmath28 , while the @xmath0 band has an additional adjustable energy shift .",
    "the numerical applications of the model were directed towards nuclei known to exhibit critical behaviour in the transition from spherical to axially deformed shapes . as a result , many nuclei from @xmath103 isotonic and @xmath153 isotopic chains were found to have non vanishing @xmath0 rigidity , pointing to a sizable shape phase space mixing . moreover , specific regularities within its evolution with neutron or proton numbers were evidenced and confirmed by experimental data regarding energy spectra and electromagnetic properties as well as rmf calculations of the ground state deformation .    this result might be used to draw some conclusions about the microscopic structure of these nuclei .",
    "indeed , the @xmath0 rigidity influences specific mass inertial parameters of the general collective hamiltonian , which depend on the choice of a particular microscopic nuclear energy density functional or effective interaction when a microscopic theory is mapped into collective variables @xcite .",

    "<S> spectral properties of nuclei near the critical point of the quantum phase transition between spherical and axially symmetric shapes are studied in a hybrid collective model which combines the @xmath0-stable and @xmath0-rigid collective conditions through a rigidity parameter . </S>",
    "<S> the model in the lower and upper limits of the rigidity parameter recovers the @xmath1 and @xmath2 solutions respectively , while in the equally mixed case it corresponds to the @xmath3 critical point symmetry . numerical applications of the model on nuclei from regions known for critical behavior reveal a sizable shape phase mixing and its evolution with neutron or proton numbers . </S>",
    "<S> the model also enables a better description of energy spectra and electromagnetic transitions for these nuclei . </S>"
