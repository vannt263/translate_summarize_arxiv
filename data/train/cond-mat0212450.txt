    "the double - exchange ( de ) model @xcite is one of the basic ones in the theory of magnetism .",

    "@xcite substantially advanced our understanding of the properties of the de model @xcite .",
    "most of the papers dealing with the model , starting from classical paper by de gennes @xcite , considered the de hamiltonian with infinite exchange ( and with the addition of the antiferromagnetic superexchange , which is crucial for the explanation of magnetic properties of manganites ) .",
    "however lately many properties of the model for arbitrary strength of the exchange were analyzed @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we calculate the temperature of a paramagnetic - ferromagnetic transition @xmath0 in a double - exchange model for arbitrary electron dispersion law , concentration and relation between the exchange coupling and the electron band width by formulating and solving the dmfa equations .",

    ", we formulated the dynamical mean field approximation equations for the double - exchange model with classical spins for arbitrary electron dispersion law , concentration and relation between the exchange and the electron bandwidth . in the vicinity of the paramagnetic - ferromagnetic transition critical temperature @xmath0 , these equations were reduced to a mf equation , describing a single spin in an effective field , proportional to the macroscopic magnetization , and we obtained explicit formula for the @xmath0 . for the semi - circular electron density of states we explicitly calculated the transition temperature as a function of the exchange interaction and electron concentration"
