    "visvanathan & sandage ( 1977 ) first noted from their data on 9 nearby clusters that the more luminous early - type galaxies tended to have redder colours .",
    "bower , lucey , & ellis ( 1992 ; hereafter ble92 ) later studied this _ colour - magnitude _ ( _ c - m _ ) relation in detail using high precision photometry of early - type galaxies in the virgo and coma clusters and found very little scatter about the mean _ c - m _ relation .",
    "thus , there appeared to be a marked homogeneity in the present - day early - type cluster galaxy population .",
    "recently , kodama & arimoto ( 1997 ; hereafter ka97 ) compared the predictions of their evolutionary models of elliptical galaxies with the _ c - m _",
    "diagrams for early - type galaxies in two distant clusters , abell 2390 at @xmath4 and abell 851 at @xmath5 , and showed that the origin of the _ c - m _ relation was primarily due to the mean stellar metallicity of the early - types being a function of total magnitude . in this paper",
    "we present a more thorough study of the evolution of the _ c - m _ relation by using 17 clusters at cosmological distances to detect the colour evolution of cluster early - type galaxies directly and then comparing the results with the models .",
    "this will enable us to put even stronger constraints on the formation of early - type galaxies in clusters .",
    "the photometric evolution of early - type galaxies in @xmath6 clusters was previously examined by several authors ( e.g. , ellis et al .",
    "1985 ; couch , shanks & pence  1985 ; aragn - salamanca et al .  1993 ) .",
    "aragn - salamanca et al .",
    "( 1993 ) traced the evolution of the ` red envelope ' from the optical - near - infrared colour distribution of galaxies in 10 clusters with redshifts @xmath7 and concluded that the detected evolution was consistent with the passive ageing of stellar populations formed before @xmath8 .",
    "a potential problem with these studies is that the early - type galaxies had to be selected by their spectral energy distributions and colours , thereby increasing the possibility of contamination from other galaxy types .",
    "the advent of the hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) _ , with its spectacular high - resolution images , has made the morphological classification of distant galaxies possible .",
    "furthermore , thanks to the _ hst _ , large ground - based telescopes , and the high quality of astronomical detectors , much fainter limiting magnitudes can now be reached .",
    "an additional advantage of _ hst _ photometry comes from the reduction of the sky background at longer wavelengths compared to that achieved with ground - based observations ( e.g. the background in space is 8 times fainter in the @xmath9-band ) , thereby reducing the photometric errors at faint limits significantly ( ellis et al .  1997 ; hereafter e97 ) .",
    "these improvements now make it possible to examine the evolution of early - type galaxies over a much wider luminosity and redshift range .    the _",
    "c - m _ relation is a powerful tool for quantifying the colour evolution of early - type galaxies as a function of redshift since it can be observed up to very high redshifts .",
    "dickinson ( 1996 ) showed that the _ c - m _ relation is already recognizable at @xmath10 .",
    "the zero - point of the _ c - m _ relation at high redshift provides direct information on the properties of early - type galaxies in general . on the other hand , the slope of the _ c - m _ relation has information on differential properties of early - type galaxies as a function of luminosity or galaxy size .",
    "stanford , eisenhardt , & dickinson ( 1995 ; 1998 , hereafter sed98 ) presented _ c - m",
    "_ relations for morphologically selected early - type galaxies in 19 clusters out to @xmath11 . when they compared their optical - near - infrared _ c - m _ relations to that of coma , they found no significant change in either the slope or the scatter as a function of redshift .",
    "they did , however , observe a progressive blueing with redshift of the average colour in a manner consistent with the passive evolution of an old stellar population formed in a burst at an early cosmic epoch .",
    "e97 also analyzed the _",
    "c - m _ relations of three distant clusters at @xmath12 ( cl  0016@xmath1316 , cl   0054@xmath1427 , cl  0412@xmath1465 ) , in this case using _ hst _ photometry .",
    "they found that the dispersion about the relations was quite small even in such distant clusters , thereby requiring a high formation redshift for the stars in early - type galaxies , such as @xmath15 .",
    "e97 also did not detect a significant change in the slopes of the relations in the rest - frame @xmath16 when compared with coma .",
    "the zero - points show modest colour evolution in agreement with earlier studies ( ellis et al .",
    "1985 ; couch et al . 1985 ; aragn - salamanca et al . 1993 ) .",
    "all of these results support a formation picture of early - type galaxies in which the bulk of the star formation is completed at high redshift with little star formation occurring in the recent past .",
    "thus , the _ c - m _ relation originates at high redshift as a metallicity effect .    recently , however , kauffmann & charlot ( 1997 ) have argued that the _ c - m _ relation can alternatively be interpreted in the context of the hierarchical models of galaxy formation once chemical enrichment is taken into account . in their analysis ,",
    "the slope of the _ c - m _ relation is maintained because large ellipticals form primarily from large metal - rich progenitors .",
    "they find that it remains nearly constant up to @xmath17 .",
    "furthermore , they are able to explain the tightness of the _ c - m _ relation , despite frequent galaxy merging , by suggesting that we are biasing ourselves to the selection of only old galaxies by studying rich clusters at high redshift . according to their models ,",
    "these objects are not the progenitors of present - day clusters .",
    "it is not yet clear whether this type of model can give an universal _ c - m _",
    "relation for different clusters , since merging histories are likely to have varied from cluster to cluster .    our motivations to conduct further analyses on the evolution of the _ c - m _",
    "relation for cluster early - type galaxies are twofold : ( 1 )  to investigate the universality of the _ c - m _ relation in clusters and ( 2 )  to put stronger constraints on the formation of early - type galaxies by using the more realistic elliptical galaxy model of ka97 , which takes into account chemical evolution , rather than an ad - hoc single burst model with fixed metallicity ( @xmath18 ) adopted by most of the previous analyses .",
    "ka97 have constructed an evolutionary model of elliptical galaxies which uses a population synthesis technique based on a monolithic collapse picture of galaxy formation .",
    "the marked advantage of the ka97 model is that it allows us to analyze both the slope of the _ c - m _ relation and the zero - point , since it includes the effects of metallicity .",
    "moreover , since the model is calibrated with the empirical colours of ellipticals in coma , it can be directly and reliably compared to the observational data in distant clusters .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the evolution of the _ c - m _ relation of 17 distant clusters using the ka97 evolutionary models .",
    "we have accumulated the photometric data from the literature , most of which were obtained with the _ hst _ and large , ground - based telescopes ( @xmath19@xmath20 m ) .",
    "although some of the _ hst _ data suffer from zero - point uncertainties due to the paucity of observed standard stars ( see below ) , their random photometric errors are very small down to @xmath21mag from the brightest end of the _ c - m _ relation ( typically @xmath22mag ) .",
    "thus , we are able to conduct a reliable analysis of , for example , the slope of the _ c - m _ relation based on the relative photometry within each cluster . to constrain the formation epoch of early - type galaxies in clusters ,",
    "we also conduct a zero - point analysis using only those clusters which have been calibrated with ground - based photometry or those which are at sufficiently high redshift that the evolutionary changes are large enough to put some constraint on the formation epoch , despite relatively large zero - point uncertainties .",
    "the cosmological parameters we have chosen to use throughout this paper are @xmath23km@xmath24s@xmath25mpc@xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) and @xmath28 , without a lambda term , unless otherwise stated .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in ",
    "2 we compile the observational data and define the observed _ c - m _",
    "relation for each cluster . in ",
    "3 we give a brief description of the evolutionary models of ka97 .",
    "we compare the models and the observations in  4 , and in  5 we give a discussion of the results and our conclusions .",

    "the response curves are taken from bessell ( 1990 ) for the johnson @xmath29 and the cousins @xmath30 and @xmath9 bands , and from bessell & brett ( 1988 ) for the @xmath31 band .",
    "the _ hst _",
    "filter response functions for @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 are taken from the space telescope science institute web page .",
    "the photometric zero - points of the hst bands are taken from holtzman ( 1995 ) .    to make a precise comparison with the data , the slope of the _ c - m _ relation at a given redshift is defined in the brightest 3mag range of the model _ c - m _ relation by drawing a straight line between the two model galaxies which have @xmath35 and @xmath36 at @xmath37 , respectively , which is comparable to the definition of the slope for the observational data .",
    "note that the _ c - m _",
    "relation for the metallicity sequence is well represented by a straight line within the redshift range under consideration , and the above definition is quite reasonable .",
    "the zero - point of the model _ c - m _ relation is also defined at the absolute magnitude @xmath38 , just as was done for the observational data .    the full tables of the evolution of the colours of elliptical galaxies in various combinations of age and metallicity and in various photometric systems will be presented in a separate paper in the supplement series ( kodama & arimoto 1997 , in preparation ) . the machine readable version of the tables will also be provided upon request .      since early - type galaxies usually have radial colour gradients ( e.g. vader et al .",
    "1988 ; franx & illingworth 1990 ; peletier et al .  1990a",
    "; peletier , valentijn , & jameson 1990b ; balcells & peletier 1994 ) , their colour indices will depend on the adopted aperture within which the galaxy light is integrated .",
    "barger et al .",
    "( 1996 , 1997 ) used @xmath39arcsec aperture diameters to define their colour indices , which correspond to @xmath40 kpc for @xmath41 and @xmath42 kpc for @xmath43 . on the other hand ,",
    "ble92 used @xmath44arcsec apertures for their coma cluster galaxies , which corresponds to @xmath45kpc . since our model for elliptical galaxies",
    "is calibrated to match the _ c - m _ relation of the coma ellipticals in ble92 , we need to take into account the aperture differences in order to accurately compare the models with the observational data .",
    "we apply the aperture correction to the models instead of to the observational data of each cluster by constructing an aperture corrected _ c - m _ relation of coma and recalibrating the model to match it ( see ka97 for details ) .",
    "we adopt the value @xmath46 given by peletier et al .",
    "( 1990b ) as a typical bright elliptical galaxy colour gradient , where @xmath47 is the effective radius of the galaxy .",
    "gonzlez & gorgas ( 1996 ) recently suggested that elliptical galaxies with stronger central mg@xmath48 indices show steeper line - strength gradients .",
    "if we consider the fact that the central mg@xmath48 strength strongly correlates with the velocity dispersion of the galaxy ( bender , burstein , & faber 1993 ; j@xmath49rgensen , franx , & kj@xmath50rgaard 1996 ) , then smaller ellipticals could have shallower colour gradients",
    ". however , gonzlez & gorgas ( 1996 ) failed to detect significant correlations of the gradients with either absolute magnitude or galaxy mass , thus we have adopted a constant colour gradient for all galaxy models .",
    "we use the @xmath51 @xmath52 relation derived from the kormendy relation of pahre , djorgovski , & carvalho ( 1995 ) to apply aperture corrections to the various galaxy sizes . using the colour gradient and the above relation , as well as the de vaucouleurs ( 1948 ) @xmath53-law for the radial profile of ellipticals",
    ", we can reconstruct the standard _ c - m _ relation at @xmath37 in the @xmath54 @xmath55 diagram for any given aperture using the ble92 _ c - m _ relation for coma .    1.0    the corrected _ c",
    "- m _ relations for coma ellipticals are shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : aperture ] for three different physical aperture diameters , 28 , 36 , and 50kpc .",
    "the first two correspond to 5arcsec at @xmath41 and at @xmath43 , respectively ( @xmath56 ) , while the third represents the relation for the whole galaxy .",
    "c - m _ relation of ble92 is indicated by the solid line .",
    "a bluing in the corrected _ c - m _ relation compared to that of ble92 is observed for bright galaxies ( @xmath57mag ) .",
    "this is because a larger aperture covers more of the physical size of the galaxy , which contains more blue light of presumablly metal - poor stars . on the contrary , fainter galaxies have smaller physical sizes , and hence a 10kpc aperture already covers most of the light of the galaxy and needs little correction . in spite of the bluing of the _ c - m _ relations , the changes in the slope for 28 and 36kpc",
    "apertures are tempered .",
    "this is simply because the brighter galaxies lose more light outside the restricted aperture .",
    "the amount of dimming compared to the total magnitudes @xmath55 in ble92 is larger for brighter galaxies",
    ". thus , the aperture effect on the slopes of the _ c - m _ relation is kept rather small . for any redshift under consideration , the slope typically changes by only 0.01 and 0.02 per mag for the 28kpc and 36kpc apertures compared to the 10kpc aperture , respectively .",
    "the effect on the zero - points of the _ c - m _ relation is negligibly small in any case ( less than 0.05mag ) .",
    "when we compare the model to the photometric data for a given physical aperture , we regard the reconstructed _ c - m _",
    "relation for coma as the new standard relation , and the galaxy models are recalibrated so as to reproduce it at @xmath37 .",
    "the adopted aperture for the correction of the models are 28 kpc for ac  103 , ac  114 , and ac  118 , and 36 kpc for cl   0024 + 16 , and cl  0016 + 16 .",
    "the @xmath58 colours for the three clusters from e97 have the same 10kpc aperture as that of ble92 , and hence no correction is applied . for the rest of the clusters , including those from sed98 ,",
    "3c  324 , and cig  j0848 + 4453 , the 28kpc aperture model is applied , even though the sed98 sample and cig   j0848 + 4453 actually have @xmath59kpc and @xmath60kpc diameter apertures , respectively . here",
    "the apertures for sed98 clusters are provided from s.a .",
    "stanford ( private communication ) .",
    "this small aperture mismatch is negligible both in the slopes and in the zero - points .",
    "note that the sed98 @xmath31 magnitudes are total magnitudes and not magnitudes inside 28kpc , hence we apply a slight correction to the 28kpc aperture model .",
    "since we lack aperture information on the 3c  324 data , we adopt the 28kpc aperture model arbitrarily .",
    "the corrections in the slope and zero - point are likely to be small when compared to the observational uncertainties .",
    "the model predictions for the evolution of the _ c - m _ relation are indicated by solid lines with changing redshift in fig .  [",
    "fig : diagram ] for the 6 clusters for which new _ c - m _ regression lines were determined in this work .",
    "the model is a metallicity sequence with an age of 12  gyr ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "as is evident from the figures , the observed _ c - m _ relations ( dashed lines ) are well defined in clusters up to @xmath62 , and the slopes evolve almost in parallel , in good agreement with the model .",
    "the zero - points of the _ c - m _ relation for some of the clusters in barger et al .",
    "( 1997 ) deviate from the model prediction by as much as 0.2mag .",
    "this probably arises from the zero - point uncertainties of the data .",
    "we discuss the zero - points in  4.2 .",
    "the slopes of the model _ c - m _ relations seem to globally match the observed data very well .",
    "this strongly suggests that there is no differential evolution as a function of galaxy mass and that spheroidal galaxies in clusters form universally at high redshift . a detailed comparison with the models for these and the other clusters are given below .      1.0    the evolution of the slope of the _ c - m _ relation contains critical information on the origin of the _ c - m _ relation itself , i.e. , which is the dominant factor controlling the systematic difference in the photometric properties as a function of galaxy luminosity . the evolution of the slope of the theoretical _ c - m _ relation is compared with the observed data in fig .  [",
    "fig : slope ] .",
    "the solid lines show the standard metallicity sequence model with @xmath63 gyr ( @xmath64 ) , the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagram ] .",
    "almost all of the clusters are consistent with the model prediction of this single metallicity sequence with old age within 1.5@xmath65 errors .",
    "as is already mentioned in ka97 , the metallicity sequence with an old age keeps the slope of the _ c - m _ relation essentially unchanged , although a slight steepening of the slope can be seen .",
    "the dotted lines indicate the no - evolution models estimated by simply redshifting the @xmath37 models .",
    "the no - evolution models also show a slight steepening of the slope and are very close to the prediction of the @xmath64 metallicity sequence .",
    "this indicates that the steepening is simply due to the shift of corresponding wavelength shortwards with redshift . on the contrary ,",
    "the dot - dashed lines correspond to the age sequence model ; i.e. , the ages become younger toward fainter galaxies along the _ c - m _ relation . as is evident ,",
    "the pure age sequence is again absolutely rejected by all the clusters , which strengthens the conclusion of ka97 .",
    "note that only ac  118 could have a somewhat steeper slope than the metallicity sequence model both in @xmath66 and @xmath67 ( at the 1.5@xmath65 and 2@xmath65 levels , respectively ) , although still far away from the age sequence .",
    "the significance of the difference is too small to deserve further speculation .",
    "in fact , sed98 also measured the _",
    "c - m _ slope for this cluster in a shorter wavelength colour ( @xmath68 , where @xmath69 denotes gunn s @xmath70 filter ) and found that it does not have a significantly steeper slope than the no - evolution coma model .    since one of our goals is to constrain the formation epoch from the _ c - m _ slope alone , we consider the younger metallicity sequence models as well . in the centre right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : slope ] , we show three metallicity sequences with younger ages : @xmath71gyr , @xmath72gyr and @xmath73gyr at @xmath37 , corresponding to @xmath74 , 1.7 , and 1.2 , respectively . in the bottom right panel",
    "we also show the @xmath75 model .",
    "the above models have been recalibrated to reproduce the coma _ c - m _ relation at the fixed age by adjusting the mean stellar metallicity along the _ c - m _ relation .",
    "however , a strong constraint on the formation epoch can not be made due to the large uncertainties in the slope , which is defined for only 3mag from the brightest end of the _ c - m _ relation .",
    "even the model with @xmath75 can not be rejected for many clusters . in section 4.2",
    "we show that the analysis of the zero - points is much more effective in providing direct information on the average formation epoch of the galaxies than that of the slopes .    however , the evolution of the _ c - m _ slope provides information on _ relative _ age variations of the early - type galaxies with different luminosities .",
    "thus we can constrain the maximum allowed age difference along the _ c - m _ relation . to do so , we introduce now a model in which age is differentially changed as a function of galaxy luminosity .",
    "the two long - dashed lines in the bottom right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : slope ] represent models which allow an age difference of 1gyr ( @xmath61@xmath76 ) or 2gyr ( @xmath61@xmath77 ) in the 3mag range of the _ c - m _ relation with the brightest galaxies having the oldest age ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "note that the difference is much smaller than for the age sequence , which requires a @xmath78gyr difference . despite the large uncertainties in the measured slopes",
    ", the four most distant clusters can clearly reject a 2gyr age difference , since the expected slopes at high redshift would be far too steep .",
    "if our models are correct , the age difference is unlikely to be more than 1gyr , and could be much smaller .",
    "our analysis of the evolution of the _ c - m _ slope indicates that there is little differential evolution in early - type galaxies as a function of galaxy luminosity , which strongly suggests that the bulk of the stars in early - type galaxies in rich cluster environments are coeval and form at a redshift well beyond unity .",
    "moreover , we find little difference between the _ c - m _ slopes of different clusters , most of which are consistent with a universal metallicity sequence with old age .",
    "this argues for a universal mechanism responsible for the _ c - m _ relation of the early - type galaxies in these clusters .",
    "their photometric properties may be described primarily by only one parameter : the mean stellar metallicity controlled by their mass .",

    "the differences along the _ c - m _ sequence are governed by the mean stellar metallicity .",
    "most of the early - type galaxies in rich clusters form very quickly and effectively in the deep potential well of the clusters at significantly high redshift , and galactic wind feedback probably plays a key role in producing the _ c - m _ relation . since",

    "relation for different clusters locally and over a wide range of redshift , since merging histories are likely to have varied from cluster to cluster .",
    "moreover it is not yet confirmed that larger ellipticals form always from larger spirals already enriched in metal . in any case , however , if we define the formation epoch of the early - type galaxies as the time when the bulk of their stars formed , the properties of the _ c - m _ relation place that epoch well beyond @xmath101 , independent of which formation picture is correct .",

    "<S> we present a thorough quantitative analysis of the evolution of the colour - magnitude relation for early - type galaxies in 17 distant clusters with redshifts @xmath0 using the kodama & arimoto ( 1997 ) evolutionary model for elliptical galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the model is calibrated to reproduce the colour - magnitude relation for coma ellipticals at @xmath1 and gives the evolution of the slope and zero - point as a function of redshift . </S>",
    "<S> we find no significant differences between the colour - magnitude relations of the clusters in our sample . </S>",
    "<S> the slopes can be reproduced by a single model sequence in which all elliptical galaxies are assumed to be equally old ( the maximum age difference allowed for the brightest 3 magnitudes is only 1  gyr ) and to have mean stellar metallicities which vary as a function of galaxy luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> the zero - points of the colour - magnitude relations constrain the epoch of major star formation in early - type galaxies to @xmath2@xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> this study provides two important constraints for any model of the formation of rich clusters : the uniformity of the ages of the stellar populations in the early - type galaxies and the universality of the metallicity sequence of these galaxies as a function of galaxy mass .    </S>",
