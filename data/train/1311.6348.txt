    "the simplest of these models has potentials @xmath1 with a strictly positive lower bound , which is a straightforward generalisation of the positive cosmological constant @xcite and mimics it at late times . in that case , the bianchi models of types i - viii were studied in detail by rendall @xcite and their nonlinear stability by ringstrm in @xcite . in subsequent works ,",
    "rendall considered potentials with zero lower bound when @xmath0 is either infinite @xcite or finite @xcite . for the former class of solutions , it was shown that if @xmath2 satisfies an upper bound which rules out too rapid exponential decay , accelerated expansion is expected to exist indefinitely and has a dynamical behaviour between the power - law @xcite and exponential types , commonly termed as intermediate inflation @xcite .",
    "later , in @xcite , rendall considered potentials which are positive and tend to zero , but which do not experience accelerated expansion indefinitely , as the klein - gordon field .",
    "these potentials are very useful for studying the early inflationary stage of the universe in models of chaotic inflation ( see @xcite ) , since they allow the physical process of reheating @xcite .",

    "in @xcite , rendall revisited some results of @xcite by giving a rigorous asymptotic analysis of the inflationary dynamics using center manifold theory .",
    "a procedure which has proved to be very useful when using techniques from dynamical systems theory applied to cosmology is the reduction of the original system of equations , by using _",

    "the bianchi type models i - viii were studied in detail and previous results in the literature @xcite were treated in an unified way , in particular , it was possible to test whether a given model inflates and/or isotropizes at late times and thus test the validity of the cosmic no - hair conjecture in those settings .",
    "more precisely , it was shown that the flat isotropic power - law inflationary solution is an attractor for all ever expanding bianchi models with an exponential potential @xcite .",
    "the flat friedman - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) model with exponential potential coupled to matter was studied in @xcite , whereas the case of several independent exponential potentials was considered in @xcite . for more details",

    "contrary to the exponential potential situation , in this case the odes system does not decouple from the raychaudhuri equation and it is necessary to introduce new expansion - normalized variables . by treating this new variable as a potential parameter , they found an analytical approximation for the inflationary dynamics , which for small values of the parameter , works as a first order correction to the usual slow - roll approximation .",
