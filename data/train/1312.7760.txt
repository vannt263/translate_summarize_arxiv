    "gravitational interaction of relativistic extended objects has some unusual features .",
    "it is an essentially relativistic problem even if their relative velocity is small , since the brane tension , causing gravitational repulsion , contributes to interaction on equal footing with the energy density .",
    "the net effect of gravitational interaction of two branes therefore varies with dimensionality of the world - volumes and codimension of their embedding into space - time .",
    "it is repulsive for codimension one ( domain walls ) , locally vanishes for codimension two ( strings ) and attractive in other cases .",
    "another new feature due to the extended nature of branes is possibility of their free oscillations which may accompany the generic collision process .",
    "while two point particles under collision just change their momenta , but remain in the same intrinsic state , the branes will get excited and will not remain in the initial state even asymptotically .",
    "physically , the most interesting case is interaction of domain walls with particles in four dimensions .",
    "this was investigated long ago in connection with topological defects in cosmology .",
    "the solution of linearized einstein equations for gravitational field of thin planar domain wall was found by vilenkin @xcite .",
    "gravity of domain walls is repulsive , so a particle impinging on the wall may be reflected at some finite distance , transferring the momentum to the wall .",
    "this gives rise to the friction force acting upon the wall moving in cosmic plasma @xcite .",
    "here we will be interested in more subtle effect of excitation of the wall during the collision , especially in the situation when the particle energy is enough to reach the wall and to pierce it .",
    "fortunately , such piercing collision may be treated analytically with the linearized gravity theory .",
    "in fact , one important feature associated with codimension of embedding of an extended object into the bulk is the degree of singularity of the linearized gravitational field at its location .",
    "gravitational field diverges as a negative power of the distance for codimension greater than two , it diverges logarithmically for codimension two , but it remains finite in the case of the domain wall .",
    "therefore , though generically gravitational collision of two infinitely thin branes is a singular problem , the collision particle  domain wall turns out to be tractable within the linearized gravity .",
    "since gravity of the domain wall remains finite when the particle pierces it , the energy - momentum is not exchanged at perforation , so such particles will not contribute to the friction force .",
    "we will see , however , that the wall does not remain insensitive to piercing by a point particle , but gets excited .",
    "the excitation has a from of the spherical branon wave arising at the moment of perforation and propagating outwards with the velocity of light .",
    "this effect was found in five dimensions in the randall - sundrum ( rs ) type of setting @xcite and here it will be shown to exist in arbitrary space - time dimensions , including the case of domain walls in the four - dimensional cosmology .",
    "our treatment of perforation is essentially local , so in order to establish its validity region we should invoke some results obtained in the full non - linear theory .",
    "it is well - known that the linear approximation for gravity of the domain wall breaks down at large distances .",
    "it is also known @xcite that no static solution of full non - linear einstein equations exists which could fit to the linearized solution of @xcite , the consistent non - linear ansatz being time - dependent . in particular ,",
    "an exact solution found by vilenkin @xcite turns out to be a segment of an accelerated spherical domain wall @xcite which comes in from infinity , turns around , and heads back out to infinity .",
    "subsequently , linet have shown that the static solution still does exist @xcite , but at the expense of introducing a cosmological constant in the bulk .",
    "more recently domain walls attracted much attention in the brane - world scenarios @xcite and especially in the randall - sundrum models @xcite .",
    "in fact , the model with one brane is based on the exact static solution of einstein equations with negative cosmological constant .",
    "as it could be expected , this solution reduces to static solution of five - dimensional linearized einstein equations in the vicinity of the brane ( after a suitable coordinate transformation @xcite ) , while corrections due to the cosmological constant enter only in the second post - linear order .",
    "the static domain wall solutions ( thick walls ) exist also is field - theoretical models with scalar fields whose vacuum manifold contains disconnected components , in particular , supergravities / effective string theories @xcite .    apart from calculation of the friction force , gravitational interaction of domain walls and more general @xmath0branes with massive bodies was studied previously in other physical contexts .",
    "some important applications were related to black holes in the brane - world scenarios ( for a recent review and further references see @xcite ) . in the rundall - sundrum @xcite setup",
    "the particles which are allowed to live in the bulk are expelled from the brane ( domain wall ) and move along the geodesics into the ads bulk @xcite . their gravity and",
    "the corresponding perturbation of the induced metric on the brane was studied in @xcite .",
    "black holes , which in such scenarios can be created in high energy particle collisions , also may escape from the brane into the bulk @xcite .",
    "the brane  black - hole system , including the process of the merging , was investigated in detail using the model of a test brane in the black hole background @xcite .",
    "perforation of domain walls by black holes was qualitatively studied within the field - theoretical model of hybrid defects ( axion ) @xcite suggesting this mechanism as relevant to the cosmological domain wall problem .",
    "numerical studies of interaction of black holes with field - theoretical domain walls are also available @xcite .",
    "our approach in this paper is much simpler and it can be considered complementary to the above studies .",
    "we treat both the domain wall and the bulk particle as test bodies propagating in @xmath1dimensional minkowski space - time and interacting via linearized gravity .",
    "such a setting seems adequate to give a local description of the process of perforation with possibility to treat the domain wall dynamically .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 we derive the brane metric in the linearized gravity , consider its relation to some exact solutions and explore interaction of static branes of different dimensionality dependent on their codimension . in sec .",
    "3 we consider motion of a point particle in the gravitational field of the domain wall . the next sec . 4 is devoted to general description of the deformation of the domain wall under gravitational collision and the derivation of the branon wave equation with a source . in sec .",
    "5 we construct the retarded solution for the branon wave equation with the source generated by gravity of the perforating particle in even and odd dimensions @xmath2 .",
    "the sec . 6",
    "is devoted to the limiting case of the light - light perforation . then in sec .",
    "7 we consider the case of the domain wall in the four - dimensional bulk which requires special treatment , and in the last sec .",
    "8 we discuss some tentative applications . in the appendix",
    "the evaluation of typical integrals involved in the calculations is presented .",
    "for more generality we start with considering an arbitrary @xmath4-brane propagating in @xmath1dimensional curved space - time ( the bulk ) .",
    "we denote the bulk metric as @xmath5 , and define the brane world - volume @xmath6 by the embedding equations @xmath7 parameterized by arbitrary coordinates @xmath8 on @xmath6 .",
    "the corresponding action in the polyakov form is a functional of @xmath9 and the metric @xmath10 on @xmath6 : @xmath11\\sqrt{|\\gamma|}\\,d^{p+1 }    \\sigma    \\ , .",

    "also , @xmath16 , the metric signature is @xmath17 and our convention for the riemann tensor is @xmath18 .",
    "variation of ( [ bac ] ) with respect to @xmath19 gives the brane equation of motion @xmath20 which is covariant with respect to both the space - time and the world - volume diffeomorphisms .",
    "variation over @xmath14 gives the constraint equation @xmath21 whose solution defines @xmath10 as the induced metric on @xmath6 : @xmath22 adding to ( [ bac ] ) the einstein action with the cosmological constant @xmath23 and varying @xmath24 with respect to the space - time metric @xmath25 we obtain einstein equations @xmath26 with the source term @xmath27    we will be interested in static solutions of the system ( [ em ] , [ con ] , [ eeq ] ) for planar branes described by the linear embedding functions @xmath28 with constant @xmath29 . in what follows",
    "we will mostly use the coordinates @xmath30 coinciding with @xmath31 , such that @xmath32 , but in some cases @xmath30 will be also invoked to avoid confusion .",
    "consistency of the above coupled system involving singular delta sources depends on codimension @xmath33 of the embedding of the brane world - volume into the bulk . strictly speaking , for @xmath34",
    "the use of distributions in the full non - linear gravity is not legitimate , though the presence of delta - sources in classical @xmath4-brane solutions in supergravities sometimes still can be detected @xcite . the case @xmath35 and @xmath36 , as it is well - known from an example of the cosmic string in four - dimensional space - time @xcite , is exceptional : in this case the cylindrically symmetric field configurations exist for which einstein equations reduce to two - dimensional laplace equation with the delta - source leading to static locally flat conical transverse space .",
    "the case @xmath37 ( domain wall ) is legitimate too , but has a peculiar feature : for @xmath36 exact solutions of einstein equations are non - static @xcite .",
    "however , static solutions in this case do exist for some special value of the cosmological constant @xmath38 , the notorious example being the randall - sundrum metric in @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "indeed , with an ansatz @xmath40 the einstein equations reduce to : @xmath41 where a prime denotes the differentiation over @xmath42 .",
    "this system has an exact solution provided @xmath43 imposing the additional @xmath44-symmetry @xmath45 , one obtains @xmath46 where @xmath47 so an exact solution of einstein equations with the cosmological constant ( [ eeq ] ) reads : @xmath48    for comparison , we also give here the time - dependent solution found by vilenkin @xcite and ipser and sikivie @xcite in four dimensions which exists in absence of the cosmological constant : @xmath49 here @xmath50 is a free parameter .",
    "now we pass to linearized gravity in minkowski space - time assuming @xmath36 and expanding the metric as @xmath51 all subsequent operations with indices of @xmath52 will be performed with respect to the minkowski metric , e.g. , @xmath53 . in the lorentz gauge",
    "@xmath54 the linearized einstein equations reduce to @xmath55 with @xmath56 .",

    "@xmath71 the metric ( [ brgr1 ] ) reads @xmath72 this solution generalizes to arbitrary @xmath3 the vilenkin solution @xcite of the four - dimensional vacuum linearized gravity , and , similarly , it can not be regarded as linearization of any static metric satisfying @xmath3-dimensional vacuum einstein equations",
    ". however it can be viewed as linearization of the randall - sundrum type exact solution ( [ mrs ] ) of the einstein equations with the negative cosmological constant ( [ lamka ] ) .",
    "indeed , the linearization of ( [ mrs ] ) for small @xmath73 reads @xmath74 it looks different from our solution ( [ dwgr1 ] ) , but in fact ( [ mrs1 ] ) does not satisfy the lorentz gauge condition ( [ lorg ] ) contrary to ( [ dwgr1 ] ) .",
    "therefore , within the validity of the linear approximation , the solutions ( [ mrs1 ] ) and ( [ brgr1 ] ) must be related by some coordinate transformation .",
    "it is easy to check that @xmath75 does this job in the linear order in @xmath76 .",
    "note that the right hand side of this equation is continuous at @xmath77 , so in the vicinity of this point @xmath78 .",
    "therefore , the linearized domain wall can be viewed as the small distances limit @xmath79 of the exact solution ( [ mrs ] ) .",
    "note in passing that the required cosmological constant @xmath80 in ( [ eeq ] ) is quadratic in @xmath50 , so it can be neglected in the linear order in @xmath50 .",
    "it is instructive to explore linearized gravitational interaction between two plane parallel branes @xmath4 and @xmath81 , sitting at some finite distance .",
    "we split the space - time coordinates as @xmath82 where @xmath83 @xmath84 @xmath85 let the first @xmath4-brane occupy the sector @xmath86 and located at @xmath87 in the overall transverse space , while the second extends in the sector @xmath88 at the position @xmath89 . to extract the effective interaction potential we start with the action @xmath90 where @xmath52 is the linearized metric of the @xmath4-brane and @xmath91 is the stress - tensor of the @xmath92 brane ( or vice - versa ) and insert as @xmath52 the solution of the corresponding dalembert equation . using the scalar green s function of the dalembert equation @xmath93 we obtain the bilinear form of the stress - energy tensors @xmath94 substituting here the corresponding quantities for both branes at rest ,",
    "we find that the integral ( [ lm4 ] ) reduces to that over time and the spatial coordinates @xmath95 of the @xmath92-brane , allowing for introduction of the effective potential @xmath96 per unit volume of the smaller brane : @xmath97 which explicitly reads @xmath98 inserting here the transverse potential ( [ lm11 ] ) we finally obtain @xmath99    thus , the character of interaction depends on codimension of the embedding of the bigger @xmath4-brane into the bulk : the potential is repulsive for @xmath71 , there is no force for @xmath100 and it is attractive for @xmath101 .",
    "this simple picture , however , holds only in the static case .",
    "as we will see , situation becomes more sophisticated when branes are in motion .",
    "now we wish to consider the system of the gravitationally interacting domain wall and a moving point particle ( @xmath63 brane ) . this can be done adding to the sum @xmath24 the particle action @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the ein - bein of the particle world - line and dots denote derivatives with respect to @xmath104 .",
    "varying @xmath105 with respect to @xmath106 and @xmath103 one obtains the geodesic equation in arbitrary parametrization @xmath107 and the constraint equation @xmath108 the corresponding energy - momentum tensor reads @xmath109    both the domain wall and the point particle will be treated on an equal footing in the framework of the linearized gravity on minkowski background .",
    "so we expand the total metric similarly to ( [ meka ] ) adding to the metric perturbation @xmath52 , which will be still associated with the brane , the metric perturbation @xmath110 due to the particle ( preserving the notation of sec .",
    "2d ) : @xmath111 the lorentz gauge condition ( [ lorg ] ) will be assumed for both components independently .    to treat the interaction problem in terms of formal expansions in the gravitational coupling we have now to expand the embedding functions @xmath112 and @xmath106 as well as the lagrange multipliers @xmath10 and @xmath103 in powers of @xmath113 to the first order , which amounts to replacing these quantities by @xmath114 , @xmath115,@xmath116 and @xmath117 . here",
    "@xmath118 will now correspond to free motion in minkowski space - time , while @xmath119 are the perturbations of the brane variables due to the gravitational field of the particle @xmath110 , and @xmath120 are the perturbations of the particle variables due to the gravitational field of the brane @xmath121 ( and we omit singular self - interaction terms ) .",

    "( [ consp ] ) and ( [ eomp ] ) one obtains for @xmath128 and @xmath129 the system of equations @xmath130 and @xmath131 which upon the elimination of @xmath128 gives for @xmath132 : @xmath133 where @xmath134 is a projector onto the subspace orthogonal to @xmath135 .",
    "let us now choose the overall gauge condition @xmath136 with @xmath137 including the perturbation .",
    "in view of the zero order parametrization assumed ( [ zzero ] ) , this amounts to the condition @xmath138 , i.e. , @xmath139 going back to eq .",
    "( [ cucu0 ] ) one has thereby @xmath140 or , in components , @xmath141 so , the force is repulsive as expected .    integrating ( [ acce1 ] ) twice with initial conditions @xmath142 , one has @xmath143 substituting ( [ acce2 ] ) into ( [ e1eq ] ) one can check that the gauge condition ( [ pgage ] ) holds .",
    "since we are using the perturbation theory , corrections to the uniform particle motion must be small ( assuming appropriate initial conditions ) , so the particle always hits the brane and perforates it , reappearing on the other side .",
    "the reflection is of course physically possible , if the velocity is not high enough , but this is beyond the validity of our approximation .",
    "our aim is to consider in detail what happens when the particle pierces the brane , so the case of reflection is outside the scope of the present treatment .",
    "according to ( [ acce2 ] ) , the perturbation of the particle energy @xmath144 and the momentum @xmath145 have no discontinuity at the location of the brane @xmath77 , but their derivative have .",
    "the point - like particle therefore perforates the domain wall without loss of the energy - momentum , but its acceleration is finite and instantaneously changes sign . the sign rule in ( [ acce1 ] ) corresponds to gravitational repulsion , as could be expected in the case of co - dimension one .",
    "therefore the discontinuity of acceleration has a simple physical meaning : the repulsive force changes its sign at the moment of perforation .    for consistency of our perturbative approach",
    "we have to ensure that the first order correction to the particle momentum remains small in the vicinity of the wall @xmath79 where the linearized approximation for wall s gravity is valid . since in the zero order @xmath146 , from ( [ acce2 ] ) we find that this is true indeed : @xmath147",
    "now we explore perturbations of the domain wall due to gravitational interaction with the perforating particle . for this",
    "we need to know the metric perturbation due to the particle . in accordance with the iterative approach adopted here",
    ", we must neglect the particle acceleration in the wall s gravity when we calculate its proper gravitational field , considering the unperturbed particle trajectory .      in what follows",
    ", the stress - tensor and the gravitational field of the particle will be denoted by bar .",
    "the metric perturbation moving along the straight line in the minkowski space satisfies the equation @xmath148 with the source term @xmath149 which has only @xmath150 components non - zero . passing to the @xmath3-dimensional fourier - transforms @xmath151 we obtain from ( [ barheq ] ) the retarded solution in the momentum representation @xmath152 in the coordinate representation we find ( for @xmath153 ) : @xmath154^{{\\frac}{d-3}{2}}}\\ , ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath155 is the radial distance on the wall from the perforation point .",
    "this is just the lorentz - contracted @xmath3-dimensional newton field of the uniformly moving particle .",
    "perturbations of the nambu - goto branes in external gravitational field were expensively studied in the literature , see e.g. @xcite . on the minkowski background",
    "the derivation is particularly simple .",
    "first , from eq .",
    "( [ ceq ] ) we find the perturbation of the induced metric @xmath156 where brackets denote symmetrization over indices with the factor @xmath157 . then linearizing the rest of the eq .",
    "( [ em ] ) , after some rearrangements one obtains the following equation for deformation of the wall : @xmath158 where @xmath159 and @xmath160 is the projector onto the ( one - dimensional ) subspace orthogonal to @xmath161 .",
    "the source term in ( [ pisk ] ) reads : @xmath162 using the aligned coordinates on the brane @xmath163 we will have @xmath164 , so the projector @xmath165 reduces the system ( [ pisk ] ) to a single equation for @xmath166 component .",
    "thus only the @xmath167-components of @xmath168 and @xmath169 are physical .",
    "generically , the transverse coordinates of the branes can be viewed as nambu - goldstone bosons ( branons ) which appear as a result of spontaneous breaking of the translational symmetry @xcite .",
    "these are coupled to gravity and matter on the brane in the brane - world models via the induced metric ( for a recent discussion see @xcite ) . in our case of co -",
    "dimension one there is only one such branon .",
    "the remaining components of the perturbation @xmath168 can be removed by suitable transformation of the coordinates on the world - volume , so @xmath170 is nothing but the choice of gauge . note that in this gauge the perturbation of the induced metric @xmath171 does not vanish , as it was for the perturbation of the particle ein - bein @xmath172 .    denoting the physical component as @xmath173",
    "we obtain the branon @xmath174-dimensional wave equation : @xmath175 with the source term @xmath176 . substituting ( [ hpart ] ) into the eq.([jn ] ) we obtain the source term for the branon : @xmath177_{z=0 } = -   { \\frac}{{\\lambda}vt}{[\\gamma^2 v^2 t^2+r^2]^{\\frac}{d-1}{2}}\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where@xmath178      the source - current has some peculiar features .",
    "it is a smooth function of @xmath179 except for the point @xmath180 where it has singularity at the moment @xmath127 of perforation .",
    "this singularity is due to singular nature of the coulomb field of the point - like particle .",
    "of course the linearized gravity theory can not be trusted as description of the gravitational field near the singularity . nevertheless , we know that the fierz - pauli theory _ can _ be used to consistently describe gravitational interaction of point masses treated in terms of distributions . since the above singularity is essentially due to the point - like nature of the particle stress - tensor , one can hope to be able to describe the whole situation in terms of distributions too .    consider the branon wave equation with the source treated as distribution .",
    "it is easy to see , that in the limit @xmath181 or @xmath182 ( @xmath183 ) , the source exhibits properties of the @xmath184-dimensional delta - function . denoting @xmath185 ,",
    "one has : @xmath186 the integral of @xmath187 over the @xmath188-dimensional space is @xmath189-independent ( up to the sign ) and finite : @xmath190 so the integrand is proportional to the @xmath191-dimensional delta - function . since @xmath192",
    ", we get therefore : @xmath193 it is worth noting that this limiting distribution will be the same either we consider _ time _ in the close vicinity of the perforation moment @xmath181 for any velocity @xmath194 of the mass @xmath195 , or if we consider the limit of the _ small velocity _ @xmath196 . in the latter case ( the quasi - static perforation )",
    "this limit holds for sufficiently large @xmath197 , and since the coefficient @xmath198 remains finite as @xmath196 , the point - like source at the right hand side of the branon field equation ( [ ngeq ] ) may be attributed to an effective branon `` charge '' , or the perforation charge .",
    "this notion allows us to better understand the difference between two cases .",
    "the first is the static point mass sitting on the brane eternally .",
    "then , coming back to the eq .",
    "( [ pisk ] ) for brane perturbations , we find that the source term at the right hand side will be zero ( i.e. there is no perforation charge in absence of perforation ) . on the contrary , if the perforation takes place even adiabatically slowly , the branon charge is non - zero . indeed ,",
    "in the limit @xmath196 we will have a point - like source of the branon field : @xmath199 where an effective branon charge is given by @xmath200 this `` charge '' is a manifestly non - conserved quantity , changing sign at the moment of perforation . for an observer on the brane",
    "the perforation therefore looks like a sudden shake , and , as we will see in the next section , the corresponding branon field will be not a static coulomb field , but an expanding wave .",
    "in view of causality , it is reasonable to construct the retarded solution of the branon wave equation ( [ ngeq ] ) generated by the source .",
    "this can be done using the standard retarded green s function on a @xmath174-dimensional flat manifold : @xmath201 satisfying @xmath202 parameterizing the @xmath174-dimensional wave - vector as @xmath203 and denoting @xmath204 ( not to be confused with @xmath50 in the domain wall metric ) we present the retarded solution of ( [ ngeq ] ) as @xmath205 where @xmath206 is the fourier - transform of the source , the eq.([jk ] ) . ] ( [ jxb ] ) : @xmath207    integration in ( [ fig ] ) is straightforward , but it is worth giving here some details in order to show the origin of two physically different components of the solution . substituting ( [ jka ] ) into ( [ fig ] ) we pass to spherical coordinates in the spatial sector of the momentum space @xmath208 . using @xmath209 , we integrate over the angles : @xmath210 ( derivation is given in ( [ totangint ] ) ) , and split the integrand into the sum of three terms : @xmath211 note that the first two terms in the bracket correspond to solution of the homogeneous equation , while the last is related to the source .",
    "all the three integrals over @xmath212 can be evaluated by the contour integration : @xmath213 where @xmath214 is the heaviside function and @xmath215 is the sign function .",

    "one could think that the particle approaching the wall will continuously deform it outward through the gravitational repulsion .",
