    "ever since the path - breaking prediction by casimir @xcite that a quantized field in its vacuum state will exert a force on nearby conducting plates , and its confirmation in the laboratory @xcite , the fundamental importance of the vacuum has been clear .",
    "the electromagnetic vacuum also manifests itself through other observable effects such as the lamb shift @xcite , the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron @xcite , and the anomaly - driven two - photon decay of the pion @xcite .",
    "the predicted magnitudes of these effects are obtained through renormalization of fields and coupling constants , which absorb the infinities in a covariant manner .",
    "renormalization methods have long been extended to quantized fields propagating in the curved spacetime of general relativity @xcite ( see also @xcite and references therein ) , but predicted quantum vacuum effects of curved spacetime have been too small to be directly observed .",
    "quantum vacuum effects in curved spacetimes have also been explored in connection with particle creation by the expansion of the universe and by black holes @xcite . in addition",
    ", vacuum effects of self - interacting scalar fields have been invoked to produce inflation of the very early universe @xcite .    as is well - known ,",
    "observations of an accelerating expansion of the recent universe @xcite , together with other observations , such as those of small - angular - scale fluctuations of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) , imply the existence of a dark form of energy @xcite .",
    "the present authors have argued that the recent acceleration of the universe is the first directly observable manifestation of quantum vacuum effects produced by the curved spacetime of general relativistic cosmology , and have presented a cosmological model , based on general relativity and quantum field theory , that fits the current data @xcite .",
    "these quantum vacuum effects involve an ultralow - mass particle and are nonperturbative in the curvature .",
    "they do not become significant until a transition that occurs at about half the present age of the universe ( i.e. , at a redshift @xmath1 . )    in the present paper , we explore new features of our model , and their possible cosmological significance . in particular , we calculate the creation rate of these ultralight particles resulting from the effect of the spacetime curvature on the vacuum .",
    "the analytic result for the particle production rate during the vacuum - dominated stage predicted by our model reduces to that obtained in the massless limit by other methods , and extends the result to the massive case .",
    "this agreement adds confidence to the validity of our effective action and its other predictions , such as that of a recent acceleration of the expansion of the universe .",
    "_ the predicted acceleration and the particle production arise from the real and imaginary parts , respectively , of the same term in the effective action .",
    "_    we then find the effective temperature of the particles created during the vacuum - dominated stage .",
    "this effective temperature at the present time would be very small ( only about @xmath2 k ) , and is not expected to alter the vacuum - dominated behavior . it should be kept in mind that the remnant of these particles left over from the very early universe would have a much higher temperature today , probably of the order of 1 k.    the mass of the ultralight scalar particle in our model is typical of masses expected for pseudo nambu - goldstone bosons ( pngb ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite the pngb mass scale arises from the ratio of @xmath3 to @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ev is a neutrino mass and @xmath6 gev is a global symmetry - breaking scale ) , quantities that are _ a priori _ independent of the present expansion rate of the universe .",
    "if the mass comes from a pngb mechanism , then this may introduce additional interaction terms into our free - field model . also , it is known that in a frw universe , the graviton field equation can be expressed in the form of two scalar field equations .",
    "if the graviton has an ultralow mass , then we expect that it would lead to the same cosmological consequences as the scalar particle discussed here .",
    "furthermore , such a low graviton mass appears to be consistent with gravitational experiments and observations .",
    "the expansion rate being related to the ultralow mass is not a coincidence in our model , because after the transition , such a relation between the mass of the particle and the expansion rate remains true for a time of the order of the present age of the universe .",
    "in addition , the vacuum energy density remains within an order of magnitude of the matter density for a time of the order of the present age of the universe .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii , we briefly summarize our model and the cosmological solution that arises from it . in section iii ,",
    "we discuss the particle production rate found from the imaginary part of the effective action . in section iv , we discuss the fine - tuning problem in our model and in a model with cosmological constant plus non - relativistic matter ( referred to here as the @xmath7-model ) . in section v , we derive the equation of state of the vacuum in our model . in section",
    "vi , we calculate the ratio of total ( i.e. , matter plus vacuum contributions ) pressure and total energy density for our model and compare it to that for a @xmath7-model .",
    "this ratio as function of redshift is useful for future comparison to observations . in section vii",
    ", we discuss nonperturbative quantum vacuum effects of this ultralow - mass field in the early universe , and show that the standard cosmological model is not significantly altered for times less than about half the present age of the universe .",
    "finally , in section viii , we state our conclusions .",
    "we start with a brief summary of our non - perturbative vacuum energy model and our previous results @xcite . consider a free , massive quantized scalar field of inverse compton wavelength @xmath8 , and curvature coupling @xmath9 .",
    "the effective action for gravity coupled to such a field is obtained by integrating out the vacuum fluctuations of the field @xcite and renormalized as in ref .",
    "this effective action is the simplest one that gives the standard trace anomaly in the massless - conformally - coupled limit , and contains the nonperturbative sum ( in arbitrary dimensions ) of _ all _ terms in the propagator having at least one factor of the scalar curvature , @xmath10 .",
    "it is given by @xcite [ effact1 ] w & = & d^4 x _ o r + d^4 x + & & + d^4 x ( m^4 + 2_2 ) ( -m^2 ) , where @xmath11 ( @xmath12 is newton s constant ) , @xmath13 , and m^2 & & m^2 + r + _ 2 & & ( 1/6)(1/5 -)r + ( 1/180)(r_r^ - r_r^ ) + f_2 & & _ 2 + ( 1/2)^2 r^2 . the renormalized cosmological constant has been set to zero in deriving the above effective action . the last term in the above equation constitutes the imaginary part of the effective action , implying particle production .",
    "we will discuss the magnitude of the imaginary part in the next section .",
    "for now , we focus on the real part of the effective action .",
    "the trace of the einstein equations , obtained by variation of the real part of the effective action with respect to the metric tensor takes the following form in a friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) spacetime ( in units such that @xmath14 ) : [ one ] r + & = & \\ { ( m^2 + r ) 1+r m^-2 .",

( [ one ] ) becomes large as @xmath17 .",
    "this resonance can occur even at low curvatures if @xmath18 is sufficiently small , and is not displayed by a perturbative treatment of @xmath10 ; as can be seen by expanding eq .",
    "( [ one ] ) in powers of @xmath19 and keeping a finite number of terms .    as noted earlier , @xmath8 is the inverse compton wavelength of the field .",
    "it is related to the actual mass of the field by @xmath20 .",
    "equation ( [ one ] ) above is nonperturbative in @xmath10 because it contains terms that involve an infinite sum of powers of @xmath10 .",
    "however , for a sufficiently low mass , it is possible to treat @xmath21 ( where @xmath22 is the planck mass ) as a small parameter and expand perturbatively in this parameter .    for a sufficiently low mass , in an expanding frw universe",
    "the quantum contributions to the einstein equations become significant at a time @xmath0 , when the density of classical matter , @xmath23 , has decreased to a value given by [ rhcond ] _",
    "m(t_j ) = 2_0 ^2 , where ^2 m^2/(- ) .",
    "the time @xmath0 occurs in the matter - dominated stage of the evolution .",
    "furthermore for @xmath24 , the scalar curvature , @xmath10 , remains constant to excellent approximation near the value @xmath25 . for @xmath26 ,",
    "the quantum contributions to the einstein equations are negligible and the scale factor is that of a matter - dominated frw universe . then , equation ( [ rhcond ] ) implies that , in a spatially flat universe with line element @xmath27 , one has t_j = ( 2/)^-1 ,  h(t_j ) = / , where @xmath28 is the hubble constant at @xmath0 .    the condition of the constancy of the scalar curvature after @xmath0 leads to a solution for the scale factor that can be joined , with continuous first and second derivatives ( i.e. , in a @xmath29 manner ) , to the matter - dominated solution for @xmath30 .",

    "we would like to point out here that the above solution also satisfies , up to terms of order @xmath31 , the one remaining independent einstein equation in a frw universe , which can be taken to be @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the einstein tensor and @xmath34 is the energy - momentum tensor , including classical and quantum contributions .",

    ", one finds that equation ( [ scfactor ] ) satisfies equation ( [ zzcomp ] ) up to terms of order @xmath31 .",

    "in this section , we consider the rate of particle production in the cosmological solution discussed above .",
    "we find that the effective action from which our cosmological solution is derived leads to a particle production rate that is consistent with that obtained using other methods , and generalizes the other methods to the case of production of massive particles .",
    "we also discuss the effective temperature of these particles .",
    "the constant-@xmath10 solution after the transition at time @xmath0 was obtained from a consideration of the einstein equations based on variation of the real part of the effective action .",
    "the imaginary part of the effective action is related to the probability of the production of at least one pair of particles @xcite , following schwinger @xcite .",

    "( 1 ) , we obtain [ imw ] = ( 64)^-1d^4x(m^4 + 2)(-m^2 ) . when @xmath48 and @xmath49 , the above formula reduces to that derived in refs . @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the derivation of the particle production rate in @xcite is based on the non - local effective action derived in @xcite , which contains , in the @xmath50 limit , terms of the form @xmath51 .",
    "similar terms were discussed in @xcite .",
    "it is noteworthy that the nonperturbative scalar curvature sum used here gives the same imaginary part , in the limiting case of zero mass , as the nonlocal effective action .",
    "the reason for the similar results in the two cases was suggested in @xcite , based on renormalization group arguments @xcite .",
    "however , these renormalization group arguments are generally reliable only in the large-@xmath10 limit .",
    "the partially summed form of the effective action that we use here is also valid at small values of @xmath10 , as in the present universe .    for @xmath52 , eq .",
    "( [ imw ] ) agrees , to leading order , with the particle production rate derived in @xcite .",
    "since the imaginary and real parts of the effective action arise out of the same term , the agreement of the imaginary part with that found in the literature using other methods gives a further justification of our approximation .",
    "for our cosmological solution , @xmath48 for all time , therefore the step function in the above equation is equal to 1 .",
    "the term @xmath53 can be expressed as = 16(15 -)r + 1120c_c^ - 1360 g , where @xmath54 is the weyl tensor , and @xmath12 is the gauss - bonnet invariant g = r_r^ - 4r_r^ + r^2 . in conformally flat spacetimes , such as the one under consideration , the weyl tensor vanishes .",

    "since these boundary contributions would vanish if the metric were static at the boundaries , one expects that the @xmath55 term in the imaginary part of the effective action does not correspond to real particle production @xcite .",

    "the fact that the one can associate a temperature with the created particles does not mean that the vacuum possesses thermodynamic entropy .",
    "indeed , from the equation of state of the vacuum , it is straightforward to check that the change of entropy in a comoving volume of space @xmath81 is given by @xmath82 , which vanishes as a consequence of conservation of vacuum energy .",
    "in the absence of data that does not distinguish between models for an accelerating universe , a criterion for the success of a given model is the lack of fine - tuning of fundamental parameters . in a spatially flat model with cosmological constant , @xmath83 , and non - relativistic matter ( @xmath7-model ) ,",
    "the fine - tuning problem is often understood as a coincidence between the matter density @xmath23 and the energy density associated with the cosmological constant , @xmath84 , at the present time .",

    "the favored values of @xmath84 are either @xmath102 or @xmath103 , the latter value being at discrepancy with observations by about @xmath104 orders of magnitude .    in our model",
    ", the question then is whether there may be a natural explanation for the small value of the mass parameter @xmath105 .",
    "frieman et al .",
    "@xcite show that , for spin-0 pseudo nambu - goldstone bosons ( pngb ) , a mass scale @xmath67 of the order of the present value of the hubble constant can be generated from the neutrino mass @xmath106 ev and a global symmetry breaking scale ( for example , the scale for spontaneous breaking of the u(1 ) peccie - quinn symmetry ) @xmath107 gev , via the combination @xmath108 .",
    "they also show that this combination arises out of the coupling of such a pseudo nambu - goldstone boson to neutrinos in a low - energy effective theory .",
    "it therefore appears possible that the ultralight spin-0 particle we consider in our model may be related to a pngb , although such a relation would involve additional self - interaction terms .",
    "although the basic dynamical equations , ( 2 ) and ( 8) , incorporate non - trivial quantum effects , our model admits a remarkably simple description .",
    "indeed , the scale factor ( [ scfactor ] ) may be used to find the total effective energy density @xmath109 and pressure @xmath60 of vacuum plus matter by directly computing the einstein tensor .",

    "after the reheating process at the end of inflation , the universe is expected to be radiation - dominated , with @xmath138 decreasing to a small value .",
    "as the universe expands , and enough matter becomes non - relativistic , @xmath139 increases smoothly to a maximum value much greater than @xmath134 . as the universe expands further , it enters a matter - dominated stage . during this stage ,",
    "@xmath139 decreases again , until about half the age of the universe ( @xmath1 ) , when it passes through the value @xmath134 , and quantum vacuum effects begin to dominate , leading to the present acceleration .",
    "however , as described above , there are two early stages of the evolution during which @xmath139 may pass through the value @xmath134 , namely , during the reheating from inflationary expansion to radiation - dominated expansion , and when @xmath140 is increasing during the radiation - dominated stage of the expansion of the universe .",
    "what role do quantum vacuum effects of this ultralow - mass particle play during these two early stages ?    to answer this question , we consider two possibilities for the value of @xmath139 during the radiation - dominated stage : ( a ) there is sufficient non - relativistic matter at the end of post - inflationary reheating so that @xmath139 is always greater than @xmath141 during the radiation - dominated stage , or ( b ) there is not enough non - relativistic matter , and the condition , @xmath142 , is satisfied at some time during the radiation - dominated stage .    if possibility ( a ) occurs , then the `` resonance '' condition is never satisfied during the reheating from inflationary to radiation - dominated expansion or the subsequent evolution from radiation - dominated to matter - dominated expansion .",
    "thus these quantum vacuum effects of an ultralow - mass particle remain negligible in the early universe and in the matter - dominated stage , until the universe transits to vacuum - dominance at about half its present age , as described in section ii .",
    "if possibility ( b ) occurs , then a resonance of the type discussed here will occur during the reheating from inflationary expansion to radiation - dominated expansion , and will force @xmath10 to remain nearly equal to @xmath25 during the early part of the radiation - dominated stage . during such a stage ,",
    "the scale factor would be @xmath143 .",
    "however , @xmath144 during this stage , and the scale factor , to excellent approximation , exhibits radiation - dominated behavior , i.e. , @xmath145 .",
    "once enough non - relativistic matter has accumulated , @xmath139 increases above the value @xmath146 while the universe is still radiation - dominated . at this point , quantum effects become negligible , as can be seen from eq .",
    "once there is sufficient non - relativistic matter , the exit from vacuum - dominance must occur . ] .",
    "eventually , the universe transits to the matter - dominated stage . much later , at time @xmath0 , when the condition @xmath147 is again satisfied , the universe transits to vacuum - dominance , giving rise to the present acceleration .",
    "however , because the density of non - relativistic matter ( or equivalently , @xmath138 ) is now decreasing , the universe remains vacuum - dominated for all time .",
    "the above arguments show that , even if these ultralow - mass nonperturbative quantum vacuum effects become significant at early times in the evolution of the universe , the eventual transition to the present vacuum - dominated stage is not affected and the early universe dynamics is not significantly altered beyond the standard cosmological model .",
    "the cosmological model that we investigate here is based on nonperturbative vacuum effects of a quantized noninteracting massive scalar field .",
    "this model is the simplest one exhibiting these nonperturbative quantum effects .",
    "it is based on the extension of quantum field theory to curved spacetime , a subject that has been extensively developed and has given rise to fundamental advances in black hole physics and cosmology .    in the present paper , we have studied the particle production resulting from the imaginary part of the same term that , in earlier work , we showed would cause , through its real part , an acceleration of the universe consistent with that inferred from recent supernovae observations and other cosmological data .",
    "we find that the predicted rate of particle production during the recent vacuum - dominated era is the same as that found by other methods .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that this production rate also agrees with that found by the bogolubov transformation technique @xcite .",
    "this agreement of the particle production rate given by the imaginary part of our effective action , adds confidence to the validity of the acceleration resulting from the real part of the same term in the effective action .",
    "the density and effective temperature of these ultralight particles created after the transition to vacuum dominance is negligible compared to the matter and radiation already present .",
    "however , the production of these particles in the early universe would leave a remnant of such particles similar to the remnant of gravitons created near the big bang .",
    "the mass of these particles is such that they may contribute a component to dark matter that is sufficiently cold to be gravitationally concentrated in the vicinity of galaxies .",
    "the possibility that these may contribute to extended galactic halos is worth exploring , as is the effect , if any , of these particles on big - bang nucleosynthesis in the early universe .",
    "the evolution of the scale factor , @xmath148 , in our cosmological solution depends on a single parameter related to the mass @xmath8 of the particle .",
    "cosmological data give a value for @xmath8 of order @xmath149 ev .",
    "this mass is of the same order of magnitude as the mass of a pseudo - nambu - goldstone boson , obtained by independent particle physics considerations @xcite . as discussed in sec .",
    "iv , this fact may be significant with regard to the question of fine - tuning .",
    "we calculated the effective equation of state during the vacuum - dominated era in our model , and gave the function @xmath118 .",
    "the effective equation of state of vacuum plus matter during the vacuum - dominated stage turns out to be the same as that of a classical model with radiation plus cosmological constant , although the actual matter content is mainly non - relativistic .",
    "we showed that these nonperturbative vacuum effects of an ultralow mass field would not significantly alter standard cosmology at early times .",
    "the possible existence of much more massive scalar fields , for which these nonperturbative vacuum effects would be significant in the very early universe , may enhance inflation .",
    "in addition , the associated particle production may help reheat the universe during the exit from early inflation .",
    "it is possible that processes , such as spontaneous symmetry breaking ( caused , for example , by a self - interaction ) , may cause the vacuum expectation value of the field to become non - zero , while its fluctuations are reduced . in the present non - interacting model ,",
    "such processes are absent .",
    "the effect of interactions , such as those arising from a pngb , on the observational predictions of the present model ( involving an ultralight mass ) is also worth exploring .    also worth noting",
    "is that quantum vacuum terms would become dominant in regions of low average density ( i.e. , @xmath150 ) earlier than in regions of high average density .",
    "this would alter the evolution of density inhomogeneities that existed during the early matter - domnated stage of the expansion .",
    "this may eventually provide another observational test of our model .",
    "our present model may soon be observationally tested relative to other models through observations of the small - scale cmbr fluctuations .",
    "these fluctuations are determined by the function @xmath119 ( given in sec .",
    "non - zero spatial curvature would , of course , affect the predicted shape of the cmbr fluctuation spectrum , as would the addition of interactions to our present free - field model .",
