    "twa-7 ( 2mass j10423011 - 3340162 ) is a weak - lined t tauri star first recognized with a follow - up observation of unidentified rosat x - ray sources ( voges et al .",
    "1999 ; webb et al . 1999 ; neuhuser et al .",
    "it is a member of the nearby association of young stars , tw hydrae association ( twa ; kastner et al .",
    "the distance to the source is estimated to be 27@xmath72 pc by mamajek ( 2005 ) from the moving cluster method ( e.g. , atanasijevic 1971 ; de bruijne 1999 ) .",
    "we use this value as the distance throughout this paper , although in the past literature , @xmath8 pc had been usually adopted from the apparent extent of twa and the mean hipparcos distance derived from four members of twa ( neuhuser et al .",
    "twa-7 has the spectral type of m1 and youth indicators of high lithium abundance , x - ray activity , and strong chromospheric activity ( webb et al . 1999 ; neuhuser et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the bolometric luminosity at 27 pc is re - calculated to be log @xmath5/@xmath9 from the value obtained by neuhuser et al .",
    "( 2000 ) who assumed that @xmath10 pc . the excess emission detected with infrared ( 24 @xmath11 m and 70 @xmath11 m ; low et al .",
    "2005 ) and submillimeter bands ( webb 2000 ; matthews et al . 2007 ) indicates the presence of a debris disk without ongoing accretion . the mass of the disk is estimated to be 4.3 @xmath12 , if the distance is 27 pc .",
    "owing to the close proximity , the multiplicity of twa-7 has been well studied with imaging observations .",
    "neuhuser et al . ( 2000 ) argued the possibility of direct imaging detection of extra - solar planets with ground - based telescopes , and raised the evidence for a possible planetary companion to twa-7 using hst nicmos . assuming the distance of 55 pc",
    ", they estimated the mass of 3 @xmath13 for the faint object . a further search with the hst nicmos revealed that the faint possible companion is a background object from the inconsistency in proper motions ( lowrance et al . 2005 ) , but",
    "the above studies indicate that any possible companion of twa-7 must have a very low mass , possibly planetary mass .    in the rosat all - sky survey catalog ( voges et al .",
    "1999 ) , twa-7 is named as 1rxs j104230.3 - 334014 . an x - ray flux of 3@xmath14 ergs @xmath1 s@xmath2 is derived in the rosat band ( @xmath150.12 kev ) by webb et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and stelzer & neuhuser ( 2000 ) .",
    "twa-7 is also detected through the xmm - newton slew survey in 2010 january at 1.9 counts s@xmath2 ( 0.212 kev ) and 1.6 counts s@xmath2 ( 0.22 kev ) ( saxton et al .",
    "the hardness ratio obtained by dividing the count rate in 212 kev by that in 0.22 kev band is 0.19 . if we assume a thin thermal spectrum ( @xmath16 model in xspec ; smith et al .",
    "2001 ) with metal abundance of 0.3 solar and negligible absorbing column , a temperature of @xmath17 kev is consistent with the observed hardness ratio .",
    "this model gives the flux of 4@xmath14 ergs @xmath1 s@xmath2 ( 0.22 kev ) , and 2@xmath14 ergs @xmath1 s@xmath2 ( 212 kev ) .",
    "the flux in the 0.22 kev band is almost equal to that obtained with rosat , and we can be confident that these fluxes correspond to the quiescent level . we detected a large x - ray flare from twa-7 with the gas slit camera ( gsc ) on the monitor of all - sky x - ray image ( maxi ) deployed on the international space station ( atel # 2836 : morii et al .",
    "the x - ray flux is three orders of magnitude higher than that in the quiescent level , and the x - ray luminosity indicates this event is among the largest x - ray flares from t tauri stars .",
    "the maxi carries two scientific instruments : the gas slit camera ( gsc ) ( mihara et al . 2011 ) and the solid state camera ( ssc ) ( tomida et al .",
    "both the gsc and the ssc consist of two identical modules aimed at different directions ( horizontal and zenithal direction ) .",
    "the instantaneous field of view for one direction is 3@xmath18160@xmath19 ( gsc ) and 1.5@xmath1890@xmath19 ( ssc ) , if all the cameras are active .",
    "it means that they can cover 98% ( gsc ) and 70% ( ssc ) of the whole sky",
    "at the maximum every orbit , if there is no down time on the detectors .",
    "the maxi surveys the sky 16 times per day .",
    "the gsc consists of twelve one - dimensional position - sensitive proportional counters operating in the 230 kev range , while the ssc is composed of 32 x - ray ccd cameras covering the energy range of 0.512 kev .",
    "the gsc offers larger effective area ( 5350 @xmath20 ) than that of the ssc ( 200 @xmath20 ) .",
    "see matsuoka et al .",
    "( 2009 ) for more details about the maxi . on 2010",
    "september 7th , two gsc cameras , covering the direction of twa-7 , caught an intense flare , while no data were obtained for the same direction with ssc .",
    "the transient x - ray emission was observed at the position of ( r.a . ,",
    "dec ) = ( 10d 43 m 27s , @xmath2133h 40 m 53s ) ( j2000 ) during the scan transit of 40 seconds starting at ut 2010 - 09 - 07 18:22:45 . the error region ( 90% confidence level ) can be estimated with a combination of the statistical error box and the calibration uncertainty on the alignment ( 0.2 degree at the 90% limit ; sugizaki et al .",
    "the statistical error box is a rectangle with the long side of 0.845 degree and the short side of 0.565 degree .",
    "the corners are ( r.a . , dec ) = ( 10d 44 m 22s , -34h 07 m 49s ) , ( 10d 40 m 55s , -33h 40 m 54s ) , ( 10d 42 m 32s , -33h 13 m 44s ) , and ( 10d 45 m 58s , -33h 40 m 36s ) ( j2000 ) . within the error region ,",
    "only twa-7 was found in the rosat bright source catalog ( voges et al .",
    "1999 ) . in order to test the significance of the transient event",
    ", we counted the numbers of events in the 220 kev band in 18 circles with 1.5@xmath19 radius around the transient event . here",
    ", the radius 1.5@xmath19 corresponds to the hwhm ( half - width half maximum ) of the psf ( point spread function ) of maxi gsc .",
    "we adopted the standard deviation of these 18 measurements for the 1-sigma background fluctuation .",
    "we extracted the counts in the same x - ray band in the circle with the same radius centered at the transient event , and subtracted the average of the background counts .",
    "then we confirmed that the transient event is detected with 12-@xmath22 level , and at the previous and the following scan transits ( 92 min before and after the detection ) , no significant x - ray emission was detected at more than 3-@xmath22 level .",
    "we , hereafter , call each of the above transits phase 0 ( pre - flare ) , phase 1 ( flare ) , and phase 2 ( post - flare ) , respectively .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the background - subtracted x - ray light curve in the 220 kev band .",
    "the time span for one bin is about 1 minute , which corresponds to one scan transit .",
    "the data were extracted from an ellipse with 1.8@xmath19 semi - major axis and 2.5@xmath19 semi - minor axis , centered on twa-7 .",
    "this region was selected to maximize the s / n ratio .",
    "the background was extracted from a circle with radius of 10@xmath19 centered on twa-7 , by removing the source region . in figure",
    "[ fig1 ] , the error bar indicates 1-@xmath22 error of the background - subtracted events , which is derived from @xmath23 { \\mathstrut s^{2 } + b^{2}}$ ] ( s is the counts in the source region and b is background counts which is expected to enter the source region ) . we fitted the light curve with a burst model which shows a linear rise followed by an exponential decay .",
    "the upper limit of the rising time is derived as 1.6 hours from the time - span between phase 0 and 1 , and the @xmath24-folding time is derived to be @xmath252.1 hours ( 90% confidence range ) by fitting from phase 1 to the last bin in figure 1 .",
    "these values are not inconsistent with the stellar flares reported in the literature ( e.g. imanishi et al .",
    "2003 , stelzer , neuhuser , & hambaryan 2000 , pandey & singh 2008 ) .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the background - subtracted x - ray spectrum during the flare phase ( phase 1 ) .",
    "the source region and the background region are the same as those used to make the light curve .",
    "we fitted the spectrum with the optically - thin thermal plasma model ( @xmath16 model ) in which all the metal abundances were fixed to 0.3 of solar values ( anders et al .",
    "1989 ) , which is generally obtained in various star forming regions ( e.g. imanishi et al .",
    "2001 , scelsi et al .",
    "2007 ) . since the interstellar absorption toward twa-7 is negligible , we fixed the absorbing column to zero .",
    "the best - fit values are summarized in table [ tab2 ] , while the best - fit model is shown as the solid line in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "we obtained 3@xmath26 ergs s@xmath2 @xmath1 for the flux in the 212 kev band .",
    "it is three orders of magnitude larger than the quiescent level ( @xmath152@xmath14 ergs @xmath1 s@xmath2 see  1 ) .",
    "the derived emission measure and x - ray luminosity in the 220 kev band are 2 ( 14 ) @xmath2710@xmath28 @xmath29 and 3 ( 24 ) @xmath2710@xmath30 ergs s@xmath2 , respectively ( errors are 90% confidence range ) .",
    "we also investigated the previous and following x - ray activity of this source using the entire maxi gsc data record for about 1.5 years since the operation started in 2009 august 15 , but found no significant flux except for the time span that this flare occurred on 2010 september 7 .",
    "the upper limit is 1@xmath31 ergs s@xmath2 @xmath1 in the 410 kev band with a detection significance ( @xmath32 ) of 7 ( hiroi et al .",
    "the detection limit of maxi gsc is not sensitive enough to detect the quiescent x - ray flux of twa-7 that one expects on the basis of previous measurements with different x - ray satellites",
    ". one might suspect that the maxi gsc band , which extends to 20 kev , can constrain the presence of a non - thermal component , but with the poor statistics , the spectrum does not provide evidence for the component .    ) .",
    "the time span for one bin is about 1 minute which correspondents to one scan transit .",
    "each inserted number ( 0 , 1 , 2 ) is allocated to a scan transit in pre - flare , flare , and decay phases , respectively .",

    "we have detected an x - ray flare from twa-7 for the first time .",
    "the x - ray luminosity in the 220 kev band reached up to @xmath33 ergs s@xmath2 , which is relatively large in flares from t tauri stars .",
    "this luminosity , however , gives only the lower limit on the flare peak , because maxi gsc can monitor a target only once ( @xmath151 min ) per 92 min orbital cycle . during phase 1 , which would not be the real peak , log @xmath4/@xmath34",
    "is obtained ; i.e. , the x - ray luminosity is comparable to the bolometric luminosity of 4@xmath35 ergs s@xmath2 at the phase . in various star - forming regions ,",
    "the log @xmath4/@xmath5 during flares from t tauri stars range from @xmath36 to @xmath37 ( e.g. @xmath38 oph : imanishi et al .",
    "2001 , orion trapezium at coup project : wolk et al .",
    "2005 ) . even during the big flare from v773 tau ( tsuboi et al .",
    "1998 ) , log @xmath4/@xmath39 , which is still one order of magnitude smaller than that of twa-7 .",
    "thus the most striking result obtained from the flare is the high x - ray - to - bolometric luminosity ratio .",
    "what makes twa-7 special ?",
    "twa-7 is known to have neither a stellar mass companion nor an accretion disk ( see  1 ) .",
    "this implies that neither binarity ( e.g. getman et al .",
    "2011 ) nor accretion ( e.g. kastner et al . 2002 , argiroffi et al . 2011 ) , nor star - disk interaction ( e.g. hayashi et al . 1996 , shu et al .",
    "1997 , montmerle et al",
    ". 2000 ) is essential to cause strong flares , but stellar magnetic activity alone can drive such energetic flare events .",
    "an x - ray flare such as the one described herein with a large x - ray - to - bolometric ratio , log @xmath4/@xmath40 , has not been reported before from a t tauri star , but has been reported in other stellar categories .",
    "pye & mchardy ( 1983 ) and rao & vahia ( 1987 ) observed x - ray flares from rs cvn systems and dme stars with the sky survey instrument ( ssi ) on ariel v , which scanned the sky once per @xmath15100 min with sensitivity in the 218 kev band . the observed log @xmath4/@xmath5 ranges from @xmath41 to @xmath42 . with a trigger by the all sky",
    "monitor swift bat , swift xrt also observed such a flare from the dme star ev lac with a log @xmath4/@xmath5 of 0.49 in the 0.310 kev band .",
    "stellar flare events with log @xmath4/@xmath5 of about 0 have only been found with all - sky surveys .",
    "this means that such giant flares are too rare to be detected with pointing observations .",
