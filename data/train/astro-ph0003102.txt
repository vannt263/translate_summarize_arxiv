    "the main strength of the gravitational microlensing planet search technique is that it is sensitive to lower mass planets than other techniques .",
    "observed from space , signals for planets down to the mass of mars are detectable , but they are much rarer and have a shorter duration than higher mass planetary signals .",
    "thus , a large number of stars must be followed with a high sampling frequency in order to detect low mass planets . with gest , we are able to monitor @xmath9 stars once every 30 minutes or so with a photometric accuracy of @xmath10% .",
    "the microlensing event will not repeat , so high quality photometric data must be obtained while the event is in progress .",
    "our proposed gest mission will accomplish this .",
    "the planetary systems studied by the microlensing technique are located @xmath11kpc away towards the galactic center rather than in the local neighborhood .",
    "the planetary signals will usually be detected as a modifications of the single lens light curve due to the gravitational effect of the planet .",
    "microlensing is most sensitive to planets near the einstein ring radius which corresponds to a distance of @xmath12au from the lens star , but because gest does not require the discovery of stellar microlensing event to begin intensive monitoring for planets , gest will be able to detect planets at arbitrarily large separations from their host stars .",
    "one such isolated planet may have already been observed ( bennett et al 1997 ) by the macho collaboration .",
    "the main challenge for a microlensing search for low mass planets is that , although the planetary signals can be strong , they are both very rare and and have durations as short as @xmath13hours ( mao & paczynski 1991 ; gould & loeb 1992 ) . furthermore , the relatively large angular size of giant source stars makes them poor targets for a low mass microlensing planet search project as finite source effects ( bennett & rhie 1996 ) tend to wash out the microlensing signal .",
    "thus , gest must be able to monitor large areas of sky rapidly while attaining @xmath14% photometry on main sequence source stars . in the central galactic bulge fields where the microlensing rate is highest ,",
    "ground based images are seriously incomplete at or above the bulge main sequence turn - off , so there is a great advantage to be gained from higher resolution imaging from space which will allow many of the main sequence stars to be separately resolved . since areas of high star density must be observed , we need high angular resolution to maintain photometric accuracy .",
    "so , we are led to a requirement of a large field of view and a high angular resolution  for a very large number of ccd pixels .",
    "our baseline design calls for a @xmath14 square degree field of view with pixels of @xmath15 \" or smaller , for a total of @xmath16 pixels .",
    "our suggested observing strategy will be to cycle over 4 - 6 selected fields near the galactic center every 20 - 30 minutes .",
    "given the high data rate implied by this strategy , a geosynchronous orbit seems sensible .",
    "our selected galactic bulge fields fields have high reddening , so it is advantageous to observe at long wavelengths .",
    "fortunately , recent developments in ccd technology have produced devices with a quantum efficiency of @xmath17% at 750 - 950 nm ( groom et al 2000 ) .",
    "this is @xmath18 times better than the ccd s used by hst s wfpc2 camera .",
    "we have carried out a detailed simulation of the expected performance of the gest mission . here",
    "are the relevant features of our simulation : we assume that 6 square degrees of the galactic bulge are observed once every 27 minutes .",
    "photometry is assumed to be done using a difference imaging technique which is photon noise limited with a 0.3% systematic error added in quadrature .",
    "the photon noise is due to the target star and also any neighboring stars which have a psf that overlaps with the target star .",
    "the effect of the neighboring stars was taken into account by constructing an artificial image with a resolution of 0.16 \" ( the diffraction limit for a 1.5 m telescope at @xmath19 nm ) .",
    "we assume a signal to noise of 60 for a source with @xmath20 , or about 16 detected photo - electrons per second for a 225 sec exposure .",
    "this estimate assumes the use of high sensitivity ccd s and a broad passband of 750 - 950 nm .",
    "we assume that the luminosity function found by holtzman  ( 1998 ) for baade s window applies to the entire 6 square degrees .",
    "this is conservative in that most of our fields will be closer to the galactic center with a higher star density , but this will be partially compensated for by the higher reddening in these fields .",
    "we conservatively assume a microlensing optical depth of @xmath21 which is slightly below the measured values ( udalski et al , 1994 ; alcock et al 1997 ) , and we assume the event timescale distribution given by alcock  ( 2000 ) as shown in figure 1 .",
    "our simulated gest mission observes a total of 18,000 microlensing events with peak magnification @xmath22 for source stars down to @xmath23 over an assumed 3 year mission which observes the galactic bulge for 8 months per year .",
    "our detection threshold is a cut on @xmath24 which is the @xmath25 difference between a single lens and planetary binary lens fit .",
    "we ve simulated planetary microlensing lightcurves for planets at a range of separations ranging from @xmath26au , and the left hand panel of figure 2 shows the number of detected planets if each lens system has a planet of the assumed mass fraction ( @xmath27 ) at the assumed separation .",
    "the right hand panel of figure 2 shows the number of detected  isolated \" planets as a function of the planetary mass fraction , @xmath27 , which is now compared to the average stellar mass .",
    "figure 2 indicates that we ll be able to detect 50 - 100 earth mass planets if they are common at distances of a few au or more , and 10 - 20 earth mass planets if they are common at 1 au .",
    "we also expect to detect @xmath28 10 mars mass planets if they are common at a few au .",
    "the right panel of figure 1 shows the distribution of low mass planet detections as a function of our signal - to - noise parameter @xmath24 , and it indicates that most of the detections are well above our nominal detection threshold of @xmath29 .",
    "examples of simulated gest low mass planetary lightcurves are shown in figures 3 - 7 .    for more massive planets ,",
    "our sensitivity is much better . for solar system",
    "analogs , our simulations indicate that gest would detect @xmath5 gas giant planets if our solar system is typical .",
    "if the typical planetary system resembles the solar system with saturn and jupiter replaced by neptune mass planets , then gest would detect @xmath6 of these neptune - like planets .",
    "in addition to detecting the planetary perturbation to the microlensing lightcurve , it is also important to determine the characteristics of the planet that has been detected",
    ". microlensing generally allows the determination of the planetary mass fraction , @xmath27 , and the transverse separation of the planet from the lens star in units of the einstein radius which is typically about @xmath30au .",
    "gaudi and gould ( 1997 ) have shown that these parameters can be accurately determined if the lightcurve deviations are well sampled . for caustic crossing planetary microlensing events which comprise a large fraction of the low mass planet detections ,",
    "it is also possible to determine the planetary mass to about a factor of 2 or 3 .",
    "the gravitational microlensing planet search technique has previously been been considered for ground based observations ( peale 1997 ; sackett 1997 ; rhie et al 2000 ; albrow et al 2000 ) , but ground based surveys face some difficulties due to the requirement of continuous lightcurve monitoring .",
    "this can be accomplished with a network of microlensing follow - up telescopes spanning the globe at southern latitudes , but this requires that the survey rely upon observing sites that often have poor weather or seeing conditions .",
    "sackett ( 1997 ) has argued that a dedicated 2.5 m telescope like the vst with a wide field camera at an excellent site like paranal could efficiently search for low mass planets where the deviations are expected to last only a few hours .",
    "we have done a simulation of such a survey ( optimistically ) assuming observations in consistent 0.7 \" seeing for 8 hours every night for 3 bulge seasons , and we find that low mass planets are not easily detected by such a ground based survey because the highest signal - to - noise events generally last longer than a few hours . if we demand that more than 90% of the @xmath24 signal occur in the 8 hour observing window for an event to have measurable parameters , then we find that this  vst \" survey is 30 - 50 times less sensitive to low mass planets than gest as shown in figure 2 .",
    "also , even the  best \" planet detection in the vst survey misses a significant part of the planetary deviation as seen in figure 6 .",
    "a study by peale ( 1997 ) of a ground based microlensing planet search program with follow - up telescopes in chile , australia , and south africa , also only manages a handful of low mass planet detections after eight years of observations and is not sensitive to isolated or mars mass planets .",
    "so , the proposed gest mission is @xmath31 times more sensitive to low mass planets than both types of propsed ground based surveys .",
