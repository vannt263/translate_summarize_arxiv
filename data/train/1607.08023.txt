    "molecular gas is one of the essential components in galaxies because it is closely related to star formation , which is a fundamental process of galaxy evolution .",
    "thus the observational study of molecular gas is indispensable to understand both star formation in galaxies and galaxy evolution .",
    "however , the most abundant constituent in molecular gas , h@xmath15 , can not emit any electro - magnetic wave in cold molecular gas with typical temperature of @xmath16 10 k due to the lack of a permanent dipole moment . instead",
    ", rotational transition lines of @xmath1co , the second abundant molecule , have been used as a tracer of molecular gas .",
    "for example , some extensive @xmath1co surveys of external galaxies , which consist of single pointings toward central regions and some mappings along the major axis , have been reported ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these studies provided new findings about global properties of galaxies , such as excitation condition of molecular gas in galaxy centers and radial distributions of molecular gas across galaxy disks .    in order to understand the relationship between molecular gas and star formation in galaxies further ,",
    "spatially resolved @xmath1co maps covering whole galaxy disks are necessary because star formation rates ( sfrs ) are often different between galaxy centers and disks .",
    "in particular , single - dish observations are essential to measure @xmath17 molecular gas content in the observing beam from dense component to diffuse one avoiding the missing flux ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "so far , two major surveys of wide - area @xmath1co mapping toward nearby galaxies are performed using multi - beam receivers mounted on large single - dish telescopes .",
    "one is the @xmath1co(@xmath0 ) mapping survey of 40 nearby spiral galaxies performed with the nobeyama radio observatory ( nro ) 45-m telescope in the position - switch mode ( @xcite , hereafter k07 ) .",
    "their @xmath1co(@xmath0 ) maps cover most of the optical disks of galaxies at an angular resolution of 15@xmath18 , and clearly show two - dimensional distributions of molecular gas in galaxies .",
    "k07 found that the degree of the central concentration of molecular gas is higher in barred spiral galaxies than in non - barred spiral galaxies .",
    "in addition , they found a correlation between the degree of central concentration and the bar strength adopted from @xcite ; i.e. , galaxies with stronger bar tend to exhibit a higher central concentration .",
    "this correlation suggests that stronger bars accumulate molecular gas toward central regions more efficiently , which may contribute the onset of intense star formation at galaxy centers ( i.e. , higher sfrs than disks ) . using the @xmath1co(@xmath0 ) data , @xcite investigated the physical properties of molecular gas in the barred spiral galaxy maffei 2 .",
    "they found that molecular gas in the bar ridge regions may be gravitationally unbound , which suggests that molecular gas is hard to become dense , and to form stars in the bar .",
    "the other survey is the heterodyne receiver array co line extragalactic survey performed with the iram 30-m telescope @xcite .",
    "they observed @xmath1co(@xmath7 ) emission over the full optical disks of 48 nearby galaxies at an angular resolution of 13@xmath18 , and found that the @xmath1co(@xmath7)/@xmath1co(@xmath0 ) line intensity ratio ( hereafter @xmath8 ) typically ranges from 0.6 to 1.0 with the averaged value of 0.8 .",
    "in addition , @xcite examined a quantitative relationship between surface densities of molecular gas and sfrs for 30 nearby galaxies at a spatial resolution of 1  kpc using the @xmath1co(@xmath7 ) data .",
    "they found a first - order linear correspondence between surface densities of molecular gas and sfrs but also found second - order systematic variations ; i.e. , the apparent molecular gas depletion time , which is defined by the ratio of the surface density of molecular gas to that of sfr , becomes shorter with the decrease in stellar mass , metallicity , and dust - to - gas ratio .",
    "they suggest that this can be explained by a co - to - h@xmath15 conversion factor ( @xmath19 ) that depends on dust shielding .",
    "however , such global co maps of galaxies have raised a new question ; the cause of the spatial variation in star formation efficiencies ( sfes ) defined as sfrs per unit gas mass .",
    "it is reported that sfes differ not only among galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) but also within locations / regions in a galaxy ( e.g. , @xcite ) ; i.e. , higher sfes are often observed in galaxy mergers rather than normal spiral galaxies and also observed in the nuclear star forming region rather than in galaxy disks .",
    "some observational studies based on hcn emission , an excellent dense gas tracer , suggest that sfes increase with the increase in molecular gas density ( or dense gas fraction ) in galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , but the cause of the spatial variation in sfes is still an open question because hcn emission in galaxy disks is too weak to obtain its map except for some gas - rich spiral galaxies ( e.g. , m  51 ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    instead , isotopes of co molecule are promising probes of molecular gas density .",
    "in particular , @xmath2co(@xmath0 ) is thought to be optically thin and thus trace denser molecular gas ( @xmath20 ) rather than @xmath1co(@xmath0 ) , which is optically thick and traces relatively diffuse molecular gas ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "therefore , the relative intensity between @xmath2co(@xmath0 ) and @xmath1co(@xmath0 ) is sensitive to physical properties of molecular gas .",
    "for example , spatial variations in @xmath2co(@xmath0)/@xmath1co(@xmath0 ) intensity ratios ( hereafter @xmath9 ) were observed in nearby galaxy disks ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "such variations in @xmath9 , typically ranging from 0.05 to 0.20 , are interpreted as the variation in molecular gas density ; i.e. , @xmath9 increases with the increase in molecular gas density .",
    "however , some observations suggest that @xmath9 in central regions of nearby galaxies are lower than those in disk regions ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) although central regions of galaxies often show intense star formation activities , suggesting higher molecular gas density .",
    "the cause of the low @xmath9 in central regions is thought to be high temperature of molecular gas due to the heating by uv radiation from a lot of young massive stars .",
    "such a degeneracy between density and temperature of molecular gas in a line ratio can be solved using two ( or more ) molecular line ratios with a theoretical calculation on the excitation of molecular gas such as the large velocity gradient ( lvg ) model @xcite .",
    "for example , the density and kinetic temperature of giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) were determined using @xmath9 and @xmath1co(@xmath22)/@xmath1co(@xmath0 ) ratio for large magellanic cloud @xcite and m  33 @xcite , and also determined using @xmath9 and @xmath8 for the spiral arm of m  51 @xcite .",
    "this method to determine molecular gas density is useful to investigate the cause of the variation in sfes .",
    "thus the dependence of sfes on molecular gas density should be investigated for various galaxies at high angular resolution based on multiple line ratios including @xmath9 .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the relationship between sfe and molecular gas density within a nearby barred spiral galaxy ngc  2903 using an archival @xmath1co(@xmath7 ) map combined with @xmath1co(@xmath0 ) and @xmath2co(@xmath0 ) maps which are newly obtained by the co multi - line imaging of nearby galaxies ( coming ) project with the nro 45-m telescope .",
    "ngc  2903 is a gas - rich galaxy exhibiting bright nuclear star formation ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the distance to ngc  2903 is estimated to be 8.9 mpc @xcite ; thus the effective angular resolution of 20@xmath18 for the on - the - fly ( otf ) mapping with the nro 45-m corresponds to 870 pc .",
    "this enables us to resolve major structures within ngc  2903 , such as the center , bar , and spiral arms although its inclination of @xcite is not so small .",
    "in addition , ngc  2903 is rich in archival multi - wavelength data set ; i.e. , not only the @xmath1co(@xmath7 ) map to examine @xmath8 but also h@xmath23 and infrared images to calculate sfrs are available .",
    "thus this galaxy is a preferable target to examine the cause of the variation in sfe in terms of molecular gas density .",
    "basic parameters of ngc  2903 are summarized in table  1 .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : we describe the overview of the coming project and explain the detail of the co observations and data reduction for ngc  2903 in section 2 .",
    "then , we show results of observations ; i.e. , spectra and velocity - integrated intensity maps of @xmath1co(@xmath0 ) and @xmath2co(@xmath0 ) emission in section 3 .",
    "we obtain averaged spectra of @xmath1co(@xmath0 ) , @xmath2co(@xmath0 ) , and @xmath1co(@xmath7 ) emission for nine representative regions , and measure averaged @xmath9 and @xmath8 for each region in section 4.1 .",
    "we determine molecular gas density and kinetic temperature for the center , bar , bar - ends , and spiral arms using @xmath9 and @xmath8 based on the lvg approximation in section 4.2 .",
    "finally , we investigate the cause of the variation in sfe by examining the dependence of sfe on molecular gas density and kinetic temperature .",
    "coming is a project to map @xmath0 emission of @xmath1co , @xmath2co , and c@xmath3o molecules simultaneously for 70% area of optical disks of 238 galaxies using the four - beam receiver system on 45-m telescope ( forest ; @xcite ) at nro .",
    "the main purposes of the coming are to characterize properties of molecular gas as sequence of , hubble types , dynamical structures , central concentrations , and star formation activities , as well as surrounding environments of galaxies .",
    "more detailed information on coming project including the current status of the survey will be reported in the forthcoming paper ( sorai et al . in preparation ) .",
    "@xmath1co(@xmath0 ) , @xmath2co(@xmath0 ) , and c@xmath3o(@xmath0 ) emission observations of ngc  2903 were performed using the nro 45-m telescope from april to may , 2015 , employing the otf mapping mode . the observed area is about @xmath4 , which corresponds to @xmath24 kpc at the distance of 8.9 mpc , as indicated in figure  1 .",
    "the total time for the observations was 13 hrs .",
    "we used a new @xmath25 focal - plane dual - polarization sideband - separating sis mixer receiver for the single side band ( ssb ) operation , forest , which provides 8 intermediate frequency ( if ) paths ( i.e. , 4 beam @xmath5 2 polarization ) independently . owing to the wide",
    "if range of 4 to 12 ghz , we could simultaneously observe @xmath1co(@xmath0 ) emission at 115 ghz ( if = 10 ghz ) and @xmath2co(@xmath0 ) and c@xmath3o(@xmath0 ) emission at 110 ghz ( if = 5 ghz ) when the frequency of the local oscillator was set to 105 ghz .",
    "the backend was an fx - type correlator system , sam45 , which consists of 16 arrays with 4096 spectral channels each .",
    "we set the frequency coverage and resolution for each array of 2 ghz and 488.24 khz , which gives velocity coverage and resolution of 5220 km s@xmath26 and 1.27 km s@xmath26 at 115 ghz , and those of 5450 km s@xmath26 and 1.33 km s@xmath26 at 110 ghz .",
    "we assigned 8 of 16 arrays to 115 ghz band ( i.e. , if = 9  11 ghz for @xmath1co(@xmath0 ) emission ) and other 8 arrays to 110 ghz band ( i.e. , if = 4  6 ghz for @xmath2co(@xmath0 ) and c@xmath3o(@xmath0 ) emission ) .",
    "the half - power beam widths of the 45-m with the forest were @xmath27 at 115 ghz and @xmath28 at 110 ghz , respectively .",
    "the system noise temperatures were 300  500 k at 115 ghz and 200  250 k at 110 ghz during the observing run .",
    "we performed the otf mapping along the major and minor axes of the galaxy disk whose position angle was ( k07 ) .",
    "the separation between the scan rows was set to @xmath29 , and the spatial sampling interval was @xmath30 applying a dump time of 0.1  second and a scanning speed of @xmath31  s@xmath26 .",
    "the data sets scanned along two orthogonal axes were co - added by the basket - weave method @xcite to remove any effects of scanning noise . in order to check the absolute pointing accuracy every hour , we observed an sio maser source , w - cnc , using a 43 ghz band receiver .",
    "it was better than @xmath32 ( peak - to - peak ) throughout the observations .",
    "in addition , we observed @xmath1co(@xmath0 ) and @xmath2co(@xmath0 ) emission of w  3 and irc+10216 every day to obtain the scaling factors for converting the observed antenna temperature to the main beam temperature for each if .",
    "note that these scaling factors not only correct the main - beam efficiency ( @xmath33 ) of the 45-m antenna but also compensate the decrease in line intensity due to the incompleteness of the image rejection for ssb receiver ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the absolute error of the temperature scale for each co spectrum was about @xmath34% , mainly due to variations in @xmath33 and the image rejection ratio of the forest .",
    "data reduction was made using the software package nostar , which comprises tools for otf data analysis , developed by nro @xcite .",
    "we excluded bad spectra , which includes strong baseline undulation and spurious lines , from the raw data .",
    "then , linear baselines were subtracted , and the raw data were regridded to 6@xmath35 per pixel with an effective angular resolution of approximately 20@xmath35 ( or 870 pc ) .",
    "we binned the adjacent spectral channels to a velocity resolution of 10 km s@xmath26 for the spectra .",
    "finally , we created three - dimensional data cubes in @xmath1co(@xmath0 ) , @xmath2co(@xmath0 ) , and c@xmath3o(@xmath0 ) emission .",
    "the resultant r.m.s .",
    "noise levels ( 1 @xmath36 ) were 60 mk , 39 mk , and 40 mk for @xmath1co(@xmath0 ) , @xmath2co(@xmath0 ) , and c@xmath3o(@xmath0 ) , respectively .",

    "the median and the standard deviation in @xmath37 are 12.9 k km s@xmath26 and 12.4 k km s@xmath26 for coming dataset , and those are 15.2 k km s@xmath26 and 12.6 k km s@xmath26 for k07 dataset .",

    "the stacking technique for co spectra in external galaxies are originally demonstrated by schruba et al .",
    "( 2011 , 2012 ) .",
    "since the observed velocities of each position within a galaxy are different due to its rotation , a simple stacking causes a smearing of spectrum . in order to overcome such difficulty",
    ", @xcite demonstrated the velocity - axis alignment of co spectra in different regions in a galaxy disk according to mean h velocity .",

    "/ n @xmath2co(@xmath0 ) spectra which are improved by a factor of up to 3.2 compared to the normal ( without velocity - axis alignment ) stacking analysis .    these earlier studies clearly suggest that the stacking analysis is very useful to detect weak molecular line . in this section",
    ", we employ the same stacking technique as @xcite to improve the s / n of @xmath2co(@xmath0 ) emission and to obtain more accurate line ratios . based on our @xmath37 image ( figure  3 ) ,",
    "we have separated ngc  2903 into nine regions according to its major structures ; i.e. , center , northern bar , southern bar , northern bar - end , southern bar - end , northern arm , southern arm , inter - arm , and outer - disk .",
    "the left panel of figure  8 shows the separation of each region overlaid by the grey - scale map of @xmath37 . for each region , we stacked @xmath1co(@xmath0 ) , @xmath2co(@xmath0 ) , and @xmath1co(@xmath7 ) spectra with velocity - axis alignment based on the intensity - weighted mean velocity field calculated from our @xmath1co(@xmath0 ) data ( right panel of figure  8) .",
    "we successfully obtained the stacked co spectra as shown in figure  9 .",
    "the s / n of each co emission is dramatically improved , and thus we could confirm the significant @xmath2co(@xmath0 ) emission for all the regions .",
    "we found the difference in the line shape of stacked co spectra according to regions .",
    "in particular , the stacked @xmath1co spectra in the bar show flat peak over the velocity width of 100  150 km s@xmath26 .",
    "this is presumably due to the rapid velocity change in the bar , which makes the velocity - axis alignment difficult .",

    "such a variation in @xmath8 ranging from 0.6 to 1.0 in ngc  2903 is quite consistent with those observed in nearby galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "this trend of @xmath10 can be naturally explained if we consider the optical depth of @xmath1co and @xmath2co emission .",
    "@xmath1co is always optically thick and thus its emission emerges from the diffuse envelope of dense gas clouds , while @xmath2co emission emerges from further within these dense gas clouds due to its lower abundance . since the increase in the assumed [ @xmath1co]/[@xmath2co ] abundance ratio means that @xmath2co becomes more optically thin , @xmath2co emission emerged from deeper within the dense gas clouds and thus it probes denser gas . derived physical properties , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , are summarized in table  3 .",
    "we compare the derived @xmath10 and @xmath11 in ngc  2903 with those determined in other external galaxies .",
    "@xcite determined @xmath10 and @xmath11 for gmcs associated with the giant h region ngc  604 in m  33 at a spatial resolution of 100 pc using three molecular lines , @xmath1co(@xmath0 ) , @xmath2co(@xmath0 ) , and @xmath1co(@xmath22 ) , based on the lvg approximation .",
    "the derived @xmath10 and @xmath11 are 800  2500 @xmath13 and 20  30 k , respectively , which are similar to our study for ngc  2903 in spite of the difference in the spatial resolution .",
    "however , @xcite obtained different physical properties for gmcs in spiral arms of m  51 .",
    "they performed the lvg analysis using @xmath9 and @xmath8 at a spatial resolution of 120  180 pc .",
    "for the case of constant @xmath48 = 1.0 km s@xmath26 pc@xmath26 , the derived @xmath11 ranges from 10 to 50 k , which is similar to our study for ngc  2903 , whereas @xmath10 ranges from 100 to 400 @xmath13 , which is 5  10 times lower than that in the disk of ngc  2903 in spite that the values of @xmath8 and @xmath9 in m  51 are not so different from those in ngc  2903 .",
    "this is presumably due to the differences in assumed @xmath46(@xmath1co ) and [ @xmath1co]/[@xmath2co ] abundance ratio .",
    "the authors assumed @xmath46(@xmath1co ) of 8.0 @xmath53 , which is higher than that assumed in our study , and a lower [ @xmath1co]/[@xmath2co ] abundance ratio of 30 .",
    "under the lvg approximation with the assumption of @xmath46(@xmath1co ) of 8.0 @xmath53 , we found that the derived @xmath10 is typically @xmath163 times lower than that with assumption of @xmath46(@xmath1co ) of 1.0 @xmath53 .",
    "physically , high @xmath46(@xmath1co ) means abundant @xmath1co molecules among molecular gas . in this condition ,",
    "the optical depth of @xmath1co line also increases , and thus the photon - trapping effect in molecular clouds becomes effective . since this effect contributes the excitation of @xmath1co molecule , an effective critical density of @xmath1co line decreases .",
    "in other words , since the @xmath1co is easily excited to upper @xmath54 levels even in low molecular gas density , @xmath10 at a given @xmath8 decreases . as a result , lvg analysis with the assumption of @xmath46(@xmath1co ) of 8.0 @xmath53 yields lower @xmath10 .",
    "in addition , the low [ @xmath1co]/[@xmath2co ] abundance ratio of 30 causes the decrease in the derived molecular gas density as described above .",
    "therefore , the difference in the derived @xmath10 between ngc  2903 and m  51 can be explained by the difference in the assumed @xmath46(@xmath1co ) and the [ @xmath1co]/[@xmath2co ] abundance ratio .      as described in section 1 ,",
    "sfes often differ between galaxy centers and disks .",
    "since ngc  2903 has a bright star forming region at the center , its sfe is expected to be higher than those in other regions .",
    "here , we calculate sfes for seven regions where averaged physical properties of molecular gas are obtained , and compare sfe with @xmath10 and @xmath11 in each region to examine what parameter controls sfe in galaxies .",
    "sfe is expressed using the surface density of sfr ( @xmath55 ) and that of molecular hydrogen ( @xmath56 ) as follows : @xmath57= \\left ( \\frac{\\sigma_{\\rm sfr}}{m_{\\odot}\\,{\\rm yr^{-1}\\,pc^{-2 } } } \\right ) { \\displaystyle \\biggl/ } \\left ( \\frac{\\sigma_{\\rm h_2}}{m_{\\odot}\\,{\\rm pc^{-2 } } } \\right ) \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we calculated extinction - corrected sfrs from a linear combination of h@xmath23 and @xmath58/mips 24 @xmath59 luminosities using a following formula @xcite : @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 mean h@xmath23 and 24 @xmath59 luminosities , respectively .",
    "@xmath63 is the inclination of for ngc  2903 and @xmath64 is the covered area for each region ( in the unit of pc@xmath65 ) .",
    "we used archival continuum - subtracted h@xmath23 and 24 @xmath59 images of ngc  2903 obtained by @xcite and the local volume legacy survey project @xcite , respectively .",
    "in addition , we calculated @xmath56 using @xmath37 as follows : @xmath66 & = & 2.89 \\times { \\rm cos } \\",
    "i \\left ( \\frac{i_{\\rm 12co(1 - 0)}}{{\\rm k\\,\\,km\\,\\,s^{-1 } } } \\right ) \\times \\left\\ { \\frac{x_{\\rm co}}{1.8 \\times 10^{20}\\,{\\rm cm}^{-2}\\,({\\rm k\\,\\,km\\,\\,s^{-1}})^{-1 } } \\right\\ } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , we adopted a constant @xmath19 value of @xmath41 @xmath42 ( k km s@xmath26)@xmath26 @xcite .",
    "we found that sfe at the center , @xmath67 yr@xmath26 , is 2  4 times higher than those in other regions .",
    "calculated sfes are listed in table  3 .",
    "we examined the dependence of sfe on @xmath10 and @xmath11 as shown in figure  11 .",
    "we found that sfe positively correlates with both @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "however , the trend of these correlations might change because it is possible that variations in the [ @xmath1co]/[@xmath2co ] abundance ratio and @xmath19 affect the estimate of @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and sfe .",
    "in fact , both the [ @xmath1co]/[@xmath2co ] abundance ratio and @xmath19 often differ between galaxy centers and disks .",
    "therefore , we examine how variations in the [ @xmath1co]/[@xmath2co ] abundance ratio and @xmath19 alter the estimate of @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and sfe at the center of ngc  2903 .",
    "we first consider the effect of the variation in [ @xmath1co]/[@xmath2co ] abundance ratio on the estimate of @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "as described in section 4.2.1 , it is reported that the @xmath1c/@xmath2c abundance ratio in our galaxy increases with the galactocentric radius @xcite .",
    "thus we examine the case of the lower [ @xmath1co]/[@xmath2co ] abundance ratio at the center of ngc  2903 .",
    "if we adopt the [ @xmath1co]/[@xmath2co ] abundance ratio of 30 at the center , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are estimated to be 1800 @xmath13 and 38 k , respectively .",
    "this @xmath10 value is slightly lower than that in the northern arm , whereas the positive correlation between sfe and @xmath10 is not destroyed .",
    "similarly , the @xmath11 of 38 k does not destroy the positive correlation between sfe and @xmath11 .",
    "next , we consider the effect of the variation in @xmath19 on the estimate of sfe . in central regions of disk galaxies , @xmath19 drops ( i.e. , co emission becomes luminous at a given gas mass ) by a factor of 2  3 or more ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , including the galactic center ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "such a trend is presumably applicable to ngc  2903 considering the relationship between @xmath19 and metallicity , 12 + log(o / h ) .",
    "in general , @xmath19 decreases with the increase in metallicity because the co abundance should be proportional to the carbon and oxygen abundances ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , it is reported that metallicity decreases with the galactocentric distance in ngc  2903 ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these observational facts suggest a smaller @xmath19 by a factor of 1.5  2 at the center than in the disk of ngc  2903 , which yields a smaller gas mass , providing a higher sfe than the present one shown in table  3 and figure  11 .",
    "however , even if a higher sfe by a factor of 2 is adopted for the center , the global trend of the correlations shown in figure  11 does not change so much because the original sfe at the center is already the highest in ngc  2903 .",
    "therefore , we concluded that variations in the [ @xmath1co]/[@xmath2co ] abundance ratio and @xmath19 do @xmath68 affect the correlations of sfe with @xmath10 and @xmath11 in ngc  2903 .",
    "note that the smaller @xmath19 corresponds to the larger @xmath46(@xmath1co ) at the center of ngc  2903 , but the larger @xmath48 is also suggested because the typical velocity width at the center ( 250  300 km s@xmath26 ) is wider than those in other regions ( 150  200 km s@xmath26 ) due to the rapid rotation of molecular gas near the galaxy center .",
    "thus we consider that @xmath69co)/(@xmath48 ) itself does not differ between the center and the disk in ngc  2903 even if the @xmath69co ) at the center is larger than that in the disk .",
    "finally , we examine the correlation coefficient for the least - square power - law fit @xmath14 between sfe and @xmath10 and that between sfe and @xmath11 shown in figure  11 .",
    "we found that the former is 0.50 and the latter is 0.08 .",
    "the significant correlation between sfe and @xmath10 with @xmath14 of 0.50 suggests that molecular gas density governs the spatial variations in sfe .",
    "this speculation is well consistent with earlier studies based on hcn emission ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in order to confirm whether such a relationship between sfe and @xmath10 is applicable to other galaxies or not , we will perform further analysis toward other coming sample galaxies , considering variations in the [ @xmath1co]/[@xmath2co ] abundance ratio , @xmath19 , and @xmath69co)/(@xmath48 ) , in forthcoming papers .",
    "we have performed the simultaneous mappings of @xmath0 emission of @xmath1co , @xmath2co , and c@xmath3o molecules toward the whole disk ( @xmath4 or @xmath24 kpc at the distance of 8.9 mpc ) of the nearby barred spiral galaxy ngc  2903 with the nro 45-m telescope equipped with the forest at an effective angular resolution of @xmath6 ( or 870 pc ) .",
    "a summary of this work is as follows .    1 .   we detected @xmath1co(@xmath0 ) emission over the disk of ngc  2903 .",
    "in addition , significant @xmath2co(@xmath0 ) emission was found at the center and bar - ends , whereas we could not detect any significant c@xmath3o(@xmath0 ) emission .",

    "we successfully obtained the stacked co spectra with highly improved s / n , and thus we could confirm the significant @xmath2co(@xmath0 ) emission for all the regions .",
    "we examined the averaged @xmath8 and @xmath9 for nine regions , and found that the averaged @xmath8 shows the highest value of 0.92 at the center , and moderate or lower values of 0.6  0.8 are observed in the disk .",
