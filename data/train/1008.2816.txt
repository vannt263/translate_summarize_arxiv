    "anderson localization is one of the most fundamental and fascinating phenomena in the physics of disordered systems .",
    "predicted in the seminal paper of anderson  @xcite for spin excitations , and extended to the case of electrons and other one - particle excitations in solids ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) and also applied to classical waves  @xcite , this very general phenomenon has become a paradigm of modern physics @xcite . despite considerable efforts ,",
    "the theoretical framework of anderson localization in higher dimensions ( @xmath0 ) is far from complete @xcite , especially in the case of classical waves where the effects of absorption @xcite , gain @xcite , and polarization @xcite are significant .",
    "in contrast , the one - dimensional case ( @xmath1 has been studied extensively for both quantum mechanical and classical waves ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in the systems with short - range correlated disorder",
    ", it is known that all states are localized  @xcite .",
    "one of the main manifestations of localization is the exponential decay of the amplitude of a wave propagating through an infinite disordered sample .",
    "this decay is the result of the interference of multiply scattered waves , and its spatial rate is called the lyapunov exponent , @xmath2 , whose inverse value @xmath3 is a characteristic length describing localization in an infinite sample . by itself , however , the reciprocal of the lyapunov exponent does not provide comprehensive information about the transport properties of disordered media for all cases ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "moreover , it is unlikely that this quantity can be measured directly , at least in the optical regime .",
    "a further manifestation of localization is the exponential decay of the transmission coefficient of a long , finite sample .",
    "the characteristic length of this decay is the transmission length @xmath4 , also denoted by @xmath5 in the case of a sample of @xmath6 layers . in the localized regime , where this length is much smaller than the sample size , in general the transmission length coincides with the localization length @xmath7 , and also with the inverse lyapunov exponent @xmath3 .",
    "the anderson localization of classical waves in one - dimensional disordered systems has been studied in detail @xcite ) and it has been shown that in the long wave region where the interference is weak , the localization length demonstrates a universal behavior , growing in proportion to the square of the wavelength , i.e. , @xmath8 .    in recent years , we have witnessed the rapid emergence of a new field of research in metamaterials  artificial materials which exhibit a negative refractive index @xcite . in such materials , the wave vector @xmath9 , the electric field vector @xmath10 and the magnetic field vector @xmath11 form a left - handed ( _ lh _ ) coordinate system , in contrast to the right - handed system ( _ rh _ ) that is applicable to normal or regular materials ;",
    "for this reason , metamaterials are sometimes referred to as left - handed materials . in metamaterials ,",
    "the directions of the phase velocity and the energy flow are opposite .",
    "this feature can strongly affect anderson localization in metamaterials .",
    "indeed , in stratified media formed of alternating layers of normal materials and metamaterials , the phase accumulated during propagation through a right - handed layer diminishes in its propagation in a left - handed layer @xcite and , as a consequence , interference will be weakened and localization suppressed .",
    "already , one of the first study@xcite of anderson localization in the presence of metamaterials has revealed the striking behavior that , in the particular case of an alternating stack of right- and left - handed layers of the same thickness and randomly varying refractive indices , the localization is strongly suppressed .",
    "its functional form in the long - wave region changes from the standard behavior of @xmath12 to @xmath13 and , subsequently , it was shown  @xcite that in such stacks the localization length differs from the inverse of the lyapunov exponent  the first such example of this surprising behavior .",
    "while the disorder is one - dimensional , the random stacks are actually three - dimensional objects and so the vector nature of the propagating field and , in particular , its polarization can strongly influence localization , leading to its suppression or even complete delocalization .    for stacks comprising only normal layers ,",
    "the effects of polarization have been extensively studied .",
    "the problem has been studied using an approach based on stochastic differential equations@xcite , with excellent agreement obtained at short wavelengths ( for normal incidence ) , and also in the long wavelength limit , between the theoretically predicted localization length and that obtained by direct simulation .",
    "the delocalization associated with the brewster angle anomaly has been studied in the long wave limit using an effective medium approach @xcite , and at short wavelengths in the framework of a random phase approximation @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations for the off - axis case are given in ref .",
    "@xcite while , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the polarization properties of localization have been considered experimentally .",
    "although the approaches described in refs @xcite give rich information about the effects of polarization on the properties of localization in normal materials , a general expression for the localization length , applicable for broad range of input parameters ( including at the brewster anomaly angle ) is still missing .",
    "furthermore , there are no results available for the effects of polarization on localization in the presence of metamaterials .    in this paper ,",
    "we extend our earlier study  @xcite to the case of off - axis incidence and provide a comprehensive analytical and numerical treatment of the effects of polarization on the localization length @xmath7 .",
    "we consider both homogeneous stacks , formed by only normal material layers or by only metamaterial layers , and also mixed stacks formed by an alternating sequence of right- and left - handed layers with random thicknesses and refractive indices .",
    "we derive explicit asymptotic expressions for the localization length at the short and long wavelength limits that are applicable for the brewster angle , and demonstrate their excellent agreement with direct simulation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : theor ] , we describe the model and outline the theoretical treatment . the derivation of the asymptotic forms for the localization length at short and long wavelengths is presented in sec .",
    "[ asymp ] . in sec .",
    "[ numerics ] , we present the results of numerical simulations for the localization length for _ s_- and _ p_- polarizations in both homogeneous and mixed stacks . here , we adopt the conventional definition for polarization , with _",
    "s_- and _ p_-polarization referring respectively to the cases in which the electric and magnetic fields are perpendicular to the plane of incidence . finally , in sec .",
    "[ theta ] , the dependence of the localization length on the angle of incidence , at a fixed wavelength , is considered .",
    "we consider the transmission and localization properties of a one - dimensional , multi - layered , disordered stack which consists of @xmath6 layers composed of either right - handed or normal ( @xmath14 ) materials , left - handed ( @xmath7 ) metamaterials , or mixed stacks comprising alternating layers ( @xmath14 and @xmath7 ) of each ( see fig .",
    "[ geom ] ) .",
    "all layers are statistically independent and , in the most general case , the thickness of each layer , and its dielectric and magnetic permittivities , are random quantities with given probability densities .",
    "all lengths in the problem are measured in the unit of the mean layer thickness and , therefore , are dimensionless quantities .",
    "the main subject of our interest is the transmission length @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the transmission coefficient of the @xmath6 layer stack for a plane wave with a given incidence angle ( relative to the surface normal of the stack ) .",
    "angular brackets are used to denote averaging over realizations of all random parameters . in the limit of a stack of infinite length ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath17 , the transmission length coincides with the localization length , i.e. , @xmath18    the calculation of the transmission length ( [ tl ] ) requires the transmission coefficient @xmath16 of the @xmath6-layer stack for a wave of a given polarization and a given incidence angle .",
    "such a calculation can be based on the transfer matrix method @xcite , the interface iteration method @xcite , and the layer iteration method @xcite .",
    "we choose the last of these and build on the treatment that was used successfully in our previous study @xcite for the case of normal incidence .",
    "the method is based on the _ exact _ iteration of the recurrence relations @xmath19 for the total transmission @xmath20 and total reflection @xmath21 coefficients of a @xmath22-layer stack , @xmath23 , in which both the input and output media are free space , and with initial conditions set to @xmath24 and @xmath25 . here",
    "@xmath26 and @xmath27 are the transmission and reflection coefficients of the @xmath28 layer , with layers being enumerated from @xmath29 at the rear of the stack through to @xmath30 at the front .",
    "such an approach is quite general and is applicable to an arbitrary choice of polarization ( _ s _ ) or ( _ p _ ) , the angle of incidence @xmath31 , the type of layer ( @xmath14 or @xmath7 ) , the wavelength @xmath32 , and the amount of absorption or gain .",
    "all these input data are incorporated into the transmission and reflection characteristics @xmath26 and @xmath27 of a single layer .    the recurrence relations ( [ rect ] ) and ( [ rec ] ) , together with the definitions ( [ tl ] ) and ( [ ll ] ) enable the numerical calculation of the transmission length @xmath5 in the most general case .",
    "if the calculated transmission length @xmath5 is much smaller than the stack length @xmath6 , and is independent of @xmath6 , then @xmath5 may be identified as the localization length , i.e. , @xmath33 .    in the work reported in this paper",
    ", we deal with a specific model in which the dimensionless thicknesses @xmath34 of each layer are independent , identically distributed , random variables , @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is uniformly distributed in the range @xmath37 $ ] with @xmath38 the dielectric and magnetic permittivities of the layers are represented in the form @xmath39 where the upper and lower signs respectively correspond to a normal material or a metamaterial .",
    "the random part @xmath40 of the refractive index , @xmath41 is uniformly distributed in the range @xmath42 $ ] , @xmath43 accordingly , the model takes into account both refractive index disorder and layer thickness disorder .",
    "our theoretical treatment is based on a weak scattering approximation ( wsa ) in which the magnitude of the reflection coefficient of each layer @xmath44 is the primary small parameter in the theory .",
    "to understand when this condition is valid and may be used , we next consider explicit expressions for the reflection @xmath14 and transmission @xmath45 coefficients of any single layer : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is fresnel interface reflection coefficient given by @xmath48 in these equations , @xmath49 @xmath32 is the dimensionless free space wavelength , and @xmath50 is the layer impedance relative to the background ( free space ) .",
    "there are two cases in which the magnitude of the single layer reflection coefficient is small , i.e. , @xmath51 .",
    "the first is characterized by weak refractive index disorder @xmath52 and corresponds to the incidence angle @xmath31 being smaller than its critical value @xmath53 in this case it is the small magnitude of the fresnel reflection coefficient @xmath54 which leads to a small , single layer reflection coefficient ( @xmath51 ) at all wavelengths .",
    "the second case corresponds to the long wavelength limit ( @xmath55 ) in which the single layer reflection coefficient is small ( @xmath51 ) for an arbitrary incidence angle @xmath31 due to the asymptotically small value of the multiplier @xmath56 which appears in the expression for @xmath14 in eq .",

    "what follows , we summarize the key theoretical results @xcite applicable to mixed and homogeneous stacks",
    ".      a mixed stack , which hereafter is abbreviated by m - stack , is composed of alternating layers of right - handed ( @xmath14 ) and left - handed ( @xmath7 ) materials ( see fig .",

    ", there are simple relations that may be derived @xcite between the averaged values of an analytic function @xmath59 of the transmission and reflection characteristics of single layers of left- and right - handed materials , @xmath60    as a consequence , the transmission length of a m - stack depends only on the properties of a single right - handed layer and is expressible in terms of only three averaged quantities : @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 , in which the subscript @xmath14 ( referring to a right - handed layer ) has been omitted : @xmath64 here , @xmath65is the inverse localization length , @xmath66is the inverse ballistic length , and @xmath67    to characterize the transition from localization to ballistic propagation , we introduce the _ crossover length _ for a m - stack @xcite , @xmath68 and two characteristic wavelengths @xmath69 and @xmath70 defined by @xmath71 for long wavelengths , that part of the spectrum for which @xmath72 corresponds to the localization regime , for which @xmath33 . in turn , the wavelength range @xmath73 corresponds to ballistic propagation and @xmath74 .",
    "the region @xmath75 is the transition region from localization to ballistic propagation . in what follows",
    ", we characterize these regions with long wavelength asymptotes for the localization length @xmath7 and the crossover length @xmath76",
    ".      the homogeneous stack ( abbreviated from here as a h - stack ) is composed of layers of the same type of material ( either @xmath14 or @xmath7 ) . by virtue of the symmetry relations ( [ symmetry ] ) , the results for statistically equivalent stacks of either normal materials or metamaterials are identical .",

    "( [ finaln1 ] ) that the crossover length @xmath79 of the h - stack is @xmath80 characterizing the transition from the near ballistic regime to the far ballistic regime of propagation .",
    "the results ( [ prb1 ] ) - ( [ prb3 ] ) , ( [ finaln1 ] ) , ( [ finaln2 ] ) for the transmission , localization and ballistic lengths of homogeneous and mixed stacks are quite general . in this section",
    "we apply them to the specific model described in subsection [ subsec : model ] .",
    "we emphasize that within the model both two types of disorder are present and are taken into account in all intermediate calculations .",
    "however , in all final results we keep only the leading terms .",
    "the higher order corrections with respect to the relative perturbations @xmath81 of the refractive index and thickness distributions are generally omitted .",
    "when the incidence angle @xmath31 is smaller than the critical angle @xmath82 ( [ theta - c ] ) , the short wavelength asymptotics of the localization length can be easily obtained from eqs ( [ prb2 ] ) and ( [ finaln2 ] ) . at short wavelengths ,",
    "the phase of the field is a strongly fluctuating , random quantity so that @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85",

    "if the incidence angle @xmath31 exceeds the critical angle @xmath82 ( [ theta - c ] ) , then total internal reflection occurs ( i.e. , the magnitude of the fresnel reflection coefficient becomes unity ) and so the wsa fails in the short wave region . if the incident angle is sufficiently far above the critical value @xmath82 , then the exponent @xmath92 in eq .",
    "( [ t ] ) is real and negative and thus the magnitude of the single layer transmission coefficient is exponentially small . as a result ,",
    "we obtain the following expression for the transmission length @xmath93 the right hand side of this equation is independent of the stack length @xmath6 and so it formally coincides with the inverse localization length @xmath7 . however , its origin is related to attenuation by tunneling , rather than to anderson localization . in the attenuation regime",
