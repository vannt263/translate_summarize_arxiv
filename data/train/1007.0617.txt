    "nrqcd@xcite has now become a basic theory to parameterize non - perturbative contributions represented by color - singlet(cs ) and color - octet(co ) matrix elements in heavy quarkonium production and decays .",
    "the color - octet mechanism supplies a way to partly understand the prompt @xmath2 and @xmath3 surplus production at the fermilab tevatron @xcite .",
    "however , there are still something unclear in this scheme@xcite .",
    "to investigate charmonium production mechanism has become an urgent and important task in the study of quarkonium physics .",
    "@xmath2 pair production process could be a candidate for testing and verifying color - octet scheme .",
    "this process has an exclusive multi - muon final state with extremely small backgrounds . but",
    "according to the result of previous unpolarized calculations@xcite for tevatron experiment , the cross - section of this process at tevatron is very small , and tevatron experiment also has not supplied a solid evidence for having detected it .",
    "the running of the lhc provides a great opportunity to realize this aim . with high center - of - mass energy of 14 tev and luminosity of about @xmath4",
    ", results from the lhc experiment may be able to answer how much color - octet mechanism contributes to @xmath2 production under high collision energy . with regard to the calculations of qiao _ et al _ @xcite and li _ et al _ @xcite , the @xmath2 pair production process at lhc could study charmonium production mechanisms . but",
    "firstly , we must perform monte carlo simulation on this process to research its experimental feasibility .",
    "thus , we developed a generator package on this process based on feynman diagram calculation ( fdc ) system@xcite .",
    "the generator contains only primary leading order @xmath0 channels , and we neglected those channels such as @xmath5 which contribute much less to than @xmath0 processes .",
    "the output of the generator is a standard les houches event file@xcite , and could be embedded to the detector simulation software framework .",
    "the transverse momentum ( pt ) distributions of muons from @xmath2 generated in color - singlet and color - octet schemes are shown here .",
    "in large pt region ( pt @xmath6 10 gev ) , the muons from @xmath2 generated in color - octet scheme are more than those from @xmath2 generated in color - singlet scheme .",
    "that means significant more @xmath2 in color - octet scheme could be reconstructed in large pt region .",
    "if more @xmath2 events were detected in large pt region , then it could be considered that color - octet scheme contributes significantly to the cross - section of the process .",
    "if the cross - section was measured , the contribution of color - octet scheme could also be determined .     in color - singlet and color - octet schemes generated by djpsifdc package.,width=377,height=302 ]",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , the directory structures of the event generator package are described . in section 3 , we describe the details of the installation and implementation of djpsifdc package .",
    "sections 4 describes the format of the output files .",
    "the summary is presented in section 5 .",
    "there are five sub - directories in the directory .",
    "they are ` basesv5.1 ` , ` djpsi - generator ` , ` f77 ` , ` gg2jpsi ` and ` octet\\_gg2jpsi ` . the directory ` basev5.1 ` stores ` bases ` libraries used for monte - carlo calculation of the cross - section integral .",
    "the directory ` f77 ` are the common - shared computational tools for physics quantities , such as @xmath7 , etc , and the directory ` djpsi - generator ` contains the @xmath2 pair production information .    `",
    "gg2jpsi ` and ` octet\\_gg2jpsi ` are two directories containing color - singlet and color - octet parts of @xmath2 pair production process respectively .",
    "all the compiled executable programs and the input files are stored in these two directories . in the following",
    ", the two parts would be described sequentially .",
    "pair production in @xmath8 collision at leading order in color - singlet scheme.,width=377,height=302 ]    in color - singlet part , we restrict simulation objects merely to the gluon - gluon fusion one , as shown in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "in fact , @xmath2 pair production process in color - singlet scheme includes @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "since @xmath11 processes contribute much less , we did not consider this part s contribution .      in the color - octet scheme ,",
    "the final objects produced in hard parton interaction are not @xmath2s , but color - octet bound states , as shown in figure [ fig4 ] . here",
    "we comply with the convention in pythia system , considering this color - octet bound state as a new particle , and assuming its invariant mass is 30mev larger than @xmath2 , which is 3.126gev .",
    "the color - octet bound state would radiate a soft gluon , and decay to a real @xmath2 .",
    "it is worth noting that the @xmath2 pair hybrid production scheme , i.e. , one @xmath2 in a pair is produced though cs scheme but the other is via co scheme , is neglected in the calculation since its contribution is comparatively very small .",
    "the generator is compressed in a file named ` djpsifdc.taz ` and users could download it from :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ http://cid-4fc4170d6530982b.office.live.com/browse.aspx/.public _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    installation and implementation procedures are described respectively below .      the installation steps are given below and for convenience we assume that :    * the current user account is ` user ` ; * the current directory is ` /home / user ` ; * it is assumed that the user use ` csh ` ; if not , the user should execute ` chsh useraccount or ypchsh useraccount ` to change the shell class to cshell ; * user has installed cern library and cern library should be cern2001 .",
    "for the installation , user first need to decompress the downloaded gzip file by typing the following command .",
    "+ ` tar -xzvf djpsifdc.taz ` + then home directory `` djpsifdc '' is generated .",
    "secondly , get into it by `` cd djpsifdc '' and set the correct path of cern library in env.csh,then execute : + ` source env.csh and installlib ` . + it will do the installation .    note : users must firstly modify the path and cern library location in `` env.csh '' into their local paths , then execute `` source env.csh '' so as to establish the environment smoothly .      to implement the generator",
    ", user firstly needs to establish links to program library .",
    "after entered home directory of generator , user could execute ` source env.csh and installlib ` to realize it and this is a necessary procedure for the next operations .",
    "then user must enter color - singlet part or color - octet part by executing `` cd gg2jpsi / fort '' or `` cd octet@xmath12gg2jpsi / fort '' .",
    "take color - singlet part as the example .",
    "after changed current directory to gg2jpsi / fort , execute program ` make ` , then three executable programs would appear .",
    "they are :    [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     users only need to execute the executable programs to get generate events and get output files , but user must call ` int ` ahead to ` fdcpythia ` .",
    "there are two input - files for users to change input parameters : ` input.dat ` and ` parameter.input ` .",
    "` input.dat ` stores center - of - mass energy , and user could generate events under different collision energy by changing it . in ` parameter.input ` , user could configure initial parameters such as event number to generate , etc .",
    "the format of ` parameter.input ` is described as : each parameter occupies one line ; in each line , the parameter name and value are separated by a equal sign ( i.e. `` = '' ) like :    ....      parameter = value ; ....    the line which begins with a number sign ( i.e.  # \" ) is recognized as the comment .",
    "all parameters used by djpsifdc in ` parameter.input ` are listed with brief explanation as :    : to specify the running level .",
    "it needs not to be cared here .    : to specify the number of the generated events .    :",
    "the number of the generated parton - level events .",
    "it must be at least twice to evntnum .    :",
    "the number of generated hadronic events in the last run .",

    ", we only use the ` re - generation ` mode ( ` = 1 ` ) , since all the generated events are erased , and new parton - level events and hadronic events are generated .",
    "it should be noted that after changing collision energy in ` input.dat ` , user must re - execute ` int ` to calculate cross - section under new energy , or the generator would generate events under original collision energy .",
