    "the realization of strong photon correlations at the few - photon level has become an interesting and important research topic in quantum optics  @xcite .",
    "the significance of this subject is mainly motivated by the considerable applications of correlated photons to the foundations of quantum theory as well as in quantum information science .",
    "so far , much effort has been devoted to the creation of correlated photons in various physical systems such as cavity - qed  @xcite and kerr - type nonlinear cavities  @xcite .",

    "however , the photon blockade in _ quadratically _ coupled optomechanical systems has not been studied .    in a conventional photon blockade , it is believed that the optical nonlinearity in the eigenenergy spectrum is the key element for obtaining the photon correlation . for example , in the jaynes - cummings ( jc ) system and the kerr - type nonlinear cavity , the optical nonlinearity takes the form @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the parameters of the jc system , @xmath4 is the kerr parameter , and @xmath5 is the photon number . in quadratically coupled optomechanical systems , there is an optical nonlinearity of type @xmath6 [ @xmath7 and @xmath8 , cf .",

    "when the single - photon optomechanical coupling is strong enough , the optical nonlinearity could be used to create photon correlations .",
    "inspired by this feature , in this paper we study the photon blockade in a _ quadratically _ coupled optomechanical cavity .",
    "concretely , we analytically and numerically study the steady - state photon statistics of the quadratic optomechanical cavity . by examining the second - order correlation function",
    ", we clarify the photon blockade in this system by answering the following three questions :    \\(1 ) what is the inherent parameter condition for observing a photon blockade in the system ?",
    "\\(2 ) how does one control the driving field to achieve a strong photon blockade ?",
    "\\(3 ) how does the mechanical thermal noise affect the photon blockade ?",
    "specifically , we consider a quadratically coupled optomechanical system with a  membrane - in - the - middle \" configuration [ see fig .  [ setup](a ) ]  @xcite . in this setup ,",

    "to investigate the photon blockade , we analytically and numerically examine the second - order correlation function of the cavity photons .      in this section ,",
    "we analytically calculate the second - order correlation function of the cavity photons by treating the weak - driving term in hamiltonian  ( [ rotatingreph ] ) as a perturbation . for simplicity , we phenomenologically add an anti - hermitian term to hamiltonian  ( [ rotatingreph ] ) to describe the dissipation of the cavity photons .",
    "the effective non - hermitian hamiltonian takes the form @xmath37 here we only consider the dissipation of the cavity field and neglect the membrane s dissipation .",
    "this approximation is justified in the time scale @xmath38 ( where @xmath39 is the rate of mechanical dissipation ) because @xmath40 . in our numerical results ,",
    "the mechanical dissipation is taken into account .    in the weak - driving regime , @xmath41 ,",
    "the photon number is small , so we can work within the few - photon subspace spanned by the basis states @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 .",

    "( [ gensolution ] ) .",
    "figure  [ g2vsdelta_c ] shows that there is no photon blockade ( @xmath105 ) for @xmath106 .",
    "when @xmath107 , the photon statistics transits between super - poissonian ( @xmath108 ) and sub - poissonian ( @xmath109 ) distributions with the change of @xmath82 .",

    ", a single photon can be resonantly excited into the cavity , while the probability for finding two photons in the cavity is largely suppressed due to the energy restriction ; this represents a photon blockade ( @xmath110 , i.e. , a dip ) . in the two - photon resonant driving case ,",
    "the probability for two photons inside the cavity is resonantly enhanced , and this corresponds to a peak in the correlation function @xmath70 .",

[ fig3 ] , the correlation function @xmath70 as a function of @xmath103 and @xmath7 under the single - photon resonant driving conditions : ( a ) @xmath83 and ( b ) @xmath122 .",

    "[ fig3 ] :    \\(i ) the curves @xmath123 provide a boundary for different photon distributions : super - poissonian and sub - poissonian .",
    "we see that the @xmath110 appears in the region @xmath107 .",
    "when @xmath109 , the @xmath70 decreases with increasing @xmath7 .",
    "this means that the photon blockade grows when increasing the quadratic coupling strength .",
    "this result is different from the linear optomechanical coupling case  @xcite in which the correlation function exhibits an oscillating feature due to the modulation of the phonon sidebands . in the present case ,",
    "when the single - photon process is resonant , the phonon sidebands will not be resonant in the dominating two - photon transitions  @xcite .",
    "\\(ii ) in the region @xmath124 , the value of @xmath70 could be smaller than @xmath125 for a large coupling strength @xmath7 .",
    "this phenomenon is also different from the linear optomechanical coupling case , in which the correlation function @xmath109 appears only in the resolved sideband regime @xmath126 .",
    "we can explain this from the fact that , though the usual resolved - sideband condition @xmath127 does not satisfy , the two - photon coupled phonon states @xmath128 can be still resolved in the region @xmath129 because of @xmath130 .",
    "\\(iii ) in the single - photon resonant driving cases , the correlation function @xmath70 for the case of @xmath122 is much smaller than that for the case of @xmath83 .",
    "this phenomenon can be understood based on the photon probabilities in the cavity . as an example",
    ", we consider the parameters in fig .",
    "[ g2vsdelta_c](c ) . in the weak - driving case ,",
    "the correlation function can be approximately expressed as @xmath65 . when the driving detuning changes from @xmath83 to @xmath122 , the single - photon probability decreases by one order of magnitude , but the two - photon probability decreases by three orders of magnitude .",
    "consequently , the driving of @xmath122 will induce a stronger photon blockade than the case of @xmath83 .",
    "based on the above analysis , we now answer the questions ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) proposed in the introduction : ( i ) for observing the photon blockade ( @xmath110 ) , the system should work in the deep - resolved - sideband regime @xmath131 and the single - photon strong - coupling regime @xmath107 .",
    "( ii ) the single - photon phonon - sideband resonant driving @xmath122 is helpful to induce a strong photon blockade .    to answer question",
    "( 3 ) , we investigate the influence of the mechanical thermal phonon number @xmath104 on the correlation function , as shown in fig .",
    "[ g2vsg_and_nth ] . in the single - photon resonant driving cases ,",
    "the value of @xmath70 increases when increasing @xmath104 .",
    "this means that the photon blockade is limited by the thermal noise of the mechanical environment . to maintain the photon blockade",
    ", the mechanical thermal noise needs to be suppressed .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied the steady - state photon statistics of a quadratically - coupled optomechanical cavity , which is weakly driven by a monochromatic laser field .",
    "we have obtained the approximate analytical expression of the second - order correlation function for the cavity photons by treating the driving term as a perturbation .",
    "we numerically solved the quantum master equation including both optical and mechanical dissipations .",
    "we found that the photon blockade can be induced by the quadratic optomechanical coupling under the single - photon resonant driving condition .",
    "in particular , the phonon sideband resonant driving @xmath122 could enhance the phonon blockade . to observe the photon blockade ,",
    "the system should work in both the deep - resolved - sideband regime and the single - photon strong - coupling regime .",
    "we have also found that the generated photon blockade effect is limited by the thermal noise from the mechanical environment .    finally , we present some remarks on the experimental feasibility for observing a photon blockade induced by the quadratic optomechanical couplings . currently , the resolved - sideband regime ( @xmath132 ) is accessible in some experimental systems .",
