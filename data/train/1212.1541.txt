    "the abundances and radial velocity galactic origins survey ( argos ) is a large spectroscopic survey of about 28,000 stars in the galactic bulge and surrounding disk , using the aaomega fibre spectrometer on the anglo - australian telescope . with this survey",
    ", we aim to investigate the metallicities , kinematics and density distributions of the stars in the inner region and use this information to understand the bulge .",
    "near - infrared images of the galactic bulge ( e.g. the cobe / dirbe images ) show its peanut / boxy structure .",
    "peanut / boxy bulges are widely believed to be generated via bar - forming and bar - buckling instabilities of the disk , and the main motivation of this survey is to understand how the galactic bulge formed .",
    "did it form primarily through disk instability or did mergers play a significant role in its formation ?",
    "several authors ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have made n - body simulations of peanut / boxy bulge formation through bar - forming and bar - buckling instability of the disk .",
    "one of the goals of the argos survey is to see whether the existing n - body models provide a good representation of the bulge properties , in terms of the observed kinematics and peanut / boxy structure .",
    "the argos data provide 3d positions and radial velocities for the stars , and also their [ fe / h ] and [ @xmath2/fe ] abundances",
    ". the combination of positional , kinematical and chemical data will be useful for testing future models of bulge formation that include chemical evolution .",
    "a generic prediction of the n - body models is that instability - generated bulges are expected to show cylindrical rotation , unlike the rotation field predicted for the more spheroidal classical bulges .",
    "the prediction of cylindrical rotation for the boxy bar / bulge is easily checked from radial velocity surveys of the bulge , and has already been confirmed by the brava group @xcite .",
    "testing for the presence of a classical component of the bulge is more difficult .",
    "@xcite showed that a small classical bulge in the presence of a boxy bar / bulge would itself be spun up into cylindrical rotation and would therefore lose its distinct kinematical signature .",
    "recently , a split red clump in the galactic bulge has been discovered ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the split is seen as a bimodal magnitude distribution of the red clump stars at higher latitudes near the minor axis of the bulge , and is associated with the boxy / peanut structure of the bulge . in projection ,",
    "the boxy / peanut bulge shows an underlying x - structure .",
    "our data are well suited to investigating the stellar populations present in the x - structure .",
    "the first paper of this series is on the x - structure observed in the bulge @xcite , and showed that this characteristic structure of the bulge is defined by stars with metallicities [ fe / h ] @xmath3 .",
    "the more metal - poor stars do not appear to show the split red clump and are therefore probably not involved in the boxy / peanut structure .    if the galactic bulge formed from instability of the inner disk many gyr ago , then the bulge would be made up mainly of early thin and thick disk stars that have been trapped within the bulge structure .",
    "these stars would present as a fossil of the early inner galaxy , and we could expect to see evidence of these trapped early components in the metallicity distribution and kinematics of the bulge",
    ". the relative contributions of the early components are likely to vary across the bulge , and this variation may give insight into the mapping of the early disk into the bulge via the instability .",
    "we therefore chose to survey stars in the bulge and also in the surrounding thin and thick disk , to see whether the metallicity distribution across the inner regions of the galaxy is consistent with the instability picture . in this context , the galactic bulge appears to show a vertical abundance gradient ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) which could be interpreted as evidence for a dissipative formation .",
    "it is of interest to investigate this abundance gradient in more detail .",
    "futhermore , the [ @xmath2/fe ] properties of the bulge have been much discussed ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with indications from some authors that even the most metal - rich stars in the bulge are @xmath4enhanced .",
    "@xcite also find evidence for enhanced [ @xmath2/fe ] in a limited sample of inner disk giants ( typically @xmath5 1 kpc above the plane ) .",
    "the [ @xmath2/fe ] ratios for stars in the inner galaxy are an important diagnostic of the rate of star formation in this region .",
    "we therefore wanted to measure the [ @xmath2/fe ] ratios for the large sample of argos bulge stars .",
    "there is a possibility that the first stars are concentrated to the inner regions of the galaxy , as indicated in cosmological simulations ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these stars are of great interest for understanding the early chemical evolution of the galactic environment .",
    "the selection criteria for the survey have been defined to ensure we did not exclude such metal - poor giants .",
    "along lines of sight passing through the inner region of the galaxy are stars from all the major galactic components : thin and thick disk , bulge and stellar halo .",
    "some of these are likely to be involved in the peanut / boxy bulge structure and some are not .",
    "contamination by foreground and background disk stars is an issue for surveys of stars in the galactic bulge .",
    "galactic models like galaxia @xcite show that samples of red giants in the direction of the bulge can include significant fractions of stars of the thin and thick disk lying in front of and behind the bulge .",
    "stars of the inner disk are of interest for understanding how the bulge relates to its environment , particularly if it did form via disk instability",
    ". for specific studies of metallicities and kinematics in the bulge , however , we want to choose stars such as red clump giants for which accurate ( @xmath6% ) distances can be estimated . with these distances",
    ", we can then determine which stars lie within the bulge and identify the stars which are in the foreground and background and derive a relatively uncontaminated picture of the distribution of kinematics and chemical properties throughout the bulge .",
    "for example , with the selection criteria described below , designed to select mainly red clump giants along sight lines through the bulge , we found that about 2,500 of our 28,000 stars are foreground dwarfs and about 14,000 stars lie within the bulge region ( galactocentric cylindrical radius @xmath7 kpc ) .",
    "the remaining 11,500 stars are in the foreground or background and outside the inner region .",
    "the overall outcome of the survey is that the bulge appears to be consistent with formation via bar forming and bar buckling instability of the early disk .",
    "the dominant component of the peanut / boxy bulge is the early old thin disk , with a clear contribution from its more metal - rich and kinematically colder component , similar to the younger , more metal - rich and colder component seen in the thin disk near the sun at the present time ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the first paper of this series @xcite showed that the peanut / boxy structure of the bulge is defined by stars with metallicities [ fe / h ] @xmath3 , and its structure and kinematics are well represented by n - body models of bulge formation via disk instability .",
    "this paper , argos ii , deals with the observational methods and strategy for the argos survey .",
    "paper iii will present the components of the metallicity distribution for the bulge , and paper iv presents the kinematics of its sub - populations .",
    "paper v will discuss the mapping of the early disk into the bulge by the instability .",
    "in this section , we describe the selection criteria for the stars , and provide details of the aaomega observations .",
    "our goal is to select red giants in a grid of fields over the bulge and inner disk , with an apparent magnitude and colour range that includes clump giant stars all along the line of sight through the bulge , from the near side to the far side , and surrounding inner disk .",
    "the distance range is about @xmath8 to @xmath9 kpc from the sun ( see figure [ fig : cartoon3 ] ) .",
    "we also wish to include metal - poor giants in the inner galaxy , as described above , because of their interest as possible first stars . with the above goals and criteria in mind , we minimise the numbers of the brightest and coolest giants for which abundances are difficult to measure reliably from optical spectra .",
    "foreground bluer main sequence stars should be excluded without excluding metal - poor giants along the line of sight .      in order to complete the survey in a realistic time",
    ", we used the sparse sampling shown in figure [ fig : donefields ] .",
    "this grid of field centers covers the southern bulge between @xmath10 to @xmath1 , extending out in longitude into the surrounding thin disk and thick disk . for the stars in the bulge region , we choose field centres at latitudes @xmath11 , because the mean reddening increases rapidly closer to the galactic plane .",
    "the field centres also include two low - latitude fields in the disk at larger longitudes in windows of low reddening , and three relatively low extinction fields in the northern bulge for comparison with the southern fields as a check on north - south symmetry .",
    "about 1000 stars were observed in each field .",
    "stars were selected from the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) catalogue @xcite over the magnitude range k = 11.5 to 14.0 , with j , k errors @xmath12 , and flags set to reduce blends , contamination , stars of lower photometric quality and non - stellar objects ( qflg = aaa , bflg=111 , cflg=000 , xflg=0 , aflg=0 ) .     fields in our survey .",
    "the rectangle shows the approximate extent of the boxy bulge .",
    "the filled circles are fields for which about @xmath13 stars were observed .",
    "the open circle is our one incompletely observed field ( @xmath14 600 stars).,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    the red clump giants have a well - defined absolute magnitude distribution , with a mean @xmath15 = 1.61 @xmath16 0.03 @xcite and a standard deviation of @xmath17 mag .",
    "this allows a relatively accurate estimate of their distances ( standard error about @xmath18 kpc at a distance of @xmath19 kpc ) .",
    "the clump giants lie in the plume near @xmath20 in figure [ fig : singlefield ] . with the range of apparent magnitudes selected for our survey ,",
    "the clump stars are distributed over the whole line of sight through the bulge ( figure [ fig : cartoon3 ] ) .",
    "some intrinsically brighter / fainter giants on the far / near side of the bulge are included in the sample , although the magnitude cut at @xmath21 excludes most of the brighter and cooler giants for which it is more difficult to measure abundances .",
    "a blue colour cut was made to exclude the plume of bluer foreground stars seen in figure [ fig : singlefield ] .",
    "the colour of this cut is at @xmath22 = 0.38 so depends on the mean reddening in the field .",
    "the stars in the sample are then mainly clump giants , plus a contribution from brighter and fainter giants and some metal - poor giants which come mainly from the inner regions of the metal - poor halo of the galaxy .",
    "we can expect some contamination from nearby g and k dwarfs , but they can be easily removed using their inferred stellar parameters .    .",
    "the red giant clump at the distance of the galactic centre is near @xmath23 .",
    "the broken lines show the region from which our stars are selected .",
    "this region includes mainly red clump giants along the line of sight through the bulge , plus some brighter and fainter giants lying mostly on the far and near side of the bulge respectively .",
    "the plume of foreground disk stars to the left of the cmd is excluded by the colour cut in @xmath22 but metal - poor giants ( i.e. [ fe / h ] @xmath24 2.0 ) are included as shown.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the stellar parameters are derived from our primary wavelength region around the ca - triplet .",
    "the highest spectral resolution available with the aaomega system @xcite at the ca - triplet region ( r = 11,000 ) is well suited to our goals : it provides accurate radial velocities and abundances for a few individual elements including [ fe / h ] and @xmath2-elements ( see figure [ fig : spectrastar ] ) .",
    "the stars are sufficiently bright to observe in bright time .      the mean @xcite reddening for each argos field was adopted to make the blue cut .",
    "the reddening ranges from @xmath26 to @xmath27 in the @xmath28 fields , @xmath29 to @xmath30 at @xmath31 , @xmath30 to @xmath32 at @xmath10 and @xmath29 to @xmath33 in the northern fields and disk well away from the bulge .",
    "most of our stars lie at @xmath34-heights above @xmath35 pc , so the @xcite reddening is likely to be a realistic estimate .",
    "we have used the @xcite reddening throughout this study , which was completed before the @xcite reddening map for the bulge became available .",
    "the @xcite reddening in our field at @xmath36 is about @xmath37 lower in @xmath38 than the @xcite reddening .",
    "the observed colour of the low density region in the cmd at @xmath39 , where the foreground star plume and the clump star sequence meet , provides a check on the mean reddening in the field . in all fields ,",
    "its colour was consistent with the @xcite reddening .",
    "the blue cut is sufficiently blue such that metal - poor giants in the field are not excluded .    towards the faint end of the selection interval in @xmath40-magnitude ,",
    "the 2mass catalog in the bulge fields becomes rapidly incomplete .",
    "we wanted to have clump stars all along the line of sight through the bulge , so chose roughly equal numbers of stars per unit magnitude in each field .",
    "it was also desirable to have a relatively small magnitude range for each fibre setup to reduce the effects of fibre - to - fibre scattering . because the ca - triplet region is close to the photometric @xmath41-band , we estimated the i - magnitude for each star from its @xmath42 photometry , using the transformation @xmath43 , derived from @xcite and adopting the ratios @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 = 0.601 and reddening values @xcite taken from the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) .",
    "each field typically had many thousands of stars satisfying the selection criteria in figure [ fig : singlefield ] .",
    "the spectra were acquired with the fibre - fed aaomega system on the anglo - australian telescope in may - august of 2008 to 2011 .",
    "aaomega is a dual - beam spectrometer with about 400 fibres that can be positioned within a @xmath47degree diameter field .",
    "with aaomega ( allowing for broken fibres ) , we can observe about 350 stars at once , plus 25 sky positions and guide fibres .",
    "the red beam provides our primary spectral region , using the 1700d grating with a resolution of about 11,000 in the ca - triplet region @xmath48 .",
    "this region is relatively free from telluric lines and contains spectral lines of fe i , ti i , ca ii , al i , mg i , si i and o i for abundance measurements : see figure [ fig : spectrastar ] . of the optical regions of the spectrum that we could have chosen for this project , the ca - triplet region",
    "is least affected by moonlight and it was possible to conduct the program during bright lunar phase . on the other hand , the region is not ideally suited to estimating the spectroscopic stellar surface gravities which are needed to determine which stars are clump giants and to estimate the distances for red giants that are not on the clump . the typical signal to noise ratio ( s / n ) for our ca - triplet spectra is about @xmath49 per resolution element .",
    "the blue beam was used to acquire low resolution spectra ( r @xmath14 3000 ) with the 1500v grating in the region @xmath50 .",
    "the main purpose of these low resolution spectra is to reject foreground dwarf stars from our sample of more distant giants , using the mgb / mgh feature .",
    "the spectra from the fibres in each of the red and blue beams are imaged on to a 2k @xmath51 2k e2v ccd . for each field",
    ", @xmath52 fibres were used to measure the sky spectrum .",
    "wavelength calibration spectra were acquired before and after the exposures for each fibre setup , and flat field spectra were taken for each setup in order to trace the spectra of the stars and to remove small fringing effects and pixel - to - pixel sensitivity variations .",
    "figure [ fig : donefields ] shows the locations of the 28 fields selected for this program .",
    "spectra were acquired for about 28,000 stars , using 42 nights in the winters of @xmath53 .",
    "our goal was to acquire spectra of about @xmath13 stars in each field .",
    "this was achieved , except for a single field at @xmath54 for which we have about @xmath55 stars .",
    "the @xmath56magnitudes of the selected stars were mostly between about @xmath9 and @xmath57 and were used to allocate each star to one of three one - magnitude intervals for observation .",
    "these magnitude intervals were approximately from @xmath58 and @xmath59 , depending on the mean reddening in the individual fields . in each field , we selected about @xmath13 stars , uniformly distributed over the three magnitude intervals and uniformly distributed over the @xmath60 field so that every available fibre could be allocated to a star .",
    "the typical total exposure times for the three magnitude intervals were ( 60 , 120 , 150 ) minutes respectively , acquired in several sub - exposures , so the s / n is usually higher for the brighter stars .",
    "the clump stars in these @xmath56band intervals are at mean distances of about ( @xmath61 ) kpc respectively , covering the entire line of sight through the bar / bulge at longitudes between @xmath62 and @xmath63 degrees . for each field , @xmath52 sky positions , which are free of visible stars on the red digital sky survey survey images , were selected visually .",
    "the s / n achieved in each field for our primary spectrum over the ca - triplet region is given in table [ table : one ] , where the different magnitude ranges are indicated using 1 , 2 , 3 , from the brightest to the faintest .",
    "the code for the field names is the longitude and then the latitude , where the m and p are for minus and plus values of @xmath64 and @xmath65 : e.g. m0m10_3 denotes the fibre setup at @xmath66 and at the faintest magnitude range ."
