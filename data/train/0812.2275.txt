    "in wireless networks for which nodes can benefit from cooperation and packet - forwarding , there is also a need to preserve the confidentiality of transmitted information from untrusted nodes .",
    "information privacy in wireless networks has traditionally been the domain of the higher layers of the protocol stack via the use of cryptographically secure schemes . in his seminal paper on the three - node wiretap channel , wyner showed that perfect secrecy of transmitted data from the source node can be achieved when the physical channel to the eavesdropper is noisier than the channel to the intended destination , i.e. , when the channel is a degraded broadcast channel @xcite .",
    "this work was later extended by csiszr and krner to all broadcast channels with confidential messages , in which the source node sends common information to both the destination and the wiretapper and confidential information only to the destination @xcite .",
    "recently , the problem of secure communications has also been studied for a variety of multi - terminal networks ; see , for example , @xcite , and the references therein . in @xcite , the authors show that a relay node can facilitate the transmission of confidential messages from the source to the destination in the presence of a wiretapper , often referred to as an eavesdropper in the wireless setting .",
    "the authors develop the rate - equivocation region for this four node relay - eavesdropper channel and introduce a noise forwarding scheme in which the relay , even if it is unable to aid the source in its transmissions , transmits codewords independent of the source to confuse the eavesdropper .",
    "a special case where the eavesdropper receives a degraded version of the destination s signal is studied in @xcite . in contrast , the relay channel with confidential messages in which the relay node acts as both a helper and eavesdropper is studied in @xcite . note that in all the three papers , the relay is assumed to be full - duplex , i.e. , it can transmit and receive simultaneously over the entire bandwidth .    in this paper",
    ", we study the secrecy capacity of a relay channel with orthogonal components in the presence of a passive eavesdropper node .",
    "the orthogonality comes from the fact that the relay and destination receive signals from the source on orthogonal channels ; furthermore , the destination also receives transmissions from the relay on its ( the destination s ) channel .",
    "the orthogonal model implicitly imposes a half - duplex transmission and reception constraint on the relay . for this channel , in the absence of an eavesdropper , el gamal and zahedi showed that a _ partial decode - and - forward _ ( pdf ) strategy in which the source transmits two messages on the two orthogonal channels and the relay decodes its received signal , achieves the capacity .",
    "we study the secrecy capacity of this channel for both the discrete memoryless and gaussian channel models . as a first step towards this ,",
    "we develop a pdf strategy for the full - duplex relay eavesdropper channel and extend it to the orthogonal model .",
    "further , since the eavesdropper can receive signals from either orthogonal channel or both , three cases arise in the development of the secrecy capacity .",
    "we specialize the outer bounds developed in @xcite for the orthogonal case and show that for the discrete memoryless channel , pdf achieves the secrecy capacity for the two cases where the eavesdropper receives signals in only one of the two orthogonal channels .    for the gaussian model ,",
    "we develop two new outer bounds using recent results on the secrecy capacity of the gaussian multiple - input multiple - output channels in the presence of a multi - antenna eavesdropper ( mimome ) in @xcite .",
    "the first outer bound is a genie - aided bound that allows the source and relay to cooperate perfectly resulting in a gaussian mimome channel for which jointly gaussian inputs maximize the capacity .",
    "we show that these bounds are tight for a sub - class of channels in which the multiaccess channel from the source and relay to the destination is the bottleneck link , and the eavesdropper is limited to receiving signals on the channel from the source and the relay to the destination . for a complementary sub - class of channels",
    "in which the source - relay link is unusable due to noise resulting in a _ deaf _ relay , we develop a genie - aided bound where the relay and destination act like a two - antenna receiver .",
    "we also show that noise forwarding achieves this bound for this sub - class of channels .",
    "in @xcite , the authors study the secrecy rate of the channel studied here under the assumption that the relay is co - located with the eavesdropper and the eavesdropper is completely cognizant of the transmit and receive signals at the relay . the authors found that using the relay does not increase the secrecy capacity and",
    "hence there is no security advantage to using the relay . in this paper",
    ", we consider the eavesdropper as a separate entity and show that using the relay increases the secrecy capacity in some cases . in the model of @xcite",
    ", the eavesdropper can overhear only on the channel to the relay , while we consider three cases in which the eavesdropper can overhear on either or both the channels .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ] ,",
    "we present the channel models . in section [ sec3 ]",
    ", we develop the inner and outer bounds on the secrecy capacity of the discrete memoryless model .",
    "we illustrate these results with examples in section [ sec4 ] . in section",
    "[ sec5 ] , we present inner and outer bounds for the gaussian channel model and illustrate our results with examples .",

    ", we consider a relay eavesdropper channel with orthogonal components in which the relay receives and transmits on two orthogonal channels .",
    "the source transmits on both channels , one of which is received at the relay and the other at the destination .",
    "the relay transmits along with the source on the channel received at the destination .",

    ". the eavesdropper can receive transmissions in one or both orthogonal channels such that @xmath25 denotes the received signal at the eavesdropper in orthogonal channel @xmath7 , @xmath26  and @xmath27 .",
    "more formally , the relay eavesdropper channel with orthogonal components is defined as follows .",
    "[ def_orthrd]a discrete - memoryless relay eavesdropper channel is said to have orthogonal components if the sender alphabet @xmath28 and the channel can be expressed as @xmath29 assumes that the eavesdropper can receive signals in both channels . in general , the secrecy capacity bounds for this channel depend on the receiver capabilities of the eavesdropper . to this end",
    ", we explicitly include the following two definitions for the cases in which the eavesdropper can receive signals in only one of the channels .",
    "[ chdef1]the eavesdropper is limited to receiving signals on the channel from the source to the relay , if @xmath30    [ chdef2 ] the eavesdropper is limited to receiving signals on the channel from the source and the relay to the destination , if @xmath31    in the absence of an eavesdropper , i.e. , for @xmath32 , the channels in ( [ red_chpr])-([b2_chpr ] ) simplify to that of a relay channel with orthogonal components .",
