    "topology freezing or fixing are important issues in quantum field theory , in particular in qcd .",
    "for example , when simulating chirally symmetric overlap quarks , the corresponding algorithms do not allow transitions between different topological sectors , i.e.  topological charge is fixed ( cf .",
    "e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "also when using other quark discretizations , e.g.  wilson fermions , topology freezing is expected at lattice spacings @xmath4 , which are nowadays still fine , but realistic @xcite .",
    "there are also applications , where one might fix topology on purpose .",
    "for example , when using a mixed action setup with light overlap valence and wilson sea quarks , approximate zero modes in the valence sector are not compensated by the sea .",
    "the consequence is an ill - behaved continuum limit @xcite . a possible solution to overcome this problem is to restrict computations to a single topological sector , either by sorting the generated gauge link configurations with respect to their topological charge or by directly employing so - called topology fixing actions ( cf .",
    "e.g.  @xcite ) .    in view of these issues",
    "it is important to develop methods , which allow to obtain physically meaningful results ( i.e.  results corresponding to unfixed topology ) from fixed topology simulations .",
    "the starting point for our work are calculations from the seminal papers @xcite .",
    "we extend these calculations by including all terms proportional to @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "we apply the resulting equations to a quantum mechanical particle on a circle , to the schwinger model and to su(2 ) yang - mills theory and determine `` hadron masses '' at unfixed topology from fixed topology computations and simulations ( for related exploratory studies in the schwinger model and the @xmath5 and @xmath6 non - linear sigma model cf .",

    "part of this work has already been published @xcite .",
    "the partition function and the two - point correlation function of a hadron creation operator @xmath7 at fixed topological charge @xmath8 and finite spacetime volume @xmath1 are given by @xmath9 } e^{-s_e[a,\\bar{\\psi},\\psi ] } \\\\",

    "note that the effective mass at fixed topology , defined in the usual way , @xmath26 exhibits severe deviations from a constant behavior at large temporal separations @xmath27 @xcite , which is in contrast to ordinary quantum field theory at unfixed topology .      a straightforward method to determine physical hadron masses ( i.e.  hadron masses at unfixed topology ) from fixed topology simulations is to fit either ( [ eqn673 ] ) or ( [ eqn674 ] ) to two - point correlation functions computed at fixed topology . among the results of the fit are then the hadron mass at unfixed topology @xmath28 and the topological susceptibility @xmath15 .",
    "a similar method is to first determine hadron masses @xmath29 at fixed topological charge @xmath8 and spacetime volume @xmath1 and then use equations based on ( [ eqn673 ] ) or ( [ eqn674 ] ) to determine @xmath28 and @xmath15 . for a detailed discussion cf .",

    "for a first test of the methods mentioned in section  [ sec13 ] we decided for a simple toy model , a quantum mechanical particle on a circle in a square well potential .",

    "moreover , it can be solved numerically up to arbitrary precision .",
