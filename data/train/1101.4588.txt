    "the inflationary paradigm @xcite has been confirmed as the most successful candidate for explaining the physics of the very early universe @xcite .",
    "this sort of scenarios has been successful in solving some of the puzzles of the standard cosmological model , such as the horizon , flatness and entropy problems , as well as providing for a mechanism to seed structure in the universe .",
    "the source of inflation is a scalar field ( the inflaton field ) , which plays an important role in providing a causal interpretation of the origin of the observed anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background radiation , and also distribution of large scale structure @xcite .",
    "the nature of this scalar field may be found by considering one of the extensions of the standard model of particle physics based on grand unified theories , supergravity , or some effective theory at low dimension of a more fundamental string theory .",
    "the idea that inflation comes from an effective theory is in itself very appealing .",
    "the main motivation to study this sort of model comes from string / m - theory .",
    "this theory suggests that in order to have a ghost - free action high order curvature invariant corrections to the einstein - hilbert action must be proportional to the gauss - bonnet ( gb ) term @xcite .",
    "gb terms arise naturally as the leading order of the @xmath0 expansion to the low - energy string effective action , where @xmath0 is the inverse string tension @xcite .",
    "this kind of theory has been applied to the possible resolution of the initial singularity problem @xcite , also to the study of black - hole solutions @xcite , and accelerated cosmological solutions @xcite . in particular , it has been found @xcite that for a dark energy model the gb interaction in four dimensions with a dynamical dilatonic scalar field coupling leads to a solution of the form @xmath1 , where the universe starts evolving with a decelerated exponential expansion . here , the constant @xmath2 is given by @xmath3 and @xmath4 , with @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the newtonian gravitational constant , and @xmath7 an arbitrary constant .",
    "we have the particular scenario called intermediate inflation @xcite , characterized for the scale factor evolving as @xmath8 . in this model ,",
    "the expansion of the universe is slower than standard de sitter inflation ( @xmath9 ) , but faster than power law inflation ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "the intermediate inflationary model was introduced as an exact solution corresponding to a particular scalar field potential of the type @xmath11 ( in the slow - roll approximation ) , where @xmath12 . with this sort of potential",
    "it is possible in the slow - roll approximation to have a spectrum of density perturbations which presents a scale - invariant spectral index @xmath13 , i.e. the so - called harrison - zeldovich spectrum of density perturbations , provided @xmath14 takes the value of 2/3 @xcite .",
    "even though this kind of spectrum is disfavored by the current wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) data @xcite , the inclusion of tensor perturbations , which could be present at some point by inflation and parametrized by the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath15 , allows the conclusion that @xmath16 providing that the value of @xmath15 is significantly nonzero @xcite .",
    "in fact , in ref.@xcite was shown that the combination @xmath13 and @xmath17 is given by a version of the intermediate inflationary scenario in which the scale factor varies as @xmath18 within the slow - roll approximation .",
    "on the other hand , motivations also coming from string theory , there has been carried out a less standard theory of gravity , namely the so called scalar - tensor theory of gravity @xcite .",
    "the archetypical theory associated with scalar - tensor models is the jordan - brans - dicke ( jbd ) gravity @xcite .",
    "the jbd theory is a class of model in which the effective gravitational coupling evolves with time .",
    "the strength of this coupling is determined by a scalar field , the so - called jbd field , which tends to the value @xmath19 .",
    "the origin of jbd theory is in mach s principle according to which the property of inertia of material bodies arises from their interactions with the matter distributed in the universe . in modern context , jbd theory appears naturally in supergravity models , kaluza - klein theories and in all known effective string actions @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we would like to study intermediate inflationary universe model in a jbd theory .",
    "we will write the friedmann field equations , together with the corresponding scalar field equations ( inflaton and jbd fields ) .",
    "the intermediate inflationary period of inflation will be consistently described in the slow - roll approximation .",
    "scalar and tensor perturbations will be expressed in terms of the parameters that appear in our model , these parameters will be constrained by taking into account the wmap five and seven year data .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "the next section presents the field equations in the einstein frame . in section [ sect4 ]",
    "we study the slow - roll approximation .",
    "section [ sect5 ] deals with the calculations of cosmological scalar perturbations",
