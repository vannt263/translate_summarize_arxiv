    "there is a continuing interest in exotic states of strong interactions that differ from the standard nonexotic mesons and baryons ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "nonexotic three - quark baryons have been intensively studied in  @xcite .",
    "finite mass effects were studied in  @xcite where the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) qcd corrections to the correlators of finite mass baryonic currents were determined .",
    "this led to an improved precision of the sum rule analysis .",
    "different aspects of the physics of multiquark states in qcd have been discussed long ago  @xcite .",
    "it is noteworthy that the analysis of multiquark exotics can provide valuable information on the details of quark - gluon interaction relevant to nuclear physics  @xcite .",
    "candidates to be described in qcd as multiquark states are the deuteron  @xcite or jaffe s dihyperon @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "since the dihyperon state can only decay weakly , it would be expected to be quite narrow .",
    "to the best of our knowledge the dihyperon state is the first state to attract attention in the modern context of qcd .",
    "the discovery of gluon bound states would be a triumphant confirmation of qcd and would allow for a quantitative check of qcd in the completely new sector of the glueball states  @xcite .",
    "another class of multiquark states , the pentaquark states , have recently become the focus of intense theoretical and experimental studies .",
    "the properties of all of these multiquark ( or multigluon ) states can be studied in a model independent way through the method of the qcd sum rule analysis . in the qcd sum rule analysis one",
    "analyzes the operator product expansion of current  current correlators of interpolating local fields which have the quantum numbers of the multiquark states under study .",
    "it is well known that radiative corrections have a strong impact on the results of the sum rule analysis . in this paper",
    "we derive the necessary tools that allow one to compute the @xmath1 radiative corrections to multiquark sum rules in the limit when the quarks ( or antiquarks ) are massless . as a specific example",
    "we apply our method to pentaquark correlators and calculate the nlo radiative corrections to the pentaquark current correlator and the spectral density of a specific pentaquark current .",
    "an important ingredient in the formulation of the operator product expansion ( ope ) analysis for the pentaquark states is the choice of the interpolating current .",
    "the result depends strongly on the choice of the interpolating current as has been pointed out before in the sum rule analysis of the dibaryon  @xcite .",
    "the same holds true for the sum rule analysis of pentaquark states  @xcite .",
    "a detailed analysis of the dependence on the interpolating current is out of the scope of a short letter , it will be published elsewhere  @xcite . in the following we shall present the tools needed to calculate the nlo qcd corrections for interpolating quark currents of any composition .      in the qcd sum rule analysis",
    "the prime object of study is the correlation function @xmath2 where the interpolating current @xmath3 is a local operator with the quantum numbers of the pentaquark baryon state @xmath4 .",
    "it has to be constructed from four quark and one antiquark fields such that its projection onto the pentaquark state @xmath5 is nonzero : @xmath6 since the interpolating current @xmath3 is not unique , one immediately faces the question of the optimal choice for the interpolating currents . recall that the problem of choosing the optimal current already arose in the case of baryons  @xcite where the currents are constructed from three quark fields . in the pentaquark case",
    "there are five quark ( antiquark ) fields to build the interpolating currents and correspondingly the number of independent currents with the correct quantum numbers is much larger ( see  @xcite and references therein ) .    the treatment of the interpolating current @xmath3 in its most general form , i.e.  in the form of linear combinations of all possible independent local operators with the correct pentaquark quantum numbers , is a very unwieldy problem . in this pilot study of the nlo corrections to interpolating pentaquark currents we limit ourselves to the study of only one simple interpolating currents with the required pentaquark quantum numbers . as in the case of mesons and baryons , we construct our interpolating current @xmath3 from quark fields without derivatives .      the lo diagram for the pentaquark correlator is given by the four - loop diagram fig .  [ pentcor](a ) .",
    "lo contribution ( a ) and examples for the nlo propagator ( b ) and dipropagator corrections ( c),title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=15.0% ] lo contribution ( a ) and examples for the nlo propagator ( b ) and dipropagator corrections ( c),title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=15.0% ]    ( a)(b)(c )    there are two types of nlo five - loop corrections .",
    "first there are the one - loop corrections to single quark propagators @xmath7 , one of which is shown in fig .",
    "[ pentcor](b ) .",
    "we shall refer to these corrections as the propagator corrections .",
    "then there are the dipropagator corrections connecting two different quark propagators , one of which is shown in fig .",
    "[ pentcor](c ) .",
    "it turns out that it is very convenient to calculate these corrections in configuration space , in particular if the quarks are treated as massless  @xcite . for the propagator correction @xmath8",
    "we obtain @xmath9 where in the euclidean domain one has @xmath10 @xmath11 is a renormalization scale in dimensional regularization appropriate for calculations in configuration space .",
    "the space - time dimension is parametrized by @xmath12 .",
    "this choice of renormalization scale avoids the appearance of @xmath13 and @xmath14 factors in configuration space calculations .",
    "the relation of @xmath11 and the usual renormalization scale @xmath15 of the @xmath16-scheme is given by @xmath17 the dipropagator two - loop amplitude for a pair of quarks with open dirac indices leads to an integral that is a bit more difficult to calculate .",
    "the result for the dipropagator correction including the lo term reads @xmath18 where the coefficients @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are given by @xmath22 and where @xmath23 eqs .",
    "( [ propagator ] ) and  ( [ dipropagator ] ) allow one to calculate the nlo corrections to @xmath24-quark(antiquark ) current correlators of any composition using purely algebraically algorithms without having to compute any integrals",
    ".      in a nlo calculation one has to account for mixing effects between operators when going through the renormalization program .",
    "mixing can occur when gluons are exchanged between the lines in the pentaquark correlator ( dipropagator corrections ) . in order to keep track of flavours",
    "we first treat the case of an interpolating current composed of five massless quark(antiquark ) fields with different flavours , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the charge conjugation matrix .",
    "the interpolating current consists of a baryonic part @xmath27 and a mesonic part @xmath28 .",
    "if the gluon is exchanged within the mesonic part , the renormalization factor is the usual one for the mesonic operator ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , @xmath29 if the gluon is exchanged within the baryonic part , the renormalization factor is given by the known renormalization factor for the baryonic operator  @xcite , @xmath30 these two contributions will be referred to as factorizing contributions . when the gluon is exchanged between the mesonic and baryonic part one",
    "obtains new operators which do not have the structure of the original current .",
    "there are two contributions of this kind which we refer to as mixed contributions . if the gluon is exchanged between the mesonic part and the @xmath31 piece of the baryonic part , we obtain a contribution of the operator @xmath32 where @xmath33 $ ] .",
    "if the gluon is exchanged between the mesonic part and the @xmath34 piece of the baryonic part one obtains a contribution of the operator @xmath35 the renormalized current reads @xmath36",
    "in order to obtain nlo results , let us consider the interpolating current @xmath37 with the quantum numbers of the pentaquark baryon @xmath4 .",
    "the current is constructed in such a way that it can not directly dissociate into a neutron and a kaon since the respective color singlet parts have the wrong parity .",
    "the result of our nlo calculation for the bare correlator reads @xmath38 @xmath39 where @xmath40 the first line contains the factorizing nlo contibutions while the second and third lines contain the mixing contributions .",
    "the counter term contains contributions from the renormalization factors @xmath41 and @xmath42 as well as from the operators @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "it reads @xmath45 adding eqs .",
    "( [ pix2 ] ) and  ( [ deltapi ] ) one obtains the renormalized correlator @xmath46 with @xmath47 .    the spectral density is obtained by calculating the discontinuity of @xmath48 for the cases @xmath49 and @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the bessel function of the first kind  @xcite .",
    "one obtains ( @xmath52 ) @xmath53 with @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "the first nlo contribution in both the correlator and the spectral density comes from the factorizing part of the diagrams , i.e.  the case where baryon and meson correlators are multiplied in configuration space and do not mix by gluon exchange .",
    "this contribution dominates the final result but is probably irrelevant for physics as it does not contain a pentaquark bound state .",
    "the physically relevant mixing contributions are smaller since they are suppressed both in the number of colours @xmath56 and a factor @xmath57 coming from the evaluation of dirac traces .",
    "the result for the spectral density  ( [ spectral ] ) shows that the nlo corrections to the spectral density are large , where the nlo corrections to the factorizing parts are somewhat smaller ( note , however , that the relevant scale is not @xmath58 but rather @xmath59 because of the number of lines in the correlator ) .",
    "this spoils the conventional momentum space qcd sum rule analysis .",
    "the nlo corrections to the correlator function  ( [ pirx2 ] ) in configuration space are more reasonable .",
    "this suggests a sum rule analysis in configuration space , based on the correlator  ( [ pirx2 ] ) .",
    "however , it is not clear whether the accuracy of such a sum rule analysis in configuration space will be sufficient for physical applications .",
    "we have calculated nlo perturbative qcd corrections for pentaquark current correlators which turn out to be very large .",
    "one has to conclude that the nlo qcd sum rule analysis of pentaquark states is fraught with difficulties .",
    "this complicates the mass determination of the pentaquark states using a qcd sum rule analysis .",
    "one may have to take recourse to model calculations to determine the properties of pentaquark states such as the one based on chiral solitons  @xcite .",
