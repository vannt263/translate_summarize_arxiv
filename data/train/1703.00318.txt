    "masures were introduced by gaussent and rousseau  @xcite and developed further by rousseau  @xcite , charignon  @xcite , gaussent ",
    "rousseau  @xcite and bardy - panse  gaussent  rousseau in  @xcite .",
    "the theory of masures has been developed in order to make several techniques from bruhat  tits theory also applicable in the context of kac  moody groups . by bruhat ",
    "tits theory , with every semi - simple algebraic group @xmath0 over a non - archimedean local field @xmath3 there is associated a `` symmetric space '' , called the affine building of @xmath0 . more generally , with an almost split kac ",
    "moody group @xmath0 over such a field @xmath3 there is associated a masure whose construction is carried out by suitably modifying the bruhat  tits construction . as for buildings ,",
    "a masure is covered by apartments corresponding to the maximal split tori and every apartment is a finite dimensional real affine space endowed with a set of affine hyperplanes called walls . at a first glance , a masure looks very much like a bruhat ",
    "tits building .",
    "however , in the case of masures , the set of all walls is not always a locally finite system of hyperplanes and it is no longer true that any two points are contained in a common apartment .",
    "for this reason , the word `` building '' is replaced by the word `` masure '' . moreover ,",
    "if we look at infinity of a masure , we obtain a twin building , which is the analogue of the spherical building at infinity associated with a bruhat  tits building . as an application , bardy - panse , gaussent and rousseau  @xcite ,",
    "@xcite use the construction of masures to define the spherical hecke and iwahori  hecke algebras associated with an almost split kac ",
    "moody group over a non - archimedean local field . in  @xcite the masure is used to make the link ( in the representation theory of kac  moody groups ) between the littelmann s path model and the mirkovic ",
    "vilonen cycle model .",
    "although there are several contributions to the subject , it is fair to say that the theory of masures is not yet in its final form .",
    "this is underlined by the fact that there are several basic questions that still need to be answered .",
    "most of these questions are about generalizations of known results from bruhat  tits theory and sometimes it is even not clear how to state properly the analogue of such a result in the context of masures .    in  @xcite",
    "two of us provided a generalization of a result on strongly transitive actions that has been proved by the first author in a joint work with p .- e .",
    "caprace in  @xcite for bruhat  tits buildings .",
    "the result in  @xcite involves the cone topology on the spherical building at infinity of a bruhat ",
    "tits building and therefore relies on the fact that the latter is a @xmath4-space .",
    "unfortunately , it seems that there is no reasonable way to endow a masure with a @xmath4-metric .",
    "however , it turns out that there is nonetheless a canonical cone topology on the set of chambers of the twin building at infinity of a masure .",
    "this observation was indeed one of the crucial insights in  @xcite to generalize the result in  @xcite to masures .",
    "apart from being useful in this particular context we believe that the cone topology is an important ingredient for the theory of masures . for this reason we provide several basic results regarding the cone topology which show that it has several remarkable properties . as a consequence of our investigation , it turns out that the twin building at infinity of a masure endowed with the cone topology is a `` weak topological twin building '' in the sense of hartnick  khl  mars  @xcite . in that paper , topological twin buildings",
    "are constructed by means of the kac ",
    "peterson topology of a kac  moody group .",
    "it turns out that masures provide examples of weak topological twin buildings and this construction appears to be much more natural and direct than the one given in hartnick",
    " mars  @xcite .    as a result of",
    "what has been said so far , the goal of this article is twofold .",
    "firstly , we introduce the cone topology on the set of chambers of the twin building at infinity of a masure and study its basic properties .",
    "secondly , we investigate the notion of strong transitivity for masures .",
    "based on the notion of the cone topology we are able to provide a generalization of a result of caprace and ciobotaru from  @xcite .      for any @xmath4space ( a locally finite affine building , a locally finite tree , )",
    "the cone topology is a natural topology used to study various properties of the visual boundary of the corresponding @xmath4space .",
    "unfortunately , there does not seem to be any reasonable way to endow a masure with a @xmath4metric .",
    "therefore it is unlikely that we can use the full power of the @xmath4machinery in the context of masures .",
    "however , it turns out that there is still a canonical topology on the set of chambers of the twin building at infinity of a masure which generalizes the cone topology on the visual boundary of a bruhat  tits building .",
    "the precise definition of the cone topology requires some preparation and it is given in definition  [ def::cone_top_on_chambers ] .",
    "it turns out that the cone topology has several remarkable properties and some of them are given in the following theorem .",
    "[ theo : cone.top ] let @xmath1 be a masure and let @xmath5 be the set of chambers of the twin building at infinity of @xmath1 .    1 .",
    "the cone topology on the set @xmath5 of all chambers at infinity of a masure is hausdorff .",
    "residues are closed with respect to the cone topology on @xmath5 .",
    "the set of chambers in @xmath5 opposite a given chamber in @xmath5 is open in @xmath5 .",
    "when the masure is `` locally finite '' and `` locally complete '' ( see definitions  [ def::locally_finite ] and  [ def::locally_complete ] below ) , then any panel and , more generally , any spherical residue or schubert variety in @xmath5 is compact .",
    "we would like to point out that the statement of theorem [ theo : cone.top ] is meant to give the reader a rough idea about our results on the cone topology .",
    "they will be proved among other results given in sections  [ subsec::prop_cone_top ] and  [ subsec::further_prop ] to which we refer for the details . as already indicated above",
    ", these results provide a link to previous contributions of kramer  @xcite and hartnick  khl  mars  @xcite on topological twin buildings . especially in the latter reference",
    "the authors discuss several axioms that one could require for a topological twin building .",
    "it turns out that the cone topology behaves very nicely in the sense that it satisfies most of them .",
    "apart from the basic facts on the cone topology recorded in theorem  [ theo : cone.top ] we shall also present in this introduction a slightly more specific result .",
    "this result relies on the notion of a panel tree in a masure , which also plays a crucial role on our results on strongly transitive actions .",
    "the concept of a panel tree is well known from the theory of affine buildings and it turns out that it generalizes without any problems to masures .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath1 be a masure and let @xmath5 be its building at infinity",
    ". then one can associate with any pair @xmath6 of opposite spherical residues of @xmath5 an affine building @xmath7 which is a `` convex '' subset of @xmath1 ; moreover , there is a canonical identification of @xmath8 with the spherical building at infinity of @xmath7 .",
    "as we already mentioned , there is the `` usual '' cone topology on the boundary @xmath9 of @xmath7 which induces a topology @xmath10 on @xmath8 , that a priori depends on the opposite residue @xmath11 .",
    "[ prop : cone_top_residue ] let @xmath1 be a masure , let @xmath5 be its building at infinity , let @xmath8 be a spherical residue of @xmath5 and let @xmath12 be the cone topology on @xmath5 . then @xmath13 for each residue @xmath11 that is opposite @xmath8 in @xmath5",
    ".    for more details about proposition  [ prop : cone_top_residue ] see section  [ 1.5 ] and remark  [ rem::essential ] .      in the second part of the paper we shall provide a criterion which ensures that a group action on a masure is strongly transitive .",
    "this criterion involves the cone topology on the twin building at infinity .",
    "its proof relies on a modification of the strategy followed by caprace and ciobotaru in @xcite .",
    "the notion of a strongly transitive action on a discrete building is crucial for group theoretic applications of buildings since it provides the link to groups with bn - pairs .",
    "if the building is no longer discrete ( @xmath14buildings ) , the standard definition of a strongly transitive action has to be suitably modified in order to adapt the basic machinery ( see section [ def:1.2 ] below ) .",
    "thus it is not surprising that there is also a natural definition of a strongly transitive action on a masure .",
    "it is given in rousseau @xcite ( see also gaussent - rousseau @xcite ) and it is recalled in definition [ 4.2 ] below . as this definition",
    "is somehow involved we prefer to omit it in this introduction .",
    "the starting point of our investigation is provided by the following :    ( see proposition [ 5.5 ] ) [ fact ] let @xmath15 be a thick affine building ( or a thick masure ) and let @xmath5 be its ( twin)-building at infinity .",
    "suppose that a group @xmath0 acts strongly transitively on @xmath15 , then the action of @xmath0 induced on @xmath5 is strongly transitive as well .",
    "the converse is not true in general : there are examples of group actions on affine buildings or masures which are not strongly transitive on @xmath15 but which induce a strongly transitive action on @xmath5 .",
    "the following remark provides a basic example of such a situation .",
    "[ rem::dte_not_st ] let @xmath16 be a regular tree and let @xmath17 be an end of @xmath16 .",
    "define @xmath18 to be the set of all apartments of @xmath16 not containing @xmath17 at infinity and let @xmath0 be the group of automorphisms of @xmath16 fixing @xmath17",
    ". then @xmath0 is @xmath19transitive ( equivalently , strongly transitive ) on the set @xmath20 of ends of @xmath21 .",
    "but @xmath0 is not strongly transitive on @xmath21 : any @xmath22 stabilizing an apartment @xmath23 fixes the projection of @xmath17 on @xmath24 .",
    "suppose that @xmath0 is a group acting on a masure such that its action on the twin building at infinity is strongly transitive .",
    "in view of the example above it is natural to ask for additional conditions which ensure that @xmath0 acts strongly transitively on the masure . for affine buildings one such condition is the assumption that the apartment system of @xmath15 is complete . in the locally finite case",
    "this is due to caprace and ciobotaru , as it follows from theorem 1.1 in @xcite .",
    "it was proved later in full generality by kramer and schillewaert in @xcite .",
    "although completeness of the apartment system is a most natural assumption , there are important situations where the apartment system is not complete . moreover , in the case of masures it is even not clear whether there is a sensible definition of a complete apartment system . thus , it is natural to ask for other conditions which ensure that a strongly transitive action at infinity yields a strongly transitive action on the affine building or masure . in this paper",
    "we provide such a condition for masures .",
    "it involves the cone topology and the notion of a strongly regular hyperbolic element in the automorphisms group of a masure .",
    "it relies on the observation , that the strategy used by caprace and ciobotaru in the proof of theorem 1.1 in @xcite can be modified in such a way that completeness is not needed and - more importantly in our context - that it also works for masures . before stating our generalization of the main result of @xcite it is convenient to provide some information about strongly regular hyperbolic elements in the automorphism group of a masure and to formulate the analogue of the topological condition in @xcite for masures .",
    ": let @xmath15 be a masure and let @xmath25 .",
    "then @xmath26 is called a strongly regular hyperbolic automorphism of @xmath15 if it has no fixed points in @xmath15 and stabilizes an apartment @xmath24 of @xmath15 on which it induces a translation .",
    "moreover , the direction of the latter is required to be in the tits cone ( up to sign ) , but should not be contained in any of its walls ( see definition [ def::str_reg_lines ] ) .    as a side product of our investigation in this paper",
    "we obtain the following general fact about strongly regular hyperbolic elements :    [ stimpliesreghyp ] let @xmath15 be a thick masure such that the type of @xmath27 has no direct factor of affine type .",
    "if a vectorially weyl subgroup @xmath28 is strongly transitive , then @xmath0 contains a strongly regular hyperbolic element .",
    "this is a consequence of lemma [ 5.7 ] and theorem [ thm : existencestronglyreg ] below .    :",
    "the following definition is motivated by one of the assumptions in theorem 1.1 of @xcite :    [ 1.6 ] let @xmath15 be a masure and let @xmath0 be a group acting by vectorially weyl automorphisms ( see section 2.4.1 ) on @xmath15 .",
    "let @xmath29 , let @xmath30 denote the set of chambers in @xmath27 which are opposite to @xmath31 and let @xmath32 denote the stabilizer of @xmath31 in @xmath0 .",
    "the * horospherical stabilizer * of @xmath31 is defined to be the group @xmath33 ( see lemma [ lem : unip ] ) .",
    "we say that @xmath0 satisfies condition ( top ) if , for each chamber @xmath31 in @xmath27 , the following holds :    ( top ) the orbits of @xmath34 in @xmath30 are closed with respect to the topology on @xmath30 that is induced from the cone topology on @xmath27 .",
    "we are now in the position to state our main result about strongly transitive actions on masures :    [ thm::main_theorem_intr ] let @xmath35 be a thick masure and let @xmath0 be a vectorially weyl subgroup of @xmath36 .",
    "if @xmath0 contains a strongly regular hyperbolic element and satisfies condition ( top ) , then the following are equivalent :    a.   [ thm : main - thm - i_int ] @xmath0 acts strongly transitively on @xmath1 ; b.   [ thm : main - thm - ii_int ] @xmath0 acts strongly transitively on the twin building at infinity @xmath2 .    combining theorem [ thm::main_theorem_intr ] ,",
    "proposition [ stimpliesreghyp ] and remark [ rem::semi - discretness ] , we obtain also the following :    [ cornoaffinedirectfactors ] let @xmath15 be a thick masure such that the type of @xmath27 has no direct factor of affine type .",
    "let @xmath37 be a vectorially weyl subgroup.then the following are equivalent :    \\(i ) @xmath0 acts strongly transitively on @xmath27 , contains a strongly regular hyperbolic automorphism of @xmath38 and satisfies condition ( top ) ;    \\(ii ) g is strongly transitive on @xmath15 .",

    "we define and study the cone topology on the twin building at infinity of a masure .",
    "we prove theorem [ theo : cone.top ] and several other results which are motivated by the axioms for topological twin buildings discussed in @xcite .    in section [ s2 ]",
    "we introduce different notions of stabilizers ( in particular the horospherical stabilizer ) of chambers or pairs of opposite panels at infinity , and prove some technical lemmas about them .",
