    "the investigation of spatially separated electrons and holes in the coupled quantum wells ( cqw ) is motivated by expecting that the electron - hole pairs forming a long - living bound state , namely exciton , can experience the bose - einstein condensation @xcite .",
    "the interest in such systems has greatly grown in the recent years due to the increasing ability to manufacture the high quality quantum well structures in which electrons and holes are confined in the different regions between which the tunneling can be made negligible @xcite . for this reason , in the cqw",
    "the exciton lifetime becomes by several orders of the magnitude longer than the lifetime of excitons in bulk materials , enabling an experimental observation of the exciton bose - einstein condensation .",
    "as early as decade and a half , lozovik and berman , using the variational approach , predicted the existence of an electron - hole condensate phase in cqw @xcite .",
    "the further theoretical investigations of such systems reveal that the phase diagram of the system can be rather rich @xcite .",
    "the main goal of the paper is to find out how the many - body correlations in the electron - hole system in the cqw influence its ground state .",
    "a specific case of the _ many - component _ spatially separated electron - hole plasma in the cqw is studied in the current paper .",
    "it is assumed that @xmath3 different kinds of electrons are confined in one layer of the cqw , while @xmath4 different kinds of holes are confined in the other layer , the parameter being @xmath5 for the first time , the large @xmath3 approximation was proposed for the investigation of a 3d electron - hole liquid in many - valley semiconductors @xcite .",
    "then , this approach got a further development @xcite .    in the model under consideration",
    ", the thickness of the layers is supposed to be so small that the carriers are the @xmath6 ones .",
    "let @xmath7 be the effective bohr radius and @xmath8 be the inter - layer distance .",
    "below , we mainly consider the case @xmath9 under such condition , the isolated electron - hole pair may form an exciton possessing the _ in - plane _",
    "radius @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "let @xmath11 be the carrier concentration .",
    "the concept of excitons has sense until the average in - plane inter - exciton distance being of the order of @xmath12 is larger than @xmath13 i.e. @xmath14 at higher density the exciton system brakes down into the electron - hole one .",
    "it is shown in this paper that the negative contribution of the energy induced by the intra - layer carrier correlation strongly reduces the total energy .",
    "this effect facilitates _ the electron - hole liquid _ formation . for this phase ,",
    "the equilibrium carrier density @xmath15which is the same for the both layers , is found to obey the condition @xmath16 thus , the criterion for an existence of the exciton state is violated .",
    "therewith , the _ electron - hole liquid _ is shown to possess the energy _",
    "lower _ as compared to _ the _ _ exciton state_. note , that the similar conclusion was made for conventional 3d semiconductors , as well @xcite .",
    "the _ homogeneous _ electron - hole liquid state predicted in this paper is realized within the assumption that the carriers possess the infinite lifetime .",
    "if not , the system breaks down into the _ low - density exciton gas _ phase and the _ dense electron - hole liquid _ phase . between these phases the dynamic equilibrium is established which is supported by the external pumping .",
    "a similar scenario was proposed by keldysh for conventional 3d semiconductors @xcite .",
    "the diagrammatic technique is used to calculate the correlation contribution to the energy of the electron - hole state .",
    "the approach is based on the @xmath17 expansion , what allows one to justify the random phase approximation ( rpa ) diagram selection .",
    "it is interesting to note that , for @xmath18 the ground state energy as well as the equilibrium carrier concentration @xmath19 do not depend on the parameter @xmath20 this unexpected feature allows us to expect that the results obtained may be , at least qualitatively , extended even to the region @xmath21 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , we describe the model of the electron - hole system in the cqw .",
    "then , the self - consistent diagrammatic approach is proposed to calculate the electron and hole matsubara green functions and estimate the chemical potential @xmath22 for the electrons and holes at temperature @xmath23 @xmath24 being the fermi energy for both electrons and holes .",
    "this allows us to find the equilibrium _ electron - hole liquid state _",
    "concentration @xmath25 .",
    "though , to obtain the main results , it is assumed that @xmath26 @xmath27the case @xmath28 is also analyzed at the end of the paper . in conclusion",
    ", we consider a possible relation between the results obtained and the experiments , in which the nonuniform state of the system in cqw is revealed @xcite .",
    "to describe the spatially separated electron - hole system in the cqw , it is supposed that the electrons are confined within one infinitely narrow @xmath6 layer , while the holes are confined within the other layer . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", it is supposed that the effective mass of both electrons and holes are the same . below the system of units",
    "is used with the effective electron ( hole ) charge @xmath29 effective electron ( hole ) masses @xmath30 and the planck constant @xmath31 .",
    "then , the effective bohr radius is @xmath32 and the energy is measured in the hartree units .",
    "let @xmath11 be concentration of electrons or holes . according to the model under consideration , the fermi momentum @xmath33 and the fermi energy @xmath34 are the same for both electrons and holes . we confine ourselves to the case of strongly degenerated plasma , that is , the temperature @xmath35    the hamiltonian of the system is @xmath36 @xmath37 being the kinetic energy and @xmath38 being the coulomb interaction . in the second quantization one",
    "has @xmath39    here",
    "@xmath40 for the electrons and @xmath41 for the holes .",

    "let us consider the system of self - consistent equations whose diagram representation is shown in fig.[figure2 ]     is the mass operator .",

    "( [ eq2.03 ] ) obeys the second diagrammatic equation in fig.[figure2 ] and reads @xmath57the polarization operator@xmath58does not depend on the kind of the particles .",
    "let us explain the rule of diagram selection .",
    "each fermion loop contributes a factor @xmath3 to the diagrams . among all the diagrams of the given order ,",
    "only the diagrams are retained which contain the _ maximal _ number of the fermion loops .",
    "thus , our approach is a @xmath1 expansion which results in keeping only the diagram of the _ rpa kind_. the diagrams for which the bubbles are linked by more than one interaction line are small as compared with the rpa ones in the parameter @xmath59for the same reason , the diagrams are small , which contain any _ vertex corrections_.    the expression for the renormalized interaction follows from eq .",
    "( eq2.04 ) @xmath60let us note that , like the polarization operator @xmath61 , both the mass operator @xmath62 and the renormalized interaction @xmath63 do not depend on the kind of the particle .",
    "our first goal is to calculate the chemical potential @xmath22 as a function of the density @xmath11 using the self - consistent system of eqs .",
    "( [ eq2.01])-([eq2.2 ] ) .",
    "let us remind the exact relation    @xmath64    then , the convergence method is used .",
    "if the interaction is neglected , the mass operator @xmath65 and , therefore , @xmath66    to find the next iteration for the chemical potential , let us calculate @xmath67 taking @xmath68 . in this case",
    ", one should replace @xmath69 by @xmath70 in the above system of equations .",
    "first , taking into account eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) , we obtain @xmath71    then , to find the next contribution to the mass operator @xmath72 one should first estimate the renormalized interaction @xmath73 . for this purpose ,",
    "let us consider the polarization operator in zero order in the interaction :    @xmath74    where @xmath75 ^{-1}$ ] is the fermi distribution function .    for _ small _ momenta and frequencies @xmath76",
    "@xmath77 one finds @xmath78 substituting this value into eq .",
    "( [ eq2.2 ] ) gives the estimate @xmath79this estimation is valid if    @xmath80    what is supposed below .",
    "let us turn to the behavior of the renormalized interaction @xmath81 for _  large _ momenta * *  * * @xmath82 first , let us estimate the polarization operator ( [ eq3 ] ) for such momenta . consider , for example , the contribution @xmath83 associated with the factor @xmath84 it is evident that momenta @xmath85 alone contribute to the polarization operator for which @xmath86 for this reason , * *  * * @xmath87 therefore , @xmath88 and @xmath89similarly , one can estimate the contribution @xmath90 connected with the term @xmath91 in eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) . as a result",
    ", we obtain @xmath92taking into account ( [ eq4 ] ) , one can estimate the renormalized interaction ( [ eq2.2 ] )    @xmath93    substituting ( [ eq3.11 ] ) into ( [ eq2.03 ] ) gives the estimate for the contribution to the self - energy @xmath94 coming from @xmath95 @xmath96let us turn to the contribution to @xmath97 gained from @xmath98 it is convenient to represent it in the form@xmath99here @xmath100 the first sum on the r.h.s . in eq .",
    "( [ eq4.21 ] ) can be estimated as    @xmath101    let us turn to the second term on the r.h.s . in eq .",
    "( [ eq4.21 ] ) .",
    "since we are interested in @xmath102 let us substitute @xmath103 \\approx $ ] @xmath104 into this term .",
    "then , one obtains the estimate for the second sum in eq .",
    "( [ eq4.21 ] )    @xmath105    this estimate results from the following hint .",
    "let us introduce new variables @xmath106 and @xmath107 . the integrand is maximal in the vicinity of the region @xmath106 @xmath108 due to eq .",
    "( [ eq01 ] ) , one can put the lower limit equal to zero in integral ( eq4.31 ) .",
    "then the integral depends on the concentration as @xmath109 the proportionality constant is calculated numerically , @xmath110 .",
    "taking into account condition ( [ eq01 ] ) , one can neglect the contribution of expressions ( [ eq2.211 ] ) ( [ eq4.201 ] ) , ( [ eq4.22 ] ) into the chemical potential as compared with ( [ eq4.31 ] ) .",
    "thus , expressions ( eq2.2111 ) and ( [ eq4.31 ] ) alone contribute to the chemical potential .",
    "therefore , @xmath111the chemical potential @xmath112 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) , is a result of the first iteration .",
    "let us now substitute expression ( [ eq5 ] ) for the chemical potential into eqs .",
    "( [ eq2.01 ] ) - ( [ eq2.03 ] ) instead of @xmath113 and repeat all the calculations starting from eq .",
    "( [ eq2.2111 ] ) .",
    "it is easy to find that , whether @xmath114 or @xmath22 is taken as a starting point , the correlation contribution to the self - energy is of the same order of the magnitude given by ( [ eq4.31 ] ) .",
    "for this reason , the expression for the chemical potential ( [ eq5 ] ) is the stable solution of the self - consistent system of equations , the constant @xmath115 being of the order of unity .",
    "this chemical potential corresponds to the energy per unit volume@xmath116then , at _ zero temperature _ the pressure is @xmath117at small density @xmath118 @xmath119 the compressibility @xmath120 and the system is unstable . for higher density , in the interval @xmath121",
    ", one has @xmath122 the system is stable and has a _ negative _ pressure .",
    "the liquid state is reached at the upper limit of this interval @xmath123where the pressure @xmath124    thus , for the electron - hole liquid in the equilibrium , the bound energy _ _  per one particle _ _ is @xmath125at the same time , for the _ isolated exciton _ the bound energy @xmath126is known to behave as @xmath127 since the excitons in the cqw experience _ _  repulsion , . _ _ the bound energy per particle is @xmath128 comparing this energy with @xmath129 ( see expression ( [ eq7 ] ) ) one concludes that the electron - hole state possesses a smaller energy as compared to the exciton state for @xmath130 .",
    "in addition , note that the exciton in - plane radius @xmath131 and , thus , for the equilibrium carrier concentration obtained , one has @xmath132 under such conditions , the exciton concept seems us to have no sense .",
    "the results above are obtained for the case @xmath133 i.e. , @xmath9 in this case , the ground - state of the system is the electron - hole liquid which possesses the equilibrium density ( [ eq6 ] ) .",
    "this is a stable state which has the energy smaller than that of the exciton state .",
    "consider , however , the case @xmath134 it follows from eqs .",
    "( [ eq2.211 ] ) , ( [ eq2.2111 ] ) , ( [ eq4.31 ] ) that the kinetic energy @xmath135 , the direct coulomb interaction @xmath136 and the intra - layer correlation energy @xmath137 can be estimated as @xmath138respectively .",
    "the equilibrium is reached at the concentration @xmath139for which the total energy @xmath129 is minimal and @xmath140for the case @xmath141 considered in this place , the exciton bound energy @xmath142 in the units taken in the paper .",
    "( in fact , this energy is even larger due to repulsion between the excitons ) . throughout the paper",
    "it is assumed that @xmath5thus , @xmath143 as well as above in the case @xmath130 . also , for the concentration ( [ eq8 - 0 ] ) , the average distance between the carriers is of the order of @xmath144 @xmath145 at the same time , for @xmath141 the exciton in - plane radius @xmath146 thus , the exciton in - plane radius @xmath147 exceeds the average distance between the carriers , what has no sense .",
    "thus , both in the case @xmath130 and in the case @xmath141 the ground state of the system of spatially separated electrons and holes in the cqw is the electron - hole liquid .",
    "let us return to the case @xmath152an interesting feature of the results obtained is that both the bound energy ( [ eq6 ] ) and the equilibrium concentration ( [ eq7 ] ) of the electron - hole liquid in the cqw do not depend on the parameter @xmath20 this is in spite of the fact that formally this parameter was supposed to be large .",
    "this circumstance allows us to expect that the liquid equilibrium electron - hole state in the cqw may arise even for @xmath153 however , for @xmath154 the kinetic energy , which is of the order of @xmath155 plays an insignificant role in the formation of the equilibrium state .",
    "the equilibrium within the electron - hole system is reached due to balance between the positive direct coulomb interaction ( [ eq2.2111 ] ) and the negative _ in - layer _ correlation energy ( [ eq4.31 ] ) .",
    "let us pay attention to the interesting feature of the origin for the correlation energy associated with the rpa diagram .",
    "the correlation energy contribution results from the momentum transfer @xmath156 this conclusion strongly differs from that of gell - mann and brueckner who considered the many - body correlations for a @xmath157 electron gas . within their approach",
    ", the correlation energy originates from the momentum transfer @xmath158 let us also point out additional arguments which approve the rpa approximation .",
    "while the gell - mann and brueckner approach is justified for @xmath159 our approach holds for an arbitrary concentration @xmath11 provided that @xmath3 is large .",
    "let us investigate how the results obtained can be associated with the experiments .",
    "below , we follow the scenario proposed by keldysh for the electron - hole liquid formation in semiconductors@xcite . consider a non - equilibrium inhomogeneous electron - hole system in the cqw , composed of two coexisting phase : a rare exciton gas phase and a dense electron - hole liquid drops .",
    "let @xmath160 be the characteristic radius of the drop and @xmath161 be the carrier ( electron or hole ) lifetime within this drop . then , the loss of the carriers per unit time for the drop is @xmath162 on the other hand , there exists an exciton flow @xmath163 in the gas phase , induced by an external source .",
    "this flow gains the number of carriers in the drop per unit time @xmath164 in the dynamic equilibrium , the loss and the gain balance each other , resulting in the dependence@xmath165the concept of the electron - hole drop in the cqw fails if @xmath166therefore , there exists a threshold value for the flow@xmath167which provides the formation of the drop .",
    "thus , if the flow @xmath163 is weak , the drop has no time to form .",
    "such a scenario may account for the appearance of luminescent rings in the cqw in the series of experiments @xcite .",
    "these rings , sometimes , are associated with the exciton bose condensate . however , in our opinion , they should be connected with the electron - hole liquid drop described above .",
    "first of all for these experiments , the criterion of the exciton existence @xmath168 seems to be violated .",
    "however , suppose that the core of the ring under the experiments is illuminated by the external optical pump resulting in the creation of the exciton gas flow @xmath163 within the core .",
    "then , the ring corresponds to the electron - hole liquid phase described above .",
    "it follows from eq .",
    "( [ eq9 ] ) that the electron - hole liquid ring can dwell in the stationary state if the flow @xmath163 exceeds a certain critical value . in the experiments ,",
    "the luminescent ring appears if the optical pumping exceeds a certain power .",
    "thus , the results obtained may be the basis for the explanation of these experiments .",
    "let us mention that the correlation energy calculated above does not involve the effect of the exciton - like electron - hole correlation associated with the ladder diagrams in the electron - hole scattering channel .",
    "the involvement of this effect would result in the appearance of the nonvanishing anomalous exciton - like averages responsible for the creation of the dielectric gap on the fermi surface@xcite .",
    "however , the contribution of these diagrams into correlation energy is small in the parameters @xmath59this makes insignificant their influence on the thermodynamics of the system , the main subject of the paper ."
