    "in this paper we consider the spaces @xmath3 of imbeddings of the circle into @xmath2 and the spaces @xmath6 of imbeddings of the real line into @xmath2 with fixed behavior at infinity , namely , imbeddings that coincide with a fixed imbedded line in @xmath2 outside a compact subset .",
    "when @xmath7 one can define , using configuration space integrals , chain maps from certain graph complexes @xmath8 or @xmath9 to the de  rham complexes of the spaces of imbeddings : @xmath10 we will use the same symbol @xmath11 also for the induced maps in cohomology .",
    "our main interest is to determine which algebraic structures are preserved by the maps @xmath11 .    on the one side , in fact ,",
    "the de  rham complexes are differential graded commutative algebras .",
    "moreover , there exist a multiplication @xmath12 given by attaching the end of the first imbedding to the beginning of the second , and rescaling .",
    "this operation is non - associative but gives rise , together with the cup product , to a hopf algebra structure on @xmath13 for @xmath7 . indeed , as shown in @xcite , the multiplication is part of an action of the operad of little 2-cubes on @xmath6 .    on the other side ,",
    "we show in section  [ sec : alg ] that @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( whose definitions are recalled in section  [ grcoho ] ) can be endowed , respectively , with a differential algebra and a differential hopf algebra structure .",
    "the existence of these algebraic structures implies in particular the existence of infinitely many nontrivial classes of trivalent cocycles of even type ( see section  [ sec : inf ] ) , and , as a consequence of the results of @xcite , of infinitely many nontrivial elements of @xmath14 , for every even @xmath15 .",
    "the central result of the paper , contained in section  [ sec : hopf ] , is that , for @xmath7 , the maps @xmath11 in cohomology respect all the above algebraic structures .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : anomaly ] we consider the case @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( the case of vassiliev invariants ) and we give a new interpretation of the so - called `` anomaly '' term @xcite as the obstruction for the bott ",
    "taubes map from trivalent cocycles to vassiliev invariants to be a coalgebra map .    as a final remark",
    ", we recall that there exist other approaches to study the cohomology of spaces of imbeddings based on graph cohomology @xcite",
    ". it would be interesting to understand our results in these other contexts .",

    "we briefly recall the definition of the _ graph complexes _ given in @xcite , section 4 .",
    "a graph consists of an _ oriented circle _ and many _ edges _ joining vertices .",
    "the vertices lying on the circle are called _ external vertices _ , those lying off the circle are called _ internal vertices _ and are required to be at least trivalent .",
    "we define the order @xmath18 of a graph to be minus its euler characteristic , and the degree @xmath19 to be the deviation of the graph from being trivalent , namely : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the number of edges , @xmath22 the number of internal vertices and @xmath23 the number of external vertices of the graph .",
    "the graph complexes @xmath8 depend only on the parity of @xmath4 , and we will denote by @xmath24 and @xmath25 the real vector spaces generated by decorated graphs of order @xmath26 and degree @xmath27 , of odd and even type , respectively .",
    "the type of a graph depends on the decoration which we put on it . by definition ,",
    "the decoration in @xmath24 is given by numbering all the vertices ( with the convention that we first number the external vertices and then the internal ones ) and orienting the edges .",
    "then one takes the quotient by the following relations : a cyclic permutations of the external vertices or a permutation of the internal vertices multiplies the graph by the sign of the permutation , a reversal of an orientation of an edge produces a minus sign .",
    "an extra decoration is needed on edges connecting the same external vertex , namely an ordering of the two half - edges forming them .",
    "the decoration in @xmath25 is given by numbering the external vertices and numbering the edges , while the relations are as follows : a cyclic permutations of the external vertices or a permutation of the edges multiplies the graph by the sign of the permutation .",
    "double lines and internal loops are not allowed , namely , in @xmath24 and @xmath25 we quotient by the subspace generated by all the graphs containing two edges joining the same pair of vertices and by all the graphs containing edges whose end - points are the same internal vertex .    by an _ arc _",
    "we mean a piece of the oriented circle between two consecutive vertices , and by a _ regular edge _ we mean an edge with at least one internal end - point .    the coboundary operators @xmath28 and @xmath29 are linear operators , whose action on a graph @xmath30 is given by the signed sum of all the graphs obtained from @xmath30 by contracting , one at a time , all the regular edges and arcs of the graphs .",
    "the signs are as follows : if we contract an arc or edge connecting the vertex @xmath31 with the vertex @xmath32 , and oriented from @xmath31 to @xmath32 , then the sign is @xmath33 if @xmath34 or @xmath35 if @xmath36 . if we contract an edge labeled by @xmath37 , then the sign is @xmath38 where @xmath23 is the number of external vertices of the graph .",
    "the decoration on @xmath30 induces a decoration on the contracted graphs as follows : contraction of the edge between the vertex @xmath31 and the vertex @xmath32 produces a new vertex labeled by @xmath39 while the vertex labels greater than @xmath40 are rescaled by one .",
    "similarly when the edge labeled by @xmath37 is collapsed , the edge labels greater than @xmath37 are rescaled by one .",
    "the complexes @xmath41 and @xmath42 are defined in the same manner , except that instead of graphs with an oriented circle we consider graphs with an _",
    "oriented line_.    the cohomology groups with respect to the above coboundary operators will be denoted by @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "when we do not want to specify the parity of these complexes we simply write @xmath47 or @xmath48 .",
    "moreover we set @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52",
    "suppose that @xmath53 and @xmath54 are two graphs with @xmath55 and @xmath56 external vertices , respectively .",
    "the sets @xmath57 and @xmath58 of external vertices of @xmath53 and @xmath54 respectively , are cyclically ordered .",
    "a @xmath59-shuffle is a permutation of the set @xmath60 respecting the cyclic order of @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "if @xmath61 is a @xmath59-shuffle , then we can combine @xmath53 and @xmath54 in a single graph @xmath62 with @xmath63 external vertices by placing the legs of @xmath53 and @xmath54 into distinct external vertices on an oriented circle , according to @xmath61 .",
    "we put the labels in @xmath64 as follows : the vertices and edges which come from @xmath53 are numbered in the same way as in @xmath53 .",
    "next we number the vertices coming from @xmath54 by adding to the corresponding label of @xmath54 the number of labeled vertices of @xmath53 and the edges by adding to the corresponding label of @xmath54 the number of edges of @xmath53 .",
    "if a vertex or edge is not labeled in @xmath53 or @xmath54 , it remains unlabeled in @xmath64 the multiplication @xmath65 of two graphs @xmath53 and @xmath54 is then defined as @xmath66 where the sum is taken over all the @xmath59-shuffles and @xmath67 in the above formula , @xmath68 denotes the number of edges of @xmath53 .    extending this product to @xmath69 by linearity",
    ", we obtain an associative operation called the _ shuffle product _ : @xmath70    we define a new grading @xmath71 of the graphs generating @xmath72 and @xmath73 , by considering the total number of labels of the graph : @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the total number of vertices of @xmath30 .",
    "modulo 2 , the new grading is equal to @xmath76 in the even case and to @xmath27 in the odd case . with respect to the new grading the integration maps @xmath11",
    "will be grading - preserving modulo 2 .",
    "the shuffle product is graded commutative with respect to this new grading .",
    "in fact one can easily see that @xmath77 .",
    "leibnitz rule also holds between the coboundary operator @xmath78 , which has degree @xmath79 with respect to the new grading , and the shuffle product , which has degree 0 .",
    "more precisely    [ prop : db ] @xmath80 for every @xmath81 .",
    "let @xmath61 be a @xmath59-shuffle .",
    "when we apply the coboundary operator @xmath78 to one of the graphs of @xmath64 we can either collapse an edge of @xmath53 , or collapse two external vertices of @xmath53 , or collapse an edge of @xmath54 , or collapse two external vertices of @xmath54 , or collapse an external vertex of @xmath53 with an external vertex of @xmath54 . the first and second contribution yield @xmath82 , while the third and fourth yield @xmath83 . taking into account the signs",
    "we obtain the formula @xmath84 where @xmath85 is a linear combination of the graphs obtained from @xmath64 by contracting an external vertex of @xmath53 with an external vertex of @xmath54 . now",
    ", suppose that @xmath61 brings the @xmath31th external vertex of @xmath53 next to the @xmath32th external vertex of @xmath54 in @xmath62 .",
    "collapsing the arc between these two vertices yields a contribution , called @xmath86 , to @xmath87 .",
    "then consider the @xmath59-shuffle @xmath88 obtained by composing @xmath61 with a transposition of the two vertices considered above .",
    "collapsing the arc in @xmath89 between these vertices yields the contribution @xmath90 to @xmath87 .",
    "this fact in turn implies that @xmath91 , with the sum taken over all @xmath59-shuffles .    as a consequence",
    ", @xmath92 is a differential graded commutative algebra .",
    "it also has a unit @xmath93 consisting of the graph without edges .",
    "it follows that its cohomology @xmath94 is a graded commutative algebra with unit .",
    "the product @xmath95 on @xmath48 is defined exactly as in the previous case , i.e. , as the shuffle product of two graphs .",
    "the unit * 1 * is the graph with no edges .",
    "in addition we have a comultiplication @xmath96 mapping a graph @xmath30 to the signed sum of @xmath97 over all possible ways to cut @xmath30 into two disconnected parts @xmath98 and @xmath99 by removing an internal point of one of the arcs of @xmath30 . by convention , if the oriented line is oriented , say , from left to right , then @xmath53 is the left - most component of @xmath100 .",
    "a graph @xmath30 is primitive if it can not be disconnected in a nontrivial way by removing an internal point of an arc , and in this case @xmath101 . to fix the signs in the general case , first of all we order the primitive subgraphs of @xmath30 with respect to the oriented line , and assume that the labels are compatible with this ordering ( i.e. , all labels of a primitive subgraph are less than any label of a subsequent one ) .",
    "the decoration induced by @xmath30 on @xmath98 and @xmath99 is determined by rescaling the labels of @xmath99 and @xmath102 where @xmath103 is given in eq .  .",
    "we also define a counit @xmath104 by @xmath105 if @xmath106 and @xmath107 .    with the above definitions ,",
    "@xmath108 is a differential graded commutative hopf algebra with unit .",
    "the leibnitz rule and the graded commutativity of the shuffle product hold just as for @xmath69 , and one can easily verify the coassociativity of the coproduct and the compatibility between product and coproduct .",
    "the coboundary operator @xmath78 induces a coboundary operator on @xmath109 by setting @xmath110 on the generators and extending this definition to @xmath111 by linearity .",
    "then one has the following equation @xmath112 in fact , it easy to check that , for any graph @xmath30 , the explicit expression for @xmath113 contains the same graphs ( with the same signs ) of the explicit expression for @xmath114 .",
    "finally , since this bialgebra is @xmath115-graded and the only element in degree zero is the unit , the antipode is automatically defined .",
    "if we pass to the dual , then our algebraic structures correspond to the ones considered in @xcite ( see also @xcite for the degree zero in the odd case ) .",
    "a consequence of the algebra structure on @xmath116 is the following    [ nonzerop ] for every @xmath117 we have @xmath118    it is well known that the odd - case analogue of this proposition holds , thanks to the existence of vassiliev knot invariants at any order @xcite .",
    "let us denote by the @xmath119 the graph cocycle of figure  [ ec2 ] .",
    "we want to show that , for every @xmath120 , the @xmath121th power of @xmath122 is nontrivial . first , we notice that @xmath123 and hence , thanks to proposition  [ prop : db ] , we also have @xmath124",
    ". moreover @xmath125 can not be @xmath126-exact since it has degree zero and there are no graphs of negative degree .",
    "therefore , it is enough to prove that , for every @xmath127 , the cocycle @xmath125 is a linear combination of graphs with at least one coefficient different from zero .",
    "let us denoted by @xmath128 the graph represented in figure  [ xyn ] .",
    "this graph has @xmath121 triples of edges are attached on the external circle in such a way that they do not overlap .",
    "we will prove by induction that the coefficient of @xmath128 in @xmath125 is different from zero for every @xmath120 .",
    "the proof of this fact for @xmath129 goes as follows : in the shuffle product @xmath130 there are exactly three contributions to @xmath54 , all coming from @xmath131 . since each of these three contributions has coefficient @xmath132 , we have that the coefficient of @xmath54 in @xmath133 is different from zero .",
    "next , we suppose that the coefficient of @xmath134 in @xmath135 is different from zero , and we observe that all the contributions to the graph @xmath128 in @xmath125 arise from the shuffle product of @xmath134 with @xmath53 .",
    "an easy computation shows that these contributions are all equal up to an even permutation of labels , and hence they can not cancel out .",
    "it is known from @xcite , theorem 1.1 , that the maps @xmath136 are injective for every @xmath7 .",
    "this means that each of the graph cocycles of the above proposition produces a nontrivial cohomology class of @xmath3 for every even @xmath15 .",
    "hence we have : for any @xmath137 and for any positive integer @xmath138 , there are nontrivial cohomology classes on @xmath3 of degree greater than @xmath138 .",
    "we now recall how the maps of eqs .   and are constructed ( see @xcite for further details ) .",
    "we consider the fiber bundle @xmath139 whose fiber over a given imbedding @xmath140 is the compactified configuration space of @xmath141 points in @xmath2 , the first @xmath142 of which are constrained on @xmath140 .",
    "let us fix a symmetric volume form @xmath143 on @xmath144 , namely a normalized top form satisfying the additional condition @xmath145 , where @xmath37 is the antipodal map .",
    "a tautological form @xmath146 is by definition the pull - back to @xmath147 of @xmath143 via the smooth map @xmath148",
    "which , on the interior of @xmath147 , is defined as @xmath149 for @xmath150 we use instead the map : @xmath151 where @xmath152 is a component of the compactified configuration space of @xmath142 points on @xmath0 , @xmath153 forgets the @xmath154 points not lying on the imbedding , @xmath155 is the projection on the @xmath31th point and @xmath156 is the normalized derivative @xmath157 .    for any given graph @xmath158 with @xmath142 external vertices and @xmath154 internal vertices ,",
    "we construct a differential form @xmath159 on @xmath147 by associating the tautological form @xmath146 to the edge connecting the vertices @xmath31 and @xmath32 , and taking the wedge product of these forms over all the edges of @xmath30 .",
    "then @xmath160 is set to be the integral of @xmath159 along the fibers of @xmath139 .",
    "the map @xmath11 extended by linearity to @xmath47 takes value in @xmath161 .",
    "similarly , one can define @xmath162 .",
    "+ let us now turn to the algebraic structures in the case of imbeddings of @xmath0 into @xmath2 . we know from @xcite , theorem 4.4 , that the integration map @xmath163 is a chain map for @xmath7 .",
    "an easy check shows that the shuffle product correspond exactly to the wedge product of configuration space integrals .",
    "therefore we have :    the integration map @xmath164 is a homomorphism of differential algebras with unit for @xmath7 .",
    "next we consider @xmath6 .",
    "[ chl ] the integration map @xmath165 is a chain a map for @xmath7 .",
    "the only difference with respect to the case of imbeddings of the circle is that now one has to consider also faces describing points on the imbedding escaping to infinity , possibly along with external points .",
    "a main feature of the compactified configuration spaces is that they split near the codimension - one faces in a product of the configurations collapsing to a certain point ( or escaping at the point `` infinity '' ) and the configurations which remain far from this collapsing point . since the imbeddings are fixed outside a compact set , the integration along the faces at infinity yields zero unless the form degree of the integrand is zero on the first component ( i.e. , the configurations escaping at infinity ) .",
    "this implies that an entire connected component of a graph has to escape to infinity : in fact , whenever exactly one argument of a tautological form goes to infinity , the form degree is entirely carried by the point escaping at infinity as a consequence of @xmath166 if however a connected subgraph @xmath30 yields a zero form after integration on the face at infinity , the relation @xmath167 should hold ( where again @xmath21 is the number of edges , @xmath23 the number of external vertices and @xmath22 the number of internal vertices of @xmath30 ) . but in a graph whose vertices are at least trivalent @xmath168 is nonnegative .",
    "the proof of the next proposition is exactly as for @xmath3 .",
    "the integration map @xmath169 is a homomorphism of differential algebras with unit for @xmath7 .",
    "we now want to define a coproduct on @xmath170 . in the following we will call _ long knots _ the elements of @xmath6 .",
    "we first fix some convention in the definition of @xmath6 ; namely , we choose a basis @xmath171 of @xmath2 such that all the elements of @xmath6 coincide , outside a compact subset , with the reference imbedding @xmath172",
    ". then we observe that two long knots @xmath173 and @xmath174 can be composed to a new long knot @xmath175 by @xmath176 where @xmath177 and @xmath178 are any pair of diffeomorphisms , e.g. , @xmath179 .",
    "roughly speaking we are attaching @xmath173 and @xmath174 one after the other .",
    "the product @xmath27 has a unit @xmath21 given by the linear imbedding @xmath180 used to define @xmath6 .",
    "the pullback of the product @xmath181 defines a non - coassociative coproduct @xmath182 where @xmath183 denotes the topological tensor product of frchet spaces .",
    "the evaluation at @xmath21 defines a counit @xmath184 : @xmath185    we observe however that the non - coassociative coproduct @xmath186 gives rise to an associative operation in cohomology ( in fact the product @xmath27 is associative up to a homotopy given by composing the long knot with a suitable diffeomorphism of @xmath1 ) .",
    "more precisely , we have :    @xmath187 is a graded commutative and cocommutative hopf algebra for @xmath7 .",
    "as shown in @xcite , there exists an action of the little 2-cubes operad @xmath188 on @xmath6 .",
    "this means that there are operations on the space @xmath6 corresponding to each element of @xmath188 .",
    "in particular , it turns out that one of these operations is the multiplication @xmath27 described above . passing on the cochain level we obtain an action of operad @xmath189 on @xmath170 , which give rise in cohomology to an action of the operad @xmath190 on @xmath13 . since the operad @xmath190 is the linear dual of the gerstenhaber operad , we have that the coproduct is coassociative and cocommutative .",
    "the compatibility between the wedge product and the coproduct is obvious .",
    "finally , the existence of the antipode follows from the fact that @xmath13 is @xmath115-graded with only one element in degree zero .    a more explicitly proof of the cocommutativity of the coproduct is based on the observation that the composition @xmath27 of two long knots is commutative up to homotopy .",
    "in fact , one can shrink one of the two long knots in a very small region and slide it along the other long knot ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "our central result is then the following [ main ] the map @xmath191 is a hopf algebra homomorphism for @xmath7 .",
    "first , we notice that for @xmath7 , the degree of the differential form @xmath160 is zero if and only if @xmath192 .",
    "therefore we have @xmath193 .",
    "we now have to show that the coproducts are compatible ; viz .",
    ", @xmath194 to prove this , consider any two cycles @xmath195 and @xmath196 ( of degree @xmath26 and @xmath121 ) of imbeddings .",
    "let @xmath197 be the @xmath198-cycle obtained by attaching the two cycles : @xmath199    identity   is equivalent to @xmath200 for any @xmath195 and @xmath196 and for any @xmath201 , where we write @xmath202 .    to prove , let us introduce the @xmath203-chain @xmath204 by @xmath205 with @xmath206 . in practice",
    "we are moving the support of the cycles @xmath195 and @xmath196 far apart , and the parameter @xmath207 measure the distance between the two cycles .",
    "since @xmath208 and since @xmath11 is a chain map ( lemma  [ chl ] ) , by stokes theorem we get @xmath209 with @xmath210 let us write our graph cocycle as @xmath211 .",
    "each @xmath212 can be split into two parts as follows .",
    "we fix @xmath213 and suppose @xmath214 has @xmath142 external vertices and @xmath154 internal vertices",
    ". then we define @xmath215 to be the subbundle of @xmath147 where the points corresponding to the external vertices of every primitive subgraph of @xmath214 lie either all to the left of @xmath207 or all to the right of @xmath216 .",
    "we also let @xmath217 be the fiberwise complement of @xmath215 in @xmath147 .",
    "now we define @xmath218 , @xmath219 , to be the integral of the differential form @xmath220 performed along the fibers of @xmath221 .",
    "finally we set @xmath222 and we have @xmath223 .",
    "one immediately sees that @xmath224 is equal to the right - hand side of eq .  , and",
    "hence what we have to prove is that @xmath225    we now need a generalization of lemma 10 of @xcite .",
    "let @xmath30 be a connected graph with @xmath23 external vertices and @xmath22 internal vertices , and let @xmath159 be the product of tautological forms associated to the graph @xmath30 .",
    "we denote by @xmath226 the integral of @xmath159 over the internal vertices of @xmath30 , namely the push - forward of @xmath159 along the map @xmath227 that forgets the internal points .",
    "let us write @xmath226 in coordinates as @xmath228 , where @xmath11 is a multi - index .",
    "suppose moreover that @xmath229 a sequence in the configuration space with the property that there is a pair of points whose distance diverges as @xmath230 goes to infinity .",
    "[ lemma1 ] with the above notations , we have @xmath231    case 1 .",
    "we consider first the case when @xmath30 has no edges whose end - points are both external .",
    "then @xmath226 turns out to be bounded whenever its arguments @xmath232 run in a bounded subdomain of @xmath2 ( namely , @xmath226 do not diverge if two or more points collapse ) .",
    "we can always suppose that the pair of points whose distance diverges fastest are @xmath233 and @xmath234 .",
    "using the translation invariance of the integral , we also suppose @xmath235 .",
    "therefore we have that @xmath236 as @xmath237 .",
    "we claim that if we rescale all the variables by @xmath238 we get @xmath239 where @xmath240 .",
    "in fact , when performing the integral along the fibers of @xmath227 , it is convenient to rescale the integration variables by @xmath238 .",
    "this yields the contribution @xmath241 . at this point",
    "the tautological forms @xmath146 , whose degree is @xmath242 and whose number is the same as the number of edges @xmath21 , are obtained by rescaling the arguments of the functions @xmath243 , and this yields the contribution @xmath244 . moreover , using the fact that @xmath245 and @xmath246 , we have @xmath247 now , @xmath248 is bounded for every @xmath249 , and hence the quantity @xmath250 remains bounded when @xmath251 goes to infinity .",
    "this proves the first case .",
    "when @xmath30 has edges whose end - points are both external , we denote by @xmath252 the same graph with these edges removed .",
    "we have then @xmath253 where @xmath254 is the product of the functions associated to the removed edges .",
    "if @xmath252 is the empty graph , then there is at least one edge whose end - points go far apart .",
    "since the imbeddings are fixed outside a compact set , asymptotically @xmath254 is the pull - back of a volume form via a constant function , i.e. , @xmath254 vanishes in the limit @xmath237 .",
    "if @xmath252 is non empty but connected we are done by the argument in case 1 .",
    "the last possibility is when @xmath252 is non empty and disconnected .",
    "if inside a connected component there is a pair of points whose distance diverges , we are also done by the argument in case 1 , otherwise there is at least one edge whose end - points go far apart , and in this case @xmath254 goes to zero .",
    "we now show that eq .",
