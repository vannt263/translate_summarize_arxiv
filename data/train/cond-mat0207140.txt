    "the very last years have seen a growth of interest in disordered models defined on bethe - lattices - like topologies , that is finite connectivity random graphs ( see e.g. ref.@xcite ) .",
    "appropriate generalizations of mean - field theory are exact on such structures allowing for an exact solution of spin - glass like models",
    ". the presence of large loops may induce frustration leading to highly non trivial properties at low enough temperatures .",
    "interacting models defined over finite connectivity graphs provide a better approximation to finite - dimensional models than fully connected mean - field models , allowing for qualitatively new effects to be discussed . at zero temperature ,",
    "spin glass like models over random graphs correspond to some random combinatorial optimization problems of central relevance in theoretical computer science @xcite .",
    "quite in general , spin glass models show an interesting phase diagram in the @xmath1 plane ( see e.g. fig.2 in @xcite ) , where @xmath2 is a parameter proportional to the mean connectivity of the underlying random graph and @xmath3 is the temperature .",
    "the frozen phase is located at high @xmath2 and/or low @xmath3 .",
    "open questions are , for example , the exact location of the critical lines ( dynamic and static ones ) , the full characterization of the configurational space in the frozen phase ( e.g.  ground state energy and threshold energies ) , etc ...    here we focus on the simplest non trivial model that can be defined on a random graph with finite mean connectivity , namely the @xmath0-spin model .",
    "we concentrate on the zero temperature limit , which corresponds to the @xmath0-xorsat problem in theoretical computer science @xcite .    in this",
    "limit the model undergoes two relevant phase transitions @xcite .",
    "the first one takes place at @xmath4 ( for @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) and corresponds to a clustering phenomenon : for @xmath7 all the ground states ( gs ) form a unique cluster , while for @xmath8 they split into an exponentially large ( in @xmath9 ) number of clusters , each one containing an exponential number of gs .",
    "this clustering phenomenon coincides with the formation , in the configurational space , of barriers ( clusters are well defined only because of the presence of barriers ) and of metastable states , which make any greedy search algorithm inefficient .",
    "this is why it is usually called _ dynamic transition _",
    "the second phase transition takes place at @xmath10 ( for @xmath5 , @xmath11 ) and marks the sat / unsat transition , that is the point where frustration becomes manifest in the system and the gs energy becomes larger than zero .",
    "we will derive the above scenario via two distinct and complementary methods .",
    "the first one is the _ cavity method_. its power relies in its generality , since it can be applied easily to more complex systems too , e.g.  random k - sat @xcite . within this method",
    "the above scenario can be obtained using an ansatz with a single step of replica symmetry breaking ( 1rsb ) .",
    "the second method is a _ rigorous derivation _ based on the ` leaf removal ' algorithm which is able to reduce the random ( hyper)graph to its relevant _",
    "core_. on the core , any interesting quantity ( e.g.  the number of gs , cluster size and distance ) can be easily calculated , since annealed averages coincide with quenched ones .",
    "this rigorous derivation is of great importance also because this is one of the few cases @xcite where a highly non trivial scenario , previously obtained with a replica calculation @xcite , can be confirmed with rigorous methods .",
    "these results confirm the validity of the cavity approach , and may open the way towards the construction of mathematical bases for the parisi s replica symmetry breaking theory @xcite .",
    "the random @xmath0-xorsat problem consists in finding an assignment to @xmath9 boolean variables @xmath12 , such that a set of @xmath13 parity checks on these variables are satisfied .",
    "each parity check is of the kind @xmath14 where , for each @xmath15 , the @xmath0 indices @xmath16 are chosen randomly and uniformly among the @xmath17 possible @xmath0-uples of distinct indices , and the ` coupling ' @xmath18 takes randomly value 0 or 1 with equal probability .",
    "the above set of constraints can be written in a more compact way as @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is a @xmath21 random sparse matrix with exactly @xmath0 ones per row and @xmath22 is a random vector of @xmath23s and @xmath24s .",
    "once the mapping @xmath25 and @xmath26 is performed , the xorsat problem can be also studied as the zero - temperature limit of the following @xmath0-spin hamiltonian giving the energy for a configuration of @xmath9 ising spins @xmath27 : @xmath28 unfrustrated ground states ( gs ) configurations have zero energy and correspond to solutions of the xorsat problem , since they satisfy all the constraints : @xmath29 .",
    "in this section we shall display the analysis of the phase diagram of the @xmath0-spin problem as it arises from the one - step cavity approach .",
    "we consider the cavity formalism directly at zero temperature as discussed by mzard and parisi @xcite and developed further in @xcite .",
    "we refer to those papers for a review of the method and the notations . here",
    "we shall limit ourselves to the technical aspects of the analytical calculation for @xmath5 case , generalizations to @xmath31 being straightforward .",
    "the zero temperature @xmath0-spin model can be viewed as a relatively simple limit case of more general problems such as random k - sat for which the cavity calculations have also been carried out recently @xcite .",
    "the main technical difference between random k - sat like problems and the @xmath0-spin model consists in the fact that the site dependence of the functional order parameter simplifies dramatically in the @xmath0-spin problem below the static transition .",
    "this allows for a rigorous derivation of the cavity and replica results by alternative methods , as we shall thoroughly discuss in the subsequent sections .     and",

    "and so on .",
    "we call these numbers the _ depth _ of a vertex : vertices of depth 1 represent the ` external boundary ' or the ` surface ' of the hypergraph .    the evolution of this `` collective '' leaf removal process can be described in terms of the same function @xmath260 used previously . at each time",
    "step a depth is assigned to a fraction @xmath260 of vertices and then the time is increased by @xmath261 , in order to take into account the deletion of hyperedges leaving from the just numbered vertices .",

    "once depths have been assigned , there is an algorithm ( described below ) which allows one to change the value to any floppy variable , by adjusting , at the same time , only @xmath256 other floppy variables .",
    "such a new configuration will be a finite distance far apart , and , by definition , will belong to the same cluster . in this way",
    "one can change the configuration of the floppy ( and non - core ) variables to any admissible one , and these configurations will form a unique cluster .    the physical idea behind the algorithm for flipping any floppy variable , keeping all the interactions satisfied , and adjusting only a finite number of other variables , is the following .",
    "suppose , as in fig .",
    "[ nc ] , that we flip the variable of depth 5 .",
    "then the interactions it participates to will be unsatisfied , and we have to move this ` excess energy ' by flipping other variables , along the shortest way , towards the boundaries of the hypergraph , that is the vertices of depth 1 , where it can be freely released .",
    "the only delicate point is the definition of the ` path to the boundary ' , which has to contain a finite number of vertices . in fig .",
    "[ nc ] we show a possible way to release the excess energy generated by flipping variable of depth 5 : flipping all the variables belonging the tree - like bold structure will keep all the interactions satisfied , since every interaction contains an even number of vertices belonging to the bold structure .",
    "we will call this tree - like structure a _ seaweed _ , since it has a root , corresponding to the vertex of maximum depth , and the number of its branches grows approaching the surface .",
    "now we give the rules for constructing a seaweed , such that its size is finite .",
    "let us start with some nomenclature : we say that a hyperedge @xmath274 is `` below '' a vertex @xmath275 , and analogously @xmath275 is `` above '' @xmath274 , if the depth of @xmath275 is the smallest among the depths of all the vertices in @xmath274 .",
    "thanks to the way depths have been assigned , each vertex may have at most 1 hyperedge below .",
    "this property can be easily proved , remembering that to any given vertex @xmath275 the depth is assigned only when its connectivity is 0 or 1 .",
    "at this time , all the other hyperedges of @xmath275 have been removed , since we have assigned smaller depths to its neighbours .",
    "the only hyperedge which can be below @xmath275 is the last one .",
    "moreover , if the depth is assigned to @xmath275 when its connectivity is 0 ( isolated vertex ) , the vertex @xmath275 will have no hyperedges below , and we will call it a _ root_.    the construction of the seaweed starts from the vertex corresponding to the variable that we want to flip ( let us call it _ seed _ ) . in this way we are sure that such a vertex will be in the structure , and the corresponding variable flipped .",
    "the seaweed is built up recursively , that is we give the rules for growing a single branch , both upwards ( i.e.  towards the surface ) and downwards ( i.e.  towards a root ) , and then these rules must be applied to any branch of the seaweed , until it reaches the surface of the hypergraph or a root vertex .",
    "the branches are such that along an upwards ( downwards ) direction the depth strictly decreases ( increases ) .",
    "rare exceptions to this property will be illustrated below .",
    "when a branch passes through a hyperedge it will visit only 2 vertices in this hyperedge , such that , when all the variables belonging to the seaweed will be flipped , the interaction will remain satisfied .",
    "suppose the seed vertex has connectivity @xmath83 .",
    "then we start @xmath83 different branches , 1 downwards entering the only hyperedge below the seed vertex and @xmath276 upwards entering the other hyperedges .",
    "any upwards branch entering a hyperedge @xmath274 through vertex @xmath275 has to be continued with the vertex above @xmath274 .",
    "if there are many vertices of the same minimum depth in @xmath274 , any of them can be chosen equivalently . with this rule",
    "we are ensuring that the new vertex added to the upwards branch is of smaller depth than @xmath275 .",
    "any downwards branch entering hyperedge @xmath274 through vertex @xmath275 has to be continued with the vertex of maximum depth in @xmath274 .",
    "if there are many vertices of the same maximum depth in @xmath274 , any of them can be chosen equivalently . with this rule",
    "we can ensure that the new vertex added to the downwards branch will be deeper than @xmath275 , since @xmath275 is of minimum depth in @xmath274 .",
    "any growing branch reaching a vertex @xmath275 of connectivity @xmath83 has to be continued with @xmath276 branches , in order to satisfy the rule that all the hyperedges of @xmath275 must be visited by a branch .",
    "if the just reached vertex is on the surface ( i.e.  it has depth 1 and connectivity 1 ) the branch ends there .",
    "on the contrary , reaching a vertex of connectivity larger than 2 , the growing branch generates new branches .",
    "more in particular , if the branch is an upwards one it will generate only upwards branches ( since it is coming from the only hyperedge below @xmath275 ) . while , if it is the downwards one , it may generate at most one downwards branch ( all the rest being upwards ones ) .",
    "this is a consequence of the property that every vertex may have at most 1 hyperedge below it .    in two cases the unique downwards branch ends in a vertex @xmath275 , which is thus the root of the seaweed : ( 1 )",
    "@xmath275 is a root vertex , that is it has no hyperedges below it ( 2 ) vertex @xmath275 is above hyperedge @xmath274 , but @xmath275 is not the only vertex of minimum depth in @xmath274 . in this case",
    "the branch entering @xmath274 through @xmath275 becomes an upwards one , and makes a single step without decreasing the depth ( this is the only exception to the rule on the monotonicity of the depth along a branch stated above ) .",
    "since each branch of the seaweed is grown independently , it may be that a the end of the process some vertices result in more than one branch .",
    "this is not a problem : the rule says that every vertex which has been included an odd number of times in the seaweed must be in it ; while those entering an even number of times must be left out .",
    "the net result is a decrease in the total number of vertices in the structure .",
    "the seaweed can eventually break up in more than a single connected component : all the components , but that containing the seed , can be removed from the seaweed .",
    "the choice of growing the branches always along vertices of maximum and minimum depths is dictated by the need of reaching a root vertex and the surface of the hypergraph as soon as possible , thus making the seaweed as small as possible .",
    "it is worth noticing that the probability that a vertex is a root increases for larger depths .",
    "the last point to be proven is that the typical distance , @xmath277 , measured along any branch , among the root of the seaweed and the surface , is finite ( and not order @xmath278 ) .",
    "this property together with the fact that the branching ratio is proportional to the connectivity , which is finite too , implies that the number of vertices in the seaweed , which is roughly proportional to @xmath279 , is finite . on the contrary",
    "if @xmath277 would be of order @xmath278 , the volume of the seaweed would diverge for large @xmath9 .    in order to show that @xmath277 is finite ,",
    "even when the root depth is as large as possible ( i.e.  order @xmath278 ) , we need to know the probability that a vertex has depth @xmath36 .",
    "this probability distribution function , @xmath280 , can be calculated exactly , but its expression is too involved to be presented here .",
    "we only report some features relevant for our purposes .",
    "it depends on the connectivity of the vertex , @xmath281 , and for @xmath282 or @xmath283 it is trivially given by @xmath284 . for any @xmath285 ,",
    "it decreases exponentially fast for large @xmath36 , and the probability of reaching a vertex ( not on the surface ) of depth @xmath36 is @xmath286 for large @xmath36 . for the present calculation",
    "the exact shape of @xmath287 at small depths is irrelevant , and we only care about its tail , so we can hereafter use @xmath288 for all @xmath36 .",
    "we show now that , with such a distribution of depths , even starting from a root of depth @xmath269 , an upwards branch needs only a finite number of steps to reach the surface ( for simplicity we fix to 0 , instead of 1 , the surface depth ) .",
    "the probability of going in a single step from depth @xmath289 to depth @xmath32 is @xmath290 which has the correct normalization @xmath291 .",
    "the probability of going from depth @xmath36 to depth 0 in @xmath15 steps is then      where the primed sum is over the @xmath293 intermediate depths , taking different values between 1 and @xmath294 , and the inequality follows since in the last term we have included also configurations with indices taking equal values .",
    "so @xmath295 is upper bounded by a poissonian distribution with a mean number of steps @xmath296 as expected , @xmath277 is an increasing function of @xmath36 . in the limit of a very deep root , @xmath297",
    ", the series converges for any @xmath298 ( i.e.  @xmath299 ) , and thus @xmath300 is still finite ."
