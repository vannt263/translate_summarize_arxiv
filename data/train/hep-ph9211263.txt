    "lattice gauge calculations of heavy - light meson structure are of both theoretical and phenomenological interest.@xcite one immediate goal of these calculations is to obtain precise quantitative results for masses , decay constants , and form factors in the static approximation , where the heavy quark propagator is replaced by a timelike wilson line .",
    "one difficulty which plagued early , exploratory calculations of the pseudoscalar decay constant @xmath0 was the problem of isolating the ground state contribution to the propagator of the local weak current .",
    "because of the proximity of excited states and their sizeable overlap with the local current , a large separation in time was required , with an accompanying loss of statistics .",
    "recent attempts to overcome this problem have employed nonlocal @xmath5 operators ( in a fixed gauge@xcite ) smeared over a cube@xcite or wall source@xcite . by measuring the asymptotic behavior of both the smeared - smeared ( @xmath6 ) and smeared - local ( @xmath7 ) propagators",
    ", one can reduce the systematic error associated with excited state contributions .",
    "however , it is likely that such smearing functions are too crude to obtain accurate values of the parameters of the low - lying heavy - light states.@xcite this is illustrated in table  1 .",
    ".the overlap amplitudes between various cube smearing functions and the approximate wavefunctions for the ground state @xmath8 and first three excited states ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 ) for @xmath12 and @xmath13 on a @xmath14 lattice . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the typical variation between results at @xmath15 and @xmath14 are 10% or more , while the variation between @xmath14 and @xmath16 have dropped to a few percent .",
    "the validity of these model results is presently being checked by a complete analysis of heavy - light mesons on the @xmath17 and @xmath18 lattices .",
    "by using good approximate wave functions in a multistate smearing calculation , it is possible to control the systematic errors associated with extracting the decay constant from nonasymptotic time .",
    "our results are very encouraging , not only for the present calculations , but for the determination of other b - meson decay parameters and form factors .",
    "all such calculations require the external meson to be in a pure eigenstate ( i.e. on shell ) . by using the optimized smearing functions discussed here",
    ", this requirement can be met with a minimum separation between the b - meson source and the electroweak vertex , greatly improving the precision of the results .",
    "we find that at @xmath12 and @xmath19 @xmath20 the efficacy of our smearing method is even greater at @xmath21 as can be seen by comparing figs .  1 and  2 with figs .  3 and  4 with the same physical volume .",
    "in addition to ground state properties , this method allows extraction of the properties of the lowest radially and orbitally excited states .",
    "our results for these quantities are preliminary , and we expect more precise estimates to be obtained by further analysis .    further numerical studies are required to check the finite volume effects , determine the effect of using an improved action for the light quarks , and include additional light quark mass values at @xmath22 which will allow a better determination of the scaling behaviour of these properties of low - lying heavy - light states .",
    "we thank george hockney , andreas kronfeld , and paul mackenzie for joint lattice efforts without which this analysis would not have been possible .",
    "jmf thanks the nuffield foundation for support under the scheme of awards for newly appointed science lecturers .",
    "the numerical calculations were performed on the fermilab acpmaps computer system developed by the cr&d department in collaboration with the theory group .",
