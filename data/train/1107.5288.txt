    "classical molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations use either semi - empirical potentials such as stillinger - weber ( sw)@xcite , abell - tersoff - brenner@xcite or other type of force fields where the potential energy is an analytical function of the atomic positions , or first - principles potentials calculated typically using density - functional methods based on either the born - oppenheimer@xcite or the car - parrinello@xcite dynamics .",
    "the former are fast to compute but suffer from inaccuracies , while the latter are accurate but time - consuming to compute .",
    "due to recent interest in thermal transport in semiconductor materials having good thermoelectric properties and the topic of microelectronics thermal management in general , there have been many calculations of the lattice thermal conductivity of materials using the green - kubo ( gk ) formula@xcite .",
    "this formula relates the thermal conductivity , through the use of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem , to the time - integral of the heat current autocorrelation function .",
    "the latter is calculated from an md simulation , and the ensemble average is usually replaced by a time average .",
    "semi empirical potentials such as sw are usually used to perform the md simulation for a system such as si . as the thermal conductivity of a perfect crystal is mainly due to anharmonic three - phonon processes ,",
    "directly related to the third - derivatives of the potential energy with respect to atomic displacements , and the latter is generally not fitted or considered in the design of the semi - empirical potentials , there is really no good reason to expect an accurate value for the thermal conductivity calculated from a gk - md simulation . in the case of si ,",
    "when using the sw potential , however , for some reason@xcite , relatively good agreement is found between the experiment and the simulation results , even for a relatively small supercell@xcite .",
    "the latter fact is also cause for concern , because , as we will show in the following , a small supercell limits the number of long - wavelength phonons which carry a large portion of the heat in a material .",
    "the lucky agreement can be attributed to a cancellation due to two different effects , which will be discussed in section[sizescaling ] .",
    "et al._@xcite have presented a discussion on convergence issues , mostly with respect to non - equilibrium md simulations , and we will also discuss the scaling issue with respect to gk - md and lattice dynamics ( ld ) in this paper .",
    "more accurate calculations of the thermal conductivity , based on the full solution of boltzmann transport equation have shown that the thermal conductivity of si using the sw potential is about 4-times larger than the experiment , while using the tersoff or eidp potentials produce results that are about twice larger than the experimental values@xcite . in a similar work , using the environment - dependent interaction potential ( edip ) , pascual - gutierrez _",
    "et al._@xcite also find thermal conductivity of bulk si from md in good agreement with experiments . in a subsequent work@xcite ,",
    "the same group computed the thermal conductivity using the lattice dynamics ( ld ) theory based on the same edip potential , similar to the work of broido _",
    "they obtain good agreement with experiments whereas broido _",
    "the reason for this discrepancy , as they also mention in their paper , is unclear .",
    "opinions on the accuracy of semiempirical potentials seem to differ as there have been other reports@xcite where sw is found to overestimate the thermal conductivity by 70% . as we will show in this paper , some of these potentials might not be completely reliable for the calculation of the thermal transport properties for the simple reason that they were not fitted or constructed to have the correct third derivatives , which are responsible for the thermal resistivity of a material .",
    "in fact even their harmonic force constants produce phonon dispersions and elastic constants which differ from experiments by 10 up to 40% .",
    "furthermore such potentials exist and have been thouroughly tested for only a very small number of pure crystalline solids .    in a tour",
    "de force work , broido _",
    "_ , later , used the density - functional perturbation theory ( dfpt ) formalism in order to calculate the phonon scattering rates from first - principles dft calculations and were able to successfully reproduce the thermal conductivity of bulk si and ge@xcite .",
    "their approach , which was very accurate , included the calculation of all the cubic force constants up to 4 lattice parameters away , and the complete iterative solution of the boltzmann transport equation .",
    "we recently developed a methodology to extract second , third and fourth derivatives of the potential energy from first - principles calculations@xcite , and showed that the phonon dispersion relation in si can be well - reproduced . in this paper",
    ", we pursue this work further and use these derivatives to construct a force field in order to explore the results from md simulations and perturbation calculation to calculate the thermal conductivity of bulk si .",
    "we should mention that our approach , even though very similar in essence to that of broido _",
    "_ , is simpler in the sense that it limits the range of the force constants ( fcs ) to a few neighbors ( 5 for harmonic and 1 for cubic in the present case study of si , in contrast to more than 20 for harmonic and 10 for cubic in the work of broido _",
    "et al._@xcite ) . for the sake of physical correctness , however , we enforce the translational , rotational and huang invariances on the extracted force constants .",
    "so the latter are not exactly equal to the ones obtained from dfpt or any finite difference calculation of the forces , but make the calculation load much lighter than if one had to include so many neighbors . on the other hand a dfpt calculation , if restricted to few neighbors , should enforce all these invariances .",
    "usually , only the translational ones , also known as the  acoustic sum rule \" ( asr ) are enforced in some of the standard dft codes such as quantum espresso@xcite .    in",
    "what follows we briefly review the methodology to extract force constants from first - principles density - functional theory calculations ( fp - dft ) .",
    "the formalism for the molecular dynamics and green - kubo calculations of @xmath0 are explained in section ( [ mdgk ] ) .",
    "this will be followed by the lattice dynamics approach detailed in section ( [ ld ] ) .",
    "results for si will be shown and discussed in section ( [ results ] ) , followed by conclusions .",
    "we construct the potential energy @xmath1 for the md simulation as a taylor expansion up to fourth order in the atomic displacement @xmath2 of atom @xmath3 about its equilibrium position :    v&=&v_0 + _ i _",

    "if the displacements @xmath2 are around the equilibrium position , and this is usually the case , @xmath5 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath6 and @xmath7 in the expansion are called the harmonic , cubic , and quartic force constants respectively , and satisfy certain symmetry constraints .",
    "namely they must be invariant under interchange of the indices , uniform translations and rotations of the atoms , in addition to invariance under symmetry operations of the crystal .",
    "the details of the needed constraints and how they are imposed can be found in our previous work@xcite .    to get these numbers , we consider one or several supercells in which atoms are in their equilibrium position .",
    "one , two or three neighboring atoms are moved simultaneously by a small amount , typically about @xmath8 along the cartesian directions .",
    "consideration of crystal symmetry usually reduces the needed displacements .",
    "for instance in a cubic - based crystal , like silicon , where the two atoms in the primitive cell are equivalent , one only needs to move one si atom along the x direction .",
    "this is sufficient to extract all harmonic force constants if the supercell size is large enough .",
    "the latter size is chosen depending on the available computational power and the considered range of force constants .",
    "to get three- and four - body interaction terms , one needs to move two and three atoms at a time and record the forces on all atoms in the supercell .",
    "it is advantageous to record forces for atomic displacements in two opposite directions as there would be cancellation of the cubic contributions and this would make the calculation of the harmonic fcs much more accurate ( up to order @xmath9 ) . thus one would obtain a large set of force - displacement relations computed from a fp - dft code .",
    "together with the invariance constraints , an overcomplete linear set of equations on all the force constants will be formed .",
    "a singular - value decomposition algorithm is then used to solve this linear overcomplete set .",
    "we find that usually the violation of the invariance relations is of the order of @xmath10 times the fc itself .",
    "this however requires very accurate evaluation of the forces , meaning that they should have converged with respect to the cutoff energy and number of k - points to within at least 4 significant figures , if not more !",
    "our experience on graphene@xcite and silicon ( present work and reference [ @xcite ] has shown that the harmonic force constants are usually reproduced quite accurately .",
    "higher order fcs have less accuracy as their contribution shows up in the second or third or fourth significant figures of the forces .",
    "the main approximation is in cutting off the range of the interactions , which will lead to inaccuracies in some of the gruneisen parameters as we will shortly see .",
    "typically a supercell is constructed with periodic boundary conditions , and an md simulation is performed over a long enough time steps in order to reach thermal equilibrium , followed by a long ( n , v , e ) simulation in order to collect data on @xmath11 for later statistical processing , i.e time and ensemble averaging of its autocorrelation .",
    "based on the potential displayed in eq .",

    "the true current autocorrelations decay quite fast . in a single md run , however , this decay is not observed .",
    "instead one observes a decay in the amplitude followed by random oscillations about zero .",

    ", the ensemble - averaged autocorrelation function will decay smoothly to zero with time .",
    "one will then see that the decay is indeed relatively short , because the long - time tails get cancelled after ensemble averaging .",
    "the advantage of the ensemble averaging , in addition of course to the usual time averaging , is that one samples the phase space more randomly , and generates * uncorrelated * sets of pairs @xmath16 for a given time difference @xmath17 . in this case",

    "one important comment is in order here , and that is the use of @xmath22 in the denominator instead of the more intuitive @xmath23 which is the actual number of terms in the last sum .",
    "one can show that the choice in eq .",
    "( [ gk - numerical ] ) provides an unbiased estimator of the autocorrelation@xcite .",
    "some previous works in the gk method such as reference @xcite have used the  biased \" formula , which would be fine as long as the total simulation time is much larger than the largest time @xmath17 used for the integration .",
    "one simple way to become convinced that eq .",
    "( [ gk - numerical ] ) is the correct way , is to consider large times @xmath17 near the maximum simulation time @xmath18 . as @xmath24 and @xmath25 are both fluctuating random numbers , and there are not enough terms in the sum to make the average go to zero",
    ", the time average will become large again and tend to @xmath26 instead of decaying to zero as @xmath17 approaches @xmath18 .",
    "a division by the small number @xmath27 would not solve the problem , whereas the division by @xmath18 would make this very small as it should .",
    "the simulation time @xmath18 being usually quite long , the statistical error in the time averging is usually small , and we estimate the error bars in our data from the ensemble averaging : if @xmath28 is the ensemble - averaged autocorrelation function , its error bar @xmath29 is evaluated as : @xmath30^{1/2 }   /n_{\\rm ens}$ ]    the magnitude of this error bar and the required accuracy in the results determine how many ensembles are needed for a proper estimation of thermal conductivity .      for a given supercell size , there is a discrete number of phonon modes which can propagate and get scattered in the system .",
    "the largest wavelength consistent with the periodic boundary conditions would be the supercell length . to this",
    ", one can correspond a smallest phonon wavenumber or frequency allowed in the simulation : @xmath31 .",
    "the total simulation time should be large enough so that all phonon modes can get scattered a few times within the simulation period .",
    "largest relaxation times belong to acoustic modes , and usually decay as the inverse square of the phonon frequency . knowing the smallest allowed frequency @xmath32 due to the finite size of the system , one can estimate the corresponding phonon lifetime ( using klemens formula displayed in eq .",
    "( [ klemens ] ) for instance ) .",
    "the total md simulation time should therefore be a few times larger than the largest phonon lifetime so that scattering events of long wavelength phonon modes can properly be sampled during the md run .",
    "as an example , we can consider si system in a cubic 10x10x10 supercell of 8000 atoms . in this case",
    "@xmath33 nm corresponding to @xmath34 which is a fifth of the @xmath35 line .",
    "the lowest frequency mode is therefore about @xmath36 thz . as can be seen in fig .",
    "( [ gama ] ) below , the normal and umklapp lifetimes at this frequency are 3000 ps and 10000 ps respectively , leading to a total lifetime of 2300 ps .",
    "so in order to sample such rare events , one needs to calculate the autocorrelation over at least 20 ns , which means the md simulation should be run for at least the same amount of time if not longer .",
    "this could be computationally prohibitive .",
    "if the runs are made with fewer md steps long wavelength phonons will not be relaxed and the autocorrelation would not tend to zero .",
    "another consequence of this remark is that for large supercells , as relaxation times scale as @xmath37 , longer simulation times proportional to the * square * of the the supercell size would be required .",
    "as mentioned , the choice of a finite supercell comes with the cost of discretizing the phonon modes and supressing the phonons of wavelengths longer than the supercell length .",
    "the neglected contribution maybe estimated as follows : the anharmonic lifetime of acoustic modes maybe approximated by the klemens formula @xcite = _ ^2 2 k_b t m v_^2 _ ^2 _ ^max [ klemens ] where @xmath38 is the largest frequency of the branch @xmath39 , @xmath40 the mode gruneisen parameter , @xmath41 the frequency , and @xmath42 the group velocity associated with the mode @xmath43 .",
    "therefore long wavelength phonons will have a large relaxation time and can considerably contribute to the thermal conductivity . assuming this form in the relaxation time approximation to the thermal conductivity , and using eq .",
    "( [ rta ] ) , we can write the thermal conductivity as a sum over contributions of phonons of different frequencies : @xmath44    in 3d , since the density of states ( dos ) is quadratic in frequency , the contribution of long wavelength acoustic phonons would be linear in the cutoff frequency @xmath45 : @xmath46 for low frequencies @xmath47 ^ 2   \\simeq k_b$ ] and @xmath48 so that ( l ) & = & ( ) - a _ 0^_cut 1 ^ 2 dos ( ) d= ( ) - d _ cut + & = & ( ) - e 1",

    "this gives us a way to deduce how the thermal conductivity of a finite size sample scales with the supercell length or the cutoff frequency @xmath52 or mfp , @xmath51 .",
    "we should note that a different scaling law ( @xmath53 ) was also proposed and used by sellan _",
    "et al._@xcite , and also turney _",
    "et al._@xcite when they want to extrapolate their thermal conductivity data to infinite size .",
    "the argument they used to deduce it however was based on the matthiesen s rule , stating that the bulk resistivity is obtained by adding the finite size resistivity to the one obtained from @xmath54 taken as relaxation time .",
    "there is another additional problem with finite size md simulations . even though momentum is still conserved in a 3-phonon process ,",
    "because the modes are * discrete * in a finite supercell , energy conservation will not always be possible , unless the energy difference @xmath55 where @xmath56 is on the order of the sum of inverse lifetimes of the three considered phonons .",
    "if this relation is not satisfied , the considered 3-phonon scattering will not take place in a finite supercell , and this will lead to an overestimation of the lifetime of the phonons , and thus , of the thermal conductivity .    these competing effects , namely an overestimation of @xmath0 due to limited phase space for energy conservation and an underestimation due to cutoff of low frequency acoustic modes , may lead to a magical cancellation , resulting in thermal conductivities in good agreement with experiments even for moderate supercell size .",
    "this error cancellation will likely affect the temperature - dependence of @xmath0 : at higher temperatures the discreteness error is reduced as @xmath56 increases linearly with @xmath57 .",
    "the frequency cutoff error , however , will not be affected by high temperatures . consequently , as @xmath57 is increased the thermal conductivity of a finite sample will decrease faster than @xmath58 with temperature .",
    "this has been observed in the work of volz and chen@xcite .",
    "it can also be verified by introducing other scattering events such as isotope or defect scattering leading to larger @xmath56 values . in such cases ,",
    "the discreteness of modes will have little effect , and the simulated @xmath59 will be less than the exact one , due to the cutoff of long mfp phonons effect . as a result ,",
    "in a system where due to disorder or high temperatures scattering rates are high , gk - md simulations will typically require larger supercells to converge .    the correct way of estimating @xmath60 is to do a proper size scaling at each temperature by plotting @xmath61 versus @xmath62 and linearly extrapolating to @xmath63 .",
