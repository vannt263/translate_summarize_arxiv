    "@xmath0 is an electromagnetically bound state of @xmath4 and @xmath5 similar to positronium @xmath1 and @xmath2@xcite .",
    "it was theoretically predicted@xcite in 1975 but never found experimentally .",
    "qed is a well known theory to describe such type of electromagnetically bound atomic states . as in the case of hydrogen atom the hamilton operator for @xmath0 atom",
    "is h=*p*^2m_-r , where @xmath6 is the constant of fine structure@xcite , @xmath7 , @xmath8 is distance between @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "this operator differs from the hydrogen atom hamiltonian only by reduced mass . in hydrogen atom hamiltonian ,",
    "reduced mass is just the mass of electron but in case of @xmath0 atom reduced mass is @xmath9 , so the energy levels of @xmath0 are obtained easily using the corresponding reduced mass .",
    "different corrections to the hamiltonian _ eg . _ relativistic mass growth , orbital , spin - orbital , spin - spin and annihilation interactions , all give the hyperfine structure levels .",
    "perturbation hamiltonian contains only the sum of spins of particles , so the energy levels are divided into singlets ( parastates with total spin 0 ) and triplets ( orthostates with total spin 1 ) .",
    "the energy levels of the @xmath0 atom are given as for hydrogen atom with a reduced mass@xcite @xmath10 e_n =- m_^24n^2=-25n^2kev .",
    "knowing the energy spectra of this atom now we need to consider different decay channels of @xmath0 system .",
    "there are two classes of decay channels@xcite . in the first class the @xmath5 or @xmath4 decay through the weak interaction in the normal way and the atomic state disappears .",
    "the decay width is ( ( ^+^-)_b ,  decay)=2= 4.5310 ^ -3ev , where @xmath11 is lifetime of tau lepton .    in the second class of decay channels",
    "the @xmath5 and @xmath4 annihilate .",
    "the annihilation requires that the atomic wave function @xmath12 be unequal to 0 at r=0 _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath13 . here",
    "r is the distance between the @xmath5 and @xmath4 .",
    "therefore in lowest order , annihilation occurs only in l=0 state , _",
    "i.e. _ s state .",
    "the annihilation channels of @xmath14 state of @xmath0 with corresponding decay widths are following : the channel ( ^+^-)_b++ , has the width ( ( ^+^-)_b3)=2(^2 - 9)^6m_9n^3=1.9510 ^ -5ev . the two channels ( ^+^-)_be^++e^- , ( ^+^-)_b^++^- , have the same width ( ( ^+^-)_be^++e^-)=^5m_6n^3=7.0410 ^ -3ev .",
    "finally there is hadron channel ( ^+^-)_bhadrons .    for @xmath0 we can calculate the width of this channel using colliding beams @xmath3 annihilation data at @xmath15 ( e^++e^-hadrons)2(e^++e^-^++^- ) .",
    "therefore ( ( ^+^-)_bhadrons)2_ee=1.4110 ^ -2ev . neglecting @xmath16 we get the total width _ n((^+^-)_b , decay)+4_ee=(4.5 + 28.1n^3)10 ^ -3ev . using these values",
    "we can calculate production cross section of @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath0 can be produced in @xmath3 annihilation just below @xmath11 pair threshold e^++e^-_virtual(^+^-)_bcorresponding production cross section according to the breit - wigner equation , is ( e^++e^-(^+^-)_b)=34m_^2_ee(e-2m_)^2+^2/4 . here",
    "e is the total energy of @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the peak cross section is ( e^++e^-(^+^-)_b , peak)=3m_^2_ee=0.5mb.taking into account the radiative corrections@xcite we get _ r=(-4lnm_m_elnm _ ) .",
    "now we consider the possibility that initial @xmath17 or @xmath18 can radiate soft photon with 1 .",
    "the criteria of perturbative theory application in this case are lnm_m_e1,lnm_m_elnm__min1.[eq : cond ] from ( [ eq : cond ] ) it implies that we can put @xmath19 equal to the decay width of @xmath20 state of @xmath0 .",
    "the cross section of radiative production of @xmath0 is _",
    "rad=_n2n^3 ^ 6m__min(2lnm_m_e-1 ) .    as the electrons and positrons in accelerator beams have some energy spread so we should use an average value of cross section@xcite = ( e)(e)de .",
    "bepcii is an electron positron collider working in the tau - charm energy region at ihep , beijing , china .",
    "it has only one detector besiii@xcite .",
    "it is an excellent machine to produce @xmath0 .",
    "let the electrons and positrons are equally distributed in some energy interval @xmath21 near threshold . at bepcii",
    "we have @xmath22@xcite = _",
    "r2_eee=0.70pb , = _ rad_mine(lne_min-1)=13.36pb .",
    "number of events which will be produced at bepcii having luminosity @xmath23 are n=(<_r>+<_rad>)l=14.0663=886events . if suitable event selection criteria adopted @xmath0 can be observed using besiii . the cross section @xmath24 just below @xmath11 pair threshold at 3.5538 gev , with the account of all the radiative corrections is@xcite",
    "( e^++e^-^++^-)=110pb . branching ratio for @xmath25 is 0.1735 , so we have ( e^++e^-^++^-^++^-)=110(0.1735)^2=3.3pb . [ free ] branching ratio for @xmath26 is 0.21 , so the cross section is@xcite ( e^++e^-(^+^-)_b^++^-)=14.060.21=3pb .",
    "[ bound ] such a big cross section is due to the branching ratio for @xmath27 which is 0.21 in spite of 0.03 as for free @xmath28 pair . comparing `` ( [ free ] ) '' and `` ( [ bound ] ) ''",
    "we see that @xmath29 of @xmath30 events are from free @xmath28 pair and @xmath31 @xmath30 events from @xmath0 .",
    "same will be true for ee events although there will be no contribution of @xmath0 to @xmath32 events .",
    "vepp-4 m is another electron positron collider working in the 1 - 6 gev energy region at budker institute of nuclear physics , novosibirsk , russia .",
    "a precise @xmath11 lepton mass measurement performed at the vepp-4 m collider with the kedr detector has been reported recently@xcite . as in previous experiments",
    "the contribution of the bound state @xmath0 has not been taken into account .",
    "let us calculate how much @xmath0 were produced in this experiment .",
    "we asume that the electrons and positrons are equally distributed in some energy interval @xmath21 near threshold at vepp-4 m we have @xmath33 .",
    "then @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "so the number of @xmath0 produced at vepp-4 m having integrated luminosity @xmath36 at @xmath37 is n=(<_r>+<_rad>)l=18.121.60529events .",
    "these @xmath0 will contribute to ee and @xmath30 events .",
    "it is reported@xcite that at @xmath37 6 @xmath38 events were detected , this number will ultimately increase if we take into account @xmath0 and it will be a direct evidence for the existence of @xmath0 .",
    "it follows from our estimates for @xmath0 decay rates and production cross section that @xmath0 decays give a rather big number for ee and @xmath30 events at bepcii and at vepp-4 m .",
