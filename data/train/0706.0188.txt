    "in general relativity a black string becomes unstable and changes to a black hole when the circle it winds becomes large compared with its horizon .",
    "this is known as the gregory - laflamme transition @xcite ( see for review @xcite ) .",
    "similar instability exists also for neutral black @xmath0-brane wrapped on torus . in the case of square torus ,",
    "in which all compactification radii are the same , usually only a black hole and a non - uniform brane are considered as candidates of the final state , probably because they respect the symmetry of the background spacetime .",
    "however , there is no reason for adhering them - isotropy can break spontaneously , and we should also consider a decay from @xmath0-brane to @xmath1-brane .",
    "a motivation for considering such a decay comes from ads / cft correspondence @xcite . through ads / cft , the gregory - laflamme transition is related @xcite to the condensation of the spatial wilson loop winding on compact direction in dual super yang - mills theory . recently ,",
    "narayanan , neuberger and collaborators have studied phase structure of pure bosonic yang - mills theory on torus intensively @xcite . according to their result , the spatial wilson loops condensate not simultaneously but one - by - one even if compactification radii are the same .",
    "we can expect similar pattern of successive phase transitions in bosonic yang - mills on @xmath5 with @xmath6 adjoint scalars , which is the high - temperature limit of the super yang - mills on @xmath7 .",
    "then , it is plausible that dual supergravity theory also has a cascade of gregory - laflamme transitions . in this paper",
    ", we compare the free energies for several solutions in ( super)gravity using a certain approximation .",
    "the result suggests that such a phase structure exists . in iia",
    "supergravity the free energy of d@xmath0-brane - branes obtained via t - dual . ]",
    "becomes smaller than that of d@xmath1-brane at some critical temperature @xmath8 , which satisfies @xmath9 . in the case of the transition from d@xmath10- to d@xmath11-brane",
    ", the gregory - laflamme temperature appears slightly below @xmath12 .",
    "this implies that the d@xmath10-brane collapses to the d@xmath11-brane .",
    "we expect a similar pattern for any @xmath0 . in einstein gravity",
    ", we confirm this pattern explicitly for the neutral black branes ( see table [ tab:1 ] , table [ tab:1.5 ] and figure  [ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in  [ sec : scwarzschild ] we consider the neutral black branes . approximating compact directions transverse to brane with noncompact ones ,",
    "we find an indication that @xmath0-brane does not decay to @xmath11-brane directly , but its dimension decreases one - by - one , that is , @xmath0-brane decays to @xmath1-brane , then to @xmath13-brane , and so on . in  [ sec : sym ] , we summarize basic properties of weakly - coupled yang - mills theory , and then we study the phase structure of dual supergravity in  [",
    "sec : gravity ] .",
    "we find similar phase structures in both sides .",
    "this result might be an evidence of ads / cft , although the coupling region we considered are different in both sides .",
    " 5 is devoted to discussions .",
    "in this section , we calculate the free energy of neutral black @xmath0-branes winding around square torus @xmath5 and evaluate critical temperatures @xmath8 , above which @xmath1-brane has smaller free energy than @xmath0-brane .",
    "we also calculate the gregory - laflamme ( gl ) temperature @xmath15 , above which @xmath0-brane becomes unstable . in these calculations ,",
    "we approximate compact directions transverse to brane by noncompact ones because of the lack of analytic solution for black branes in compact space .",
    "we find that @xmath16 for @xmath17 and @xmath18 which indicates the existence of a cascade of first order transitions , ( [ eq : ordering ] ) does not hold .",
    "for example , at @xmath19 , we obtain @xmath20 for @xmath21 .",
    "although this is consistent with @xcite , however , our approximation becomes subtle at such large dimensions as pointed out in @xcite .",
    "more careful treatment is needed in order to show whether or not our approximation could be applicable at larger dimensions . ] .",
    "let us consider the @xmath22-dimensional einstein - hilbert action in the asymptotically flat space , @xmath23 we take the background spacetime to be @xmath14 , where compactification radii of @xmath5 are @xmath24 for all directions .",
    "suppose that a schwarzschild black hole is placed in this space .",
    "if its horizon is much smaller than @xmath24 , then we can approximate it using a schwarzschild solution in @xmath25 .",
    "if the size of the horizon becomes comparable to @xmath24 , the black hole can not fit in @xmath5 and can wind on some cycles @xmath26 in @xmath5 .",
    "this is the gregory - laflamme transition .",
    "preferred value of @xmath0 can be determined by comparing the free energy .",
    "let us begin with the simplest case , @xmath27 . in this case",
    ", the metric can be written as @xmath28 where @xmath29 represents the horizon radius and @xmath30 . by requiring the regularity of the above metric",
    ", the hawking temperature @xmath31 is given by @xmath32    the adm energy ( mass ) and entropy of the black string ( [ eq : bstn ] ) are given by @xcite @xmath33    for @xmath34 , because exact metric is not known , we approximate the transverse compact directions by noncompact ones . then , the above expressions can be used by replacing @xmath35 with @xmath0 . in several examples ,",
    "this approximation is known to be good even if the horizon is comparable to the compactification radius ; see e.g. @xcite . in the present case ,",
    "the ratio @xmath36 is around @xmath37 and we can expect that this approximation is valid .      in order to determine the phase structure , let us compare the free energies for @xmath0-branes and @xmath1-branes fixing temperature @xmath38 and varying @xmath24 .",
    "then , because the hawking temperature is related to the size of the horizon as @xmath39 we have the relation @xmath40 the free energy of @xmath0-brane is given by @xmath41 when @xmath42 , the @xmath1-brane is more favorable .",
    "using ( [ eq : freeen ] ) and ( [ eq : relhori ] ) , this relation becomes @xmath43 as shown in table [ tab:1 ] , the critical value @xmath8 is the decreasing function of @xmath0 .",
    "we can also compare the entropy with adm energy fixed .",
    "similar pattern of instability appears also in this case ( see table [ tab:1 ] ) .",
    ".the critical values of the circle for @xmath44 . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we can also see that @xmath45 for @xmath46 .",
    "this relation indicates that , after a transition from @xmath0-brane to @xmath1-brane , the horizon of @xmath1-brane is larger than the next critical radius @xmath47 and hence the next transition can take place when the horizon shrinks to @xmath47 . in this way",
    ", transitions take place repeatedly .    in the present case",
    ", we have not calculated the gl temperature @xmath15 . in @xcite , @xmath48 has been calculated , and the result is @xmath49 this is slightly lower than @xmath12 as expected . if other @xmath15 s satisfy @xmath50 then a cascade can take place as first order transitions similarly to the case of dual sym .",
    "such a cascade resembles also to the schwarzschild case .",
    "( red ) and @xmath51 ( green).,width=302 ]",
    "there are several directions for future studies .",
    "first of all , it is important to justify the approximation in this paper in which compact directions are replaced with noncompact ones , because phase structure is sensitive to the small changes of physical quantities ; as discussed in @xcite , a few percent error in the entropy can change the magnitude relation of critical temperatures and lead us to the wrong conclusion . at least in the case of d - brane discussed in  4 , ads / cft correspondence suggests that this approximation gives the correct phase diagram .",
    "secondly similar calculations for other compactifications are important",
    ". if compatified dimensions are curved , our approximation would not be valid at all , and more careful treatment would be necessary .",
    "in addition , it is necessary to consider other solutions such as a non - uniform string solution ; at present , we showed that uniform @xmath0-brane solution is unstable and @xmath1-brane is ( meta-)stable at a critical temperature , but it might be possible that @xmath0-brane decays to another stable solution .",
    "also , it will be nice if it can be determined whether ( [ conditionforcascadeinads ] ) holds or not .",
    "it is possible to perform a similar study in gravity theories with other boundary conditions . from the point of view of the super yang - mills theory",
    ", such a study will be useful to clarify the phase structure of sym on @xmath52 @xcite .    in large-@xmath53 gauge theories ,",
    "if the global @xmath2 symmetry is not broken then expectation values of wilson loops are independent of compactification radii through eguchi - kawai equivalence @xcite . using this property , simulation cost",
    "could be reduced to a large extent @xcite .",
    "determination of the @xmath2-unbroken region is important also for this reason .",
