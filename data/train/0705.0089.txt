    "complex dynamical systems are high dimensional in nature .",
    "the determination of simple general principles governing the behavior of such systems is an outstanding problem which has attracted a great deal of attention in connection with recent network and graph - theoretical constructs @xcite . here",
    "i focus on synchronization , which is the process that has attracted most attention , and use this process to study the interplay between network structure and dynamics .",
    "synchronization is a widespread phenomenon in distributed systems , with examples ranging from neuronal to technological networks @xcite .",
    "previous studies have shown that network synchronization is strongly influenced by the randomness @xcite , degree ( connectivity ) distribution @xcite , correlations @xcite , and distributions of directions and weights @xcite in the underlying network of couplings .",
    "but what is the ultimate origin of these dependences ?    in this paper ,",
    "i show that these and other important effects in the dynamics of complex networks are ultimately controlled by a small number of network parameters . for concreteness ,",
    "i focus on complete synchronization of identical dynamical units @xcite , which has served as a prime paradigm for the study of collective dynamics in complex networks . in this case",
    ", the synchronizability of the network is determined by the largest and smallest nonzero eigenvalues of the coupling ( laplacian ) matrix .",
    "my principal result is that , for a wide class of complex networks , these eigenvalues are tightly bounded by simple functions of the weights and degrees in the network .",
    "the quantities involved in the bounds are either known by construction or can be calculated in at most @xmath0 operations for networks with @xmath1 nodes and @xmath2 links , whereas the numerical calculation of the eigenvalues of large networks would be prohibitively costly since it requires in general @xmath3 operations even for the special case of undirected networks .",
    "these bounds are in many aspects different from those known in the literature of graph spectral theory @xcite and are suitable to relate the physically observable structures in the network of couplings to the dynamics of the entire system .",
    "the eigenvalue bounds are then applied to design complex networks that display predetermined dynamical properties and , conversely , to determine how given structural properties influence the network dynamics .",
    "this is achieved by exploring the fact that the quantities used to express the bounds have direct physical interpretation .",
    "this leads to conditions for the enhancement and suppression of synchronization in terms of physical parameters of the network",
    ". the main results also apply to a class of weighted and directed networks and are thus important to assess the effect of nonuniform connection weights in the synchronization of real - world networks @xcite . the proposed method for network design",
    "is based on a relationship between the eigenvalues of a substrate network that incorporates the structural constraints imposed to the system and those of weighted versions of the same network .",
    "this method is thus complementary to other recently proposed approaches for identifying @xcite or constructing @xcite networks with desired dynamical properties .",

    "@xcite , namely that networks with good synchronization properties tend to be at least approximately uniform with respect to the strength of the input signal received by each node ( but see remark below ) .",
    "these optimal networks have interesting properties . for @xmath152 ,",
    "all the nodes of the network have exactly the same input strength .",

    "this indicates that , unless all the nodes have exactly the same degree , the networks that optimize synchronizability for that degree distribution are necessarily weighted _ and _ directed .",
    "moreover , if @xmath154 , the strength @xmath155 of connection from node @xmath56 to node @xmath7 is larger than the strength @xmath156 of the connection from node @xmath7 to node @xmath56 .",
    "therefore , in the most synchronizable networks , the dynamical units are asymmetrically coupled and the stronger direction of the connections is from the nodes with higher degrees to the nodes with lower degrees .",
    "the asymmetry and the predominance of connections from higher to lower degree nodes is a consequence of the condition that nodes with different degrees have the same input strength , a condition that introduces correlations between the weights of individual connections and the topology of the network and that has been observed to have similar consequences in other coupling models @xcite .",
    "these results combined with the interesting recent work of giuraniuc _ et al . _",
    "@xcite on critical behavior suggest that , in realistic systems , the properties of individual connections are at least partially shaped by the topology of the network .    _",
    "remark : _ the above analysis shows that for the networks satisfying the condition in eq .",
    "( [ e3 ] ) , @xmath70 is more tightly bounded close to the optimal value @xmath157 when the distribution of input strengths @xmath28 is more homogeneous . indeed , the bounds in eq .",
    "( [ e11 ] ) leave little room for the improvement of synchronizability by changing the weights of individual links or the way the nodes are connected if @xmath117 is not reduced . for classes of more general directed networks , however , one can have highly synchronizable networks with a heterogeneous distribution of @xmath28 . to see this ,",
    "consider the set of most synchronizable networks among all possible networks , which is precisely the set of networks with @xmath157 and eigenvalues @xmath158 .",
    "as shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , if the laplacian matrix @xmath26 is diagonalizable , then the networks with @xmath157 are those where each node either has output connections with the same strength to all the other nodes ( and at least one node does so ) or has no output connections at all . from this and the zero row sum property of the laplacian matrix",
    ", it follows that @xmath159 , where @xmath160 is the strength of each output connection from node @xmath7 .",
    "accordingly , the input strength @xmath28 is upper bounded by @xmath161 , but not necessarily the same for all the nodes . in particular",
    ", since the strengths of the output connections can have any values @xmath160 ( as long as at least one is non - zero ) , in this case there is no lower limit for @xmath28 and the ratio @xmath117 can be arbitrarily large despite the fact that @xmath157 .",
    "therefore , even when the spectra is real , strictly directed networks can be fundamentally different from the directed networks considered here @xcite .",
    "i have presented rigorous results showing that the extreme eigenvalues of the laplacian matrix of many complex networks are bounded by the node degrees and input strengths , where the latter can be interpreted as the _ weighted _ in - degrees in the networks .",
    "these results can be used to predict and control the coupling cost and a number of implications of the network structure on the dynamical properties of the system , such as its tendency to sustain synchronized behavior .",
    "i have shown here that these results can also be used to design networks with predefined dynamical properties .    while i have focused on complete synchronization of identical units , the leading role of @xmath117 and @xmath39 revealed in this work",
    "also provides insights into other forms of synchronization .",
    "in particular , it seems to help explain : the suppressive effects of heterogeneity in the synchronization of pulse - coupled @xcite and non - identical oscillators @xcite ; the dominant effect of the mean degree in the synchronization of time - delay systems with normalized input signal @xcite ; and the dominant effect of the degree in the synchronization of homogeneous networks of bursting neurons @xcite . the scale - free model of neuronal networks considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , which was shown to generate large synchronous firing peaks , is also consistent with ( an extrapolation of ) the results above .",
    "indeed , the networks in that model are scale free only with respect to the out - degree distribution and are homogeneous with respect to the in - degree distribution .",
    "therefore , the results presented here may serve as a reference in the study of more general systems , including those with heterogeneous dynamical units @xcite . in general",
    ", the impact of the network structure will change both with the specific synchronization model and with the specific question under consideration , and an important open problem is to understand _ how _ it changes .",
    "finally , since the laplacian eigenvalues also govern a variety of other processes @xcite , including the relaxation time in diffusion dynamics @xcite , community formation @xcite , consensus phenomena @xcite , and first - passage time in random walk processes @xcite , the results reported here are also expected to meet other applications in the broad area of dynamics on complex networks , particularly in connection with network design in communication and transport problems .",
