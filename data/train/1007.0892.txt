    "recent years more and more efforts have been made to the b meson decays with one @xcite even two @xcite charmed mesons in the final states and it is found that the perturbative qcd factorization ( pqcd ) approach do work well in these decays .",

    "this is still large enough to make a hard intermediate gluon in the hard part calculation .",
