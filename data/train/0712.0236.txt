    "rubbers and elastomers are highly deformable solids which have the remarkable property of preserving their volume through any deformation .",
    "this permanent isochoricity can be incorporated into the equations of continuum mechanics through the concept of an _ internal constraint _",
    ", here the constraint of _ incompressibility_. mathematically , the formulation of the constraint of incompressibility has led to the discovery of several exact solutions in isotropic finite elasticity , most notably to the controllable or universal solutions of rivlin and co - workers ( see for example rivlin ( 1948 ) ) . subsequently , ericksen ( 1954 ) examined the problem of finding all such solutions .",
    "he found that there are no controllable finite deformations in isotropic _ compressible _ elasticity , except for homogeneous deformations ( ericksen 1955 ) .",
    "the impact of that result on the theory of nonlinear elasticity was quite important and long - lasting , and for many years a palpable pessimism reigned about the possibility of finding exact solutions at all for compressible elastic materials .",
    "then currie & hayes ( 1981 ) showed that one could obtain interesting classes of exact solutions , beyond the homogeneous universal deformations , if one restricted their attention to certain special classes of compressible materials .",
    "a string of results about the search for exact solutions in nonlinear elasticity followed .",
    "now a long list exists of classes of exact solutions which are universal only relative to some special strain - energy functions ( for a recent presentation of such classes see fu and ogden ( 2001 ) . )",
    "these solutions can help us to understand the structure of the theory of nonlinear elasticity and to complement the celebrated solutions of rivlin .",
    "in the same vein , some recent efforts focused on determining the maximal strain energy for which a certain deformation field , fixed a priori , is admissible .",
    "this is a sort of _ inverse problem _ : find the elastic materials ( that is , the functional form of the strain - energy function ) for which a given deformation field is controllable ( that is , for which the deformation is a solution to the equilibrium equations in the absence of body forces ) .",
    "a classical example illustrating such an approach is obtained by considering deformations of _ anti - plane shear _ type .",
    "knowles ( 1977 ) shows that a non - trivial ( non - homogeneous ) equilibrium state of anti - plane shear is not always ( universally ) admissible , not only for compressible solids ( as expected from ericksen s result ) but also for incompressible solids ( horgan ( 1995 ) gives a survey of anti - plane shear deformations in nonlinear elasticity ) . only for a special class of incompressible materials ( inclusive of the so - called ` generalized neo - hookean materials ' )",
    "is an anti - plane shear deformation controllable .",
    "let us consider for example the case of an elastic material filling the annular region between two coaxial cylinders , with the following boundary value problem : hold fixed the outer cylinder and pull the inner cylinder by applying a tension in the axial direction .",
    "it is well established that a solution to this problem , valid for every isotropic incompressible elastic solid , is obtained by assuming a priori that the deformation field is a pure axial shear .",
    "now consider the corresponding problem for _ non - coaxial _",
    "cylinders , thereby losing the axial symmetry . then it is clear that we can not expect the material to deform as prescribed by a pure axial shear deformation .",
    "knowles s result tells us that now the boundary value problem can be solved with a general anti - plane deformation ( not axially symmetric ) _ only for a subclass _ of incompressible isotropic elastic materials .",
    "of course this restriction does not mean that for a generic material it is not possible to deform the annular material as prescribed by our boundary conditions , but rather that in general , these lead to a deformation field which is more complex than an anti - plane shear . and so",
    ", we expect _ secondary _ in - plane deformations .",
    "the theory of non - newtonian fluid dynamics has generated a substantial literature about secondary flows , see for example fosdick & serrin ( 1973 ) . in solid mechanics",
    "it seems that only fosdick & kao ( 1978 ) and mollica & rajagopal ( 1997 ) produced some significant and beautiful examples of secondary deformations fields for the non - coaxial cylinders problem , although this topic is clearly of fundamental importance , not only from a theoretical point of view but also for technical applications .    in this paper",
    "we consider a complex deformation field in isotropic incompressible elasticity , to point out by an explicit example the situations just evoked and to elaborate on their possible impact on solid mechanics .",
    "our deformation field takes advantage of the radial symmetry and therefore we find it convenient to visualize it by considering an elastic cylinder .",
    "let us imagine that a corkscrew has been driven through a cork ( the cylinder ) in a bottle .",
    "the inside of the bottleneck is the outer rigid cylinder and the idealization of the gallery carved out by the corkscrew constitutes the inner coaxial rigid cylinder .",
    "our first deformation is purely radial , originated from the introduction of the cork into the bottleneck and then completed when the corkscrew penetrates the cork ( a so - called _ shrink fit problem _ , which is a source of elastic residual stresses here ) .",
    "we call @xmath0 , @xmath1 the respective inner and outer radii of the cork in the reference configuration and @xmath2 , @xmath3 their current counterparts .",
    "then we follow with a _ simple torsion _ combined to a _",
    "helical shear _",
    ", in order to model pulling the cork out of the bottleneck in the presence of a contact force .",
    "figure [ fig_deformation ] sketches this deformation .",
    "of course we are aware of the shortcomings of our modelling with respect to the description of a ` real ' cork - pulling problem , because no cork is an infinitely long cylinder , nor is a corkscrew perfectly straight .",
    "in addition , traditional corks made from bark are anisotropic ( honeycomb mesoscopic structure ) and possess the remarkable ( and little - known ) property of having an infinitesimal poisson ratio equal to zero , see the review article by gibson _",
    "et al . _ ( 1981 ) .",
    "however we note that _ polymer corks _ have appeared on the world wine market ; they are made of elastomers , for which incompressible , isotropic elasticity seems like a reasonable framework ( indeed the documentation of these synthetic wine stoppers indicates that they lengthen during the sealing process ) .",
    "we hope that this study provides a first step toward a nonlinear alternative to the linear elasticity testing protocols presented in the international standard iso 9727 .",
    "we also note that low - cost _ shock absorbers _ often consist of a moving metal cylinder , glued to the inner face of an elastomeric tube , whose outer face is glued to a fixed metal cylinder ( hill 1975 ) .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following .",
    "section 2 is devoted to the derivation of the governing equations and to a detailed description of the boundary value problem . in ",
    "3 we specialize the analysis to the _ neo - hookean strain - energy density _ , and find the corresponding exact solution .",
    "we use it to show that it is advantageous to add a twisting moment to an axial force when extruding a cork from a bottle .",
    "the neo - hookean strain - energy density is linear with respect to the first principal invariant of the cauchy - green strain tensor .",
    "it is much used in finite elasticity theory , although it captures poorly the basic features of rubber behaviour ( saccomandi 2004 ) .",
    "we thus investigate the consequence of departing from that strain - energy density .",
    "first , in  4 we consider the _",
    "generalized neo - hookean strain - energy density _",
    " non - linear with respect to the first principal invariant of the cauchy - green strain tensor  to show that in this case torsion is explicitly present in the solution for the axial shear displacement , but it is a second - order dependence .",
    "next we consider in  5 the _ mooney  rivlin strain - energy density _",
    " linear with respect to the first and second principal invariants of the cauchy - green strain tensor  and find that it is then also possible to obtain an exact solution to our boundary value problem .",
    "its expression is too cumbersome to manipulate and we resort to a small parameter asymptotic expansion from the neo - hookean case .",
    "section 6 concludes the paper with some remarks on the limitations of the semi - inverse method .",
    "consider a long hollow cylindrical tube , composed of an isotropic incompressible nonlinearly elastic material . at rest",
    "the tube is in the region @xmath4 where @xmath5 are the cylindrical coordinates associated with the undeformed configuration , and @xmath0 and @xmath1 are the inner and outer radii of the tube , respectively .",

    "in addition to the axial traction applied on its inner face , the tube is subject to a resultant axial force @xmath45 ( say ) and a resultant moment @xmath46 ( say ) , @xmath47 note that the traction @xmath48 of is not arbitrary but is instead determined by the _ shrink fit pre - deformation _",
    ", by requiring that @xmath49 when @xmath50 ( this process is detailed in the next section for the neo - hookean material . )",
    "therefore @xmath48 is connected with the stress field experienced by the cork when it is introduced in the bottleneck .    in the rest of the paper we aim at presenting results in dimensionless form . to this end",
    "we normalize the strain - energy density @xmath51 and the cauchy stress tensor @xmath32 with respect to @xmath52 , the infinitesimal shear modulus ; hence we introduce @xmath53 and @xmath54 defined by @xmath55 similarly we introduce the following non - dimensional variables , @xmath56 so that @xmath57",

    "we take @xmath59 so that @xmath60 ; we consider that the outer radius is shrunk by 10% : @xmath61 , and that the inner radius has doubled : @xmath62 ; finally we apply a traction whose magnitude is half the infinitesimal shear modulus : @xmath63 .",
    "this gives @xmath64    at this point it is possible to state clearly our main observation .",
    "a first glance at the boundary conditions , in particular at the requirements that @xmath11 be zero on the outer face of the tube , gives the expectation that @xmath65 everywhere is a solution to our boundary value problem , at least for some simple forms of the constitutive equations .",
    "in what follows we find that for the so - called ` neo - hookean ' solids , @xmath65 is indeed a solution , whether there is a torsion @xmath66 or not .",

    "indeed there is no ` real world ' material whose behaviour is ever going to be described _",
    "exactly _ by that strain - energy density ( supposing it exists ) .",
    "instead a more pertinent issue to raise for ` real word applications ' is whether we are able to evaluate the importance of latent ( secondary ) stress fields , because they are bound to be woken up ( triggered ) by the deformation .",
    "first we consider the special strain energy density which generates the class of neo - hookean materials , namely @xmath69 note that here and hereafter , we use the non - dimensional quantities introduced previously , from which we drop the overbar for convenience . hence the components of the ( non - dimensional ) stress field in a neo - hookean material reduce to @xmath70 substituting into we find that @xmath71 and by integration , using , that @xmath72    in figure 2a , we present a rectangle in the tube at rest",

    "first we saw that here the contribution @xmath89 is not required for the azimuthal displacement , whether there is a torsion @xmath66 or not .",

    "if the tube is pulled by the application of an axial force only ( @xmath92 ) and no moment ( @xmath93 ) , then @xmath94 and no azimuthal shear occurs at all .",
    "when we try to apply our results to the extrusion of a cork from the neck of a bottle , the following remarks seem to be relevant . from the elementary theory of coulomb friction , it is known that the pulled cork starts to move when , in modulus , the friction force exerted on the neck surface is equal to the normal force times the coefficient of static friction . in our case",
    "this means that @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the coefficient of static friction . using and",
    ", we find that the elements of the left handside of this inequality are @xmath97 now , our main concern is to understand if it is better to apply a moment @xmath98 when uncorking a bottle , than to pull only . to address this question",

    "moreover , the equation above shows that @xmath103 grows linearly with @xmath45 but quadratically with @xmath46 . with respect to efficient cork - pulling",
    ", the conclusion is that adding a twisting moment to a given pure axial force is more advantageous than solely increasing the vertical pull .",
    "moreover , we observe that a moment is applied by using a lever and this is always more convenient from an energetic point of view .",
    "recall that we made several simplifying assumptions to reach these results : not only infinite axial length , incompressibility , and isotropy , but also the choice of a truly special strain energy density . in the next two sections we depart from the neo - hookean model .",
    "as a first broadening of the neo - hookean strain - energy density , we consider _ generalized neo - hookean materials _ , for which the strain - energy density is a nonlinear function of the first invariant @xmath104 only , @xmath105 say . to gain access to the cauchy stress components in this context , it suffices to take @xmath106 and @xmath107 in equations . in particular , @xmath108 , and the integrated equation of equilibrium @xmath109 gives @xmath110 .",
    "integrating , with as an initial value , we find that @xmath111 hence , just as in the neo - hookean case , azimuthal shear can be avoided altogether , whether there is a torsion @xmath66 or not .",
    "we are left with an equation for the axial shear , namely @xmath112 , which here reads @xmath113 obviously the same steps as those taken for neo - hookean solids may be followed here for any given strain energy density , but now by resorting to a numerical treatment .",
    "horgan & saccomandi ( 2003@xmath114 ) show , through some specific examples of hardening generalized neo - hookean solids , how rapidly involved the analysis becomes , even when there is only helical shear and no shrink fit .",
    "instead we simply point out some striking differences between our present situation and the neo - hookean case .",

    "differential equation for @xmath116 , in contrast with the neo - hookean case .",
    "another contrast is that the axial shear @xmath12 is now intimately coupled to the torsion parameter @xmath66 , and that this dependence is a _ second - order effect _",
    "( @xmath66 appears above as @xmath117 ) .    a similar problem where the azimuthal shear has not been ignored , but the axial shear has been considered null i.e. @xmath118 has been recently considered by wineman ( 2005 ) .",
    "in this section we specialize the general equations of  2 to the mooney  rivlin form of the strain - energy density , which in its non - dimensional form reads @xmath119 where @xmath120 is a material parameter , distinguishing the mooney  rivlin material from the neo - hookean material , and also allowing a dependence on the second principal strain invariant @xmath121 , in contrast to the generalized neo - hookean solids of the previous section .",
    "then the integrated equations of equilibrium read @xmath122    first we ask ourselves if it is possible to avoid torsion during the pulling of the inner face . taking @xmath94 above gives @xmath123 it follows that here it is indeed possible to solve our boundary value problem .",

    "this constitutes the first departure from the neo - hookean and generalized neo - hookean behaviours : _ torsion ( @xmath127 ) is necessarily accompanied by azimuthal shear ( @xmath67)_.    in the case @xmath91 , we introduce the function @xmath128 defined as @xmath129 ( recall that @xmath130 is given explicitly in . ) we then solve the system for @xmath131 and @xmath132 as @xmath133 making clear the link between @xmath11 and @xmath66 .",
    "thus for the mooney  rivlin material , the azimuthal shear @xmath11 is a _ latent _ mode of deformation ; it is _ woken up _ by any amount of torsion @xmath66 .",
    "recall that at first sight , the azimuthal shear component of the deformation seemed inessential to satisfy the boundary conditions , especially in view of the boundary condition @xmath134 .",
    "however , a non - zero @xmath135 term in the constitutive equation clearly couples the effects of a torsion and of an azimuthal shear , as displayed explicitly by the presence of @xmath66 in the expression for @xmath136 above .",

    "in non - newtonian fluid mechanics and in turbulence theory , the existence of shear - induced normal stresses on planes transverse to the direction of shear is at the root of some important phenomena occurring in the flow of fluid down pipes of non - circular cross section ( fosdick & serrin 1973 ) . in other words ,",
    "pure parallel flows in tubes without axial symmetry are possible only when we consider the classical theory of navier - stokes equations or the linear theory of turbulence or tubes of circular cross section .    in nonlinear elasticity theory ,",
    "similar phenomena are reported .",
    "hence fosdick & kao ( 1978 ) and mollica & rajagopal ( 1997 ) show that for general isotropic incompressible materials , an anti - plane shear deformation of a cylinder with non axial - symmetric cross section causes a secondary in - plane deformation field , because of normal stress differences .",
    "horgan & saccomandi ( 2003@xmath147 ) give a detailed discussion of how the anti - plane shear deformation field couples with the in - plane deformation field in a generalized neo - hookean solid .",
    "the appearance of what we called here _ latent deformations _ is quite general and common .",
    "for example it is known in compressible nonlinear elasticity that pure torsion is possible only in a special class of materials , but we know that torsion plus a radial displacement is possible in all compressible isotropic elastic materials ( polignone & horgan 1991 ) ( here we signal that ` possible in all materials ' is not equivalent to ` universal ' , because the corresponding radial deformation differs from one material to another . )    in this paper we give an example where axial symmetry holds , where the boundary conditions suggest that an axial shear deformation field is sufficient to solve the boundary value problem , and where nevertheless , the normal stress difference wakes up a latent azimuthal shear deformation . moreover , because we are able to find some explicit exact solutions by some perturbation techniques , we are able to evaluate the _ importance _ of the latent deformation . indeed , we show that if a certain constitutive parameter @xmath143 ( distinguishing a neo - hookean solid from a mooney ",
    "rivlin solid ) is zero or if the torsion parameter @xmath66 is zero , then the solution to the boundary value problem can be found only in terms of the axial shear deformation field ; if these two parameters are not zero  even if they are small  then the latent mode of deformation is quantitatively appreciable .",
    "in conclusion we suggest that it is not crucial to determine the class of materials for which a given deformation field is possible .",
    "rather it is crucial to classify all the latent deformations associated with a given deformation field in such a way that this field is controllable for the entire class of materials . indeed , no _ real _ material , even when we accept that its mechanical behaviour is purely elastic , is ever going to be described exactly by a special choice of strain - energy . looking for special classes of materials for which special deformations fields are admissible may mislead us in our understanding of the nonlinear mechanical behaviour of materials .",
    "to finish the paper on a light note , we evoke a classic wine party dilemma : which kind of corkscrew system requires the least effort to uncork a bottle ?",
    "figure 4 sketches the two working principles commonly found in commercial corkscrews .",
