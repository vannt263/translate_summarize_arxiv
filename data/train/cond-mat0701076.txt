    "based on the present results , we can conclude that the half - filled system exhibits an ( apparently continuous ) order - disorder transition near a temperature of 2.9 .",
    "further details on the nature of the transition ( which from symmetry considerations should belong to the ising model universality class ) , must await more extensive studies using larger systems .    to close this section",

    "the system has separated into distinct high- and low - density phases .",
    "the latter is quite dilute , while the former clearly reflects the periodic potential , and possesses a low density of vacant sites .",
    "the interface between the high- and low - density regions is quite rough .",
    "we determined the stationary properties for various drive strengths @xmath76 , for system sizes @xmath77 and @xmath72 , following the procedure described above .",
    "the mean energy is plotted versus temperature in fig .",
    "[ ep30 ] for various drive intensities . for the relatively weak drive ( @xmath78 ) ,",
    "the energy is just slightly higher than in equilibrium . for the larger drives we observe a substantial increase in energy .    in fig .",
    "[ vare01 ] we compare the scaled energy variance @xmath79var@xmath80 in equilibrium and under drive @xmath78 .",
    "although this quantity does not represent the specific heat for @xmath81 , it is nevertheless reasonable to suppose that a singularity in @xmath64 ( or a sharp peak , in a finite system ) , marks a phase transition .",
    "it is therefore interesting to note that the @xmath78 data exhibit a sharper peak ( and at a slightly higher temperature ) , than in equilibrium .",
    "this suggests that a weak drive facilitates ordering . for @xmath78 , the scaled variance ( upper inset )",
    "follows the same trends as , but is generally greater than , the specific heat , @xmath82 .",
    "( in this case we obtain @xmath82 via numerical differentiation of a polynomial fit to the energy data . )",
    "this suggests that the drive causes fluctuations beyond those generated by thermal mechanisms .",
    "( that is , the drive realizes work on the system but is not included in the energy balance . )",
    "the dependence of var@xmath83 on system size ( lower inset ) is qualitatively similar to that found in equilibrium ; we estimate @xmath84 for @xmath78 .    the plot of the order parameter ( fig .",
    "[ m30dr ] ) confirms that a weak drive ( @xmath78 , 2 ) enhances ordering , whereas a stronger one inhibits it .",
    "these data suggest a transition temperature of @xmath85 , for @xmath86 .    the effect of increasing drive at fixed temperature is shown in figs .",
    "[ evfa ] ( energy and its variance ) and [ mvfa ] ( order parameter ) .",
    "the energy increases slowly with @xmath76 for a weak drive , rapidly for intermediate drive strength , and then exhibits a steady , more gradual growth for @xmath87 or so .",
    "the energy variance shows a marked peak ( near @xmath88 for @xmath89 , and @xmath90 for @xmath91 ) , which appears to be associated with destruction of an ordered arrangement .",
    "the amplitude of this peak is much larger than in equilibrium . for larger drives",
    ", var@xmath83 increases steadily with @xmath76 , as the drive forces particles out of the periodic potential minima .",
    "[ mvfa ] again shows that a weak drive enhances ordering .",
    "the order parameter reaches a maximum near @xmath78 - 2 , and then decays rapidly when the drive is increased further , and the driving force begins to dominate interparticle attraction .    the stationary current density @xmath47 , defined as the mean displacement @xmath92 per site and unit time , is plotted as a function of drive in fig .",
    "for the range of parameters studied here , @xmath47 is an increasing function of both @xmath76 and @xmath93 . in the disordered phase ( upper set of points in fig .",
    "[ jt35 ] ) , the current grows linearly with @xmath76 for small @xmath76 , and then shows signs of saturating at larger values of the drive . at lower temperatures and weak drives , such that the system is ordered , the current is severely reduced , but it takes values comparable to those at higher temperature once @xmath76 is large enough to disorder the system .",
    "the latter event is signaled by a sharp peak in the variance of the energy ( fig .",
    "[ evfa ] ) ; the singularity ( if any ) in the current is much weaker .",
    "our results suggest that the particles are organized into dense stripes along the field direction , as in the driven lattice gas .",
    "the configurations shown in figs .",
    "[ conf-1 ] ( @xmath75 , @xmath78 ) , and [ conf-2 ] ( @xmath94 , @xmath78 ) , confirm this expectation .",
    "comparing figs .",
    "[ cfndt2 ] ( @xmath95 ) and [ conf-1 ] ( @xmath95 ) , the chief difference is the smoother interface found in the driven system .",
    "[ conf-2 ] shows a configuration well below the transition temperature , in which two separate stripes have emerged .",
    "as in the driven lattice gas , this appears to be a long - lived metastable state at low temperature @xcite .",
    "@xmath96      we performed some preliminary studies of another method for perturbing the system out of equilibrium . in this case",
    "there is no drive , but the external potential is time dependent , given by @xmath97 , with the function @xmath2 as in eq .",
    "( [ ppel ] ) .",
    "[ since the potential is periodic , the first argument of @xmath98 is effectively @xmath99 . ]",

    "otherwise the parameters are as in the studies reported above . for velocities",
    "@xmath104 , there is anisotropic , lattice - gas like ordering for @xmath105 .",
    "( the critical temperature is about 2.5 for @xmath106 . ) for larger velocities , @xmath107 or 0.1 , the critical temperature is reduced considerably ( @xmath108 for @xmath109 ) .",
    "the interface between phases is again oriented along the @xmath33 direction , but for @xmath110 the particle configuration ( fig .",
    "[ v1t15 ] ) shows no hint of periodic structure .",
    "we study a two dimensional model of colloidal particles subject to a periodic external potential and an interaction that favors ordering in a lattice - gas - like arrangement .",
    "stationary properties of the model are determined via monte carlo simulation . in equilibrium",
    "the system appears to undergo a second order phase transition , as reflected in the specific heat and the order parameter .",
    "when the short - range hopping dynamics is biased by a drive , we observe anisotropic phase separation , i.e. , the interface is oriented along the drive , and becomes smoother , as found in studies of the driven lattice gas @xcite .",
    "a weak drive facilitates ordering , as in the driven lattice gas .",
    "a strong drive , by contrast , tends to destroy order , and provokes very large energy fluctuations .",
    "preliminary analysis indicates that a colloidal system under a moving background potential may offer another realization of anisotropic phase separation .",
    "our results suggest that a system of particles interacting via a potential featuring short - range repulsion and slightly longer range attraction , in the presence of a periodic external potential with a lattice constant matched to the interparticle potential minimum , provides a good candidate for realization of both equilibrium and driven lattice gases .",
    "although the physics of such a continuous space system is richer than the corresponding lattice model , there is good reason to expect that similar scaling properties will emerge , in a suitable range of parameter values .",
    "while the equilibrium model could in principle be realized using a planar optical tweezer array to provide the external potential , the driven system must , by nature , have periodic boundary conditions along the drive direction .",
    "this suggests a cylindrical geometry , with the driving force provided by stokes drag on the particles in steady couette flow .",
    "( this scheme , without the optical tweezer array , could be used to realize the type of system studied in ref .",
    "alternatively , one could impose relative rotational motion between the colloidal suspension and the tweezer array .",
    "we defer analysis of the feasibility of such a setup to future work .",
    "many additional aspects of the system remain to be explored theoretically and in simulations . while the present study uses ( because of its greater efficiency ) monte carlo simulation to map out equilibrium properties and nonequilibrium steady states , the driven system should be investigated via langevin dynamics . aside from affording a better account of nonequilibrium stationary and time - dependent properties , this method would allow for inclusion of hydrodynamic interactions between the particles and with container walls .",
    "preliminary studies of the model system studied here using the langevin equation in fact yield qualitatively similar results to those reported above @xcite .",
    "it would also be interesting to remove the periodic boundaries in the direction perpendicular to the drive , and the restriction to two dimensions .",
    "more detailed characterization of the phase transitions exhibited by this system , both in and out of equilibrium , using large - scale simulations , are planned for future work .",
