    "it is still of great theoretical and experimental interest since perhaps it is the only process , which can unambiguously determine whether massive neutrinos can be majorana or dirac type particles . it can occur only if the mass eigenstates are majorana particles ( the particle coincides with its antiparticle ) .    in the weak basis @xmath0 ,",
