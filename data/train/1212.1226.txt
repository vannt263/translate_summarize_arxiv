    ", their chemical composition is of great significance to understanding the origin of the planets and the distribution of important molecules , including water , throughout the solar system .",
    "this was and is a major goal of the deep impact and epoxi missions , among others , as well as ground - based observations of comets .",
    "recent observations , in particular those of the deep impact and epoxi missions ( see e.g. feaga , et al . 2007 or ahearn , et al . 2011 ) , have provided better spectra of a cometary coma than were , in general , previously available .",
    "these observations include spectra with high spatial resolution very near to the nucleus .",
    "no previous observations had as much spatially well - resolved spectral data , and thus there was little observationally driven need to pay special or close attention to the densest part of the coma .",
    "ground - based observations could only see optically thick regions of comae for the brightest and/or most active of comets .",
    "( e.g. hale bopp ; see disanti et al .",
    "2001 . )",
    "therefore many earlier studies that modeled spectra of comae , in keeping with the available observations of the time , did not attempt to calculate optical depth effects on spectra .",
    "optically thin comae were assumed , since the field of view in those observations being modeled would be dominated by the majority of the coma far from the nucleus , which is optically thin ( see e.g. chin & weaver 1984 ; crovisier & le bourlot 1983 ) . however , with the proliferation of space missions to comets , as well as much better instruments for ground - based observations ( see , e.g. disanti et al .",
    "1999 ) , this is no longer a truly tenable approach .    our goal is to better understand the abundances , distributions and creation mechanisms of various gases observed in comae , in particular of comet 9p / tempel 1 , the target of the deep impact mission , and 103p / hartley 2 , the subject of the epoxi mission .    in order to do so ,",
    "we have built a computer model of the spectrum of the comet s coma which includes the difficult and often ignored problem of accurately including radiative transfer to account for the potentially optically thick coma ( or regions of the coma ) near the nucleus .",
    "this model will facilitate analyzing the actual spectral data from the deep impact and epoxi missions to better determine abundances of key species , including co , co@xmath0 , and h@xmath0o , as well as remote sensing data on active comets .",
    "we begin our modeling of ir ro - vibrational spectra of a coma by initially following the method used by chin & weaver 1984 , crovisier 1987 , and others with some minor improvements . as in those models",
    ", we assume a constant expansion velocity , thus linearly relating any radial distance to a specific time since a `` parcel '' of gas was released from the surface of the nucleus",
    ". therefore we numerically integrate over time the linear differential equations defined by the einstein coefficients and collisional rate coefficients to get fractional molecular enegry level populations for each distance from the nucleus , from which we calculate emission spectra .",
    "@xmath1    here @xmath2 and @xmath3",
    "indicate energy levels of a molecule with the @xmath4 s with those indices being the corresponding level populations .",
    "the einstein coefficients between levels x and y are @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and c is a similar collisional coefficient .",
    "we use @xmath7 for the mean intensity of radiation at the frequency corresponding to the transition between x and y , @xmath8 is the energy difference between levels x and y , and @xmath9 and t have their usual meanings .",
    "the summations are over all levels i , l or j which have a transition into or out of level k. for collisional coefficients",
    "@xmath10 where @xmath11 is the number density of h@xmath0o ( assumed to be the dominant collisional partner ) @xmath12 is the collisional cross section for a given transition and @xmath13 is the mean ( thermal ) molecular speed .",
    "this allows us to include a time variable production rate .",
    "we use such a coma integration as the initial basis for our coma model before including potential optical depth effects .",
    "our primary improvement is the inclusion of radiative transfer calculations using our spherical adaptation of the coupled escape probability method ( hereafter , `` cep '' ; see elitzur & asensio ramos 2006 , hereafter , `` cep06 '' ) to more correctly model optically thick ( or potentially thick ) regions of cometary comae .",
    "this is described in detail below , and is the main part of this paper .",
    "we use the coma integration results to provide the `` initial guess '' values for populations used in the subsequent radiative transfer calculations using cep .    for the purposes of the initial coma model",
    ", we treat the comet as spherically symmetric , and as having a uniform and constant gas production rate over its entire surface .",
    "the outward speed of the gas is also assumed to be constant , as per chin & weaver 1984 . while this is not strictly physically accurate ( see e.g. combi 1996 ) the variation over the majority of the coma is relatively small .",
    "we use a temperature profile that varies with radial distance from the nucleus , having closely followed combi s 1989 model ( see fig .",
    "[ combi200 ] . )",
    "these approximations make integration over time equivalent to calculating these values over increasing distances from the comet nucleus for a `` shell '' of gas expanding outwards from the nucleus .",
    "we ignore the photodestruction of co in our coma model , due to its long lifetime ( see crovisier 1994 . ) the lifetime is @xmath14 s , and we are integrating out to @xmath15 km with an expansion velocity of 0.8 km s@xmath16 .",
    "( note that others , e.g. morgenthaler , et al .",
    "2011 , find a shorter lifetime , but still @xmath17 s , which is still large enough that it can be neglected in our modeling out to 10@xmath18 km . )",
    "the model can include coma morphology features as well , each modeled with its own coma integration using separate conditions .",
    "such features , as seen in the deep impact and epoxi encounters , are a main motivation for creating this model to better understand possible optical depth effects in the near nucleus regions of the coma .",

    ". these may be useful for ground - based observers ( or space telescope observations of comets ) to better fathom the depths of cometary spectra .",
    "forthcoming model results for co@xmath0 , h@xmath0o and near - nucleus morphological features will follow ( in other papers ) .",
    "this section describes our adaption of the coupled escape probability radiative transfer technique to spherical cases in which the plane parallel approximation is not appropriate , including most cometary problems .",
    "( note that yun , et al .",

    "we derive expressions analogous to the relevant cep06 equations , adapted from the plane parallel situation to spherically symmetric cases .",
    "then we include asymmetries of two different types : radiation from an outside source ( here , the sun ) and non - uniform conditions due to morphology .    in brief , the cep method ( see cep06 ) divides up a plane - parallel `` slab '' into `` zones '' ( each of which has uniform properties ) and calculates the net radiative bracket ( `` @xmath20 '' ) that is multiplied by the einstein a coefficient in the equations of statistical equilibrium ( see equation [ bigeqn ] ) for each radiative transition for each zone .",
    "( note that the `` p '' term effectively combines the `` b '' terms into the `` a '' term .",

    "this is due to our work being primarily motivated by the deep impact observations of the near - nucleus coma ( see feaga , et al .",

    "we divide each shell further into `` regions . '' in the case of comets , one source of asymmetry is incident solar radiation coming from one direction ( outside the outermost shell ) .",
    "therefore , the natural way to further divide shells into regions is along lines parallel to the direction of solar radiation ( i.e. the center - of - comet - to - center - of - sun line , which we will arbitrarily label as the @xmath69-axis . )",
    "thus we superimpose a set of co - axial cylinders ( with radii equal to corresponding shell radii , for the sake of simplicity ) on the shells to divide the coma into regions bounded by two cylinders and two spherical shells .",

    "implementation , these regions are analogous to zones in the plane - parallel cep .",
    "each region s radiative effect or contribution to each other region , i.e. the net radiative bracket , must be calculated .",
    "note that self - irradiation from around an annulus must also be taken into account , as well as irradiation from other regions .",
    "once this calculation is done , the entire region will be equal with respect to radiative processes ( i.e. there is symmetry around the @xmath69-axis ) .",
    "if models of distantly observed comets were all we needed , this might be sufficient .",
    "but we are motivated by the desire to better understand deep impact & epoxi spectral observations that have very high spatial resolution around the comets nuclei .",
    "( see e.g. feaga et al .",
    "2007 and feaga , et al .",
    "therefore the above radiative treatment alone is insufficiently asymmetric to _ fully _ model a cometary coma , when coma morphology is included in the model .",
    "the inclusion of morphology undoes the aforementioned symmetry around the @xmath69-axis within each annulus / region .",
    "these observations are one of the primary motives for this study , and therefore these morphological asymmetries must also be dealt with appropriately in this model .",
    "to model morphological features , we use a cone shape superimposed over the aforementioned divisions into regions .",
    "( other geometric shapes could also have been used .",
    "we chose to implement a cone due to its similarity in shape to many observed coma features . ) a cone of arbitrary orientation and size with its vertex at the center of the sphere creates intersections with the above - described regions .",
    "each of these is then added as a sub - region , which may have different properties from the surrounding ( or subsumed / replaced ) region .",
    "each sub - region can posess different initial conditions from the surrounding region .",
    "thus morphological features , which by their nature tend not to be axisymmetric around our @xmath69-axis , can be included in the model .",
    "it should be noted that these sub - regions are only included as necessary .",
    "thus for those annuli that _ do _ have constant axisymmetric conditions ( i.e. no interesting morphological features impinging on them ) , we can save time and memory computationally by leaving them undivided , as they would have been originally .      given the above geometric divisions , we have implemented asymmetric spherical cep as follows .",
    "for each region ( or sub - region , as applicable ) we take representative population values from the coma integration and use these as the basis of an `` initial guess . ''",
    "we then make an immediate improvement to the initial guess values by recalculating each region s populations ( individually ) taking into account the attenuation of incident solar radiation by intervening regions in the solar direction ( as per equation [ externalradn ] ) .",
    "these recalculated populations are the values we then use as the initial guess ( required by the implementation of newton s method in press , et al .",
    "1992 ) for cep calculations . based on these populations",
    "we calculate the necessary source functions , delta - taus , and net radiative brackets , `` @xmath20 , '' as above , for each wavenumber ( or line , transition , etc . ) following the above discretized equation ( [ fullydiscreteeqn ] ) for each region , which in this context we will call the `` recipient '' region , we iterate over all other regions to calculate their contribution to the recipient s @xmath20 .",
    "each other region s contribution is essentially its own source function attenuated over the optical depth of all intervening regions along the line of sight between itself and the recipient region , integrated over ( or , to simplify , multiplied by ) the solid angle subtended by one region from the other .",
    "this is then divided by the recipient region s source function and optical depth ( along the given line of sight ) .    to implement this in a practical algorithm of manageable complexity ,",
    "we make several simplifying approximations .    due to the @xmath69-axis symmetry that exists ( before adding sub - regions ) , we can _ partially _ simplify to a two - dimensional diagram in which a region is represented by the cross - section of the annulus in the ( arbitrarily chosen ) @xmath76 plane .",
    "we calculate a region s `` centroid '' , i.e. the centroid of its 2-d projected area in this plane which ( in our approximation ) corresponds to a point @xmath35 in spherical coordinates .    for ( cone",
    "shaped ) sub - regions , which in general do not have their centerline on the x - z plane , we must use a different centroid .",
    "we use the midpoint along the cone s centerline ( within region boundaries ) .",
    "we also choose a series of points distributed evenly along circles parallel to the x - y plane around each region , which will be the `` starting points '' for calculation of lines of sight ( which will terminate at the centroids ) .",
    "these are chosen by rotating a region s centroid around the @xmath69-axis by multiples of some angle that depends on the size ( radius ) of the region .",
    "the choice of angle is such that the larger a region s size , the more starting points it will have , and thus the region will be divided into more elements of solid angle .",
    "we use the line of sight between the `` centroids '' of regions and this series of starting points to calculate the contributions of every other region ( or the region to itself ) to a given recipient region s @xmath20 .",
    "we calculate the optical depth of each intervening region , along the line of sight , based on the molecular population levels of the intervening regions .",

    "these `` integration lines '' encapsulate the main part ( within the square brackets in equation [ fullydiscreteeqn ] ) of the calculation of @xmath20 .",
    "we approximate the solid angle subtended by the integration lines from another region s centroid by integrating @xmath77 sin@xmath78 from zero up to the mean value of the angles between the starting point of that region , the centroid of the recipient region and the multiple `` corners '' of that region around the starting point .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] . )",
    "effectively , this gives a solid angle between regions of @xmath79 cos@xmath80 .",
    "note that due to these approximations , the sum of solid angles over all integration lines between a region and all regions in a given shell exterior to the region is _ not _ necessarily constrained to exactly equal @xmath58 , as it should be in reality .",
    "therefore , in calculating a `` @xmath20 '' value , we sum the solid angles involved and average over that sum instead of @xmath58 steradians ( as eqns .",

    "unlike the plane - parallel situation , the flux exiting the surface of the coma ( or other sphere of interest ) is not simply a single value ( per wavenumber ) that has been integrated over angle . in the spherical situation ,",

    "we can also specify the density of and interval between points on this plane for which the output intensities will be calculated .",
    "each point in this planar mapping shows the intensity ( or surface brightness ) integrated along a specific line of sight , perpendicular to the plane , through the coma from one side to the other ( again , for each wavenumber ) .    @xmath85    where @xmath86 is the source function of a region @xmath49 , @xmath87 is the line width of wavenumber / frequency @xmath88 in region @xmath49 , and @xmath89 , or @xmath90 , represents the optical depth of wavenumber @xmath88 in region @xmath49 or @xmath50 along the relevant line of sight .",

    "several forms of data presentation for simulating observations are described in the following section .",

    "for the 0@xmath98 , 45@xmath98 , and 90@xmath98phase angles , the minimum values of the ratio of the band total flux over the column density are roughly @xmath124 photons s@xmath16 molecule@xmath16 . from 90@xmath98 , through 135@xmath98and",
    "down to 180@xmath98the values go down monotonically to a minimum of about @xmath125 .",

    "the first is attenuation of incident solar light from the sunward to anti - sunward sides of the coma , leading to less fluorescent pumping , and thus less emission , towards the anti - sunward direction .",
    "second , whatever emission there is is more likely to `` escape '' the coma over shorter optical depths - i.e. closer to where it is emitted .",
    "thus the already greater emission of the sunward regions is also more likely to be observed along azimuthal directions closer to sunward .",

    "( the calculated values also show considerably more spread among azimuthal angles than the profiles of flux over column density . ) this symmetrical and non - monotonic pattern is less intuitive than the trend of @xmath111 above .",
    "yet it is clearly understood in light of the fact that these values are based only on the actual population distributions in different regions and do _ not _ include optical depth effects on the emergent radiation . thus observing from azimuthal angles 0@xmath98and 180@xmath98are sampling exactly the same lines of sight and regions populations , including the darkest ( i.e. least excited populations ) of the anti - sunward side of the coma .",
    "the same is essentially true for 45@xmath98and 135@xmath98(due to symmetry around the z - axis ) but they do not sample the darkest parts of the anti - sunward directions ( and the differences in populations are less between outermost regions on the sunward side among azimuthal angles between @xmath9945  they are all experiencing direct solar illumination ) . for 90@xmath98the higher cluster",
    "is sampling from more excited and higher emmision populations than the lower cluster , and consistently so all the way along their lines of sight ( which is not true for 45@xmath98and 135@xmath98 ) .",

    "this is mostly due to the temperature profile reaching its minimal values at these radii in conjunction with the higher density of the @xmath128 case .",
    "the higher density leads to this still being a collsionally dominated regime , and the low temperatures lead to the lowest population levels being most highly populated",
    ". these levels also have the highest einstein a values , thus leading to higher overall number of photons emitted for the same number of molecules .",
    "the effect is greatest for the 180@xmath98view due to a cumulative effect  the lines of sight all sample the most dense and cold regions at these radii .",
    "the same extreme effect is not seen for the 0@xmath98phase angle due to the overall greater fluorescent excitation of the sunward regions dominating it .",
    "( note that the difference in total brightness between the two azimuthal angles at these radii is about a factor of two . )",
    "if one is observing with high spectral resolution but low spatial resolution , the spectra observed will be the sum of as much of the coma as fills the field of view . to model this",
    ", we have simulated `` aperture averaged '' spectra , where the `` aperture '' controls the area of the coma sampled .",
    "our apertures are square boxes and are all centered exactly on the center of the comet , and sample a nucleus centered area equal to the square of the `` aperture size '' over which we average the brightness .",
    "we present a series of apertures from @xmath129 km ( very near the nucleus ) through @xmath130 km ( the whole coma ) for each of the three production rates .",

    "@xmath92 , as in chin & weaver 1984 . )    band shape for apertures including the outer coma ( approximately @xmath131 km ) does not change significantly for different production rates .",
    "the total brightness for this regime increases approximately in linear proportion to production rate .",
    "this is due to spectra with such large aperture sizes being dominated by the fluorescence dominated optically thin outer coma with optical depth effects playing a minimal role .",
    "( but not entirely non - existent : note the small , @xmath132 reduction in g - factor with higher production rate for @xmath133 km . )    in the inner coma , however , optical depth effects can be very striking .",
    "the `` thickest '' spectra ( for higher production rates and smaller @xmath134 ) have remarkably altered band shapes from the optically thin spectra .    first , however , a word about changes that are _ not _ specifically caused by optical depth effects .",
    "it is clear that there is much variation , even within a given production rate , from large to small aperture sizes .",
    "not all of this is due to optical depth effects . even in our optically thin case , the band shape changes noticably in breadth",
    "this occurs primarily due to the temperature profile .",
    "we have used a fairly simplified profile , which can be scaled to a surface temperature parameter , but does not vary much otherwise between different model cases .",
    "this provides a straightforward `` control '' for this aspect of spectral change with aperture size .    in the innermost coma near the nucleus ,",
    "the temperature is quite warm ( @xmath116100 - 200k ) , which leads to a broader band in the 10 km spectrum .",
    "the coma gas cools to a minimum ( @xmath11620k ) around 100 - 200 km out from the nucleus , which produces a much narrowed band .",
    "since the einstein a coefficient for the lowest j lines is higher than for the lines in the `` wings '' of the band , the cold temperature also increases the g - factor , even in optically thick regions . at larger radii ,",
    "the temperature rises again , but becomes less significant since the coma gets less dense and tends towards fluorescent equilibrium . between these regimes , in a `` transition region , '' there are still optical depth effects , which can be more easily isolated as g - factors are less temperature controlled .",
    "temperature is also a factor in determining doppler broadening and line width , which is proprtional to @xmath135 , so the ratio between line widths for the coldest and the warmest regions of the coma are about 2 - 3 , for a given wavenumber .",
    "this may lead to temperature playing a significant role in the optical thickness of the coma to incident solar radiation .",
    "temperature effects notwithstanding , the spectra from the denser near - nucleus regions of a coma show optical depth effects in several aspects .",
    "in addition to the total brightness no longer increasing linearly with production rate ( and a corresponding reduction of g - factors ) , energy is also dramatically shifted between lines within the band .",
    "the notable shifting of flux from r branch to p branch ( evident in many of the thicker spectra ) , and to lower wavenumbers in both branches ( as is most evident in the @xmath136100 & 200 km spectra for @xmath137 s@xmath16 ) , are very noticeable optical depth effects .",
    "( see sahai & wannier 1985 , for an analytical discussion of similar effects . )",
    "this effect appears due to the branching ratio of a given pair of p and r branch lines originating in the same upper level , which generally ( slightly ) favors emission in the p branch line . in optically thick cases , repeated",
    "absorption and emission of photons leads to a cumulative effect which favors the p branch over the r branch much more than in optically thin conditions ( where it is probable that any emitted photon will not be re - absorbed before escaping the coma ) .",
    "similarly , flux is `` pushed '' outwards in the branches , and more so in the p branch due to combination with the above effect .",
    "this is due to the lines closer to the center of the band becoming optically thick before those in the wings ( both due to their higher einstein coefficients and generally being more populated . )",
    "flux initially emitted in lines that are optically thick will through repeated absorption and emission be forced out into lines that are less thick .",
    "as seen above , the p branch total brightness and the r branch total brightness vary with respect to each other over different optical depths ( as well as other factors , such as temperature distribution . )",
    "the ratio of the sums of p / r branches brightnesses can be useful to alert an observer ( or anyone analyzing observations ) that they must in a given case beware of , and if possible account for , optical depth effects .",
    "this alone , would not be sufficient , as temperatures along a given line of sight are also a significant factor in controlling the p / r ratio , in the collisionally dominated inner coma .",
    "colder population distributions will emit more in the lower lines ( in both branches ) for which the ratio of p / r for each pair of lines originating in the same upper state is greater . also , @xmath60 will effectively vary inversely with linewidth , other factors being equal .",
    "use of a model like ours can show where the p / r ratio is large due to temperature and where ( its excess beyond that value is ) due to optical depth . in our optically thin , @xmath114 s@xmath16 , model the p / r ratio does not exceed @xmath1161.44 , even for aperture sizes dominated by the coldest portion of the coma .",

    "we have coded the aglorithm described above in the c++ language , using numerous functions from press , et al .",
    "1992 , primarily to implement numerical integration of functions ( with * odeint * and * stifbs * and associated functions ) and solution of n - dimensional non - linear matrices with newton s method ( using * newt * , and associated functions ) .",
    "the bulk of the coding , which implements the radiative transfer algorithm in spherical geometry is our own .",
    "a major practical limitation of our algorithm is the matrix size ; since newton s method requires ( repeated ) @xmath142 matrix solving operations ( for which * newt * uses the brute force approach of * ludcmp * and * lubksb * ) , the algorithm can get prohibitively slow for large matrices . for example , on an intel core computer ( with cpu speed of 2.9 ghz and 7.6 gb of memory ) running scientific linux 6.3 ( carbon ) , when n @xmath143 15,000 , a solution may take one or more days . for greater sizes , even a week .",
    "the matrix size equals the number of molecular levels used times the number of regions .",
    "the molecule ( and band / s ) being modeled determines the first value , with the latter value demanding to be increased with greater optical depths and production rates .",
    "depending on the species of interest , the maximum practical production rates we can currently manage on such a system are of @xmath144 .",
    "the most simple workaround is to use a more powerful computer .",
    "algorithms for solving sparse matrices faster than the above functions can also be used , and we have begun to explore this option .    in implementing the cep method , and our adaptation to spherical geometry , we have created c++ classes for diatomic and triatomic molecules .",
    "the object oriented programming style of c++ lends itself ideally to being able to switch molecules easily .",
    "the * diatomic * molecule class and its subclasses ( currently implemented for * co * and * sio * ) calculate energies and einstein coefficients based on constants ( taken primarily from krupenie 1966 , for co ) that are included in the code .",
    "the * triatomic * class , which can actually be used for other polyatomic molecules as well ( or the aforementioned diatomic molecules themselves , for that matter ) , must be provided with energies and coefficients from some outside source in formatted input files .",
    "we used the hitran database ( see rothman , et al .",
    "1998 ) to supply these values for co@xmath141 and h@xmath141o .",
    "this approach has the versatility to handle many other molecules with a minimal effort of `` data massaging '' to get the data into the proper format .",
    "we have also created a large number of classes which encapsulate the spherical geometry and the attendant calculations .",
    "these are all `` controlled '' by the * comet * class that reads parameters for a given case from a `` comet definition file '' ( a text file of key / value pairs , essentially ) and , using the above classes , sets up and runs the model for a given case .",
    "although designed specifically with comets in mind , our code is versatile enough to be used in other spherical radiative transfer problems as well .",
    "straightforward input files describe all the required and optional parameters for a specific comet model or other problem , including molecule of interest , size of nucleus and radial shells , production rate , morphology ( if any ) , incident radiation , etc .",
    "the c++ code outputs a file containing a point - by - point line - by - line spectral mapping , as described above , for one or more specified viewing orientations .",
    "this data can then be presented in multiple formats as described above in section 3 .",
    "we have implemented this data presentation portion of the model using various short idl programs which we have developed , each specifically for the purpose of producing a given type of graphical output .",
