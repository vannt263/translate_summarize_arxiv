    "in principle , a significant role of mergers implied by the hierarchical paradigm for the galaxy evolution must result in frequent visible misalignments of rotation momentum between various stellar and gaseous galactic subsystems . especially it must be true for non - cluster lenticular galaxies whose origin should be probably due to minor merger events .",
    "however , findings of extended counterrotating gaseous disks are still rare . in the sa - galaxy ngc",
    "3626 @xcite , in the s0 ngc  4546 @xcite , and in the sb - galaxy ngc  7742 @xcite all the gas counterrotates the stars . in the sa - galaxies",
    "ngc  3593 @xcite , ngc  7217 @xcite , ngc  5719 @xcite , and ngc  4138 @xcite the counterrotating gas is already partly processed into stars , so these galaxies have two stellar counterrotating disks one of which corotates the gas . in ngc  4550",
    "one can see already the full - size counterrotating stellar disk whereas the counterrotating gas is mainly exhausted @xcite ; the similar situation may be suspected in ngc  7331 @xcite . in the sab - galaxy ngc  4826 @xcite and in the s0 ngc  1596",
    "@xcite the outer gas counterrotates the inner parts of the galaxies , certainly being accreted quite recently .",
    "these few examples include almost all known extended counterrotating subsystems .",
    "statistical estimates by @xcite and @xcite put an upper limit of 8% 12%  of all spiral , s0/a - scd , galaxies to possess such structures . for s0 galaxies the appearance of counterrotating gas may be more frequent , @xcite gives the estimate of @xmath0% ; it can be consistent with the idea of s0 galaxy ( trans-)formation from a spiral by minor merger : in such event some external gas with decoupled momentum must be accreted . but in s0 galaxies the counterrotating gas is observed to be mostly confined to the very central part of the galaxies as it can be seen in the sample by @xcite ; the extended counterrotating gaseous disks are rare in s0s as extended gaseous disks in general .",
    "another related phenomenon is inner gaseous polar disks in disk galaxies @xcite .",
    "we found them as well in s0 galaxies with generally small amount of gas @xcite as in spiral galaxies with normal extended hi disks ",
    "ngc  2841 @xcite , ngc  7217 @xcite , ngc  7468 @xcite . for the inner polar disk origin",
    "the most popular hypothesis is also external gas accretion ; however in some cases dynamical simulations predict strongly inclined circumnuclear gaseous disks produced by secular evolution processes .",
    "the simulations by @xcite of the isolated stellar - gaseous disk evolution gave such ` polar disks ' as a result of gas redistribution in the global disk of a galaxy , if initially all the gas in the disk counterrotated the stars .",
    "interestingly , the old question , what is the primary , a hen or an egg , is still actual concerning this problem . @xcite obtained the similar configuration , the inner polar disk plus the outer counterrotating gas , starting from a single inner polar disk : in a tumbling triaxial potential the outer parts of the gaseous polar disk warped in their model so that the outer gas counterrotated the stars almost in the main symmetry plane . by paying attention to the outer extension of the inner gaseous polar disks found by us ,",
    "we have revealed indeed some cases of the configuration required , the inner polar disk plus the more outer counterrotation : these are the lenticular galaxies ngc  7280 and ngc  7332 @xcite , ic  1548 @xcite , and the late - type spiral galaxy ngc  7625 @xcite .",
    "an exceptionality of the extended counterrotating disks means that there must exist some additional conditions for a disk galaxy to retain large masses of accreted counterrotating gas ; perhaps , it may be a very low rate of the acquisition process @xcite , or an absence of large amount of initial , ` own ' galactic gas in the recipient galaxy @xcite . every new disk galaxy with a globally counterrotating gas component may in principle help to determine these conditions .",
    "in this paper we report a discovery of two more extended counterrotating gaseous disks in early - type disk galaxies .",
    "we present the results of the kinematical study of the nearby s0 galaxies ngc  2551 and ngc  5631 .",
    "ngc  2551 and ngc  5631 considered in this paper are early - type disk galaxies of intermediate luminosity .",
    "both belong to spiral - dominated groups @xcite , and both have a substantial amount of rotating neutral hydrogen with unknown sense of rotation , according to single - dish radioobservations at 21 cm @xcite . their main parameters retrieved in databases and from literature are presented in the table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "the layout of the paper is the following . in section  2",
    "we describe our observations , our data reduction and some additional information . in section  3",
    "we present the counterrotating gaseous disk in ngc  2551 , and in section  4  the complex kinematics including inclined counterrotating stellar - gaseous disk in ngc  5631 .",

    "to study the rotation of stars and ionized gas , we use spectral data obtained for ngc  2551 and ngc  5631 with three different spectrograph .",
    "the multi - pupil fiber spectrograph ( mpfs ) of the russian 6 m telescope @xcite is an integral - field unit constructed following the fiber - lens principle ; due to this feature it allows to obtain panoramic spectral data over a wide spectral range ( in our case , over 1500    with the spectral resolution of 3   ) .",
    "the field of view is @xmath20 , with the sampling of @xmath21 per microlens .",
    "we observed ngc  2551 and ngc  5631 in the green spectral range containing a lot of absorption lines and calculated the line - of - sight ( los ) stellar velocities by cross - correlating continuum - substracted and logarithmically - binned galactic spectra with the similarly prepaired spectra of the twilight ( the sun spectrum , of g2 spectral type ) and of g- and k - giant stars observed the same nights as the galaxies  hd  19476 ( k0iii ) for ngc  2551 and hd  135722 ( g8iii ) and hd  167042 ( k1iii ) for ngc  5631 .",
    "for ngc  2551 , also the red spectral range has been exposed to make gauss - fitting of the [ nii]@xmath226583 emission line and to estimate the los velocities of the ionized gas .",
    "the statistical accuracy of one - element los velocity and velocity dispersion estimates with the mpfs data is about 10 km / s .    in 2007",
    "the galaxy ngc  5631 was also observed with another integral - field spectrograph , the sauron of the william herschel telescope at la palma @xcite .",
    "we have retrieved these data from the open ing archive of the cambridge astronomical data center and have reduced them in our manner calculating the stellar los velocities by cross - correlation with the spectrum of a star observed the same night ( hd  72184 , k2 iii , this time ) and by calculating the gas los velocities by measuring the baricenter positions of the [ oiii]@xmath225007 emission line in the continuum - subtracted spectra . the field of view of the sauron is @xmath23 , with the sampling of @xmath24 ; the spectral resolution is 4   , and the spectral range is narrow , 48005350   , because it is a tiger - mode integral - field spectrograph .    after discovering central gas counterrotation in both galaxies with the integral - field spectroscopic data , we have wanted to know a full extension of the counterrotating gas systems . to check it ,",
    "we have observed the galaxies with the spectrograph scorpio of the 6 m telescope in the long - slit mode @xcite .",
    "the slit , which length is about 6 arcmin , has been aligned with the kinematical major axis of the central los velocity fields . the red spectral range , 61007100   , with a @xmath25 spectral resolution , has been exposed to measure first of all the los velocities of the strongest emission line in the optical spectral range , [ nii]@xmath226583 , which is free of the underlying absorption contamination unlike the h@xmath26 .",
    "however , the los velocity and stellar velocity dispersion profiles for the stellar components have been also estimated by cross - correlating galactic spectra binned along the slit with a template star spectrum from the library miles @xcite . through the library we chose spectra of the stars",
    "hd  48433 ( k1iii ) and hd  10380 ( k3iii ) which provided the largest amplitudes of the cross - correlation function with the spectra of ngc  2551 and ngc  5631 respectively .",
    "we measured the errors of the stellar velocity and velocity dispersion by using the formulae from the classical paper by @xcite .",
    "the uncertainties of the ionized - gas kinematical parameters were estimated by monte carlo simulations of artificial spectra with the noise distribution similar to that of the original data .",
    "the log of observations is given in table  [ tab2 ] .    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,>,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      +     +   +    to analyze the morphological structure of the galaxies , we have also used surface photometric data obtained by reducing the digital images from the hst archive ( ngc  2551 , acs / f625w ) and from the sdss / dr6 @xcite data collection ( ngc  5631 , @xmath27-filters ) .",
    "figure  1 presents the los velocity fields for the stellar and gaseous components in the center of ngc  2551 which we have obtained with the mpfs .",
    "the seeing quality has been much worse during the red - range mpfs exposure , so the visible gas rotation seems to be slower than that of the stars ; it is an effect of smearing the steep velocity gradient by poor spatial resolution . in general , fig .",
    "1 is intended only to demonstrate gas counterrotation with respect to the stars in the center of the galaxy .",
    "the directions of the kinematical major axis which is defined as a direction of the maximum los velocity gradient are @xmath28 for the stellar component and @xmath29 for the ionized gas .",
    "the former value coincides with the photometrical major axis direction , @xmath30 at @xmath31 according to the hst data , implying an axisymmetric character of the galaxy kinematics and structure .",
    "indeed , ngc  2551 is known to be unbarred , and its photometric major axis direction , @xmath32 , is constant along the full radial extension @xcite .",
    "the fact that the isophote ellipticity reaches its maximum , @xmath33 , already at @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) implies that the galaxy is disk - dominated .",
    "this conclusion is confirmed by the major - axis surface brightness profile decomposition by @xcite : according to their model , the regular exponential disk dominates in the brightness profile of ngc  2551 starting from @xmath36 .",
    "the next question which arose after the gas counterrotation was found with the mpfs , was if we deal with the central decoupled gas subsystem , or the counterrotating gas is extended over the whole galaxy .",
    "the scorpio gas and stellar los velocity profiles obtained at @xmath37 ( fig .  2 ) demonstrate persistence of the gas - star counterrotation up to @xmath38 at least .",
    "the gas rotation curve is rather flat and extended to @xmath39 .",
    "the projected gas rotation velocity , 150 km / s , exceeds even the aperture hi value from @xcite ( table  1 ) so @xmath37 may be well the global disk line - of - nodes direction . in general , the data favor coplanar stellar and gaseous disks in ngc  2551 though rotating in opposite senses .",
    "figure  3 presents the stellar and gas los velocity fields for the center of ngc  5631 constructing by using the data of the mpfs and the sauron ; the los velocities of the ionized gas have been calculated by measuring the baricenter positions of the emission line [ oiii]@xmath225007 . the stars and the ionized gas counterrotate over the whole field of view of the mpfs , and there is a hint of the rotation reverse for the stars at the edges of the sauron field of view .",
    "the orientations of the kinematical major axes within @xmath40 from the center , @xmath41 for the stars and @xmath42 for the ionized gas are consistent with each other and with the photometric major axis orientation in the central part of the galaxy , @xmath43 , implying coplanar axisymmetric rotation .",
    "+    the long - slit cross - sections made with the scorpio have shown that the gaseous disk which rotation we observe in the center of ngc  5631 is rather extended : we see the measurable emission lines up to @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) ( fig .",
    "the gas excitation is shock - like over the full extension of the visible emission : the [ nii]@xmath226583 emission line is everywhere stronger than the h@xmath26 one .",
    "the maximum projected rotation velocity reaches about 170 km / s being again consistent with the integrated hi data @xcite .",
    "the stellar component counterrotates the ionized gas up to @xmath46 . at @xmath47",
    "the projected rotation velocity of the stars falls to zero .",
    "interestingly , the same character of the stellar los velocity profile was found by @xcite who obtained a long - slit cross - section at @xmath48 : the maximum velocity , @xmath49 km / s , was reached at @xmath50 , then the velocity curve falled , passed through zero at @xmath51 , and reversed its sense at @xmath52 .",
    "the stellar velocity dispersion profile at @xmath53 demonstrates some rise at @xmath54 .",
    "this feature becomes understandable if we look directly at the losvd shape ( fig .",
    "5 ) . at @xmath55 and at @xmath56",
    "the losvd becomes asymmetric with the hint on two peaks and remains two - peaked up to the limit of our measurements , @xmath57 .",
    "this fact results in the visible increase of the stellar velocity dispersion and in the visible fall of the projected rotation velocity to zero : two counterrotating stellar components compensate each other being approximated by a single gaussian losvd .",
    "the isophote behavior is not so simple in ngc  5631 as in ngc  2551 : though the galaxy is unbarred , the isophotes of the central part , within @xmath58 from the center , are more elliptical than those of the outer disk , and their major axis is turning perhaps between @xmath59 and @xmath60 from @xmath61 to @xmath62 ( fig .",
    "the shape of the brightness profiles which we have derived from the sdss data by averaging the counts per arcsec over the ellipses with the parameters found by the isophote analysis allows to divide the whole galaxy into three main components ( fig .",
    "the outer exponential stellar disk dominating at @xmath63 is seen face - on : the ellipticity of the isophotes is less than 0.05 , and the orientation of the major axis can not be determined . the inner exponential stellar component ( inner disk ? ) is clearly seen in the radius range of @xmath64 ; the orientation of the isophote major axis is @xmath65 , and the isophote ellipticity after subtracting the outer disk stays at 0.170.18 implying an inclination of @xmath66 under the assumption of a rather thin disk .",
    "the surface brightness profile of the bulge , @xmath67 , can be approximated by a sersic law with @xmath68 with a high accuracy ; however , the isophote ellipticity and major - axis orientation within this central zone do not stay constant along the radius .",
    "the recent work by @xcite suggests the brightness profile decomposition of ngc  5631 into only two components , the sersic bulge and the single exponential disk ; but as one can see in fig .  7",
    ", their use of the shallow 2mass photometry does not allow them to measure the outer stellar disk in ngc  5631 .",
    "the change of the stellar rotation direction takes place within the inner disk ; the isophote ellipticity does not fall to zero at @xmath69 , on the contrary , it stays constant at 0.170.18 .",
    "so we conclude that the observed stellar los velocity behavior can not be due to a rotation plane warp in the nearly face - on galaxy , but is indeed a manifestation of the switch of the mean stellar rotation direction inside the zone of the photometric dominance of the inner stellar disk .",
    "fortunately , we can say something about the gas plane orientation too . figure  8",
    "presents a color map of ngc  5631 that we have constructed by using the sdss data ; for the sdss survey description ",
    "see @xcite .",
    "at the radius of @xmath70 one can see a broad red ( dust ) ring .",
    "more exactly we see a half of the dust ring , the other half being hidden behind the bulge . since the gas is thought to be coupled with the dust , we can estimate an inclination and line - of - nodes orientation of the gas plane at @xmath70 under the assumption of its circular shape .",
    "it appears to be @xmath71 ( just as the inner stellar isophotes and the kinematical major axes are directed ! ) and @xmath72  just as the stellar isophotes within the inner disk .",
    "then the deprojected gas rotation velocity under the assumption of @xmath73 is around 360390 km / s within the model of circular rotation that is high but not exceptional .",
    "some asymmetry of the stellar los velocity profiles in fig .  4 could be then explained if we assume that the inclined gaseous disk with the orientation parameters deduced above contains also some stellar component , and both are coupled with the inner stellar disk derived from the surface brightness profile decomposition .",
    "then the dusty stellar disk dominating photometrically in the radius range of @xmath74 and inclined with respect to the face - on main stellar disk would completely hide the main stellar component to the north of the center ; just this picture is observed in the cross - section at @xmath75 .",
    "the slit at @xmath53 projected to the west below the line of nodes of this dusty disk , catches the rotation of the main stellar component ( a long western receding velocity branch , fig .",
    "4 _ a _ ) . and",
    "both cross - sections in their eastern parts demonstrate the zero mean los velocities and the visible stellar velocity dispersion raising up to 180 km / s at @xmath76 which can be treated as a superposition of two comparable stellar components counterrotating each other .",
    "both ngc  2551 and ngc  5631 possess the extended ( up to 0.71.0@xmath3 , or up to 57 kpc from the center ) counterrotating gaseous disks .",
    "both galaxies belong to loose groups dominating by spiral galaxies @xcite .",
    "however either ngc  2551 nor ngc 5631 have a close neighbor within the circle of 100 kpc radius , to provide interaction and smooth gas accretion that is suggested by @xcite to be the most probable mechanism of massive counterrotating disk formation .",
    "the only alternative which is available for ngc  2551 and ngc  5631 is a minor merger with a gas - rich satellite .",
    "we do not know what morphological type the galaxies ngc  2551 and ngc  5631 had before their merging , and if they have had their own ( corotating ) gas .",
    "but in any case the accreted gas had to suffer instaneous star formation triggered by shock compression during the merging .",
    "perhaps , in ngc  2551 and ngc  5631 we see different stages of the same process .",
    "ultraviolet imaging with the uit and later on with the galex has revealed an extended , up to @xmath77 , star - forming disk in ngc  2551 @xcite .",
    "an intensity ratio h@xmath26/[nii ] observed by us with the scorpio implies an excitation by young stars up to @xmath78 ; however between @xmath77 and @xmath79 we see only one emission line , [ nii]@xmath226583 , so in this ring the gas excitation may be of shock origin . in ngc  5631",
    "there is no current star formation in the counterrotating gaseous disk , and the gas is excited by shock over the full extension of the gaseous disk .",
    "perhaps , it is the preceding evolutionary stage with respect to ngc  2551 , the accreted gas disk has not yet settled into the symmetry plane of the main galaxy , and star formation is only going to start in the compressed inner dusty ring at @xmath80 . and",
    "what may be the subsequent stage ?",
    "perhaps , it is ngc  4138 where a counterrotating extended gas is supplemented by the substantial counterrotating young stellar component @xcite  the evident consequence of the star formation in the counterrotating gaseous disk .    to give a conclusion",
    ", we summarize that by applying complex spectral methods including integral - field spectroscopy to the central parts of the galaxies and long - slit deep spectroscopy to probe the external parts , we have found two more global gas counterrotating systems in non - interacting early - type disk galaxies . in ngc  2551 two counterrotating disks , gaseous and stellar ones ,",
    "may be coplanar : the orientation parameters of the optical - band image and of the uv - band , star - formation related image are similar . in ngc  5631 the gaseous disk",
    "is inclined by some @xmath81 to the main stellar disk ; it may contain also significant coupled stellar component .",
    "the totality of the spectral and photometric data give evidence for the minor merging as the most probable origin of the counterrotating gas in these galaxies .",
    "perhaps , we observe two different stages of the process of lenticular galaxy formation in rather sparse group environments .",
