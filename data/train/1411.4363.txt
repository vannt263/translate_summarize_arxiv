    "the observations of high energy @xmath0-rays from the galactic center ( gc ) have revealed very interesting features at different scales .",
    "the atmospheric imaging cherenkov telescope array , high energy stereoscopic system ( hess ) , has discovered a point - like source by whipple . ] which may be originated from the central supermassive black hole as well as an extended source from the ridge which could be explained through the interaction of a fresh cosmic ray ( cr ) source with the interstellar medium ( ism ) @xcite .",
    "the analyses of the data from the space - borne @xmath0-ray detector , fermi large area telescope ( fermi - lat ) , have also revealed the corresponding point - like @xcite and ridge emission @xcite .",
    "moreover , an even more extended , circular @xmath0-ray excess on top of the central point and ridge emission has been identified in the fermi - lat data by quite a few groups @xcite .",
    "finally , the bubble structure on the galactic scale has also been shown in the fermi - lat data . those multi - scale , wide - band features",
    "have very interesting implications of the gc activity and stellar history @xcite .",
    "the circularly symmetric @xmath0-ray excess is of special interest since it may connect with the emission from dark matter ( dm ) annihilation in the gc @xcite .",
    "the de - projected spatial distribution of the @xmath0-ray source follows approximately @xmath2 , with @xmath3 the angle away from the gc , which seems to be consistent with the dm annihilation with a generalized navarro - frenk - white ( gnfw , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) density profile .",
    "the energy spectrum peaks at several gev , and can be well fitted with the scenario of dm annihilation into a pair of quarks or @xmath4 leptons with mass of dm particles @xmath5s gev @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the astrophysical scenarios such as a population of unresolved millisecond pulsars , as well as the cr interactions in the gc may also account for this @xmath0-ray excess @xcite . on the other hand , other observations of crs and radio emission",
    "seem to have tension with the dm annihilation scenario , although they still suffer from uncertainties @xcite .",
    "the origin of the @xmath0-ray excess is still in debate , and we may need future , multi - wavelength observations to test different models .",
    "the msp scenario is favored for several reasons .",
    "the spectrum of the gev @xmath0-ray excess is very similar to those observed for msps @xcite and for some of the globular clusters .",
    "the msps are old enough to extend to relatively large scale which can possibly explain the large extension of the gev @xmath0-ray excess @xcite .",
    "the observed distribution of the galactic low mass x - ray binaries , the progenitors of msps , just follows the @xmath2 profile as observed for the @xmath0-ray signal @xcite .",
    "if there is a population of unresolved @xmath0-ray msps in the galactic bulge to contribute to the @xmath0-ray excess , one would naturally expect that a portion ( probably most ) of the spin - down energy should be carried by the relativistic @xmath1 winds from those pulsars .",
    "such wind @xmath1 may further be accelerated up to very high energies ( vhe ; tev energies ) in the shocks produced by the pulsar winds @xcite",
    ". then these leptons will diffuse into the ism in the galaxy , and radiate through inverse compton scattering ( ics ) , bremsstrahlung and synchrotron emission .",
    "since the @xmath1 wind generally dominates the energy budget over the gev @xmath0-rays from pulsars , we should investigate such emission from @xmath1 .",
    "the future observations of the vhe @xmath0-rays from the gc region by e.g. , the cherenkov telescope array ( cta , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , could test the msp scenario of the fermi gev @xmath0-ray excess , and may distinguish it from the dm scenario @xcite .    in this work",
    "we explore the vhe @xmath0-ray emission associated with the relativistic @xmath1 winds from the gc msps , using the fermi @xmath0-ray excess as a normalization of the msp population . in sec .",
    "2 we briefly describe the @xmath1 production model of msps",
    ". the major results of the vhe @xmath0-ray emission from the msp @xmath1 and the detectability with cta will be given in sec .",
    "we conclude and discuss the results in sec .",
    "it has been well established that the rotation - powered pulsars release most of their rotational energy as a relativistic wind of magnetized @xmath1 plasma from the magnetosphere @xcite .",
    "the interaction of such a wind with the ism will then form a shock , which can also accelerate the @xmath1 to vhe .",
    "the synchrotron or ics emission from these @xmath1 form the so - called pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) .",
    "assuming that the pulsar spin - down power is predominately carried away by the kinetic energy of the wind particles , one has @xcite",
    "@xmath6 where @xmath7 is the spin - down power of the pulsar , @xmath8 is the lorentz factor of the wind particles , @xmath9 is the goldreich - julian current @xcite , @xmath10 is the electron mass , @xmath11 is the speed of light , @xmath12 is the @xmath1 pair multiplicity , @xmath13 is the magnetization parameter ( the ratio of the poynting flux to the kinetic energy flux ) , and @xmath14 is the relative energy fraction carried by @xmath1 particles . for typical parameters of msps ,",
    "the lorentz factor of the wind particles can be derived as @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the spin - down power in unit of @xmath17 erg s@xmath18 , and @xmath19 .",
    "the spin - down power carried away by the @xmath1 pairs is simply @xmath20 .",
    "typically we will have @xmath21 .",
    "the energy distribution of the wind @xmath1 could be relativistic maxwellian .",
    "for simplicity we adopt monochromatic injection of the wind @xmath1 for the case without considering the possible acceleration or cooling in the pwn ( see below ) .",
    "the pulsar winds may further be accelerated in the shock region if exists @xcite . in the gc stellar cluster",
    ", the maximum achievable energy of the @xmath1 can be as high as @xmath22 tev @xcite .",
    "the fraction of @xmath1 which are accelerated , and the final spectrum of the accelerated @xmath1 are not clear .",
    "we may simply assume a power - law spectrum with an exponential cutoff at the maximum energy @xcite .",
    "the total power of the accelerated @xmath1 can be absorbed in the efficiency @xmath14 .",
    "finally , the @xmath1 may radiate and lose energy inside the pwn .",
    "for the young pulsar ( e.g. , crab ) , most of the spin - down energy is released through synchrotron radiation in the nebula .",
    "however , it may not be the case for the msps since they are generally old and their pwne are so extended that the magnetic field is weak @xcite .",
    "therefore we assume a fraction of the @xmath1 can escape away from the pwn into the ism of the galaxy , and absorb this fraction in the efficiency @xmath14 .    as for the spatial distribution of the @xmath1 injection",
    ", we adopt the result inferred from the @xmath0-ray excess , i.e. , a spherical power - law distribution @xmath23 which extends to @xmath24 kpc ( @xmath25 ) @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-ray emission ( @xmath1 source ) may extend to even large scales @xcite .",
    "however , it will not significantly affect the results of the current study which focuses on the gc region .    in summary",
    ", we will discuss either monochromatic or power - law injection of @xmath1 in the extended region around the gc , which represent the scenario without or with acceleration in the pulsar wind shocks , respectively .",
    "the canonical model parameters of the @xmath1 are tabulated in table [ table : model ] .",
    "furthermore , we will assume that the typical @xmath0-ray efficiency with respect to the spin - down power is @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "thus we have @xmath27 .",
    ".injection @xmath1 parameters : injection energy @xmath28 for the monochromatic case , spectral index @xmath29 and cutoff energy @xmath30 for the power - law case , and the @xmath1 energy fraction of the spindown power @xmath14 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table : prop ]            the calculated ics and bremsstrahlung spectra from the propagated @xmath1 produced by the msps in @xmath31 region around the gc are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : sed_mono ] and [ fig : sed_power ] , for the monochromatic injection and the power - law injection , respectively .",
    "the fermi - lat data of the @xmath0-ray excess @xcite , together with the direct @xmath0-ray emission expected from a population of msps @xcite are also shown .",
    "the results show that there is indeed a vhe component , mainly from the ics off the starlight , if the injection energies of the @xmath1 are high enough . for the monochromatic injection case with @xmath32 gev",
    ", the ics emission falls in the same energy window of the current gc excess .",
    "it may contribute partially to the observed signal .",
    "however , the spatial morphology of this ics component should be different from the direct @xmath0-ray emission from msps ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sky1 - 10 ] ) . for @xmath33 gev case ,",
    "if @xmath34 the ics emission will exceed the fermi - lat data above several gev . it may indicate that the @xmath1 efficiency may not be as high as @xmath35 , or such a high energy tail is missed in the fermi - lat data analysis because of the different morphology .",
    "there is a bump of the @xmath0-ray emission at @xmath36 gev corresponding to @xmath33 gev , and might be detectable by future vhe observations . for the power - law injection model ,",
    "the spectrum of the vhe component is shallower and can probably extend to much higher energies .            in order to have a rough idea of the detectability of this vhe emission",
    ", we compare it with the hess detected diffuse ridge emission , integrated in the region @xmath37 , @xmath38 in figs .",
    "[ fig : sed_mono ] and [ fig : sed_power ] @xcite .",
    "the vhe component from the msps could be comparable or even brighter than the ridge emission , although it is more extended . given the much better sensitivity of the future vhe experiments such as cta , it should be possible to detect such a bright source @xcite .    due to the extension of the emission , the nearly isotropic electron background will contaminate the detection .",
    "the spectrum of the total @xmath1 based on ams-02 @xcite and hess @xcite measurements are also shown by the gray line in figs .",
    "[ fig : sed_mono ] and [ fig : sed_power ] .",
    "we can see that for the power - law injection scenario with a large value of @xmath14 , the ics emission may exceed the electron background for energies higher than several tev ( the left panel of fig . [",
    "fig : sed_power ] ) .",
    "however , in general the electron background is much higher than the expected @xmath0-ray signal .",
    "therefore , the spatial morphology may be necessary to subtract the electron background .    fig .",
    "[ fig : skymap ] shows the morphology of the ics ( top panels ) and bremsstrahlung ( bottom panels ) emission , for the power - law injection scenario . from left to right we show the results at @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 gev , respectively .",
    "the ics emission is almost symmetric around the gc , and shows a decrease beyond @xmath42 .",
    "the morphology becomes more concentrated with the increase of energy , which is expected due to the more significant cooling of higher energy @xmath1 .",
    "the morphological study of the fermi - lat @xmath0-ray excess shows that the signal is pretty symmetric with the axis ratio departing from unity less than @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "however , the current fermi - lat data may not be able to exclude a slightly asymmetric morphology .",
    "the cta , on the other hand , may determine more precisely the morphology of this signal if the flux is high .",
    "we should keep in mind that there are more complexities about the very detailed morphology of the ics emission , caused by the particle diffusion and the distribution of the background radiation field .",
    "the bremsstrahlung emission is strongly correlated with the gas distribution , and is more concentrated in the galactic plane .",
    "it may be contaminated by the diffuse @xmath0-ray background from the galactic crs . as we have seen before",
    ", the ics emission will generally dominate the bremsstrahlung one .",
    "therefore , the nearly symmetric ics component of the vhe emission is an important expectation of the msp model to explain the fermi - lat gc excess .",
    "the morphology of the ics emission will be crucial to eliminate the electron background .",
    "gev range .",
    "other parameters are the same as fig .",
    "[ fig : skymap ] .",
    "the solid ( black ) lines are the contours with flux levels 0.8 , 0.6 , 0.4 and 0.2 of the peak value ( inetgrated within @xmath44 ) from inside to outside , as shown in the fermi - lat data of the gev @xmath0-ray excess @xcite . ]    as a comparison , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : sky1 - 10 ] the skymap of the ics emission integrated in @xmath45 gev range , and the contours of the observed fermi - lat gev @xmath0-ray excess .",

    "[ fig : skymap ] , and the flux levels of the contours of fermi - lat data are 0.8 , 0.6 , 0.4 and 0.2 from inside to outside .",
    "the result does show that the direct emission from the msps is much more concentrated than the ics emission .     of the msps .",
    "the second setting of propagation parameters in table [ table : prop ] is adopted . here",
    "@xmath34 is assumed , and for the monochromatic injection scenario we adopt @xmath33 gev . the hess observation of the diffuse emission from the gc ridge is also plotted @xcite . ]",

    "[ fig : surface ] .",
    "the propagation parameters are the second ones in table [ table : prop ] .",
    "we adopt the efficiency @xmath34 for both the monochromatic and the power - law injection scenarios , and @xmath33 gev for the monochromatic injection scenario .",
    "the surface brightness decreases with the increase of @xmath3 , angle away from the gc .",
    "the rough behavior beyond @xmath46 is @xmath47 , which is shallower than that of the fermi - lat excess .",
    "it is mainly due to the diffusion of the @xmath1 . the hess observation of the gc ridge emission , calculated from the fitting spectrum @xmath48",
    "tev@xmath18@xmath49s@xmath18sr@xmath18 @xcite , is shown by the short - dashed line .",
    "the ics emission seems to be fainter than the ridge emission .",
    "since the sensitivity of cta will be better by order of magnitude than hess , it is possible for cta to identify such a vhe @xmath0-ray component .",
    "the recent discovery of the gev @xmath0-ray excess from the gc in fermi - lat data has triggered extensive discussions of the dm origin or astrophysical origins such as msps .",
    "it is very essential to investigate the possible effects for future observations which may test different models . for the msp scenario ,",
    "it is expected that the wind @xmath1 , with very high lorentz factor ( @xmath50 ) , will carry most of the pulsar spin - down energy , and may diffuse and radiate in the vicinity of the gc . the ics and bremsstrahlung emission from those wind @xmath1 may be detectable by the vhe @xmath0-ray experiments such as cta .",
    "we find that there could be a bright vhe component from the wind @xmath1 , mainly from the ics off the interstellar radiation field , for a variety of model parameters .",
    "this ics emission is nearly spherically symmetric within several degrees of the gc .",
    "the spectrum depends on the assumption of the @xmath1 injection , and can likely extend to higher than @xmath51 gev for reasonable model parameters .",
    "the ics emission has larger total flux than the galactic ridge emission observed by hess @xcite , although the former is more extended than the latter , and may be detectable with cta .",
    "the detection of a vhe counterpart of the gev @xmath0-ray excess will provide a strong support of the msp ( or other similar astrophysical ) scenario to explain the gev @xmath0-ray excess compared with the dm annihilation scenario .",
    "the detailed detectability of the vhe source with cta relies on the detector performance and background rejection technique for extended source analysis .",
    "these are interesting future works . through a rough comparison with the hess data of the gc ridge and the improvement of the sensitivity of cta compared with hess",
    ", it should be promising for cta to detect such vhe emission .",
    "we should note that the globular clusters , which are thought to be rich of msps , have been shown to be a class of @xmath0-ray sources by fermi - lat .",
    "similar to the scenario discussed in this work , the vhe @xmath0-ray emission from the ics of the wind @xmath1 is expected from the globular clusters @xcite .",
    "hess has discovered the vhe @xmath0-ray emission from the direction of globular cluster terzan 5 , and set an upper limit for 47 tucanae .",
    "the detectability of globular clusters with cta has been investigated in detail in @xcite .",
    "here we just check the consistency of the model prediction with the current observations .",
    "we take the power - law model as an illustration since the threshold energies of the hess observations are relatively high ( a few hundred gev ) .",
    "furthermore we adopt @xmath34 to give a maximum estimate . assuming the ratio between the ics component and the direct emission from msps for the globular clusters is the same as the gc excess discussed in this work , we find that the predicted vhe @xmath0-ray flux is @xmath52 @xmath49s@xmath18 for terzan 5 , and @xmath53 @xmath49s@xmath18 for 47 tucanae , based on the fermi - lat fluxes . as a comparison ,",
    "the hess observations give @xmath54 @xmath49s@xmath18 for terzan 5 , and @xmath55 @xmath49s@xmath18 for 47 tucanae .",
    "the expectation of the vhe flux for terzan 5 seems to be larger by a factor of @xmath56 than the hess observation .",
    "it may indicate that @xmath14 should not be as high as @xmath57 .",
    "however , we note that there are other uncertainties which also affect the prediction of the vhe fluxes , such as the magnetic field inside the clusters , the injection spectrum and diffusion of electrons @xcite .",
    "another counterpart to the gev @xmath0-ray excess is obviously the radio msps .",
