    "the discovery @xcite of the instability of @xmath0-modes in rotating neutron stars by the emission of gravitational waves via the chandrasekhar - friedman - schutz ( cfs ) mechanism @xcite found much interest among astrophysicists . that instability might be responsible for slowing down a rapidly rotating , newly - born neutron star to rotation rates comparable to the initial period of the crab pulsar ( @xmath119 ms ) through the emission of current - quadrupole gravitational waves and",
    "would explain why only slowly - rotating pulsars are associated with supernova remnants @xcite .",
    "also , while an initially rapidly rotating star spins down , an energy equivalent to roughly 1% of a solar mass would be radiated in the form of gravitational waves , making the process an interesting source of detectable gravitational waves @xcite .",
    "it was soon realized in a large number of studies that many effects work against the growth of the r - mode like viscous damping , coupling to a crust , magnetic fields , differential rotation and exotic structure in the core of the neutron star .",
    "those effects could lead to a significant reduction of the impact of the instability or even to its complete suppression .",
    "for an account of those studies we refer to the recent reviews @xcite .",
    "most of the results have been obtained using a newtonian description of the fluid and including radiation reaction effects by the standard multipole formula .",
    "of course , such an ad hoc method can not substitute a fully general relativistic treatment of the system , but it was believed that it gives at least roughly correct results , both , qualitatively and quantitatively .",
    "however in a first step towards such a fully relativistic treatment it was shown in @xcite that the method misses important relativistic effects .",
    "working in the low - frequency approximation kojima could show that the frame dragging leads to the occurrence of a continuous part in the spectrum of the oscillations .",
    "this is qualitatively different from the newtonian case where this spectrum is ` discrete . '",
    "mathematically , kojima s arguments were not conclusive since drawn from an analogy to the equations occurring in the stability discussion of non - relativistic rotating ideal fluids @xcite and because his mathematical reasoning still referred to ` eigenvalues ' ( which generally do nt exist in that case ) rather than to values from a continuous part of a ` spectrum ' .",
    "but soon afterwards in @xcite k. kokkotas and myself provided a rigorous interpretation along with a proof of kojima s claim .",
    "indications for the continuous spectrum were also found in the subsequent numerical investigation @xcite .",
    "after that still the possibility remained that the result was an artefact of the used low - frequency approximation which in particular neglects gravitational radiation although numerical results in @xcite suggested that this is not the case . also is kojima s ` master equation ' ( see ( [ kojimasequation ] ) ) time independent whereas mathematically it is preferable to start from a time dependent equation , because in this way it can be build on the known connection between the spectrum of the generator of time evolution and the stability of the system @xcite . for these reasons we consider here kojima s full equations for r - modes which include gravitational radiation _ but still neglect the coupling to the polar modes_. indeed we will meet some surprises , related to the following . due to lack of appropriate exact background solutions of einstein s field equations the background model and its perturbation are expanded simultaneously into powers of the angular velocity @xmath2 of the uniformly rotating star . in particular kojima s equations",
    "are correct only to first order in @xmath2 .",
    "of course , once the evolution equations of the perturbations are given , there is no room for neglecting any second nor higher order terms occuring in further computations .",
    "the spectrum of the oscillations is determined by those equations and depending on that the system is stable or unstable .",
    "now in the calculation it turns out that second order corrections in the coefficients of the evolution equations can _ qualitatively _ influence the spectrum of the oscillations .",
    "in particular continuous parts in the spectrum ( both , stable and unstable ) can come and go depending on such corrections .",
    "as a consequence different descriptions of the star which are equivalent to first order could lead to different results with respect to its stability .",
    "hence the decision on the stability would have to take into account such corrections which in turn would lead to considering a changed operator .",
    "in addition judging from the mathematical mechanism how this can happen it does not seem likely that this property of the equations is going to change in higher orders , which would ultimately question the expansion method as a proper means to investigate the stability of a rotating relativistic star .",
    "with respect to this point further study is necessary , but still the results shed some doubts on the appropriateness of the expansion method .",
    "continuous spectra have been found in many cases in the past in the study of differentially rotating fluids .",
    "the continuous spectrum in these cases was again seen for @xmath0-modes together with many interesting features such as : the passage of low - order @xmath0-modes from the discrete part into the continuous part as the differential rotation increases ; and the presence of low order discrete @xmath3-modes in the middle of the continuous part in the more rapidly rotating disks @xcite .",
    "mathematically , the study of spectra containing continuous parts requires a higher level of mathematical sophistication than usual in astrophysics .",
    "such parts can cause instabilities and they can not be computed by straighforward mode calculations .",
    "their occurrence makes it necessary to differentiate between ` eigenvalues ' ( and the corresponding ` modes ' ) and the ` spectrum ' of the oscillations .",
    "the last depends on the introduction of a function space , a topology and the domain of definition of a linear operator ( namely the generator of time evolution ) analogous to quantum theory and for this the use of subtle mathematics from functional analysis , operator theory and in particular ` semigroups of linear operators ' is essential . ) for the low - frequency approximation @xcite . ]",
    "since the calculations here are based on the equations of kojima @xcite which are presented in detail there , here we are going only briefly to describe the perturbation equations .",
    "the star is assumed to be uniformly rotating with angular velocity @xmath4 where @xmath5 is small compared to unity .",
    "is usually very small and the fastest spinning known pulsar has @xmath6 . ] here @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the mass and the radius of the star .",
    "note that we use here and throughout the paper geometrical units @xmath9 .",
    "the background metric is given by : @xmath10 where @xmath11 describes the dragging of the inertial frame .",
    "if we include the effects of rotation only to order @xmath12 the fluid is still spherical , because the deformation is of order @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the star is described by the standard tolman - oppenheimer - volkov ( tov ) equations ( cf chapter 23.5 @xcite ) plus an equation for @xmath14 @xmath15 where we have defined @xmath16 a prime denotes derivative with respect to @xmath0 , and @xmath17 in the vacuum outside the star @xmath18 can be written @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the angular momentum of the star .",
    "the function @xmath18 , both inside and outside the star is a function of @xmath0 only and continuity of @xmath18 at the boundary ( surface of the star , @xmath21 ) requires that @xmath22 .",
    "additionally , @xmath18 is monotonically increasing function of @xmath0 limited to @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the value at the center .",
    "the basic variables for describing r - modes propagating on the background metric @xmath25 are the functions @xmath26 ( @xmath27 spherical coordinates , @xmath28 time coordinate ) defined by expansion into spherical harmonics ( imposing the regge - wheeler gauge ) @xmath29 and the fluid perturbation @xmath30 . here",
    "@xmath31 where @xmath32 is the ` small ' perturbation.the dependance of the basic variables on @xmath33 will be suppressed in the following .",
    "the evolution / constraint equation will be written in terms of the following vector - valued variable @xmath34 then kojima s equations for pure r - modes ( _ neglecting coupling to polar modes _ ) of a slowly and uniformly rotating general relativistic star take the following form ( @xmath35 ) : @xmath36    @xmath37h_1               + e^{\\nu -\\lambda } h_1 ' \\nonumber \\\\            & & - { im\\over \\lambda }      \\left[\\lambda \\omega - 2 e^{-\\lambda}r \\omega '        -\\varpi\\left ( 2kr^2(\\rho+p)+{4m\\over r}-\\lambda \\right)\\right]h_0        \\\\   & & + { i m \\over \\lambda}\\varpi e^{-\\lambda}r\\left(rz ' -2h_0'\\right )            -{im\\over \\lambda }       \\left [ \\omega'e^{-\\lambda}r^2          + \\varpi\\left ( kr^3(\\rho+p)-2re^{-\\lambda}\\right)\\right ] z           \\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath38 h_1           + { 2\\over r}e^{\\nu -\\lambda } h_1'\\nonumber \\\\      & & + 2{im\\over \\lambda } r\\varpi e^{-\\lambda}z '       + { i m \\over \\lambda } \\left(\\lambda \\omega - 4e^{-\\lambda}\\varpi\\right)h_0 '       \\nonumber \\\\       & & + 2{im\\over \\lambda}\\left [ \\left(2e^{-\\lambda}-kr^2(\\rho+p)\\right)\\varpi       -\\lambda \\omega - e^{-\\lambda } r \\omega ' \\right]z      \\nonumber \\\\      & & + 2{im\\over \\lambda } \\left [ ( 1 + 2e^{-\\lambda})\\omega ' +      \\left(2kr^3(\\rho+p)-\\lambda r + 4 m \\right){\\varpi \\over r^2 } \\right]h_0   \\ , \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath39 , @xmath40 , or in a more compact notation @xmath41 in addition we have : @xmath42 z -4 r e^{\\lambda + \\nu}u \\nonumber \\\\       & + & { e^{\\lambda}\\over r^2}\\left[4m-\\lambda r",

    "in a first step we deal with the evolution equations only . to formulate a well posed initial value problem for the system ( [ evol ] ) data will be taken from the hilbert space @xmath54 where @xmath55 is defined by ( [ j ] ) .",

    "the use of this formulation makes possible the application of the results in the field of ` semigroups of linear operators ' . in order that ( [ evolabs ] ) has a unique solution for data from the domain of @xmath61 it has to be proven that @xmath61 is the generator of strongly continuous semigroup ( or group ) . that this is not just a technicality is already indicated by the fact that the system ( [ evol ] ) can be seen to have _ complex characteristics _ if the equation @xmath63 is violated .",
    "hence in those cases it can not be expected that @xmath61 is such a generator .",
    "for this reason ( [ restriction ] ) is assumed to hold for now on .",
    "note that since @xmath64 and because of @xmath65 and @xmath66 that there is a large range of values for the physical parameters where inequality ( [ restriction ] ) is satisfied .",
    "but note also that we meet here for the first time a quantity of the order @xmath67 which restricts the meaningfullness of ( [ evol ] ) which itself is correct only to the order @xmath46 .",

    "for instance , if that spectrum contains values from the left half - plane of the complex plane then there are solutions of ( [ evolabs ] ) which are exponentially growing .",
    "_ now the whole process of proving that @xmath61 is such a generator would be greatly simplified by the usual perturbation methods if @xmath59 could be split into a symmetric differential operator and into a ` small ' perturbation .",
    "this was tried on a diagonalized form of the evolution equations ( [ evol ] ) , but unsuccessfully .",
    "indeed the problem there occurred in proving the ` smallness ' of the the perturbing operator .",
    "a further problem in that case was that assumptions of usually used theorems giving the asymptotics of solutions near @xmath70 which are needed for the construction of the resolvent of the operator turned out to be not satisfied .",
    "for these reasons that approach was not pursued any further .",
    "_ usually , after the proof that an operator is the generator of a strongly continuous semigroup the far more difficult problem occurs in finding physically interesting properties of its spectrum and here it might be thought on first sight that this is analytically impossible , because of the complicated nature of the evolution equations ( [ evol ] ) .",
    "but fortunately in @xcite there was found a whole class of operators which generally have a continuous part in their spectrum and where the occurrence of that part can be concluded from the _ structure _ of the resolvent . indeed in the next section the _ same structure",
    "_ will be found in the resolvent of @xmath61 .",
    "in a first step we try to invert the equations @xmath71 for @xmath72 for any complex number @xmath73 ( @xmath74 in kojima s notation ) and any continuous function @xmath75 assuming values in @xmath76 and with _ compact support _ on the half line .",
    "any @xmath73 for which there is some @xmath77 such that ( [ spec ] ) has not a unique solution is a spectral value .",

    ".,scaledwidth=62.0% ]    the asymptotics near @xmath70 of @xmath157 for @xmath73 near and on the imaginary axis is surprising .",
    "expected was that in the complement of imaginary axis there are always , both , a stable and an unstable solution of ( [ equation ] ) and on the imaginary axis that both solutions are purely imaginary .",
    "indeed this would have been the case if the second order term in this equation were absent .",
    "there one has either exponential growth of both solutions ( in regions d ) or exponential decay of both solutions ( region b ) . as a consequence each @xmath158",
    " different from the values given in ( [ exceptions ] )  is an _ eigenvalue _ of @xmath59 .",
    "hence there is a _ continuum of eigenvalues _ for @xmath59 in the open left half - plane and hence the evolution given by ( [ evolh1 ] ) , ( [ evolh0a ] ) and ( [ evolza ] ) is _",
    "in the previous section it was found that the spectrum of @xmath61 contains a _ continuum of unstable eigenvalues _ leading to an unstable evolution given by ( [ evolh1 ] ) , ( [ evolh0a ] ) and ( [ evolza ] ) .",
    "in addition there was found a continuum of values @xmath73 ( from regions d in fig.1  which include the spectral values found in the low - frequency approximation as well as ( [ kojimaspec ] )  for which any non trivial solution of the homogeneous equation corresponding to ( [ spec ] ) growths exponentially near @xmath70 .",
    "hence it is to expect that those values are also part of the spectrum of @xmath61 and hence contribute to the instability .",
    "note in particular that their associated growth times displayed in fig.1 can be of larger size than those for the found unstable eigenvalues ( region b in fig.1 ) which suggests that the influence on the evolution dominantes over the influence of those eigenvalues .",
    "a further question is how the constraint ( [ constr ] )  which has not been treated so far  is likely to influence the spectrum .",
    "the constraint should lead to closed subspace of @xmath60 being invariant under @xmath61 .",
    "then the spectrum of the restriction of @xmath61 to that subspace is a subset of the spectrum of @xmath61 .",
    "this should have the effect that the eigenvalues in region @xmath159 ( see fig.1 ) are becoming discrete instead whereas the continuous part of the spectrum in region @xmath160 might be left unchanged , because in general continuous spectra are less sensitive to such a operation . in any case",
    "the singular structure of the resolvent at the values given by ( [ kojimaspec ] ) will be unchanged having the effect that those values remain part of the spectrum at least when the system is restricted to finite space as is necessarily done in most numerical investigations . to decide these questions further study is needed .",
    "note in this connection that the occurrence of an unbounded spectrum for @xmath61 would not be a surprise , because for e.g. , it is known that a self - adjoint operator has a bounded spectrum if and only if it is defined on the whole hilbert space and in general differential operators can not be defined on the whole of a weighted @xmath161-space .",
    "also would the occurrence of an infinitely extended continuous part in the spectrum of oscillations be not surprising since that is quite common for infinitely extended physical systems . from a physical point of view",
    "the main worrying feature of the results is their qualitative dependance on _ second order terms _ like that in ( [ equation ] ) .",
    "it is to expect that changes in second order to the coefficents in ( [ evolh1 ] ) , ( [ evolh0a ] ) and ( [ evolza ] ) influence that term which can lead to a qualitative change of the spectrum . as a consequence different descriptions of the star which are equivalent to first order could lead to different statements on the stability of the star .",
    "hence to decide that stability such corrections of the coefficients would have to be taken into account which in turn would lead to considering a changed operator .",
    "in addition judging from the mathematical mechanism how the coefficients of the evolution equations influence the spectrum ",
    "namely through the asymptotics of the homogeneous solutions of ( [ spec ] ) near @xmath70  it might be suspected that this property of the equations does not change in higher orders , which would ultimately question the expansion method as a proper means to investigate the stability of a rotating relativistic star . also with respect to these points",
    "further study is necessary , but still the results raise first doubts whether the slow rotation approximation is appropriate for this purpose .",
    "a final interesting question to ask is whether a numerical investigation of the evolution given by ( [ evolh1 ] ) , ( [ evolh0a ] ) and ( [ evolza ] ) is capable of detecting the computed instabilities .",
    "this seems unlikely , because in that process space has to be ` cutoff ' near the singular points @xmath162 and suitable local boundary conditions have to be posed at that the endpoints .",
    "but such a system is qualitatively different from the infinite system since for instance there the asymptotics of the homogeneous solutions ( [ spec ] ) near @xmath70 does not play a role .",
    "note that  independent from the used boundary conditions  for such a system the continuum of values given by the restriction of ( [ kojimaspec ] ) to the chosen interval _ are part of the spectrum _ ) - ( [ h1i ] ) .",
