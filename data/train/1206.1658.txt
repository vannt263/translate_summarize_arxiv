    "the relationship between anomalous charge transport and magnetism in the vicinity of metal - insulator transition is a longstanding subject in the physics of strongly correlated electron systems .",
    "the ru - based metal caruo@xmath2 is considered to have a paramagnetic ground state with itinerant characteristics of ru 4d electrons @xcite . in caruo@xmath2",
    ", magnetization is found to be significantly enhanced at low temperatures @xcite , while no long - range magnetic order is observed in microscopic measurements such as neutron scattering and nmr @xcite .",
    "in addition , electrical resistivity @xmath12 shows an unusually large magnitude at high temperatures , corresponding to a very small mean - free pass of electron conduction comparable to lattice constants @xcite .",
    "these features imply that caruo@xmath2 involves instabilities for both magnetism and charge transport , which are enhanced by strong electronic correlation between itinerant ru 4d electrons .    in the mixed compound caru@xmath0mn@xmath1o@xmath2 @xcite",
    ", it is revealed that a ferromagnetic ( fm ) order evolves above @xmath3 , and becomes stable in the intermediate @xmath7 range .",
    "both spontaneous magnetization @xmath13 and curie temperature @xmath14 show maximum values at @xmath15 ( @xmath16 and @xmath17 ) , followed by the reductions of them with further increasing @xmath7 .",
    "furthermore , an antiferromagnetic ( afm ) spin arrangement with the g - type structure is observed in the fm ordered phase .",
    "finally , at @xmath18 the fm order vanishes , and only the g - type afm order appears below @xmath19 @xcite . by doping mn , the feature of @xmath12 also changes from metallic to less conductive above @xmath20 , but the magnitude of @xmath12 still remains in small values in the wide @xmath7 range , that is , smaller than @xmath21 cm even at low temperatures for @xmath22 . at @xmath18 , in contrast , @xmath12 dramatically increases with decreasing temperature , whose magnitude at low temperatures exceeds @xmath23 @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "these properties indicate that doping mn into caruo@xmath2 modifies the itinerant electronic states due to strong correlations between ru 4d and mn 3d electrons , and it significantly affects the magnetic and transport properties . to clarify the variation of the d electronic states",
    ", we have performed the low - temperature specific - heat measurements for caru@xmath0mn@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "polycrystalline samples of caru@xmath0mn@xmath1o@xmath2 for @xmath25 were prepared by means of the conventional solid - state method . the mixture of appropriate amounts of caco@xmath2 , ruo@xmath26 and mno were first calcined at 800 @xmath27c for 24 hours .",
    "they were shaped into pellets after careful mixing , and then sintered at 1200 @xmath27c for 48 hours . by means of powder x - ray diffraction technique",
    "we checked that all the samples have a distorted perovskite structure ( the gafeo@xmath2-type orthorhombic structure ) @xcite without any extrinsic phase .",
    "specific heat @xmath28 was measured between 3 k and 275 k with a thermal - relaxation method using both a commercial system ( ppms : quantum design ) and a hand - made equipment , where we used plate - shaped samples with the mass of about 4 mg and 40 mg , respectively .",
    "the thermal - relaxation curves for all the measurements were well definitive , and the @xmath28 data obtained from both equipments were consistent within the experimental accuracy .",
    "ac - susceptibility was measured in the temperature range of 5 - 300 k to estimate the fm and afm transition temperatures .",
    "frequency and amplitude of the applied ac field were 180 hz and @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "mn@xmath1o@xmath2 . in ( a ) , closed and open arrows indicate the onsets of fm and afm orders , respectively , estimated from the peak position of the ac susceptibility .",
    "the types of magnetic order are determined from the previous reports on magnetization and neutron scattering measurements @xcite .",
    "the inset of ( a ) shows an enlargement of @xmath28 around the afm transition temperatures for @xmath30 and 1 . ,",
    "scaledwidth=75.0% ]    figure 1(a ) shows temperature variations of the specific heat @xmath31 for caru@xmath0mn@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "clear jumps ascribed to the afm transition are observed at 122.7 k for @xmath18 and 125.1 k for @xmath30 ( see inset of fig .",
    "1(a ) ) , but no distinct anomaly is seen in the @xmath31 curves for @xmath22 .",
    "this contrasts with temperature dependence of the real part of ac susceptibility @xmath32 for @xmath33 , where the fm and afm transitions are indicated by the appearance of peaks ( fig .",
    "the transition temperatures estimated from @xmath32 are consistent with those determined by the dc magnetization and neutron scattering measurements @xcite .",
    "the peaks seen in @xmath32 are somewhat broaden probably due to the distribution of the transition temperatures in the sample generated by doping .",
    "we consider this effect to be one of the reasons for the reduction of jumps in @xmath31 . on the other hand ,",
    "it is interesting that similar reduction of anomaly is observed in the @xmath31 data for mn - doped srruo@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "srruo@xmath2 is a ferromagnet with itinerant characteristics of ru 4d electrons , and @xmath31 exhibits a jump at @xmath34 . in the mixed compound srru@xmath0mn@xmath1o@xmath2 , the anomaly at @xmath14 in @xmath31 is rapidly suppressed in the fm metallic phase for @xmath35 , but a shoulder - like anomaly again appears in @xmath31 at the afm transition temperatures in the strongly insulating region for @xmath36 . as for caru@xmath0mn@xmath1o@xmath2 ,",
    "the electrical resistivity is much reduced for @xmath22 .",
    "the disappearance of anomaly in @xmath31 may thus be related to the small entropy change associated with the magnetic transitions in the small - resistivity region , as well as the broadening of the onset due to the inhomogeneity .    ,",

    "the solid lines in ( c ) are guides to the eye @xcite . , scaledwidth=75.0% ]    displayed in fig .",
    "2(a ) is low - temperature specific heat divided by temperature @xmath4 plotted as a function of @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath4 for entire @xmath7 range are roughly proportional to @xmath5 .",
    "the finite @xmath4 values for @xmath39 except at @xmath18 indicate that the fermi - liquid excitation as well as phonon are mainly responsible for @xmath31 .",
    "however , @xmath4 in the small and intermediate @xmath7 range shows a very weak deviation from the @xmath5 function with a downward curvature below @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) . it may be ascribed to the spin fluctuation generated in the magnetically ordered phase .",
    "the @xmath4 data are fitted with a function of @xmath42 to derive the electronic specific heat coefficient @xmath6 . in fig .",
    "2(b ) , we show @xmath7 variations of @xmath6 and @xmath37 obtained from the best fit in the temperature range between 3 k and 10 k. for comparison , we also plot the @xmath43 phase diagram obtained from the @xmath32 data in fig .",
    "2(c ) . the @xmath6 value for @xmath8 is estimated to be 84 mj / k@xmath9 mol , which is consistent with that reported previously @xcite .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath6 does not change in the paramagnetic phase for @xmath10 , but linearly decreases with increasing @xmath7 in the magnetically ordered region ( @xmath44 ) . it is highly reduced and becomes @xmath45 or less for @xmath46 , where @xmath14 decreases through the maximum at @xmath15 . on the other hand , @xmath37 is estimated to be 0.19 mj / k@xmath47 mol for @xmath8 that yields the debye temperature of @xmath48 .",
    "it is reduced in mn - rich region and finally becomes 0.085 mj / k@xmath47 mol ( @xmath49 ) at @xmath18 .",
    "this feature seems to be consistent with the volume contraction in mn - rich concentrations found by x - ray diffraction measurements @xcite .    in caru@xmath0mn@xmath1o@xmath2",
    ", it is proposed that a double - exchange mechanism between mn ions plays a crucial role in the evolution of the fm order in mn - rich region , and in lower @xmath7 range an interplay of double - exchange and superexchange interactions between d electrons located at ru and mn ions may yield the formation of inhomogeneous fm and afm orders @xcite . on the other hand , the present @xmath28 investigation revealed that @xmath6 shows relatively large values in small and intermediate @xmath7 ranges , while it is strongly reduced in mn - rich region .",
    "in particular , @xmath6 at @xmath50 is estimated to be 38 mj / k@xmath9 mol , which is almost the same magnitude as that for the ferromagnetic metal srruo@xmath2 ( 33 mj / k@xmath9 mol ) .",
    "the large @xmath6 values indicate that d electrons have itinerant characteristics in this @xmath7 range .",
    "furthermore , we observed that @xmath6 is nearly constant in the paramagnetic region , and it is then reduced when the fm order occurs above @xmath3 .",
    "such a variation of @xmath6 can not be simply attributed to an increase in the fraction of d electrons localized at mn ions in the sample , but strongly suggests that the itinerant d electrons originating from both ru and mn are tightly coupled with the magnetic orders .",
    "this is supported by our recent magnetization and neutron - diffraction measurements for @xmath50 , where the magnetization shows typical features on fluctuation expected from itinerant electron spins , and the neutron - diffraction experiments revealed the occurrence of the long - range magnetic orders @xcite .",
    "we performed @xmath28 measurements for caru@xmath0mn@xmath1o@xmath2 ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "low - temperature @xmath6 value is estimated to be 84 mj / k@xmath9 mol for pure caruo@xmath2 , and it is unchanged by doping mn in the paramagnetic region for @xmath10 . in the magnetically ordered phase , @xmath6 is linearly reduced with increasing @xmath7 for @xmath51 , and then approaches @xmath52 mj / k@xmath9 mol or less for @xmath53 .",
    "the relatively large magnitude of @xmath6 in the small and intermediate mn concentrations suggests that d electrons have itinerant characteristics contrary to localized ones expected in mn - rich concentrations , and they play important roles in the magnetic orderings .",
