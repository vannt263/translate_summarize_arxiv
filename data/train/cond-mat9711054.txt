    "in the previous paper @xcite , we reformulate the balance equation theory of lei and ting @xcite in _ ab initio _ manner . in this study , we neither distinguish the degree of freedom of the center of mass from the relative degree of freedom of the electrons nor adopt the effective hamiltonian .",
    "all our calculations are carried out in the laboratory coordinate system and based on the original hamiltonian ( _ i.e. _ ( 12 ) to ( 21 ) of @xcite ) .",
    "we show that the @xmath0-matrix is , in fact , also a functional of @xmath1 , the electrostatic potential of the electrons .",
    "this feature is missing in the lei - ting formulation .",
    "it implies that the expressions of the frictional forces and the energy transfer rate all depend explicitly on the electric field . in the second paper @xcite",
    ", this electric field dependence is studied perturbatively .",
    "to first order in the electric field , the results are given by ( 45 ) , ( 65 ) , ( 68 ) and ( 69 ) of @xcite .    by choosing a new initial state : both the electron gas and the phonon gas resting in the laboratory coordinate system , we revise and extend in the present paper the first order perturbation calculation given in paper @xcite to high order in the electric field . if without a specific statement , we use in this paper the same notations as those in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we recall that in the papers @xcite and @xcite , we follow the current hot - electron transport theory @xcite to assume that at time @xmath2 the system is composed of two independent equilibrium subsystems : a drifting electron gas with temperature @xmath3 and a phonon gas with temperature @xmath4 .",
    "the corresponding initial density matrix is @xmath5 with @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "it is pointed out in the appendix that in order to keep the consistency of the theory , one should abandon such initial state from beginning and adopt instead the initial state : both the electron gas and the phonon gas resting in the laboratory coordinate system . and so the initial density matrix ( [ d - old ] ) should be replaced by @xmath8 with @xmath9 . keeping this modification in mind ,",
    "we revise the formulae of @xcite , and calculate further the high order feynman diagrams .    in steady state ,",
    "the balance equations are given by ( 1 ) to ( 5 ) of @xcite .",
    "as said above , the density matrix @xmath10 in these equations should be replaced by the new one @xmath11 . taking ( 67 ) of @xcite into account ,",
    "we rewrite these equations as follows @xmath12 where @xmath13 here @xmath14 denotes the statistical average over the density matrix @xmath11 , _ i.e. _ @xmath15 in ( [ eb ] ) , @xmath16 only denotes the drift velocity in the final steady state .    as shown in @xcite , the frictional forces ( [ feis ] ) and",

    "for example , the frictional force due to impurity scattering , @xmath19 , is given by ( 22 ) of @xcite , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath20 the green function @xmath21 is calculated by the keldysh diagrammatic technique .",

    "@xmath28 it is easy to see that this revision is the direct consequence of replacing the initial density matrix @xmath10 by the new one @xmath11 . repeating the calculation expounded in @xcite , the revised version of ( 28 ) , ( 40 ) and ( 41 ) of @xcite are easily obtained . for convenience of latter discussion ,",

    "we further note that for the special parabolic energy band , the distinction between @xmath50 and @xmath51 can be neglected for @xmath52 . as a result ,",
    "the energy transfer rate due to impurity scattering , @xmath47 , is equal to zero and ( [ fei - last ] ) , ( [ fep - last ] ) to ( [ wep - last ] ) are identical to those of lei and ting @xcite if the concrete expression for the distribution function is not concerned .",
    "in the final steady state , the distribution function of the electron gas in a uniform electric field is given by ( [ newf ] ) .",

    "the origin of this inconsistency is due to the incorrectness of ignoring the renormalization of the electric field vertex in deriving these equations .",
    "now , let the bare electric field vertex ( ) in fig .",
    "1b and c of @xcite be replaced by the renormalized one ( @xmath60 ) shown in fig",
    "we can show that to first order in electric field , bepp is unchanged , but ( [ 1st ] ) is modified by replacing @xmath61 by a function @xmath62 , _ i.e. _ @xmath63 for the electron - impurity scattering , @xmath62 is just @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "then , the consistency between the expression of @xmath64 and bepp is recovered .",
    "inspired by this success , we replace the bare electric field vertex in each of the feynman diagram for @xmath21 by the renormalized one .",
    "we have the same balance equations but a different expression for @xmath64 which is given by @xmath65 @xmath62 is defined by an integral equation @xcite .",

    "we instead follow the approach close to the current hot - electron transport theory @xcite to replace @xmath66 by a one , @xmath67 , and therefore write ( [ newf ] ) in the form @xmath68 the point of this alternate approach is to consider @xmath67 as an unknown parameter and determine it in the following fashion : combining ( [ last ] ) with bepp and the equations @xmath69 and solving them self - consistently to get @xmath67 , together with @xmath3 , @xmath70 and @xmath16 for given @xmath71 , @xmath4 and @xmath72 .",

    "one can prove from ( [ constr2 ] ) that @xmath67 is just @xmath16 only for the special parabolic energy band .",
    "it is remarkable that ( [ cf1 ] ) is nothing but a simplified form of the boltzmann equation .",
    "in fact , in the relaxation time approximation , the boltzmann equation of an electron gas in the presence of a uniform electric field is @xmath81 @xmath82 is the approximate @xmath73-independent relaxation time . in steady state ,",
    "we rewrite ( [ bol ] ) in the form @xmath84 it is just ( [ cf1 ] ) with @xmath85 .",
    "thus ( [ int_sol ] ) is a homogeneous steady solution of the equation in constant relaxation time approximation .",
    "we recall that in the of balance equation , the quantity @xmath67 in ( [ int_sol ] ) is considered as an unknown parameter and determined by solving the complete set of the equations : ( [ int_sol ] ) with bepp , ( [ constr1 ] ) and ( [ constr2 ] ) .",
    "this trick of not only provides a method to choose a proper value of the relaxation time for given @xmath4 and electric field @xmath72 , but also ensure ( [ int_sol ] ) consistent with bepp .",

    ", we calculate the nonlinear impurity - limited resistance of an electron gas using either the displaced fermi function ( [ flt ] ) or the new one ( [ int_sol ] ) . this problem has been studied by lei and ting @xcite based on the momentum balance equation and the distribution function ( [ flt ] ) .",
