    "the abbe diffraction limit was considered to be the fundamental limit for spatial resolution of an optical microscope for more than a hundred years . in the last decade",
    ", novel techniques have circumvented this limit in order to achieve super - resolution  @xcite .",
    "structured illumination microscopy ( sim )  @xcite , for example , uses illumination by multiple structured patterns to down - modulate high spatial frequency information of the object into the low - frequency region , which can then pass through the bandwidth of the microscope s optical transfer function ( otf ) and be captured by the sensor .",
    "the reconstruction algorithm for sim combines demodulation process which brings the high spatial frequency information back to its original position and synthetic aperture that extends the support of the effective otf .",
    "various structured patterns have been used to realize sim : periodic gratings  @xcite , a single focal spot ( confocal microscope )  @xcite , multifocal spots  @xcite and random speckles  @xcite . when the illumination patterns themselves are diffraction - limited , linear sim is restricted to @xmath1 the bandwidth of a widefield microscope  @xcite , allowing up to @xmath2 resolution enhancement ( metrics explained in sec .  [ sec : def_of_res ] ) .    in practice ,",
    "structured illumination systems are sensitive to aberrations and experimental errors . to avoid reconstruction artifacts that degrade resolution ,",
    "the patterns that are projected onto the sample must be known accurately .",
    "periodic grating patterns can be parameterized by their contrast , period and phase angle , which may be estimated in the post - processing  @xcite . for multifocal patterns",
    ", the location of each focal spot is required  @xcite . for random speckle patterns ,",
    "the relative shifts of the patterns are needed  @xcite .",
    "even with careful calibration and high - quality optics , distortions caused by the sample may degrade the result .    to alleviate some of the experimental challenges ,",
    "blind sim was proposed , enabling sim reconstruction without many priors  @xcite .",
    "the only assumption is that the sum of all illumination patterns is uniform .",
    "optimization - based algorithms have been adopted , including iterative least squares with positivity and equality constraints  @xcite , joint support recovery  @xcite and @xmath3 sparsity constraints  @xcite .",
    "however , these algorithms are sensitive to parameter tuning and may show low contrast in reconstructing high spatial frequencies  @xcite .",
    "another algorithm , speckle super - resolution optical fluctuation imaging ( s - sofi ) realizes sofi  @xcite by first projecting random speckle patterns onto the object , and then using the statistical properties of the speckle patterns as a prior to reconstruct a high - resolution image  @xcite .",
    "s - sofi is experimentally simple and robust ; however it only achieves a @xmath4 resolution enhancement instead of @xmath5 for conventional sim techniques ( as compared to a widefield microscope ) .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a new reconstruction algorithm for sim that is applicable to any illumination patterns .",
    "our method , termed pattern estimation structured illumination microscopy with a statistical prior ( pe - sims ) , is as robust and insensitive to parameter tuning as s - sofi , and achieves better resolution enhancement ( up to @xmath1 ) . like blind sim ,",
    "the patterns need not be known ( except for a requirement on the covariance of the patterns ) .",
    "we demonstrate our method using simulated and experimental results with both speckle and multifocal patterns .",
    "we discuss pattern design strategies to reduce the amount of data required and demonstrate an extension that uses pixel reassignment  @xcite to improve the reconstruction quality .",
    "our algorithm takes in a sim dataset consisting of multiple images captured under different structured illumination patterns ( e.g. random speckles , multifocal spots ) .",
    "we reconstruct the super - resolved image in two parts .",
    "the first part is an iterative optimization procedure for estimating each illumination pattern based on an approximated object .",
    "the second part reconstructs the high - resolution image using the estimated patterns and the measured images , along with a statistical prior . before introducing these two parts ,",
    "we start by defining the sim forward model .",
    "a representative experimental setup is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_exp_setup ] . a dmd spatial light modulator ( slm ) is used to project patterns onto the object through an objective lens .",
    "the measured intensity for the @xmath6-th captured image is the product of the object s fluorescence distribution @xmath7 with the illumination pattern @xmath8 , where @xmath9 denotes the lateral position coordinates .",
    "this product is then convolved with the system s incoherent point spread function ( psf ) on the detection side , @xmath10 : @xmath11 \\otimes h_{\\mathrm{det}}(\\mathbf{r } ) = \\iint o(\\mathbf{r } ' ) p_\\ell(\\mathbf{r } ' ) h_{\\mathrm{det}}(\\mathbf{r } - \\mathbf{r } ' ) \\,d^2\\mathbf{r } ' . \\label{eqn_measurement}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      the first part of our inverse algorithm is to estimate the illumination patterns .",
    "to do so , we start with an low - resolution approximation of the object",
    ". then , we use this object and our measured images to iteratively estimate the patterns ( see fig .  [ fig_ipe ] ) .",
    "if we already knew the object @xmath12 , it would be straightforward to estimate the pattern for each measured image by dividing out the object from each of the measurements .",
    "however , the object @xmath7 is unknown .",
    "hence , we start by making a rough estimate of the object .",
    "we first take the mean of all the measured images : @xmath13 \\otimes h_{\\mathrm{det}}(\\mathbf{r } ) \\approx p_0 o(\\mathbf{r } ) \\otimes h_{\\mathrm{det}}(\\mathbf{r } ) , \\label{eqn_wf_est}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the mean operation with respect to @xmath6 , and @xmath15 is approximately a constant over the entire field of view",
    ". the resulting image will be equivalent to the low - resolution widefield image if the sum of all illumination patterns is approximately uniform .",
    "since the widefield image represents the convolution of the object with its psf , we can perform a deconvolution operation to estimate the low - resolution object : @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 denote the fourier transform and its inverse , respectively , @xmath19 denotes the fourier transform of a certain function , @xmath20 are the lateral spatial frequency coordinates and @xmath21 is a small tikhonov regularization constant . note that this object estimate has diffraction - limited resolution and will be used only for estimating the illumination patterns .",
    "we then use the low - resolution object estimate @xmath22 to recover each of the illumination patterns . since each image is simply the product of the illumination and object",
    ", we could divide each image by the estimated object to get the pattern .",
    "however , we instead solve the problem as an optimization procedure in order to impose the correct fourier support constraint and avoid reconstruction artifacts .",

    "the first term of the cost function , @xmath25 , in eq .   is the least square error ( residual ) between the measured intensity and the predicted intensity based on our current estimate .",
    "the second term enforces a frequency support constraint for the illumination pattern via an indicator function @xmath26 .",
    "this is important to reduce artifacts in the pattern estimation because a normal division between the measured image and estimated object will create errors outside of this frequency support . in our epi - illumination geometry",
    ", the constraint is that the frequency content of each illumination pattern be confined within the otf defined by the objective s na .",
    "we implement a proximal gradient descent algorithm  @xcite , summarized in subroutine  [ algo_pattern ] .",

    ", the method is also known as a projected gradient method .    to implement",

    "we define the projection operation @xmath29 to force the information outside of the otf to be zero at each iteration . to reduce high - frequency artifacts ,",
    "the following soft - edge filter is used @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the system s psf on the illumination side , and @xmath32 determines the amount of high - frequency information that is suppressed in the pattern estimation step .",
    "we repeat this process of updates and projections until convergence ( typically @xmath3350 iterations to estimate each pattern ) .",
    "the convergence speed for proximal gradient descent is on the order of @xmath34  @xcite , indicating that the residual between the current and optimal cost functions is inversely proportional to the number of iterations @xmath35 .",
    "to accelerate convergence , one extra step is conducted in subroutine  [ algo_pattern ] to include the information of the previous estimate  @xcite .",
    "the convergence rate for this accelerated proximal gradient method , @xmath36  @xcite , is significantly faster than the normal proximal gradient method .",
    "[ algo_pattern ] initialize @xmath37 with all zero image @xmath38      once we have recovered the illumination patterns , the second part of the algorithm is to reconstruct a high - resolution image from the measured dataset @xmath39 and the estimated patterns @xmath8 .",
    "we call this part of the algorithm structured illumination microscopy with a statistical prior ( sims ) , summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig_sims ] .",
    "there are four steps , which are explained below .",
    "we will also describe how the statistical prior is used and why this procedure gives better resolution .",

    "the @xmath6-th image is thus the @xmath6-th sample function for these random variables ( one event out of the sample space ) .",
    "covariance is a measure of how much two random variables change together . since the intensity @xmath42 is the blurred version of the product between random patterns @xmath40 and deterministic object @xmath7 ( eq .  )",
    ", the covariance between the pattern and the intensity should give high similarity wherever the object @xmath7 has signal and thus allow us to find the object underneath the random - pattern illumination  @xcite .",
    "we calculate this covariance image @xmath43 as @xmath44 where @xmath45 , and @xmath46 .",
    "regardless of which illumination pattern is imposed , the covariance image always gives an estimate of the object .",
    "however , the resolution of the reconstructed object may be different for different pattern statistics .",
    "we can quantify this by taking a closer look at the expression on the right - hand side of eq .  .",
    "the covariance between @xmath40 and @xmath47 acts as the psf of the covariance image , which thus determines resolution . if the patterns are perfectly spatially correlated , the pattern - pattern covariance is a constant , and the pattern - intensity covariance image is a normal widefield image with psf of @xmath48 . if the patterns are perfectly spatially uncorrelated , the pattern - pattern covariance is @xmath49 , which , for a constant variance , results in the psf being a delta function and the object being reconstructed with perfect resolution . in practice",
    ", this is not achievable , since the illumination is bandlimited and thus can not be perfectly uncorrelated . in the general case , to find the resolution ( psf ) of the covariance image , we need to calculate the spatial covariance of the patterns , which is the subject of part 2b , below .      to calculate the spatial covariance of the projected patterns",
    ", we first consider the pattern formation model . in our experiments , for example , we use a dmd to create random patterns at the sample plane . assuming that the projected dmd pattern is sparse enough to avoid interference cross - terms",
    ", we can express our pattern under the incoherent model as @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the @xmath6-th pattern on the dmd . with this model ,",
    "the pattern - pattern covariance is @xmath52 where we have used an assumption that the dmd pattern values at position @xmath53 and @xmath54 are perfectly uncorrelated : @xmath55 with @xmath56 being a constant that maintains unit consistency .",
    "this assumption is valid because the effective dmd pixel size is small compared to the fwhm of the optical system and we can control @xmath57 to create an uncorrelated pattern . in the experiment ,",
    "each position of @xmath51 is an independent and identically distributed random variable .",
    "when the number of patterns is large enough , the variance @xmath58 approaches the same constant for all the positions .",
    "we can then combine @xmath56 and the variance into a single constant @xmath59 .",
    "ideally , we can assume @xmath60 when @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the wavelength of the fluorescent emission detection light , and theoretically calculate the pattern - pattern covariance .",
    "we can also estimate @xmath63 by numerically evaluating eq .   using our estimated patterns , which accounts for possible aberrations in the illumination optics .",
    "the pattern - pattern covariance derived in part 2b is related to the psf of the pattern - intensity covariance calculated in part 2a .",
    "hence , we can plug the pattern - pattern covariance into eq .   and write the covariance image as @xmath64(\\mathbf{r } - \\mathbf{r } ' ) d^2 \\mathbf{r } ' . \\label{eqn_ipe_sim_dmd}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    importantly , the effective psf for this correlation image is now @xmath65 ( \\mathbf{r})$ ] , and the corresponding effective otf is @xmath66(\\mathbf{u})$ ] .",
    "since both @xmath67 and @xmath68 have approximately the same fourier support as the widefield otf , the convolution between them covers around @xmath1 the support of the widefield otf , as in conventional sim .",

    "these can be seen in the deconvolved covariance image in fig .",
    "[ fig_sims ] . to resolve this",
    ", we can estimate and correct for the variance across the image using our previously estimated projected patterns . since the projected pattern @xmath8 is the blurred version of the pattern on the dmd , by ignoring the high - frequency component of the dmd pattern , we can approximate the variance of the dmd pattern by @xmath73 we divide out the spatially - varying variance @xmath59 in eq .   from the deconvolved sims image ,",
    "@xmath74 where @xmath75 is a regularizer and @xmath76 is the output from our sims reconstruction ( part 2c ) .",
    "this result of this step is our final reconstruction of the high - resolution object function .",

    ", eq .  , and eq .  , respectively .",
    "each is decoupled from the others and acts similarly to a typical tikhonov regularizer , so tuning may be done independently .",
    "generally , we want the regularizers to be as small as possible , while still avoiding noise amplification .",
    "the procedure to tune the regularization parameters heuristically is summarized as follows .",
    "first , we check if the widefield images are well - deconvolved by finding the smallest @xmath21 to give the image with best resolution but without obvious noise amplification , then we move on to check the deconvolved covariance image by tuning the sims regularizer @xmath71 and the smooth - edge filter regularizer @xmath32 using the same principle , and finally we check the final reconstruction by using the smallest shading correction regularizer @xmath75 with enough shading correction but without evident noise amplification .",
    "before introducing and comparing any sim algorithms , we want to first define the resolution criterion considered in this paper .",
    "resolution of a microscopic image is usually defined by measuring the minimal resolvable distance between two points .",
    "consider a widefield image with detected wavelength @xmath77 and numerical aperture @xmath78 ; the abbe resolution criterion is then @xmath79 , the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the widefield psf . as",
    "two points get closer to each other , the contrast between them decreases .",
    "hence , the abbe resolution criterion can be thought of as setting the minimum acceptable contrast between two points at 0.01 .",
    "we can therefore define the resolution of a microscope or a reconstruction algorithm by measuring the smallest resolvable fine features that have contrast between them of at least 0.01 .      given this definition of resolution",
    ", we quantify the resolution for various algorithms in fig .",
    "[ fig_res_def ] .",

    "the enhancement metric gives the ratio resolution improvement over widefield imaging .",
    "s - sofi resolves features down to 1.67 @xmath0 smaller than the widefield microscope , which is close to the claimed 1.6@xmath0 in  @xcite , and blind sim achieves @xmath87 improvement but lower contrast for high - frequencies , which is consistent with  @xcite . our pe - sims and pe - sims - pr ( pe - sims with pixel reassignment algorithm  @xcite described in appendix b ) algorithms give better resolution compared to other methods .",

    "if the prior for these algorithms are not accurate enough , they may solve a different problem even if the problem becomes well - posed .",

    ", we can then calculate the pattern - pattern covariance as @xmath121 although the pattern - pattern covariance is only a replica of the @xmath122 , the psf of the covariance image , @xmath43 , only depends on the multiplication of @xmath10 and @xmath123 as eq .",
    "if the period of the multi - spot pattern is large compared to @xmath124 , we can still have our psf as @xmath125 ( \\mathbf{r})$ ] , which is the same as the case of random pattern illumination .",
    "in this section , we first discuss the similarity between sims and confocal microscopy .",
    "this leads to an extension of our method that incorporates the pixel reassignment procedure proposed in  @xcite . in computing the covariance of the shifted pattern @xmath126 and the intensity @xmath39",

    ", our covariance image with psf of @xmath125 ( \\mathbf{r})$ ] is the same as a confocal image taken with illumination psf , @xmath122 , and detection psf , @xmath10 .    from the same sim dataset , we can further use the shifted patterns @xmath126 and correlate them with the intensity @xmath39 to compute a series of shifted covariance images @xmath128 the psf of the shifted covariance image @xmath129 is the product of @xmath130 and @xmath10 , whose center is approximately at @xmath131 .",
    "this image is the same as the image taken under a confocal microscope with a shifted pinhole .",
    "this implies by shifting around the patterns and correlating with the intensity , we get the equivalent of many 2d confocal images taken with the pinhole at different positions .",
    "this is the same dataset as would be described in the imaging scanning microscope , where the single - pixel camera and pinhole is replaced with a ccd in the confocal system  @xcite .",

    "pixel reassignment was proposed in  @xcite as a way to incorporate this 4d information to get a 2d image with better snr .",
    "since the 2d images from @xmath132-shifted patterns are approximately @xmath131-shifted versions of the one at @xmath133 , we can shift the information back to the center region and sum up all these images to enhance the snr and form a pixel - reassigned ( pr ) image as @xmath134 d^2 \\mathbf{r } ' \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\hspace{0.5 in } =   \\iint \\alpha_t   o(\\mathbf{r } ' ) [ ( h_{\\mathrm{illu}}\\star h_{\\mathrm{illu } } ) \\otimes h_{\\mathrm{det } } ] ( 2(\\mathbf{r } - \\mathbf{r } ' ) ) d^2 \\mathbf{r } '   \\label{eqn_sims_pr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this synthesized image using pixel reassignment gives a psf of @xmath135 ( 2\\mathbf{r})$ ] .",
    "figure  [ fig_sims_pr_otf_psf](a ) shows the comparison between the sims psf , @xmath136 ( \\mathbf{r})$ ] , and the psf of sims with pixel reassignment , @xmath135 ( 2\\mathbf{r})$ ] both in the real space and the fourier space ( assuming @xmath137 ) . in the real space , the psf after doing pixel reassignment looks fatter than the one without pixel reassignment .",
    "however , the otf of the one with pixel reassignment has larger value in the high - frequency region , where the noise severely degrade the image resolution .",
    "thus , we get better snr by summing up all the information we have and have a otf that better deals with noise at high - frequency region .",
    "since we know the psf , @xmath135 ( 2\\mathbf{r})$ ] , and the shading map , @xmath104 , of this pixel - reassigned image @xmath138 , we can again apply the deconvolution and the shading correction operation described in sec .",
