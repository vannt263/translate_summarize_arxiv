    "we first recapitulate the intermittent transition to chaos @xcite in a 1d map with one control parameter @xmath2 , @xmath3 ( @xmath4 denotes a discrete time ) .",
    "a pair of orbits with period @xmath0 appears via saddle - node bifurcation , as the control parameter @xmath2 exceeds a threshold value @xmath5 .",
    "one periodic orbit is a stable attractor , while the other one is an unstable repeller .",
    "however , as @xmath2 decreases below @xmath5 , the two periodic orbits disappear , and an intermittent chaotic attractor , characterized by the occurrence of intermittent alternations between laminar and turbulent behaviors , appears .",
    "one can easily explain the intermittency geometrically as follows .",
    "the curve of the equation @xmath6 [ @xmath7 is the @xmath0th iterate of @xmath8 has new @xmath9 intersection points with the @xmath10 line for @xmath11 , which collapse into @xmath0 points tangent to the @xmath10 line for @xmath12 ( i.e. , we have @xmath0 fixed points , @xmath13 , @xmath14 for @xmath12 ) .",
    "however , as @xmath2 decreases below @xmath5 the curve no longer touches the @xmath10 line so that a `` channel '' appears in the immediate vicinity of each point tangent to the @xmath10 line at @xmath12 .",
    "if one orbit point falls close to the entrance to one of the channels under repeated iterations of @xmath7 , it would take many iterations to go through the channel , which corresponds to the `` laminar phase . ''",
    "after slow passage through the channel , the iterates of @xmath7 move wildly until they return to one of the channels .",
    "this corresponds to the `` turbulent phase . ''",
    "thus the laminar and turbulent phases appear intermittently .",
    "the nearer @xmath2 is to @xmath5 , the longer the averaged laminar time . to obtain the average duration of the laminar phase ,",
    "consider the @xmath0th iterate @xmath15 in the immediate vicinity of one of the channels .",
    "shifting the origin of coordinate @xmath16 to a fixed point @xmath17 of @xmath15 for @xmath12 , we have @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 is a constant , and @xmath21 is a control parameter proportional to @xmath22 . using a map @xmath23 of the form ( [ eq : fm ] )",

    "thus the synchronization line becomes invariant under @xmath29 , i.e. , if a point @xmath36 lies on the synchronization line , then its image @xmath40 also lies on it .",
    "an orbit is called a(n ) ( in - phase ) synchronous orbit if it lies on the synchronization line , i.e. , it satisfies @xmath41 otherwise , it is called an ( out - of - phase ) asynchronous orbit .",
