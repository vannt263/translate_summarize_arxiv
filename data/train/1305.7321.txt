    "numerous atoms are then trapped in extreme zeeman sublevels where they do not contribute to the magnetic field insensitive 0 - 0 clock transition .",
    "this technique limits to a few percent the contrast , defined as the signal height to background ratio , of the detected resonance . to circumvent this issue , different optimized double - lambda cpt pumping schemes such as push - pull optical pumping ( ppop ) @xcite ,",
    "the use of polarized counterpropagating waves of @xmath4 field configuration in small cells @xcite , _ lin - per - lin _ @xcite or _ lin - par - lin _ @xcite were proposed to maximize the number of atoms in the clock levels .",
    "more recently , yudin et al . proposed a non - standard spectroscopic technique using a feedback control of the input probe field parameters to detect atomic resonances with high contrast @xcite .",
    "+ the detection of high contrast resonances with optimized cpt interaction schemes is known to be improved with high operating laser intensities @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , in continuous regime , high intensities broaden the cpt resonance line , limiting the clock short - term frequency stability and increasing the light shift . to get rid of these limitations , a well - known technique is the ramsey interference scheme using two separated oscillating fields @xcite .",

    "_ reported cpt ramsey fringes using a _ lin - par - lin _ scheme on cold rubidium atoms .",
    "a frequency stability of 4 @xmath5 10@xmath11 @xmath7 was obtained @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , these clocks remain complex and voluminous systems .",
    "+ recently , interesting studies were proposed to implement advanced cpt clock architectures with original and simple setups @xcite . up to date , to our knowledge ,",
    "no frequency stability performances were measured with these setups .",
    "however , we consider that such investigations are interesting to make compact cpt atomic clocks suitable for industrial transfer that requires low power consumption and a reduced number of components .",
    "+ in a recent study , we investigated cpt resonances in cs vapor cells with ppop @xcite .",
    "resonance contrasts as high as 78 % were demonstrated in continuous regime in cm - scale cells .",
    "however , such contrasts were obtained for high laser intensities that induce cpt line broadening .",
    "we propose here an original simple - architecture laser system combining for the first time ppop and ramsey spectroscopy for the detection of high - contrast and narrow ramsey fringes .",
    "while light switching for the ramsey pulsed interaction is currently realized in vapor cell clocks by an additional high - power consuming and polarization - sensitive acousto - optical modulator ( aom ) , our system uses a single mz eom both to generate optical sidebands and to switch on - off the light . this strategy allows to reduce the number of components and is compatible with the development of a compact and high - performance atomic clock .",
    "figure [ fig : figure1 ] shows the experimental set - up .",
    "the laser source is a distributed - feedback ( dfb ) diode laser tuned on the cs d@xmath1 line at 894.6 nm @xcite and shifted from cs atom resonance by 4.596 ghz .",
    "the laser light is injected into a polarization maintaining pigtailed mz eom ( photline nir - mx800-ln-10 ) .",
    "the latter allows both the generation of optical sidebands and the on - off light switch for the ramsey regime .",
    "the eom is driven at 4.596 ghz with a stabilized rf power of 22 dbm by a low noise microwave oscillator to generate first - order optical sidebands frequency - separated by 9.192 ghz .",
    "the eom bias electrode dc voltage @xmath12 is actively controlled using a microwave synchronous detector technique @xcite to the so - called _ dark point _ to stabilize the carrier suppression .",
    "this carrier suppression is inherently limited by the eom extinction ratio parameter measured to be 24 db with our device . both first - order sidebands exhibit",
    "equal power .",
    "the power of second - order harmonics is in correct agreement with theoretical calculations @xcite , about 30 db lower than the power of first - order sidebands at the dark point .",
    "the eom is temperature - controlled at 48@xmath13c at the mk level for improved laser power stabilization at the output of the eom @xcite . at the output of the eom ,",
    "the laser is split into two directions . in the first direction",
    ", the laser light can be analyzed using a fabry - perot interferometer ( fpi ) or a fast photodiode and a spectrum analyzer . in the second direction",
    ", the modulated light of fixed linear polarization is sent through a michelson interferometer ensemble in order to time - delay and to rotate the polarization of one half of the beam . a differential optical path @xmath14 of about 8.1 mm , with @xmath15 the clock transition wavelength ,",
    "is adjusted between both arms of the interferometer .",
    "both beams are then respectively right and left circularly polarized by a quarter - wave plate to produce ppop @xcite .",
    "the collimated laser beam diameter is expanded to 2 cm with a combination of two convergent lenses .",
    "laser light is then sent through a 5 cm - long and 2 cm - diameter pyrex vapor cell filled with cs atoms and a mixture of buffer gases , ar and n@xmath16 in the pressure ratio @xmath17 = 0.4 , with a total pressure @xmath18 of 15 torr .",
    "the cell is temperature stabilized at the mk level at 38@xmath13c and located in a static magnetic field parallel to the laser beam to raise the zeeman degeneracy .",
    "the cell is isolated from external electromagnetic perturbations with a double layer mu - metal shield .",
    "the transmitted optical power through the cell is detected by a low noise photodiode .",
    "the resulting signal is analyzed by a computer that drives a microwave switch and the synthesizer output frequency .",
    "cpt spectroscopy is realized by scanning the local oscillator frequency around 4.596 ghz .",
    "figure [ fig : tf - eom ] displays the optical harmonics power ( height of the peaks at the output of the fpi ) and the cpt signal ( in continuous regime ) at the output of the mz eom versus the bias voltage @xmath12 when the rf power is continuously activated . the cpt signal height is found to be maximized for the so - called _ dark point _ @xmath19 2.6 v where the optical carrier is optimally rejected and the power in first - order optical sidebands is maximized . at the opposite case ,",

    "contrary to the cw regime where the cpt linewidth broadens with increased laser power , we measured in the pulsed case that the fringe linewidth does not depend on the laser power and narrows as @xmath37 .",
    "+ a possible drawback of the used mz eom is to exhibit a relatively low extinction ratio of only 24db . in order to estimate its effect ( see fig . [",

    "the cpt fringe signal is measured to decrease rapidly when the laser power in the time @xmath22 is increased .",

    "interestingly , for a residual light power @xmath25 100 @xmath26w , a plateau seems to be reached indicating that a better light extinction does not bring a relevant improvement on the clock signal .",
    "nevertheless , we expect that a total light extinction during the time @xmath22 is of great importance and to be preferred in order to minimize light shift effects for atomic clocks applications .",
    "the frequency stability of atomic clocks is currently expressed by the allan deviation @xmath39 . assuming the photon shot noise as the only noise source , the shot - noise limit of the clock relative frequency stability can be estimated by : @xmath40 where @xmath30 is the fringe width",

    "( [ eq ] ) yields @xmath45 at 1 s averaging time .",
    "this value is about one order of magnitude better than shot - noise estimations in the cw regime @xcite . in real life",
    ", this result will be degraded by various noise mechanisms such as the detector noise , the laser intensity and frequency noise or the oscillator phase noise through dick effect @xcite . in a first step",
    ", we estimate that demonstrating an experimental frequency stability better than 10@xmath6 at 1 s integration time with our system is a reasonable objective .",
