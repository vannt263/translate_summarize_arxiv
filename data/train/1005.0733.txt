    "several models of trapping of random walkers by a target have been extensively discussed in the literature  @xcite . in most cases , in the analysis of the target lifetime , the initial distribution of walkers is taken at random ( spatially homogeneous distribution ) and the trapping is assumed `` perfect ''  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "some results concerning to the _ order statistics _ of a set of random walkers are known when they are initially placed onto a given site of an euclidean lattice  @xcite or a fractal structure  @xcite .",
    "thus , the question that arises naturally is how different initial configurations of the walkers , number of walkers , and trapping mechanisms affect on the survival probability of the target .    in this paper",
    "we address the problem of trapping by a fixed target at the origin in the presence of a set of @xmath0 independent random walkers .",
    "the quantity of our interest is the lifetime of the trap , which ends when _ any _ walker reaches the target under the appropriate circumstances .",
    "our approach not only provides a unified framework that comprises several situations of trapping scattered in the literature , but also enables us to compute ( analytical and numerically ) the lifetime of the trap in an exact way for a vast number of practical situations .",
    "thus , we consider that the wandering of the walkers in the space may be normal or anomalous diffusion , and that the trapping may have particular characteristics : it may be perfect , in which case the lifetime of the trap reckons the time spend by the first walker to reach the origin , or imperfect  @xcite .",
    "the last situation includes the cases in which a walker passing by the origin is not trapped with certainty .",
    "also , the present formalism could be applied even though we have dynamical trapping , i.e. , the state of trap change in time like gated trapping  @xcite .",
    "a novel application of our concepts comes from the hand of intermittent motion phenomena , which has recently motivated numerous studies in physics , chemistry , and biology  @xcite . in this piece of work ,",
    "we show that the analysis of the trap s lifetime , as a function of the transition rates among internal states of the walker , allow us to optimize the intermittent search strategy for a hidden target .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : life ] presents the general formalism and define the concepts of survival of the target , lifetime density , and mean quantities ; and establishes the connection with the problem of only one walker .",
    "particularly , the last issue or first - passage time problem  @xcite , is reviewed in sec .",
    "[ sec : fpt ] , whereas in sec .",
    "[ sec : d - dim ] we reconsider the effects of dimensionality and number of walkers on our problem .",

    "last , in sec .",
    "[ sec : intermittent ] , we discuss the usefulness of our approach for searching targets with stochastic intermittent motion . finally in sec.[sec : fin ] we give our conclusions .",
    "the major objective of this contribution is the study of the effects of the initial distribution of independent walkers and the characteristics of the trapping process in the survival of the target .",
    "for this task , we begin reviewing and generalizing the formalism developed in ref .  @xcite .",
    "the survival probability at time @xmath1 , @xmath2 , of the static target ( trap ) at the origin in presence of @xmath0 independent walkers that diffuse on a lattice can be written as  @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 denote the joint probability distribution of _ initially _ finding the first walker at a position @xmath5 , the second at @xmath6 and so on .",
    "@xmath7 is the survival probability of the target at time @xmath1 in the presence of only one walker initially at position @xmath8 . in eq .",
    "( [ phin(t ) ] ) , the sums run over all the lattices sites , and become in integrals over the space in the case of diffusion in the continuous space .    from the survival probability",
    ", we define the target lifetime density ( tld ) , @xmath9 , in the presence of @xmath0 walkers , in the standard way by @xmath10 then , we can write  @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the target lifetime density in the presence of only one walker , initially at position @xmath8 . this quantity is defined from @xmath7 in an analogous way to eq .",
    "( [ fn(t ) ] ) , @xmath13 in the case of perfect trapping , @xmath12 is the first - passage time density of the walker .",
    "when @xmath12 is normalized , trapping is certain and the process is called _ recurrent _ in the sense proposed by hughes  @xcite . on the other hand , if @xmath14 then the process is called _ transient _",
    "@xmath15 is the probability that a walker starting from site @xmath16 will ever reach the origin .",
    "now , using tld , we introduce the mean target lifetime ( mtl )  @xcite @xmath17 if @xmath18 for @xmath19 , then we can also write @xmath20",
    "a general expression for @xmath7 can be constructed in terms of the conditional probability @xmath21 , corresponding to a walker be in @xmath22 at time @xmath1 , given that it was at @xmath16 at @xmath23 , restricted by the presence of a trap at the origin @xmath24 where the sum runs over all lattice sites and must be replaced by an integral in the continuous case .",
    "this expression is valid for any kind of trap , allowing for example imperfect trapping or dynamical gated trapping .    for markov processes , in the perfect trapping case",
    ", we can additionally exploit the connection between the probability density of first arrival at the origin at time @xmath1 from the initial site @xmath16 , @xmath12 , and the conditional probability of finding an unrestricted walker at site @xmath22 at time t , given that it was initially at @xmath16 , @xmath25 ,  @xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the sojourn probability , i.e. , the probability that the walker remains on the site @xmath16 a time lag @xmath28 without a transition . moreover , for an stationary process we have @xmath29 and the integral in eq .",

    "thus , the laplace transform of eq .",
    "( [ fundamental ] ) lead us to the laplace transform of the first - passage time density @xmath30 where the caret denotes the laplace transform of the corresponding function .",
    "therefore , using eqs .",
    "( [ f1 ] ) and  ( [ f1(u ) ] ) , the initial condition @xmath31 , and taking @xmath32 , we finally get the laplace transform of the survival probability of the target in presence of only one walker , @xmath33 finally , in a similar way as in eq.([mtl2 ] ) , the mean first - passage time ( mfpt ) for the walker can be written as @xmath34",
    "if the trapping is perfect , mtl is also the mfpt for the first of the set of @xmath0 random walkers in reach the target .",
    "an interesting problem is presented when the mfpt for only one walker diverges , i.e. , when the integral of eq .",
    "( [ t1 ] ) diverges .",
    "in this situation , the interesting question that arises is to find the minimum number of walkers such that mtl becomes finite  @xcite , independently of the initial positions of the walkers .",
    "that is , from eqs .",
    "( [ phin(t ) ] ) and  ( [ mtl2 ] ) , to find @xmath0 for which the integral @xmath36 converges .",

    ", we use the ctrw  @xcite for the walker s dynamics .",
    "this allows us compute analytically the survival probability of the trap in presence of one walker .",

    "( [ tn ] ) is not reached for any value of @xmath0 .    on the other hand , although the mfpt diverges for @xmath94 , the asymptotic limit of the survival probability of the target , which is proportional to @xmath97 with each factor less than one , decreases monotonously with @xmath0 , independently of the initial distribution of the walkers .",
    "alternatively , we can proceed as in ref .",
    "@xcite choosing only the random walkers that will ever reach the target .",
    "for this purpose , it is necessary to define the conditional probability density of first arrival at the origin at time @xmath1 from the initial site @xmath16 , given that the walker will eventually arrive there : @xmath98 .",
