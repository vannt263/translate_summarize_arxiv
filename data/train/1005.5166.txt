    "binary systems containing a roche - lobe filling main - sequence star that loses mass to a primary white dwarf ( wd ) are referred to as cataclysmic variables ( cvs , see  @xcite for an overview ) .",
    "t pyx is a luminous cv in which the donor star is transferring mass at a very high rate onto a high - mass white dwarf , resulting in unusually frequent thermo - nuclear runaways ( tnrs ) on the surface of the primary . between the years",
    "1890 @xmath11 1967 , t pyx has undergone five such nova eruptions , with an recurrence time of about 20 years between the eruptions , and was therefore classified as a member of the recurrent nova ( rn ) subclass . however , the last eruption was in 1966 , which means that t pyx has now passed its mean recurrence time by more than 20 years .",
    "the eruptive behavior of rne in comparison with classical novae is thought to be due to a high mass - transfer rate in combination with a massive primary white dwarf  @xcite .",
    "@xcite carried out an extensive photometric study of t pyx and found a stable , periodic signal at @xmath12 hours that was interpreted as the likely orbital period .",
    "this would place t pyx below the cv period gap and suggests a donor mass around @xmath13 m@xmath7 .",
    "this is surprising . according to standard evolutionary models",
    ", a cv below the period gap should be faint and have a low accretion rate driven primarily by gravitational radiation ( gr ) .",
    "yet t pyx s quiescent luminosity and status as a rn both imply that it has a high accretion rate of @xmath14 m@xmath7 yr@xmath4 ( @xcite ;  @xcite ) .",
    "this is about two orders of magnitude higher than expected for ordinary cvs at this period .    assuming that the determination of the photometric orbital period is correct",
    ", the existence of t pyx is interesting for at least two reasons . first , unless we are seeing the system in a transient evolutionary state",
    ", its lifetime would have to be very short @xmath15  myrs .",
    "this would imply the existence of an evolutionary channel leading to the fast destruction of at least some short - period cvs .",
    "second , tnrs frequent enough to qualify as rne are thought to be possible only on high - mass accreting wds ( @xmath16 m@xmath7 )",
    ". moreover , rne are the only class of novae in which the wd is expected to gain more mass between eruptions than it loses during them .",
    "this would make t pyx a strong candidate type ia supernova progenitor",
    ".    however , the recent study of the system by  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) suggests , first , that t pyx _ is _ , in fact , in a transient evolutionary state , and , second , that , integrated over many nova eruptions , its wd does lose more mass than it gains . more specifically ,  @xcite suggest that t pyx was an ordinary cataclysmic variable until it erupted as a nova in 1866 .",
    "this eruption triggered a wind - driven supersoft x - ray phase ( as first suggested by  @xcite ) , resulting in an unusually high luminosity and accretion rate .",
    "however , unlike in the original scenario proposed by  @xcite , the supersoft phase is not self - sustaining , so that the accretion rate has been declining ever since the 1866 nova eruption from @xmath17 m@xmath7yr@xmath4 to @xmath18m@xmath7yr@xmath4 . as a result",
    ", t pyx has faded by almost 2 magnitudes since the nova eruption ( @xcite ) .",
    "based on this , and the fact that t pyx has already passed its mean recurrence time by more than 20 years ,  @xcite argue that t pyx might no longer even be a recurrent nova .",
    "if these ideas are correct , t pyx is not a viable sn ia progenitor , and its remaining lifetime can be substantially longer than a few million years .",
    "however , if all its ordinary nova eruptions are followed by relatively long - lived ( > 100 yrs ) intervals of wind - driven evolution at high @xmath19 , its secular evolution may nevertheless be strongly affected , with significant implications for cv evolution more generally ( see also section  [ sd ] ) .",
    "a key assumption in virtually all of these arguments is that the photometric period measured by  @xcite is , in fact , the orbital period of the system .",
    "so far , there has only been one attempt to obtain a spectroscopic period for t pyx , by  @xcite , who reported a spectroscopic modulation with @xmath20 hours .",
    "such a long orbital period above the cv period gap would be much more consistent with the high accretion rate found in t pyx . in this study , we present the first definitive spectroscopic determination of the orbital period of t pyx , showing that it is , in fact , consistent with patterson et al.s photometric period .",
    "we also use our time - resolved spectroscopy to estimate the main system parameters , such as the velocity semi - amplitude of the white dwarf ( @xmath21 ) , the mass - ratio ( q ) , the masses ( @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) and the orbital inclination ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "finally , we discuss the implications of our results for the evolution of t pyx and related systems .",
    "multi - fibre spectroscopy of t pyx was obtained during five nights in 2004 and 2005 with the giraffe / flames instrument mounted on the unit telescope 2 of the vlt at eso paranal , chile .",
    "the data were taken in the integrated field - unit mode .",
    "the total field of view in this mode is about 11.5 `` @xmath25 7.3 '' and thus covers most of t pyx s 10 \" diameter nova shell ( @xcite ) .",
    "we used the fibre system argus , which consists of 317 fibres distributed across the field , of which 5 are pointing to a calibration unit and 15 are pointing to sky .",
    "the grating order was 4 , which gives a resolution of r=12000 .",
    "the wavelength range was chosen between 4501 to 5078  , so that the emission - line spectrum would include the bowen blend at 4645  4650  and the heii at 4686  . with this setup ,",
    "the dispersion is 0.2  / pix , corresponding to about 12.5 kms@xmath4/pix .",
    "the full widths at half - maximum ( fwhms ) of a few spectral lines obtained simultaneously with the science spectra from fibres pointing to the calibration unit indicate that the spectral resolution is about 0.4  .",
    "a log of the observations can be found in table  [ tab : obs ] .",
    "the initial steps in the data reduction were performed using the eso pipeline for giraffe .",
    "the pipeline is based on the reduction software bldrs from the observatory of geneva .",
    "the basic functions of the pipeline are to provide master calibration data and dispersion solutions .",
    "the pipeline also provides an image of the reconstructed field of view , which can be used to associate a specific fibre to a given object . in order to extract the spectrum from the desired fibre and to correct for the contribution from the sky background and cosmic rays , the output from the pipeline",
    "was processed further in iraf .",
    "the psf of our target , t pyx , is spread out over several fibres and 6 single fibre spectra containing significant target flux were extracted and median combined after weighting each spectrum by the mean flux in the region 4660 - 4710 (covering heii at 4686  ) .",
    "cosmic rays were removed by first binning the spectra over 7 pixels ( the cosmic rays have a typical width of 2 @xmath11 6 pixels ) .",
    "the smoothed spectra were then subtracted from the corresponding fibre spectra to only leave the residuals and the cosmic rays .",
    "cosmic rays were then removed and the residuals added back to the target spectra .",
    "fibres containing the sky were extracted and combined to create a master - sky spectrum . finally , the master - sky was subtracted from the combined science spectrum .",
    "t pyx was observed again during four nights in march 2008 , this time on the 6.5 meter baade telescope magellan i at las campanas , chile ( see table  [ tab : obs ] for a log of the observations ) .",
    "long - slit spectroscopy was obtained with the instrument imacs using the gra-1200 - 17.45 grating with a 0.9 \" slit , resulting in a dispersion of 0.386  / pix , corresponding to about 25 kms@xmath4/pix .",

    "the radial - velocity study was carried out for several spectral lines but for the purpose of this section , we will focus exclusively on the radial - velocities derived from the strong heii line at 4686  , since this line provides the most accurate results .",

    "doppler tomography  @xcite , is an indirect imaging method where the emission - line profiles , depending on phase , are plotted onto a velocity scale .",

    "these asymmetric features are also seen in the trailed spectrograms ( figure  [ fig : spec ] ) .",
    "no emission can be connected to the bright spot , the accretion stream or the donor star .",
    "the map of the bowen blend was constructed from a composite of the three lines , niii at @xmath264640.64 and ciii at @xmath264650.1 and @xmath264647.4 .",

    "in order to confirm the reality of these variations , we extracted spectra from a few vlt / giraffe / flames fibres that were centered on knots in the nova shell surrounding t pyx .",
    "the intrinsic radial velocities of these large - scale knots are not expected to change appreciably over a time - scale of months , so they provide a useful check on the stability of our wavelength calibration .",
    "we found that the shifts seen in the radial velocity data for the central object are much larger than those seen for the knots , suggesting that these shifts can not be explained by instrumental effects alone .",
    "however , since we have only five nights worth of vlt data spread over two months , our data set is too sparse to allow a careful study of trends in the apparent @xmath42 velocities . for the purpose of the present study",
    ", we thus subtracted the mean nightly @xmath42 from all radial velocities before carrying out any analysis .",
    "this should minimize the risk of biasing our results .      in order to establish the velocity semi - amplitude , @xmath21 , of the wd",
    ", further analysis was pursued on the radial - velocity data obtained from the double - gaussian method .",
    "a least squares fit was made to the radial velocity curves by keeping the orbital period fixed , but allowing the three parameters , the systemic velocity , @xmath42 , the velocity semi - amplitude , @xmath43 , and the phase , @xmath44 , to vary .",
    "phase zero corresponds to the photometric phase minimum light .",
    "the errors on the input radial velocity data , provided in molly , were used to calculate the @xmath45 and then rescaled",
    "so that @xmath46 .",
    "the technique was applied to several strong lines in both the vlt and magellan data sets , but the radial velocity data measured from the heii line at 4686  , and in particular from the magellan dataset , gave the most reliable fits .",
    "the results were plotted in a diagnostic diagram ( see  @xcite ;  @xcite and  @xcite ) . however , as can be seen in figure  [ fig : dd ] , the key parameters ( @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 ) did not converge convincingly for any combination of the fwhm and separation .",
    "normally , it is thought that the bright spot or other asymmetries in the disc are responsible for distorting the diagnostic diagram .",
    "however , in t pyx the disc appears to be rather symmetric , and no contribution from the bright spot is seen ( see figure  [ fig : tom ] ) .",
    "we conclude that the radial velocity curves obtained from the double - gaussian method are , most likely , not tracking the velocity of the primary wd , and therefore , @xmath21 , and @xmath44 can not be estimated reliably using this method .    ,",
    "@xmath43 and @xmath44 ) are converging for any combination of the fwhm and separation.,width=340 ]    in order to improve on the results obtained from the double - gaussian method , we used two other techniques to obtain an estimate of @xmath21 .",
    "first , we measured the velocity center of the lines by fitting gaussians to the individual spectral lines .",
    "two gaussians were fitted to the double - peaked lines , keeping the fwhm and the rest wavelength of the line fixed , but allowing the peak offsets and the peak strengths to vary .",
    "radial velocity curves were then plotted for both blue and red wings . as can be seen from the trailed spectrograms , figure  [ fig : spec ] , the red wing ( in particular for the heii lines )",
    "does not show the same smooth orbital signal as the blue wing .",
    "consequently , only the data from the blue wing was taken into account when measuring @xmath21 .",
    "several lines from both the vlt and magellan data sets were analyzed .",
    "the data were phase - binned to the orbital resolution , velocity - binned in a @xmath47 100 pixel wide region around the line , and the nightly mean @xmath42 was subtracted .",
    "heii at @xmath264686 is the strongest line and was ultimately used to estimate our best - bet value of the velocity semi - amplitude of the wd : @xmath48 kms@xmath4 .",
    "figure  [ fig : rv ] shows the radial velocities obtained for the heii line in the magellan data set .",
    "data presented in black are phase - binned to the orbital resolution afforded by our time - resolved spectroscopy , while all invidual data points are shown in grey . over - plotted onto the radial velocity curve is the best sinusoidal fit , indicating a phasing close to zero , @xmath49 .",
    "figure  [ fig : trail_heii ] shows the final trailed spectrograms from the heii at @xmath264686 in the magellan data set that was used to determine @xmath21 .",
    "second , @xmath21 can also be measured from the doppler tomograms , by locating the center of symmetry of the disk emission that dominates the maps .",
    "this center should be located at @xmath50 and @xmath51 ( eg .  @xcite ) . after masking out any regions of strong asymmetric non - disk emission , the center of symmetry",
    "was found by taking a trial point , smoothing the map azimuthally about this point , and then subtracting this smoothed map from the real map .",
    "if the trial point is far from the center of symmetry , the resulting difference map will contain large asymmetric residuals .",
    "the optimal center of symmetry is thus the trial point for which the difference map exhibits the smallest residuals ( as measured by the standard deviation of the difference map ) .",
    "this procedure yielded estimates for @xmath21 that were consistent with those obtained from the gaussian fits ( @xmath52 kms@xmath4 ) .",
    "we thus adopt @xmath48 km@xmath53 as our best - bet estimate .    in closing this section",
    ", it should be acknowledged that our final estimate of @xmath21 is subject to considerably systematic uncertainties . in particular , it is difficult to rule out that whatever is preventing the double gaussian method from converging may also bias the gaussian fits to the line peaks and the center of symmetry of the tomograms . strictly speaking",
    ", our estimate of @xmath21 should thus perhaps be viewed as a lower limit .",
    "however , we are reasonably confident that our measurements do trace the orbital motion of the wd in t pyx .",
    "this is mainly because the presence of persistent double - peaked lines and ring - like structure in the tomograms implies that there is a strong accretion disk component to the line emission .",
    "this disk component must ultimately trace the motion of the wd , and our two preferred methods are designed to exploit this in as direct a fashion as possible , while simultaneously minimizing contamination from asymmetrically placed emission regions .",
    "the peak - to - peak separations of the double peaked emission lines can be used to estimate the projected velocity at the outer disc radius , @xmath54 .",
    "we thus fitted gaussians to the phase - binned , double - peaked h@xmath40 , hei and heii lines in the magellan data set .",
    "the peak - to - peak separations varies significantly with line but the mean value is close to that for hei .",
    "we therefore use the hei peak - to - peak separation for our estimation of @xmath54 , and adopt half the full range as a rough estimate of the associated error , @xmath55 kms@xmath4 .",
    "@xcite investigated the exact relationship between the true @xmath54 and the measured @xmath56 , taking into account the effects of instrumental broadenings and different disk emissivity distributions .",
    "he found that , for a wide range of parameters , @xmath57 , where @xmath58 . taking this into account",
    ", we find @xmath59 kms@xmath4 .        , the outer disc radius as well as the location of the donor star , @xmath60 , and the accretion stream is plotted onto the map.,width=340 ]",
    "if we are willing to assume that our estimates of @xmath21 and @xmath54 are valid , we can use our data to estimate several other system parameters .",
    "the method we use to estimate the mass ratio , @xmath61 , is similar to that described in  @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is that , subject to fairly benign assumption , the ratio @xmath62 should be a function of only @xmath61 .",
    "more specifically , we assume that the disk is circular , keplerian , and , since t pyx is a high-@xmath19  system , that it extends all the way to the tidal radius . the disk radius",
    "can then be taken as @xmath63  @xcite .",
    "these assumptions , together with kepler s third law , yield the expected relationship    @xmath64    using this expression , we estimate a mass ratio of @xmath65 .",
    "+   + given a mass ratio and disk radius , it is possible to estimate the expected phasing of the bright spot in the system , if we make the usual assumption that the bright spot lies at the point where the ballistic accretion stream from the l@xmath66 point meets the disk edge ( see , for example ,  @xcite ;  @xcite ) .",
    "carrying out this calculation for t pyx suggests that the bright spot could be located at orbital phase @xmath67 .",
    "this is interesting , because it is consistent with the negligible phase offset we have found between photometric minimum light and the red - to - blue crossing of the wd radial velocity curve .",
    "thus , based on phasing alone , the bright spot could be the source of the photometric modulation .",
    "however , there are also other interpretations for the photometric signature . for example",
    ", the orbital signal could be dominated by a reflection effect , i.e. the changing projected area of the irradiated face of the donor as it moves around the orbit .",
    "this would explain why inferior conjunction of the secondary corresponds to _ minimum _ light .",
    "on the other hand , it raises the question why we do not see the signature of the irradiated donor in our spectroscopy .",
    "as noted above , there is no sign of the narrow bowen fluorescence lines that one might expect in the case of strong donor irradiation .",
    "recurrent novae are expected to harbor a more massive wd than most ordinary cvs , and even than most classical novae . in a classical nova ,",
    "the mass of the wd is typically close to 1 m@xmath7 , both theoretically and observationally .",
    "based on this , both  @xcite and  @xcite agree on a plausible mass range for the primary wd in t pyx of 1.25 @xmath11 1.4 m@xmath7 ( using theoretical models by  @xcite ) . from the theoretical point of view",
    ", a high - mass wd is needed to achieve a sufficiently short outburst recurrence timescale .",
    "in t pyx , the bright accretion disc outshines any spectral signature from the donor star , and we can therefore not constrain the donor mass spectroscopically . however , we can use the period - density relation for roche - lobe filling secondary stars  @xcite to set some constraints .",
    "as shown by  @xcite and  @xcite , the donor stars in ordinary cvs below the period gap are inflated by approximately 10% due to mass loss , relative to ordinary main sequence stars of the same mass .",
    "given t pyx s peculiar evolutionary state , it is not clear if this level of inflation is appropriate for t pyx , and we therefore adopt a conservative range of 0% @xmath11 20% inflation . in order to estimate the mass of the donor star",
    ", we thus take the theoretical main - sequence mass - radius relation from the 5 gyr isochrone of  @xcite , adjust the stellar radius to account for inflation , and then find the secondary mass that yields the correct density for t pyx s orbital period .",
    "this yields @xmath68 m@xmath7 .",
    "note that the inferred donor mass decreases with increasing levels of radius inflation .",
    "the corresponding mass of the wd is then @xmath69m@xmath7 .",
    "since this estimate of the wd mass is lower than expected for a recurrent nova , we can also turn the problem around .",
    "if the mass of the wd is @xmath70 m@xmath7 , as theoretical nova models imply  @xcite , the mass of the donor becomes > @xmath71m@xmath7 , if our estimate of the mass ratio is correct .",
    "all of these estimates should , of course , be taken with a grain of salt .",
    "in particular , they rely on ( i ) the correctness of our measured @xmath21 and ( ii ) the assumption that the disk extends all the way to the tidal radius . despite these uncertainties ,",
    "our calculations highlight an important point : it is highly unlikely that the donor star in t pyx is already a brown dwarf .",
    "for example , if we retain the assumption of maximal disk size , @xmath72  kms@xmath4 would be required in order for @xmath73  m@xmath7 for any @xmath74m@xmath7 .",
    "we thus rule out the possibility that t pyx is a period bouncer in the usual sense , i.e. that it had already reached the minimum period for ordinary cvs ( @xmath75  min theoretically , or @xmath76  min observationally ) , in which case its secondary would now be well below the hydrogen - burning limit .      the orbital inclination for t pyx is thought to be low due to the sharp spectral profiles and low radial velocity amplitude .",
    "@xcite suggested a lower limit of the orbital inclination for t pyx of @xmath77 based on the peak - to - peak separation of the h@xmath78 line in their spectra .",
    "@xcite estimated an inclination of @xmath79 due to the low amplitude of the orbital signal , and  @xcite estimated @xmath80 .",
    "the inclination , @xmath24 , can be estimated from our data via @xmath81 , where @xmath82 and @xmath83 is the distance between the two components obtained from kepler s iii law .",
    "this provides a constraint on the system inclination of @xmath84 degrees , for any reasonable combination of the component masses .",
    "we stress that the real uncertainty on the inclination is bound to be larger , because the formal error does not include systematic uncertainties associated with , for example , possible bias in our @xmath21 measurement and the assumption of tidal truncation in our derivation of @xmath61 .",
    "the main result of our study is the spectroscopic determination of t pyx s orbital period , @xmath85  hrs .",
    "this confirms that the system is a cv below the period gap and implies that its current accretion rate is at least 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of an ordinary cv at this period .",
    "we also find that our spectroscopic orbital period is consistent with the photometric ephemeris found for t pyx ( @xcite , an updated version is given in section  [ pe ] ) .",
    "this means not only that photometric timings can be used as a more precise and convenient tracer of the orbital motion , but also that the large period derivative required by the photometric ephemeris marks a genuine change in the orbital period of the system .",
    "in fact , the spectroscopic data are consistent with the photometric period only if the period derivative is accounted for .",
    "the period derivative obtained here from the latest combined photometric data ( @xmath86 ) is slightly lower than that obtained by  @xcite from data up to 1997 ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "a decrease in the rate of period change would be in line with  @xcite scenario that t pyx s days as a high-@xmath19 recurrent nova are numbered ( at least until its next ordinary nova eruption ) .",
    "in any case , the average time - scale for period change found across all the photometric data are about @xmath88  yrs .",
    "we have also used our spectroscopic data to obtain estimates of other key system parameters , most notably the radial velocity semi - amplitude of the wd , @xmath48 kms@xmath4 , and the mass ratio , @xmath89 .",
    "the latter estimate rests on three key assumptions : first , that our determination of @xmath21 is correct , second , that our estimate @xmath54 is correct , and , third , that the accretion disk around the wd in t pyx is tidally limited .",
    "taken at face value , this relatively high value of the mass ratio implies that the donor star in the system is not a brown dwarf .",
    "thus t pyx is not a period bouncer .",
    "if we assume that the radius of the secondary is @xmath90 inflated relative to an ordinary main sequence star of the same mass , we find that its most likely mass is @xmath91 m@xmath7 .",
    "overall , the physical picture that emerges from our study is consistent with the scenario proposed by  @xcite .",
    "in particular , they suggest that , prior to the 1866 eruption , t pyx was an ordinary cv .",
    "that eruption then triggered a high-@xmath19 wind - driven phase , as suggested by  @xcite to account for t pyx s exceptional luminosity .",
    "however , this phase is not quite self - sustaining , so that t pyx is now fading and perhaps not even a rn anymore . in line with this picture",
    ", we find that the mass ratio and donor mass we derive are not abnormally low for a cv at its orbital period .",
    "this shows that the present phase of high-@xmath19 accretion can not have gone on for too long already .",
    "the hint of a declining period derivative may point in the same direction , but this needs to be confirmed .",
    "does all this mean that the phase of extraordinarily high accretion rates t pyx is currently experiencing will have no lasting impact on its evolution ?",
    "not necessarily . in a stationary roche - lobe - filling system , the orbital period derivative and total mass - loss rate from the donor ( wind loss + mass transfer ) are related via @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the donor s mass - radius index . in t pyx , which has an increasing orbital period",
    ", we will take @xmath94 , which is appropriate for adiabatic mass - loss from a fully convective star ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "we thus expect that @xmath95 , which suggests a typical mass - loss rate from the donor of @xmath96  m@xmath7/yr in its current state .",
    "( the accretion rate onto the wd can be lower than this , since , in the wind - driven scenario , much of this mass escapes in the form of an irradiation - driven outflow from the donor . ) if every ordinary nova eruption in t pyx is followed by @xmath47 100 yrs of such high-@xmath97 evolution , the total mass loss from the donor in the luminous phase is @xmath98 m@xmath7 between any two such eruptions .",
    "this needs to be compared to the mass lost from the donor during the remaining part of the cycle .",
    "if this is driven by gravitational radiation , the mass loss rate from the donor will be @xmath99  m@xmath7/yr  @xcite .",
    "the recurrence time of ordinary nova eruptions for such a system is on the order of @xmath100 yrs  @xcite , so the total mass lost from the donor during its normal evolution ( outside the wind - driven phase ) is @xmath101 m@xmath7 .",
    "_ this shows that the long - term secular evolution may be dominated by its high-@xmath19 wind - driven phases , even if the duty cycle of these phases is very low ( e.g. 0.1% for the numbers adopted above ) . _",
    "it is finally tempting to speculate on the relevance of `` t pyx - like '' evolution for ordinary cvs . at first sight , the numbers above suggest that the evolution of a cv caught in such a state may be accelerated by about an order of magnitude .",
    "this is interesting , since it could bear on the long - standing problem that there are fewer short - period cvs and period bouncers in current samples than theoretically expected ( e.g.  @xcite ;  @xcite ;  @xcite ; pretorius & knigge 2008ab ) .",
    "moreover , this channel need not be limited to systems containing high - mass wds that are capable of becoming rne .",
    "after all , it is not the recurrent nova outbursts that are of interest from an evolutionary point of view , but simply the existence of a prolonged high-@xmath19 phase in the aftermath of nova eruptions . in cvs containing lower - mass wds , such a phase may still occur , although its evolutionary significance could still depend on the wd mass .",
    "for example , the interoutburst time - scale is longer for low - mass wds , and the duration of the high-@xmath19 phase could also scale with wd mass .",
    "one obvious objection to this idea is that , observationally , most nova eruptions are not followed by centuries- ( or even decades- ) long high-@xmath19 phases .",
    "however , this need not be a serious issue .",
    "most observed novae are long - period systems , so if the triggering of a wind - driven phase requires a fully convective donor , most novae would not be expected to enter such a phase .",
    "it may be relevant in this context that at least one other short - period nova ",
    "gq mus  exhibited an exceptionally long post - outburst supersoft phase of @xmath102  years  @xcite .",
    "@xcite have also suggested that the duration of the supersoft phase in novae may scale inversely with orbital period .",
    "however , there is another important consequence to the idea that the evolution of many short - period cvs is accelerated by `` t pyx - like '' high - luminosity phases .",
    "the orbital period - derivative is positive in the high-@xmath19 phase , but negative during the remaining times of gr - driven evolution .",
    "but since @xmath103 in _ both _ phases , the sign of the secular ( long - term - average ) period derivative will generally correspond to the phase that dominates the secular evolution .",
    "so whenever wind - driving dramatically accelerates the binary evolution , the direction of period evolution will also be reversed .",
    "is this a problem ? perhaps .",
    "the recent detection of the long - sought _ period spike _ in the distribution of cv orbital periods  @xcite suggests that there is , in fact , a reasonably well - defined minimum period for cvs , as has long been predicted by the standard model of cv evolution ( e.g.  @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the location of the observed spike ( @xmath104  mins ) is significantly different from the expected one ( @xmath105  min ) .",
    "is it possible that the observed period minimum corresponds to the onset of wind - driving in most cvs ?",
    "t pyx , with @xmath106  min would then have to be an outlier , however , perhaps because of an unusually high wd mass .",
    "the idea that t pyx - like phases may significantly affect the evolution of many cvs is , of course , highly speculative , and we do not mean to endorse it too strongly . however , it highlights the importance of understanding t pyx : until we know what triggered the current high - luminosity state , it will remain difficult to assess the broader evolutionary significance of this phase .",
    "note that the apparent uniqueness of t pyx is not a strong argument against such significance .",
    "for example , if the duty cycle of high - luminosity phases is @xmath107% , as suggested by the numbers above , we should not expect to catch many cvs in this state .",
    "thus t pyx could be the tip of the proverbial iceberg .",
