    "populating a wd - dominated galactic halo , in conjunction with a standard stellar initial mass function ( imf ) , would lead to a corresponding increase in the production of type  ii supernovae ( sneii ) and the rapid overproduction of heavy elements ( gibson & mould 1997 , hereafter gm97 ) .",
    "in addition , the expected number of low - mass red dwarfs would violate the deep halo star counts of flynn et .",
    "these high- and low - mass `` constraints '' imply that a standard imf can not be employed to populate a putative wd - dominated galactic halo . instead",
    ", the imf would have had to have been comprised almost exclusively of stars in the range 1@xmath8m / m@xmath1@xmath08 - such wd - heavy imfs have been discussed in the literature by chabrier et  al .",
    "( 1996 - hereafter c96 ) and adams & laughlin ( 1996 ) .",
    "besides the requirement that any wd - heavy imf be restricted to 1@xmath0m / m@xmath1@xmath08 , there is an additional constraint provided by the observed abundance patterns in population  ii halo stars .",
    "gm97 found that a wd - dominated imf ( wdimf ) inevitably leads to the overproduction of carbon and nitrogen relative to oxygen - _ by more than an order of magnitude - in comparison with that seen in the oldest stars of the milky way s halo .",
    "this result is a natural consequence of the life cycle of low- and intermediate - mass stars , stars which are responsible for synthesising the majority of the carbon and nitrogen in the universe .",
    "fields et  al .",
    "( 2000 ) confirmed the analysis of gm97 , concluding that the halo carbon and nitrogen arguent provides the strictest constraint to any wd - dominated halo scenario .",
    "_    while there is no compelling direct evidence for variable imfs , _ at the present time ( e.g. gilmore 2001 ) , several theoretical studies suggest that the imf of the first generation of stars ( so - called population  iii ) might be quite different from that of the canonical salpeter imf ( simf ) .",
    "direct simulation attempts to form pop  iii stars indicate an imf biased toward super massive stars ( m @xmath9 m@xmath1 ) rather than white dwarf progenitors ( abel , bryan & norman 1999 , 2002 ) .",
    "it is the lack of metals , which cause cloud fragmentation of gas in star forming regions , that results in such a top heavy imf ( see also bromm et .",
    "al 2001 ) .",
    "other studies also indicate a different imf for pop  iii stars , e.g. , yoshii & saio ( 1987 ) and nakamura & umemura ( 2001 ) , which suggested a bimodal imf making large numbers of super massive stars around 100 m@xmath1 and a futher peak in the intermediate , white dwarf progenitor mass range .",
    "it is possible that the stars from the high mass peak of such an imf would not contribute to chemical enrichment due to the formation of black holes , thus making such an imf effectively favour white dwarf progenitors .",
    "this pop  iii imf is expected to apply to the first generation of halo stars - the generation which would manifest itself _ now in the population of putative high - proper motion stellar halo wds .",
    "such studies remain , however , highly uncertain .",
    "our motivation for invoking the wdimf remains the macho observations and the necessity for invoking such an imf in order for these observations to be explained by a large population of white dwarf stars populating the halo .",
    "in addition to the wdimf and simf possibilities , in what follows we will also consider a variable imf in which stars formed from the low ( high ) metallicity gas are distributed following the adoption of the wdimf ( simf ) .",
    "one can anticipate that while the wdimf phase will invariably lead to high c / o and n / o ratios ( as discussed by gm97 ) , the subsequent simf phase can ameliorate this effect .",
    "this variable imf scenario was not considered by gm97 . _",
    "_    the currently favoured hierarchical clustering scenario of galaxy formation postulates that star formation progresses through the on - going accretion of galactic building blocks . within this framework ,",
    "highly inhomogeneous chemical evolution occurs ; the assumption of homogeneous closed - box models for the milky way s evolution ( as was admittedly adopted by gm97 ) are no longer suitable .",
    "the early phases of galaxy formation demand a chemo - dynamical approach , one which we adopt here explicitly within the context of the wd - dominated imf hypothesis . in",
    "what follows , we examine the ability of metallicity - dependent variable imfs to resolve the apparent contradiction between a significantly wd - heavy galactic halo and the c / o and n / o abundance patterns of halo stars . to achieve this ,",
    "we perform numerical simulations which calculate self - consistently the chemical and dynamical evolution of a milky way - like galaxy .    in section  2 , we describe our numerical methods , concentrating upon the code itself and our treatments of star formation , imfs , and energy feedback to the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "section  3 presents the results of our simulations in terms of resulting white dwarf halo densities , and galactic chemical evolution of carbon , nitrogen , and oxygen .",
    "the implications for a wd - dominated galactic dark matter halo are described in section  4 .",
    "our simulations were performed using a modified version of the software package described by kawata ( 1999 , 2001 ) .",
    "an overview of the code is provided here along with the relevant modifications made for the current study - the reader is referred to kawata ( 1999 , 2001 ) for all other details .",
    "our code is based upon the hernquist & katz 1989 and katz , weinberg & hernquist 1996 treesph , combining a tree algorithm ( barnes & hut 1986 ) with smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) ( lucy 1977 ; gingold & monaghan 1977 ) for the computation of gravitational forces and numerical hydrodynamics respectively .",
    "this three - dimensional code is fully lagrangian , with individual smoothing lengths and time steps making it highly adaptive in space and time .",
    "it includes a self - consistent treatment of physical processes governing galaxy formation , including self - gravity , hydrodynamics , radiative cooling , star formation , supernovae feedback , and metal enrichment .",
    "we employ metallicity - dependent gas cooling rates derived from mappings  iii ( sutherland & dopita 1993 ) ; their implementation is described by kawata & gibson ( 2003 ) .",
    "star formation prescriptions similar to those of katz ( 1992 ) and katz , weinberg & hernquist ( 1996 ) were employed .",

    "the gas velocity field is convergent : @xmath12 .",
    "our adopted star formation law is written @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the star formation rate ( sfr ) .",
    "equation  [ sfr ] corresponds to a schmidt law in which the sfr is proportional to @xmath15 .",
    "the dynamical timescale of the gas is given by @xmath16 ; in regions eligible for star formation , this dynamical timescale is generally longer than the cooling timescale .",
    "star formation efficiency is parameterised by the dimensionless parameter @xmath17 , which , after kawata ( 1999 , 2001 ) , was set to @xmath18 .",
    "equation  [ sfr ] implies that the probability , p@xmath19 , with which one gas particle entirely transforms into a star particle during a discrete time step , @xmath20 , is p@xmath21 .",
    "this avoids an intolerably large number of star particles of different masses being formed .",
    "the newly created star particle behaves as a collisionless particle .",
    "initial mass functions    in our treesph simulations , `` stars '' are represented as particles with a typical mass of order @xmath22m@xmath1 ; the relative number distribution of stellar masses within a `` particle '' is governed by the assumed initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "fundamental to our modeling is the adoption of the chabrier et  al .",
    "( 1996 ) white dwarf progenitor - dominated imf ( wdimf ) .",
    "we represent this imf by a truncated power - law of the form @xmath23 for which we use @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 .",
    "the peak of this wdimf occurs at @xmath27m@xmath1 , favouring the production of wd progenitors .    the canonical salpeter ( 1955 ) imf ( simf ) is used to describe the local stellar mass function ( by number ) and is written @xmath28 with @xmath29=1.35 .",
    "the simf ( solid line ) and wdimf ( dashed line ) are shown in figure  1 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath30 in equations  [ wdimf ] and [ simf ] is determined by normalising the respective imfs over the mass range 0.1@xmath31@xmath32/m@xmath1@xmath3140.0 .",
    "we will explore simulations in which the adopted imf is invariant in space and time ( and governed by either the wdimf or simf functions ) , as well as metallicity - dependent models ( in which star formation in regions where the gas metallicity is less than 5% solar is governed by the wdimf form , with the simf form applying otherwise ) .",
    "[ fig1 ]    we will compare the results of our simulations using these very different imf assumptions in terms of their chemical evolution properties , and contrast their inherent inhomogeneous nature with the original homogeneous models of gm97 .",
    "each imf assumption also leads to very different outcomes for the halo and disk wd densities , an issue we return to in section  3 .",
    "type  ii supernovae ( sneii ) are assumed to be the end result for all stars of mass @xmath32@xmath3310m@xmath1 .",
    "these massive stars explode within the simulation time step in which they are born , and so the instantaneous recycling approximation ( for the nucleosynthetic products associated with these stars ) applies .",
    "sneii release thermal and mechanical energy to the surrounding interstellar medium , in addition to their stellar yields ; we assume that each supernova releases @xmath34erg of thermal energy . for sneii ,",
    "the metallicity - dependant stellar yields of woosley & weaver ( 1995 ) are adopted .    for low- and intermediate - mass stars",
    ", we use the stellar yields of van  den  hoek & groenwegen ( 1997 ) .",
    "the lifetimes of these stars are significantly longer than the time steps of our simulations , and so the instantaneous recycling approximation is relaxed ; we assume that recycling from intermediate mass stars occurs after a fixed time delay .",
    "weighting by the imf slope , over the range 1@xmath31@xmath32/m@xmath1@xmath318 , the typical mass is @xmath32m@xmath1 ( for both the wdimf and simf ) ; we therefore adopt a delay of 1  gyr , corresponding to the main sequence lifetime of a 2m@xmath1 star ( schaller et  al .",
    "1992 ) .    for the current study",
    ", we ignore the effects of type  ia supernovae . as noted by gm97",
    ", these supernovae do not produce significant amounts of carbon , nitrogen , or oxygen ( relative to sneii ) , elements which form the basis of the analysis which follows .",
    "the mass , energy and heavy elements are smoothed over the neighbouring gas particles using the sph smoothing algorithm .",
    "for example , in the timestep in which mass is released from a star particle due to a type ii supernova explosion , the increment of the mass of the @xmath35-th neighbour particle is @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 is an sph kernal .",
    "[ yields ]    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      in this section , we examine the constraints set by the observartions of chemicals , in particular carbon , nitrogen and oxygen , set on the viability of our three models .",
    "we are especially interested in whether the variable imf of model  3 alleviates the problem of carbon and nitrogen overproduction relative to oxygen , as originally pointed out by gm97 .",
    "figure  7 shows the [ c / o ] and [ n / o ] abundance ratios as a function of global metallicity [ z]=log@xmath39(z / z@xmath40 ) ] for the stellar particles in the solar neighbourhood for all models , to compare with observations of solar neighbourhood stars .",
    "we define the solar nighbourhood as the region bounded by 4@xmath4110  kpc and @xmath421.5  kpc . carbon and nitrogen are highlighted due to the fact that their dominant nucleosynthesis sites are the intermediate mass white dwarf precursors under discussion here .",
    "we constrain our models with the observed abundance distribution pattern of carbon , nitrogen , and oxygen seen in the metal poor population  ii stars , which are dominated by halo stars ( hashed regions in each panel of figure  7 ) .",
    "we remind the reader that type  ia supernovae have not been included in the present anaylysis .",
    "as such , we take the total metallicity [ z ] to act as a proxy for [ fe / h ] , without violating the validity of the simulations ( since type  ia supernovae are not critical contributors to the galaxy s cno abundances ) .",
    "the points in figure  7 correspond to those simulated star particles which reside , at the present - day , in the solar neighbourhood defined above - no kinematical ( i.e. , disk versus halo kinematics ) cut was applied as the observational data we compare to , is of solar neighbourhood stars without kinematic selection .",
    "the solid lines in each panel of figure  7 correspond to the mass - weighted mean stellar metallicity of the simulation . for model  1",
    ", we can see that there is essentially no variation in [ c , n / o ] for halo metallicities ( i.e. , [ z]@xmath0@xmath431 ) , with the simulated halo particles occupying the same parameter space as the data ( hashed regions ) . as the chemical enrichment from low- and intermediate- mass stars begins to become important ,",
    "[ c , n / o ] approaches the solar ratio and the dispersion increases , both being in keeping with the observations of the solar neighbourhood distributions ( timmes et  al .",
    "not surprisingly , this is consistent with the conventional picture in which the simf ( model  1 ) scenario is assumed to hold .",
    "model  2 ( middle panels of figure  7 ) shows the clear signature of carbon and nitrogen overproduction . as the intermediate mass stars responsible for the nucleosynthesis of ( the bulk of ) these elements pass through the asymptotic giant branch , the resulting [ c / o ] and [ n / o ] quickly exceeds the halo observational constraints by more than two orders of magnitude - an invariant wdimf model",
    "can not be made consistent with the data ( this is consistent with the analytical chemical evolution analysis of gm97 ) .",
    "the lower panels of figure  7 demonstrate that model  3 ( the variable imf ) does mitigate ( somewhat ) the overproduction of carbon and nitrogen at low metallicities .",
    "below [ z]@xmath44@xmath431 , model  3 traces model  2 ; above [ z]@xmath44@xmath431 , the salpeter ( 1955 ) component of the variable imf begins to dominate star formation ( and its associated element production ) , suppressing the extreme overproduction inherent in the invariant wdimf model  2 . ultimately , [ c / o ] and [ n / o ] approach that of the model  1 ( simf ) , reaching the scaled - solar ratio at [ z]@xmath30 . while a definite improvement ( in the sense that the factor of @xmath6100 overproduction in carbon and nitrogen seen in model  2 no longer exists ) , model  3 still leads to a factor of @xmath35 - 10 carbon and nitrogen excess ( with respect to oxygen ) at metallicities in the range @xmath432.5@xmath0[z]@xmath0@xmath431 .",
    "a couple of features of the plots in figure  7 are worth further comment here . in models 2 and 3",
    "we notice a number of stars in a horizontal line with values of [ c , n / o]@xmath3 0 .",
    "these stars were formed from gas polluted by massive stars , prior to intermediate star s yields being ejected .",
    "reference table  1 which shows that the wdimf massive star s ( @xmath45m@xmath1 ) integrated yields have [ c , n / o]@xmath3 solar .",
    "also note the limit of [ c , n / o ] of @xmath46 in all models in figure  7 which comes from the low metalicity intermediate mass stellar yields , as seen in table  2 .",
    "ascribing the detection of the 13 - 17 microlensing events seen toward the lmc to an intervening halo white dwarf ( wd ) population implies that perhaps 20%@xmath4330% of galaxy s dark matter is tied up in these stellar remnants ( alcock et  al . 2000 ) .",
    "this would correspond to a local wd halo number density of @xmath32@xmath410@xmath47pc@xmath47 .",
    "in contrast , gould et  al .",
    "( 1998 ) concluded , using subdwarf star counts and an assumed salpeter ( 1955 ) imf , that the local spheroid wd number density was 2.2@xmath410@xmath48pc@xmath47 ( i.e. , two orders of magnitude smaller ) .",
    "more recently , the high proper motion survey for cool white dwarfs conducted by oppenheimer et  al .",

    "wds are actually members of the halo , as opposed to the thick disk , is still a matter of debate ( e.g. gyuk & gates 1999 ; reid & sahu 2001 ) , although hansen ( 2001 ) argues that if the halo is dominated by wds , @xmath380% of these remnants lie beyond the detection limit of oppenheimer et  al . -",
    "i.e. , the wd - dominated halo issue has not yet been resolved and future ( deeper ) surveys must be undertaken before the final word on the subject can be made .",
    "regardless of the current observational constraints , it is recognised that populating the galactic halo with a dynamically - dominant wd component demands a significant modification to the underlying stellar imf ( e.g. gm97 ) .",
    "a chabrier ( 1996)-style imf , peaked in the wd progenitor range , is one such possibility , although this imf can not apply at all times since we observe today a fairly conventional salpeter ( 1955 ) or scalo ( 1986)-like distribution .",
    "metallicity may be the controlling factor in `` switching '' from the chabrier - like to salpeter - like imf ; a physical motivation for such a switch can be found in the studies of yoshii & saio ( 1987 ) , nakamura & umemura ( 2001 ) , bromm et  al .",
    "( 2001 ) and abel , bryan & norman ( 1999 , 2001 ) .",
    "making our imf dependent upon metallicity in our variable model is further motivated by the different mdf s of the galactic disk and halo regions ; if one wishes to populate only the halo with large numbers of white dwarf stars , then it is the low metalicity stars which should have an imf biased toward white dwarf progenitor stars .",
    "this appears necessary in order to explain macho observations by invoking white dwarf stars .",
    "our chemodynamical simulations employing a hybrid imf ( wd - dominated at metallicities [ z]@xmath0@xmath431.3 , and `` conventional '' at metallicities [ z]@xmath6@xmath431.3 ) are successful in increasing the galactic halo wd fraction ( in comparison with models employing a salpeter 1955 imf alone ) without violating present - day observable local carbon and nitrogen pop ii abundance constraints .",
    "these results are caused by low metallicity stars preferentially being found in the halo region as seen in figure  6 .",
    "low metallicity stars are formed before and during the major star formation epoch caused by the collapse of the whole system .",
    "these stars are scattered by violent relaxation .",
    "later , gas polluted by past star formation accretes smoothly and the metal rich disk component developes .",
    "this picture is consistent with previous chemo - dynamical studies of a milky way like galaxy ( steinmetz & muller 1995 ; white et al .",
    "2000 ; bekki & chiba 2001 ; abadi et  al . 2003 ) .",
    "this metallicity segregation is what allows our simple variable imf to populate the low metallicity stars of the halo with a large number of white dwarf stars .",
    "the discrepency between observed metallicity distributions of galactic halo and disk stars mean that our scheme of varying the imf according to metallicity would seem appropriate , indeed necessary , if we are to explain macho events by white dwarfs .",
    "that said , our best models were only capable of increasing the number of halo white dwarfs by a factor of 3 - 4 ( table  4 ) before violating the constraints of an overproduction of carbon and nitrogen compared to oxygen .",
    "this factor is between our simulated models , and unlike the absolute densities is not significantly affected by the region selected as defining the halo .",
    "how does this factor relate to observed white dwarf densities ?",
    "the gould et  al .",
    "value of 2.2@xmath50 pc@xmath47 assumes a salpeter imf ; increasing this by a factor of 3 - 4 corresponds to halo wd mass fractions in of @xmath31 - 2% - halo wd mass fractions beyond this are not supported by our simulations .",
    "attempts to increase the halo wd fraction further necessitate significant revision to our fairly conventional star formation formalism .",
    "we attempted to force the halo wd issue by increasing substantially the efficiency of star formation ( @xmath17 in equation  [ sfr ] ) in low - metallicity star - forming regions .",
    "we also tried decreasing the density threshold for star formation @xmath51 in these same regions . ] . both _",
    "ad hoc revisions introduced moderate increases in the halo wd fraction .",
    "for example , increasing @xmath17 by a factor of ten and decreasing @xmath51 by the same factor of ten , led to a halo wd density of 1.3@xmath410@xmath49pc@xmath47 ( c.f .",
    "model  3 entries of table  4 ) .",
    "while such a density would be consistent a factor of @xmath52 incease of halo white dwarf densities over the salpeter imf model , this `` extreme '' model suffers from the same carbon and nitrogen overproduction which plagued model  2 ( section  3 ) , mitigating its usefulness . _",
    "the hybrid imf preferred here varies in a very simple manner and that the 0.05z@xmath1 transition metallicity for changing from the wdimf to simf regime was a somewhat arbitrary choice .",
    "we found that adopting a lower metallicity for the transition ( e.g. 0.01z@xmath1 ) does diminish the carbon and nitrogen overproduction , but at the expense of reducing the halo wd mass fraction .",
    "thus , it becomes clear that a trade off exists between increased white dwarf halo densities and the overproduction of carbon and nitrogen compared to oxygen ; any significant increases in white dwarf numbers are accompanied by worsening of the overproduction of carbon and nitrogen , as well as contamination of the disk with an unacceptable number of white dwarf stars .",
    "our simulations suggest that attempts at increasing the number of halo white dwarf beyond that obtained in model  2 ( @xmath31 - 2% of the halo , by mass ) will violate these constraints .    our best hybrid imf model , while an improvement over purely wd - dominated imf models , still overproduces stars with supersolar [ c / o ] and [ n / o ] ratios in the metallicity range @xmath53[z]@xmath0@xmath431 .",
    "modifications to the star formation efficiency and threshold were incapable of eliminating this overproduction .",
    "as such , more extreme scenarios may need to be invoked in order to suppress the formation of these stars .",
    "an early galactic wind , fine - tuned such that the carbon and nitrogen ejecta from the wdimf component of our hybrid imf is removed from the system before being incorporated into the stars which ultimately form the population  ii halo of the milky way , is one such potential modification ( e.g. fields et  al .",
    "1997 ; gm97 ) .",
    "although we do take into account the energy feedback of sne ( section  2.1.3 ) , our favoured model  3 does not develop a galactic wind .",
    "that said , the exact efficiency of sne feedback is uncertain ; in a future work , we will explore more extreme feedback scenarios , in an attempt to suppress excess carbon and nitrogen overproduction at early times . at that time",
    ", we will also include the effects of type  ia sne , although we remind the reader that this inclusion has little impact upon the results shown here ( as sne  ia are negligible contributors to the carbon , nitrogen , and oxygen yields discussed here - see section  2.1.3 ) .",
    "we have undertaken galactic chemodynamical simulations of the formation and evolution of the milky way , exploring a region of parameter space designed to test the hypothesis that the galaxy s halo has a significant dynamical white dwarf component ( perhaps as high as 30% by mass ) .",
    "this is the first numerical examination of the wd - dominated hypothesis , and a natural extension to the earlier semi - analytical investigation of gibson & mould ( 1997 ) .",
    "consistent with gibson & mould , we have found that carbon and nitrogen overproduction ( by factors in excess of 100 ) are endemic to purely wd - dominated imf models .",
    "for the first time , we have shown that a hybrid wd - dominated / salpeter style imf with a transition metallicity between the two of z@xmath54z@xmath1 can lead to a milky way model which is marginally consistent with virtually all available present - day constraints .",
    "a mild overproduction of carbon and nitrogen remains ( although this overproduction is reduced by more than an order of magnitude ) ; an early galactic wind may alleviate this overproduction , an hypothesis we will explore in a future study .",
    "our best model can lead to a halo wd mass fraction a factor of @xmath55 greater than expected with a more conventional imf ( corresponding to @xmath56 of the mass of the halo ) , but values in excess of this can not be accommodated within our chemodynamical framework .",

    "<S> observational evidence has suggested the possibility of a galactic halo which is dominated by white dwarfs ( wds ) . </S>",
    "<S> while debate continues concerning the interpretation of this evidence , it is clear that an initial mass function ( imf ) biased heavily toward wd precursors ( 1@xmath0m / m@xmath1@xmath08 ) , at least in the early universe , would be necessary in generating such a halo . within the framework of homogeneous , closed - box models of galaxy formation , such biased imfs lead to an unavoidable overproduction of carbon and nitrogen relative to oxygen ( as measured against the abundance patterns in the oldest stars of the milky way ) . using a three - dimensional tree n - body smoothed particle hydrodynamics code , we study the dynamics and chemical evolution of a galaxy with different imfs . both invariant and metallicity - dependent imfs </S>",
    "<S> are considered . </S>",
    "<S> our variable imf model invokes a wd - precursor - dominated imf for metallicities less than 5% solar ( primarily the galactic halo ) , and the canonical salpeter imf otherwise ( primarily the disk ) . </S>",
    "<S> halo wd density distributions and c , n / o abundance patterns are presented . while galactic haloes comprised of @xmath25% ( by mass ) of wds are not supported by our simulations , mass fractions of @xmath31 - 2% can not be ruled out . </S>",
    "<S> this conclusion is consistent with the present - day observational constraints . </S>"
