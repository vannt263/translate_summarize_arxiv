    "<S> we investigate the dynamics of a three - state stochastic lattice gas , consisting of holes and two oppositely  charged \" species of particles , under the influence of an  electric \" field , at zero total charge . interacting only through an excluded volume constraint </S>",

    "<S> using a combination of langevin equations and monte carlo simulations , we study the steady - state structure factors in the _ disordered _ phase where homogeneous configurations are stable against small harmonic perturbations . </S>",

    "<S> long range spatial correlations are absent in general . </S>",
    "<S> their presence is a typical signal that the system is at a singular point . on the other hand , for systems in non - equilibrium steady states , </S>",
    "<S> long range correlations are often observed@xcite . with conserved dynamics </S>",
    "<S> they generically arise if the system has strong spatial anisotropies and lacks detailed balance . </S>",
    "<S> a good example is the driven ising lattice gas @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the role of the drive ( `` external field '' ) is to bias hopping rates along a particular direction on the lattice . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to many other unexpected features such as non - hamiltonian fixed points controlling the critical behavior@xcite , the system exhibits long range spatial correlations _ at all temperatures _ above criticality , as a result of the breakdown of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( fdt ) . in momentum space </S>",
    "<S> , this appears as a discontinuity singularity of the structure factor at the origin @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> one can generalize the model of ref @xcite in a fashion similar to the one leading to the ising model to spin-1 @xcite or potts @xcite models , by considering more than one species of particles . to start with </S>",
    "<S> , we have two species of particles ( referred as @xmath0 s and @xmath1 s ) driven in opposite directions and holes ( empty sites ) . to keep the model simple , however , we may neglect the usual ising nearest neighbor interaction and keep `` only '' the excluded volume constraint and the bias . this multi - species model , in both one and two dimensions , has been thoroughly investigated @xcite . in the simplest scenario charge ( @xmath2 ) exchange is not allowed . </S>",
    "<S> monte carlo simulations @xcite in two dimensions and mean - field studies @xcite show that there is a transition , controlled by particle density and drive , from a spatially homogeneous ( disordered ) phase to a charge segregated one , where the excluded volume constraint leads to the mutual blocking of particles . </S>",
    "<S> if we soften the excluded volume constraint  by allowing exchange between nearest neighbor , oppositely charged particles on a much slower time scale than the particle hole exchange  the above transition still survives @xcite . in the _ disordered _ phase , </S>",
    "<S> these two versions behave in much the same way . </S>",
    "<S> thus , for simplicity , we will study only the case _ without _ charge exchange in this paper and focus on the spatial correlations and structure factors .    </S>",
    "<S> we consider a two dimensional fully periodic lattice with @xmath3 sites , each of which can be empty or occupied by a single particle . </S>",
    "<S> since we have two species we need two occupation variables @xmath4 and @xmath5 , with @xmath6 being 0 or 1 , depending on whether a positive or negative particle is present at site @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> although we refer to these particles as `` charged '' , they do not interact via the coulomb potential . </S>",
    "<S> instead , they respond to an external , uniform electric field @xmath8 , directed along the @xmath9-axis . we restrict ourselves to zero total charge , i.e. @xmath10=0 $ ] . in the absence of the drive the dynamics </S>",
    "<S> does not distinguish between the different species : both types hop randomly to nearest neighbor empty sites , with a rate @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> the electric field introduces a bias into these rates in such a way that jumps _ against _ the force will be exponentially suppressed . during one monte carlo step @xmath12 </S>",
    "<S> nearest neighbor bonds are picked randomly . </S>",
    "<S> if a particle - hole pair is encountered , an exchange takes place with probability @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the charge of the particle and @xmath15 is the change of the @xmath16 coordinate of the particle due to the jump .    for our simulations </S>",
    "<S> , we set @xmath17 . using @xmath18 and @xmath19 lattices </S>",
    "<S> , we initialized the system with random configurations of various particle densities and carried out runs ranging from @xmath20 to @xmath21 mcs . after allowing 62500 mcs for the system to settle into a steady state , we measured the fourier transform of @xmath22 every @xmath23 mcs . </S>",
    "<S> the structure factors are then constructed from averages of these measurements , according to @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 *  * . </S>",
    "<S> note that @xmath27 is the fourier transform of the usual _ equal - time _ </S>",
    "<S> correlation function @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , if @xmath29 is even in @xmath7 , @xmath30 will be real . </S>",
    "<S> equivalently , an imaginary part of @xmath31 corresponds to the part of @xmath29 which is odd in @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> due to charge symmetry , we expect @xmath32 . clearly , both must be even in @xmath7 , so that the associated @xmath30 s are real . on other hand , due to the drive , we have    @xmath33    so that @xmath34 may have an imaginary part ( which must be odd in @xmath8 ) . finally , @xmath35 is just a mathematical identity .    in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] , we present the results for the three independent @xmath30 s found in the larger system . before discussing the data in detail , we will first present the theoretical framework within which they can be understood . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we will illustrate the emergence of discontinuity singularities in the structure factors at @xmath36 , and their consequences for long - range correlations in real space . </S>",
    "<S> this will then be followed by a comparison between our theoretical predictions and the simulation results .    since our interest lies in the behavior at large distances ( or small @xmath37 ) , the simplest approach relies on continuum field theory . </S>",
    "<S> starting from the dynamics at the microscopic level , specified by the above rates and the associated master equation , there are several ways to arrive at a coarse - grained description , in terms of equations of motions for the local @xmath38-dependent densities . </S>",
    "<S> the most systematic one is to perform an @xmath39-expansion @xcite , where one splits the particle densities describing a block b ( size @xmath39 ) , around point @xmath40 , into a macroscopic part ( @xmath41 ) and a fluctuating one ( @xmath42 ) : @xmath43 for generality , we consider the d - dimensional case when @xmath44 is directed along the electric field and @xmath45 is in the d-1 dimensional subspace , perpendicular to the field . after taking the continuum limit </S>",
    "<S> the result for the macroscopic part is a set of mean - field equations of motions for the slowly varying local densities : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the diffusion - matrix . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath48 is diagonal and isotropic in the d-1 dimensional subspace , thus characterized by a number @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath50 is the asymmetric gradient operator , namely for any two functions @xmath51 and @xmath52 , @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath54 is the coarse - grained bias and @xmath55 is the unit vector along the @xmath16 direction .    </S>",
    "<S> since ( [ meaf ] ) is a continuity equation , it trivially admits @xmath56-independent solutions which are homogeneous in space : @xmath57 . for simplicity , and to ease comparison with simulation data , we have chosen equal densities for both species . at the mean - field level , this solution describes the steady state . </S>",
    "<S> the correlations of interest are then associated with @xmath42 , the scaled deviations ( [ omega ] ) from the mean - field steady state .    </S>",
    "<S> returning to the @xmath39-expansion , the result for the fluctuating part , at lowest order , is a fokker - planck equation . for our purposes , </S>",
    "<S> the equivalent langevin equation is more transparent . at this order , </S>",
    "<S> its deterministic part is linear and the ( conserved ) noise is gaussian . </S>",
    "<S> focusing on the fluctuations about the homogeneous phase , the result is : @xmath58 where @xmath59 here , @xmath60 are gaussian , white noise terms , satisfying : @xmath61 @xmath62 is the noise matrix : @xmath63 similar to @xmath48 , @xmath64 is diagonal and isotropic in the d-1 dimensional subspace , characterized by a number @xmath65 . in equilibrium systems </S>",
    "<S> , the fdt guarantees @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , in the absence of the drive , we would have @xmath67 here . </S>",
    "<S> however , when driven , the proportionality is not expected to hold , in that the diffusion and noise matrices would be renormalized differently by the drive @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> this is certainly the situation in the driven single species case@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we point out that @xmath69 and @xmath70 are uncorrelated , due to the fact that charge exchange is not allowed .    to find the correlations and structure factors from eqns . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ rsl]-[rsnoise ] ) , we introduce the fourier components for the fluctuations : @xmath71 and similar ones for the noise , so that @xmath72   \\label{ksnoise } \\\\ </S>",

    "<S> their correlations are just the _ dynamic _ structure factors , easily obtained from ( [ ksnoise ] ) and ( [ inv_ksl ] ) . from the definition : @xmath78   \\label{dyn_str_def}\\ ] ] we find the two independent @xmath30 s : @xmath79 where @xmath80 to find the equal - time correlations , we need the steady state structure factors , which can be obtained from ( [ dyn_str ] ) by an integration over @xmath81 . </S>",
    "<S> the results are : @xmath82 note that @xmath83 is positive definite , while we need to require @xmath84 for all @xmath85 to assure that the system is within the linear stability boundary . finally , using ( [ lin_def ] ) , eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ steady_str ] ) take the explicit form : @xmath86    a key feature of these structure factors is that , unlike in equilibrium cases , all are singular at the origin . for both @xmath87 and @xmath88 , this singularity is exhibited as a discontinuity , i.e. , @xmath89 in particular , @xmath90 \\frac{(1 - 3\\bar{\\varrho})^2}{(1-\\bar{% \\varrho})^2(1 - 4\\bar{\\varrho } ) }   \\label{s++_disc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath91 \\frac{(1 - 3% \\bar{\\varrho})}{(1-\\bar{\\varrho})(1 - 4\\bar{\\varrho } ) }   \\ ; . </S>",
    "<S> \\label{s+-_disc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in general these ratios are not unity . </S>",
    "<S> note that these singularities come not only from the generic fdt - breaking property , namely @xmath92 , but also from the specifics of this particular driven system . </S>",
    "<S> this second factor is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath93 reaching @xmath94 at @xmath93 = 1/4 . </S>",
    "<S> this divergence is related to the instability of the homogeneous phase , as we will see below .    on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , though@xmath95 vanishes for @xmath96 in any direction , discontinuities are present in higher derivatives . in configuration space , </S>",
    "<S> these singularities translate into power law decays of the equal - time correlation functions @xmath97 , which is , thanks to translational invariance , independent of @xmath98 . </S>",
    "<S> more precisely , it is just    @xmath99    to carry out the transform , it is convenient define a `` mass '' @xmath100 via @xmath101 to keep the system in the homogeneous phase , it is sufficient to impose @xmath102 . </S>",
    "<S> we should note that , in the limit @xmath103 , the mean - field phase boundary is given precisely by @xmath104 . </S>",
    "<S> otherwise , for _ finite _ @xmath105 , the system does not reach the stability limit until @xmath93 equals @xmath106 ^2\\right ) $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> further , it is convenient to rescale the lengths @xmath107 so that @xmath108 becomes the unit matrix . in terms of these rescaled @xmath109 </S>",
    "<S> let us define @xmath110 . </S>",
    "<S> also , we should rescale the elements of the noise matrix , to keep the notation simple : @xmath111 now , the transform can be carried out exactly . </S>",
    "<S> the results are : @xmath112 where @xmath113 are the parts of @xmath114 even or odd in @xmath115 , being the transforms of the real and imaginary parts of @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> the full correlation is , of course , @xmath116 this decomposition simply reflects the symmetries of the system in the presence of the field ( [ g+- ] ) . in eqns . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ g++]-[g2 ] ) , @xmath117 is the modified bessel function and , provided @xmath118 , the @xmath119 s and @xmath120 s are positive constants depending on @xmath121 and @xmath93 .    </S>",
    "<S> the first terms in ( [ g++ ] ) and ( [ g1 ] ) , being proportional to @xmath122 , are the well known power law decays @xcite due to `` fdt - violation '' @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath120-terms in ( [ g++]-[g2 ] ) produce an exponential decay for large @xmath123 , _ except _ along the field . </S>",
    "<S> this can be easily deduced , since , for large @xmath124 , the exponentials of the hyperbolic and bessel functions cancel . without presenting the detailed asymptotic expansions of ( [ g++]-[g2 ] ) </S>",
    "<S> , we illustrate the main results as @xmath125 .    for @xmath126 : @xmath127 + ... \\ ; ,   \\label{gen_power}\\ ] ] where the @xmath128 represent exponential , short - ranged tails . in this form , </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize the three key ingredients of the `` fdt - violating '' power law decays , namely , the dependence on @xmath129 ( or @xmath130 ) , the dipole amplitude and , of course , the @xmath131 . </S>",
    "<S> also , note that the part of @xmath114 odd in @xmath16 is seen to be only short - ranged .    </S>",
    "<S> the more interesting limit is for @xmath132 . </S>",
    "<S> then , in addition to the above power laws , we have another power : @xmath133 . for all @xmath134 , this power will dominate over the `` fdt - violating '' component . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , if we study @xmath135 systems , even the _ next _ leading term in the asymptotic expansion of k@xmath136 will be more important than @xmath131 . for typical simulations in @xmath137 </S>",
    "<S> , we would write : @xmath138 note that , to emphasize the sign of the amplitude of the leading power , we included explicit factors of @xmath139 , so that the proportionality constants in ( [ new power ] ) are positive . in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> the spatial correlations are dominated by the expected @xmath131 power law , except along the field , where a novel @xmath140 decay takes over . </S>",
    "<S> this new power law comes from the coupling between the two species as a result of the excluded volume constraint and the opposite bias .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , let us turn to comparisons with simulation results . </S>",
    "<S> typically , we find that power law tails are difficult to observe , in relatively small systems such as ours . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we focus on the structure factors . deferring details to a later publication , we point out some general characteristics . on the whole , the agreement between data ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] ) and ( [ exp_str ] ) is quite impressive , considering that the latter is only the `` first approximation '' . </S>",
    "<S> for example ,    * in all three cases , @xmath141 is independent of @xmath142 ; * the value where @xmath143 vanishes agrees well with the theoretically predicted @xmath144 ; * similarly , the ratio @xmath145 is found to be quite close to the expected value of @xmath146 .    </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , the data and ( [ exp_str ] ) do not agree so well for , e.g. , @xmath147 . </S>",
    "<S> we suspect the origin of this discrepancy to be the following . given that our data were collected quite close to a second order transition ( so as to observe relatively large fluctuations ) , we should expect the longitudinal component of the two - point function to suffer considerable renormalization . </S>",
    "<S> certainly , this is the case in the proto model @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it would be very interesting to take into account finite size corrections , to compute these effects in field theory , and to carry out extensive runs for detailed comparison .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have examined the spatial correlations and the structure factors in a simple model of biased diffusion of two species . using both simulation and analytic techniques </S>",
    "<S> , we find the expected power law decay , @xmath148 , typical of non - equilibrium steady states of a system with anisotropy and subjected to a conservation law . in addition , a novel power , @xmath149 , is found for correlations along the bias . </S>",
    "<S> the general agreement between simulations and a simple mean - field theory is surprisingly good , while we await a better theory in order to make detailed quantitative comparisons . </S>"
