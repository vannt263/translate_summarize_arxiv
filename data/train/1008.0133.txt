    "the right one is called _ jump point _ and the left one is _",
    "reverse jump point_. consider a strip @xmath19 in the phase space that contains @xmath8 and bounded by vertical circles that pass through the fold point ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : convex ] ) .",

    "denote the point of the intersection by @xmath27 .",
    "this trajectory is _ canard _ , because it has a segment which is close to the repelling part of the slow curve .",
