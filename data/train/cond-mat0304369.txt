    "we find that indeed protein crystals are attracted by oppositely charged surfaces and repelled by surfaces with charges of the same sign . in itself",
    "this is hardly surprising but with quite simple calculations we quantify this attraction and repulsion .",
    "we show that easily accessible surface charge densities of the opposite sign to that of the protein molecules , are able to greatly favour heterogeneous nucleation at the surface by reducing the free energy of a nucleus at the surface by several @xmath0 per protein molecule at the surface .",
    "controlled heterogeneous nucleation is vital to the production of protein crystals , which are required for structure determination via x - ray crystallography .    at a first - order phase transition , such as",
    "the crystallisation of a protein from solution , the transition starts with nucleation @xcite .",
    "protein crystallisation is the `` main bottleneck '' @xcite in the determination of the three - dimensional structure of proteins . determining this structure is crucial for understanding what a protein does and how it does it .",
    "protein crystallographers wish to : i ) _ induce _ nucleation in the relatively weakly supersaturated solutions , within which protein crystals grow slowly and so incorporate few defects , and ii ) _ control _ heterogeneous nucleation , in particular have nucleation occurring only at specific locations on a surface .",
    "if crystals only nucleate on widely separated patches on a surface then the growth of one crystal will not interfere with and limit the growth of another crystal .    see for example refs .",

    "@xcite for experimental work on patterned surfaces , which shows that protein crystals can be made to grow preferentially on specified patches of a surface . in refs .",
    "@xcite a patterned surface is used in which patches of the surface are one form of doped si and the rest is a different form .",
    "the protein nucleates preferentially on one of these forms and so by controlling where this form is found in the pattern , the crystals can be made to nucleate and grow far from each other , facilitating the formation of large crystals . here",
    "we show that a pattern of two different surface types of opposite charges can produce sufficiently large differences in surface free energy to make heterogeneous nucleation much easier on one surface than on the other .",
    "we note that here we only consider the effects of charge interactions , screened by a 1:1 electrolyte .",
    "other interactions , such as short - range specific interactions between the protein molecules and surface are known to be important , see the review of ostuni _ et al .",
    "when these interactions are important , our calculations , which neglect them , will only yield estimates of the _ variation _ with 1:1 salt concentration , of the interaction free energy of a protein crystal or crystalline nucleus with a surface . however",
    ", experimental systems do exist with high , variable charges and highly hydrophilic surfaces .",
    "these highly hydrophilic surfaces will have only weak non - electrostatic interactions with the proteins , they also has the advantage of minimising the problem of protein denaturation .",
    "one example is a highly charged self - assembled monolayer , such as has been shown to adsorb polyelectrolytes @xcite , another is a membrane containing charged lipids @xcite .",
    "both of these systems should be well described by the theory presented here .",
    "there is a great deal of work on the association of proteins and dna with oppositely charged lipid membranes , refs .",
    "@xcite are just two examples of a large literature .",
    "as far as the author is aware , there has been no experimental study of adsorption of protein on a highly charged , highly hydrophilic , self - assembled monolayer , but such a system would offer the opportunity to study the effect of electrostatics with minimal interference from other interactions .",
    "this is true both for the adsorption of single proteins and of protein crystals .",
    "our calculations will all be for infinite planar interfaces , despite the fact that our primary interest is in the nuclei of protein crystals against charged surfaces , not bulk crystals against surfaces .",
    "although , nuclei are small , 10s of protein molecules , the part of the free energy which scales with the contact area between the nucleus and the surface will still dominate the edge contribution , as the debye length is typically a few nms at most .",
    "thus , we consider only the dominant surface term , considering sub - dominant terms within simple theories of simple generic models is not useful .",
    "we will also leave consideration of defects in the surface to later work .    in the next section",
    "we calculate the electrostatic contributions to the surface free energy .",
    "the third section includes example results and a discussion and the last section is a conclusion .",
    "here we calculate the electrical double layer contributions to the interfacial free energies of solid  salt - solution , solid  protein - crystal and solution  protein - crystal interfaces .",
    "the calculation for the solution  protein - crystal interface is just a repeat of that done in ref .",
    "@xcite and so will not be described in detail .",
    "we will use the model of ref .",
    "@xcite for the protein crystal and solution , along with a simple model of a charged solid surface .",
    "as we are interested in interfacial free energies it is most convenient to work at constant chemical potential of the salt , and so the appropriate free energy is the grand potential @xmath1 .",
    "we will split this grand potential into the part due to the charges on the surface and on the protein molecules , together with the salt and counter ions , @xmath2 , and another part which includes the rest of the interactions , @xmath3 , @xmath4 @xmath3 includes effects such as the dispersion interactions between the protein molecules and the surface , and any short - range interactions between the surfaces of the proteins and the solid surface .",
    "we will not calculate @xmath3 , and so will only be able to estimate the absolute values of the interfacial free energies , when @xmath3 is much smaller than @xmath2 , for example with highly charged , highly hydrophilic , surfaces , and highly charged proteins .",
    "however , if we assume that @xmath3 is weakly dependent on the salt concentration , and that the charges on the surface can be varied without varying @xmath3 significantly , our results will describe the variation in the interfacial free energies with surface charge density and the salt concentration .    rather than considering a specific protein crystal ,",
    "we take over the jellium concept from the theory of metals to make a general estimate of the effect of salt on the interfacial tension .",
    "we replace the detailed charge density due to the protein molecules by a uniform background charge density @xmath5 , cut off abruptly at the interface . in ref .",
    "@xcite , sear and warren did so for the protein - crystal  salt - solution interface , and this followed on from the work of warren @xcite on the bulk phase behaviour . here",
    "when we calculate the interfacial free energy for a protein crystal at the surface , we will assume the protein crystal is flush against the surface and so the charge density is uniform right up to the surface .",
    "our model of the charged surface of the substrate is that of an infinite charged plane at a fixed charge per unit area @xmath6 .",
    "the solution outside the crystal is taken to be sufficiently dilute that we can neglect any protein molecules in it and treat it as a salt solution at a concentration @xmath7 . for definiteness",
    "we take the protein to be positively charged so the counterions are negative and the coions are positive ; both are monovalent .",
    "the surface is in the @xmath8 plane at @xmath9 , with the solid in the @xmath10 half - space and either a salt solution or a protein crystal in the @xmath11 half - space .",
    "we will use the same notation as in ref .",
    "@xcite , so we work in units where @xmath12 . in these units ,",

    "we assume a constant value of @xmath16 , and ignore dielectric effects .",
    "the counterion and coion densities are @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively . in the bulk salt solution , both tend to the salt concentration @xmath7 , and inside the protein crystal @xmath21 .",

    "the electrostatic potential then satisfies the poisson - boltzmann  equation , @xmath30 where @xmath31 for our assumption of a planar surface in the @xmath9 @xmath8 plane , with a fixed charge per unit area @xmath6 , the boundary condition on @xmath26 at @xmath9 , is that the electric field at the surface @xmath32 the other boundary condition is that @xmath33 , @xmath34 .",

    "the surface area of the protein crystal per lysozyme molecule is taken to be @xmath79nm@xmath80 @xcite . for proteins such as lysozyme which have a significant net charge we would expect our predictions to be approximately as accurate as those of earlier predictions of this theory , i.e. , predicting the trends correctly but giving numbers which are a factor of 2 or more out .",
    "we expect our predictions to be unreliable if the net charge is small , then the interaction between the dipole moment of the protein and the surface may dominate , or if the charge is distributed on the surface in a way which is highly inhomogeneous .",
    "if the charge density within the volume within a few debye lengths of the surface differs greatly from @xmath81 , then our assumption of uniform charge density due to the protein will be poor .",

    "@xcite for further discussion of the assumption that the protein crystal can be modeled by a step - function charge density .    in fig .",
    "[ d ] we see that for lysozyme and solid surfaces with @xmath82nm@xmath83 , the free energy change of bringing the protein crystal into contact with the solid is substantial unless the salt concentration is around @xmath84 . even at a salt concentration of @xmath84 ,",
    "the free energy change is close to @xmath85 per lysozyme molecule at the surface of the protein in contact with the solid surface .",
    "whereas at salt concentrations of about @xmath86 and lower the free energy change is of order @xmath87 per lysozyme molecule .",
    "note however , that we have assumed that the protein crystal is in a salt solution , i.e. , a solution with negligible amounts of protein in it .",
    "decreasing the salt concentration increases the solubility of lysozyme @xcite , and so this assumption will tend to worsen as the salt concentration drops @xcite .",
    "the salt is not only changing the interaction between the protein and the surface but also the interaction in between protein molecules and this needs to be borne in mind .    in fig .",
    "[ dsig ] we see that at high salt concentrations , @xmath84 , the free energy change on bringing a crystal into contact with the surface is never more than a couple of @xmath0 , even for quite highly charged surfaces",
    ". however , for more modest salt concentrations of @xmath86 , rather large free energy decreases per protein molecule are easily obtained at modest charges per unit area on the surface . also , note that @xmath88 is slightly positive for an uncharged surface .",
    "this is due to the fact that the electrical double layer contribution to the protein - crystal  salt - solution interface is negative , eq .",
    "( [ xtalsol ] ) , and this contribution is lost when the protein crystal is brought into contact with the surface .",

    "( [ delin ] ) significantly overestimates the magnitude of @xmath88 at high surface charges . however , eq .

    "( [ delin ] ) predicts @xmath95 .",
    "we have used an existing @xcite generic model of a protein crystal to estimate the electrostatic contribution @xmath88 to the free energy change when a protein crystal is brought into contact with a surface with a fixed charge density @xmath6 . unsurprisingly ,",
    "the free energy change is negative for a surface with a charge opposite in sign to that on the protein molecule , and positive if the surface has a charge with the same sign .",
    "we quantified this and found that very reasonable charge densities , of 1 elementary charge per nm@xmath80 or less , were sufficient to achieve free energy changes per protein molecule at the surface of several @xmath0 or more , provided the salt concentration was less than around @xmath84 .",
    "the electrostatic contribution to the free energy is the energy associated with the electrostatic interactions in between the surface , protein molecules , and salt and counterions , and the translational entropy of the salt and counterions .",
    "typically , there will also be non - electrostatic interactions of the proteins with the surface , particularly if the surface is at least moderately hydrophobic .",
    "then the proteins may even unfold resulting in irreversible adsorption .",
    "thus , our results will be relevant only to those surfaces which are sufficiently hydrophilic that the proteins interact only weakly with the surface and do not unfold .",
    "however , obtaining such surfaces is relatively straightforward via the use of self - assembled monolayers @xcite .",
    "our model of the protein is a very simple one , appropriate for proteins with reasonably large net charges , so that the terms we calculate should be dominant , and where this charge is distributed so that the charge density facing the surface is neither much higher nor much lower than the average charge density on the surface of the protein .",
    "perhaps the most important reason for considering protein crystals at surfaces is interest in their heterogeneous nucleation .",
    "protein crystals nucleate at surfaces and so without an understanding of crystallites at surfaces we can not hope to understand how the crystals actually form . crystallising proteins is essential for the determination of their all - important three - dimensional structure via x - ray crystallography @xcite .",
    "heterogeneous nucleation is an activated process @xcite and so proceeds at a rate which scales as @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is the height of the free energy barrier which must be overcome .",
    "typical sizes of the critical nuclei in nucleation are a few 10s of protein molecules , and so one face of a crystalline nucleus has perhaps 10 , or a few less , protein molecules .",
    "the critical nucleus is that at the top of the barrier , the nucleus which requires a free energy @xmath97 to create it @xcite .",
    "thus , the variation in @xmath97 with @xmath88 , will be approximately @xmath98 . from figs .",
    "[ d ] and [ dsig ] , we see that this may easily be 10s of @xmath0 , causing increases or decreases in the rate of heterogeneous nucleation of many orders of magnitude .",
    "the barrier to nucleation may be lowered by 10s of @xmath0 , inducing nucleation in solutions which would otherwise be metastable , or it may be raised by 10s of @xmath0 preventing nucleation from occurring on one part of the surface .",
    "the former is required if a surface is to be used as a nucleant : a surface which triggers nucleation @xcite .",
    "the latter is required for spatial control of heterogeneous nucleation @xcite .    finally , we consider wetting by the crystalline phase of the surface  salt - solution interface . at coexistence , for a bulk solution phase in contact with the surface , a direct surface  salt - solution interface is not the only possibility .",
    "it is possible for a slab of the protein crystal to be interposed between the surface and the solution phase .",
    "the direct surface ",
    "salt - solution interface is then replaced by by a surface  protein - crystal interface plus solution  protein - crystal interface . the protein crystal is said to have wet the surface  salt - solution interface .",
    "wetting occurs at equilibrium whenever it lowers the free energy @xcite .",
    "denoting the full interfacial tensions of the surface  salt - solution , surface  protein - crystal and solution  protein - crystal interfaces by @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 , respectively , we have that the free energy change on interposing a slab of protein crystal between the surface and the solution is @xmath102 .",
    "note that here the interfacial tension of the solution  protein - crystal interface appears with a positive sign whereas it appears with a negative sign in the definition of @xmath88 , eq .",
    "( [ delta ] ) .",
    "when a layer of the protein crystal is created so is a solution  protein - crystal interface , whereas when an existing protein crystal surrounded by solution is brought into contact with the surface a solution  protein - crystal interface is destroyed .",
    "determining the sign of @xmath102 is not possible without determining both the electrostatic and non - electrostatic contributions to all three interfacial tensions .",
    "however , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the interfacial tension @xmath101 was estimated to be a few @xmath0 per area of a protein molecule , i.e. , @xmath103 .",

    "for highly charged surfaces , @xmath6 of order 1nm@xmath83 , and low salt concentrations , this inequality is easily satisfied .",
    "if the protein crystal wets the surface  salt - solution interface , then assuming that the layer of protein crystal can itself nucleate on the surface it will do so and the bulk protein crystal can grow from this layer at the surface . then the barrier to crystallisation will be close to zero and the protein will readily crystallise from solution @xcite .",
