    "this paper has roughly a threefold aim .",
    "the first is to prove the following inequality for estimating the number of points of complete intersections ( in particular , hypersurfaces ) which may possibly be singular : @xmath0 ( cf .",
    "theorem [ mainthm ] ) . here , @xmath1 denotes a complete intersection in @xmath2 defined over the finite field @xmath3 of @xmath4 elements , @xmath5 the dimension of @xmath1 , @xmath6 the multidegree of @xmath1 and @xmath7 an integer such that @xmath8 . note that @xmath9 .",
    "moreover , @xmath10 denotes the number of points of @xmath11 , viz . , @xmath12 , and for any nonnegative integers @xmath13 and @xmath14 with @xmath15 ,",
    "we denote by @xmath16 the primitive @xmath13-th betti number of a _",
    "nonsingular _ complete intersection in @xmath17 of dimension @xmath13 .",
    "this primitive betti number is explicitly given by the formula @xmath18 where @xmath19 denotes the set of @xmath20-tuples @xmath21 of positive integers such that @xmath22 and @xmath23 for any such @xmath20-tuple @xmath24 .",
    "if we let @xmath25 and @xmath26 , then it will be seen that @xmath27",
    "lastly , @xmath28 is a constant which is independent of @xmath4 ( or of @xmath29 )",
    ". we can take @xmath30 if @xmath31 , _",
    "i.e. _ , if @xmath1 is nonsingular , and in general , we have @xmath32 where @xmath33 is as above .",
    "the inequalities , and are proved in sections [ nbptsci ] , [ centralbetti ] and [ traceform ] respectively .",
    "our second aim is to discuss and elucidate a number of results related to the _ conjectural statements _ of lang and weil @xcite .",
    "these concern the connections between the various tale cohomology spaces ( especially , the first and the penultimate ) and the picard ( or the albanese ) varieties of normal projective varieties defined over @xmath34 .",
    "for example , if @xmath1 is any projective variety of dimension @xmath5 , and @xmath35 is the characteristic polynomial of the piece of maximal filtration of @xmath36 and @xmath37 is the characteristic polynomial of the albanese - weil variety @xmath38 of @xmath1 , then we show that @xmath39 where @xmath40 . in particular , the `` @xmath41-th virtual betti number '' of @xmath1",
    "is twice the dimension of @xmath38 , and is independent of @xmath42 .",
    "these results are discussed in details in sections [ penultimate ] , [ relationalbanese ] and [ langweilconj ] .",
    "the third aim is to prove an effective version of the lang - weil inequality @xcite .",
    "recall that the lang - weil inequality states that if @xmath43 is any projective variety defined over @xmath34 of dimension @xmath5 and degree @xmath44 , then with @xmath45 as above , we have @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a constant depending only on @xmath48 , @xmath5 and @xmath44 .",
    "the said effective version consists in providing computable bounds for the constant @xmath47 appearing in .",
    "for example , if @xmath1 is defined by the vanishing of @xmath49 homogeneous polynomials in @xmath50 variables of degrees @xmath51 and @xmath52 , then we show that the constant @xmath47 in may be chosen such that @xmath53 we also prove an analogue of the lang - weil inequality for affine varieties .",
    "these inequalities are proved in section [ lwineq ] .",
    "lastly , in section [ algsets ] , we describe some old , hitherto unpublished , results concerning certain general bounds for the number of points of projective algebraic sets , as well as a conjecture related to the same",
    ".    we shall now describe briefly the background to these results and some applications . for a more leisurely description of the background and an expository account of the main results of this paper",
    ", we refer to @xcite .    in @xcite , weil proved a bound for the number of points of a nonsingular curve over a finite field @xmath34 , namely that it differs from @xmath54 by at most @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the genus of the curve . in @xcite , he formulated the conjectures about the number of points of varieties of arbitrary dimension . before these conjectures became theorems , lang and weil @xcite proved the inequality in 1954 . in 1974 , deligne @xcite succeeded in completing the proof of weil conjectures by establishing the so called riemann hypothesis for nonsingular varieties of any dimension . using this and the lefschetz trace formula , also conjectured by weil , and proved by grothendieck , he obtained a sharp inequality for the number of points of a nonsingular complete intersection .",
    "later , in 1991 , hooley @xcite and katz @xcite proved that if @xmath1 is a complete intersection with a singular locus of dimension @xmath7 , then @xmath57 the inequality which we prove here may be regarded as a more precise version of this estimate . in effect , we explicitly obtain the coefficient of the first term and a computable bound for the coefficient of the second term in the asymptotic expansion of the difference @xmath58 . when @xmath59 , _ i.e. _ , when @xmath1 is nonsingular , then is precisely the inequality proved by deligne @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , if @xmath1 is assumed normal , then we can take @xmath60 and implies the lang - weil inequality for normal complete intersections .",
    "the explicit formula is a consequence of the work of hirzebruch @xcite and jouanolou @xcite on nonsingular complete intersections , while the computable bound is obtained using some work of katz @xcite on the sums of betti numbers .",
    "corollaries of include some results of shparlinski and skorobogatov @xcite for complete intersections with at most isolated singularities as well as some results of aubry and perret @xcite for singular curves .",
    "it may be remarked that the recent article @xcite of katz has a more general purpose than that of section [ nbptsci ] of this article , since it provides bounds for exponential sums defined over singular varieties .",
    "however , as far as the number of points of singular varieties are concerned , the bounds presented here are more precise than those obtained by specializing the results of @xcite .    after proving",
    ", lang and weil @xcite observed that if @xmath61 is an algebraic function field of dimension @xmath5 over @xmath62 , then there is a constant @xmath63 for which holds with @xmath64 replaced by @xmath63 , for any model @xmath1 of @xmath65 , and moreover , the smallest such constant @xmath63 is a birational invariant .",
    "they also noted that the zeros and poles of the zeta function @xmath66 in the open disc @xmath67 are birational invariants , and that in the smaller disc @xmath68 there is exactly one pole of order @xmath69 at @xmath70 .",
    "then they wrote : _ about the behaviour of @xmath66 for @xmath71 , we can only make the following conjectural statements , which complement the conjectures of weil_. these statements are to the effect that when @xmath1 is complete and nonsingular , the quotient @xmath72 has no zeros or poles inside @xmath67 and at least one pole on @xmath73 , where @xmath74 denotes the picard variety of @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , with @xmath65 and @xmath63 as above , we have @xmath75 .",
    "lang and weil @xcite proved that these statements are valid in the case of complete nonsingular curves , using the riemann hypothesis for curves over finite fields .",
    "as remarked by bombieri and sperber @xcite , some of the results conjectured by lang and weil are apparently known to the experts but one is unable to locate formal proofs in the literature .",
    "some confusion is also added by the fact that there are , in fact , two notions of the picard variety of a projective variety @xmath1 .",
    "these notions differ when @xmath1 is singular and for one of them , the analogue of is false .",
    "moreover , the proof in @xcite of a part of the proposition on p. 133 appears to be incomplete ( in dimensions @xmath76 ) . in view of this",
    ", we describe in some details results such as which together with the grothendieck - lefschetz trace formula , prove the conjecture of lang and weil , as well as several related results .",
    "these include the abovementioned proposition of bombieri and sperber @xcite , which is proved here using a different method .",
    "an equality such as can also be of interest as a `` motivic '' result in the sense indicated in an early letter of grothendieck @xcite .    for the lang - weil inequality ,",
    "it is natural to try to give a proof using the trace formula .",
    "some auxiliary results are still needed but many of these are obtained in the course of proving and .",
    "this , then , leads to the ` effective version ' and an affine analogue .",
    "the latter yields , for example , a version of a lower bound due to schmidt @xcite for the number of points on affine hypersurfaces . for varieties of small codimension , we obtain an improved version of the lang - weil inequality .",
    "we first settle notations and terminology .",
    "we also state some preliminary results , and the proofs are omitted .",
