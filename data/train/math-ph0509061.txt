    "we are concerned here with proving localization properties of multi - dimensional continuum random schrdinger operators in the fluctuation boundary regime .",
    "such results were first found via the method of multiscale analysis , which had been developed in the 80s to handle lattice models and was later extended to the continuum ( for a rather complete history and list of references on multiscale analysis see @xcite and for some of the more recent developments @xcite ) .",
    "later , the fractional moment method was developed @xcite as an alternative approach to the same problem , also initially for lattice models .",
    "it leads to a stronger form of dynamical localization than multiscale analysis ( see @xcite ) and has provided much shorter and more transparent proofs in the lattice case , for example @xcite .",
    "it was recently shown in @xcite that all the main features of the fractional moment approach also apply to continuum random schrdinger operators .",
    "this extension required substantial new input from operator theory and harmonic analysis .",
    "the paper @xcite provides a framework of necessary and sufficient criteria for localization in terms of fractional moment bounds , which can be verified for a rather broad range of regimes .",
    "one of our goals here is to complement the general framework from @xcite by focusing exclusively on presenting a short and self - contained proof of localization properties via fractional moments for one specific regime , where the technical effort remains minimal .",
    "for this we pick a fairly general setting we label the _ fluctuation boundary regime_. this is described by a random schrdinger operator of anderson - type in @xmath0 , where our approach allows for quite arbitrary background potentials and geometries of the random impurities , provided the ground state energy is induced by rare events ( fluctuations ) and therefore sensitive to changes in the random parameters . the goal is to prove localization in the vicinity of the bottom of the spectrum . of course",
    ", various versions of the fluctuation boundary regime have been studied in many works and we borrowed the term from @xcite .",
    "another motivation for our work is that we want to extend the fractional moment method to situations where the random potential does not satisfy a covering condition , i.e.  where the individual impurity potentials have small supports which do not cover all of @xmath1 .",
    "this condition , which was required for the technical approach to the continuum found in @xcite , is not natural in the fluctuation boundary regime and should not be needed there as has already been verified via multiscale analysis .",
    "particularly interesting examples are random surface potentials which act in a small portion of space only .",
    "nevertheless , they lead to a fluctuation boundary by creating new `` surface spectrum '' below the `` bulk spectrum '' .    in our main result ,",
    "theorem  [ t1 ] below , the fluctuation boundary regime will be described in form of an abstract condition . for random surface potentials , which will be discussed as an application",
    ", this condition follows in an appropriate setting from a result proven in @xcite in order to derive lifshits tails . another application concerns models with additional random displacements as were originally studied in @xcite .    let us confess that we require absolutely continuous distribution of random couplings .",
    "while it might be possible to relax this to hlder continuous distribution ( as has been done in the lattice case , e.g.  @xcite ) , the fractional moment method is so far less flexible in that respect than the multiscale technique . in particular , see the variant of multiscale analysis adapted to bernoulli - anderson models recently developed in @xcite and an application of similar ideas to poisson models announced in @xcite .",
    "let us now describe our results in more detail after introducing some notation : on @xmath1 we often consider the supremum norm @xmath2 and write @xmath3 for the @xmath4-dimensional cube with sidelength @xmath5 centered at @xmath6 .",
    "for an open set @xmath7 we denote the restriction of the schrdinger operator @xmath8 to @xmath9 with dirichlet boundary conditions by @xmath10 . in our results",
    "we assume @xmath11 and rely upon the following assumptions , which guarantee self - adjointness and lower semi - boundedness of all the schrdinger operators appearing in this paper :    1 .",
    "the background potential @xmath12 is real - valued , @xmath13 .",
    "2 .   the set @xmath14 , where the random impurities are located , is uniformly discrete , i.e. , @xmath15 .",
    "3 .   the random couplings @xmath16 , @xmath17 , are independent random variables supported in @xmath18 $ ] for some @xmath19 and with absolutely continuous distribution of bounded density @xmath20 with a uniform bound @xmath21 . + the single site potentials @xmath22 , @xmath17 satisfy @xmath23 for all @xmath24 with @xmath25 independent of @xmath26 . @xmath27 and",
    "@xmath28    the most important condition expresses the fact that the ground state energy comes from those realizations of the potential that vanish on large sets :    1 .",

    "+ assume that @xmath32 is a _ fluctuation boundary _ in the sense that a.   @xmath33 , and b.   there is @xmath34 and @xmath35 such that for @xmath36 , all @xmath37 and @xmath38 @xmath39       \\not=\\emptyset\\bigr)\\leq l^{-m_d } .\\ ] ]    by @xmath40 we denote the characteristic function of the unit cube centered at @xmath6 . in the following it",
    "is understood that @xmath41 if @xmath42 or @xmath43 have measure zero .",
    "our main result is    [ t1 ] let @xmath11 and assume _",
    "( a1)-(a4)_. then there exist @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 such that for @xmath48 , all open sets @xmath49 and @xmath50 , @xmath51    exponential decay of fractional moments of the resolvent as described by implies spectral and dynamical localization in the following sense :    [ t2 ] let @xmath11 , assume _ ( a1)-(a4 ) _ and let @xmath52 be given as in theorem  [ t1 ] .",
    "then :    1 .   for all open sets",
    "@xmath53 the spectrum of @xmath10 in @xmath52 is almost surely pure point with exponentially decaying eigenfunctions .",
    "2 .   there are @xmath54 and @xmath47 such that for all @xmath55 and open @xmath53 , @xmath56    where the supremum is taken over all borel measurable functions @xmath57 which satisfy @xmath58 pointwise and @xmath59 is the spectral projection for @xmath10 onto @xmath52 .",
    "dynamical localization should be considered as the special case @xmath60 in ( b ) , with the supremum taken over @xmath61 .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ t1 ] is given in section  [ sec : mainproofs ] .",
    "this will be done by a self - contained presentation of a new version of the continuum fractional moment method . while we use many of the same ideas as @xcite , due to the lack of a covering condition",
    "we can not rely any more on the concept of  averaging over local environments \" , heavily exploited in @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that , in some sense , we instead use a global averaging procedure .",
    "technically , this actually leads to some simplifications compared to the method in @xcite , as repeated commutator arguments can be replaced by simpler iterated resolvent identities .",
    "we also mention that exponential decay in will follow from smallness of the fractional moments at a suitable initial length scale ( the localization length ) via an abstract contraction property .    as technical tools we need combes - thomas bounds ( in operator norm as well as in hilbert - schmidt norm ) and a weak-@xmath62-type bound for the boundary values of resolvents of maximally dissipative operators , which is based on results from @xcite and was also central to the argument in @xcite .",
    "we collect these tools in an appendix .",
    "that theorem  [ t2 ] follows from theorem  [ t1 ] was essentially shown in @xcite , section  2 . in section  [ sec : prooft2 ] below we will briefly discuss the changes which arise due to our somewhat different set - up .",
    "in particular , the argument in @xcite for proving uses the covering condition @xmath63 in one occasion .",
    "but this is easily circumvented .    in sections  [ sec : surface ] and",
    "[ sec : displacement ] we apply our main result to concrete models by verifying assumption ( a4 ) for these models . in section  [ sec : surface ]",
    "we consider anderson - type random potentials supported in the vicinity of a lower - dimensional surface .",
    "the `` usual '' fully stationary anderson model is considered in section  [ sec : displacement ] .",
    "the fact that we do nt have to assume a covering condition leads to high flexibility in the geometry of the random scatterers . we could use this to go for far reaching generalizations of anderson models . instead , we restrict ourselves to the treatment of additional random displacements as was done in @xcite .",
    "we could have extended theorem  [ t1 ] in at least two different ways , but refrained from doing so to keep the proofs as transparent as possible :    a.   the restriction to @xmath11 is not necessary .",
    "we use it because in this case the abstract fractional moment bound in corollary  [ cor : fracmoments ] is more directly applicable to our proof of theorem  [ t1 ] than in higher dimension ( which technically can be traced back to the fact that @xmath64 is a hilbert - schmidt operator only for @xmath11 ) . in higher dimension",
    "more iterations of resolvent identities would be needed to yield the hilbert - schmidt multipliers required by corollary  [ cor : fracmoments ] , leading to more involved summations in the arguments of section  [ sec : mainproofs ] .",
    "b.   instead of bounded @xmath65 we can work with relatively @xmath66-bounded @xmath65 , i.e.  allow for suitable @xmath67-type singularities in the single site potentials .",
    "in the course of our proofs they could be  absorbed \" into resolvents using standard arguments from relative perturbation theory .    in principle , our arguments can also be used to prove localization at fluctuation type band edges more general than the bottom of the spectrum without using a covering condition as in @xcite . but this would require to be much more specific with settings and assumptions and , in particular , with the geometry of the impurity set .",
    "inconvenience would also arise from having to work with boundary conditions other than dirichlet .",
    "we mention that the applications in section  [ sec : surface ] improve the results on continuum random surface potentials of @xcite , obtained through the use of multiscale analysis :    a.   the exponentially decaying correlations of the time evolution , shown as a special case of theorem [ t2](b ) , are stronger than the dynamical bounds which follow from multiscale analysis .",
    "b.   due to the use of the recent result of @xcite on lifshitz tails for surface potentials , we do not need a condition on the smallness of the distribution of the @xmath16 near the minimum of their support as in @xcite , a progress that had been achieved in @xcite . c.   we can allow for more flexibility concerning the geometry of the scatterers .",
    "of course , due to using fractional moments we can not include single site measures as singular as the ones considered in @xcite but instead have to assume absolute continuity of the @xmath68 .",
    "this section is entirely devoted to the proof of theorem 1 . for a convenient normalization write @xmath69^{{\\mathcal{i}}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and denote the product measure @xmath70 on @xmath71 by @xmath72 .",
    "we write @xmath73 note that @xmath74 and that @xmath75 fixing an open set @xmath76 we write @xmath77 whenever @xmath78 . since @xmath79 due to our choice of dirichlet boundary conditions , and @xmath80 we know that @xmath81 .    the resolvent equation yields @xmath82 an identity that will be used over and again .",
    "the other workhorse result is the following averaging estimate , that follows from corollary [ cor : fracmoments ] in the appendix below , taking into account the uniform boundedness of the densities @xmath20 .",
    "[ workhorse ] for all @xmath83 there is @xmath84 such that @xmath85    as a warm - up , we prove boundedness of fractional moments :    [ l3 ] let @xmath86 , @xmath87 $ ] and @xmath88 .",
    "then @xmath89    we use above and write , suppressing the superscript @xmath90 and the subscript @xmath91 mostly : @xmath92 the first two terms on the r.h.s .  of this equation obey an exponential bound due to the combes - thomas estimate , see subsection [ ct ] below : @xmath93 and @xmath94 with @xmath95 and @xmath96 depending on @xmath97 only . in the last estimate we have used that @xmath98 is uniformly discrete .    for the third term , expand @xmath99 and use the boundedness of the @xmath100 and the fact that @xmath101 to estimate @xmath102 we now fix @xmath103 and use the workhorse lemma  [ workhorse ] to conclude @xmath104 and since @xmath105 where @xmath106 majorizes the size of the support of @xmath22 according to assumption ( a3 ) .    note that here and in the following we use the convention that @xmath107 , @xmath84 , etc .  denote constants that only depend on non - crucial quantities and may change from line to line . in particular , the constants are independent of @xmath108 and the random background .",
    "now , we can sum up the last terms and get the assertion .",
    "\\(i ) in this proof it is still quite easy to see how to extend to arbitrary dimension through iterations of the resolvent identity .",
    "it will be harder to keep track of this later .",
    "\\(ii ) note that due to the @xmath109-summations , averaging over the @xmath16 is required for all @xmath26 , i.e. , is global . in @xcite , due to the covering condition , an argument is provided that only requires averaging over local environments of @xmath6 and @xmath110 and proves lemma  [ l3 ] for arbitrary finite intervals @xmath87 $ ] , i.e.  without requiring @xmath86 .",
    "\\(iii ) the above proof shows that also holds in hs - norm , but this will not be used below .",
    "we will now start an iterative procedure that will show exponential decay of @xmath111 in @xmath112 for energies sufficiently close to @xmath32 .",
    "clearly , it suffices to consider @xmath113 . in view of the preceding lemma",
    "the following quantity is finite : @xmath114 moreover , we should actually keep in mind the dependence on the interval @xmath115 $ ] . in fact , @xmath97 will later be chosen small enough .    in order to use",
    "that @xmath32 appears rarely as an eigenvalue for boxes of side length @xmath116 we exploit the resolvent identity and what is sometimes called the simon - lieb inequality in a way visualized in figure 1 !        consider @xmath117 furthermore , with @xmath106 as in assumption ( a3 ) , define @xmath118 the geometry is chosen in such a way that @xmath119 and @xmath120 are stochastically independent . for @xmath119 we can use the fluctuation boundary assumption to get small fractional moments and the right size of @xmath116 will be adjusted .",
    "but all that later ...    thus , by the simon - lieb inequality ( e.g.  @xcite , sect .",
    "2.5 ) @xmath121 where @xmath122 only depends on @xmath123 and the interval @xmath52 .",
    "the basic idea for proving exponential decay of @xmath124 is to establish a recurrence inequality for energies sufficiently close to @xmath32 .",
    "this recurrence inequality is described in proposition [ master ] below and allows to apply a discrete gronwall - type argument found in lemma [ lem.estimate.operator.a ] below . to this end",
    "we exploit smallness of fractional moments of the first factor on the r.h.s .  of ( sli ) for energies close to @xmath32 and sufficiently large , but fixed , @xmath116 : this will follow from ( a4)(ii ) as is presented in the following lemma [ startup ] .",
    "fractional moments of the second factor are bounded due to lemma  [ l3 ] ( up to a polynomial factor in @xmath116 ) .",
    "finally , we use the third factor to start an iteration ( with @xmath6 replaced by sites @xmath125 covering the layer @xmath126 ) . by construction , the first and third factor on the r.h.s .  of ( sli )",
    "are probabilistically independent .",
    "unfortunately , the second factor introduces a correlation which prevents us from simply factoring the expectation . we will rely on a version of the re - sampling procedure developed in @xcite to solve this problem .",
    "moreover , we will not use lemma  [ l3 ] , but apply lemma  [ workhorse ] directly to bound certain conditional expectations .",
