    "there are many epidemiological studies of risk factors of alzheimer disease or dementia , or the decrease of cognitive function in the elderly . as has been identified by @xcite , one of the major methodological problem",
    "is that of selection of the sample due to death .",
    "it is not obvious to treat this problem , which may also arise in other studies of severe diseases , like cancer for instance .",
    "we aim to investigate the issue of estimating the effect of a factor ( which may be time - dependent ) on a physiological state which can be binary ( such as dementia ) or quantitative ( such as cognitive ability ) in situations where the death risk is not negligible ( such as in ageing studies ) .",
    "we have in mind situations where longitudinal observations of events and/or quantitative markers can be recorded .",
    "the question is not a pure statistical one , but the challenge is rather to formulate the problem correctly so as to identify the relevant parameters .",
    "a similar problem was tackled by @xcite using potential outcomes and principal stratification ; however the type of observations he considered are not longitudinal and do not allow identifying a dynamic model and do not even allow estimating reliably the estimand he proposed , the survival average causal effect ( sace ) .",
    "this estimand is itself questionable , but it is out of the scope of this paper to discus it .    our approach does not use potential outcomes but is based on the dynamical approach to causality . the dynamical approach to causality",
    "uses the formalism of stochastic processes and the concept of system .",
    "a general definition of causal influence was given by @xcite ; @xcite developed this idea for marked point processes models and proposed influence graphs ; a particular approach called `` dynamic path analysis '' has been developed by @xcite .",
    "these authors do not have specifically studied the special role of death .",
    "the core of the approach presented here is essentially based on @xcite , and has been further developed in @xcite , @xcite and in @xcite ( chapter 9 ) , and we call it `` the stochastic system approach to causality '' .",
    "it allows mixing counting processes and diffusion precesses , thus allowing us to develop insight in the so - called joint models where both events and markers are modelled .",
    "the concept of system is nearly absent in biostatistics but is ubiquitous in physics",
    ". a philosophical analysis of the concept of `` system '' can be found in @xcite .",
    "our schedule is : ( i ) to represent the problem in the stochastic system formalism ; ( ii ) to identify the relevant parameters to estimate when the risk of death is not negligible ; ( iii ) to look at the conditions on the observation scheme , including latent processes , for estimating these parameters ; ( iv ) to investigate in which cases some parameters can be estimated in a smaller system where `` death '' is not represented .",
    "an originality of the presentation is that it unifies problems involving a binary state ( usually treated by multistate models ) and a quantitative state ( usually treated as `` repeated measures '' ) .",
    "we also present a general observation scheme which unifies observations of binary and quantitative processes including latent processes .",
    "we recall the background of the dynamic approach to causality in section [ sec : background - dyncausal ] .",
    "in section [ ageing studies ] we present some general considerations for taking death into account . in section [ sec : observation ] we study general schemes of observations and criteria for ignorability of these schemes . in section [ effect - on - y ] , we tackle the problem of estimating the effect of a factor on a physiological state , in presence of death , examining when the mechanism leading to missing data is ignorable . in section [ sec : incompletesystem ]",
    "we examine what can be done with an incomplete system not including death . in section [ sec : illustration ] , we develop the example of cognitive ability in the elderly . section [ sec : conclusion ] concludes .",
    "the starting point of the dynamical approach is to consider that we have a better representation of phenomena and their causal relationship by using stochastic processes than by using ordinary random variables , and most of the time it is better to consider that these processes live in continuous time .",
    "this leads us to a change of paradigm . in the conventional paradigm ,",
    "we observe random variables and we search for a model that will fit them ; in the stochastic system paradigm , a system is represented by a stochastic process and we collect observations of the state of this system which will allow estimating the law of the process .",
    "thus , it is useful to distinguish between the model for the system and the model for the observation , a classical distinction in automatics @xcite but not in biostatistics . to illustrate this different point of view and the further introduced concepts",
    ", we will take a toy example .",
    "consider first that we are interested in a physiological quantity , say blood pressure , and how it varies with age .",
    "we have observations @xmath2 of blood pressure at age @xmath3 and we may model them by @xmath4 with some assumptions on the distribution of the @xmath5 s : this is the conventional approach . in the stochastic system approach we have a model for the system which is a model for a stochastic process @xmath0 in continuous time ; this gives justice to the fact that there is some blood pressure at any time .",
    "the law of the process can be given by its doob - meyer decomposition and a possible model is : @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is a brownian motion or in differential form : @xmath8 which makes the dynamics of the process more visible .",
    "observations @xmath2 are then noisy observations of the process @xmath0 at time @xmath3 : @xmath9 .",
    "one advantage of this formulation is that it gives a natural correlation structure for the @xmath2 s .",
    "suppose now that we are interested in the occurrence of a type of event , say dementia .",
    "rather than modeling the distribution of the time of occurrence of the event , we can find the law of a counting process @xmath1 .",
    "the law of @xmath1 can be given by its doob - meyer decomposition @xmath10 , or its differential form @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the compensator and @xmath13 the intensity of the process .",
    "we may have continuous - time observations ( with possibly right - censoring ) or discrete - time observations ( inducing interval - censoring ) .    for complex problems , we need multivariate processes . in the case",
    "there are several types of events , this could be represented by a multistate process ; we will prefer a representation by a multivariate counting process because we are interested in the relation between the different components of the multivariate stochastic process .",
    "for instance we are interested in both dementia and death ; the interaction of these two events can be represented by an illness - death model .",
    "alternatively , this can be represented by a bivariate counting process ( see section [ pos - systems ] ) .",
    "the multivariate stochastic process @xmath14 can have components which are counting processes and others which are diffusion processes , allowing us to analyze the relationships between events and continuous phenomena , both typically evolving in continuous time .",
    "suppose we are interested in both blood pressure and dementia , we can consider a joint model for the two processes : @xmath15 ; @xmath11 .",
    "the intensity of @xmath1 can be modeled as : @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the baseline hazard function .",
    "we may have discrete - time observations of @xmath0 and continuous- or discrete - time observations of @xmath1 , allowing estimating the parameters of this model .",
    "given a system represented by a multivariate stochastic process @xmath14 , a criterion of local independence is defined in terms of measurability of processes involved in the doob - meyer representation @xcite .",
    "@xcite called the local independence wcli ( weak local conditional independence ) because they also defined a criterion of strong local independence ( scli ) ; when wcli does not hold , there is direct influence , when scli does not hold while wcli holds , there is indirect influence . in short ,",
    "if a component of the stochastic process @xmath18 does not appear in the compensator of the doob - meyer decomposition of @xmath19 we say that @xmath19 is wcli of @xmath18 . in our above example of a joint process @xmath20 we have : @xmath21 where the martingales @xmath22 and @xmath23 are orthogonal .",
    "we see that @xmath24 appears in the intensity of @xmath1 : if @xmath25 , this intensity would not be _ measurable _ in a filtration not including @xmath0 . equivalently we could say that marginally to @xmath0 , @xmath1 does not have the same intensity . on the contrary @xmath1",
    "does not appear in the intensity of @xmath0 : we do not need any information on @xmath1 to know the dynamics of @xmath0 .",
    "we shall say that @xmath0 is wcli of @xmath1 , but that @xmath1 is not wcli of @xmath0 .",
    "conversely , if a component of @xmath14 , @xmath18 , is not wcli of another component , @xmath19 , we say that @xmath19 has a `` direct influence '' on @xmath18 , and we note : @xmath26 . in our example",
    ", we would note @xmath27 and since @xmath0 is wcli of @xmath1 we can also note @xmath28 .",
    "it is important to note that the direct influences depend on both the system @xmath14 and the probability law .",
    "a graph can then be constructed having the components of the stochastic process as nodes and directed edges where there are direct influences .",
    "this is analogous to classical graphical models with the difference that nodes are stochastic processes rather than random variables and the graph may be cyclic ; in particular we may have both @xmath26 and @xmath29 .",
    "an advantage of these process graphs is that they are more concise than the conventional directed acyclic graphs ( dag ) ( based on random variables rather than stochastic processes ) , and also more concise than the graphs for multistate models .",
    "how can the mathematical property of `` direct influence '' between components of a process under a particular probability @xmath30 be used for exploring causality ? answering this question may be possible if we have a definition of `` causal influence . ''",
    "we give a definition based on the concept of `` system '' universally used in physics and in automatics @xcite ; see philosophical aspects in @xcite .",
    "it is postulated that , for a given `` level , '' there exists a sufficiently large system @xmath31 and physical laws allowing to compute the true probability @xmath32 for events of interest .",
    "see a precise definition and examples on gravitation law and mechanistic knowledge in hiv infection in @xcite ( section 3.1 ) .    in our example on dementia we will try to represent all the processes that may influence dementia .",
    "such a system denoted by @xmath31 will be called a `` perfect '' system for dementia .",
    "this allows defining `` causal influences '' .",
    "a direct influence of a process @xmath0 on @xmath1 ( dementia ) in @xmath31 under @xmath32 is called a direct `` causal influence '' . the causal effects ( which are the quantification of causal influences )",
    "can be summarized by different contrasts between the intensities obtained for different values of v.    many issues in causality come from the fact that we generally do not work with @xmath31 but with smaller systems .",
    "if we do not have a perfect system for y , by definition there is a process @xmath33 which influences @xmath1 and which is not included in the system .",
    "then the question is whether it is possible to estimate marginal causal effects of a factor @xmath0 on @xmath1 in this system .",
    "such process @xmath33 is a potential unmeasured confounder @xcite ; it is a confounder for @xmath34 if it influences @xmath0 in the larger system @xmath35 .",
    "if it does not influence @xmath0 , then @xmath14 is a system with no unmeasured confounders for @xmath34 , and marginal causal effects can be estimated .",
    "such systems will be called `` nuc systems for ( v , y ) '' .",
    "see section [ pos - systems ] for an illustration .",
    "in fact , wcli and influences can be defined on a finite horizon , @xmath36 .",
    "it could well be that a process has an influence on another process until a certain time only , or that we are not interested in the possible influence after a certain time .",
    "this horizon can be fixed or random .",
    "a random horizon is particularly interesting when studying the effect of a process which represents a risk factor of a disease , because we are generally not interested in the effect of the disease on the risk factor . as an example , consider a system with two processes @xmath0 and @xmath1 ; @xmath0 could represent systolic blood pressure and @xmath1 dementia ; @xmath0 has a continuous state space , while @xmath1 is a @xmath37 counting process .",
    "epidemiologists are interested in knowing whether high blood pressure is a risk factor of dementia . in general",
    "they are not interested in the effect of dementia on blood pressure , although such an effect is not excluded .",
    "another example would be the relation between tobacco consumption ( @xmath0 ) and lung cancer ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "epidemiologists are interested in the effect of tobacco on cancer .",
    "there may well be an effect of cancer on tobacco consumption since people with cancer are likely to stop smoking , but this is not of primary interest for epidemiologists .",
    "so we are interested in knowing whether @xmath1 is wcli of @xmath0 , on @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the time of occurrence of the event ( dementia or cancer ) .",
    "after @xmath1 has jumped , the intensity is null , so that @xmath0 can not influence @xmath1 after the jump .",
    "if we stop at @xmath39 , there can be no effect of @xmath1 on @xmath0 because on @xmath40 @xmath1 is uniformly zero .",
    "thus , using the random horizon @xmath39 allows focusing on the effect of @xmath0 on @xmath1 ( in our example , of blood pressure on dementia ) .",
    "the case of death is special . in short - term studies or in studies with young subjects , it may not be necessary to model death . in many studies , however , and especially in ageing studies , this is necessary .",
    "death can be modelled by a @xmath37 counting process .",
    "it must be realized that all the other processes are defined for living subjects .",
    "therefore , the maximum horizon for studying wcli is @xmath41 , the time of death .",
    "this is developed in section [ ageing studies ] .",
    "in ageing studies , one of the most important events that we have to consider is death .",
    "this is why the illness - death model is important in such studies , but death should also be taken into account when studying a quantitative marker .",
    "the critical point is that death is not an event which is on the same footing as other events that can happen to subjects .",
    "even if the vital status is part of the state associated to each subject , this part of the state has a very special meaning , in that all the other components of the state are defined only for a living subject .",
    "the consequence is that causal influences must be defined on a maximum horizon @xmath41 , where @xmath41 is the time of death .",
    "this has also a consequence for the graph representation of the system ; we will represent influences of the components of the state on the death process , but not influences of the death process on other components .",
    "since the death process is a special process , we may represent it by a special symbol , for instance a star : @xmath42 .",
    "for instance if we are interested in dementia , the state can be represented by a bivariate counting process @xmath43 , respectively counting dementia and death .",
    "however , dementia is defined only for a living subject : after death the subject does not exist anymore and can not be qualified as demented or not demented .",
    "when we investigate the causal influence of a factor , we should obey to the following    * rule 1 * first look at causal influence on death , then on influence on other processes .",
    "let us look at systems including death and dementia .",
    "in the simplest system , there are two processes , dementia and death , so that the state process is a bivariate counting process @xmath44 .",
    "this can also be represented by an illness - death process @xcite . with the markov property ,",
    "the illness - death process is specified by the transition intensities @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the intensity of the dementia process , defined on @xmath48 , is : @xmath49 and the intensity of the death process is : @xmath50.\\ ] ] as noted in section [ significanceofdeath ] , influences are studied on @xmath48 so that the only possible causal influence is that of dementia on death .",
    "dementia influences death if the transition intensities @xmath51 and @xmath52 ( resp .",
    "death rates for non - demented and demented ) are different , and this is symbolized by @xmath53 .",
    "the graph reduces to two nodes ( dementia and death ) and one arrow from dementia to death .",
    "this simplified form of the graph allows representing influences in more complex models , which can not be done with the conventional graphs for multistate models",
    ".    we may be interested in the effect of blood pressure on dementia .",
    "this is particularly interesting because we can consider blood pressure as a modifiable factor since there are anti - hypertensive treatments .",
    "so , the question of the possible causal influence of high blood pressure on dementia is of practical importance in public health .",
    "we can not , however , dissociate the issue of causal influence of high blood pressure on death and on dementia .",
    "anti - hypertensive treatments may also decrease the risk of death but we have also to consider the theoretical possibility that treating hypertension increases the risk of death .",
    "so the parameters of importance are both the effect on the intensity of death and the effect on the intensity of dementia . in order to approach causal inference",
    ", we must introduce other important factors , generally considered as explanatory variables in a multistate model . in this framework ,",
    "fixed variables are called `` attributes '' , while internal time - dependent variables are components of the state process ( there may also be external time - dependent variable , not treated in this paper ) .",
    "attributes are linked to the identity of the subject , like gender or more generally genetic factors .",
    "it is important to distinguish attributes from state because attributes can not be influenced . to distinguish them",
    "visually we will represent attributes by squares in the graphs .",
    "( dementia or cognitive ability ) and @xmath54 ( death , represented by a star ) are the processes of interest , @xmath0 represents a modifiable factor ( blood pressure ) and @xmath55 represents the attributes ( gender , genetic factors ) .",
    "[ graphdementia ] ]    so , we may consider the system @xmath56 , where @xmath0 represents the blood pressure process and @xmath55 the attributes .",
    "this system is depicted in figure [ graphdementia ] .",
    "we will assume that @xmath14 is a perfect system , or more realistically a nuc system for @xmath57 and for @xmath34 ( see section [ causalinfluences ] ) .",
    "if we can find @xmath33 which influences @xmath1 or @xmath54 , @xmath14 is not perfect ; if @xmath33 does not influence @xmath0 then , @xmath14 is still a nuc system for @xmath57 and @xmath34 ; the graph of a system including such @xmath33 is represented in figure [ graphperfectsystem ] .",
    "for instance if @xmath55 does not include educational level , the system is not perfect for @xmath1 because it has been shown that educational level influences dementia ; if educational level does not influence blood pressure , the system is still be a nuc system for @xmath34 .     and",
    "@xmath54 ( death , represented by a star ) ; @xmath0 represents a modifiable factor ( blood pressure ) and @xmath55 represents the attributes ( gender , genetic factors ) ; @xmath33 is another process influencing @xmath54 and @xmath1 but not @xmath0 .",
    "[ graphperfectsystem ] ]      in view of the situation described in section [ pos - systems ] the choice between two values of the possibly manipulable factor @xmath0 is not always obvious . the aim of this section is to formalize the cases where it is .",
    "assume that we know the law of @xmath14 ; then we can compute the probability of being alive non - demented , alive demented and dead for any time ( age ) @xmath58 for any given value of @xmath59 .",
    "if the probability of being dead and the probability of being demented are both lower for value @xmath60 compared to value @xmath61 , @xmath60 is clearly preferable to @xmath61 .",
    "the computation can be done for given @xmath62 or marginally to @xmath55 .    [ preferable ] let @xmath56 a nuc system for @xmath57 and @xmath34 and denote by @xmath63 the true probability law when the value of @xmath0 is @xmath60 , and @xmath64 the expectation under this true probability : @xmath60 is _ preferable _ to @xmath61 if @xmath65 and @xmath66 , with strict inequality holding for some @xmath58 .",
    "if @xmath1 is a @xmath37 process , @xmath67 ; the definition also applies to a quantitative @xmath1 when high values of @xmath68 are detrimental .    to fix the ideas ,",
    "let us assume that the true law of @xmath1 and @xmath54 given @xmath55 , is specified by the intensities : @xmath69 the intensity for @xmath1 is defined only on @xmath70 $ ] .",
    "these equations describe the true law of our processes and not a model ( that is a family of laws ) , and this is the meaning of putting a `` * '' in superscript of the symbols ; this is to make clear that we are not treating here the inference problem .",
    "we have a perfect or nuc system and we know the true law ; in this ideal situation what will we do ?",
    "if both @xmath71 and @xmath72 are positive , a sufficient condition for `` @xmath60 preferable to @xmath61 '' is that @xmath73 for all @xmath58 , with strict inequality for some @xmath58 . in this case",
    ", we could deduce that lowering blood pressure from @xmath74 to @xmath75 would lead to a preferable situation .    as a second example",
    ", we consider the case where the process of interest @xmath1 is the global cognitive ability .",
    "the true law could be that @xmath1 is a diffusion process : @xmath76 , where @xmath22 is a brownian motion .",
    "let us assume that the true law given @xmath55 , is specified by the intensities :    @xmath77    where @xmath78 and @xmath79 are baseline functions .",
    "as before , @xmath80 is defined only on @xmath70 $ ] .",
    "see the link between this modeling and the standard mixed - effect modeling for @xmath1 in section [ mixed - effect ] . here ,",
    "@xmath1 ( cognitive ability ) is clearly a construct and can not be observed in continuous time .",
    "it is indirectly measured by cognitive tests , necessarily at discrete times .",
    "if the system is perfect or nuc , we can make computation that can be used for choosing the best value of @xmath0 , in the case where @xmath0 can be manipulated .",
    "for each value @xmath59 , we can compute the probability of being alive at any @xmath58 , then given alive at @xmath58 , the distribution of @xmath68 . if , for all @xmath58 , the probability of being dead is lower and the mean value of the cognitive ability is higher for value @xmath60 compared to value @xmath61 , @xmath60 is clearly preferable to @xmath61 .",
    "when @xmath60 and @xmath61 can not be ordered this way , a utility function @xmath81 has to be constructed .",
    "if @xmath0 can be manipulated , one can choose the trajectory @xmath82 which maximizes @xmath81 .",
    "in the ideal situation of a perfect system , the compensators of the processes of interest , @xmath54 and @xmath1 , encapsulate the effect @xmath0 , and these effects can be summarized by some contrast between the compensators of @xmath54 and @xmath1 , respectively , for two different values of @xmath0 .",
    "let us assume that @xmath56 is perfect .",
    "the causal effect of @xmath0 can be summarized by any contrast of the compensators for two values of @xmath0 , say @xmath61 and @xmath60 : the simplest is the difference or the ratios of the intensities : if we use the difference for @xmath80 in equation ( [ eq : dyny ] ) we find @xmath83 , and if we use the ratio for @xmath84 in equation ( [ eq : dynd ] ) we find @xmath85 , the hazard ratio .",
    "other interesting contrasts bear on the expectation of the processes ; they are in fact functions of the compensators , so that contrasts between expectations can also be considered as contrasts between compensators , with , however , a direct interpretation .",
    "so we may contrast @xmath86 and @xmath87 for different values of @xmath82 .    however , we may be interested in marginal effects , for two reasons .",
    "first , we may wish to know what is the global effect of @xmath0 in a population . in our example",
    ", @xmath55 has a distribution in the population , so we could be interested in the marginal effect with respect to @xmath55 .",
    "second , we may doubt that the system we have built is a perfect system ; it may more realistic to assume that it is a nuc system for @xmath57 and @xmath88 .",
    "there are two cases .",
    "first , if @xmath89 , then @xmath90 is still nuc for @xmath57 and @xmath34 . in that case",
    "we could look at contrasts between the compensators of @xmath54 and @xmath1 in this imperfect system .",
    "however , even in that case , it is not likely to give very insightful interpretation .",
    "one example , in the simpler case of a survival model with frailty ( here @xmath55 ) has been given by @xcite : in the case of a proportional hazard for @xmath0 , the marginal hazard ratio is no longer proportional and in some cases of the distribution of the frailty the log marginal hazard ratio can have a sign opposite to the log conditional hazard ratio ; see also @xcite .",
    "so , when looking at marginal effects , it is better to use as criteria teh marginal ( or partly marginal ) expectations of the processes of interest : @xmath91 and @xmath92 ( rather than with dynamic parameters such as hazard ratios ) .    in the second case @xmath93",
    "; then it is a confounding factor so that we can not use @xmath94 for finding the marginal causal effect of @xmath0 .",
    "however , we can still compute it from the law of @xmath14 .",
    "in the stochastic system approach , there is a clear distinction between the physical system and the observations that we make .",
    "observing the processes in continuous time until @xmath41 , we have complete information .",
    "it often happens that we have incomplete observations ( the observed sigma - field is not included in the sigma - field generated by @xmath14 ) .",
    "if the mechanism leading to incomplete data ( mlid ) is ignorable ( see section [ section : rip ] ) , and assuming a well specified model and identifiability , we can consistently estimate the parameters from observations by maximum likelihood or a bayesian approach .    in our first example",
    "where @xmath1 is dementia , if all attributes and processes are observed in continuous time , with possible right - censoring , maximum likelihood estimation can easily be done by splitting the problem into several conventional survival problems , using the technical trick explained in @xcite .",
    "this will not be possible either if some attributes which have an influence on both dementia and death are not observed , or if @xmath0 or @xmath1 are observed in discrete time ( inducing interval - censoring ) . in both cases",
    "one can write the likelihood conditional on the complete data , and obtain the observed likelihood by taking the expectation .",
    "this leads to the computations of numerical integrals .",
    "if @xmath1 is a quantitative phenomenon , we must acknowledge that we never exactly observe it .",
    "there is always an observation error .",
    "this is also true for a binary state where observation errors are called `` misclassification errors '' ; for instance there may be errors in the diagnosis of dementia .",
    "however , in the binary case , it may be acceptable to neglect the observation error . in our example , we identify `` dementia '' and `` diagnosis of dementia '' .",
    "it is less acceptable to identify a score to a psychometric test and cognitive ability ; so we must represent a noisy observation .",
    "the statistical question is to estimate the compensators ; for this , we need observations and models .",
    "we will assume that we have well - specified models ( that is , the true law is within the model ) .",
    "however , we rarely have complete observations of the system over the horizon of interest .    as in @xcite and @xcite , for each physical process , we introduce a response indicator process ( rip ) which takes value @xmath95 if the physical process is observed at time @xmath58 , zero otherwise . this representation ( called `` time coarsening for stochastic processes '' ( tcmp ) ) allows us to represent very general mechanisms of censoring or coarsening .",
    "for instance in case where death is observed with right - censoring , the rip @xmath96 is : @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is the conventional censoring variable . in case where @xmath1 is observed at discrete times @xmath99 ,",
    "the corresponding rip is @xmath100 if @xmath101 , and @xmath102 otherwise . in the case",
    "where the rips are fixed and assuming we have a well - specified model for @xmath103 , it is possible to write the likelihood and to estimate the true law by maximum likelihood .",
    "when the rips are random , the observation can be represented by @xmath104 , where @xmath105 is the vector of rips and where is a diagonal matrix with diagonal given by @xmath105 .",
    "the main issue is whether the mlid is ignorable , that is whether we can estimate the true law by maximizing a `` partial likelihood '' which does not include the likelihood terms coming from the observation of the rips themselves .",
    "extensions of the concepts of mcar , mar , et mnar have been developed .",
    "the concept of coarsening at random ( car ) for random variable was introduced by @xcite as an extension to the missing at random ( mar ) concept .",
    "this was extended to a more general context by @xcite .",
    "here we shall use the definition of car for processes proposed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it is obvious that if the rips are independent from @xmath14 the mechanism is ignorable .",
    "the important concept is that of coarsening at random ( car ) for processes , denoted `` car(tcmp ) '' , where tcmp stands for `` time coarsening model for processes '' .",
    "when @xmath1 has a continuous state - space , we must add a model for observation errors ; it is also possible to add a model for misclassification when @xmath1 has a discrete state - space .",
    "we use here a dynamical version of car(tcmp ) called `` car(dyn ) '' .",
    "when the condition called car(dyn ) holds , the mlid is ignorable and estimation can be done by maximizing the `` partial '' likelihood , that is writing the likelihood as if the observation times , or more generally the rips , were fixed .",
    "essentially car(dyn ) holds if the law of @xmath105 conditional on @xmath14 depends only on the past observed values of @xmath103 .",
    "here is a rapid definition .",
    "assume that we can represent @xmath106 by a point process @xmath107 .",
    "denote by @xmath108 the filtration generated by the process @xmath107 .",
    "we define the filtration @xmath109 as the family of @xmath110-fields @xmath111 .",
    "we define also the filtration generated by @xmath14 , @xmath112 , and we denote by @xmath113 the sigma - field generated by @xmath14 on the maximum horizon .",
    "let us call @xmath114 and @xmath115 the compensators of @xmath116 in the filtrations @xmath109 and @xmath117 respectively where @xmath117 is the family of @xmath110-fields @xmath118",
    ".    we will denote car(dyn ) the condition :    under the probability laws that we use : @xmath119 , ( up to indistinguishability ) .",
    "intuitively this says that the dynamics of the rips only depends on the past observed values of the system @xmath14 and of the rips themselves ; it depends neither on future nor on unobserved past values of @xmath14 . in the case of a multistate models ,",
    "@xcite call `` doctor s care '' the case where observation times are decided as a function of the observed state of the patient . in that case",
    "the rip is clearly not independent of the state of the patient but the observation process is car(dyn ) and thus , is ignorable .",
    "random effects are often included , especially in models for quantitative @xmath1 . introducing random effects",
    "@xmath33 is a way to represent an attribute in the system but which is unobserved , that is , with null rip @xmath120 .",
    "it is called `` random '' because for inference we can not condition on the observation of @xmath33 , as is done for observed explanatory variables or processes .",
    "a latent process can be considered as a time - varying random effect .",
    "such a `` pure '' latent process can be represented as a process in the system , say @xmath33 , having an identically null rip : @xmath121 , for all @xmath58 .    in spite of this lack of observation we can still estimate the effect of the unobserved attribute @xmath33 on @xmath1 and @xmath54 , and the conditional effect of @xmath0 ( by using the likelihood , which is marginal with respect to the random effects ) , subject to identifiability :",
    "in particular , it is not possible to identify an effect on both @xmath0 and @xmath1 , that is to remove the potential confounding effect of an unobserved attribute .",
    "thus , we have to assume that @xmath122 .    adding a random effect or a pure latent process to a system @xmath123 assumed to be nuc is an attempt build a perfect system .",
    "suppose that attributes @xmath124 influence @xmath1 and @xmath54 , and that the system @xmath125 is perfect ; assume their influence on @xmath1 is through a linear form @xmath126 , and that on @xmath54 is through @xmath127 .",
    "if we do not ( or can not ) want to distinguish the effects of the @xmath128s , it is equivalent to work with @xmath129 that we can consider as perfect for @xmath43 .",
    "we may also simplify , assuming the same form @xmath33 influences both @xmath1 and @xmath54 leading to the system @xmath130 ( meaning by this notation that @xmath131 is close to a perfect system @xmath31 .",
    "there is , another case of latent process which is a process which can be indirectly observed .",
    "for instance , `` cognitive ability '' can be considered as a latent process that can be indirectly observed by psychometric scores and even , by diagnosis of dementia ( see section [ sec : illustration ] ) .",
    "this leads us to present a more general observation equation which unifies the observation of events and quantitative processes , whether latent or not . in its general form",
    "it also includes observations schemes used in mechanistic models @xcite . in mechanistic models",
    "we may observe combinations of different components of @xmath14 ( for instance we observe only the sum of infected and non - infected cd4 + t lymphocytes ) .",
    "thus the observable is @xmath132 ; the observable process is measured at inspection times and the observation is noisy . in more standard statistical applications one can often separate the observations of the different processes of the system . for sake of simplicity",
    "we give the general scheme of observation in the latter case for a process @xmath1 of @xmath14 .",
    "the general form of the observation is @xmath133 , where @xmath134 is the observed process ; if the mlid is ignorable we do not need to model the distribution of @xmath135 .",
    "@xmath134 is obtained using potentially three ingredients : the transformation function @xmath136 , the rip and the noise .",
    "we describe a first model , `` model - a '' , involving three stages and in which the noise is a measurement error :    1 .",
    "potential observable : @xmath137 ; 2 .   measured : @xmath138 ; 3 .",
    "noisy observation : @xmath139 ;    completely non - observed latent processes are characterized by an identically null rip ( @xmath140 ) .",
    "one still qualifies as `` latent '' a process which is indirectly observed , that is with unknown @xmath141 , often not one - to - one , and which is measured at discrete time .",
    "we then need a model for @xmath141 involving specific parameters that we will have to estimate @xcite .",
    "we do not call `` latent '' a process which can be observed `` directly '' , that is with @xmath141 the identity function or a known one - to - one function .",
    "the stage 2 of model - a is related to the times of measurement and is characterized by the rip ( see section [ section : rip ] ) . stage 3 is the possibly added noise ; we assume in general that the @xmath142 s are independent from @xmath1 .",
    "often , processes with binary state - space are considered to be observed without noise ; see for instance the statistical analysis of dementia proposed by @xcite .",
    "however , there may be misclassification errors . in that case",
    "we observe a binary variable with a bernoulli conditional distribution specified by @xmath143 and @xmath144 ( called in another context `` sensitivity '' and `` specificity '' ) .",
    "this can be represented by the function @xmath145 . for continuous state - space",
    "non - latent processes , the observation is generally in discrete time @xmath146 ; an additive error model is often used : @xmath147 .",
    "another model , `` model - b '' , for introducing noise is possible ; here the observable is a noisy version of @xmath1 and it involves two stages :    1 .",
    "potential observable : @xmath148 ; 2 .   observed : @xmath149 ;    if @xmath136 is a linear function , the two models are identical .",
    "@xcite used model - a for observation of a their mechanistic system while @xcite as well as @xcite used model - b for observation of a latent trait representing cognitive ability ; see section [ sec : illustration ] . while it is theoretically possible to mix the two models",
    ", this would not be practically identifiable in most cases .",
    "the concept of car(dyn ) can be extended to these more general models of observation .",
    "the definition is unchanged and @xmath150 still represent the observed sigma - field , but it must be defined in terms of @xmath151 : @xmath152",
    "we now tackle in some detail the issue of estimating the effect of a factor @xmath0 on a physiological process @xmath1 in the system @xmath56 assumed nuc system for @xmath57 and @xmath34 , or in a system enlarged to an unobserved process @xmath33",
    ", @xmath130 that we hope to be close to a perfect system for @xmath43 ( see section [ sec : random effect ] ) .    in system",

    "( by definition ) the effect of @xmath0 , conditional on all other factors ; in @xmath14 , it is marginal on @xmath33 .",
    "it is then possible to summarize these effects by suitably chosen contrasts between the values of the compensator for different values of @xmath0 .",
    "recall that this compensator is only defined on @xmath48 and that we have first to look at the effect of @xmath0 on death . then if we know these two compensators , we can look at preferable values for @xmath0 if we can manipulate it . in practice",
    "we have to estimate the compensators thanks to observations , as described in section [ sec : observation ] . in this section , assuming that @xmath55 and @xmath0 are completely observed , we examine whether the mlid is ignorable ( using the car(dyn ) condition ) when @xmath154 depends on @xmath1 , in both situations where @xmath1 is a 0 - 1 process and where @xmath1 is a quantitative process .",
    "the conclusions are summarized in table [ table : typology ] .",
    "we assume that death is observed in continuous time with right - censoring .",
    "the most conventional case is that @xmath1 is also observed with right - censoring .",
    "it is however often more realistic to acknowledge that @xmath1 is observed in discrete - time ( leading to interval - censored observations ) .",
    "let us look at the car(dyn ) condition for @xmath154 .",
    "first , if @xmath154 is completely independent of @xmath14 , car(dyn ) holds .",
    "@xmath154 may be influenced by @xmath55 and @xmath98 but this is not a problem if we assume they are completely observed ( which we do in this section ) .",
    "secondly , if @xmath154 is influenced by an unobserved process @xmath33 which also influences @xmath1 , car(dyn ) can not hold .",
    "* case where @xmath154 may be influenced by @xmath1 .",
    "* we must distinguish between the case with right - censoring and the case with interval - censoring .",
    "if @xmath1 is right - censored it is clear that car(dyn ) holds ( because right - censoring produces an observation in continuous time until censoring , so all past values of @xmath1 have been observed at the time of censoring ) .",
    "if @xmath1 is interval - censored , then the law of the rip may depend on unobserved values of @xmath1 .",
    "thus , we do not have necessarily car(dyn ) .",
    "for instance car(dyn ) holds if @xmath1 is observed at fixed visit times which may have been planned in a cohort study .",
    "however , there may also be loss to follow - up which may depend on unobserved values of @xmath1 .",
    "as for the rip of @xmath54 , @xmath96 , the same conclusions holds as for @xmath154 .",
    "however , since most often @xmath54 is observed in continuous time until censoring car(dyn ) generally holds .",
    "* example 1 : * suppose that observation of vital status ( @xmath54 ) is done until a fixed date , ( administrative censoring ) or , by design , until one year after @xmath155 , the time at which @xmath1 has been first observed to have jumped ; then , @xmath156 .",
    "car(dyn ) holds in this case .",
    "* example 2 : * @xmath96 may be influenced by unobserved values of @xmath1 , in which case car(dyn ) does not hold : this may happen if @xmath1 is observed in discrete time and the probability of loss to follow - up depends on @xmath1 ( for instance , demented people may enter into institution or refuse to participate to the study )",
    ". however , this should be the case only in a badly designed study because in many countries there exist death registers , so that censoring of vital status can be reduced to administrative censoring .      here , the most conventional case is that @xmath1 is observed in discrete - time .",
    "essentially the same conclusions can be driven as for the case where @xmath1 is a @xmath37 process observed in discrete - time .",
    "if there are observation errors , we observe for instance , under model - a ( see section [ sec : latent process ] ) @xmath157 , for the @xmath3s such as @xmath158 ; note that we have necessarily @xmath159 since @xmath1 is not defined after @xmath41 .",
    "we generally make the assumption that the @xmath5s and the @xmath160s are independent . if @xmath154 were only influenced by observed values of @xmath1 then car(dyn ) holds ( the doctor s care scheme of @xcite ) .",
    "an example with a quantitative process would be that @xmath1 represent the concentration of t - cd4 + lymphocytes , and the doctor determines the next visit for an hiv infected patient as a function of the observed cd4 counts ( the @xmath161s ) .",
    "however , it may happen that @xmath154 is influenced by unobserved values of @xmath1 , in which case car(dyn ) does not hold ; note that @xmath1 is never exactly observed because of the observation error .",
    "for instance opportunistic diseases may be influenced by the true value of cd4 + t - lymphocytes concentration and occurrence of such a disease may precipitate a new visit to the doctor .",
    ".cases where car(dyn ) holds ( that is , the mlid is ignorable ) when @xmath1 influences @xmath154 , according to whether @xmath1 is @xmath37 or quantitative and to the continuous or discrete - time observation scheme .",
    "a degree of plausibility is indicated for each situation . [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we have proposed a general approach based on the stochastic system approach to causality to study the effect of a factor on a process of interest taking binary or quantitative values , when the risk of death in non - negligible .",
    "we have argued that in that case one must first look at the effect of the factor on death , then on the process of interest .",
    "we have studied different observation schemes making a typology of cases where the mechanism leading to missing data was ignorable .",
    "we have examined the cases where ignoring death could lead to unbiased estimates of the effect on the process of interest .",
    "finally we have illustrated this approach in analysing the structure of the system and its observation in a study of the effect of blood pressure on cognitive performance in the elderly .",
    "all that has been said is valid when @xmath0 is a process that is completely observed or an observed fixed variable , which would then be considered as an attribute .",
