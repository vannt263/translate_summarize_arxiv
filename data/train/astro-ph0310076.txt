    "ngc7009 is a good example of a planetary nebula with fliers the nebula shows two pairs of condensations along the major symmetry axis .",
    "the outer pair has been called _ ansae _ ( = handles , aller 1941 ) .",
    "the condensations show strong emission in low ionization lines and weak emission in high excitation ones .",
    "kinematic studies by reay & atherton  ( 1985 ) and balick , preston & icke  ( 1987 ) have shown that the ansae are moving very near the plane of the sky at velocities @xmath9 km / s with respect to the central star . here",
    "we aim to better determine the kinematics of the ansae in ngc7009 , measuring radial velocities from high dispersion echelle spectra and proper motions from archive hst images . as a by - product ,",
    "the electron temperatures and densities are measured from line intensity ratios .",
    "the data consist of a set of echelle spectra and two sets of public hst images taken in 1996 and 2001 .",
    "the spectra were obtained during the night of july29 , 2002 , with the ctio 4 m echelle spectrograph , which was optimized to cover the spectral range 410 nm - 720 nm .",
    "the dimensions of the slit were @xmath10 , and the mean seeing was @xmath11 . for wavelength calibration",
    "a th - ar lamp was used .",
    "the flux calibration was done with observations of the star 58aql ( hr7596 ) .",
    "the hst images were obtained from the hst archive .",
    "the first set was taken on april28 , 1996 using the wfpc2 with a [ nii]6583 narrow band filter ( balick et al.1998 ) .",
    "the second set was taken in may11 , 2001 also with the wfpc2 and the same filter ( palen et al.2002 ) .",
    "the echelle spectra were reduced and calibrated using standard iraf routines .",
    "the dispersion is 0.008nmpixel@xmath12 , or 3.7km.s@xmath12.pixel@xmath12 at 650 nm .",
    "the hst images were retrieved from the archive using the _ on the fly calibration _ option .",
    "the calibrated images of each set were median combined to eliminate cosmic rays .",
    "the lines that could be identified in the spectra are listed in table [ spectra ] .",
    "the central wavelength of each line was measured by fitting a voigt profile .",
    "almost every line could be identified in two echelle orders , thus the value quoted is the average of the two values in each order .",
    "the rest wavelengths of forbidden lines were taken from bowen(1960 ) , while the values for the permitted lines were taken from moore(1945 ) .",
    "assuming symmetric expansion with respect to the central star , the system velocity is the average of the ansae s velocities , namely @xmath13km.s@xmath12 , whereas the radial expansion velocity with respect to the central star is @xmath14 km / s .",
