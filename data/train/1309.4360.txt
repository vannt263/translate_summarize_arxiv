    "we study a class of topological defects embedded in a flat spacetime . despite the absence of gravity , the defects are in a way similar to @xmath8 branes , in the sense of being the result of an embedding of a topological defect in two extra dimensions .",
    "specifically we consider @xmath1-dimensional topological defects with two coupled real scalar fields , constructed within a simplified model describing a color dielectric medium . *",
    "*  * * we follow and extend the procedure presented in refs .",

    "we show that the embedding of the radial defect in @xmath9 -dimensions form a tube - like topological defect and study its structure . in the present work ,",
    "we show that the construction with two scalar fields is crucial for studying processes of field localization of spin-0 particles with particular interest for resonance effects .",
    "there are several examples of two - dimensional topological defects with radial symmetry .",
    "for instance , vortices are @xmath1 dimensional soliton solutions in @xmath10 gauge theory with complex scalars and the higgs mechanism @xcite .",
    "recently , interesting extensions for non - abelian fields have been constructed @xcite .",
    "ring - type objects are a subject of great interest ( see , for instance , the review @xcite ) .",
    "an important example of solutions of this type in curved spacetime are black rings , which are solutions of general relativity with extra dimensions ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "another  interesting example of ring solitons in gauge field theory are the anomalous solitons , where the gauge field is constrained after fixing its chern - simons number by including fermions into the system @xcite .",
    "also in non - abelian gauge field theory we can have smooth , finite energy loops stabilized by the magnetic energy , forming non - abelian rings .",

    ", the sphaleron rings can perhaps have an importance as mediators of baryon number violating processes @xcite .    in this work",

    "a first physical motivation is to show that a dielectric model with two coupled real scalar fields can be responsible for an effective breaking of translational invariance , leading to a topological defect capable of trapping scalar particles with simple couplings . in this way",
    ", this work can be inserted in a series of previous studies of trapping of spin-0 fields for specific topological defects . in the context of braneworlds",

    "the first - order formalism is very helpful for achieving explicit analytical solutions for brane models .",
    "as far as we know , brane models with two extra dimensions have no similar formalism developed yet , which turns explicit solutions much more difficult to obtain . in this way another motivation for this work can be inserted in the searching for such first - order formalism . indeed ,",
    "here we consider a @xmath4dimensional system where the two extra dimensions are described by the usual @xmath13 coordinates , but where the application of a first - order formalism was done only in a flat minkowski spacetime , neglecting gravity effects .",
