    "since the discovery of the first planets around other stars @xcite , the search for exoplanets has blossomed to become one of the most exciting fields of modern astronomical research . the great majority of the hundreds of exoplanets that have been discovered over the past two decades have been found orbiting sun - like stars by dedicated international radial velocity programs . among these programmes",

    "the other main method for exoplanet detection is the transit technique , which searches for the small dips in the brightness of stars that result from the transit of planets across them .",
    "ground - based surveys such as wasp @xcite and hat @xcite have pioneered such observations , and resulted in the discovery of a number of interesting planetary systems . in the coming years , such surveys using space - based observatories will revolutionise the search for exoplanets .",
    "indeed , a rapidly growing contribution to the catalogue of known exoplanets comes from the _ kepler _ spacecraft ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which will likely result in the number of known exoplanets growing by an order of magnitude in the coming years .    in recent years , a number of new exoplanet discoveries have been announced featuring host stars that differ greatly from the sun - like archetype that make up the bulk of detections .",
    "the most striking of these are the circumbinary planets , detected around eclipsing binary stars via the periodic variations in the timing of observed stellar eclipses .",
    "a number of these unusual systems feature cataclysmic variable stars , interacting binary stars composed of a white dwarf primary and a roche lobe filling m star secondary .",
    "sharply - defined eclipses of the bright accretion spot , with periods of hours , can be timed with a precision of a few seconds . in these systems , the eclipse timings are fitted with a linear ephemeris , and the residuals ( @xmath0 ) are found to display further , higher - order variations .",
    "these variations can be attributed to the gravitational effects of distant orbiting bodies which tug on the eclipsing binary stars , causing the eclipses to appear slightly early or late . this light - travel time",
    "( ltt ) effect can then be measured and used to infer the presence of planetary - mass companions around these highly unusual stars .",
    "some examples of circumbinary companions discovered in this manner include uz  for @xcite , nn  ser @xcite , dp  leo @xcite , hu  aqr @xcite and sz  her @xcite    the first circumbinary planets to be detected around hosts other than pulsars were those in the hw  vir system @xcite , which features a subdwarf primary , of spectral class b , and a red dwarf companion which display mutual eclipses with a period of around 2.8  hours @xcite .",
    "the detection of planets in this system was based on the timing of mutual eclipses between the central stars varying in a fashion that was best fit by including two sinusoidal timing variations .",
    "the first , attributed to a companion of mass @xmath1 , had a period of 15.8  years , and a semi - amplitude of 77  s , while the second , attributed to a companion of mass @xmath2 , had a period of 9.1  years and semi - amplitude of 23  s. whilst these semi - amplitudes might appear relatively small , the precision with which the timing of mutual eclipses between the components of the hw  vir binary can be measured means that such variations are relatively easy to detect .    over the last decade ,",
    "a number of studies have shown that , for systems that are found to contain more than one planetary body , a detailed dynamical study is an important component of the planet discovery process that should not be overlooked ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , despite these pioneering works , the great majority of exoplanet discovery papers still fail to take account of the dynamical behaviour of the proposed systems .",
    "fortunately , this situation is slowly changing , and recent discovery papers such as @xcite , @xcite and @xcite have shown how studying the dynamical interaction between the proposed planets can provide significant additional constraints on the plausible orbits allowed for those planets .",
    "such studies can even reveal systems in which the observed signal can not be explained by the presence of planetary companions .",
    "the planets proposed to orbit hu  aqr are one such case , with a number of studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) showing that the orbital architectures allowed by the observations are dynamically unstable on astronomically short timescales .",
    "in other words , whilst it is clear that the observed signal is truly there , it seems highly unlikely that it is solely the result of orbiting planets .",
    "given these recent studies , it is clearly important to consider whether known multiple - planet exoplanetary systems are truly what they seem to be . in this work ,",
    "we present a re - analysis of the 2-planet system proposed around the eclipsing binary hw  vir . in section 2 ,",
    "we briefly review the hw  vir planetary system as proposed by @xcite . in section 3 , a detailed dynamical analysis of the planets proposed in that work is performed . in section 4",
    ", we present a re - analysis of the observations of hw  vir that led to the announcements of the exoplanets , obtaining a new orbital solution for those planets which is dynamically tested in section 5 .",
    "finally , in section 6 , we present a discussion of our work , and draw conclusions based on the results herein .",
    "the hw  vir system consists of a subdwarf b primary and an m6 - 7 main sequence secondary .",
    "the system eclipses with a period of 2.8  hours @xcite , and the stars have masses of @xmath3  and @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "changes in the orbital period of the eclipsing binary were first noted by @xcite ; further observations led other authors to suggest that the period changes were due to ltt effects arising from an orbiting substellar companion @xcite . @xcite obtained a further 8  years of photometric observations of hw  vir . those data , in combination with the previously published eclipse timings spanning 24  years , indicated that the period changes consisted of a quadratic trend plus two sinusoidal variations with periods of 15.8 and 9.1  years .",
    "@xcite examined alternative explanations for the cyclical changes , ruling out apsidal motion and magnetic period modulation via the applegate mechanism @xcite .",
    "they concluded that the most plausible cause of the observed cyclic period changes is the light - travel time effect induced by two companions with masses 19.2 and 8.5  .",
    "the parameters of their fit can be found in table [ lee09_params ] .",
    "formally , the planets are referred to as hw  vir  ( ab)b and hw  vir  ( ab)c , but for clarity , we refer to the planets as hw  vir  b and hw  vir  c."
