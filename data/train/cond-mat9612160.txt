    "since its introduction by landau in 1956 , the fermi liquid paradigm has been the most robust stepping - stone of the theory of metals@xcite .",
    "its central assumption is the existence of a one to one correspondence between the excitations of a free fermi gas and an interacting fermionic system . even though originally formulated to explain the behavior of a neutral fermi system ( @xmath0he ) , it has formed the basis of much of our understanding of what goes on in metallic systems .",
    "it lies behind such successful theories as migdal s electron - phonon theory and provides the background upon which instabilities such as superconductivity can be understood .",
    "it has proved to be a valuable guide in the analysis of even very strongly correlated systems , such as some of the heavy fermion metals , where the theory seems to survive the most extreme circumstances , with enormous renormalizations in the quasiparticle effective mass .",
    "the very idea of a correspondence between the low - lying excitations of an interacting system and those of a reference one has proved more general than the original strict application envisioned by landau . indeed , this principle of `` adiabatic continuity''@xcite can be found in very diverse situations with very different and sometimes non - trivial reference systems .",
    "for example , in the so - called fermi liquid theory of the kondo or anderson impurity problem , the reference system is a non - interacting scattering center embedded in a free fermi sea@xcite .",
    "other examples include superfluid @xmath0he@xcite , atomic nuclei@xcite and interacting disordered metals@xcite .",
    "the corresponding reference systems , in these latter cases , are the bcs model of pairing , a shell model of the nucleus and a model of diffusive electrons in a random potential , respectively .    given this operational definition of a fermi liquid , the question of whether a particular system behaves as a fermi liquid or not can be a rather delicate one .",
    "it is necessary first to determine what is a natural reference system for a particular compound and then find out whether the compound can fit a description which is adiabatically connected to the reference one .",
    "we can not overemphasize the fact that this is not always a straightforward task .",
    "daunting as the task may be , researchers have nonetheless developed rules of thumb to classify various systems as non - fermi liquids .",
    "one such commonly used criterion is a resistivity which depends linearly on the temperature at low temperatures , a result certainly inconsistent with a clean fermi liquid .",
    "however , as helpful as these empirical tests are , as a matter of scientific rigor , we must stress that the classification of a certain system as a non - fermi liquid often involves careful cross - checking between experiment and theory .",
    "this is particularly critical when the system is disordered . with these caveats in mind",
    ", we can proceed to consider the question of non - fermi liquid behavior .    in recent years",
    ", a growing number of metallic compounds have come to be known as counter - examples to the old fermi liquid paradigm .",
    "this is usually taken to mean that the adiabatic continuity hypothesis appears to break down , _ if one assumes the most natural reference system for the system under study .",
    "_ this has been perhaps most strongly emphasized in the case of the high t@xmath1 cuprate superconductors@xcite , where landau s original fermi liquid theory is unexpectedly violated in the normal state .",
    "in addition , some heavy fermion systems have also been discovered which do not seem to fit the general picture of a fermi liquid@xcite .",
    "the bulk of this evidence has in effect turned the study of non - fermi liquid behavior into an independent frontier area of research whose ramifications can only be dimly glimpsed .",
    "the main goal is to determine _ the possible routes _ towards the breakdown of fermi liquid theory and to classify what new low - lying excitations are present in these systems .    among the non - fermi liquid candidates , some should be classified as belonging to the heavy fermion family",
    "this is taken to mean , in this context , that for some range of composition or for certain values of external parameters  such as pressure or magnetic field ",
    "these compounds show typical heavy fermion physics with high temperature incoherent kondo behavior accompanied by the formation of a low temperature heavy fermi liquid , with or without magnetic or superconducting order@xcite .",
    "however , for the more interesting values of these parameters , their behavior is not that of a fermi liquid .    some of the heavy fermion non - fermi liquid metals have been convincingly associated with the proximity to a quantum critical point .",
    "these are the alloy cecu@xmath2au@xmath3@xcite and the compound cepd@xmath4si@xmath4@xcite .",
    "both systems show antiferromagnetism : cecu@xmath2au@xmath3 for @xmath5 and cepd@xmath4si@xmath4 for pressures @xmath6 kbar . at the critical values of these parameters ,",
    "the nel temperature @xmath7 vanishes and the behavior of the system appears to be governed by the zero temperature critical point .",
    "the anomalous non - fermi liquid behavior of these compounds is exemplified by the resistivity which is given by @xmath8 in cecu@xmath9au@xmath10 and as @xmath11 in cepd@xmath4si@xmath4 at @xmath12 kbar . in the latter case ,",
    "the non - fermi liquid behavior is interrupted by what appears to be a phase transition into a superconducting state at @xmath13 .",
    "the thermodynamic response of cecu@xmath9au@xmath10 is also anomalous with the specific heat @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "in addition , external pressure can suppress @xmath7 to zero in cecu@xmath16au@xmath17 and the anomalous behavior associated with the quantum critical point can be recovered .",
    "though the non - fermi liquid behavior can be reasonably ascribed to the proximity of a quantum critical point a complete theory does not yet seem to exist@xcite .",
    "in contrast to the latter compounds , a series of other alloys also seems to show characteristic non - fermi liquid behavior which can not be clearly associated with quantum criticality . a partial list of these is given in , together with their corresponding resistivity , specific heat and magnetic susceptibility ( see also refs .",
    "all of them show anomalous thermodynamic and transport properties incompatible with a fermi liquid description .",

    "it is the goal of this paper to present a scenario in which a non - fermi liquid state is generated as a consequence of the interplay of disorder and strong correlations@xcite .",
    "this theory provides a consistent way of understanding the non - fermi liquid anomalies in both transport and thermodynamic properties based on a single underlying mechanism .",
    "the central idea of this theory is that moderate bare disorder in a lattice model of localized moments is magnified due to the strong local correlations between the moments and the conduction electrons . in particular ,",
    "a broad distribution of local energy scales ( kondo temperatures ) is generated@xcite .",
    "a few local sites with very small kondo temperatures are _ unquenched _ at low temperatures and dominate the thermodynamics and transport , forming a dilute gas of low - lying excitations above the disordered metallic ground state .",
    "the presence of these _ unquenched _ moments leads to the formation of a non - fermi liquid phase . while we think that ucu@xmath22pd@xmath3 ( @xmath40 and @xmath41 ) provides the best candidate system to exhibit such a phase to this date , we expect this type of behavior to be seen in other kondo alloys . whether the other alloys in can be understood in this framework",
    "is not clear at this moment .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in",
    ", we discuss the experimental work on the ucu@xmath22pd@xmath3 alloys which served as the motivation for this study , emphasizing the most important underlying physical ideas . in ,",
    "we present the model and our dynamical mean field theory approach to its solution . in",
    ", we show the nature of the ground state of the model in the clean as well as in the disordered limits .",
    "in , we explain the origin of the linear dependence on the temperature of the resistivity . in",
    ", we apply this disorder model to the description of the dynamical susceptibility and compare the results with experiments on ucu@xmath22pd@xmath3 .",
    "finally , we conclude with a discussion of the limitations of our approach in . in order to lighten the line of argument ,",
    "a few derivations are left to the appendices .",
    "the major reason for considering disorder as the possible origin of the anomalous behavior of the alloys of was the cu nmr study reported in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this paper , the cu nmr field - swept powder pattern spectra of ucu@xmath22pd@xmath3 for @xmath40 and @xmath41",
    "were shown to exhibit strong inhomogeneous broadening that could only be explained by invoking the presence of short - range disorder .",
    "a simple disorder model was then used to describe both the broadening of the nmr line and the spin susceptibility and specific heat measured in these samples .",
    "the model consisted of a collection of independent spins , mimicking the uranium ions , each coupled to the conduction electron bath by a dimensionless kondo coupling constant @xmath42 , which was allowed to be randomly distributed in the samples .",
    "these were supposed to mimic the local disorder induced by the @xmath43 substitution in the @xmath44 ligand sites of the parent ucu@xmath45 compound and , for simplicity , were assumed to be distributed according to a gaussian . assuming that the spins were completely uncorrelated , the thermodynamic response",
    "was then calculated by taking an average over the response of a single kondo spin with the distribution of coupling constants . since the physics of a single kondo spin",
    "is characterized by a single energy scale@xcite  the kondo temperature  the important quantity in the averaging procedure is the distribution of kondo temperatures .",
    "the kondo temperature is defined as @xmath46 because of the exponential dependence on the coupling constant @xmath47 , the corresponding distribution of kondo temperatures is skewed and considerably broadened . shows the experimentally determined distributions of kondo temperatures for both alloys ( @xmath40 and @xmath41 ) .",
    "we first note that , due to the jacobian in the definition of @xmath48 , it actually diverges weakly as @xmath49 @xmath50 \\left(\\frac{d\\lambda}{dt_k}\\right ) = \\frac{p[\\lambda(t_k)]}{t_k \\left({\\rm ln}(d / t_k)\\right)^2}. \\label{jacobian}\\ ] ]    = 4.5 in    however , for the distributions determined experimentally for ucu@xmath22pd@xmath3 ( @xmath40 and @xmath41 ) and shown in , the point at which @xmath48 shows an upturn and starts to diverge occurs at very low temperatures : @xmath51 ( @xmath40 ) and @xmath52 ( @xmath41 ) , which can hardly be distinguished on the scale of .",
    "none of the conclusions derived from the use of the full @xmath48 below depends on this small diverging tail , _ as long as one does not probe into the low temperature region below the upturn point scale_. instead , as will be shown below , the response of the system is dominated by the part of @xmath48 _ above the upturn _ , which appears to be tending to a constant value as @xmath49 .",
    "this means that there is a finite number of spins with arbitrarily low @xmath53 s in the sample , a feature that will be at the root of the non - fermi liquid features .",
    "we have , therefore , chosen to depict @xmath48 only above the upturn point and will confine the analysis below to a distribution which tends to a constant as @xmath49 .",
    "it remains an interesting possibility whether the effects of the low @xmath53 divergence of @xmath48 can be actually observed . on the other hand",
    ", it is also conceivable that there is a physical infrared cutoff @xmath54 to @xmath55 ( @xmath56 for both distributions ) . in the absence of any experimental evidence for either possibility",
    ", we will focus on the more relevant effect of the distribution of kondo temperatures above the upturn .    from the solution of the single impurity kondo problem",
    "it is known that thermodynamic quantities like the impurity spin susceptibility @xmath20 increase with decreasing temperature in a curie fashion , with logarithmic corrections@xcite . however , at very low temperatures , the curie - like divergence is cut off and the susceptibility saturates to a constant value proportional to the inverse kondo temperature .",
    "the scale that separates the high temperature from the low temperature region is the kondo temperature .",
    "the impurity specific heat divided by the temperature @xmath57 has a somewhat similar behavior .",
    "the saturation at the lowest temperatures is a consequence of the `` disappearance '' of the free spin response , through the formation of a singlet ground state with the conduction electron bath , a process generally known as `` quenching '' .",
    "if we are measuring the thermodynamic properties at a certain finite temperature @xmath58 , there will always be uranium ions with @xmath59 , which remain unquenched and whose contribution dominates the overall response ( the shaded area in ) .",
    "as the temperature is lowered , the number of such spins decreases , as more and more of them become quenched .",
    "the thermodynamic behavior of the disordered system is , therefore , dominated by the tails of the distribution of kondo temperatures , rather than by the average , a situation commonly known as a griffiths phase@xcite .    since both @xmath20 and @xmath57 scale as the inverse kondo temperature at @xmath39 , the fact that @xmath60 immediately implies that the leading behavior of the averaged quantity is a logarithmic divergence .",
    "indeed , consider , for example , the susceptibility @xmath61 where the asymptotic forms of @xmath62 are known@xcite @xmath63 @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 being universal numbers . to find the leading low temperature behavior it is sufficient to use the first term in @xmath67 .",
    "therefore , if @xmath68 denotes the average over the distribution of kondo temperatures @xmath69 where we cut off the integral by an arbitrary scale @xmath70 which sets the region of validity of the approximate form for @xmath48 . from",
    ", it is clear that the lower limit of the integral in gives a regular contribution whereas the upper limit dominates @xmath71 a similar analysis holds for @xmath57 , with a similar divergence .",
    "a caveat about the experimental situation is in order here . in the literature",
    ", one often finds different power laws fitted to thermodynamic and transport properties of this and other compounds . in the particular case of ucu@xmath22pd@xmath3",
    ", one can find @xmath72 , with @xmath73@xcite , @xmath74@xcite and @xmath75@xcite .",
    "it is not always clear what temperature range was used in the fits . in the case of ref .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath75 power law is argued to be valid in an intermediate range of temperatures ( between @xmath76 and @xmath77 ) .",
    "besides , there is a small sample dependence to these quantities and , in the case of the susceptibility , the magnetic field strength used in the measurement can have an important effect@xcite .",
    "we feel that all these aspects should be carefully considered when trying to determine the temperature dependence .",
    "it is important to notice that the distribution of kondo temperatures reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , which is nearly featureless at low @xmath53 , gives a logarithmic divergence in @xmath20 and @xmath57 as the _ leading _ low temperature behavior . in the fits shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , there are clear deviations from this leading behavior at intermediate and higher temperatures .",
    "we point out that power law behavior could be inferred from the analysis of a narrow window of temperatures .",
    "what gives us particular confidence in the disorder model is the fact that a full theoretical curve , with the added complication of a finite magnetic field , can be well fitted to the experiments . on the other hand , it is not clear how changes in the specific form of the distribution function used would affect the quality of the fit in the intermediate and high temperature regions .    finally , for completeness",
    ", we have plotted in the wilson ratio ( @xmath78 ) prediction in the disorder model as a function of temperature .",
    "when @xmath79 , the wilson ratio tends to its universal value of @xmath80 when @xmath81 , which is consistent with the fermi liquid prediction .",
    "when @xmath82 , the wilson ratio appears to tend to a different value for a wide range of temperatures .",
    "this can be understood from .",
    "because the scale @xmath70 , which enters this equation , depends on the details of the full scaling curve , it is going to be , in general , different for @xmath20 as compared to @xmath57 . though the scale is asymptotically irrelevant when @xmath83 , because of the slow logarithmic dependence , it takes a temperature that is too low in order for one to be able to observe the asymptotic behavior .",
    "= 4.5 in    we point out that one feature which distinguishes the alloy ucu@xmath22pd@xmath3 from the other alloys in is the nature of the doping . in the former case , the f - sublattice remains unchanged and substitutions are introduced in the ligand sites . in the other cases , the doping is performed directly in the f - sites .",
    "it is apparent that ligand site substitution will affect the hybridization matrix element @xmath84 of an anderson model description and that will likely be the primary effect ( see for a discussion of the disordered anderson lattice model ) .",
    "it is less certain what kind of effect such substitution will have on the f - site energy @xmath85 .",
    "moreover , lattice microstrains should also be reflected in the hybridization amplitude @xmath84 .",
    "this is probably what happens in ucu@xmath86pd , which could be stoichiometric and indeed appears to be so according the x - rays , but whose broad nmr lines give unequivocal evidence of disorder . on the other hand ,",
    "f - site replacements can be mimicked by a different f - site energy @xmath85 ( @xmath87 , when the substitutional ion is a non - magnetic `` kondo hole '' ) and , presumably , a different hybridization @xmath84 . in the interest of generality , and in the absence of a better understanding of the nature of the disorder",
    ", we will consider in this paper _ both _ @xmath85 and @xmath84 disorder .",
    "what should be emphasized , however , is the fact that , _ whatever the microscopic origin of disorder _ , its observable consequences will always depend only on the distribution of kondo temperatures @xmath48 , for it is these scales which govern the measured responses . in other words , almost all the information that can be obtained experimentally about the disorder will be filtered through @xmath48 .",
    "therefore , the main conclusion of ref .",
    "@xcite was that a simple model of kondo disorder is able to account for the nmr line broadening as well as the anomalous thermodynamic response of the alloys studied .",
    "this simple model relied on the assumption that the correlations between the kondo spins could be neglected , though they form a concentrated lattice in these alloys .",
    "past studies of heavy fermion systems , both experimental@xcite and theoretical@xcite , give us confidence that this may not be a bad approximation for thermodynamic quantities ( see also the [ thermo ] ) .",
    "however , it is well known that transport is _ very _ different in dilute kondo systems as opposed to concentrated kondo lattices .",
    "the so - called onset of coherence in the clean , concentrated case is the most dramatic example .",
    "it is characterized by rather large resistivities at high and intermediate temperatures , consequence of strong incoherent kondo scattering off the localized moments , which is then followed by a precipitous fall by some orders of magnitude at the lowest temperatures . at very low temperatures ,",
    "the system can then be characterized as a good metal .",
    "this low - temperature coherence is a consequence of translational invariance and bloch s theorem in the ordered lattice system .",
    "we will , therefore , address the question of whether a single unifying approach to the disorder problem , sensitive enough to the formation of a coherent state in the clean limit , is able to be formulated .",
    "we will answer the latter question in the affirmative and will thereby show that the same mechanism that leads to diverging thermodynamic properties at low @xmath58  the presence of spins with arbitrarily low @xmath53 s  will also predict a resistivity which is _ linear _ in @xmath58 , as observed in many non - fermi liquid heavy fermion alloys .",
    "in order to consider the interplay of disorder and local moment behavior we will focus our attention on a model of disordered anderson lattices . we will be guided by the series of alloys listed in . in the spirit of previous works on heavy fermion systems",
    "we will assume that the f - electron sites can be described by simplified non - degenerate anderson impurities hybridized with a single broad uncorrelated band of conduction electrons @xmath88 where , @xmath89 destroys a conduction electron with momentum @xmath90 and spin @xmath91 from a band with dispersion @xmath92 and half bandwidth @xmath93 and @xmath94 destroys an f - electron at site @xmath95 with spin @xmath91 . since @xmath96 is generally the largest energy scale in typical f - shell parameters it will be taken to infinity in this paper .    the important thing to notice in is that , unlike in the usual periodic anderson model , the local f - shell parameters @xmath97 and @xmath98 are taken here to be random numbers distributed , in general , according to two different distributions @xmath99 and @xmath100 . as explained before , in the absence of a more detailed understanding of the microscopic nature of the disorder in these systems",
    ", one should take @xmath99 and @xmath100 to be , in principle , of the most general form .",
    "note , however , that we will _ not _ assume the disorder widths to be too large . for instance , the nmr study of ref .",
    "@xcite suggests bare distribution widths to be around 20% of their average values .",
    "however , as we will see , correlation effects will themselves generate large _ effective _ disorder . in practice",
    ", we have considered gaussian and uniform distributions .",
    "disorder in the conduction electron band , though certainly present in these alloys , is not subject to these correlation - induced renormalizations and has therefore been neglected in our treatment . despite these simplifications , we believe the model in captures the essential ingredients relevant to the study of disorder in kondo alloys .",
    "some previous studies of disordered anderson or kondo lattices have been reported in the literature .",
    "we mention , in particular , the early work of teanovi , who employed a slave boson approach@xcite .",
    "more recently , other studies of the effect of disorder in these model systems have appeared@xcite .",
    "in order to make progress , we have applied the dynamical mean field theory of correlations and disorder to the hamiltonian of @xcite .",
    "the derivation of the dynamical mean field theory is most easily accomplished on a bethe lattice and we will focus on this class of models . in this case , the conduction electron density of states acquires a simple semicircular form .",
    "the solution of the full lattice problem then reduces to the solution of an _ ensemble _ of impurity problems supplemented by a self - consistency condition on the conduction electron green s function@xcite .",
    "more precisely , the impurity problem action for a random site @xmath95 is given , on the matsubara frequency axis , by @xmath101 ,   \\label{effaction}\\ ] ] where the infinite - u constraint is implied and @xmath102 here , @xmath103 is the conduction electron hopping matrix element and @xmath104 is the disorder - averaged local conduction electron green s function .",
    "note that @xmath105 is the hybridization function of the conduction electrons which is `` seen '' by each local f - site .",
    "therefore , it corresponds to the local conduction electron green s function with one f - site removed .",
    "this is the so - called `` cavity '' green s function@xcite .",
    "the self - consistency condition determines @xmath104 through @xmath106 where @xmath107 here , @xmath108 denotes the average over disorder defined by the distribution functions @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "@xmath109 is the f - electron self - energy derived from the impurity model of .",
    "this is explicitly defined by @xmath110 where the f - electron green s function is given by @xmath111 here , we have used @xmath112 to denote the quantum mechanical / thermal average under the action of .    once the problem defined by  has been solved , the conduction electron self - energy @xmath113 is obtained from @xmath114 this self - energy is the important object for the calculation of the conductivity , which , in the infinite coordination limit , involves no vertex corrections@xcite @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the fermi function and we have introduced a lattice parameter @xmath117 and the correct dimensional factors appropriate for three dimensions . in , @xmath118 is the conduction electron one - particle spectral density @xmath119 the dc conductivity is then given by @xmath120 this expression can be further simplified as shown in [ app_expcond ] . to make contact with the usual drude formula for the dc conductivity it is useful to define the scattering time @xmath121 which reduces to the usual case when @xmath122 @xmath123 in [ app_cself_tmat ] , a formula which expresses the conduction electron self - energy in terms of the disorder - averaged impurity t - matrix is derived .",
    "this formula will be useful in , when we analyze the temperature dependence of the resistivity .",
    "thermodynamic properties within this approach are not drastically different from the predictions of the simple disorder model of ref .",
    "@xcite , discussed in . though the self - consistently determined conduction electron density of states `` seen '' by the f - sites ( @xmath124 ) can be substantially modified as compared to its free value , these modifications only lead to a renormalized density of states , which is the quantity that ultimately enters into the kondo temperature expression .",
    "once the renormalized density of states is given , the prediction of the dynamical mean field theory is essentially the same as that of the simple disorder model of ref .",
    "@xcite , the difference being negligible .",
    "we discuss the thermodynamics properties in the dynamical mean field theory in [ thermo ] .",
    "we would like to emphasize at this point what processes are included and what processes are left out of this approach .",
    "when the interaction @xmath96 is turned off , the treatment of the disorder problem that is obtained is equivalent to the well - known coherent potential approximation ( cpa)@xcite . this approximation is known to give reliable results as long as localization effects are negligible , since the conduction electron density of states fluctuations are treated on the average .",
    "this seems to be a safe approximation in the case of the alloys of interest , where estimates based on the zero temperature dc resistivity give @xmath125 .",
    "however , the interplay of disorder fluctuations and correlations on the f - sites is fully kept in our treatment and , indeed , is at heart of the physics that will emerge .",
    "this is evidenced by the fact that one needs to correctly solve an _ ensemble _ of interacting impurity problems in order to close the equations .",
    "each member of the _ ensemble _ of impurity problems has an associated characteristic kondo temperature @xmath53 , thus generating a distribution of local kondo scales@xcite .",
    "the fluctuations associated with this distribution of kondo temperatures will be responsible for the anomalous low - temperature behavior in the non - fermi liquid regime .",
    "other processes which are left out of this essentially local approach are related to the rkky interaction between f - sites mediated by the exchange of conduction electron spin fluctuations .",
    "we will comment on the possible limitations of this approximation in .",
    "the most difficult part of solving  is solving the impurity problem .",
    "let us consider initially the clean case .",
    "then , there is only one impurity model to be solved .",

    "though a more accurate description should be endeavored , we believe the disorder model can not be ruled out by the neutron scattering data .",
    "we would like to now pause and consider the overall picture that emerges from the disorder model as well as the drawbacks of our current treatment of the problem .",
    "we have emphasized throughout that the important ingredient at the base of all the non - fermi liquid features in this approach is the presence of f - sites with arbitrarily low local kondo temperatures .",

    "as the temperature is raised , these low-@xmath53 spins are gradually unquenched and it is this very release process that gives rise to the anomalous thermodynamic as well as transport properties .",
    "one of the practical difficulties one faces in applying the dynamical field theory , is the fact that , due to the very nature of the physics involved , one needs to be able to solve the _ ensemble _ of impurity models in the whole range of temperatures from @xmath201 to @xmath202 .",
    "this is a notoriously difficult task as is evidenced by the long history that led to the final solution of the kondo problem .",
    "the conventional approach of wilson s numerical renormalization group , as is currently formulated , relies on a special `` energy - shell '' decimation procedure , which is not obviously adapted to the present case of a general conduction electron density of states .",
    "therefore , in the non - trivial case of the resistivity , we are not yet able to reliably predict the value of the coefficient of the linear term , which might be checked against experiments .",
    "the dynamical mean field theory does not take into account the rkky interaction between f - sites .",
    "these have been studied most extensively in the context of the two - impurity kondo problem@xcite . from these studies",
    "it is known that , if the rkky scale is large enough compared to @xmath53 , the two impurity spins develop strong correlations which tend to lock them into a singlet state , whereby the kondo effect is killed .",
    "since we rely on the presence of certain sites with very low kondo temperatures , one might wonder whether the inclusion of rkky interactions would not effectively provide a low energy cutoff below which @xmath48 would be essentially negligible .",
    "although we can not give a rigorous answer to this question , some very general arguments indicate that the possibility of having low-@xmath53 spins is more robust than one might expect .",
    "we have already emphasized that , if the distribution function @xmath48 is broad enough , at low temperatures compared to its overall width , the fraction of spins which remain unquenched is rather small .",
    "therefore , in general , they form a _",
    "dilute _ system of spins of density @xmath203 , the average distance between them being proportional to @xmath204 . since the average distance will be large",
    ", this will render the rkky interaction less effective , since its strength decays as @xmath205 .",
    "furthermore , we will argue that the effectiveness of the rkky interaction in suppressing the kondo effect is actually a higher order effect in the dilution @xmath203 .",
    "indeed , consider two low-@xmath53 spins chosen at random in the sample . in general , as argued above , they will be far apart . now , unlike the usual two - impurity kondo problem , these two spins will have _ different _ coupling constants @xmath206 and @xmath207 and , therefore , two different kondo scales @xmath208 and @xmath209 .",
    "the rkky scale @xmath210 , apart from the dependence on the distance between the spins .",
    "now , in the conventional two - impurity kondo problem , where @xmath211 , one has , qualitatively , two independent kondo screening processes , one at each spin , when @xmath212 , whereas the effect will be suppressed when @xmath213 . in our disordered case , rkky dominates if , say , @xmath214 .",
    "however , in the intermediate case when @xmath215 , two independent kondo effects will survive , even though @xmath216 is still larger than one of the kondo temperatures .",
    "indeed , as one comes down in energy scale , by the time one hits @xmath216 , spin @xmath80 has already undergone quenching and is no longer available to correlate into a singlet - like composite with spin @xmath217 .",
    "therefore , the rkky effectiveness depends on the random selection of two spins , both of which must have low enough kondo temperatures .",
    "we would thus expect it to be of order @xmath218 .",
    "naturally , the transitions between different regimes are all crossovers ( in the absence of special unphysical symmetries ) and there will be no sharp distinctions between the different cases and hence no sharp cutoff to the distribution function @xmath48 .",
    "we have emphasized throughout our analysis the importance of the structure of the distribution of kondo temperatures , in particular , whether it intercepts the vertical axis at @xmath187 or not . due to the exponential dependence of @xmath53 on the f - parameters , very small modifications in the width of the bare distribution lead to rather large changes in the distribution of kondo temperatures .",
    "if the bare width is too small , @xmath48 will be negligible at low @xmath53 , whereas , if it is too large , @xmath48 will be divergent .",
    "therefore , the situation where @xmath48 can be taken as approximately constant when @xmath49 only holds in a narrow window of bare disorder widths , in our current approach . in a more speculative vein ,",
    "one is tempted to think that the rkky interaction , which is left out of the current approach , might intervene to impose an upper bound on the density of low-@xmath53 spins which are allowed to exist in such a state .",
    "it would do so by effectively eliminating them through the formation of random singlets@xcite .",
    "finally , by treating the disorder seen by the conduction electrons in a mean - field cpa - like fashion , we have neglected the effects of fluctuations in the conduction electron density of states .",
    "it is natural to expect that these effects might act to further renormalize the distribution of kondo temperatures",
    ". it would be interesting to study whether , like in many other treatments of disordered systems@xcite , these effects lead to a flow towards a universal form of the distribution function .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have presented a complete picture of the possible origin of the non - fermi liquid behavior in kondo alloys .",
    "our study has shown the important effect correlations have on the role of disorder in f - electron systems , considerably enhancing the bare f - shell disorder strength .",
