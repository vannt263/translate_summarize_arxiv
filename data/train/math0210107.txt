    "recently , kontsevich @xcite provided a deformation quantization of the algebra of functions on an arbitrary poisson manifold .",
    "the key ingredient of his construction is the quantization formula for @xmath1 , which is then extended to the case of general manifolds using formal geometry .",
    "the terms of the star product are identified with certain feynman graphs , and their coefficients ( `` weights '' ) are given by some complicated integrals ( involving certain pullbacks of the standard volume form on a torus over the corresponding configuration spaces ) .    the first non - trivial case of kontsevich s construction is for a linear poisson brackets , i.e. poisson structures on a dual of a lie algebra . in this paper we consider only this case ( see section [ sub : problems ] for a discussion ) .    removal of the two external vertices splits any graph appearing in the definition of the star product into several connected components .",
    "the weight of a graph is the product of weights of its connected components . in a linear case",
    "each of them may have at most one cycle , which should consist of oriented edges .",
    "it turns out that one may restrict the class of graphs in kontsevich s construction to trees , excluding graphs with a non - trivial first homology .",
    "the weights of these tree graphs coincide with the coefficients of the usual gutt s star product @xcite arising from the campbell - baker - hausdorff formula @xcite .",
    "thus kontsevich s quantization differs from the cbh - formula essentially only by the contributions of graphs with one cycle , in particular of the so - called `` wheels '' ( see section [ sub : wheels ] ) .",
    "an important problem related to kontsevich s construction for @xmath2 is to interpret geometrically , and show a way to compute , the weights of graphs . in some partial cases",
    "such computations were done in @xcite . however , these direct computations are complicated and not illuminating .",
    "one of the reasons for a lack of a geometrical interpretation of these integrals seems to be that some special properties of the standard angle form on @xmath3 are significantly involved in kontsevich s proofs .",
    "thus two natural questions are whether other 1-forms on @xmath3 also lead to an associative star product , and if yes , how do these products depend on the choice of a form .",
    "we answer both questions in the linear case .",
    "first we show than any 1-form on @xmath3 gives an associative star product .",
    "this is done by an interpretation of the associativity as a vanishing of some cocycle in the relative top cohomology of a grand configuration space @xmath4 .",
    "these spaces are obtained by gluing together the configuration spaces corresponding to graphs along their boundary strata .",
    "these boundary strata are of two types : principal and hidden .",
    "the gluings along the principal strata are done according to the jacobi relation .",
    "hidden strata are zipped - up , i.e. glued to itself by some involutions . by choosing singular forms",
    "concentrated in one point on a torus , one gets star products with rational coefficients ( with a straightforward estimate on the denominators ) .",
    "these coefficients can be computed by a simple combinatorial count .",
    "we then turn to a problem of comparison of these star products .",
    "this is done in a similar fashion , by identifying terms in these star products with some fixed top cohomology class of a similar grand configuration space @xmath5 .",
    "this identification involves , however , a capping of some additional- external- boundary strata by the configuration spaces of the wheels .",
    "thus products for different differential forms on @xmath3 may differ only by the weights of the wheels .",
    "we show that the tree ( i.e. 0-loop ) part of all star products coincide and are equal to gutt s star product .",
    "we also show that any differential form supported on a semi - circle leads to gutt s product .",
    "the point of view of this paper was heavily motivated by a similar interpretation of the feynman series appearing in the perturbative chern - simons theory and used to produce a universal invariants of knots and 3-manifolds , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the construction of the star product considered in this note is quite similar ( in particular , it is interesting that a similar antisymmetry and jacobi relations appear in the gluing construction ) , although there are of course few differences ( in the chern - simons theory the edges are not oriented , all vertices are trivalent- which implies a simple involution argument showing the vanishing of the hidden strata- and the spaces after gluing are closed ) .",
    "there is a clear common denominator in these constructions ; in fact , this note was initiated as a check that the same technique may be applied .",
    "i believe that this technique of producing grand configuration spaces by gluings is quite powerful ; it would be quite interesting to find some other applications .    while i strongly believe that the approach used in this paper can be applied for general poisson structures ,",
    "the zip - up argument of section [ sub : grand ] for hidden faces then works only up to degree six , so a new argument is needed to prove a conjecture about vanishing of the weights of the hidden strata .",
    "when this paper was already finished , the author found a modification of this construction which works for quadratic poisson structures ( to be discussed in a forthcoming paper ) .",
    "the general case , however , still remains open .",
    "througout the paper we will deal with graphs @xmath6 such that    * the edges of @xmath6 are oriented ; * the set of vertices of @xmath6 is subdivided into two disjoint subsets : the _ internal _ vertices @xmath7 and the _ external _ vertices @xmath8 ; * the set of external vertices is ordered ; * @xmath6 does not contain double or looped edges .    an _ orientation _ of @xmath6 is an ordering of outgoing edges in each vertex , up to a negation in any two vertices .",
    "following kontsevich @xcite , we will call an oriented graph @xmath6 _ admissible _ if    * exactly two edges start in each internal vertex , and no edges start in any external vertex .",
    "since we will deal primarily with the linear case , i.e. the poisson brackets on a dual of a lie algebra , we define a _ lie - admissible _ graph as an ( oriented ) admissible graph such that    * in each internal vertex there ends at most one edge .",
    "note that this condition implies that each connected component of a graph obtained from @xmath6 by a removal of all external vertices is either a tree , or contains one cycle , which consists of oriented edges .",
    "denote by @xmath9 the set of all lie - admissible graphs with @xmath10 internal and @xmath11 external vertices .",
    "for example , @xmath12 is generated by the graph with two ( external ) vertices and no edges .",
    "the `` wedge '' graph with one internal vertex connected to two external vertices by a pair of edges ( see the graph @xmath13 of figure [ comp_fig ] ) , gives two generators of @xmath14 , which differ by the ordering of the edges .",
    "denote @xmath15 .",
    "note that the orientation of a graph with a set @xmath16 of edges induces an orientation of @xmath17 as in @xcite : choose an arbitrary ordering of all internal vertices and then take ordered pairs of edges starting at @xmath18-st , @xmath19-nd , etc .",
    ", vertex . for technical reasons ( namely , the jacobi relation for labelled graphs ) we will often need to consider more general orderings of @xmath16 .",
    "a _ labelled graph _ is an admissible graph endowed with an arbitrary ordering of its edges , compatible with the above orientation of @xmath20 .",
    "[ labels_rem ] note that our labellings are more general than in @xcite : we consider _ all _ orderings of edges , so for a non - oriented graph with @xmath10 internal vertices and no nontrivial automorphisms the number of labellings is @xmath21 . picking an orientation of @xmath6 cuts this number in half . in general we should also take into account the number of automorphisms of @xmath6 ( preserving the order of external vertices ) , so the number of different labellings of an oriented graph is @xmath22 .",

    "there is an obvious forgetful map @xmath24 ; abusing notation , we will denote the image of @xmath6 also by @xmath6 .",
    "there are several important operations on graphs .",
    "firstly , there is a product @xmath25 : we define @xmath26 to be the graph obtained by juxtaposition of @xmath6 and @xmath13 , followed by the identification of their external vertices",
    ". see figure [ comp_fig]a .",
    "this makes @xmath27 into a semigroup . in particular ,",
    "@xmath28 is generated by @xmath10-spiked `` wheels '' , i.e. by graphs with @xmath10 interior vertices forming an oriented cycle of edges and connected to the exterior vertex by @xmath10 spikes , see figure [ wheels_fig]a .",
    "secondly , there is a composition @xmath29 , @xmath30 of two admissible graphs @xmath31 , @xmath32 defined by inserting @xmath13 in @xmath33-th external vertex of @xmath6 .",
    "this insertion is done in the following way .",
    "cut out a small disc surrounding the @xmath33-th external vertex @xmath34 of @xmath6 and place there a small copy of @xmath13 .",
    "now , sum over all possible ways of attaching the incoming edges of @xmath34 to the vertices of @xmath13 , which result in a lie - admissible graph .",
    "see figure [ comp_fig]b .",
    "the external vertices of @xmath35 are ordered in a natural way : @xmath36 .",
    "we may combine all @xmath37 s into one composition on the vector space @xmath38 over @xmath39 spanned by @xmath40 : @xmath41    while non - associative , this operation defines a pre - lie structure on @xmath38 , i.e. , for any @xmath42 we have @xmath43 hence the bracket @xmath44=g\\circ g'-g'\\circ g$ ] defines a lie algebra structure on @xmath38 .    in a similar way",
    ", one may define a co - product on @xmath38 by @xmath45 , where the summation is over all lie - admissible subgraphs @xmath13 of @xmath6 s.t .",
    "the quotient graph @xmath46 ( obtained by shrinking @xmath13 into a point ) is also lie - admissible .",
    "all above operations may be also defined on labelled graphs in an obvious way .",
    "let @xmath47 be a bi - vector field on an open domain @xmath48 in @xmath1 . in the coordinates @xmath49 ,",
    "@xmath50 on @xmath2 it is given by @xmath51 , where @xmath52 .",
    "to each admissible graph @xmath31 we assign a polydifferential operator @xmath53 as in @xcite .",
    "namely , put @xmath54 at each internal vertex @xmath55 of @xmath6 and put the corresponding derivatives @xmath56 and @xmath57 at two edges starting at @xmath55 .",
    "thus we have a derivative @xmath58 assigned to each edge of @xmath6 , and a tensor @xmath59 at each internal vertex .",
    "we will call such an assignment a _ state _ of @xmath6 .",
    "finally , put a function @xmath60 at @xmath33-th external vertex , @xmath30 .",
    "the operator @xmath61 is defined by the following formula :    @xmath62 where @xmath63 denotes the set of incoming edges of a vertex @xmath55 .",
    "for example , for the graph @xmath6 in the left hand side of figure [ comp_fig ] we have @xmath64    if @xmath47 is linear , its second derivatives vanish , so @xmath65 for any graph @xmath6 which contains a vertex with at least two incoming edges .",
    "thus in the linear case it suffices to consider only lie - admissible graphs .",
    "we put @xmath66 if two admissible graphs",
    "@xmath6 , @xmath13 differ only by the ordering of two edges starting in some internal vertex . here is a graphical version of this _ antisymmetry relation _ ( @xmath67 ) : @xmath68 here and further on , in figures at each internal vertex we use the ordering of two outgoing edges induced by the orientation of the plane , unless specified otherwise .",
    "we impose the following _ jacobi relation _ on admissible graphs : @xmath69 in the relations above all graphs are assumed to coincide outside the small disk shown in the figure",
    ". there may be some incoming edges entering the disk ; the summation in the jacobi relation is over all possible ways to connect these incoming edges to two depicted vertices .",
    "e.g. , if there are two incoming edges , four different ways to connect these edges to two depicted vertices will give @xmath70 terms in the jacobi relation .",
    "for lie - admissible graphs the situation is simpler : there may be at most one incoming edge and the unique way to connect it , so we have @xmath71    there are also obvious `` labelled '' versions of these relations for graphs in @xmath23 .",
    "denote by @xmath72 the vector space over @xmath39 generated by graphs in @xmath9 modulo the @xmath67 and jacobi relations , and set @xmath73 . for @xmath31 denote by @xmath74 $ ] its image in @xmath72 ( we will also use @xmath74 $ ] for the image of @xmath75 under the composition of the forgetful map and the above quotient map ) .",
    "[ eq_lem ] each composition @xmath37 of graphs factors through relations , , thus defines a quotient map",

    "it is also obvious that @xmath81=0 $ ] when @xmath13 and @xmath82 differ by the ordering of two outgoing edges in one vertex .",
    "the only check which may cause a moment thought is that @xmath83=0 $ ] where @xmath84 is a linear combination of graphs appearing in the left hand side of equation .",
    "this , however , readily follows from the fact that in the definition of @xmath37 we sum over all possible attachments of the incoming edges of @xmath33-th external vertex of @xmath6 to vertices of @xmath84 , in particular to the vertices appearing in equation ) .",
    "the reason to call and `` antisymmetry and jacobi relations '' is quite simple :    [ b_lem ] let @xmath47 be a poisson bi - vector field",
    ". then the map @xmath85 factors through relations , , thus defines a quotient map @xmath86 of @xmath87 to polydifferential operators .    clearly , is the graphical version of the antisymmetry relation for @xmath47 . equation with no incoming edges is exactly a graphical version of the jacobi identity for @xmath47 .",
    "similarly , with several incoming edges corresponds to taking higher derivatives of the jacobi identity .",
    "consider the standard upper half - plane @xmath90 as the hyperbolic plane with the lobachevsky metric , and the real line @xmath91 ( together with the point @xmath92 ) as the absolute .",
    "denote by @xmath93 the compactified space @xmath94 .    for a ( either labelled or not ) graph @xmath6 with @xmath95 internal and @xmath96 external vertices , let @xmath97 be the space of embeddings @xmath98 of the vertex set of @xmath6 , such that @xmath99 , and @xmath100 preserving the order of @xmath8 .",

    "notice also , that the space @xmath133 , and may be identified with the circle @xmath134 after an identification of @xmath112 with @xmath135 .",
    "suppose now that one of the vertices of a one - edge graph is external .",
    "the corresponding configuration space is an interval ; in the model above it may be identified either with the semicircle @xmath130 ( if @xmath119 is external ) or with the interval @xmath136 ( if @xmath121 is external ) .",
    "finally , suppose that both vertices are external . in this case",
    "the space @xmath137 is a point and may be identified in the model above with one of the endpoints of the interval @xmath136 , depending on the direction of the edge ( or , equivalently , with the endpoints of the semicircle @xmath130 ) .",
    "thus various boundary strata of @xmath123 actually correspond to all possible configuration spaces of pairs of points .",
    "the space @xmath123 has the homotopy type of @xmath3 .",
    "we will call a map @xmath138 an _ angle map _",
    ", if it is identity on @xmath134 , maps the whole of @xmath130 to @xmath139 , and maps @xmath136 onto @xmath3 surgectively .",
    "an angle map used in @xcite is defined as follows .",
    "let @xmath140 be a pair of points .",
    "compute the angle between the direction from @xmath141 to @xmath92 and the direction from @xmath141 to @xmath142 in the hyperbolic geometry on @xmath93 ( see figure [ angle_fig]a ) .",
    "a simple check shows that this map is @xmath106-invariant and indeed determines an angle map .",
    "here is another simple example of an angle map : for @xmath143 as above , take the angle between the direction from @xmath142 to @xmath144 and from @xmath142 to @xmath141 in the euclidean geometry on @xmath145 ( see figure [ angle_fig]b ) .",
    "we will fix some angle map @xmath146 for the remaining part of the paper .      for an edge @xmath147 of a labelled graph @xmath6 , an evaluation map @xmath148 is obtained by forgetting all vertices of @xmath6 except for the ends of @xmath147 .",
    "a gauss map @xmath149 is a composition of @xmath150 with the angle map @xmath146 . taking the map",
    "@xmath151 for each edge @xmath152 and using the ordering of edges , we get the product gauss map @xmath153 .",
    "we shall construct compactification @xmath154 of @xmath109 so that @xmath155 will extend to @xmath154 .",
    "the minimal construction is to take the closure of the graph of @xmath156 in @xmath157 ; unfortunately it is rather hard to describe explicitly .",
    "another extreme ( `` overblown '' ) solution is to blow up all diagonals of @xmath105 ; this compactification was used in @xcite .",
    "the map @xmath155 obviously extends to any of the above compactifications .",
    "following @xcite , we will consider an intermediate solution : to blow up only the diagonals of @xmath105 corresponding to subgraphs of @xmath6 which are 2-connected ( this is somewhat smaller than in @xcite , where blow ups were done for all connected subgraphs ) . here",
    "a graph is _",
    "2-connected _ ( or rather vertex-2-connected ) , if it remains connected after a removal of any one of its vertices .",
    "in particular an edge is 2-connected .",
    "the resulting space @xmath154 is a manifold with corners .",
    "the boundary strata look as follows .",
    "each codimension one face of @xmath154 corresponds to a collision of all vertices of a vertex - one - connected subgraph @xmath79 of @xmath6 . both the face and the restriction of the gauss map to it",

    "the second factor encodes the way the vertices of @xmath79 approach each other , seen through a `` magnifying glass '' ( called a _ screen _ by fulton and macpherson ) .",
    "more generally , a stratum of codimension @xmath160 corresponds to a collection of @xmath160 vertex - one - connected subgraphs @xmath161 of @xmath6 , each two of which are either nested ( i.e. contained in one another ) or disjoint .",
    "such a stratum is adjacent to all strata of codimension @xmath162 obtained by removing one of @xmath161 s from the collection .",
    "consider the disjoint union @xmath163 of configuration spaces and the map @xmath164 .",

    "some boundary strata are easy to take care of ; namely , we shall not care for any strata which are    * of codimension two or more in @xmath165 , or * mapped to @xmath168 with a loss of dimension ( i.e. the difference between the dimensions of the source and the image ) two or more , or * mapped to the union @xmath169 of all coordinate hyperspaces @xmath170 .",
    "we will simply relativize these strata including them in a singular locus @xmath171 and considering then @xmath172 .",
    "let us describe the gluing / relativizing process for various types of boundary faces of @xmath165 .",
    "firstly , there are the _ principal internal faces _ , where two internal vertices of a graph @xmath6 connected by one edge @xmath147 collide together .",
    "note that the same principal face @xmath173 appears in each of the three graphs related by the jacobi relation , as shown in figure [ main_fig ] , where the colliding vertices are indicated by a dashed circle ( and a possible incoming edge is also dashed ) .",
    "thus we can glue these faces of three graphs of figure [ main_fig ] together .    secondly , there are the _ hidden internal faces _",
    "@xmath174 , where several internal vertices of a connected subgraph @xmath79 of @xmath6 ( with more than one edge ) collide together .",
    "a simple dimension counting shows that unless the number of edges starting in @xmath79 and ending in @xmath175 is two or three , the loss of dimension under the map is at least two on one of the two factors , so the face is readily relativized .",
    "also , unless @xmath79 is 2-connected , @xmath176 loses at least one dimension under @xmath155 ( since the dilatations of one of the parts into which a cut - vertex splits @xmath79 preserve @xmath155 ) , so such a face can again be relativized .",
    "the remaining hidden faces have an orientation reversing involution which preserves @xmath155 , thus can be zipped - up ( i.e. glued to itself by this involution ) following an idea of @xcite .",
    "indeed , pick a vertex @xmath55 in @xmath79 with an edge ending in @xmath175 .",
    "any vertex of a lie - admissible graph has valence at most three ; moreover , @xmath79 is 2-connected , thus any vertex @xmath177 with an edge ending in @xmath175 has precisely two edges @xmath178 and @xmath179 with @xmath180 .",
    "the involution of @xmath55 w.r.t .",
    "the middle of the interval connecting @xmath119 and @xmath121 ( i.e. @xmath181 , if we think about @xmath55 , @xmath119 and @xmath121 as points in @xmath112 ) , followed by the reordering of @xmath182 and @xmath183 reverses the orientation of this boundary face , but preserves @xmath155 .",
    "thirdly , there are the _ infinity faces _",
    ", where some internal vertices of a connected subgraph @xmath79 of @xmath6 approach the absolute line @xmath131 , but remain distant from the external vertices .",
    "then any edge starting in @xmath79 and ending in @xmath175 is mapped to 0 , thus such faces can again be relativized .    finally , there are the _ external faces _ , where the vertices of a connected subgraph @xmath79 of @xmath6 which collide together contain @xmath184 external vertices .",
    "again , if there is an edge starting in @xmath79 and ending in @xmath175 , it is mapped to 0 , thus such faces can be relativized . in the remaining cases the situation depends on @xmath160 . if @xmath185 or @xmath186 , then the map @xmath187 or @xmath188 respectively has a loss of at least two dimensions , so again can be relativized",
    "we are left , however , with the case @xmath189 .",
    "we can still get rid of at least some of these faces .",
    "namely , if the graph @xmath190 has a double edge @xmath191 , we zip up a pair of faces corresponding to ( a collapse of a subgraph @xmath79 of ) two graphs @xmath6 and @xmath192 which differ only by the ordering of @xmath182 and @xmath183 . indeed ,",
    "the maps @xmath155 and @xmath193 differ only by a transposition of two factors of @xmath3 in @xmath168 , so coincide up to a sign on the diagonal @xmath191 .    to sum it up : the only boundary faces of @xmath166 ( which are not included in the singular locus @xmath171 ) are the external faces",
    ", corresponding to subgraphs @xmath194 of a graph @xmath31 which contain exactly two external and any number @xmath160 of internal vertices , all edges starting in @xmath79 also end there , and @xmath190 does not have double edges .",
    "in other words ,    [ prop : dd][cf .",

    "the restriction of @xmath198 to such a face is @xmath199    we will use this crucial fact in section [ sub:3v ] below , and then again in section [ sub : compare - bad ] .",

    "we used the antisymmetry relation again to zip up the external faces corresponding to graphs with double edges .",

    "it will be important to note that if @xmath236 is chosen so that @xmath240 , then by the stokes theorem we can compute the weights also as @xmath241 .",

    "let @xmath47 be a linear poisson bi - vector field on an open domain @xmath315 , defining a poisson structure on the algebra @xmath316 of smooth functions on @xmath48 .",

    "returning to the computations of the coefficients of @xmath262 in section [ sub : small ] we see that @xmath319 moreover , translating the statement @xmath301 of proposition [ prop : zz ] to the language of differential operators , we readily obtain      the above star product _ a priori _ depends on the initial choice of the 1-form @xmath250 on @xmath3 .",
    "it is easy to see directly from the definition that kontsevich s product @xcite corresponds to @xmath321 being the standard angle form on @xmath3 .",
    "if @xmath5 would have no boundary faces apart from the singular locus @xmath322 , then ( similarly to the case @xmath273 in section [ sub : small ] ) @xmath323 could be interpreted as the relative degree of a map @xmath324 .",
    "let me clarify this point : while usually one thinks about the degree @xmath325 of a map @xmath326 between two manifolds being a number , one can equivalently think that it is a vector @xmath327 $ ] in a 1-dimensional vector space ( the top cohomology of @xmath304 , generated by the fundamental class @xmath328 $ ] of @xmath304 ) .",
    "equivalently , @xmath325 can be defined as a pull - back @xmath329)$ ] of the fundamental class of @xmath330 , since @xmath329)=\\deg f [ m]$ ] . in our",
    "setting @xmath304 is not a manifold , but a stratified space , so its top cohomology is not 1-dimensional , but is generated by graphs . while one can not any more define the degree as a number , the definition of degree as @xmath329)$ ] generalizes to this situation , with all usual advantages of presenting a topological value as a degree .",
    "unfortunately , this is not the case : the above degree is not well - defined , since in general @xmath5 has some boundary faces ( so when we change @xmath250 , the value of @xmath262 may change due to a `` flow '' through these faces ) .",
    "however , at least some partial steps on this way may be achieved .      to understand the boundary faces , note that there is an additional grading on the configuration space by the loop number of graphs . here",
    "the _ loop number _ @xmath332 of a graph @xmath6 is a number of connected components appearing after a removal from @xmath6 of both external vertices .",
    "indeed , the gluing relations and preserve the loop number .",
    "thus @xmath5 consists of non - connected components @xmath333 corresponding to graphs with @xmath334 .",
    "accordingly , any star product splits into pieces enumerated by the loop number of the corresponding graphs .",
    "gutt s star product corresponds to the 0-loop piece :      the first statement follows from the fact that the 0-loop part @xmath335 of the configuration space has no non - relativized boundary faces , so the scheme discussed in section [ sub : compare - good ] above works and the 0-loop part @xmath336 of @xmath323 is , up to a normalization by @xmath331 , a relative degree of the restriction of @xmath248 to @xmath337 .",
    "thus the 0-loop part of all star products are equal .",
    "now results of kathotia @xcite , who verified that for the standard angle 1-form on @xmath3 the coefficients of tree graphs coincide with the gutt product , imply the theorem .",
    "one can also verify this directly , in a purely combinatorial manner , computing the coefficients by counting the algebraic number of preimages in @xmath338 of any regular value @xmath339 ( so up to normalization factor @xmath331 we will get integral coefficients ) .",
    "note , that this counting is to be performed with labelled graphs ; indeed , to pass to unlabelled graphs in section [ sub : two ] we used symmetries , thus would have to deal with ( not regular ) values on the diagonal of @xmath168 .",
    "a lengthy , but rather routine calculation ( using proposition [ prop : ln ] for @xmath340 ) shows that it indeed gives gutt s product .",
    "this is illustrated in the example [ sub : preimage ] below .",
    "let us compute the coefficients of 0-loop graphs for @xmath341 , see figure [ fig : n2]a .",
    "the easiest way to perform calculations is to pick a regular value @xmath342 very close to the diagonal .",
    "say , let us take @xmath343 .",
    "when @xmath344 , the value approaches the diagonal and internal vertices of graphs in the preimages tend to the infinity on @xmath345 . for small @xmath346",
    "the edges connecting these vertices to the external vertices are almost euclidean straight lines , as illustrated in figure [ fig : n2]b .",
    "thus calculations may be done for simplicity in the euclidean geometry .",
    "the first graph of figure [ fig : n2]a is the square of the wedge graph ( it splits into two copies of the wedge graph after the removal of the external vertices ) , thus its coefficient should be @xmath347 in view of proposition [ prop : ln ] .",
    "this is equally easy to verify diectly : out of the total of 12 different labellings of 4 edges by @xmath348 exactly 3 ( namely @xmath349 , @xmath350 , @xmath351 and @xmath352 ) give a preimage .",
    "it is also easy to check that for all of them the local degree is @xmath353 , so the coefficient is indeed @xmath354 .    as for the second graph of figure [ fig : n2]a , out of the total of 24 different labellings exactly 4 give a preimage , see figure [ fig : preimage ] .",
    "this is due to elementary geometrical / combinatorial reasons .",
    "consider the internal vertex @xmath55 for which one of the starting edges ends in the second internal vertex .",
    "obviously , both edges starting in @xmath55 should eminate at angles which are either both smaller or both greater than the angle of the edge @xmath147 connecting their ends .",
    "in other words , this pair of edges should have labels either both smaller or both greater than the label of @xmath147 ; see figure [ fig : preimage ] .",
    "it is easy to check that there are only 4 such labellings , depicted in figure [ fig : preimage ] .",
    "it is also easy to check that the local degree of exactly one of them ( the last labelling in figure [ fig : preimage ] ) is @xmath355 , thus the coefficient is @xmath356 .    by a similar inductive combinatorial arguments one can calculate the numbers of preimages of 0-loop graphs with higher @xmath10 ( getting modified bernulli numbers ) .",
    "direct visualization of preimages becomes hard for @xmath357 since numbers of labellings ( as well as denominators ) grow too fast : for @xmath358 it is already @xmath359 .          without a loss of generality ,",
    "suppose that the form is supported on the lower semicircle @xmath361 .",
    "now , the weight of any graph which contains an oriented cycle is zero , since such a cycle should contain an edge directed upwards . but",
    "in the linear case each graph with non - zero loop number contains such a cycle .",
    "thus only 0-loop graphs contribute to the star product .",
    "in other cases , the situation is more complicated and at present i fall short of computing the weights of graphs with non - zero loop numbers for arbitrary 1-forms on @xmath3 .",
    "the remaining part of this note thus has a preliminary character .",
    "its purpose is to explain how a computation of weights of graphs with loops ( and two external vertices ) can be done instead using so - called wheels , which are graphs of the type depicted in figure [ wheels_fig]c .",
    "this gives a possibility to compute kontsevich s weights of graphs with loops via a purely combinatorial count ( see section [ sub : twospike ] below for an example ) .",
    "the above reasoning may be repeated for general @xmath10 .",
    "indeed , let us return to the study of the boundary faces of @xmath5 . by proposition [ prop : dd ] , these faces correspond to decompositions @xmath362 where @xmath363 , thus is a wheel ( or a product of wheels ) and @xmath364",
    "let us cap - off the boundary faces by some new auxiliary configuration spaces . recall that passing to @xmath340 instead of @xmath262 , we can reduce our consideration only to connected graphs ; thus it would suffice to produce a @xmath288-dimensional space @xmath365 with @xmath366 for each wheel @xmath367 .    for this purpose",
    "let us take a space of all embeddings of the vertex set of @xmath6 in @xmath93 , modulo the 2-dimensional group @xmath106 of translations and homotheties of @xmath93 , and construct its compactification @xmath365 similarly to section [ sub : gauss ] .",
    "this time there are no restrictions on the location of the external vertex @xmath55 and it is free to run over @xmath107 .",
    "thus @xmath368 , and @xmath109 can be realized as an infinity boundary face of @xmath365 corresponding to all embeddings for which @xmath369 and the other vertices remain in @xmath107 .",
    "an example of a wheel @xmath370 and points in the corresponding configuration spaces @xmath109 and @xmath365 are shown in figures [ wheels_fig]a , [ wheels_fig]b , and [ wheels_fig]c , respectively .",
    "if @xmath365 would have no other boundary faces , we would be done .",
    "so , let us try to get rid of all other strata of @xmath371 .",
    "other infinity faces are easy to get rid of : when some internal vertices approach @xmath131 ( probably together with @xmath55 ) , some edges @xmath147 map under @xmath151 to @xmath139 , so the image of @xmath372 belongs to @xmath169 and the corresponding face may be relativised . also , we can easily get rid of almost all internal ( principal and hidden ) faces : when vertices of a proper subgraph @xmath79 of @xmath6 collide together , @xmath190 contains some multiple edges , so @xmath190 and hence also @xmath373 vanish due to the antisymmetry relation .",
    "but when _ all _ vertices of @xmath6 collide together , we get the problematic _ anomaly _ face @xmath374 , which is the space of all embeddings of the vertex set of @xmath6 in @xmath112 modulo the action of @xmath375 .    there are various ways to deal with the anomaly face .",
    "one of them ( not very elegant , but working ) is as follows : let us consider a graph @xmath13 obtained from @xmath6 by the reversal of directions of all edges , see figure [ wheels_fig]d .",
    "the corresponding compactified configuration space @xmath376 of all embeddings of the vertex set of @xmath13 in @xmath107 is of course the same @xmath365 .",
    "however , the map @xmath377 differs from @xmath372 .",
    "this time we may relativise it on all faces ( including the infinite face where only @xmath55 approaches @xmath131 ) , except for the anomaly face corresponding to collision of all vertices . but on this anomaly face @xmath377 coincides with @xmath372 up to reflections of some copies of @xmath3 in @xmath168 .",
    "so , folding each copy of @xmath3 in two by identifying @xmath378 with @xmath379 ( or , equivalently , doubling the angle map @xmath380 ) , we get the maps @xmath381 and @xmath382 to agree on the anomaly face .",
    "thus we may glue @xmath383 and @xmath154 along the anomaly face , getting a space with the only non - relativised boundary face being the required one .",
    "this finishes the cap - off construction .",
    "there is only one ( up to a choice of an orientation ) graph @xmath384 with @xmath385 , see figure [ two_fig]a .",
    "the only boundary face of @xmath386 which was not relativized or zipped - up corresponds to collision of the two external vertices of @xmath79 , see figures [ two_fig]b .",
    "this face may be identified with @xmath109 , where @xmath387 is a wheel with two spikes , shown in figure [ two_fig]c .",
    "we cap - off this boundary face as described above , using an auxiliary 4-dimensional configuration space @xmath365 , see figure [ two_fig]d .",
    "the only boundary faces of @xmath365 which are not mapped to the singular locus @xmath388 are @xmath389 ( correspondng to the vertex @xmath55 of @xmath6 approaching @xmath131 ) and the anomaly face @xmath374 ( corresponding to all vertices of @xmath6 colliding together ) . in this example",
    "we can get rid of the anomaly face without using @xmath376 , simply by folding each copy of @xmath3 in @xmath390 in two ( identifying @xmath391 with @xmath392 ) .",
    "after we get rid of the last boundary face @xmath109 of @xmath176 by gluing to it @xmath365 , we may apply the scheme of section [ sub : compare - good ] to compute the relative degree of the map @xmath393 . for any volume form @xmath250 on @xmath394",
