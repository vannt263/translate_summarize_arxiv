    "the peculiar hgmn , am , and magnetic ap stars are now thought to be reasonably well understood , but the same can not be said about the @xmath0 boo stars .",
    "these objects have caii k and metallic - line types near a0 , weak mgii @xmath04481 lines , and h lines with cores typical of early to late a - type stars , but often with shallow wings .",
    "relative to the balmer line cores the k and metal line types are too early - the stars are metal weak ( gray 1988 ) .",
    "quantitative measurements suggest that cno abundances are approximately normal while fe , mg , ca and other elements are underabundant by up to 2 dex ( venn & lambert 1990 ; strenburg 1993 ) .",
    "several ideas have been put forward in the last few years to explain the @xmath0 boo phenomenon .",
    "venn & lambert s ( 1990 ) observation that the abundances of elements in 3 members of the class are similar to that of interstellar gas depleted by the formation of grains has led to a promising model developed by charbonneau ( 1991 ) and turcotte & charbonneau ( 1993 ) in which the @xmath0 boo stars are accreting mass at a rate on the order of @xmath1 yr@xmath2 .    if the @xmath0 boo stars have accreted their atmospheres , this theory predicts that members of the class should be accreting in the present epoch and therefore many of them may be near the zams .",
    "since asteroseismology has the potential to provide direct measurements of the evolutionary state of pulsating stars , our recent discovery of nonradial pulsation ( nrp ) in the @xmath0 boo star hd 111604 encouraged us to complete a spectroscopic search for nrp in all members of the class observable from the canada - france - hawaii telescope .",
    "our program objects are listed in table [ stars ] , and as an examination of the table reveals , positive detection of nrp has been obtained in 50% of the 18 observed @xmath0 boo stars .    .program star data . [ cols=\">,<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "one of the more prominent @xmath0 boo nonradial pulsators is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . where the length of the time series for a particular star warrants , we have attempted to estimate feature crossing times , @xmath3 t , principal modes , @xmath4 , assuming sectorial modes , and the time it takes for one wave to travel around the star , @xmath5 .",
    "these values are tabulated in table [ stars ] . also of interest is the fact that most of the nonradial pulsators are also photometric variables .",
    "( see the column labeled `` phot .",
    "var . ? '' in the table [ stars ] for upper limits in photometric variability for stars in which no photometric varations have been observed . )",
    "photometric periods are given in the last column of the table where known .",
    "hd 30422 , hd 111604 , hd 192640 , and hd 210111 have the highest amplitude nrp among our program stars . of these",
    ", hd 192640 ( 29 cyg ) has v=4.92 which makes it very attractive as a target for future multisite photometric and spectroscopic campaigns .",
    "hd 31295 , hd 111604 , hd 183324 , and hd 221756 also warrant consideration as bright ( @xmath6 ) pulsators .",
    "we also would like to encourage additional photometric observations of @xmath0 boo itself ."
