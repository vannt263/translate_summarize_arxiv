    "ferrimagnetism is a fundamental phenomenon in the field of magnetism .",
    "the simplest case of the conventional ferrimagnetism is the ground state of the mixed spin chain .",
    "for example , there is an ( @xmath1 , @xmath2)=(1/2 , 1 ) mixed spin chain with a nearest - neighbor antiferromagnetic ( af ) isotropic interaction . in this system , the so - called lieb - mattis ( lm)-type ferrimagnetism@xcite is realized in the ground state because two different spins are arranged alternately in a line owing to the af interaction .",
    "since this type of ferrimagnetism has been studied extensively , the magnetic properties and the occurrence mechanism of the lm ferrimagnetism are well known . in particular , the ferrimagnetism in the quantum heisenberg spin model on the bipartite lattice without frustration is well understood within the marshall - lieb - mattis ( mlm ) theorem@xcite . in the lm ferrimagnetic ground state , the spontaneous magnetization occurs and the magnitude is fixed to a simple fraction of the saturated magnetization .    in recent years , a new type of ferrimagnetism , which is clearly different from lm ferrimagnetism , has been found in the ground state of several one - dimensional frustrated heisenberg spin systems@xcite .",
    "the spontaneous magnetization in this new type of ferrimagnetism changes gradually with respect to the strength of frustration .",
    "the incommensurate modulation with long - distance periodicity in local magnetizations is also a characteristic behavior of the new type of ferrimagnetism .",
    "hereafter , we call the new type of ferrimagnetism the non - lieb - mattis ( nlm ) type . the mechanism of the occurrence of the nlm ferrimagnetism has not yet been clarified .    on the other hand , some candidates of the nlm ferrimagnetism among the two - dimensional ( 2d ) systems , for example , the mixed - spin @xmath3-@xmath4 heisenberg model on the square lattice@xcite and the @xmath0 heisenberg model on the union jack lattice@xcite , were reported .",
    "these 2d frustrated systems have the intermediate ground state , namely , the `` canted state '' , in which the spontaneous magnetization is changed when the inner interaction of the system is varied .",
    "it has not been , however , determined whether the incommensurate modulation with long - distance periodicity exists in the local magnetization of the canted state owing to the difficulty of treating these 2d frustrated systems numerically and theoretically .",
    "therefore , the relationships between the canted states of these 2d frustrated systems and the nlm ferrimagnetic state are still unclear .    under these circumstances ,",
    "recently , another candidate of the nlm ferrimagnetism among the 2d systems was reported in ref .",
    "[ kagome-2d ] in which the @xmath0 heisenberg model on the spatially anisotropic kagome lattice depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) was studied .",
    "a region of the intermediate - magnetization states is observed between the lm ferrimagnetism that is rigorously proved by the mlm theorem@xcite and the nonmagnetic state of the spatially isotropic kagome - lattice antiferromagnet in the absence of magnetic field@xcite .",
    "the local magnetization in the intermediate state of the kagome lattice was investigated by the exact diagonalization method , and it was reported that the local magnetization greatly depends on the position of the sites , although it is difficult to determine clearly whether the incommensurate modulation with long - distance periodicity is present .",
    "this result leads to the high expectation that the intermediate state of the spatially anisotropic kagome lattice is the nlm ferrimagnetic state .",
    "additional research is desirable to conclude that the intermediate state of this 2d system is the nlm ferrimagnetism .        in this paper",
    ", we study the ground - state properties of the @xmath0 heisenberg models on the quasi - one - dimensional ( q1d ) kagome strip lattices depicted in figs .",

    "we also note that the lattice shapes of strips in the present study are different from some kagome strips ( chains ) studied in refs .",
    "[ kagome - strip1]-[kagome - strip3 ] , where the nontrivial properties of kagome antiferromagnets were reported .",
    "according to the study in ref .",
    "[ kgm - stripe ] , it was already known that the nlm ferrimagnetism is realized in the ground state of the kagome strip lattice in fig .  [",

    "[ fig1](c ) and the lattice in fig .",

    "sections 5 and 6 are devoted to discussion and summary , respectively .",
    "we employ two reliable numerical methods : the exact diagonalization ( ed ) method and the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) method@xcite .",
    "the ed method is used to obtain precise physical quantities of finite - size clusters .",
    "this method does not suffer from the limitation of the cluster shape .",
    "it is applicable even to systems with frustration , in contrast to the quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) method coming across the so - called negative - sign problem for systems with frustration .",
    "the disadvantage of the ed method is the limitation that available system sizes are very small .",
    "thus , we should pay careful attention to finite - size effects in quantities obtained by this method .",
