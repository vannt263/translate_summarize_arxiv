    "in the past few years , extensive attention has been attracted to the investigation of cosmological perturbations @xcite beyond the linear order .",
    "the importance of studying non - linear perturbations comes two aspects .",
    "firstly , forthcoming experiments of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and large - scale structure ( lss ) will be able to detect the non - linear structures in these perturbations .",
    "the observational detection of the non - linearities through the statistical non - gaussianity ( see @xcite for a comprehensive review and @xcite for a review of recent observational progress ) of perturbations has become one the the primary targets of the cosmology . on the other hand , non - linearities , which encode the _ interactions _ in the early universe , would definitely bring us new understandings of both the early universe and the fundamental physics .",
    "a large amount of efforts have been devoted to the calculation of the statistics of curvature perturbation @xmath0 , like primordial bispectrum and trispectrum on large scales , pioneered by maldacena @xcite",
    ". however , these are not the observed non - gaussianities of ( e.g. ) cmb temperature anisotropies @xmath1 .",
    "conventionally , one may use the linear order relation @xmath2 to evaluate the angular bispectrum or trispectrum of cmb , assuming the contributions from the second - order or secondary effects are negligible comparing to the primordial ones @xcite . however , in light of increasingly precise observations , a full treatment of the higher - order radiation transfer functions of the cmb anisotropies is needed , which will allow us to make definite prediction of cmb non - gaussianities ( see @xcite for a recent review for non - gaussianity on the cmb ) .",
    "the research on non - linear temperature anisotropy due to gravitational perturbations was pioneered by @xcite , in which the second - order generalization of sachs - wolfe ( sw ) effect and integrated sachs - wolfe ( isw ) effect were derived .",
    "these results were extended in @xcite where the second - order radiation transfer function on large scales was calculated , and in @xcite where the general expression for anisotropy due to gravitational perturbations up to the third - order and in @xcite where an elegant and non - perturbative non - linear anisotropy were got .",
    "the non - linear anisotropies have also been analyzed in @xcite base on the covariant approach to cosmological perturbations ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "various secondary contributions to the non - gaussianities have also been extensively studied , including the weak gravitational lensing and its correlation with isw effect @xcite , which is expected to be the dominant contamination of @xmath3 , correlation between lensing and sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect @xcite , inhomogeneous recombination @xcite , small - scale dark matter clustering @xcite . a systematic treatment of the transfer function on all scales , which involves solving the full boltzmann equations through the recombination phase and then from the surface of last - scattering until today , has been performed in @xcite at second - order .",
    "in this note , we calculate the cmb temperature anisotropy up to the third - order in primordial curvature perturbation @xmath0 , which can be viewed as non - linear generalization of linear - order relation @xmath4 .",
    "we follow the same strategy in @xcite .",
    "first , we calculate the gravitational redshift of a given photon from the emission surface to today s observer , which will give the observed anisotropy in terms of metric perturbations @xmath5 $ ] . then by using the conservation of curvature perturbation @xmath0 , in the large - scale limit",
    ", we determine the initial conditions for the metric perturbations in matter - dominated era , more precisely , the values @xmath6 $ ] and @xmath7 $ ] on the emission surface .",
    "combining these two procedures will give the final non - linear mapping from @xmath0 to @xmath1 : @xmath8 $ ] .",
    "together with previous results of primordial non - gaussianities of @xmath0 got in the literature , our formalism is ready to make prediction of the final observed cmb non - gaussianity .",
    "obviously , since we match the metric perturbations in matter era directly to those on the emission surface after last - scattering , our formalism includes only the gravitational redshift of photons , without considering the dynamics of photon - baryon plasma .",
    "thus our result is valid only for large - scale anisotropies , which enter the horizon after decoupling .",
    "this note is organized as follows . in the following section ,",
    "we describe the temperature anisotropy induced by the gravitational perturbations from the emission surface to the observers .",
    "we give the general expression for the temperature anisotropy up to the third - order in metric perturbations .",
    "in the next section , by using the conserved curvature perturbation and taking the large - scale limit , we determine the initial conditions for metric perturbations in matter - dominated era .",
    "then we give the non - linear mapping from primordial curvature perturbation to the temperature anisotropy , in the sachs - wolfe limit .",
    "finally we give a short conclusion .",
    "after decoupling , the cmb photon density remains as planck distribution , which is determined by a single parameter  the photon temperature .",
    "the temperature shift of a planck distribution of photons is exactly proportional to the energy shift of any given photon , i.e. @xmath9 , if there is no collision , which implies @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the final and initial temperature of the planck distribution respectively , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the final and initial energy of a given photon respectively .",
    "( [ et_shift ] ) is exact , which implies that in order to get the change in the temperature , we need to evaluate the change in the energy of a ( any ) given photon , which in our question is nothing but its gravitational redshift .",
    "thus , the question becomes to follow the geodesic equation of a given photon from the last - scattering surface to us , taking the inhomogeneous spacetime background into account .",
    "we work in the generalized poisson gauge @xmath15 where ] @xmath16 , @xmath17 is symmetric and satisfies @xmath18 ( thus @xmath19 ) , @xmath20 is the scale factor .",
    "the energy of a given photon with physical momentum @xmath21 measured by an observer with 4-velocity @xmath22 ( normalized as @xmath23 ) is and @xmath24 have the same null geodesics , but parameterized by different affine parameters @xmath25 and @xmath26 with relation @xmath27 .",

    "requires details of the dynamics during recombination .    assuming the  intrinsic \" photon temperature anisotropy at emission point @xmath46 in the direction @xmath47 takes the form @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the constant conformal time of emission , e.g. when the last - scattering takes place .",
    "the temperature measured by an observer at @xmath50 and in the direction @xmath51 is given by @xmath52 where we have used @xmath53 . from ( [ anisotropy_general ] )",
    "it is clear that the observed anisotropy comes from two aspects : the intrinsic anisotropy @xmath54 on the emission surface which depends on the dynamics during recombination and the gravity theory , the other is the gravitational redshift - induced anisotropy from the emission surface to the observer @xmath55 , which is purely kinetic and is independent of the theory of gravitation .",
    "the intrinsic anisotropy @xmath54 is highly model - dependent and a full treatment needs solving the set of boltzmann equations up to the third - order which is beyond the scope of this note . on super - horizon ( the sound horizon on the last - scattering surface )",
    "scales where microscopic physics is irrelevant , a simple and non - perturbative expression has been got @xcite : @xmath56 , which is adequate for our purpose .    in the following",
    ", first we derive the gravitational redshift - induced anisotropy up to the third - order in terms of metric perturbations in ( [ pert_metric ] ) , then use the einstein equation to determine the initial condition at matter - dominated era , i.e. the values of metric perturbations in terms of the conserved curvature perturbation @xmath0 on large scales .      after decoupling , the photons propagate freely and thus the physical content of its boltzmann equation is completely encoded in the photon geodesic equation , which is much simpler to deal with .",
    "null geodesics in perturbed spacetime has been investigated long before @xcite .",
    "although the whole thing we need to do is simply to follow the redshift of a photon , in a practical calculation , the complexities arise from several aspects .",

    "@xmath26 is the affine parameter along the photon geodesics , @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) is the corresponding values at emission surface ( observer ) .",
