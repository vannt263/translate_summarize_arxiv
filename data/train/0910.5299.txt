    "at present , there are @xmath019 known extrasolar planets with estimated masses between 0.03 and 0.12 , or between @xmath1 and @xmath2 @xmath3 . with one exception ",
    "ogle-05 - 169l b , at 2.8 au  all of the planets have semimajor axes smaller than 1 au , and so are reasonably called hot neptunes .",
    "in fact , with only one more exception , hd69830 d , all have semimajor axes @xmath4 au . to determine whether the objects are genuine neptunes , i.e.  ice giants , and not merely very large rocky bodies better thought of as super - earths , knowledge of the mean densities is required .",
    "three of these objects have known radii , and two have mean densities compatible with being a neptune - like body . gj436",
    "b @xcite has a density of @xmath5 @xcite , and hat - p-11 b @xcite has a density of @xmath6 ; compare neptune with @xmath7 .",
    "the hd69830 system @xcite is particularly interesting .",
    "it contains three neptune - like objects : hd69830 b at 0.0785 au , of 10.5 @xmath3@xmath8 and eccentricity 0.1 ; hd69380 c at 0.186 au , of 12.1 @xmath3@xmath8 and eccentricity 0.13 ; and hd69380 d at 0.63 au , of 18.4 @xmath3 , and eccentricity 0.07 ( @xmath9 , so a near - circular orbit is possible ) .",
    "the system was also reported to have a disc of warm infrared - emitting dust located between planets c and d @xcite , presumably due to a collisionally active remnant asteroid belt .",
    "more recent work @xcite suggests instead that the infrared excess is due to a debris disc outside the known planets at @xmath10 au , probably resulting from the breakup of an asteroid .",
    "this system clearly provides a rigorous test of planet formation and migration theories .",
    "indeed , short - period neptune - mass bodies have several advantages as probes of planetary origins .",
    "they are large enough to be observable , but small enough that we need not consider gravitational disc instability as a formation process .",
    "they are also large enough to undergo significant type i migration , but not so large that they can open a gap in the disc and undergo type ii migration @xcite .",
    "accordingly , hot neptunes can yield less ambiguous tests of type i migration than more massive planets which could have significantly perturbed the gas disc they were embedded in , and their existence provides strong evidence that some kind of type i migration is operating in protoplanetary discs .",
    "hot neptunes are therefore useful for exploring the intersection of the classical oligarchic core accretion picture ( @xcite ; e.g.  @xcite ) with type i migration @xcite .",
    "two main classes of scenario exist in the literature : one which concentrates on the atmospheric gas physics , and one which concentrates on the dynamics of the protoplanetary interactions .",
    "@xcite incorporate sophisticated atmospheric physics and follow the evolution of effectively isolated cores through the disc as they grow via planetesimal accretion , migrate inwards due to type i effects , accrete gas after the accretion rate of solids drops , and finally have their atmospheric mass reduced after arriving in the short - period region by evaporation .",
    "however , the history for the hd69830 system proposed in @xcite is difficult to reconcile with the oligarchic paradigm @xcite .",
    "their best - fitting model involves exactly three seed objects of masses @xmath11 at semimajor axes 3 au , 6.5 au , and 8 au , which migrate to small semimajor axis through a mostly pristine planetesimal disc and therefore can accrete a fair amount of material @xcite . where did these three progenitor objects come from ? in an oligarchic framework , accretion in a narrow region  even in the presence of type i drag ( see @xcite )  results in many roughly equal - mass bodies separated by a distance of @xmath12 hill radii .",
    "these bodies then interact and merge in the giant - impact phase of planet formation , and consume the accessible remnant planetesimal disc .",
    "that is , if a half - earth - mass seed can successfully form at 3 au , there should be a large number of similar seeds of varying mass inside , each of which will accrete and migrate in similar ways .",
    "moreover , the interior seeds are likely to have formed first .",
    "the net result is that any such inward - migrating seed should be migrating through a region highly depleted by the previous seeds , and by the time an 0.6 @xmath3@xmath8 core is formed at 3 au much of the interior disc should have gone to completion , and possibly formed its own planets @xcite .",
    "there is no obvious mechanism to suppress embryo growth everywhere in the disc except at three specific locations .",
    "an additional problem is that simulations have demonstrated that cores migrating through a planetesimal swarm are unable to grow at the rate prescribed by the @xcite model . in the presence of gas drag ,",
    "mean motion resonances cause the majority of the interior planetesimals to be shepherded rather than being accreted , resulting in planets whose masses are too low , and in the wrong ratio , compared to those observed in the hd69830 system @xcite .",
    "though not aiming at hd69830 in particular , @xcite study the formation of hot super - earths and neptunes by following the evolution of @xmath13 planets of @xmath14 or @xmath15 placed interior to 2 au under type i drag , include tidal interactions with the star , and use an inner cavity in the gas disc at @xmath16 au .",
    "for various disc parameters , they succeed in making several objects of mass @xmath17 , with a maximum of 12 @xmath3 .",
    "they find that the typical result has between 25 planets , usually on near - commensurable orbits ( with strict commensurability often being broken by tidal circularization ) .",
    "it is not clear whether this will scale up to larger masses , as they performed only one run with total mass larger than 12 @xmath3(namely 25 @xmath3 ) , and so an hd69830-like system would not appear in their results even if the model would have succeeded in producing them .",
    "very little material was lost from their runs , suggesting it might be possible . however , their initial configurations are difficult to reconcile with an oligarchic migration process",
    ".    scenarios involving oligarchic formation and type i migration do not exhaust the possible formation histories of the low - mass hot exoplanet population , although they are arguably the most natural .",
    "@xcite surveys several other proposed possibilities ( for the terrestrial - mass regime ) : in situ formation ; shepherding by migrating giant planets or secular resonance sweeping ; tidal circularization ; and photoevaporation of giant planets .",
    "we will concentrate instead on the simplest oligarchic type i migration picture , which should have more success self - consistently generating an icy planet population , and attempt to determine whether the fiducial models can reproduce the observed distribution of hot neptunes .",
    "if they can , all the better ; if they can not , then the specifics of their failure may point in the direction of a solution and help us choose between the various possibilities on offer .    to understand how short - period neptunes are formed , we need to move toward self - consistent global n - body models such as those which have proved useful in understanding the formation of the terrestrial planets and the outer solar system .",
    "one problem presents itself immediately : the short - period exoplanet problem has a formation time to dynamical time ratio @xmath18 times larger than the equivalent terrestrial formation problem , and @xmath19 times that of the equivalent jovian core formation problem .",
    "the lifetime of the gas disc ( with a probable upper limit of @xmath20 myr ) is a common reference time - scale for each problem , as gas giants must form while there is still gas for them to accrete , and even ice giants which attain short - period orbits must have migrated while there is gas present .",
    "however , the characteristic orbital periods for each formation problem vary from @xmath21 yr at 0.05 au to @xmath22 yr at 0.5 au to @xmath23 yr at 5.0 au .",
    "( indeed , @xmath21 yr is optimistic , as many exoplanets are closer to their parent stars than 0.05 au . ) since most state - of - the - art planetary n - body codes require the integration timestep to be some small fraction of the orbital period of the innermost object , preserving the same wall - clock run times that researchers have become accustomed to would usually require reducing the number of planetesimals in a simulation by orders of magnitude , producing an unacceptable decrease in resolution .",
    "it is extremely unlikely that this difficulty can be eliminated entirely , as it is a consequence of the strong dependence of orbital period on semimajor axis in the kepler problem .",
    "that said , the challenge can be managed to some extent by taking advantage of the scale separation caused by the troublesome dynamic range .",
    "the standard approaches use a common drift timestep for all particles ( and therefore `` over - integrate '' the more distant objects ) and compute the ( non - encountering ) forces between the particles at the same frequency , both of which involve far more computation on the distant , slow - moving objects than is necessary to preserve qualitatively accurate dynamics . in @xcite",
    "the authors combine various techniques in the literature ( @xcite ) to construct a new algorithm which allows for radial zones with different timesteps and different inter - zone force evaluation frequencies , but reduces to the proven techniques of @xcite and @xcite for objects within the same zone .",
    "this allows new trade - offs between force accuracy and run time .    in our first paper , @xcite",
    ", we addressed the numerical challenges of studying oligarchic models of short - period exoplanet formation . here",
    "we apply a new code with a parallel implementation of those methods , to determine the `` reference population '' of planets predicted by the fiducial models .",
    "we integrate global planetesimal discs extending from 0.05 au to 10 au under various models of the protoplanetary disc .",
    "our models , both semianalytic and n - body , are described in ",
    "[ modeldescr ] , and the simulation conditions in  [ simcond ] .",
    "simulation results are presented in  [ results ] and discussed in  [ discussion ] , and we conclude in  [ section : conc ] .",
    "to model the formation of planets in a global disc with a large dynamic range , we will divide the system into three stages : ( 1 ) the first stage , corresponding to the first 0.4 myr after our nominal starting time t=0 , which we will model using a semianalytic treatment based upon that of @xcite ; ( 2 ) the middle stage , from t=0.4 myr to 6 myr , which we will model using the new multiscale n - body code ; and ( 3 ) the late post - gas stage , from 6 myr to 100 myr , during which we will evolve the inner regions of the disc using a traditional symba implementation .    as usual , the semianalytic model serves two purposes .",
    "it allows for rough exploration of parameter space and provides self - consistent initial conditions for the second stage . in practice",
    ", we find that for the purposes of serving as initial conditions , the model is often more than is necessary : as long as the initial mass of the growing protoplanets is much less than their final mass , and they have many encounters before they undergo significant migration , the systems do not appear to show strong dependence on the details of the initial conditions . as a quasi - equilibrium",
    ", oligarchy is quite robust . nevertheless ,",
    "although using the model does not eliminate the problems caused by initial conditions with inconsistent histories , it does help mitigate them .    to explain our approach",
    ", we will first introduce the general features of the gaseous and solid material of the protoplanetary disc in sections [ gasdisc ] and [ solid ] , and then describe the prescriptions for the aerodynamic and type i drags applied to objects by the gas disc in sections [ aero ] and [ typei ] .",
    "these models are shared by both our semianalytic approach for the early stage , summarized in [ semi ] , and our n - body approach to the later stages , summarized in [ nbody ] .      for simplicity we will consider only models resembling those of the minimum - mass solar nebula ( mmsn ) of @xcite , in which all physical disc parameters may be expressed as simple functions of the cylindrical radius from the star @xmath24 and the height above the disc midplane @xmath25 .",
    "we take the volume density of the gas to be @xmath26 where @xmath27 are cylindrical coordinates and @xmath28 is the disc thickness .",
    "we set @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the gas surface density at 1 au ( @xmath31 in the mmsn ) and @xmath32 gives the radial dependence of the density ( @xmath33 in the mmsn ) . in practice ,",
    "the quantity of interest is usually the ratio of mass in the disc to the mass in the mmsn .",
    "we label this ratio @xmath34 , and determine the appropriate @xmath30 by normalizing so that the amount of gas mass from 0.05 au to 15 au in each simulation is @xmath34 times the mmsn value . in general terms the disc masses that we adopt are consistent with disc masses inferred from sub - mm observations @xcite .",
    "more specifically , @xcite indicate that more than one third of discs in the taurus - auriga region have masses which exceed that of the mmsn model , with similar statistics applying to discs observed in the @xmath35 ophiuchus complex @xcite .    for the disc height",
    "we take @xmath36 note that this power - law in @xmath24 is traditional in the n - body planetary formation community but differs from the canonical choice in the planetary hydrodynamics community of taking a constant @xmath37 ratio of 0.05 or 0.07 .",
    "( although the difference may appear minor , it changes the surface density power - law at which neighbouring equal - mass objects undergoing type i migration switch from convergent to divergent migration , and is known to be important when reconciling results from different simulations involving capture into resonance : see @xcite . )",
    "we assume the gas is in perfect cylindrical rotation .",
    "we parametrize the pressure support by @xmath38 with typical @xmath39 , and take @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the orbital velocity for a circular orbit at @xmath24 .",
    "the dissipation of the gas disc with time @xmath42 is treated by introducing a single uniform exponential damping time - scale , @xmath43 following @xcite .",
    "we neglect the gravitational potential due to the disc .      at time @xmath44 , we set a fixed gas - to - rock ratio of @xmath45 ( from the classical values of @xmath46 for solids at 1 au and @xmath47 for the gas , @xcite ) , and therefore take the initial surface density in rocky material to be of the form @xmath48 where @xmath24 is the cylindrical radius and @xmath49 is the surface density of solids at 1 au .",
    "after @xcite , we introduce a smoothed snow line beyond which the amount of material in solids is enhanced due to the temperature decreasing sufficiently to allow the condensation of ices . placing the snow line at @xmath50 and using a smoothing scale for the transition of @xmath51 = 0.25 au , and using an enhancement factor @xmath52 , we write @xmath53 so that the total initial surface density in solids @xmath54 the form of @xmath55 is unimportant , and is chosen simply to soften the discontinuity for numerical purposes .",
    "we assume that all solid material has a density of 2.0 @xmath56 .",
    "we will apply an aerodynamic drag to all bodies ( although the effects will usually be negligible on objects larger than 1000 km ) .",
    "we take the drag time - scale as @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the mass density of an object , @xmath59 its radius , @xmath60 its velocity relative to the gas velocity at its position , and for simplicity we use a drag efficiency of @xmath61 . in our semianalytic model",
    ", we will use the approximately equivalent form @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the planetesimal s mass , @xmath64 its semimajor axis , @xmath65 its eccentricity , and @xmath66 its orbital frequency .",
    "orbit - averaging the above expression to determine the planetesimal migration rate @xmath67 in the small @xmath68 , @xmath69 ( inclination ) , and @xmath70 limit , @xcite ( after correction by @xcite ) find @xmath71    for the n - body code , we will use the acceleration @xmath72 with @xmath73 from eq .",
    "[ eq : tau_aero_1 ] .      for semianalytic purposes",
    ", we use the type i migration equation of @xcite , which gives an orbit - averaged migration rate @xmath74 of @xmath75 for an object of mass @xmath76 at distance @xmath24 with orbital frequency @xmath66 , where we introduce @xmath77 as a parameter to incorporate uncertainty in the migration efficiency .",
    "we note that significant contributions to the corotation torque may arise due to non - linear effects , resulting in a significantly reduced migration rate @xcite , such that @xmath78 .",
    "the semianalytic model will assume that embryos are always on circular orbits and so we do not need an expression for the eccentricity damping .    for n - body calculations , we will use the full instantaneous specific force expressions of @xcite and @xcite , as given in appendix a of @xcite , which we do not repeat here .",
    "our only modification is to introduce a @xmath77 parameter into the relevant radial migration term of the form of eq .",
    "[ eq : v_m ] .",
    "there have been a number of developments over recent years which have led to modifications of the basic picture of how type i migration may operate under differing assumptions about the underlying protoplanetary disc structure .",
    "in addition to the corotation torque effects mentioned above , it has been noted that regions in the disc where the surface density profile has a positive gradient ( such that the surface density increases outward ) may act as planet traps , where planetary migration may not occur at all @xcite .",
    "a planet trap may exist near to the star where the stellar magnetosphere clears a low density cavity in the disc @xcite .",
    "as discussed in the introduction to this paper , and in section  [ comparison ] , other researchers have considered the role of this cavity in the formation of short - period neptune and super - earth planets , and not surprisingly have found that the accumulation of planetary embryos there can lead to the formation of planets of the required mass .",
    "however , the formation of multiple neptune and/or super - earth - mass planet systems with a broad range of semimajor axes , such as hd69830 , do not arise naturally from these models .",
    "formation of a multiple planet system inside the cavity is possible , but the gravitational potential well of the star likely prevents scattering out to orbital radii that would be required to explain hd69830 . @xcite examined the possibility of planetary growth at a planet trap located near the snowline .",
    "probably the most plausible explanation for a planet trap being located there is the model of inside - out disc clearance by magnetohydrodynamic turbulence suggested by @xcite .",
    "the simulations by @xcite indicate that multiple planets at a planet trap located at the snowline can indeed undergo close encounters and collisions through mutual scattering , allowing large bodies to grow there .",
    "in addition , scattering out of the trap was observed , allowing planets to migrate inward after growth through tidal interaction with the interior disc .",
    "one uncertainty which remains in this picture is how clear of material the inner disc needs to be for the inside - out clearing model of @xcite to operate .",
    "x - rays generated in the stellar corona need to be able to penetrate deep into the disc and out to large radii for the planet trap to be located at the snowline , leading to uncertainty about how much type i migration can actually ensue once planets are scattered out of the trap . given this uncertainty in the model ,",
    "we have chosen to focus on the most generic type i migration scenario in the present study , which does not include planet traps located at specific radii .",
    "we follow @xcite , which is derived from @xcite , replacing only the formula for type i drag used there ( due to @xcite ) with that of tanaka and ward ( eq .  [ eq : v_m ] ) .",
    "we will forego repeating the derivations and simply describe the resulting equations .",
    "we simulate the oligarchic migration formation scenario using a continuous two - component model consisting of protoplanetary embryos of mass @xmath79 which accrete mass from a planetesimal field distribution with surface density @xmath80 orbiting a star of mass @xmath81 , with gravitational constant @xmath82 .",
    "the embryos ( of density @xmath83 ) are assumed to be kept at a constant fixed separation @xmath84 in single - planet hill units ( @xmath85 ) as a consequence of the usual oligarchic equilibration between the increased separation due to scattering and the decreased separation due to accretion ( @xcite ) .",
    "( as discussed in @xcite , this approximation is questionable at late times when strong migration is operating or the discs are very massive , but is reasonable during the early stages . )",
    "the embryo eccentricities are neglected as they are likely to be much smaller than those of the planetesimals due to both dynamical friction and type i damping ( itself a kind of dynamical friction with the gas ) .",
    "the planetesimals ( of density @xmath58 ) are assumed to have a uniform mass @xmath63 ( and radius @xmath59 ) , and at a given semimajor axis all have an equilibrium eccentricity found by equating the time - scale for stirring by the embryos by damping by aerodynamic drag .",
    "see @xcite for a detailed description of the weaknesses of the equilibrium eccentricity assumption , and also note that by neglecting the contribution of embryo - embryo mergers we underestimate the accretion rate .",
    "the physics in the model is simple , although the algebra is somewhat tedious .",
    "embryos accrete mass from the planetesimals according to the expression is missing from eq .  4 of @xcite ; the error was typographical . ]",
    "@xmath86 which corresponds to a decrease in planetesimal surface density @xmath87 planetesimals migrate due to aerodynamic drag with a radial rate @xmath67 given by eq .",

    "we will take the initial seed mass for the embryos as @xmath90 , which has the effect of artificially accelerating the growth of the more distant embryos during the earliest stages .",
    "the semianalytic eulerian approach of the previous section can be useful as a rough estimate of the behaviour of the system , but contains very limited information about the dynamics involved .",
    "for later stages in which the interactions between the embryos are significant a particle - based lagrangian approach using an n - body code is necessary .",
    "currently , the most robust n - body algorithm for oligarchic simulations of planet formation on long time - scales remains symba @xcite , which derives from the original mixed - variable symplectic integrators of @xcite and @xcite but has been improved to treat close encounters between particles .",
    "unfortunately , it requires a common base timestep for all particles , which is set to some small fraction ( typically @xmath91 or less ) of the innermost period so that pericentre passage is always resolved .",
    "( @xcite introduced a variant which could handle occasional objects crossing the usual innermost boundary by smoothly switching to a bulirsch - stoer integrator , following up on the innovations of chambers 1999 , but it becomes impractical when boundary crossings are common . ) in a companion paper @xcite we introduce a new algorithm naoko which allows for multiple radial zones with distinct timesteps and can vary the number of force evaluations between different zones , making possible a new trade - off between the force accuracy between distant objects and speed .",
    "we have implemented a parallel version of naoko in the planet formation code miranda , which is basically a parallel symba implementation .    as in the semianalytics , we have two classes of objects , embryos and planetesimals , where the embryos can merge with each other and with the planetesimals , but the planetesimals do not self - interact either gravitationally or collisionally . two objects ( assumed spherical )",
    "merge if their physical separation is less than the sum of their physical radii , and form one new object , conserving mass and linear momentum .",
    "no fragmentation is considered . following standard practice ( e.g.  @xcite ) we use `` super - planetesimals '' , and replace the planetesimals of mass @xmath63 we would prefer to use with larger objects of mass @xmath92 which behave as objects of mass @xmath63 with respect to non - gravitational interactions like gas drag , and",
    "serve as representative elements of an underlying planetesimal population .",
    "as long as the number of super - planetesimals is large and the embryo mass is greater than the super - planetesimal mass ( @xmath93 ) , the accretion rate is insensitive to this approximation .",
    "( taking a uniform @xmath63 for the planetesimals and neglecting their self - interactions are considerably more damaging simplifications than using super - planetesimals in any event . )",
    "interactions with the gas disc are limited to aerodynamic drag and type i drag , as described in sections [ aero ] and [ typei ] .",
    "the super - planetesimals will experience an aerodynamic drag corresponding not to the physical radius of the integrated tracer , but to that of the underlying planetesimal ( typically @xmath94 km ) .",
    "for the computationally challenging second stage during which the gas is present , we will integrate the system using miranda in its new naoko mode @xcite .",
    "this allows the disc to be divided into distinct radial zones , and objects in each zone are integrated using different time steps . in the simulations presented here we used four zones , with timesteps chosen so that all objects had at least @xmath95 15 steps per orbit : namely , @xmath96 = 0.53 yr for objects outside 4 au ; @xmath96 = 0.13 yr for 1.6 - 4 au ; @xmath96 = 0.013 yr for 0.34 - 1.6 au ; and @xmath96 = 0.00083 yr for 0.05 - 0.34 au .",
    "this corresponded to timestep ratios between outer and inner zones of 4 , 10 , and 16 , respectively .",
    "these ratios also describe the ratios of the frequencies on which the interzone forces were evaluated ; intrazone forces were evaluated at each ( zone ) step .",
    "boundaries between zones had associated transition zones centred there , of widths 0.5 au , 0.1 au , and 0.04 au from outermost to innermost , in which the objects smoothly experienced both timesteps to avoid artificial kicks in velocity . for the late stage after the gas disc has dissipated , the number of particles in the inner zone of interest will have decreased enough that we can return to the traditional symba method to simulate the final giant - impact stage , with a fixed timestep of 0.0007 yr .",
    "computational power being limited , it was not feasible even with the new code to perform multiple runs for each parameter set of interest . instead , we made compromises between coverage of parameter space and reproducibility of each run , and between concentrating on physically plausible scenarios and less plausible but informative limiting cases .",
    "table [ simparam ] lists the resulting choices , and where two simulation labels are given we ran two instantiations which differed only in the random number seeds used to define the initial keplerian angular variables of the particles .",

    "the surface density power - law was chosen from @xmath99 , so that the discs are all much flatter than the mmsn ( with @xmath33 ) .",
    "the mmsn value was skipped in the production runs presented here because preliminary low resolution simulations indicated that disc models with a high degree of central mass concentration do not successfully form surviving short - period planetary systems with significant amounts of mass .",
    "this may be due in part to the fact that such a disc model induces divergent type i migration for neighbouring bodies of equal mass , as discussed below , thereby reducing the planetary growth rate .",
    "in addition , viscous disc models based on the @xcite ` alpha ' prescription for viscosity tend to generate shallower surface density distributions @xcite .",
    "note that with @xmath100 ( eq .  [ eq : z0 ] ) , the type i @xmath74 rate is independent of @xmath64 for equal m at @xmath101 , and shows convergent migration for @xmath102 .",

    "no planetesimals can promote themselves to embryos , even if a planetesimal ring forms in which the largest body should experience runaway growth and become a new oligarch .",
    "this will suppress embryo growth in some cases ( when an oligarch should have formed ) , and increase it in others ( by providing a fresh supply of material for protoplanets migrating into the region to consume , as in @xcite and the models of @xcite ) .",
    "the use of a uniform characteristic planetesimal radius means that we are insensitive to the differing effects of aerodynamic drag on different - sized objects .",
    "while the planetesimal non - accretion problem is difficult to overcome , the uniform - mass problem could be handled by varying the radius assigned to super - planetesimals , so that some objects would trace the behaviour of 1 km bodies , some 10 km , and so on .",
    "however , in the absence of any collisional physics  here , we use a simple hit - and - stick model with no fragmentation  the small - radius planetesimals will not be replenished as they would be in a real system . the absence of a collisional cloud may increase the eccentricity of the resulting planets as an object can not be damped by its own debris , but this is probably negligible during the gas - rich phase when type i drag is strong and the embryos are on effectively circular orbits the majority of the time .",
    "ultimately , it will be necessary to use a hybrid n - body / statistical scheme along the lines of @xcite , and we are currently exploring the incorporation of a variant of the semianalytic model of @xcite into the code .",
    "the choice of inner and outer edge for the initial solid material distribution in the n - body runs  1.0 au and @xmath1 au  may have changed the outcomes in two ways . in the runs with low migration , some objects which should have been present in the interior will be missing . however , this is seldom a significant amount of mass",
    ". the only disc in which there was more than @xmath182@xmath3 of material interior to 1 au which was excluded was the @xmath183 case ( @xmath184@xmath3 ) , which has very high migration ; s22a , s36a , and s37a all fail to contain any objects inside of 1.5 au because they have all migrated away , and so very little material ( if any ) would have survived . in the discs with the lowest migration rates , where @xmath105 , only @xmath185@xmath3of mass was missed when @xmath101 .",
    "( the flatter profiles have more of their mass at larger @xmath24 and so have even less initial mass inside of 1 au . )",
    "therefore the effects on the final results are limited : low - enhancement discs which have migration rates small enough that we should have included the innermost embryos also have too little mass in the region to be interesting , and high - enhancement discs which have enough mass to significantly affect the mass of a final planet have migration rates high enough that the missing material is long gone by the time the gas disc has dissipated .",
    "the inner cut - off edge of 0.05 au will also be responsible for removing some particles with small semimajor axis and high eccentricity , but there are very few of them . on the outer edge , it is quite possible that a wider particle disc than 10 au would have resulted in more planets in the high - enhancement runs and prevented the zero - planet outcomes ( all of which were very high - migration configurations with @xmath186 and @xmath77 = 1 ) .",
    "such high enhancements and migration rates are at the limits of plausibility to start with , and the initial conditions from the semianalytic model are questionable at high @xmath34 .",
    "most importantly , there is no reason to expect that the planets which would have been formed would be any larger than the ones already formed in the @xmath145 runs , as objects which migrate into the inner regions in such runs are often either well - separated or resonantly locked and therefore protected against most encounters .    in our n - body model ,",
    "the only effect that the gas disc has upon the particles is via prescription as a source of drag , whether aerodynamic or type i , and we did not include any disc physics involving gap opening .",
    "this probably had little effect , as if we assume a ( hydrodynamic - standard ) constant @xmath187 ratio of @xmath188 , and use the gravitothermal condition from @xcite , gap opening even in an inviscid disc requires @xmath189 , or @xmath190 , which gives a mass of @xmath191 ( with `` gap opening '' defined to be a 10% perturbation in surface density ) . even assuming a ratio of 1/2 sufficed to open a gap",
    ", we would need @xmath192 .",
    "things become somewhat better in a flared disc ( such as the one we actually used ) with @xmath193 , where if we assume no kinematic viscosity , an 8 @xmath3object could possibly start opening a gap at @xmath194 au , near the edge of our simulation region . in practice , gap opening is unlikely to be a good explanation for the presence of the ` lukewarm ' end of the hot neptune population unless it is substantially more efficient than currently thought .",
    "we also neglected the accretion of gas onto the embryo cores .",
    "given the low planet masses we obtained  with median 1 @xmath3and maximum @xmath195 @xmath3 the standard @xcite model suggests that even our most massive planets would have accreted atmospheres of at most 1 - 2 @xmath3 .",
    "this missing mass should not have affected the outcomes significantly , at least directly , as it would have changed the hill radii by less than 10% .",
    "however , it is known @xcite that growing embyros can have a significantly increased effective capture radius due to the energy loss suffered by planetesimals moving through the embryo atmosphere , which can help overcome the challenge of forming giant planet cores before the gas disc evaporates @xcite . would including this effect have made it possible to form substantially larger cores ?",
    "this question should be considered in a larger context .",
    "one feature common to many of the new mechanisms being discussed , atmosphere - enhanced capture radii included , is that they tend to increase the accretion rate at early times .",
    "partly this is due to a target bias on the part of scientists studying the middle and late stages of planet formation , as forming the cores of giant planets on appropriate time - scales is an important open problem even in the migration - free case , and so efforts have been concentrated in the direction of making large objects easier to form . in the absence of migration , this is a net positive .",
    "the situation is more complicated when migration is involved .",
    "increasing the accretion rate sounds appealing , but since the type i migration rate scales linearly with the mass , it will simultaneously decrease the migration time - scales , and do so at early times when the gas density is at its highest . if anything , this will make the formation - to - migration time - scale problem worse , at least in cases where migration is significant .",
    "@xcite noted that for a fixed gas - to - dust ratio and gas dissipation time - scale , increases in initial surface density can result in decreases in final surface density . @xcite",
    "finds that for a disc with alpha viscosity of 0.001 , the maximum embryo mass increases as the disc mass increases to a high of @xmath196 at @xmath197 , and then falls off , so that disc masses of @xmath198 and @xmath199 both have maximum planet mass @xmath200 .",
    "including fragmentation does raise the maximum mass reached over a wide range of disc mass ( @xmath201 ) , but only to @xmath202 .",
    "the case with alpha viscosity of 0.01 resembles the case without migration below disc masses of @xmath203 . only at very large disc masses ,",
    "greater than 0.10 @xmath204 , are neptune - like masses recovered .",
    "modifying the accretion rate seems unlikely to encourage neighbouring oligarchs to merge at late times , given their large separations .",
    "these spacings are consequences of the high surface density of the discs as well as type i migration .",
    "enhanced capture radius mechanisms should have little direct effect on the giant impact phase , as a body needs to encounter roughly its own mass of gaseous material in the extended atmosphere to significantly affect its orbit .",
    "for example , earth - mass objects experiencing a near - collision will barely notice any atmosphere , however extended .",
    "in general , changes to the accretion rate in these oligarchic migration scenarios should move the window of source material which grows and migrates to the innermost regions , but will not increase the total mass by the factors of several needed to recover a planetary system resembling hd69830 ( except possibly for massive discs ) .",
    "that is , it should change where the planets come from , not how large they are .",
    "our results differ significantly from previous results in the literature , chiefly in that we fail where they succeed .",
    "@xcite succeeded in forming a system which resembles the hd69830 system very closely , by reducing the strength of the migration by a factor of 10 and considering only three cores which migrate and accrete ( c.f .",
    "as @xcite explains , the presence of interior embryos with a much shorter dynamical time means that inward - migrating cores do not encounter a pristine feeding zone , but one which is already substantially processed .",
    "none of our migrating cores experienced growth resembling that in the @xcite model .",
    "@xcite further find that aerodynamic drag can significantly decrease the planetesimal accretion rate in such scenarios , keeping the migrating core acting as a shepherd and not a predator .",
    "an alternative way of ensuring that a population of hot super - earths or hot neptunes can form and survive is to invoke an inner disc cavity generated by interaction between the disc and the stellar magnetosphere .",
    "such a model has been used to explain the existence of hot jupiters @xcite , and was incorporated into the formation models of @xcite and @xcite ( who also included tidal interaction with the central star ) . @xcite and @xcite both succeeded in forming large short - period neptune - mass ( 1030 @xmath3 ) cores .",
    "@xcite form four objects of mass @xmath205 , the largest being @xmath206 , and @xcite form five objects of mass @xmath207 , with the largest being @xmath208 .",
    "there are three main differences between their models and ours which likely account for the discrepancy .",
    "first , both are relatively low - resolution : @xcite used only 10 earth - mass bodies in all but one of their runs , and @xcite used 100 embryos of 0.5 @xmath3and 200 planetesimals of 0.1 @xmath3 .",
    "second , and more importantly , it is unlikely that their initial masses and spacings can be recovered from a self - consistent oligarchic migration model : there is no plausible prior configuration which would evolve into ( for example ) 12 earth - mass bodies spaced between 0.1 and 1 au . finally , and most importantly , in accordance with the cavity hypothesis both groups used a disc with an inner edge at either 0.05 au or 0.10 au , and we did not .",
    "some small toy simulations we performed ( unpresented here ) confirm that we can also build bodies of @xmath209 by doing so , but only relatively close to the boundary .",
    "however , from general considerations the magnetospheric cavity in this model is expected to extend out to a distance of @xmath210 au for an assumed t tauri star rotation period of 8 days @xcite , causing migration to halt at a distance of @xmath211 au from the star .",
    "we simply note that there are a number of super - earths and neptune - mass extrasolar planets orbiting with significantly larger semimajor axes ( e.g.  hd69830 d , or ogle-05 - 169l b , at 2.8 au ) whose inward migration was probably not halted by the presence of an inner disc cavity .",
    "it is more likely that they , or their progenitor objects , were stranded at or near their current location when the gas disc dispersed .",
    "@xcite and @xcite use semianalytic models , both incorporating atmosphere - enhanced capture radii and the latter fragmentation , and succeed in forming planets of @xmath212 , although @xcite produce far more than @xcite .",
    "they both use an approach in which embryos are treated as discrete but non - interacting objects instead of as a continuous distribution ( replacing the more eulerian treatment of @xcite and @xcite with a lagrangian one ) . in order to maintain the standard oligarchic separation of @xmath1 hill radii , they merge two embryos whenever their semimajor axes differ by less than 7 hill radii . as @xcite notes",
    ", this will result in missing some interesting inter - embryo dynamics such as migration convoys ( groups of embryos migrating in mean - motion resonance , as in @xcite ; see also @xcite ) , but it will also miss some larger and more fundamental dynamics such as deviations of the embryo behaviour from the semianalytic predictions , and introduce an unphysical orderly merger wave .",
    "@xcite performed a comparison between the results of his semianalytic model and one of the terrestrial - planet n - body integrations of @xcite , and found that the n - body results had both larger median masses ( @xmath213 vs. @xmath214 ) and larger median spacings ( @xmath215 hill radii vs. 11 ) . even in the original oligarchic model of @xcite , there is a weak dependence of @xmath84 on @xmath76 and @xmath216 .",
    "if in these scenarios the interembryo spacing grows to values much larger than @xmath217 while the objects stay on near - circular orbits , oligarchic growth can be quenched ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "as @xcite (  8 ) notes , in order to maintain a constant spacing in @xmath84 within a fixed width , embryos must accrete 1/3 of their mass via embryo - embryo mergers .",
    "this accretion mode should vanish if the embryos are too well - separated ( and too cold , but the models assume the embryos are always on circular orbits . )",
    "too large a spacing towards the end of the gas phase can also suppress the giant - impact phase almost entirely , requiring external sources of stirring to form large cores on reasonable time - scales .",
    "accordingly , if the interembryo spacing @xmath84 for large - mass bodies in these simulations is closer to @xmath218 than @xmath217 , then calibrating the ( admittedly merely statistical ) prescription for the embryo mergers to the no - migration , low - embryo - mass separation value of @xmath217 may not be appropriate .    despite the differences , we find some qualitative agreements with @xcite . in his models with migration but without fragmentation ( the closest match to our runs )",
    ", he finds that the maximum mass of an object is maximized at @xmath219 for a disc mass of @xmath197 , and that both higher and lower disc masses decrease this number ( as we find , and @xcite predicted ) . for his simulations which include both fragmentation and migration , as mentioned above",
    ", there is a wide range of disc masses ( @xmath220 ) which produce roughly comparable maxima ( @xmath202 ) .",
    "the only simulations which succeed in getting cores larger than @xmath221 either fail to include migration or include both fragmentation and migration with a disc mass of @xmath222 , and it appears that the only neptune - like object had a semimajor axis outside 2 au .",
    "this is in mild disagreement with @xcite , who found 10 @xmath3objects were common , which @xcite argues is the result of their choices of a large alpha viscosity , 0.01 , and a small planetesimal radius , 1 km , while neglecting fragmentation .",
    "we suspect that the solution to the short - period neptune formation problem lies not in tweaking the accretion rate but in modifying the prescription for the interaction with the gas disc .",
    "obviously we need some kind of migration to build a short - period population , but what properties should it have ? ideally , we would prefer a migration which : ( 1 ) has little to no effect at early times when the gas density is high , so that enhancing the surface density actually results in larger embryos and not more embryos lost , ( 2 ) when active , has a reduced rate from the nominal @xcite behaviour , as our @xmath223 runs performed noticeably better than our full migration runs , and ( 3 ) provides some mechanism to encourage large migrating embryos to merge instead of locking in convoys or stranding themselves at large separations from their neighbours , such as a variable migration direction .",
    "the most promising model of disc - induced migration which displays these characteristics is that presented by @xcite , in which the migration of planets in radiatively inefficient discs was considered .",
    "this model has the highly desirable property that migration is stopped , or even reversed , during early times when the disc is optically thick , but inward type i migration is recovered when the disc density decreases and the gas becomes optically thin . an alternative model for the modification of type i migration is stochastic migration induced by turbulent density fluctuations in the disc @xcite .",
    "although this does not appear to have the same nicely - tailored characteristics for solving the problem of short - period neptune formation as the radiatively inefficient migration model , its random walk nature has the potential to deliver significant planetary material into the interior regions at late times .",
    "we performed 48 simulations of various oligarchic migration scenarios to determine whether the simplest standard approach can succeed in forming a population of short - period neptune systems under common assumptions for the protoplanetary disc parameters .",
    "multiple numerical techniques were applied : semianalytic techniques for the first 0.4 myr , our new parallel multizone n - body code for the accretion phase while gas is present up to 6 myr , and the more traditional symba approach for the late stage to 100 myr .",
    "we find that over a wide range of disc conditions , it is difficult to form planets of mass greater than @xmath224 .",
    "our most successful runs involved @xmath225 5 times the mass of the mmsn , surface density varying as @xmath226 , a disc decay time - scale of 1 myr , and a migration efficiency of 0.3 .",
    "our most common planet outcomes are of earth - mass objects , with the terrestrial planets having ice fractions from 0.0 to 0.75 ( the maximum possible in our simulations ) .",
    "the larger objects have higher ice fractions , with the median being 0.60 for objects above 1 @xmath3 , and 0.36 below . in none of the cases",
    "did we succeed in forming an object of greater than 7.5 @xmath3inside 2 au , much less inside 0.5 au , and the total embryo mass remaining inside 2 au was always less than 17 @xmath3 .",
    "the existence of an upper limit and the weak dependence on most parameters is in accordance with the predictions of @xcite , and in rough agreement with the predictions of @xcite except at large disc masses .",
    "nevertheless , we should be wary of making predictions based on these results regarding extrasolar planetary systems , as they entirely fail to reproduce the short - period neptune planetary population that we know exists .",
    "our failure can be compared to several previous successes in the literature , which either ( 1 ) adopt initial conditions which are not easily reconciled with an oligarchic growth picture , ( 2 ) use an inner edge to the migration ( which is defensible but will have difficulty explaining more distant neptunes ) , or ( 3 ) neglect inter - embryo dynamics and use an embryo merger condition which is calibrated to an effective inter - embryo separation ( 10 hill radii ) which is considerably smaller than we observe .",
    "varying parameters which we kept constant such as the gas - to - dust ratio , incorporating additional accretion physics such as fragmentation , moving to extremely large disc masses or extremely weak migration , and simply performing more runs ( and hoping for fortuitous late mergers ) , could possibly succeed in improving the maximum mass reached by a factor of two and therefore into the neptune - like region .",
    "it seems quite unlikely that they will increase the median mass enough to comfortably produce a population of multiple - planet short - period neptune systems .",
    "we conclude that forming a system like hd69830 will probably require a significant revision to the simple models explored here .",
    "if the standard oligarchy - plus - type - i - migration picture fails to reproduce the observed distribution of short - period exoplanets even at more extreme parameter values , then we must consider non - standard models .",
    "oligarchy is relatively well understood both analytically and numerically ; by comparison type i migration is sensitive to poorly understood properties of the gas disc such as disc turbulence and local thermodynamic time - scales . in a follow - up paper",
    "we consider the implications for hot exoplanet formation via oligarchy of alternate migration models ( such as @xcite ) which show some promise .",
