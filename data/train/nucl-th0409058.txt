    "anisotropic flows in heavy ion collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( ) are sensitive to the properties of produced matter .",
    "this sensitivity not only exists in the larger elliptic flow @xcite but also in the smaller higher - order anisotropic flows @xcite .",
    "experimentally , scaling relations among hadron anisotropic flows have been observed @xcite , and according to the quark coalescence model they are related to similar scaling relations among parton anisotropic flows @xcite .",
    "also , anisotropic flows measured at finite pseudorapidities are seen to depend strongly on the rapidity @xcite , and this has so far not been reproduced by theoretical models hirano01,heinz04,csanad04,chen04v13 . for charmed mesons ,",
    "the observed transverse momentum spectra of electrons from their decays are found to be consistent with both limiting scenarios of perturbative qcd spectra without final - state interactions and complete thermalization including transverse expansion @xcite .",
    "the charm elliptic flows given by the quark coalescence model show , however , marked differences between these two scenarios @xcite .",
    "these interesting phenomena have recently been studied in a multiphase transport ( ampt ) model that includes both initial partonic and final hadronic interactions @xcite . in this talk , we briefly review the ampt model and discuss the results obtained from this model .",
    "the model is a hybrid model that uses minijet partons from hard processes and strings from soft processes in the heavy ion jet interaction generator ( ) model @xcite as the initial conditions for modeling heavy ion collisions at ultra - relativistic energies .",
    "time evolution of resulting minijet partons is then described by zhang s parton cascade ( ) @xcite model . at present , this model includes only parton - parton elastic scatterings with an in - medium cross section derived from the lowest - order born diagram with an effective gluon screening mass taken as a parameter for fixing the magnitude and angular distribution of parton scattering cross section .",
    "after minijet partons stop interacting , they are combined with their parent strings , as in the model with jet quenching , to fragment into hadrons using the lund string fragmentation model as implemented in the program @xcite .",
    "the final - state hadronic scatterings are then modeled by a relativistic transport ( ) model @xcite .    since the initial energy density in au + au collisions at",
    "is much larger than the critical energy density at which the hadronic matter to quark - gluon plasma transition would occur @xcite , the model has been extended by converting the initial excited strings into partons @xcite . in this string melting scenario , hadrons , that would have been produced from string fragmentation , are converted instead to valence quarks and/or antiquarks .",
    "interactions among these partons are again described by the parton cascade model .",
    "since there are no inelastic scatterings , only quarks and antiquarks from the melted strings are present in the partonic matter .",
    "the transition from the partonic matter to the hadronic matter is achieved using a simple coalescence model , which combines two nearest quark and antiquark into mesons and three nearest quarks or antiquarks into baryons or anti - baryons that are close to the invariant mass of these partons .",
    "the present coalescence model is thus somewhat different from the ones recently used extensively @xcite for studying hadron production at intermediate transverse momenta .",

    "the string melting scenario with @xmath35 @xmath3 ( solid squared ) is seen to describe very well the data for @xmath17 around mid-@xmath33 ( @xmath36 ) but overestimates the data at large pseudorapidity .",
    "the overestimation of may stem from the use of constant parton scattering cross section in the ampt model . since the properties of partonic matter at different rapidities may not be the same in heavy ion collisions at",
    ", different parton cross sections may have to be used .",
    "comparison between theoretical results and the experimental data for elliptic flow indicates that a larger @xmath35 @xmath3 is needed at midrapidity but a smaller @xmath35 @xmath31 ( open squares ) gives a better description at large pseudorapidity .",

    "[ v2yh ] are results obtained from the scenario without string melting ( solid triangles ) , and they are seen to also describe the data at large pseudorapidity ( @xmath37 ) . therefore , the scenario without string melting can describe simultaneously the data on @xmath32 and @xmath17 at large pseudorapidity ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "these interesting features imply that initially the matter produced at large pseudorapidity ( @xmath38 ) is dominated by strings while that produced around mid - rapidity ( @xmath39 ) mainly consists of partons .",
    "this is a reasonable picture as particles at large rapidity are produced later in time when the volume of the system is large and the energy density is small .",

    "[ v2dsc ] .",
    "it is seen that the quark @xmath43 increases with increasing @xmath44 , and at @xmath45 gev / c it is smaller for the heavier @xmath14 quark than for the lighter @xmath46 and @xmath47 quarks .",
    "this mass dependence of @xmath17 at low @xmath44 is similar to the mass ordering of hadron elliptic flows in the hydrodynamic model which assumes that the matter is in local thermal equilibrium and thus develops a large collective radial flow .",
    "however , instead of continuing increase of @xmath43 with respect to @xmath44 as in the hydrodynamic model , the parton @xmath43 in the transport model reaches a maximum value at certain large @xmath44 , indicating that high momentum particles do not achieve thermal equilibrium with the bulk matter .",
    "these features are seen for both values of parton scattering cross sections , except that the value of @xmath43 is larger for a larger parton scattering cross section . as in the case of light hadrons ,",
    "study of charmed hadron flows offers the possibility to understand the charm quark interactions in the quark - gluon plasma .",
    "in summary , using the model , we have studied the partonic effects on anisotropic flows in heavy ion collisions at .",
    "we find that measured @xmath17 , @xmath0 and @xmath1 of charged hadrons at midrapidity in au + au collisions at @xmath7 agev can be described by a parton scattering cross section of about @xmath3 mb and that @xmath0 is a more sensitive probe to the initial partonic dynamics in these collisions than @xmath17 .",
    "moreover , higher - order parton anisotropic flows are nonnegligible and satisfy the scaling relation @xmath25 , which leads naturally to the observed similar scaling relation among hadron anisotropic flows if the partonic matter hadronizes via the coalescence of quarks and antiquarks .",
    "the results on the rapidity dependence of anisotropic flows suggest that a partonic matter is formed during early stage of relativistic heavy ion collisions only around midrapidity and that strings remain dominant at large rapidities .",
    "we have also studied the elliptic flow of charm quarks by using different scattering cross sections , and find that it has a maximum value similar to that for light quarks and is also sensitive to the charm quark scattering cross sections .",
    "the charm quark elliptic flow shows , on the other hand , a very different dependence on the transverse momentum due to its large mass .    in reproducing the experimental data on hadron anisotropic flows , a large parton cross section of about 10 mb is needed in the ampt model .",
    "comparing to the cross section given by the perturbative qcd , this value is an order of magnitude larger , indicating that nonperterbative effects are important in the quark - gluon plasma .",
    "indeed , recent lattice gauge studies have shown that hadron spectral functions including those consisting of heavy charm quarks survive in the quark - gluon plasma @xcite . including the effect of these quasi bound states",
