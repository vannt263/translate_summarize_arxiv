    "@xmath0 is estimated by numerical simulation performed until @xmath195 , and it might be lowered in a even longer simulation . the critical energy for the delocalization transition is comparable to the maximum energy of @xmath114 shown in fig .",
    "10(a ) . figure 10(d ) displays @xmath196 , where @xmath89 is the frequency of the jump motion per unit time , as a function of @xmath32 .",
    "the frequency @xmath81 of the jump motion also increases as @xmath197 for @xmath191 , although the reason of the exponent @xmath198 is not understood yet .",
    "we have performed numerical simulations of hamiltonian systems with repulsive interaction , and studied the delocalization transition . we have found that the dynamics around the saddle point is very important near the delocalization transition , because the saddle point plays a role of the lowest barrier between the neighboring cells . in a two - particle system",
    ", we have found infinite alternation of the stability and the instability of the straight motion passing through the saddle point .",
    "it is closely related to the anomalous behavior of the jump frequency @xmath81 above the critical energy . in a four - particle system in a square box and a sixteen - particle system in a rectangular box",
    ", we have found that simultaneous jump motions occur intermittently near the transition point . if each particle is located deeply inside of each cell , the chaotic motion for the particle is weakly correlated from that for the other particles .",
    "however , it is necessary for several particles to exhibit jump motion almost simultaneously to go over the saddle point using a small amount of energy .",
    "all the four particles exhibit the simultaneous jump motion in the four - particle system . on the other hand ,",
    "four particles exhibit the simultaneous jump motion near the delocalization transition in the sixteen - particle system .",
    "these simulatenous jump motions might be related with the heterogeneous dynamics near the glass transition and the jamming transition , although the detailed relation with such systems of a large number of particles is not known well .",
    "there is a definite critical energy @xmath0 of the delocalization transition in hamiltonian systems of a small number of particles , below which each particle is completely confined in each unit cell .",
    "the critical energy seems to be determined by the energy of the lowest saddle point .",
    "we consider that the critical energy of the delocalization transition in the hamiltonian systems of a small number of particles is generally different from the critical energy for the statistical - mechanical liquid - solid phase transition in an infinitely large system .",
    "it is partly because a long - range order needs to appear against the statistical - mechanical fluctuations below the liquid - solid phase transition point .",
    "for example , the long - range order does not appear in two dimensions owing to the long - wavelength fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "the long - wavelength fluctuations are not directly related to the energy of the saddle points .",
    "however , the detailed relation of the delocalization transition and the statistical - mechanical liquid - solid phase transition is not understood yet but it is left as a future problem .",
