    "the knowledge of the nn interaction is fundamental for interpreting nuclear phenomena .",
    "the proton - proton ( pp ) experiments provide a solid data basis @xcite , which restricts theoretical assumptions about the strong part of the pp force . in case of the neutron - proton",
    "( np ) system this is only true to a smaller extent .",
    "the partial wave analysis of the np data @xcite relies on the assumption that the isospin @xmath3 piece can be taken over from the pp system and only the @xmath4 part is free in the adjustment to the data .",
    "the lack of a free neutron target forbids neutron - neutron ( nn ) experiments , therefore the information on the nn interaction can be deduced only in an indirect way .",
    "to that aim the best tool seems to be the study of the three - nucleon ( 3n ) system composed from two neutrons and the proton .",
    "it is simple enough to allow a rigorous theoretical treatment , e.g. in the framework of faddeev equations @xcite . the neutron - deuteron elastic scattering together with the neutron induced deuteron breakup , supplemented with the triton properties ,",
    "offer a data basis which can be used to test properties of the nn force .",
    "especially the nd breakup process with its rich set of configurations for free three outgoing nucleons seems to be a powerfull tool to test the nuclear hamiltonian . by comparing theoretical predicitons to the nd breakup data in different configurations not only",
    "can the present day models of two - nucleon ( 2n ) interactions be tested , but also effects of three - nucleon forces ( 3nf s ) can be studied .",
    "the nn quasi - free scattering ( qfs ) refers to a situation where the outgoing proton is at rest in the laboratory system . in the nd breakup",
    "also np qfs is possible .",
    "here one of the neutrons is at rest while the second neutron together with the proton form a quasi - freely scattered pair .",
    "the reported nn qfs cross sections taken at @xmath5  mev @xcite and at @xmath6  mev @xcite overestimate the nd theory by @xmath7 . surprisingly , when instead of the nn pair the np pair is quasi - freely scattered , the theory follows nicely the np qfs cross section data taken in the @xmath5  mev nd breakup measurement @xcite .",
    "that good description of the np qfs cross section contrasts with the drastic discrepancy between the theory and the nn qfs cross section data taken in the same experiment @xcite .",
    "we do not expect surprises in case of the pp qfs data @xcite , since the information of the rich set of pp data has been incorporated into the pp forces .",
    "in fact a recent analysis @xcite including the coulomb force to pp qfs data lead to a nice agreement , while in previous analysis @xcite the coulomb force was not yet included .",
    "additional theoretical efforts to include all effects of the coulomb force beyond the ones in @xcite are underway .    in section [ two ]",
    "we exemplify the stability of the qfs cross sections against changes of modern nuclear forces .",
    "we also demonstrate that below @xmath8  mev the @xmath0 and @xmath9-@xmath10 nn force components dominate the qfs cross sections . in section",
    "[ three ] we analyse the np as well as the nn qfs data from @xcite in terms of rigorous solutions of the 3n faddeev equation and discuss necessary changes in the @xmath0 nn force component to remove the discrepancies in the nn qfs cross section .",
    "thereby a detailed study is performed using the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) chiral nn force , composed of contact interactions and the one - pion exchange potential .",
    "it reveals that the effective range parameter is decisive to reconcile theory and data .",
    "the outcome is discussed in section [ four ] and further experimental insights on the nn force are proposed .",
    "finally we summarize in section [ five ] .",
    "it is known that nd scattering theory provides qfs cross sections which are highly independent from the realistic nn potential used in the calculations and that they practically do not change when any of the present day 3nf s is included  @xcite .",
    "we exemplify it in fig .",
    "[ fig_qfs_nn_np_indep_nn_3nf ] for the nn and np qfs geometries of ref .",
    "there results of 3n faddeev calculations @xcite based on different high precision nn forces ( cd bonn  @xcite , nijm i and nijm ii  @xcite ) alone or combined with the tm99 3nf  @xcite are shown .",
    "the sensitivity study performed in @xcite revealed that at energies below @xmath8  mev the @xmath0 and @xmath9-@xmath10 nn force components provide the most dominant contribution to the qfs cross sections with much less contributions of higher partial waves .",
    "specifically , in the np qfs geometries the @xmath9-@xmath10 is the dominant force component while for nn qfs it is the @xmath0 force which contributes decisively .",
    "again we exemplify it for nn and np qfs geometries of ref .",
    "@xcite in fig .",
    "[ fig_sensiv_pw_qfsnnnp ] .",
    "such a dominance for the qfs peak is understandable since the qfs cross sections are practically insensitive to the action of the presently available 3nf . then at low energy",
    "the largest contribution should be provided by the s - wave components of the nn potential . in case of free np and nn scattering",
    "these are the @xmath0(np)+@xmath11 and @xmath0(nn ) contributions , respectively . in the simple minded spirit that under qfs condition one of the three nucleons ( at rest in the lab system ) is just a spectator such a dominance of a two - nucleon encounter",
    "is to be expected . in reality",
    ", however , the projectile nucleon also interacts with that `` spectator '' particle and the three nucleons at low energies undergo higher order rescatterings @xcite .",
    "thus the scattering to the final nn ( np ) qfs configuration also receives contributions from the np @xmath12 ( nn @xmath13 ) interaction .",
    "despite of all that the numerical results clearly reveal that for the np qfs configuration the @xmath12 force is the most dominant contribution and for the nn qfs it is the @xmath14 force ( for free nn scattering there is no @xmath12 interaction possible ) .",
    "this implies that the nn qfs is a powerful tool to study the @xmath14 nn force component .    that extreme sensitivity of the nn qfs cross section to the @xmath15 nn force component is demonstrated in fig .  [ fig_1s0nn_changes_qfs ] for the qfs geometries of ref .",
    "to that aim we multiplied the @xmath14 nn matrix element of the cd bonn potential by a factor @xmath16 .",
    "the result is , that the nn qfs cross section undergoes significant variations while the np qfs cross section is practically unchanged .",
    "the displayed @xmath17-parameters include also the value @xmath18 which is necessary to get agreement with the nn qfs data of ref.@xcite .    while both , @xmath0 and @xmath11 , np forces are well determined by np scattering data ( with the restrictions mentioned above ) and by the deuteron properties , the @xmath0 nn force is determined up to now only indirectly due to lack of free nn data .",
    "the disagreement between data and theory in the nn qfs peak points to the possibility of a flaw in the nn @xmath0 force .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that in order to remove the @xmath7 discrepancy found in @xcite for the nn qfs cross section required an increased strength of the @xmath0 nn interaction which when given in terms of a factor @xmath17 amounts to @xmath19 . in fig .",
    "[ ann_reff_fac ] we show the effect of the @xmath16-modification for the nn scattering length @xmath20 and for the effective range parameter @xmath21 , and in fig .",
    "[ ebind1s0_fac ] for the binding energy of two neutrons in the @xmath0 state .",
    "it is seen that taking @xmath22 leads to a nearly bound state of two neutrons .",
    "since the multiplication of the @xmath0 potential matrix element by a factor @xmath17 induces changes in the effective range as well as in the scattering length the question arises , which from both effects is more important for the nn qfs cross section variations ? to answer that question we performed 3n faddeev calculations based on the next - to - leading ( nlo ) order @xmath1pt potential @xcite including all np and nn forces up to the total angular momentum @xmath23 in the two - nucleon subsystem .",
    "the @xmath0 component of that interaction is composed of the one - pion exchange potential and contact interactions parametrized by two parameters @xmath24 and @xmath25 @xmath26 standard values are @xmath27  gev@xmath28 and @xmath29  gev@xmath30 for cut - off combinations @xmath31  mev , @xmath32  mev } @xcite .    multiplying @xmath24 by a factor @xmath33 and @xmath25 by a factor @xmath34 one can induce changes of the nn @xmath0 interaction . requiring either the value of the scattering length @xmath20 or the value of the effective range parameter @xmath21 to be constant correlates the @xmath34 and @xmath33 factors .",
    "changing @xmath35 and @xmath33 in such a way that the scattering length is kept constant and equal @xmath36  fm leads to changes of the effective range @xmath21 shown in fig .",
    "[ reff_from_c1_c2_new ] .",

    "similarily , changing @xmath34 and @xmath33 while keeping the effective range constant to @xmath39  fm , leads to changes of the nn @xmath0 scattering length @xmath20 shown in fig .",
    "[ ann_from_c1_c2_new ] .",

    "[ e26p0_qfs_nlo_ann ] for four values of the nn @xmath0 scattering length ranging from @xmath40  fm to @xmath41  fm .",
    "it is clearly seen that the nn qfs cross sections depend only slightly on a change of the scattering length .",
    "the variations of the qfs cross section maximum stays below @xmath42 . on the other side",
    "much stronger variations of the nn qfs cross sections result from changes of the effective range ( see fig .",
    "[ e26p0_qfs_nlo_reff ] ) .",
    "thus we can conclude that the @xmath17-enhancement mechanism for the @xmath0 nn force studied in @xcite acts mainly through the change of the effective range parameter .",
    "thus in order to remove the discrepancies found in @xcite and @xcite for the nn qfs cross section a change of the nn @xmath0 effective range parameter is required .",
    "its value taken under the assumption of charge symmetry and charge independence of nuclear forces is @xmath39  fm and it has to be changed to @xmath43  fm .",
    "that implies a large charge symmetry and charge independence breaking effect of about @xmath44 for that parameter .",
    "we would like to add that the discussed changes of @xmath21 did not affect the elastic nd cross section nor vector or tensor analysing powers to a measurable extent . only more complicated spin observables in elastic nd scattering",
    "are affected but the present day experimental errors are much larger than those changes .",
    "is such a large isospin breaking effect at all possible in view of the present understanding of nuclear forces ?",
    "first of all it seems unprobable that only the effective range would reveal large isospin breaking and the scattering length will be left unaffected . in @xmath1pt the leading isospin breaking contribution is provided by isospin breaking contact interaction without derivatives @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the effective range parameter is quite insensitive to that isospin breaking contact force and typical isospin breaking effects for @xmath21 are small and under @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "the reported discrepancies for nn qfs require however a much larger effect for @xmath21 of the order @xmath44 .",
    "only when the contact terms in next orders would be unnaturally large one could expect larger isospin breaking effects for @xmath21 . assuming naturalness it seems rather unprobable",
    ".    since it seems unlikely that isospin breaking effects will show up , if at all , in the effective range parameter alone without affecting simultaneously the nn scattering length , the question of a possible existence of a bound state of two neutrons reappears .",
    "present day nn interactions allow only one bound state of two nucleons , namely the deuteron , where the neutron and the proton are interacting in a state with angular momenta @xmath46 or @xmath47 , total spin @xmath48 , and total angular momentum @xmath49 .",
    "when the neutron and proton are interacting with the @xmath0 force no bound state exists and only a virtual resonant state occurs as documented by the negative scattering length @xmath50  fm .",
    "also the data for the proton - proton system exclude a @xmath0 pp bound state ; however in this case the nuclear force is overpowered by the strong pp coulomb repulsion .",
    "assuming charge - independence and charge - symmetry of strong interactions also the two neutrons should not bind in the @xmath0 state .",
    "it also seems that modern nuclear forces do not allow for the 3n and 4n systems to be bound @xcite .",
    "however , in view of the strong discrepancies between theory and data found in the nd breakup measurements for the nn qfs geometry , which can not be explained by present day nuclear forces , it appears reasonable to check experimentally the possibility of two neutrons being bound .",
    "there are reactions which provide conditions advantegous for a hypothetical di - neutron bound state .",
    "such conditions can be found e.g. when two neutrons are moving with equal momenta and with relative energy close to zero .",
    "that occurs in the so called final - state - interaction ( fsi ) geometry of the nd breakup .",
    "incomplete nd breakup measurements have been performed in the past to study properties of the @xmath0 nn force @xcite .",
    "even a dedicated experiment was performed in order to look for a hypothetical @xmath0 nn bound state @xcite in which the spectrum of the proton going in forward direction has been measured with the aim of a precise determination of its high energy region .",
    "the negative result of @xcite showed that the nd reaction is not suitable for such a study .",
    "it seems that much more appropriate would be reactions in which from the begining two neutrons occupy a configuration advantegous for their binding .",
    "it is known @xcite that @xmath51he is predominantely a spatially symmetric s state with its two protons mainly in opposite spin states .",
    "this component amounts for @xmath52 of the @xmath51he wave function .",
    "similarily , the two neutrons in @xmath51h are restricted to be in a spin - singlet state .",
    "that makes the triton target a very suitable tool to look for a nn bound state in @xmath53 induced breakup of @xmath51h .",
    "the idea is to measure the spectra of the outgoing protons in such a reaction .",
    "the two - neutron bound state , if existant , should reveal itself as a peak above the highest available proton energy from the 3-body decay of @xmath51h .",
    "we show in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] to [ fig2 ] the outgoing proton spectra from the @xmath54 reaction for a number of @xmath53 energies and angles of the outgoing protons .",
    "the big advantage of that reaction is that @xmath53 interacts predominantely with the proton .",
    "also other reactions , such as e.g. @xmath51h(n , d)nn and @xmath51h(d,@xmath51he)nn , provide conditions advantegous for two neutrons to bind .",
    "they are complimentary and independent from the @xmath51h(@xmath53,p)nn reaction and the data from all three processes should provide an answer to the question whether two neutrons can form a bound state .",
    "the reaction @xmath51h(d,@xmath51he)nn can not presently be treated in a theoretically rigorous manner , however with the rapid increase in computer power such a treatment based on fadeev - yakubovsky equations can be expected in the near future .",
    "the strong discrepancy in the nn qfs nd break up configuration found in @xcite is reconsidered .",
    "it is documented again that at low energies ( below @xmath8  mev ) the nn ( np ) qfs cross section depends dominantly only on the @xmath0 ( @xmath11 ) nn force component and higher partial wave contributions are quite small .",
    "furthermore the theoretical results are quite stable under exchange of the standard nuclear forces .",
    "also the present day available 3n forces have negligible effect on the qfs configurations .",
    "since no direct measurement of the nn force is available there is the possibility that the properties of the nn force are still unsettled .",
    "thus simply multiplying the nn @xmath55 force matrix element by a factor @xmath56 one can perfectly well reconcile theory and data .",
    "in addition we performed a more detailed study using the nlo chiral potential , which is composed of the one - pion exchange and contact interactions depending on two parameters . that dependence allowed us to study separately variations in the scattering length @xmath57 leaving the effective range parameter @xmath58 constant and vice versa .",
    "thereby it turned out that the nn qfs peak height is very sensitive to @xmath58 and hardly sensitive to @xmath57 .",
    "the outcome for an agreement with the data is the requirement that @xmath58 decreases from the value @xmath59  fm to a significantly smaller one , @xmath60  fm .",
    "that strongly breaks charge symmetry and charge independence and is not supported by present day chiral potential theory .",
    "so , what might be a solution to remove the discrepancy ?    if the data are taken for granted there remains the possibility that a di - neutron exists .",
    "we propose additional experimental investigations , like the @xmath61 process and evaluated the proton spectra at various emission angles emphasizing its high energy region .",
    "the direct inclusion of @xmath62-degrees of freedom into @xmath1pt allows for a rich set of additional nn and 3n force diagrams which are presently under investigation @xcite",
    ". this might reconcile theory and data also for the space - star discrepancy @xcite in the nd breakup process .",

    "<S> large discrepancies between quasi - free neutron - neutron ( nn ) cross section data from neutron - deuteron ( nd ) breakup and theoretical predictions based on standard nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) and three - nucleon ( 3n ) forces are pointed out . </S>",
    "<S> the nn @xmath0 interaction is shown to be dominant in that configuration and has to be increased to bring theory and data into agreement . using the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) @xmath0 interaction of chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath1pt ) </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the nn qfs cross section only slightly depends on changes of the nn scattering length but is very sensitive to variations of the effective range parameter . in order to account for the reported discrepancies one must decrease the nn effective range parameter by about @xmath2 from its value implied by charge symmetry and charge independence of nuclear forces . </S>"
