    "the search for a mechanism for electroweak symmetry breaking , and in particular for a standard model ( sm ) higgs boson has been a major goal of particle physics for many years , and is a central part of the fermilab tevatron physics program .",
    "both the cdf and experiments have performed new combinations  @xcite of multiple direct searches for the sm higgs boson .",
    "the new searches include more data and improved analysis techniques compared to previous analyses .",
    "the sensitivities of these new combinations significantly exceed those of previous combinations  @xcite .    in this note , we combine the most recent results of all such searches in  collisions at  .",
    "the analyses combined here seek signals of higgs bosons produced in association with vector bosons ( @xmath8 ) , through gluon - gluon fusion ( @xmath9 ) , and through vector boson fusion ( vbf ) ( @xmath10 ) corresponding to integrated luminosities ranging from 2.0 to 4.8  at cdf and 2.1 to 5.4  at d0 .",
    "the higgs boson decay modes studied are @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 .    to simplify the combination , the searches are separated into 90 mutually exclusive final states ( 36 for cdf and 54 for d0 ; see table  [ tab : cdfacc ] and  [ tab : dzacc ] ) referred to as `` analyses '' in this note .",
    "the selection procedures for each analysis are detailed in refs .",
    "@xcite through  @xcite , and are briefly described below .",
    "event selections are similar for the corresponding cdf and d0 analyses . for the case of ,",
    "an isolated lepton ( @xmath15 electron or muon ) and two jets are required , with one or more @xmath16-tagged jet , i.e. , identified as containing a weakly - decaying @xmath17 hadron .",
    "selected events must also display a significant imbalance in transverse momentum ( referred to as missing transverse energy or ) .",
    "events with more than one isolated lepton are vetoed . for the d0  analyses ,",
    "two and three jet events are analyzed separately , and in each of these samples two non - overlapping @xmath16-tagged samples are defined , one being a single `` tight '' @xmath16-tag ( st ) sample , and the other a double `` loose '' @xmath16-tag ( dt ) sample .",
    "the tight and loose @xmath16-tagging criteria are defined with respect to the mis - identification rate that the @xmath16-tagging algorithm yields for light quark or gluon jets ( `` mistag rate '' ) typically @xmath18 or @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "the final variable is a neural network output which takes as input seven kinematic variables for the two - jet sample , while for the three - jet sample the dijet invariant mass is used . for the cdf  analyses ,",
    "the events are analyzed in two- and three - jet subsamples separately , and in each of these samples the events are grouped into various lepton and @xmath16-tag categories .",
    "in addition to the selections requiring an identified lepton , events with an isolated track failing lepton selection requirements in the two - jet sample , or an identified loose muon in the extended muon coverage in the three - jet sample , are grouped into their own categories .",
    "this provides some acceptance for single prong tau decays . within the lepton categories there are four @xmath16-tagging categories considered in the two - jets sample  two tight @xmath16-tags ( tdt ) , one tight @xmath16-tag and one loose @xmath16-tag ( ldt ) , one tight @xmath16-tag and one looser @xmath16-tag ( ldtx ) , and a single , tight , @xmath16- tag ( st ) .",
    "these @xmath16-tag category names are also used in the three - jets , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 channel descriptions , except the ldtx events are included in st events where the looser @xmath16- tag is ignored .",
    "a bayesian neural network discriminant is trained at each @xmath22 in the test range for the two - jet sample , separately for each category , while for the three - jet sample a matrix element discriminant is used .    for the  analyses ,",
    "the selection is similar to the @xmath23 selection , except all events with isolated leptons are vetoed and stronger multijet background suppression techniques are applied .",
    "both cdf and d0 analyses use a track - based missing transverse momentum calculation as a discriminant against false .",
    "in addition , d0 trains a boosted decision tree to discriminate against the multijet background . there is a sizable fraction of the  signal in which the lepton is undetected that is selected in the  samples , so these analyses are also referred to as @xmath24 .",
    "the cdf analysis uses three non - overlapping samples of events ( tdt , ldt and st as for @xmath23 ) .",
    "d0 uses orthogonal st and tight - loose double - tag ( tldt ) channels .",
    "cdf uses neural - network discriminants as the final variables , while d0 uses boosted decision trees as the advanced analysis technique .",
    "the  analyses require two isolated leptons and at least two jets .",
    "d0 s  analyses separate events into non - overlapping samples of events with one tight @xmath16-tag ( st ) and two loose @xmath16-tags ( dt ) .",
    "cdf separates events into st , tdt , and ldt samples . for the d0 analysis boosted decision trees provide the final variables for setting limits , while cdf uses the output of a two - dimensional neural network . for this combination d0",
    "has increased the signal acceptance by loosening the selection criteria for one of the leptons . in addition a kinematic fit is now applied to the @xmath25boson and jets .",
    "cdf corrects jet energies for  using a neural network approach . in this analysis",
    "the events are divided into three tagging categories : tight double tags , loose double tags , and single tags .",
    "both cdf and d0 further subdivide the channels into lepton categories with different signal - to - background characteristics .    for the  analyses ,",
    "signal events are characterized by a large  and two opposite - signed , isolated leptons .",
    "the presence of neutrinos in the final state prevents the reconstruction of the candidate higgs boson mass .",
    "d0 selects events containing electrons and muons , dividing the data sample into three final states : @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 .",
    "cdf separates the  events in six non - overlapping samples , labeled `` high @xmath29 '' and `` low @xmath29 '' for the lepton selection categories , and also split by the number of jets : 0 , 1 , or 2 + jets .",
    "the sample with two or more jets is not split into low @xmath29 and high @xmath29 lepton categories .",
    "the sixth cdf channel is a new low dilepton mass ( @xmath30 ) channel , which accepts events with @xmath31  gev .",
    "this channel increases the sensitivity of the @xmath12 analyses at low @xmath22 , adding 10% additional acceptance at @xmath32  gev .",
    "cdf s division of events into jet categories allows the analysis discriminants to separate three different categories of signals from the backgrounds more effectively .",
    "the signal production mechanisms considered are @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and the vector - boson fusion process . for @xmath9 , however , recent work  @xcite indicates that the theoretical uncertainties due to scale and pdf variations are significantly different in the different jet categories .",
    "cdf and d0 now divide the theoretical uncertainty on @xmath9 into pdf and scale pieces , and use the differential uncertainties of  @xcite .",
    "d0 uses neural - networks , including the number of jets as an input , as the final discriminant .",
    "cdf likewise uses neural - networks , including likelihoods constructed from matrix - element probabilities ( me ) as input in the 0-jet bin .",
    "all analyses in this channel have been updated with more data and analysis improvements .",
    "the cdf collaboration also contributes an analysis searching for higgs bosons decaying to a tau lepton pair , in three separate production channels : direct @xmath2 production , associated @xmath23 or @xmath35 production , or vector boson production with @xmath0 and forward jets in the final state .",
    "two jets are required in the event selection . in this analysis ,",
    "the final variable for setting limits is a combination of several neural - network discriminants .",
    "the theoretical systematic uncertainty on the @xmath2 production rate now takes into account recent theoretical work  @xcite which provides uncertainties in each jet category .",
    "d0 also contributes an analysis for the final state @xmath36 jet jet , which is sensitive to the @xmath37 , @xmath38 , vbf and gluon gluon fusion ( with two additional jets ) mechanisms .",
    "a neural network output is used as the discriminant variable for runiia ( the first 1.0 fb@xmath39 of data ) , while a boosted decision tree output is used for later data .",
    "the cdf collaboration introduces a new all - hadronic channel , @xmath40 for this combination .",
    "events are selected with four jets , at least two of which are @xmath16-tagged with the tight @xmath16-tagger .",
    "the large qcd backgrounds are estimated with the use of data control samples , and the final variable is a matrix element signal probability discriminant .",
    "the d0 collaboration contributes three  analyses , where the associated @xmath41 boson and the @xmath41 boson from the higgs boson decay that has the same charge are required to decay leptonically , thereby defining three like - sign dilepton final states ( @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 ) containing all decays of the third @xmath41 boson . in this analysis",
    "the final variable is a likelihood discriminant formed from several topological variables .",
    "cdf contributes a  analysis using a selection of like - sign dileptons and a neural network to further purify the signal .",
    "d0 also contributes an analysis searching for direct higgs boson production decaying to a photon pair in 4.2 fb@xmath39 of data . in this analysis ,",
    "the final variable is the invariant mass of the two - photon system .",
    "finally , d0 includes the channel @xmath45 . here",
    "the samples are analyzed independently according to the number of @xmath16-tagged jets ( 1,2,3 , i.e. st , dt , tt ) and the total number of jets ( 4 or 5 ) .",
    "the total transverse energy of the reconstructed objects ( @xmath46 ) is used as discriminant variable .",
    "we normalize our higgs boson signal predictions to the most recent high - order calculations available .",
    "the @xmath9 production cross section is calculated at nnll in qcd and also includes two - loop electroweak effects ; see refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein for the different steps of these calculations .",
    "the newer calculation includes a more thorough treatment of higher - order radiative corrections , particularly those involving @xmath16 quark loops .",
    "the @xmath9 production cross section depends strongly on the pdf set chosen and the accompanying value of @xmath47 .",
    "the cross sections used here are calculated with the mstw 2008 nnlo pdf set  @xcite .",
    "the new @xmath9 cross sections supersede those used in the update of summer 2008  @xcite , which had a simpler treatment of radiative corrections and used the older mrst 2002 pdf set  @xcite .",
    "the higgs boson production cross sections used here are listed in table  [ tab : higgsxsec ]  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we now include the larger theoretical uncertainties due to scale variations and pdf variations separately for each jet bin for the @xmath9 processes as evaluated in  @xcite .",
    "we treat the scale uncertainties as 100% correlated between jet bins and between cdf and d0 , and also treat the pdf uncertainties in the cross section as correlated between jet bins and between cdf and d0 .",
    "we include all significant higgs production modes in the high mass search .",
    "besides gluon - gluon fusion through a virtual top quark loop ( ggh ) , we include production in association with a @xmath41 or @xmath48 vector boson ( vh )  @xcite , and vector boson fusion ( vbf )  @xcite . in order to predict the distributions of the kinematics of higgs boson signal events , cdf and d0 use the pythia  @xcite monte carlo program , with cteq5l or cteq6l  @xcite leading - order ( lo ) parton distribution functions .",
    "the higgs boson decay branching ratio predictions are calculated with hdecay  @xcite , and are also listed in table  [ tab : higgsxsec ] .    for both cdf and d0 , events from multijet ( instrumental ) backgrounds ( `` qcd production '' ) are measured in independent data samples using several different methods .",
    "for cdf , backgrounds from sm processes with electroweak gauge bosons or top quarks were generated using pythia , alpgen  @xcite , mc@nlo  @xcite and herwig  @xcite programs .",
    "for d0 , these backgrounds were generated using pythia , alpgen , and comphep  @xcite , with pythia providing parton - showering and hadronization for all the generators .",
    "these background processes were normalized using either experimental data or next - to - leading order calculations ( including mcfm  @xcite for @xmath49 heavy flavor process ) .",
