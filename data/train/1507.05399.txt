    "for the past decade , evidence for copious amounts of dust ( @xmath9 ) in high - redshift galaxies and quasars with @xmath10 has been reported in many far - infrared ( fir ) and sub - millimeter / millimeter studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , implying that dust should be produced within a very short timescale , less than 1 gyr after the big bang .",
    "the most promising sites of dust formation in such an early universe are believed to be core - collapse supernovae ( ccsne ) , since their progenitors have very short lifetimes ( @xmath11 years ) compared to asymptotic giant branch stars , which are major sources of dust in the local universe @xcite .    to understand the dust formation process in expanding supernova ( sn ) ejecta",
    ", many theoretical studies have been conducted to date @xcite . according to these theoretical studies",
    ", dust can form in an expanding he core with grain species determined by the elemental composition at the formation site .",
    "if an sn ejecta maintains its layered structure during expansion , a variety of grain species can form , e.g. , carbon grains in the helium layer , silicate and oxide grains in the oxygen - rich layer , and si / fe grains in the innermost layer , the amounts of which depend on the progenitor mass . if the sn ejecta is mixed , however , it is mostly silicate and oxide grains that can form .",
    "the size of the grains depends on the gas density at the condensation time . in an sn iip , which has a thick hydrogen envelope , the expansion is slow , so large grains with an average radius of @xmath12 can form @xcite . in an sn iib with a low - mass hydrogen envelope as well as envelope - stripped sne such as type ib / c ,",
    "on the other hand , the sn ejecta expands rapidly , so only small grains with a size less than 0.01 can form @xcite . the size distribution and chemical composition of the dust , however , could be greatly affected by density enhancements due to clumping @xcite .",
    "theoretical studies predict that one ccsn can produce 0.1@xmath13 of sn dust @xcite , but the dust masses obtained from observations of nearby ccsne are much smaller than this , e.g. , @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "a significant ( @xmath15 ) amount of dust has been observed in several young cc supernova remnants ( snrs ) , e.g. , cassiopeia a @xcite , crab @xcite , and 1987a @xcite , but the physical and chemical properties of the dust remain to be explored ( see below ) .",
    "cassiopeia a ( cas a ) , which is a remnant of an sn iib explosion @xcite , is an ideal target for examining the properties of sn dust .",
    "it is quite young ( @xmath16 years ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so the sn ejecta and freshly formed sn dust have not been significantly mixed with the circumstellar / interstellar medium ( csm / ism ) , and it is relatively close ( 3.4 kpc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so the physical and chemical structures can be resolved .",
    "therefore , cas a has been a major target of infrared space missions .",
    "the first direct evidence for sn dust in cas a came from the _ infrared space observatory _ ( _ iso _ ) , which performed mid - infrared ( mir ; 2.445 ) spectroscopic observations toward the bright ejecta shell @xcite .",
    "the continuum spectra had a strong bump peaking at 21 together with a relatively weak bump at 9.5 , and @xcite showed that the spectra can be fitted by two dust components at different temperatures , one at 90 k and the other at 350 k , with pyroxene ( mgsio@xmath17 ) , quartz ( sio@xmath18 ) , and aluminum oxide ( al@xmath18o@xmath17 ) as major components .",
    "the composition and distribution of this `` warm '' sn dust heated by a reverse shock have been studied in detail using the spectral mapping data of the _ spitzer space telescope _",
    "these studies showed that the dust emission exhibits distinct spectral characteristics depending on the sn material with which it is associated .",
    "the most prominent dust emission is that with strong 9 and 21  bumps , which is associated with sn ejecta having strong ar emission lines .",
    "the spectral features agree with the _ iso _ spectra and can be reproduced by mg protosilicate / mgsio@xmath17 , mg@xmath19sio@xmath20 , or sio@xmath18 .",
    "the dust emission associated with sn ejecta having strong ne lines is smooth without any silicate features and can be reproduced by al@xmath18o@xmath17 dust or c glass .",
    "there is yet another type of smooth dust emission associated with x - ray fe emission , but it is probably from swept - up csm @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , @xcite showed that the observed spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of dust emission can be fitted by a physical model in which the snr is expanding into a dense csm , and the mir emission is mostly from silicate grains ( e.g. , mgsio@xmath4 , mg@xmath5sio@xmath6 , and sio@xmath18 ) and mgo .",
    "the estimated total mass of warm dust ranges from 0.008 to 0.054 @xmath21 .    a larger amount of sn dust",
    ", however , appears to reside in the interior of cas a , where the sn ejecta is freely expanding .",
    "the first report was made by @xcite , who claimed the detection of 24 @xmath21 of cold ( 1520 k ) sn dust associated with cas a from an 850  observation .",
    "it was found , however , that at least some of the 850  emission is from a foreground material @xcite , and instead @xcite and @xcite , using the balloon - borne sub - millimeter telescope blast and infrared space telescopes _ akari _ and _ herschel _ , showed that there is faint fir and sub - millimeter emission from cas a that can be fitted by dust at 35 k with a total mass of @xmath22 .",
    "@xcite also identified the fir emission from this `` cool '' dust associated with unshocked sn ejecta ( their `` [ ] '' dust group ) using the _ herschel _ fir data and derived an upper limit of 0.1 @xmath21 for the dust mass .",
    "however , the composition of the cool dust has been undetermined so far because the absorption cross sections of dust grains in the fir are mostly smooth without prominent spectral features .    in this paper , we show that one can explore the characteristics of the cool sn dust in the interior of cas a using extinction in the near - infrared ( nir ) .",
    "recently , we performed nir spectroscopy toward the main ejecta shell of cas a , where we obtained the spectral and kinematical properties of 63 knots bright in [ ]  emission lines @xcite .",
    "most of these knots are sn material , and the extinctions toward these knots show clear evidence for the sn dust , which can be combined with thermal infrared dust emission to infer the dust composition .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec - obs ] ,",
    "we outline our nir spectroscopic observations and data reduction and then briefly describe the public mir and fir imaging data that we used in the paper . in section  [ sec - ext ] , we derive the nir extinction toward the knots using [ ]  line ratios and show that there is a correlation between the extinction and the line - of - sight velocity , which implies extinction by sn dust .",
    "then , in section  [ sec - sed ] , by comparing the nir extinction and the thermal dust infrared sed , we constrain the possible compositions and sizes of the sn dust .",
    "we discuss the implication of our result for dust production in cas a in section  [ sec - dis ] and summarize our paper in section  [ sec - sum ] .",
    "eight long - slit nir spectra of the main sn ejecta shell were obtained on 2008 june 29 and august 8 using triplespec mounted on the palomar hale 5 m telescope ; this spectrograph provides a broadband spectrum simultaneously covering 0.942.46 with a moderate resolving power of @xmath23 .",
    "we also observed the spectra of an a0v standard star ( hd 223386 ) for flux calibration just before and after the target observations . to subtract sky oh airglow emission as well as background continuum ,",
    "the observations were made with either a consecutive abba pattern or on - off mode depending on the complexity of the field .",
    "figure  [ fig - slit](a ) shows the position of the slits on the continuum - subtracted [ ]  1.64  narrow - band image obtained in 2008 august .",
    "we followed a general reduction procedure to make a two - dimensional dispersed image .",
    "numerous sky oh airglow emission lines were used for wavelength calibration , and then we corrected it to the heliocentric reference frame .",
    "the absolute photometric calibration was made by comparing the observed spectrum of the standard star with the kurucz model spectrum @xcite . even though the absolute flux uncertainty goes up to 30%",
    "depending on the centering accuracy of the standard star observation , the relative fluxes are quite robust .",
    "we found a total of 63 infrared knots using a clump - finding algorithm @xcite and performed a single gaussian fit for all the detected emission lines to derive their fluxes and line - of - sight velocities . for detailed descriptions of the data reduction and analysis as well as the full list of parameters of the detected emission lines ,",

    "lee et al .",
    "( 2015 , in preparation ) .      for an sed analysis of sn dust ,",
    "we fully exploit the previously published archival data providing the highest spatial resolution and sensitivity in the mir and fir wavebands covering 10500 , where the dust emission is dominant .    for short wavebands , we use the w3 channel image ( @xmath24 ) of the _ wide - field infrared survey explorer _ ( _ wise _ : * ? ? ? * ) with an angular resolution of @xmath25 .",
    "we first retrieved all 36 single - exposure images ( `` level-1b '' ) from the online service and converted the pixel unit to mjy sr@xmath26 . after subtracting the predicted brightness of zodiacal light calculated from the interplanetary dust model from each frame @xcite , we co - added the individual frames using montage software to obtain the final image . instead of the _ wise _",
    "w4 channel image ( @xmath27 ) , we use the 24  band image of the multiband imaging photometer for _ spitzer _ ( mips : * ? ? ? * ) obtained in 2007 january ( aorkey : 17657088 , 17657344 ) , which provides better spatial resolution ( @xmath28 ) than _ wise _ w4 .",
    "the data used here are the post - bcd image ( `` level 2 '' ) , which is automatically processed by the mips software pipeline ( version : s18.12.0 ) . as in the _ wise _ data , zodiacal light is one of the significant sources of background radiation in this waveband .",
    "we therefore subtracted the background brightness from the mosaic image using the model calculation @xcite .",
    "recent fir images of the remnant were observed with pacs and spire on board _ herschel space observatory _ @xcite in 2009 september and december .",
    "the two instruments have six photometric bands ( 70 , 100 , and 160  for pacs , and 250 , 350 , and 500  for spire ) , and they provide spatial resolutions of @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 , respectively .",
    "the fully calibrated data sets were downloaded from the _ herschel _ science archive , and we use the data product levels of 2.5 and 2.0 for pacs and spire , respectively .",
    "all imaging data have well - established zero - level brightness , whereas the pacs photometer images at level 2.5 do not ( pacs observer s manual - version 2.5.1 ) . to obtain the true zero point of the images",
    ", we calibrated the zero level by comparison with reference images whose zero point is well established . for the reference photometric calibrator , we used 60 and 100  images from improved reprocessing of the _ iras _ survey ( iris : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) together with dirbe 140 and 240  and _ planck _ 350 and 550  maps . in cas",
    "a , synchrotron radiation is a dominant source in the fir waveband .",
    "this nonthermal component is subtracted by using the vla radio image at 6 cm @xcite .",
    "the expected brightness at each isophotal wavelength is extrapolated from the power law @xmath35 ( erg @xmath36 s@xmath26 hz@xmath26 ) . in this paper",
    ", we adopt @xmath37 and @xmath38 erg @xmath36 s@xmath26 hz@xmath26 , which are derived from the total brightness of the remnant at 30 , 44 , 70 , and 100 ghz using _ planck _",
    "@xcite archival data .",
    "we derive the selective extinction or `` color excess '' between 1.26 and 1.64 , @xmath0 , toward the infrared knots from @xmath39_{\\rm int } } { [ f_{1.26}/f_{1.64}]_{\\rm obs } } ,   \\label{eq-01}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the total extinctions at 1.26 and 1.64 , and @xmath42_{\\rm obs}$ ] and @xmath42_{\\rm int}$ ] are the observed and intrinsic flux ratios of the [ ]  1.26 and 1.64  lines , respectively .",
    "these two strong [ ]  lines share the same upper state ( @xmath43 ) , so their intrinsic ratio is fixed by their einstein @xmath44 coefficients and wavelengths , i.e. , @xmath42_{\\rm int } = ( a_{ki,1.26}/1.26)/(a_{ki,1.64}/1.64)$ ] . the ratio has been derived from both theoretical calculations and observations , and it ranges from 0.94 to 1.49 in previous studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "this large uncertainty of the intrinsic flux ratio hampers accurate measurement of the absolute extinction toward the remnant ( this issue will be addressed in section  [ sec - ext - sel ] ) .",
    "it is , however , worth noting that the uncertainty does not affect the difference in @xmath0 ( equation  [ eq-01 ] ) among the knots , which gives the relative extinction to them . in this paper",
    ", we adopt the intrinsic line flux ratio of 1.36 , which is the theoretical value proposed by @xcite and @xcite .      in figure  [ fig - slit](b ) ,",
    "we plot @xmath0 for the 63 infrared knots as a function of position angle .",
    "the colors and symbols represent the characteristic groups classified by @xcite : helium - rich knots in green squares , sulfur - rich knots in red circles , and iron - rich knots in blue diamonds . in short ,",
    "helium - rich knots are slowly moving ( @xmath45 ) knots with strong he i  lines , the properties of which match those of `` quasi - stationary flocculi '' ( qsfs ) , the circumstellar material swept up by an sn blast wave @xcite .",
    "sulfur - rich and iron - rich knots are fast - moving ( @xmath46 ) knots with strong [ ]  and strong [ ]  lines , respectively .",
    "they are sn ejecta material synthesized in different layers of the sn and correspond to fast - moving knots ( fmks ) in previous optical studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". for more detailed explanations on the spectroscopic and kinematic properties of these knots , please refer to @xcite . for comparison , we also plot @xmath0 for the optical and infrared knots measured in previous studies . @xcite",
    "observed optical spectra of five fmks and two qsfs located in the northern bright rim and measured @xmath47 using ratios of the [ ]  and the balmer lines , respectively .",
    "we converted it to @xmath48 assuming the general interstellar dust composition with @xmath49 of 3.1 @xcite , and the open red circles and green squares in the figure represent the fmks and qsfs , respectively .",
    "@xcite performed nir spectroscopy for four slit positions and derived the line ratio of [ ]  1.261.64  for 19 infrared knots without any classification of their origin .",
    "we obtained @xmath0 using equation  [ eq-01 ] and marked the results by black x marks .",
    "the derived @xmath47 varies considerably over the remnant .",
    "it appears that the extinction toward the west is systematically larger than that toward the east , though there is a large scatter .",
    "this systematic variation is well known from previous radio and x - ray observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "for example , the green contours in figure  [ fig - slit](a ) show the column density ( @xmath50 ) map of @xcite obtained from an analysis of the _ chandra _ x - ray data .",
    "the column density is large ( ( 23 ) @xmath51 ) toward the west and southwest directions , and molecular line studies showed that it is due to molecular clouds located in the perseus spiral arm .",
    "figure  [ fig - slit](b ) shows that the extinction varies considerably _ within a slit_. for example , along slit 4 , @xmath0 varies from 0.6 to 1.5 mag even though the emission is from a thin filament .",
    "this variation is significantly larger than what we would expect from the variation in the foreground extinction .",
    "for example , the solid line in the figure represents an expected @xmath0 variation along the ejecta shell derived from the @xmath50 map in figure  [ fig - slit](a ) .",
    "the ejecta shell is determined in the continuum - subtracted [ ]  image where the brightness is greater than 3@xmath52 of the background rms noise , and the mean @xmath50 is obtained at every @xmath53 in position angle .",
    "the column density is converted to @xmath0 using @xmath54 @xcite and @xmath55 .",
    "the dashed - dotted lines represent the maximum and minimum @xmath0 at each position angle .",
    "it is obvious that , in several slits , the variation of @xmath0 within a slit is much larger than the range allowed from the @xmath50 map . as we show in the next section , this large variation is due to extinction _ within the sn ejecta_.      an interesting correlation is found when we plot @xmath0 as a function of radial velocity , which is shown in figure  [ fig - radvel](a ) .",
    "it is clear that the redshifted knots are generally more obscured than the blueshifted knots . because we are observing an expanding shell",
    ", this suggests that the knots on the far side experience more extinction than those on the front side , or that there could be extinction originating _ within _ the remnant . to confirm this `` self - extinction , '' it is necessary to remove the spatially varying foreground interstellar extinction .",
    "we subtract the extinction derived from the x - ray observation ( figure  [ fig - slit ] ) , and the result is shown in figure  [ fig - radvel](b ) .",
    "the correlation becomes slightly weaker , but it is still obvious that the redshifted knots are more heavily obscured than the blueshifted knots .",
    "therefore , our result implies that there is extinction , which might be due to newly formed sn dust within the remnant .",
    "the large scatter in extinction for the same velocity knots might reflect differences among different sight lines , i.e. , non - uniform distribution of sn dust .",
    "note in figure  [ fig - radvel](b ) that the minimum @xmath56 , which means that the @xmath0 derived from the @xmath50 map is higher than the @xmath0 derived from [ ]  line ratios .",
    "we can think of two possibilities for the negative @xmath0 .",
    "first , it could be due to the uncertainty of the theoretical [ ]  line ratio . to compensate for the @xmath0 of @xmath57 mag , however , the theoretical flux ratio of [ ]  1.261.64 should be more than 1.8 , which is considerably higher than the numerical value obtained in previous studies ( @xmath58_{int } \\le 1.49 $ ] ) .",
    "second , the @xmath50 derived from x - ray data could be overestimated . indeed , the mean column density from the x - ray studies is @xmath59 @xcite , which is higher than those of radio observations , e.g. , @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "we also note that the column densities of @xcite are higher by ( 0.40.7 ) @xmath61  @xmath36 than those of @xcite , who carefully analyzed the x - ray spectra around the outer snr shock .",
    "the difference of 0.3 mag in @xmath0 , which corresponds to @xmath62 , may therefore have resulted from the difficulty in background removal in the analysis of @xcite .",
    "another complication is that the x - ray - absorbing column also includes self - extinction , so the x - ray - based extinction overestimates the foreground extinction .",
    "thus it appears difficult to obtain an accurate map of the foreground extinction from the x - ray data alone , but this uncertainty is not likely to erase the systematic correlation in figure  [ fig - radvel](b ) .",
    "the non - uniform spatial distribution of sn dust and the uncertainty in the foreground extinction hamper the analysis of the correlation in figure  [ fig - radvel](b ) . however , in one slit ( slit 4 ) , we detected convincing evidence for self - extinction without those sight - line - dependent complications .",
    "figures  [ fig - pv5](a ) and ( b ) show that the velocity structure of the [ ] -line - emitting gas in slit 4 is `` arc''-like , suggesting that the slit crosses a portion of an expanding shell .",
    "this is consistent with the result of previous studies that the main ejecta shell is a thin shell expanding at 40005000 @xmath63 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in slit 4 ,",
    "therefore , we have both blue and redshifted fe knots along a given sight line , and the uncertainty due to different sight lines disappears . now figure  [ fig - pv5](c ) shows the @xmath0 map obtained for pixels with an [ ]  1.64  brightness greater than 3@xmath52 above the background noise .",
    "a systematic increase in the extinction toward the redshifted knots is apparent .",
    "we computed an intensity - weighted @xmath0 as a function of radial velocity , which is shown by the black solid line in figure  [ fig - pv5](d ) .",
    "we also divided the iron filament into three subregions along the slit ( a  c in figure  [ fig - pv5](c ) ) , and their mean @xmath0 values are over - plotted on the figure with red , green , and blue solid lines .",
    "the total @xmath0 within the ejecta shell from figure  [ fig - pv5](d ) is @xmath1 mag with a systematic gradient of @xmath64 mag per 1000 km s@xmath26 .",
    "this should be mostly , if not entirely , due to sn dust because the blue and redshifted ejecta materials in the slit are essentially along the same sight line .",
    "there are small - scale variations in @xmath0 in figure  [ fig - pv5](d )",
    ". they could be due to either incomplete subtraction of oh airglow emissions ( e.g. , gray - hatched areas in the figure ) or very small dust clumps within the slit , or both .    the obtained @xmath0 can be converted to the dust column density ( @xmath65 ) with an appropriate @xmath66 ( @xmath67 g@xmath26 ) , where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the mass absorption coefficients at 1.26 and 1.64 , respectively : @xmath70 this equation yields the column density of a given dust species required to explain the observed nir self - extinction .",
    "for example , if it is fe dust , which has @xmath71 @xmath67 g@xmath26 ( * ? ?",
    "* see figure  [ fig - size ] ) , the required dust column is @xmath72 g @xmath36 .",
    "what dust species would produce the @xmath0 of 0.2 mag detected in slit 4 ? in this section , we constrain the dust species by investigating the fir emission properties of sn dust .",
    "figure  [ fig - profile](a ) shows the one - dimensional ( 1d ) brightness profiles at 12 , 24 , 70 , and 100  along the slit length in slit 4 .",
    "note that these data have similar angular resolutions of @xmath29@xmath30 ( section  [ sec - obs - mir ] ) .",
    "the profiles are background - subtracted using the mean brightnesses of an area just outside the ejecta shell ( red square in figure  [ fig - profile](b ) ) and are normalized by their peak brightnesses .",
    "all four profiles have maxima at @xmath73 where the iron filament is located ( figure  [ fig - pv5 ] ) .",
    "all emission drops to zero inside of the ejecta shell except for the 100  emission , which remains constant at @xmath74% of its peak brightness .",
    "this excess emission at 100  must be mostly from the unshocked cool sn dust detected previously in the fir @xcite .",
    "we examine the seds at two positions ( see figure  [ fig - profile](a ) ) : ( 1 ) the peak brightness position at @xmath73 with @xmath75 aperture ( hereafter position a ) and ( 2 ) the inner 100  excess region between @xmath76 and @xmath77 ( hereafter position b ) . for comparison , we also derive an interstellar dust sed just outside of the shell ( red square in figure  [ fig - profile](b ) ) where the radiation from the remnant is almost negligible . to derive accurate parameters for the sn dust , we first have to subtract the contributions of line emissions from the measured brightnesses .",
    "for this purpose , we retrieved the archival mir and fir spectra from _ spitzer _",
    "irs and _ iso _ lws observations , respectively .",
    "we produced an irs spectral data cube using cubism @xcite and extracted 1d spectra within a @xmath28 aperture at positions a and b as well as the background position .",
    "the strong emission lines falling in the _ wise _ w3 and mips 24  bands are the [ ]  8.99 , [ ]  10.5 , [ ]  12.8 , [ ]  15.6 , and [ ] + [ ]  25.9  lines , and their contributions to the fluxes in the two bands have been estimated as 8.9% and 4.8% for position a , 4.6% and 16% for position b , and 2.0% and 1.8% for the background position , respectively .",
    "there are no corresponding fir spectroscopic data , but an _ iso _ lws 1d spectrum ( 43190 ) from an area close ( @xmath78 ) to slit 4 is available ( # 3 spectrum of @xcite ) . according to this _ iso _ spectrum , the strong emission lines falling in the pacs 70 and 100  bands are the [ ]  63.2 and [ ]  88.4  lines , respectively .",
    "estimation of the contribution of these lines to the observed surface brightnesses at our positions is tricky because the _ iso _ lws beam is large , i.e. , @xmath79 @xcite , and covers both the cas a ejecta shell and the background area .",
    "we estimated the line contribution by assuming that both emission lines come from the ejecta shell , not from the interstellar material .",
    "this assumption is plausible because the two lines are detected at several positions along the ejecta shell to show similar broad profiles , whereas there is little emission outside of the remnant @xcite . under this assumption , the two lines contribute only to the brightness of a , which is estimated as 3.8% and 4.5% in the pacs 70 and 100  bands , respectively . in the pacs 160  band , there is the [ ]  146  line , but its contribution is almost negligible .",
    "the observed and line - subtracted dust continuum brightnesses at the three positions are listed in table  [ tab - sed ] .",
    "figure  [ fig - sed ] shows the line - emission - subtracted seds at positions a and b in red and blue solid lines , respectively .",
    "both seds have broad thermal emission bumps peaking at 160 , which arise from the line - of - sight interstellar dust component at a temperature of @xmath80 k. this fir sed matches well the sed of the background area outside the shell ( black solid line ) , which represents the interstellar dust sed .",
    "the background - subtracted seds , which presumably represent `` pure '' sn dust seds , are shown in red and blue dotted lines in figure  [ fig - sed ] .",
    "the sed at a now shows maximum brightness at 24 , and the brightness decreases toward longer wavelengths . on the other hand ,",
    "that at b peaks at 100 , which implies that the dust temperature is much lower than that at a. these two seds should represent the seds of shocked ( + unshocked ) and unshocked dust species , respectively .",
    "we will analyze the sed at position a , where we obtained self - extinction of @xmath81 .    before doing a detailed analysis in the next section ,",
    "we first show that the shocked warm dust component emitting the mir emission can not explain the nir color excess that we detected .",
    "previous observations showed that the warm dust is silicate grains ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , and we assume that it is mgsio@xmath4 grains with a size of 0.0010.1 , which has @xmath82 @xmath83 g@xmath26 @xcite .",
    "( as we will show in the next section , assuming other silicate dust species will yield the same conclusion . )",
    "the sed at a has excess emission in the fir , and we perform a two - temperature modified blackbody fit assuming that the cool dust has the optical properties of general interstellar dust @xcite , as in @xcite .",
    "the surface brightness of each component at temperature @xmath84 is calculated from @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the mass absorption coefficient , and @xmath87 is the planck function .",
    "we used mpfit @xcite , which is a nonlinear least - squares fitting routine within idl , to derive the values of @xmath84 and @xmath65 at which @xmath88 is minimum as well as their formal 1@xmath52 uncertainties .",
    "the sed is well fitted with warm dust at @xmath89 k plus cool dust at @xmath90 k ( figure  [ fig - sed ] ) . from this two - component fitting",

    ", we discuss these two possibilities .    in the slit 4 position",
    ", the reverse shock is now encountering pure fe ejecta in the innermost region @xcite . considering this , cool sn dust",
    "mainly consisting of fe grains seems to be reasonable .",
    "the small size also appears to be consistent with the theoretical prediction that the average radius of newly formed sn dust grains in sn iib is smaller than 0.01  because of low gas density in the expanding sn ejecta @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", theory also predicts that the gas density of the innermost ejecta is too low to produce pure fe grains when the temperature of the region drops to 800 k , at which fe grains can start to coagulate , so pure fe dust is not expected to form in sne iib @xcite .",
    "however , the above conclusion assumes a spherically symmetric explosion with homogeneous and stratified ejecta .",
    "if the gas density is inhomogeneous and/or the sn explosion is asymmetric , we can not rule out the possibility of pure fe grain formation in the innermost sn ejecta , where the gas density is relatively high @xcite . indeed , the ejecta material emitting [ ]",

    "another possible grain species responsible for the large @xmath129 mag is large si grains .",
    "this possibility may be supported by previous infrared studies ; _ spitzer _ spectral mapping observations found strong [ ]  emission together with [ ]  and [ ]  lines in the interior of the remnant , which arises from the unshocked sn ejecta photoionized by uv and x - ray emission from the bright rim ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the presence of ionized silicon in the interior supports the suggestion that the cool dust could be si and/or silicate grains .",

    "it is reasonably well established that there are two sn dust components in cas a : warm ( @xmath2 k ) dust swept up by the reverse shock and cool ( 3040 k ) , unshocked dust residing in the interior of the remnant .",
    "the composition of the warm dust is relatively well specified from its mir spectral features : mg - silicates , sio@xmath18 , al@xmath18o@xmath17 , and/or c glass .",
    "the estimated total mass of warm dust ranges from 0.008 to 0.054 @xmath21 .",
    "the composition of the cool dust has been essentially unknown because in the fir , the sed is mostly smooth without prominent spectral features . assuming the fir absorption coefficients of the general interstellar dust @xcite or silicates @xcite",
    ", a total mass of @xmath137 has been obtained .",
    "our analysis also showed that there are warm and cool dust components in the southern ejecta shell .",
    "the derived temperature ( 80120 k ) and composition ( mgsio@xmath17 , mg@xmath18sio@xmath99 , or sio@xmath18 ) of the warm dust are consistent with previous results . for the cool dust , we were able to show for the first time that its composition is either small fe or large si grains .",
    "their temperatures are 3050 k. these grains are not expected in uniformly expanding stratified sn ejecta , but they can possibly form in dense clumps .    at first glance ,",
    "the different compositions of warm and cool dust appear to be incompatible if we consider that the cool dust is swept up by the reverse shock and subsequently turns into warm dust with a temperature of @xmath2 k. however , this can be understood if we consider that the sn ejecta is clumped . as we pointed out above , the cool dust responsible for the nir extinction resides in dense clumps .",
    "when the dense clumps are swept up by the reverse shock , the shock speed is slow ( e.g. , @xmath138 ) , and the gas temperature is below @xmath139 k @xcite , so the dust grains in the clumps are not heated to high temperature . on the other hand , when the diffuse ejecta is swept up by the reverse shock , the gas is heated to x - ray - emitting temperature ( @xmath140  k ) , and the dust grains there are heated by collisions with electrons to high temperature . therefore , it is the shock - heated warm grains in the diffuse ejecta that emit most of the mir and fir ( @xmath141 ) emission ( figure  [ fig - sed ] ) , and their compositions could be different from those of grains in dense clumps . in summary",
    ", our observation can be explained if the sn ejecta is clumped and the grain species in diffuse material and dense clumps are different , i.e. , silicate grains in the diffuse material and small fe or large si grains in the dense clumps .",
    "the cool dust that we detected could reside either in unshocked or shocked clumps , and it is these cool grains that are responsible for the nir extinction .",
    "when the cool dust is pure fe grains , we can make a crude estimation of the dust formation efficiency from our observation .",
    "the required fe dust mass density of ( 25 ) @xmath142 g @xmath36 corresponds to an fe nucleus column density of ( 25 ) @xmath143 @xmath36 . for comparison , the characteristic size of [ ] -line - emitting clumps is @xmath144 or 0.08 pc at 3.4 kpc , and their average electron density is @xmath145 @xmath136 @xcite . for pure fe",
    "ejecta clumps , because fe is mostly in fe@xmath146 , it means that the number density of fe atoms is @xmath145 @xmath136 , and the characteristic fe column density in the gas phase of fe ejecta clumps is @xmath147 @xmath36 .",
    "therefore , if there are @xmath148 such clumps along the sight line where @xmath149 in slit 4 , we obtain a dust - to - gas ratio of @xmath150 .",
    "the total flux of cool dust at 100  in the global sed is @xmath151 jy @xcite .",
    "the mass has been estimated to be @xmath22 if we adopt the fir absorption coefficients for silicates from @xcite .",
    "the contribution of small fe or large si grains to this mass budget would depend on the volume filling factor of the clumps but is probably not large . to address this issue",
    ", one may carry out an analysis similar to that in this paper toward the entire ejecta shell .",
    "we performed nir spectroscopic observations of cas a in which we obtained the spectral and kinematical properties of 63 [ ] -line - emitting knots spread over the main ejecta shell .",
    "all of the knots show strong [ ]  1.26 and 1.64  lines , the ratio of which provides a direct measure of the extinction . from an analysis of the extinction toward individual knots",
    ", we showed that the nir extinction is due in part to sn dust within the remnant .",
    "we explored the nature of the sn dust responsible for the nir extinction by analyzing its thermal infrared emission .",
    "our main results are summarized below .",
    "we found that [ ]  emission from redshifted sn ejecta is in general more heavily obscured than that from blueshifted sn ejecta ( figure  [ fig - radvel ] ) .",
    "we interpret the correlation as evidence for newly formed sn dust within the remnant .",
    "the amount of excess extinction varies considerably from one sight line to another , which suggests a highly non - uniform distribution of sn dust .",
    "one slit ( slit 4 ) is located across the southern [ ]  ejecta filament , which has the velocity structure of an expanding shell . along this particular sight line , we measured an excess nir extinction of @xmath81 mag between the front and back sides of the shell , which must be entirely due to sn dust ( figure  [ fig - pv5 ] ) .",
    "we analyzed the sed of thermal dust emission toward slit 4 to show that there are warm ( @xmath2 k ) and cool ( @xmath3 k ) sn dust components along the sight line ( figure  [ fig - sed ] ) . among the grain species predicted from theoretical dust formation models in ccsne , only silicate grains ( i.e. , mgsio@xmath17",
    ", mg@xmath18sio@xmath99 , sio@xmath18 ) can match the sed of warm sn dust which has a sharp 24  peak .",
    "the nir extinction due to these warm silicate dust grains is negligible , so the observed excess nir extinction should be due to the cool sn dust .",
    "\\4 . according to our analysis",
    ", only two grain species can explain both the seds of cool dust and the nir excess extinction : ( 1 ) small ( @xmath7 ) fe grains or ( 2 ) large ( @xmath8 ) si grains .",
    "however , neither would be consistent with the dust formation theory for sn iib with uniformly expanding , layered ejecta ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which predicts the formation of only small ( @xmath152 ) si grains and no fe grains .",
    "however , if the sn ejecta is clumpy , we might expect that fe grains and large si grains can be produced in dense clumps .",
    "we suggest that the unshocked sn ejecta is clumpy and the grain species in diffuse material and dense clumps are different , i.e. , silicate grains in diffuse material and small fe or large si grains in dense clumps . in the shocked ejecta , both still exist , but it is the shock - heated warm grains in the diffuse ejecta that emit most of the mir and fir ( @xmath141 ) emission . the cool dust that we detected could reside in either unshocked or shocked clumps , and it is these cool grains that are responsible for the nir extinction .",
    "the contribution of each grain species to the total mass ( @xmath15 ) of cool sn dust in cas a remains to be explored .",
