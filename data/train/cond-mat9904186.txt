    "the layered organic molecular crystals @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1x ( where bedt - ttf is bis-(ethylenedithia - tetrathiafulvalene ) and x is an anion ( e.g. , x = i@xmath2 , cu[n(cn)@xmath1]br , cu(scn)@xmath1 ) ) are particularly interesting because they are strongly correlated electron systems with similarities to the high-@xmath4 cuprate superconductors including unconventional metallic properties and competition between antiferromagnetism and superconductivity @xcite .",
    "furthermore , they are available in high purity single crystals and , in contrast to the cuprates , their lower superconducting transition temperature ( @xmath5k ) makes experimentally accessible in steady magnetic fields properties such as the upper critical field and shubnikov - de haas oscillations@xcite .",
    "recently it has been argued that a minimal theoretical model that can describe these materials is a hubbard model on an anisotropic triangular lattice with one hole per site@xcite .",
    "calculations at the level of the random - phase approximation@xcite and the fluctuation - exchange approximation@xcite suggest that at the boundary of the antiferromagnetic phase this model exhibits superconductivity mediated by spin fluctuations . as the anisotropy of the intersite hopping varies the model changes from the square lattice to the isotropic triangular lattice to decoupled chains@xcite .",
    "the wavevector associated with the antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations changes@xcite and the superconductivity has been predicted to change from d - wave singlet ( as in the cuprates ) to s - wave triplet in the odd - frequency channel@xcite .",
    "experimental results that are consistent with unconventional superconductivity include the temperature dependence of the nmr relaxation rate @xmath6 ( including the absence of a hebel - slichter peak)@xcite , the temperature and magnetic field dependence of the electronic specific heat@xcite , the temperature dependence of the thermal conductivity,@xcite and the sensitivity of @xmath4 to disorder @xcite .",
    "the temperature dependence of the nmr knight shift ( which measures the electron spin susceptibility ) in the superconducting state provides a means to distinguish triplet and singlet pairing . for triplet pairing the knight shift",
    "does not change on entering the superconducting state , whereas for singlet pairing the knight shift goes to zero as the temperature decreases to zero .",
    "the knight shift of @xmath7c nmr on the x = cu[n(cn)@xmath8br is consistent with the latter .",
    "in contrast , the knight shift of @xmath9o nmr on sr@xmath10ruo@xmath11 is consistent with the former.@xcite    if the superconductivity is spin singlet then the upper critical field can not exceed the paramagnetic limit @xmath12 , also known as the pauli limit or clogston - shandrasekhar limit@xcite . above @xmath12 the cooper pairs",
    "are destroyed by the zeeman splitting produced by the magnetic field coupling to the electronic spins . for weak - coupling bcs theory @xmath13 for @xmath14",
    "k , as in the material studied here , this gives @xmath15 t. strong coupling effects@xcite and d - wave pairing@xcite only change this value of @xmath12 slightly . in most superconductors",
    "the paramagnetic limit is irrelevant because the superconductivity is destroyed at much lower fields due to the frustration of the orbital degrees of freedom associated with the formation of vortices .",
    "however , in layered superconductors with fields parallel to the layers the vortices can fit between the layers and paramagnetic limiting can become important.@xcite    previous determinations of the upper critical field of the @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1x family@xcite have mostly focussed on measurements of the slope @xmath16 near @xmath4 .",
    "the values obtained for x = cu[n(cn)@xmath1]br and x = cu(scn)@xmath1 are in the range 10 to 20 t / k .",
    "using the whh formula@xcite for a three - dimensional superconductor , this very large slope would suggest a zero - temperature @xmath17 70 - 140 t , which is well above the bcs pauli limit .",
    "a previous transport measurement on the x = cu(scn)@xmath1 salt was carried out in pulsed magnet fields.@xcite a quasi - linear temperature dependence was found with @xmath1825 t and the authors concluded that the upper critical field exceeded the pauli limit .",
    "a study of the upper critical field of x = cu(cn)[n(cn)@xmath8@xcite determined from the resistive transition found an upper critical field of about 25 t for fields parallel to the layers .",
    "studies on the lower t@xmath19 organic compounds such as the @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1i@xmath2@xcite , @xmath20-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1i@xmath2 , and @xmath20-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1ibr@xmath21@xcite have found that the @xmath22 at zero temperature lies below or close to the pauli paramagnetic limit predicted by bcs theory .",
    "similar paramagnetic field limited @xmath22 have been reported in the cuprate yba@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath23@xcite and the heavy fermion superconductors upd@xmath1al@xmath2@xcite .",
    "if there is paramagnetic limiting there is theoretically the possibility that as the magnetic field is increased at low temperatures there is a first - order phase transition into non - uniform superconducting state , originally proposed by fulde and ferrell and larkin and ovchinikov@xcite .",
    "as the dimensionality of the system decreases the magnetic field range over which this phase is stable increases.@xcite such a first - order phase transition was recently seen in ultrathin beryllium films.@xcite it is still controversial about whether this phase does exist in upd@xmath1al@xmath24@xcite . on the other hand , if the superconductivity is triplet there is also the possibility of re - entrant superconductivity at high fields such that @xmath25 actually increases with increasing field@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we report the measurement of the interlayer resistivity of x = cu(scn)@xmath1 down to 0.5 k and up to 30 t for a range of field directions . for magnetic fields parallel to the layers , the upper critical field increases approximately linearly with decreasing temperature to values that clearly exceed the bcs pauli limiting field ( [ bpauli ] ) , but are consistent with the paramagnetic limit , estimated directly from the superconducting condensation energy .",
    "the upper critical field as a function of angle shows a sharp cusp for fields almost parallel to the layers , consistent with two - dimensional decoupled layers .",
    "we find no evidence of a first order phase transition as a function of field at low temperatures .",
    "we now briefly summaries some theoretical results concerning the upper critical field which we will use later in interpreting our results .",
    "a more complete discussion can be found in reference .",
    "anisotropic ginzburg - landau theory is valid when the coherence length perpendicular to the layers , @xmath26 , is much larger than the interlayer spacing .",
    "it predicts that the dependence of the upper critical field on the angle @xmath27 between the field and the normal to the layers is@xcite @xmath28 ^{2}+\\left [   \\frac{h_{c2}(\\theta ) \\sin ( \\theta ) } { h_{c2\\parallel } } \\right ] ^{2}=1 , \\label{anisot}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the upper critical field for fields perpendicular and parallel to the layers , respectively .",
    "the perpendicular upper critical field is determined by @xmath31 , the coherence length parallel to the layers , @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the flux quantum .",
    "the coherence lengths parallel and perpendicular to the layers are related by @xmath34    klemm , luther , and beasley considered the upper critical field of layered superconductors when the layers were infinitely thin.@xcite for both lawrence - doniach theory and microscopic theory , they found that for fields parallel to the layers , if the interlayer coupling is sufficiently weak the upper critical field diverges at low temperatures unless spin - orbit effects or paramagnetic limiting is present .",
    "this is because the josephson vortices associated with the field parallel to the layers have no normal core and can fit between the layers .",
    "bulaevskii@xcite and schneider and schmidt@xcite considered a more general model where the layers have a finite thickness @xmath35 , resulting in a finite upper critical field @xmath36 they also found that if the coupling between the layers is sufficiently weak then the angular dependence of the upper critical field is given by @xmath37 ^{2}=1 \\label{tink}\\ ] ] this same angular dependence was found earlier for thin two - dimensional films by tinkham using a simple fluxoid quantization argument.@xcite the main difference from the anisotropic three - dimensional result is that at @xmath3890@xmath39 , @xmath40 from eqn .",

    "bulaevskii@xcite considered the case where the paramagnetic limit is larger than the upper critical field for fields perpendicular to the layers but smaller than the upper critical field determined by orbital effects for fields parallel to the layers .",

    "the metallic phase has a finite pauli spin susceptibility @xmath47 compared to the vanishing susceptibility ( at zero temperature ) of a spin singlet superconducting state .",
    "hence , it will be energetically favorable to destroy the superconducting state when the magnetic energy density gained by the difference in susceptibilities exceeds the superconducting condensation energy density @xmath48 .",
    "the critical field @xmath12 at which this occurs is given by@xcite @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the magnetic permeability of free space .",
    "in bcs theory the condensation energy density is @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the metallic density of states and @xmath53 is the zero - temperature energy gap . making using of these relations and @xmath54 we obtain the expression ( [ bpauli ] ) for @xmath55 .",
    "_ many - body effects_. in the @xmath56-(bedt - ttf)@xmath10x crystals there are significant many - body effects ; the electron effective mass @xmath57 determined from magnetic oscillations can be two to five times larger than that predicted by band structure calculations.@xcite the effect of this on the paramagnetic limit needs to be taken into account .",
    "perez - gonzalez@xcite finds that the paramagnetic limiting field is enhanced by a factor of @xmath58 .",
    "however , he did not take into account the simultaneous effect on the zeeman splitting : the @xmath59 factor changes to @xmath60 .",
    "when this is done one finds that within a fermi liquid framework the pauli limit is actually reduced from ( [ bpauli ] ) by a factor of @xmath61.@xcite this ratio can be estimated from thermodynamic measurements or from the spin - splitting of magnetic oscillations.@xcite the values obtained by these two methods for x = cu(scn)@xmath10 , are 0.8 and 1.4 , respectively.@xcite    alternatively , we can make a _ theory - independent _ estimate of @xmath55 by using ( [ cond ] ) and the experimentally determined condensation energy density and spin susceptibility .",
    "this method of determining @xmath55 is very attractive because it does include all the many - body effects ( without assuming a fermi liquid picture ) and does _ not _ assume the validity of any particular theory of superconductivity for the material in question .",
