    "the study of vibrational spectra has long provided important insights into the understanding of amorphous states of matter  @xcite , such as molecular glasses .",
    "however many key questions still remain unanswered . the vibrational disorder that is present in systems such as glasses is mainly topological in origin and over the years , a lot of effort has been put in to study glasses and glass transitions in terms of underlying potential energy surface ( pes )  @xcite .",
    "one of the main focus has been the study of inherent structures , i.e local minima of pes and properties like aging have also been studied as a function of inherent structures  @xcite . regarding vibrational spectra of systems having a topological disorder  @xcite , a popular approach rely on the study of statistical properties of random matrices , as within the harmonic approximation , the dynamical or the hessian matrix contains all the dynamical features  @xcite .",
    "recently , studies of vibrational spectra of amorphous systems have revealed some interesting universal aspects . in particular , studies of three - dimensional amorphous clusters  @xcite have demonstrated the universality in the functional form of the density of states ( dos ) and further , the statistical fluctuations have been shown to obey the characteristics of the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) of random matrices to a very high degree of accuracy .",
    "recent studies on periodic , three - dimensional , molecular network - forming liquids have also shown that the statistical fluctuations obey the charactersistics of the goe  @xcite at various temperatures and for various densities . even in amorphous alloys",
    "@xcite , the statistical fluctutations have been reported to obey the characteristics of random matrix theory .",
    "another universal feature that has been reported in earlier and recent studies on periodic three - dimensional amorphous systems using various model potentials is the density of states function approaching a limit that is independent of the explicit functional form of the potential in the amorphous regime .",
    "the reasons for this universality have been suggested in  @xcite .",
    "the concepts of localization and delocalization of vibrational states has also been a focus in these studies , with delocalized states being associated with goe statistics  @xcite and localized states resulting in poissonian statistics  @xcite .",
    "a popular measure of localization is the participation ratio  @xcite .",
    "values for participation ratios for three - dimensional amorphous clusters  @xcite , network - forming liquids  @xcite and atomic liquids  @xcite indicate that the majority of the states are delocalized , supporting the apparent universality of goe behavior in the statistical fluctuations .",
    "the recent years have also seen an increase in the studies of vibrational properties of nanocrystalline materials both theoretically  @xcite and experimentally  @xcite .",
    "the new experimental techniques and methods have made it possible to explore the systems that are very small in size  @xcite and increased computational power has even made it possible to explore such systems in reduced dimensions  @xcite .",
    "in the present work we numerically investigate the vibrational spectra of two - dimensional clusters .",
    "it is well known ( e.g. in critical phenomena ) that dimension has a strong effect on universal behaviors and a detailed study in a lower dimension would be a severe test of the robustness of the observed universalities in three - dimensional systems .",
    "e.g. as suggested in  @xcite , in quantum mechanical systems such as two - dimensional kicked rotors for lower dimensions @xmath0 , all the electronic states are exponentially localized , while for higher dimensions @xmath1 there are extended as well as localized states . also , disordered molecular systems display novel behavior in two - dimensions , e.g the occurance of the hexatic liquid phase that has a long range bond order without translational order  @xcite . hence",
    ", checking the universality of the vibrational spectra for two - dimensional clusters is a severe test .",
    "our interest is to see the effect of dimensionality on the states being localized or delocalized with the main focus being on statistical fluctuations for the present two - dimensional case .    .",
    "stable two - dimensional cluster obtained using method of homtopy with @xmath2.,width=288 ]",
    "the model used for the interactions between the particles is the morse potential  @xcite . over the years",
    "various studies have demonstrated the usefulness of this potential in simulations with references  @xcite serving as a few examples .",
    "the form of the potential energy @xmath3 of the system is , @xmath4 - 2\\exp\\left[-\\alpha\\left(r_{ij}-1\\right ) \\right]\\}.\\ ] ] the potential is thus a function of inter - particle distance @xmath5 and the ( positive ) parameter @xmath6 ; the sum is over all pairs of particles in the system .",
    "the @xmath6 parameter can be tuned to fit a variety of systems ranging from metals such as sodium with @xmath7 ; van der waals bonded systems such as rare gases with @xmath8 ; to the very short - ranged interactions of the @xmath9 molecule with @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "the values of @xmath6 that have been used in the present study are 3.5 , 6.0 , 10.0 , 13.0 and 16.0 . using these values of @xmath6 for the interaction potential ,",
    "we first generate stable two - dimensional clusters with @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the number of particles in a cluster . for",
    "some calculations , clusters with @xmath13 and @xmath2 particles are used .     vs. normalized frequencies of normal modes plotted for various values of @xmath6 .",
    "area under each curve has been rescaled to unity .",
    "@xmath11 has been used in this calculation .",
    "participation ratios @xmath14 vs. normalized frequencies of the normal modes for various values of @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath15 vs. normalized frequencies of the normal modes for @xmath16 for @xmath13 and @xmath2 particles.,width=288 ]    in order to generate stable clusters , we begin by initializing the particle positions within the limiting distance @xmath17 on the x - y plane . fig . 1  ( a ) shows an example of a typical starting configuration for @xmath2 . in order to obtain the potential energy minimum for such a configuration , we use the homotopy method of minimization  @xcite . according to this method , in order to find a local minimum of a function @xmath3 ,",
    "we minimize in a series of steps the quantity @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is a suitably chosen simple function ( e.g. quadratic ) and @xmath20 is varied from 0 to 1 in a finite number of steps , typically 20 .",
    "the minimized configuration for one value of @xmath20 serves as the initial configuration for the subsequent step .",
    "1  ( b ) illustrates a two - dimensional stable cluster generated by this method .    at each local minimum generated by this method",
    ", a hessian matrix is constructed using the position coordinates of particles at that minimum and is diagonalized using standard methods to obtain the eigenvalues as well as the eigenvectors .",
    "the eigenvectors correspond to the normal modes and the eigenvalues  @xmath21 are related to the frequencies  @xmath22 of the obtained normal modes according to @xmath23 .",
    "the normal modes obtained in this manner are also known as quenched normal modes ( qnm ) .",
    "a quantity that is of central physical interest is the density of states ( dos ) function , the histogram of values of @xmath24 , denoted by g@xmath22 .     with @xmath11 .",
    "data in the region i has been used for unfolding and to analyze the statistical fluctuations , width=288 ]    in fig .",
    "2(a ) , we plot @xmath25 for several values of @xmath6 . to improve statistics we combine information from the available distinct quenched configurations ( atleast 75 for each case ) by averaging over all the configurations . after obtaining the raw averaged dos function",
    ", the average frequency is normalized to unity and g@xmath22 is rescaled so that the area under the curve is also unity .",
    "this process enables us to compare the dos for different values of @xmath6 .",
    "2(a ) clearly shows the existence of a two - peak behavior for all the values of @xmath6 studied which suggests that the obtained local minima have weakly - disordered domains with grain boundaries .",
    "this is further evident from fig .",
    "this two - peak nature observed in the dos function is also consistent with the recent results obtained by hudon et al .",
    "@xcite where bulk nanocrystalline materials in two - dimensions are studied using lennard - jones interaction potential and a similar form for @xmath26 is observed and it also shows that the present system behaves as a `` normal '' two - dimensional system _ as per _ the notation used by hudon et al  @xcite .",
    "the peaks shift towards right with increasing @xmath6 and the overall structure varies very slowly for higher values of @xmath6 .",
    "this is also notably different than the earlier study conducted on a periodic three - dimensional system using a similar generalized morse potential  @xcite . in the three - dimensional case , it was possible to generate states with variable amounts of disorder and the analysis of disordered states showed that the two - peak behavior of dos changed over to a one - peak as the value of @xmath6 was increased and by the time @xmath6 reached 16 , only one peak remained .",
    "further increase in @xmath6 values lead to small changes in the overall dos shape  @xcite .",
    "however in the present case , potential energy minimization results in states that are weakly - disordered rather than being totally amorphous and at present , it is not clear how one could generate stable clusters in two - dimensions that have variable amounts of disorder .",
    "however a similar feature at both two and three dimensional case occurs at higher values of @xmath6 , where dos function varies very slowly with further increases in @xmath6 .",
    "2(b ) shows the participation ratios  @xcite calculated using the eigenvectors corresponding to each eigenvalue for all values of @xmath6 .",
    "mathematically , the participation ratio is defined as , @xmath27^{-1}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is the projection of the eigenvector ( labelled by @xmath6 ) onto particle @xmath29 . for extended modes ,",
    "@xmath30 is of the order of unity and does not depend on system size , while for localized modes it will scale inversely with the system size .",
    "calculations for participation ratios have been done using @xmath13 and @xmath2 particles . for each value of @xmath6 on this plot ,",
    "information from various quenched configurations is combined to improve statistics .",
    "for all the @xmath6 values studies , maximum values for participation ratios stay below or close to 0.6 which might suggest that more states are localized in two dimensions as compared to three - dimensions",
    ". however , closer examination of participation ratios plotted on a semi - log scale in fig .",
    "2(c ) with varying @xmath12 shows that the states are definitely not localized over the wide spectrum that has been used for studying statistical fluctuations .",
    "since the two systems differ in size by a factor of 4 , localized modes in the larger system should have participation ratios approximately 1/4 of those in the smaller system .",
    "we find that differences on this scale only occur towards the higher values of @xmath24 .",
    "hence , even though the participation ratios in the middle part of the frequency spectrum that is used in the analysis of statistical fluctuations are close to 0.5 or 0.6 , these still have behavior consistent with extended modes of the system .",
    "we now investigate the statistical fluctuation properties of the dos . in the present case ,",
    "the fluctuation properties are computed for @xmath31 s , the eigenvalues . for a particular inherent structure ,",
    "we denote the elements of the obtained spectra by @xmath32 with @xmath33 .",
    "since the present system is two - dimensional , the first three elements in the spectra will be zero and the remaining @xmath34 positive frequencies are characterized by defining a mean local density as well as the fluctuations around it .",
    "the first step in computing the fluctuation properties is to unfold the data  @xcite .",
    "this process enables us to transform the eigenvalues in such a way that the average spacing between two successive eigenvalues is unity .     for normalized nearest neighbor spacing  @xmath35 for various values of @xmath6 .",
    "also shown is the prediction for the goe .",
    "@xmath11 has been used in this calculation .",
    "variance of the number of levels in intervals of length @xmath36 shown as a function of @xmath36 for various values of @xmath6 . also shown is the prediction for the goe .",

    "also shown is the theoretical prediction for the goe .",
    "@xmath11 has been used in this calculation .",
    "excess parameter of the distribution of @xmath37 , the number of levels in intervals of length @xmath36 shown as a function of @xmath36 for various values of @xmath6 . also shown is the theoretical prediction for the goe .",
    "@xmath11 has been used in this calculation.,width=288 ]    for unfolding the data , we define @xmath38 to be the number of frequencies equal to or less than @xmath31 as shown in fig . 3 , and @xmath39 be a smooth function that passes through the staircase function @xmath40 in the best - fit sense . in the present case",
    "there is no single function that passes smoothly through the whole of @xmath40 in the best - fit sense .",
    "we leave out small regions ( about 10% of the levels ) from each end of the spectrum and for the remaining levels in the central region marked as i in fig .",
    "3 , we use a quadratic polynomial @xmath41 as an approximation for @xmath39 over the remaining spectral region .",
    "it must be stated that there is no particular reason to leave out lower end region of i other than obtaining better fitting to the data however , it is evident from fig .",
    "1(b ) and fig .",
    "1(c ) that towards the upper end of i , more states are localized and hence for the analysis of this paper , it is the central regime that we are interested in .",
    "the values of @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 are obtained by a standard least - square fitting procedure .",
    "we also calculate the misfit function  @xcite corresponding to each of the fits to check how well @xmath45 approximates @xmath39 .",
    "the plot of the misfit function we find is qualitatively similar to the plot in fig .",
    "1(b ) of  @xcite .    in order to reduce the mismatch to lower degree , we eliminate subregions where the mismatch function has a very irregular behavior . in the remaining regular subregions we fit quadratic",
    "function to the misfit function , and we correct @xmath45 by these quadratic functions to obtain the desired unfolding functions . for each of the fluctuation properties reported in this paper , we combine the data from all the subregions of all the spectra .",
    "note that this process of unfolding is quite different from the one used in references  @xcite in which an exponential function has been to unfold the data followed by the quadratic correction . in the present case , we could not find any suitable @xmath39 that could pass through @xmath40 .",
    "hence we have to resort to this method .",
    "however , the advantage of this method of unfolding is that it provides a suitable way of handling with more complex functions that have no well - defined analytical forms  @xcite .",
    "the first fluctuation property that we report here is @xmath46 , the distribution of the normalized nearest - neighbor spacings @xmath47 of the frequencies of the unfolded spectra . for this",
    ", we first complete the process of unfolding described above for each of the spectra using @xmath45 . at this level , we apply the quadratic correction to this @xmath45 ignoring small regions where the misfit function is very irregular . in this way",
    "we obtain the unfolded spectra for each of the spectra .",
    "selection of a random individual spectrum and analysis of each of them separately indicates that the the spectrum has fluctuation properties associated with the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) of random matrices . to improve statistics ,",
    "we combine the data for all the four regions of all the unfolded spectra .",
    "this has been plotted in fig .",
    "4(a ) for three values of @xmath6 along with the theoretical prediction  @xcite .",
    "it can be seen that the agreement with the theoretical prediction is extremely close , in spite of the values of the participation ratios being lower than those found in three dimensions .",
    "the second fluctuation property we report is the quantity @xmath48 , the variance of the number of levels @xmath37 within an interval of length @xmath36 located randomly in the unfolded spectrum .",
    "this is plotted in fig .",
    "it must be emphasized that the quadratic correction applied to the fitting function @xmath49 is very important in calculating @xmath48 .",
    "this calculation is extremely sensitive even to very small errors in the approximation to @xmath50 .",
    "the contribution of any such error to @xmath48 grows as @xmath51 , whereas the goe prediction for @xmath48 grows only as ln@xmath52  @xcite .",
    "values for @xmath53 almost overlap to the theoretical prediction whereas we do see a shift for the other two @xmath6 values .",
    "this may be due to the following possible effects : ( i ) as explained in  @xcite , the exact locations of the irregular regions vary in the contour of the misfit function and this might add to the observed shift .",
    "a detailed analysis using a @xmath54  @xcite choice of subdomains might help in determining the strength of this effect on the observed deviation .",
    "( ii ) as observed from fig .",
    "1(b ) , values of participation ratios decrease with increasing @xmath6 and this decrease might have a role to play in the observed deviation .    in figs .",
    "5(a ) and 5(b ) , we plot the skewness and excess parameters  @xcite of the fluctuations .",
    "also included in these plots are the predictions for the goe .",
    "these predictions have been calculated on the basis of a large ensemble of @xmath55 matrices belonging to the gaussian orthogonal ensemble .",
    "again we observe that the agreement with the theoretical prediction is extremely close .",
    "plots show only one value of @xmath6 just for clarity .",
    "othervalues of @xmath6 also have the same level of agreement to the theory as @xmath56 .",
    "our results for the dos of two - dimensional clusters shows the survival of a two - peak behavior when the width of the potential well describing the morse potential is reduced progressively thereby indicating a weak - disorder in contrast to the three - dimensional case .",
    "the participation ratios suggest that the vibrational spectrum has behavior consistent with the extended modes of the system .",
    "further , the vibrational spectra has fluctuation properties associated with the goe of random matrices . for each of the fluctuation properties , agreement with the goe prediction",
    "is extremely close .",
    "the observed shifts in the case of the @xmath48 calculations suggest that magnitude of the participation ratio might have a role to play in this behavior , however , since calculations of the normalized nearest neighbor spacings distribution and skewness and excess are extremely close to the theoretical prediction , it may not be incorrect to say that the system still follows goe .",
    "the work leaves us with the following challenges as a part of the future work : ( 1 ) the first challenge is to generate local minima that have a variable degree of disorder in two - dimensions , at this moment it is not clear how to generate such states in two - dimensions that would allow us to do a systematic study with respect to disorder .",
    "( 2 ) what should be the level of disorder before we see a convincing departure in the statistics from goe .",
    "the present work shows that the statistics are of goe type even in a weak - disorder .",
    "the reasons for this effect are yet to be determined .",
    "( 3 ) as mentioned by hudon et al .",
    "@xcite in their studies on bulk nanocrystalline materials that density can influence thermal properties of nanocrystalline materials . using this argument",
    ", it would of great interest to generate local minima as a function of densities and repeat the calculations for statistics .",
