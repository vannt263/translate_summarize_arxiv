    "entanglement plays a key role in quantum computation and quantum information , which is a kind of quantum correlation not available in classical world @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", there exists some other quantum correlations different from entanglement , for example , quantum discord is also a quantum correlation not present in classical system @xcite .",
    "it is supposed that quantum discord might be responsible for the advantage of a quantum algorithm , the deterministic quantum computation with one qubit @xcite , which surpasses any corresponding classical algorithms while with vanishing entanglement but non - zero quantum discord .",
    "it is also noticed that though different from entanglement , quantum discord is closely related with entanglement and may have interesting operational interpretations in quantum information processing @xcite , and also see the reviews  @xcite .",
    "we know that entanglement is an invaluable resource for quantum information processing , and thus it can not be shared freely among multiparities .",
    "this property is described by monogamy inequality which is a one of the most fundamental properties of entanglement  @xcite .",
    "that is , if two qubits @xmath0 and @xmath1 are maximally entangled they can not be correlated at all with third qubit @xmath2 . in general",
    ", there is tradeoff between the amount of entanglement between qubits @xmath0 and @xmath1 and the same qubit @xmath0 and qubit @xmath2 .",
    "this property is purely quantum : in classical world if @xmath0 and @xmath1 bits are perfectly correlated , then there is no constraints on correlations between bits @xmath0 and @xmath2  @xcite . for three qubits",
    "the tradeoff is described by coffman - kundu - wootters ( ckw ) monogamy inequality in terms of the concurrence  @xcite .",
    "the ckw inequality can be extended to @xmath3-qubits , it has been proven true only recently  @xcite . more discussions on monogamy of different quantum correlations measures can be found in  @xcite .    since quantum discord quantifies the quantum correlation in a bipartite state  @xcite and might also be a resource in quantum information processing , it is interesting to study whether it also respects monogamy relation .",
    "recently , monogamy relation for quantum discord has already been studied in @xcite .",
    "it is found that monogamy of quantum discord is due to the relationships between the entanglement of formation and the one - way classical correlation , see the inequality  ( [ eq : eof_qd ] ) . in general , this inequality ( [ eq : eof_qd ] ) does not hold  @xcite .",
    "thus , the monogamy of quantum discord is not universal for any tripartite pure state .",
    "as pointed out in  @xcite , polygamy relation for quantum discord can hold for some states .    for the case of entanglement",
    ", it is showed that distributed entanglement is by nature polygamy by establishing the concept of the one - way unlocalizable entanglement @xcite , which is defined by entanglement of assistance  @xcite .",
    "since quantum discord is an important supplementary to entanglement , it motivates us to propose a similar concept for quantum discord .",
    "thus we can systematically investigate the polygamy of distributed quantum correlations in terms of quantum discord in tripartite quantum system .",
    "based on the duality between the one - way unlocalizable entanglement and the one - way classical correlation  @xcite , in this paper , we present the concept of the one - way unlocalizable quantum discord and provide an operational interpretation .",
    "we give the lower and upper bound for the one - way unlocalizable quantum discord .",
    "we also derive several tradeoff relations between the one - way unlocalizable quantum discord and other correlations , and provide a polygamy relation of distributed quantum correlations in terms of the one - way unlocalizable quantum discord . in case",
    "the von neumann measurement is on a part of the system , we give two expressions of the one - way unlocalizable quantum discord in terms of partial distillable entanglement  @xcite and quantum disturbance  @xcite . finally , we also provide a lower bound for bipartite shareability of quantum correlations ( beyond entanglement ) in a tripartite system .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.[sec:1way uqd ] , we provide the definition of the one - way unlocalizable quantum discord and investigate its basic properties , and give a polygamy relation of distributed quantum correlations . in sec.[sec : linking qc and entanglement ] , we study the relations between the one - way unlocalizable quantum discord and entanglement . in sec.[sec : monogamy of qd ] , we discuss monogamy relation for quantum discord and we summarize our results in sec .

    "we now consider a tripartite pure state @xmath4 shared between three parties refereed to as alice , bob and charlie .",
    "the entanglement supplier , bob preforms a measurement on him share of the tripartite state which yields a know bipartite entangled state for alice and charlie . tracing over bob",
    "s system yields the bipartite mixed state @xmath5 shared by alice and charlie  @xcite .",
    "bob s aim is to maximize entanglement for alice and charlie , and the maximum average entanglement he can create is the entanglement of assistance , which was originally defined in terms of entropy of entanglement . as a dual quantity to entanglement of formation  @xcite , entanglement of assistance  @xcite",
    "is defined by the maximum average entanglement of @xmath6 @xmath7 where the maximum is taken as over all possible pure state decompositions of @xmath6 , satisfying @xmath8 and @xmath9 . here , @xmath10 is von neumann entropy  @xcite .",
    "since @xmath11 measures the maximum average entanglement that can be localized on the subsystem @xmath12 with the assistance of @xmath1 , and @xmath13 , then the difference between two is the so - called the one - way unlocalizable entanglement of a bipartite state @xmath14 , namely , @xmath15 where @xmath16  @xcite .    for tripartite pure state @xmath4 , all possible pure state decomposition of @xmath6 can be realized by rank-1 measurements of subsystem @xmath1 , conversely , any rank-1 measurement can be induced from a pure state decomposition of @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the right - hand side of eq.([eq : eoa ] ) is the maximum average entropy overall possible rank-1 measurements @xmath17 applied on the subsystem @xmath1 .",

    "the quantum mutual information is a measure of the total amount of correlations in the bipartite quantum state , and it was divided into quantum correlation and classical correlation .",
    "then , the one - way unlocalizable quantum discord of the state @xmath14 under the measurement elements @xmath17 is defined as the difference between the mutual information and the one - way unlocalizable entanglement , namely , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is mutual information  @xcite .",
    "this quantity is inspired by the definition of quantum discord  @xcite , in some sense dual to quantum discord , and it is defined as @xmath25      to understand the one - way unlocalizable quantum discord , we firstly give an operational interpretation .",
    "all bipartite and single - party states are obtained by taking the appropriate partial traces of tripartite pure state .",
