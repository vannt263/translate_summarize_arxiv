    "as we have shown , the model can consistently explain the excess while evading all the constraints from other high - mass resonance searches made in lhc run - i .",
    "it should be noted that the @xmath0 property of the resonance can be tested by measuring the angular distribution of the four leptons in the final sates of the @xmath73 modes ( see , _ e.g. _ , ref .",

    "the neutral scalar boson is accompanied by many charged bound states whose masses are also in the tev regime .",

    "thus , the dynamical scale should be in close proximity to the composite mass , unlike again the models in which the @xmath1-gev resonance is identified as a pseudo - goldstone boson .",
    "therefore , we expect that the quark - like picture of the hidden sector emerges at a rather low energy in future collider experiments . for example , production of multiple partons in the hidden sector becomes possible and ends up with events of multiple jets , multiple leptons and multiple photons .    before closing this paper ,",
    "let us address an important question :  who ordered the @xmath1-gev resonance ? \"",
    "one ambitious answer is the dark matter candidate .",
    "in fact , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , this model has a good dark matter candidate : the lightest baryonic scalar @xmath121 this state is neutral under the sm gauge groups due to the choice of @xmath41 .",
    "stable , a ( discrete ) symmetry is required .",
    "we presume that such a symmetry is not broken spontaneously by the strong dynamics as long as @xmath122 . ]",
    "it should be emphasized that the neutralness of the lightest baryonic state under the sm gauge group is one of the prominent features of this model . if , instead , the hidden sector consists of bi - fundamental fermions , the neutral baryonic state is expected to be heavier than the lightest but sm - charged baryonic state since the neutral baryonic state has a larger orbital angular momentum inside .    in the early universe , the baryonic scalars annihilate into a pair of lighter scalar nnon - baryonic composite states",
    ". the thermal relic abundance would be much lower than the observed dark matter density if the annihilation cross section ( into @xmath11 , glueballs , etc . ) saturates the unitarity limit  @xcite .",
    "the abundance of @xmath17 is roughly given by , @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the mass of @xmath17 and @xmath125 denotes the form factor of the interactions of @xmath17 with the lighter states . saturates the unitarity limit when @xmath126 . ] by remembering @xmath127 ( in particular when @xmath128 ) , it is expected that the form factor is slightly smaller than @xmath116 .",
    "therefore , the thermal relic abundance of @xmath17 can be consistent with the observed dark matter density , although a quantitative estimation is difficult due to our inability to estimate the form factor precisely .",
    "finally , let us comment on the direct detection of the dark matter candidate .",
    "the coupling between @xmath38 s and the higgs doublet in eq .",
    "( [ eq : higgs ] ) also leads to a direct coupling between the scalar dark matter and the higgs doublet , @xmath129 where @xmath130 is of @xmath131.@xcite . ]",

    "<S> we revisit the model of a @xmath0-even singlet scalar resonance proposed in http://arxiv.org/abs/arxiv:1507.02483[arxiv:1507.02483 ] , where the resonance appears as the lightest composite state made of scalar quarks participating in hidden strong dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the model can consistently explain the excess of diphoton events with an invariant mass around @xmath1  gev reported by both the atlas and cms experiments . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss the nature of the charged composite states in the tev range which accompany to the neutral scalar . due to inseparability of the dynamical scale and the mass of the resonance , the model also predicts signatures associated with the hidden dynamics such as leptons , jets along with multiple photons at future collider experiments . </S>",
    "<S> we also associate the tev - scale dynamics behind the resonance with an explanation of dark matter .    </S>",
