    "compton upscattering of soft ( optical , uv or soft x - ray ) radiation by hot ( @xmath1  kev ) plasma is believed to play an important role in the formation of high - energy ( hard x - ray and @xmath0-ray ) spectra of many astrophysical objects .",
    "some examples are galactic x - ray binaries ( for recent reviews see @xcite ) , supernova remnants ( e.g. , @xcite ) , seyfert galaxies ( for recent reviews see @xcite ) , blazars ( @xcite ) , the intergalactic medium ( @xcite ) , and possibly also @xmath0-ray bursts ( @xcite ) .",
    "comptonization in purely thermal plasmas is fairly well understood , and analytical solutions for the emerging hard x - ray and @xmath0-ray spectra for a wide range of thomson depths and plasma temperatures have been developed ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , the currently known solutions can not be applied to hybrid thermal / nonthermal or even purely nonthermal plasmas , which are believed to be the primary source of hard x - ray radiation in many astrophysical objects .",
    "for example , li , kusunose , & liang ( 1996 ) have shown that the high - energy spectrum of cyg  x-1 can be plausibly reproduced by comptonization in a quasi - thermal plasma with a small fraction of electrons in a nonthermal tail .",
    "thermal / nonthermal hybrid models have also been discussed in the context of the high - energy spectra of seyfert galaxies , e.g. ngc  4151 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the development of such nonthermal tails has been confirmed by bttcher & liang ( 2001 ) by detailed monte - carlo / fokker - planck simulations of radiation transport and electron dynamics in magnetized hot plasmas , e.g. in accretion flows onto compact objects .",
    "we need to point out that the combination of soft- to medium - energy x - ray spectra ( typically integrated over a few ksec ) with hard x - ray / soft @xmath0-ray osse spectra ( typically integrated over hundreds of ksec or even several days ) could introduce artificial spectral signatures due to the superposition of thermal comptonization spectra from different emission regions , possibly at different times .",
    "however , the detailed fokker - planck simulations of the dynamics of electron acceleration and cooling in coronal plasmas in the vicinity of accreting compact objects ( e.g. , @xcite ) clearly demonstrate that nonthermal tails in the electron distributions are very likely to be produced in such environments .",
    "it is thus desirable to have simple , analytical expressions for the comptonization spectra arising in this case .    for the general case of arbitrary thomson depth , average electron energy ( i.e. temperature ) , nonthermal fraction of electrons in the hybrid plasma , and nonthermal electron spectral parameters , the most reliable and often fastest method for computing comptonization spectra is the monte - carlo method ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , monte - carlo simulations of comptonization problems become extremely time consuming in the case of very high thomson depth , @xmath3 , since the number of scatterings that need to be simulated , increases @xmath5 . to date , there are no simple , analytic approximations to the problem of optically thick comptonization in hot , thermal / nonthermal hybrid plasmas .",
    "this has made @xmath4 minimization fitting of such models to real data infeasible until now .",
    "using our linear monte - carlo comptonization codes , we have built up a data base of over 300 comptonization spectra from hot , thomson thick , thermal / nonthermal hybrid plasmas with different thomson depths , temperatures , nonthermal electron fractions , spectral indices and maximum electron energies of nonthermal electrons . in this paper , we propose a simple analytic representation , consisting of an exponentially cut - off power - law plus a smoothly connected double - power - law ( @xcite ) to fit all individual spectra in our data base .",
    "we find correlations between the physical parameters of the monte - carlo calculations and the parameters of our analytical representation , which can be used to construct comptonization spectra of high-@xmath3 plasmas with arbitrary nonthermal electron fractions , without having to perform time - consuming monte - carlo simulations .",
    "our results are specifically optimized for very high thomson depths , @xmath2 , and are valid for electron temperatures @xmath1  kev , since we assume the comptonizing plasma to be fully ionized . for lower temperatures , effects of photoelectric absorption , recombination , and other atomic processes , which have been neglected in the current work , must be included .",
    "the physical scenario underlying the comptonization problem at hand , consists of a spherical , homogeneous region of hot ( @xmath6  kev ) , thermal / nonthermal hybrid plasma with radial thomson depth @xmath3 .",
    "the thermal / nonthermal hybrid distribution function of electron energies is given by    @xmath7    here , the normalization factors @xmath8 and @xmath9 and the transition energy @xmath10 are determined by the normalization , @xmath11 , by the requirement of continuity of the distribution function at @xmath10 , and by the fraction @xmath12 of thermal particles , i. e. @xmath13 .",
    "soft photons with characteristic energy @xmath14  kev are injected uniformly throughout the comptonizing region ( we assume that they have a thermal blackbody spectrum with @xmath15  kev ; the specific shape of the soft photon distribution is irrelevant for multiple - compton - scattering problems ) .",
    "the comptonizing plasma is assumed to be fully ionized .",
    "the comptonization spectra are calculated with our monte - carlo codes , which use the full klein - nishina cross section for compton scattering .",
    "@xmath16 absorption , pair production , and other induced processes ( e.g. , free - free absorption and induced compton scattering events ) have been neglected in our monte - carlo simulations .",
    "we have created a data base of over 300 simulations , spanning values of @xmath17 , @xmath18  kev , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 .",
    "we here propose a fit function to optically thick comptonization spectra from thermal / nonthermal hybrid plasmas as the sum of an exponentially cut - off power - law plus a band grb function ( defined here , for convenience , in energy flux units to match the units of the output spectra of our monte - carlo simulations ) :    @xmath22    with @xmath23 e_0 \\bigr)^{\\delta - \\epsilon } \\ , e^{\\epsilon - \\delta}$ ] and @xmath24 in kev .",
    "@xmath25 is the energy flux in units of ergs  @xmath26  s@xmath27  kev@xmath27 .",
    "apart from the overall normalization , there are 5 parameters in this fit function : the spectral indices @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 , the turnover energy @xmath31 ( corresponding to a @xmath32 peak energy of @xmath33 \\ , e_0 $ ] ) , and the relative normalization of the two components , @xmath34 .",
    "we have developed a code using a combination of a coarse grid in the 6-dimensional parameter space with a @xmath4 forward folding method to fit this function to our simulated compton spectra .",
    "[ fit_example1 ] shows two typical examples of the resulting fits .",
    "we have fitted the function ( [ f_definition ] ) to the energy range @xmath35  mev of all simulated comptonization spectra in our data base . in order to be able to use our fit function for physically meaningful fitting , one has to establish a unique correlation between the physical parameters of the monte - carlo simulation and the best - fit parameters of our fit function .",
    "first of all , we note that in the low - energy range , dominated by the power - law part of the spectrum , @xmath36 , the influence of the nonthermal population is negligible , and we can use the standard result for thermal plasmas in spherical geometry in the case of homogeneous photon injection throughout the comptonizing region :    @xmath37    ( @xcite ) where @xmath38 . this relation is valid in the limit of high thomson depth , @xmath2 , and moderate electron temperature , @xmath39  kev ( @xcite ) . a fully analytical solution for the power - law index @xmath28 for all values of @xmath3 and",
    "@xmath40 has been derived by titarchuk & ljubarskij ( 1995 ) . in the parameter range",
    "in which our analytical representation is applicable , the simple expression ( [ gamma ] ) is sufficiently accurate .    a second , obvious correlation exists between the @xmath32 peak of an optically thick comptonization spectrum and the average particle energy . in the thermal case , the wien spectrum peaks at @xmath41",
    "however , near the @xmath32 peak of the spectrum , the influence of the nonthermal particle population can become important . generalizing the @xmath42 vs. @xmath43 correlation",
    ", one would expect that @xmath44 , where the brackets denote the ensemble average . we find that this generally provides a reasonable fit to the simulated @xmath42 values .",
    "however , in some cases ( especially for hard power - law tails , @xmath45 ) , the onset of the nonthermal population ( at @xmath10 ) is at too high an energy and the normalization of the nonthermal population is too small for nonthermal electrons to make a strong contribution to photons scattered into the wien peak .",
    "we find significant deviations from the above @xmath42 vs.  correlation for values of @xmath46 .",
    "an approximate correction for this effect can be found in the following empirical correlation which provides a reasonable description of the simulated @xmath42 values :    @xmath47    where @xmath48 .",
    "the terms @xmath49 and @xmath50 denote the average kinetic energies ( normalized to @xmath51 ) of electrons in the thermal and nonthermal portion of the electron distribution , respectively . the @xmath42 vs. @xmath52 correlation for those cases with @xmath53",
    "is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ epk_gminus1 ] .",
    "we note that in most physically relevant cases , we expect the power - law index of nonthermal electrons to be @xmath54 since we do not expect a positive @xmath32 spectral slope at high energies due to the nonthermal portion of the hybrid electron spectra . in the case",
    "@xmath54 , the upper branch of eq . ( [ epk ] ) always yields satisfactory results .",

    "[ gminus1_graph ] .",
    "the connections of the remaining fit parameters , @xmath30 , @xmath29 , and @xmath34 with the physical parameters of the comptonizing plasma , are less obvious , and the correlations which we have found on the basis of the fit results to our data base , are purely empirical . in an optically thin ( @xmath62 ) , purely nonthermal plasma , the high - energy spectral index @xmath30 would be related to the non - thermal particle index @xmath61 through @xmath63 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , the presence of the thermal population as well as the effect of multiple compton scatterings lead to a systematic distortion of this spectral shape .",
