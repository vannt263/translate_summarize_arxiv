    "recent progress in experiments with optical cavities has mainly been motivated by potential applications in quantum information processing .",
    "these applications often require the simultaneous trapping of at least two atomic qubits inside a single resonator field mode .",
    "it has been shown that the common coupling to a quantised mode can be used for the implementation of quantum gate operations @xcite and the controlled generation of entanglement @xcite .",
    "however , the practical realisation of these schemes with current technologies is experimentally challenging .",
    "the main reason is that strong atom - cavity interactions require relatively small mode volumes and high quality mirrors ; aims that are difficult to reconcile with the placement of several atoms or ions into the same cavity .    to solve this problem ,",
    "it has been proposed to couple distant cavities via linear optics networks @xcite . under realistic conditions , this strategy allows at least for the probabilistic build up of highly entangled states .",
    "alternatively , one could shuttle atoms successively in and out of the resonator @xcite .",
    "in this paper we propose to use instead fiber - coupled cavities which employ reservoir engineering and similar ideas as in ref .",
    "@xcite to turn two distant cavities effectively into one .",
    "our aim is that atomic qubits placed into different cavities behave as if they were placed into the same cavity .",
    "when this becomes possible , quantum computing schemes designed for several qubits placed into the same resonator can be applied to a much wider range of experimental scenarios .",
    "they can be implemented with atomic qubits , quantum dots @xcite , nv color centers @xcite , and superconducting flux qubits @xcite .",
    "another possible application of fiber - coupled cavities is the transfer of information from one cavity to another @xcite .    the experimental setup considered in this paper ( c.f .",
    "[ scheme ] ) consists of two cavities with the same frequency @xmath0 . given two cavities with fixed polarization",
    ", there are two quantised cavity field modes . for example",
    ", one could describe the setup using the individual cavity modes with annihilation operators @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "but there is also the possibility of describing the cavities by two common ( i.e.  non - local ) field modes .",
    "their cavity photon annihilation operators are of the general form @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are complex coefficients and @xmath6 one can easily check that , if @xmath1 and @xmath2 obey the usual boson commutator relations , then so do @xmath7 and @xmath8 , @xmath9 = [ \\ , c_b , c_b^\\dagger \\ , ] & = & 1 ~~ { \\rm and } ~~ [ \\ , c_a , c_b^\\dagger \\ , ] = 0 \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] an atomic qubit placed into one of the two cavities interacts in general with the @xmath7 and with the @xmath8 mode , since both are non - local .    the purpose of the cavity fiber coupling with atomic coating shown in fig .",
    "[ scheme ] is to asign different spontaneous decay rates to the @xmath7 and to the @xmath8 mode .",
    "if one of the two common cavity modes has a much larger spontaneous decay rate than the other one , it effectively decouples from the system dynamics @xcite .",
    "a single non - local resonator mode is created .",
    "this means , atomic qubits placed into different cavities would indeed behave as if they were placed into the same cavity .    to achieve this task",
    ", we impose the following conditions on the experimental setup considered in this paper :    1 .",
    "different from refs .",
    "@xcite , we do _ not _ treat the fiber as a resonant cavity with a single well - defined frequency . instead , we assume boundary conditions which allow for a continuous range of frequencies which should include the cavity frequency @xmath0 .",
    "this broadening of the fiber spectrum is in general due to the finite width of the fiber , imperfection of the mirrors , and the presence of atoms in its evanescent field @xcite .",
    "2 .   at the same time , the frequency range supported by the fiber should not be too broad .",
    "the fiber needs to be short and thin enough to have a well defined optical path length for each frequency supported by the fiber . at the optical frequency @xmath0",
    ", there should be only _ one _ standing wave which fulfils the boundary condition of vanishing electric field amplitudes at the surface of the adjacent cavity mirrors .",
    "standing waves which are half a wave length @xmath10 shorter or longer should not fit into the fiber .",
    "3 .   the single - mode fiber connecting the two cavities in fig .  [ scheme ]",
    "should be coated with two - level atoms .",
    "the purpose of the atoms is similar to their purpose in ref .",
    "@xcite by franson _",
    "_ , namely to measure the evanescent electric field of the fiber and to provide an additional reservoir for the cavity photons . in the following ,",
    "we assume that the atoms have a transition frequency @xmath11 and a non - zero decay rate @xmath12 such that they absorb light traveling through the fiber and dispose of it via spontaneous emission . in the following",
    "we denote the spontaneous decay rate associated with the leakage of photons out of the fiber by @xmath13 .",
    "4 .   the atoms should measure electric field amplitudes on a time scale which is long compared to the time it takes a photon to travel from one cavity to the other . in this way ,",
    "the atoms measure only relatively long living photons inside the fiber , i.e.  the field amplitudes of the electromagnetic standing waves with vanishing amplitudes at the fiber ends .",
    "they should not be able to gain information about the source of a photon .",
    "we are especially interested in the parameter regime , where @xmath13 is much larger than the spontaneous decay rates @xmath14 and @xmath15 which describe the absorption of photons in the cavity mirrors and the leakage of photons into adjacent reservoirs other than the fiber .",
    "moreover , @xmath13 should be much larger than any other coupling constants , like the rabi frequencies @xmath16 and @xmath17 of externally applied laser fields , i.e. @xmath18 in other words , cavity photons which leak out through the fiber decay on a much shorter time scale than the cavity photons which do not see this reservoir .",
    "suppose , there is initially one photon in cavity 1 and none in cavity 2 .",
    "in this case , some light will travel from cavity 1 to cavity 2 . once there is excitation in both cavities , the photons which do not couple to the one mode supported by the fiber at frequency @xmath0",
    "can no longer enter the fiber . other cavity photons leak more easily into the fiber , since their efforts are met by waves with the same amplitude coming from the other side .",
    "the above conditions assure that the photons are measured on a relatively slow time scale and that the atoms in the evanescent field of the fiber can not distinguish photons traveling left or right .",
    "they can only absorb light which can exist for a relatively long time inside the fiber .",
    "this means , they only absorb photons from one common cavity mode but not from the other .",
    "there is hence a finite probability that the initial photon leaks relatively quickly into the environment .",
    "in addition , there is the possibility that the initial photon remains inside the setup for a relatively long time and becomes a shared photon between both cavities with no amplitude in the fiber . in the following we associate the cavity mode which does _ not _ see the fiber with the @xmath7 mode .",
    "the spontaneous decay rate @xmath19 of photons in the @xmath7 mode is hence of a similar size as @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the @xmath8 mode however sees the fiber reservoir in the middle in addition and has a decay rate comparable to @xmath13 .",
    "( [ condi ] ) hence implies @xmath20 which is exactly what we want to achieve .",
    "although this paper refers in the following only to single - mode fibers , any coupling of the cavities which meets the above requirements would work equally well .",
    "one possible alternative is shown in fig .",
    "[ scheme2 ] .",
    "if the cavities are mounted on an atom chip , a similar connection between them could be created with the help of a waveguide ( or nanowire ) etched onto the chip .",
    "such a connection too supports only a single electromagnetic field mode . to detect its field amplitude ,",
    "a second waveguide connected to a detector should be placed into its evanescent field , thereby constantly removing any field amplitude from the waveguide between the cavities .",
    "fiber coupled optical cavities with applications in quantum information processing have already been widely discussed in the literature ( see e.g.  refs .",
    "the main difference of the cavity coupling scheme presented here is that it does not rely on coherent time evolution .",
    "instead it actively uses dissipation in order to achieve its task .",
    "we therefore expect that the proposed scheme is more robust against errors .",
    "for example , the fiber considered here which is coated with two - level atoms acts as a reservoir for the cavity photons and supports a continuous range of frequencies .",
    "it can hence be longer than when it needs to contain only a single frequency as in refs .",
    "in addition , the setup considered here is robust against fiber losses @xcite .    an alternative scheme for the generation of single - mode behavior in distant optical cavities",
    "has recently been proposed by us in ref .",
    "different from the setup in fig .",
    "[ scheme ] , we considered two optical cavities with each of them individually coupled to an optical single - mode fiber .",
    "these fibers guide photons from each cavity onto a single photon detector which can not resolve the origin of the incoming photons . despite its similarity with the two - atom double slit experiment by eichmann _",
    "@xcite , a gaussian beam analysis of the scheme proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite shows that achieving real indistinguishability would require optical fibers with a diameter much smaller than the optical wavelength @xcite .",
    "these are relatively hard to realise experimentally although this is feasible with current technology @xcite .",
    "the setup in fig .",
    "[ scheme ] avoids the use of subwavelength fibers by replacing them with a single _ naturally - aligned _ fiber .",
    "there are five sections in this paper .",
    "section [ single_cav ] gives an overview over the open system description of a single cavity , thereby providing a blueprint for the expected behavior of the setup in fig .",
    "[ scheme ] .",
    "section [ two_cavs ] includes a detailed derivation of the master equation for two fiber - coupled cavities .",
    "section [ opsmode ] describes two different scenarios for which the @xmath8 mode decouples effectively from the system dynamics with one of them being especially robust against parameter fluctuations .",
    "finally , we summarise our findings in section [ conc ] .",
    "in this section we describe how to predict the possible quantum trajectories of an optical cavity which is driven by a resonant laser field and continuously leaks photons through its cavity mirrors , as shown in fig .",
    "[ cavitypic ] .",
    "we derive the master equation for this setup by adopting the quantum jump approach introduced in refs .",
    "@xcite and calculate its stationary state photon emission rate .",
    "later we refer to the equations in this section when deriving the master equation for two fiber - coupled optical cavities and when discussing conditions for their single - mode behaviour .      the setup in fig .  [ cavitypic ]",
    "consists of an optical cavity which interacts with the surrounding free radiation field and is driven by a resonant laser field .",
    "its hamiltonian is hence of the form @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the cavity hamiltonian , @xmath23 is the reservoir hamiltonian , and @xmath24 takes the dipole coupling of the cavity to the driving laser field and the environment into account . if we denote the frequency of the cavity mode and the modes of the free radiation field with wave number @xmath25 by @xmath0 and @xmath26 and the corresponding photon annihilation operators by @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively , then @xmath29 here we assume that the polarisation of the applied laser field , the cavity field , and the modes of the free radiation field is the same . as long as no mixing of different polarisation modes occurs , these are the only modes which have to be taken into account",
    ". moreover , we have @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the effective dipole moment of the cavity mode and where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the electric fields of the driving laser and of the free radiation field , respectively .    treating the laser field with frequency @xmath34 as a classical field whilst considering the modes of the reservoir quantised",
    ", this hamiltonian can be written as @xmath35 where the rotating wave approximation has already been applied . here",
    "@xmath36 is the ( complex ) laser rabi frequency and the @xmath37 are the ( complex ) coupling constants of the interaction between the cavity and the free radiation field due to overlapping electric field modes in the vicinity of the resonator mirrors .    for simplicity , we now move into the interaction picture with respect to the interaction - free hamiltonian @xmath38 in this case , the hamiltonian of system and environment simplifies to @xmath39 the laser field simply creates and annihilates photons inside the cavity mode , while the cavity - reservoir coupling results in an exchange of photon energy between system and environment .      as in refs .",
    "@xcite we assume in the following that the environment constantly performs measurements on the free radiation field whether a photon has been emitted or not . in quantum optical systems , there are in general no photons in the free radiation field , since these travel away ( or are absorbed by the environment ) such that they can not return into the system . in the following ,",
    "we assume therefore that the cavity is initially in a state @xmath40 , while the free radiation field is in its vacuum state @xmath41 . using the projection postulate for ideal measurements , one can then show that the state of the system equals @xmath42 at @xmath43 under the condition of no photon emission .",
    "a comparison of both sides of this equation shows that @xmath44 the probability for no photon emission in @xmath43 can now be written as @xmath45 .    using eq .",

    "the second integral can be replaced by a @xmath50-function . neglecting a term corresponding to a level shift which can be absorbed into @xmath22 of the total system hamiltonian , we obtain @xmath51 the conditional hamiltonian corresponding to the time evolution in eq .",

    "suppose we denote the cavity - environment coupling constant @xmath37 for the mode which is resonant with the cavity field by @xmath54 .",

    "the second term in eq .",
    "( [ h_cond ] ) takes into account that not seeing a photon gradually reveals information about the system , thereby increasing the relative population in states with lower photon numbers .",

    "@xmath64 we find that their time evolution is given by @xmath65 setting the right hand sides of these equations equal to zero , we find that the stationary state of the laser - driven cavity corresponds to @xmath66 . since the steady state photon emission rate is the product of @xmath63 with the decay rate @xmath53 , this yields @xmath67 measurements of the parameter dependence of this intensity can be used to determine @xmath68 and @xmath53 experimentally .",

    "the reason is that the effective rabi frequency @xmath135 in eq .",
    "( [ h_eff2 ] ) is now always larger than zero such that @xmath142 no longer tends to zero when @xmath167 .",
    "different from this , we expect the stationary state value of @xmath158 to increase when @xmath161 .",

    "the introduction of @xmath121 has no effect on the effectiveness of the decoupling of the @xmath8 mode when @xmath159 and both modes are equally driven by laser fields .",
    "in conclusion , we have presented a scheme that couples two cavities with a single - mode fiber coated with two - level atoms ( c.f .",
    "[ scheme ] ) or a waveguide ( c.f .",
    "[ scheme2 ] ) . since there are two cavities , the description of the system requires two orthogonal cavity field modes .",

    "( [ com_modes ] ) . here",
    "we consider the case where the connection between the cavities constitutes a reservoir for only one common cavity field mode but not for both .",
    "if this mode is the @xmath8 mode , it can have a much larger spontaneous decay rate than the @xmath7 mode which does not see this reservoir .",

    "( [ condi ] ) , where the @xmath8 mode can be adiabatically eliminated from the system dynamics , thereby leaving behind only the @xmath7 mode .",
    "the purpose of the atoms which coat the fiber is similar to their purpose in ref .",
    "@xcite , namely to measure its evanescent electric field destructively , although here there is no need to distinguish between one and two photon states .",
    "these measurements should occur on a time scale which is long compared to the time it takes a photon to travel from one resonator to the other .",
    "one can easily check that this condition combined with eq .",
    "( [ condi ] ) poses the following upper bound on the possible length @xmath59 of the fiber : @xmath168 here @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath13 are the spontaneous cavity decay rates through the outcoupling mirrors of cavity 1 and cavity 2 and through the fiber reservoir , respectively , while @xmath27 denotes the speed of light .",
    "this means , the possible length @xmath59 of the fiber depends on how good the cavities are . for good cavities ,",
    "@xmath59 could be of the order of several meters .",
    "however , the upper bound for @xmath59 depends also on the fiber diameter and the quality of the mirrors .",
    "the reason is that the fiber should not support a too wide range of optical frequencies , i.e.  the fiber should support only one standing wave with frequency @xmath0 and not two degenerate ones .",
    "there are different ways of seeing how the coated fiber removes one common cavity field mode from the system dynamics .",
    "one way is to compare the setup in fig .",
    "[ scheme ] with the two - atom double - slit experiment by eichmann _",
    "@xcite which has been analysed in detail for example in refs .  @xcite . in this experiment ,",
    "two atoms are simultaneously ( i.e.  in phase ) driven by a single laser field and emit photons into different spatial directions .",
    "the emitted photons are collected on a photographic plate which shows intensity maxima as well as completely dark spots .",
    "a dark spot corresponds to a direction of light emission where the atomic excitation does not couple to the free radiation field between the atoms and the screen due to destructive interference .",
    "the setup in fig .",
    "[ scheme ] creates an analogous situation : the photons inside the two resonators are the sources for the emitted light , thereby replacing the atomic excitation .",
    "moreover , the light inside the fiber is equivalent to a single - mode ( i.e.  one wave vector @xmath169 ) of the free radiation field in the double slit experiment .",
    "there is hence one common resonator mode  the @xmath8 mode  which does not couple to the fiber .",
    "this paper describes the setups in figs .",
    "[ scheme ] and [ scheme2 ] in a more formal way .",
    "starting from the hamiltonian as in ref .",
    "@xcite for the cavity - fiber coupling but considering the radiation field inside the fiber as a reservoir we derive the master equation for the time evolution of the photons in the optical cavities . after the adiabatic elimination of one common cavity mode , namely the @xmath8 mode , due to overdamping of its population , we arrive at a master equation which is equivalent to the master equation of a single laser - driven optical cavity .",
    "a concrete measure for the quality of the decoupling of the @xmath8 mode is the stationary state value of @xmath158 , where @xmath142 and @xmath143 are the mean numbers of photons in the @xmath7 and the @xmath8 mode , respectively , when both cavities are driven by a resonant external laser field .",
    "our calculations show that this ratio can be reduced significantly by a careful alignment of the driving lasers .",
    "however , even when both cavity modes couple equally to two external laser fields , @xmath158 can be as small as @xmath170 even when @xmath13 is only one order of magnitude larger than @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and the rabi frequencies of the driving lasers .",
    "this parameter regime consequently does not require any alignment and is very robust against parameter fluctuations .",
    "possible applications of this setup become apparent when one places for example atomic qubits , single quantum dots , or nv color centers into each cavity .",
    "these would feel only a common cavity field mode and interact as if they were sitting in the same resonator .",
    "such a scenario has applications in quantum information processing , since it allows to apply quantum computing schemes like the ones proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite which would otherwise require the shuttling of qubits in and out of an optical resonator to spatially separated qubits .    in recent years , a lot of progress has been made in the laboratory and several atom - cavity experiments which operate in the strong coupling regime have already been realised @xcite .",
    "some of these experiments have become possible due to new cavity technologies .",
    "optical cavities with a very small mode volume are now almost routinely mounted on atom chips using novel etching techniques and specially coated fiber tips @xcite .",
    "these can in principle also be coupled to miniaturised ion traps @xcite or telecommunication - wavelength solid - state memories @xcite .",
