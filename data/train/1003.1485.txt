    "the ultracold neutral plasma ( unp ) is first generated by photoionizing a ultracold gas@xcite , in which the typical electron and ion temperature are around @xmath0 and @xmath1 respectively .",
    "unp extends greatly the boundaries of classical neutral plasma physics and has been widely studied in recent years@xcite@xcite .",
    "the diagnostics methods of unp are mainly developed from some well defined technique of optic probes , such as laser induced fluorescence imaging@xcite , optical absorption imaging@xcite and even recombination fluorescence@xcite .",
    "the optic probes can excite the fluorescence or be absorbed in the case of ions and rydberg atoms .",
    "however , free electrons in unp can not respond to the laser beam except the thomason scattering which is too weak to be measured in the current techniques .",
    "furthermore , most traditional plasma diagnostics are not accessible due the size - limited unp . in this paper",
    ", we suggest a new method of using microwave radiation for the study of unp . using this method ,",
    "we can measure the amount of electrons @xmath2 and the recombination rate of plasma , which is extremely important in the research of unp .",
    "normally , when the microwave wavelength @xmath3 is much smaller than the size plasma size @xmath4 , microwave - based diagnostics such as interferometry and reflectometry have found very broad application in classical plasma diagnostics . however , the unp size limited by the beamwidth of the cooling laser is usually very small around the range of @xmath5 . in the small plasma objects situation",
    "@xmath6 , those microwave diagnostics based on propagation , absorption or reflection fail to work .",
    "shneider and miles develop the theory in the case of small plasma objects by measuring the radiation scattered by the effective oscillating plasma dipole@xcite@xcite . in their work @xcite ,",
    "the plasma is static uniform plasma column , and the microwave frequency used is smaller than plasma frequency @xmath7 .",
    "however , unp is an expanding spherical plasma cloud with radial inhomogeneity , the density profile of unp decay radically quickly in the few of @xmath5 .",
    "there is still no any discussion about microwave diagnostics on this special plasma so far . in this paper",
    "we investigate the dipole radiation of unp in an incident microwave as the physical scheme shown in fig.[fig : scattering ] .    from linearized electron motion equation , we can easily derive the high frequency conductivity @xmath8 and dielectric constant @xmath9 of plasma@xcite : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the plasma frequency,@xmath12 is the electron mass and @xmath13 is eletron density .",
    "we calculate the dipole of an uniform dielectric ball with the radius @xmath14 and dielectric constant epsilon @xmath9 in the first step .",
    "the dielectric ball responds to the incident electric field @xmath15 and the electric dipole is induced .",
    "we can get that outside the sphere the potential is equivalent to that of the applied field plus the field of a point electric dipole @xmath16 , so the equivalent dipole of the dielectric ball is @xmath17    next , we consider a thin spherical shell with spherical shell of radius @xmath14 , thickness @xmath18 and dielectric constant @xmath19 , from eq.[eq : uniformball ] , the corresponding dipole of the shell is @xmath20    so the integral on the eq.[eq : thinshell ] along the radius yields the equivalent dipole of the unp ball @xmath21    because the size of unp is much less than the wavelength of microwave , we can neglect the field variance across the unp ball .",
    "we set @xmath22 , the equivalent dipole of the unp ball will vibrate in the same frequency @xmath23 of the incident electric field .",
    "the oscillation mainly comes from the oscillation of @xmath15 , so we get total dipole radiation power in space @xmath24 ^ 2 \\label{eq : pwithomega}\\ ] ] and the effective scattering cross section @xmath25 ^ 2 \\label{eq : sigmawithomega}\\ ] ] @xmath26 can be written as @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is plasma frequency at the center of unp and @xmath29 is the radial density profile .    in eq.[eq : pwithomega ] and eq.[eq : sigmawithomega ] , the dipole radiation power and the effective scattering cross section tend to a constant when the microwave frequency is much greater than the plasma frequency .",
    "but it is worthy to note the corresponding constant reflects the crucial properties of plasma .",
    "the unp has a typical guassian - like radial density profile @xmath30 . in the unp situation , fig.[fig : calradiationpowervsomega2 ] and fig.[fig : calcrosssectionvsomega ] illuminate the constant tendency when the ratio of microwave and plasma frequency is greater than 5 in three different density cases . in the two figures , the dipole radiation power @xmath31 and the effective scattering cross section @xmath32 are scaled vertically by @xmath33 and @xmath34 respectively .",
    "the overlapping horizontal lines at large frequency ratio indicate the radiation power and cross section never change while @xmath23 increases at large @xmath23 .",
    "the classical @xmath35 dependence of dipole radiation is not satisfied here .",
    "specially , when the microwave frequency is large enough it shows the frequency independence as we explained above .",
    "the underlying reason is the frequency dependence of the equivalent dipole instead of the assumption of constant dipole in the classical description .    for large @xmath36",
    ", we can ignore the term of @xmath37 in eq.[eq : pwithomega ] and eq.[eq : sigmawithomega ] , and get the dipole radiation power @xmath38 ^ 2= \\frac{4\\pi e^4 e_0 ^ 2}{3\\epsilon_0 m_e^2c^3 } [ \\int n_e(r )",
    "r^2 dr ] ^2= \\frac { e^4 n_e^2e_0 ^ 2}{12\\pi\\epsilon_0 m_e^2c^3 } \\label{eq : pwithoutomega}\\ ] ] the effective scattering cross section @xmath39",

    "eqns.[eq : pwithoutomega]-[eq : erwithoutomega ] demonstrate the formula of unp dipole radiation is free from the the frequency @xmath23 or plasma density profile @xmath29 , but only dependent of total electron number @xmath2 . though we still do nt break the resolution limitation on the microwave diagnostics technology ,",
    "it is significant to give a clue of the space integral on density i.e. @xmath2 .",
    "moreover , the recombination rate can be calculated based the @xmath2 measurement .",
    "the ultracold neutral plasma is produced in very low electron temperature . in this range of temperature , the three body recombination(tbr )",
    "dominates over the electron and ion recombination . through the tbr , one ion recombines with two electrons into a rydberg atom and an leftover electron with the extra energy .",
    "the classical tbr theory predicts the recombination rate per ion is @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is given in @xmath47 and the density @xmath13 in @xmath48 , so the tbr rate varies with temperature as @xmath49 and is very fast at ultracold temperatures@xcite .",
    "the tbr effect is very important in unp , because it is the main heating mechanism for the electron at low @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "it has attracted wide interest and much controversy .",
    "microwave diagnostics of unp may offer a new way to detect the recombination rate of unp .    as one example of the application , we consider an expanding unp with @xmath50 and initial center density @xmath51 .",
    "these two parameters are determined by the cool laser and are typical in the experiment .",
    "though in general case the plasma cloud expands with characteristic expansion time @xmath52}$ ] after creation@xcite , the total electron number @xmath2 would not been changed during the expansion if there was no any recombination .",
    "so when we calculate the total electron number @xmath53 , we need consider only tbr without expansion .",
    "we use a simple formulations for tbr @xmath45 ( there is some other discussion about tbr @xcite , but the details of tbr mechanism are out of this paper s scope ) . so we can get @xmath54 , and @xmath55 .",
    "fig.[fig : ne_t ] shows the typical time evolution of @xmath53 at three distinct initial electron temperatures .",
    "clearly @xmath2 falls too sharply in the initial short time when initial electron temperature @xmath56 , it is hard to get enough temporal resolution . so in the next figure , we only plot curves in @xmath57 and @xmath58 condition .",
    "finally , we give a numerical case .",
    "the initial center density @xmath51 , so the plasma frequency at unp center @xmath59 .",
    "if incident microwave frequency @xmath60 is greater than @xmath61 , we can directly use eqns.[eq : pwithoutomega]-[eq : erwithoutomega ] to estimate the equivalent dipole of the unp cloud unrelated to @xmath60 .",
    "fig.[fig : example ] shows the results of effective cross section , radiation power and radiation electric filed when the incident microwave is @xmath62 , the radiation electric filed @xmath40 in the fig is calculated at @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "our calculations indicate that the dipole radiations of unp do not depend on specific density profile @xmath65 and incident frequency @xmath23 when @xmath66 , but on the total electron number @xmath2 .",
    "we suggest that the microwave radiation from unp may offer a new way to get the information of recombination in unp , or other expanding inhomogeneous plasma in similar ."
