    "for galaxy formation studies , it is essential to understand physical conditions of inter - stellar medium ( ism ) of galaxies . physical properties of hot ism are characterized by gas - phase metallicity and ionization parameter .",
    "a gas - phase metallicity is a record of galaxy s star formation history and gas infall@xmath20outflow , and is commonly defined by oxygen abundance , .",
    "metallicity estimates can be made with metal lines divided by a hydrogen recombination line , such as ( @xmath21@xmath20@xmath5)@xmath4(@xmath22-index ; e.g. , @xcite ) and @xmath23@xmath4  ratio ( @xmath24-index ; e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "an ionization parameter , , is sensitive to the degree of excitation of an -region .",
    "it is defined as the ratio of mean ionizing photon flux to mean atom density , and its dimensionless form , @xmath25 , is also used .",
    "ionization parameters are estimated with emission lines of different ionization stages of the same element , such as @xmath26@xmath4@xmath5 ratio ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "metallicities of galaxies have been well studied in the local and high-@xmath8 universe in the diagram of stellar - mass vs. metallicity ( @xmath12@xmath13 ) relation . in the local universe ,",
    "a tight @xmath12@xmath13 relation is recognized , where a metallicity increases with stellar mass ( e.g. , @xcite ) . at high-@xmath8 ,",
    "similar @xmath12@xmath13 relations are reported at @xmath27 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "these studies find the evolution of @xmath12@xmath13 relation ; a metallicity decreases towards high-@xmath8 at a given @xmath12 .",
    "recently , @xcite and @xcite identify that the @xmath12@xmath13 relation depends on star formation rate ( sfr ) , which is initially suggested by @xcite , and propose the fundamental metallicity relation ( fmr ) that forms a single plane in the stellar - mass , metallicity , and sfr space .",
    "the fmr holds over @xmath28 with no evolution .",
    "this would indicate that there are physical processes commonly found in local and high-@xmath8 galaxies .",
    "many follow - up studies test the universality of the fmr over the wide range of stellar mass , sfr , and redshifts ( e.g , ) .",
    "although galaxies at @xmath29 follow the fmr , galaxies at @xmath30 appear to fall below the fmr @xcite .",
    "@xcite claim that this disagreement suggests that there are physical mechanisms different from those of low - z galaxies at @xmath17 . however , this is still an open question .",
    "in contrast to metallicities , ionization parameters of galaxies are poorly understood .",
    "recently , @xcite use a diagram of @xmath4  ratio and @xmath22-index to study ionization parameters and metallicities for galaxies at @xmath0 , focusing on the properties of ly@xmath18 emitters ( laes ) at @xmath15 .",
    "@xcite report that a typical ionization parameter increases towards high-@xmath8 , and suggest the evolution of ionization parameter ( see also , @xcite ) .",
    "however , until recently , statistical studies for ionization parameters do not cover ( i ) physical relations between ionization parameter and galaxy global properties , such as stellar mass and sfr , and ( ii ) evolution of the physical relations with ionization parameter .",
    "@xcite present that in the local universe an ionization parameter seems to gradually decrease with @xmath12 , but do not address the issue about evolution of this trend ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "there is another diagnostics of ionization parameter , using a plot of @xmath4  and @xmath4  ratios that is referred to as the bpt diagram @xcite .",
    "local star - forming galaxies form a tight sequence on the bpt diagram ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast , high-@xmath8 galaxies depart from the local star - forming sequence towards higher @xmath4   ratio ( e.g. , ) .",
    "similarly , recent spectroscopic surveys report that high-@xmath8 galaxies on average have @xmath4  ratios much higher than local similar mass galaxies @xcite .",
    "one interpretation of that departure is evolution of ionization parameter ( e.g. , @xcite ) . @xcite",
    "have compared high-@xmath8 galaxy line ratios and theoretical predictions to investigate evolution of the star - forming sequence on the bpt diagram , and claimed that high-@xmath8 galaxies would have a larger ionization parameter , a higher electron density , and/or a harder ionizing radiation field ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite have also argued a possibility that the typical gas density of -regions would be much higher in high-@xmath8 galaxies .",
    "ionization parameters are also important for accurate estimates of metallicity from nebular emission lines .",
    "metallicity estimation methods based on local empirical relations ( e.g. , @xcite ) are often applied to high-@xmath8 galaxies .",
    "these methods implicitly assume ionization parameters of typical local galaxies .",
    "since various studies suggest that ionization parameter evolves with redshift , the estimated metallicities from local empirical relations would be biased .",
    "recently , a relationship between ionization parameter and escape fraction of ionizing photons ( ) and its importance for cosmic reionization are discussed .",
    "@xcite have pointed out a possibility that  positively correlates with ionization parameter , since an optically - thin nebula could show a high @xmath4  ratio ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "if this correlation of ionization parameter and  is established , ionization parameters allow us to investigate ionizing photon escapes that can not be directly observed for galaxies at the epoch of reionization ( @xmath31 ; @xcite ) .",
    "studies of galaxies at @xmath32 have identified a tension between the ionizing photon production rate and cosmic reionization ( e.g. , @xcite ) . a moderately high average  of @xmath33",
    "would be required for galaxies in the early universe to keep the inter - galactic medium ( igm ) ionized .",
    "@xcite have suggested that laes exhibit higher ionization parameters than other high-@xmath8 galaxy populations such as lyman - break galaxies ( lbgs ) . because observations reveal that a fraction of laes to star - forming galaxies of lbgs increases with redshift ( e.g. , @xcite ) , more laes with a high ionization parameter , i.e. , a high , would ease the tension of the deficit of ionizing photons at the early universe .",
    "however , the claim of @xcite is made only with two laes , and it is unclear whether this is a general feature of laes .",
    "one needs to ( i ) investigate the trend that laes typically show an ionization parameter higher than lbgs , and ( ii ) understand the physical reason of the correlation between ionization parameter and  with theoretical models .",
    "although predicting  is challenging by using simulations or theoretical models due to the large uncertainties in the assumptions about the ism and the limited resolutions ( e.g. , @xcite ) , we investigate the correlation with photoionization models assuming a simple , homogeneous gas cloud as the first step .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we describe our samples of galaxies in section [ sec : samples ] , and test the main sample of sdss in section [ sec : testing_sample ] . in section [ sec : o3o2r23 ] , we show all of our galaxies in the @xmath4  vs. @xmath22-index diagram , and investigate galaxy properties in the diagram with the aid of photoionization models .",
    "we then clarify the dependencies of ionization parameter on galaxy global properties of stellar mass , sfr , and metallicities .",
    "we introduce a new relation named fundamental ionization relation ( fir ) that is described in the four - dimensional parameter space of @xmath4  ratio , @xmath22-index , stellar mass , and sfr .",
    "we discuss these observational results in section [ sec : discussion ] , addressing the issues of ( i ) the evolution of ionization parameter , ( ii ) the fmr evolution at @xmath30 , ( iii ) the relations between @xmath4  ratio , @xmath22-index , stellar mass , and sfr , and ( iv ) the correlation between ionization parameter and .",

    "second , gas temperature changes the emissivity of  and   lines .",
    "gas temperature is determined by the metal abundance , because coolings are dominated by collisionally excited metal ions such as o@xmath91 , o@xmath92 , n@xmath91 etc .",

    "indeed , @xcite have confirmed that high-@xmath8 galaxies tend to have a high electron density , which is measured directly from emission lines .    because ionization parameter is determined by @xmath100 , @xmath102 , and @xmath106 ( equation [ eq : qion3_n1 ] ) ,",

    "we investigate ionization state of hot ism in galaxies at @xmath0 with @xmath1 sdss galaxies and @xmath2 intermediate and high redshift galaxies , using an ionization parameter and metallicity sensitive line ratios of @xmath26@xmath4@xmath5 and @xmath210@xmath21@xmath20@xmath211@xmath4(@xmath22-index ) .",
    "our main results are summarized as follows .",
    "* we confirm that @xmath6 galaxies show an @xmath4  ratio significantly higher than a typical star - forming galaxy of sdss by a factor of @xmath7 ( figure [ fig : o3o2r23_solo ] ) .",
    "the photoionization models reveal that these high-@xmath8 galaxies have an ionization parameter of @xmath9@xmath4@xmath10 , a factor of @xmath11 higher than local galaxies ( figure [ fig : z_qion ] ) . *",
    "we find a high ionization parameter in local extreme populations of green pea galaxies ( gps ) , lyman - continuum emitting galaxies ( lyc leakers ) , and lyman break analogs ( lbas ) , and the ionization parameters of these galaxies are comparable with the ones of @xmath164 galaxies ( figure [ fig : z_qion ] ) . these local extreme populations are quite rare , and their number densities are nearly two orders of magnitude smaller than those of @xmath164 galaxies . * we identify a correlation between the @xmath4  ratio and galaxy global properties of star - formation rate ( sfr ) , stellar mass ( @xmath12 ) , and metallicity ( figure [ fig : o3o2_properties ] ) .",
    "a high @xmath4  ratio is found in less massive , efficiently star - forming , and metal - poor galaxies . *",
    "we develop a four - dimensional relation of ionization parameter , sfr , @xmath12 , and metallicity ( figure [ fig : o3o2r23_all ] ) , extending the fundamental metallicity relation ( fmr ; @xcite ) with ionization parameter .",
    "the intermediate and high-@xmath8 galaxies up to @xmath14 as well as the local extreme populations follow the same relation defined with the sdss galaxies ( figure [ fig : o3o2r23_mu_f_solo ] ) .",
    "the relation is thus referred to as the fundamental ionization relation ( fir ) .",
    "* we particularly find no significant differences between galaxies at @xmath15 and @xmath16 in the fir ( figure [ fig : o3o2r23_mu_f_solo ] ) .",
    "this is in contrast with the fmr whose possible evolution from @xmath15 to @xmath16 is reported @xcite .",
    "we suggest that the fmr evolution can arise , if one omits ionization parameter differences and adopts local empirical metallicity relations for high-@xmath8 galaxies .",
    "we indicate that the fmr evolution does not exist for one out of two average metallicity solutions of @xmath17 galaxies with a high ionization parameter of @xmath9@xmath4@xmath212 ( right panel of figure [ fig : fmr_z3 ] ) . *",
    "we find the @xmath163 lyc leakers exhibit @xmath4  ratios significantly higher than typical low-@xmath8 galaxies , although there are only two lyc leakers .",
    "this trend suggests a positive correlation between @xmath4 and ionizing photon escape fraction ( ) .",
    "our photoionization models of cloudy reproduce the trend ( figure [ fig : o3o2_fesc ] ) . since @xmath4  ratios for @xmath164 galaxies , especially  emitters ( laes ) , are comparable to , or higher than , those of the low-@xmath8 lyc leakers , these high-@xmath8 galaxies are candidates of high  objects .",
    "* our cloudy photoionization models reveal that ew ( ) remains almost unchanged if its  is @xmath213 ( figure [ fig : ewlya_fesc_nestor13 ] ) , indicating that galaxies are identified as laes of a ly@xmath18 emitting population if their  values are below @xmath200 .",
    "faint galaxies with intrinsically - bright ly@xmath18 having a high  could significantly contribute to the ionizing photon production for cosmic reionization , since recent observations report that a fraction of laes in star - forming galaxies increases with redshift at the epoch with no igm damping absorption ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "if it is true , this would ease the tension of ionizing photon deficit problem ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "<S> . a strong ly@xmath18 emission can coexist with a large  of @xmath19 , and the increasing fraction of laes towards high-@xmath8 reconciles the picture of cosmic reionization whose major ionizing sources are faint galaxies having _ intrinsically_-bright  emission .    </S>",
