    "fiber bundle model represents a simple , stochastic fracture - failure process @xcite in materials subjected to external load .",
    "the model consists of three basic ingredients : ( a ) a discrete set of @xmath0 elements located at sites of a lattice ( b ) a probability distribution of the strength threshold of individual elements ( fibers ) ( c ) a load - transfer rule which distributes the terminal load carried by the failed fibers to the surviving fibers .",
    "the model study was initiated by peirce @xcite in the context of testing the strength of cotton yarns . since then",
    "this model has been studied and modified by many groups [ 3 - 25 ] using analytic as well as numerical methods .",
    "fiber bundles are of two classes with respect to the time dependence of fiber strength threshold : ` static ' bundles contain fibers whose threshold strengths are independent of time and such bundles are subjected to quasi static loading , i.e. , the load is increased steadily up to the complete failure of the bundles .",
    "the load or stress @xmath1 ( load per fiber ) is an independent variable here and the strength of the bundle is determined by the maximum value of the applied load or stress ( @xmath2 ) that can be supported by the bundle . on the other hand",
    "` dynamic ' bundles consist of fibers having time dependent strength and the fibers fail due to fatigue @xcite after a period of time which varies fiber to fiber . the time taken for complete failure",
    "is called the lifetime of the bundle . according to the load sharing rule , fiber bundles are being classified into two groups : equal load - sharing ( els ) bundles [ 8 - 17 ] or democratic bundles and local load - sharing ( lls ) bundles @xcite . in the els models all the intact fibers equally share the terminal load of a failed fiber , whereas in lls model",
    "the terminal load gets shared among the intact nearest neighbors .",
    "els models show phase transition from partial failure to total failure at a critical strength ( @xmath2 ) . the critical behavior in the failure dynamics of els bundles has been solved analytically @xcite and the universality of the els model has been established @xcite recently .",
    "however the strength of lls models goes to zero @xcite at the limit of infinite system size and this does not permit any critical behavior in the failure process .",
    "the els and lls models belong to two opposite extremes with respect to the spatial correlations in stress redistributions .",
    "these models do not incorporate any type of stress gradient among the intact fibers which is an usual expectation .",
    "therefore a load sharing scheme in between els and lls should be a realistic approach to study the failure of heterogeneous materials .",
    "hansen and hemmer @xcite introduced a ` @xmath3 model ' to interpolate between els and lls models where @xmath3 is an adjustable stress transfer factor .",
    "although they conjectured the existence of a critical crossover value @xmath4 which separates the mean field ( els ) regime and the short range ( lls ) regime , what would be the exact crossover point was not answered . a recent approach by hidalgo et al @xcite incorporate both the els and lls mode introducing an effective range of interaction parameter ( @xmath5 ) which is actually the power of the stress redistribution function .",
    "they observed crossover behavior in strength variation and in the avalanche statistics of the failures .",
    "also they determined the crossover point ( @xmath6 ) through the moment analysis of the cluster size distributions before total failure .    in this paper",
    "we develop a mixed - mode load sharing ( mmls ) model which interpolates the els and lls models correctly .",
    "we intend to study whether this model shows a continuous transition from mean - field ( els ) behavior to extreme statistics ( lls ) , or there exists a definite crossover point .",
    "we organize this paper as follows : after introduction ( section i ) we present our mmls model in section ii .",
    "section iii contains the observations of crossover behavior through numerical study of the model .",
    "the analysis to determine exact crossover point is given in section iv .",
    "the final section ( v ) is devoted for discussions including our conclusions .",
    "our mixed - mode load sharing ( mmls ) scheme is basically a coupling of els and lls mode : when a fiber fails , a fraction ( @xmath7 ) of its terminal load gets shared among the nearest neighbors of the failed fiber ( lls rule ) and the rest ( @xmath8 fraction ) is distributed equally among all the surviving fibers ( els rule ) . here ` @xmath7 ' is the weight parameter of the mmls scheme .",
    "therefore , the model reduces exactly to els model for @xmath9 and for @xmath10 , it becomes pure lls one . as we have chosen @xmath11 fiber bundle model ( with periodic boundary condition ) , the number of nearest neighbors is always two .",
    "we study the behavior of the model for the entire range @xmath12 using monte - carlo simulations for step - wise equal load increment @xcite until the total failure of the bundle . during the entire study we consider uniform ( on average ) distribution of fiber strength threshold in the bundle .",
    "it is known since daniels @xcite that the els bundles have a nonzero strength ( @xmath2 ) above which the bundle fails completely .",
    "recently it has been shown analytically @xcite that for uniform fiber threshold distribution , bundle s strength approaches the value @xmath13 as system size goes to infinity .",
    "on the other hand lls bundles do not have any nonzero strength @xcite . in our mmls model",
    "we intend to study the strength variation of bundles with system size as well as with the weight parameter @xmath7 .",
    ".1 in    * fig . 1 : * the strength of the bundle for different system sizes ( @xmath0 ) as a function of the weight parameter @xmath7 .",
    ".1 in    as @xmath7 increases , the bundle becomes weaker due to the short - range ( lls ) interactions .",
    "therefore @xmath2 decreases with increasing @xmath7 values ( fig .",
    "we can see that @xmath2 seems to be independent on system size ( dominance of els ) up to @xmath14 and beyond @xmath15 , a strong system size dependence ( dominance of lls ) appears .",
    "this observation is supported by fig .",
    "2 , where we have shown the logarithmic size dependence of @xmath2 .",
    "up to @xmath14 , the curves eventually become flat as the system size increases . but for @xmath16 , all the curves fall ( following inclined straight line ) .",
    "thus the two regimes are differentiated clearly .",
    ".2 in    * fig . 2 : * the logarithmic size dependence of bundle s strength for different values of @xmath7 .",
    "the straight lines represent the best fit .",
    "the avalanche size distribution characterizes the fracture process by reflecting the precursory activities toward complete failure .",
    "this can be related to the acoustic emissions observed in material failure @xcite .",
    "hemmer and hansen showed @xcite analytically that for els models the avalanche size distribution follows an universal power law with exponent value @xmath17 .",
    "but for lls models the numerically estimated apparent exponent value is quite larger @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "later it has been shown analytically ( for flat threshold distributions ) that for lls model , no universal power - law asymptotics exists @xcite .",
    ".1 in    * fig . 3 : * avalanche size distribution for different values of the weight parameter @xmath7 ( averaging over @xmath19 configurations for system size @xmath20 ) .",
    "the dotted line represents mean - field result having exponent value @xmath17 .",
    "clearly , the upper group of curves can be fitted by the mean - field power law whereas the lower group does not show power law at all .",
    ".1 in    here we have measured ( fig .",
    "3 ) the avalanche size distributions for different @xmath7 values . clearly",
    ", two groups of curves appear .",
    "the upper group ( @xmath21 ) can be fitted with the mean - field result ( @xmath17 ) where as the lower group ( @xmath22 ) show a clear deviation from the power law .",
    "recently , the dynamic response parameters , susceptibility ( @xmath23 ) @xcite and relaxation time ( @xmath24 ) @xcite have been studied in fiber bundle models .",
    "the susceptibility is defined as the number of fibers fail due to an infinitesimal change of the external stress ( @xmath1 ) on the bundle and the relaxation time is the time ( number of stress redistributions ) the bundle takes to come to a stable fixed point at an external stress ( @xmath1 ) . for els model ,",
    "the susceptibility and relaxation time seem to follow power law with the applied stress and both of them diverge @xcite at the critical strength @xmath2 : @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "however , one can not expect such scaling behavior in lls models due to the absence of ` critical ' strength .",
    "the step - wise equal load increment method @xcite enables to measure @xmath23 and @xmath24 for different values of @xmath7 ( fig .",
    "the power law behavior ( with mean - field exponent @xmath27 ) remains unchanged up to @xmath14 and for @xmath16 the curves do not follow power laws at all .",
    "thus the susceptibility and relaxation time variations also suggest a transition from the mean - field to short range behavior to happen in between @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    ".2 in    * fig . 4 : * the susceptibility ( @xmath23 ) and relaxation time ( @xmath24 ) variations for different g values .",
    "the bundle contains @xmath28 fibers and the data are averaged over @xmath28 configurations .",
    "the breakdown sequence reflects the correlations of the breaking process @xcite . while the els model simply ignores the spatial arrangement of the fibers , lls model gives much importance on it .",
    "therefore , as @xmath7 increases ( lls mode dominates ) the breaking process becomes more and more correlated ( fig .",
    "also we can identify two distinct regimes .",
    "we can not see any spatial correlation among the broken fibers ( except near the total failure ) up to @xmath14 , whereas for @xmath16 strong correlations ( black patch ) develop long before the total failure .",
    ".2 in    .5in@xmath291.0 in @xmath14    .1 in    .1 in    .5in@xmath151.0 in @xmath30    * fig . 5 : * the space - time diagram of the breakdown sequence in mmls model .",
    "the positions of the fibers are marked on the @xmath31 axis and @xmath32 axis is a ` time ' axis where time indicates the number of stress redistribution starting from initial loading .",
    "the white color represents intact fibers while the black regions stands for the broken fibers .",
    "the fracture process can also be characterized by analyzing the clusters of broken fibers just before complete failure @xcite .",
    "the size distributions of the clusters ( @xmath33 vs. @xmath34 ) are shown ( fig .",
    "6 ) for different values of @xmath7 .",
    "although the distributions appear as two groups , it is not possible to identify the exact crossover point from this .",
    "therefore we go for the moment analysis : the @xmath35-th moment of the cluster distributions is defined @xcite as@xmath36    clearly the zero - th moment ( @xmath37 ) gives the total number clusters and the first moment gives the total number of broken fibers .",
    "we can get the average cluster size dividing the second moment ( @xmath38 ) by first moment ( @xmath39 ) .",
    ".2 in    * fig . 6 :",
    "* cluster size distributions of broken fibers ( just before complete failure ) for different g values ( averaging over @xmath19 samples for @xmath20 ) .",
    ".2 in    * fig . 7 : *",
    "the moments of the cluster size distributions as a function of the weight parameter g ( averaging over @xmath19 samples for @xmath20 ) .",
    ".2 in    in case of pure els mode ( @xmath9 ) , we have only long - range interaction and the clusters are randomly distributed within the lattice .",
    "as @xmath7 increases the stress redistribution becomes more and more localized in the neighborhood of the failed fibers and a few isolated crack can trigger the complete rupture through growth and coalescence mechanism .",
    "therefore the pure els mode can store the maximum crack ( cluster ) and this capacity should decrease with the increase of @xmath7 .",
    "we can see ( fig .",
    "7 ) that both @xmath37 and @xmath39 decrease with increasing @xmath7 value and they fall drastically in between @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "this crossover is much robust in case of @xmath38 and the average cluster size ( @xmath40 ) , both of which show a sharp peak , which indicates the dominance of lls mode over the els mode @xcite .",
    ".2 in    * fig . 8 :",
    "* system size dependence of the crossover point .",
    ".1 in    to check how the crossover point changes its position with system size , we have done the similar cluster moment analysis for several system sizes .",
    "we observe a weak system size dependence of the peak position i.e. , the crossover point ( fig . 8) . with proper extrapolation",
    "we determine the crossover point ( @xmath41 ) to be at @xmath42 for the infinite system size .",
    "the fracture and breakdown of loaded materials is basically a cooperative phenomenon guided by the load redistribution mechanism . here",
    "` crack ' opens up when an element ( fiber ) fails after external loading .",
    "this single fiber failure should affect the neighbors much than the distant elements ( like in electric fuse models @xcite ) .",
    "therefore a high stress concentration ( after the load redistribution ) around a crack ( failed fiber ) is a natural expectation .",
    "the els models do not incorporate any spatial correlations and exhibit perfect democracy ( mean - field ) , whereas the lls models confine themselves within the nearest neighbor interactions .",
    "in this situation attempts @xcite to study the failure behavior in between els and lls regimes , would be most welcome . also , a recent experiment on loaded wood - fiber @xcite demands an intermediate load sharing scheme to explain the observed strength variation .",
    "the ` @xmath3 model ' @xcite becomes a lls model at @xmath43 .",
    "but it can not be reduced to a pure els model at @xmath44 , as the neighbors of the just broken fibers become ` immunized ' against failure .",
    "although the ` variable range of interaction ' model @xcite determines the exact crossover point , it remains silent about the system size dependence of crossover point , which is nevertheless an important issue .",
    "our mixed - mode load sharing ( mmls ) model exactly reduces to els model at @xmath9 and to lls model at @xmath10 .",
    "we establish numerically that the mmls model in one dimension shows a distinct crossover behavior from mean - field to short - range interaction .",
    "the strength ( @xmath2 ) variation of the bundle with system size , the avalanche statistics and the failure dynamics ( susceptibility and relaxation time ) suggest that the crossover point ( @xmath41 ) must be in between @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the cluster size analysis determines the exact crossover point in one dimension for several system sizes and a proper extrapolation suggests the crossover point to be @xmath45 at the limit of infinite system size . for @xmath46",
    "the model exhibits critical behavior ( supported by the power laws ) for the dominance of els mode .",
    "but the fluctuations suppress any critical behavior after @xmath47 , where extreme statistics @xcite dominates .",
    "we should mention that as the ultimate strength ( @xmath2 ) of the bundle continuously decreases with the increasing @xmath7 value , we can not exclude the possibility of different critical behavior for @xmath9 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 in higher dimensions , like in case of @xmath50 ising systems with disorder @xcite .",
    "therefore we expect this crossover behavior in mmls model to be more prominent in higher dimensions .",
