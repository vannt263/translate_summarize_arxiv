    "single - molecule electronics has shown significant progress in the recent years . a variety of interesting effects have been observed in the transport properties of single ( or a few ) conjugated organic molecules including rectification , negative differential resistance , and switching @xcite . in these quasi - one dimensional systems , which present well delocalised @xmath0-electrons",
    ", the electronic current flowing through the quite flexible backbone of the molecule affects the ground state properties of both electronic and mechanical degrees of freedom of the molecule .",
    "the importance of inelastic effects in the transport properties has been demonstrated in several ground - breaking experiments @xcite ; these effects are related to the interaction between electron and mechanical degrees of freedom of the molecule .",
    "the interaction between an injected charge carrier ( electron or hole ) and the mechanical degrees of freedom ( phonon , vibron ) in the molecular junctions is important in order to understand energy transfer , heating and dissipation in the nanojunction @xcite .",
    "the electron - vibron  interaction is also at the heart of inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy ( iets ) .",
    "iets is a solid - state - based spectroscopy which gives information about the vibration modes ( vibrons ) of the molecules in the nanojunction @xcite .",
    "it is now possible to measure such vibrational spectra for single molecules by using scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm )  @xcite to build iets maps  @xcite , or by using other electromigrated junctions or mechanically controlled break junctions @xcite .    at low applied bias ( typically 100 - 400 mev ) the iets show features ( peaks , dips , or peak - dip - like lineshape ) which have been attributed to selective excitation of specific vibration modes of the molecule .",
    "the position in energy ( bias ) of the features correspond approximately to the frequency of the vibration , as given by other spectroscopic data ( ir , raman ) obtained on the same molecules in a different environment .",
    "there have been many theoretical investigations focusing on the effects of electron - vibron coupling in molecular and atomic scale wires @xcite .",
    "most of them have focused on the interpretation of the features in iets .",
    "however , most of these studies have been performed by using the lowest - order expansion possible for treating the effects of the electron - vibron  interaction ( i.e using the so - called self - consistent born approximation scba ) . in the language of many - body perturbation theory",
    ", it corresponds to a self - consistent hartree - fock calculation for the electron - vibron  coupling .",
    "however , in analogy to what is obtained at the hartree - fock level for interacting electrons , there are good reasons to believe that this approximation is not enough to correctly describe the physics of the electron - vibron  interacting system , especially beyond the weak electron - vibron  coupling regime .",
    "for example , the limits of scba have already been investigated in ref .",
    "[ ] but without introducing remedies to go beyond scba .    in this paper ,",
    "we examine this using a true non - equilibrium greens - function ( negf ) technique @xcite which allows us to study all the different transport regimes in the presence of electron - vibron  interaction . following the spirit of many - body perturbation theory and feynman diagrammatics , we go beyond the commonly - used scba approximation by introducing higher - order diagrams for the electron - vibron  interaction",
    ".    we study the simplest possible model system which nonetheless contains the relevant physics of the transport properties of the molecular junction @xcite . furthermore , because of the uncertainty of the exact geometry of the single - molecule junction in the experiments , there is a corresponding uncertainty about how to model the coupling between the molecule and the electrodes and correspondly for the potential drops at each molecule - electrode contacts .",
    "hence we take the quantitites characterizing the potential drops at the contacts as phenomenological parameters @xcite .",
    "we concentrate in this paper on the electronic properties of the molecular junction in both equilibrium and non - equilibrium conditions as well as on the linear - response properties of the junction ( prior to considering the full non - equilibrium transport properties in a forthcoming paper ) .",
    "such properties are given by the density of electronic states and represented by the spectral functions , which are at the very heart of all physical properties of the system , such as the charge density , the current density , the total energy , etc .",
    "spectral functions are most closely related to photoemission and adsorption spectroscopies . to our knowledge",
    "such experiments have not yet been performed on single - molecule junctions , though photoemission spectra have been measured on quasi one - dimensional supported atomic scale metallic wires ( see for example ref .",
    "[ ] showing interesting results on one - dimensional collective electronic excitations ) .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "we start with a description of our model system in section [ sec : hamiltonian ] and a discussion of the relevant underlying theory of non - equilibrium green s functions in section [ sec : non - equil - greens ] .",
    "our calculated spectral functions are presented in section [ sec : res : spec_fnc ] , where we consider first the equilibrium case ( section [ sec : at - equilibrium ] ) and then the non - equilibrium case ( section [ sec : noneq - specfns ] ) at the hartree - fock level .",
    "we discuss especially the effects of including or not the hartree diagram in the calculation .",
    "we also compare negf calculations with results obtained from inelastic scattering techniques @xcite for equivalent model systems in section [ sec : comp - with - inelastic - scattering - technique ] .",
    "we show that it is indeed necessary to go beyond scba to obtain correct results for the relevant range of electron - vibron  coupling .",
    "we then present the effects of the second - order diagrams in the spectral functions in section [ sec : vert - corr - spectr ] .",
    "the second - order diagrams correspond to two classes of process ; the first is related to vertex corrections of the scba calculation and the second to polarisation effects ( i.e. partial dressing of the vibron propagator by the electron - hole bubble diagram ) . in section",
    "[ sec : linear_reponse ] we discuss the effects of different levels of approximation for the electron - vibron  coupling on the linear conductance of the molecular junctions . throughout the paper",
    ", we will use the term vibron to define a quantum of vibration of a mechanical degree of freedom .",
    "our model is based on a system with an interacting central region connected to two non - interacting electrodes ( see figure [ fig : leadsmolecule ] ) .",
    "is broadened by the coupling to the leads ; the electronic transport is resonant if the fermi levels @xmath1 are very close to this broadened level , and off - resonant ( as shown ) otherwise .",
    "the system is shown in equilibrium , with @xmath2 , non - equilibrium effects are studied by moving the fermi levels .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ] +    the total hamiltonian for the system is given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 represent the electronic , vibron , and electron - vibron coupling parts of the hamiltonian respectively .",
    "the electronic part of the hamiltonian is broken into sections describing the left ( right ) electrode @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) , the central interacting part @xmath8 and the potentials coupling the central region to the left and right electrodes @xmath9 respectively : @xmath10    the hamiltonians for the electrodes are given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) creates ( annihilates ) a _ non - interacting _ electron with energy @xmath14 on electrode @xmath15 .",
    "the electronic hamiltonian for the central region and the coupling potentials are given by @xmath16 where the interacting electrons in the central region are created ( annihilated ) on electronic level @xmath17 by the operators @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) .    in principle , our hamiltonian for the central region may contain electron - electron interactions , and is built from a complete set of single - electron creation and annihilation operators . in our current work",
    "we do not include any electron - electron interactions , and so the electronic part of the total hamiltonian for the central region @xmath20 becomes @xmath21    meanwhile , the vibron part of the hamiltonian is represented by @xmath22 where @xmath23 creates ( annihilates ) a vibron in vibron mode @xmath24 with frequency @xmath25 .",
    "the electron - vibron coupling term is taken to be linear in the vibron displacement and its most general expression is then given by @xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the coupling constant for exciting the vibron mode @xmath24 by electronic transition between the electronic levels @xmath17 and @xmath28 .",
    "we concentrate on the simplest version of the hamiltonian of the central part : the single - site single - mode sssm model , in which one considers just one electron level coupled to one vibration mode . despite the simplicity of this model , remarkably it not only contains all the physics we require but also ensures that we isolate the properties we are interested in without the complication of the added electronic levels .",
    "the reasons for this are as follows .",
    "firstly , when the fermi energy of the leads is pinned around the midgap , then at low and intermediate biases one of the frontier orbitals ( either homo or lumo ) dominates the transport properties . secondly in conjugated organic molecules ( mostly used in single - molecule junction experiments )",
    ", it is known that the optically relevant vibration modes are mostly coupled to either the homo or lumo levels @xcite .",
    "we can therefore be confident that our model contains the relevant physics .",
    "the total hamiltonian for the central region thus becomes @xmath29 where we now have just one electronic level @xmath30 and just one vibron mode @xmath31 , coupled via the electron - vibron  coupling constant @xmath32 .",
    "the expression for the lead - central - region coupling ( equation ( [ eq : couplingpot ] ) ) also simplifies to become @xmath33 where we have replaced the coupling potentials @xmath34 with hopping integrals @xmath35 .",
    "non - equilibrium  ( negf ) within the keldysh formalism @xcite represent an extremely useful tool for studying the non - equilibrium properties of many - particle systems .",
    "the  are functions of two space - time coordinates , and are obviously more complicated than the one - particle density which is the main ingredient of density - functional - based theories .",
    "one of the great advantage of negf techniques is that one can improve the calculations in a systematic way by taking into account specific physical processes ( represented by feynman diagrams ) which is what we do in this paper for the electron - vibron  interaction .",
    "the  provide us directly with all expectation values of one - body operators ( such as the density and the current ) , and also the total energy , the response functions , spectral functions , etc .",
    "in appendix [ app : higherorderdiagrams ] , we provide more details about negf and how to obtained the electron - vibron  self - energies from a feynman diagrammatic expansion of the electron - vibron  interaction .",
    "we now briefly describe how we apply the negf formalism to the sssm model .",
    "the green s functions are calculated via dyson - like equations .",
    "for the retarded and advanced green s functions @xmath36 these are @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the non - interacting green s function for the isolated central region .    for the greater @xmath39 and lesser @xmath40 green s functions , we use a quantum kinetic equation of the form @xmath41 here @xmath42 is a total self - energy consisting of a sum of the self - energies from the constituent parts of the system : @xmath43 @xmath44 are the self - energies arising from the non - interacting leads @xmath45 and as such are simple to calculate : @xmath46 \\ ( 1 - f_\\alpha(\\omega ) ) , \\\\",

    "the component of the retarded green s function for the isolated ( non - interacting ) lead @xmath15 corresponding to the sites ( or energy levels , depending on the representation used to the electrodes ) connected to the central region is given by @xmath54 .    in this paper",
    ", we have chosen a simple model , a semi - infinite tight - binding chain with on - site energy @xmath55 and nearest - neighbour hopping integral @xmath56 .",
    "this model gives a semi - elliptic density of states of the terminal lead site connected to the central region , and so each lead s green s function becomes @xmath57 with @xmath58 .",
    "we have chosen this model because it is one of the most simple , although in principle and in practice there are no limitations for taking any other more complicated or more realistic models for the lead , such as bethe lattices with @xmath59-coordination , or a nanotip supported by a semi - infinite surface as shown in ref  ) since all their electronic properties are wrapped up in the lead self - energies @xmath60 .    the self - energy for the interacting central region , @xmath61 is somewhat more complicated .",
    "it consists of the sum of the self - energies due to interactions between the electrons and to interactions between the electrons and the quantum vibration modes ( vibrons ) . in this paper",
    "we consider only the coupling between each electron and a single vibron of the central region ( the molecule ) , hence the electron - vibron  self - energy @xmath62 .",
    "\\(a ) @xmath63    ( b ) @xmath64    \\(a ) @xmath65   ( b ) @xmath66     for the current work , it is necessary to calculate several types of self energy .",
    "firstly we have the fock - like self - energy @xmath67 , which is a function of energy , and is represented in diagrammatic form by figure  [ fig : fockhartree](a ) .",
    "we also have the hartree - like self - energy @xmath68 which is independent of energy , given by figure [ fig : fockhartree](b ) .",
    "calculations using only the hartree and fock diagrams , and performed in a self - consistent way are usually referred to as the self - consistent born approximation ( scba ) @xcite .    however , as explained in the introduction , we also want to go beyond the scba , and thus we will also calculate two further self - energies that include two - vibron processes .",
    "the first of these is the double - exchange self - energy @xmath69 given by figure [ fig : dx - dph](a ) . in the many - body language , it is part of the vertex correction to the fock diagram .",
    "the second is given by figure [ fig : dx - dph](b ) and corresponds to the dressed vibron ( or gw - like ) self - energy @xmath70 , which consists of the vibron propagator renormalized by a single electron - hole bubble ( the polarization ) .",
    "this is why we refer to the effects of @xmath70 as polarization effects in the following .",
    "the details of how we implement these self - energies are given in appendix [ app : higherorderdiagrams ] .",
    "once we have calculated all the different green s functions , any of the physical properties of the system , such as the electron density , the electronic current denstiy , the total energy , the current noise , the heat transfer , etc . can be calculated .",
    "for example , the electronic current passing through the @xmath15 contact is given by @xmath71 i.e the first term describes the transfer of an electron from the interacting region to electrode @xmath15 , while the second transfers an electron from electrode @xmath15 to the central region .    we can then express this in terms of green s functions and derive an expression for the expectation value of the current@xcite : @xmath72 \\right .   \\\\",

    "the spectral function is related to the imaginary part of the retarded or advanced electron green s functions , as @xmath74 = + \\im m [ g^a(\\omega ) ] \\ .\\ ] ] for non - interacting systems , it is simply proportional to the density of electronic states @xmath75 . for interacting systems , it gives information about the excitations ( electron or hole ) of the system .",
    "furthermore , when the system is at equilibrium ( @xmath76 ) , there are some relationships between the lesser ( greater ) and the advanced and retarded green s functions : @xmath77 and @xmath78 these relationships are at the centre of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem for equilibrium , which also be recast as a relationship betweeen the greater and lesser green s functions : @xmath79 for statistical averages at finite temperature in the grand canonical ensemble .",
    "this equation is related to the kubo - martin - schwinger boundary conditions @xcite .    for non - equilibrium conditions , there is no unique fermi level at finite bias ( or no unique temperature if @xmath80 ) in the whole system , and the relationships given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : glesser_equi]-[eq : glessgreat_kms ] ) no longer hold .",
    "this is an important feature of the non - equilibrium formalism for which conventional equilibrium statistics need to be reformulated .",

    "the hartree diagram has only one component @xmath89 as shown above .",

    "this mixing scheme permits us to achieve full self - consistency in a maybe slightly longer but more stable iterative process .",
    "note finally that by using eq .",
    "[ eq : totalgfkeldysh ] , instead of the more general formulation given by eq .",
    "[ eq : greens - greater - lesser ] , we assume that , after switching on the interactions , there are no bound states in the system ( i.e. there are no interaction - induced electron states located outside the spectral supports of the left and right leads ) @xcite which is indeed the case .",
    "in this section , we present results for the spectral functions @xmath73 for the different transport regimes and for different applied biases in the low vibron - temperature regime .",
    "we divide the calculations into four types .",
    "firstly , we calculate the spectral functions at equilibrium for two transport regimes .",
    "the first of these is where @xmath95 or @xmath96 , known as the off - resonant regime as in order to create a current between the left and right leads one puts an electron in the empty ( for electron transport , @xmath97 ) or full ( for hole transport , @xmath98 ) electronic level @xmath99 .",
    "the second transport regime is when @xmath100 , known as the resonant transport regime .",
    "the linewidth is the width of the peak in the spectral function which arises from the electronic coupling of the central region to the left and right leads . in this case",
    "the electronic level @xmath99 is , at equilibrium , half - filled by an electron ( and thus also half - filled with a hole ) .",
    "for each of these transport regimes , we calculate the spectral function both at equilibrium ( applied bias @xmath101 ) and non - equilibrium at finite bias ( @xmath102 ) .    for each of these four groups (",
    "resonant / off - resonant transport regimes , at / out of equilibrium ) , a large amount of different negf calculations have been performed for different values of the relevant parameters and within different levels of approximation ( hartree fock , hartree fock+second - order , partially or fully self - consistent calculations ) . in the rest of this section ,",
    "we present only a limited and selected number of results which we found the most relevant for each case , and we analyse and compare in detail the effects of the different diagrams on the spectral functions of the system at and out of equilibrium .",
    "we also , in section [ sec : comp - with - inelastic - scattering - technique ] , compare perturbation expansion based calculations ( negf ) to a reference calculation which is exact in term of electron - vibron  coupling but which however is only valid for a specific transport regime .",
    "we first consider the spectral functions at equilibrium , with no applied bias .",
    "figure [ fig : specdens_equi_offres ] shows @xmath73 for the off - resonant regime , and figure [ fig : specdens_equi_res ] shows the resonant transport regime .    in the equilibrium many - body language ,",
    "the features in the spectral functions obtained at positive energies ( @xmath103 , above the fermi level ) correspond to electron excitations , while the features at negative energies ( @xmath104 , below the fermi level ) correspond to hole excitations .       for the off - resonant ( a ) electron and ( b ) hole transport regime .",
    "calculations were performed with the fock - like electron - vibron  diagram ( solid line ) and with both the hartree and fock - like diagrams ( symbols and dotted line ) . for the electron transport regime",
    "the inclusion of the hartree self - energy has no effect , but for the hole transport regime it shifts the entire spectral function to lower energies .",
    "the parameters are @xmath105 for electron ( hole ) transport @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",

    "the inclusion of the hartree self - energy has no effect , but for the hole transport regime it shifts the entire spectral function to lower energies .",
    "the parameters are @xmath105 for electron ( hole ) transport @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]    for the off - resonant electron transport regime ( figure  [ fig : specdens_equi_offres](a ) ) all the features in the spectral function are above the fermi level @xmath108 and hence correspond to electron excitations .",
    "the main peak corresponds to adding an electron in the single available level .",
    "this peak is broadened by the coupling to the leads , and its position in energy @xmath109 is renormalised by the electron - vibron interaction , i.e. @xmath109 is close to the static the polaron shift @xmath110 .",
    "the lesser peaks in the electron - transport spectral function are vibron side - band peaks arising from resonance with @xmath111 excitations in the vibration mode .",
    "these peaks correspond to vibration excitation ( vibron emission ) only . at zero vibron temperature ,",
    "these are the only available mechanisms for vibrational excitations .",
    "we note , and discuss further in section [ sec : comp - with - inelastic - scattering - technique ] , that these side - band peaks should occur at integer multiples of @xmath112 away from the main peak , but that for both our fock - only and hartree - fock scba calculations the peak - peak separation is slightly wider than this .    in this regime ,",
    "the hartree self - energy is negligible , because most of the spectral weight is above the fermi level and @xmath113 .",
    "this implies that the polaron shift is mainly due to the fock - like self - energy .    for the off - resonant hole - transport regime ( figure  [ fig : specdens_equi_offres](b ) ) , all the features in the spectral function occur at @xmath114 and therefore correspond to hole excitations .",
    "the vibron side band peaks are at lower frequencies than the main peak because they correspond to the emission of vibrons by holes rather than electrons .",
    "when we include just the fock - like self - energy , the hole spectral function is symmetric ( with respect to the equilibrium fermi level @xmath108 ) with the electron spectral function , as can be seen clearly in figure  [ fig : specdens_equi_res ] .",
    "adding the hartree self - energy , however , breaks this electron - hole symmetry .",
    "as most of the spectral weight is below @xmath115 , the expression for @xmath116 given in equation eq.([eq : hartreeselfenergy ] ) reduces to a constant @xmath117 ( i.e. twice the polaron shift ) as @xmath118 . as a result of this the whole spectral function is shifted to the left by this amount .       for the resonant transport regime .",
    "calculations were performed with the fock - like ( solid line ) and with both the hartree and fock - like diagrams ( dashed line ) .",
    "the parameters are identical to those used in figure [ fig : specdens_equi_offres ] , except for the value of the electron level which is @xmath119 for the resonant regime.,width=302 ]    we now turn to the resonant transport regime , with the spectral function shown in figure [ fig : specdens_equi_res ] . here",
    "our electronic level @xmath99 is broadened by the coupling to the leads and is partially filled with electrons .",
    "we can see that calculations performed with only the fock - like self - energy preserve the electron - hole symmetry .",
    "the spectral function presents peaks located both at positive and negative energies , which correspond to the emission of vibrons by electrons or holes respectively . as in the previous section",
    ", the inclusion of the hartree self - energy ( equation  ) breaks down the electron - hole symmetry and the features are shifted to lower energies with a corresponding modification of the spectral weights for each peak .",
    "we note here that the inclusion of the hartree self - energy thus modifies so drastically the spectral function that it will also strongly affect the @xmath120-@xmath121 characteristics of the junction in comparison to calculations performed with only the fock self - energy .        in this section ,",
    "we present results for the spectral functions @xmath73 for the off - resonant transport regimes , for different applied biases , both with and without the hartree contribution .",
    "we first present calculations for an asymmetric potential drop with @xmath122 , i.e. @xmath123 and @xmath124 ( @xmath125 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : specdens_ne_offres_f](a ) shows the spectral function calculated with just the fock component at different applied biases .",
    "we then increase the bias @xmath121 by increasing the chemical potential of the left contact while keeping that of the right contact at zero .",
    "for low values of @xmath121 ( @xmath126 ) there is little change in the spectral function .",
    "however , once the value of @xmath121 exceeds that of @xmath112 , the spectral function becomes increasingly modified , especially when there is significant spectral weight inside the bias window @xmath127 . in particular , the lineshapes of both the main peak and the vibron side - band peaks become deformed , with a noticeable asymmetry of the main peak for biases where the main peak , but not the right - hand vibron side - band peak , lies within the bias window .",
    "there is a saturation regime once the vibron side band peaks , and thus nearly all of the spectral weight , is within the bias window ( curves for @xmath128 ) .",
    "here the main peak becomes pinned around @xmath129 ( effectively midway between @xmath130 and @xmath131 ) , and a symmetric lineshape is restored .",
    "we postulate that this is owing to the bias being large enough to achieve simultaneous electron and hole transport .",
    ".,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ] + .,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]    figure [ fig : specdens_ne_offres_f](b ) shows the spectral function with both the hartree and fock diagrams included .",
    "as we have already noted , at zero bias there is no change from the fock - only spectral function . for small biases ( @xmath132 )",
    "there is little difference , but for larger biases the effect of the fock diagram becomes increasingly evident .",
    "this is because once the bias exceeds the vibron frequency @xmath112 , the non - equilibrium electron density becomes strongly perturbed .",
    "the main peak is more stable in position than for the fock - only spectral function , although it shifts slightly towards lower energies with increasing bias before stabilising .",
    "the righthand vibron side - band peak becomes strongly deformed , and moves to lower , rather than higher , energies as the bias is increased .",
    "the left - hand vibron side - band peak appears at a lower bias than for the fock - only spectral function , at a frequency just above zero , then tends towards zero as the bias increases .",
    "as for the fock - only case however , once both vibron side - band peaks are within the bias window , saturation is reached and the peak positions stabilize .",
    "for both the fock - only and hartree - fock spectral functions , the separation between both side - band peaks and the main peak is @xmath133 for the parameters we used .",
    ".,width=302 ]    figure  [ fig : hartreepot_vs_v_offres ] shows the hartree potential ( i.e.  the real part of @xmath89 ) plotted against applied bias for different values of the electronic level @xmath99 .",
    "the solid line corresponds to the value of @xmath99 used to calculate the spectral functions of the lower panel in figure [ fig : specdens_ne_offres_f ] .",
    "the hartree potential is small and almost constant in the low bias region .",
    "hence , in the quasi - equilibrium regime , such a potential could be neglected in the calculations , because it simply corresponds to an energy reference shift . however when the bias window @xmath134 $ ] starts to encompass features in the spectral functions ( either the main peak or vibron side - band peaks ) , the corresponding non - equilibrium electron density starts to vary substantially with the applied bias .",
    "thus the hartree potential shows a strong dependence on the value of the bias ( as also shown in ref .  [ ] ) , until the saturation regime is reached and the hartree potential is once again constant for very large biases .",
    "the asymptotic saturation value of the hartree potential is dependent on the value of the electronic level @xmath99 as one would expect .",

    "the effects of the higher - order diagrams ( here second - order - dx and dph diagrams ) are explored in detail in the following sections .    additionally ,",
    "although mcist calculations are only valid in the off - resonant transport regime at and near equilibrium , they include all possible higher - order diagrams ( with bare vibron propagator ) and hence can be used as a reference for any perturbation - expansion - based negf calculations performed at equilibrium or in the quasi - equilibrium regime .      in this section ,",

    "these diagrams fall into two types  the double - exchange dx diagram , corresponding to vertex corrections , and the dressed vibron diagram , which includes a single electron - hole bubble , renormalizing the vibron propagator and hence giving rise to polarization effects .",
    "we have used three different levels of approximation to calculate these green s functions : firstly , calculations with no self - consistency  the green s functions are simply calculated using the diagrams in figure [ fig : fockhartree ] and figure [ fig : dx - dph ] using the bare propagator @xmath155 as the electron green s function . in our model , @xmath155 is the green s function of the central region connected to the leads with no electron - vibron  interactions .",

    "finally , we perform fully self - consistent calculations , in which the green s functions are calculated in a self - consistent manner with the first and second - order diagrams included within each iteration of the self - consistency loop .",

    "figure [ fig : specdens_eq_ofres_hfdxdph ] shows the spectral functions of the off - resonant transport regime at equilibrium , calculated for weak / intermediate electron - vibron  coupling ( @xmath161 ) and for different diagrams and levels of self - consistency .",
    "as already mentioned in sections [ sec : at - equilibrium ] and [ sec : noneq - specfns ] , the energy separation between the main peak and the first vibron side - band peak ( which should be equal to the vibron energy , here @xmath162 ) is not well reproduced by ba - based ( hartree - fock based ) calculations and is much larger than @xmath112 . the self - consistency introduced in the calculations give a marginally smaller energy separation .",
    "the effects of the second - order dx diagram are firstly to bring the vibron side - band peak closer to the main peak , hence giving an energy separation closer to the exact value ; and secondly , one observes a strong narrowing and a larger amplitude of the vibron side - band peak in both self - consistent and non - self - consistent calculations .",
    "both these effects thus qualitatively modify the spectral functions towards better agreement with the exact results as shown in section [ sec : comp - with - inelastic - scattering - technique ] .",
    "it is , however , worth mentioning that including the dx diagram in the calculation does not greatly affect the position of the main peak , a result which may be understood from the fact that the dynamical polaron shift is a quantity difficult to obtain exactly from a perturbation expansion theory beyond weak coupling @xcite .",

    "this might not be that surprising since the dph diagram corresponds to a fock - like diagram with a renormalised vibron propagator .",
    "the renormalization of the vibron is due to a single electron - hole bubble .",
    "however in the off - resonant transport regime , the spectral function is almost empty ( in the case of electron transport ) or almost full ( in the case of hole transport ) which implies that there are not many electron - hole excitations available in this transport regime . hence the polarization ( i.e. the contribution of the electron - hole bubble ) is very small , subsequently giving very small values for the dph self - energy . as an example , we have checked our numerical values in the case shown in figure  [ fig : specdens_eq_ofres_hfdxdph ] and we have found , as expected , that the maximum values of @xmath164 are 30 to 50 times smaller than the maximum values of @xmath165 .",
    "furthermore , in the off - resonant regime and for weak - ish electron - vibron  coupling , it seems that the fully self - consistent ( full sc ( ba+dx ) curve in figure  [ fig : specdens_eq_ofres_hfdxdph ] ) results @xmath166 are well approximated by the results given by a second - order correction to a self - consistent hartree - fock ( scba ) calculations ( scba+dx curve in figure  [ fig : specdens_eq_ofres_hfdxdph ] ) @xmath167\\ ] ^{-1}$ ] .",
    "this is an interesting result as it implies that the physical properties of the system , at least in these conditions , could be well described by a second - order correction of the lowest - order sc calculations , without the need to perform a fully self - consistent calculation up to the second - order .",
    "now we turn to the analysis of results obtained for stronger electron - vibron  coupling .",
    "examples of such calculations are given in figure  [ fig : specdens_eq_ofres__strg_hfdxdph ] for @xmath168 .",
    "in the strong electron - vibron  coupling regime , one obtains qualitatively the same contributions of the second - order diagrams as explained above for the weak coupling regime .",
    "the dph diagram does not have a large role in the off - resonant transport regime , although slightly affecting the width of the main peak . and the dx diagram shifts the vibron side - band peak towards the main peak ( and hence towards the exact results ) as well as narrowing the peak width and increasing the peak amplitude .",
    "these effects are amplified in figure  [ fig : specdens_eq_ofres__strg_hfdxdph ] because the electron - vibron  coupling constant @xmath32 is bigger than in figure  [ fig : specdens_eq_ofres_hfdxdph ] .",

    "the second - order diagrams have the following effects on the scba spectral functions : dph broadens the central and side - band peaks as well as lowers their height , in opposition to dx which narrows the peaks and brings the side - band peaks slightly closer to the center , with a strong and unphysical increase of the amplitude of the central peak .",
    "calculations with both dx and dph give in appearance a broadening of the central peak , which however recovers the correct height necessary to conserve the fermi - liquid property of the electron - hole symmetric system ( see section [ sec : linear_reponse ] for more detail ) .",

    "on one hand , the second - order dph diagram corresponds to a partial dressing of the vibron propagator by one electron - hole bubble .",
    "it gives an extra lifetime in the retarded / advanced electron green s functions in comparison to hartree - fock ( scba ) calculations .",
    "hence the main effect of the dph diagram is to introduce an extra broadening of the peaks in the spectral functions .",

    "the key difference for the electron - phonon interaction is that the vibron frequency @xmath112 imposes a restricted energy scale on the interaction , reducing the importance of the bubble diagrams , and correspondingly increasing the importance of the second - order exchange diagram .",

    "however before turning the discussion to the linear - response properties of the system at and near equilibrium , we would like to comment on a specific aspect of the effects of higher - order diagrams .    the narrowing of the vibron side - band peaks and of the main central peak due to higher - order ( dx ) diagrams was also obtained by other authors ( see for example ref .  [ ] ) . in this paper ,",
    "a different non - equilibrium approach was used .",
    "it consists of starting with an electron dressed by a vibron ( a polaron ) in the isolated central region , then using perturbation expansion theory ( with partial resummation ) in terms of the coupling of the central region to the non - equilibrium left and right leads .",
    "however , the results for the spectral functions in ref .",
    "[ ] were only given for the resonant transport regime at equilibrium and all calculations were performed without the hartree - like diagram . though we have already shown that such a diagram plays a crucial role in the spectral properties of the system in the resonant regime at and out of equilibrium .",

    ", we explain how to derive the linear conductance from the value of the spectral functions calculated at equilibrium .    in our model , there is a direct proportionality between the left and right leads self - energies @xmath178 because , the central region is coupled to the leads via the single hopping matrix element and we have chosen identical leads . then the current ( eq .  ( [ eq : expectation_value_current ] ) ) can be recast as follows ( for the details of the derivation , see for example refs . [ ] ) : @xmath179,\\ ] ] where @xmath180 and @xmath181 $ ] .",

[ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]     for the off - resonant regime at the weak electron - vibron  coupling , there are not many differences in the linear conductance @xmath185 values calculated for all the different diagrams , as one might expect from the spectral function behaviour shown in figure  [ fig : specdens_eq_ofres_hfdxdph ] .",
    "this is especially true when the main peak in the spectral function is located well away from the fermi level , i.e. @xmath188 linewidth of the peaks . for strong electron - vibron  coupling ,",
    "the differences between different levels of approximations are more pronounced .",
    "all @xmath185 values are smaller than the exact mcist result .",
    "this is essentially due to the fact that perturbation expansion gives only an approximate value of the polaron shift .",
    "the differences from the exact result are more important for scba - based calculations ( difference of @xmath189 with exact result ) and of course calculations performed up to second order give a better polaron shift and hence better values for the linear conductance ( @xmath190 difference only ) .    in the quasi - resonant case",
    "when @xmath191 ( 1 to 2 ) linewidth , the effects described above will be more pronounced , because the linear conductance is no longer given by the extreme tail of the main peak crossing the fermi level .    for the resonant case in the absence of the hartree potential , the scba - based calculations should give a perfect linear conductance .",
    "the reason why @xmath192 is because the calculations were performed with a tiny but finite value of @xmath193 as explained in detail in appendix  [ app : numericalbits ] .",
    "hence one may say that , for the chosen set of parameters , the value @xmath194 represents an upper bound for the linear conductance ( the corresponding numerical perfect conductance ) . and",
    "as explained in appendix  [ app : numericalbits ] , linear conductance values can only be compared between calculations performed with the same value of @xmath193 , which is what we have done .    the linear conductance is strongly renormalized ( decreased and increased ) when including only one of the two second - order diagrams ( dph and dx respectively ) .",
    "in contrast , it becomes close again to the expected quantum of conductance when the calculations are performed with both second - order diagrams .",
    "this dependence of the conductance is well understood from the behaviour of the spectral functions shown in figure [ fig : specdens_eq_res__intermed_hfdxdph ] .",
    "sc(ba+dph ) calculations introduce an extra broadening and a corresponding decrease of amplitude of the peaks in the spectral functions , hence a decrease of @xmath185 .",
    "however , the strong narrowing , with increased amplitude , of the peaks due to sc(ba+dx ) calculations leads to an increase of @xmath185 .",
    "the sc(ba+dx ) calculations give a linear conductance larger than that obtained from scba , i.e. @xmath195 , which is an unphysical result for our non - degenerate electronic level in the central part of the system .",
    "this implies a strong constraint on the validity of the values of @xmath185 obtained from a many - body perturbation expansion : in order to conserve the fermi - liquid properties ( see appendix  [ app : numericalbits ] ) in the electron - hole symmetric resonant regime , one has to perform the calculations by including all diagrams order by order .",
    "results obtained from partial resummation of a subset of diagrams will probably give an incorrect linear conductance .",
    "hence calculations performed by fully renormalizing the vibron propagators @xcite or all crossing diagrams @xcite , while containing diagrams higher than second order , will probably break important physical properties of the system at @xmath196 , because they lack important electronic processes , to second - order the dx vertex correction - like diagram or dph diagram respectivelly .    in the resonant ( or quasi - resonant ) regime ,",
    "polarisation effects and vertex corrections play an equally important role in the electronic structure and transport properties of electron - vibron  interacting nanojunctions which electron - hole symmetry .",
    "in this paper , we have presented a method based on negf to calculate the equilibrium and non - equilibrium electronic structure of electron - vibron  interacting single - molecule junctions .",
    "we have applied the method to a model system which consists of a single electronic level coupled to a single vibration mode in the central region , the latter in contact with two non - equilibrium electron reservoirs .    in comparison to previous studies performed within a similar approach @xcite , the novelty of our method lies in the fact that it goes beyond the conventionally - used self - consistent born approximation ( scba ) .",
    "higher - order diagrams for the electron - vibron  interacting have been implemented in our calculations .    in this paper",
    "we have considered the second - order diagrams which contain two - vibron processes : the so - called double exchange dx diagram which is part of the vertex corrections to scba , and the partially dressed dph diagram in which the vibron propagator is renormalized by one electron - hole bubble .",
    "we have studied the effects of the first and second - order diagrams on the spectral functions for a large set of parameters and for different transport regimes ( resonant and off - resonant cases ) at equilibrium and in the presence of a finite applied bias driving the system out of equilibrium .",
    "we have shown the important role played by the hartree diagram in calculations based only on first - order diagrams .",
    "such a diagram should not be neglected unless one works within an applied bias range for which the correspond hartree potential is constant .    for calculations including both first and second - order diagram we have found that the effects of the individual second - order diagram are as follows :",
    "the dx diagram reduces the width of the peaks in the spectral functions , with an increase of their height , while the dph has the opposite effect : it increases the width and decreases the height .",
    "furthermore , the dx diagram moves the vibron side - band peak position towards the main peak , and hence gives a better peak separation as should be obtained from exact calculations .",
    "calculations performed with both dx and dph diagram give intermediate results for the spectral functions , which are not simply an average / superposition of the individual effects because of the strong non - linearity involved in solving the problem self - consistently .",
    "furthermore , the effects of the second - order diagrams also depend on the transport regime : at and near equilibrium , the dx diagram dominates over the dph diagram in the off - resonant transport regime ( essentially because there are not many electron - hole excitations available in this regime ) . in the resonant case , however , both dx and dph play an equally important role . for large non - equilibrium conditions",
    "( @xmath197 ) , both second - order diagrams play an important role , since the corresponding spectral functions look qualitatively similar to those obtained the resonant regime .",
    "we have thus shown that it is indeed necessary to go beyond scba to obtain the correct results for a wide range of parameters .",
    "this has also been confirmed by comparing our negf results to an exact calculation in terms of electron - vibron  interacting ( the multi - channel inelastic scattering technique mcist @xcite ) , though it should be noted that comparison between negf and mcist calculations are only valid for the off - resonant transport regime .",
    "we have also studied in detail the effects of self - consistency on the calculations , especially for the cases including the second - order diagrams ( see section  [ sec:2ndorder_off_res_equi ] and figure  [ fig : specdens_eq_ofres__strg_hfdxdph ] ) .",
    "we have found a solution to an old problem , well known in many - body perturbation theory : in order to avoid negative spectral densities when including higher order diagrams in the calculations , it seems more appropriate to start the self - consistent loop with scba ( hartree - fock like ) electron  .",
    "finally , we have studied the linear response ( linear conductance @xmath185 ) of the nanojunctions , and have found that in the off - resonant regime , the value of @xmath185 is governed by the behaviour of the tail of the main peak at the fermi level , hence it depends on both the position and the width of this peak . in the off - resonant regime , the dph diagram contribution is negligible and the dx diagram gives a better polaron shift ( better position of the main peak ) and hence the second - order ( mostly dx ) calculation gives a better agreement for @xmath185 with the exact result . for the near - resonant regime , the contribution of dph will become more important and both dx and dph will play an important role in determining the value of @xmath185 by changing both the position and the width of the main peak .    for the resonant regime with electron - hole symmetry , it is necessary to perform the calculations by including both dx and dph diagrams in order to conserve the fermi - liquid properties of the system .",
    "we anticipate that this will be also true for higher - order diagrams and calculations need to be performed by including all diagrams of the same order .",
    "calculations performed with partial resummation of a subset of diagrams will break the expected fermi - liquid properties of the system and will probably lead to an incorrect value of the linear conductance .",
    "finally , we expect that the effects of the second - order diagrams , shown in this paper for the spectral functions only , are also important in the full non - equilibrium transport properties of the nanojunctions .",
    "the study of these effects on the non - linear conductance are currently undertaken and will be considered in a forthcoming paper .",

    "the hilbert transformation is actually a conventional convolution product of the trial function with an appropriate @xmath277-like kernel .",
    "calculation of convolution products can be made faster , instead of scaling as the square of the number of grid points , by the use of fft routines .",
    "however since fft routines introduce artifical periodic boundary conditions , and one has to make sure that the functions , which decay slowly as @xmath278 ( the kernel of the hilbert transform , and real part of @xmath36 ) , have sufficiently small values at the boundaries of the energy grid .",
    "otherwise , the corresponding discontinuities introduce spurious oscillations in the fft .",
    "this means that one has to work with a wide energy grid and with a correspondingly large number of grid points to keep a good enough resolution .",
    "working with a large number of grid points @xmath279 is not really a problem when calculating convolution products with fft , since the number of operations reduces from @xmath280 to @xmath281 , or even when without using fft routines .",
    "however , it is not possible to reduce the calculation of the second - order dx self - energy to some sort of convolution product , and the number of operations then scales as @xmath282 .",
    "such a scaling starts to make calculations seriously impractical when working with a large number of grid points .",
    "hence , we have adopted another stategy which consists of introducing , in the definition of @xmath269 , a tiny but finite imaginary part @xmath283 instead of taking the limit @xmath268 .",
    "this is just a natural step towards working with a fully dressed ( renormalized ) vibron propagator as already discussed in section [ app : dressing_d0 ] .    by using this tiny but finite imaginary part @xmath283",
    ", we avoid having to deal numerically with the dirac @xmath265-function and consequently with the hilbert transform and all the problems associated with the slowly decaying kernel .",
    "we can then work with a less wide energy grid and fewer points while keeping a good energy resolution .",
    "hence the calculations of the second order dx self - energy become more tractable .",
    "of course , there is a price to pay for that : there is a lowest bound for the possible values of @xmath193 , and this lowest bound is strongly linked to the value of the grid spacing . by trial and error ,",
    "we have found that @xmath193 must be at least equal to 2 or 3 times the grid spacing .",

    "<S> we study in detail the effects of the first- and second - order diagrams on the spectral functions for a large set of parameters and for different transport regimes ( resonant and off - resonant cases ) , both at equilibrium and in the presence of a finite applied bias . </S>",
    "<S> we also study the linear response ( linear conductance ) of the nanojunction for all the different regimes . </S>",
    "<S> we find that it is indeed necessary to go beyond the scba in order to obtain correct results for a wide range of parameters . </S>"
