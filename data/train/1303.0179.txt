    "typically , every second magnetic footpoint in the photosphere is connected to a swirl in the chromosphere above .",
    "in the photosphere , the plasma flows away from the granule interiors and towards the intergranular lanes , where the cooled plasma shoots back down into the convection zone ( see fig .",

    "a stationary magnetic tornado is generated when the magnetic field concentration is perfectly co - located with the vortex flow , resulting in the rotation of the entire magnetic structure .",

    "a magnetic field structure can be partially pushed into a vortex and out again , which results in a partial rotation of the magnetic field structure but not in a stationary tornado .",

    "swirls have been discovered as dark rings in the line core of the calcium infrared triplet line at a wavelength of 854.2 nm during an observation campaign at the swedish 1-m solar telescope ( sst ) @xcite in 2008 ( paper  ii ) .",
    "we refer to this observational imprint as the ca  line core signature ( clcs ) or ca  854  swirl hereafter .",
    "it is the only direct indicator of chromospheric swirls and magnetic tornadoes known so far .",
    "this is due to the fact that detecting swirls is a challenging task , which requires stable , high - quality image series with high spatial and temporal resolution for a purely chromospheric diagnostic . in this respect ,",
    "a narrow wavelength transmission range is crucial because the subtle swirl signature is only visible if the intensity signal is not contaminated by large contributions from the line wings , which are formed lower in the atmosphere .",
    "the crisp instrument @xcite at the sst offers this possibility , but even with this instrument , the observation of chromospheric swirls is still challenging .      in accordance with paper",
    "ii , we note that the swirl pattern can be seen as darkening in the caii854.2 nm line core at wavelengths down to @xmath6pm . the intensity at wavelengths further away from the line core originate from deeper down in the atmosphere , where the rotating magnetic structure has a smaller extent and is thus less clearly visible . there is a corresponding brightening with mostly the same pattern in the red line wing close to the line core , produced by the doppler shift within the swirl .",
    "based on these observations and supporting numerical simulations , we formulate the following conditions that need to be fulfilled for a chromospheric swirl :    1 .",

    "[ fig : types ] , width=385 ]      swirls can have different shapes in the ca line core images as already stated in paper  ii .",

    "a type  i swirl is not necessarily a closed ring but can consist of ring fragments , too .",
    "some simulation examples suggest that type  i swirls can evolve into type  ii as the circular flow pattern becomes increasingly elongated until the swirl signature fades away .",

    "it is possible to identify groups of magnetic field lines that rotate and/or sway together .",
    "these groups usually do not persist for long because the magnetic field is continuously rearranged on short time scales connected to the lifetime of granules and the resulting changes in the photospheric flow field .",
    "like other authors before ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we argue that the appearance of flux tubes is ( at least partially ) the product of the limited spatial resolution of the observations , resulting in apparently separated mbps",
    ". it would be more appropriate to talk of a continuous magneto - fluid in which the field lines at neighbouring locations exhibit similar dynamics , rather than to describe the magnetic field as individual , isolated flux tubes .",
    "the effect of limited spatial resolution is illustrated in fig .",

    "the strongest field concentrations appear as bright features in the continuum intensity ( panel  d ) , although the correlation between magnetic field strength and intensity is not strict .",
    "the corresponding magnetogram for the fei line at a wavelength of 630.2 nm is shown in panel  e. this magnetogram , i.e. , the stokes  v signal , is calculated with the full - stokes radiative transfer code nicole along vertical lines of sight .",
    "the stokes signal is formed over a height range in the atmosphere , whereas the magnetic field in panels  b and c refers to a single horizontal cross - section at the bottom of the photosphere only .",
    "the resulting magnetogram appears therefore more intermittent and less continuous than the magnetic field in the horizontal plane .",
    "next , the magnetogram is convolved with a point spread function that simulates the effect of a telescope with an aperture of 50 cm , which is equivalent to the solar optical telescope ( sot , * ? ?",

    "the resulting degraded magnetogram is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : magnetogram]f .",
    "it should be noted that this degradation is optimistic . in practice , the derivation of the stokes components from measurements with limited spatial , temporal , and spectral resolution would result in magnetograms that are even more diffuse and less reliable than the synthetic example presented here . nevertheless , the effect of the limited spatial resolution is obvious",
    ". only individual blobs of enhanced stokes  v signal remain instead of the continuous magnetic flux sheet in the original model atmosphere . when observed , these blobs would be identified as mbps .",
    "the most prominent mbp is outlined with a red - white dashed contour in fig .  [ fig : magnetogram ] .",
    "most of the remaining magnetic field ( blue - yellow contours ) would remain undetected .",
    "in particular , the thin magnetic flux sheets in the intergranular lanes are barely visible . in view of this effect ,",
    "the questions arises how uniquely a mbp can be identified . during an observation run",
    ", a mbp can be tracked from its first appearance until its disappearance as long as it remains sufficiently separated from other mbps .",
    "in that case a lifetime can be determined . however , the numerical simulations suggest that the magnetic field is continously reorganised .",
    "some of the magnetic field , which would be observed as part of the mbp , may be advected into a neighbouring sheet and , in return , additional field may be advected into the mbp .",
    "these changes would remain undetected , whereas the same mbp appears to persist .",
    "the lifetimes of observed mbps are consistent with the timescales on which the granulation pattern evolves but the magnetic field ( incl .",
    "individual mbps ) can nevertheless last beyond the lifetime of the surrounding granules .",
    "the primary way to detect a chromospheric swirl and thus a magnetic tornado is the caii854.2 nm line core signature ( clcs ) so far , which requires a narrow filter transmission range .",
    "these requirements make it challenging to observe chromospheric swirls and , to our knowledge , only crisp / sst observations have repeatedly produced successful swirl detections so far .",
    "ultimately , more observations , preferably with a variety of instruments , are needed in order to gather a statistically significant sample that allows for a detailed characterization of magnetic tornadoes , including their occurrence , distribution of sizes and lifetimes and the related energy transport rates .",
    "these small - scale events represent a challenging test for the next generation of solar telescopes like atst @xcite and est @xcite .",
    "high spatial resolution is not only important for the observations but also for the numerical simulations .",
    "the successful modelling of magnetic tornadoes requires the sufficient resolution of the narrow intergranular lanes , where photospheric vortex flows and magnetic fields coalesce .                                  ,",
