    "in the popular sanders & mirabel picture for quasar evolution ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , gas - rich major mergers between galaxies trigger intense starbursts in ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) and channel ample fuel into the nuclear region to feed the black hole ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the black hole ( bh ) growth is initially buried in dust until some feedback process ( either stellar - driven or quasar - driven ) blows the dust away and a classical quasar emerges .",
    "the major merger event also transforms the host morphology from disks to a spheroid ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "although such a violent route is not required for triggering low - to - intermediate luminosity active galactic nucleus ( agn ) activity , this merger - based framework seems successful in reproducing an array of observations of luminous quasars and massive red ellipticals in the cosmological context ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "a useful tool to probe the physical conditions and dynamical processes within quasar hosts is intrinsic quasar absorption lines .",
    "historically most of the focus has been on broad absorption lines ( bals , usually defined as absorption troughs broader than @xmath8 ) , which are undoubtedly intrinsic to the quasar .",
    "here we focus on another class of narrow absorption lines called associated absorption lines ( aals ) , whose absorption velocity is close to the systemic velocity of the background quasar ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "aals are traditionally defined as narrow absorption troughs ( @xmath10 ) with a velocity offset @xmath0 within @xmath11 of the systemic redshift of the quasar . to define aals .",
    "this is partly due to the fact that the systemic redshift for many high - redshift quasars is based on the centroid of broad emission lines such as civ , which has a larger uncertainty compared with the systemic redshift determined from  or narrow emission lines . ]",
    "strong ( @xmath12 ) low - ionization  associated absorbers are present in a few percent of the entire quasar population ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the final composite spectrum was generated by taking the median ( or geometric mean ) flux density in each bin of the shifted , rebinned , and scaled spectra .",
    "an error spectrum was generated from the 68% semi - interquantile range of the flux densities in each bin scaled by @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the number of spectra contributing to that bin .",

    "composite spectra for the above quasar samples .",
    "aal quasars have colors lying between normal quasars and the so - called `` dust - reddened '' quasars in sdss ( with color excess is a good indicator of intrinsic quasar colors which accounts for the band shifting with redshift ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the `` redshifted '' and `` blueshifted '' samples show a prominent excess of narrow [ oii ]  emission , which is absent in the case of the `` intervening - like '' sample .",
    "the lack of [ oii ]  emission excess , the similar amount of reddening to classical intervening absorption systems ( e.g. , york et al .",
    "2006 ) , and the fact that they join the plateau of the velocity distribution ( e.g. , fig.[fig : vdist ] ) , suggest that aals with @xmath45 are in fact mostly classical intervening absorbers  aals , and may not hold true for the high-@xmath58 and high - ionization aals ( such as civ ) . ] .",
    "we note that the large - scale fluctuations seen in the composite ratios are due to correlated noise arising from variance in the shape of quasar continua .",
    "the correlation between the presence of absorbers with @xmath59 kms@xmath60 and [ oii ]  emission is of great interest .",
    "while the composite  absorption lines are , by construction , offset by hundreds of @xmath61 with respect to the quasars , the stacked excess [ oii ]  emission is found more or less at the quasar systemic velocity ( see below ) .",
    "_ thus the excess [ oii ]  emission originates from material lying at the quasar systemic velocity_. the central engine , i.e. , the black hole radiation , appears to be similar in aal quasars and in normal quasars : other than the reddening and  absorption , no difference is seen in the continuum and broad emission lines between the two quasar populations .",
    "this suggests that dust - reddening is the explanation for the color difference seen in aal quasars and normal quasars .",
    "one might ask if this dust reddening might also cause the apparent [ oii ]  excess seen in the flux ratio plot in fig .  [",
    "fig : composite ] .",
    "dust reddening could occur on spatial scales much smaller than the [ oii ]  emission region but much larger than the continuum plus broad line region . in this case",
    "the continuum is attenuated while the [ oii ]  emission is not , causing an apparent enhancement of [ oii ]  strength relative to the underlying continuum .",
    "assuming an smc - like extinction curve , we require @xmath62 to achieve the level of [ oii ]  emission enhancement relative to the continuum , substantially larger than the inferred @xmath57 from the composite spectra .    we now focus on the [ oii ]  emission excess .",
    "to quantify it and estimate its significance , we create continuum - subtracted median composites around the [ oii ]  emission line .",
    "this is done by subtracting a running median filter with a width of 20 pixels and by masking the region @xmath63",
    "  to preserve the emission line . within this region the continuum estimate is interpolated .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : line_composite ] . the centroid of the excess [ oii ]  emission is within @xmath64 from the systemic velocity ( fig .",
    "[ fig : line_composite ] ) . considering the typical redshift uncertainties of individual objects used in the stacking",
    "this is consistent with the systemic velocity .",
    "we measure the line flux by integrating the flux density over the emission line profile .",
    "the line flux error is estimated by bootstrapping the sample of reference quasars and repeating the procedure 100 times .",
    "this allows us to include sample variance in the error estimation .",
    "the [ oii ]  excess is detected at 8@xmath31 ( 7@xmath31 ) for the blueshifted ( redshifted ) sample , corresponding to an enhancement of @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) of the line flux of the control quasars .",
    "the enhancement increases to @xmath67 ( @xmath68 if we use mean composites . for comparison",
    ", we measure the properties of the [ nev]@xmath323346,3426 , which is entirely excited by agn given its high ionization potential . we follow the same procedure and the results are presented in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : line_composite ] . in this case",
    ", we do not observe any significant excess in the [ nev]@xmath323346,3426 .",
    "therefore the agn ionizing source of aal quasars is similar to that of normal quasars , and we conclude that the excess [ oii ]  emission is due to different host properties .",
    "interestingly , no [ oii]excess is seen in the composite spectrum of @xmath69 quasars with broad  absorption lines selected from sdss @xcite , which is expected if broad absorption lines ( bals ) are ubiquitous among quasars and the appearance of balqsos only depends on los .",
    "this difference reinforces our conclusion that the hosts of aal quasars are intrinsically different .",
    "the distinct host properties of aal quasars in terms of excess [ oii ]  emission ( with absorber @xmath7 ) suggest that a significant fraction of these associated absorbers must be physically associated with the quasar and its host , and are not from disconnected external galaxies . because the properties of the active smbh are similar for aal quasars and for normal quasars",
    ", we expect that the amount of [ oii ]  emission contributed by the quasar itself should be similar as well .",
    "we thus interpret the excess [ oii ]  emission as due to enhanced star formation within the aal quasar host galaxy , as [ oii ]  is a good indicator of star formation rate in regions with low ionization parameters , and has been applied for quasar hosts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) after subtracting the [ oii ]  contribution from the quasar itself .",
    "interestingly , @xcite showed a similar connection between  absorbers and star formation in intervening galaxy absorbers .",
    "the measured excess of [ oii ]  luminosity of the aal quasar hosts is found to be @xmath70 and @xmath71 for the blueshifted and redshifted samples respectively . following @xcite ,",
    "we convert these values to star formation rates using the average scaling coefficient for galaxies with @xmath72 given by @xcite .",
    "we then find aal quasar hosts to have a median excess star formation rate of @xmath737 ( 5 ) @xmath74 yr@xmath60 for the blueshifted ( redshifted ) sample .    a less likely interpretation for the [ oii ]  excess would invoke different ism conditions or element abundance for aal quasar hosts . either way",
    ", our results show that aal quasars represent a distinct population and may indicate a special evolutionary phase",
    ". the clear absence of [ oii ]  emission at the redshift of the associated absorbers in the composite spectra disfavors major mergers ( in which case enhanced star formation for the companion would also have been seen ) .",
    "our results thus imply that associated  absorbers could either be minor mergers , or galactic to halo - scale gas outflows and infall associated with the quasar host galaxy .",
    "we still expect some aals from the clustering of galaxies around quasars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "quantifying their contribution requires better knowledge on the strength of the galaxy - quasar cross - correlation function and pairwise velocity dispersion ( for the specific type of absorbers ) , as well as the size of the quasar proximity zone ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and is beyond the scope of this paper .    a number of studies have revealed that dust - reddened quasars have different properties from classical quasars : heavily reddened ( with @xmath75 ) type 1 quasars , selected in the near infrared and radio , usually show strong [ oii ]  emission ( e.g. , glikman et al .  2007 ) .",
    "in addition , these systems display a large fraction ( approaching unity ) of disturbed morphologies and interaction ( e.g. , urrutia et al .",
    "dust reddened quasars from the sdss ( with @xmath76 ) also show an excess of [ oii ]  emission compared to classical quasars ( richards et al .",
    "this is in line with the sanders & mirabel picture that dust - reddened quasars are in the early stage of evolution after the merger and have higher star formation rate and more dust obscuration in the nuclei .",
    "it is interesting to note that the reddest quasars also show a higher occurrence of associated absorbers than normal quasars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but the bulk of aal quasars have much bluer colors ( fig .  3 ) .",
    "aal quasars thus have properties intermediate between dust - reddened and classical quasars , in terms of both [ oii ]  emission and dust reddening .",
    "these findings are consistent with aal quasars being more evolved than the dust - reddened quasars following a gas - rich merger .",
    "the obscuring material in the immediate circumnuclear region has largely been dispersed , but the host star formation rate is still higher than normal quasars .",
    "alternatively , aal quasars could be similar to dust - reddened quasars , but are seen along a less obscured line of sight . in either scenario ,",
    "we expect aal quasars to show a higher fraction of less - developed bulges , disturbed morphologies and interactions than classical quasars .",
    "an archival search in the _ hst _ database resulted in three aal quasars in our sample that have deep ( @xmath77min ) imaging data at @xmath78 , all observed in serendipitous programs and the data is publicly available .",
    "two of them , sdssj085215.65@xmath18492040.8 and sdssj130952.89@xmath18011950.6 , were observed with wfc3-ir ( @xmath79 min and @xmath80 min ) and wfc3-uvis ( @xmath81 min and @xmath82 min ) .",
    "the third object , sdssj093210.96@xmath18433813.1 , was observed with wfc3-ir with a total exposure time of @xmath83min . in fig.[fig : examp ] we show the retrieved wfc3-ir images for these three objects , and their sdss spectra around the  region .",
    "j0932 and j1309 show clear tidal features and disturbed host morphologies even before subtraction of the quasar light , while j0852 appears to be in a small interacting group where the immediate neighbor to the lower - right has a sdss photometric redshift consistent with the quasar redshift .",

    "( 2007 ) reported a serendipitously discovered aal system in the gravitationally lensed quasar rxs j1131 - 1231 , which also shows evidence of interactions and disturbed morphology in the reconstructed host image @xcite .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and is more in line with the results for heavily dust - reddened quasars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "we defer a detailed analysis of the _ hst _ data and follow - up studies of these systems to future work .",
    "even though our results suggest an intrinsic origin for the bulk of the aals , this is a statistical statement and there are still cases where the aals are of external origins .",
    "moreover , the nature of these intrinsic aals is still unknown .",
    "nevertheless , they provide a unique window to probe the physical conditions and dynamical processes during the evolution of quasars and their massive hosts , and deserve in - depth studies , either in a statistical manner or for individual systems .",
    "more than half of these associated absorbers show blueshifted velocity , among which some could be feedback ( either stellar- or quasar - driven ) at work , and possibly leading to a suppression of the host star formation .",
    "the typical velocity of these absorbers ( i.e. , a few hundred @xmath1 ) is much smaller than those seen in bals and intrinsic high velocity narrow absorption lines ( nals ) , hence these aal absorbers are likely to be on scales much larger than nuclear scales , and thus are more likely to impact the host galaxy .",
    "gravitational inflows may also be present during the early stage of quasar and host formation , either in the form of accreted gas or as part of an infalling galaxy companion .",
    "while intrinsic absorbers with infalling velocities greater than several hundred @xmath1 are likely to be in the vicinity of the bh , the nature of the more slowly moving absorbers needs to be explored .",
    "in particular , infalling absorbers are expected in galaxy formation models ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) but almost never seen in galaxy spectra ( steidel et al .",
