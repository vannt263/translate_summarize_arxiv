    "however , in sufficiently dense lateral cnt , different cnts interact with each other and , as a result , the plasma oscillations excited by the thz radiation can be associated with the _ collective coherent _ motion of the carriers belonging to many cnt responding to the ac _ self - consistent _ electric fields .",
    "this collective motion reveals the 2d - nature of the response , especially pronounced when the plasma wavelength markedly exceeds the average distance between the cnts .    in this paper , in contrast to the previous works focused on the dilute cnt systems ( including the composite materials with randomly dispersed , randomly oriented cnts )",

    "the calculation of the bolometric contribution to the responsivity under the conditions of the plasmonic effects , requires a more complex model than that used above .",
    "the spatial distribution of the effective hole temperature might be essentially nonuniform due to the nonuniform spatial distribution of the ac electric field ( which heats the dhg in the cnt network under consideration ) and due to thermal flows from the cnt network toward the contacts .",
    "therefore , the equations of more strict device model should be supplemented by the heat conductivity equation and related boundary conditions accounting for the contact properties .",

    "below we estimate the bolometric contribution to the responsivity using a fairly simple model .    assuming that ( 1 ) the variation of the current due to the hole heating is associated primarily with the variation of the schottky contact electrical conductivity ( due to higher thermal conductivity of the ohmic contact and , hence , smaller temperature gradient near the latter ) , ( 2 ) the variation of the effective hole temperature near the schottky contact is close to that averaged over the entirely cnt network and the plasmonic oscillation period @xmath358 , and ( 3 ) only the s - cnts contribute to the effect in question . in such a situation , the expression for the density of the rectified current given by eqs .

    "<S> * keywords : * carbon nanotube network , schottky contact , two - dimensional carrier system , terahertz radiation , plasmonic resonance we consider the carrier transport and plasmonic phenomena in the lateral carbon nanotube ( cnt ) networks forming the device channel with asymmetric electrodes . </S>",
    "<S> one electrode is the ohmic contact to the cnt network and the another contact is the schottky contact . </S>",
    "<S> these structures can serve as detectors of the terahertz ( thz ) radiation . </S>",
    "<S> we develop the device model for response of the lateral cnt networks which comprise a mixture of randomly oriented semiconductor cnts ( s - cnts ) and quasi - metal cnts ( m - cnts ) . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed model includes the concept of the two - dimensional plasmons in relatively dense networks of randomly oriented cnts ( cnt `` felt '' ) and predicts the detector responsivity spectral characteristics . </S>",
    "<S> the detection mechanism is the rectification of the ac current due the nonlinearity of the schottky contact current - voltage characteristics under the conditions of a strong enhancement of the potential drop at this contact associated with the plasmon excitation . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the excitation of the two - dimensional plasmons by incoming thz radiation the detector responsivity can induce sharp resonant peaks of the detector responsivity at the signal frequencies corresponding to the plasmonic resonances . </S>",
    "<S> the detector responsivity depends on the fractions of the s- and m - cnts . </S>",
    "<S> the burning of the near - contact regions of the m - cnts or destruction of these cnts leads to a marked increase in the responsivity in agreement with our experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> the resonant thz detectors with sufficiently dense lateral cnt networks can compete and surpass other thz detectors using plasmonic effects at room temperatures . </S>"
