    "inspired by the biological observation of microorganisms , self - propulsion has widely been studied as the motion of microswimmers through their viscous fluid environment .",
    "different models were suggested and analyzed for this kind of self - propulsion in the low reynolds number limit .",
    "examples are active rods propagating planar or spiral waves along their body @xcite , purcell s swimmer that consists of three bars connected by two joints @xcite , a model swimmer of three linked spheres @xcite , or helical filaments that propagate kinks between regions of opposite handedness through their body @xcite .",
    "apart from the propulsion mechanism of single isolated objects , their collective behavior under hydrodynamic coupling has been moved into the focus of recent investigations .",
    "for example , hydrodynamic continuum equations have been derived by coarse - graining the particle picture of interacting microswimmers @xcite . in this case , orientational order parameters follow from locally averaging the single particle velocities .",
    "the mode structure and hydrodynamic instabilities of the corresponding continuum equations were analyzed @xcite . here , we can identify the thresholds at which orientationally non - ordered states become unstable with the onset of collective motion .",
    "aspects of synchronization of active particle motion mediated by hydrodynamic interactions have been studied in detail @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a recent work incorporates the effect of an axial macroscopic dynamic variable into the hydrodynamic framework @xcite .",
    "such a macroscopic non - equilibrium variable may appear , for example , in the case of collectively rotating helical filaments .    in this paper",
    ", we will restrict ourselves to collective two - dimensional motion of self - propelled particles on a substrate .",
    "therefore , no long - range hydrodynamic interactions are taken into account .",
    "such a system was used , for example , to study the motion of deformable self - propelled particles and domains @xcite . there",
    ", the velocity of each particle was determined through coupling to its deformation ( and vice versa ) . in contrary , in simpler models , a constant driving force is directly added to the momentum equation for each particle @xcite .",
    "it balances the friction forces acting on the particle .",
    "the driving force is oriented , for example , along the long axis of rod - like particles @xcite .",
    "shape dependent short - range interactions as , e.g. , excluded volume interactions can lead to alignment and thus collective motion . again",
    ", macroscopic equations were derived and investigated for these cases @xcite .",
    "when we are only interested in the basic mechanism that leads to collective motion , we only keep the basic necessary features in a minimal model .",
    "then the velocity magnitude for each particle can simply be kept fixed as a constant in time @xcite .",
    "only the position and the angle characterizing its direction of motion are maintained as variables for each particle .",
    "for such a system , we can define local alignment rules for the velocity vectors of two interacting particles @xcite . since momentum exchange with the substrate is possible",
    ", the total momentum of the interacting particles does not need to be conserved .",
    "such approaches can be seen as variants of the model introduced by vicsek et al .",
    "@xcite and were extensively studied numerically .",
    "both , polar @xcite and nematic @xcite alignment rules were investigated . in the first case , velocity vectors in the ordered state point into the same direction , whereas in the second case antiparallel alignment of velocity vectors is equally allowed .",
    "the focus was on the transition from disordered to collective , i.e.  macroscopically ordered , motion .",
    "this transition occurs with decreasing orientational noise or increasing particle density and was found to be discontinuous for sufficiently large system sizes @xcite .",
    "an interesting issue was the emergence of spatial heterogeneities above ( but close to ) threshold @xcite .",
    "more precisely , flocks and stripes of high particle density and orientational order were observed .",
    "they could move with velocity magnitudes close to the single particle speed .",
    "apart from that , hydrodynamic continuum equations were derived from alignment rules through a boltzmann approach @xcite .",
    "furthermore , continuum equations of the fokker - planck type were obtained using the mean field approximation @xcite .",
    "the features listed above could be reproduced in numerical investigations of macroscopic continuum equations @xcite .",
    "we will follow in this paper the outlined minimal model approach .",
    "the system that we will study is a binary mixture of self - propelled particles .",
    "previously , systems of different self - propelled particles were analyzed in predator - prey scenarios @xcite . in the current work , however , we focus on the effect of alignment interactions between different particle species . more precisely , we concentrate on the onset and features of collective motion that result from the interaction between two different groups of particles . therefore",
    ", in our analysis , the main parameter of interest will be the orientational coupling parameter between particles of different species .    in the next section ,",
    "we introduce in detail our minimal model of binary self - propelled particle mixtures on the particle level . from these ,",
    "we derive mean field equations in the spirit of the fokker - planck approach .",
    "after that , in section [ linstabanal ] , these equations are checked for linear instabilities of orientational order as a function of the averaged particle densities .",
    "we study the cases of polar and antiparallel alignment of the velocity vectors as well as a preferred perpendicular alignment .",
    "these cases were further investigated by particle simulations , the results of which are presented in section [ particleperp ] . after that , we compare to numerical results obtained from the fokker - planck approach in section [ numfp ] .",
    "finally , we derive macroscopic continuum equations in section [ macroscopic ] and discuss the stability of their solutions , before we conclude .",

    "@xcite for the single - particle case ) . the orientational order between the particles",
    "is adjusted through local pairwise interactions .",
    "polar orientational order is preferred for particles of the same species . for particles of different species",
    ", we have investigated the cases of preferred polar , nematic , and perpendicular alignment interactions .",
    "we started from the langevin equations in the particle picture . from these , we derived mean field continuum equations of the fokker - planck type .",
    "the onset of collective motion and the nature of corresponding solutions in the binary self - propelled particle mixtures were studied through a linear stability analysis and numerical investigations of the particle and continuum equations .",
    "furthermore , we derived macroscopic continuum equations and analyzed corresponding stability ranges .",
    "it turned out that the interaction between the two species can reduce the threshold densities for the onset of collective motion to values below the ones for the single - species case .",
    "if one of the two species has a density above this threshold , it moves collectively and can induce collective motion also in the other species even if the latter has a density below the single - species threshold . in the case that both densities are below the single - species threshold , interaction between particles of different species can nevertheless induce collective motion within each species for all three alignment rules investigated .",
    "above , but close to the onset of collective motion , spatial heterogeneities in the form of stripe - like flocks emerge in the density profiles . in the most interesting case ,",
    "one of the species densities is above the single - species threshold and the other is below .",
    "then the first species develops collective motion and spatial heterogeneities . where its density is high , it can induce collective motion in the second species . depending on the alignment rules between different species ,",
    "this can lead to identical or inverted density maps for the two species .",
    "increasing the coupling strength between the two species dissolves the spatial inhomogeneities .    for the case of preferred perpendicular alignment",
    ", we find a competition between polar and truly nematic order as a function of the strength of orientational coupling between the two species .",
    "this competition also influences the development of the spatial inhomogeneities .",
    "when we are looking for the connection of our study to the experimental investigation of real systems , we have to keep in mind that our results were obtained for two spatial dimensions .",
    "we should therefore confine ourselves to at least quasi two dimensional systems .",
    "candidates for the latter are thin films of motile bacteria colonies ( monolayers in the ideal case ) at air - water surfaces or on substrates . for such cultures formed by _",
    "bacillus subtilis _ it has been shown that only a fraction of the cells is motile , the other cells are non - motile @xcite .",
    "the size of this fraction is controlled by the genetic location of the gene responsible for the production of a certain protein @xcite . in our model system",
    ", this situation corresponds to the limiting case in which both species are formed by the same bacterium , one of the species featuring zero motility , the other propelling with non - zero velocity .    natural systems in which the latter situation is often observed are bacterial biofilms .",
    "these are communities of microorganisms attached to surfaces .",
    "also biofilms of _ bacillus subtilis _ were demonstrated to feature cellular differentiation so that only part of the cells are motile @xcite . during the biofilm development ,",
    "a fraction of the initially motile cells starts to take over a different task and forms non - motile sub - communities @xcite .",
    "although biofilms are typically extended on a surface , their thickness can not be neglected and can even feature a spatial organization in different layers @xcite . however",
    ", very thin films can be produced for example by letting a biofilm of motile bacteria grow in upstream direction in flow cells @xcite .    despite their abundance in nature and their much higher clinical relevance ,",
    "multi - species biofilms have only recently been moved into the focus of investigation @xcite . in this case",
    ", different species within the biofilm can interact via quorum sensing and metabolic cooperation or competition .",
    "depending on synergistic or antagonistic interactions between motile bacterial species , different rules of alignment may result when their swarming behavior is investigated .",
    "one step into this direction was performed by a study on a community of two different species of motile bacteria , in which the authors also focus on the role of motility on species interactions within a biofilm @xcite .",
    "an aspect that has not been addressed in our work by the mean field approach is the nature and role of density fluctuations . for the case of a single particle species",
    "it has been demonstrated that large fluctuations in the density can occur @xcite .",
    "these have been termed giant number fluctuations in the context of nematic particle interactions @xcite .",
    "questions that arise are , for example , how the nature of these fluctuations changes in the case of binary mixtures of self - propelled particles , whether and how the two particle species interact through density fluctuations , and how the situation changes when different alignment rules apply .",
    "another issue concerns the macroscopic equations derived in the last section .",
    "as discussed , these are stable only for small and moderate particle densities . on the one hand",
    ", it will be interesting to find closure relations that stabilize these equations also for higher densities , even if the deviations from the initial equations increase .",
    "on the other hand , the non - equilibrium generalization of other transformations from particle to field descriptions that are suitable in the high - density limit is a compelling task for the future .    in conclusion , here , as a first step , we have shown numerical results for the simplest case where the particles of different species feature the same behavior .",
    "that is , single particles of different species propel with the same velocity , show the same orientational diffusion , and follow the same orientational ordering rules .",
    "rich behavior is to be expected when these confining conditions are weakened .",
    "investigations for particle species of different velocities and different magnitudes of orientational diffusion are currently underway .",
