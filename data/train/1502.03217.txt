    "* determination of the dominant exchange interactions and the @xmath7 . * in order to understand the apparently significantly different properties of the two isostructural compounds , cumno@xmath1  and @xmath0-namno@xmath1 , a proper determination of the dominant terms in the hamiltonian is crucial . therefore , we applied numerical finite - temperature lanczos method ( ftlm ) simulations and density - functional theory ( dft ) calculations .",
    "the former were aimed at quantifying the two main magnetic exchange interactions ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) of the isotropic heisenberg model on the spatially anisotropic two - dimensional ( 2d ) triangular lattice ( inset in figure  [ fig3]a ) , @xmath16}{\\bf s}_k \\cdot { \\bf s}_l .",
    "\\label{eq4}\\ ] ] here , the first sum runs over the ( stronger ) intrachain bonds in one direction , while the second sum runs over the ( weaker ) interchain bonds in the other two directions on the triangular lattice of spins @xmath17 .",
    "the temperature - dependent magnetic susceptibility @xmath18 of this model was calculated for various @xmath19 spin clusters ( see methods ) . however , even for the largest reachable cluster sizes ( @xmath20 ) , some finite - size effects remain present at low @xmath21 . with the use of results from many clusters ( @xmath22 ) these effects can , however , be reduced and the value of @xmath23 at the thermodynamic limit is thus approached . both , the average susceptibility curve from the two largest - size clusters ( that gives a better approximation than the individual clusters ; see methods ) and the susceptibility curve obtained in an approach similar to finite - size scaling ( see methods ) fit the experimental data above the @xmath7 very well ( figure  [ fig3]a ) .",
    "a disagreement with the experimental data below the @xmath7 , on the other hand , is expected , because the 2d heisenberg model can not account for a finite @xmath7 .",
    "both approaches yield very similar exchange - coupling constants , which we estimate to be @xmath24  k and @xmath25 .",
    "these are in very good agreement with recent _ ab - initio _",
    "predictions @xcite , @xmath26  k and @xmath27 , which , in principle , could be erroneous due to the unknown on - site repulsion @xcite .",
    "our calculations thus confirm that the exchange interactions are indeed reduced for cumno@xmath1  compared to @xmath0-namno@xmath1 , where @xcite @xmath28  k and @xmath29 . despite this fact , in cumno@xmath1  the @xmath7",
    "is increased with respect to that found in @xmath0-namno@xmath1  by more than 40% .",
    "so far , this has been attributed to a difference in the interlayer coupling @xcite @xmath30 , which , however , is rather small @xcite and can , therefore , only slightly affect the @xmath7 on 2d heisenberg lattices @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the amount of frustration reflected in the @xmath31 ratio should directly influence the @xmath7 , as the frustration is known to suppress the spin correlations @xcite . in @xmath0-namno@xmath1  and cumno@xmath1  the intrachain exchange coupling is dominant .",
    "therefore , these compounds can be regarded as systems of coupled spin chains , which is manifested in the one - dimensional character of the magnetic excitations in @xmath0-namno@xmath1 @xcite . for such systems",
    "the @xmath7 can be determined with the use of a random - phase approximation @xcite . in this approach",
    "the interchain coupling is treated at the mean - field level , whereas the intrachain interactions are treated exactly . for isotropic interchain coupling in a non - frustrated lattice",
    "the @xmath7 is determined by the condition@xcite @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the chain s staggered susceptibility . within this approach ,",
    "we generalize the above condition for @xmath7 to include the two interchain constants ( @xmath34 ) pertinent to the triclinic phase of cumno@xmath1  and @xmath0-namno@xmath1 , as well as the interlayer coupling @xmath30 ; @xmath35}. \\label{eq5}\\ ] ] here , @xmath36 corresponds to the number of neighbouring coupled chains and planes , respectively , while @xmath37 adopts the minus sign because it frustrates the afm order dictated by the larger @xmath38 .",
    "the constant @xmath39 renormalizes the coordination numbers and is reduced from unity @xcite because of quantum effects @xcite . as @xmath40 and 0.035 in cumno@xmath1  and @xmath0-namno@xmath1 , respectively @xcite , while @xmath41 is expected to be an order of magnitude smaller @xcite , we estimate the @xmath7 by neglecting @xmath30 in equation  ( [ eq5 ] ) and by taking @xmath42 , which is appropriate for quasi - one dimensional cases ( see fig .  2 in ref .  ) .",
    "this gives @xmath43  k in cumno@xmath1  and @xmath44  k in @xmath0-namno@xmath1  ( see figure  [ fig3]b ) , which are in good agreement with the experimental values of 65  k and 45  k , respectively .",
    "we note that for anisotropic interchain couplings the constant @xmath39 is expected to be further reduced and , ultimately , for @xcite @xmath45 also @xmath46 , leading to @xmath47 , which is consistent with the mermin - wagner theorem ( no long - range order in the 2d heisenberg model at finite @xmath21 ) .",
    "however , it has been shown @xcite that for quasi-2d systems the dependence of the @xmath7 and , in turn also of @xmath39 , on @xmath30 is sub - logarithmic .",
    "therefore , for the exchange - coupling constants related to cumno@xmath1  and @xmath0-namno@xmath1 , @xmath39 will be somewhat , but not drastically , reduced from the value @xmath48 , which is perfectly in line with the small theoretical overestimates of the @xmath7 .",
    "this analysis reveals that the nel transition is predominantly determined by the heisenberg hamiltonian of equation  ( [ eq4 ] ) .",
    "moreover , the ferrodistortive structural transition accompanying the magnetic ordering and leading to the splitting of the two interchain exchange constants ( @xmath49 , @xmath50 ) in the triclinic phase is needed to ensure a finite @xmath7 .",
    "the extent to which frustration is relieved in the triclinic phase of the cumno@xmath1  elevates its ordering temperature above the ordering temperature in @xmath0-namno@xmath1 .",
    "other factors , such as the interlayer coupling , the magnetic anisotropy and the me coupling , can , at best , only slightly shift the @xmath7 .    * total - energy change at the @xmath7 . *",
    "having established that the magnetic ordering at the @xmath7 is predominantly set by the 2d heisenberg hamiltonian and the tendency of both systems to remove magnetic degeneracy in the ground state by lattice deformation , the question that arises is what is the microscopic origin of such a complex transformation . in this respect ,",
    "the me coupling has been suggested as being the key factor @xcite in both @xmath0-namno@xmath1  and cumno@xmath1 .",
    "however , the me coupling has been shown to be insubstantial in the former case @xcite , and thus needs to be evaluated also in the cumno@xmath1 .",
    "the total - energy change at the @xmath7 , associated solely with the magnetoelasticity , arises from the coupling terms @xcite @xmath51 between the strain - tensor components @xmath52 and the magnetization - direction vector @xmath53 .",
    "the strength of the me coupling , and consequently the corresponding contribution to the total energy , is proportional to the me - coupling coefficients @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "the coefficients @xmath56  mj / m@xmath57 , @xmath58  mj / m@xmath57 and @xmath59  mj / m@xmath57 are determined as linear terms in the calculated dependence of the total - energy - density change @xmath60 on the strain ( see methods ) , which is shown in figure  [ fig4]a .",
    "the me energy gain is the largest for the shear - strain component @xmath61 , which is associated with the monoclinic - to - triclinic deformation .",
    "however , for the experimental strain @xmath62 ( see methods ) the magnetoelastic energy change amounts to only 2.7  @xmath15ev per triclinic unit cell , which is very similar to the value of 2.5  @xmath15ev found in @xmath0-namno@xmath1 .",
    "the contribution of the me coupling to the total energy change at the @xmath7 is thus negligible in both compounds .",
    "therefore , the complex phase transition at the @xmath7 has to reflect changes in the magnetic - exchange and elastic energies @xcite .",
    "our _ ab - initio _ calculations of both relevant contributions to the total energy in the cumno@xmath1  for the non - spin - polarized case , relevant to non - magnetically ordered structures , reveal that the monoclinic structure is energetically lower than the triclinic one , although only by @xmath631  mev per 4 formula units ( f.u . ) ; see figure  [ fig4]b .",
    "this is in - line with the @xmath5 crystal symmetry found experimentally at room temperature . however , once the magnetic order sets in , the total energy of the triclinic structure is lowered below that of the monoclinic structure by about 4  mev per 4 f.u .",
    "this change of @xmath641.25  mev per mn@xmath13 ion is mainly a consequence of the exchange - energy decrease during the structural phase transition , associated with the removal of the degenerate magnetic states due to the interchain frustration .",
    "the resulting splitting of the interchain exchange constants by @xcite @xmath65  mev releases @xmath66  mev of energy per mn that is slightly larger than the total - energy change at the @xmath7 , as it is partially spent to compensate for the elastic - energy increase in the triclinic phase .    the calculated total - energy difference below the @xmath7 of 1  mev per f.u .  in cumno@xmath1  between the two structures that is about 3-times above the calculation error bar",
    "( see methods ) , is markedly larger than in the @xmath0-namno@xmath1 , where the calculated difference was below the calculation error bar ; @xmath670.5  mev per f.u .",
    "however , in absolute terms this difference is small , even in the cumno@xmath1 , so that a competition between the near - degenerate monoclinic and triclinic structures is expected for both compounds .",
    "experimental local - probe magnetic techniques are then essential for highlighting possible differences between the two systems .    * nmr / nqr insight to the magnetism .",
    "* information about the magnetic properties of cumno@xmath1  on the local scale are revealed in the nqr / nmr experiments via the hyperfine ( hf ) coupling @xmath68 of the electronic and the @xmath69cu nuclear magnetic moments .",
    "moreover , the quadrupolar splitting in the electric - field gradient ( efg ) provides information about the material s structural properties .",
    "the nqr spectra measured in zero field correspond to a single line for each copper isotope @xcite , while the powder nmr spectra are structured ( see methods for details ) .",
    "our simultaneous fit of the nqr and nmr data at 80  k ( figure  [ fig1]a ) yields a hf coupling constant @xmath70  t/@xmath71 that is significantly larger than the coupling constant @xmath72  t/@xmath71 found @xcite in @xmath0-namno@xmath1 .",
    "since @xmath68 scales with the orbital overlap , the charge transfer from the mn@xmath13 ions to the interlayer cations ( cu@xmath73 or na@xmath73 ) is much larger in the cumno@xmath1  than in the @xmath0-namno@xmath1 .",
    "this implies a stronger @xmath30 in the former compound and thus is in line with the somewhat better agreement between the experimental and the predicted @xmath7 , as the renormalization factor @xmath39 in equation  ( [ eq5 ] ) is closer to the used value of 0.7 .",
    "the width @xmath74 of the nqr spectra at 80  k , amounting to @xmath75 of the line - position value @xmath76 already in the paramagnetic phase ( figure  [ fig1]b ) , is rather large .",
    "the line widths @xmath77 reveal spectral broadening being in accordance with the quadrupole moments @xmath78 and contradicting the gyromagnetic ratios @xmath79",
    ". therefore , sizeable structural distortions of the local environments must be present .",
    "the temperature dependence of both @xmath76 and @xmath74 shows a pronounced sudden increase below the @xmath7 ( figure  [ fig1]b ) , clearly marking the phase transition .",
    "the anomaly in @xmath76 at the @xmath7 is attributed to the structural transformation of the cumno@xmath1  sample , directly affecting the quadrupolar frequency @xmath80 .",
    "namely , static internal magnetic fields below the @xmath7 cause a symmetric broadening / splitting of the nqr line so that its center of gravity is unaffected @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the pronounced increase of @xmath74 by a factor of @xmath642 at the @xmath7 , exceeding the change of @xmath76 by several orders of magnitude , can only be magnetic in origin .",
    "we must emphasize that the existence of the nqr signal below the @xmath7 is unexpected .",
    "namely , in the frame of the homogeneously ordered magnetic phase @xcite with @xmath81 the cu nuclei would experience extremely large internal magnetic fields .",
    "although the cu site is a structural center of inversion , the magnetic order breaks this symmetry , as the spins at @xmath82 from a given cu site are fm ordered ( see the inset in figure  [ fig1]b ) , in contrast to the @xmath0-namno@xmath1 , where the order of the two corresponding spins is afm @xcite .",
    "such a spin configuration in cumno@xmath1  yields a large local hf field @xmath83  t ( @xmath84 is the size of the ordered @xcite mn@xmath13 moment ) .",
    "this field leads to extremely broad nqr spectra , @xmath85  mhz , being two orders of magnitude broader than the experimental ones .",
    "indeed , the nqr signal below the @xmath7 corresponds to a minority fraction of all the @xmath86cu nuclei , while a majority of the signal is lost at the @xmath7 due to the onset of large internal fields .",
    "namely , the boltzman - corrected intensity of the nqr signal at 4.6 k , when further corrected for nuclear relaxation effects , is smaller than the intensity at 80  k by a factor of @xmath87 .",
    "this reveals that , unexpectedly , about 6% of all the cu sites in our sample experience small or no internal magnetic fields and do not correspond to the reported homogeneous magnetic phase .",
    "we note that the afm order of the moments positioned symmetrically with respect to the cu site , or the absence of any order , result in a zero static local magnetic field at the cu site , and would explain the nqr - observable sites below the @xmath7 .",
    "since this minority signal exhibits clear anomalies at the @xmath7 ( figure  [ fig1]b ) it is obviously well coupled to the bulk that undergoes the magnetostructural transition .",
    "this is confirmed by the temperature dependence of the spin - lattice relaxation rate , 1/@xmath88 , that shows a maximum at the @xmath7 due to critical spin fluctuations @xcite related to the magnetic instability of the bulk .",
    "however , in contrast to the monotonic decrease found in the na - based compound below the @xmath7 , in the cumno@xmath1 , another clear maximum in both the nmr and nqr 1/@xmath88 is observed at around 10  k. this reveals an , as yet , unobserved instability that could be either magnetic or structural in its nature .    * probing the magnetic disorder with @xmath15sr*. in order to provide more insight into the magnetic state in the cumno@xmath1  that is , according to the unexpected minority nqr signal",
    ", apparently not as homogeneous as inferred from previous bulk measurements , we resorted to the @xmath15sr local - probe technique .",
    "moreover , this technique reveals details about the low - temperature anomaly in the nmr / nqr relaxation at 10  k. in contrast to nqr / nmr , which is limited because the intrinsic signal disappears below the @xmath7 , the @xmath15sr measurements can assess the magnetic properties of the entire cumno@xmath1  sample also below the @xmath7 .",
    "this time a hf / dipolar coupling between the electronic magnetic moments and the muon magnetic moment is utilized after a muon stops in the sample .",
    "the resulting local magnetic field @xmath89 at the muon site affects the @xmath15sr asymmetry @xmath90 that is proportional to the muon polarization precessing in @xmath89",
    ".    in cumno@xmath1 , the weak - transverse - field ( wtf ) experiment that effectively keeps track of the temperature - dependent ordered part of the sample by measuring the amplitude of the oscillating @xmath15sr signal @xcite , reveals that the fraction of the muons detecting large frozen internal fields starts growing already below 80  k ( figure  [ fig2]a ) ; i.e. , far above the @xmath7 , which can be attributed to developing short - range spin correlations @xcite .",
    "below the @xmath7 , the whole sample becomes magnetically ordered within only a few kelvins , leaving no room for a non - frozen fraction above the experimental error bar of a few percent .",
    "similar information is obtained from the zero - field ( zf ) @xmath15sr , where the initial asymmetry strongly decreases around the @xmath7 and at low temperatures reaches 1/3 of its high - temperature value ( inset in figure  [ fig2]b ) .",
    "such a reduction is characteristic of the establishment of strong static internal fields in powder samples .",
    "statistically , in 1/3 of all cases the muon magnetic moment is aligned parallel to the @xmath89 and therefore exhibits no precession , while rapid oscillations of the asymmetry in other cases diminish the @xmath15sr signal on a coarse time scale .",
    "a detailed look at the zf relaxation curves below @xmath7 ( figure  [ fig2]c ) also allows for the detection of the quickly - oscillating component .",
    "similar to the @xmath0-namno@xmath1  case @xcite , the two - component model @xmath91 } \\label{eq3}\\ ] ] fits well with the experimental data . here",
    ", @xmath92 denotes temperature - independent probabilities that the muons stop at either of the two magnetically non - equivalent stopping sites @xmath93 .",
    "the preferential site is occupied in 70(5)% cases .",
    "the internal field at this site is only slightly higher than at the second site ( 0.59 and 0.54  t at the first and the second site , respectively , at 5 k ) ; however , a fit with only a single oscillating component ( the dashed line in figure  [ fig2]c ) results in a much poorer agreement with the data . the damping rate of the oscillations @xmath94 that is due to the finite width of the local - field distributions @xcite in cumno@xmath1  is reduced by a factor of @xmath643 when compared to the @xmath0-namno@xmath1  ( figure  [ fig2]c ) , indicating more homogeneous magnetism .    in the zf experiment ,",
    "the magnetic phase transition at the @xmath7 is expressed as a maximum of the longitudinal muon - relaxation rate @xmath95 , like in the nqr / nmr relaxation experiments . moreover , the second maximum observed in the nqr / nmr experiments at 10  k is also found in the @xmath15sr .",
    "since the zf @xmath15sr signal corresponds to the total volume of the sample and the muons are only sensitive to magnetism , this reveals that the low - temperature anomaly is of magnetic origin and is intrinsic to the cumno@xmath1  system .",
    "the ftlm and dft numerical calculations provide a solid basis for addressing the experimentally observed similarities and differences between the cumno@xmath1  and the @xmath0-namno@xmath1 . considering the latter calculations in the magnetically ordered state ,",
    "the triclinic phase is energetically preferred in both compounds . with increasing temperature , the staggered susceptibility decreases and this leads to a finite @xmath7 .",
    "above the @xmath7 the exchange - energy gain associated with the magnetically ordered state disappears , which in turn leads to a structural transformation to the monoclinic phase that is energetically preferred in the non - magnetic state .",
    "the isotropic heisenberg hamiltonian of the spatially anisotropic triangular lattice is dominantly responsible for elevating the @xmath7 in the cumno@xmath1  with respect to the @xmath0-namno@xmath1 , while the magnetoelastic and the interlayer couplings play a less important role .    on the other hand , our local - probe experiments on the cumno@xmath1revealed some subtle ,",
    "yet profound , features that should be carefully considered in the attempt to understand the presence / absence of nano - scale phase separation in the spatially anisotropic triangular lattice .",
    "both , the nqr / nmr and the @xmath15sr investigations demonstrated that cumno@xmath1  undergoes a magnetostructural phase transition at @xmath8  k almost completely .",
    "the minority nqr component ( @xmath646% ) that remains present below the @xmath7 can be explained by regions where the interlayer magnetic ordering is fm instead of being afm , as the latter causes the disappearance of the nqr signal due to large local fields .",
    "the nqr signal exhibits a magnetic anomaly around 10  k , which is expressed by the increased relaxation rates of the nqr / nmr as well as the @xmath15sr .",
    "since @xmath15sr , on the other hand , detects a bulk magnetic signal , the small nqr component is apparently coupled to the bulk magnetic phase .",
    "this is further confirmed by the line position and the width of the nqr spectra , changing considerably at the @xmath7 . the coupling with the bulk phase",
    "can then be regarded in the context of the nano - scale phase inhomogeneity .",
    "a comparison of the zf @xmath15sr asymmetry curves of the cumno@xmath1  and the @xmath0-namno@xmath1  is quite informative in this respect .",
    "the notably reduced damping of the oscillations in the ordered phase of the former compound provides evidence of much narrower field distributions , and hence less disorder .",
    "this conclusion is also in line with the number of the interlayer cation ( cu@xmath73 and na@xmath73 ) sites experiencing internal fields that do not comply with the symmetry of the bulk magnetic order , which in the cumno@xmath1  is decreased to 6% , from the 30% found @xcite in the @xmath0-namno@xmath1 .",
    "the magnetostructurally inhomogeneous ground state of the @xmath0-namno@xmath1  on the nano - scale has previously been attributed to the combined effects of geometrical frustration and near - degenerate monoclinic and triclinic structural phases @xcite .",
    "we believe that the key factor controlling such an inhomogeneity is the difference in the total energy of the two competing phases in the magnetically ordered state .",
    "this difference is notably larger in the cumno@xmath1  ( 1  mev per f.u . )",
    "than in the @xmath0-namno@xmath1 , where it is below the computational error bar ( < 0.5  mev per f.u .",
    "@xcite ) . in the latter compound , an infinitesimal quenched disorder , locally favouring one phase over the other , can then be held responsible for triggering the phase separation .",
    "similar effects are suppressed in the stoichiometric cumno@xmath1 , but would become enhanced for larger deviations from perfect system uniformity . indeed , enhanced strain , acting as a precursor of the monoclinic - to - triclinic structural phase transition ,",
    "has been observed @xcite in the high - temperature monoclinic phase in stoichiometric @xmath0-namno@xmath1 , while in the cumno@xmath1  a cu - mn off - stoichiometry is required to produce such a strain @xcite .",
    "moreover , the diffuse magnetic scattering characteristic of 2d correlated regions that coexist with sharp magnetic bragg peaks ( one of the signatures of the inhomogeneity @xcite found in the @xmath0-namno@xmath1 ) is also found @xcite in the cumno@xmath1 . however , in contrast to the @xmath0-namno@xmath1 , where it persists to low temperatures , in stoichiometric cumno@xmath1  it gradually gives way to the 3d ordered phase below the @xmath7 .",
    "interestingly though , in off - stoichiometric samples @xcite the volume fraction of the 2d - correlated phase shows no decrease below the @xmath7 , implying that the 2d - ordered regions keep competing with the 3d order at low temperatures .",
    "the total - energy difference of the competing phases below the magnetostructural transition , reflecting the interplay of the magnetic - exchange and the elastic energies , then seems to determine the amount of disorder required to stabilize the inhomogeneous ground state on a geometrically frustrated triangular lattice .",
    "systems with near - degenerate competing phases can be locally perturbed more easily .",
    "such an inhomogeneity may , therefore , be a more general feature of geometrically frustrated magnets .",
    "* finite - temperature lanczos method simulations .",
    "* calculations of the spin susceptibility for the @xmath17 heisenberg model on the anisotropic triangular lattice ( equation  ( [ eq4 ] ) ) , were performed with the finite - temperature lanczos method ( ftlm ) @xcite and were used to determine the leading exchange couplings @xmath2 and @xmath3 in the cumno@xmath1 . within the ftlm finite - size clusters",
    "are diagonalized in a similar manner as for the standard exact diagonalization lanczos method ( at @xmath96 ) and additional random vector averaging over the @xmath97 vectors is employed to determine the properties at @xmath98 .",
    "typically , @xmath99 suffices for the largest systems and the lowest @xmath21 , while smaller systems require a larger @xmath97 .",
    "the limitations of the method are mainly set by finite - size effects , which are the largest at low @xmath21 and determine the lowest reachable @xmath21(@xmath100 ) . in order to reduce the finite - size effects we used periodic boundary conditions , adjusted cluster shapes , the largest reachable cluster sizes ( up to @xmath101 sites ) , and additional approximations for the values in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the temperature - dependent magnetic susceptibility @xmath18 of the model given by equation  ( [ eq4 ] ) was calculated previously in ref .   for @xmath0-namno@xmath1 .",
    "it was shown that in the regime of interest , elongated spin clusters are the most appropriate .",
    "in particular , if a cluster has @xmath102 independent spins in the @xmath2 direction and @xmath103 spins in the @xmath3 directions , it was realized that due to @xmath104 and two competing @xmath3 bonds , @xmath23 does not depend on @xmath103 for @xmath105 ( see fig .  2 in ref .  ) .",
    "this fact allows us to reduce the finite - size effects by using a larger @xmath102 .",
    "we note that due to the alternating behaviour of @xmath23 with @xmath102 ( see figure  [ figa ] ) , which originates in periodic boundary conditions and antiferromagnetic spin - spin correlations , the average susceptibility curve from the two largest - size clusters ( @xmath106 and @xmath107 ) is a better approximation than the @xmath108 curve .",
    "* scaling - like approximation for the susceptibility . *",
    "the results for several different sizes of finite clusters and their systematics , shown in figure  [ figa ] , allow a scaling - like analysis to obtain a better approximation of @xmath23 in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "typical scaling analyses use scaling functions of the form @xmath109 and additional higher terms when needed ; e.g. , @xmath110 .",
    "since our calculations are limited to rather small maximum system sizes by @xmath17 , we also use the results from small systems ( starting with @xmath111 ) .",
    "consequently , such scaling functions are not appropriate .",
    "in particular , at higher @xmath21 ( see , for example , @xmath112 in figure  [ figa ] ) @xmath23 has already converged with @xmath113 for systems with @xmath114 , while for @xmath115 notable finite - size effects are seen . therefore , the scaling function should be close to a constant for @xmath116 smaller than some value , while at larger @xmath116 , the scaling function should allow for a stronger @xmath113 dependence . for these reasons",
    "we use a generalized scaling function of the form @xmath117 $ ] , which corresponds to typically used functions in the limit of small @xmath116 . in order to also capture the alternating component of @xmath23 with @xmath102 ( figure  [ figa ] )",
    "we add , in a similar fashion , the term @xmath118(-1)^{n/2}$ ] .",
    "such a scaling function also gives a correct ( converged with @xmath113 ) result for high @xmath21 , while typical scaling functions fail in this respect .",
    "we have performed such a scaling for each @xmath21 separately . however , since we are limited to small systems with notable finite - size effects at low @xmath21 ( @xmath119 ) and since the scaling function has many parameters , the result of such an analysis should not be taken as a strict thermodynamic limit .",
    "rather , it should be regarded as a next approximation of it , compared to the result from simpler averaging of the two largest - cluster curves . * density - functional theory calculations . * the calculations of the total energies and the magneto - elastic ( me ) coupling coefficients were performed within the framework of the density - functional theory ( dft ) and the generalized - gradient approximation ( gga ) @xcite for the exchange - correlation contribution by applying the quantum espresso code @xcite .",
    "the electron - ion interactions were described by the vanderbilt ultrasoft potentials @xcite including the spin - orbit coupling for the mn atoms .",
    "the plane - wave cut - off parameters were set to 585 ev and 4678 ev for the expansion of the wave functions and the potential , respectively . in order to take into account the proper antiferromagnetic ordering , the @xmath120 supercells of the monoclinic and",
    "the triclinic structures were used .",
    "the calculations of the total energies as a function of the unit - cell volume for the different types of magnetic ordering were carried out by using @xmath121 reciprocal vectors in the full brillouin zone ( bz ) for the methfessel - paxton sampling @xcite integration .",
    "the criterion for the self consistency was the total - energy difference between two subsequent iterations being less than @xmath122 .",
    "the monoclinic phase was further optimized by minimizing the total energy and the inter - atomic forces with respect to the lattice parameters and the atomic positions .",

    "<S> inhomogeneity in the ground state is an intriguing , emergent phenomenon in magnetism . </S>",
    "<S> recently , it has been observed in the magnetostructural channel of the geometrically frustrated @xmath0-namno@xmath1 , for the first time in the absence of active charge degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> here we report an in - depth numerical and local - probe experimental study of the isostructural sister compound cumno@xmath1 that emphasizes and provides an explanation for the crucial differences between the two systems . </S>",
    "<S> the experimentally verified , much more homogeneous , ground state of the stoichiometric cumno@xmath1 is attributed to the reduced magnetoelastic competition between the counteracting magnetic - exchange and elastic - energy contributions . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison of the two systems additionally highlights the role of disorder and allows the understanding of the puzzling phenomenon of phase separation in uniform antiferromagnets .    </S>",
    "<S> although phase separation in a uniform system is a widespread phenomenon in diverse fields of matter @xcite , ranging from biological systems @xcite , to soft matter @xcite , and strongly correlated electron systems @xcite , in magnetism the microscopic pattering has been , until recently , almost exclusively limited to thin ferromagnetic ( fm ) films @xcite . in this case , such a pattering is a trade - off between minimizing the exchange and the dipolar energies . </S>",
    "<S> it thus represents one possible manifestation of a general requirement of multiple competing phases that can lead to inhomogeneous states . lately , it has become increasingly apparent that a similar competition between energetically nearly equivalent phases is also responsible for phase separation in geometrically frustrated spin systems @xcite that are generically characterized by ground - state degeneracy @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the balance between the competing phases in these systems is generally much more delicate and , therefore , poorly understood .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , the spatially anisotropic triangular antiferromagnet @xmath0-namno@xmath1 ,  with dominant intrachain ( @xmath2 ) and geometrically frustrated interchain ( @xmath3 ) antiferromagnetic ( afm ) exchange interactions ( inset in figure  [ fig3]a ) , has been highlighted as a paradigm of a phase - separated ground state in the absence of active charge degrees of freedom @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> its afm order that sets in below the nel temperature @xmath4  k is accompanied by a simultaneous structural deformation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this was initially suggested as being a phase transition from the high - temperature monoclinic ( @xmath5 ) to the low - temperature triclinic ( @xmath6 ) crystal structure @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , more detailed , recent experiments have shown that the magnetic order fails to drive this improper ferroelastic transition to completion @xcite . instead , </S>",
    "<S> an intricate magnetostructurally inhomogeneous state on the nano - scale has been discovered below the @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> such a state was suggested to be an unforeseen consequence of the subtle interplay between the geometrical frustration and the competing structural phases @xcite .    in order to fully understand this novel phenomenon , further theoretical studies and experimental investigations of related compounds are of paramount importance . in this respect , </S>",
    "<S> a comparison with the crystallographically @xcite and magnetically @xcite analogous sister compound cumno@xmath1 , known as the mineral crednerite , is particularly relevant . here , </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to @xmath0-namno@xmath1 , the emergent magnetic order below @xmath8  k is believed to lift the macroscopic degeneracy in the spin space completely , by inducing the monoclinic - to - triclinic structural phase transition @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this spin - induced phase transition is witnessed by the splitting of several families of nuclear bragg reflections @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it was suggested to reflect the strong magnetoelastic ( me ) coupling that allows for the development of shear strain at a low energy cost @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the strain is significantly enhanced @xcite in the off - stoichiometric @xcite cu@xmath9mn@xmath10o@xmath1 , where @xmath7 is reduced and the structural transition temperature is further suppressed with increasing @xmath11 even for small doping levels @xcite . moreover , in off - stoichiometric samples the interlayer ordering changes from afm , observed in stoichiometric cumno@xmath1 , to fm @xcite , which was attributed to a partial substitution of cu@xmath12 for mn@xmath13 that should effectively change the interlayer exchange coupling from afm to fm@xcite . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , this implies that cumno@xmath1  may be very close to an electronic instability , possibly of a similar kind to that found in stoichiometric @xmath0-namno@xmath1 .    </S>",
    "<S> obtaining in - depth information about the magnetic and structural properties of cumno@xmath1  on the local scale should clarify the differences with respect to the isostructural @xmath0-namno@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> such knowledge would also help to address the pending issue of the microscopic origin of the phase - separation phenomenon in geometrically frustrated magnets . </S>",
    "<S> the most obvious ambiguities arise from questions like : why is the @xmath7 enhanced in cumno@xmath1  compared to @xmath0-namno@xmath1 , despite the theoretically predicted sizably smaller exchange interactions in the former compound @xcite ; what is the role of the me coupling in establishing the structural distortion below the @xmath7 , what is the role of disorder ; and ultimately , why does the structural phase transition appear to be fully developed in cumno@xmath1 , while in @xmath0-namno@xmath1  it only manifests in a phase - separated state . </S>",
    "<S> here , we answer these questions by combining numerical calculations with local - probe experimental investigations . </S>",
    "<S> first , we determine the dominant intralayer exchange interactions by modelling the magnetic susceptibility via exact - diagonalization calculations . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the difference in the @xmath7 for the two compounds can be understood via the mismatch of the two non - equivalent interchain exchange interactions , i.e. , by the different extent of the frustration present in the two compounds , while the me contribution is negligible in this respect . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we provide the first experimental microscopic insight into the magnetism of cumno@xmath1  via @xmath14cu nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) and nuclear quadrupolar resonance ( nqr ) measurements , as well as complementary muon spin relaxation ( @xmath15sr ) measurements . </S>",
    "<S> these experiments clearly reveal that the ground state is more homogeneous in the cu case than in the na case and suggest that the stoichiometric cumno@xmath1  is on the verge of a phase - separation instability . </S>",
    "<S> finally , our _ ab - initio _ calculations suggest that the more homogeneous state of the stoichiometric cumno@xmath1  originates from an enhanced energy difference ( when compared to @xmath0-namno@xmath1 ) between the two competing phases , born out of the magnetic - exchange and the elastic - energy changes below the @xmath7 . </S>"
