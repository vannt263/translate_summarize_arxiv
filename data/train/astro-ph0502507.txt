    "the interaction of a star with a black hole has been studied previously by other authors ( rees 1988 ; carter & luminet 1985 ; luminet & marck 1985 ) with a number of detailed hydrodynamics simulations ( laguna et al .",

    ". nevertheless , none of these studied the luminosity variations occurring to the star in the vicinity of the black hole . in order to be complete ,",
    "such study should include stellar hydrodynamics in full general relativity , modeling of radiation processes in the disrupted star and relativistic effects on the emmitted light .",
    "due to the complexity of the subject , we do not attempt to study all these effects in full here , but we wish to complement hydrodynamic studies by previously mentioned authors",
    ". therefore we limit our attention in this paper to effects on star s luminosity induced solely by the gravity of the black hole , as we expect that relativistic effects alone might produce interesting luminosity phenomena .",
    "we simulate the disruption and the appearance of the star during close encounter as it would be seen by a distant observer and make a comparison of some results in our model with those obtained by hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "the model of the star used in our simulations depends on the expected strength of the tidal interactions between the star and black hole .",
    "tidal disruption of the star with mass @xmath10 and radius @xmath11 occurs only if the star approaches the black hole to within its roche radius : @xmath12 which , expressed in units of the black hole s gravitational radius @xmath13 , reads : @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the average densities of the sun and the star .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the dimensionless roche radius penetration factor @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the periastron distance of the star with respect to the black hole .",
    "the roche penetration factor of a black hole grazing orbit is obviously : @xmath19 .",
    "it is shown in the appendix that this penetration factor crucially determines the strength of tidal interaction , i.e. the amount of work the tidal forces do on the star .",
    "we show ( eq.[tidalref ] ) that tidal work can be approximated by : @xmath20 where @xmath21 can be thought of as an effective eccentricity of the star at the periastron .",
    "if the roche radius penetration factor is large , @xmath22 may grow to values of order @xmath23 , bringing @xmath24 to values comparable to a sizeable fraction of @xmath25 .",
    "thus , the tidal interaction becomes overwhelmingly strong for large @xmath26 .",
    "such an extreme scenario occurs for grazing interactions only if the size of the star is comparable to that of the black hole ( see appendix ) .",
    "we clasify grazing tidal interactions as follows :    * * @xmath27 * : the roche radius is smaller than the radius of the star , it follows that the roche penetration factor is less than 1 . as a consequence @xmath28 and the star as a whole does not suffer large perturbations , even if the black hole pierces the star and accretes a small part of its mass along the way . * * @xmath29 * : the roche radius more or less equals the radius of the star ( eq .",
    "[ roche ] ) and , unless the star is very unusual @xmath30 , so that the value of the roche penetration factor @xmath31 .",
    "for such a @xmath32 , @xmath33 ( c.f . appendix",
    "a ) and eq . [ tide ] predicts that the tidal energy is of order @xmath34 , which is a typical internal energy of a solar type star .",
    "thus , the tidal energy is just about large enough to completely distort the star ; the interaction may trigger violent hydrodynamic phenomena , possibly even a supernova .",
    "the most important phenomena governing the appearance of the star during such an encounter are hydrodynamic in nature , since the strong gravity region about the black hole has a much shorter range than is the size of the perturbed star .",
    "hydrodynamics governs the appearance of the phenomenon and , therefore , such an event does not directly reflect general relativistic effects in strong gravity environment . *",
    "* @xmath35 * , where @xmath36 is the escape velocity from the star : the black hole radius is comparable to the size of the star ; if the star is not very unusual , its escape velocity is much less than @xmath37 , so that according to eq .",
    "[ roche ] the roche radius is much greater than @xmath38 and consequently @xmath39 . in this case",
    "the tidal energy exceeds the internal energy by several orders of magnitude . a total and complete tidal disruption takes place outside the black hole but in the region sufficiently close to the black hole for relativistic effects to play the mayor role in dynamics of the disruption .",
    "3 ) . * * @xmath40 * : the black hole radius is larger that that of the star , but still smaller than roche radius - @xmath32 decreases with increasing mass of the black hole . the tidal energy before reaching the horizon is still comparable to the internal energy of the star .",
    "the release of tidal energy may well be sufficient to produce high energy shocks boosting stellar luminosity by many orders of magnitude .",
    "yet , shocks moving with a few mach are still much slower than the near speed of light the star is moving now .",
    "the star remains small with respect to the black hole along its way to the black hole .",
    "such a stellar capture will thus very closely trace relativistic effects in the space - time , as it will be seen almost as a flashing up point particle on its way to doom . * * @xmath41 * : the black hole is very much larger in size than the star ( @xmath42 for a solar type star ) , the roche radius lies beyond the black hole s horizon , so it follows ( [ rochem ] ) that the star is tidally disrupted only after crossing the horizon ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "hence , the point particle approximation for the falling star is very good in the whole region outside the black hole .",
    "since there is no agent to heat the star up , it is less likely for such an event to be noticed ( sect .",
    "2 ) .    here",
    "we discuss only the last three cases , since we find them interesting as a tool to study the strong gravity regions in the universe , as well as in view of supermassive black holes in galactic nuclei .",
    "we expect that a capture of a star by a giant black hole would most likely occur when a star in the cluster surrounding the giant black hole would be perturbed to a low angular velocity orbit with respect to the black hole",
    ". therefore , such encounters will , most likely occur with the velocity characteristic for parabolic infall .",
    "during such an infall the star can not be significantly disrupted while outside the horizon , so with respect to a much larger black hole it can be treated as a point source of light whose appearance with respect to the far observer will be modulated by the doppler shift , aberration bending and gravitational redshift .",
    "two numerical codes were developed to calculate the apparent luminosity changes of the source falling in both , schwarzschild type and kerr type black holes . during the encounter of the star with a giant black hole",
    "the star is simulated as a point source emitting monochromatic light of frequency @xmath44 and intensity @xmath45 , both constant in the frame comoving with the source .",
    "as the source is moving along a parabolic orbit with a given orbital angular momentum , we trace light rays from subsequent points of the source s trajectory ( separated by @xmath46t=1  @xmath47/c in coordinate time ) to the distant observers and calculate the apparent luminosity with respect to them as a function of time .",
    "we would like to note , that these results are directly applicable also to luminosity and spectrum changes produced by orbiting blobs of material in accretion discs around black holes .",
    "results for both types of black holes show ( gomboc et al .",
    "1999 ) two characteristic timescales of luminosity changes , both determined by the gravity of the black hole .",
    "the first one displays the basic quasiperiod in luminosity and redshift changes as the star spirals toward the black hole .",
    "the quasiperiod very closely matches the orbital period of the source at the innermost stable orbit ( 50 @xmath47/c for schwarzschild black hole ) .",
    "the number of quasiperiods observed depends on the fine tuning of the angular momentum to the critical value . in schwarzschild case",
    "the critical angular momentum is @xmath484 and the number of quasiperiods can be approximated as @xmath49 for 3.9@xmath504 .",
    "the quasiperiods in kerr case differ for prograde and retrograde orbits : for a maximal kerr black hole ( with rotation parameter a=0.998 @xmath47 ) and a star on a prograde orbit with angular momentum close to critical @xmath51 , the quasiperiod is @xmath52 13 @xmath47/c , while for a star on a retrograde orbit with @xmath53 close to critical @xmath54 , the quasiperiod is @xmath52 80 @xmath47/c , both consistent with orbital periods at critical radii .",
    "the second time scale is considerably faster ( of order @xmath55 ) and belongs to the rate of change of relativistic beaming direction with respect to the observer . for the black hole with mass @xmath56 , the corresponding timescales are @xmath57 10 hours and @xmath57 10 min , and for extreme @xmath58 , this time intervals are @xmath57 months and @xmath57 10 hours . since the luminosity and spectrum changes are caused by relativistic beaming and gravitational lensing , they are most evident to observers in the orbital plane of the star .",
    "the observers perpendicular to this plane see the source as slowly fading and then , as the source approaches the horizon , suddenly disappearing on a timescale of the order of @xmath57 10 @xmath47/c . comparing results for schwarzschild and kerr black holes , we find that luminosity curves ( fig . [ f1 ] ) are qualitatively similar , but timescales generally shorten for kerr prograde orbits and become longer for kerr retrograde orbits .",
    "results show that within @xmath59 of the orbital plane one may expect luminosity rise by a factor of a few 10 , while the maximum doppler plus redshift factor ( @xmath60 ) is 1.8 for the schwarzschild case and 2.2 for the maximal kerr black hole case .",
    "the capture of a star by a black hole of comparable size is a phenomenon where black hole s gravity plays the dominating role both on propagation of light as well as on propagation of matter belonging to the star .",
    "this property of the phenomenon is forcefully stressed by the fact that the tidal energy is many orders of magnitude larger than its gravitational binding energy and becomes a sizeable fraction of @xmath63 ( eq .",
    "[ tide ] ) .",
    "therefore , we build our approach on the work of luminet & marck ( 1985 ) , who showed that in the vicinity of the black hole `` particles of the star undergo a phase of approximate free fall in the external gravitational field , since the tidal contribution grows much larger than pressure and self gravitating terms '' . therefore , we use a simple model , whereby the star is considered as undisturbed by the black hole ( i.e. spherically symmetric ) , until it reaches the roche radius . after crossing it",
    ", the black hole s gravity takes over and the self gravity and internal pressure are completely switched off .",
    "further , we neglect hydrodynamic effects .",
    "this approximation is justified if the proper time elapsed between the roche radius crossing and total disruption is short compared to the dynamic time scale @xmath64 of the star . for an estimate of the two timescales we take @xmath65 where @xmath66 is estimated as the proper time elapsed during a radial parabolic infall from the roche radius to the horizon is defined only for @xmath67 , when tidal disruption takes place outside the horizon of the black hole . for nonzero",
    "angular momentum orbits @xmath66 is slightly , but not crucially longer . ] .",
    "specifically , for a solar type star we obtain @xmath68 13  min , which is an order of magnitude less than the dynamic time scale @xmath69 3 hours .",
    "the ratio of the two times indicates that the amount of energy exchanged may not be quite negligible , but is small enough that it may be neglected in the first approximation .",
    "further justification for such an approximation comes from results of hydrodynamic evolution calculated by kochanek ( 1994 ) and laguna et al .",
    "laguna et al noted that `` the qualitative features of the debris - including its crescent - like shape - can be reproduced by neglecting hydrodynamic interactions and self - gravity of the star '' , since the formation of the crescent is due to `` geodesic motion of the fluid elements of the star in a schwarzschild space - time which includes relativistic - induced precession of the orbit about the black hole '' .",
    "this confirms previously mentioned findings by luminet & marck ( 1985 ) , that black hole s gravity dominates in close encounters .",
    "therefore , we argue that by neglecting hydrodynamic effects , we obtain in close encounters approximately the correct shape of stellar debris .    hence , our numerical model starts with a spherically symmetric star of radius @xmath38 and mass @xmath70 consisting of @xmath71 equally massive constituents ( @xmath72 , @xmath73 ) distributed randomly but in such a way that in the average their density distribution follows that of a star , which is approximated by the polytrope model with n=1.5 .",
    "all constituents of the star start with the ( same ) velocity , corresponding to parabolic velocity of the stellar center of mass , which is placed at a distance @xmath74 from the black hole .",
    "subsequently the positions of free falling stellar constituents are calculated at later discrete times ( @xmath75 ) according to general relativistic equations of motion .    to test the errors induced by these approximations , we tudy encounters of a m@xmath9 , r@xmath9 star with a 10@xmath76 m@xmath9 black hole and compare our results on central density in the star ( average density inside 0.01 @xmath38 ) with those obtained by laguna et al ( 1993 ) , fulbright et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , khokhlov et al ( 1993b ) , ivanov & novikov ( 2001 ) .",
    "[ density ] shows the central density as a function of time with respect to the time of periastron passage as obtained by our model and by hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "the qualitative agreement between these results justifies the neglect of internal pressure in calculating the dynamics of disruption .",
    "the major difference seems to be in the precise timing of tidal compression : in our model the strongest compression occurs very close to periastron , in agreement with the results of luminet & marck ( 1985 ) , while in most hydrodynamics simulations the central density peaks approximately 15 - 20 @xmath47/c after the periastron passage .",
    "our results on the shape of stellar debris during the close encounter also agree with results of laguna et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , although at later times our crescent becomes considerably longer .",
    "we consider the tidal disruption to be the phenomenon , where the work done on the star by tidal forces is comparable or greater than its initial internal energy .",
    "the tidal disruption is thus a violent nonstationary process that takes place in the vicinity of the black hole on a time scale that is considerably shorter than the stellar dynamic time scale ( measured in proper time of the falling star ) .",
    "as the star is deformed into a long thread , the giant tidal wave deposits great amounts of energy which soon pushes gases into an out moving shock wave more or less perpendicular to the threadlike axis of the star . thus , during the disruption process several mechanisms play an important role : shocks , adiabatic expansion and cooling of disrupted material , possible explosions due to tidal squeezings as predicted by carter & luminet ( 1982 , 1985 ) , radiation driven expansion etc .",
    "these effects have no doubt important influence on the cooling and luminosity of the disrupted star , but we wish to stress , that as shown by luminet & marck ( 1985 ) gravity in general overwhelms other forces during the close encounter .",
    "so , since gravity of the black hole swings the star around on a time scale that is much shorter than any other time scale that may play a role , we believe , that as a first step to estimate the luminosity variations of the tidally disrupted star , we may use a simple model , which must in the first place correctly take into account the effects of dominating strong gravitational field of the black hole .",
    "as the disruption progresses and the hot stellar inner layers become exposed both by gravity and by shock waves , the luminosity is bound to rise due to higher effective temperature and due to higher effective area seen . the overall rise in luminosity depends on other partially competing mechanisms involved : while the expansion and cooling would tend to reduce it , it must nevertheless rise dramatically due to enormous work being done by tidal forces which drive shock heating and supernova - like explosions .",
    "the precise role of these mechanisms and their influence on stellar structure and evolution need detailed analysis , but is beyond the scope of this paper .    here",
    "we wish to make a step towards the complete solution by including in full only the most important ingredient defining the shortest time scales : the effects of black hole s gravity on the apparent variability of stellar luminosity .",
    "the standard stellar atmosphere model ( bowers and deeming 1984 , carroll and ostlie 1996 , swihart 1971 ) is not applicable in calculating the effective temperature of any surface element since , because of the highly dynamic structure , the fine details of atmospheric density , temperature and pressure profiles are not available , even more we can not predict in advance which part of the star is going at some future time belong to the atmosphere .",
    "so we are forced to apply a monte carlo model throughout the star by which the unperturbed star is modeled as a spherical cloud consiting of a large number ( @xmath71 ) of identical constituents distributed randomly , but in such a way that their average density follows that of an @xmath77 polytropic model ( cf .",
    "section 3.1 ) .",
    "the constituents are optically thick and have an assigned temperature according to their position in the cloud , which again follows the temperature profile of the @xmath77 polytropic stellar model . the model `` photospheric '' temperature and model `` luminosity ''",
    "are calculated as the sum of spectral contributions from those cloud constituents that are seen by the observer , i.e. by those that are not obscured by constituents in overlaying layers . for the purpose of obscuration all the constituents",
    "are considered to have the same cross section @xmath78 , so that @xmath79 , where the parameter @xmath80 is the number of constituents belonging to `` the atmosphere '' of the star .",
    "it is clear that , since for statistical reasons @xmath80 must be at least a few ten , and @xmath71 is limited by the computer power to a few million , the ratio @xmath81 is much greater than the ratio @xmath82 in a real star .",
    "one could argue that the atmosphere could be made less massive by representing it with a larger number of less massive constituents .",
    "however , in the case of total tidal disruption the interior is mixed into the atmosphere during the late stages of disruption and the so introduced uneven opacity of stellar constituents would further complicate the interpretation of results .",
    "thus we can not afford to make models with sufficiently opaque atmospheres and , as a result , our initial model `` photospheric '' temperatures are too high .",
    "we note , however , that the model photospheric depth is a function of @xmath81 , so by changing @xmath71 , we probe the stellar atmosphere to different depths . in such a way",
    "an extrapolation to realistic opacities is possible .",
    "the consistency of such an extrapolation is checked on the initial spherically symmetric stellar model , where the monte carlo results can be directly compared with the theoretical atmospheric model .",
    "an example of such a comparison is shown in fig.[depth ] .",
    "it is clear that the depth of our model `` photospheres '' is some orders of magnitude too high , yet it is possible to extrapolate model `` photospheres '' to depths of realistic stellar atmospheres , since the temperature is a monotonic smooth function of depth . for evolved stages of tidal disruption",
    "there is no underlying theoretical model , so that we rely on extrapolated results of the monte carlo model .",
    "as the star moves along the orbit , images of the star with respect to the far observer are formed as follows : photon trajectories and the time of flight between each stellar constituent and the observer are calculated with technique described in ade et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , gomboc ( 2001 ) , brajnik ( 1999 ) and ade & gomboc ( 1996 ) .",
    "only two trajectories connecting two space points are considered - the shortest one and the one passing the black hole on the other side , while those winding around the black hole by more than @xmath83 are neglected .",
    "( it has been shown before ( ade & gomboc 1996 ) , that light following trajectories with higher winding numbers contributes less and less to the apparent luminosity . )",
    "the beam contributions are sorted into pixels with an area corresponding to the size of @xmath78 , and tagged according to the arrival time .",
    "the intensity corresponding to a given pixel is then defined as the intensity corresponding to the ray with shortest travel time .",
    "since light from deeper layers takes longer to reach the observer , this takes care of the obscuration of deep layers .",
    "the intensity of a contributing beam is calculated assuming that the corresponding stellar constituent emits in its own rest frame as a black body at its temperature .",
    "the apparent luminosity and effective temperature of the star as a function of time ( with respect to the chosen observer ) are calculated and successive stellar images , formed in this way , are pasted in a movie .    we divide our model in three parts : first we estimate the relativistic effects alone by simulating the luminosity variations of an iso - thermal star ( i.e. star with t(r , t)=const . ) . in the next step ,",
    "we consider the star with polytrope n=1.5 temperature profile and estimate the luminosity variations due to exposure of inner hot regions of the star .",
    "we first consider a simple case , in which the temperature of all stellar constituents is constant in time ( no cooling or heating ) , and afterwards add a rough estimation of the effect of cooling of exposed stellar parts on the stellar luminosity .      to isolate the effect of gravity , we first compute luminosity variations of an iso - thermal star . the ensuing luminosity variations can be ascribed to : doppler boosting and aberation of light , gravitational lensing and redshift ( similar as for a point - like source in sect .",
    "2 ) and ( in addition ) the elongation of the star due to relativistic precession and due to tidal squeezing . fig .",
    "[ iso ] shows the obtained luminosity variations as a function of time for encounters with @xmath53=0 ( radial infall ) , @xmath53=4 ( critical ) , @xmath53=5 ( @xmath18=10 @xmath47 ) and @xmath53=7 ( @xmath18=22.3 @xmath47 ) as seen perpendicular to and _ in _ the orbital plane .",
    "results show that the maximal rise in luminosity occurs in the case of the critical encounter ( @xmath53=4 ) , where the overall luminosity rise due to elongation of the star is of about a factor of 20 ( as seen by the observer perpendicular to the orbital plane , fig .",
    "[ iso ] above ) , while gravitational lensing and doppler boosting enhance it up to about 40 times the initial luminosity ( fig . [ iso ] below ) .",
    "observers close to the orbital plane see most extreme variations : dimming of the receding star , its rebrightening as it emerges from behind the black hole and variations on short timescales of about 10 @xmath47/c , which are due to lensing effects .",
    "since the star and the black hole are comparable in size , the probability that they are aligned with respect to the observer , is high . when lensing takes place the relevant part of the star is imaged into an einstein disk and the apparent luminosity increases manifold ( fig .",
    "[ iso]c ) .",
    "next , we consider the star with n=1.5 polytrope temperature profile and we assume that the temperature of stellar debris does not change with time .",
    "the model is obviously much too crude to rely upon its results regarding the spectral characteristics or even the absolute value of the emitted luminosity .",
    "the crude argument why this model may bear some resemblance to the true light curve is that shock wave released by the unbalance of gravity carries internal energy to the surface in such a way that the energy influx from the interior temporarily compensates the radiation loss .",
    "the simulation shows that , as the inner hot layers of the star are exposed during the disruption , they contribute to the substantial rise in stellar luminosity , depending on the orbital angular momentum of the star ( fig .",
    "[ konst ] ) . the star on a low angular momentum orbit is completely captured by the black hole and produces only a short ( @xmath57 1 - 10 @xmath47/c ) flare before disappearing behind the horizon . on the other hand , the star with high angular momentum experiences only a slight distortion during the distant flyby with a resulting temporary ( @xmath57 10 - 100 @xmath47/c ) slight increase in luminosity .",
    "the most dramatic is the encounter of the star on the critical angular momentum orbit ( @xmath53=4 ) , during which half of stellar constituents are swallowed by the black hole and the other half escapes . during this process ,",
    "the star is totally tidally disrupted in such a way that the higher angular momentum material rapidly lags behind the stellar debris with lower angular momentum , which produces a long thin spiral ( fig .",
    "[ konst ] . ) .",
    "outer layers of the star are stripped off in a time of the order of 100 @xmath47/c , the depth to the hot inner core decreasing together with self gravity . in our crude model this is seen as decreasing optical thickness and the exposure of the hot inner core ; the luminosity rises steeply .",
    "the spectrum of the debris is dominated by the emission of the innermost exposed layers and as long as shock waves are building up , i.e. until cooling sets in , these lead to x - rays .",
    "some luminosity peaks arise from the effect of tidal compression in the direction perpendicular to the orbital plane of the star , which in our model for a short time exposes the interior of the star .",
    "such peaks are evident in fig .",
    "[ konst ] above c and c , and these two compressions are in agreement with multiple tidal squeezings predicted by luminet & marck ( 1985 ) and confirmed by laguna et al .",
    "in our model they produce luminosity peaks lasting about @xmath52 5 @xmath47/c .",
    "as mentioned earlier , carter & luminet ( 1982 , 1985 ) predict , that thermonuclear explosion may occur at this moment .    the scale of the luminosity rise in fig .",
    "[ konst ] is rather uncertain due to neglect of hydrodynamic effects and also due to our poor atmosperic model ( section 3.2 . ) . for",
    "the critical tidal disruption of the sun the extrapolation of our model would suggest the total luminosity to rise to about @xmath84 ( mostly in x - rays ) , which accentuates the extent of tidal disruption , but also sends a warning that by that time our constant internal energy model assumption ceases to be valid . as suggested in section 3.2 . , we calculated a range of models with @xmath71 between 10@xmath85 and @xmath86 and extrapolated the results to realistic atmosperic depths .",
    "these numerical results suggest that , at least for the critical disruption , the average temperature and size of the final crescent to which the star is deformed is roughly independent of @xmath71 .",
    "thus we tested the idea that tidal disruption exposes or mixes up by shearing the envelope of the star to a certain depth @xmath87 , which we define as the depth in the undisturbed star , down to which the average @xmath88 is equal to the average @xmath88 of the final crescent . in this way we estimate ( independent of @xmath71 ) that for critical @xmath53=4 and @xmath891.5",
    ", @xmath87 is about 0.25 @xmath38 , while for @xmath90 we get @xmath910.1 @xmath38 . for a close flyby with @xmath53=5",
    ", @xmath87 is about 0.7 @xmath38 and 0.5 @xmath38 for @xmath891.5 and @xmath92=5 respectively .",
    "we may also , as an example , estimate the luminosity of a solar type star during the bright critical stage of total disruption on a 10@xmath93 black hole as follows : the steep luminosty rise ( c.f .",
    "[ konst ] ) has a time scale between 30@xmath47/c to 100@xmath47/c , which is about 2.5 to 8 minutes . assuming that the initial thermal energy contained in the exposed layers ( @xmath5710@xmath94 erg ) is radiated away on this time scale",
    ", the critical luminosity would be of the order 5 to 15@xmath95 .",
    "after the debris is spread and starts moving away from the black hole , the physics of tidal disruption is no longer dominated by black hole s gravity .",
    "the physical conditions in stellar debris , the physics of radiation processes , hydrodynamics etc . take over and the ensuing processes go beyond the simulation presented here .",
    "in general , the temperature inside the star may change due to various mechanisms , already mentioned .",
    "to get an idea of how they might affect the light curve , we again model the cooling in two very approximative ways :    \\(a ) exponential cooling of exposed stellar layers with different characteristic times : @xmath96=1 @xmath47/c and 10 @xmath47/c ,    \\(b ) cooling of exposed stellar layers as due to their own black body radiation in the 4@xmath97 solid angle .",
    "results presented in fig .",
    "[ cool ] show , that if the cooling were very efficient - with timescales of 1 @xmath47/c , the luminosity rise would be quite short and modest .",
    "stellar encounter with a massive black hole can be a very energetic event , with energy released and luminosity variations depending primarily on the relative size of the star compared to the black hole .",
    "we note that the tidal interaction energy may rise to as high as 10% of the total mass - energy of the captured star , which is available when the star is comparable in size to the size of the black hole .",
    "this size ratio is also critical as to the nature of the disruption .    in this work we focused on gravitational phenomena and showed that :    * \\a ) a critical capture of a `` pointlike star '' is characterized by a series of quasiperiodic apparent luminosity peaks with the quasiperiod 50 @xmath47/c for a schwarzschild black hole and 13 and 80 @xmath47/c for an extreme kerr co- and counter - rotating case respectively ( fig .",
    "this translates into 6.9 hours @xmath98 , 1.8 hours @xmath99 and 11.1 hours @xmath98 , respectively .",
    "if a `` pointlike star '' would be a planet falling to a @xmath100 black hole in galactic centre respective quasiperiods would be 15 minutes , 3.9 minutes and 24 minutes . *",
    "\\b ) the sharpness , the amplitude of quasiperiodic peaks and the amplitude of the doppler factor is more pronounced for observers in the orbital plane as compared to those perpendicular to this plane .",
    "the highest value for the doppler factor is 1.8 for the schwarzschild and 2.2 for the extreme kerr black hole . *",
    "\\c ) the number of quasiperiodic peaks ( @xmath101 ) depends on the closeness of the orbital angular momentum ( @xmath53 ) to the critical value @xmath53=4 and can be approximated as @xmath49 .",
    "* \\d ) an extended star may be approximated as a collection of point particles when heading toward the complete tidal disruption .",
    "the shape and the density of the debris calculated in this approximation compares well with more sophisticated hydrodynamic calculations ( cf .",
    "section 3 ) . *",
    "\\e ) model light curves for critical tidal disruption of a star of the same size as that of the black hole ( fig .",
    "[ iso ] , [ konst ] , [ cool ] ) calculated for different heuristic models show similar temporal characteristics which display very rapid ( on time scale of order 10 @xmath47/c ) luminosity variations by a few or even many orders of magnitude , while the quasiperiodicity is no longer pronounced in such a process .",
    "light curves describing a critical capture are very rough and can not be momentarily calibrated in flux .",
    "they are presented as they produce the extremely short time scale phenomena characteristic of the strength of black hole s gravitational field , which will persist in the future more elaborate models of tidal disruption .",
    "in order to estimate the amount of heat and kinetic energy deposited to the star by the tidal wave , it is useful to follow the steps of the derivation of the virial theorem . consider the some @xmath102 nuclei and electrons making up the star as representative point particles making up the ideal gas of the star .",
    "each of the particles with mass @xmath103 ( @xmath104 ) moves according to newton s law ( we will folow the more transparent classical derivation , which is sufficient for order of magnitude arguments . ) : @xmath105 the black hole has been placed at the origin from where the position vectors @xmath106 are reconed .",
    "@xmath107 models the force taking place during particle collisions .",
    "it obeys ( the strong version of ) the third newton s law , and since in the ideal gas approximation collisional forces act only at a `` point '' , the energy connected with the potential of these forces can be neglected .",
    "the second term on the right describes the gravitational interaction among the constituents of the star and the last term represents the gravitational force of the black hole .",
    "it is convenient to define the center of mass position vector @xmath108 , so that @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "summing equations [ newton ] over all @xmath111 , one obtains the center of mass equation of motion in the form : @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the quadrupole moment tensor of the mass distribution with respect to the center of mass of the star defined in the usual way as : @xmath114 terms of @xmath115 and higher will henceforth be neglected . if the star is deformed in a prolate ellipsoid with the long axis in the direction @xmath116 ,",
    "@xmath113 can be written in the form @xmath117 with @xmath118 beeing positive and proportional to the eccentricity of the ellipsoid . here",
    "@xmath119 stands for the diadic product of the respective vectors and @xmath120 is the identity matrix .",
    "the angular momentum of the star ( @xmath121 ) , which is a conserved quantity , can be split into the orbital ( @xmath122 ) and spin part ( @xmath123 ) .",
    "the time derivative of the orbital part follows from eq.[cm ] and when [ kvad ] applies , it can be written as : @xmath124    the sum of scalar products of equations [ newton ] by @xmath125 gives the energy conservation law .",
    "we split the kinetic energy of the star into the center of mass part @xmath126 and the internal kinetic energy part comprises both the kinetic energy of thermal motion and the kinetic energy of bulk motion in the tidal wave . ] @xmath127 . using eq .",
    "[ cm ] and neglecting the collisional interaction energy , we obtain the conserved energy @xmath128 in the following form : @xmath129 where @xmath130 is the self gravitational energy of the star ( @xmath131 )    finally , we obtain the equivalent of the virial theorem by we multiplying eqs.[newton ] by @xmath132 and summing over all @xmath111 .",
    "the result can be rearanged into the transparent form : @xmath133 where @xmath134 . for a star in hidrostatic equilibrium , the right - hand side vanishes and the total energy of the star @xmath135 .",
    "if the star is not in hidrostatic equilibrium , the right hand side of eq.[fvir ] can be considered as the energy imbalance - if it is more than @xmath136 , it is sufficient to completely disrupt the star on a time scale @xmath64 .",
    "an exact evaluation of this energy imbalance is beyond reach in this simple analysis , however , a simplified model offers some clues .",
    "consider an idealized case of an `` incompressible star '' flying about a massive black hole .",
    "from the point of view of the star , gravity is exerting a tidal force squeezing it in the plane defined by the temporary radius vector and the orbital angular momentum and elongating it perpendicular to this plane .",
    "the tidal force acts to accelerate the surface of the star with respect to the center of mass , but it must also act against rising pressure and internal gravity . thus , roughly speaking , the tidal force does work in pumping kinetic energy into the tidal wave , but also in loading the gravitational potential energy which acts as the spring energy driving oscillation modes of the star . consider small tidal distortions . in this case",
    "quadrupole deformations are dominant , so that the deformation field ( @xmath137 ) of the incompressible star can be described as a linear combination of 5 degenerate quadrupole modes : @xmath138 here @xmath139 are modal base vector fields that can be expressed as gradients of quadratic polynomials in coordinates @xmath140 , @xmath141 , @xmath142 , obtained by multiplying spherical functions @xmath143 by @xmath144 and identifying @xmath145 etc , and @xmath146 are modal amplitudes . in the coordinate system where the @xmath142 axis is normal to the orbital plane and @xmath140 points from the periastron to the black hole ,",
    "only three amplitudes are excited and the corresponding modal base fields are : @xmath147 these deformations lead to the following quadrupole moments : @xmath148 as long as tidal modes can be considered roughly independent , their dynamics can be derived from the lagrange function @xmath149 with the kinetic energy ( @xmath150 ) : @xmath151 and the potential energy ( @xmath152 - the deviation od self gravity from the equilibrium value in undeformed state ) : @xmath153 where @xmath154 is the resonant frequency of quadrupole modes . for a star consisting of a self gravitating incompressible fluid",
    "we obtain @xmath155 generalized forces exciting these modes are ( goldstein 1981 ) : @xmath156 let us calculate these forces in the specific case when one can assume that @xmath157 represents a parabolic orbit.we express the compontents of @xmath158 as @xmath159 where @xmath160 and @xmath161 is the true anomaly obeying the kepler equation : @xmath162 with this , and using [ modes ] , the integrals in [ qji ] can be evaluated to obtain the nonvanishing generalized forces : @xmath163 finally we write down the euler - lagrange equations of motion ( @xmath164 ) for modal amplitudes . after introducing the characteristic time @xmath165 and the dimensionless time @xmath166 , they can be cast into the dimensionless form : @xmath167 where the dimensionless forces @xmath168",
    "are functions of @xmath169 only : @xmath170 thus , the only trace of parameters of the tidaly interacting system is left in the factor @xmath171 , which is @xmath172 times the ratio of the characteristic fly - by time about the black hole and the period of quadrupole modes .",
    "it is useful to note that , using eq.[roche ] and [ kvadruf ] , this product can be written as @xmath173 i.e. , it is inversely proportional to the power of roche radius penetration depth . in the case of a distant fly - by @xmath174 ,",
    "so it follows from eq.([eqmotion ] ) that @xmath175 , which is the familiar result often used with earth tides .",
    "note , however , that for deep penetrations of the roche radius @xmath176 , and thus the ( dimensionless ) generalized forces @xmath177 become large at frequencies that are resonant with @xmath154 .",
    "we calculate the total work done by tidal forces on the system of normal modes during the whole fly - by process by noting that it can formally be expressed as the change of the hamiltonian @xmath178 during the process ( neglecting damping of normal modes ) .",
    "initially the quadrupole system starts in the undisrupted state with @xmath179 , and ends in a state of excited quadrupole modes with @xmath180 ( i.e. for @xmath181 ) : @xmath182 solving equations [ eqmotion ] with the retarded green s function , this can be written in the form : @xmath183 where @xmath184    we note that @xmath24 can be written in the form @xmath185 , where @xmath186 and according to ( [ tidalref ] ) @xmath187 can be thought of as an effective eccentricity of the star at the periastron .",
    "[ f20 ] shows that @xmath188 can reach values of order @xmath23 if a fly - by is comparable to the dynamic time - scale of the star .",
    "note however that for deep roche radius penetrations our first order perturbation model no longer applies ; closer analysis shows that the model is aplicable for @xmath189 i.e. for @xmath190 ( eq . [ omegabeta ] ) the tidal energy is proportional to @xmath191 since @xmath192 .",
    "this is in agreement with result of lacy et al 1982 and carter & luminet 1983 . ] .",
    "now we are in the position to estimate the high value of the right hand side of eq.[fvir ] for this simple parabolic infall of an incompressible star .",
    "the left hand side starts at zero , when the star is still far from the black hole .",
    "as time goes on , the internal kinetic and potential energy change as the energy of tidal modes , so that the left hand side is greatest when all the tidal energy is in the kinetic energy of the wave .",
    "thus , the maximum value , which is also the maximum value of the right hand side equals @xmath24",
    ".    even if the above analysis is valid , strictly speaking , for an incompressible star and in the approximation of independent ( small amplitude ) tidal modes , it does suggest the qualitative conclusion that the tidal interaction depends crucially on the ratio period of the fundamental mode versus typical fly - by time ( @xmath171 ) and does become resonant if the fly - by time is less than the period of the fundamental mode .",
    "the energy deposited into the star by the tidal interaction can be of the order @xmath193 , which may surpass the absolute value of the internal gravitational energy of the star by many orders of magnitude if @xmath18 , @xmath38 and @xmath47 happen to be of the same order .",
