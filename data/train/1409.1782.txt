    "impulsive gravitational waves describe short but intense bursts of gravitational radiation and have become physically interesting models of exact radiative spacetimes in einstein s theory . at the same time they are spacetimes of low regularity : while one prominent form of the metric is only continuous ( actually locally lipschitz continuous  a fact that will turn out to be essential in our analysis ) another one is even distributional . hence these geometries are also mathematically interesting in the context of non - smooth lorentzian geometry , where they can serve as relevant test models .    in this work",

    "from the physical point of view , an impulsive gravitational wave most naturally can be understood as a limit of a suitable family of gravitational waves with sandwich profiles of ever `` shorter duration '' @xmath4 which simultaneously become `` stronger '' as @xmath5 .",
    "mathematically , this amounts to a distributional limit in which a sequence of sandwich profiles converges to the profile @xmath6 , the dirac function .",

    "the same construction in de sitter or anti - de sitter space generates impulsive gravitational waves in these backgrounds .",

    "pp_-waves are obtained . in @xcite",
    "it was demonstrated that exactly the same junction conditions ( [ juncnon ] ) applied to a general background spacetime ( [ conf * ] ) of constant curvature introduce impulsive waves also in the de sitter ( @xmath24 ) or anti - de  sitter ( @xmath25 ) universes . however , the geometries of these impulses are different since the null hypersurface @xmath23 , along which the spacetime is cut and pasted , is described by the 2-metric @xmath26 .",
    "this is a 2-dimensional space of constant gaussian curvature @xmath27 , which is a plane for @xmath2 . in the @xmath28 cases it is either a _ sphere _ ( @xmath24 ) or a _ hyperboloid _ ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "these geometries have been described in detail in  @xcite using various coordinate representations , and it was explicitly demonstrated that the wave surfaces are nonexpanding .",
    "while the `` cut and paste '' method describes the identification of points on both sides of the impulse it does not provide explicit metric forms of the complete spacetimes .",
    "thus the next step is to find a suitable coordinate system in which the metric is continuous as a function of @xmath30 .    starting again with the metric ( [ conf * ] ) we perform the transformation @xmath31 where @xmath32 is an arbitrary real - valued function .",

    "observe that any locally lipschitz metric @xmath44 ( denoted by @xmath45 ) possesses a locally bounded connection and so the curvature is a distribution .",

    "the metric ( [ conti ] ) thus explicitly describes impulsive waves in de  sitter , anti - de  sitter or minkowski backgrounds . for @xmath2 ,",

    "it was demonstrated in @xcite that _ all _ nonexpanding impulses in minkowski or ( anti-)de  sitter universes can be constructed from the general class of type  n kundt solutions @xcite , upon considering the distributional limit @xmath56 of the structural function , i.e. , @xmath57 { \\ensuremath{\\partial}}u^2\\ , \\label{knimp}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 .",

    ". the only non - trivial impulsive gravitational waves of the form ( [ knimp ] ) in minkowski space are thus the impulsive _ pp_-waves ( [ imp - pp ] ) .",
    "similar results hold also for @xmath24 and @xmath29 . generically , there are three distinct subclasses of nonexpanding waves , namely @xmath73 given by @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath74 given by @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath29 , and generalized siklos waves @xcite @xmath75 for which @xmath76 and @xmath29 , see @xcite . in all these cases",
    "it was shown in @xcite that although these canonical subclasses are different for extended profiles , they are equivalent for impulsive profiles . in this way , by considering the above distributional limit ( [ knimp ] ) of the class we obtain an explicit form of _ all _ solutions representing nonexpanding impulses .",

    ", the full family of impulsive limits ( [ knimp ] ) of nonexpanding sandwich waves of the kundt class is indeed equivalent to the distributional form of the solutions ( [ confppimp ] ) , and consequently to the continuous metric ( [ conti ] ) obtained by the `` cut and paste '' method .",
    "of course , the discontinuity in the complete transformation ( [ trans ] ) is mathematically delicate .",
    "however , in the special case of impulsive _",
    "pp_-waves it was rigorously analyzed using a general regularization procedure in @xcite . indeed it was shown within the geometric theory of nonlinear generalized functions @xcite ( based on colombeau algebras @xcite ) that ( [ trans ] ) is a ( generalized ) coordinate transformation , a result which puts the formal ( `` physical '' ) equivalence of both forms of impulsive spacetimes on a solid ground .      as demonstrated in 1971 by aichelburg and sexl in a classic paper @xcite , a specific impulsive gravitational _ pp_-wave solution ( in distributional form )",
    "can be obtained by boosting the schwarzschild black hole to the speed of light , while its mass is scaled to zero in an appropriate way .",
    "such a solution represents an axially - symmetric impulsive gravitational wave in minkowski space generated by a single _ null monopole _ particle moving along the axis .",

    "in this section we shift our focus on the main theme of this work , i.e. , the analysis of the geodesic equation in spacetimes with nonexpanding impulsive waves .",

    "geodesics in minkowski space with impulsive _ pp_-waves were discussed in many works , e.g.  in @xcite , all deriving that they are refracted straight lines with a jump in the @xmath119-direction",

    "in particular , existence and uniqueness results have been obtained in a space of generalized functions and the geodesics have been shown again to be broken straight lines .",
    "the benefit of the rigorous approach is the following : there it is _ proven _ that the geodesics really cross the impulsive wave rather than being reflected or trapped , a possibility which is ruled out a priori by the approaches using multiplications rules and other tricks from the gray area of ( linear ) distribution theory . as a consequence , in the rigorous approach _ geodesic completeness _ of impulsive _",
    "pp_-waves is proven  a result which has been recently generalized to models allowing for a non - flat wave surface @xcite .    in @xcite the geodesics in nonexpanding impulsive waves in all constant curvature backgrounds with any",
    "@xmath1 have been studied .",
    "they have been derived using the embedding of ( anti-)de  sitter spacetime into @xmath120-dimensional minkowski space as detailed in section [ subsec : emb ] .",
    "the advantage of this approach lies in the fact that it yields a system of differential equations which is distributionally accessible at all , if not rigorously .",
    "in particular , there is no square of @xmath121 , contrary to other `` direct '' approaches , such as those of @xcite which used the coordinates introduced in @xcite .",
    "the general results of @xcite in the special case @xmath2 reduce to those _ rigorously _ derived in @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , a desirable nonlinear distributional analysis of the geodesic equation in the @xmath3-cases is still subject to ongoing research .",
    "recently the continuous form of the metric has been employed in @xcite to derive the geodesics in impulsive _ pp_-waves . here",
    "the geodesic equation , which has a discontinuous right hand side , has been _ uniquely solved in the sense of carathodory_. in this way it has , in particular , been shown that the spacetimes are geodesically complete with the geodesics being _ continuously differentiable _ curves .",
    "this justifies the @xmath0-matching of the geodesics of the background to obtain the geodesics of the entire spacetime .",
    "in fact such an approach has been used in @xcite , as well as in @xcite for nonvanishing @xmath1 , and in @xcite for expanding impulsive waves .",
    "the analysis of @xcite is based on the fact that for _ pp_-waves the coordinate @xmath42 can be used as a parameter along the geodesics .",
    "however , this is no longer possible if @xmath28 , where the geodesic equations take the form of an autonomous system of odes with discontinuous right hand side . in this case carathodory s concept provides no advantage over the classical theory and is not applicable to the equations at hand .    on the other hand it was also recently shown in @xcite that the geodesic equations for any locally lipschitz continuous semi - riemannian metric possess solutions _ in the sense of filippov _ and that these geodesics in addition are continuously differentiable .",
    "filippov s solution concept @xcite is a general and nowadays widely applied approach ( e.g.  in nonsmooth mechanics , see @xcite ) and , for the convenience of the reader , we have collected its basics used in this work in appendix .",
    "since we will make use of this result in the following , we give its precise formulation :    ( ( * ? ? ?",

    ". then there exist filippov solutions of the geodesic equations which are @xmath124-curves .",
    "however , in general we can not expect the geodesic equation in locally lipschitz spacetimes to be _ uniquely _ solvable .",
    "the threshold for unique solvability of the geodesic equations is the regularity class @xmath125 , i.e. , the first derivatives of the metric being locally lipschitz .",
    "in fact , in this class classical ode - theory provides unique solvability of the geodesic equation with the geodesics being  @xmath126 .",
    "moreover , as has been recently shown @xcite , the exponential map retains maximal regularity . on the other hand there",
    "exist metrics in any hlder class @xmath127 , with @xmath128 , for which the initial value problem for the geodesic equation fails to be uniquely solvable . here",
    "we recall the following classical example due to @xcite for a @xmath124 ( hence , in particular , locally lipschitz ) riemannian metric .",
    "consider the line element @xmath129 on @xmath130 with the function @xmath131 .",
    "the corresponding geodesic equations then reduce to @xmath132 thus @xmath133 and @xmath134 are two distinct solutions starting at @xmath135 with initial velocity @xmath135 .    for our purpose it is worth to observe that these geodesics are classical solutions ( @xmath136 and they satisfy the differential equation everywhere ) so they are also filippov solutions .",
    "consequently in this case we have non - unique filippov solutions .",
    "however , in the case we are interested in , that is the continuous form of the metric for nonexpanding impulsive waves in all constant curvature backgrounds ( [ conti ] ) , the metric _ in addition _ to being locally lipschitz is also _ smooth off a null hypersurface_. in particular , it is piecewise smooth and in such a case uniqueness of the geodesics can indeed be established ( as we will see next ) , thereby justifying the @xmath0-matching procedure .      to formulate the result announced above we need some preparations .",
    "we consider a spacetime @xmath122 with _ locally lipschitz continuous _",

    "null hypersurface @xmath139 .",
    "by @xmath140 being totally geodesic we mean that every geodesic ( in the sense of filippov ) starting in @xmath140 and being initially tangential to @xmath140 stays ( initially ) in @xmath140 .",

    "the second fundamental form of @xmath140 vanishes ( in @xmath142 ) , 2 .",

    "note , however , that in the spacetimes we are dealing with we prove uniqueness of geodesics and so ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , and ( 3 ) become again equivalent .",
    "we want to rewrite the geodesic equation in _ first order form_. to this end we denote by @xmath143 some local spatial coordinates and introduce @xmath144 we assume that the geodesic equation for @xmath122 , as a first order system , has the form @xmath145 for @xmath146 labeling the components @xmath147 of @xmath148 in , and analogously for @xmath149 , @xmath150 , @xmath151 , @xmath152 , @xmath153 . here",

    "note that @xmath155 is lipschitz continuous and @xmath77 is discontinuous at @xmath157 , so by restricting ourselves to the form of the geodesic equation we allow only for non - smoothness in @xmath42 at @xmath157 given by a jump ( @xmath77 ) and possibly by ( higher order ) kinks ( @xmath158 , @xmath159 , etc . ) .",

    "existence follows from theorem [ thm - ex ] , since the metric is locally lipschitz continuous by assumption .",

    "<S> we study geodesics in the complete family of nonexpanding impulsive gravitational waves propagating in spaces of constant curvature , that is minkowski , de  sitter and anti - de  sitter universes . employing the continuous form of the metric we prove existence and uniqueness of continuously differentiable geodesics ( in the sense of filippov ) and use a @xmath0-matching procedure to explicitly derive their form . </S>"
