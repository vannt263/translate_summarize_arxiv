    "in particular we are able to calculate the critical group of the @xmath4-cones of the @xmath5-duplications of the path , the cycle , the complete graph , the bipartite complete graph with @xmath4 vertices in each partition , the bipartite complete graph with @xmath6 vertices minus a matching , etc . in the following ,",
