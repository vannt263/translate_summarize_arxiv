    "however there are many weak points of this conventional scale - setting method :    1 .",
    "although the infinite perturbative series @xmath10 summed to all orders is renormalization - scale independent , the scale dependence from @xmath5 and @xmath11 do not exactly cancel at finite order , leading to a renormalization scale ambiguity .",
    "the fixed - order estimate in the conventional procedure is also scheme dependent ; i.e. , different choice of renormalization scheme @xmath1 will lead to different theoretical estimates .",
    "this is the well - known renormalization scheme ambiguity  @xcite .",
    "3 .   the conventional scale choice can give unphysical results : for example , for the case of @xmath12-boson plus three - jet production at the hadronic colliders , taking @xmath6 to be the @xmath12-boson transverse energy , the conventional scale - setting method even predicts negative qcd cross - section at the next - to - leading - order ( nlo )  @xcite .",
    "4 .   as has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , taking an incorrect renormalization scale underestimates the top quark forward - backward asymmetry at the tevatron .",
    "it should be recalled that there is no ambiguity in setting the renormalization scale in qed . * in qed , the coupling @xmath13 is conventionally defined in the gell mann - low ( gm - l ) scheme  @xcite from the potential between heavy charges , and it is normalized at @xmath14 to the fine - structure constant @xmath15  @xcite . * due to the ward - takahashi identity  @xcite , the divergences in the vertex and fermion wavefunction corrections cancel , and the ultraviolet divergence associated with the vacuum polarization defines a natural scale for the coupling constant @xmath13 with @xmath16 being the squared momentum transfer for the photon propagator .",
    "this fact was first observed by gell - mann and low  @xcite ; i.e. , in the standard gm - l scheme , the renormalization scale is simply the virtuality of the exchanged photon .",
    "+ for example , the renormalization scale for the electron - muon elastic scattering based on one - photon exchange is the virtuality of the exchanged photon , i.e. @xmath17 .",
    "one can of course choose any initial renormalization scale @xmath18 for calculating the qed amplitude ; however , the final result will not depend on the choice of @xmath18 , since @xmath19 } \\ ; , \\label{qedsample}\\ ] ] where @xmath20}{[1-\\pi(t_0)]}\\ ] ] naturally sums all vacuum polarization contributions , both proper and improper , to the dressed photon propagator .",
    "( here @xmath21 is the sum of proper vacuum polarization insertions , subtracted at @xmath22 . ) the invariance of the result on the initial scale @xmath18 is the property used to derive the callan - symanzik equations  @xcite .",
    "there is , therefore , no reason to vary @xmath23 by a factor of @xmath24 or @xmath25 , since the photon virtuality @xmath26 is the unique , optimized scale in the gm - l scheme . *",
    "the renormalization scale in qed is unique in any scheme including dimensional regularization ; different schemes can be connected to the gm - l scheme by commensurate scale relations ( csrs )  @xcite , a topic which we discuss below .",

    "the convergence of the perturbative series is thus problematic using conventional scale - setting . for certain processes such as the top - quark pair production",

    "thus , to derive a dependable perturbative estimate , one evidently needs to do even higher order calculations .",
    "the conventional estimate shows a strong dependence on the choice of the renormalization scale @xmath6 .",
    "it is clearly artificial to guess a renormalization scale @xmath7 and to study its uncertainty by simply varying @xmath6 in the arbitrary range @xmath9 $ ] . why is the scale uncertainty estimated only by varying a factor of @xmath24 or @xmath25 , and not , say , @xmath31 times q ?",
    "for example , ref.@xcite shows that after including the first and second order corrections to several deep inelastic sum rules which are due to heavy flavor contributions , it is found that the effective scale @xmath32 , where the typical scale @xmath33 with @xmath34 being the corresponding heavy quark mass .",
    "+ moreover , sometimes , there are several choices for the typical momentum transfer of the process , all of which can be taken as the renormalization scale , such as the heavy - quark mass , the collision energy of the subprocess , etc .",
    "which invariant provides the correct theoretical estimate ? + using conventional scale - setting , there is no definite answer to these questions .",
    "one may argue that the correct renormalization scale for the fixed - order prediction can be decided by comparing with the experimental data , but this surely is process dependent and greatly depresses the predictive power of the pqcd theory .",

    "as we shall discuss , the rg based equations  @xcite which incorporate the scheme parameters provide a convenient way for estimating both the scale- and scheme- dependence of the qcd predictions for a physical process  @xcite . in this paper , we will utilize such rg based equations for a general discussion of the rg - invariance .",
