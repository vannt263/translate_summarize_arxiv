    "many mechanisms of the spatiotemporal variability of natural plankton populations are not known yet . pronounced physical patterns , such as thermoclines ,",

    "while many parameters and variables can be learned from standard oceanographic measurements of temperature , salinity , nutrients , and biomass concentrations of phytoplankton and zooplankton , now new technologies such as remote sensing are being developed for observing the ecosystem .",
    "measurements of the underwater light field are made with state - of - the - art instruments and used to calculate concentrations of phytoplankton biomass , such as chlorophyll , as well as other forms of organic matter .",
    "more recently , satellite remote sensing and detailed numerical simulations identify some spatial patterns including filaments , irregular patches , sharp gradients , and other complex structures involving a wide range of spatial scales and time scales by utilizing the species concentration  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows two pictures deriving from the field observation by the satellites remote sensing , where color gives us very useful information and ideas about the changes of chlorophyll concentrations in the two - dimensional spaces .",
    "the more pictures about the spatial patterns of the phytoplankton can be obtained from the web http://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov , such as the stripelike , spotted - like , clockwise - rotating ( or counterclockwise - rotating ) spiral waves , spatial chaotic patterns , etc .",
    "especially , in ref .",
    "@xcite from an observing system for monitoring the ecosystem is approached by posing five questions : how is the ecosystem changing ?",
    "what are the forcing factors causing it to change",
    "? how does the ecosystem respond to natural and human forces ?",
    "can we predict future changes ? and what are the consequences for stakeholders in our region ?        learning from historical records and from our field observations in refs .",
    "@xcite , one knows that the timing and magnitude of phytoplankton blooms vary significantly on interannual to longer timescales .",
    "for example , in some years , e.g. , 2002 , the spring bloom phytoplankton occurred in april , coinciding with vernal flowering on land , whereas in other years , e.g. , 1999 , the bloom occurred in february .",
    "although there are only a handful of dynamics states that phytoplankton populations may exhibit stable equilibrium , deterministic extinction , stable population oscillations , and irregular fluctuations , there is a long list of factors that may interact to determine the community dynamics , e.g , competition , predation , parasitism , mutualism , age , stage and genetic structure , spatial structure of the habitat , climate , physical and chemical parameters .",
    "thus , a key step in analyzing the community s dynamics is to untangle these mixtures of interacting factors and to identify their essential for the observed dynamics .",
    "especially , from the experimental plankton communities  @xcite [ rotifer - algal ] one knows that : first , the age structure of the predator populations is necessary to generate qualitatively correct predictions of population dynamics such as stability versus cycles .",
    "second , the rapid evolution of population , including the alga and rotifers , is regarded as critical processes occurring on the same time scale in the ecological dynamics , and learned that microcosms may not just serve as a means to check model s assumptions , but that the results of microcosm studies can lead to novel insights into the function of biological communities . from refs .",
    "@xcite , we know that the interannual variation in zooplankton and phytoplankton species might be the result of changes in climate , and the photosynthetic of the phytoplankton growth strongly depends on the intensity of the light .",
    "hence , these period factors are regarded as the external periodic forces in the plankton systems .",
    "the variances of species evolving in time and space may be well understood .    besides these periodic factors",
    ", there are many other stochastically factors causing phytoplankton - zooplankton blooms to transit extinction .",
    "for example , the effects arise from rivers pollution on the phytoplankton - zooplankton ecosystem is one of the ways that humans affect the marine ecosystem .",
    "large rivers are major mechanisms for nutrient delivery to the ocean .",
    "hence , the quality of river water affects freshwater ecosystems and oceanic food webs . away from this",
    ", the long term climatic variation also shows the stochastic factor for the ecological system [ see  @xcite for giving a review about this points ] . in the phytoplankton - zooplankton systems , the random fluctuations also are undeniably arising from either environmental variability or internal species . to quantify the relationship between fluctuations and species concentration with spatial degrees of freedom , the consideration of these fluctuations supposes to deal with noisy quantities whose variance might at times be a sizable fraction of their mean levels .",
    "for example , the birth and death processes of individuals are intrinsically fluctuations  @xcite , which become especially pronounced when the amount of individuals is small .",
    "the interaction between the oceanic zooplankton and fish , which are far from being uniformly distributed , also introduce randomness  @xcite .",
    "in addition , these processes can be regarded as parameter fluctuates irregularly with spaces and time .",
    "for example , phytoplankton production is effected by iron concentration , which can be elevated in surface water after rain  @xcite .",
    "these unavoidable fluctuations can also interact with the system s nonlinearities to render counterintuitive behavior , in which an increase in the noise level produces a more regular behavior  @xcite .",
    "now , it is natural to ask what are spatiotemporal behaviors of the spatially extended plankton system if these external periodic forces and the irregular fluctuation factors work on . especially , can the periodic oscillation retain to appear ? in order to understand the stochastically force , we give the short introduction of the noise application in the physics and biology .",
    "recently , research interest has shifted to the effects of noise in spatially extended system  @xcite .",
    "well - known examples in zero - dimensional ( ode ) systems are noise - induced transition  @xcite , stochastic resonance  @xcite , enhanced spatial synchronization  @xcite , and noise - sustained oscillations  @xcite [ the reader can read an overview written by f sagus in ref .",
    "more recently , effects of noise in spatially distributed systems , including noise - induced pattern formation  @xcite , noise - induced fronts  @xcite , etc , have been extended study by many communities . in these and other noise - related phenomena , multiplicative noise , which couples to the system state",
    "plays a very special role .",
    "however , prominent effect has been also found for additive noise .",
    "such influence has been observed in noise - induced pattern formation  @xcite .",
    "a recent report  @xcite demonstrated that additive noise which globally alternates between with two different monostable excitable dynamics yields pattern formation .",
    "meanwhile , in recent years several theoretical investigations have been done on noise - induced effects in population dynamics , see  @xcite .",
    "noise , such as that from the natural variability , are inevitably presented in these type of systems , but its effects have not yet been addressed completely . in this paper , we report resonant patterns and frequency locked oscillations induced by additive noise and external forces in phytoplankton - zooplankton systems , and take into account the interplay among noise , external forces , and diffusion processes . in the following ,",
    "we first give the spatially extended model and method we used , and then the describe our results .",
    "from the recent perspective of pascual  @xcite , the physical environments play an important role in the biota .",
    "if the climate sharply changes , the population abundance will change .",
    "especially , the spatiotemporal dynamics of global population abundance , such as aggregated over the whole space , can be approximated by mean - field - type equations in which the functional forms specifying the growth rates and interactions have been modified as power functions . and , the effect of interactions on local ( or individual scales ) can be represented implicitly by the changed form of the functions to describe interactions on global scales .",
    "we want to focus on the effects of a periodic varying and the stochastic fluctuation factors to the spatially extended phytoplankton and zooplankton model .",
    "following scheffer s minimal approach  @xcite and the previous analysis  @xcite , we study a two - variable phytoplankton and zooplankton spatial model involving time - periodic forces and the fluctuation term to describe the influence of spatial noisea spatial on pattern formation . the spatially extended model is written as    [ eq : ii2 ] @xmath0 @xmath1    where the parameters @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 refer to the previous works  @xcite on the dimensionless model   absence of periodic force and noise term . here",
    "@xmath10 and @xmath11 are scalar fields representing the concentrations of phytoplankton species and zooplankton species in the two - dimensional space .",
    "it must also be kept mind that the individuals of the population have not been at the same point in space at previous times , so they are a function of time .",
    "the periodic force is assumed to be sinusoidal with amplitude @xmath12 and frequency @xmath13 .",
    "the periodic force is considered as additive version for reason that toxins produced by different phytoplankton species has a significant role in shaping the dynamical behavior of marine plankton ecosystems  @xcite .",
    "the zooplankton population tries to avoid the areas where the concentration of phytoplankton is very large .",
    "the reason may be either dense concentration or the effect of toxic substance released by phytoplankton , of course including the others factor as introduced in previous section , such as human action , nature sharp changing - red tides and localized outbreaks and occur in coastal water and fronts  @xcite .",
    "buskey and stockwell  @xcite have shown in their field study that macro- and meso - zooplankton populations are reduced during the blooms of chrysophyte ( aureococcus anophagefferens ) .",
    "these factors are not directly correlated with species internal parameters , so that the @xmath14 be added in the equation instead of @xmath15 .",
    "such consideration is meaningful in the biology systems ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in eq .",
    ", the stochastic factors are taken into account as the term , @xmath16 .",
    "of course , due to the coupling , the noise in eq .   will have its influence on eq .   as well .",
    "the noise term @xmath16 is introduced additively in space and time , which is the ornstein - uhlenbech process that obeys the following stochastic partial differential equation  @xcite : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a gaussian white noise with zero mean and correlation , @xmath19 the colored noise @xmath16 , which is temporally correlated and white in space , satisfies @xmath20 where @xmath21 controls the temporal correlation , and @xmath22 measures the noise intensity .    in this work ,",
    "we rely on numerical simulations of the model of eqs .   and  .",
    "we here consider spatiotemporal evolution of this system with space white noise and colored noise evolving in time when the system lies within the regime of self - sustained hopf oscillation .",
    "note that the explicit form of the noise term represents only on the fluctuating recruitment rate ( or death rate ) has been studied by malchow et al  @xcite , in which the parameter @xmath5 only is regarded as noise form , i.e. , @xmath23 , @xmath24 denotes gaussian white noise . for the absence of the external periodic forces and colored noise , hopf instability occurs and spatially homogeneous oscillation comes up when the parameter @xmath9 less than the critical value @xmath25 [ see appendix a ] whose value depends on the other parameters . moreover , from previous analysis and numerical simulations  @xcite show that spiral waves structure exists in the two - dimensional space and the spatiotemporal chaos will emerge through its far - field breakup when the parameter @xmath9 within the mixed domain of the hopf - turing instability , but the parameters are outside the turing instability domain in present paper [ see appendix a for a simple analysis ] .",
    "in fact , from recent perspective that the 2:1 resonance phenomena on the spiral wave may will appear when the system undergos saddle - node or hopf bifurcation  @xcite .",
    "in other words , the temporal period of the bifurcation patterns is twice the period of the primary spiral , i.e. , the hopf frequency @xmath26 needs to be in a 2:1 resonance with the rotation frequency of the spiral wave .",
    "however , here we show that the system also exhibits spatiotemporal chaos patterns and the 4:1 and 1:1 resonances with the period of the external forces when fluctuations and periodic forces are considered . except when it explicitly is pointed out , we take parameters @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 throughout this paper .",

    "extensive testing was performed through numerical simulations to the described model   and the results are shown this section . in simulation , zero - flux boundary conditions are used and time step @xmath35 time unit . the space step @xmath36 length unit and the grid sizes in the evolutional simulations are @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "the fourier transform method is used for the deterministic part in eq .  .",
    "on the discrete square lattices , the stochastic partial differential eq .",
    "is integrated numerically by applying the euler method .",
    "several different discrete methods ( simple euler , runge - kutta , and fourier transform ) was checked , and the results indicate that fourier transform accurately approximates solutions of eq .  . on the other hand ,",
    "the fourier method offers the speed advantage over other numerical methods .",
