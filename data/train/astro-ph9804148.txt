    "the question of whether or not magnetic monopoles exist has intrigued theorists and experimentalists for a long time @xcite . in 1974 , thooft @xcite and polyakov @xcite independently showed that magnetic monopoles always appear as stable topological entities in any grand unified theory ( gut ) that breaks down to electromagnetism . hence ,",
    "if grand unified theories are shown to be correct , monopoles of mass in the range @xmath10 - @xmath11 gev should exist .",
    "rubakov @xcite and callan @xcite calculated that these monopoles catalyze nucleon decay with a cross section characteristic of strong interactions , @xmath12 @xmath13 .",
    "the abundance of these monopoles is an open question .",
    "the kibble mechanism predicts roughly one monopole per horizon volume at the time of the grand unified phase transition .",
    "however , this estimate provides a severe overabundance of the number of monopoles : monopoles overclose the universe by many orders of magnitude .",
    "instead an inflationary epoch @xcite may reduce their density in the universe .",
    "then the present abundance is difficult to estimate .",
    "a clue for experimentalists about what monopole flux to expect can be provided by astrophysics .",
    "the parker bound @xcite on the flux of monopoles was obtained by requiring survival of @xmath14 g magnetic fields observed in our galaxy and gave @xmath15 cm@xmath2 sr@xmath3 sec@xmath3 .",
    "subsequent improvements on this work include consideration of the monopole velocities @xcite due to acceleration by the galactic magnetic field .",
    "another improvement is the extended parker bound , which required survival of a smaller seed magnetic field in the early period of the galaxy @xcite : @xmath17 cm@xmath2 s@xmath3 sr@xmath3 .",
    "another class of methods for determination of the monopole flux is based on the hypothesis that gut monopoles give rise to the catalysis of nucleon decay .",
    "the basic idea is that monopoles traveling through the galaxy lose enough energy to be captured in an object ( e.q .",
    "white dwarfs , neutron stars , etc . ) where they subsequently catalyze nucleon decay .",
    "the energy produced by the nucleon decay heats up the object and results in a flux of photons from the surface of the object .",
    "one can then compare this predicted luminosity with what is actually observed .",
    "one must ensure that the monopoles would not make the object brighter than what is seen .",
    "the coolest star ( or other object ) seen provides the tightest limit on the monopole flux .",
    "if there were more monopoles than allowed by the bound , then the dimmest star observed could not exist .",
    "several authors have carried out this kind of analysis in neutron stars @xcite , nearby pulsar and white dwarfs .",
    "the strongest bound was obtained from consideration of the catalysis process in psr 1929 + 10 , an old pulsar @xcite . from this pulsar ,",
    "the bound on the product of monopole flux times cross section for catalysis is @xmath1cm@xmath2sr@xmath3sec@xmath18 @xmath19 .",
    "if one includes the monopoles captured by the main sequence progenitor of the white dwarf , this bound becomes even tighter @xcite , @xmath1cm@xmath2 sr@xmath3 sec@xmath20 @xmath13 @xmath21 .",
    "the consideration of monopole dynamics inside superconducting neutron - star cores leads to a bound @xmath22 cm@xmath2 sr@xmath3 s@xmath3 @xcite , where @xmath23 is the age ( in @xmath24 years ) of the pulsar s present magnetic field .    as neutron stars are the densest astrophysical objects observed , they give rise to the tightest catalysis bounds .",
    "however , there is a certain amount of uncertainty due to the fact that the interiors of neutron stars are not well understood .",
    "for example , neutron stars can have very large magnetic fields @xmath25 g of unknown topology , and the motion of magnetic monopoles inside the neutron star would undoubtedly be affected by these magnetic fields .",
    "in addition neutron star interiors may contain pion condensates , again with uncertain effects on the monopoles .",
    "because of the uncertainties with neutron star interiors , we turn to the next densest astrophysical objects in the universe , white dwarfs . these stellar remnants are far better understood .",
    "the flux limits obtained from consideration of the catalysis process in white dwarfs are therefore important .",
    "previously freese @xcite considered monopole catalyzed nucleon decay in white dwarfs . by comparing with the lowest luminosity white dwarf that had been seen at that time , she obtained a limit    @xmath26    the present work is motivated by new observational data of cool white dwarfs @xcite .",
    "in particular , bergeron , ruiz , and leggett found a white dwarf 1136 - 286 ( eso 439 - 26 ) with luminosity @xmath27 ; this is the dimmest white dwarf observed to date .",
    "we use the measured luminosities of old white dwarfs to constrain the radiation due to monopole - catalyzed nucleon decay and thus to obtain an upper limit to the average flux of monopoles in the galaxy . since a white dwarf with luminosity @xmath27",
    "is observed today , we know that the monopole - induced contribution to the white dwarf luminosity can not exceed this value .",
    "these new data improve the limit on the monopole abundance due to catalysis in white dwarfs @xcite by roughly two orders of magnitude .",
    "of course , as dimmer white dwarfs are found , the bound will continue to get more restrictive .    a monopole flux saturating this bound would keep the white dwarfs at luminosities at least this great and would lead to the prediction that no cooler white dwarfs will be found .",
    "as we will discuss , if it were indeed true that monopoles are keeping dwarfs hot , one would expect a different dependence of white dwarf luminosity on mass than expected in the standard model .",
    "we shall explicitly indicate the dependence of our results on various parameters .",
    "we will parametrize the properties of the white dwarf in terms of typical values from observations : for the mass , @xmath28 , for the radius @xmath29 cm , and for the average density @xmath30 g @xmath31 .",
    "the central density is about an order of magnitude higher , @xmath32 g @xmath33 .",
    "rubakov @xcite estimated the product of cross section for catalysis and relative velocity @xmath34 of the monopole and nucleon to be constant : @xmath35 @xmath13 .",
    "( throughout , we take @xmath36 . ) for the thermal nucleon velocities expected inside a carbon and oxygen white dwarfs , @xmath37 , suppression effects may reduce the cross section by a factor of @xmath38 @xcite , and so we include this factor . in white dwarfs made of helium",
    "the suppression effects would be less effective @xmath39 , and all the monopole flux bounds would be an order of magnitude stronger .",
    "as we noted in the introduction , monopole - catalyzed nucleon decay caused by the monopoles captured in white dwarfs can provide an additional internal heat source for the star .",
    "our evaluation of the monopole flux is based on the observed luminosity of the white dwarfs and estimation of the number of monopoles trapped inside the stars .",
    "as a monopole passes through a white dwarf , it loses energy and is captured .",
    "electronic interactions are considered to be the primary source of energy loss for the monopoles , with @xcite , @xcite , @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the electron density , the fermi momentum of the electrons @xmath42mev , @xmath43 , @xmath44 is the mean free path of the electron , @xmath45 is the density of the white dwarf ( in @xmath46 ) , and @xmath47 is the velocity of the monopole as it passes through the white dwarf .",
    "as was shown in @xcite , a white dwarf accumulates almost all the monopoles with @xmath48 gev incident upon it .",
    "the number of monopoles captured by a white dwarf exposed to a monopole flux @xmath49cm@xmath2 @xmath50 sr@xmath51 for a time @xmath52 yr is given by    @xmath53    where @xmath54 $ ] is the capture area , @xmath55 is the monopole velocity and @xmath56 .    once captured , the monopoles sink to the center of the white dwarf . in calculating the luminosity from catalyzed nucleon decay",
    ", we use the central density of the white dwarf .",
    "we are justified in doing this since the time for the monopole to fall ( from rest ) into the center is @xmath57 , as has been calculated @xcite by treating the motion of the monopoles as a harmonic oscillator with a @xmath58 damping term .",
    "we find the luminosity from catalyzed nucleon decay per monopole :    @xmath59    then the total luminosity of a white dwarf due to a monopole - catalyzed nucleon decay is    @xmath60    where @xmath61 .    from the stefan - boltzman law , @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the stefan - boltzman constant",
    ", we can find the blackbody temperature corresponding to this luminosity ,    @xmath64    white dwarfs cool as they age .",
    "the cooling time is a function of the white dwarf mass and composition . for white dwarf 1136 - 286",
    ", we use the mass and composition provided by the observers @xcite .",
    "the observed energy distributions are obtained from a combination of both optical bvri and infrared hjk photometric data and used to derive both the effective temperature and the atmospheric composition of the star .",
    "this white dwarf is seen to have a helium atmosphere .",
    "stellar masses were also obtained with trigonometric parallax .",
    "bergeron , ruiz , and leggett @xcite derive @xmath65 for wd 1136 - 286 . then from measurements of the luminosity and @xmath66 , eqn .",
    "( 6 ) implies that the radius is @xmath67 cm .",
    "we also use two different cooling models .",
    "first we use the white dwarf cooling theory from the calculations of segretain et al .",
    "@xcite , as communicated by g. chabrier .",
    "the segretain et al .",
    "@xcite model accounts for gravitational energy release due to carbon - oxygen differentiation at crystallization .",
    "this treatment of crystallization yields significantly longer white dwarf cooling times , which in turn imply an older age for any particular white dwarf .",
    "these white dwarf models correspond to a mass sequence of initially unstratified white dwarfs composed of equal parts carbon and oxygen , with helium atmospheres . with these models ,",
    "the age of white dwarf 1136 - 286 is 9.63 gyr . for comparison",
    "we also use the cooling curves of wood @xcite which do not include chemical fractionation .",
    "chemical fractionation provides an additional source of energy to be radiated away ; thus models that lack it cool faster . with the wood cooling models , the ages of white dwarfs are somewhat younger .",
    "hence these models give younger white dwarfs that accumulate somewhat fewer monopoles and provide somewhat less restrictive bounds . with the wood cooling curve , the age of white dwarf 1136 - 286 is 6.47 gyr . to illustrate the uncertainty we provide flux bounds using both possible ages , but note that the discrepancy is not very great .",
    "the cooling models discussed above do not yet have an additional heat source due to monopoles .",
    "if white dwarfs have indeed been accumulating monopoles , then the monopole contribution to the luminosity increases linearly in time , and monopole catalyzed nucleon decay will eventually become the dominant source of luminosity .",
    "the minimum value of the total luminosity must be at least as low as @xmath68 , since white dwarf wd 1136 - 286 with this luminosity has been observed to exist . using the mass and radius discussed previously for this white dwarf , we then find from equations ( 3 - 5 ) that @xmath69    with the cooling curves of segretain et al . , which include the effects of chemical fractionation ,",
    "the age for this particular white dwarf wd 1136 - 286 is given to be 9.63 gyr as mentioned above .",
    "we find a flux bound    @xmath70    with the wood @xcite cooling curves , the age of the white dwarf is 6.47 gyr as mentioned above",
    ". then equation ( 6 ) corresponds to a flux bound    @xmath71    this bound using the wood cooling curves is less restrictive than the one obtained using the segretain et al . cooling curves .",
    "hence , to be conservative , in figure 1 we plot the flux bound of eq .",
    "note that the monopole velocities have been determined as a function of monopole mass by the following equation : @xmath72 for monopole mass @xmath73 gev and @xmath74 for monopoles with mass greater or equal to @xmath7 gev @xcite .",
    "thus the flux bound is flat for monopole masses greater than @xmath7 gev and drops as m@xmath3 for smaller masses .",
    "this behavior can be seen in figure 1 .",
    "if the monopole flux saturates the bound in equations ( 8) and ( 9 ) , the heat release due to monopole - catalyzed nucleon decay would explain the dearth of white dwarfs with luminosity @xmath75 .",
    "that is , monopoles may be keeping white dwarfs hot .",
    "note that the white dwarf luminosity due to monopole catalyzed nucleon decay scales as @xmath76 .",
    "if the luminosity of the coolest objects we see today is in fact due primarily to the contribution from monopoles , then one would in principle be able to see this dependence on white dwarf mass .",
    "however , one would need to be able to independently measure the white dwarf luminosity , mass , and age in order to test this hypothesis .    in an earlier paper freese @xcite checked that the presence of monopoles did not drastically affect the properties of the white dwarf in any way .",
    "a usual white dwarf is an isothermal , electron degenerate object surrounded by a very thin radiative envelope .",
    "the primary mechanism of heat transfer through the body of the star is conduction . in the presence of monopoles",
    "the white dwarf remains essentially isothermal , with a radiative envelope , conductive main body , and convective core so that one may conclude that monopoles have a negligible effect on the overall structure of white dwarfs ( for more details see @xcite ) .",
    "_ monopole / antimonopole annihilation : _ as discussed in freese @xcite , monopole - antimonopole annihilation has no effect on the flux bound obtained in equations ( 8) and ( 9 ) .",
    "there it was shown that , if the above flux bounds are satisfied , the number of monopoles accumulating inside the white dwarf never reaches a sufficient abundance for annihilation to become significant .",
    "during its main sequence period the progenitor of the white dwarf may also have captured a significant number of monopoles .",
    "these additional monopoles will lead to an even tighter bound on the monopole flux . in order to estimate the number of monopoles captured by the main sequence progenitor , we must determine its mass . unfortunately , the transformation from main sequence mass to white dwarf mass is somewhat uncertain , as discussed by wood @xcite .",
    "here we use @xmath77 , where @xmath78 and @xmath79 . for white dwarf 1136 - 286 with mass @xmath80",
    ", we find progenitor mass @xmath81 .    as a monopole passes through a ms star , it loses energy .",
    "if it loses all its initial kinetic energy ( i.e. its energy infinitely far from the star ) , it is captured by the star . since the energy loss increases with decreasing impact parameter , the number of monopoles captured by a ms star exposed to a monopole flux f for a time @xmath82 is just the number incident upon the star with surface impact parameter less than some critical value",
    ", @xmath83 : @xmath84 f \\tau_{ms},\\ ] ] where @xmath85 is the monopole velocity far from the star and @xmath86 is the escape velocity from the star .",
    "frieman , freese , and turner @xcite previously calculated numerically the critical impact parameter for capture .",
    "we use those results here should be somewhat larger than what was calculated by frieman , freese , and turner @xcite .",
    "for example , for the case where @xmath87 ( for a 9 @xmath88 star ) , rough analytic estimates indicate that the modified value of @xmath83 is roughly given by @xmath89 .",
    "as the calculations of @xcite are numerical and the difference is very small , we will continue to use the prior results of @xcite .",
    "in fact , if one were to use the newer value of @xmath83 , the flux bounds would be somewhat tighter . ] . given the value of @xmath83 , we can substitute it into the previous equation ( 11 ) to obtain the number of monopoles captured by the main sequence progenitor .",
    "the sum of monopoles captured by the progenitor plus those captured by the white dwarf can not exceed the maximum number allowed in equation ( 7 ) , so that we obtain a new flux bound . again , we have taken monopole velocities to be @xmath72 for monopole mass @xmath73 gev and @xmath74 for monopoles with mass greater or equal to @xmath7 gev @xcite . the inclusion of monopoles captured by the progenitor of the white dwarf results in a bound on monopole flux that is another order of magnitude lower .",
    "we have evaluated the new bound for both white dwarf cooling models . in table 1 , we have recorded , as a function of monopole mass , the value of @xmath90 , the number of monopoles captured by the progenitor and white dwarf , and the resultant flux bound . the flux bound is plotted in figure 1 .",
    "the flux bound is most restrictive for @xmath91 gev .",
    "one can understand the reason for the weaker flux bounds for masses greater and less than @xmath7 gev as follows : for masses less than this , it is the increasing monopole velocity as a function of decreasing monopole mass that drives the flux bound to become weaker for smaller mass .",
    "for masses @xmath92 gev , the factor @xmath93 $ ] in eq .",
    "( 10 ) is dominated by the second term @xmath94 . as the monopole mass decreases below @xmath7 gev , the monopole velocity increases , the term @xmath94 decreases , so that in eq .",
    "( 10 ) the monopole flux can increase and still maintain the same number of monopoles in the star and hence the same luminosity .",
    "eventually , when the mass drops to @xmath95 gev , the first term , @xmath96 , starts to dominate in the factor @xmath97 $ ] , so that the monopole velocity becomes unimportant and the curve becomes more and more flat with decreasing monopole mass .",
    "this behavior can be seen in figure 1 . for monopole masses greater than @xmath7 gev ,",
    "the flux bound also becomes weaker , this time as a function of increasing mass .",
    "the reason for this is as follows .",
    "these monopoles all move with the virial velocity of the galaxy @xmath98 .",
    "the heavier the monopole , the harder it is to stop . hence @xmath83 becomes smaller for heavier masses .",
    "thus a larger monopole flux can be accomodated in eq .",
    "( 10 ) to still obtain the same number of monopoles in the star .",
    "we also note that the dependence on monopole mass of flux bounds due to catalysis in neutron stars with main sequence accretion has previously been calculated incorrectly . in the past",
    "the bound due to catalysis in psr 1929 + 10 with main sequence accretion has been stated as @xcite @xmath9 cm @xmath2 s@xmath3 sr@xmath3 . as discussed in the previous paragraph",
    ", the velocity dependence of monopoles of different masses determines the shape of the curve of flux bounds as a function of monopole mass . as can be seen in table 1 and figure 1 ,",
    "the correct bounds are somewhat weaker for monopole mass other than @xmath7 gev because of the faster velocities of monopoles with smaller masses and the lower critical impact parameter for monopoles with larger masses . in obtaining the numbers ,",
    "we have assumed a main sequence progenitor of 9 @xmath88 .",
    "then the number of monopoles captured by the main sequence progenitor of the neutron star is the same as the number of monopoles captured by the white dwarf considered in this paper .",
    "figure 1 shows a plot of several monopole bounds : the parker bound , the extended parker bound , neutron star bounds , and the new white dwarf bound with and without main sequence capture . in the plots we have used the wood cooling curves to be conservative .",
    "we have found that consideration of newly observed white dwarf 1136 - 286 with luminosity @xmath99 and with new calculations of white dwarf cooling curves leads to a bound on the monopole flux that is two orders of magnitude lower than previous bounds due to catalysis in white dwarfs .",
    "the new bound is @xmath100 cm @xmath2 s@xmath3 sr@xmath3 for the segretain @xcite ( wood @xcite ) cooling curves respectively , where @xmath5 is the monopole velocity",

    "flux bounds for other monopole masses and parameters are given in table 1 .",

    "we also showed that the dependence on monopole mass of flux bounds due to catalysis in neutron stars with main sequence accretion has previously been calculated incorrectly .",
