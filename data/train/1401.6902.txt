    "the noncommutativity of space - time coordinates was first suggested by heisenberg  @xcite as a way to regulate the uv divergences present in the perturbative approach of quantum field theory . by this idea ,",
    "the noncommutativity would implement an uncertainty relation to the space - time coordinates @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is suggested to be of order of planck length squared @xmath5 ( @xmath6 cm ) , introducing a minimum length , meaning that no localization is possible below such scale .",
    "therefore , this minimum length would be taken as a natural uv cutoff accordingly to the heisenberg s uncertainty principle ( @xmath7 ) . the first paper on noncommutative field theory ( ncft )",
    "was published in 1947  @xcite , but due to the success of the renormalization procedure this idea was forgotten until the 1990 s , when it was discovered that ncfts are obtained as low energy limit of a string theory in the presence of a kalb - ramond field  @xcite . another current motivation to study ncfts is related to the  space - time foam \" , i.e. , at planck length scale the space - time loses its smoothness and should involve quantum fluctuations of geometry and topology  @xcite . the formulation of a ncft would be a simpler way to implement such ideas .",
    "ncfts are constructed from conventional field theories by the replacement of the ordinary product by a noncommutative one , thus all the products between fields are performed with the moyal product  @xcite @xmath8g(x)}\\ ] ]    where @xmath9 are space - time indices and @xmath10 is the dimension of the space - time . in the simplest case",
    ", @xmath4 is chosen to be an antisymmetric constant matrix .",
    "even though the noncommutativity of the space - time coordinates was first proposed to improve the uv behavior of perturbative expansion in quantum field theory , noncommutative extensions of the conventional field theory models are suitable to present the dangerous uv / ir mixing @xcite , that is the transmutation of part of the uv divergence of the original theory into an ir divergent behavior in its noncommutative counterpart , which could invalidate the perturbative expansion in a ncft . a possible approach to avoid such issue",
    "is to construct noncommutative models from less uv divergent field theories .",
    "it is well - known that supersymmetry improve uv behavior of the field theories due to cancellations of higher order uv divergences among bosonic and fermionic contributions of the loop integrals .",
    "therefore , supersymmetric models are natural candidates to define consistent ncfts that are free of uv / ir mixing  @xcite , where the noncommutative wess - zumino model is a remarkable example  @xcite .    in recent years , three - dimensional gauge theories have been intensely discussed in the literature because they are candidates to describe @xmath11 branes  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the three - dimensional chern  simons theory could be related to a topological string theory in six dimensions  @xcite .",
    "in addition , it was suggested that several @xmath12 three - dimensional supersymmetric @xmath1 chern - simons - matter models are dual to open or closed string theories in @xmath13 in the large @xmath14 limit  @xcite , and its effective ( super)potential has been evaluated in several approximations  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "non - abelian @xmath1 gauge field theories defined in the ordinary space - time in the large @xmath14 approximation are dual to noncommutative abelian gauge theories in the large @xmath15 limit  @xcite .",
    "this last duality suggests that the @xmath12 noncommutative 3d abelian chern - simons - matter models could also be related to string theories in @xmath13 , being possible candidates to describe @xmath11 branes .",

    "some final remarks are done in sec .",
    "in order to obtain the action for the @xmath16 noncommutative @xmath1 chern - simons theory , we start by writing the action for the @xmath17 supersymmetric abelian chern - simons theory in the ( usual ) @xmath0 superspace : @xmath18 where @xmath19 are the supercoordinates , @xmath20 is the so - called prepotential ( a scalar superfield that describes the gauge multiplet ) and @xmath21 is the superfield strength @xmath22    according to the notations and conventions of  @xcite , which we follow here .",
    "the equation of motion derived from this action is obtained through the variation of @xmath23 with respect to @xmath24 @xmath25    now , let us consider the noncommutative non - abelian case .",
    "the lifting from the usual model to the noncommutative one is performed by the replacement of ll the products between fields by the moyal one eq.([moyal ] ) . since @xmath26 in general , we will have to the superfield strength an structure similar to the non - abelian commutative case even in a noncommutative abelian model .",
    "so , for the noncommutative non - abelian theory , the superfield strength is defined by @xmath27    where @xmath28 , with @xmath29 being a non - abelian superfield ( @xmath30 are the @xmath1 group generators ) .",
    "we claim that the equation of motion will have the same form as the commutative case ( @xmath31 ) only replacing ( [ w ] ) by ( [ ncw ] ) . in order to have this",
    ", the variation of the ( still unknown ) noncommutative action must be @xmath32    ( when integrated , the moyal product has a ciclic symmetry and when there are only two fields one may consider an ordinary commutative product , but in the action above we decided to write the star explicitly to remind us we are dealing with the noncommutative case ) .",

    "see nishino and gates in @xcite for an example where one does not specify the dependence on @xmath37 , so that @xmath41 is an arbitrary function of @xmath37 , but still satisfying ( [ ncbc ] ) .",
    "see also @xcite for mathematical aspects of this so - called `` vainberg method '' .    with the choice @xmath40 , we may parametrize the variation using @xmath37 and take variations of the type @xmath42 , so that equation ( [ ncfunctionaleq ] ) becomes an ordinary differential equation for the hatted variables @xmath43 because of conditions ( [ ncbc ] ) , we have @xmath44 and @xmath45 and then we have @xmath46 since @xmath37 is a dummy integration variable , the action does not depend on this additional parameter @xmath37 .",
    "its final form in terms of the prepotential @xmath24 is @xmath47    it is not possible to perform the integral on @xmath37 exactly , since it is highly non - linear on @xmath24 . to find the first terms , write @xmath48",

    "the matter is described by complex scalar superfields , @xmath53 and @xmath54 , and the coupling of matter with chern - simons superfield is performed in the same way as the non - abelian case in four dimensions , and so the action in noncommutative space - time is @xmath55+\\bar\\phi * e^{gv}*\\phi \\big{\\}}~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    now , we will proceed as in ref.@xcite to obtain the action for the @xmath16 three - dimensional noncommutative supersymmetric chern - simons - matter model ( scsm ) written in terms of @xmath56 superfields .",

    "we know that each super - derivative operator @xmath10 contribute with a power one - half of momentum to a given diagram , therefore these operators contribute with a factor of @xmath102 to @xmath94 , and we see that each propagator of the model behaves like @xmath103 in momentum scale , contributing with a factor of @xmath98 .",
    "the vertices @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 , which possess a derivative @xmath10 , contribute with a factor of @xmath102 .",

    "it is easy to see that any diagram with more than four external superfields are uv finite .",
    "linear divergences can appear in the self - energy diagrams of @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "actually , we will show in the next section that these diagrams are uv finite and free of uv / ir mixing at one - loop order .",
    "moreover , the self - energy diagrams to the @xmath123 superfield is protected by the gauge symmetry , therefore they have to present at least @xmath96 derivatives applied to the external legs , like a chern - simons term @xmath124 , still allowing a logarithmic uv divergence .",
    "but the extended supersymmetry @xmath16 protects this term from loop corrections , so the minor number of @xmath10 s applied in the external legs allowed in self - energy diagrams to the gauge superfied is @xmath125 ( generating a maxwell - like term @xmath126 ) , turning such process uv finite and free of uv / ir mixing to all loops .",
    "a similar argument can be used to fix the uv behavior of the matter superfield self - energy diagrams .",
    "the extended supersymmetry @xmath16 and the superconformal invariance protect the such processes from mass renormalization , only allowing a wave function one . therefore to @xmath122 self - energy diagrams we have to consider at least two @xmath10 s applied to the external legs , consequently only a logarithmic divergence is allowed in such processes .",
    "logarithmic divergences at one - loop order in three - dimensional space - time should appear as an odd power of the integration momentum in the numerator , e.g. @xmath127 , which is obviously vanishing .",
    "therefore , at one - loop level , any diagram with more than two external legs are uv finite .",
    "another possibility of logarithmic uv divergences comes from the three and four - point functions of the gauge superfield , as @xmath128 and @xmath129 , and the four - point functions of the matter superfield @xmath130 .",
    "since the logarithmic divergences are absent at one - loop order , such divergences can only occur in higher orders in the perturbative expansion .",

    "next section we will show how the linear uv divergences are cancelled in feynman graphs at one - loop order involving two external legs of matter and gauge superfields , result which suggests that the noncommutative @xmath16 chern - simons - matter model is free of uv / ir mixing .",

    "an interesting development of our analysis would be to study the ward identities in order to see if the finiteness of the chern - simons sector implies the finiteness of the full model .",
    "another further direction has to do with the way we introduced the noncommutativity to our supersymmetric model .",

    "a more general approach would be to consider a suitable generalized moyal product for the superfields involving the full supercoordinates such that a nonanticommutativity is implied to the fermionic variable : @xmath151    as noted in the introduction to our work , noncommutativity appears naturally as a low limit of string theory . we should recall that this nonanticommutativity is also indicated by string theory as shown in a later paper by seiberg  @xcite .",
