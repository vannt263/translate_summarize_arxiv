    "the born - infeld ( bi ) theory was originally designed to overcome the infinity problem of a point charge source in the standard maxwell electromagnetism@xcite . over the years",
    "this idea was almost forgotten until string theory revealed the existence of certain class of extended objects named @xmath0-branes which brought altogether a revival of the original bi proposal@xcite .",
    "these extended objects provide explicit realizations of several interesting phenomena in a wide range of physical theories at the tiniest scales , mainly in modern non - perturbative string theory .",
    "the simplest action governing the dynamics of @xmath0-branes is the well known dirac - born - infeld ( dbi ) action which contains the square root of the determinant of a metric constructed with the induced metric on the worldvolume swept out by the @xmath0-brane and the electromagnetic field strenght .",
    "this action has given rise to an intense research and we have witnessed a growing development of the subject which has triggered a variety of suggestions akin to it . a related geometrical construction ignoring electromagnetism altogether but instead including higher order curvature terms in string theory was proposed long time ago by lindstrom",
    "_ et al_@xcite .",
    "there , such structure involves the determinant of a metric which is now the sum of the induced metric and a symmetric tensor built from the extrinsic curvature of the worldsheet swept out by the string .",
    "this effective bi type model suffers however severe drawbacks mainly due to its second order derivative dependance and in consequence has not received much attention .",
    "needless to say , these are elegant gravitational theories defined on surfaces , with a determinant lagrangian density form , which still deserve a careful analysis because of their attractive geometrical properties .",
    "this type of theories adapted to branes is the subject we will focus on this work .",
    "as is by now well known in the brane context , despite its many successes , there are many contexts where the dirac - nambu - goto ( dng ) action is not adequate and it is natural to consider models that depend on higher derivatives of the embedding variables through the extrinsic curvature of the worldvolume swept out by the brane . the most general field theoretical effective action governing the dynamics of a brane results in an expansion constructed out of the geometrical scalars of its worldvolume@xcite .",
    "these extrinsic curvature correction terms have found extensive use in concrete applications .",
    "for instance , the addition of a rigidity term in an effective action for stringy qcd@xcite , the systematic approximation schemes that arise in expansions in the thickness of topological defects@xcite , or in actions appearing in the braneworld scenarios@xcite , to mention some . therefore , there is no field theoretical reason that does not preclude the possibility of consider an alternative expansion but , enclosed now in a geometrical bi type action solely , without introducing electromagnetism .    the mechanical content of an extended object is captured by its geometrical degrees of freedom where the conserved stress tensor plays a very important role .",
    "this determines the dynamics of the extended object@xcite thus providing a very powerful geometrical tool for the description of deformations of branes . on physical grounds",
    "such stress tensor is merely the momentum density of the brane . on the one hand ,",
    "the dependance on the independent variables of the effective model governing the evolution of the brane is the first step to be recognized in order to perform a variational process .",
    "one then proceed in the usual way to obtain the dynamical laws that the system must obey . on the other hand ,",
    "the standard variational process for a second order field theory is a non - trivial task which gives rise to annoying computations in order to derive equations of motion and it is sharply elaborated for determinant theories .",
    "certainly this unpleasant fact appears to be a great difficulty but this is not the road we take here . to bypass this field theoretical problem",
    "we follow an original strategy for reaching geometrical and physical information , based in an auxiliary variables method ( avm ) introduced by guven in order to describe fluctuating surfaces@xcite .",
    "the cornerstone in this approach consists of promoting inherent geometrical quantities , defined on the worldvolume , to play the role of auxiliary variables , distributing the original deformation of the embedding variables among the auxiliary variables .",
    "the response of the action to a deformation of its worldvolume reflects in the conservation of the stress tensor .",
    "in this paper , equipped with modern variational techniques , we provide the dynamical information supplied by the conserved stress tensor for bi type brane theories .",
    "we examine mainly second order brane theories that depend on the extrinsic curvature , which possess a determinant structure .",
    "we would like to point out that , with a suitable choice of constraints , the conserved stress tensor and the field equations are obtained effortless through the use of the avm , elucidating also the geometrical nature of bi type brane models .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section 2 , in order to gain insight into the avm for bi objects , we adapt it to study the well known @xmath0-brane dynamics .",
    "we obtain with no effort the mechanical content of @xmath0-branes@xcite .",
    "we thus pave the way to the application of the avm to more complex bi type theories . in section 3",
    "we follow closely the avm introduced by guven@xcite in order to study the geometrical properties of a rigid bi action for branes , originally proposed in the string theory context@xcite . by contrast , the resulting equations of motion are highly non - trivial . in section 4",
    "we introduce an action in the brane context that mimics the born - infeld - einstein ( bie ) suggestion by deser and gibbons to modify einstein gravity@xcite .",
    "we suggest that an alternative approximation for the study of brane world scenarios lie in bie type models .",
    "this action encodes a rich geometrical content which results promising to explore cosmological brane models which deserves a careful analysis .",
    "we conclude in section 5 with some comments and we discuss briefly our findings . to make our work selfcontained",

    "equally , when the expressions  ( [ eq : e1 ] ) vanish , these correspond to rt equations of motion@xcite .",

    "moreover , the remaining relations  ( [ eq : e2 ] ) are quite involved .",

    "such equations of motion are obtained from the model @xmath160 which has recently proposed as a brane correction to the dvali - gabadadze - porrati model proposed as a solution for the cosmological constant problem@xcite .",
    "actually , the form as the equations of motion ( [ eq : eofmoto ] ) are presented allows us to identify the piece associated to the @xmath161 expression as a weyl term@xcite which is a geometric correction to the rt equations of motion .",
    "the dynamics of this type of extended objects is highly non - trivial but striking in the search of a proper solution of the cosmological constant problem .",

    "a simple recipe has been presented for studying the dynamical structure of some bi type brane theories by exploiting the mechanical content that the conserved stress tensor possesses .",
    "this is achieved by using an auxiliary variables method .",
    "after considering appropiate quadratic geometrical constraints it is possible to obtain effortless the response of every considered bi type brane action to a deformation @xmath162 once it is distributed among the auxiliary variables .",
    "we have seen that judicious choices for the constraints are intended to facilitate the calculation of the brane dynamics thus providing an economical and efficient way to explore the motion of interesting extended objects . in addition , we have presented a born - infeld - einstein action adapted to the brane context , closed in spirit of the one developed by deser and gibbons@xcite . to my knowledge , this action has not been previously discussed in the brane content . this action contains a rich geometrical content and add new insights with likely benefit for the study of branes in a cosmological context . to lowest order in the rigidity parameter , it contains both dng and rt models , which are first order theories .",
    "nevertheless , the full second order derivative dependence is switched on up to second order terms in the rigidity term expansion .",
    "this modify substantially the rt gravity@xcite by incorporating quadratic terms in the ricci curvature",
