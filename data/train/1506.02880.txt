    "we proved that every such sub - diagram , upon the removal of all bcfw bridges in the permutations , can be casted into one of the three distinct types of skeleton graphs  @xcite .",

    "the bcfw chain captures all the information of the leading singularities of the l - loop nonplanar graphs .",
    "we are thus able to reconstruct any on - shell diagrams by attaching bcfw - bridges from the identity .    to obtain the top - form of scattering amplitudes ,",
    "geometric constraints which determine the integration contours , @xmath4 , of the top - form are needed . a nonplanar leading singularity in the form  @xcite @xmath5 requires to calculate the integrand under the bcfw shifts .",
    "the integrand , @xmath6 , must then contain those poles equivalent to the constraints in @xmath4 ; or the contour integration around @xmath4 will vanish .",
    "each bcfw bridge removes one pole in @xmath6 by shifting a zero minor to be nonzero : in nontrivial cases the poles in the integrand must change their forms accordingly .    to see this",

    "this problem is related to the `` matroid stratification ''  @xcite .",
    "fortunately in each step of the bcfw decompositions the information concerning the transformation of geometric constraints is made transparent , as explained in detail below ; and hence allows us to extract systematically the geometrical constraints encoded in nonplanar on - shell diagrams using bcfw decompositions . in a straight forward way rational top - forms can be written down .",

    "consider a nonplanar 2-loop diagram , @xmath18 ( fig .  [ fig : a63twoloop ] ) , the last bridge attached yields a tangled geometric constraint .",
    "its exact expression can be obtained by transforming the constraints in the last step linearly as @xmath19 adding the bridge @xmath20 and the elimination of @xmath21 leaves @xmath22 invariant .",
    "this tangled constraint is understood geometrically as the degeneracy of the grassmannian subspace in the intersection . since the shifted vector @xmath23 lies on the subspace @xmath24 , the planes @xmath25 ,",
    "@xmath26 and @xmath27 must then intersect on @xmath28 .",
    "the constraint vector @xmath28 can be denoted by vectors in @xmath15 : @xmath29 . integrating over the pole @xmath30 , the tangled geometric constraint is encoded in @xmath31 .",
    "the top - form before attaching the last bcfw bridge is  @xcite , @xmath32 where we have omitted the delta functions for clarity .",
    "the last attachment of the bridge @xmath20 seems to eliminate two poles in the denominator at the same time . applying the same linear transformation to the denominator : @xmath33 we extract the top - form ,    @xmath34     +",
    "attaching bcfw bridges and using the 3- or 4-point amplitude relations reductively , all non - planar diagrams can be constructed and their @xmath1log forms be found .",
    "we should stress , however , that not all nonplanar on - shell diagrams have rational top - forms ; and it is worth to remark on which kind of non - planar on - shell diagrams can have rational top - forms .",
    "we address this question by building up an equivalent relation between _ rational top - form _ and _ linear bcfw bridges_. if a bcfw bridge results in the shifted constraint function to be a linear function of @xmath8 , we call this bcfw bridge _ a linear bcfw bridge_.    a constraint function @xmath35 is a rational function of the minors of grassmannian matrix , @xmath7 . altogether they span an algebraic ideal @xmath36 $ ] . under a bcfw shift @xmath37 ,",

    "if any of them appears nonzero , it must fall into the ideal @xmath36 $ ] .",
    "this means that all the coefficients are constraints of @xmath7 . under the shift ,",
    "@xmath44 and @xmath45 become @xmath46 and @xmath47 the constraint @xmath48 remains the same after the shift @xmath49 .",

    "this constraint is then the constraint being removed .",
    "the proof of the reverse is also straightforward : if one constraint becomes a linear function of @xmath8 under a shift , for instance @xmath60 where @xmath61 vanishes and @xmath62 is invariant under the shift , we have @xmath63 note that the remaining @xmath64 constraints can be written in the form @xmath65 , for @xmath66 $ ] , which are invariant under the shift .",
    "finally we conclude that upon adding a bcfw bridge the on - shell diagram resulted has a top - form if and only if the shift on the algebra ideal @xmath67 is linear . for a generic on - shell diagram",
    ", bcfw - bridges can be added in an arbitrary manner and the transformations on the constraints are complicated .",
    "top - forms can be obtained if and only if when the bcfw parameters shift the constraints linearly .",
    "this type of bridges is thus called _ linear bcfw bridges_. in the construction of top - forms one should avoid using bcfw bridges that shift the constraints in a nonlinear manner .",
    "the general algebraic forms of the constraints encoded in on - shell diagrams can now be readily obtained .",
    "each constraint corresponds to a geometrical interpretation that is a point lying in a hyperplane .",
    "when we attach a bcfw bridge , @xmath68 . in the simplest case , only one geometry relation",
    "is affected , e.g. @xmath69 for @xmath70 ( if @xmath71 there is no constraint . ) .",
    "a more complicated case would be two constraints @xmath72 and @xmath73 both containing the shifting leg .",
    "upon attaching a bcfw bridge a tangled constraint could be obtained : @xmath74 where @xmath75 stands for the volume of the hyperpolyhedron .",
    "captypefigure        it is indeed a geometric constraint on the grassmannian manifold ",
    "the point of intersection of one line and one hyperplane lying on another hyperplane : @xmath76 we denote the intersection point of @xmath77 as @xmath78 . since @xmath79 also lies in the plane @xmath80 , @xmath81 thus the initial constraint @xmath82 directly yields eq .",
    "[ eq : interrelation ] .",
    "one may have noticed that the point @xmath79 is precisely the point @xmath83 before shifting . if we go on attaching another bridge that involves this tangled constraint , the set of constraints can again be written as minors of the grassmannian matrix .",
    "therefore we conclude that general constraints can always be labelled using nested spans and intersections .",
    "consider attaching a linear bcfw bridge @xmath84 in an arbitrary amplitude , a constraint to be shifted is    @xmath85    with @xmath83 being the external line to be shifted , @xmath86 and @xmath87 denoting two sets of external lines .",
    "if column @xmath88 $ ] or @xmath89 $ ] , they can be freely replaced by @xmath90 after attaching the bridge involving @xmath83 . otherwise the constraint will be a nonlinear function of @xmath8 , resulting in an irrational top - form .",
    "we present a counter example in appendix to illustrate this point .",
    "we can then simplify @xmath91 as follows @xmath92 where @xmath93 are some points or hyperplanes composed by @xmath86 and @xmath87 and are easily obtained through a simple relation , @xmath94 after the shift the constraint @xmath91 is removed . in order to obtain the other constraints , we look for the @xmath38 representation of @xmath83 .",
    "this is achieved by unfolding the nested intersections level by level .",
    "+ captypefigure     +     to write a constraint in a compact form and make the geometric relations encoded manifest , we define a line @xmath95 , for @xmath96 $ ] @xmath97 we further define a point + @xmath98 , for @xmath96 $ ] . given a minor @xmath91 , we could obtain the point @xmath99 as @xmath100 all levels of @xmath101 can be recursively obtained according to @xmath102 the geometrical relations is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nestcstrrn ] .",
    "finally we are able to denote the column @xmath83 using the columns in the shifted grassmannian , @xmath103 after removing the constraint @xmath104 , the remaining constraints are invariant under the @xmath15 representation of @xmath83 , making them independent of the shift @xmath84 .",
    "we have classified nonplanar on - shell diagrams according to whether they posses rational top - forms , and proved its equivalence to linear bcfw bridges .",
    "we conclude that when attaching linear bridges , geometric constraints of the nonplanar diagrams  tangled or untangled  can all be constructed systematically . with this chain of bcfw bridges rational top - forms of the nonplanar on - shell diagrams",
    "can then be derived in a straightforward way .",
    "this method applies to leading singularities of nonplanar multi - loop amplitudes beyond mhv .",
    "an immediate question is whether all on - shell diagrams representing nonplanar leading singularities belong to this class , so that all leading singularities can be expressed in rational top - forms .",
    "top - form , being simple and compact , is a great tool to uncover hidden symmetries ( e.g. yangian symmetry beyond planarity  @xcite ) which are otherwise highly tangled in nonplanar leading singularities .",
    "when combined with generalised unitarity cuts , top - form holds promise in constructing the integrals as well as unraveling the symmetries of loop - level scattering amplitudes .",
    "mathematically our method of combining bcfw decompositions with 3- or 4-point amplitude relations is related to the toric geometry arisen in the characterisation of matroid stratification . further exploration on the relationship between bcfw decompositions and matroid stratification will also shed light on the geometry of grassmannian manifolds .",
    "all rational top - forms can be constructed by our method described above . in our discussion",
    "we have assumed that the bcfw bridges are the _ linear bcfw bridges_each successive @xmath8-shift transforms the constraints linearly and can thus be represented by a rational function of minors of the underlying constraint c - matrix .",
    "however not all on - shell diagrams are made up completely of such bridges : the constraints can be nonlinear in @xmath105 and can not be written as rational functions under some shift .",
    "such an on - shell diagram will not have a rational top - form .",
    "we present a counter example , @xmath106 . upon attaching the bridge @xmath107 ,",
    "two constraints @xmath108 and @xmath109 emerge ( the superscripts denote the number of independent column vectors ) , with two columns , @xmath28 and @xmath110 , being the same . attaching the bridge @xmath111 , one of the constraints is removed and the other one becomes @xmath112 . if we go on attaching the bridge @xmath113 , the tangled constraint is removed . however , due to the column @xmath110 appearing twice in that constraint , such a bridge results in a nonlinear shift of the algebraic ideal .",
    "therefore such a @xmath8-shift can not be represented linearly by some minor being zero , violating our linearity requirements in the construction of rational top - forms .        c|cccccc & @xmath114&@xmath115&@xmath116&@xmath117&@xmath118&@xmath119 +   + @xmath120&@xmath114&@xmath115&@xmath116&@xmath117&@xmath118&@xmath121 + @xmath122&@xmath114&@xmath115&@xmath116&@xmath117&@xmath118&@xmath123 + @xmath124&@xmath114&@xmath115&@xmath116&@xmath117&@xmath125&@xmath123 + @xmath126&@xmath114&@xmath115&@xmath116&@xmath117&@xmath127&@xmath123 + @xmath124&@xmath114&@xmath115&@xmath116&@xmath117&@xmath127&@xmath128 + @xmath129&@xmath114&@xmath115&@xmath116&@xmath130&@xmath127&@xmath128 + @xmath131&@xmath114&@xmath115&@xmath132&@xmath130&@xmath127&@xmath128 + @xmath126&@xmath114&@xmath115&@xmath133&@xmath134&@xmath135&@xmath136 + @xmath137&@xmath114&@xmath115&@xmath133&@xmath138&@xmath139&@xmath136 + @xmath140&@xmath114&@xmath141&@xmath133&@xmath138&@xmath139&@xmath136 + @xmath142&@xmath114&@xmath143&@xmath133&@xmath138&@xmath144&@xmath145 + @xmath146&@xmath147&@xmath143&@xmath133&@xmath138&@xmath144&@xmath145 + @xmath142&@xmath148&@xmath149&@xmath133&@xmath138&@xmath144&@xmath145 + @xmath150&@xmath151&@xmath149&@xmath133&@xmath138&@xmath144&@xmath145 + @xmath152&@xmath151&@xmath149&@xmath153&@xmath154&@xmath155&@xmath156 + @xmath157&@xmath108&@xmath109&@xmath153&@xmath154&@xmath155&@xmath156 + @xmath107&@xmath108&@xmath109&@xmath153&@xmath154&@xmath158 & + @xmath111&@xmath159&@xmath160&@xmath153&@xmath154&@xmath158 & + @xmath113&@xmath159&@xmath159&@xmath153&@xmath154&@xmath158 & +      43ifxundefined [ 1 ] ifx#1 ifnum [ 1 ] # 1firstoftwo secondoftwo ifx [ 1 ] # 1firstoftwo secondoftwo `` `` # 1''''@noop [ 0]secondoftwosanitize@url [ 0 ]  + 12$12  & 12#1212_12%12@startlink[1]@endlink[0]@bib@innerbibempty @noop ( ) ,   @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop   ( ) ,   link:\\doibase 10.1007/jhep03(2010)110 [ * * ,   ( ) ] ,   link:\\doibase 10.1007/jhep10(2014)031 [ * * ,   ( ) ] ,   @noop   ( ) ,   @noop   ( ) ,   @noop   ( ) ,   @noop   ( ) ,   @noop * * ,   ( ) link:\\doibase 10.1007/jhep04(2010)085 [ * * ,   ( ) ] ,   link:\\doibase 10.1007/jhep06(2014)170 [ * * ,   ( ) ] ,   @noop   ( ) ,   http://stacks.iop.org/1751-8121/47/i=36/a=365402 [ * * ,   ( ) ] \\doibase    http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nuclphysb.2014.02.016 [ * * ,   ( ) ] @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop ( ) ,   @noop ( ) ,   @noop   ( ) ,   @noop ( ) ,   \\doibase    http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physletb.2004.11.073 [ * * ,   ( ) ] @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) link:\\doibase 10.1103/physrevlett.113.261603 [ * * ,   ( ) ] ,   link:\\doibase 10.1103/physrevd.87.085026 [ * * ,   ( ) ] @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) link:\\doibase 10.1016/0550 - 3213(94)90179 - 1 [ * * ,   ( ) ] ,   @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) link:\\doibase 10.1103/physrevd.71.025012 [ * * ,   ( ) ] ,   link:\\doibase 10.1016/j.nuclphysb.2005.02.030 [ * * ,   ( ) ] ,   link:\\doibase    10.1103/physrevlett.94.181602 [ * * ,   ( ) ] ,   link:\\doibase 10.1007/s11467 - 012 - 0270-z [ * * ,   ( ) ] ,   @noop   ( ) ,   @noop ( ) ,   @noop ( ) link:\\doibase 10.1103/physrevlett.109.241602 [ * * ,   ( ) ] ,   @noop * * ,   ( ) in  @noop _ _  ( ,  )  pp .",
