    "one does not need to rotate it to use it as an umbrella .    in order to construct a model for turbulence mandelbrot introduced @xcite a random set which is now called mandelbrot percolation or fractal percolations or canonical curdling . in the simplest case ( we consider a more general case in this paper ) , we are given a natural number @xmath3 and a probability @xmath4 .",
    "first we partition the unit square @xmath5 ^ 2 $ ] into @xmath6 congruent squares and then we retain each of them with probability @xmath7 and discard them with probability @xmath8 independently . in the squares which were retained we repeat this process independently ad infinitum .",
    "the random set @xmath9 ^ 2 $ ] that results is the fractal percolation or canonical curdling .",
    "in fact in this paper sometimes we consider the more general setup where the @xmath6 congruent squares , mentioned above , are chosen with not necessarily the same probabilities .",
    "these random cantor sets have attracted considerable attention . in 1978",
    "peyrire computed the almost sure hausdorff dimension , conditioned on non - extinction ( this result was reproved many times ) . in 1988",
    "chayes , chayes , durett @xcite proved that there is a critical probability @xmath10 such for every @xmath11 the random cantor set @xmath1 is totally disconnected , but for every @xmath12 with positive probability @xmath1 percolates .",
    "this means that there is a connected component in @xmath1 which connects the left hand side wall to the right hand side wall of the unit square @xmath5 ^ 2 $ ] with positive probability .",
    "dekking and meester @xcite gave a simplified proof for the previously mentioned result and defined several phases such that as we increase @xmath7 the process passes through all of these phases . if the fractal is totally disconnected ( @xmath13 ) it still can happen that some of its projections contain intervals .",
    "the orthogonal projections of fractals on the plane were already studied by marstrand @xcite in 1954 .",
    "marstrand s theorem says that for any set @xmath14 with @xmath15 the orthogonal projection of @xmath16 to almost all lines has positive lebesgue measure ; here @xmath17 denotes the hausdorff dimension .",
    "existence of an interval in the orthogonal projections of some cantor sets in the plane was first studied in relation with the famous palis conjecture about the algebraic difference of cantor sets .",
    "the algebraic difference of the cantor sets @xmath18 is the @xmath19 projection of @xmath20 .",
    "palis conjectured that `` typically '' @xmath21 is either small in the sense that it has lebesgue measure zero or big in the sense that it contains some intervals .",
    "see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .    for percolation fractals falconer and",
    "grimmett @xcite studied the existence of intervals in the vertical and horizontal projections .",
    "our work is a generalization of their result .    *",
    "the most important conclusion * of our result is that whenever the probability @xmath22 then although the set @xmath1 may be totally disconnected , almost surely conditioned on non - extinction , all projections in various families ( orthogonal , radial , co - radial projections ) contain some intervals . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath23 this can not happen .",
    "namely , falconer @xcite proved that in this case the one dimensional hausdorff measure of @xmath1 is almost surely zero .",
    "* the paper is organized as follows . * in the second section we give precise definitions of the objects we study , we also formulate our main results . in the third section",
    "we explain the importance of statistical self - similarity .",
    "the fourth section contains the proof of theorem [ thm : ortho ] . in the fifth section",
    "we add one more idea that lets us upgrade this argument , yielding the proof of theorem [ thm : many ] .",
    "finally , in the sixth section we formulate the most general form of our results , theorem [ thm : general ] , and theorem [ thm : nonlin ] follows as a special case .",
    "first we provide a definition of the random cantor set @xmath1 ( we will call it the fractal percolation ) which is the object of interest of this paper .",

    "within each square @xmath33 we repeat the process described above independently .",

    "similarly , for every @xmath36 we construct the set @xmath37 .",
    "the object of interest in this paper is the random set @xmath38 .",
    "more formally , let @xmath39 be the partition of @xmath40 into @xmath41-adic squares of level @xmath36 . for each square @xmath42 we can find two sequences @xmath43 such that    @xmath44 \\times \\left[\\sum_{l=1}^n j_l\\cdot m^{-l } , \\sum_{l=1}^n j_l\\cdot m^{-l } + m^{-n}\\right].\\ ] ] we will denote such square by @xmath45 , where    @xmath46 clearly , @xmath47 if and only if    @xmath48    we define @xmath49 and then we construct inductively a random family @xmath50 . that is , if @xmath51 then @xmath52 for all @xmath53 and if @xmath54 then @xmath55 with probability @xmath29 .",
    "those events are jointly independent .",
    "we denote    @xmath56 and    @xmath57 the sequence @xmath58 is a decreasing sequence of compact sets , hence @xmath1 is nonempty if and only if all @xmath37 are nonempty .",
    "it follows easily from the general theory of branching processes , see for example ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1 ) , that @xmath59    we will always assume @xmath60 and our results will be conditioned on @xmath1 being nonempty .",
    "it was proved by several authors : peyrire @xcite , hawkes , @xcite falconer @xcite and mauldin , williams @xcite and graf @xcite that @xmath61 in particular , under our assumptions @xmath62 ( provided @xmath1 is nonempty ) .",
    "the proof of this statement involves proving the following :    [ en]the following assertion holds almost surely :    if @xmath63 then @xmath64      the object of our study is the existence of intervals in different kinds of projections of @xmath1 . the nature of projections of angles @xmath65 or @xmath66 is conspicuously different and these cases were already treated by falconer and grimmett in @xcite .",
    "so , mostly we restrict our attention to the domain of angles @xmath67    it will be convenient for us to use a special form of projections . instead of the usual orthogonal projection @xmath68 onto some line",
    "we will use projection @xmath69 , the codomain of which is one of diagonals of @xmath40 . if @xmath70 ( i.e. if the projection is in upper left - lower right direction ) we will use the nonorthogonal projection in direction @xmath71 onto the interval @xmath72,[1,1])$ ] .",
    "otherwise , if @xmath73 and the projection is in the upper right - lower left direction , we will project onto the interval @xmath74,[1,0])$ ] .",
    "naturally , @xmath75 contains an interval if and only if @xmath76 does .",

    "given @xmath86 , the co - radial projection with center @xmath83 of a set @xmath1 is denoted by @xmath87 and is defined as the set of distances between @xmath83 and points from @xmath1 .",
    "figure [ 151 ] explains why we consider this object a projection .    like in the case of orthogonal projections",
    ", we will consider auxiliary formulations .",
    "if the point @xmath83 is in diagonal direction from @xmath40 ( i.e. if both x and y coordinates of @xmath83 are outside @xmath5 $ ] ) then instead of @xmath88 with codomain @xmath89 and @xmath90 with codomain @xmath91 we can consider @xmath80 and @xmath81 , whose codomains are diagonals of @xmath40 . for example , as shown in figure [ 151 ] , if @xmath83 is in lower left direction from @xmath40 ( both coordinates of @xmath83 are negative ) then the codomain of @xmath80 is @xmath74,[1,0])$ ] and the codomain of @xmath81 is @xmath72,[1,1])$ ] .",
    "once again , @xmath92 contains an interval if and only if @xmath84 does , and similarly for @xmath87 and @xmath93 .    there is a more general notion of a * family of almost linear projections * we are going to use , but it is more complicated .",
    "the definition will be given in the last section .",
    "let us start from a direct generalization of @xcite .",
    "let @xmath94 .",
    "in the fourth section we will define condition @xmath95 on the set of probabilities @xmath96 , at the moment it is enough to know that if all @xmath97 then @xmath95 is satisfied for all @xmath98 .",

    "[ thm : nonlin ] assume that @xmath95 holds for all @xmath94 and that @xmath99",
    ". then almost surely both @xmath84 and @xmath87 contain an interval for all @xmath82 .",
    "the goal of this section is to explain two simple ideas , explaining why the statistical self - similarity of the construction of @xmath1 simplifies our task .",
    "let @xmath102 be the natural contraction sending @xmath40 onto @xmath103 .",
    "that is , @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the lower left corner of @xmath45 .",
    "then by the * statistical self - similarity * of @xmath1 we mean the following fact : for any @xmath106 the conditional distribution of @xmath107 conditioned on @xmath54 is the same as distribution of @xmath108 .",
    "the first idea , used already in @xcite , is as follows .",
    "let @xmath1 be a nonempty realization of the fractal percolation . almost surely , @xmath1 has infinitely many points , hence we can find an infinite sequence of numbers @xmath109 and squares @xmath110 such that any two squares @xmath111 are not contained in each other . fix @xmath71 .",
    "the probability that @xmath112 contains an interval is the same for each @xmath113 ( and the same as probability that @xmath75 contains an interval ) and those are independent events .",
    "hence , it is enough to prove that @xmath75 contains an interval with positive probability to know that it contains an interval with probability 1 ( conditioned on @xmath1 being nonempty ) .",
    "the second idea is quite similar .",
    "let @xmath82 and consider the radial projection with center @xmath83 ( for co - radial projection it works much the same ) . once again",
    ", if @xmath1 is nonempty then we can almost surely find a square @xmath114 with nonempty intersection with @xmath1 and which @xmath83 does not belong to and is in diagonal direction from ( @xmath1 almost surely is not contained in a horizontal or vertical line ) .",
    "we can then construct the family @xmath111 of subsets of @xmath114 such that the size of each @xmath111 is very small compared to its distance from @xmath83 ( we just need to take them sufficiently small ) .",
    "note that not only @xmath83 is in diagonal direction from each @xmath111 , the direction is actually bounded away from horizontal and vertical .",
    "the probability that @xmath115 contains an interval is the same as probability that @xmath116 contains an interval .",
    "hence , to prove that @xmath84 almost surely contains an interval , it is enough to prove that the probability that @xmath117 contains an interval is uniformly bounded away from zero for @xmath118 far away from @xmath40 and in direction bounded away from horizontal and vertical .",
    "it is a natural observation that the radial / co - radial projections with center sufficiently far away do not differ much from linear projections .",
    "indeed , this is how this idea will be used in the proof of theorem [ thm : nonlin ] in the last section .",
    "as our main idea comes from paper of falconer and grimmett @xcite , let us start by recalling their proof .",
    "we will assume the simplest case : all the probabilities are equal to @xmath119 .",
    "we want to prove that the probability that the vertical projection of the percolation fractal is the whole interval @xmath5 $ ] is positive . for any @xmath120",
    "let us divide @xmath5 $ ] into intervals of length @xmath121 and let us code them by the usual @xmath41-adic codes . over each interval",
    "@xmath122 there is a whole column of @xmath123 @xmath41-adic squares of level @xmath36 , and @xmath122 is contained in the vertical projection of @xmath37 if and only if at least one of those squares belongs to @xmath124 . denoting by @xmath125",
    "the number of squares above @xmath122 contained in @xmath124 , we need to prove that with positive probability all @xmath125 ( for all possible sequences @xmath126 ) are positive .    note that @xmath127    choose any @xmath128 and let @xmath129 be the event that    @xmath130 for all @xmath131 . by large deviation estimations ,    @xmath132 for some @xmath133 .",
    "hence , if all the events @xmath134 hold then @xmath135 and so    @xmath136 hence , at level @xmath36 we have to check exponentially big number of events ( precisely , @xmath123 of them ) but each of those events is superexponentially certain to happen .",
    "it follows that with positive probability all those events will happen .",
    "our goal in this section is a more complicated statement : for the same kind of percolation fractal we fix a direction @xmath71 ( neither horizontal nor vertical ) and we want to check that the projection of the fractal in this direction contains an interval with positive probability . equation does not hold : even if a point belongs to a projection of some @xmath36-th level square , it does not imply that the expected number of @xmath137-st level squares in the approximation of the percolation fractal such that their projections contain the point is greater than 1 .",
    "more precisely , if the point belongs to the projection of the central part of the square then everything might work , but not for the points very close to the ends of the projection interval .",
    "to go around this technical problem , we only count the number of central parts of projections of @xmath36-th level squares that a given point belongs to .",
    "this lets us replace by condition a(@xmath71 ) as our main working tool .",
    "note that if we check that a sufficiently dense set of points belongs to central parts of projections of some squares from @xmath36-th approximation of the fractal , the whole projections will cover everything .",
    "we only need to take care that the number of points needed at step @xmath36 grows at most exponentially fast with @xmath36 and then the falconer and grimmett s argument will go through .",

    "we are going to consider @xmath69 instead of @xmath68 , i.e. we are projecting onto a diagonal @xmath138 of @xmath40 . for any @xmath139 the map @xmath140 is a linear contraction of ratio @xmath121 .",
