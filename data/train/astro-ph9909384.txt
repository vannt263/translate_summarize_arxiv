    "ever since its discovery over 30 yrs ago by sandage & wildey ( 1967 ) and van den bergh ( 1967 ) , the 2nd parameter effect has stood as one of the major unsolved challenges in the study of the galactic gcs .",
    "although it was recognized quite early that the hb morphology becomes redder on average with increasing metallicity ( sandage & wallerstein 1960 ) , many pairs of gcs were also known with identical metallicities but markedly different hb morphologies , e.g. , m 3 versus m 13 , ngc 288 versus ngc 362 . indeed ,",
    "some gcs , e.g. , ngc 1851 and ngc 2808 , possess bimodal hbs , where the 2nd parameter effect seems to be producing both blue and red hb populations within the same cluster .",
    "thus some parameter(s ) besides metallicity ( the 1st parameter ) must be affecting the evolution of the hb stars in these gcs .",
    "many 2nd parameter candidates have been suggested over the years , including the gc age , mass loss along the rgb , helium abundance @xmath0 , alpha - element abundance [ @xmath1/fe ] , cluster dynamics , stellar rotation , deep mixing , etc .",
    "( see fusi pecci & bellazzini 1997 for a recent review ) .",
    "determining which of these candidates is responsible for the 2nd parameter effect has been a difficult , but exceedingly important , task for understanding a number of astrophysical problems . in particular",
    ", the age interpretation of the 2nd parameter effect requires age differences of several gyr among the gcs , implying a correspondingly long timescale for the formation of the galactic halo .",
    "recent age determinations from both the `` horizontal '' and `` vertical '' methods do not , however , support such large age differences , indicating that age is probably not the dominant 2nd parameter except perhaps in a few specific cases ( see , e.g. , vandenberg 1999 ) .",
    "the 2nd parameter effect is also important for understanding the origin of the extreme hb stars which are found in several gcs ( e.g. , m 13 , ngc 2808 , ngc 6752 , @xmath2 cen ) and which are believed to be responsible for the uv upturn phenomenon in elliptical galaxies .",
    "why some gcs possess such hot hb stars while others do not remains an open puzzle .",
    "finally the 2nd parameter effect provides a potential means for assessing the impact of such noncanonical processes as cluster dynamics , rotation and mixing on the evolution of gc stars .    the hst observations of ngc 6388 and ngc 6441 by rich et al .",
    "( 1997 ) first demonstrated that old , metal - rich stellar populations can produce hot hb stars .",
    "as noted by sweigart & catelan ( 1998 , hereafter sc98 ) , the hbs in these clusters slope upward with decreasing with the luminosity at the top of the blue tail being nearly 0.5 mag brighter in @xmath3 than the well - populated red hb clump",
    ". this pronounced upward slope to the hb provides a crucial diagnostic for the 2nd parameter effect because it immediately tells us that the 2nd parameter is affecting both the temperature and luminosity of the hb stars .",
    "smaller upward slopes of @xmath4 mag have also been reported in the bimodal clusters ngc 1851 ( walker 1998 ) and ngc 6229 ( borissova et al .",
    "1999 ) , which interestingly are among the more metal - rich of the intermediate - metallicity gcs .",
    "the fact that hot hb stars are found in gcs as metal - rich as ngc 6388 and ngc 6441 ( @xmath5 } \\ , \\approx \\",
    ", -0.5 $ ] ) may be especially important for the following reason .",
    "in intermediate - metallicity gcs such as m 3 the hb spans a wide range in color that extends both blueward and redward of the instability strip .",
    "the location of a star along the hb is then quite sensitive to changes in the stellar parameters .",
    "indeed , this is why the hb is `` horizontal '' . in some sense",
    "it is then easier for a 2nd parameter candidate to shift the hb morphology blueward . in metal - rich gcs",
    ", however , the situation is quite different . due to their high envelope opacity",
    "metal - rich hb stars are normally confined to a red clump . to move such stars",
    "blueward requires a larger change in the stellar structure .",
    "thus any 2nd parameter candidate capable of producing hot hb stars in a metal - rich gc might also have other observational consequences such as upward sloping hbs as in ngc 6388 and ngc 6441 .",
    "we have undertaken extensive stellar evolution calculations in order to explore the cause of the 2nd parameter effect in ngc 6388 and ngc 6441 .",
    "some preliminary results from sc98 are briefly reviewed in the following two sections .",
    "we first demonstrate that canonical hb models can not explain the upward sloping hbs in these gcs ( section 2 ) and then present three noncanonical scenarios based on 1 ) a high cluster helium abundance , 2 ) internal rotation , and 3 ) helium mixing along the rgb ( section 3 ) . finally in section 4 we discuss a new scenario in which dust formation near the tip of the rgb might lead to metal depletion in the envelopes of the blue hb stars .",
    "we first consider whether canonical models can explain the upward sloping hbs in ngc 6388 and ngc 6441 .",
    "it is well - known that the effective temperature of an hb star increases as its mass decreases .",
    "thus one could , in principle , produce hot hb stars by increasing the cluster age and hence lowering the main - sequence turnoff mass or by enhancing the amount of mass loss along the rgb .",
    "rich et al . (",
    "1997 ) , in fact , considered both of these possibilities but found neither of them to be satisfactory .",
    "more specifically , the required increase in the cluster age would be quite large , at least @xmath6 gyr , which would place ngc 6388 and ngc 6441 among the oldest , if not the oldest , gcs in the galaxy .",
    "moreover , the frequency of stellar interactions within the cores of these clusters seems too low to produce the additional rgb mass loss .",
    "the lack of a radial gradient in the blue hb / red hb number ratio ( rich et al .",
    "1997 ) also argues against a dynamical explanation , although layden et al .",
    "( 1999 ) have suggested that such a gradient may be present in ngc 6441 .    in order to explore the canonical scenario in more detail ,",
    "we have computed grids of hb sequences for helium abundances @xmath0 of 0.23 and 0.28 and heavy - element abundances @xmath7 of 0.002 , 0.006 and 0.01716 (= @xmath8 ) .",
    "the tracks for one of these grids are plotted in figure 1 .",
    "using such tracks , sc98 then computed hb simulations    in the ( @xmath9 , ) plane , assuming a gaussian distribution in the hb mass ( see figure 1 of sc98 ) . in all of these simulations",
    "the hb morphology was found to be quite flat without any indication of an upward slope as observed in ngc 6388 and ngc 6441 .",
    "increasing the cluster age or the rgb mass loss simply moved the models blueward in without increasing their luminosity .",
    "we conclude therefore that canonical hb models can not account for the hb morphology in ngc 6388 and ngc 6441 .",
    "in particular , the two most prominent 2nd parameter candidates - age and rgb mass loss - do not work .",
    "the previous discussion indicates that the 2nd parameter is increasing the luminosity of the blue hb stars in ngc 6388 and ngc 6441 .",
    "theoretical models show that the hb luminosity for a fixed @xmath7 depends on two parameters : the helium abundance @xmath0 and the core mass @xmath10 .",
    "this fact prompted sc98 to suggest 3 noncanonical scenarios involving increases in either @xmath0 or @xmath10 which might potentially produce upward sloping hbs . by `` noncanonical '' we mean scenarios which include effects such as rotation or mixing that are normally omitted in low mass stellar models or which assume nonstandard values for the stellar parameters .",
    "we will now briefly review each of these scenarios and will then discuss some new observational data which have become available since the sc98 study .",
    "the first ( `` high-@xmath0 '' ) scenario assumes that the stars in ngc 6388 and ngc 6441 formed with a high initial helium abundance due to a peculiar chemical enrichment history in these clusters . from theoretical models we know that high helium abundances can lead to very long blue loops in the hb tracks and to a large deviation of these tracks from the zero - age hb ( zahb ) . to determine",
    "if such track characteristics might produce upward sloping hbs , we extended our canonical calculations to @xmath0 = 0.43 at increments of 0.05 .",
    "one grid of high-@xmath0 tracks is given in the lower panel of figure 1 .",
    "comparing these high-@xmath0 tracks with the canonical tracks in figure 1 shows the dramatic effect that a high helium abundance can have on the track morphology . in the canonical case",
    "the blue loops are quite short , with most of the evolution being spent near the zahb . at high helium abundances , however , the blue loops extend to high effective temperatures , with the blue end of the loops , where the evolution is particularly slow , being much brighter than the zahb .",
    "the hb simulations given in figures 2a , b of sc98 show that such high-@xmath0 tracks can indeed produce upward sloping hbs , but only if @xmath0 is very large ( @xmath11 @xmath12 ) .",
    "moreover , this scenario predicts a very bright hb luminosity as well as a large value for the number ratio @xmath13 of hb stars to rgb stars brighter than the hb .",
    "the second ( `` rotation '' ) scenario is based on the fact that rotation within an rgb star can delay the helium flash , thereby leading to a larger core mass and to a brigher rgb tip luminosity and hence greater mass loss .",
    "this increase in @xmath10 together with the corresponding decrease in the mass @xmath14 then leads to a bluer and brighter hb morphology .",
    "thus rotation might also be able to produce upward sloping hbs , where the slow rotators are located in the red clump while the fast rotators are shifted blueward as the rotation rate increases . in order    to test this possibility",
    ", we need to know how much extra mass is lost at the tip of the rgb when @xmath10 exceeds its canonical value . to answer this question",
    ", we evolved sequences up the rgb with the helium burning turned off , thereby permitting @xmath10 to become arbitrarily large . in this way we were able to determine how @xmath14 decreases with increasing @xmath10 for various values of the reimers mass loss parameter @xmath15 . using these results to specify the variation of @xmath14 with @xmath10 along the hb , we then computed grids of `` rotation '' tracks , two of which are presented in figure 2 .",
    "perhaps not surprisingly , the hb simulations obtained from these tracks ( see figures 2c , d of sc98 ) also show upward sloping hbs .",
    "thus rotation may offer an alternative explanation for the hb morphology in ngc 6388 and ngc 6441 .",
    "compared to the high-@xmath0 scenario , the rotation scenario predicts smaller increases in both the hb luminosity and the @xmath13 ratio .",
    "the third ( `` helium - mixing '' ) scenario is motivated by the large star - to - star abundance variations in c , n , o , na and al which are found among the red - giant stars within individual gcs and which are often attributed in part to the mixing of nuclearly processed material from the vicinity of the hydrogen shell out to the stellar surface ( kraft 1994 ) . this mixing is believed to be driven by rotation .",
    "the observed enhancements in al are particularly important because they indicate that the mixing is able to penetrate into the hydrogen shell ( cavallo et al .",
    "1998 ) , thereby dredging up fresh helium together with the al .",
    "such helium mixing would lead to an enhancement in the envelope helium abundance during the rgb phase as well as to additional mass loss due to a brighter rgb tip luminosity .",
    "thus a helium - mixed star would arrive on the hb with both a higher envelope helium abundance and a lower mass and therefore would be both bluer and brighter than its canonical counterpart - just what is needed to produce an upward sloping hb . to test this possibility , we have evolved many sequences up the rgb in which helium mixing was included following the prescription of sweigart ( 1997a , b ) .",
    "each of these sequences was then evolved through the helium flash and hb phases .",
    "two hb grids computed in this manner are given in figure 3 .",
    "the hb simulations obtained from these tracks show an upward slope very similar to that seen in ngc 6388 and ngc 6441 ( see figures 2e , f of sc98 ) .",
    "the predicted increases in both the hb luminosity and the @xmath13 ratio are again smaller than in the high-@xmath0 scenario .",
    "all three of the above scenarios predict brighter blue hb stars than canonical models .",
    "this prediction has several interesting consequences which we now examine in light of some recent observational results ( see also sc98 ) .",
    "first , from the pulsation equation we know that a brighter rr lyrae luminosity should lead to a longer pulsation period .",
    "recent studies by layden et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and pritzl et al .",
    "( 1999 ) have , in fact , found that the rr lyrae variables in ngc 6388 and ngc 6441 are shifted towards longer periods in the period - amplitude diagram compared to the metal - rich field rr lyrae variables , just as predicted by the noncanonical scenarios .",
    "moreover , the size of the shift seems to be approximately consistent with some of the sc98 simulations , although a detailed analysis remains to be carried out .",
    "second , a brighter hb luminosity implies a larger value for the @xmath13 ratio .",
    "layden et al .",
    "( 1999 ) have estimated an @xmath13 value of @xmath16 for ngc 6441 . while within the range expected from the rotation and helium - mixing scenarios ,",
    "this value is much smaller than expected from the high-@xmath0 scenario .",
    "third , one would expect the blue hb stars to have lower surface gravities .",
    "moehler et al . (",
    "1999a ) have recently obtained log @xmath17 values for 7 blue hb stars in ngc 6388 and ngc 6441 .",
    "quite surprisingly , these gravities are even larger on average than the canonical gravities .",
    "this is a baffling result for it says that the noncanonical models which produce upward sloping hbs can not explain the gravities of the blue hb stars .",
    "this point is discussed further in the next section .",
    "when confronted with observations that can not be explained by canonical models , it is often helpful to examine the assumptions that go into the calculations to see if they are fully justified .",
    "one assumption underlying both the canonical and noncanonical scenarios discussed thus far is that the envelope heavy - element abundance remains constant as a star evolves .",
    "suppose , however , that elements with high condensation temperatures ( e.g. , ca , fe ) were to form dust grains which are then selectively removed from the stellar atmosphere by radiation pressure near the tip of the rgb , thereby leaving behind metal - depleted gas .",
    "suppose also that some of this gas is then captured by the convective envelope of a red - giant star , thus reducing the overall envelope metal abundance .",
    "how would such metal depletion affect the subsequent hb evolution ? if the metals are depleted throughout the envelope , one would expect an hb star to be both bluer and brighter .",
    "thus metal depletion via dust formation near the tip of the rgb might offer another way to produce upward sloping hbs .",
    "is there observational evidence for dust formation and metal depletion in gc stars ?",
    "moehler et al . (",
    "1998 ) have analyzed hst - ghrs spectra of the two post - asymptotic - giant - branch ( agb ) stars barnard 29 in m 13 and roa 5701 in @xmath18 cen .",
    "both stars showed substantial fe depletion which moehler et al .",
    "( 1998 ) attributed to gas - dust separation near the end of the agb phase .",
    "the cno elements , however , were not depleted .",
    "a similar abundance pattern is also seen in field post - agb stars . in particular , the fe - group elements , especially ca and",
    "fe , often show moderate to extreme deficiencies , with [ fe / h ] reaching values below -4 in some stars .",
    "bond ( 1991 ) has proposed that these ultra - low fe abundances arise from dust grain formation , a possibility that has been further explored by mathis & lamers ( 1992 ) ( see also napiwotzki et al .",
    "1994 ) . besides cno",
    ", a few other elements , most notably s , seem to have nearly normal abundances , as would be expected under this metal - depletion scenario .",
    "further support is provided by the presence of dust around most post - agb stars .",
    "venn & lambert ( 1990 ) have emphasized the striking similarity between the abundance pattern found in post - agb stars and the patterns seen in the interstellar gas and in a class of metal - deficient , population i a - type dwarfs known as @xmath19 botis stars . from an analysis of 3 @xmath19 botis stars ,",
    "venn & lambert ( 1990 ) concluded that the strong depletions of ca and fe found in these stars together with their approximately solar c , n , o and s abundances are most likely due to dust formation followed by the accretion of metal - depleted gas .",
    "significantly corbally & gray ( 1996 ) have reported that 10 out of 67 of their field hb candidates also show @xmath19 botis - like spectra including the prototype field hb star hd 2857 . again",
    "dust formation along the rgb was suggested as the most likely explanation ( gray et al .",
    "in addition , adelman & philip ( 1994 ) have noted that about one - half of their sample of field hb stars had [ ca / fe ] values below those expected from metal - deficient red giants .",
    "there is also some evidence for ca depletion in gc hb stars .",
    "the [ ca / h ] distribution of the blue hb stars in @xmath18 cen derived by dcruz et al .",
    "( 1997 ) contains a substantial population of very ca - poor stars that are not seen on the rgb .",
    "likewise , the [ fe / h ] distribution for the rr lyrae variables in @xmath18 cen given by the @xmath20 method is skewed towards lower abundances compared to the red giants .",
    "we suggest that these hb ca depletions may be due to dust formation in the red - giant progenitors .",
    "such an effect would complicate the use of the @xmath18 cen variables for determining the rr lyrae period shift even if the metal depletion was confined to the surface layers and therefore had no effect on the luminosity . in general , a ca depletion on the hb might lead to an offset between the @xmath20 - [ fe / h ] calibrations defined by the field and cluster variables when giant branch [ fe / h ] abundances are used .",
    "such an offset has been reported by carretta & gratton ( 1997 ) .",
    "dust formation and metal depletion in bright gc red giants may be driven by stellar pulsations which can lead to extended atmospheres and to large excursions in color and hence effective temperature ( see fig",
    ". 6 of montegriffo et al .",
    "indeed , the connection between pulsation and mass loss has often been noted ( e.g. , frogel & elias 1988 ) .",
    "several types of bright red variables are present in gcs .",
    "metal - rich gcs with [ fe / h ] @xmath21 -1 contain long period variables ( lpvs ) having luminosities brighter than the tip of the rgb .",
    "these lpvs , which are presumably agb stars , show substantial infrared emission , indicating the presence of a circumstellar dust shell ( frogel & elias 1988 ) .",
    "intermediate - metallicity and metal - rich gcs also contain `` peculiar '' variables which are located just below the tip of the rgb and which also show excess infrared emission .",
    "since the evolutionary timescale near the rgb tip is @xmath22 yr , one would expect only a few such variables per gc .",
    "we suggest that these peculiar variables may be the best candidates for metal depletion .",
    "ngc 6441 is , in fact , known to contain a considerable population of red variables including mira , semi - regular and irregular variables ( layden et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "could metal depletion help to explain the high gravities of the blue hb stars in ngc 6388 and ngc 6441 obtained by moehler et al .",
    "( 1999a ) ?",
    "caloi ( 1999 ) was the first to point out that an enhancement of the atmospheric metal abundances in hot hb stars ( @xmath23 k ) by radiative levitation might lead to an underestimate of the gravities ( see also leone & manfr 1997 ; grundahl et al .",
    "subsequent studies have confirmed both the existence of radiative levitation in hot hb stars ( behr et al . 1999 ) and its effect on the derived gravities ( moehler et al .",
    "in essence , if one analyzes hot hb stars using the cluster metal abundance instead of their actual ( and larger ) atmospheric abundances , the gravities derived from the balmer lines will be too low .",
    "conversely , if the atmospheric abundances are lower than the cluster abundance , then the gravities should be too large . since all but 1 of the blue hb stars in the moehler et al",
    "study had temperatures too cool for radiative levitation , the large gravities might be partially understood if the atmospheres of these stars were depleted of metals .",
    "metal depletion in bright red giants may also be relevant to the current controversy between the `` long '' and `` short '' population ii distance scales .",
    "suppose that the surface abundances of ca and fe are depleted in a gc red giant just before it evolves from the tip of the rgb to the hb .",
    "in plotting such a star in the @xmath24 versus [ fe / h ] diagram , one would normally use the cluster [ fe / h ] abundance . if , however , the same star were in the field , one would then use its actual ( and lower ) surface abundance . since @xmath24 increases with increasing [ fe / h ]",
    ", one would conclude that this field hb star is fainter than cluster hb stars of the same metallicity    the above metal - depletion scenario is , of course , highly speculative .",
    "we are not suggesting that all gc red giants experience metal depletion ( see , e.g. , lambert et al .",
    "1992 ) but rather that metal depletion may under some circumstances act as a 2nd parameter , possibly associated with pulsation .",
    "effects such as rotation or helium mixing which brighten the rgb tip luminosity may increase the likelihood of pulsation and hence metal depletion .",
    "we can , however , offer two observational tests .",
    "first , the abundance pattern of the blue hb stars in ngc 6388 and ngc 6441 should show normal cno abundances but depleted ca and fe .",
    "a key diagnostic would be s , which should have the normal cluster abundance .",
    "second , @xmath20 measurements of the rr lyrae variables should indicate a lower than cluster [ fe / h ] abundance .",
    "finally theoretical calculations are needed to see if metal depletion with the expected abundance pattern can , in fact , lead to upward sloping hbs .",
