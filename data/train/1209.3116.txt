    "was first studied in 1913 ( jackson 1913 ) but the topic was largely neglected by the scientific community until the end of the xxth century when co - orbital motion of planets and asteroids started receiving more attention on theoretical grounds ( mikkola & innanen 1997 ; wiegert , innanen & mikkola 2000 ) . so far , such quasi - satellites have been found around venus ( mikkola et al . 2004 ) , earth ( wiegert , innanen & mikkola 1997 ; connors et al .",

    "if quasi - satellites have been discovered orbiting rocky bodies in the inner solar system and theory predicts long - term stability for quasi - satellite orbits in the outer solar system , one may wonder whether a quasi - satellite could orbit an object like the dwarf planet pluto .",
    "the existence of a small but significant population of minor bodies experiencing co - orbital resonant behaviour with respect to pluto in the form of libration or slow circulation of the relative mean longitude has been predicted in the context of chaotic diffusion of trans - neptunian objects ( yu & tremaine 1999 ; tiscareno & malhotra 2009 ) .",
    "such objects may experience relatively close , low velocity encounters with pluto which translate into comparatively large perturbational effects if they occupy the kozai resonance ( tiscareno & malhotra 2009 ) . using data from the jpl s horizons system we performed a numerical survey looking for minor bodies relatively close to pluto during the next few years in order to find candidates for possible co - orbital resonant behaviour .",
    "our search resulted in a promising candidate , 15810 ( 1994 jr@xmath1 ) .",
    "we identified 15810 as currently located at about 3.1 au from pluto and slowly approaching to its peripluto at 2.7 au within a timeframe of 5 years .",

    "we show that the plutino asteroid 15810 ( 1994 jr@xmath1 ) currently follows a quasi - satellite path around pluto .",

    "in order to investigate the orbital evolution of 15810 and its possible co - orbital resonant behaviour with respect to pluto we have performed @xmath0-body calculations in both directions of time .",
    "the numerical integrations of the orbit of plutino 15810 presented here were computed with the hermite integrator ( makino 1991 ; aarseth 2003 ) , in a model solar system which included the perturbations by the eight major planets ( mercury to neptune ) and treat the earth and the moon as two separate objects , it also includes the barycentre of the dwarf planet pluto - charon system and the three largest asteroids , ( 1 ) ceres , ( 2 ) pallas and ( 4 ) vesta .",

    "this resonance prevents close encounters between 15810 and neptune and also between pluto and neptune .",
    "the slow drift in relative mean longitude observed in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] is not induced by neptune but by pluto ; the object experiences repeated relatively close encounters with pluto ( more properly , the barycentre of the pluto - charon system as in all this discussion ) as seen in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] , although initially the closest distances are well outside the hill sphere of pluto that has a radius of 0.0385 au .",
    "approximately 125,000 yr into the past , 15810 had a number of periodic ( 10,000 yr ) periplutos in the range 1.6 - 1.8 au .",
    "but in the future , in about 13,000 yr , much closer approaches will be possible at 0.07 au that is less than twice its hill radius .",
    "the object will slowly drift into the area around the l@xmath13 lagrange point .",
    "the object identified in this letter is not the classical quasi - satellite found around objects moving in not very eccentric orbits like venus . the high inclination and eccentricity characteristic of the orbit of pluto add new complexity to an already challenging dynamical situation . in principle , it may be argued that 15810 is not even co - orbital with pluto , making the analysis carried out here dynamically unjustified .",
    "following namouni ( 1999 ) , the co - orbital region in the case of a host object is defined as @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the radius of the hill sphere of the host object and @xmath25 , its semi - major axis . in the case of the first bona fide quasi - satellite , 2002 ve@xmath14 , and for the jd2456200.5 epoch ,",
    "the semi - major axes of the quasi - satellite and venus are 0.7237 au and 0.7233 au respectively , and the hill radius of venus is 0.0067 au .",
    "therefore , namouni s criterion obviously indicates that 2002 ve@xmath14 is co - orbital with venus .",
    "the same naive application of the criterion to 15810 gives @xmath26 in violation of the co - orbitality criterion .",
    "therefore and using this approach , 15810 is not even co - orbital with pluto and the quasi - satellite motion pointed out above is not more than a happy coincidence .",
    "however , if we use the proper orbital elements instead of osculating keplerian orbital elements at a particular epoch , the criterion becomes @xmath27 .",
    "the proper elements clearly confirm the co - orbital nature ( with pluto ) of 15810 ; plutino 15810 is truly , albeit somewhat accidental , a quasi - satellite of pluto . by accidental we mean that the quasi - satellite phase is not triggered or terminated by direct gravitational interaction in the form of a discrete close encounter ( with a certain planet like the earth in the case of 2002 ve@xmath14 ) but as a result of a resonance .",
    "the relative mean longitude of the plutino circulates with a superimposed libration resulting from the oscillation of the orbital period induced by the 2:3 mean motion resonance with neptune .",
    "these quasi - satellite episodes are recurrent with a periodicity of nearly 2 myr .",
    "the behaviour found in our calculations have been previously described in numerical simulations ( yu & tremaine 1999 ; tiscareno & malhotra 2009 ) which predict that only 7% of objects is expected to experience persistent circulation of the relative mean longitude with respect to pluto ; therefore , the identification of one of these unusual objects provides a useful constraint for models studying the dynamics of the outer solar system as well as giant planet migration .",
    "regarding the origin of 15810 , its currently very stable orbit suggests that it is not relatively recent debris originated in collisions within pluto s system but perhaps a primordial plutino formed around the same epoch pluto came into existence .",
    "the object studied here may be part of an outer solar system analogue to the population of main belt asteroids recently found co - orbiting with the dwarf planet ( 1 ) ceres and the large asteroid ( 4 ) vesta ( christou & wiegert 2012 ) . although the figures have been computed using the nominal orbit in table [ orb ] , the other simulations gave very similar results , over the time interval shown .",
    "pluto s system continues being a source of controversy , unanswered questions and surprises more than 80 years after its discovery .",
    "pluto s planethood demotion in august 2006 still stirs debate today and the recent finding of a fifth moon orbiting pluto by the hst just confirms the unexpectedly complex nature of the system . in our work , we show that 15810 currently follows a quasi - satellite orbit relative to pluto ; therefore and besides having 5 regular satellites , pluto has at least one quasi - satellite .",
    "this makes 15810 the first minor body found moving in a 1:1 mean motion resonance with pluto and the first quasi - satellite found in the trans - neptunian region of the solar system .",
    "it also makes pluto the second dwarf planet , besides ceres , to host a quasi - satellite .",
    "our finding also confirms that the quasi - satellite resonant phase is not restricted to small bodies orbiting major planets but it is possible for dwarf planets / asteroids too .",
    "we also provide a new and somewhat unexpected mechanism to land minor bodies into the quasi - satellite dynamical state .",
    "on the other hand , plutino 15810 is a natural candidate for a spacecraft rendezvous mission in the framework of nasa s pluto - kuiper belt mission new horizons that is going to complete a flyby with pluto in 2015 and then continue to explore one or more nearby trans - neptunian objects in the time frame 2016 - 2020 .",
    "it is moving in such an orbit that this object could be a good candidate for a body dynamically related to the pluto - charon formation event , and the determination of the physical properties of its surface by spectroscopic observations could be interesting in that respect . if 15810 is selected for the extended mission it will open the possibility of studying in detail for the first time a minor body in the quasi - satellite dynamical state .",
