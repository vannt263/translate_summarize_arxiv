    "it is therefore of great interest to develop theoretical approaches for fes .",
    "series analysis has proved to be one of the most accurate and reliable approaches to critical phenomena , in both equilibrium and nonequilibrium contexts @xcite .",
    "series expansion typically functions best in low - dimensional systems ( because longer series can be derived ) , that is , for just those systems in which the renormalization group and expansion about an upper critical dimension @xmath5 are less reliable . in the case of sandpiles , systematic epsilon expansions are as yet unavailable , and the value of @xmath5 in fact remains controversial @xcite .",
    "simulation results suggest novel critical behavior in the one - dimensional fes , although conflicting critical exponent values have been reported @xcite , which may reflect finite - size effects .",
    "series expansions , on the other hand , implicity treat the infinite - size limit , and so provide important information , complementary to that afforded by simulations . in light of these observations , we believe it highly desirable to apply series methods to sandpile models .",
    "this paper is one of a series analyzing a stochastic sandpile using operator methods . in an earlier work @xcite a path - integral representation",
    "was developed and an expansion derived for the order parameter ( activity density ) in powers of time . while the path - integral formalism reveals interesting features of the model , and",
    "may be applied in any number of dimensions , the complexity of the diagrammatic expansion limits the number of terms that can be obtained .",
    "@xcite terms up to @xmath6 are reported . ) in this paper we employ a different approach , which permits us to extend the series for the one - dimensional case considerably .",
    "after casting the master equation for the sandpile in terms of an operator formalism , we analyze the direct expansion of its ( formal ) solution , leading to an algorithm for generating the series coefficients .",
    "we consider manna s stochastic sandpile in its fixed - energy ( particle - conserving ) version @xcite .",
    "the configuration is specified by the occupation number @xmath7 at each site ; sites with @xmath8 are said to be _ active _ , and have a positive rate of _",
    "toppling_. when a site topples , it loses exactly two particles (  grains of sand \" ) , which move randomly and independently to nearest - neighbor ( nn ) sites .",
    "( any configuration devoid of active sites is _ absorbing _ , i.e. , no futher evolution of the system is possible once such a configuration is reached . ) in this work , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we adopt a toppling rate of @xmath9 at a site having @xmath7 particles , which leads us to define the order parameter as @xmath10 . while this choice of rate represents a slight departure from the usual definition ( in which all active sites have the same toppling rate ) , it leads to a much simpler evolution operator , and should yield the same scaling properties @xcite .",
    "preliminary simulation results @xcite indicate that in one dimension the model exhibits a continuous phase transition at @xmath11 .    in the following section we define the model and",

    "the restriction on sequences follows from equations ( [ lcons ] ) and ( [ comm0 ] ) ; if the condition were violated , it would be possible to move one of the @xmath30 to the left of all other operators , yielding a result of zero .",
    "our strategy for evaluating @xmath46 is to commute each @xmath30 to the left of @xmath47 .",

    "\\label{cpqr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    using this result , we can evaluate the reduced commutators in a computer algorithm .",
    "let us discuss some details of the computer algorithm used to generate the series for the activity .",
    "we employ a recursive procedure to generate the contributions of order @xmath71 on the basis of those of order @xmath7 . from equation ( [ act ] ) and with a poisson - product initial distribution defined in equation ( [ psi0 ] ) we notice that @xmath72_r \\ , e^{tl}|p\\rangle=-\\rho+\\langle \\ ,    \\label{drho}\\ ] ] the last equality above may be understood using the reduced commutators ( [ cr00 ] ) and ( [ cr01 ] ) . using reflection symmetry , we have @xmath73_r \\ , e^{tl}|p\\rangle = \\langle \\ , |",
    "\\{[a_0 ^ 2,l_0]_r+2[a_0 ^ 2,l_1]_r \\ } e^{tl}|p\\rangle$ ] and further simplification is provided by translation symmetry .",
    "the coefficient of @xmath37 in the expansion of the activity may be identified with @xmath74 , where @xmath75 using the procedure described above we obtain a recursion relation @xmath76 where @xmath77 $ ] and @xmath78 . to complete the algorithm",
    ", we have that @xmath79 , where relation ( [ exppa ] ) is used . an immediate consequence of these recursion relations is that the coefficient of @xmath80 in the term of order @xmath7 in @xmath27 is given by @xmath81 , since each monomial in the functions @xmath82 has at least three annihilation operators@xcite .",
    "this was already shown in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the calculations were done in two steps .",
    "initially , the functions @xmath82 were calculated up to order 12 .",
    "each monomial was represented by three integer variables : an eight - byte integer for the numerator of the coefficient , a four - byte integer for the denominator ( which is always a power of 2 ) , and another eight - byte integer to store the number of factors of each annihilation operator .",
    "since all calculations are done in integer arithmetic , there are no roundoff errors . using translation invariance ,",
    "each monomial was put in a form such that the the annihilation operator of lowest spatial index is @xmath83 .",
    "the power @xmath84 associated with each annihilation operator @xmath85 ( as in equation ( [ exppa ] ) ) is stored in four bits of the eight - byte integer variable mentioned above . as each new monomial",
    "is generated , a search is performed for any existing term with the same set of powers ; storing all powers in a single integer facilitates the search . as a consequence of equation ( [ comm0 ] ) ,",
    "when the reduced commutator of a monomial with @xmath86 is calculated , nonzero contributions may arise only from the commutator of the monomial with @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , where @xmath17 is the largest index in the monomial .",
    "as is clear from equation ( [ cpqr ] ) , each of these commutators can give rise to up to seven new monomials .",
    "thus , it is apparent that the number of monomials grows very rapidly as the order is increased ; the function @xmath90 involves @xmath91 monomials . to go beyond order 12",
    "it is necessary to handle integers larger than can be represented using eight bytes and to process monomials with more than 16 exponents , which can no longer be stored in a single 8-bite integer variable .",
    "in fact , at order 12 most of the processing time is used in the search procedure .",
    "therefore , our results from order 13 to 16 were obtained processing the monomials in @xmath90 one - by - one , generating all contributions from it at orders 13 - 16 . in these calculations the numerators",
    "were represented by two eight - byte integers .",
    "the limiting order ( 16 ) is determined by the large number of new monomials generated ; a single monomial in @xmath92 may generate on the order of 40 monomials in @xmath93 .",
    "the results presented here required about 170 hours of cpu time on an athlon k7 1800 mhz computer .",
    "it is convenient to write the expansion in the form : @xmath94 the series coefficients @xmath95 are listed in table i. in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that @xmath96 , with @xmath97 the coefficients reported in table i satisfy this relation at each order , and agree with those derived ( for @xmath98 ) using the path - integral formalism @xcite .",
    "the coefficients @xmath99 in the time series , equation ( [ bnm ] ) , grow rapidly with @xmath7 ; the rate of growth appears to be faster than exponential .",
    "this is evident from an analysis of @xmath100    to see if the @xmath101 follow a systematic trend we analyze these quantities for a given @xmath102 .",
    "( for a fixed value of @xmath7 , the @xmath101 appear to trace out a smooth curve , so that @xmath103 for intermediate values of @xmath104 can be estimated via interpolation . ) as shown in figure 1 , @xmath103 appears to grow faster than exponentially with @xmath7 , away from the limits @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "( observe that for @xmath107 , @xmath108 as @xmath109 since @xmath110 , and similarly for @xmath111 , since equation ( [ last ] ) implies that @xmath112 grows more slowly than @xmath113 . ) a reasonable description of the dominant growth in the series coefficientes is @xmath114 , with the exponent @xmath115 ( see the inset of figure 1 ) taking its maximum value of about 1.2 for @xmath116 .",
    "this of course implies faster - than - exponential growth for the coefficients @xmath99 .",
    "next we examine the behavior of the coefficients in the time series for specific values of the particle density @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath117 where @xmath118 for @xmath119 ( slightly above the critical value of 0.9493 ) , @xmath120 is simply the sum of all coefficients at order @xmath7 , divided by @xmath113 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath120 again grow faster than exponentially , with @xmath121 for @xmath119 and @xmath122 for @xmath123 .",
    "( given the limited number of coefficients , we can not make very precise estimates of the exponent .",
    "the key point is that the growth appears to be faster than exponential . )",
    "these results imply that equation ( [ rhot ] ) is a _ divergent series _ with zero radius of convergence .",
    "we turn now to an analysis of the series for @xmath124 .",
    "as is well known , it is often possible to obtain useful results from divergent series by means of a resummation technique . in the present case we construct pad approximants to the time series or to the series obtained via a transformation of variable @xcite .",
    "we have examined many transformations , for example @xmath125 @xmath126 @xmath127 @xmath128 and @xmath129 \\right\\ } \\;.",
    "\\label{ste}\\ ] ]    each transformation maps the interval @xmath130 to a finite interval , and can be expanded as a power series in @xmath27 about @xmath131 , with the lowest - order term @xmath132 .",
    "each is readily inverted permitting one to express the time @xmath27 in powers of the new variable .",
    "the slow convergence associated with the power - law or logarithmic forms in the last four expressions is motivated by the numerical finding of slow relaxation in the sandpile model , even far from the critical point @xcite .",
    "we analyze the transformed series for @xmath133 ( or for @xmath134 ) using pad approximants .",
    "the degree of success depends greatly on the range of @xmath0 under consideration .",
    "( each transformation includes a free parameter @xmath135 , which can be adjusted to optimize the regularity of the result , or to obtain consistency between different approximants . except where noted",
    ", the results do not exhibit much sensitivity to the choice of this parameter . )    for small values of @xmath0 , the best results are obtained via pad approximants to the @xmath27-series _ without _ any transformation of variable .",
    "figure 2 compares series predictions for @xmath136 ( obtained using the [ 6,7 ] , [ 7,8 ] and [ 7,9 ] approximants to the series for @xmath124 ) against the result of a monte carlo simulation for a system of 500 sites ( for @xmath136 finite - size effects are negligible at this system size ) .",
    "the [ 7,8 ] approximant is reliable for @xmath137 .",
    "( various other approximants , such as [ 8,8 ] and [ 7,7 ] , are ill - behaved and provide reasonable predictions only for quite short times , typically @xmath138 . )",
    "we have not been able to improve the series prediction for longer times , either by a change of variable or through analysis of @xmath139 or its time derivative .",
    "although some improvement could be expected with longer series , it appears unlikely that the asymptotic decay of @xmath124 in the subcritical regime will be accessible through analysis of an expansion in powers of time .    for larger values of @xmath0",
    "the transformation defined in equation ( [ gamma ] ) , using @xmath140 , is the most useful of those studied . in figure 3",
    "we compare the [ 8,8 ] approximant ( obtained using @xmath141 ) with simulation data for @xmath119 .",
    "the situation is markedly better than for @xmath142 : the series prediction accompanies the simulation result up to around @xmath143",
    ". it must be noted , however , that the good agreement seen here depends on the choice of the transformation parameter @xmath135 . for other values",
    "the agreement with simulation is not as good .",
    "( a more suitable criterion for choosing @xmath135 would be by seeking agreement among various approximants @xcite . in the present case",
    "this is not possible because the off - diagonal approximants to the @xmath144 series are ill - behaved , while the [ 7,7 ] approximant behaves very similarly to the [ 8,8 ] used here . ) despite the good agreement up to times on the order of 1000 , the present series seems incapable of capturing the asymptotic long - time relaxation of @xmath124 , which is non - monotonic , as shown in figure 3 .",
    "remarkably , the reliability of the series improves dramatically at larger values of the particle density @xmath0 . series and simulation results for @xmath124 at @xmath123",
    "are compared in figure 4 ; the maximum relative error is about 0.1% .",
    "( the series prediction is generated as for @xmath119 , but using @xmath145 in this case . ) the good agreement , moreover , persists at long times , motivating a study of @xmath146 , corresponding to the transformed series with @xmath147 in equation ( [ gamma ] ) .",
    "( we again use the [ 8,8 ] approximant to the @xmath144-series . )    the series prediction for @xmath148 is compared with simulation in figure 5 , using parameters @xmath149 and @xmath150 .",
    "excellent agreement is found for @xmath151 , the relative error being @xmath152 .",
    "the smaller @xmath135 value yields better results for @xmath153 , whereas slightly better results are obtained for larger @xmath0 , using the larger @xmath135 value .",
    "for @xmath151 we may claim quantitative accuracy for the series prediction .",
    "nearer the critical point , the agreement appears reasonable ( at least on the scale of figure 5 ) , but it is clear that the 16-term series can not be used to study critical properties .",
    "for example , the prediction using @xmath149 yields a critical value of about 0.906 , that is , the extrapolated activity density goes to zero at this @xmath0 value .",
    "the critical value found in simulations is 0.9493 .    in summary",
    ", the present series seems quite reliable in the supercritical regime , both at short and at asymptotically long times , whereas its utility in the critical and subcritical regimes is restricted to rather short times . just above the critical point ,",
    "rather good predictions are possible for short and intermediate times , but this depends on a judicious choice of the transformation parameter @xmath135 .",
    "we develop an algebraic method leading to a time series for the activity density of the stochastic sandpile model introduced in @xcite .",
    "determination of the series coefficients depends on evaluation of certain commutators , an algebraic task readily codified in a computational algorithm .",
    "we extend the series for the one - dimensional case to sixteen terms .",
    "analysis of the series yields disappointing results for the subcritical and critical regimes , but very good predictions in the supercritical region , as judged by comparison with monte carlo simulation . at first glance",
    "this is surprising , since in the subcritical regime the stationary state is inactive and might be regarded as trivial .",
    "relaxation to this inactive state ( and to the active state at or near the critical point @xmath154 ) is however nontrivial , characterized by stretched exponential , power - law , or other slowly - converging forms @xcite .",
    "it appears to be very difficult to capture such behavior in the kind of temporal series developed here , which employs a poissonian initial distribution .",
    "the reason is that for smaller values of the particle density ( @xmath155 , say ) , the one - site stationary occupation distribution @xmath156 is far from poissonian . as @xmath0 increases , the second factorial moment @xmath157 approaches @xmath80 , as expected for a poisson distribution .",
    "figure 7 shows that the stationary one - site distribution observed in simulations approaches the corresponding poisson distribution with the same density @xmath0 .",
    "( even for @xmath158 there are significant differences between the distributions ; but analysis of the third and fourth factorial moments suggests convergence to a poisson distribution as @xmath159 . )    an important open question is whether simply increasing the number of terms would permit one to analyze the small-@xmath0 regime .",
    "the present results suggest that even with 20 or 30 terms this region would remain inaccessible .",
    "it appears to be more promising to approach the critical region from above , since for larger particle densities we find good agreement with numerical results . in this context",
    "it is interesting that the quality of predictions near the critical point improves greatly on going from 12 to 16 terms .",
    "this suggests that further extension of the series , to 20 or more terms , would yield quantitative results for critical properties , through study of relaxational properties at @xmath154 , or or of stationary properties ( as in figure 5 ) as @xmath154 is approached from above .",
    "it would also be of great interest to develop an expansion for a stationary property such as @xmath148 directly in powers of the particle density @xmath0 , but this appears to be much more difficult than deriving an expansion in powers of the time .",
