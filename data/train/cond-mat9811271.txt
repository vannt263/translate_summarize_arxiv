    "@xmath0 ( pr-123 ) is the anomalous member among the orthorhombic fully doped @xmath10 ( @xmath11y , rare earth ) cuprates ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "the transition temperature @xmath12 for antiferromagnetic ( afm ) ordering of the pr magnetic moments , usually accepted as 17  k , @xcite is one or two orders of magnitude higher than exhibited by the other members of that series .",
    "moreover , magnetic ordering in the cu(2 ) sublattice was found at @xmath13  280  k even though the compound is oxygen rich @xcite .",
    "it was generally believed that pr-123 is the only nonsuperconducting compound in that row , but very recently an indication on superconductivity was reported for pr-123 grown by the traveling - solvent floating - zone method @xcite , see also ref .",
    "this result is in sharp contrast to those obtained for crystals grown by the flux method ( see comment @xcite on ref .",
    "@xcite ) and more work is necessary to clarify the situation .",
    "several models have been proposed to explain the absence of superconductivity in pr-123 including ( i ) a valence of the pr ion considerably greater than + 3 , ( ii ) magnetic pair breaking , ( iii ) pr ions on ba sites @xcite , and ( iv ) hybridization of pr and @xmath14 layers ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the situation with the pr valence in pr-123 is not completely clear up to now , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite , although strong evidence was obtained from inelastic neutron scattering @xcite and spectroscopic data @xcite for the predominance of + 3 valence of pr and pr  4@xmath15o  2@xmath16 hybridization .",
    "this hybridization should not only lead to the suppression of superconductivity but also to a considerable enhancement of the exchange interaction between the @xmath7 magnetic moments resulting in ( i ) a stabilization of the low - temperature non - zero value of these moments ( which would vanish for dominating crystal field interactions ) and ( ii ) an increase of @xmath12 .",
    "although a @xmath17-type anomaly at @xmath12 was found from specific heat measurements @xcite , the magnetic susceptibility @xmath18 of pr-123 continues to increase with decreasing temperature @xmath19 even below @xmath12 , @xcite contrary to the decrease of @xmath18 below @xmath12 usually observed for afm ordering .",
    "only a weak change of the slope in the @xmath20 dependence was found even for single crystals . in the first neutron diffraction study @xcite",
    "a simple magnetic structure was proposed in which the pr moments ( 0.74  @xmath21 ) point along the orthorhombic @xmath22 axis and alternate antiferromagnetically in all three crystallographic directions . on the other hand , mssbauer spectroscopy @xcite revealed afm ordering with the moments tilted away from the @xmath22 axis by an angle @xmath23=65@xmath24 .",
    "tilting of magnetic moments has been also found by neutron diffraction @xcite .",
    "all these results were questioned by the authors of nmr experiments @xcite , concluding that the pr moment lies in the @xmath25-plane and is only 0.017  @xmath21 .",
    "this work was recently strongly criticized by boothroyd @xmath26 , @xcite who have investigated al - free single crystals by neutron diffraction and found @xmath23=35@xmath24 and @xmath27=0.56  @xmath21 .",
    "moreover they observed , that the pr ordering is accompanied by a counterrotation of the antiferromagnetic arrangement on the bilayer @xmath14 planes about the @xmath22 axis with establishing of a noncollinear ordering of cu moments below @xmath12 .",
    "it was underlined @xcite that from symmetry considerations the coexistence of magnetic order on the @xmath28 pr and cu sublattices is not only consistent with , but even @xmath29 a reorientation of the cu magnetic structure during pr magnetic ordering , see also ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "these reported results show , that the nature of magnetic ordering in pr-123 is rather complicated .",
    "previous magnetic measurements @xcite were performed on crystals grown in alumina crucibles , which leads to dissolving of al in the sample .",
    "it is well known , that al impurities can considerably influence the properties of cuprates ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in the present work",
    "we have studied the magnetic properties of high quality al - free pr-123 single crystals .",
    "pr-123 single crystals were grown in pt crucibles by the flux method @xcite .",
    "electron - probe microanalysis has shown that the concentration of impurities in the crystals does not exceed the detection limit of the instrument used ( @xmath30  1  at .",
    "lower traces of impurities and especially of pt can not be excluded .",
    "( the only known crucible s material that can give the ppm level of detrimental impurities in the flux grown pr-123 crystals is unreactive bazro@xmath31 @xcite ) .",
    "x - ray analysis has revealed single phase twinned orthorhombic material with lattice parameters @xmath32=3.868 , @xmath33=3.911 , and @xmath22=11.702   .",
    "the crystals were annealed at @xmath19=450@xmath24 in oxygen flow during one week .",
    "two samples with the dimensions @xmath34",
    "mm@xmath35 and masses of 1.48 and 1.40  mg have been investigated .",
    "very similar results have been obtained for both crystals .",
    "the magnetization of the samples with field parallel ( @xmath36 ) and perpendicular ( @xmath37 ) to the @xmath22-axis was measured at 1.7  k  @xmath38  300  k and @xmath39  48  koe by a quantum design squid magnetometer .",
    "magnetic susceptibility ( determined as , e.g. , @xmath40 ) has been measured typically at @xmath41=10  koe .",
    "the temperature dependence of the inverse magnetic susceptibility is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for the both directions of @xmath41 .",
    "the best fits of the data for 50  k  @xmath42  300  k to a modified curie - weiss law including a temperature independent @xmath43 , see ref .",
    "@xcite , are shown by lines in fig .",
    "the values of the pr effective paramagnetic moment obtained from this fit are 2.9 and 3.1  @xmath21 for @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively .",
    "these values are in good agreement with previously published data for poly- and single crystals @xcite as well as with calculations of @xmath20 based on the results of inelastic neutron scattering @xcite and taking into account the effect of crystalline electric field ( cef ) splitting of the pr@xmath46 free ion multiplet .",
    "the obtained values of @xmath18(300  k ) are also in agreement with these calculations for pr@xmath46 and are approximately two times greater than the calculated value @xcite for pr@xmath47 .",
    "the observed sign of magnetic anisotropy ( @xmath48 ) corresponds to the schemes of cef splitting of the low lying quasitriplet ( well separated from higher levels of pr@xmath46 ) proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite . the other sign of anisotropy ( @xmath49 ) was proposed by assuming another scheme of levels @xcite .",
    "this result is not in agreement with our data .",
    "it should be noted , that the conclusions from nmr experiments , @xcite i.e. , @xmath49 , a very small value of @xmath27 , and temperature independence of @xmath18 at @xmath50 20  k are in strong disagreement with our results .",
    "so , our data can be considered as a further evidence for the @xmath51 valence of pr in pr-123 with the scheme of levels proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite or @xcite .",
    "the anisotropy of @xmath18 is clearly seen in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2]a .",
    "the degree of magnetic anisotropy @xmath52 is @xmath5310% at @xmath19=300  k and increases with decreasing temperature to the value @xmath5360% at @xmath19=15  k ( see the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig2]a ) .",
    "this value is considerably larger , than that reported for crystals grown in alumina crucibles @xcite ( @xmath5310% at @xmath19=5  k ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2]a distinct kinks in @xmath20 are clearly visible for the both field directions .",
    "earlier , the anomaly at @xmath12 for oxygen rich pr-123 could be seen only in the temperature dependence of the derivative @xcite @xmath54 and in the anisotropy of @xmath20 @xcite but not for the @xmath20 dependence itself .",
    "( it should be pointed out , that the corresponding anomaly in @xmath20 at @xmath12 was observed for oxygen depleted pr-123 crystals @xcite . ) the maxima in the @xmath55 vs @xmath19 dependencies marked by the arrow in fig .",
    "[ fig2]b are located at @xmath13  15  k. in accordance with @xcite we consider the position of the maximum as @xmath12 .",
    "this value is slightly lower than the usually cited @xcite value of @xmath12=17  k. however , depending on sample preparation techniques and methods of measurements , the value of @xmath12 varies from 11 to 20  k @xcite even for oxygen rich compounds . for oxygen reduced samples values of @xmath56  11  k were reported @xcite",
    ". it is well known , that it is difficult to oxidize the cuprates single crystals .",
    "therefore , oxygen deficiency could be a reason for the lower value of @xmath12 for our crystals .",
    "the data obtained for the two directions of @xmath41 after zero field cooling zfc have been marked by the open symbols connected by lines in both parts of fig .  [ fig2 ] .",
    "unexpectedly , field cooling fc from @xmath19=40  k in a field of @xmath41=20  koe for @xmath44-plane suppresses fully the anomaly in @xmath1 ( solid symbols in lower curves in figs .",
    "[ fig2]a and b ) . at the same time fc for @xmath45-axis even in a field of @xmath41=48  koe has no influence on @xmath3 and @xmath57 curves ( solid symbols in upper curves ) .",
    "for @xmath44-plane the influence of fc in one order of magnitude smaller field , @xmath41=5  koe , on @xmath57 curve was observed ( not shown here ) .",
    "after zfc the field itself does not destroy the kink in @xmath20 .",
    "only a decrease of the peak in the @xmath58 curve was observed by increasing the field .",
    "this decrease is more pronounced for @xmath44-plane .",
    "it should be underlined , that fc has not only an effect on @xmath20 curves but , in the case of @xmath44-plane , it @xmath59 the anomaly in the @xmath1 dependence suggesting the suppression of afm ordering of the pr magnetic moments by fc in @xmath44-plane .",
    "the distinct anomaly in the @xmath20 dependence for our high quality single crystals makes it possible to see clearly a decrease of @xmath12 with increasing field , see fig .",
    "earlier , a shift @xmath60 was not observed in @xmath20 experiments in fields up to 90  koe @xcite contrary to the results of specific heat measurements @xcite which clearly indicated such a shift .",
    "our results are in good agreement with the specific heat data of uma @xmath26 , @xcite obtained on crystals with @xmath61=16.6  k , and with the proposed by them @xmath62 dependence .",
    "we have also studied the isothermal magnetization of the pr-123 crystals at 1.7  k  @xmath42  40  k. some of the obtained results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4]a for the both directions of field . at all temperatures the @xmath63 dependencies are nearly linear and",
    "the magnetic anisotropy is more pronounced at lower temperatures . for comparison the magnetization curves of a @xmath64 ( ypr-123 ) single crystal @xcite grown under the same conditions",
    "are also shown for @xmath19=5  k. the @xmath65 curve for ypr-123 is close to the corresponding @xmath65 curve for pr-123 , whereas the @xmath66 curve for ypr-123 lies somewhat higher giving a smaller degree of the magnetic anisotropy .",
    "the stronger magnetic anisotropy for the pure pr-123 may be caused by some anisotropic ( e.g. pseudodipolar ) type of interaction between the @xmath7 ions because the crystal fields acting on @xmath7 should not be affected by the dilution of pr by y.    analyzing the derivative of @xmath66 we observed a change in the behavior at certain transition fields @xmath67 marked in fig .",
    "[ fig4]b by vertical arrows .",
    "whereas @xmath68 is almost constant at low fields , @xmath69 , it decreases for @xmath70 . for the sake of simplicity",
    "the low and high field parts of the data were approximated by straight lines as shown on fig .",
    "careful analysis of @xmath68 curves at @xmath19=1.7  k , 2.7  k ( not shown in the picture ) , and 5  k has revealed the tendency of @xmath68 to increase with increasing field just below @xmath67 . a more rapid increase of @xmath71 and hence an increase of @xmath72 below the transition field is a characteristic feature of field induced phase transitions ( fipt ) @xcite .",
    "the observed behavior can be considered as an indication on a weak fipt in pr-123 at transition field @xmath67 ( probably of spin - reorientation type ) .",
    "the exact nature of this transition has to be settled .",
    "similarly as the anomaly in the @xmath1 dependence this fipt can be suppressed by fc in @xmath44-plane .",
    "it can be seen from the @xmath68 dependence obtained at @xmath19=5  k after fc and shown on fig .",
    "[ fig4]b by crosses connected by dotted lines .",
    "obviously there is no indication of a fipt for this curve .",
    "the fc @xmath68 curve for pr-123 measured at @xmath19=5  k is similar to the corresponding zfc curve for the ypr-123 crystal ( not shown in the picture ) , for which no anomaly in @xmath20 was observed even after zfc .",
    "it should be also noted , that the field dependence of the anisotropy parameter @xmath73 at @xmath19=5  k has a clearly visible minimum at @xmath74  30  koe ( marked by vertical arrow in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig4]a ) , that is very close to @xmath67(5  k ) obtained from the @xmath68 curve shown in fig .  [ fig4]b .",
    "this minimum can be considered as another manifestation of fipt in pr-123 .",
    "on the other hand , the @xmath75 vs @xmath41 curve for ypr-123 ( see the inset of fig .  [ fig4]a ) does not indicate any transition .",
    "the fipt was observed also for @xmath45-axis , the value of @xmath76 being about two times higher , than for @xmath44-plane . a magnetic phase diagram for the fipts in pr-123 is shown in fig .  [ fig5 ] .",
    "the estimation of @xmath77 for @xmath44-plane gives 31  koe .",
    "the observed fipts are very weak .",
    "therefore , a more complicated phase diagram can not be excluded .    for the interpretation of the observed results the mentioned above model @xcite of the coupled cu and pr sublattices can be used . in that model",
    "the pr ordering is accompanied by the reorientation of the cu magnetic structure due to the pr - cu magnetic interaction .",
    "( very recently it was found @xcite , that pr sublattice in fact orders in a long period incommensurate structure just below @xmath12 and reorders to commensurate afm structure at lower temperatures . ) since the influence of fc has been observed by us only for @xmath44-plane , it should be connected with cu moments , lying in the @xmath25-plane @xcite .",
    "at the same time , the weak fipts observed at @xmath78 for both directions of @xmath41 are connected most probably with the reorientation transitions of pr moments , tilted away from the @xmath22 axis @xcite .",
    "the mechanism of the proposed suppression of @xmath7 afm ordering by fc in @xmath44-plane may be as follows . during fc",
    "the cu moments could be frozen by sufficiently strong @xmath44-plane .",
    "freezing of cu magnetic moments hinders the afm ordering in the pr sublattice due to coupling with the magnetic cu sublattice .",
    "there are some indications on frustration in the cu magnetic structure as well as on short range ordering in the cu sublattice @xcite .",
    "therefore , it may be favorable for the cu moments to freeze during fc in @xmath44-plane .",
    "so , the observed behaviour can be considered as an evidence for the existence of considerable coupling between the cu and pr magnetic sublattices in pr-123 .",
    "we have observed for pr-123 single crystals a large magnetic anisotropy and a kink in the @xmath20 dependence , connected with pr afm ordering . a practically complete suppression of the kink after fc in @xmath44 was found . at the same time this anomaly remained uninfluenced by fc in @xmath45 .",
    "a possible explanation of these observations is connected with the magnetic coupling between the cu and pr sublattices and the suppression of afm ordering in the pr sublattice by freezing of cu moments , lying in the @xmath25-plane , caused by fc in @xmath44 .",
    "weak fipts found for both directions of @xmath41 are connected most probably with a pr@xmath46 spin - reorientation ."
