    "a domain @xmath0 is called a _ quadrature domain _ if it admits a formula for the integration of any harmonic and integrable function @xmath1 in @xmath2 , @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a distribution ( independent of @xmath5 ) such that @xmath6 . in particular , when @xmath4 is a measure , then by applying ( [ eq : qfgen ] ) to the newtonian kernel it results that the external potential of the body @xmath2 with density one is equal to the potential of the measure @xmath4 .",
    "if @xmath4 is a finitely - supported distribution of finite - order ( so the right - hand - side of ( [ eq : qfgen ] ) is a finite sum of weighted point evaluations of @xmath5 and its partial derivatives ) , then @xmath2 is referred to as a _ quadrature domain in the classical sense_. there are many examples of quadrature domains in the classical sense in the plane , where conformal mappings can be used to construct them ( see e.g. @xcite ) . but in higher dimensional spaces , very few explicit examples are known @xcite , and the only known explicit example involving simple point evaluations ( with no partial derivatives appearing ) is the ball .",
    "there are however existence results for such quadrature domains @xcite .",
    "one of the simplest non - trivial examples of a quadrature domain ( in the classical sense ) in the plane is the region whose boundary is described by the real algebraic curve ( excluding the origin ) : @xmath7    this curve is referred to as neumann s oval ( it is also known as the hypopede of booth ) . denoting this region by @xmath2 ,",
    "the quadrature formula is a sum of two point evaluations : @xmath8 where the coefficient @xmath9 is a function of @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",

    ", we refer to a domain @xmath0 as a",
    "_ neumann ovaloid _ if it admits a quadrature formula having two quadrature nodes with equal weights .",
    "we will consider the case of a four - dimensional neumann ovaloid @xmath12 satisfying : @xmath13 for some positive constant @xmath14 .",
    "as one should expect , @xmath2 is axially - symmetric ( see the next paragraph below ) .",
    "however , the axially - symmetric domain in @xmath15 generated by the rotation of a two - dimensional neumann oval is not a neumann ovaloid , and in fact , it is not even a quadrature domain in the classical sense .",
    "instead , as the first author showed in @xcite , it has a quadrature formula supported on the whole segment joining the original quadrature points .",
    "concerning uniqueness , suppose that the distribution @xmath4 of ( [ eq : qfgen ] ) is a non  negative measure with compact support in a hyperplane , as in the case of interest ( [ eq : qf ] ) .",
    "if @xmath2 is a bounded quadrature domain for @xmath4 , then @xmath2 is symmetric with respect to the same hyperplane and the complement of the closure of @xmath2 is connected .",
    "this result was proved by sakai in the plane @xcite , and for the @xmath16-dimensional case see @xcite .",
    "we may apply this to every hyperplane passing through the two quadrature points in order to conclude that the neumann ovaloid @xmath2 is axially symmetric    since the neumann ovaloid @xmath2 is axially symmetric and has connected complement of its closure , it must be generated by rotation of a simply connected planar domain @xmath17 . invoking the riemann mapping theorem , there is a conformal map @xmath18 from the unit disk @xmath19 to @xmath17 , and @xmath18 is unique once the value of @xmath20 and @xmath21 are prescribed . in order to construct @xmath2",
    ", it thus suffices to determine explicitly the conformal map @xmath18 .",
    "[ thm : neumannovaloid ] let @xmath22 be the quadrature domain that satisfies the formula ( [ eq : qf ] ) , and let @xmath17 denote the simply connected domain that generates @xmath2 by rotation .",
    "let @xmath18 be the conformal map from the unit disk @xmath19 to @xmath17 such that @xmath23 and @xmath24",

    "there are existence results for point mass quadrature domains @xcite ; the important attribute of theorem [ thm : neumannovaloid ] is the explicit formula for the domain . for each @xmath11 and @xmath14 ,",
    "the neumann ovaloid ( [ eq : qf ] ) is unique , this follows from the uniqueness of bounded quadrature domains for non  negative measures with compact support in a hyperplane ( see @xcite ) .    in section [ sec : prelim ] , we review some essential background on axially symmetric quadrature domains in @xmath15 following @xcite .",
    "we prove theorem [ thm : neumannovaloid ] in section [ sec : main ] . the proof is based on the approach introduced in @xcite where a. eremenko and the second author used it to give a negative answer to the question of h.s .",
    "shapiro @xcite on the algebraicity of quadrature domains in @xmath28 dimensions . in section [ sec : constants ] we describe how @xmath29 and @xmath30 of formula ( [ eq : conf ] ) are related when @xmath31 is fixed , and we show that the quadrature formula for the ball is recovered from ( [ eq : qf ] ) in the limit as @xmath29 and @xmath30 tend to zero . in section [ sec : numerical ] , we present some graphics based on numerical implementation of theorem [ thm : neumannovaloid ] .",
    "here we review an algebraic technique that applies to axially symmetric quadrature domains in @xmath32 . for further details see @xcite . an equivalent definition of the quadrature domain ( [ eq : qfgen ] ) is by the free boundary problem @xmath33    the two notions are equivalent when the domain @xmath34 is bounded and the distribution @xmath4 is compactly supported in @xmath2 .",
    "a solution @xmath5 to the overdetermined system ( [ eq : sp ] ) is called the _",
    "schwarz potential _ of @xmath2 .    in the case of the neumann ovaloid ( [ eq : qf ] ) , the distribution @xmath4 , as well as the domain",
    "@xmath2 has axial symmetry about the @xmath35axis .",
    "hence the schwarz potential @xmath5 can be represented by a function of two variables , namely @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 for negative @xmath39",
    ". then the function @xmath40 satisfies the free boundary problem @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the domain whose rotation generates @xmath2 .",
    "the main idea is to set @xmath43 , then @xmath44 satisfies the cauchy problem @xmath45 this enables us to solve the free boundary problem ( [ eq : free - b ] ) by means of the schwarz function . indeed , letting @xmath46 and @xmath47 , then on the boundary @xmath48 , @xmath49 where @xmath50 .",
    "next , we replace @xmath51 by @xmath52 on the boundary @xmath48 , and we obtain @xmath53 as the solution to the cauchy problem ( [ eq : cauchy ] ) ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 2.3 ) ) .",
    "the representation of the solution @xmath44 by ( [ eq : int ] ) implies that the singularities of @xmath54 determine the distribution @xmath4 in ( [ eq : sp ] ) .",
    "since we are interested only in the structure of the distribution @xmath4 , we may perturb this expression by a holomorphic function .",
    "thus we conclude that the singularities of the expression @xmath55 govern the distribution @xmath4 .    due to the axial symmetry , the support of the distribution @xmath4 is on the @xmath56axis .",
    "so if the expression in ( [ eq:9 ] ) has non  vanishing residue at the points @xmath57 , then in the integration ( [ eq : int ] ) causes to a logarithmic term and consequently the support of @xmath4 is on a segment joining these two points .",
    "this implies that @xmath2 will not be point masses quadrature domain .",
    "for example , if @xmath17 is the neumann oval ( [ eq : neumannoval ] ) , then @xmath58 where @xmath59 is holomorphic in @xmath17 .",
    "however , if we require that @xmath60 then @xmath61 with @xmath62 harmonic in @xmath17 . recalling that @xmath63 , we see that the singular part of the schwarz potential ( [ eq : sp ] ) comprises the expression @xmath64 , which is the fundamental solution of the laplacian in @xmath15 at the points @xmath65 .",
    "hence @xmath66 is the distribution of the schwarz potential ( [ eq : sp ] ) and consequently the rotation of @xmath17 yields the neumann ovaloid ( [ eq : qf ] ) , here @xmath67 denote the dirac measure .",
    "as in the statement of theorem [ thm : neumannovaloid ] , take @xmath18 to be the conformal map from the unit disk @xmath19 into @xmath17 such that @xmath68 and @xmath69 is real . with this normalization ,",
    "the conformal map is unique . by symmetry of the domain @xmath17 under complex conjugation , and uniqueness of the conformal map",
    ", @xmath18 is real , i.e. , @xmath70 .",
    "let @xmath71 be the schwarz function of the boundary @xmath48 .",
    "following @xcite , we consider the pullback of ( [ eq : schwarz ] ) under the conformal map @xmath18 . using the relation @xmath72 we have @xmath73    setting @xmath74 then obviously @xmath75 . using",
    "this fact , we can use ( [ eq : pullback ] ) to analytically continue @xmath76 to the entire plane as a meromorphic ( and in fact rational ) function .",
    "namely , we prove the following :    [ lem:1 ] the function @xmath77 is a rational function of degree exactly @xmath78 and takes the form : @xmath79 with @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath80 real constants and @xmath81 .",
    "the points @xmath82 are the preimages of @xmath83 under @xmath18 . from ( [ eq : pullback ] )",
    "@xmath77 has a pole of order two at @xmath84 and no other poles in @xmath19 . since @xmath85 , @xmath77 has also poles of order two at @xmath86 .",
    "there are no other poles in @xmath87 , since otherwise we would have a contradiction to ( [ eq : schwarz ] ) .",
    "thus , @xmath77 is a meromorphic function in the entire plane with exactly four poles of order two . if @xmath88 , then the conformal map @xmath89 as @xmath90 , and that would imply that the schwarz function has a pole at the origin , which contradicts ( [ eq : schwarz ] ) .",
    "this implies @xmath77 is a rational function of degree exactly @xmath78 .",
    "having determined the location of the poles , we have @xmath91 where @xmath92 is a polynomial of degree @xmath78 . from ( [ eq2 ] )",
    "we see that @xmath93 and the zeros have order two .",
    "hence @xmath77 has additional four zeros .",
    "so suppose @xmath94 is a zero of @xmath77 , then @xmath95 since @xmath96 .",
    "note that @xmath97 , which follows from the symmetry of @xmath17 with respect to the real and imaginary axes , hence @xmath98 is a zero of @xmath77 , and by ( [ eq2 ] ) @xmath77 vanishes @xmath99 .",
    "thus @xmath100    now set @xmath101 and @xmath102 for some positive @xmath29 , then    @xmath103    since @xmath104 , @xmath77 is non  negative on the real axis .",
    "hence the above expression is real , and therefore @xmath105 which results in the identity @xmath106 thus either @xmath107 or @xmath108 or @xmath109 .",
    "note that @xmath107 is impossible since then @xmath110 would have branch points on the unit circle and consequently @xmath18 is not single valued . if @xmath111 , then @xmath112 is negative for some @xmath113 when @xmath114 .",
    "hence @xmath109 and then @xmath115 thus @xmath116 , and we have @xmath117 and we have obtained ( [ eq : lemma ] ) .    applying the lemma [ lem:1 ] , and taking the square root in equation ( [ eq2 ] ) we have : @xmath118 where @xmath119 . multiplying by @xmath120 and integrating with respect to @xmath121 along the contour @xmath122 , we obtain @xmath123 the term @xmath124 integrates to zero since it is analytic in @xmath87 and @xmath125 since @xmath126 is analytic in @xmath19 , we may apply the cauchy integral formula : @xmath127 thus we have : @xmath128 and this completes the proof of theorem [ thm : neumannovaloid ] .",
    "notice that the quadrature domain depends on only two parameters , @xmath11 and @xmath14 , while the conformal map @xmath18 appears to depend on three real parameters , @xmath129 , @xmath130 , and @xmath131 .",
    "however , fixing @xmath132 , the value of @xmath29 is determined by the value of @xmath30 . in this section ,",
    "we fix @xmath31 , which gives that @xmath18 is the identity map when @xmath133 .",
    "we will show how parameters @xmath29 and @xmath30 are related and also show that as @xmath29 and @xmath30 tend to zero , we recover the quadrature formula for the unit ball .",
    "notice that equation ( [ eq : schwarz ] ) provides a constraint relating @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "namely , we observe that the residue of @xmath134 at @xmath135 vanishes , which is equivalent to @xmath136 .",
    "since the pole is of order two , we have : @xmath137 setting @xmath138 then by the formula of @xmath139 ( [ eq : conf ] ) , @xmath140\\sqrt{g(w ) } dw \\\\ & = : f(a , b ) .",
    "\\end{split}\\ ] ] thus we conclude that the rotation of the domain @xmath17 generates the neumann ovaloid ( [ eq : qf ] ) if and only if @xmath141 for some positive @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "we shall use the implicit function theorem in order to justify that identity ( [ eq : res:2 ] ) determines the parameter @xmath29 as a function of @xmath30 .    to this end , the expressions @xmath142 and @xmath143 can be computed using symbolic computation software : @xmath144    @xmath145    it follows from the above computations the functional @xmath146 is not continuous when @xmath147 .",

    "moreover , we see from ( [ eq : com:3 ] ) that @xmath168 .",
    "hence the functional @xmath146 , which is defined by ( [ eq : res:2 ] ) , vanishes near the origin on a curve , in which @xmath169 , or more precisely @xmath170    the coefficient @xmath14 of the quadrature identity ( [ eq : qf ] ) can be computed as follows . when @xmath141 , then ( [ eq : schwarz ] ) holds and therefore by ( [ eq : pullback ] ) @xmath171 writing @xmath172 , where @xmath173 , then by lemma [ lem:1 ] , @xmath174 the estimate ( [ eq : asym ] ) enables us to examine the asymptotic behavior as @xmath175 goes to zero .",
    "we see that @xmath176 and since when @xmath177 , the conformal mapping @xmath18 tends to the identity , we conclude that @xmath178 . on the other hand , letting @xmath11 tend to zero in ( [ eq : qf ] ) , then the right hand side goes to @xmath179 , and the domain @xmath2 tends to the unit ball .",
    "hence the limit coincides with the mean value property of harmonic functions .",
    "numerical implementation of theorem [ thm : neumannovaloid ] requires determining appropriate choices of parameters .",
    "the parameter @xmath27 simply scales the domain , so that there is only a one - parameter family of different shapes . while varying the choice of @xmath30 , we choose @xmath29 to satisfy the relation ( [ eq : res:1 ] )",
    "this is done numerically using matlab .",
    "we then use the condition @xmath180 ( where @xmath27 appears as a scalar ) in order to choose @xmath27 so that @xmath181 .",
    "this leads to a one - parameter family of different shapes having the same `` foci '' @xmath182 .",
    "we note that this family can also be interpreted as a four - dimensional hele - shaw flow with two point sources ( located at the foci ) .",
    "we used matlab to perform numerical integration of the cauchy transform appearing in ( [ eq : conf ] ) .",
    "this requires some care in checking that the branch of the square root is defined appropriately .",
    "the radius of the contour of integration should also be increased slightly ( without crossing any singularities of the integrand ) ; this is a convenient way to avoid numerically integrating through the simple pole presented by the fact that @xmath183 is on the unit circle .",
