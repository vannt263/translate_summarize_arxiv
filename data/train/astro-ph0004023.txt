    "recent years have seen dramatic increases in the size of the largest cosmological n - body simulations , with giga - particle runs now able to track the non - linear gravitational evolution of a significant fraction of the observable universe ( colberg et al .",
    "correspondingly , it is becoming possible to make more and more detailed predictions for the non - linear properties of dark matter in any cosmological model , with convergent results being obtained for such features as the profiles and correlation functions of dark matter halos ( moore et al .",
    "1999 ) . in spite of these advances ,",
    "the one great challenge remaining for the simulators is to realistically track the evolution of cosmic gas through its complex cycles of star - formation and feedback .",
    "given the current state of the art for cosmological simulations , rich clusters of galaxies provide one of the most powerful tools with which to make detailed tests of cosmology .",
    "firstly , cluster potential wells are so deep that their formation and evolution is largely unaffected by the uncertain history of the cosmic gas , making dissipationless n - body simulations an ideal place in which to study their properties .",
    "second , clusters correspond to rare peaks in the primordial density field , so their statistics are extremely sensitive to detailed features of the cosmology .    in this paper , i will show that a simple model proposed by sheth , mo & tormen ( 1999 ) can give an extremely good fit to the correlation function of massive halos observed in recent state of the art numerical simulations . using this model",
    "i will compare the predictions of a range of cosmological models with observations of the cluster correlation length .",
    "in particular , i will show that correlation length observations place strong constraints on the power spectrum of mass fluctuations in the universe , constraints that are almost independent of other cosmological parameters . in section  [ sec - model ]",
    "i describe the sheth , mo & tormen model for the cluster correlation length , together with a similar semi - analytic model due to mo & white ( 1996 ) , and other bias models discussed in the literature . in section  [ sec - simulations",
    "] i compare the predictions of these models with recent numerical simulations , and in section  [ sec - data ] i show the constraints which can be derived when the models are compared with observations . in section  [ sec - conclusions ]",
    "i discuss the relationship of this work to previous studies , and draw my conclusions .",
    "i describe four semi - analytic models which make predictions for the amplitude of halo correlations , one due to mo & white ( 1996  hereafter mw ) , one due to sheth , mo & tormen ( 1999  hereafter smt ) , one due to sheth and tormen ( 1999  hereafter st ) , and one based on a model by lee & shandarin ( 1998  hereafter ls ) and extended in st .",
    "the input parameters for these models are the power spectrum of matter fluctuations @xmath0 ( extrapolated using linear gravity to today ) and the background cosmology of the universe ( specified here in terms of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , the contributions of matter and a cosmological constant to the critical density today ) .",
    "i will compare the predictions of these models with observations of the halo correlation length @xmath3 , defined such that @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the halo correlation function . also , @xmath6 is the mean halo separation for the halo sample in question , and the sample is chosen to contain only those halos with `` richness '' greater than some value . in this context",
    "i use `` richness '' ( @xmath7 ) to denote any parameter which correlates with halo mass ( typical examples for clusters are galaxy number counts and x - ray luminosity ) .",
    "i will assume that the parameter @xmath8 can be monotonically transformed into an `` inferred mass '' @xmath9 which is correlated with the true mass with known conditional probability @xmath10 .    for each model",
    ", the procedure for computing the correlation length for a sample of halos with mean separation @xmath6 is as follows .    * first , compute the inferred mass threshold @xmath11 , such that the mean separation of halos with inferred mass greater than @xmath11 is equal to @xmath6 .",
    "that is , find @xmath11 satisfying @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the number density of halos with inferred ( as denoted by the superscript i ) mass greater than @xmath11 for model x , and x denotes the semi - analytic formalism being used ( either mw , smt , st or ls ) .",

    ", we also compute @xmath49 using the linear correlation function , that is we solve for @xmath49 satisfying @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the fourier transform of the linear power spectrum @xmath0 . as we will see in section  [ sec - simulations ] , use of the non - linear correlation function gives a better fit for all the models .",

    "( 1997 - hereafter c97 ) and lee & park ( 1998 - hereafter lp98 ) .",
    "although this is only a small fraction of currently available data on the cluster correlation length , it suffices to illustrate the wide degree of systematic uncertainty which exists in present observations  even two analyses of the same dataset give results that differ by considerable factors , and the situation is even less clear when results from abell ( see for instance bahcall & cen 1992 ) and x - ray ( see lp99 for a detailed discussion ) cluster samples are included .",
    "although present day uncertainties are large , errors in @xmath49 will be greatly reduced by future surveys . the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ,",
    "see project book at http://www.astro.princeton.edu/pbook/welcome.htm for detailed specifications ) is expected to identify roughly 1000 nearby clusters in its spectroscopic galaxy redshift survey , and even more in its photometric survey",
    ". the inclusion of redshift information in the cluster identification procedure will greatly reduce systematic uncertainties in @xmath49 , and statistical uncertainties will be reduced by approximately 50 per cent by the increased sample size . in order to illustrate the type of results we can hope for , i will carry out the bulk of my analysis using just the c97 data .",
    "this data is at least self - consistent , and 2@xmath75 confidence limits for the sdss survey should be similar in size to 1@xmath75 confidence limits from the c97 analysis .",
    "i compute confidence limits for various models as follows : each model gives a specific prediction for the for the @xmath64 relation , given which the likelihood of observing a particular dataset is ( up to a constant of proportionality ) @xmath76 where @xmath77 here the sum @xmath69 runs over all datapoints ( @xmath78,@xmath71 ) with standard deviation @xmath79 , @xmath67 is the fractional uncertainty in the predictions of the model ( which following the discussion in section  [ sec - simulations ] is taken to be @xmath73 ) and the term @xmath80 is added in quadrature to the denominator to account for systematic uncertainties in the model .",
    "given a set of model parameters and prior distributions for those parameters , i calculate @xmath81 and @xmath82 confidence limits by computing the likelihood threshold above which the integrated likelihood accounts for 69 and 95 per cent respectively of the total probability .",
    "finally , all model predictions are computed at the median redshift of each sample , which i take to be @xmath83 , although the precise value used has little effect on the results .",
    "[ fig - square ] shows confidence limits in the @xmath84 plane derived from the observations shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - data ] . given values for @xmath60 and @xmath56",
    ", each model is fully specified once we know @xmath1 and the conditional probability distribution relating the `` inferred '' mass for the cluster observations in question to the true cluster mass .",
    "the shaded area labeled `` croft '' shows 1@xmath75 ( dark region ) and 2@xmath75 ( light region ) confidence limits derived using the smt model and the c97 data , in an @xmath85 background cosmology with zero scatter between inferred and true cluster mass ( use of an open @xmath86 cosmology makes virtually no difference to the results ) .",
    "four other confidence regions are also shown in this figure , each one the result of changing one aspect of the first analysis .",
    "first , the shaded area labeled `` mw '' gives the @xmath81 confidence region which results from using the mw model rather than the smt model .",
    "the limits in this case are quite different , and given the poor performance of the mw model when compared to simulations , should be disregarded .",
    "second , the shaded region labeled `` lee '' shows the 1@xmath75 limits resulting from using the lp99 data ( with its higher values for @xmath49 ) rather than the c98 data .",
    "the lp99 data favours dramatically lower values of @xmath56 for a given value of @xmath60 , and since the majority of alternative datasets ( see lp99 for a detailed discussion ) also prefer higher values of @xmath49 , the high @xmath56 region to the right of the `` croft '' confidence limits is likely to be excluded by all current observations .",
    "thirdly , the long - dash lines delineate the 1@xmath75 confidence region resulting from an analysis identical to the `` croft '' analysis except for the choice of a flat @xmath87 cosmology . increasing @xmath88 slightly increases the amplification of clustering by redshift space distortion , and slightly reduces the growth factor at the median redshift of the sample .",
    "both of these effects are small , and the resulting confidence region is very similar to the @xmath81 limits resulting from the @xmath86 analysis .",
    "lastly , the short dashed lines delineate 1@xmath75 confidence regions obtained when a significant scatter is introduced between the inferred and true cluster masses . in particular , @xmath10 is modeled as a log - normal distribution with a natural logarithmic standard deviation @xmath89 .",
    "this value of @xmath75 corresponds to roughly a 50 per cent scatter in the inferred mass for a given true mass .",
    "even for such a large scatter , the 1@xmath75 confidence region is virtually unchanged , demonstrating that robust constraints can be obtained even if clusters of a given mass have a wide distribution of `` richness '' values - the only requirement is that there is some monotonic transformation which loosely correlates the richness ( for instance , x - ray luminosity or galaxy counts ) with the true mass .",
    "[ fig - square ] demonstrates that observations of the cluster correlation length place constraints on the amplitude & shape of the matter power spectrum in the universe which are almost independent of cosmology .",
    "as one final point , i illustrate the type of cosmological constraints which can be obtained when these limits are combined with independent observations of the mass power spectrum .",
    "[ fig - square_omega ] shows confidence limits in the @xmath90 plane from a combination of cluster correlation length data and cluster number abundance data .",
    "the dark and light hashed regions show 1@xmath75 and 2@xmath75 confidence bands derived from the local cluster temperature function by eke , cole & frenk ( ecf - 1996 ) .",
    "the other confidence bands show 1@xmath75 and 2@xmath75 limits derived from the c97 data , under three different assumptions about the value of @xmath56 should greatly be greatly reduced by future surveys such as sdss , allowing us to place tight constraints on @xmath91 using the techniques described here . ] .",
    "the solid lines show constraints for the case of a cdm cosmology with @xmath92 with @xmath93 , and @xmath94 ( for conciseness , this region is simply labeled by `` @xmath95 '' ) .",
    "increases ( decreases ) in the value of @xmath58 just shift the confidence region to lower ( higher ) values of @xmath1 by the same factor .",
    "the shaded bands show confidence limits for the choices @xmath96 ( which provides a good fit to the power spectrum of apm galaxies - see viana & liddle 1996 ) and @xmath97 . for @xmath97",
    "the combined ecf and c97 constraints are consistent with the case @xmath87 , while the other choices for @xmath56 each require @xmath98 for consistency between the datasets at the 2@xmath75 level .",
    "if the lp99 data was used instead of c97 , even lower values of @xmath1 would be preferred .",
    "i have shown that the halo correlation length measured in recent numerical simulations can be well fit ( to better than 8 per cent accuracy ) by a semi - analytic model based on the collapse of ellipsoidal perturbations due to sheth , mo & tormen ( 1999 ) .",
    "a similar analytic model due to mo & white ( 1996 ) on the other hand gives a poorer fit to the simulations ( roughly 25 per cent accuracy ) . applying the smt",
    "result to present data , i have shown that correlation length observations place strong , almost cosmology independent constraints on the shape and amplitude of the matter power spectrum in the universe . by far",
    "the greatest source of uncertainty is systematic discrepancies between current datasets , but if the cluster correlation length is at least as high as is implied by the apm survey , then an interesting region of power spectrum parameter space ( everything to the right of the `` croft '' region in fig .",
    "[ fig - square ] ) can be excluded .",
    "future surveys , including the sloan digital sky survey , should greatly reduce the observational uncertainties , with 2@xmath75 confidence limits from sdss being as tight as the 1@xmath75 limits shown for the c97 data in fig .",
    "[ fig - square ] .",
    "one particularly interesting result is that the analysis is almost unaffected when a significant scatter ( up to 50 per cent ) is introduced between true cluster mass and the richness property by which clusters are ranked .",
    "such a scatter is inevitable in any cluster survey , so it is extremely useful to know that even an effect this large does not influence the results .",
    "finally , i have shown how the correlation length can be combined with other cluster observations to place limits on the matter density of the universe .",
    "a number of previous studies have discussed constraints from the cluster correlation length .",
    "bahcall & cen ( 1992 ) and croft & efstathiou ( 1994 ) carried out numerical simulations showing that cluster correlation length was a strong discriminator amoung models , and obtained results which are consistent with those discussed in this paper .",
    "mo , jing & white ( 1996 ) and later robinson , gawiser & silk ( 1998 ) made use of the mw formalism to compare models and observations for a wider range of parameters , and owing to the inaccuracy of the mw model , their results are not consistent with those found here ( the inconsistency of the mw model is actually larger than is apparent in mjw due to an error in fig .",
    "8 of that paper ) .",
    "the work described here improves on previous studies by utilizing a formula which accurately fits the most recent numerical simulations , and which can be used to compute predictions for a large range of model parameters very quickly .",
    "lastly , it should be noted that the analysis discussed here assumes that the primordial fluctuations in the universe are gaussian .",
    "non - gaussianity also influences the value of the cluster correlation length , and a number of authors , including robinson , gawiser & silk ( 1998 ) and koyama , soda & taruya ( 1999 ) have attempted to exploit this fact to use cluster observations to place constraints on primordial non - gaussianity .",
    "both these works have modeled the correlation function for non - gaussian models using an extension of the mw formalism , and therefore their conclusions should be modified in the light the results discussed here , which show that mw does not accurately predict the halo correlation function even for gaussian models .    to summarize , cluster correlation length observations place strong cosmology independent constraints on the matter power spectrum in the universe , constraints which future surveys such as sdss will allow us to fully exploit .",

    "i would also like to thank fabio governato and h.  j.  mo for their swift answers to my questions , and pedro ferreira for reading a draft of the manuscript .",
