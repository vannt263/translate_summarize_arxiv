    "today , thanks to the optomechanical cavities equipped with ultracold atoms , a suitable basement have been provided to study atom - photon interaction in the regime where their quantum mechanical properties are manifested in the same level @xcite . besides , the hybrid systems consisting of bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) trapped inside the optical lattice of a cavity exhibit optomechanical properties @xcite .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that if the laser pump which drives the cavity containing a bec is far detuned from the atomic resonance , the excited electronic state of the atoms can be adiabatically eliminated and consequently the only degrees of freedom of atoms will be their mechanical motions .",
    "in a situation where only the lowest modes of the matter field are excited ( the condensate mode is considered as a classical mean field and the first excited quantum mode is called the bogoliubov mode ) , the bec behaves just like a single - mode quantum oscillator which is coupled to the radiation pressure of the cavity @xcite .",
    "the bogoliubov mode of the bec acts effectively as a secondary mechanical mode in the cavities having a moving end mirror @xcite or behaves as one of the several membranes inside a cavity which interact with the optical field @xcite .",
    "the other interesting feature of such hybrid systems containing the bec , is the nonlinear effect of the atom - atom interaction which can affect optomechanical properties of the system @xcite .",
    "it may lead to the squeezing of the bogoliubov mode @xcite and change the pattern of normal modes of the cavity output optical field @xcite . besides , it can change the threshold of the quantum phase transition of the bec @xcite . on the other hand , for an interacting bec",
    "the frequency of the bogoliubov mode is a function of the _ s_-wave scattering frequency ( @xmath0 ) of the nonlinear atom - atom interaction @xcite .",
    "since @xmath0 can be manipulated by the transverse trapping frequency of the bec @xcite , the frequency of the bogoliubov mode is a controllable parameter .",
    "it is one of the advantages of the hybrid system with respect to the bare one in which the frequency of the mechanical mode of the moving mirror is a fixed parameter .",
    "in this paper we study the interaction of a bec trapped inside an optomechanical cavity with a moving end mirror in the dispersive regime where the effective frequency of the optical mode is much greater than those of the mechanical and the bogoliubov modes .",
    "besides , we consider the situation where the damping rate of the cavity is faster than those of the other modes so that the optical field follows the dynamics of the mechanical and atomic oscillators adiabatically . in this way",
    ", the three - mode system behaves as an effective two - mode one so that the two modes interact with each other through the mediation of the optical field .",
    "here , we also consider the effect of the atom - atom interaction as well as the classical noise of the external laser which pumps the cavity . the laser phase noise ( lpn )",
    "have been known as one of the possible technical limitations in realized setups which may affect the cooling and the coherent dynamics in optomechanical systems @xcite .",
    "we derive an effective hamiltonian in the adiabatic approximation and show explicitly that the lpn acts as a classical stochastic driving term which pumps the amplitude quadratures of both the mechanical and the bogoliubov modes .",
    "we also show how the quantum noise of the optical field affects the brownian noises of these modes .",
    "this is one of the main results of the present work .",
    "furthermore , we show that at very low temperature where the environmental thermal noises are negligible , the destructive effect of lpn on the stationary bipartite entanglements of the system is more considerable , especially when the linewidth of the pump laser is not low enough .    on the other hand , due to the indirect interaction of the atomic and the mechanical modes , establishing a strong stationary entanglement between them",
    "is very challenging @xcite . nevertheless , production of the atom - field and mirror - field entanglement is straightforward since the atomic and the mechanical modes interact directly with the optical field @xcite .",
    "as has been shown in ref.@xcite , the atom - mirror entanglement is nonzero only within a very short time window and goes to zero in the steady state when the cavity is pumped by an unmodulated laser .",
    "however , we show that a strong stationary mirror - atom entanglement can be established by a cw pump laser if the system works in the dispersive regime where the resonance condition between the mechanical and the bogoliubov modes is fulfilled .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in sec .",

    "iii we describe the classical model of the phase noise and in sec .",
    "iv the quantum langevin equations ( qles ) are derived and linearized around the semiclassical steady state . in sec .",
    "v we derive the effective two mode model of the system by adiabaticaly eliminating the optical field . in sec .",
    "vi the effects of the lpn and the atom - atom interaction on the stationary bipartite entanglements are studied .",

    "where the laser pump is far detuned from the atomic resonance ( @xmath13 exceeds the atomic linewidth @xmath14 by orders of magnitude ) , the excited electronic state of the atoms can be adiabatically eliminated and spontaneous emission can be neglected @xcite . in this way",

    "therefore , for pump lasers with linewidths @xmath227khz the laser phase noise is so low that can not affect the stationary entanglements of the system .",
    "however , for pump lasers with larger linewidth the effect of lpn is no longer negligible . in figs.[fig : fig5 ] ( b ) and ( c ) the values of the laser linewidth have been fixed at @xmath216khz and @xmath217khz , respectively . as is seen , for these larger values of the laser linewidth , not only the the maxima of all the bipartite entanglements reduce but also the range of the detuning in which the entanglements have nonzero values gets much narrower .    , and ( c ) the normalized effective frequencies of the mechanical ( @xmath169 , solid lines ) and the bogoliubov ( @xmath170 , dashed lines ) modes versus the normalized detuninng @xmath228 for three different values of @xmath229 ( red line ) , @xmath230 ( green line ) and @xmath231 ( blue line ) .",

    "the absolute values of them are increased by increasing @xmath155 .",
    "since these phase noise coupling parameters are independent of the laser linewidth ( @xmath59 ) , the phase noise is injected into the system by the same rate for lasers having different linewidths . however , since the quantum correlations are affected by the laser linewidth , the entanglement is reduced for larger values of the laser linewidth .",
    "in other words , by increasing the input power of the pump laser , the noise is injected into the system with faster rate . however",
    ", this noise can not affect the stationary m - a entanglement as far as the laser linewidth is very low . instead , for higher values of the laser linewidth , the destructive effect of the phase noise dominates and makes the entanglement decrease by increasing the power of the pump laser .",
    "in order to see the effect of the atom - atom interaction on the m - a entanglement , in fig.[fig : fig7](a ) we have plotted the m - a entanglement versus the normalized cavity - pump detuning @xmath202 for three different values of the _ s_-wave scattering frequencies @xmath229 ( red line ) , @xmath230 ( green line ) and @xmath231 ( blue line ) . as is seen , the m - a entanglement is reduced by increasing the _",
    "s_-wave scattering frequency .",
    "to understand why this phenomenon is happening , we have plotted the normalized effective coupling parameter @xmath171 [ fig.[fig : fig7 ] ( b ) ] and the normalized effective frequencies of the mechanical mode ( @xmath169 , solid lines ) and of the bogoliubov mode ( @xmath170 , dashed lines ) versus the normalized detuninng @xmath228 [ fig.[fig : fig7 ] ( c ) ] .",
    "based on these numerical results , increasing the _ s_-wave scattering frequency from one hand causes the effective coupling parameter @xmath144 to be increased a little bit [ fig.[fig : fig7](b ) ] and from the other hand , causes the effective frequencies of the two modes ( @xmath235 and @xmath236 ) to get far away from each other [ fig.[fig : fig7](c ) ] .",
    "as is seen , the m - a entanglement occurs in the region where the two oscillators are nearly at resonance ( where @xmath237 ) as far as the effective coupling parameter is nonzero . for larger negative values of @xmath223",
    "the two modes will be at resonance but the entanglement vanished since the effective coupling parameter tends to zero .",
    "therefore , the atom - atom interaction has a dual effect : firstly , it strengthens the effective coupling parameter between the two modes that should lead to an increase of the entanglement and secondly , it makes the two modes get out of resonance . since the latter effect dominates the former , the ultimate effect of the atom - atom interaction appears as a reduction of the entanglement .",
    "this effect is more considerable for @xmath238 . besides , the increase in the effective coupling parameter due to the atom - atom interaction is more considerable for larger values of @xmath223 where the system gets near to the bisatbility region and the entanglement tends to zero .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied a driven optomechanical cavity with a moving end mirror containing a cigar shaped bec . since in any realistic setup the external laser that pumps the cavity has a nonzero linewidth because of its phase fluctuations , we have taken into account the effect of this classical phase noise in our model . in the weakly interacting regime , where just the first two symmetric momentum side modes are excited by fluctuations resulting from the atom - light interaction ,",
    "the bec can be considered as a one mode oscillator in the bogoliubov approximation . in this way",
    ", the bogoliubov mode of the bec is coupled to the optical field through a radiation pressure term which behaves as a secondary mechanical mode relative to the vibrational mode of the mirror .",
    "we have investigated the behavior of the system in the dispersive regime where the effective frequency of the optical mode is much greater than those of the mechanical and the bogoliubov modes .",
    "besides , we consider the situation where the damping rate of the cavity is faster than those of the other modes so that the optical field follows the dynamics of the mechanical and atomic oscillators adiabatically . in this way",
    ", an effective two - mode hamiltonian is derived in the adiabatic approximation where the bogoliubov and mechanical modes are coupled to each other through the mediation of the optical field by an effective coupling parameter .",
    "it was shown that the lpn in the effective two - mode model appears as a classical stochastic pump term which drives the amplitude quadratures of both the mechanical and the bogoliubov modes .",
    "we have also shown that a strong stationary m - a entanglement can be established just in the dispersive and doppler regimes where the two modes come into resonance with each other and the effect of laser phase noise gets very low . meanwhile",
    ", we have shown that although the nonlinear effect of atom - atom interaction increases the effective coupling parameter between the two modes , it leads to a reduction in the m - a entanglement because it makes the two modes get out of resonance .",
