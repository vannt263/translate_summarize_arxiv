    "direct detection is a crucial next step in our understanding of extrasolar planets .",
    "although the radial velocity technique continues to generate valuable discoveries ( marcy & butler 2000 ) , the composition , origins , and essential natures of exoplanets will likely remain hidden unless we can study them directly .    to date , we know of over 100 exoplanets , all with semimajor axes @xmath1 6 au . using the radial velocity technique , detection of exoplanets with orbital radii similar to those of saturn , uranus , and",
    "neptune would require timelines on the order of decades . however , the existence of these outer planets , theories of planetary dynamics ( e.g. rasio & ford , 1996 ) , and the shaping of dusty debris disks ( holland et al 1998 ; greaves et al . 1998 ; liou & zook 1999 , ozernoy et al .",
    "2000 ) all lend credence to the idea of planets with semimajor axes of tens to hundreds of au .",
    "the primary requisites of a workable strategy for detection of extrasolar planets are high - contrast imaging and subarcsecond resolution .",
    "these capabilities are available via the use of ground - based adaptive optics ( ao ) systems or direct imaging from space .",
    "a choice of ao in turn mandates the use of large telescopes , since the time required to achieve a given s / n ratio varies as the inverse fourth power of mirror diameter ( olivier et al . 1997 ) .",
    "yet even with keck ao , planets with semi - major axes of order tens of au can be spatially resolved only around stars within @xmath2 60 pc of earth .",
    "current ao sensitivities also rule out the detection of solar - age planets in reflected light , however , young ( @xmath1 60 myr ) , warm planets may be seen via their near - infrared emission .",
    "selection of young targets is effected chiefly through the study of galactic space motions ( u , v , w ) in conjunction with excess emissions of stars .",
    "these may appear as x - rays , h@xmath3 and ca ii h & k emission , or far - infrared excesses ( e.g. spangler et al . 2001 ) .",
    "lithium absorption may also be an important youth indicator .",
    "techniques for identifying young stars are further described in zuckerman et al .",
    "( 2001 ) .",
    "once targets have been identified and observed , registration of long - exposure images and a process called unsharp - masking increase our sensitivity to point sources . unsharp - masking is a process in which a smoothed version of an image is subtracted from the original so as to improve the contrast between the background noise and small - scale structure .",
    "as can be seen in the next section , unsharp - masking improves our sensitivity to point sources by as much as two magnitudes within 2  of a target star .",
    "our study utilizes the ao system on keck ii ( wizinowich et al .",
    "2000 ) . over the past two years",
    ", we have observed @xmath2 100 nearby , young stars using kcam , nirspec s slit - view camera ( scam ) , and most recently nirc2 , the first camera optimized for keck",
    "we estimate that more than half of our target stars are @xmath1 100 myr old .",
    "figure 1 shows sensitivity calculations for representative targets from the scam and nirc2 datasets .",
    "as expected , sensitivity improves both for nirc2 data and for images which have been unsharp - masked .",

    "our sensitivity to planets of a given mass varies with such factors as age , distance , and magnitude of the host star , as well as conditions under which the data were taken .",
