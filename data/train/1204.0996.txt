    "unitary operations have been placed in a very important position in the quantum communication and entanglement manipulating , such as , quantum cryptography@xcite , teleportation@xcite , entanglement swapping@xcite , quantum states purification[4 ] , entanglement production@xcite and so on . in quantum teleportation , to transfer the unknown quantum state to the remote user , the sender must apply an joint unitary operator on the unknown state particle and one of the entangled particles . in quantum entanglement swapping , a joint unitary transformation on two particles(they",
    "are from two different entangled pairs ) will let two remote particles entangled without direct interaction . in entanglement purification process , joint unitary operations and measurements can transfer the entanglement from many partially entangled pairs to few near perfect entangled pairs . in entanglement generation , the joint unitary operations and single qubit operations can let the initially product particles entangled . from the above applications we can see that , it is the nonlocal attribute of the bipartite joint unitary transformation that plays the most important role .",
    "the nonlocal attribute of a bipartite joint unitary operator has been studied from different aspects , such as entangling power@xcite , operator entanglement@xcite , and entanglement - changing power@xcite .",
    "entangling power is the mean entanglement(linear entropy ) produced by acting with u on a given distribution of pure product states@xcite . because a quantum operator belongs to a hilbert - schmidt space",
    ", one can consider the entanglement of the operator itself , which is named as operator entanglement@xcite .",
    "it is a natural extension of the entanglement measures of quantum states@xcite to the level of general quantum evolutions . up to now",
    ", several methods have been proposed to quantify the entanglement of an unitary bipartite operator , such as linear entropy@xcite , von neumann entropy@xcite , concurrence@xcite and schmidt strength@xcite etc .",
    "the relations between the entangling power and these operator entanglement measures have also been discussed recently@xcite .",
    "in general , the entangling power of an unitary operator is related to those operator entanglement measures in complicated or indirect ways , so does the relation between the different operator entanglement measures .",
    "clarifying the exact relation between the entangling power and different operator entanglement measures , and the relation between different operator entanglement measures will be very helpful for us to understand the nonlocal attributes and entanglement capacity of a joint unitary operator .",
    "after getting the whole nonlocal features of joint unitary operators , we can choose the optimal unitary operator to produce the specific entangled state as we want it to be , and the quantum communication protocols(such as teleportation , entanglement swapping etc ) can be realized in an optimal way by introducing the appropriate joint operations@xcite . for two - qubit unitary operators ,",
    "the two operator entanglement measures schmidt strength and linear entropy are shown to have a one - to - one relation between them for the schmidt number @xmath0 case , but no such relation exists for the schmidt number @xmath1 case@xcite .",
    "this result also shows that , the schmidt number is a very important parameter of an unitary operator when the entangling power and operator entanglement of it is concerned . in this paper",
    ", we are going to study the operator entanglement of joint two - qubit unitary operators with different schmidt numbers . in this paper",
    ", we use the linear entropy as the entanglement measure of joint two - qubit unitary operator@xcite , and study the schmidt number and the entanglement measure of any unitary operator in four - dimensional hilbert - schmidt space .",
    "the schmidt number of two - qubit unitary operators has the following three possible situations : @xmath2 , @xmath0 or @xmath1@xcite .",
    "we will show that the entanglement measure of two - qubit unitary operators is classified by the schmidt number of the unitary operator . in the light of the numerical analysis",
    ", we can get the extreme value of the operator entanglement for the two - qubit unitary operators .",
    "further , the relation between the operator entanglement and the parameters of the unitary operator will be clarified here .",
    "there exist local unitary operators @xmath3,@xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and a two - qubit unitary operator @xmath7 , so that arbitrary two - qubit unitary operator @xmath8 can be canonically decomposed as@xcite : @xmath9 where @xmath10 $ ] , and @xmath11 is a diagonal matrix . in the light of this theory ,",
    "any bipartite unitary operator can be decomposed as the form above .",
    "moreover , the entanglement measure of a unitary operator s must be invariant under the local unitary transformations@xcite .",
    "so , the entanglement measure of any bipartite unitary operator can be simplified into the entanglement measure of operator @xmath7 . in the standard computational basis , we have@xcite : @xmath12 where @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and one can always restrict oneself to the region @xmath15 , which is the so - called weyl chamber@xcite .",
    "any operator @xmath16 acting on the systems @xmath17 and @xmath18 can be written in the operator - schmidt decomposition@xcite : @xmath19 where @xmath20 are the schmidt coefficients with the positive value and @xmath21 , @xmath22 are orthonormal operator bases for @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively . to calculate the operator entanglement of the unitary operator @xmath8",
    ", we only need to make the schmidt decomposition of the unitary operator @xmath23 . from the ref.@xcite , entanglement measure of a unitary operator",

    "the entanglement measure of the unitary operator with schmidt number @xmath0 can get to the extreme value @xmath50 .",
    "entanglement measure of unitary operator @xmath7 versus the parameters @xmath33 , @xmath34 for parameter @xmath51 when the schmidt number is @xmath0 . ]    from the two figures we can see that , if we want to design an operation so that it has a specific operator entanglement(or entangling power ) , we have infinite design schemes(i.e .",
    "@xmath52 ) for the schmidt - number-@xmath1 type operations .",
    "but we only have two design schemes for the schmidt - number-@xmath0 type operations .",
    "that is to say , schmidt - number-@xmath1 type operations have a variety of design schemes rather than the only two design schemes of the schmidt - number-@xmath0 type operations .",
