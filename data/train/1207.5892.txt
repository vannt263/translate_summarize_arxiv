    "the significance of zero - energy excitations in quantum field theories of both elementary and quasiparticles has substantially increased since majorana predicted the appearance of a massless particle , which acts as its own anti - particle @xcite .",

    "in such quantum information processing protocols quantized vortices of non - abelian character could be moved adiabatically @xcite to achieve braiding of topological charges .",
    "this could be facilitated by majorana quasiparticle zero modes , which are predicted to appear trapped inside vortex cores in chiral p - wave paired superconductors and protected by coupling to edge modes @xcite .",

    "goldstone theorem predicts the emergence of a zero energy ( quasi)particle corresponding to every continuous symmetry of the hamiltonian absent in the ground state of the system @xcite , and such symmetry absentees are therefore said to be spontaneously broken .",
    "however a direct application of this principle to non - relativistic systems can lead to seeming contradictions .",
    "there remains some confusion in particular regarding the number of zero modes that should be observed in such systems .",
    "for example , it may come as a surprise that for atoms in a crystal lattice , a state which clearly breaks six continuous symmetries ( three translational plus three rotational ) , there only exists three ( two transverse and one longitudinal ) gapless phonon modes .",
    "it has been suggested that the nambu ",
    "goldstone modes associated with the rotational symmetry breakings are absent in atomic crystals because of the linear relationship between noether charge densities for translation and rotation , making the rotational zero modes redundant @xcite",
    ".    similar situation prevails in the harmonically trapped rotating bose  einstein condensates .",
    "it is well known that due to the process of bose ",
    "einstein condensation the condensate ground state establishes a spatial phase coherence .",

    "when such condensate is rotated the ground state changes its topology by nucleating a quantized vortex crystal lattice .",
    "similarly to atoms in solids , such vortex lattice breaks six additional continuous symmetries but experiments have not detected any emergent zero modes associated with the formation of the vortex lattice . a solution to this puzzling feature",
    "is suggested in @xcite by noting that already the nonrotating condensate ground state breaks galilean invariance and therefore the six additional symmetries broken by the vortex crystal are redundant and already catered for by the zero mode associated with the formation of the condensate .",
    "notice also that the external harmonic trapping of the condensate also breaks the translation invariance of the condensate ground state and as such should be treated on an equal footing with other translation symmetry breaking fields .",
    "indeed , the continuous translation symmetries absent in the vortex lattice state are already broken in the nonrotating ground state by the external trapping potentials .",
    "the fact that in a rotating harmonically trapped bose ",

    "the assumption of the hydrodynamic continuum theories that the vortex core size is small in comprarison to the intervortex distance in the lattice is not satisfied by these small vortex arrays which explains the disagreement between the calculated bogoliubov modes and the continuum theory predictions .",
    "furthermore , the shaded gray area corresponds to a region below the critical vortex nucleation frequency within the thomas  fermi approximation , and does not contain any vortices and therefore also the tkachenko mode does not exist in that region .",
    "it is thus clear that the continuum theory is not applicable for these finite - size few vortex arrays and therefore further work is required in order to theoretically explain the low - lying dispersion of tkachenko modes .     of the @xmath68 tkachenko mode as a function of @xmath0 corresponding to 1 , 2 , 3 , 7 , 12 , and 19 vortex ground states ( filled circles ) and the dashed and solid curves are continuum theory predictions using two different values , @xmath98 and @xmath99 respectively , for the effective wavevector @xmath100 , see eq .",

    "similar minimum in the tkachenko mode frequency , plotted as a function of the trap rotation frequency , was also observed in a prolate three dimensional system where the minimum was observed at nonzero excitation energy @xcite . that seven classical vortices in a ring arrangement is a marginally stable configuration having a normal mode with precisely zero frequency @xcite is therefore likely a coincidence rather than a generic property of seven vortex systems .",
    "further clues for why such minimum in the tkachenko mode emerges may be obtained by considering the angular momenta of the tkachenko mode quasiparticles .",
    "figure [ fig6 ] shows the difference @xmath101 between the angular momentum per particle of the respective two lowest excitation modes in the system plotted as a function of number of vortices in the rotating ground state corresponding to different trap rotation frequencies .",
    "it shows that the difference @xmath101 changes sign having a zero crossing for small number of vortices in the system .",
    "this observation suggests the following interpretation .",
    "rotation of the condensate atoms and vortices are coupled by magnus force , which drives the vortex dynamics .",
    "therefore the vortices can not move in the condensate independently of the condensate superflow .",
    "this coupling between the superfluid and its vortices results in the finite frequency for the tkachenko modes . for zero energy tkachenko mode",
    "the  rotational symmetry breaking is restored \" where the angular momentum of the vortex field is equal to the angular momentum of the condensate field and the coupling between these two fields vanishes making them noninteracting .",
    "hence the vortex lattice can execute purely azimuthal rotation without affecting the atom field .    for nonzero tkachenko frequencies ,",
    "the angular rotation frequency of the excited vortex lattice is different from that of the condensate .",
    "therefore , if the tkachenko mode is populated it will cause the vortex lattice to rotate faster than the equilibrium lattice .",
    "this will increase the vortex density @xmath102 .",
    "the increase in vortex density would increase angular momentum but since angular momentum is conserved the condensate atoms must be rearranged , which causes superflow that couples back to the motion of vortices via the magnus force .",
    "this self - consistent coupling between the atoms and vortices together with angular momentum conservation results in the elliptically polarized motion of the vortices in the tkachenko modes and their nonzero oscillation frequency . in a three dimensional system",
    "the third axial dimension provides an additional degree of freedom which can be used todeposit \" angular momentum .",
    "this means that it is possible to find parameters for which the angular momentum of the system becomes fine tuned with the vortex lattice so that there is no differential rotation between the lattice and the condensate due to the tkachenko mode .",
    "figure [ fig6 ] shows that for trap rotation frequencies below the tkachenko mode minimum the angular momentum of the tkachenko mode is larger than the condensate and therefore the vortex field tries to speed up the condensate . for trap rotation frequencies well above the tkachenko mode",
    "minimum the angular momentum of the tkachenko mode is smaller than the condensate and the vortex field tries to slow down the condensate . at zero tkachenko frequency",
    "there is no tension between the superfluid and the vortex lattice .",
    "finally , we note that in a classical unbounded point vortex system , there are two linearly dependent eigenmodes with orthogonal polarizations @xcite . the other corresponds to pure azimuthal rotation and has zero energy .",
    "the other corresponds to breathing or purely radial / longitudinal motion of the vortices .",
    "these two behaviour correspond to two polarization extremes of the same elliptical vortex trajectories . in a bose ",
    "einstein condensate with sufficiently strong dissipation the vortices in a lattice state will indeed spiral radially out of the system . in a bose ",
    "einstein condensate with zero energy tkachenko mode and zero dissipation the vortex motion will be purely azimuthal .     in angular momentum per particle of the two respective zero modes @xmath27 ( condensate ground state ) and @xmath68 ( tkachenko mode ) as a function of the number of vortices in the condensate .",
    "the second zero mode emerges where this curve crosses zero where the angular momentum of the tkachenko mode becomes equal to that of the condensate . ]",
    "in conclusion , we have identified a new , slowly rotating , regime of harmonically trapped bose  einstein condensates by observing a minimum in the tkachenko mode calculated as function of the angular rotation frequency of the external trapping potential .",
    "the observed minimum , which occurs in a few - vortex system does not exist in the theoretical predictions based on continuum hydrodynamics .",
    "we have found such a minimum to harbour a zero energy quasiparticle state in the elementary excitation spectrum of a rotating bose ",

    "the physical character of this zero mode is that of a tkachenko vortex wave .",
    "the zero energy tkachenko mode has the exceptional character of corresponding to a purely azimuthal motion of the vortices with zero amplitude in the radial component .",
    "as opposed to this , the lowest tkachenko mode generically has a finite excitation frequency consistent with the presence of a radial component of the associated vortex motion .",
    "since there is no energy cost associated with populating a zero energy tkachenko excitation mode , its presence implies the _ possibility _ of formation of a quasiparticle bose ",
    "einstein condensate of quanta of tkachenko waves . however , since the equations used here are linearized around the macroscopically occupied rotating condensate ground state , based on these calculations only , it is not possible to judge whether such a condensate will form in these systems or whether the degeneracy of the two zero modes will be lifted if the @xmath68 mode is populated appreciably .",

    "are expected to appear in rotating quantum gases with a massively degenerate ground state . here",
    "we observe ground state degeneracy already at finite @xmath75 .",
    "however , there remains an important question regarding the robustness of this zero mode with respect to quantum and thermal fluctuations and perturbations in external parameters .",
    "these results show that the existence of nambu ",
    "goldstone zero modes associated with spontaneously broken symmetries can depend on the subtle details of the system specific parameters .",

    "similar technique to excite tkachenko modes could also be applied to slowly rotating few - vortex condensates and the resulting torsional vortex motion detected using quasi - in - situ imaging of vortex dynamics @xcite .",
    "using such methods it should be possible to establish the presence of a minimum in the tkachenko mode at intermediate rotation frequencies , however , observing the zero mode directly would be difficult using this technique since it would take infinitely long to measure the period of a zero frequency excitation corresponding to ( non)motion of the vortices .",
