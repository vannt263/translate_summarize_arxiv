    "molecular anions play an important role in the chemistry of the interstellar medium@xcite , of carbon stars@xcite , and the earth s ionosphere@xcite . as pointed out in ref.@xcite",
    ", the presence of anions in the interstellar medium may have profound consequences for our understanding of the interstellar processing of the biogenic elements ( see e.g. ref.@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "yet as judged from the number of entries in the compilations of huber and herzberg@xcite ( for diatomics ) and of jacox@xcite ( for polyatomics ) , high- or even medium - resolution spectroscopic data for anions are relatively scarce compared to the amount of data available for neutral or even cationic species : in the 1992 review of hirota@xcite on spectroscopy of ions , only 13 molecular anions were listed in table vii , compared to 4 1/2 pages worth of entries for cations .",
    "( early reviews of anion spectroscopy are found in refs.@xcite , while ab initio studies of structure and spectroscopy of anions were reviewed fairly recently by botschwina and coworkers@xcite . ) some of the reasons for this paucity are discussed in the introductions to refs.@xcite .",
    "one such species is the hydroxyl anion , oh@xmath5 . by means of velocity modulation spectroscopy@xcite ,",
    "high - resolution fundamentals were obtained@xcite for three isotopomers , namely @xmath6oh@xmath5 , @xmath6od@xmath5 , and @xmath7oh@xmath5 ; in addition , some pure rotational transitions have been observed@xcite .",
    "lineberger and coworkers@xcite earlier obtained some rotational data in the course of an electron photodetachment study , and obtained precise electron affinities ( eas ) of 14741.03(17 ) and 14723.92(30 ) @xmath2 , respectively , for oh and od .",
    "very recently , the same group re - measured@xcite ea(oh ) and obtained essentially the same value but with a higher precision , 14741.02(3 ) @xmath2 .    the spectroscopic constants of oh@xmath5 were previously the subject of ab initio studies , notably by werner et al.@xcite using multireference configuration interaction ( mrci ) methods , and recently by lee and dateo ( ld)@xcite using coupled cluster theory with basis sets as large as @xmath8 $ ] .",
    "the ld paper is particularly relevant here .",
    "the ccsd(t ) ( coupled cluster with all single and double substitutions@xcite and a quasiperturbative treatment for triple excitations@xcite ) method , in combination with basis sets of at least @xmath9 quality and including an account for inner - shell correlation , can routinely predict vibrational band origins of small polyatomic molecules with a mean absolute error on the order of a few @xmath2 ( e.g. for c@xmath10h@xmath10@xcite , so@xmath10@xcite ) . yet while ld found very good agreement between their computed ccsd(t)/[6s5p4d3f2g/5s4p3d2f ] spectroscopic constants and available experimental data , consideration of further basis set expansion and of inner - shell correlation effects leads to a predicted fundamental @xmath11 at the ccsd(t ) basis set limit of 3566.2@xmath121 @xmath2 , about 11 @xmath2 higher than the experimental results@xcite of 3555.6057(22 ) @xmath2 , where the uncertainty in parentheses represents two standard deviations .",
    "in a recent benchmark study@xcite on the ground - state potential curves of the first - row diatomic hydrides using both ccsd(t ) and fci ( full configuration interaction ) methods , the author found that ccsd(t ) has a systematic tendency to overestimate harmonic frequencies of a ",
    "h stretching frequencies by on the order of 6 @xmath2 .",
    "even so , the discrepancy seen by ld is a bit out of the ordinary , and the question arises as to what level of theory is required to obtain ` the right result for the right reason ' in this case .    in the present work",
    ", we shall show that the discrepancy between the ccsd(t ) basis set limit and nature is mostly due to two factors : ( a ) neglect of the effect of connected quadruple excitations , and ( b ) neglect of scalar relativistic effects .",
    "when these are properly accounted for , the available vibrational transitions can be reproduced to within a fraction of a @xmath2 from the computed potential curve . in the context of the present special issue",
    ", this will also serve as an illustrative example of the type of accuracy that can be achieved for small systems with the present state of the art .",
    "predicted band origins for higher vibrational levels ( and ` hot bands ' ) may assist future experimental work on this system . finally , as by - products of our analysis",
    ", we will show that the electron affinity of oh can be reproduced to very high accuracy , and tentatively propose a slight upward revision of the dissociation energy of neutral hydroxyl radical , oh .",
    "the coupled cluster , multireference averaged coupled pair functional ( acpf)@xcite , and full ci calculations were carried out using molpro 98.1@xcite running on dec / compaq alpha workstations in our laboratory , and on the sgi origin 2000 of the faculty of chemistry .",
    "full ccsdt ( coupled cluster theory with all connected single , double and triple excitations@xcite ) and ccsd(tq ) ( ccsd with quasiperturbative corrections for triple and quadruple excitations@xcite ) calculations were carried out using aces ii@xcite on a dec alpha workstation .",
    "correlation consistent basis sets due to dunning and coworkers@xcite were used throughout .",
    "since the system under consideration is anionic , the regular cc - pv@xmath13z ( correlation consistent polarized valence @xmath13-tuple zeta , or v@xmath13z for short ) basis sets will be inadequate .",
    "we have considered both the aug - cc - pv@xmath13z ( augmented correlation consistent , or av@xmath13z for short ) basis sets@xcite in which one low - exponent function of each angular momentum is added to both the oxygen and hydrogen basis sets , as well as the aug@xmath14-cc - pv@xmath13z basis sets@xcite in which the addition is not made to the hydrogen basis set . in addition we consider both uncontracted versions of the same basis sets ( denoted by the suffix `` uc '' ) and the aug - cc - pcv@xmath13z basis sets@xcite ( acv@xmath13z ) which include added core - valence correlation functions . the largest basis sets considered in this work , aug - cc - pv6z and aug - cc - pcv5z , are of [ 8s7p6d5f4g3h2i/7s6p5d4f3g2h ] and [ 11s10p8d6f4g2h/6s5p4d3f2 g ] quality , respectively .    the multireference acpf calculations were carried out from a casscf ( complete active space scf ) reference wave function with an active space consisting of the valence @xmath15 orbitals as well as the @xmath16 rydberg orbitals : this is denoted cas(8/7)-acpf ( i , e , 8 electrons in 7 orbitals ) . while the inclusion of the @xmath16 orbitals is essential ( see below ) , the inclusion of the @xmath17 rydberg orbital ( i.e. , cas(8/8)-acpf ) was considered and found to affect computed properties negligibly .",
    "in addition , some exploratory cas - aqcc ( averaged quadratic coupled cluster@xcite ) calculations were also carried out .",
    "scalar relativistic effects were computed as expectation values of the one - electron darwin and mass - velocity operators@xcite for the acpf wave functions .",
    "the energy was evaluated at 21 points around @xmath18 , with a spacing of 0.01  .",
    "( all energies were converged to 10@xmath19 hartree , or wherever possible to 10@xmath20 hartree . )",
    "a polynomial in @xmath21 of degree 8 or 9 ( the latter if an f - test revealed an acceptable statistical significance for the nonic term ) was fitted to the energies . using the procedure detailed in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the dunham series@xcite thus obtained was transformed by derivative matching into a variable - beta morse ( vbm ) potential@xcite @xmath22\\right)^2\\ ] ] in which @xmath23 , @xmath24 is the ( computed or observed ) dissociation energy , and @xmath25 is an adjustable parameter related to that in the morse function .",
    "analysis of this function was then carried out in two different manners : ( a ) analytic differentiation with respect to @xmath21 up to the 12th derivative followed by a 12th - order dunham analysis using an adaptation of the acet program of ogilvie@xcite ; and ( b ) numerical integration of the one - dimensional schrdinger equation using the algorithm of balint - kurti et al.@xcite , on a grid of 512 points over the interval 0.5@xmath265@xmath26 .",
    "as expected , differences between vibrational energies obtained using both methods are negligible up to the seventh vibrational quantum , and still no larger than 0.4 @xmath2 for the tenth vibrational quantum .",
    "the largest basis set in which we were able to obtain a full ci potential curve was cc - pvdz+sp(o ) , which means the standard cc - pvdz basis set with the diffuse @xmath27 and @xmath28 function from aug - cc - pvdz added to oxygen .",
    "a comparison of computed properties for oh@xmath5 with different electron correlation methods is given in table [ npart ] , while their errors in the total energy relative to full ci are plotted in figure 1 .",
    "it is immediately seen that ccsd(t ) exaggerates the curvature of the potential surface , overestimating @xmath1 by 10 @xmath2 .",
    "in addition , it underestimates the bond length by about 0.0006  .",
    "these are slightly more pronounced variations on trends previously seen@xcite for the oh radical",
    ".    the problem does not reside in ccsd(t ) s quasiperturbative treatment of triple excitations : performing a full ccsdt calculation instead lowers @xmath1 by only 1.7 @xmath2 and lengthens the bond by less than 0.0001  .",
    "quasiperturbative inclusion of connected quadruple excitations , however , using the ccsd(tq ) method , lowers @xmath1 by 8.5 @xmath2 relative to ccsd(t ) , and slightly lengthens the bond , by 0.00025  .",
    "( essentially the same result was obtained by means of the ccsd+tq * method@xcite , which differs from ccsd(tq ) in a small sixth - order term @xmath29 . )",
    "no ccsdt(q ) code was available to the author : approximating the ccsdt(q ) energy by the expression @xmath30\\approx",
    "e[ccsdt]+ e[ccsd(tq ) ] - e[cc5sd(t ) ] = e[ccsdt ] + e_{5qq } + e_{5qt}$ ] , we obtain a potential curve in fairly good agreement with full ci .    what is the source of the importance of connected quadruple excitations in this case ?",
    "analysis of the fci wave function reveals prominent contributions to the wave function from @xmath31 double excitations ; while the @xmath16 orbitals are lumo+2 and lumo+3 rather than lumo , a large portion of them sits in the same spatial region as the occupied @xmath32 orbitals . in any proper multireference treatment",
    ", the aforementioned excitations would be in the zero - order wave function : obviously , the space of all double excitations therefrom would also entail quadruple excitations with respect to the hartree - fock reference , including a connected component .",
    "since the basis set sizes for which we can hope to perform ccsdt(q ) or similar calculations on this system are quite limited , we considered multireference methods , specifically acpf from a @xmath33 ^ 8 $ ] reference space ( denoted acpf(8/7 ) further on ) .",
    "as might be expected , the computed properties are in very close agreement with fci , except for @xmath1 being 1.5 @xmath2 too high .",
    "aqcc(8/7 ) does not appear to represent a further improvement , and adding the @xmath17 orbital to the acpf reference space ( i.e. acpf(8/8 ) ) affects properties only marginally .",
    "all relevant results are collected in table [ 1part ] .",
    "basis set convergence in this system was previously studied in some detail by ld at the ccsd(t ) level . among other things",
    ", they noted that @xmath1 still changes by 4 @xmath2 upon expanding the basis set from aug - cc - pvqz to aug - cc - pv5z .",
    "they suggested that @xmath1 then should be converged to about 1 @xmath2 ; this statement is corroborated by the ccsd(t)/aug - cc - pv6z results .",
    "since the negative charge resides almost exclusively on the oxygen , the temptation exists to use aug@xmath14-cc - pv@xmath13z basis sets , i.e. to apply aug - cc - pv@xmath13z only to the oxygen atom but use a regular cc - pv@xmath13z basis set on hydrogen . for @xmath13=t , this results in fact in a difference of 10 @xmath2 on @xmath1 , but the gap narrows as @xmath13 increases .",
    "yet extrapolation suggests convergence of the computed fundamental to a value about 1 @xmath2 higher than the aug - cc - pv@xmath13z curve .    for the av@xmath13z and av@xmath13z basis sets",
    "( @xmath13=t , q ) , the cas(8/7)-acpf approach systematically lowers harmonic frequencies by about 8 @xmath2 compared to ccsd(t ) ; for the fundamental the difference is even slightly larger ( 9.5 @xmath2 ) .",
    "interestingly , this difference decreases for @xmath13=5 .",
    "it was noted previously@xcite that the higher anharmonicity constants exhibit rather greater basis set dependence than one might reasonably have expected , and that this sensitivity is greatly reduced if uncontracted basis sets are employed ( which have greater radial flexibility ) .",
    "the same phenomenon is seen here .    in agreement with previous observations by ld",
    ", inner - shell correlation reduces the bond lengthen slightly , and increases @xmath1 by 56 @xmath2 .",
    "this occurs both at the ccsd(t ) and the cas(8/7)-acpf levels .      at our highest level of theory",
    "so far , namely cas(8/7)-acpf(all)/acv5z , @xmath11 is predicted to be 3559.3 @xmath2 , still several @xmath2 higher than experiment .",
    "the effects of further basis set improvement can be gauged from the difference between ccsd(t)/av6z and ccsd(t)/av5z results : one notices an increase of + 1.0 @xmath2 in @xmath1 and a decrease of 0.00006   in @xmath18 .",
    "we also performed some calculations with a doubly augmented cc - pv5z basis set ( i.e. d - av5z ) , and found the results to be essentially indistinguishable from those with the singly augmented basis set .",
    "residual imperfections in the electron correlation method can be gauged from the cas(8/7)-acpf @xmath34 fci difference with our smallest basis set , and appear to consist principally of a contraction of @xmath18 by 0.00004   and a decrease in @xmath1 by 1.5 @xmath2 .",
    "adding the two sets of differences to obtain a ` best nonrelativistic ' set of spectroscopic constants , we obtain @xmath11=3558.6 @xmath2 , still 3 @xmath2 above experiment .",
    "in both cases , changes in the anharmonicity constants from the best directly computed results are essentially nil .",
    "scalar relativistic corrections were computed at the cas(8/7)-acpf level with and without the @xmath35-like electrons correlated , and with a variety of basis sets .",
    "all results are fairly consistent with those obtained at the highest level considered , cas(8/7)-acpf(all)/acvqz , namely an expansion of @xmath18 by about 0.0001   and  most importantly for our purposes  a decrease of @xmath1 by about 3 @xmath2 .",
    "effects on the anharmonicity constants are essentially nonexistent .",
    "upon adding these corrections to our best nonrelativistic spectroscopic constants , we obtain our final best estimates .",
    "these lead to @xmath11=3555.44 @xmath2 for @xmath6oh@xmath5 , in excellent agreement with the experimental result@xcite 3555.6057(22 ) @xmath2 .",
    "the discrepancy between computed ( 3544.30 @xmath2 ) and observed@xcite ( 3544.4551(28 ) @xmath2 ) values for @xmath7oh@xmath5 is quite similar . for @xmath6od@xmath5",
    ", we obtain @xmath11=2625.31 @xmath2 , which agrees to better than 0.1 @xmath2 with the experimental value@xcite 2625.332(3 ) @xmath2 .",
    "our computed bond length is slightly shorter than the observed one@xcite for oh@xmath5 , but within the error bar of that for od@xmath5@xcite .",
    "if we assume an inverse mass dependence for the experimental diabatic bond distance and extrapolate to infinite mass , we obtain an experimentally derived born - oppenheimer bond distance of 0.96416(16 ) @xmath2 , in perfect agreement with our calculations .    while until recently it was generally assumed that scalar relativistic corrections are not important for first - and second - row systems , it has now been shown repeatedly ( e.g.@xcite ) that for kj / mol accuracy on computed bonding energies , scalar relativistic corrections are indispensable .",
    "very recently , csaszar et al.@xcite considered the effect of scalar relativistic corrections on the ab initio water surface , and found corrections on the same order of magnitude as seen for the hydroxyl anion here .",
    "finally , bauschlicher@xcite compared first - order darwin and mass - velocity corrections to energetics ( for single - reference acpf wave functions ) with more rigorous relativistic methods ( specifically , douglas - kroll@xcite ) , and found that for first - and second - row systems , the two approaches yield essentially identical results , lending additional credence to the results of both csaszar et al . and from the present work .",
    "( the same author found@xcite more significant deviations for third - row main group systems . )    is the relativistic effect seen here in oh@xmath0 unique to it , or does it occur in the neutral first - row diatomic hydrides as well ?",
    "some results obtained for bh , ch , nh , oh , and hf in their respective ground states , and using the same method as for oh@xmath0 , are collected in table [ rel ] . in general , @xmath36 is slightly lowered , and @xmath37 very slightly stretched  these tendencies becoming more pronounced as one moves from left to right in the periodic table .",
    "the effect for oh@xmath0 appears to be stronger than for the isoelectronic neutral hydride hf , and definitely compared to neutral oh . the excellent agreement ( @xmath38 @xmath2 on vibrational quanta ) previously seen@xcite for the first - row diatomic hydrides between experiment and ccsd(t)/acv5z potential curves with an fci correction is at least in part due to a cancellation between the effects of further basis set extension on the one hand , and scalar relativistic effects ( neglected in ref.@xcite ) on the other hand .",
    "the shape of the relativistic contribution to the potential curve is easily understood qualitatively : on average , electrons are somewhat further away from the nucleus in a molecule than in the separated atoms ( hence the scalar relativistic contribution to the total energy will be slightly smaller in absolute value at @xmath37 than in the dissociation limit ) : as one approaches the united atom limit , however , the contribution will obviously increase again .",
    "the final result is a slight reduction in both the dissociation energy and on @xmath36 .    in order to assist future experimental studies on oh@xmath5 and",
    "its isomers , predicted vibrational quanta @xmath39 are given in table [ gn ] for various isotopic species , together with some key spectroscopic constants .",
    "the vbm parameters of the potential are given in table [ vbm ] .",
    "the vbm expansion generally converges quite rapidly@xcite and , as found previously for oh , parameters @xmath40 and @xmath41 are found to be statistically not significant and were omitted .",
    "the vbm expansion requires the insertion of a dissociation energy : we have opted , rather than an experimental value , to use our best calculated value ( see next paragraph ) .",
    "agreement between computed and observed fundamental frequencies speaks for itself , as does that between computed and observed rotational constants . at first sight agreement for the rotation - vibration coupling constants",
    "@xmath42 is somewhat disappointing .",
    "however , for @xmath6oh@xmath5 and @xmath7oh@xmath5 , the experimentally derived ` @xmath42 ' actually corresponds to @xmath43 , i.e. to @xmath44 .",
    "if we compare the observed @xmath43 with the computed @xmath45 instead , excellent agreement is found . in the case of @xmath6od@xmath5 , the experimentally derived @xmath42 given",
    "is actually extrapolated from neutral @xmath6od : again , agreement between computed and observed @xmath43 is rather more satisfying .",
    "we also note that our calculations validate the conclusion by lee and dateo that the experimentally derived @xmath1 and @xmath46 for @xmath6oh should be revised upward .",
    "this was obtained in the following manner , which is a variant on w2 theory@xcite : ( a ) the casscf(8/7 ) dissociation energy using acvtz , acvqz , and acv5z basis sets was extrapolated geometrically using the geometric formula @xmath47 first proposed by feller@xcite ; ( b ) the dynamical correlation component ( defined at cas(8/7)-acpf(all ) @xmath34 casscf(8/7 ) ) of the dissociation energy was extrapolated to infinite maximum angular momentum in the basis set , @xmath48 from the acvqz ( @xmath49=4 ) and acv5z ( @xmath49=5 ) results using the formula@xcite @xmath50 ; ( c ) the scalar relativistic contribution obtained at the cas(8/7)-acpf level was added to the total , as was the spin - orbit splitting@xcite for o@xmath5(@xmath51 ) .",
    "our final result , @xmath4=4.7796 ev , is about 0.02 ev higher than the experimental one@xcite ; interestingly enough , the same is true for the oh radical ( computed @xmath4=4.4124 ev , observed 4.392 ev ) . in combination with either the experimental electron affinity of oxygen atom ,",
    "ea(o)=1.461122(3 ) ev@xcite or the best computed ea(o)=1.46075 ev@xcite , this leads to electron affinities of oh , ea(oh)=1.8283 ev and 1.8280 ev , respectively , which agree to three decimal places with the experimental value@xcite 1.827611(4 ) ev .",
    "we note that the experimental @xmath24(oh@xmath5 ) is derived from @xmath24(oh)@xmath52ea(oh)@xmath34ea(o ) , and that a previous calibration study on the atomization energies of the first - row hydrides@xcite suggested that the experimental @xmath24(oh ) may be too low . while a systematic error in the electronic structure treatment that cancels almost exactly between oh and oh@xmath5 can not entirely be ruled out , the excellent agreement obtained for the electron affinity does lend support to the computed @xmath24 values .",
    "we have been able to obtain a fully ab initio radial function of spectroscopic quality for the hydroxyl anion . in order to obtain accurate results for this system , inclusion of connected quadruple excitations ( in a coupled cluster expansion )",
    "is imperative , as is an account for scalar relativistic effects .",
    "basis set expansion effects beyond @xmath53 take a distant third place in importance . while consideration of connected quadruple excitation effects and of basis set expansion effects beyond @xmath53 would at present be prohibitively expensive for studies of larger anions",
    ", no such impediment would appear to exist for inclusion of the scalar relativistic effects ( at least for one - electron darwin and mass - velocity terms ) .",
    "our best computed ea(oh ) , 1.828 ev , agrees to three decimal places with the best available experimental value .",
    "our best computed dissociation energies , @xmath4(oh@xmath5)=4.7796 ev and @xmath4(oh)=4.4124 ev , suggest that the experimental @xmath4(oh)=4.392 ev ( from which the experimental @xmath4(oh@xmath5 ) was derived by a thermodynamic cycle ) may possibly be about 0.02 ev too low",
    ".    one of the purposes of the paper by lee and dateo@xcite was to point out to the scientific community , and in particular the experimental community , that state - of - the art ab initio methods now have the capability to predict the spectroscopic constants of molecular anions with sufficient reliability to permit assignment of a congested spectrum from an uncontrolled environment  such as an astronomical observation  on the basis of the theoretical calculations alone .",
