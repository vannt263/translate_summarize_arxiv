    "a major cornerstone for the future of ground - based observations is the availability of adaptive optics ( ao ) systems on large telescopes ( for reviews see @xcite and @xcite ) . with ao one",

    "the result is imaging and spectroscopy at or close to the diffraction limit of the telescopem using the ao system naco @xcite ] . for ao observations a natural guide star ( ngs )",
    "is needed as a reference source to assess the degradation of the wavefronts due to the turbulent atmosphere .",
    "the availability of a bright enough reference source significantly reduces the sky coverage . however , large scale surveys like the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , @xcite ) and the rosat all sky survey ( rass , @xcite ) provide means to effectively search for interesting extragalactic sources suitable for ao observations .",
    "a challenge for large telescopes like the vlt is to study faint optical counterparts of x - ray background ( xrb ) objects in order to understand e.g. the connection between nuclear activity ( accretion onto a supermassive black hole ) and structure of the host galaxy ( e.g. morphology , stellar populations , etc . ) , i.e. to find out about the physical conditions of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and the galaxy hosts they reside in .",
    "the soft xrb in the 0.5 - 2  kev regime has been mostly resolved into discrete sources , of which the majority turns out to be agn .",
    "their nature still remains mysterious .",
    "what is found is that the xrb is much harder than the x - ray emission of unobscured agn in the local universe .",
    "therefore the existence of a substantial obscured agn population is required .",
    "however , the question remains whether these objects are hardened due to extinction or whether the central engine itself has a hard spectrum .",
    "the hard x - ray sources are found preferentially at lower redshifts , in contradiction to predictions of xrb models @xcite .",
    "nir observations of optical counterparts within reach of 10  m class telescopes can contribute to these issues by providing intrinsic host galaxy luminosities as well as information on the host environment ( nuclear excitation , star formation as well as dynamically deduced host and possibly black hole masses ) ( cf .",

    "based on a cross - correlation of optical ( sdss , first data release @xcite ) and x - ray data ( rass ) we searched for extragalactic targets having a possible ngs within an angular distance of @xmath0 and a @xmath1-band , and @xmath2 . ]",

    ", the presented extragalactic objects will also be well in reach of future vlti observations ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this straightforward search resulted in 317 candidate pairs .",
    "the objects classified as galaxies suffer a certain contamination by saturated stars , which we addressed by visual inspection .",
    "the next step , as discussed in @xcite , was to make sure we only take those galaxies which are the most probable counterparts of the x - ray sources , i.e. ( 1 ) a x - ray / optical angular separation of less than @xmath0 , ( 2 ) a hardness ratio larger than @xmath7 , and ( 3 ) no x - ray extent of the x - ray source with respect to the rosat point - spread function .",
    "application of these criteria gives a final set of 78 galaxy / ngs pairs .",
    "the galaxies of this sample cover the redshift range @xmath8 ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) . using the exsas tool",
    ", we calculated the x - ray luminosities assuming a power - law index of @xmath9 and an average galactic @xmath10 column density of @xmath11  @xmath12 .",
    "the x - ray luminosities are in the range @xmath13  erg  s@xmath14 ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) . studying the optical colors ( @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) , our manual classification is consistent with classification schemes like the @xmath17 color separator between late- and early - type galaxies",
    "@xcite , or typical qso colors ( where @xmath18 ) @xcite , and the classification with respect to the x - ray luminosity ( fig .",

    "our sample therefore represents a significant first step to a statistically relevant  i.e. large number of interesting sources  sample of galaxies suitable for ao and interferometric observations .",
    "the combination of the sdss and rosat surveys demonstrates to be a rich source for the search for interesting extragalactic targets .",
    "this is especially useful for future high resolution and sensitive imaging and spectroscopy in the infrared on large telescopes like the vlt(i ) and the lbt .",
