    "for more than a decade after powerful x - ray emission was established as a common property of agn ( @xcite , pounds 1977 ) little insight on the nature of the x - ray source was gained from spectra which were well - modelled by a featureless power law continuum of photon index @xmath3  @xmath4 .",
    "the increased spectral bandwidth of the combined me and le detectors on yielded evidence that the spectrum of many agn steepened below @xmath5  kev , the so - called soft excess ( arnaud 1985 , turner & pounds 1989 ) . since that time",
    "new x - ray satellites have brought major improvements in spectral resolution , sensitivity and bandwidth , providing x - ray spectra of increasing complexity ( and diagnostic potential ) .",
    "the particular strengths of each new mission has led to new areas of research , with the high energy response of establishing the widespread importance of ` reflection ' ( nandra & pounds 1994 ) , showing absorption in photoionised matter to be surprisingly strong ( turner 1993 ) , resolving discrete spectral features , including a broad fluorescent iron k line ( tanaka 1995 , nandra 1997 ) and providing uniquely broad bandwidth data .    and have now taking this evolution a large step further , with high - throughput grating spectra providing a qualitative improvement in spectroscopic detail .",
    "the most striking results to date have been in the detection of complex absorption and emission spectra in the soft x - ray band ( e.g. kaspi 2001 ) where the 1- or 2-stage photoionisation model of the ` warm absorber ' ( e.g. reynolds 1997 ) has been shown to be an inadequate description . instead , the and grating spectra have shown the ( often outflowing ) material illuminated by the central x - ray source to exhibit a remarkably wide range of ionisation stages ( behar 2001 ) . interpretation and modelling of these data is already promising a dramatic improvement in mapping the structure , content and dynamics of matter in the nuclear region of seyfert galaxies .",
    "conversely , modelling the temperature and ionisation of this gas will provide a unique measure of the total ionising flux , including the often dominant xuv component invisible from earth .",
    "to date , less progress has been made in utilising the diagnostic potential of the broader - band spectra from the epic cameras on ; to briefly explore that potential is the purpose of the present paper which brings together epic spectra from 6 seyfert galaxies observed early in the mission and covering the ( 2 - 10 kev ) x - ray luminosity range @xmath6erg sec@xmath7 .",
    "the present sample represents the start of an ambition to develop a big picture of the x - ray spectra of radio - quiet agn , to identify general features and trends , and attempt to determine the influence of the ` primary variants ' , namely the luminosity , relative accretion rate and black hole mass .",
    "table 1 lists the sources included in the present sample , in order of x - ray luminosity , together with the dates , exposure time and original status of each observation .",
    "figure 1 shows the broad spectral features for these agn , in each case plotted as a ratio of the observed epic spectrum to a simple power law plus galactic absorption model .",
    "data from the pn camera are used in all the figures but the analysis and interpretation that follows is also consistent with data from the mos cameras . for an initial visual comparison all spectra",
    "have been fitted in the 212 kev band and then extrapolated to the lower limit of the reliably calibrated epic data .",
    "several common features stand out , together with some clear differences and apparent trends .",
    "these are discussed in the following sections .",
    ".observing log of epic - pn spectra [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ mcg ]      it is well known that the shape and strength of the broad component of the fe k line , so important as a diagnostic of the innermost regions close to the black hole ( fabian 2000 ) , depends critically on fitting the underlying continuum correctly . in the examples shown in figure 1 it seems possible to identify the power law component in all cases , except perhaps mcg -6 - 30 - 15 . in mkn 766 , where a broad fe k line is widely reported ( nandra 1997 , leighly 1999 , mason 2002 ) , visual examination of the spectral ratio",
    "does indicate such a feature .",
    "one cautionary remark , however , is to point out the importance of correctly fitting the data above @xmath8  kev .",
    "this is not well constrained by data ( and was even less so in ) , but there is some visual indication of absorption above the fe k edge ( figure 4(a ) ) .",
    "such absorption could be a consequence of ` reflection ' , or may arise in matter , neither of which are as yet very well constrained .",
    "it is interesting to note that the inclusion of an absorption edge in the fit to the epic data of mkn 766 ( figure 4(b ) ) has a significant effect on the parameters of the broad fe k line , as it lowers the underlying power law index by @xmath9 .",
    "ignoring an absorption edge , the underlying power law fitted to the data at 25 kev and above 7 kev ( the typical recipe ) is @xmath3  @xmath10 . a broad line is required to fit the residuals and a good fit ( @xmath11/dof of 733/794 ) is obtained with a kerr line at 6.5 kev with ew of @xmath12  ev .",
    "inclusion of an edge at @xmath8  kev and fitting the power law between 26 kev and 6.812 kev reduces the power law slope to @xmath3  @xmath13 .",
    "no broad line is then required , a good fit over the 212 kev band being obtained ( @xmath11/dof of 723/795 ) with just the absorption edge ( @xmath14  kev , @xmath15 ) and a relatively narrow fe k line ( e  @xmath16  kev , @xmath17  kev , ew",
    "@xmath18  ev ) . we note that from the data @xmath19 ( and implicitly also for data ) the absorption edge provides the main determinant of reflection , which in this case is consistent with an origin in the ` cold , distant matter ' responsible for the narrow fe k line .",
    "it is interesting , finally , to test the ` prototype ' broad fe k line seyfert , mcg-6 - 30 - 15 ( tanaka 1995 , iwasawa 1996 , wilms 2001 ) with a model that allows for the fe k absorption edge indicated in the data .",
    "figure 5(a ) shows the deviations from a simple power law fit over the 312 kev band . as with mkn 766",
    ", an acceptable spectral fit is obtained over this band ( @xmath11/dof of 557/494 ) with a power law , narrow fe k line and absorption edge .",
    "the best - fit parameters are : a power law of @xmath3  @xmath20 ; a narrow line at @xmath21  kev , with width @xmath22  kev , and ew @xmath23  ev ; and an edge of depth @xmath24 at @xmath25  kev ( figure 5(b ) ) .",
    "however , a still better fit is obtained ( @xmath11/dof of 511/488 ) with the addition of an extreme broad component to the fe k line , at @xmath26  kev , with disc emissivity @xmath27 of @xmath28 and ew of @xmath29  ev , together with a narrow line ( @xmath30  kev , sigma @xmath31  kev , ew @xmath32  ev ) and absorption edge ( @xmath33  kev , @xmath34 ) .",
    "the power law slope is essentially unchanged at @xmath3  @xmath35 .",
    "examination of the residuals of the previous fit ( figure 5 ( b ) ) suggests the broad line is modelling quite subtle curvature in the epic data between 36 kev .",
    "extension of the latter model over the full epic spectrum ( 0.510 kev ) also gives a remarkably good fit , where the spectral curvature below @xmath36  kev is modelled by the addition of line - of - sight ionised gas with a column density @xmath37 @xmath38 and ionisation parameter @xmath39 ( figure 6 ) .",
    "clearly this fit ( summarised in table 2 ) is only a crude approximation to the complex spectrum seen in the rgs and data ; however , it is reassuring that an acceptable broad - band fit can be made to this most complex spectrum ( see figure 1 ) , offering the promise of developing self - consistent models of seyfert x - ray spectra in which the primary x - ray continuum can be resolved from the superimposed absorption and emission features .",
    "the most striking aspect of the range of epic spectra displayed in figure 1 is the presence in every case of a strong soft emission component which causes the x - ray continuum to turn up sharply below @xmath2  0.7 kev in the lower luminosity sources ( ssx ) , and is evident as a gradual up - turn ( gsx ) , below @xmath2  3 kev for the high luminosity sources .",
    "the form and location of the ssx is strongly suggestive of a link with k - shell oxygen , though - unsurprisingly - the lower resolution epic data can not distinguish between the alternative descriptions ( relativistically broadened line emission , sako 2001 ; complex absorption , lee 2001 ) currently being advocated for mcg-6 - 30 - 15 and mkn 766 .",
    "rgs spectra do confirm the absence of strong absorption in the higher luminosity sources in our sample , mkn 509 and pks 0558 - 504 .",
    "this leads us to speculate that a broad soft emission component extending up to @xmath2  3  kev ( arising by comptonisation of cool disc photons ) may be common to our sample , but is obscured by increasingly strong absorption from ionised gas for the lower luminosity seyferts ngc 5548 , mkn 766 and mcg-6 - 30 - 15 .",
    "we emphasise the complementary strengths of broad - band data from epic and higher resolution spectra from the rgs in providing the input for improved modelling of the primary x - ray continuum and - consequently - of absorption and secondary emission features that carry unique information on the x - ray emission mechanism and nuclear environment in seyfert galaxies .",
    "one such secondary emission feature , the narrow fe k emission line at 6.4 kev , is found to be a common property across our sample ( apart from the highest luminosity object pks 0558 - 504 ) .",
    "the ew of @xmath2  50100 ev is consistent with reflection from cold , distant matter subtending a solid angle of 12 @xmath40 steradians at the hard x - ray source .",
    "line profile and variability studies offer the promise of using this emission line to probe dense cold matter from the outer disc to the molecular torus .",
    "we suggest the broad fe k line may not be as common , or as strong , as it appeared to be from earlier observations .",
    "a key factor is the need to correctly model the spectrum above @xmath2  7 kev , where has improved - though still limited - sensitivity .",
    "also , as spectral fits to the mcg-6 - 30 - 15 data show , precise calibration of x - ray optics and detectors is critical to validating measurements of the important broad fe k line .",
    "we thank rick edelson for permission to work on the epic data from his go observation of ngc 5548 and to jorn wilms for access to the gt observation of mcg-6 - 30 - 15 .",
    "grateful thanks are also due to the dedicated efforts of the many colleagues who delivered and continue to sustain the powerful observatory .",
    "is funded by the european space agency with support from nasa .",
    "the epic instrument was funded by the uk , germany , france and italy and developed by a team led by martin turner .",
