    "in 1947 mills @xcite proved that there exists a constant @xmath0 such that @xmath9 is a  prime for every positive integer @xmath2 .",
    "mills proof used ingham s result @xcite that there is always a prime in the interval @xmath10 for some constant @xmath11 . since @xmath11 was not determined explicitly , mills could not determine @xmath0 or even a range for @xmath0 .",
    "many authors citing mills constant either follow his example and remain silent about @xmath0 s value ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , or explicitly state that it is unknown ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) . but recently a few authors have begun to state that @xmath0 is approximately @xmath3 ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and sloane http://www.research.att.com/cgi-bin/access.cgi/as/~njas/sequences/eisa.cgi?anum=a051254 [ ] ) .",
    "they do this despite the fact that it is currently impossible to compute @xmath0 without any further unproven assumptions , and despite the fact that for each @xmath12 , there are uncountably many possible values @xmath0 for which @xmath13 is prime for each positive integer @xmath2 .",
    "the authors who approximate mills constant @xmath0 also implicitly define _",
    "constant _ to be the least @xmath0 such that @xmath9 is prime for all positive integers @xmath2 .",
    "mills original article contained no numerics  it only showed that such an @xmath0 exists .    in section  [ sec : gaps ] we observe that , assuming the riemann hypothesis , it easily follows that there is at least one prime between @xmath14 and @xmath15 for every @xmath16 ( lemma  [ lemma : between_cubes ] ) .",
    "we then use this to determine mills constant @xmath0 to over @xmath4 decimal places in section [ sec : mills ] .",
    "this requires a substantial computing effort to calculate the associated _",
    "mills primes _ @xmath17 explicitly for @xmath18 , @xmath19 .",
    "in particular we find prove the following :    [ thm : a250digits ] assume the riemann hypothesis .",
    "the minimum mills constant ( for the exponent c=@xmath20 ) begins with the following @xmath21 digits :    [ cols= \" > , < , < , <",
    ", < \" , ]     we also find the two probable - primes which are ( most likely ) the next terms in the sequence of mills primes .",
    "the last of these has @xmath22 digits .",
    "concerning other problems that involve prime gaps , let @xmath23 , @xmath24 be the @xmath2-th odd prime number and @xmath25 , the gap between consecutive prime numbers .",
    "the cramr - granville conjecture @xcite states that @xmath26 for some constant @xmath27 .",
    "the last section is an application of this conjecture on prime gaps to honaker s problem .",
    "honaker s problem @xcite is to find all trios of consecutive prime numbers @xmath28 , such that @xmath29 .",
    "we call such triples of consecutive prime numbers _ honaker trios _ and conjecture that there are only three honaker trios : @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 .",
    "we establish that there are only three honaker trios @xmath33 for @xmath34 and prove :    [ thm:3honakertrios ] the cramr - granville conjecture with any constant @xmath35 implies that there are only a finite number of honaker trios .",

    "@xmath40 in other words @xmath41 is the sequence of primes that are followed by maximal gaps ( sloan http://www.research.att.com/cgi-bin/access.cgi/as/~njas/sequences/eisa.cgi?anum=a002386 [ ] ) .",

    "it is clear that @xmath55 for every @xmath56 . now using nicely s tables of maximal gaps @xcite we can easily verify the following result :    [ cor:1 ] for @xmath57 , we have @xmath58    to explicitly determine mills",

    "recall @xmath59    [ lemma : schoenfeld ] assume the riemann hypothesis . for @xmath60",
    ", we have @xmath61    ( much stronger bounds are now available @xcite , but this is sufficient for our current needs . )    using this lemma we see that if @xmath62 , then @xmath63 this last lower bound is an increasing function of @xmath64 and it is greater than one for @xmath62 .",
    "after using a computer program to check the smaller values of @xmath64 we have shown the following :    [ lemma : between_cubes ] assume the riemann hypothesis .",
    "there is at least one prime between @xmath14 and @xmath15 for every @xmath65 .",
    "this lemma states that , under the riemann hypothesis , there are prime numbers between consecutive cubes ; we will see that this is necessary to calculate mills constant in the next section .    without the riemann hypothesis it is still possible to use explicit upper bounds on the zeta function @xcite to get a version of lemma [ lemma : between_cubes ] with a far larger value of @xmath66 , roughly @xmath67 @xcite . in the next section",
    "we will show that calculating mills constant involves explicitly finding a prime larger than the cube - root of this bound .",
    "this bound so dramatically exceeds current computing abilities , that any current calculation of mills constant must involve an unproven assumption .",
    "this bound @xmath66 should get much smaller as the bounds on the zeta function are improved .",
    "we begin this section with a lemma .    [ lemma : xc ] if @xmath68 and @xmath69 , then @xmath70 .    dividing by @xmath71 and replacing @xmath64 with @xmath72 we arrive at the equivalent inequality @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) .",

    "now if @xmath76 , differentiate the right side with respect to @xmath78 to get @xmath79 , which is clearly positive , so the inequality above holds for all @xmath80",

    "when constructing the sequence @xmath102 in the previous proof , the condition ( a ) can be relaxed in two important ways .",
    "first , by replacing the words ` the least ' with ` any ' , we see there are infinitely many choices for @xmath91 , and hence for the resulting value @xmath0 .",
    "second , it is not necessary that @xmath103 be satisfied by @xmath91 , as long as the terms satisfying ( b ) exist to a term @xmath104 which does satisfy @xmath105 .",
    "this will someday be important in removing the assumption of the riemann hypothesis from theorem [ thm : a250digits ] by calculating a sequence of primes @xmath106 that extends to the cube root of the bound @xmath66 discussed at the end of the previous section .",
    "it is proved by baker _ et . al .",

    "[ prop : infinite_as ] for every @xmath12 , there exist infinitely many @xmath0 s such that @xmath108 is a prime for every @xmath2 .",
    "wright @xcite showed that the set of possible values of the constants @xmath0 and @xmath78 in this proposition ( and several generalizations @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) have the same cardinality as the continuum and are nowhere dense .",
    "so authors approximating `` mills constant '' must first decide how to choose just one .",

    "so to follow his proof literally would require that the first prime be @xmath111 ( and producing a constant @xmath112 ) .",
    "but all authors offering an approximation agree implicitly on starting with the prime @xmath42 and then choosing the least possible prime at each step , so we take this as the definition of _ mills constant_.    the sequence of minimal primes satisfying the criteria of the proof with @xmath109 ( sloan http://www.research.att.com/cgi-bin/access.cgi/as/~njas/sequences/eisa.cgi?anum=a051254 [ ] ) begins with @xmath113    these first six terms were well known .",
    "we have now shown that assuming the riemann hypothesis , prime numbers exist between consecutive cubes , so ( with rh ) we know this sequence can be continued indefinitely .    to make these fast growing primes @xmath114 easier to present , define a sequence @xmath115 by @xmath116 .",
