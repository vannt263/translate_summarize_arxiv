    "reconciling the cold dark matter ( cdm ) predictions of supersymmetric models with the stringent constraints from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) has been one of the challenges within the particle physics community in recent years .",
    "the amount of cdm deduced from wmap data @xcite puts severe constraints on possible dark matter candidates , inluding the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) .",
    "additional constraints on the model parameters are obtained by imposing yukawa unification , and by taking into account the bounds from flavour changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) .",
    "in addition to the above , the neutrino data of the past years provided evidence for the existence of neutrino oscillations and masses , pointing for the first time to physics beyond the standard model . as expected ,",
    "the additional interactions required to generate neutrino masses also affect the energy dependence of the couplings of the mssm , and thus modify the yukawa unification predictions .",
    "a first observation had been that the additional interactions of neutrinos , which affect the tau mass , may spoil bottom - tau unification for small @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "subsequently , however , it has been realised that large lepton mixing naturally restores unification , and even allows unification for intermediate values of @xmath0 that were previously disfavoured @xcite .",
    "this is done by making the simple observation that the @xmath4 equality at the gut scale refers to the @xmath5 entries of the charged lepton and down quark mass matrices , while the detailed structure of the mass matrices is not predicted by the grand unified group itself .",
    "it is then possible to assume mass textures , such that , after diagonalisation at the gut scale , the @xmath6 and @xmath7 entries are no - longer equal .    in the current work , based on @xcite ,",
    "we revisit the issues of dark matter and yukawa unification taking into account the effects of massive neutrinos and large lepton mixing in see - saw models , and extending previous results to large @xmath0 .",
    "we find that the effects on the allowed parameter space are significant and , in fact , it turns out that yukawa unification in the presence of neutrinos is also compatible with a negative @xmath1 , unlike what happens if the effects of neutrinos are ignored . passing to the relic density of neutralinos",
    ", we study the consequences of large lepton mixing in the @xmath8 coannihilation region and in resonances in the @xmath9 annihilation channels , finding sizeable effects , particularly in the latter case .",
    "it is interesting to note that for the cosmologically favoured area , it is also possible to observe tau flavour violation at the lhc , in the framework of non - minimal supersymmetric grand unification @xcite .",
    "in the presence of massive neutrinos , the predictions for @xmath10 and unification clearly get modified .",
    "radiative corrections from the neutrino yukawa couplings have to be included in renormalisation group runs from @xmath11 to @xmath12 ( scale of the heavy right - handed neutrinos ) .",
    "below @xmath13 , right - handed neutrinos decouple from the spectrum and an effective see - saw mechanism is operative ; the relevant equations are given in @xcite .",
    "in addition , if the gut scale lies significantly below a scale @xmath14 , at which gravitational effects can no longer be neglected , the renormalization of couplings at scales between @xmath14 and @xmath11 may induce additional effects to the running and the simplest example is provided by minimal su(5 ) @xcite ( however , modifications to soft masses are in this simplest case proportional to the @xmath15 mixing @xcite , and thus are significantly suppressed ) .",
    "nevertheless , it has been realized that the influence of the runs above the gut scale on the dark matter abundance can be very sizeable @xcite , due to changes in the relation between @xmath16 and @xmath17 , which is crucial in the coannihilation area .",
    "this we discuss in a subsequent section .    in supersymmetric models",
    ", unification is very sensitive to the model parameters @xcite , particularly the higgs mixing parameter , @xmath1 . to correctly obtain pole masses within this framework , the standard model and supersymmetric threshold corrections have to be included ;",
    "for the bottom quark , these corrections result to a @xmath18 that can be very large , particularly for large values of @xmath0 @xcite . constraints from br(@xmath19 ) are also included in the analysis . before passing to the results ,",
    "however , let us summarise a few facts on the possible range of the mass of the bottom quark : the 2-@xmath20 range for the @xmath21 bottom running mass , @xmath22 , is from 4.1 - 4.4 gev .",
    "moreover , @xmath23 , and the central value of @xmath24 corresponds to @xmath25 from 2.82 to 3.06 gev .    in fig .",
    "[ mb1 ] , we summarize the predictions for @xmath10 in msugra and in the presence of massive neutrinos . in order to discuss the dependence of @xmath26 on @xmath0",
    ", we consider the set of soft parameters : @xmath27 gev , @xmath28 , @xmath29 gev .",
    "the figure exhibits the well - known fact that in the absence of phases or large trilinear terms , @xmath18 is positive for @xmath1 positive , and therefore the theoretical prediction for the @xmath30 quark pole mass is too high to be reconciled with @xmath4 unification . on the other hand , for @xmath31 , @xmath18 is negative and the theoretical prediction for the b quark mass can lie within the experimental range for values of @xmath0 between roughly 25 and 45 ; clearly , for a large @xmath0 it is mandatory to take into account the large supersymmetric corrections to @xmath10  @xcite .     versus @xmath32 assuming @xmath33 at the high scale in the absence of lepton mixing .",
    "we work with the following set of parameters : @xmath34 gev , @xmath28 gev , @xmath35 gev .",
    "the experimental range of @xmath10 ( horizontal lines ) is also shown , the black thick ( blue thin ) lines have @xmath24 = 0.1212 ( 0.1132 ) , the dot - dash lines are obtained within the mssm , the solid lines include neutrino dirac yukawa up to the scale @xmath36 .",

    "the predictions for @xmath26 using the lower and upper bounds of the 2-@xmath20 experimental range of @xmath24 and the correponding range for @xmath26 after the evolution of the bounds on @xmath22 are shown for a scale @xmath41  gev .",
    "we observe that for @xmath42 the prediction for @xmath26 is always very large , despite its dependence on the soft terms through @xmath18 .",
    "for the values of the soft terms considered in fig.[mb1 ] , the allowed range of @xmath0 shrinks from @xmath43 to @xmath44 when we introduce the effect of see - saw neutrinos .",
    "it is also shown that the influence of runs above @xmath11 is too small to have any significant effect .",
    "the results are significantly modified once we consider the effects of lepton mixing in the diagonalisation and running of couplings from high to low energies . in order to show this , we focus on @xmath4 unification within the framework of su(5 ) gauge unification and flavour symmetries that provide consistent patterns for mass and mixing hierarchies , and naturally reconcile a small @xmath15 mixing with a large charged lepton one . taking into account the particle content of su(5 ) representations ( with symmetric up - type mass matrices , and down - type mass matrices that are transpose to the ones for charged leptons ) , one finds the approximate relations @xmath45 which , after diagonalization , lead to @xmath46 where @xmath47 parametrises the flavour mixing in the ( 2,3 ) sector .    in the left pannel of fig.[deltb ]",
    "we show the change of @xmath10 as a function of @xmath0 , when the effects from large lepton mixing are appropriately considered .",
    "comparing with the previous plots , we see how solutions with positive @xmath1 are now viable , for the whole range of @xmath0 .",
    "the appropriate size of the parameter @xmath47 in each case can be determined by imposing the relation @xmath48 at @xmath49 and investigating the values that are required in order to obtain a correct prediction for @xmath26 .",
    "this is shown in the right pannel of fig.[deltb ] , where we demand a value of @xmath26 at the center of its experimental range , for the central value of @xmath24 .     as a function of @xmath0 , when including lepton mixing effects .",
    "in the right panel , we show the required values @xmath47 for consistent unification .",
    "we use the set of soft terms of fig.[mb1 ] , @xmath50 and impose @xmath51  gev .",

    "in msugra ( or the cmssm ) for choices of soft terms below the tev scale , the lsp is bino like and the prediction for @xmath52 is typically too large for models that satisfy the experimental constraints on susy .",

    "* resonances in the @xmath9 annihilation channel , which occur for @xmath55 .",
