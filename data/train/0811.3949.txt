    "the efforts to miniaturize electronic devices have long motivated studies of electron transport in molecular and atomic scale devices .",
    "creating reliable electrical contacts with the molecule presents a major challenge in molecular electronics . until recently , in molecular electronic devices the molecule was typically attached between two normal metal , such as gold , electrodes  @xcite .",

    "apart from bulk graphite there are also quasi - one dimensional ( carbon nanotubes  @xcite ) and two - dimensional ( graphene  @xcite ) forms , which have remarkable mechanical and electrical properties and form strong chemical bonds with each other .",

    "formation of saccs between graphene electrodes fabricated by stretching a graphene strip has been observed in ref .  .",
    "sacc interconnects between graphene leads could form a basic unit for integration into more complicated circuits in the future .",
    "electron transport through saccs with graphene contacts has not been studied theoretically .",
    "we address this issue in the present paper .",
    "electron transport in saccs with metal leads has been studied numerically  @xcite .",
    "the conductance of an sacc strongly coupled to metal electrodes is of order of the conductance quantum and exhibits even - odd oscillations with the number of atoms in the chain , with the contrast ratio of order unity .    in this paper",
    "we show that electron transport through an sacc interconnect between graphene leads in the non - interacting electron approximation is described by an analytically solvable model .",
    "this enables us to gain physical insight into the essential features of electron transport .",
    "this model can also serve as the starting point for treating one - dimensional electron correlations in sacc and their influence on transport .",
    "the conductance of the system is qualitatively different from that in the case of metal leads . for all electron energies corresponding to practically relevant temperatures and doping levels",
    "the junction between the chain and the graphene lead is almost perfectly reflecting even at strong coupling between the chain and the lead .",
    "the transmission coefficient of the contact vanishes linearly with electron energy as the latter approaches the fermi energy of undoped graphene .",
    "this suppression of transmission results from the vanishing of density of states ( dos ) in graphene at zero doping . as a result electron transport through the interconnect proceeds via narrow resonant states in the chain that arise due to strong reflection at the junctions .",
    "the width and the position of the resonances depend on the length of the interconnect and the details of its coupling to the leads .",
    "the shape of low energy resonances is universal but markedly different from the breit - wigner form .",

    "this holds even in the case of leads with zigzag edges , which support edge states  @xcite .",
    "although edge states have a linear dispersion at low energies , their wave functions extend into the bulk to distances inversely proportional to the energy and give a linear in energy contribution to dos at the contact point .",
    "due to the resonant character of transmission the device conductance is very sensitive to the number of atoms in the chain . in the case of graphene",
    "leads the conductance difference between chains with odd and even number of atoms in the sacc ( which was first noted  @xcite in the case of metal leads ) becomes much more pronounced and appears as the difference between the on- and off- state conductance .",

    "linear molecules with degenerate electron states represent an exception to the jahn - teller theorem on the instability of the symmetric molecular configurations  @xcite . in this case",
    "the degenerate electron states have nonzero angular momenta @xmath0 about the molecule axis .",
    "thus the matrix element coupling the two states and the corresponding energy gain arises only in second or higher order in the vector displacements of the nuclei from the symmetry axis . in the linear sacc",
    "the two degenerate electron bands have angular momenta @xmath1 about the molecular axis , and their coupling arises only in second order in the nuclear displacements . in the peierls channel , which at zero doping corresponds to dimerization , the coupling between right and left movers is linear in the displacements .",
    "thus the two most likely candidates for the sacc structure are the linear chain of equidistant double bonded carbon atoms , known as cumulene ( @xmath2 ) , and the peierls - distorted dimerized chain , known as polyyne ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "this expectation is confirmed by numerical studies .",

    "the two remaining @xmath6 and @xmath7 orbitals form two doubly degenerate @xmath8 bands , which are half filled making undoped cumulene a one - dimensional conductor .",
    "numerical studies  @xcite also show that cumulene remains metallic under doping .",
    "if the sacc attached to the graphene leads is not too long the main features of electron transport through it can be understood within the single electron picture without accounting for electron - electron correlations .    as the conduction @xmath8 band in graphene leads",
    "is formed by the @xmath7 orbitals , which are perpendicular to the graphene plane , only the electrons from the @xmath9 band in sacc can propagate into the leads .",
    "thus electron transport is mediated by a single conducting band in the chain .",
    "because of the long mean free path of electrons in graphene  @xcite , electron motion in the leads may be assumed to be ballistic .",
    "the device conductance is then determined by the elastic electron scattering at the junctions between the molecular wire and the leads and backscattering in the chain .",
    "backscattering in the sacc due to electron - phonon interaction corresponds to emission or absorption of phonons with a wavelength of order of the interatomic spacing and energy of the order of @xmath10 . as a result",
    "such processes are exponentially suppressed  @xcite even at room temperature .",
    "although imperfections in the substrate and deviations of the atomic positions from the ideal configuration cause some backscattering of electrons in the wire , we show below that the strongest reflection of the electron wave in the chain occurs at the contact with the graphene lead .    with the aid of the fermi golden rule the transmission coefficient of the contact can be estimated as @xmath11 . here",
    "@xmath12 is the tunneling matrix element that couples the last atom in the chain to the lead , @xmath13 is the local dos at that atom and @xmath14 the dos an the graphene atom that is connected to the chain .",
    "the local dos in the chain is energy independent and can be estimated as @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the nearest neighbor hopping integral in the atomic wire .",

    "the simplicity of the hybridization pattern of electron orbitals in graphene and carbon chains enabled us to construct an analytically solvable model and thereby gain physical insight into the essential features of electron conduction in the system .",
    "transmission through the device is dominated by scattering at the contacts between the chain and the lead . for typical temperatures and doping levels in graphene the current - carrying electron states have energies much smaller than the band width . at these energies the contact between the chain and the lead becomes almost perfectly reflecting .",
    "its reflection amplitude can be expressed in terms of the green s function , @xmath176 , of the lead at the atomic site connected to the carbon chain , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : reflection_g ] ) . in this equation",
    "the parameter @xmath177 describes the strength of coupling between the chain and the lead . at low electron energies the phase factor @xmath178",
    "may be assumed energy independent , as it changes appreciably only at energy scales of order of the band width in the wire . in this regime",
    "the energy dependence of the transmission coefficient is dominated by that of the density of states in the lead . for graphene",

    "( [ eq : reflection_low ] ) and ( [ eq : contact_transmission_estimate ] ) .    for leads with",
    "zigzag edges both the bulk and edge states contribute to the dos at the contact point . due to the difference in the on - site energy between the atoms at the edge and in the interior of graphene the band of edge states acquires a finite dispersion .",
    "the spectrum of this band is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : edge_spectrum ] ) and is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .",
    "although the edge state spectrum is linear at small energies its contribution to the local dos at the edge is not constant , but rather is linear in the electron energy , @xmath179 .",
    "this occurs because the edge state wave functions extend into the bulk to distances which are inversely proportional @xmath19 , as explained in sec .",
    "[ sec : tunneling_dos ] .",
    "as the difference in the on - site potential between the atoms at the edge and in the interior of the lead is of the same order as the band width the contribution of edge states to the dos is of the same order as that of the bulk states .",

    "our main conclusions , namely the linear energy dependence of the transmission coefficient of the junction between the chain and the lead and the shape of the resonance in eq .",
    "( [ eq : transmission_resonance ] ) do not depend on many of the simplifying assumptions of our model .",
    "the linear energy dependence of the junction transmission coefficient holds if the coupling between the chain and the lead is energy independent .",
    "this assumption is valid as long as the electron energy is smaller than the inverse propagation time across the contact and holds for more complicated junctions , e.g. a small peninsular connecting the chain to the lead . in this case",
    "( [ eq : reflection_g ] ) and ( [ eq : transmission_small_epsilon ] ) will still hold , provided @xmath177 and @xmath171 are replaced by the appropriate parameters describing the coupling strength between the chain and the lead at low energies . similarly , eq .  ( [ eq : transmission_resonance ] )",
    "will also hold provided the resonance energy and the parameter @xmath180 are chosen appropriately .",

    "( [ eq : transmission_resonance_asymmetric ] ) .    the resonant character of transmission will be preserved even in the presence of the coulomb interaction in the wire , as long as wire is short enough so that the one - dimensional correlation effects can be neglected .",
    "such a wire will act as a molecule with a single resonant level participating in transport . for longer wires",
    "the one - dimensional correlations need to be taken into account . in this respect",
