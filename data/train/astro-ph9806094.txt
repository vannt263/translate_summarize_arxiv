    "globular clusters ( gcs ) are ubiquitous and apparently obey a universal formation mechanism @xcite as evidence by the constancy of the globlar cluster luminosity function ( gclf ) . however , this constancy of formation appears juxtaposed against the environments of the gcs host galaxies .",
    "the nature of this juxtaposition manifests itself in the variation of cluster specific frequency as a function of galaxy type and environment .    in order to compare globular cluster populations of two disparate galaxies ( say an e galaxy compared to an s0 ) the total number of clusters about that galaxy should be normalized to some trait which both objects have in common .",
    "the common measure in use is referred to as the globular cluster specific frequency and is defined as @xmath2 @xcite , where @xmath3 is the total cluster population and @xmath4 is the integrated v magnitude of the galaxy .",
    "observations of the globular cluster systems of brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) have revealed the compelling relationship between gc specific frequency and the x - ray luminosity ( @xmath1 ) of the host galaxy @xcite .",
    "this relation gives an intuitive explanation of the variation in @xmath0 amongst the galaxies of the same type and suggests that galaxy mass is the determining factor in cluster formation .",
    "use of x - ray temperatures ( @xmath5 ) to determine the radially dependent gas density within m87 and comparing this to the radial variations in cluster numbers has further revealed that the efficiency of cluster formation is a constant of the density of gas @xcite .",
    "the evidence that the formation efficiency of globulars is a constant with radius is reassuring to the previous result for bcgs as the relation between cluster numbers and @xmath1 was based solely on clusters within a distance @xmath6 of the bcg center .",
    "the final piece of the @xmath0 puzzle is the variation in @xmath0 between spiral and elliptical galaxies .",
    "use of the @xmath0 relation leads to the common result that spiral galaxies have a lower specific frequency than do ellipticals ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sn ] ) .",
    "this result is further emphasized when the high @xmath0 galaxies m87 and ngc 1399 are included and their total cluster populations are compared to their total luminosity .",
    "the reason for this variation of specific frequency is not yet well understood although many competing theories have been proposed and not all of these suggestions are obviously wrong .    the development of multi - object spectrographic devices has made the determination of the mass of remote galaxies using their cluster populations possible .",
    "these investigations use the clusters as test particles in the potential well of the parent galaxies mass distribution and provide a reasonable measure of the total mass of the galaxy ( for example bridges et al .",
    "although the full decomposition of the mass distribution is not possible @xcite the use of a model dependent mass estimator such as the projected mass estimator ( pme ) @xcite makes possible a comparison of the masses of the parent galaxies using the clusters themselves .",
    "several studies of galaxy halo masses using gcs as probes are now underway and the number of published results now makes clear the link between total cluster population and the mass of the parent galaxy .",
    "table  [ table : mass ] lists those galaxy whose masses have been determined via spectroscopy of the cluster population . for each of these galaxies",
    "the mass has been estimated using the pme modified to account for extended mass distributions @xcite .",
    "these estimates are not necessarily the most accurate for each individual galaxy ( in the cases of m87 @xcite and ngc 1399 @xcite the large numbers of velocities available make possible a more complex model analysis ) however , by using the same estimator similar biases are introduced for each galaxy and so a fair comparison of the relative mass of these galaxies is possible .",
    "also shown is the radius out to which cluster velocities have been measured .",
    "when using the pme to determine the mass of a distribution the mass determined is that enclosed by the most distant test particles .",
    "thus the mass quoted in the table is in fact the mass enclosed in the radius given for that galaxy .",
    "lclcccll ngc 1399 & e1/cd & -21.1 & @xmath7 & @xmath8 & 25 & @xmath9 & @xmath10 ngc 4486 & e0/cd & -22.4 & @xmath11 & @xmath12 & 18 & @xmath13 & @xmath14 ngc 4472 & e2 & -22.6 & @xmath15 & @xmath16 & 18 & @xmath17 & @xmath18 ngc 4594 & sa & -22.3 & @xmath19 & @xmath20 & 14 & @xmath21 & @xmath22 ngc 3115 & s0 & -21.45 & @xmath23 & @xmath24 & 19 & @xmath25 & @xmath26 ngc 3031 & sab & -21.2 & @xmath27 & @xmath28 & 20 & @xmath29 & @xmath30 m31 & sb & -21.7 & @xmath31 & @xmath32 & 20 & @xmath33 & @xmath34    as shown in table  [ table : mass ] the mass - to - light ratios of these various galaxies are not constant .",
    "in fact the immediate indication is that galaxies with high values of @xmath0 are also those with high values of @xmath35 .",
    "this begs the question of the mass - specific frequency . defining a mass - specific frequency as the ratio of a galaxies cluster population interior to some radius , @xmath36 , to the mass of the galaxy within that radius provides the relation , @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the total cluster population interior to some radius @xmath36 and @xmath39 is the mass interior to that radius , as determined via the pme .",
    "the normalization factor ( @xmath40 ) is the mean mass of the milky way gcs assuming @xmath41 .",
    "this definition is different from previous ones which relied on a constant value of @xmath35 for a given galaxy type .",
    "the values of @xmath42 are listed in column 6 of table  [ table : mass ] and the relation between parent galaxy luminosity and @xmath42 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mass ] .",
    "clearly there is now no correlation between galaxy luminosity and cluster population and no obvious difference between the relative populations of spirals , ellipticals and cd galaxies , even those previously seen as super - abundant can now be reconciled by a single value of cluster formation efficiency .    the cause of the anomalous @xmath0 values of some cd galaxies and the difference between @xmath0 of spirals and that of ellipticals must lie in the stellar population . already in the literature",
    "there are some suggestions to this explanation of the @xmath0 values @xcite .",
    "as the efficiency of cluster formation appears to be universal then it must be the star formation efficiency which varies . if the early burst of star formation results in a galactic wind shortly after the clusters formed but while there was still considerable gas left @xcite then a high @xmath0 system could result , leaving the expelled x - ray gas in the galaxy s halo . here",
    "the obvious discriminator between high @xmath0 and low @xmath0 systems is the rate and density of cluster formation and not its efficiency . at the time of formation of the gcs the super giant molecular clouds ( postulated to be the progenitor objcts of gcs @xcite )",
    "would provide sheilding against the uv radiation of the first generation of star formation , gas ejected from the progenator would , however , find itself photo - ionized and unable to cool and form stars .",
    "accepting the preceding as true results in an implication regarding the star formation rate of a galaxy .",
    "those galaxies with low values of @xmath0 are either more efficient at forming stars than their high mass cousins or the initial mass function of star formation in dense galaxies is tilted towards a preference for very massive stars early in that galaxies history .",
    "although this first round of massive objects still contribute their mass they no longer contribute to the luminosity of the galaxy .",
    "in addition the universal efficiency of cluster formation implies that cluster formation occurs very early in the galaxy formation process , prior to the type of galaxy which will form having any chance to influence the number of cluster which it will posses .",
    "the notion that a stellar wind might drive gas away from giant e galaxies could actually be the factor which eventually determines the type of galaxy which will form .",
    "those galaxies with lower densities of initial cluster formation can have their proto - galactic chunks dissipationally settle into a disk while those which form in dense regions with large numbers of clusters and a strong galactic wind will not manage to drag enough gas down into a plane in order that a disk might form .",
    "as stated in the introduction the universality of the gclf is paradoxical when compared to @xmath0 , however when compared to @xmath42 the paradox is removed .",
    "the correlation of galaxy mass with total population implies that the majority of clusters form prior to the determination of the final galaxy type . during this epoch",
    "the potential well of the proto - galaxy is likely to be much softer and the destruction of gcs via tidal stripping and evaporation is likely to dominate other modes of destruction .",
    "further these modes are mostly dependent on the mass of clusters formed and so the proportion destroyed is likely to be constant among different proto - galaxies .",
    "the early epoch of cluster formation , when clouds massive enough to eventually form clusters are present , occurs with uniform efficiency in all the environments studied to date .",
    "further measures of the mass distribution about galaxies of various types , sizes and stages of evolution should solidify this result .",
    "* globular clusters are create with an efficiency which is independent of galaxy type and enviroment .",
    "* given the correlation between cluster numbers and mass and the run of @xmath0 with galaxy type : elliptical galaxies are less efficient at producing stars than are spirals ."
