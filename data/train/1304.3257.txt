    "<S> note that the results obtained so far are based on a 1d harmonic quantm well for a single nanowire quantum dot . </S>",
    "<S> usually , the real well may include some anharmonicity and the nanowire is quasi-1d . in this case </S>",

    "<S> here we emphasize that for a nanowire quantum dot with strong soc , the electron spin in the dot becomes a pseudospin ( a spin - orbit qubit ) . because the current through the dot depends on the states of the spin - orbit qubit </S>",
    "<S> , the flipping of this pseudospin can also be monitored by either the current through the dot  @xcite or a nearby quantum point contact  @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> , we can determine the soc strength @xmath28 from the minimal amplitude @xmath108 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , by monitoring how the level splitting @xmath16 and the rabi frequency @xmath86 vary with the direction @xmath94 of @xmath11 , we can determine the parameter @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the level spacing @xmath16 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ level spacing ] ) reaches its maximum values at @xmath109 ( @xmath110 ) [ see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_response](a ) ] , and the rabi frequency @xmath86 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ rabi ] ) reaches its maximum values at @xmath111 ( @xmath112 ) [ see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_response](b ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> thus , @xmath19 can be determined from the values of @xmath113 . to obtain @xmath114 , and @xmath115 , where @xmath116 </S>",
    "<S> , we should know the orbit - level spacing @xmath32 . actually , @xmath32 is controlled by the gate voltages on the static electric gates which are used to form the trap potential @xmath117 . </S>",
    "<S> we take a recent experiment as an example . by comparing fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_response](a ) with fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2(c ) in @xcite , we obtain @xmath118 and @xmath119 at @xmath120 from the experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we have @xmath121 and @xmath122 ( @xmath123 ) for the nanowire material . </S>",
    "<S> also , this value of @xmath121 reveals that the nanowire material used in @xcite has a strong soc .    _ discussions and conclusions_.the edsr that we considered is only induced by the soc in the quantum dot . actually , the hyperfine interaction between the electron spin and the lattice nuclear spins in the dot can also induce interesting phenomena such as hyperfine - mediated edsr  @xcite and the spin - resonance locking  @xcite . in some materials , </S>",
    "<S> the electron @xmath124 factor may have strong anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> when the static magnetic field rotates , this strong anisotropy might also give rise to appreciable directional oscillations of the level spacing @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> however , it does not yield directional oscillations to the rabi frequency because @xmath124 is not included in @xmath86 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , one can use the rabi frequency to demonstrate the directional oscillations induced by the soc . as to directly showing the soc - induced directional oscillations in @xmath16 , one can use materials with a weak anisotropy in the @xmath125 factor .    in conclusion , we have theoretically investigated the edsr effect in a semiconductor nanowire quantum dot with strong soc . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the previous theories developed in the weak - soc regime , our results demonstrate that there is an optimal soc strength @xmath0 where the rabi frequency induced by the external ac electric field is maximal . also , we show that both the level spacing and the rabi frequency of the spin - orbit qubit have periodic responses to the direction of the external static magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> these responses can be used to probe the soc in the nanowire by determining both the rashba and the dresselhaus soc strengths in the material .    </S>",
