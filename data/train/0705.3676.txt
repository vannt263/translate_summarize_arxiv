    "the direct method for constructing integrable time - reversible mechanical systems was initiated by bertrand in his papers @xcite and @xcite . in the first one he posed and partially solved the problem of finding forces that should act on a particle in the plane from the knowledge of an additional integral of motion of a prescribed form . in the second paper bert bertrand formulated the problem of finding forces acting on a particle in the plane so that the lagrangian @xmath0admits a first integral of a prescribed form .",
    "he obtained the equations satisfied by the coefficients of an integral , polynomial or rational ( linear to linear ) in the velocities and the components of force acting on the system and succeeded to solve them in certain partial cases .",
    "for the case of quadratic integral , bertrand obtained the necessary and sufficient condition is that @xmath1 satisfies the partial differential equation@xmath2v_{xy }   \\nonumber \\\\ & & + 3(2ay+b)v_{x}-3(2ax+b^{\\prime } ) v_{y }   \\nonumber \\\\ & = & 0   \\label{brte}\\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath3 are constants .",
    "darboux @xcite gave the generic solution of this equation for the potential in the form @xmath4where @xmath5 are arbitrary functions and @xmath6 are the parameters of confocal ellipses and hyperbolas in the plane .",
    "the cases of degeneracy of elliptic coordinates to parabolic , polar and cartesian coordinates were considered in complete form only recently @xcite .",
    "the last cases were also rediscovered more than once in later times @xcite , @xcite @xcite . the same result was drawn from different points of view in @xcite , where some complex cases were pointed out ( see also hiet for complete description of possible real and complex cases ) and puc , which applied differential geometric concepts to the iso - energetic jacobi metric .",
    "it turns out that namely in those four cases the hamilton - jacobi equation of the system ( [ brt ] ) is separable @xcite , @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .    in the present paper we deal with a significant generalization of the system of ( [ brt ] ) , described by the lagrangian@xmath7",
    "in which @xmath8 depend only on the coordinates @xmath9 .",
    "this system differs from ( [ brt ] ) in two important aspects :    1 .",
    "it accommodates riemannian two - dimensional manifolds as possible configuration spaces .",
    "this allows application to various problems in dynamics involving motion of a rigid body about a fixed point and motion of a particle on a fixed smooth curved surface .",
    "the terms linear in velocities account for gyroscopic forces .",
    "those are forces that do not do work during motion of the system .",
    "they appear naturally in gyroscopic systems as a result of ignoring cyclic coordinates by the routh procedure .",
    "linear terms may arise also when the system has some charged components moving in a stationary magnetic field . in this context",
    "the vector @xmath10 may be called `` vector potential '' while @xmath1 is the scalar potential .",
    "the system ( [ 0 ] ) is usually called a system with velocity - dependent potential . for other circumstances",
    "see @xcite .",
    "birkhoff @xcite raised and completely solved the problem of constructing systems of the type ( [ 0 ] ) , which admit an integral linear in velocities in addition to the jacobi integral ( the hamiltonian of the system ) .",
    "the first cases of irreversible systems in the euclidean plane , having an integral quadratic in velocities were obtained by vandervoort van and by dorizzi et al @xcite .",
    "the first systematic study of the full irreversible system of type ( [ 0 ] ) for existence of a quadratic integral was done in our work @xcite , where possible integrable systems were classified according to whether the normal form of the metric has the euclidean form , the form of a metric on a surface of revolution or a generic liouville form .",
    "several new many - parameter families of systems were found .",
    "most of the known systems of the same type were either recovered or shown to be special cases of the new systems , corresponding to certain particular values of the parameters .",
    "some main systems were written down explicitly , but many others were only briefly pointed out .",
    "some cases of integrable motions in the plane generalizing the special plane versions of @xcite were presented in @xcite .",
    "cases of irreversible motion on a sphere corresponding to integrable problems due to clebsch and lyapunov in rigid body dynamics were obtained in @xcite . a case of irreversible motion of a particle on a smooth ellipsoid corresponding to clebch",
    "s case of asymmetric body in a liquid was also obtained in @xcite . in the last two works",
    "the lagrangian for each motion was expressed in redundant cartesian coordinates on the surface .",
    "they can be simply reduced to the form ( [ 0 ] ) by using sphero - conic coordinates on the sphere and elliptic coordinates on the ellipsoid .    after the publication of @xcite few works appeared dealing with the same problem , but mainly investigating the case of euclidean plane . a nearly complete list is composed of the following papers : @xcite , stew ( devoted to motion of a particle in a rotating plane ) and mcsw - win , @xcite , @xcite dealing with particles moving in the plane under the action of potential and `` forces with vector potential '' or `` velocity - dependent '' forces .",
    "only two works considered irreversible motions on curved manifolds : @xcite from the point of view of separation of variables and @xcite in which a classification of possible cases on riemannian manifolds is tried , but most of the results are very special cases of those presented in @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to make the most exhaustive enumeration of irreversible mechanical systems , which have an invariant quadratic in velocities and functionally independent of the hamiltonian of the system .",
    "we have constructed a total of 41 different several - parameter families of those systems .",
    "some of those families or their special cases or degenerations were listed in our previous works but the majority are listed for the first time .",
    "we give briefly the very essential moments in the different methods used in the derivation of the families and then provide for every family the minimal information enough for its characterization .",
    "usually , we give the lagrangian an the second invariant and occasionally the gaussian curvature of the configuration space , which we use for interpretation of suitable results as cases of motion on a plane or a space of constant curvature . the last section is devoted to application in the two model problems of motion of a rigid body under various circumstances and of motion of a particle under potential forces on a smooth fixed ellipsoid .",
    "it is well known that the system ( [ 0 ] ) can always be referred to some isometric coordinates @xmath11 ( say ) , in which the lagrangian takes the form@xmath12containing one coefficient in the kinetic energy term , instead of three in ( [ 0 ] ) .",
    "the pair of coefficients @xmath13 are not unique for a given system , since one can add the time derivative of an arbitrary function of the position to the lagrangian .",
    "the lagrangian -more precisely , the lagrangian equations of motion- is thus characterized by the triplet of functions @xmath14 where @xmath15    the system ( [ 1 ] ) transforms under conformal mapping @xmath16to@xmath17where @xmath18 the last system admits the jacobi integral of motion ( the hamiltonian expressed in the state variables ) @xmath19    suppose that the system ( [ 1 ] ) admits an integral of general quadratic form@xmath20    in our previous work @xcite we have shown that for a system of the type under consideration one can always find a conformal mapping of the plane and a time transformation of the type @xmath21such that the lagrangian , jacobi s integral and the complementary quadratic integral take , with the proper use of ( [ 4 ] ) , the form @xcite :    @xmath22    where primes denote differentiation with respect to @xmath23    @xmath24    and @xmath25 satisfy the over - determined system of four equations    [ eq ] @xmath26(\\phi _ { \\xi } \\phi _ { \\eta } ) -(\\lambda v)_{\\xi \\eta } & = & 0 \\label{eq4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the equations of motion corresponding to the lagrangian ( [ lf ] ) acquire the simplest form    @xmath27    in the original ( natural ) time variable the lagrangian and integrals take the form    [ n ] @xmath28    in the last form of the integral ( [ ni ] ) the function @xmath29 may involve the energy - parameter ( more precisely , jacobi s parameter ) @xmath30 as a linear multiplier in certain terms .",
    "this is obvious from the way of construction .",
    "this parameter is interpreted as its numerical value on a given motion , or may be substituted by its expression as a function of the state variables from ( [ nj ] ) , resulting in an unconditional integral in the state space .",
    "the function @xmath31 the solution of equation ( [ eq1 ] ) completely characterizes the metric on the configuration space of the system ( [ nl ] ) .",
    "this gives a natural basis for a classification of all systems of the type under consideration , depending on whether @xmath32 has one of three possible forms :    \\1 ) the factor @xmath32 is a constant and , without loss of generality , one can set    @xmath33    in that case the configuration space has euclidean metric .",

    "separation of variables in this case is obvious .",
    "many cases of physical interest can be identified in the form of the liouville system ( [ ls ] ) .    if the original configuration space of ( [ 1 ] ) is the ordinary euclidean plane , then @xmath41 and we obtain a different and very compact formulation of the bertrand - darboux problem presented in the introduction .",
    "solutions of this problem are systems of the form ( [ ls ] ) with the function @xmath42 in the transformation ( [ 1a ] ) satisfying the equation    @xmath43it was shown in @xcite that this equation has the general solution @xmath44 in which @xmath45 is a non - negative constant and the arbitrary constants@xmath46 can be made real by a suitable choice of axes in the @xmath47plane .",
    "the generic case of two distinct roots defines the elliptic coordinates in the @xmath47plane , reproduces darboux s result .",
    "the degenerate cases of two equal roots or with one or both roots coalescing with the point at infinity define the polar , parabolic and cartesian coordinates in the plane .",

    "the explicit form of the integral in the euler - poisson variables is@xmath175this can be verified by direct calculation .",
    "this result was obtained in yint86 and independently in equivalent form in @xcite . in @xcite an infinite sequence of potentials @xmath176",
    "that admit quadratic integral , using symbolic computation was found . it can be easily shown that this sequence corresponds to the choices @xmath177 this is exactly a case discussed explicitly in @xcite . moreover , if in ( [ v0 ] ) we take @xmath178 as a full power series we obtain the potential @xmath179admitting the quadratic integral .",
    "this could be expected from the separation property overlooked in @xcite .",
    "it should be mentioned here that the authors of @xcite have also argued that the sequence they obtained is different from another one , obtained earlier by wojciechovski in 1985 woj .",
    "however , the latter sequence as provided in @xcite is not separable for the tri - axial rigid body and is inconsistent with the existence of a quadratic integral for rigid body dynamics .",
    "some mechanical systems do not have much importance in their own as much as in other problems related to them , for which they serve as geometrization .",
    "a typical example of a useful model in mechanics is the problem of motion on a smooth fixed surface .",
    "the motion on a sphere is used for modeling motion of a rigid body @xcite , in the study of b - phase of the superfluid @xmath180 , in the construction of certain wave solutions of the landau - lifshitz non - linear equation ( e.g. @xcite ) and in the treatment of dyson s fluid dynamical model of spinning gas clouds maintaining ellipsoidal shape @xcite .",
    "recently , the motion of a particle on a smooth tilted cone was found to be a generalization covering the problem of motion of the swinging atwood machine as a special case ycone .",
    "the ellipsoid is one of the favorite models .",
    "it is closely related to the dynamics of rigid bodies .",
    "let a particle of unit mass be moving on the ellipsoid@xmath181under the action of forces with potential @xmath1 and vector potential @xmath182 .",
    "the lagrangian for this problem is@xmath183we shall only express @xmath184 in terms of elliptic coordinates @xmath185 on the ellipsoid@xmath186\\]]here the functions @xmath77 and @xmath78 are rational ( cubic to linear ) .",
    "one can immediately notice that case i ( [ i ] ) , in which @xmath77 is rational ( degree 6 to one ) gives a case of motion on the ellipsoid if coefficients are suitably adapted .",
    "this case was found earlier in our work @xcite by a different method .      using hamilton s principle in the form of jacobi ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite )",
    ", one can derive the equations of the trajectories of motion of the system described by the lagrangian ( [ nl ] ) from the variational problem @xmath187this means those trajectories are geodesics of the randers metric @xmath188    randers metrics were first studied by physicist , g.randers @xcite from the stand point of general relativity .",
    "since then , many geometers have made efforts in investigating the geometric properties of randers metrics as an important and rich class of finsler metrics and to explore their prospective applications ( see e.g. @xcite - @xcite ) .",
    "every integrable mechanical system of the type ( [ n ] ) corresponds to an integrable geodesic flow of the randers metric ( [ rm ] ) admitting the integral @xmath189 in which @xmath190      stochastic dynamical models described by fokker - planck equations , in the limit of weak noise , can be formally associated with hamiltonian dynamical systems .",
    "the hamiltonian consists of a kinetic energy quadratic term and terms linear in momenta , with zero scalar potential term ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the study of such hamiltonian systems has received some attention from both points of view of integrability @xcite - @xcite and existence of invariant relations @xcite .",
    "gauge transformation of the lagrangian was also used by hietarinta hiet1 to construct integrable fokker - plank equations from known integrable hamiltonian systems . the hamiltonian function corresponding to the lagrangian ( [ nl ] ) , with a gauge term @xmath191 , has the form@xmath192 + v=0\\]]where @xmath193 are the momenta conjugate to the coordinates @xmath194 respectively .  an integrable system ( [ n ] ) generates a fokker - plank system if there exists a function @xmath195 satisfying @xmath196 + v=0\\]]the results we obtained for this problem are promising and will be presented elsewhere .",
    "so far , we have made the most comprehensive analysis of the problem of constructing 2d conservative lagrangian systems involving terms linear in the velocities , which admit a complementary quadratic integral .",
    "the problem under consideration has proved unexpectedly rich .",
    "we have constructed and tabulated 41 major several - parameter families of integrable systems of this type . in most cases",
    "the parametrization of the system can be chosen , usually in more than one way , so that the configuration manifold becomes riemannian or pseudo - riemannian .",
    "the remaining few cases are real only on pseudo - riemannian manifolds .",
    "some of those families or their special cases or degenerations were listed in our previous works but the majority are either listed for the first time or involve more parameters in their structure . usually , we give the lagrangian and the second invariant and occasionally the gaussian curvature of the configuration space , which we use for interpretation of simple results as cases of motion on a plane or a space of constant curvature . in application to the problem of motion of a rigid body under various circumstances ,",
    "all known integrable cases of the type under consideration for this problem are restored and a new one is added . a systematic analysis of the results of this paper is still needed to isolate all possible subcases , which admit a preassigned physical or mechanical interpretation .",
    "many of them are tentatively candidates for the study of motion of a charged particle under the action of spatially periodic electric and magnetic fields on various 2d spaces .",
    "it is worthy to say few words about the methods we used throughout the paper , in order to make clear their limitations .",
    "the difficulty in solving the problem stems from the fact that we deal with a linear pde ( [ re1 ] ) for @xmath197 coupled with a differential condition involving nonlinearly the same function @xmath143 and linearly three functions of a single variable each @xmath198 this system is so involved that we may not be able to tell at present how far we are from its general solution . as we see from the last sections , @xmath77 and @xmath78 turned out to be rational in one case and polynomial of degree less than six in all others .",
    "we see from tables 4 and 5 how the degree of @xmath199 is interlinked with the number of terms taken from the sequence of functions @xmath200 it seems unlikely that @xmath77 can be a polynomial of degree six or higher .",
    "however , we are working on few cases in which @xmath93 are algebraic functions . using certain uniformizing transformations",
    ", one can reduce @xmath93 to polynomial form , but this changes the form of the metric coefficient @xmath201 this will be pursued elsewhere .    in the more compact case considered in [ fp ] ,",
    "we deal with simultaneous solutions of the linear pde ( [ re1 ] ) and the nonlinear one ( [ pse ] ) in the same unknown function @xmath86 it is unlikely that those equations admit other solutions than the list of table ii .",
    "however , we have no proof yet that no other solutions exist , for example , as full infinite series of @xmath200        bertrand , j. _ mmoire sur quelques - unes des formes les plus simples que puissent prsenter les intgrales des quations diffrentielles du mouvement dun point matriel_. j. math .",
