    "the interaction between the two components of the dark sector of the universe is not only allowed by einstein s equations but also leads to interesting scenarios for both the primordial and late - time phases of the expansion @xcite . in this letter",
    "we review three of these scenarios and show that they are particular cases of a general expression for the energy flux from vacuum to the matter sector . in the first of them",
    ", the vacuum - matter interaction leads to a transition from an unstable de sitter phase to a radiation dominated universe , avoiding in this way the initial singularity . in the second case ,",
    "the interaction gives rise to an inflationary expansion without inflaton , with desired features of standard inflationary models .",
    "finally , the third scenario is a concordance model for the late - time universe , with the vacuum term decaying into cold dark matter . in the three cases we identify the physics behind these particular forms of interaction .",
    "we also show that they can be interpreted as three particular types of the modified chaplygin gas .",
    "let us consider a flrw space - time with two energy components , namely a vacuum term with equation of state @xmath0 and a matter component with equation of state @xmath1 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) are the corresponding energy densities and pressures , respectively .",
    "the friedmann equations are given by @xmath5 @xmath6 where the dot means derivative with respect to the cosmological time @xmath7 , and @xmath8 is the hubble parameter . introducing the total energy density @xmath9 , redefining the time variable by @xmath10 , and choosing @xmath11 for the vacuum term , it is easy to obtain @xmath12 where the prime means derivative with respect to @xmath13 . on the other hand ,",
    "derivating ( [ friedmann ] ) with respect to time we can derive @xmath14    the interaction between the two components can be introduced by splitting the conservation equation ( [ conservation2 ] ) into @xmath15 @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a generic expression of the energy flux , which is negative if the flux is from vacuum to matter . multiplying ( [ matter ] ) by @xmath18 and using ( [ conservation2 ] ) we have @xmath19 assuming that @xmath20",
    ", we then have a second - order equation for @xmath21 , which determines the dynamics for a given @xmath17 .",
    "let us first take @xmath22 the source equation ( [ general ] ) is integrated to give @xmath23 where @xmath24 is an integration constant which will be taken as zero . if we now write @xmath25 and use ( [ conservation2 ] ) and ( [ case1 ] ) , we obtain @xmath26 on the other hand , from ( [ h ] ) and ( [ case1 ] ) we have , by doing @xmath27 ( i.e. @xmath28 ) , the evolution equation @xmath29    equations ( [ h4 ] ) and ( [ evolution ] ) are noteworthy .",
    "the former is the expected contribution of free conformal fields to vacuum density in de sitter space - time .",
    "it is valid in particular in the high energy limit , when field interactions and masses can be neglected .",
    "since in de sitter background we have @xmath30 , equation ( [ h4 ] ) leads to @xmath31 , that is , we are dealing with a planck - scale solution ) by a constant factor , the scale changes by the same factor .",
    "nevertheless , the behavior of our solution is not altered , except for a simple re - scaling of time . ] .",
    "equation ( [ evolution ] ) , on the other hand , has two possible solutions .",
    "the first is simply @xmath31 , which is an ethernal de sitter universe .",
    "however , this solution is unstable , which is clear because of the existence of a second solution for ( [ evolution ] ) , namely @xcite @xmath32 where a constant of integration was conveniently chosen .",
    "this solution is depicted in fig .",
    "it describes a phase transition from an initial , semi - ethernal de sitter phase to a radiation dominated universe , during which the vacuum term decays into relativistic matter .",
    "this result can also be seen from the solution of eq .",
    "( [ case1 ] ) for @xmath33 , the branch of which , defined for any value of the energy density , is given by @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a positive integration constant .",
    "the particular solution obtained for @xmath36 gives rise to the unstable de sitter solution @xmath37 , which in turns decays into relativistic matter with @xmath38 .",
    "when this solution departures significantly from de sitter , the vacuum density is not expected to be ( [ h4 ] ) any more , because the backreaction of the particle creation should also be taken into account .",
    "this leads us to our second case .",
    "the hubble parameter as a function of time for @xmath39",
    "let us now take @xmath40 where @xmath41 is a positive constante . from ( [ general ] ) we obtain @xmath42 where , as before , @xmath24 is an integration constant which can be made zero .",
    "since @xmath25 , we now have , by using again ( [ conservation2 ] ) and @xmath27 , @xmath43 now , with the help of ( [ q2 ] ) and ( [ conservation2 ] ) , equation ( [ matter ] ) can be rewritten in the form @xmath44 this equation shows that the vacuum scaling ( [ inflation ] ) corresponds to creation of relativistic particles at a rate @xmath45 .",
    "the solution of ( [ friedmann ] ) , ( [ inflation ] ) and ( [ boltzmann4 ] ) is given by @xcite @xmath46 where @xmath47 and an integration constant was conveniently chosen .",
    "for @xmath48 ( i.e. @xmath49 ) we have a slow - roll power - law inflationary solution .",
    "indeed , from ( [ inflation2 ] ) we can show that @xmath50 , that is , @xmath51 coincides with the first slow - roll parameter . as @xmath51 is constant ,",
    "the second slow - roll parameter is @xmath52 , the scalar spectral index is @xmath53 , and the tensor / scalar ratio is @xmath54 .",
    "assuming that inflation lasts for about @xmath55 e - folds , as required to solve the horizon problem , we have @xmath56 , leading to @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "finally , let us take @xmath59 where @xmath60 is a positive constant .",
    "the integration of ( [ general ] ) gives @xmath61 writing again @xmath25 , using ( [ conservation2 ] ) and ( [ case3 ] ) , choosing @xmath62 and taking @xmath63 ( i.e. @xmath64 ) , we have @xmath65 again , with the help of ( [ q3 ] ) and ( [ conservation2 ] ) , equation ( [ matter ] ) can be put in the form @xmath66 we see that , in this case , non - relativistic matter is created with a constant rate @xmath60 . dividing ( [ linear ] ) by @xmath67 , we have @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the relative matter density . by taking present values for @xmath70 and @xmath69 ( @xmath71 ) , we have @xmath72 .",
    "the system of equations ( [ friedmann ] ) , ( [ linear ] ) and ( [ boltzmann1 ] ) has a simple solution given by @xcite @xmath73^{2/3},\\ ] ] where @xmath74 is an integration constant .",
    "it reduces to the einstein - de sitter solution for early times , and tends to a de sitter universe in the asymptotic future .",
    "it has been shown in previous works that this solution presents good concordance when tested against current observations @xcite .",
    "the three cases above can be written in a unified form . indeed , by using the pairs ( [ q1])-([h4 ] ) , ( [ q2])-([inflation ] ) and ( [ q3])-([linear ] ) , we can write the energy flux as @xmath75 where @xmath76 in the first , second and latter cases , respectively . on the other hand , from ( [ friedmann ] ) and ( [ conservation2 ] )",
    "it is easy to show that @xmath77 substituting this result into ( [ q ] ) , we obtain @xmath78 this last equation has the general form of what has been called a homogeneous non - linear interaction in the dark sector @xcite .",
    "it is also noteworthy that in the three cases the dark sector can be described in a unified way as a modified chaplygin gas .",
    "indeed , equations ( [ h4 ] ) , ( [ inflation ] ) and ( [ linear ] ) can be put in the general form @xmath79 with @xmath80 defined as above . now , by using @xmath81 we can show that @xmath82 with @xmath83 . in the late - time case of non - relativistic dark matter ( @xmath63 ) ,",
    "the dark sector is described by a generalised chaplygin gas with negative @xmath80 @xcite , also named extended chaplygin gas @xcite ."
