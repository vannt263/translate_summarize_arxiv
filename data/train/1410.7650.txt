    "the protein folding problem has been around for a long time @xcite , with various incarnations @xcite .",
    "numerous proposals have been presented , to explain how the folding patterns emerge and advance .",
    "examples include nucleation - condensation @xcite , hydrophobic collapse @xcite and diffusion - collision controlled processes @xcite .",
    "more recently , a kink - based approach has been proposed @xcite and tested successfully using a coarse - grained force - field @xcite . at the same time",
    ", protein misfolding continues to be vigorously investigated @xcite .",
    "a misfolded protein can lead to serious complications , a misfolding transition is now widely accepted as the cause for diseases like type - ii diabetes , many forms of cancer , and dementia including alzheimer s @xcite .    in the present article",
    "we investigate the phenomenon of _ barrier penetration _ as an example of those physical mechanisms that contribute to protein folding and misfolding transitions . for this",
    "we inquire what happens when a protein loop fragment becomes displaced from its native position",
    ". how does it find its way back to the native position ?",
    "the understanding of the dynamical processes involved should contribute to our comprehension of protein folding , including the reasons why and how a misfolding transition takes place .    as a concrete example we consider an albumin - binding domain which is related to the protein g. this is a fairly generic @xmath1-helical protein , the native state involves three helices which are separated by two short loops ; we use the protein data bank ( pdb ) @xcite entry code 1gab .",
    "it consists of 53 amino acids , the first loop is located between sites 19 - 24 and the second loop is located between sites 33 - 37 .",
    "the reason for choosing 1gab as our concrete example is , that the unres force field , on which our investigations are based , has been optimised for this particular protein .    in our analysis of 1gab we first follow @xcite , to conclude that each of the two loops of 1gab are modeled by a single kink that solves a generalized discrete non - linear schrdinger equation @xcite .",
    "we then parallel translate the second loop in the pdb structure by five residues towards the first loop , with no change in the remaining residues .",
    "we release the loop so that it is free to move along the backbone .",
    "this instigates a process where the kink attempts to propagate back to its original posture .",
    "thus we have a prototype example of the peierls - nabarro scenario where a coherent and self - localized quasiparticle excitation propagates along a discrete one dimensional lattice @xcite .",
    "now realised in the case of the protein backbone .",
    "our analysis is based on the united residue ( unres ) force field @xcite .",
    "it is freely available at @xmath2 unres is a carefully grafted coarse - grained force field that can be utilized to simulate the time evolution of a displaced kink along the protein backbone , in a highly realistic manner .",
    "unres has a very strong predictive power @xcite .",
    "it has also been optimised to reproduce the correct thermodynamic properties , in a scenario like the one that will be studied here .",
    "moreover , unres has a proven track record of already successfully modelling the kink formation in an @xmath1-helical protein @xcite , like the one studied here . with the presently available computer power , a coarse - grain force - field such as unres",
    "enables us to produce numerous full - length trajectories to probe the dynamical details in terms of a statistical analysis , which we needed in particular when determining the temperature dependence of the peierls - nabarro barrier .",
    "we describe the skeletal c@xmath0 backbone lattice , using the geometrically determined frenet frames @xcite .",
    "these frames depends _ only _ on the position of the c@xmath0 carbons , with coordinates @xmath3 where @xmath4 labels the residues . at a given residue ,",
    "the orthonormal frenet frame consists of the backbone tangent ( @xmath5 ) , binormal ( @xmath6 ) , and normal ( @xmath7 ) vectors .",
    "these are defined by equations ( [ eq : t ] ) , ( [ eq : b ] ) , and ( [ eq : n ] ) , respectively , and shown in figure [ fig-1 ] .",
    "@xmath8    @xmath9    @xmath10    for _ trans_-peptide groups the distance between the consecutive c@xmath0 atoms is close to the constant value @xmath11 thus the backbone lattice becomes entirely described by virtual - bond - valence angles @xmath12 and virtual - bond - dihedral ( torsion ) angles @xmath13 ; see figure [ fig-2 ] .",
    "@xmath14     \\arccos ( \\mathbf   b_{i+1 } \\ !",
    "\\cdot \\mathbf b_i ) ~ \\label{eq : torsion}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "the frame vectors at site @xmath15 are expressed in terms of the frame vectors at site @xmath16 and the angles @xmath12 and @xmath13 using a transfer matrix , @xmath17 the c@xmath0 lattice is constructed as follows , @xmath18 the normal and binormal vectors ( @xmath19 ) are both absent in equation ( [ eq : dffe ] ) , only the tangent vector @xmath20 appears .",
    "therefore , if these two vectors are simultaneously rotated around the vector @xmath20 , they continue to constitute an equally good framing .",
    "in particular a frame rotation by @xmath21 determines the discrete @xmath22 transformation @xmath23 that leaves ( [ eq : dffe ] ) intact .",
    "this @xmath22 transformation has been used extensively to analyze proteins @xcite and will also be used here .      the virtual bond angles ( [ eq : bond ] ) and virtual torsion angles ( [ eq : torsion ] ) of the c@xmath0 backbone are mutually correlated , by the atomic level interactions along the protein chain .",
    "we may choose these angles as the order parameters , that characterise the thermodynamical state of the protein in terms of its geometric composition .",
    "in @xcite it has been shown that in the limit of slowly varying variables , the full all - atom thermodynamical free energy @xmath24 can be expanded in terms of these order parameters , in the universal sense of kadanoff and wilson @xcite , as follows : @xmath25 @xmath26 in equation ( [ e1old ] ) @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 depend on the atomic level physical properties and the chemical microstructure of the protein and its environment . in principle these parameters can be computed from this knowledge .    the kink that constitutes the elemental building block of a protein loop arises from ( [ e1old ] ) as follows : the angles @xmath32 are first determined as functions of the angles @xmath33 , @xmath34 \\ =   \\ \\frac{u } { 1 + v \\ , \\theta^2_{i } }   \\label{tauk}\\ ] ] with @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the equation ( [ tauk ] ) is inserted into equation ( [ e1old ] ) , to eliminate the @xmath32 in favor of the @xmath33 .",
    "this gives a set of equations ( [ nlse ] ) for the @xmath33 @xmath37}{d\\theta_i^2 } \\theta_i   \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ ( i=1, ... ,n ) \\label{nlse}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 and @xmath39   =   - \\ \\frac{u^2r}{2(1 + v \\ , \\theta^2 ) } - 2\\lambda m^2   \\theta^2 + \\lambda \\ , \\theta^4 \\label{u}\\ ] ] here we recognize the structure of a generalized discrete non - linear schrdinger ( dnls ) equation @xcite in the case of proteins , @xmath40 is small and @xmath41 so that there are two local minima in @xmath42 $ ] , with @xmath43 .",
    "the kink is a solution of ( [ nlse ] ) , ( [ tauk ] ) that interpolates between the two minima .",
    "the explicit form of the kink is not known to us , in terms of elementary functions .",
    "but it can be constructed numerically by following the iterative procedure of ref .",
    "note that a ground state configuration where @xmath33 is constant with @xmath44 describes a right - handed @xmath1-helix , while @xmath45 describes a @xmath46-strand . for a kink , the ( @xmath47 ) profile interpolates with these regular secondary structures .    for a given protein structure , we train the energy function ( [ e1old ] ) to describe the backbone geometry in terms of a multi - kink solution of ( [ nlse ] ) , ( [ tauk ] ) .",
    "for this we use the packages _ propro _ and _ gaugeit _ , described at @xmath48 in the case of 1gab , we use the averaged nmr structure .    in figures [ fig-3 ]",
    "we describe the profile of the second loop along the 1gab backbone , averaged over all nmr structures in pdb . in the figure [ fig-3 ] ( left )",
    "we have implemented the @xmath22 transformation ( [ eq : dsgau ] ) .",
    "it reveals that the loop is a single kink , that appears as a domain wall between two @xmath1-helical structures .      in a protein ,",
    "a loop propagation instigates a structural deformation . in crystallographic protein structures",
    "the loops are located at definite positions along the backbone chain .",
    "thus , in the case of a static , crystallographic protein the translation invariance of the kink along the c@xmath0 lattice is clearly broken .",
    "the breakdown of translation invariance in the case of a lattice kink is in fact generic : whenever a self - localized quasiparticle excitation such as a kink moves along the lattice , waves are emitted in its wake as vibrations in the lattice structure .",
    "these waves drain the kinetic energy of the quasiparticle excitation , causing it to decelerate .",
    "eventually the kinetic energy becomes depleted to the extent that the excitation can no longer cross over the energy barriers between lattice cells , and instead it becomes localizes to a particular lattice cell .",
    "normally , a localized quasiparticle excitation has only two stationary positions relative to the lattice structure .",
    "moreover , in a simple model these energy extrema are often positioned symmetrically , either at a lattice site or half - way between two neighboring lattice sites .",
    "one of the stationary positions is a local minimum of the potential energy , while the other is a saddle point .",
    "the energy difference between these two configurations determines the basal kinetic energy that the quasiparticle excitation needs , in order to translate itself from one lattice cell to another .",
    "this minimum energy difference is called the _ peierls - nabarro barrier _ ( pnb ) of the excitation @xcite .",
    "we use the unres force field ( [ unres ] ) in combination with the molecular dynamics ( md ) protocol described in @xcite .",
    "the initial condition for our simulations is the pdb structure 1gab , where we have parallel transported the second loop fragment ala@xmath49-val@xmath50 to the position of gln@xmath51-gln@xmath52 .",
    "figure [ fig-4 ]    compares the initial configuration with the crystallographic 1gab structure .",
    "note that the ( @xmath47 ) spectrum remains intact during the parallel transport , except for the uniform loop translation .",
    "the ensuing c@xmath0 configuration is converted into an all - atom structure using a combination of pulchra @xcite and scwrl4 @xcite . our choice to translate the loop fragment by five residues follows from an inspection of the all - atom steric hindrances that are incurred during the translation process .",
    "we have simulated a total of 704 canonical molecular dynamics trajectories , at 11 different temperature values from 270k to 320k by steps of 5k .",
    "thus there are 64 trajectories , at each temperature value .",
    "each trajectory consists of 10 million iterations , with unres time step value 4.89 fs .",
    "since the very fast atomic level motions are averaged by the unres force field , the corresponding _ in vivo _ time is around @xmath53 50 @xmath54s @xcite .      during the simulations we monitor the evolution of the ( @xmath55 ) angles defined in ( [ eq : bond ] ) and ( [ eq : torsion ] ) , and the side - chain c@xmath56c@xmath56 torsional angles which we denote by @xmath57 ( schematically shown in the figure [ fig-5 ] ) .",
    "for this , the c@xmath56 positions are calculated by converting the coarse - grained unres trajectories into all - atom trajectories using an optimal dipole aligment algorithm developed in @xcite .",
    "we choose the 10@xmath58 residue along the 1gab backbone as a reference point : we have observed that it remain highly inert throughout our simulations . in particular , this residue does not seem to be affected by the kink propagation which we instigate . starting with this reference site , we combine the side - chain c@xmath56c@xmath56 torsional angles @xmath57 into the following accumulated _ total _ side - chain torsion angle @xmath59 , @xmath60 during the simulations , we also monitor two quantitative criteria to assess whether the displaced kink has reached its native location .",
    "one of the criteria is the rmsd between the simulated structure and the pdb structure 1gab .",
    "following @xcite , we demand that for a native state , the rmsd should be less than 4 .",
    "the second criteria is based on the ( @xmath47 ) profile of the kink , as shown in figures [ fig-3 ] .",
    "we demand that at the end , the kink is located within one lattice site from the native location between ala@xmath49-val@xmath50 .",
    "finally , to estimate the height of the peierls - nabarro barrier , we evaluate the energy of the fragment gln@xmath51-val@xmath50 using the unres energy function .",
    "according to @xcite , when the 1gab folding is simulated at around 295k using unres force field with replica - exchange molecular dynamics , over 90% of structures reach the native state .",
    "however , in our unres simulations , using canonical molecular dynamics and _ with our initial condition _ where the second loop fragment has been parallel translated by five residues towards the first and then released at rest , we find that at 295k temperature only around 25 per cent of structures reach the native state . in figure [ fig-6 ]",
    "we show the probability for our initial configuration to reach the native state , as a function of temperature .",
    "the probability has a maximum at around 295k .",
    "we find that at low temperatures , well below 295 k , the peierls - nabarro energy barrier becomes too high for the kink to leap over it , only by the thermally induced kinetic energy .",
    "when the temperature increases and the amplitude of thermal fluctuations in the kink is larger , the barrier crossing becomes more and more frequent .",
    "but when temperature reaches values which are well above 295 k , the unfolding processes which are driven by increased thermal fluctuations in the protein lattice structure start becoming increasingly prominent and eventually the protein unfolds .",
    "we also find that at temperatures well below 295 k , when the peierls - nabarro energy barrier becomes too high for the kink to cross over , the most frequently occurring pathway entails a disintegration of the kink ; see figure [ fig-7 ] .    along this pathway , the parallel transported loop misfolds into a helical shape , and at the end we have a helix - bend - helix configuration akin the one shown in figure [ fig-8 ] .",
    "we find that the energy barrier for this transition is quite low , as shown in figure [ fig-9 ] .",
    "it should be noted that in our simulations each trajectory describes kink propagation in a somewhat different manner , no two trajectories are fully identical .",
    "there are also trajectories with kink - kink interactions .",
    "only the general aspects of the most commonly occurring pathways are detailed in the sequel .",
    "the kink propagation commences with a process of tension reduction : in the initial stage , the first and third helix are aligned in parallel , next to each other .",
    "interactions between the ensuing side chains are present , causing a tension which hinders the propagation of the parallel transported kink .",
    "this tension becomes relaxed by a deformation that orients the first and third helix perpendicular to each other ( see figure [ fig-10 ] ) .",
    "this lowers the peierls - nabarro barrier , enabling the kink to start propagating .",
    "subsequently , we observe that the kink propagates along the chain by _ reptation _ : there is an initial prolongation of the kink structure , an example is shown in figure [ fig-11 ] .    in this particular example",
    "the kink extends from residue 30 to residues 36 - 38 , during the unres time period between @xmath61 1000 and @xmath61 3200 .",
    "the prolongated kink corresponds to an extended loop region , which is shown in figure [ fig-12 ] ; we also note that the third helix is perpendicular to both the first and the second helix .",
    "this enhances the conformational flexibility of the loop fragment which enables an increase in the accumulation of thermally induced kinetic energy , boosting the kink to more easily cross over the energy barriers towards the final position . in the final stage",
    "the third helix then returns to a posture where it is ( anti)parallel to the other two helices , and the kink assumes its native location .      the kink propagation is strongly correlated with the side - chain motions , as seen in the frenet frames . for this , we first analyze the c@xmath56c@xmath56 torsional angles @xmath57 .",
    "the initial values of these angles , for the parallel transported kink , are shown in column a of figure [ fig-13 ] .",
    "this figure shows that the value of @xmath57 along a helical structure is @xmath620.8 radians whereas along the kink the @xmath57 deviate from this helical value . in figure [ fig-13 ] column b we observe how the values of @xmath57 remain largely intact during the initial phase , that of tension reduction , when the relative positions of the helices along the chain do not change .    during the second stage ,",
    "that of reptation when the kink becomes prolongated , corresponding to the columns c and d in figure [ fig-13 ] , the values of the @xmath57 angle deviate from the helical value @xmath630.8 radians , over an expanded range .",
    "there is a clear counter - clockwise relative rotation of the side - chains along the chain , correlating with the prolongation of the reptating kink along the chain .    in the final stage ,",
    "as the third helix assumes its ( anti)parallel orientation with the first and second helices , the length of the reptating kink becomes contracted into a region that extends over the residues 35 - 37 as the kink moves to its native position .",
    "this can be seen in column e and f of figure [ fig-13 ] .",
    "additional structure can be identified in terms of the accumulated total torsion angles @xmath64 , that we introduced in equation ( [ eq : etaprime ] ) : unlike the c@xmath56c@xmath56 torsional angles @xmath57 which are defined locally , the total angles @xmath59 contain both local and global information . in figure [ fig-14 ]    we show the values of @xmath65 that correspond to the values of @xmath57 in figure [ fig-13 ] .",
    "for example , compare the first row ( residue 30 ) in figures [ fig-13 ] and [ fig-14 ] : in figure [ fig-13 ] there is no change , but in colums a - c of row 1 in figure [ fig-14 ] we see a substantial counter - clockwise rotation .",
    "thus , we conclude that the kink propagation correlates with a global helical counter - clockwise rotation of the side - chains , that occurs prior to the position of the propagating kink .",
    "note that in both figures [ fig-13 ] and [ fig-14 ] there is no relative side - chain rotation visible between the two last columns .",
    "the value of @xmath66 ( angle between reside 36 and 37 ) remains essentially constant throughout our simulations .",
    "this orientational locking of the two side - chains with each other reflects a strong repelling interaction between the two lysines which are located at sites 35 and 37 .",
    "this makes the two residues 36 and 37 to rotate in tandem .",
    "we have monitored the change of local energy associated with the kink propagation ; see figure [ fig-15 ] .",
    "we observe that the difference in the energy which is localized at the initial parallel transported kink , and the energy which is localized at the final natively placed kink , is very small .",
    "our estimate for the energy difference between the two kinks is around 1 - 2 kcal / mol .",
    "however , the energy barrier that the parallel transported kink needs to cross over in order to reach is native location , is much higher . from figure [ fig-15 ]",
    "we estimate that the height of the peierls - nabarro barrier is around 4 - 6 kcal / mol .",
    "this estimate is comparable , albeit sligtly lower than the result obtained in @xcite .",
    "it appears that the major contribution towards the height of the barrier correlates with the elongation of the kink , during reptation .",
    "in this article we have analysed the propagation of a kink along protein backbone .",
    "the process is much more complex than a simple translation , it involves both local and global deformations . in particular , the peierls - nabarro barrier crossing involves a reptation - like movement , with the kink propagating by a combination of prolongations and contractions , and with a very sudden character .",
    "we note that this is in line with the analysis of soliton propagation along a cyclic molecular chain @xcite .",
    "we have estimated the height of the ensuing peierls - nabarro barrier to be around 4 - 6 kcal / mol , in the case of the second loop of 1gab .",
    "we observe that this is remarkably close to the energy gap in atp to adp hydrolysis process .",
    "it appears that the present study is the first to address the relevance of peiers - nabarro barrier to protein folding .",
    "moreover , we have only considered a particular example .",
    "however , most protein loops can be described in terms of different parametrizations of the kink solution which is supported by ( [ nlse ] ) , ( [ tauk ] ) .",
    "thus we trust that the phenomenon we have revealed is not limited to the specific example , but relates to a general mechanism how proteins fold and unfold .",
    "finally , we note that for a detailed investigation of loop propagation and the peierls - nabarro barrier , an all - tom molecular dynamics simulation should be performed for example along the lines of @xcite .",
    "such simulations , in particular over extended temperature range as described here remain highly time consuming , thus we postpone a detailed all - atom investigation to a future article .",
