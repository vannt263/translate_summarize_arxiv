    "@xcite , with a center - of - mass energy of @xmath12  gev and an integrated luminosity of @xmath13  fb@xmath14 in the first stage , will precisely measure the masses and couplings of the susy particles when they are kinematically accessible .",
    "it has been shown that the underlying parameters of the susy model can be determined at the percent level and better  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the option of polarized @xmath15 and @xmath16 beams  @xcite at the ilc can yield higher statistics to test models beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "transversely polarized beams allow to study additional observables which are sensitive to effects of new physics .",
    "these are , for example , models with extra spacial dimensions , specific triple - gauge boson couplings , and also new sources of cp violation  @xcite .    in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm )",
    "@xcite , the spin - half superpartners of the neutral gauge and cp - even higgs bosons mix and form the four neutralinos @xmath17 . at tree - level , the neutralino sector of the mssm is defined by the @xmath18 and @xmath19 gaugino mass parameters @xmath6 and @xmath20 , respectively , the higgsino mass parameter @xmath5 , and the ratio @xmath21 of the vacuum expectation values of the two neutral higgs fields . besides the sleptons",
    ", the superpartners of the leptons , and the charginos , the superpartners of the charged gauge and higgs bosons , the neutralinos are expected to be among the lightest susy particles in many models . the neutralinos will be pair - produced  @xcite at the ilc @xmath22 by measurements of the neutralino masses , cross sections and decay distributions , methods have been developed to determine the parameters of the neutralino sector  @xcite . if cp is violated , the parameters @xmath23 and @xmath24 can be complex , while @xmath20 and @xmath25 can then be chosen real and positive .",
    "in general large values for cp phases in susy models lead to theoretical predictions for the electric dipole moments ( edm ) of electron , neutron and that of the atoms @xmath26hg and @xmath27tl , which are close or beyond the current experimental upper bounds  @xcite .",
    "the restrictions on the phases from edm measurements , however , strongly depend on the susy model , see e.g.  @xcite , and on the scenario  @xcite .",
    "this means that susy cp phases of the order one are not ruled out by the present edm experiments . for an unambiguous determination of",
    "the cp phases independent measurements are necessary , e.g. , by analyzing cp sensitive observables at colliders , in particular at the ilc .",
    "cp asymmetries with triple products  @xcite have been analyzed for the production of neutralinos and for their various two - body  @xcite and three - body decays  @xcite .",
    "it has been pointed out that longitudinally polarized beams can enhance simultaneously the cross sections and the cp asymmetries , such that higher statistics allows to measure even small phases  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to longitudinally polarized beams , the possibility of transverse beam polarization allows us to define a whole class of new and unique cp sensitive observables .",
    "these are asymmetries in the _ azimuthal _ distributions of final state particles . in general the transverse polarization of both beams",
    "is required , since these asymmetries vanish if only one beam is polarized .",

    "we study cp asymmetries with triple products in neutralino production  ( [ production ] ) , followed by the decay of one of the neutralinos into the @xmath8 boson @xmath32 for longitudinal and transverse beam polarizations . due to the majorana properties of the neutralinos ,",
    "the angular distribution of the @xmath8 boson is independent of the @xmath33 polarization , if the @xmath8 polarization is summed  @xcite .",
    "thus for longitudinally polarized beams , all cp sensitive information is lost . on the other hand ,",
    "the cp sensitive observables in the reaction ( [ production ] ) with transversely polarized beams require the reconstruction of the neutralino production plane .",
    "this can be challenging , since there is not enough kinematical information from energy and momentum conservation in the process @xmath34  @xcite .",
    "hence in either way , the polarization of the @xmath8 has to be included and analyzed by the angular distributions of its decay products . on account of this ,",
    "we study its leptonic and hadronic decays @xmath35 we will show that spin correlations between production and decay lead to sizeable cp asymmetries , which do not require the reconstruction of the production plane .    in section  [ definitions ] , we give the lagrangians and couplings for neutralino production  ( [ production ] ) and decay  ( [ decay_1a ] ) , ( [ decay_2b ] ) . in section  [ crosssection ] ,",
