    "both functions may be easily fitted to the experiments . to compare them theoretically",
    ", we will use the following parameters : the apparent resonance as the maximum of the distribution , the fwhm value , and the peak area .",
    "the maximum of the distribution is given for a certain detuning between laser and actual exciton resonance @xmath69 due to the asymmetry .",
    "hence , for @xmath70 , @xmath71 should become 0 as well for either model function . with this in mind",

    ", we find a different relation between @xmath16 and @xmath15 , but without a theory for @xmath15 this can easily be included in the fit parameters .",
    "moreover , in the region where @xmath74 and for @xmath75 , the maxima for both models become @xmath76    the fwhm value follows , after some lengthy algebra as @xmath77 for the toyozawa formula .",
    "the rabi spectrum fwhm value requires the solution of a fourth - order polynomial .",
    "more interestingly , when neglecting the asymmetry , we find for the rabi spectral width @xmath78 power broadening arises for sufficiently large @xmath11 , whereas the overall width is scaled down by a factor of around 1.55 .",
    "crucially , the @xmath11-dependence of the linewidth for @xmath79 is not changed as the scaling is constant . for a similar small change of the width for @xmath80 for both model functions",
    ", we again can not detect differences between the models for sufficiently low ratios of @xmath81 .",
    "finally , the integrated peak area @xmath82 reads as @xmath83 for the toyozawa formula and @xmath84 for the rabi model . inserting the known dependencies of the different parameters we find that both scale only with @xmath13 for low pumping strengths , while for larger ones , the rabi area would scale with @xmath85 .",
    "overall , we thus deduce that for low pumping strengths no detectable difference between these models can be found by freely fitting the model parameters to the experiments .",
    "exemplarily , we have fitted the resonance @xmath86 in fig .",

    "the only difference is due to the adjusted completeness relation @xmath93 however , the second line in eq .",
    "( [ eq.a0j ] ) stems from the laser driven resonance @xmath94 and couples the two excited states .",
    "it is based on the common ground state of both resonances allowing an effective quadrupolar coupling via the intermediate state @xmath28 .",

    "as we do not yet have a full theory for the peak asymmetry @xmath15 , we can use the following argument . according to toyozawa  @xcite ,",
    "the asymmetry comprises couplings to all other excited states via a phonon background . for large @xmath11",
    ", one may assume that this coupling is rather insensitive as the main couplings to low-@xmath11 states is almost the same for similarly large values of @xmath11 .",
    "in this case the @xmath15 in the rabi model would become constant , @xmath98 for @xmath99 . with this in mind",
    ", we can set the toyozawa and the rabi spectrum equal and determine the apparent @xmath15 fitted in the former .",
    "this yields @xmath100 ^ 2}q\\\\      & + \\frac{\\gamma_n}{4\\delta_n}\\left[1-g_n^2\\omega_n^2\\frac{(\\tfrac{\\gamma_n}{2})^2+\\delta_n^2}{[(\\tfrac{\\tilde\\gamma_n}{2})^2+\\delta_n^2]^2}\\right ] \\end{split}\\ ] ] here , @xmath101 in order to include the different fitted widths from the two models .",
    "unsurprisingly , @xmath15 is now a function of @xmath9 , meaning that we can only evaluate it at certain laser frequencies .",
    "we thus evaluate the arithmetic average between the values at the two half width values @xmath102 . including again the different @xmath11-dependencies",
    ", we obtain after some algebra @xmath103 with @xmath104 and @xmath105 positive constants .",
    "for @xmath106 we reobtain a constant behaviour of the apperent asymmetries , whereas for large @xmath11 , even though @xmath107 is constant @xmath15 goes down to zero .",

    "<S> the observed absorption in different experimental situations includes , besides the absorption - induced attenuation , also the intensity spectrum of the rydberg excitons . in the linear regime of a coherently driven system </S>",
    "<S> , this additional effect simply scales the absorption spectrum . for stronger excitation , </S>",
    "<S> the incoherent part of the exciton spectrum induces additional resonances , which were also observed in the experiments . </S>",
    "<S> their appearance indicates the onset of measurable quantum coherence between exciton states of consecutive principal quantum number , as well as very low levels of pure dephasing .    </S>",
    "<S> our model for the absorption spectrum of rydberg excitons accounts for a number of hitherto unexplained features , which should also be applicable to a variety of similar semiconductor experiments . </S>",
    "<S> rydberg excitons in @xmath5 have now reached a stage at which coherent quantum effects become visible , and the precise nature of the excitonic hamiltonian becomes detectable . </S>",
    "<S> this allows for controlled quantum manipulation and state generation for excitons and opens up the possibility for developing semiconductor quantum technologies .    </S>",
