    "<S> non - dispersive wave packet for massless fermions is formulated on the basis of squeezed coherent states that are put in a form of common eigenfunction for the hamiltonian and the helicity operator , starting from the dirac equation . </S>",

    "<S> furthermore , extensive wave packet may result in a superluminal velocity statistics if determined from the time - of - flight measurement , as recently done on muon neutrinos , when a threshold particle flux or energy transfer , which is eventually referred to the propagation of wave packet , to invoke a detection event is assumed .    in fundamental quantum theory , </S>",
    "<S> a free particle is represented by a plane wave @xmath0 which is the eigenfunction of the momentum operator . however , the plane wave can not be normalized , thus it does not fit our picture of particles which at least should make their presence only in a limited region of microscopic scale @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> packet waves have been formulated for light coming in indivisible unit of photons , a kind of massless boson , and for massive fermions such as electron , based on a dispersion relation derived from the electromagnetic wave equation for the former and from the schr@xmath1dinger equation or dirac equation for the latter , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , however , there is no mathematical formulation of wave packet for massless fermions , to the best knowledge of the authors . with the absence of massless fermions , </S>",
    "<S> the picture of particles as a wave packet is obviously incomplete .    with the introduction of wave packet , </S>",
    "<S> various particle behaviors are often discussed as a matter of fact in terms of this concept . yet in many circumstances , for instance when talking about the collision or detection by a detector , the particles are simply thought of as a point object . </S>",
    "<S> the handling of particles as a point object is a valid convenience when the size of the particles is much smaller than the scale of the experimental setup , or to be nearer to the reality , less than the size of atoms or atomic clusters that constitute the responsive agent of a detector . </S>",
    "<S> this is not a challenging requirement for electrons or protons since these massive fermions have a very short compton wavelength and they just behave as distinct identities though formally they can also be represented as a wave packet . for such massive fermions , the concepts of point particle and wave packet do not cause much confusion , and the output of measurement for one single particle striking a macroscopic detector should give a sharp value within the precision of the detection method . in the case of massless bosons , </S>",
    "<S> things become complicated . </S>",
    "<S> though we know that light comes in indivisible unit of photons , our description of relationship between light and photon is incomplete since , for example , the light can be polarized but we do nt know how each photon can keep a record of the light s polarity . </S>",
    "<S> this would take us away from the traditional ideal of elementary particles , and more significance may be attributed to the concept of wave pack . </S>",
    "<S> put this fact aside , we notice that the photons now can be brought into light pulses of enormously differing durations . </S>",
    "<S> it is reasonably conceivable that the wave packets describing light can in principle assume a macroscopic extension , noting that a temporal duration of 1.0 ns corresponds to a spatial extension of 30 cm for a light pulse subject to none of the decoherence mechanisms .    </S>",
    "<S> a quite natural question may be posed about massless fermions : how could they be represented as a packet wave , and what the extensive wave packet may imply for the investigation of behaviors of such particles ? </S>",
    "<S> this may be a question of some relevance , say , with regard to the recent report of superluminal velocity measurement on muon neutrinos @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> neutrino is a massless fermion in the standard model . </S>",
    "<S> some experimental observations , e.g. , neutrino oscillation , point to the probability that neutrinos may have mass . </S>",
    "<S> it is believed that the upper limit for heavier neutrinos is at the order of magnitude of 2 ev , and the lightest neutrino could in principle be massless @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we shall always presuppose @xmath2 without distinguish the flavors of the neutrinos in the current work . </S>",
    "<S> now , a massless neutrino , following relativistic quantum mechanics , should propagate at the velocity of light in vacuum , c , and the detection of its velocity , if the neutrino behaves as a point particle , is expected to give a sharp value of c within the precision of the method . </S>",
    "<S> however , adam and coworkers recently showed that the velocity of muon neutrino with the average energy of 17 gev , by time - of - flight measurement , displays surprisingly a skewed distribution biased at the @xmath3 side . </S>",
    "<S> this has been even interpreted as the proof of superluminal existence . </S>",
    "<S> a detailed inspection of the data for the experiment performed at the average of 28.1 gev further indicates that the data taking only events at energy @xmath420 gev give to a more severe superluminal velocity statistics @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> could it be possible that the massless neutrinos propagate as a train of wave at a group velocity of c , yet the behavior of the wave packet could lead to an energy - dependent velocity statistics deviating from c ?    in this article , we report the formulation of wave packet , starting from the dirac equation , for massless fermions on the basis of the squeezed coherent states @xcite , and the wave packet thus constructed is non - dispersive and propagates at the velocity of light . </S>",
    "<S> we see that by assuming a threshold particle flux or energy transfer , which to the end is referred to the probability distribution described by the wave packet , is desired to invoke a detection event for the particle , the measured velocity statistics for neutrinos could find a reasonable explanation without breaking relativity .    for a massless fermion , </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian is given in the form @xmath5 where , c , the velocity of light , is a parameter that connects space and time . </S>",
    "<S> this does nt necessarily imply that the particle has a definite velocity as that of light , bearing in mind the dirac equation for the massive electron .    for simplicity , without loss of generality </S>",
    "<S> , we consider the situation that the particle propagates along x - direction , then the hamitonian ( 1 ) is rewritten as @xmath6 now , let s represent the position operator @xmath7 and momentum @xmath8 in terms of the creation and annihilation operators @xmath9 with @xmath10 being a parameter in the dimension of length , then the hamitonian in eq.(2 ) turns into @xmath11 where @xmath12 .    </S>",
    "<S> it is obvious that the helicity , @xmath13 , i.e. , the projection of the spin of the particle onto the direction of momentum , is a conserved quantity since it commutates with the hamiltonian in eq.(2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the eigenstates for the helicity operator are given as follows @xmath14 which correspond to the eigenvalue + 1 and -1 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the eigenstates in eq.(5 ) are , however , not normalizable since the integral arising from the term @xmath15 is unlimited for @xmath16 . consequently , such eigenstates of a unique helicity is not proper for the physical representation of a massless fermon though it was claimed that the state of a massless neutrino could never be a superposition of two different helicities and the experiment gave a direct indication that the helicity of neutrino is negative @xcite . in order to construct a normalizable physical state in the form of wave packet for a massless fermion </S>",
    "<S> , the mixing of helicity seems unavoidable . </S>",
    "<S> let s take the wave packet given below as the initial state of the massless fermion @xmath17 where the weight factor in the integral is gaussian . </S>",
    "<S> it can be shown that such an initial state is normalizable , as can be proved that @xmath18 , in deriving this we have used the enclosure relation for the coherent state @xmath19 , i.e. , @xmath20 , and the integrals @xmath21 and @xmath22 .    </S>",
    "<S> the temporal evolution of the state represented by the wave packet in eq.(6 ) can be derived in a straightforward way . at any moment </S>",
    "<S> @xmath23 , it has @xmath24    thus the expectation value for the position operator at any moment @xmath23 is @xmath25 which leads to the result @xmath26 , implying that the velocity of the packet wave is a constant of _ c _ , as @xmath27 .    </S>",
    "<S> now let s calculate the width of the wave packet at any moment @xmath23 , @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> note that @xmath29 , it thus has @xmath30 , consequently @xmath31^{1/2}=\\delta(\\frac{2}{\\gamma}-\\frac{1}{2})^{1/2}.\\ ] ] based on the arguments above one concludes that the wave packet given in eq.(6 ) is non - dispersive , and propagates at a velocity of _ c _ , therefore it can be used to represent a massless fermion or a beam of massless fermions.it is noteworthy to mention that @xmath32 as required by the normalization condition and the positiveness of the wave packet width .    from eq.(9 ) </S>",
    "<S> we see that the extension of this non - dispersive wave packet is proportional to the free parameters @xmath10 , consequently it can in principle be made sufficiently extensive . </S>",
    "<S> this is analogous to the case of light for which the wave packet can be of an enormously variable lengths , since the compton wavelength of photon is infinitely long and the photons are almost decoupled from each other . for massless particles such as photons and neutrinos , their behaviors are expected to display more undulatory characteristics . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , massive particles such as electrons and neutrons have a limited compton wavelength , their wave packet can have only a limited extension - in general cases they are just treated as a distinct particle instead of a train of wave .    </S>",
    "<S> now it is probably appropriate to discuss the statistics of velocity measurement for the massless fermions , e.g. , for neutrino . when the neutrinos are represented by the wave packet formulated in eq.(6 ) </S>",
    "<S> , does that imply the possibility of measuring a superluminal velocity under certain circumstances ? or , what kind of an energy - dependent velocity measurement can be anticipated for neutrinos when taken as a non - dispersive wave packet with a constant propagation velocity of _ c _ ?    </S>",
    "<S> the difference of the measured velocities for muon neutrinos relative to that of light has been given in a statistical notion , and the original data of velocity scatter randomly around the velocity of light . </S>",
    "<S> for the muon neutrinos with an average energy of 17 gev , adam and coworkers , based on the measurement of time - of - flight through a base line of 730 km long , came to the conclusion that @xmath33@xcite . a measurement performed for an average neutrino energy of 28.1 </S>",
    "<S> gev shows only negligible difference from the result above , but the statistics taking events of energy higher than 20 gev shows a significantly larger velocity than that for energy below 20 gev , the early neutrino arrival time @xmath34 is @xmath3567.1 ns in the former case while only @xmath3553.1ns in the latter case @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , it is worth noting that the minos experiment with neutrino energy peaking at @xmath353.0 gev with a tail extending to above 100 gev results in @xmath36 @xcite , but a stringent limit of @xmath37 ( given in absolute value ! ) was set by the observation of ( anti ) neutrinos emitted by the sn1987a supernova in the 100 mev range @xcite . roughly speaking </S>",
    "<S> , the measured neutrino velocity seems to suggest that following a larger neutrino energy there may be an increased probability of measuring a superluminal velocity .    </S>",
    "<S> the wave packet formulated in eq.(6 ) for massless fermions is strictly non - dispersive , and it propagates at a constant velocity of light . </S>",
    "<S> this concludes from the solution of the equation of motion for the particles , which is consistent with both special relativity and quantum theory . if the velocity of such a wave packet is determined by measuring the time of flight , then so long as time tagging is performed with respect to precisely the same position on the wave packet , say the center of the wave packet but not necessarily , it will result in the same value , _ c _ , even though it has a finite extension . for the muon neutrinos in ref.@xcite , it requires a time tagging referring to exactly the same position of the wave packet at the source and at the detector , a quite challenging task because the time tagging was performed via different processes . </S>",
    "<S> the finite extension of the wave packet may cause a peculiar systematic deviation of measured neutrino velocity from the velocity of light , following the copenhagen interpretation of the wave function .    </S>",
    "<S> the event that a particle initiates as being registered , whether on the surface of a solid detector directly or via an intermediate nuclear reaction , is essentially quantum mechanical , i.e. , in a statistical sense . </S>",
    "<S> suppose that it needs a threshold particle flux , or energy transfer , to invoke a detection event , e.g. , to generate taus to be measured to indicate the arrival of the neutrinos @xcite , then this implies that a threshold portion of the wave packet has to enter the detection region or the device @xcite . as we mentioned above , the wave packet for neutrinos can have a macroscopic extension as a pulse of light , the superluminal velocity statistics for neutrino can find a natural and straightforward explanation under the threshold probability assumption . in case a larger threshold portion of the wave packet , implying a larger particle flux or energy transfer , is required to invoke a detection event that the time tagging at the detector might be retarded relative to the time tagging at the source , the velocity distribution will be biased by @xmath38 results ; and if a smaller threshold probability of the wave packet is required that the time - of flight measurement may lead to an early arrival time , then the velocity distribution may be biased by @xmath3 results ( figure 1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , for the beam of neutrinos of greater energy , the velocity distribution may contain more superluminal data , farther from the value of _ </S>",
    "<S> c_.    in summary , non - dispersive wave packet with a constant propagation velocity of _ c _ has been formulated for massless fermions starting from the dirac equation . </S>",
    "<S> such a wave packet is constructed from the superposition of common eigenstates of the hamiltonian and the helicity operator , which are represented on the basis of the squeezed - coherent states . </S>",
    "<S> based on the assumption that a threshold portion of the wave packet is demanded to invoke a detection event , the wave packet , macroscopically extensive as it may be in principle as a beam of light , can provide a quite reasonable explanation to the superluminal velocity statistics recently reported for neutrino , which is anticipated to occur more frequently and farther away from the velocity of light at higher particle energies . </S>",
    "<S> the result can serve as a basis for the discussion of other problems concerning massless fermions where the formulation of the wave packet may be of formal significance .    </S>",
