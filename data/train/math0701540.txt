    "semiparametric models are statistical models indexed by both a finite dimensional parameter of interest @xmath0 and an infinite dimensional nuisance parameter @xmath1 .",
    "the profile likelihood is typically defined as @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the likelihood of the semiparametric model given @xmath4 observations and @xmath5 is the parameter space for @xmath1 .",
    "we also define @xmath6 the convergence rate of the nuisance parameter @xmath1 is the order of @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is some metric on @xmath1 , @xmath9 is any sequence satisfying @xmath10 , and @xmath11 is the true value of @xmath1 .",
    "typically , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the euclidean norm and @xmath14 .",
    "of course , a smaller value of @xmath15 leads to a slower convergence rate of the nuisance parameter .",
    "for instance , the nuisance parameter in the cox proportional hazards model with right censored data , the cumulative hazard function , has the parametric rate , i.e. , @xmath16 .",
    "if current status data is applied to the cox model instead , then the convergence rate will be slower , with @xmath17 , due to the loss of information provided by this kind of data .",
    "the profile sampler is the procedure of sampling from the posterior of the profile likelihood in order to estimate and draw inference on the parametric component @xmath0 in a semiparametric model , where the profiling is done over the possibly infinite - dimensional nuisance parameter @xmath1 .",
    "@xcite show that the profile sampler gives a first order correct approximation to the maximum likelihood estimator @xmath18 and consistent estimation of the efficient fisher information for @xmath0 even when the nuisance parameter is not estimable at the @xmath19 rate .",
    "another bayesian procedure employed to do semiparametric estimation is considered in @xcite who study the marginal semiparametric posterior distribution for a parameter of interest . in particular , @xcite",
    "show that marginal semiparametric posterior distributions are asymptotically normal and centered at the corresponding maximum likelihood estimates or posterior means , with covariance matrix equal to the inverse of the fisher information .",
    "unfortunately , this fully bayesian method requires specification of a prior on @xmath1 , which is quite challenging since for some models there is no direct extension of the concept of a lebesgue dominating measure for the infinite - dimensional parameter set involved @xcite .",
    "the advantages of the profile sampler for estimating @xmath0 compared to other methods is discussed extensively in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .    in many semiparametric models involving a smooth nuisance parameter ,",
    "it is often convenient and beneficial to perform estimation using penalization .",
    "one motivation for this is that , in the absence of any restrictions on the form of the function @xmath1 , maximum likelihood estimation for some semiparametric models leads to over - fitting .",
    "seminal applications of penalized maximum likelihood estimation include estimation of a probability density function in @xcite and nonparametric linear regression in @xcite .",
    "note that penalized likelihood is a special case of penalized quasi - likelihood studied in @xcite .",
    "under certain reasonable regularity conditions , penalized semiparametric log - likelihood estimation can yield fully efficient estimates for @xmath0 ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "as far as we are aware , the only general procedure for inference for @xmath0 in this context known to be theoretically valid is a weighted bootstrap with bounded random weights ( see @xcite ) .",
    "it is even unclear whether the usual nonparametric bootstrap will work in this context when the nuisance parameter has a convergence rate @xmath20 .",
    "in contrast , @xcite and @xcite have shown that the profile sampler procedure without penalization can essentially yield second order frequentist valid inference for @xmath0 in semiparametric models , where the estimation accuracy is dependent on the convergence rate of the nuisance parameter .",
    "in other words , a faster convergence rate of the nuisance parameters can yield more precise frequentist inference for @xmath0 .",
    "these second order results are verified in @xcite and @xcite for several examples , including the cox model for both right censored and current status data , the proportional odds model , case - control studies with missing covariates , and the partly linear normal model .",
    "the convergence rates for these models range from the parametric to the cubic .",
    "the work in @xcite has shown clearly that the accuracy of the inference for @xmath0 based on the profile sampler method is intrinsically determined by the semiparametric model specifications through its entropy number .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to ask the somewhat natural question : does sampling from a profiled penalized log - likelihood ( which process we refer hereafter to as the penalized profile sampler ) yield first and even second order accurate frequentist inference ?",
    "the conclusion of this paper is that the answer is yes and , moreover , the accuracy of the inference depends in a fairly simple way on the size of the smoothing parameter .",
    "the unknown parameters in the semiparametric models we study in this paper includes @xmath0 , which we assume belongs to some compact set @xmath21 , and @xmath1 , which we assume to be a function in the sobolev class of functions supported on some compact set on the real line , whose @xmath22-th derivative exists and is absolutely continuous with @xmath23 , where @xmath24 here @xmath22 is a fixed , positive integer and @xmath25 is the @xmath26-th derivative of @xmath1 with respect to @xmath27 .",
    "obviously @xmath28 is some measurement of complexity of @xmath1 .",
    "we denote @xmath29 as the sobolev function class with degree @xmath22 .",
    "the penalized log - likelihood in this context is : @xmath30 where @xmath31 , @xmath32 is the log - likelihood of the single observation @xmath33 , and @xmath34 is a smoothing parameter , possibly dependent on data . in practice ,",
    "@xmath34 can be obtained by cross - validation @xcite or by inspecting the various curves for different values of @xmath34 . the penalized maximum likelihood estimators",
    "@xmath18 and @xmath35 depend on the choice of the smoothing parameter @xmath34 .",
    "consequently we use the notation @xmath36 and @xmath37 for the remainder of this paper to denote the estimators obtained from maximizing  ( [ penlik ] ) .",
    "in particular , a larger smoothing parameter usually leads to a less rough penalized estimator of @xmath11 .    for the purpose of establishing first order accuracy of inference for @xmath0 based on the penalized profile sampler ,",
    "we assume that the bounds for the smoothing parameter are in the form below : @xmath38 the condition ( [ smooth ] ) is assumed to hold throughout this paper .",
    "one way to ensure ( [ smooth ] ) in practice is simply to set @xmath39 .",
    "or we can just choose @xmath40 which is independent of @xmath22 .",
    "it turns out that the upper bound guarantees that @xmath36 is @xmath19-consistent , while the lower bound controls the penalized nuisance parameter estimator convergence rate .",
    "another approach to controlling estimators is to use sieve estimates with assumptions on the derivatives ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we will not pursue this further here .",
    "the log - profile penalized likelihood is defined as follows : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is @xmath43 for fixed @xmath0 and @xmath34 .",
    "the penalized profile sampler is just the procedure of sampling from the posterior distribution of @xmath44 by assigning a prior on @xmath0 . by analyzing the corresponding mcmc chain from the frequentist s point of view",
    ", our paper obtains the following conclusions :    * _ distribution approximation _ : the posterior distribution with respect to @xmath44 can be approximated by the normal distribution with mean the maximum penalized likelihood estimator of @xmath0 and variance the inverse of the efficient information matrix , with error @xmath45 ; * _ moment approximation _ : the maximum penalized likelihood estimator of @xmath0 can be approximated by the mean of the mcmc chain with error @xmath46 .",
    "the efficient information matrix can be approximated by the inverse of the variance of the mcmc chain with error @xmath45 ; * _ confidence interval approximation _ : an exact frequentist confidence interval of wald s type for @xmath0 can be estimated by the credible set obtained from the mcmc chain with error @xmath46 .",
    "obviously , given any smoothing parameter satisfying the upper bound in  ( [ smooth ] ) , the penalized profile sampler can yield first order frequentist valid inference for @xmath0 , similar as to what was shown for the profile sampler in @xcite .",
    "moreover , the above conclusions are actually second order frequentist valid results , whose approximation accuracy is directly controlled by the smoothing parameter . note that the corresponding results for the usual ( non - penalized ) profile sampler with nuisance parameter convergence rate @xmath15 in @xcite are obtained by replacing in the above @xmath45 with @xmath47 and @xmath46 with @xmath48 , for all respective occur where @xmath15 is as defined in  ( [ convr ] ) .",
    "our results are the first higher order frequentist inference results for penalized semiparametric estimation .",
    "the layout of the article is as follows .",
    "the next section , section 2 , introduces the two main examples we will be using for illustration : partly linear regression for current status data and semiparametric logistic regression . some background is given in section  3 , including the concept of a least favorable submodel as well as some notations and the main model assumptions . in section  [ rate ] , some preliminary results are developed , including three rather different theorems concerning the convergence rates of the penalized nuisance parameters and the order of the estimated penalty term under different conditions .",
    "the corresponding rates for the two featured examples are also calculated in this section .",
    "the main results and implications are discussed in section 5 , and all remaining model assumptions are verified for the examples in section 6 . a brief discussion of future work is given in section  7 .",
    "we postpone all technical tools and proofs to the last section , section 8 .",
    "in this example , we study the partly linear regression model with normal residue error . the continuous outcome @xmath49 , conditional on the covariates @xmath50 , is modeled as @xmath51 where @xmath52 is an unknown smooth function , and @xmath53 with finite variance @xmath54 . for simplicity ,",
    "we assume for the rest of the paper that @xmath55 .",
    "the theory we propose also works when @xmath56 is unknown , but the added complexity would detract from the main issues .",
    "we also assume that only the current status of response @xmath49 is observed at a random censoring time @xmath57 .",
    "in other words , we observe @xmath58 , where indicator @xmath59 .",
    "current status data may occur due to study design or measurement limitations .",
    "examples of such data arise in several fields , including demography , epidemiology and econometrics . for simplicity of exposition",
    ", @xmath0 is assumed to be one dimensional .    under the model  ( [ eg2lik ] ) and given that the joint distribution for @xmath60 does not involve parameters @xmath61 , the log - likelihood for a single observation at @xmath62 is @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the standard normal distribution .",
    "the parameter of interest , @xmath0 , is assumed to belong to some compact set in @xmath65 .",
    "the nuisance parameter is the function @xmath52 , which belongs to the sobolev function class of degree @xmath22 .",
    "we further make the following assumptions on this model .",
    "we assume that @xmath66 is independent given @xmath67 .",
    "the covariates @xmath67 are assumed to belong to some compact set , and the support for random censoring time @xmath68 is an interval @xmath69 $ ] , where @xmath70 .",
    "in addition , @xmath71 is strictly positive and @xmath72 . the first order",
    "asymptotic behaviors of the penalized log - likelihood estimates of a slightly more general version of this model have been extensively studied in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath73 , @xmath74 ,  be independent copies of @xmath75 , where @xmath49 is a dichotomous variable with conditional expectation @xmath76 .",
    "@xmath77 is the logistic distribution defined as @xmath78 .",
    "obviously the likelihood for a single observation is of the following form : @xmath79    this example is a special case of quasi - likelihood in partly linear models when the conditional variance of response @xmath49 is taken to have some quadratic form of the conditional mean of @xmath49 . in the absence of any restrictions on the form of the function @xmath1",
    ", the maximum likelihood of this simple model often leads to over - fitting .",
    "hence @xcite propose maximizing instead the penalized likelihood of the form @xmath80 ; and @xcite studied the asymptotic properties of the maximum penalized likelihood estimators for @xmath0 and @xmath1 . for simplicity",
    ", we will restrict ourselves to the case where @xmath81 and @xmath82 have bounded support , say @xmath83^{2}$ ] . to ensure the identifiability of the parameters , we assume that @xmath84 is positive and that the support of @xmath85 contains at least @xmath22 distinct points in @xmath83 $ ] .",
    "another interesting potential example we may apply the penalized profile sampler method to is the classic proportional hazards model with current status data by penalizing the cumulative hazard function with its sobolev norm .",
    "there are two motivations for us to penalize the cumulative hazard function in the cox model .",
    "one is that the estimated step functions from the unpenalized estimation can not be used easily for other estimation or inference purposes .",
    "another issue with the unpenalized approach is that without making stronger continuity assumptions , we can not achieve uniform consistency even on a compact set @xcite .",
    "the asymptotic properties of the corresponding penalized m - estimators have been studied in @xcite .",
    "in this section , we present some necessary preliminary material concerning least favorable submodels , general notational conventions for the paper , and an enumeration of the main assumptions .      in this subsection",
    ", we briefly review the concept of a least favorable submodel .",
    "a submodel @xmath86 is defined to be least favorable at @xmath87 if @xmath88 , given @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the efficient score function for @xmath0 . the efficient score function for @xmath0 can be viewed as the projection of the score function for @xmath0 onto the tangent space of @xmath1 .",
    "the inverse of its variance is exactly the efficient information matrix @xmath91 .",
    "we abbreviate hereafter @xmath92 and @xmath93 with @xmath94 and @xmath95 , respectively .",
    "the `` direction '' along which @xmath96 approaches @xmath1 in the least favorable submodel is called the least favorable direction .",
    "an insightful review about least favorable submodels and efficient score functions can be found in chapter  3 of @xcite . by the above construction of the least favorable submodel",
    ", @xmath97 can be rewritten in the following form : @xmath98 where @xmath99 , @xmath100 is a general map from the neighborhood of @xmath0 into the parameter set for @xmath1 , with @xmath101 .",
    "the concrete forms of ( [ penlfs ] ) will depend on the situation .",
    "we present in this subsection some notation that will be used throughout the paper .",
    "the derivatives of the function @xmath102 are with respect to its first argument , @xmath103 . for the derivatives relative to the other two arguments @xmath0 and @xmath1 , we use the following shortened notation",
    ": @xmath104 indicates the first derivative of @xmath102 with respect to @xmath0 .",
    "similarly , @xmath105 denotes the derivative of @xmath106 with respect to @xmath0 .",
    "also , @xmath107 and @xmath108 indicate the maps @xmath109 and @xmath110 , respectively . for brevity ,",
    "we denote @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 , where @xmath114 , @xmath115 are the true values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 . of course , we can write @xmath116 as @xmath117 . @xmath13 and @xmath118 indicate the euclidean norm and @xmath119 norm , respectively . the notations @xmath120 and @xmath121 mean greater than , or smaller than , up to a universal constant .",
    "the symbols @xmath122 and @xmath123 are used for the empirical distribution and the empirical processes of the observations , respectively .",
    "we now make the following three classes of assumptions : rate assumptions ( r1 ) for the penalized nuisance parameter and the estimated penalty term ; smoothness assumptions ( s1-s2 ) and empirical processes assumptions ( e1 ) for @xmath102 and its related derivatives .    *",

    "* : for all random sequences @xmath130 and @xmath131 , we have @xmath132    assumption r1 implicitly assumes that we have a metric or topology defined on the set of possible values of the nuisance parameter @xmath1 .",
    "the form of @xmath133 may vary for different situations and does not need to be specified in this subsection beyond the given conditions .",
    "( [ penrate ] ) implies that @xmath134 is consistent for @xmath11 as @xmath135 in probability .",
    "additionally , from ( [ jrate ] ) we know that the smoothing parameter @xmath34 plays a role in determining the complexity degree of the estimated nuisance parameter .",
    "( [ jrate ] ) implies that @xmath136 if the @xmath36 is asymptotically normal , which has been shown in ( [ penmle ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath137 , where @xmath138 for a fixed @xmath0 , based on the inequality that @xmath139 .    clearly , the assumptions s1 and s2 are separately the smoothness conditions for the euclidean parameters @xmath140 and the infinite dimensional nuisance parameter @xmath1 . the boundedness of the frchet derivatives of the maps @xmath141 and @xmath142 ensures the validity of conditions ( [ smcon2 ] ) and ( [ smcon3 ] ) .",
    "based on the discussions in section 2 of @xcite , under the given regularity conditions , it suffices to show ( [ nobias3 ] ) if the map @xmath143 is frchet differentiable and the map @xmath144 is second order frchet differentiable .    condition ( [ smcon1 ] ) is concerned with the asymptotic equicontinuity of the empirical process measure of @xmath145 with @xmath1 ranging around the neighborhood of @xmath11 .",
    "it suffices to show ( [ eg2em1 ] ) and ( [ eg2em2 ] ) if @xmath146 and @xmath147 , provided @xmath148 and @xmath149 are square integrable .",
    "thus we will be able to use technical tools t2 and t6 given in the appendix to show ( [ smcon1])([eg2em2 ] ) .",
    "for the verification of ( [ eg2em3 ] ) , we need to make use of a glivenko - cantelli theorem for classes of functions that change with @xmath4 which is a modification of theorem 2.4.3 in @xcite and is explained in the appendix .    in principle , assumptions s1 , s2 and e1 on the functions of the least favorable submodel directly imply the following empirical no - bias conditions : @xmath150 the derivations of ( [ emno1 ] ) and ( [ emno2 ] ) are simply based on the regular taylor expansions around the true values .",
    "the detailed arguments can be found in the proof of lemmas  1 and  2 in  @xcite .",
    "the two empirical no - bias conditions ensure that the penalized profile likelihood behaves like a penalized likelihood in the parametric model asymptotically and therefore yields a second order asymptotic expansion of the penalized profile log - likelihood .",
    "in the previous section , we have imposed two assumptions about the convergence rates of the estimated nuisance parameter and the order of the estimated penalty term , i.e. ( [ penrate ] ) and ( [ jrate ] ) . to compute the convergence rates , we present three different theorems below which require different sets of conditions .",
    "these theorems can be viewed as extension of general results on m - estimators to penalized m - estimators , and are therefore of independent interest .",
