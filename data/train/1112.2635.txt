    "if good superpartner - candidates are discovered at the lhc , the most important target will be the precise measurement of their masses and interactions .",
    "the verification of softly broken supersymmetry will have in fact to pass through the verification of well - defined relations among the masses and the couplings of these new particles @xcite .",
    "the necessity of performing these measurements would then be a primary motivation for a linear @xmath6-collider .",
    "moreover , as first noted in @xcite , the radiative corrections to these supersymmetric relations are logarithmically sensitive to large mass differences between the superpartners .",
    "thus , in a situation in which some of the superpartners are relatively heavy and out of the reach of direct production , the precise measurement of the properties of the lighter ones can provide important indirect informations on the heavy part of the spectrum .",
    "these effects have been intensively studied in the past @xcite , sometimes with the somewhat misleading name of `` super - oblique corrections '' .",
    "in fact the approximation of retaining only the oblique contributions is typically not justified , the vertex corrections being of equal importance .",
    "it is convenient instead to discuss these effects in an effective lagrangian approach , as done in @xcite in the context of split - supersymmetry @xcite which is one of the best motivated frameworks with very large mass splittings between the superpartner masses .",
    "let us focus on the split - susy case , and recall the low energy spectrum contains the sm particles with one higgs doublet @xmath7 , the higgsinos @xmath8 and the gauginos @xmath9 , with typical mass @xmath10 .",
    "in the conventions of @xcite the most general renormalizable effective lagrangian , with matter parity and the particle content assumed above , is given by : @xmath11 \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 and the gauge - invariant kinetic terms have been omitted .",
    "if one matches at tree level the couplings @xmath13 with the ones of the full mssm lagrangian at the scale @xmath14 at which the heavy fields are decoupled , then one finds : @xmath15 @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the yukawa and gauge couplings . when the heavy fields are decoupled , the gauge couplings @xmath18 and the gaugino ones @xmath19 run differently down to low energy , and this results in a calculable mismatch with respect to the supersymmetric relations ( [ eq : susyrel:1])-([eq : susyrel:3 ] ) .",
    "in fact , if the scale @xmath14 is very far away , as it can be in split supersymmetry , then the large logarithms of the ratio @xmath20 need to be resummed . to this end , in @xcite the relevant rges are reported , under which the above couplings evolve down to low energy .",
    "these rges can be obtained from the general results @xcite@xcite@xcite and can be seen to match the supersymmetric case @xcite once the heavy superpartners are reintroduced . on the other hand , besides the logarithmically enhanced contributions there are also finite threshold terms coming from the matching at the scale at which the heavy superpartners are integrated out .",
    "these kind of terms are usually taken into account only when one considers the two loop running ( see e.g. @xcite ) , however as already noticed in @xcite if the logarithms are not so large then the various threshold contributions may become numerically important .",
    "in fact in @xcite the one loop threshold correction of @xmath21 to the quartic coupling @xmath22 is included , but the threshold corrections to the relations between the gauge and gaugino couplings are still missing in the literature . our scope is to compute , in the context of split - susy , all these finite terms which have been so far computed only partially or in particular cases .",
    "thus the situation in which `` supersymmetry is split but not so much '' will also be covered .",
    "details about the computation are reported in the appendix [ app : matching ] .",
    "the final result in the @xmath23 renormalization scheme is , keeping only the top yukawa coupling : @xmath24     \\label{eq : gprime : up }   \\\\ & & + \\frac{1}{(4\\pi)^2 } \\left [   \\frac{21}{16 } \\cos^2 \\beta \\ , g^{2 }   + \\left ( -\\frac{21}{8 } + \\frac{7}{16 } \\cos^2 \\beta \\right)g^{\\prime 2 } + \\left (   \\frac{3}{4\\sin^2 \\beta } + \\frac{3 } { 2 }   \\right ) h_t^2 \\right ] \\nonumber \\\\ \\left .",

    "notice that neglecting the finite threshold terms one recovers the equations ( 26 ) and ( 27 ) of @xcite .    in the @xmath28 scheme one has additional threshold corrections due to the fact that the regularization does not respect supersymmetry .",
    "these additional terms are reported for completeness in appendix [ app : msanddr ] .",
    "equations ( [ eq : gprime : up])-([eq : g : down ] ) are appropriate assuming that the heavy superpartners have a common mass @xmath14 .",
    "the precise form of the heavy spectrum can introduce additional threshold corrections that can be easily derived from the expressions that we report in the appendix [ app : matching ] for generic heavy masses .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the typical size of the deviation from @xmath29 of the ratios ( [ eq : gprime : up])-([eq : g : down ] ) is of order of a few percent for @xmath30 tev , as graphically shown in figure [ fig : figure ] left . at the same time",
    "the size of the threshold corrections that we computed is at most of order 1% , as shown in figure [ fig : figure ] right .",
    "we conclude that the impact of these threshold corrections on the supersymmetric relations among gauge and gaugino couplings is negligible , for practical purposes , until a precision at the percent level is reached in the measurement of these observables .",
    "notice however that it will be compulsory to reach such a high precision , in order to start probing the radiative corrections to these relations , if @xmath20 is not much larger than @xmath31 . in this last case",
    "the threshold corrections of the type that we computed would need to be taken into account .",
    "we thank alessandro strumia and gian giudice for discussions and encouragement . this work has been supported in part by the eu itn `` unification in the lhc era '' , contract pitn - ga-2009 - 237920 ( unilhc ) .",
    "to obtain the results ( [ eq : gprime : up])-([eq : g : down ] ) we match at one loop the couplings @xmath32s of the effective theory ( [ eq : efflagr ] ) with the couplings @xmath33s of the full theory at a scale @xmath34 .",
    "to this end it is sufficient to consider the diagrams that involve some heavy virtual particle , since all the other diagrams give the same contribution in the two cases .",
