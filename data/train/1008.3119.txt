    "in ref .  , we introduced the framework to study backward pion electroproduction , @xmath1 on a proton ( or neutron ) target , in the bjorken regime ( @xmath2 large and @xmath3 fixed ) in terms of a factorized amplitude ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fact ] ) where a hard part is convoluted with transition distribution amplitudes ( tdas ) , as well as the reaction , @xmath4 in the near forward region.@xcite this extended the concept of generalised parton distributions ( gpds ) .",
    "such an extension of the gpd framework has already been advocated in the pioneering work of ref .  .",
    "the tdas involved in the description of deeply - virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) in the backward kinematics @xmath5 and the reaction @xmath6 in the near forward region were given in ref .  .",
    "recently , a study of the tdas in the meson - cloud model@xcite has become available.@xcite . yet , more work is needed before being able to proceed to _ quantitative _ comparisons between different tda models and between theory and experiments . for the time",
    "being , model independent analyses  looking for scaling or characteristic polarization effects  sound more expedient . in this context",
    ", we would like to argue here that the study of target transverse - spin asymmetry ( which we will denote ssa ) could be used as a test of the dominance of a hard parton - induced scattering in the backward region at large @xmath7 rather than that of a soft baryon exchange in the @xmath0-channel .",
    "such a reaction would only generate phases through final state interactions , expected to decrease for @xmath8 and large @xmath7 . on the contrary , in reactions at the parton level , one expects an imaginary part to develop and to generate a ssa independently of whether @xmath9 and @xmath7 are large or not .",
    "this will be explained later on .",
    "the five - fold differential cross section for the process @xmath10 can be reduced to a two - fold one  expressible in the center - of - mass frame of the @xmath11 pair ",
    "multiplied by a flux factor @xmath12 , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the differential solid angle for the scattered electron in the lab frame , and @xmath15 is the differential solid angle for the pion in the @xmath11 center - of - mass frame , such that @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath17 is defined as the polar angle between the virtual photon and the pion in the latter system ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : kin ] ) .",
    "@xmath18 is the azimuthal angle between the electron plane and the plane of the process @xmath19 ( hadronic plane ) ( @xmath20 when the pion is emitted in the half plane containing the outgoing electron ) .",
    "in general , we have contributions from different polarisations of the photon .",
    "for that reason , we define four polarised cross sections , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , , the linear polarisations of the virtual photon ( for the definition of the @xmath25 & @xmath26 axis , see fig .  [ fig : fact ] ) , one defines@xcite @xmath27 , @xmath28 $ ] , @xmath29 and @xmath30 $ ] . ] which do not depend on @xmath18 but only on @xmath31 , @xmath7 and @xmath17 .",
    "the @xmath18 dependence is written as  @xcite @xmath32 at the leading - twist accuracy , the qcd mechanism considered here contributes only to @xmath33 .    in the scaling regime , the amplitude for @xmath34 in the backward kinematics ",
    "namely small @xmath35 or @xmath36 close to -1  involves the tdas @xmath37 , where @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) denote the light - cone - momentum fractions carried by participant quarks and @xmath40 is the skewness parameter such that @xmath41 .",
    "the amplitude is then a convolution of the proton das , a perturbatively - calculable - hard - scattering amplitude and the tdas , defined from the fourier transform of a matrix element of a three - quark - light - cone operator between a proton and a meson state .",
    "we have shown that these tdas obey qcd evolution equations , which follow from the renormalisation - group equation of the three - quark operator .",
    "their @xmath7 dependence is thus completely under control .",
    "the momenta of the process @xmath42 are defined as in fig .",
    "[ fig : fact ]  &  [ fig : kin ] .",
    "the @xmath43-axis is chosen along the initial nucleon and the virtual photon momenta and the @xmath44 plane is identified with the collision or hadronic plane ( fig .",
    "[ fig : kin ] ) .",
    "then , we define the light - cone vectors @xmath45 and @xmath46 ( @xmath47=@xmath48=0 ) such that @xmath49 , as well as @xmath50 , @xmath51 and its transverse component @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) . from those ,",
    "we define @xmath40 in an usual way as @xmath54 .",
    "we can then express the momenta of the particles through their sudakov decomposition and , keeping the first - order corrections in the masses and @xmath55 , we have : @xmath56n + \\delta_t { \\nonumber}\\end{split}\\ ] ] @xmath57n - \\delta_t,\\\\ \\end{split}\\ ] ]    for @xmath58 and @xmath59 with the axis definitions of fig .",
    "[ fig : kin ] , one may further specify that @xmath60 for the transverse spin of the target ( @xmath61 ) .    in the following , we use the same definition of the @xmath62 tdas as given by eq .",
    "( 15 ) of ref . [ ] .",
    "at leading order in @xmath63 , the amplitude @xmath64 for @xmath65 reads    @xmath66 , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 and the coefficients @xmath70 and @xmath71@xmath72 are functions of @xmath73,@xmath74,@xmath40 and @xmath75 and are given in table 1 of ref .",
    "[ ] .    the expression in eq .  ( [ eq : ampl - bepm1 ] ) is to be compared with the leading - twist amplitude for the baryonic - form factor  @xcite @xmath76    the factors @xmath77 are very similar to the @xmath70 obtained here .",
    "however , the integration domain is different . in the form factor case",
    "@xmath78 consequently , the integration of denominators in @xmath79 such as @xmath80 do not generate any imaginary parts . on the contrary",
    ", the integrations of similar denominators in @xmath81 and @xmath82 over the tda integration domain will generate an imaginary part when passing from the erbl region ( all @xmath83 ) to one of the dglap regions ( one @xmath84 ) .",
    "this will be the source of the ssa as we will show later on .",
    "in order to study a possible ssa we shall study the quantity @xmath85 with the definition @xmath86    since we are interested in the leading twist contribution of this asymmetry , we can sum only over the transverse polarisation of the virtual photon using @xmath87 .",
    "the sum on the final - proton spin @xmath88 is done using @xmath89 .",
    "as regards the initial - proton spinor , one uses the following relation involving its transverse spin @xmath90 , @xmath91 .      dropping the contributions proportional to the proton mass , the spin asymmetry reads ( @xmath93 ) @xmath94 comparing with the expressions for the unpolarised cross section obtained in ref .",
    ", one concludes that the asymmetry for the hard - parton induced contribution is leading - twist as soon as @xmath95 and @xmath96 or @xmath97 are no longer pure real or pure imaginary numbers .",
    "this is precisely what one expects when dglap contributions are taken into account@xcite .",
    "although the knowledge of _ baryon to meson _ tdas has recently improved significantly thanks to a first study in the meson cloud model  @xcite and another one focused on their spectral representations@xcite , model - independent observables aimed at studying the backward regime of meson electroproduction will still be the bread - and - butter of this field for the months to come .    in this context , we find it particularly relevant to emphasize that the study of the asymmetry of the target transverse spin would reveal unique information on the nature of the particles exchanged in the @xmath0 channel , be it a `` mere '' baryon slightly off - shell , or three perturbative quarks . for non - vanishing transverse momenta ( @xmath52 ) ,",
    "one expects in the latter case an asymmetry of the same order as the unpolarised cross section , while , in the former case , they would be most likely decreasing for increasing @xmath9 and @xmath7 .",
