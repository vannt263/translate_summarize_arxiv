    "the johnson equation ( je ) @xmath2 @xmath3 or the cylindrical kadomtsev - petviashvili equation , is the analogue of the well - known cylindrical korteweg - de vries equation @xmath4 in two spatial dimensions ( 2d ) .",
    "the je was obtained firstly in j under the description of the surface waves on a shallow incompressible liquid .",
    "later it was shown that it describes the propagation of waves in the stratified media l. it follows from the derivation of ( ) that the correct statement of the cauchy problem is possible only as @xmath5 .    in lms and ms the equivalence of the kadomtsev - petviashvili equation ( kp ) and",
    "the je was established .",
    "let @xmath6 be an arbitrary solution of the kp @xmath7 then the function @xmath8 satisfies the je .",
    "this mapping @xmath9 is invertible .",
    "each solution @xmath10 of the je generates a solution of the kp by the formula @xmath11 it was shown in lms that mappings ( ) and ( ) preserve the class of functions rapidly decaying at infinity ( as @xmath12 ) , and all the results obtained in the theory of the kp in the corresponding class of solutions can be directly applied to solve the johnson equation .",
    "the situation is similar for the solutions involving the airy functions ( see m and n ) .",
    "obviously this is not the fact for periodic initial data , which are not invariant with respect to this transformation , and investigation of the je is an independent interesting problem in this case ( for the kp see the corresponding theory , for example , in kri - m3 ) .",
    "we are interested in the construction of a class of je - i ( @xmath13 in ( ) ) non - decaying solutions , which are bounded for all @xmath14 and vanish as @xmath15 for all fixed @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "such a kind of kp solutions was constructed and investigated firstly for kp - ii in akk , a3 , and then for kp - i in a1-a2 .",
    "it turns out that all basic stages of the construction of the solutions of the kp and the je , and the study of their asymptotic behaviour admit mutual recounting using the described mapping .",
    "we apply the change of variables @xmath18 to the scheme of the v.e.zakharov and a.b.shabat `` dressing method '' zs of integration of the kp , and obtain analogous formulas for the je . using them we prove the existence of a class of je - i non - decaying solutions with the prescribed properties . the simplest one is the one - soliton solution @xmath19}\\ ] ] @xmath20 , @xmath21 which corresponds to the kp plane - soliton by virtue of ( )",
    ".    then we study the asymptotic behaviour of the constructed solution as @xmath1 .",
    "the investigations of long - time asymptotic behaviour of non - decaying solutions of 2d non - linear evolution equations is closely connected with the same investigations in one spatial dimension . a.v.gurevich and l.p.pitaevsky studied in 1973 a non - decaying solution of the korteweg  de vries ( kdv ) equation , which describes the evolution of an initial step  function ( gp1,gp2 ) .",
    "they applied whitham method to construct an approximation of this solution by a knoidal wave with slowly varying parameters and detected the appearance of many strong oscillations like solitons on the front of the solution for a large time .",
    "this approximate solution satisfies the kdv ",
    "equation with error vanishing as @xmath22 .",
    "the mathematical ground of this phenomenon was done in 1975 by e.ya.khruslov in kh1 and kh2 , where the nature of these solitons was explained . subsequently these solitons were called asymptotic solitons . an analogous phenomenon of splitting of non - decaying initial data into infinite series of solitons",
    "was proved later for other kdv  like equations ( nonlinear schrdinger equation , sine  gordon equation , modified kdv and the toda lattice as a discrete analogue of the kdv ) ( kk  abe ) .    in akk ",
    "a2 the method proposed by e.ya.khruslov ( kh1,kh2 ) was extended to the investigation of the asymptotic behaviour of non - decaying solutions of kp - type equations ( kp , modified kp - i and 2d - gardner equation ) as @xmath1 .",
    "it was proved that they are represented as infinite series of solitons with curved lines of constant phase in the neighbourhood of the front as @xmath1 .",
    "these asymptotic solitons were called curved asymptotic solitons . note that recently ( z ) v.e.zakharov also considered a curved soliton of the kp - ii equation ,",
    "but in another space  time domain .",
    "our principal goal is to prove the phenomenon of splitting of non - decaying solutions of the je - i into infinite series of solitons as @xmath1 .",
    "we prove that there exist non - decaying real solutions of the je - i , which split in the neighbourhood of the front into a series of solitons of the form @xmath23 } } , \\l{vn}\\ ] ] which depend on two parameters @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the functions @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are completely determined by them .",
    "these solitons are diverged with the velocity @xmath29 .",
    "they have varying amplitude and width in the general case , but we present also examples where amplitude and width are constant . in these cases",
    "curved and weakly curved asymptotic solitons are both constructed .",
    "the lines of constant phase of the weakly curved solitons are deviated from the straight line just on a value proportional to @xmath30 .",
    "asymptotic solitons ( ) of the je - i and the kp - i ( a1 , a12 ) coincide taking into account transformations ( ) and ( ) .",
    "after application of the change of variables @xmath18 to the scheme of the v.e.zakharov and a.b.shabat `` dressing method '' zs of integration of the kp we obtain the following formulas for the je . a je solution has the form @xmath31 where the function @xmath32 is a solution of the marchenko integral equation @xmath33 this equation is an equation with respect to @xmath34 and @xmath35 are parameters .",

    "the correspondence of ( ) - ( ) to the je can be verified by a direct method , described in as for the kp . the scheme ( ) - ( )",
    "do nt allow us to solve the cauchy problem for je , but it is rather convenient for the construction of classes of solutions with various properties , in particular , of rapidly decaying rational solutions described in m and of non - decaying solutions .",
