    "in the survey paper @xcite the authors present some results for weakly coupled systems in one and two space dimensions but state concerning strongly coupled convection - diffusion problems , , we have only a limited grasp of the situation  .",
    "we aim to provide an inside into the nature of such problems at least in some special cases .",
    "a practical example of strongly coupled systems of convection - diffusion equations in 2d ( related to magnetohydrodynamic duct flow ) is numerically studied in @xcite , namely @xmath0 with some boundary conditions .",
    "let us more generally consider the vector - valued function @xmath1 solving the system    [ ( 1 ) ] @xmath2    where @xmath3 is a small positive parameter .",
    "we assume the matrices @xmath4 to be symmetric and @xmath5 and that the unit outer normal @xmath6 to @xmath7 exists a.e .  on @xmath8 .",
    "because @xmath9 with @xmath10 it is standard to assume @xmath11 then , problem admits a unique weak solution .    to describe the reduced problem we introduce the matrix @xmath12 suppose @xmath13 to be nonsingular , i.e. , @xmath8 to be noncharacteristic .",
    "then @xmath13 allows the decomposition @xmath14 where @xmath15 is positive semidefinite , @xmath16 negative semidefinite and the eigenvalues of @xmath15 are the positive eigenvalues of @xmath13 and @xmath17 . the reduced problem to is then given by @xmath18 in @xcite it was proved that @xmath19 converges for @xmath20 to @xmath21 .",
    "but concerning the convergence rate we only know the result of @xcite for a problem with different boundary conditions : for @xmath22 one has in the @xmath23 norm @xmath24 in the literature not much is known about the structure of layers . in the next section we will discuss this question in , at least , some special cases and consider problems with two small parameters , as well .",
    "let us first revisit the situation in 1d studied in @xcite .",
    "we take the example @xmath25 with @xmath26 . in the one parameter case",
    "the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of @xmath27 determine the asymptotic structure of the solution . here , the eigenvalues are 5 and -5 with the corresponding eigenvectors @xmath28 and @xmath29 . with that knowledge and the general solution of the reduced equation we made in @xcite the ansatz @xmath30",
    "the four constants @xmath31 are computed from the boundary conditions .",
    "eliminating all exponentially small terms one gets indirectly the solution of the reduced problem , for our example @xmath32 observe that @xmath21 does not satisfy either of the given boundary conditions .",
    "an alternative approach consists in the diagonalization of the matrix @xmath27 .",
    "set @xmath36 after transformation @xmath37 is a diagonal matrix , we obtain a decoupled system in @xmath38 . in our example , @xmath39 generates      > from the sign of the coefficients of the first order derivatives one can conclude where the layers of @xmath38 are located . in our example",
    "@xmath41 has a layer at @xmath42 , @xmath43 at @xmath44 .",
    "the back transformation yields :      the transformation technique can also be applied for special systems in two dimensions . let us assume that the constant matrices @xmath47 of the system admit the representation @xmath48 with the orthogonal matrix @xmath49 for some @xmath50 $ ] . remark that this is the case if and only if @xmath51 .",
    "that means : the sign of @xmath55 determines the location of the layers of @xmath41 , the sign of @xmath56 the location of the layers of @xmath43 .",
    "let us introduce @xmath57 and analogously @xmath58 .",
    "then , the conditions @xmath59 ( @xmath60 denotes the first row of @xmath61 ) are the correct boundary conditions for the reduced equation .      *",
    "\\(i ) all @xmath63 are positive + then @xmath45 and @xmath46 have overlapping layers at @xmath64 and at @xmath65 . *",
    "\\(ii ) only @xmath66 is negative + then we have again overlapping layers at @xmath65 , but ordinary layers of @xmath45 and @xmath46 at @xmath67 and at @xmath64 . *",
    "\\(iii ) both components of @xmath68 and @xmath69 have a different sign + then @xmath45 and @xmath46 have ordinary layers at every edge of the unit square .",
    "let us first collect some facts from @xcite for the one - dimensional system @xmath75 assume @xmath76 surprisingly , not the eigenvalues of @xmath13 generate the structure of the boundary layers .",
    "the layer at @xmath42 is characterized by the exponential @xmath77 , but the layer at @xmath44 by the exponential @xmath78 .",
    "the quantities @xmath79 and @xmath80 are quotients of the leading principal minors of the matrix @xmath13 .",
    "these values arise as well in the @xmath81 decomposition of the matrix @xmath13 .",
    "in accordance with that observation the authors of @xcite proposed to introduce new variables @xmath38 by @xmath82 resulting in @xmath83 with @xmath84 unfortunately , the matrix @xmath85 is not diagonal .",
    "but its structure @xmath86 tells us ( remember @xmath87 ) the following : assuming , for instance , @xmath88 and @xmath89 , both solution components have strong layers at @xmath42 of the structure @xmath90 .",
    "however , at @xmath44 a _ weak _ layer of @xmath91 of the structure @xmath92 generates a strong layer of @xmath41 and , consequently , @xmath45 . in @xcite",
    "this solution behavior was derived from some asymptotic approximation .",
    "the signs of @xmath93 also define the boundary conditions of the reduced problem , under our assumptions @xmath94 consider the example @xmath95 with @xmath26 . here",
    "@xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "consequently , in the case @xmath98 we conclude      in the one parameter case the decomposition allows to define the boundary conditions for the reduced problem . but with two parameters , for instance in 1d ,",
    "the matrix @xmath101 is not symmetric .",
    "symmetrization of that matrix with a transformation of the type @xmath102 and adequately chosen @xmath103 is possible .",
    "but it is simpler to apply the @xmath81 decomposition described above .",
    "@xmath104    the results for the two parameter problem can now be generalized to if we assume @xmath105 the transformation @xmath106 yields the system @xmath107 next we introduce as above @xmath108 with respect to the vectors @xmath109 . both components @xmath41 and @xmath43 as well as @xmath45 and @xmath46 have strong exponential layers related to @xmath110 on @xmath111 .",
    "but on @xmath112 the component @xmath91 has only a weak layer . that weak layer generates a strong layer of @xmath45 related to the larger parameter @xmath113 .",
    "summarizing : under some restrictive conditions it is possible to characterize the possible layers of strongly coupled convection - diffusion systems in 2d .",
    "moreover , the adequate boundary conditions for the reduced problem can be derived ( important for numerical methods which first solve the simpler reduced problem ) .",
