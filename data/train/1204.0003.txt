    "<S> detailed luttinger liquid calculations near boundaries exist , which predict corresponding wave - like modulations in the local dos and a sharp reduction of the dos near boundaries @xcite . however , it is far from clear if these signatures are robust in realistic lattice systems , since even minimalistic models like the hubbard chain are not perfect luttinger liquids . </S>",
    "<S> the two main reasons for possible discrepancies are that first of all the assumed degeneracy of spin and charge modes in the low energy spectrum can never be exact and will be lifted by band curvature and other effects . </S>",

    "<S> the fit parameters for @xmath84 with @xmath85 are outside the range what would normally be expected for a spin chain model @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the particular form of the observed corrections remains a puzzle .    nonetheless , the results of the logarithmic corrections have interesting consequences . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the corrections are so large , that the boundary exponent @xmath86 may become negative if @xmath87 , i.e.  @xmath88 to lowest order in the correction , which is indeed the case for small @xmath89 at @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> this results in an _ increase _ of the local dos for small energies @xmath1 and small distances @xmath4 near the boundary , which is described by a weak powerlaw divergence @xmath90 . </S>",
    "<S> such a negative boundary exponent would also explain the recently observed anomalies in the boundary behavior for small interactions in functional renormalization group studies @xcite .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have analyzed the local dos of the hubbard model in the low energy regime . </S>",
    "<S> individual states can be classified by separate spin- and charge quantum numbers . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that typically only one eigenstate contributes the overwhelming majority of the local dos in each spin / charge mode . </S>",
    "<S> the spin and charge luttinger parameters @xmath74 and @xmath75 can be extracted from the modulations in the local dos of individual excited states . while the charge parameter @xmath75 agrees well with the bethe ansatz , the spin luttinger liquid parameter is attractive @xmath91 due to large finite size corrections , which can only be neglected for exponentially long chain lengths . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the corrections to @xmath74 are unexpectedly strong and may even lead to negative boundary exponents for moderate interactions @xmath92 . </S>",
    "<S> the common assumption that it is possible to generically use @xmath71 due to su(2 ) invariance is certainly not justified for the local dos . in particular , for finite wires on conducting substrates the interactions may be reduced by screening , so that the charge luttinger liquid parameter @xmath75 may be close to one , while the spin luttinger liquid parameters @xmath74 can already be significantly increased , which leads to a negative boundary exponent . </S>",
    "<S> this would have quite dramatic consequences , since the dos near the boundary determines the tunneling between connected wires and the renormalization of the conductivity through impurities @xcite , which will show an increase at low temperatures in this scenario .    </S>",
