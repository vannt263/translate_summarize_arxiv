    "more than ten years after the first measurements by the cdf collaboration of the _ direct _ production of @xmath1 and @xmath3 at @xmath4 tev  @xcite we are still facing disagreements between theoretical predictions from the various available models and experimental studies of the cross section and the polarisation from the tevatron and rhic ( for reviews see  @xcite ) .",
    "cdf  @xcite recently confirmed their previous polarisation measurement  @xcite showing an unpolarised or slightly longitudinally polarised prompt @xmath1 yield .",
    "this has reinforced the doubts cast on the dominance of the colour octet mechanism ( com ) coming from the application of nrqcd  @xcite . at the same time , many new results became available , _",
    "e.g. _  the long - awaited nlo qcd corrections to the csm  @xcite showing significant enhancement of the cross section , an up - to - date proof  @xcite of nrqcd factorisation ; an improved treatment of nrqcd factorisation in fragmentation regions where three heavy quarks have similar momenta  @xcite and last but not least a recent evaluation of the dominant @xmath5 ( nnlo )  @xcite correction to @xmath6 production , the latter solving the longstanding conflict between the experimental measurements from the tevatron at _ mid and large _",
    "@xmath2  @xcite and the prediction from the csm  @xcite .",
    "considering that none of the existing theoretical approaches could reproduce all available experimental data , we undertook in  @xcite a systematic study of the cut contributions due to off - shell and non - static quarks .",
    "in particular , we questioned the assumption of the csm that takes the heavy quarks forming the quarkonium ( @xmath7 ) as being on - shell  @xcite .",
    "if they are not , the usual @xmath0-channel cut contributes to the imaginary part of the amplitude and need to be considered on the same footing as the csm cut .",
    "current conservation for such off - shell configuration responsible for the @xmath0-channel cut imposes the introduction of an additional four - point function , or contact current  @xcite , accounting for the interactions between the @xmath8 pair emitting the external gluon .",
    "in fact , this mechanism arises because of the possibility that the outgoing gluon is emitted by the particle interacting in the dressed @xmath9 vertex ( see figure  [ fig : illus_gi_break ] ( a ) ) , as depicted in figure  [ fig : illus_gi_break ] ( b ) .",
    "the pair of on - shell quarks that makes the final @xmath1-gluon state is now in a colour - octet state which thus recovers the necessity for such configurations as a natural consequence of restoring gauge invariance .",
    "although current conservation imposes the introduction of such a 4-point vertex , it does not enable to relate it univocally to the 3-point one . yet",
    ", there exist certain minimal requirements  @xcite which such a 4-point function should satisfy .",
    "the 4-point function proposed in  @xcite provided a conserved current but was not entirely satisfactory since it contained poles ( by construction similar to the basic direct and crossed contributions ) , and such poles for the contact current are unphysical and therefore should be avoided  @xcite .",
    "another caveat to avoid was formerly identified by drell and lee  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the minimal substitution prescription @xmath10 ( @xmath11 : charge , @xmath12 : vector potential ) in an effective lagrangian corresponding to the dressed hadronic vertex is deficient in that it violates the high - energy scaling behaviour , because in avoiding poles for the 4-point function , it partially replaces the true momentum dependence of the vertices by constants .",
    "such an issue can be easily avoided in the approach which we shall follow and which was applied to pion photoproduction processes  @xcite .",
    "as we shall show in the following , it is hence possible to build a 4-point vertex encompassing two limiting behaviours , when the final - state gluon is soft or hard  @xcite . in turn",
    ", we shall show that this enables to reproduce experimental data from the tevatron up to mid @xmath2 by adjusting the unconstrained parameters of the 4-point vertex and hence to get a remarkable agreement with data from rhic down to low @xmath2 .",
    "we shall follow the approach developed in  @xcite , where the transition @xmath13 is described by the 3-point function @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the total and relative momenta , respectively , of the two quarks bound as a quarkonium state , with @xmath17 and @xmath18 being their individual four - momenta .",
    "ansatz ( [ vf ] ) amounts to representing the vector meson as a massive photon with a non - local coupling .",
    "the generic picture of the physical origin of the dressed vertex function @xmath19 is given in figure  [ fig : illus_gi_break](a ) . in the present work ,",
    "we describe the relative - momentum distribution @xmath19 of the quarks phenomenologically as a gaussian form , function of the square of the relative c.m .",
    "3-momentum @xmath20 of the quarks , which can be written in a lorentz invariant form as @xmath21 .",
    "explicitly , we have @xmath22 with a normalisation @xmath23 fixed by the leptonic - decay width  @xcite and a size parameter @xmath24 , which can be obtained from studies in relativistic quark models  @xcite .      instead of directly employing the generalised ward ",
    "takahashi relations  @xcite for the complete current , we will rather make use of an equivalent condition for the contact current similarly to what was done in  @xcite in the pion - photoproduction case .",
    "first let us write the 4-point function depicted in figure  [ fig : illus_gi_break](b ) as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the strong coupling constant , @xmath27 the colour matrix , and @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the lorentz indices of the outgoing @xmath1 and gluon , respectively . for simplicity",
    ", we have suppressed all indices on the left - hand side .",
    "the @xmath9 vertex function @xmath30 with the kinematics of the direct graph is denoted here by @xmath31 and for the crossed graph by @xmath32 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , as shown in figures .",
    "[ fig : jpsibox](a ) and ( b ) .",
    "the gauge - invariance condition for the contact current @xmath35 for the outgoing gluon with momentum @xmath36 reads now @xmath37    the contact current can be now constructed as usual  @xcite in terms of an auxiliary function @xmath38 which contains the remaining unconstrained degrees of freedom of the problem .",
    "this gives @xmath39 where we take @xmath40 and @xmath41 from the beginning , with @xmath42 and @xmath43 being the masses of the quark and the @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "one easily verifies that this additional contact current satisfies the gauge - invariance condition ( [ gipcond ] ) .",
    "@xmath44 has now to be chosen so that the current ( [ mc ] ) satisfies crossing symmetry ( _ i.e. _ , symmetry under the exchange @xmath45 ) and is free of singularities .",
    "defining the constant @xmath46 as the ( unphysical ) value of the momentum distribution @xmath19 when all three legs of the vertex are on their respective mass shells , we should then have @xmath47 when @xmath48 or @xmath49 .    a priori , @xmath50 everywhere should be satisfactory .",
    "however , this corresponds to the minimal substitution discussed by drell and lee  @xcite and later by ohta  @xcite . as we mentioned above",
    ", this does not provide the correct scaling properties at large energies , which means within the present context that @xmath50 would not lead to the expected @xmath2 scaling of the amplitude .",
    "numerically , this choice overshoots the experimental data by more than one order of magnitude at @xmath51 gev as shown on  figure  [ fig : dsdpt - gamma_0 ] .",
    "to avoid such abnormal scaling behaviour , we have to impose , in the large relative - momentum region , that the contact term and therefore the function @xmath44 exhibit a fall - off similar to the 3-point vertex functions .",
    "the simplest crossing - symmetric choice satisfying this property is  @xcite @xmath52 the solution we propose here is to build @xmath44 from these two limiting cases : @xmath53    to this end , it is practical to choose the following simple ansatz @xmath54 where the ( crossing - symmetric ) function @xmath55 rises to become unity for large relative momentum .",
    "note that @xmath56 at the poles is satisfied independently of @xmath55 .",
    "indeed , it is multiplied on the right by a factor which vanishes at the poles since either @xmath57 or @xmath58 . a phenomenological choice for the interpolating function @xmath55 we",
    "can then propose is @xmath59 with two parameters , @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "this choice is in no way unique : in a manner of speaking , this choice is simply a way of parameterising our ignorance by employing minimal properties of @xmath62 .",
    "other choices could be analysed but our conclusions , that @xmath0-channel cut contribution can be large and can indeed help to reproduce the experimental data , would not be affected .",
    "for the tevatron and rhic kinematics , the direct @xmath1 are produced by gluon fusion and a final - state gluon emission is required to conserve @xmath63-parity and provide the @xmath1 with its @xmath2 .",
    "the relevant diagrams for the @xmath0-channel cut of the lo gluon fusion process are shown on  figure  [ fig : jpsibox ] .",
    "we use the same normalisation of @xmath30 as in  @xcite , @xmath64 gev and @xmath65 gev .",
    "as shown in  @xcite , @xmath24 can be varied between 1.2 and 2.2 gev without affecting much the results .",
    "the same statement holds here .    the partonic differential cross section obtained from the amplitude calculated from our model ( see  @xcite for details ) is summed over the gluon polarisations , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the squared polarised partonic amplitude for @xmath68 averaged only over colour for polarised cross sections",
    ". here , @xmath69 , @xmath36 , @xmath70 and @xmath0 are the helicities of the respective particles , and @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the mandelstam variables for the partonic process .",
    "the relation to the double - differential polarised cross section in transverse momentum @xmath2 and rapidity @xmath74 then is given by @xmath75 in the present calculations , we use the lo gluon distribution @xmath76 of  @xcite .     and",

    "figure  [ fig : cross - sections_cdf ] shows our results with parameter values @xmath80 and @xmath81gev for @xmath4 tev in the pseudorapidity range @xmath82 .",
    "the values of @xmath60 and @xmath61 were chosen to reproduce the cross - section measurement of direct @xmath1 by cdf  @xcite up to about @xmath83 gev . at higher",
    "@xmath2 , our curve falls below the data as expected from the genuine @xmath84 scaling of a lo box diagram .",
    "we expect higher - order corrections incorporating fragmentation - type topologies ( @xmath85 )  @xcite and associated - production channels to fill the gap between data and theory at high @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "figures  [ fig : cross - sections_rhic ] show our results at @xmath77gev , still with @xmath80 and @xmath81gev , compared with the phenix data yield , whereas our computation is for the _ direct _ yield . for the phenix kinematics ,",
    "the @xmath86 feeddown can be safely neglected . to what concerns the feeddown from @xmath87",

    "@xmath1 polarisation measurements at the tevatron exist only for the prompt yield , we have thus computed @xmath88 from our direct-@xmath1 cross sections in two extreme cases , one where the @xmath1 s from @xmath87 are 100% transverse and another where they are 100% longitudinal , the first scenario being the more likely one .",

    "in  @xcite , we showed that there exist two singularities contributing to the imaginary part of the amplitude for @xmath90 .",
    "the first can be identified to the csm contribution when the static limit is taken ( no relative momentum between quarks ) .",
    "the second can be referred to as an @xmath0-channel cut and was never considered before  @xcite .    to deal with such configurations , we have to introduce a four - point function @xmath91 , complementing the information given by the three - point function ( or bethe - salpeter amplitude ) @xmath92 .",
    "such a four - point function is a priori constrained by a low - energy limit ( when the emitted gluon is soft ) and a scaling limit ( when the emitted gluon is hard ) .",
    "given those two physical constraints , we constructed a four - point functions exhibiting a dependence only on two parameters , which we fixed to reproduce the tevatron measurements up to mid @xmath2 .",
    "we then used the latter to compute the cross section for the rhic kinematics , for which we obtained a striking agreement with phenix data .",
    "this agreement can be employed  @xcite to investigate on the kinematical effects attributable to the final - state - gluon emission in studies of shadowing effects on @xmath1 production in @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 collisions , in the spirit of the study  @xcite .",
    "our prediction for the polarisation for the prompt @xmath1 yield at mid @xmath2 at the tevatron is mostly longitudinal .    in the com ,",
    "colour - octet matrix elements account for transitions between a coloured heavy - quark pair into a quarkonium by soft unseen gluon emissions in the final state . in the present approach ,",
    "the 4-point function accounts for gluon exchanges between the heavy quarks emitting the final - state gluon . as for the matrix elements of nrqcd , which are unknown and then fit",
    ", we fixed the unconstrained parameters of this function in order to reproduce the experimental data at @xmath4 tev from the cdf collaboration at the tevatron for @xmath96 gev .",
    "contrary to usual results obtained with lo calculations , our approach agrees with data down to very low values of the transverse momentum without need of resummation of initial - state gluon effects .",
    "this feature could be attributed to the threshold associated with the cut in the @xmath0-channel and should be analysed in more details in the future .    before drawing further conclusions ,",
    "several points have to be addressed : firstly , the size of the real part of the amplitude has to be evaluated .",
    "when fixing the parameter of our four - point function to describe the tevatron data we have implicitly assumed that such a real part was small ; this has to verified .",
    "secondly , the four - point function we proposed here has to be applied to other regimes of production : a similar enhancement by inclusion of the @xmath0-channel cut is expected in all production processes where the @xmath1 is associated with a gluon , _",
    "e.g. _ ,  photon - photon collision at lep as well as in photo- and lepto - production at hera . on the other hand ,",
    "other observables insensitive to the com or the @xmath0-channel cut  and thus to the ambiguity attached to the description of the four - point function should be studied in the future , especially at the lhc . to conclude ,",
    "let us mention two promising new observables , @xmath1 production in association with a @xmath97 pair  @xcite and the hadronic activity around the @xmath1  @xcite .",
