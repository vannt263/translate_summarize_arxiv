    "the investigation of the impact of the environment on multi - partite entangled systems has brought out some subtle aspects of entanglement",
    ". its time - dependent behavior can be much different from that of the decay of the populations of the individual parts , or of the coherence between them .",
    "in fact , it has been demonstrated theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite that entanglement may vanish much before coherence disappears .",
    "linear optical devices have been shown to be a powerful tool for the investigation of this phenomenon @xcite . by associating the polarization degrees of freedom with qubits , and the momentum degrees of freedom with the environment ,",
    "one has been able to realize experiments that probe the dynamics of entanglement of qubit systems interacting independently with individual environments , which , as an added bonus , can be tailored at will and continuously monitored .",
    "in particular ,  entanglement sudden death \" @xcite was demonstrated @xcite , and the evolution of a qubit under continuous monitoring of the environment was investigated @xcite .",
    "the assumption of independent environments requires that the individual systems be sufficiently separated ; for atoms interacting with the reservoir of electromagnetic field modes , this would mean that they should be much farther apart than the wavelength of the resonant radiation . if this condition is not met , the interaction of the parts with a common environment may give rise to collective effects . in this case , the direct interaction between the individual systems may substantially affect the collective behavior of the system , as has been extensively discussed within the realm of superradiance @xcite : thus , for instance , when atoms get closer together , dipole interactions should be taken into account .",
    "in some situations , however , the direct interaction between the individual components of the system does not mask the effects of the interaction with a common environment .",
    "this is the case , for instance , in ion trap experiments , where neighboring ions may be subject to a common dephasing process . under these conditions , it is possible to protect the system against decoherence by defining logical qubits in decoherence - free subspaces @xcite , which have been experimentally demonstrated with twin - photon beams @xcite , nuclear magnetic resonance @xcite , and trapped ions @xcite .",
    "a common environment may entangle initially separable states @xcite , even when it is in a thermal state @xcite .",
    "two problems arise however in possible experimental demonstrations of this property : this effect can be masked by the direct interaction between the individual parts of the system and it may be difficult to prepare the qubits in arbitrary individual states due to their proximity .    here",
    "we show that an all - optical setup that combines different degrees of freedom of a single photon can be used to investigate the role of a common environment in the generation of entanglement between two non - interacting qubits , which can be prepared in independent individual states at will .",
    "polarization and transverse mode degrees of freedom of the photon stand for the two qubits , and the photon path is the environment .",
    "coupling between the qubits and the environment is achieved with linear optics devices .",
    "the use of multiple degrees of freedom of photons , while not leading to scalable quantum computation @xcite , has allowed the study of basic quantum algorithms @xcite , quantum teleportation @xcite , entanglement purification @xcite , improved bell - state analysis @xcite , creation of high - dimensional entanglement @xcite , demonstration of direct methods for measuring entanglement  @xcite , engineering of mixed states through decoherence @xcite , quantum key distribution @xcite , measurement of a topological phase @xcite and the investigation of the environment - induced dynamics of entangled systems @xcite .    our proposed setup is divided into two parts .",
    "the first one describes the action of a common environment acting on the two qubits ; the second analyses the generated state through the measurement of an entanglement witness , which has a peculiar and very useful property : it is time - independent , so the same setup can be used , as the environment - induced transition probability ranges from zero ( corresponding to the initial time ) to one .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : theoretical model ]",
    "we present the master equation that describes the interaction of an ensemble of qubits with a common environment .",
    "the corresponding unitary map , essential for building the experiment , is introduced in section [ sec : unitary map ] . in section [ sec : entanglement measurement ] we present the single observable that allows for a direct measurement of entanglement , thus avoiding the cumbersome process of tomography @xcite .",
    "the proposed experiment , using a linear optical setup , which leads to entanglement creation , plus the measurement circuit to quantify it , are presented in section [ sec : experiment ] . in section",
    "[ sec : generalization of the model ] we show that the same optical circuit can be used to probe the coherent interaction between two two - level systems and a single - mode environment .",
    "the conclusions are presented in section [ sec : conclusion ] . in the appendix",
    "we derive the kraus operators from the master equation describing the interaction of two qubits with a common environment .",
    "we consider a system of @xmath0 identical qubits interacting with a common zero - temperature environment .",
    "the state of each qubit is represented in the basis @xmath1 , where we take @xmath2 to be the excited state and @xmath3 the ground state .",
    "the state @xmath2 decays into the state @xmath3 , producing one excitation in the environment .",
    "we may associate to qubit @xmath4 the pauli operator @xmath5 and the ladder operators @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the collective interaction between the qubits and the infinite modes of a bosonic reservoir is described in the rotating - wave approximation by the hamiltonian @xmath8 , \\label{eq1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the coupling constant ( taken to be real ) , @xmath10 is the transition frequency between the two qubit levels , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the annihilation and creation operators corresponding to mode @xmath13 with frequency @xmath14 .",
    "here we have neglected the spatial dependence of the coupling .",
    "the interaction of the qubits with the common environment is mediated by the collective operators @xmath15 .",
    "the dynamical evolution of the qubit system can be described by a master equation , which in the interaction picture , under the usual born - markov approximation , and neglecting the direct interaction between the qubits , is given by @xcite : @xmath16,\\nonumber\\\\ \\label{lindblad}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the density matrix of the system and the spontaneous decay rate @xmath18 is proportional to the square of the coupling constant evaluated at the transition frequency @xmath10 .",
    "thus , for instance , for a two - level atom interacting with the electromagnetic field , one may take @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the wave vector corresponding to a plane - wave mode and @xmath21 is the corresponding polarization index .",
    "then , @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the quantization volume , @xmath24 is a polarization vector , and @xmath25 is the transition dipole moment",
    ". then @xmath26 . in the following ,",
    "we specialize our discussion to two - qubit systems .",
    "the interaction of a system @xmath27 with an environment @xmath28 can be described in terms of a unitary evolution encompassing the system and the environment together : @xmath29 where @xmath30 @xmath31 are orthogonal states of the system , @xmath32 are orthogonal states of the environment , and @xmath33 are the so - called kraus operators @xcite , acting only on the states of the system @xmath27 , and satisfying @xmath34    as stressed in @xcite , the map ( [ unitarymap ] ) is actually more general than the master equation ( [ lindblad ] ) , which is obtained from it , when the environment has many degrees of freedom , under markovian and differentiability assumptions @xcite .",
    "the kraus operators corresponding to eq .",
    "( [ lindblad ] ) are obtained in the appendix , using the choi matrix formalism @xcite . substituting the resulting kraus operators ( [ kraus0]-[kraus2 ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ unitarymap ] ) , we get , in the collective basis @xmath35 : @xmath36 are time - dependent coefficients explicitly calculated in the appendix and the states of the environment are labelled so as to highlight their physical meaning in terms of the number of excitations , i.e. , @xmath37 corresponds to the vacuum state , @xmath38 and @xmath39 to states with just a single excitation and @xmath40 to a state with two excitations in the environment .",
    "this set of equations has an immediate physical interpretation : each coefficient represents the probability amplitude of transition between the qubit states as a function of time , either the qubits emitting excitations into the environment , which is initially in the vacuum state , or exchanging excitations between them , or yet not emitting any excitation at all , when both system and environment remain in the same state .",
    "for instance , in the first line , where both qubits are initially in the excited state @xmath41 , we have a probability amplitude a that both qubits remain in the excited state , with no excitation being emitted into the environment , which remains in the vacuum state @xmath37 . on the other hand , there is a probability amplitude b(d ) that a single qubit decays , the state of the system going to a superposition of @xmath42 and @xmath43 with just one excitation being transferred to the environment , which goes to state @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "finally there is a probability amplitude f that both qubits decay to @xmath44 emitting two photons into the environment , whose state becomes @xmath40 .",
    "similar reasonings can be applied to the other lines of the map .",
    "we note , in eq .",
    "( [ mapa0 ] ) , the appearance of two orthogonal environment states with just a single excitation , @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "this can be understood physically by rewriting eq .",
    "( [ mapa0 ] ) as : @xmath45 and @xmath46 are non - orthogonal states of the environment with a single excitation given by : @xmath47 the explanation for the presence of two different states with a single excitation in the first and second lines of eq .",
    "( [ mapa1 ] ) stems from the consideration of the photon emission process for the initial states @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively .",
    "the rate of photon emission for the two qubits is given by @xcite : @xmath50    calculating this rate for the initial states @xmath48 and @xmath49 we get : @xmath51    the rate corresponding to @xmath48 is exactly the one we would expect from two independent qubits .",
    "this implies that in this case the first photon emitted would have a linewitdh of @xmath18 .",
    "the decay rate of the single excited qubit in the state @xmath49 is twice that of each qubit in @xmath48 , so this state is superradiant and the linewidth of the emitted photon is expected to be @xmath52 .",
    "as we have two different linewidths for the photons emitted from the initial states @xmath48 and @xmath49 , this explains why we have two different environment states corresponding to a single excitation , @xmath53 and @xmath46 in the first and the second line of eq .",
    "( [ mapa1 ] ) , respectively .    in terms of the computational basis @xmath54 , eq .",
    "( [ mapa0 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 .",
    "the new single - excitation states @xmath61 and @xmath62 are related to orthogonal states of the environment @xmath63 and @xmath64 by : @xmath65 where @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 are time - dependent coefficients defined in the appendix .    as shown in section [ sec : experiment ] , eq .",
    "( [ mapa2 ] ) leads to a simple linear optics demonstration of environment - induced entanglement .",
    "a detailed analysis of the generation of entanglement between two atoms via spontaneous emission , with dipole - dipole interaction , was presented by ficek and tana  @xcite .",
    "here we consider the special case in which the separation between the atoms is much smaller than the typical wavelength of the emitted radiation , and there is no dipole - dipole interaction .",
    "our expressions coincide with those in refs .",
    "@xcite in the proper limit .    for the quantification of entanglement we use the _ concurrence _",
    "@xcite , defined as : @xmath70 where : @xmath71 @xmath72 being the eigenvalues in decreasing order of the matrix : @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the two - qubit density matrix , @xmath75 is the second pauli matrix and the conjugation is performed in the computational basis .",
    "concurrence ranges from 0 , which corresponds to a separable state , to 1 which corresponds to a maximally entangled state .    if the system is initially in the separable state @xmath76 , then , by applying eq .",
    "( [ mapa2 ] ) and tracing over the states of the environment , we end up with the following state for the system : @xmath77    simple calculation shows that the concurrence for this state is given by @xmath78 this clearly shows that , although initially in a separable state , the system evolves to an entangled state , its concurrence reaching the maximum value of @xmath79 in the asymptotic regime @xmath80 .",
    "this entanglement is induced solely by an indirect interaction mediated by the common environment , since in the model considered here there is no direct interaction between the two qubits .",
    "therefore , in order to observe the creation of entanglement it suffices to implement experimentally the second ( or third ) line of eq .",
    "( [ mapa2 ] ) .    the emergence of entanglement in this case can be qualitatively understood by considering that the initial separable state @xmath81 can be expressed as a superposition of the singlet @xmath82 and triplet @xmath49 bell states @xcite : @xmath83 one can trivially see from eq .",
    "( [ lindblad ] ) that the singlet state does not evolve . on the other hand",
    ", the triplet state decays asymptotically to the ground state .",
    "so as time approaches to infinity we end up with the following mixed state : @xmath84 the concurrence of the above state is easily calculated to be @xmath79 , in accordance with the asymptotic limit of eq .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) , the contribution for entanglement coming from the maximally - entangled singlet state in eq .",
    "( [ rhoest ] ) .",
    "one should note that for two closely - spaced atoms , the initial state @xmath81 is usually difficult to prepare , since it does not have the same symmetry as the ground state under exchange of particles , and the interactions with external fields are symmetrical , as the interaction with the environment .    on the other hand , if both qubits are initially excited , i.e , @xmath85 , which is in principle simpler to prepare , one should not expect to have asymptotic entanglement , since this initial state does not have a singlet component .",
    "the question remains however whether transient entanglement might still occur . at intermediate times , according to the first line of eq .",
    "( [ mapa1 ] ) , the state of the system becomes a mixture of the initial state , the maximally - entangled state @xmath86 , and the state @xmath87 . in spite of the presence of the maximally - entangled component ( which eventually decays to @xmath87 ) ,",
    "the state remains separable for all times .",
    "indeed , the concurrence of @xmath17 is given by @xmath88 with @xmath89 as @xmath90 , no entanglement is generated in this case .",
    "the same conclusion is obtained from ref .",
    "@xcite when the distance between the atoms goes to zero  as shown in that reference , the dipole - dipole interaction does not play any role for this kind of initial state .",
    "we will thus concentrate on the state described by eq .",
    "( [ rhodete ] ) .",
    "even though this state is difficult to prepare in most systems , as commented above , this is not the case in the experiment proposed here , as will be shown in the next section .",
    "using this state has an important and useful consequence . instead of doing tomography @xcite for full reconstruction of the state , in order to determine the entanglement through eq .",
    "( [ concurrence ] ) , which would require measuring sixteen observables , we can define a time - independent _ entanglement witness _ - a unique observable that could be used to detect entanglement provided that we have some a priori knowledge about the states involved .    by definition , an entaglement witness @xmath69 is an observable that satisfies the following relations : @xmath91 for any separable state and @xmath92 for at least one entangled state , which is then said to be detected by the witness .",
    "for an arbitrary bipartite density matrix @xmath74 , an entanglement witness is given by @xcite : @xmath93 where u and v are unitary matrices obtained from the singular value decomposition of @xmath94 , @xmath95 being the partial transposition with respect to any one of the two qubits .",

    "@xcite . there ,",
    "the unitary quantum map corresponding to the evolution of a single decaying atom was described in terms of the decay probability @xmath101 , which is an exponential function of time .",
    "this allowed us to implement the decay dynamics through a static linear optics setup with a changeable parameter , namely the orientation @xmath102 of a half - wave plate , with @xmath103 .",
    "it also allows , from the theoretical point - of - view , to encompass different kinds of dynamics in the same map , since @xmath101 could also be considered to be an oscillating function of time , and in this case the quantum map would correspond to rabi oscillations of a two - level system interacting with a single mode .",
    "here we generalize this approach by parametrizing the evolution in terms of two fundamental probabilities : the probability that the first qubit decays emitting one excitation into the environment ; and the probability that the excitation goes from the environment to the second qubit .",

    "tuning the coupling constant , or rather the product @xmath176 , corresponds to tuning those two angles , according to the above equations .",
    "our setup encompasses therefore both the decay and the oscillatory case , as in the experiment reported in ref .",
    "this is a great advantage of our parametrization of the evolution of the system .",
    "similar circuits can be applied to analyze the dynamics of initially entangled states , which are easily prepared within the present framework .",
    "for instance , the state @xmath177 is obtained from the initial state @xmath81 by applying a half - wave plate to the polarization mode and the cnot circuit in fig .  [ globalmeasure ] in order to entangle the two degrees of freedom .",
    "the dynamics of the family of states @xmath178 under the action of a global environment is particularly rich , giving rise not only to the disappearance of entanglememt at finite times but also to entanglement revival .",
    "a detailed analysis was presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was shown that in this case the evolution of the density matrix elements is independent of the dipole - dipole interaction between the atoms .",
    "therefore , the results obtained from our model precisely coincide with those in ref .",
    "@xcite , in the limit when the distance between the two atoms goes to zero .",
    "in this work we propose a simple experiment , which uses only elementary linear optical devices , to observe creation of entanglement between two non - interacting qubits , induced by a common environment .",
    "we encode the two qubits and the environment into different degrees of freedom of a single photon : the polarization , the transverse modes , and the different paths stemming from different directions of the photon momentum .",
    "our experimental setup directly implements the unitary map that describes the time evolution of the system and the environment .",
    "we recover the dynamics of the two - qubit system by tracing over the path of the photon , which represents the environment .",
    "the evolution map is parametrized in terms of time - dependent transition probabilities , rather than time itself .",
    "this allows the investigation of the dynamics of entanglement through a static setup .",
    "it also follows from this parametrization that the same setup describes not only the collective interaction of two qubits with a zero - temperature bath , but also the reversible exchange of excitation between the two qubits and a single cavity mode .",
    "entanglement is quantified by a time - independent entanglement witness  a single observable  shown to be proportional to the concurrence for the states here considered .",
    "therefore , our proposed scheme to quantify entanglement does not require time - consuming tomographic measurements to determine the state of the system .",
    "the first step to obtain the kraus operators is to determine @xmath17 solving the lindblad equation ( [ lindblad ] ) . in the collective basis @xmath35 , which we denote by the indices @xmath179 , respectively , @xmath17 has the following elements : @xmath180    we define now the matrix @xmath181 as @xmath17 with the initial conditions @xmath182 .",
    "for example , @xmath183 is given by @xmath17 considering solely @xmath184 and all other coefficients equal to zero .",
    "using ( [ collectiveevolution ] ) we get : @xmath185          where @xmath189 are the normalized eigenvectors of c with eigenvalues @xmath190 , and @xmath191 are non - normalized vectors . in the present case",
    "we have just four non - null vectors @xmath192 , each one corresponding to a kraus operator . for convenience",
    "we designate @xmath193 .",
    "the final step is to divide each column matrix corresponding to @xmath192 into four segments of equal length .",
    "then the matrix representing kraus operator @xmath33 has the @xmath4th segment of @xmath192 as its @xmath4th column .",
    "we would like to thank fernando de melo , leandro aolita , marcelo frana santos , nicim zagury , ruynet lima de matos filho , and stephen p. walborn for discussions during the development of this work .",
    "the authors acknowledge financial support from the brazilian funding agencies cnpq , capes and faperj .",
    "this work was performed as part of the brazilian millennium institute for quantum information ."
