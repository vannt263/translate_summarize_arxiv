    "in this paper we study a model problem of homogenization for a discrete crystalline flow .",
    "the analysis will be carried over by using the minimizing - movement scheme of almgren , taylor and wang @xcite ( later thus renamed by de giorgi , see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "this consists in introducing a time scale @xmath1 , iteratively defining a sequence of sets @xmath2 as minimizers of @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a perimeter energy and @xmath5 is a ( suitably defined ) distance - type energy between sets , and @xmath6 is a given initial datum , and subsequently computing a time - continuous limit @xmath7 of @xmath8 as @xmath9 , which defines the desired geometric motion related to the energy  @xmath4 .",
    "the study of geometric motions in inhomogeneous environments has a very large literature ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the ones in a discrete setting can be considered a somewhat extreme case , in that the corresponding energies possess a large number of local minimizers ( actually , by the discrete nature of the problem all states are local minimizers ) , while on the contrary their continuum limits ( see e.g.  @xcite for a rigorous definition ) possess no local ( non global ) minimizer . as a consequence ,",
    "gradient flows tend to be `` pinned '' ( i.e. , the resulting limit @xmath7 is constant ) , in contrast with the formal evolution of their limit continuous energies , to which the almgren - taylor - wang approach can be used to obtain a non trivial evolution ( for the case of @xmath4 the crystalline perimeter in two dimensions see @xcite ) .    in a recent paper by braides , gelli and novaga @xcite the almgren - taylor - wang approach has been used coupled to a homogenization procedure . in this case",
    "the perimeters ( and the distances ) depend on a small parameter @xmath10 , and consequently , after introducing a time scale @xmath1 , the time - discrete motions are the @xmath11 defined iteratively by @xmath12 the time - continuous limit @xmath7 of @xmath13 then may depend how mutually @xmath10 and @xmath1 tend to @xmath14 .",
    "this type of problems can be cast in the general framework of _ minimizing movements along a @xmath0-converging sequence _",
    "( see @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , if we have a large number of local minimizers then the limit motion will be pinned if @xmath15 suitably fast ( in a sense , we can pass to the limit in @xmath1 first , and then apply the almgren - taylor - wang approach , which clearly gives pinning when the initial data are local minimizers ) . on the contrary , if @xmath16 fast enough and @xmath17 @xmath0-converge to a limit perimeter @xmath4 ( which is always the case by compactness ) , then the limit @xmath18 will be the evolution related to the limit @xmath4 ( again , in a sense , in this case we can pass to the limit in @xmath10 first ) .    in",
    "@xcite the energies @xmath17 are _ ferromagnetic energies _ defined on subsets @xmath19 , of the form @xmath20 ( @xmath21 a positive parameter ) .",
    "the continuum limit of these energies can be proved to be the crystalline perimeter @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the normal to @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the _ flat flow _ of this perimeter is the motion by crystalline curvature described by taylor @xcite . in the case of initial datum",
    "a coordinate rectangle , the evolution is a rectangle with the same centre and sides of lengths @xmath26 governed by the system of ordinary differential equations @xmath27    in @xcite all possible evolutions have been characterized as @xmath28 , showing that the relevant mutual scale is when @xmath29 . in the case of initial datum",
    "a coordinate rectangle the resulting evolution is still a rectangle . in the case of a unique evolution , the side - lengths @xmath30 of this rectangle",
    "are governed by a system of ` degenerate ' ordinary differential equations @xmath31 note that the right - hand sides are discontinuous ; however existence ( and uniqueness , except for some special cases ) of solution can be easily proved by a direct argument .",
    "this characterization highlights the effect of the periodicity through the scaling @xmath32 and that the motion is obtained by overcoming some energy barriers in a ` quantized ' manner by the presence of a discontinuous right - hand side .",
    "in particular , we have _ pinning of large rectangles _ : if both initial side - lengths are above the _ pinning threshold _ @xmath33 then the right - hand sides are zero and the motion is pinned .",
    "the limit cases ( total pinning and continuous crystalline flow ) correspond to the limit values @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "this analysis shows that the `` correct scaling '' for this problem is @xmath36 , which gives the most information about all the limit evolutions .",
    "the analysis described above exhibits a limit evolution in which we may read the effect of the @xmath0-limit energy ( through the crystalline form of the evolution and the coefficient @xmath37 ) and of the interplay between the time and space scales through the scaling @xmath32 .",
    "scope of this work is to show that in general the situation can be more complex , and the periodic microstructure can affect the limit evolution without changing the @xmath0-limit . to this end",
    "we will introduce a further inhomogeneity in the perimeters @xmath17 by considering @xmath38 ( we use the notation @xmath39 ) where the coefficients @xmath40 equal @xmath37 except for some well - separated periodic square inclusions where @xmath41 .",
    "these inclusions are not energetically favorable and they can be neglected in the computation of the @xmath0-limit , which is still the perimeter @xmath4 above , with the same coefficient @xmath37 .",
    "they can be considered as `` obstacles '' that can be bypassed when computing minimizers of @xmath17 ; however their presence is felt in the minimizing - movement procedure since they may influence the choice of @xmath11 through the interplay between the distance and perimeter terms . as a result , the motion can be either decelerated or accelerated with respect to the homogeneous case .    as already remarked in @xcite",
    "the relevant case for the description of the motion is that of initial data coordinate rectangles , since all other cases can be reduced to the study of this one .",
    "we will then restrict our analysis to that case .",
    "this ( apparently ) simple situation already contains all the relevant features of the evolution and highlights the differences with respect to @xcite .",
    "we will show that the limit motion can still be described through a system of degenerate ordinary differential equations of the form @xmath42 with @xmath43 a locally constant function on compact subsets of @xmath44 which depends on @xmath37 , the period and size of the inclusions but not on @xmath32 ( neither on the value @xmath45 ) .",
    "the _ effective velocity _",
    "@xmath43 is obtained by a homogenization formula which optimizes the motion of the sides of the rectangle , resulting in an oscillation around a linear motion with velocity @xmath46 ( which is locally constant as noted above ) .",
    "note that , in the case of no inclusion , the system is of the same form with @xmath47 .",
    "the dependence on the inclusions gives a new pinning threshold @xmath48 depending on the size of the inclusion @xmath49 .",
    "the reason for this new pinning threshold is that , in order that a side may move , it needs to be able to overcome a barrier of @xmath49 inclusions .",
    "note that , if the initial data have side - lengths @xmath50 , then we may have a microscopic motion which stops after a finite number of time steps , and is not eventually detected in the limit .",
    "it should be remarked that the presence of the inclusions may indeed accelerate the motion , so that @xmath51 for some @xmath52 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ setting ] we define all the energies that we will consider .",
    "we then formulate the discrete - in - time scheme analogous to the almgren , taylor and wang approach .",
    "section  [ rectangular ] contains the proof of the convergence of the discrete scheme in the case of a rectangular initial set .",
    "contrary to the case in @xcite it is not trivial to show that the minimizers of this scheme are actually rectangles .",
    "this is a technical result contained in proposition  [ rectangleprop ] .",
    "subsection  [ newpinning ] contains the computation of the new pinning threshold , showing that it depends on the percentage @xmath49 of defects in the lattice .",
    "subsection  [ newvelocity ] deals with the new definition of the effective velocity of a side by means of a homogenization formula resulting from a one - dimensional ` oscillation - optimization ' problem .",
    "this velocity can be expressed uniquely ( up possibly to a discrete set of values ) , as a function the ratio of @xmath32 and the side - length ( definition  [ effvel ] ) .",
    "the description of the homogenized limit motion is contained in subsection  [ limitmotion ] . in the last section 4 we",
    "explicitly compute the velocity function by means of algebraic formulas in some simple cases , showing a nontrivial comparison with the case with no inclusions .",
    "if @xmath53 we set @xmath54 and @xmath55 . if @xmath56 is a lebesguemeasurable set we denote by @xmath57 its twodimensional lebesgue measure .",
    "the symmetric difference of @xmath56 and @xmath58 is denoted by @xmath59 , their hausdorff distance by @xmath60 .",
    "if @xmath18 is a set of finite perimeter then @xmath61 is its reduced boundary ( see , for example @xcite ) .",
    "the measure - theoretical inner normal to @xmath18 at a point @xmath62 in @xmath61 is denoted by @xmath63 .",
    "the energies we consider are interfacial energies defined in an inhomogeneous environment as follows : let @xmath64 , @xmath65 and set @xmath66 .",
    "we consider the @xmath67-periodic coefficients @xmath40 indexed on _ nearest - neighbours _ of @xmath68 ( i.e. , @xmath69 with @xmath70 ) defined for @xmath71 such that @xmath72 by @xmath73 these coefficients label the bonds between points in @xmath68 , so that they describe a matrix of @xmath37-bonds with @xmath67-periodic inclusions of @xmath45-bonds grouped in squares of side - length @xmath49 . the periodicity cell is pictured in fig .  [ fig:0 ] .",
    "correspondingly , to these coefficients we associate the energy defined on subsets @xmath74 of @xmath68 by @xmath75 as recalled in the introduction we use the notation @xmath39 .    in order to examine the overall properties of @xmath76",
    "we introduce the family of scaled energies defined on subsets @xmath74 of @xmath77 by @xmath78 i.e. , @xmath79 . to study the continuous limit as @xmath80 of these energies it will be convenient to identify each subset of @xmath77 with a measurable subset of @xmath81 , in such a way that equi - boundedness of the energies implies pre - compactness of such sets in the sense of sets of finite perimeter .",
    "this identification is as follows : we denote by @xmath82 the closed coordinate unit square of center @xmath14 , @xmath83 ^ 2 $ ] ; if @xmath84 and @xmath85 , we denote by @xmath86 the closed coordinate square with side - length @xmath87 and centered in @xmath88 . to a set of indices",
    "@xmath89 we associate the set @xmath90 + the space of _ admissible sets _ related to indices in the twodimensional square lattice is then defined by @xmath91 for each @xmath92 we denote @xmath93 as an easy remark , we note that @xmath94 which shows that sequences of sets @xmath95 with @xmath96 are pre - compact with respect to the local @xmath97-convergence in @xmath81 of their characteristic function and their limits are sets of finite perimeter in @xmath81 .",
    "hence , this defines a meaningful convergence with respect to which compute the @xmath0-limit of @xmath98 as @xmath99 .",
    "a general theory for the homogenization of energies ( [ pabe ] ) , in a more general context , has been developed in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , where it is shown that the @xmath0-limit s domain is precisely the family of sets of finite perimeter and its general form is @xmath100 with @xmath101 a convex function positively homogeneous of degree one .",
    "the computation in the case @xmath102 ( homogeneous spin systems ) can be found in @xcite and gives @xmath103 . in our case",
    "the presence of the @xmath45-inclusions does not influence the form of the @xmath0-limit , as in the following remark .",

    "the lower bound for the @xmath0-limit is immediately obtained from the case @xmath102 in @xcite after remarking that @xmath109 . in order to verify the upper bound , it suffices to note that recovery sequences for the @xmath0-limit of @xmath110 can be constructed at a scale @xmath111 , thus ` avoiding ' the @xmath45-connections . to this end , define @xmath112 this is a square of side - length @xmath113 whose boundary intersects only @xmath37-bonds .",

    "hence , we have ( see @xcite for details on the properties of @xmath0-upper limits ) @xmath121 and the latter is again equal to @xmath122 . this inequality",
    "just states that we can take sets in @xmath119 which are ( small translations of ) a recovery sequence for @xmath123 as a recovery sequence for @xmath124 .      for @xmath89",
