    "in recent years , a lot of research has been focused on the preparation and investigation of `` smart '' microgels consisting of a thermosensitive network of poly(n - isopropylacrylamide ) ( pnipa).@xcite major incentives for this research were possible applications in catalysis,@xcite photonics@xcite or for the fabrication of responsive surface coatings.@xcite in particular , core - shell particles consisting of a polystyrene core onto which a thermosensitive network is affixed present well - defined model colloids and exhibit polydispersities below @xmath0 6%.@xcite hence , besides their potential for applications these core - shell microgels are interesting model systems for studies of the flow behavior of concentrated colloidal suspensions.@xcite in this way core - shell microgels have become one of the best - studied class of polymer colloids .    in aqueous media , pnipa exhibits a lower critical solution temperature ( lcst ) of about .",
    "@xcite below this temperature the network is swollen by the solvent water whereas water is expelled from the microgel above the lower critical solution temperature .",
    "hence , in the swollen state the pnipa shell of the core - shell microgels is expected to have a rather soft character .",
    "this implies the presence of network breathing modes in this state . up to now",
    ", there is evidence that the rheology of colloidal suspensions is strongly related to the dynamic properties of these often deformable objects .",
    "an important example in this context represents the flow of blood , containing deformable erythrocytes .",
    "other important examples are liquid droplets , emulsions , and vesicles . while experimental and theoretical studies have been devoted to the understanding of the dynamics of bending modes,@xcite the effect of shape fluctuations on the rotational diffusion coefficient of deformable objects has not been investigated yet despite the importance of the rotational degree of freedom for soft materials .",
    "@xcite possible reasons may be sought in the lack of well - defined monodisperse model systems that can be studied by suitable experimental techniques .",
    "here we study the translational and rotational motion of thermosensitive core - shell microgel particles by depolarized dynamic light scattering ( ddls).@xcite the aim of the present work is a better understanding of the coupling of rotational motion and shape fluctuations .",
    "such microgels are highly suitable for the present study because these particles have been extensively studied by scattering methods such as small - angle neutron scattering , small - angle x - ray scattering , and light scattering.@xcite it has been demonstrated that metal nanoparticles can be embedded in the network of the shell .",
    "@xcite moreover , recent work has shown that cryogenic transmission electron microscopy ( cryo - tem ) is well suited to study the structure and the shape of these particles in - situ:@xcite a thin film of the fluid dispersion containing the particles is shock - frozen and subsequently analyzed by transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) , no staining or any other preparatory step is necessary .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows typical cryo - tem micrographs of dilute suspensions of such core - shell particles .",
    "the core consisting of polystyrene and the shell of cross - linked pnipa is clearly visible .",
    "figures [ fig1 ] ( a ) and ( c ) display the bare particles at different temperatures while figure [ fig1 ] ( b ) shows a core - shell system where palladium nanoparticles are embedded in the shell .",
    "@xcite the shape of the core - shell microgels shown in figures [ fig1 ] ( a ) and ( b ) is slightly asymmetric .",
    "this asymmetry must be traced back to thermal fluctuations .",
    "therefore , we expect the dynamic properties of the core - shell system to be influenced by the shape fluctuations of the shell .",
    "+ depolarized dynamic light scattering ( ddls ) is the method of choice for studying the problem at hand since this technique simultaneously probes the translational and rotational diffusion coefficient of optically anisotropic particles.@xcite ddls has been applied to a number of anisometric particles in dilute solution.@xcite in general , spherical particles should not exhibit a signal in ddls .",
    "however , the shape fluctuations of the core - shell microgels that are visible as frozen anisometry in the cryo - tem micrographs ( see fig . [ fig1 ] ) should lead to an optical anisotropy of sufficient magnitude to give a finite depolarized signal in solution .",
    "in addition , even in the absence of these shape fluctuations network inhomogeneities due to an anisotropic distribution of crosslinking points will give rise to an additional contribution in the ddls intensity autocorrelation function .",
    "this is observed indeed . on the other hand ,",
    "the average shape of the particles is still spherical and rather simple models can still be applied .",
    "this conclusion can be derived from the fact that these particles have the phase diagram of hard spheres.@xcite + the paper is organized as follows : after the section experimental we first give a brief survey on the theory of ddls and develop a general scheme for the evaluation of data . in a second step",
    "we discuss the intensity autocorrelation functions for the microgels above and below their transition temperature in terms of a slow and a fast relaxation rate , the latter being related to the coupling of shape fluctuations and rotational motion . in the last section",
    "a simple statistical - mechanical model is presented that provides a qualitative explanation of the experimental data .",

    "the synthesis and the characterization of the particles has been described previously .",
    "@xcite all solutions ( 0.05 wt % ) were prepared in 0.05 m kcl to reduce electrostatic particle interactions @xcite and filtered into dust free sample holders using 0.45 @xmath1 m nylon filters .",
    "all experiments were carried out using the alv / dls / sls-5000 compact goniometer system equipped with a he - ne laser ( @xmath2 nm ) .",
    "the scattering cells ( 10 mm cylindric cuvettes , hellma ) were immersed in an index matching bath of cis - decaline which does not change the polarization plane of the laser light as e.g. toluene . for the ddls experiment , the primary beam and",
    "the scattered light passed through a glan - thomson polarizer with an extinction coefficient better than 10@xmath3 .",
    "the first polarizer guaranteed that mainly vertically polarized light impinges on the sample and the orientation of a second polarizer ( analyzer ) was carefully adjusted to a crossed position with the minimum scattered intensity .",
    "all radii of the particles @xmath4 given in the text were obtained by dls .",
    "the theory of dynamic light scattering has been presented in various treatises .",
    "@xcite hence , we only review the equations necessary for this study . for an incident light wave traveling in the @xmath5 direction with a polarization vector in the @xmath6 direction the intensity of the scattered electric field can be written as @xmath7 where the absolute value of the scattering vector @xmath8 is given by @xmath9 in which @xmath10 is the refractive index of the medium .",

    "experimentally accessible quantities are the intensity autocorrelation functions @xmath20 using dynamic light scattering ( dls ) and @xmath21 using ddls . for photon counts obeying gaussian statistics ,",
    "the intensity autocorrelation functions are related to the electric field autocorrelation functions @xmath22 and @xmath23 according to @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are dependent on the scattering geometry and are usually treated as adjustable parameters .",
    "the electric field correlation functions can be calculated for various systems .",
    "the core - shell particles in solution can change their position , orientation , and shape randomly by thermal agitation . for a dilute solution containing noninteracting monodisperse spherical particles of radius @xmath4 the intensity autocorrelation functions",
    "are given by : @xmath27 the translational and rotational diffusion coefficients read @xmath28 where the temperature @xmath29 and viscosity @xmath30 characterize the solvent and @xmath31 for hard spheres .",
    "the parameter @xmath32 in eq [ eq2 ] takes into account possible contributions of polarized components to the intensity of the scattered light in the ddls experiment due to a limited extinction ratio of the polarizer as discussed below .",
    "+ as a new feature of the present evaluation , we have introduced the parameter @xmath33 in eq [ eq4 ] .",
    "this parameter describes the difference of the real system from the hard sphere model , that is , @xmath31 : if @xmath31 , the rotational diffusion as well as the translational diffusion is fully described by a single parameter , namely the hydrodynamic radius @xmath4 . if @xmath34 , the rotational diffusion is coupled to an additional degree of freedom of the particle .",
    "since @xmath35 scales with @xmath36 , possible deviations may hence be determined by precise ddls - measurements .",
    "we first discuss the microgel particles at temperatures above the volume transition . here",
    "we expect the dynamics of the core - shell particles at to be the same as those of hard spheres because the shell is fully collapsed under these conditions and provides a rather tight envelope of the core as is apparent from figure [ fig1 ] ( c ) .",
    "@xcite the tight and nearly homogeneous shell visible above the transition temperature can be traced back to the fact that the particles are synthesized at high temperatures ( 80 @xmath37c ) .",
    "@xcite it must be kept in mind that the interaction between the particles becomes attractive above the transition temperature and the particles may coagulate slowly .",
    "@xcite however , the small concentrations used in the present ddls experiments prevent this coagulation .",

    "[ fig3 ] for the core - shell particles containing palladium nanoparticles at .,width=283 ]      the autocorrelation function @xmath42 in eq [ eq2 ] is a sum of two discrete exponentially decaying functions , where the slow relaxation mode characterizes translational diffusion while the faster relaxation mode is related to rotational motion and shape fluctuations .",
    "hence , one may describe the experimental data in terms of a slow ( @xmath43 ) and a fast relaxation rate ( @xmath44 ) according to @xmath45 the slow mode is also characteristic for the single exponential decay of the autocorrelation function @xmath46 in eq [ eq1 ] .",

    "for example , the corresponding diffusion coefficients of a hard dimer consisting of two identical hard spheres of radius @xmath4 are given by @xmath57 and @xmath58 , respectively .",
    "@xcite hence the ratio of the rotational diffusion coefficient to the translational diffusion coefficient @xmath59 is smaller for hard dimers than for hard spheres , while the opposite behavior has been found for the core - shell particles below the transition temperature .",

    "@xcite hence , this comparison demonstrates clearly that the dynamics of the core - shell particles below the transition temperature can not be explained in terms of a hard particle model .",
    "furthermore , the experimental results can not be explained by using slipping boundary conditions ( see , e.g. , ref@xcite ) instead of the conventional sticking boundary conditions which lead to eqs [ eq3 ] an [ eq4 ] .",
    "the translational diffusion coefficient of a sphere with slipping boundary conditions is increased by the factor @xmath62 as compared to @xmath63 in eq [ eq3 ] , while the rotational motion of such a sphere does not displace any fluid , implying that @xmath64 . both results",
    "do not agree with the experimental data .",
    "in the following we present a model that takes into account the influence of shape fluctuations on the rotational motion of the particles .",
    "as is illustrated in figure [ fig6 ] , the motion of a scattering unit ( solid circle ) on a pnipa chain within the shell of the particles can be decomposed into various types of modes .",
    "if the shell provides a rather tight envelop of the core , the scattering unit will exhibit translational motion and rotational motion around the center of mass of the particle ( figure [ fig6 ] ( a ) ) , that is , the particles will behave as hard spheres without internal degrees of freedom .",
    "so above the lcst the ddls signal will be due to the inhomogeneity of the frozen polymer network .",
    "however , there is an additional fluctuation dynamic ( fluct ; see figure [ fig6 ] ) due to internal degrees of freedom of the pnipa chain if the shell is rather soft ( figure [ fig6 ] ( b ) ) .        in the following we shall discuss the coupling between the rotational dynamics and the internal modes of the particles that come into play below the transition temperature .",
    "the pnipa chains are linear chain molecules which are described by a chain model for macromolecules of variable stiffness @xcite that has been used earlier to discuss the dynamics of polymers under the influence of various forces ( see , e.g. , refs @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it has been shown that the dynamics of individual pnipa chains in dilute solution can be interpreted in terms of a chain model of this type .",

    "an expansion of the position vector and of the stochastic force in terms of the eigenfunctions and the time - dependent amplitudes @xmath81 , @xmath82 according to @xmath83 and @xmath84 yields @xmath85 here @xmath86 is the eigenvalue corresponding to the eigenfunction @xmath80 .",

    "@xcite on the other hand , intramolecular hydrodynamic interactions lead to a dependence of @xmath63 on @xmath94 in the case of dilute @xcite or semi - dilute @xcite polymer solutions .",
    "the first internal mode ( @xmath95 ) exhibits the largest relaxation time and the rotational - fluctuation diffusion coefficient @xmath96 can be derived as @xmath97 where @xmath98 follows from the transcendental equation @xmath99 together with and @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 .",

    "increasing values of @xmath104 ) the ratio @xmath103 increases similar to the experimental findings presented in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "hence shape fluctuations do indeed lead to a considerable increase of the diffusion coefficient @xmath106 .",
    "+ of course , the results shown in figure [ fig7 ] can only be considered to be of qualitative significance for the core - shell particles under consideration .",
    "however , these results clearly point to the importance of the coupling of rotational and internal modes in the case of soft materials .",
    "we emphasize that the core - shell particles maintain on average a spherical shape because @xmath107 can be described by a single exponential function according to eq [ eq1 ] .",

    "a key feature of the static scattering intensity of both uniform microgel particles and core - shell microgel particles below the transition temperature is a strong scattering signal that is due to collective fluctuations of the polymer gel .",
    "@xcite it has been demonstrated that the contribution of this internal dynamics to the static scattering intensity vanishes for temperatures above the transition temperature ( see figure 4 in ref  @xcite ) .",
    "the corresponding collective dynamic fluctuations of the pnipa network below the lcst have been measured using dls @xcite and neutron spin - echo spectroscopy .",
    "@xcite despite the different @xmath110 range of the two methods , the found collective diffusion coefficient of the network has a similar order of magnitude .",
    "this most likely indicates that the network motion is always observable independent of the characteristic length scale of the experiment .",
    "hence , the deviations from the hard sphere model observed in the present study by means of ddls can be considered as a manifestation of these fluctuations .",
    "very recently it has been demonstrated experimentally that the softness of microgel particles has also a pronounced influence on the dynamics in concentrated microgel suspensions .",
    "in conclusion , our findings elucidate an important and interesting interplay between shape fluctuations and rotational motion of deformable objects which profoundly affects their dynamics . the control over the degree of deformations offered by varying the temperature should make the core - shell microgels useful for fundamental studies in statistical physics .",
    "we anticipate that the results obtained for the present system is of general importance for a better understanding for more complicated systems related to biophysics as e.g. vesicles .",
