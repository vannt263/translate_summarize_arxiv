    "the interaction between spatially separated objects is mediated by the disturbance of the region that surrounds them , described by a _",
    "field_. in electromagnetic theory for example the interaction between charged particles is described by the maxwell field equations .",
    "since they are linear , interactions add . however , more often than not , the field equations are nonlinear as for example in the case of general relativity : even though the energy - momentum tensor couples linearly to the curvature , the latter depends in a nonlinear way on the spacetime metric and its derivatives @xcite .",
    "the source of the nonlinearity lies in the geometric nature of the problem .",
    "not only do interactions fail to add up , even the humble two particle problem poses challenges .",
    "`` effective '' interactions between macroscopic degrees of freedom arise in statistical physics when a partial trace is performed in the partition function over unobserved microscopic degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "the boltzmann factor invariably renders these interactions nonlinear .",
    "this time , the source of the nonlinearity is the entropy hidden in the degrees of freedom that have been traced out . for example , the effective interaction between charged colloids in salty water is described ( at a mean - field level ) by the poisson - boltzmann equation @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will discuss a classical example which belongs to the class of effective interactions , while owing its nonlinearity to its geometric origin : the interaction between particles mediated by the deformation of a surface to which they are bound .",
    "this problem includes the capillary interactions between particles bound to liquid - fluid interfaces @xcite , or the membrane mediated interactions between colloids or proteins adhering to or embedded in lipid bilayer membranes @xcite . to approach the problem we require two pieces of information .",
    "first , how does the energy of the surface depend on its shape , or in other words , what is the `` surface hamiltonian '' ?",
    "second , how does a bound particle locally deform the surface ? with this information , we may ( in principle ) deduce the equilibrium shape minimizing the energy of the surface for any given placement of the bound particles . knowing the shape , the energy can be determined by integration , and the forces it implies follow by differentiating with respect to appropriate placement variables .",
    "in general , however , the ground state of the surface is a solution of a nonlinear field equation ( `` the shape equation '' ) , thereby thwarting progress by this route at a very early stage .",
    "sometimes the linearization of a nonlinear theory is adequate .",
    "just as one recovers newtonian gravitation as the weak - field limit of general relativity @xcite , or debye - hckel theory as the weak - field limit of poisson - boltzmann theory @xcite , a linear theory for surface mediated interactions is useful for certain simple geometries , notably weakly perturbed flat surfaces . at this level",

    "yet , linearization is also often inadequate .",
    "the full theory may display qualitatively new effects which are absent in the linearized theory : strong gravitational fields give us black holes @xcite ; the bare charge of a highly charged colloid gets strongly renormalized by counterion condensation @xcite .",
    "there is , however , an alternative approach to interactions which was outlined in @xcite . by relating the _ interaction _ between particles to the equilibrium _ geometry _ of the surface ,",
    "a host of exact nonlinear results is provided .",

    "we have shown how the stress tensor can be used to relate the forces between particles bound to an interface directly to the interface geometry . in this approach ,",
    "the force on a particle is given by a line integral of the stress along any closed contour surrounding the particle .",
    "the stress depends only on the local geometry ; thus the force is completely encoded in the surface geometry in the neighborhood of the curve .",

    "this approach is not a substitute for solving the nonlinear field equations . to extract numbers",
    ", we _ do _ need to solve these equations .",
    "but even before this is done , the line integral expression can provide valuable qualitative information concerning the nature of the interactions between particles .",
    "this is because the geometry along the contour is often insensitive to the precise conditions binding the particle to the interface .",
    "this contrasts sharply with the energy based approach ; there , one needs to know the entire distribution of energy on the interface before one can say anything about the nature of the interaction . as we have seen in the context of a symmetrical two - particle configuration ,",
    "it is sometimes relatively easy to identify qualitative properties of the _ geometry _ ; it is virtually impossible to make corresponding statements about the _ energy _ outside the linear regime .",
    "the stress tensor approach also has the virtue of combining seamlessly with any approach we choose , be it analytical or numerical , to determine the surface shape .",
    "thus , for instance , one can find surfaces that minimize a prescribed surface energy functional using the program `` surface evolver '' @xcite .",
    "the evaluation of the force via a _ line _ integral involving the geometry along the contour is straightforward ; in contrast , the evaluation of the energy involves a _ surface _ integral , and the forces then follow by a subsequent _ numerical differentiation_. in other words , the route via the energy requires one more integration but also one more differentiation .",
    "this appears neither economical nor numerically robust .",
    "we have illustrated how internal degrees of freedom on the membrane can be incorporated within this approach using a vector order parameter describing lipid tilt as an example .",
    "it is indeed remarkable just how readily non - geometrical degrees of freedom can be accommodated within this geometrical framework . here",
    "again , new exact non - linear expressions for the force between particles mediated by the tilt are obtained which are beyond the scope of the traditional approach to the problem .",
    "various patterns emerge which could not have been guessed from inspection of the hamiltonian , in particular the existence of a ",
    "@xmath207 \" motif common to the geometrical and tilt mediated forces between symmetrical particles .",
    "we have considered the force between a pair of particles .",

    "@xcite for a striking illustration ) .",
    "this , however , poses no difficulty for the stress tensor approach , because the underlying relation between surface geometry and force is independent of whether or not a pair - decomposition is possible ( see fig .  [",
