    "galactic winds that extend on a scale comparable to the host galaxies are now known to be a common feature both locally and at high redshifts .",
    "these winds are significant carriers of mass , momentum , and energies that may impact the formation and evolution of the host galaxies and the surrounding intergalactic medium . given the scope of this conference , the present review focusses exclusively on starburst - driven winds .",
    "agn - driven galactic winds , perhaps a very important phenomenon in the lives of galaxies with spheroids ( kormendy & gebhardt 2001 ) , are not discussed here ( see , e.g. , veilleux et al .",
    "2002a for a recent review of this topic ) .",
    "due to space limitations , the emphasis of this review is on the recent ( @xmath0 1998 ) literature .",
    "readers interested in results from earlier studies may refer to the reviews by strickland ( 2002 ) and heckman ( 2002 ) .",
    "first , the basic physics of starburst - driven winds is described briefly in  2 .",
    "an observational summary of the properties of local winds is given in the preamble to  3 .",
    "the remainder of  3 describes detailed data on three well - studied cases of local starburst - driven winds , and summarizes the evidence for winds in luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies and distant lyman break galaxies .",
    "this section often emphasizes the importance of using multiwavelength data to draw a complete picture of this complex multi - phase phenomenon .",
    "the impact of starburst - driven winds on the host galaxies and their environment is discussed briefly in  4 . here",
    "the focus of the discussion is on the existence and properties of the wind fluid and on the size of the `` zone of influence '' of these winds .",
    "a summary is given in  5 .",
    "the driving force behind starburst - driven winds is the mechanical energy from stellar winds and supernova events ( e.g. , chevalier & clegg 1985 ) .",
    "this mechanical energy is quickly thermalized to produce a hot cavity with a temperature @xmath1 k , where @xmath2 is the mass - loading term .",
    "this over - pressured cavity expands through the ambient medium , sweeping this material up in the process to produce a bubble - like structure .",
    "the complex interaction between the wind and the ism of the host galaxy has been the subject of several numerical simulations ( e.g. , maclow & mccray 1988 ; suchkov et al . 1994 , 1996 ; maclow & ferrara 1999 ; dercole & brighenti 1999 ; strickland & stevens 2000 ; silich & tenorio - tagle 2001 ) .",
    "if radiative energy losses are negligible ( probably a good assumption in some objects ; e.g. , heckman et al . 2001 ) , the bubble expands adiabatically through the galaxy ism with a velocity @xmath3 km s@xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the ambient nucleon density in @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the rate of deposition of mechanical energy in 10@xmath8 erg s@xmath4 , and @xmath9 is the age of the bubble in 10@xmath10 years ( e.g. , weaver et al . 1977 ) .",
    "a powerful starburst may inject enough energy to produce a cavity of hot gas that can burst out of the disk ism , at which point the dense walls of the bubble start accelerating outward , become rayleigh - taylor unstable , and break up into cloudlets and filaments .",
    "if halo drag is negligible ( probably _ not _ a good assumption in general ) , the wind fluid may reach terminal velocities as high as @xmath11 3000 @xmath12 km s@xmath4 , well in excess of the escape velocity of the host galaxy .",
    "in contrast , the terminal velocities of clouds accelerated by the wind are more modest , of order @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the wind momentum flux in 10@xmath15 dynes , @xmath16 is the solid angle of the wind in steradians , @xmath17 is the initial position of the cloud in kpc , and @xmath18 is the column density of the cloud in 10@xmath19 @xmath20 ( strelnitskii & sunyaev 1973 ; heckman et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "a critical quantity in all of these calculations is the thermalization efficiency , or the percentage of the mechanical energy from the starburst that goes into heating the gas .",
    "unfortunately , this quantity is poorly constrained observationally .",
    "most simulations assume a thermalization efficiency of 100% , i.e. none of the energy injected by the starburst is radiated away . in reality , this efficiency depends critically on the environment , and is likely to be significantly less than 100% in the high - density environment of powerful nuclear starbursts ( e.g. , thornton et al .",
    "1998 ; strickland & stevens 2000 ; silich , tenorio - tagle , & muoz - tun 2003 ) .",
    "galactic magnetic fields may also `` cushion '' the effects of the starburst on the ism , and reduce the impact of the galactic wind on the host galaxy and its environment ( e.g. , tomisaka 1990 ; ferrire et al .",
    "1991 ; slavin & cox 1992 ; mineshinge et al .",
    "1993 ; ferrire 1998 ) .",
    "a great number of surveys have provided important statistical information on galactic winds in the local universe ( e.g. , heckman , armus , & miley 1990 ; veilleux et al .",

    "galaxy - scale winds are common among galaxies with global star formation rates per unit area @xmath21",
    "m@xmath22 yr@xmath4 kpc@xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the optical radius .",
    "this general rule - of - thumb also appears to apply to ultra / luminous infrared galaxies ( see  3.3 ) and distant lyman break galaxies ( see  3.4 ) .",
    "`` quiescent '' galaxies with global star formation rates per unit area below this threshold often show signs of galactic fountaining in the forms of warm , ionized extraplanar material a few kpc above or below the galactic disks ( e.g. , miller & veilleux 2003a , 2003b and references therein ) .",
    "the energy input from stellar winds and supernovae in these objects elevates some of the ism above the disk plane , but is not sufficient to produce large - scale winds .",
    "this rule - of - thumb is conservative since a number of known wind galaxies , including our own galaxy (  3.1 ) and several dwarf galaxies , have @xmath25 0.1 m@xmath22 yr@xmath4 kpc@xmath23 ( e.g. , hunter & gallagher 1990 , 1997 ; meurer et al .",

    "; martin 1998 , 1999 ; see kunth s and martin s contributions at this conference ) .",
    "the production of detectable winds probably depends not only on the characteristics of the starburst ( global _ and _ local @xmath26 , starburst age ) , but also on the detailed properties of the ism in the host galaxies ( e.g. , see the theoretical blowout criterion of maclow & mccray 1988 ) .",
    "the winds in actively star - forming galaxies in the local universe show a very broad range of properties , with opening angles of @xmath11 0.1  0.5 @xmath27 ( 4@xmath28 sr ) , radii ranging from @xmath29 1 kpc to several 10s of kpc , outflow velocities of a few 10s of km s@xmath4 to more than 1000 km s@xmath4 ( with clear evidence for a positive correlation with the temperature of the gas phase ) , total ( kinetic and thermal ) outflow energies of @xmath11 10@xmath30  10@xmath31 ergs or 5  20% of the total mechanical energy returned to the ism by the starburst , and mass outflow rates ranging from @xmath29 1 m@xmath22 yr@xmath4 to @xmath32 100 m@xmath22 and scaling roughly with the star formation rates ( see  3.3 below ) .    in the remainder of this section",
    ", we discuss a few well - studied cases of galactic winds in the local universe and summarize the evidence for winds in luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies at low and moderate redshifts as well as in distant lyman break galaxies .      by far",
    "the closest case of a large - scale outflow is the wind in our own galaxy .",
    "evidence for a dusty bipolar wind extending @xmath11 350 pc ( @xmath11 1@xmath33 ) above and below the disk of our galaxy has recently been reported by bland - hawthorn & cohen ( 2003 ) based on data from the midcourse space experiment ( msx ) .",
    "the position of the warm dust structure coincides closely with the well - known galactic center lobe detected at radio wavelengths ( e.g. , sofue 2000 and references therein ) .",
    "simple arguments suggest that the energy requirement for this structure is of order @xmath11 10@xmath34 ergs with a dynamical time scale of @xmath11 1 myr .",
    "bland - hawthorn & cohen ( 2003 ) also argue that the north polar spur , a thermal x - ray / radio loop that extends from the galactic plane to @xmath35 ( e.g. , sofue 2000 ) , can naturally be explained as an open - ended bipolar wind , when viewed in projection in the near field .",
    "this structure extends on a scale of 10  20 kpc and implies an energy requirement of @xmath11 ( 1  30 ) @xmath27 10@xmath34 ergs and a dynamical timescale of @xmath11 15 myr , i.e. considerably longer than that of the smaller structure seen in the msx maps .",
    "if confirmed , this may indicate that the milky way galaxy has gone through multiple galactic wind episodes .",
    "bland - hawthorn & cohen ( 2003 ) point out that the north polar spur would escape detection in external galaxies ; it is therefore possible that the number of galaxies with large - scale winds has been ( severely ? ) underestimated .",

    "* this archetype starburst galaxy hosts arguably the best studied galactic wind .",
    "some of the strongest evidence for the wind is found at optical wavelengths , where long - slit and fabry - perot spectroscopy of the warm ionized filaments above and below the disk shows line splittings of up to @xmath11 250 km s@xmath4 , corresponding to deprojected velocities of order 525  655 km s@xmath4 ( e.g. , mckeith et al .",
    "1995 ; shopbell & bland - hawthorn 1998 ) . combining these velocities with estimates for the ionized masses of the outflowing filamentary complex ,",
    "the kinetic energy involved in the warm ionized outflow is of order @xmath11 2 @xmath27 10@xmath34 ergs or @xmath11 1% of the total mechanical energy input from the starburst .",
    "the ionized filaments are found to lie on the surface of cones with relatively narrow opening angles ( @xmath11 5  25@xmath33 ) slightly tilted ( @xmath11 5  15@xmath33 ) with respect to the spin axis of the galaxy .",
    "deep narrow - band images of m82 have shown that the outflow extends out to at least 12 kpc on one side ( e.g. , devine & bally 1999 ) , coincident with x - ray emitting material seen by @xmath36 ( lehnert , heckman , & weaver 1999 ) and @xmath37-newton ( stevens , read , & bravo - guerrero 2003 ) .",
    "the wind fluid in this object has apparently been detected by both @xmath38 ( griffiths et al .",

    "recently published high - quality co maps of this object now indicate that some of the molecular material in this system is also involved in the large - scale outflow ( walter , weiss , & scoville 2002 ; see also garcia - burillo et al .",
    "the outflow velocities derived from the co data ( @xmath11 100 km s@xmath4 on average ) are considerably lower than the velocities of the warm ionized gas , but the mass involved in the molecular outflow is substantially larger ( @xmath11 3 x 10@xmath39 m@xmath22 ) , implying a kinetic energy ( @xmath11 3 @xmath27 10@xmath34 ergs ) that is comparable if not larger than that involved in the warm ionized filaments . the molecular gas is clearly a very important dynamical component of this outflow .    0.1 in * ngc  3079 .",

    "the two - dimensional velocity field of the ionized bubble material derived from fabry - perot data ( veilleux et al .",
    "1994 ) indicates that the ionized bubble material is entrained in a mushroom vortex above the disk with velocities of up to @xmath11 1500 km s@xmath4 ( cecil et al .",
    "2001 ) . a recently published x - ray map obtained with the @xmath38 ( cecil , bland - hawthorn , & veilleux 2002 ) reveals excellent spatial correlation between the hot x - ray emitting gas and the warm optical line - emitting material of the bubble , suggesting that the x - rays are being emitted either as upstream , standoff bow shocks or by cooling at cloud / wind conductive interfaces .",
    "this good spatial correlation between the hot and warm gas phases appears to be common in galactic winds ( strickland et al . 2000 , 2002 ; veilleux et al .",
    "2003 , and references therein ) .",
    "the total energy involved in the outflow of ngc  3079 appears to be slightly smaller than that in m  82 , although it is a lower limit since the total extent of the x - ray emitting material beyond the nuclear bubble of ngc  3079 is not well constrained ( cecil et al .",
    "contrary to m  82 , the hot wind fluid that drives the outflow in ngc  3079 has not yet been detected , and evidence for entrained molecular gas is sparse and controversial ( e.g. , irwin & sofue 1992 ; baan & irwin 1995 ; israel et al .",

    "surprisingly little evidence exists for the presence of this enriched wind fluid .",
    "this is due to the fact that the wind fluid is tenuous and hot and therefore very hard to detect in the x - rays .",

    "if the measured outflow velocity exceeds the predicted escape velocity _ and _ if the halo drag is negligible , then the outflowing material is presumed to escape the host galaxy and be deposited in the igm on scales @xmath0 50  100 kpc .",

    "( 2002 ) refer to the neutral component of the outflow , not the hot enriched wind fluid .",
    "unfortunately , direct measurements of the wind velocity are not yet technically possible so one generally relies on the expected terminal velocity of an adiabatic wind at the measured x - ray temperature @xmath57 [ @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the mean mass per particle ] to provide a lower limit to the velocity of the wind fluid ( this is a lower limit because it only takes into account the thermal energy of this gas and neglects any bulk motion ; e.g. , chevalier & clegg 1985 ; martin 1999 ; heckman et al . 2000 ) .",
    "arguably the single most important assumption made to determine the fate of the outflowing gas is that halo drag is negligible .",

    "progress in this area of research has been possible thanks to advances in the fabrication of low - order fabry - perot etalons which are used as tunable filters to provide monochromatic images over a large fraction of the field of view of the imager . the central wavelength ( 3500   ",
    "1.0 @xmath59 m ) is tuned to the emission - line feature of interest and the bandwidth ( 10  100  ) is chosen to minimize the sky background . continuum and emission - line images are produced nearly simultaneously thanks to a `` charge shuffling / frequency switching '' mode , where the charges are moved up and down within the detector at the same time as switching between two discrete frequencies with the tunable filter , therefore averaging out temporal variations associated with atmospheric lines and transparency , seeing , instrument and detector instabilities .",

    "as expected from shock models ( e.g. , dopita & sutherland 1995 ) , the importance of shocks over photoionization by ob stars appears to scale with the velocity of the outflowing gas ( e.g. , ngc  1482 , ngc  6240 , or eso484-g036 versus ngc  1705 ; ngc  3079 is an extreme example of a shock - excited wind nebula ; veilleux et al . 1994 ) , although other factors like the starburst age , star formation rate , and the dynamical state of the outflowing structure ( e.g. , pre- or post - blowout ) must also be important in determining the excitation properties of the gas at these large radii ( e.g. , shopbell & bland - hawthorn 1998 and veilleux  &  rupke  2002 ) .    0.1 in * influence of the wind on companion galaxies .",
    "* companion galaxies located within the zone of influence of the wind will be affected by the wind ram pressure .",
    "irwin et al . ( 1987 ) noticed that the dwarf s0 galaxy ngc  3073 exhibits an elongated h  i tail that is remarkably aligned with the nucleus of ngc  3079 .",
    "irwin et al . have argued that ram pressure due to the outflowing gas of ngc  3079 is responsible for this tail .",
    "if that is the case , the wind of ngc  3079 must extent to at least @xmath11 50 kpc .",
    "this is the only system known so far where this phenomenon is suspected to take place .    0.1 in * absorption - line studies .",
    "* absorption - line spectroscopy of bright background galaxies ( e.g. , high-@xmath50 quasars , lyman break galaxies ) can provide direct constraints on the zone of influence of galactic winds .",
    "norman et al .",
    "( 1996 ) have used this method to estimate the extent of the wind in ngc  520 .",
    "a strong and possibly complex mg ii , mg i , and fe ii absorption - line system was found near the systemic velocity of ngc  520 at a distance from the galactic nucleus of 24 @xmath62 kpc . a weaker system at a distance of 52 @xmath62 kpc is also possibly present .",
    "unfortunately , ngc  520 is undergoing a tidal interaction so the absorption may arise from tidally disrupted gas rather than material in the purported wind .",
    "norman et al . also looked for absorption - line systems associated with the wind of ngc  253 , but the proximity of this system to our own galaxy and to the line of sight to the magellanic stream makes the identification of the absorption - line systems ambiguous .",
    "no other local wind galaxy has been studied using this technique .",
    "large absorption - line data sets collected on high-@xmath50 galaxies provide new constraints on the zone of influence of winds in the early universe .",
    "adelberger et al .",
    "( 2003 ) have recently presented tantalizing evidence for a deficit of neutral hydrogen clouds within a comoving radius of @xmath11 0.5 @xmath62 mpc from @xmath63 lbgs .",
    "the uncertainties are large and the results are significant at less than the @xmath11 2@xmath64 level .",
    "adelberger et al .",
    "( 2003 ) argue that this deficit , if real , is unlikely to be due solely to the ionizing radiation from lbgs ( e.g. , steidel et al .",
    "2001 ; giallongo et al .",
    "they favor a scenario in which the winds in lbgs directly influence the surrounding igm .",
    "they also argue that the excess of absorption - line systems with large civ column densities near lbgs is evidence for chemical enrichment of the igm by the lbg winds .",
    "tremendous progress has been made over the past five years in understanding the physics and impact of starburst - driven winds in the local and distant universe .",
    "we now know that starburst - driven winds are common in galaxies with high star formation rates per unit area , both locally ( nearby starbursts , luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies ) and at high redshifts ( e.g. , lyman break galaxies ) .",
    "there is _ direct _ evidence that starburst - driven winds have had a strong influence on the chemical evolution of the host ism and possibly also that of the igm : ( 1 ) enriched wind fluid has been detected in a few nearby galaxies .",
    "( 2 ) approximately half of the outflowing material in powerful starburst galaxies ( ulirgs ) have velocities in excess of the escape velocities . ( 3 ) deep emission - line maps of local wind galaxies indicate that the zone of influence of the wind often extends beyond @xmath11 10 kpc .",
    "( 4 ) recent results on lyman break galaxies suggest tentatively that the zone of influence of lbg winds may extent out to @xmath11 500 @xmath62 kpc .",
    "nevertheless , much work remains to be done in this area of research ; the next five years promise to be equally exciting as the last five !    it is a pleasure to thank s. aalto for organizing a stimulating conference .",
    "some of the results presented in this paper are part of a long - term effort involving many collaborators , including j. bland - hawthorn , g. cecil , p. l. shopbell , and r. b. tully and maryland graduate students s. t. miller and d. s. rupke .",
