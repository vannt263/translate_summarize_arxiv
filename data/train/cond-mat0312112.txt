    "to elucidate the physical properties of mott - hubbard systems has been one of the most challenging subjects in condensed matter physics and has continued to pose controversial theoretical as well as experimental issues . in this respect ,",
    "the single - particle spectral function of transition - metal oxides , particularly of early transition - metal oxides , is of fundamental importance in the physics of mott - hubbard systems .",
    "in fact , the coexistence of the coherent part [ the quasi - particle ( qp ) band ] and the incoherent part ( a remnant of the upper and lower hubbard bands ) in the spectral function and spectral weight transfer between them as a function of electron correlation strength @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the coulomb repulsion energy and @xmath6 is the bandwidth , are a remarkable manifestation of electron correlation as identified in the photoemission spectra of v and ti oxides .",
    "@xcite theoretically , dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) applied to the hubbard model has successfully reproduced these characteristic features .",
    "@xcite comparison between experiment and theory , however , has not been straightforward . in dmft ,",
    "the self - energy is necessarily local , and therefore the density of states ( dos ) at the fermi level ( @xmath7 ) , namely , the spectral intensity at @xmath7 remains the same as that of the non - interacting system and electron correlation effect manifests itself as the narrowing of the coherent qp band .",
    "experimentally , the reduction of the dos at @xmath7 rather than the narrowing of the coherent part was observed in the photoemission spectra of ca@xmath8sr@xmath9vo@xmath10 , suggesting the importance of the momentum dependence of the self - energy .",
    "@xcite however , a recent `` bulk - sensitive '' photoemission study of the same compounds has shown that the qp band is indeed narrowed and the dos at @xmath7 remains unchanged from that predicted by band - structure calculation , indicating that the self - energy is nearly momentum - independent as assumed in dmft .",
    "@xcite in the present work , we have studied another typical mott - hubbard system vo@xmath0 , which undergoes a metal - insulator transition as a function of temperature , and examined the spectral function of the `` bulk '' to see whether the self - energy is momentum - independent or not .",
    "our results have shown that the self - energy is _ momentum - dependent _ , probably due to ferromagnetic fluctuations arising from the multi - orbital nature of the v @xmath3 band of the rutile structure .",
    "vo@xmath0 is well - known for its first - order metal - insulator transition ( mit ) at 340 k.  @xcite the transition is accompanied by a structural transition . in the high temperature metallic phase it has a rutile structure while in the low temperature insulating phase ( @xmath11 phase ) the v atoms dimerize along the @xmath12-axis and the dimers twist , resulting in a monoclinic structure .",
    "the magnetic susceptibility changes from paramagnetic to nonmagnetic in going from the metallic to the insulating phases .",
    "hence , this transition is analogous to a peierls transition and in fact the importance of electron - phonon interaction has been demonstrated by raman scattering  @xcite and x - ray diffraction  @xcite studies . on the basis of local - density approximation ( lda ) band - structure calculation , wentzcovitch _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite concluded that the insulating phase of vo@xmath0 is an ordinary band ( peierls ) insulator . on the other hand ,",
    "the magnetic susceptibility of the high - temperature metallic phase is unusually high and temperature dependent , indicating the importance of electron - electron correlation .",
    "furthermore , cr - doped vo@xmath0 or pure vo@xmath0 under uniaxial pressure in the [ 110 ] direction of the rutile structure has another monoclinic insulating phase called @xmath13 phase . in the @xmath13 phase ,",
    "half of the v atoms form pairs and the other half form zig - zag chains .",
    "@xcite while the v atoms in the pairs are nonmagnetic , those in the zig - zag chains have local moment and are regarded as one - dimensional heisenberg chains according to an nmr study  @xcite . based on these observations for the @xmath13 phase , rice _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite objected wentzcovitch _",
    "s argument .",
    "thus it still remains highly controversial whether the mit of vo@xmath0 is driven by electron - phonon interaction ( resulting in a peierls insulator ) or electron - electron interaction ( resulting in a mott insulator forming a spin - peierls - like state ) .    to deal with the above problems ,",
    "photoemission spectroscopy is a powerful technique and in fact has been extensively applied to this material .",
    "@xcite however , detailed photoemission studies of the mit has been hampered because the transition temperature of bulk vo@xmath0 is rather high and therefore it is difficult to keep the surface clean in an ultra - high vacuum for the high - temperature metallic phase .",
    "also , because the transition is strongly first - order with the structural change , the sample is destroyed when it crosses the mit and one can go through the transition only once for one sample .    in this work ,",
    "we have avoided those experimental difficulties by using thin film samples epitaxially grown on tio@xmath0(001 ) surfaces using the pulsed laser deposition technique .",
    "@xcite after having obtained a clean surface by oxygen annealing , the surface remained fairly stable for several hours even in the high - temperature metallic phase and allowed us to study detailed temperature - induced changes both in the metallic and insulating phases including the hysteretic behavior across the mit .",
    "spectral weight transfer between the coherent and incoherent parts of the v @xmath3 spectral function accompanying the metal - insulator transition was clearly observed .",
    "we have attempted to deduce the `` bulk '' photoemission spectrum by subtracting surface contributions from the measured spectra .",
    "we compare the `` bulk '' spectrum with the band - structure calculation to discuss electron correlation in the metallic phase , particularly possible momentum dependence of the self - energy .",
    "we have also found a strong temperature dependence in the spectra of the insulating phase and attributed it to strong electron - phonon interaction .",
    "vo@xmath0/tio@xmath0(001 ) thin films were prepared using the pulsed laser deposition technique as described in ref .  .",

    "the substrate temperature was kept at 733 k and oxygen pressure was maintained at 1.0 pa .",
    "the film thickness was about 10 nm .",
    "the epitaxial growth was confirmed by four - cycle x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) measurements and the mit was confirmed by electrical resistivity measurements showing a jump of about thee orders of magnitude .",
    "the transition temperature in the films was 295 k on heating cycle and 285 k on cooling cycle , while the mit occurs at 340 k in bulk samples .",

    "the region from @xmath20 @xmath21 2 ev to @xmath7 is the v @xmath3 band .",
    "while the o @xmath17 band shows no clear temperature dependence , the v @xmath3 band shows a temperature dependence , indicating that the mit occurred between 280 and 300 k.    figure  [ fig3 ] ( a ) and ( b ) shows the ups spectra of vo@xmath0/tio@xmath0(001 ) in the v @xmath3 band region taken at various temperatures .",

    "[ fig3](b ) .",
    "the mit is clearly seen as the change in the spectral intensity at @xmath7 accompanied by the spectral weight transfer between the low binding - energy region @xmath20 = 0 - 0.5 ev ( coherent part ) and the high binding - energy region @xmath20 = 0.5 - 2 ev ( incoherent part ) .",
    "the spectra of the films ( fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) ) are almost identical to that of the bulk sample ( fig .  [ fig3](c ) ) except for the somewhat stronger temperature dependence of the film spectra .",
    "because of the much higher stability of the film surface in vacuum , we could obtain the spectra with much higher signal - to - noise ratio at much smaller temperature intervals in the whole temperature range . also , the film retained the original spectra after several temperature cycles whereas the bulk single crystal broke into pieces once it crossed the mit . in the previous study of bulk single crystals ,  @xcite detailed temperature - dependent studies were therefore limited to the low - temperature insulating phase , where the crystal did not break",
    ". the present temperature dependence in the insulating phase has reproduced the bulk crystal results .    here , we have observed a hysteretic behavior in the spectra with temperature across the mit , as demonstrated by the temperature dependence of the intensity around @xmath7 ( integrated from @xmath20 =  0.2 to 0.5 ev ) shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( b ) .",
    "the hysteretic behavior is seen over the temperature range of @xmath1 10 k. this may indicate the co - existence of metallic and insulating regions with changing volume fractions in this temperature range .",
    "photoemission spectra of another system which shows a first - order temperature - induced metal - insulator transition , @xmath22nio@xmath10 , also shows a similarly gradual temperature dependence .",
    "@xcite in the case of @xmath22nio@xmath10 , the hysteretic behavior in the transport and thermodynamic properties extends over a wide temperature range of several tens k ,  @xcite and correspondingly the photoemission spectra show a more gradual temperature dependence over the wider temperature range .",

    ", the curves in ( a ) have been broadened with a gaussian to account for the lower energy resolution of xps.,width=294 ]    recently , it has been demonstrated that photoemission spectra of transition - metal oxides are strongly influenced by surface contributions .",
    "in particular , the incoherent part centered around @xmath20 = 1 - 1.5 ev contains more surface contributions than the coherent part .",
    "@xcite since the surface layer tends to have a smaller bandwidth @xmath6 and hence a larger @xmath4 , the surface layer tends to have stronger incoherent part and weaker coherent part than in the bulk .",
    "@xcite in order to remove such surface contributions and to analyze the electronic structure of bulk materials , we attempted to deduce the `` bulk '' spectrum in the metallic phase under several assumptions .",
    "if the thickness of the surface layer is @xmath2 and the photoelectron escape depth is @xmath23 , the observed spectrum @xmath24 is given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the `` surface '' and the `` bulk '' spectra , respectively .",
    "as the electronic properties of the surface layer of vo@xmath0 are not precisely known , in the following analyses , we consider the extreme case where the photoemission spectra of the surface layer largely consists of the incoherent part .",
    "therefore , the intensity of the incoherent part in the `` bulk '' spectrum deduced below should be regarded as the lower bound for the actual bulk one .",
    "assuming that the spectrum at 280 k ( @xmath28 ) represents the `` surface '' spectrum , because the photoelectron escape depth @xmath23 is not precisely known , we subtracted the `` surface '' contribution with various ratios as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( a ) . here , `` 20% subtracted '' means that the intensity of the subtracted insulator - like spectrum was 20% of the total intensity . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( b ) , we compare the `` bulk sensitive '' xps spectrum in the literature  @xcite with those spectra in ( a ) after having broadened them with a gaussian function corresponding to the lower experimental energy resolution of xps ( @xmath29 ev ) .",
    "one can see that the xps spectrum is in best agreement with `` 20% subtracted '' spectrum . according to the `` universal curve '' of the photoelectron escape depth ,",
    "@xcite the escape depth is @xmath1 10  for @xmath15 = 21.2 ev and @xmath1 15  for xps ( @xmath15 = 1486.6 ev ) , respectively . using the surface layer thickness of @xmath30 (= 5.7  ) on the ( 001 ) surface of the rutile structure , where @xmath12 is the @xmath12-axis lattice constant",
    ", the surface contribution is @xmath1 44% for @xmath15 = 21.2 ev and @xmath1 32% for @xmath15 = 1486.6 ev , respectively .",
    "hence , the `` 20% subtracted '' spectrum should have 30% surface contribution and therefore it is reasonable that the `` 20% subtracted '' spectrum is in agreement with the xps spectrum .",
    "after all , we consider that the `` bulk '' spectrum is given by the `` 40% subtracted '' spectrum .",
    "`` bulk '' spectrum is compared with the lda band - structure calculation from ref .",

    "[ fig5 ] , we compare the `` bulk '' spectrum thus deduced with the lda band - structure calculation .",
    "@xcite the calculated density of states ( dos ) is multiplied by the fermi - dirac distribution function at 350 k and broadened with a gaussian corresponding to the instrumental energy resolution .",
    "the width of the coherent part @xmath1 0.5 ev is similar to that given by the band - structure calculation .",
    "this means that @xmath31 is @xmath1 1 , where @xmath32 is the average effective mass of the qp and @xmath33 is the average bare band mass of the v @xmath3 band . from the spectral weight ratio of the coherent part to the incoherent part , @xmath34",
    ", the renormalization factor becomes @xmath35 . from the ratio of the intensity at @xmath7 of the spectra to the dos given by the band - structure calculation , one can estimate the average @xmath36-mass defined by @xmath37 , as @xmath38 0.3 .",
    "thus , we again obtain @xmath39 1 .",
    "note that we have assumed that the surface layer is without the coherent part around @xmath7 .",
    "if the surface spectrum has a finite coherent part , the coherent part of the `` bulk '' spectrum would be further reduced and the deduced @xmath36-mass would be even smaller .",
    "hence , @xmath40 deduced here should be taken as the upper limit for @xmath41 , and therefore on can safely conclude the @xmath41 is smaller than unity . that is , the momentum dependence of the self - energy is not negligible in the metallic phase of vo@xmath0 .",
    "our finding @xmath42 is contrasted with the `` bulk '' spectra of sr@xmath8ca@xmath9vo@xmath10 reported by sekiyama _",
    "et al_.  @xcite in their result , the width of the coherent part of the v @xmath3 band of srvo@xmath10 is reduced by a factor of @xmath1 40 % compared with the lda result , and the spectral weight of the coherent part is also reduced by @xmath1 40% due to the transfer of spectral weight to the incoherent part , resulting in almost the same spectral intensity at @xmath7 as that of the lda value , that is , the self - energy has negligible momentum dependence in sr@xmath8ca@xmath9vo@xmath10 .",
    "the origin of the momentum dependence of the self - energy in vo@xmath0 is not known at this moment .",
    "one possibility is poor screening of long - range coulomb interaction , but it is unlikely that the screening effect is so different between vo@xmath0 and sr@xmath8ca@xmath9vo@xmath10 .",
    "another possible origin of the momentum dependence is ferromagnetic fluctuations in vo@xmath0 considering the enhanced magnetic susceptibility in the metallic phase , corresponding to @xmath43 ( ref .  ) .",
    "recently , liebsch and ishida  @xcite proposed that the multi - orbital nature of the v @xmath3 band is important to describe the metallic phase of vo@xmath0 ( ref .  ) , following the idea originally proposed by zylbersztejn and mott .",
    "@xcite according to these works , the occupancy of the @xmath44 orbitals is very different between the metallic and the insulating phases due to lattice distortion in the insulating phase and this affects the role of local coulomb interaction in each phase .",
    "if many orbitals contribute to the metallic conductivity , ferromagnetic correlation may arise from hund s coupling between those orbitals .",
    "further studies are necessary to confirm this scenario .      as stated in sec .",
    "[ intro ] , it has been controversial whether the insulating band gap is primarily caused by the lattice distortion or the electron - electron interaction . in order address this issue , it is useful to examine the photoemission spectral line shape of the v @xmath3 band in the insulating phase .",

    "@xcite , width=302 ]    in fig .",

    "the figure shows that , although the insulating gap can be produced by the lda@xmath45 method , the gaussian - like broad spectrum of v @xmath3 band can not be reproduced .",
    "this disagreement between theory and experiment can not be explained by a surface effect because since the bulk component should have finite contribution ( @xmath1 60 % ) even for this low photon energy and therefore the sharp feature should be clearly visible overlapping the surface signals .",
    "this means that electron - electron interaction on the mean - field level is not sufficient to understand the photoemission spectrum of the insulating vo@xmath0 . here",
    ", we point out that the photoemission spectra of a double - layer manganite la@xmath47sr@xmath48mn@xmath0o@xmath49 also show a broad gaussian - like line shape in striking contrast with lda band - structure calculation , and this discrepancy has been attributed to the strong electron - phonon coupling .",
    "@xcite furthermore , one can recognize that the spectra of vo@xmath0 show very strong temperature dependence in the insulating phase as shown in fig  [ fig3 ] .",
    "the same temperature dependence was observed in the spectra of bulk single crystal and was attributed to electron - phonon interaction , because the core - level spectra also show a similarly strong temperature dependence .",

    ", @xmath55 is the average phonon energy , the @xmath56 is the electron self - energy shift due to coupling to phonons and @xmath57 gives the peak position of the spectra .",
    "this spectral function describes the situation where spectral weight is transfered from the zero - phonon line at the lowest binding energy @xmath58 to @xmath59 by emitting @xmath60 phonons or absorbing @xmath61 phonons .",
    "because this spectral function consists of a series of delta functions , one has to broaden this function to compare with the photoemission spectra . for this purpose",

    "<S> the width of the coherent part is comparable to that given by band - structure calculation in spite of its reduced spectral weight , indicating that the momentum dependence of the self - energy is significant . </S>",
    "<S> this is attributed to by ferromagnetic fluctuation arising from hund s rule coupling between different @xmath2 orbitals as originally proposed by zylbersztejn and mott . in the insulating phase , </S>",
    "<S> the width of the v @xmath3 band shows strong temperature dependence . </S>",
    "<S> we attribute this to electron - phonon interaction and have reproduced it using the independent boson model with a very large coupling constant . </S>"
