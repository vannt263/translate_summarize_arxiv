    "the formation of molecular hydrogen in the interstellar medium is a process of fundamental importance in astrophysics .",
    "h@xmath0 molecules contribute to the cooling of clouds during gravitational collapse and participate in reactions that produce more complex molecules ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "h@xmath0 can not form in the gas phase efficiently enough to account for its observed abundance ( @xcite ) .",
    "it was thus proposed that h@xmath0 formation takes place on dust grains that act as catalysts .",
    "the process of h@xmath0 formation on grains can be broken up into several steps as follows .",
    "an h atom approaching the surface of a grain has a probability @xmath1 to stick and become adsorbed .",
    "the adsorbed h atom ( adatom ) resides on the surface for an average time @xmath2 ( residence time ) before it desorbs . in the langmuir - hinshelwood mechanism ,",
    "the adsorbed h atoms quickly equilibrate and diffuse on the surface of the grain either by thermal activation or by tunneling .",
    "when two adsorbed h atoms encounter each other , an h@xmath0 molecule may form ( @xcite;@xcite;@xcite;@xcite;@xcite;@xcite;@xcite;@xcite;@xcite;@xcite;@xcite ) .",
    "the steady state production rate of molecular hydrogen , @xmath3 ( @xmath4 s@xmath5 ) can be expressed by    @xmath6    where @xmath7 ( @xmath4 ) and @xmath8 ( cm s@xmath5 ) are the number density and the speed of h atoms in the gas phase , respectively , @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) is the average cross - sectional area of a grain and @xmath11 ( @xmath4 ) is the number density of dust grains .",
    "the parameter @xmath12 is the fraction of h atoms striking the grain that eventually form a molecule , namely @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the probability that an h adatom on the surface will recombine with another h atom to form h@xmath0 .",
    "the probability @xmath1 for an h atom to become adsorbed on a grain surface covered by an ice mantle was calculated by buch and zhang ( 1991 ) and masuda et al .",
    "they found that @xmath1 depends on the surface temperature and on the energy of the irradiation beam .",

    "it was assumed that the total grain mass is about @xmath20 of the hydrogen mass in the cloud , with a single grain size of @xmath21 m and a grain - mass density of @xmath22 ( gram @xmath4 ) ( @xcite ) . under these assumptions , for gas temperature of 100 k and @xmath23 , one obtains @xmath24 ( @xmath17 s@xmath5 ) , in agreement with observations for diffuse clouds ( @xcite ) .",
    "more recent observations in photon dominated regions , indicate that in these regions the rate coefficient should be @xmath25 ( @xmath17 s@xmath5 ) , in order to account for the observed h@xmath0 abundance ( @xcite ) .",
    "in the last few years , the formation of molecular hydrogen on interstellar dust analogues was studied in a series of laboratory experiments ( @xcite;@xcite;@xcite;@xcite;@xcite ) . in these experiments ,",
    "beams of h and d atoms were irradiated on the surface . the production of hd molecules was measured both during irradiation and during a subsequent temperature programmed desorption ( tpd ) experiment . in this experiment ,",
    "the temperature of the sample is raised quickly to either desorb particles ( atoms and molecules ) that got trapped on the surface or to enhance their diffusion and subsequent reaction and desorption .",
    "the formation of molecular hydrogen was studied on samples of polycrystalline olivine ( @xcite;@xcite ) , amorphous carbon ( @xcite ) and various types of amorphous ice samples , namely high density ice ( hdi ) and low density ice ( ldi ) ( @xcite;@xcite;@xcite ) .",
    "the results of the tpd experiments , particularly on polycrystalline olivine and hdi , show second order kinetics for low coverage of h and d atoms on the surface . in second order kinetics",
    "the peak shifts towards higher temperature as the coverage is reduced .",
    "this is due to the larger distancees that atoms need to diffuse before they encounter each other and recombine .",
    "this indicates that on these samples the surface mobility of h and d atoms is dominated by thermal hopping rather than tunneling .",
    "if tunneling was dominant , molecules could form efficiently during irradiation , resulting in first order kinetics .",
    "the results of the tpd experiments were analyzed using rate equation models ( @xcite;@xcite;@xcite;@xcite ) .",
    "the analysis involves fitting the parameters of the rate equations to the experimental tpd curves .",
    "the most important parameters are the activation energy barriers for diffusion and desorption of hydrogen atoms on the surface .",

    "( 2005 ) take into account only physisorption sites and thermal hopping between them .",
    "the models of cazaux and tielens ( 2002;2004 ) also take into account tunneling and chemisorption sites .",
    "however , the two analyses are in agreement on the fact that tunneling between physisorption sites appears to be too slow to play an important role in the tpd experiments ( @xcite ) . furthermore , recent experiments and calculations indicate that there are energy barriers which are likely to prevent adsorbed h and d atoms from entering chemisorption sites at these low temperatures .    using the parameters obtained in the laboratory experiments",
    ", the rate equations enabled the extrapolation from laboratory time scales to astrophysical time scales . using rate equations ,",
    "the efficiency of molecular hydrogen formation on these surfaces under interstellar conditions and its dependence on the flux and grain temperature were calculated .",
    "it was found that the recombination efficiency strongly depends on the grain temperature .",
    "each sample exhibits a narrow window of high efficiency along the temperature axis . for the polycrystalline olivine sample ,",

    "the hopping rate of an h atoms is    @xmath47    where @xmath48 is the activation energy barrier for h diffusion . throughout this paper",
    "we use the parameters obtained experimentally for amorphous carbon , namely the activation energies are @xmath49 mev and @xmath50 mev ( @xcite ) , and the density of adsorption sites on the surface is @xmath51 ( sites @xmath38 ) ( @xcite ) . for the density of hydrogen atoms in the gas phase",

    "the rate @xmath57 is approximately the inverse of the time @xmath58 required for an atom to visit nearly all the adsorption sites on the grain surface .",
    "this is due to the fact that in two dimensions the number of distinct sites visited by a random walker is linearly proportional to the number of steps , up to a logarithmic correction ( @xcite )",
    ".    the formation of h@xmath0 molecules on interstellar dust grains can be described by the rate equation    @xmath59    the first term on the right hand side describes the flux of h atoms , the second term describes the desorption of h atoms and the third term describes the diffusion and recombination .",
    "here we assume , for simplicity , that all h@xmath0 molecules desorb from the surface upon formation .",

    "however , in the limit of small grains under low flux they become unsuitable .",
    "this is because they ignore the fluctuations as well as the discrete nature of the populations of atoms on the grain ( @xcite;@xcite;@xcite;@xcite ) .",
    "for example , as the number of h atoms on a grain fluctuates in the range of 0 , 1 or 2 , the h@xmath0 formation rate can not be obtained from the average number alone .",

    "interstellar dust grains exhibit a broad size distribution between several nano - meters and fractions of a micron .",
    "this distribution can be approximated by a power law of the form ( @xcite;@xcite )    @xmath90    where @xmath91 ( @xmath4 ) is the density of grains with radii in the range @xmath92 in the cloud .",
    "this distribution is bounded between the upper cutoff @xmath93 and the lower cutoff @xmath94 .",
    "the exponent is @xmath95 ( @xcite ) . clearly , this distribution is dominated by the small grains .",
    "this fact has important implications on the formation rate of molecular hydrogen .",
    "the total surface area is much larger than in the case of a homogeneous population of grains with radii of the order of @xmath96 , with the same total mass density of about @xmath20 of the hydrogen mass density .",
    "this tends to enhance the h@xmath0 formation rate .",
    "however , below some grain size the efficiency of h@xmath0 formation is sharply reduced . due to these competing effects the production of molecular hydrogen",
    "should be integrated over the whole range of grain sizes .    in fig .",
    "2 we present the rate coefficient @xmath16 ( @xmath17 s@xmath5 ) vs. grain temperature for the case of a power - law distribution of grain sizes ( solid line ) and for the case in which all grains are of radius @xmath21 m , with the same total mass of grains .",
    "it turns out that within the temperature window in which h@xmath0 formation is efficient , the increase in the total surface area due to the broad size distribution , enhances the production rate by about an order of magnitude compared to a homogeneous population of sub - micron size grains ( @xcite ) .",
    "this is in spite of the reduced efficiency of h@xmath0 formation on small grains .",

    "the dashed line shows the rate coefficient for the case in which the same mass of grains consists of a homogeneous population of `` classical grains '' of radius @xmath21m.,width=432,height=528 ]",
    "the laboratory experiments on interstellar dust analogues have shown that h@xmath0 formation on dust grains is efficient within a range of grain temperatures below 20 k. however , high abundances of h@xmath0 have also been observed in warmer clouds , including photon - dominated regions ( pdrs ) , where grain temperatures may reach 50 k. the possible effect of grain porosity on h@xmath0 formation was recently examined using a rate equation model ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is found that porosity extends the temperature range in which h@xmath0 formation is efficient towards higher temperatures .",
    "this is because h atoms that desorb from the internal surfaces of the pores may re - adsorb many times and thus stay longer on the surface .",
    "however , this extension is expected to be of only several degrees ( k ) and by itself can not account for the formation of molecular hydrogen in pdrs .",
    "another effect of porosity that may be relevant to molecular hydrogen formation is that porous grains may be significantly colder than predicted by models which use compact , spherical grains ( @xcite;@xcite ) .",
    "while models of spherical grains predict grain temperatures in the range of @xmath97 k in pdrs , the actual temperatures of porous interstellar grains may thus be significantly lower . in the most favorable cases ,",
    "the grain temperatures may go down to the range of @xmath98 k for large grains and to @xmath99 k for small grains ( @xcite ) .",
    "unlike the h@xmath0 molecules in the interstellar medium which do not form efficiently in the gas phase , hd molecules have an efficient gas - phase formation mechanism .",
    "it consists of a sequence of reactions in which an ionized d atom reacts with an h@xmath0 molecule to form hd .",
    "the possibility that in diffuse clouds some hd molecules are also formed on grain surfaces was recently examined ( @xcite ) . due to the lower abundance of d atoms vs. h atoms ( by a factor of about @xmath100 ) , the master equation is required for such calculations even on relatively large grains . in case that d atoms bound more strongly to the surface than h atoms , the temperature window in which hd formation is efficient is extended towards higher temperatures , compared to the range of efficient h@xmath0 formation .",
    "the assumption that d atoms are more strongly bound to the grains is plausible , but so far has not been confirmed experimentally .",
    "the master equation can be generalized to describe complex reaction networks of multiple species on grain surfaces .",
    "recently , it was applied to the study of the reaction network that lead to the formation of h@xmath0co and ch@xmath101oh on grains ( @xcite;@xcite ) .",
    "such surface reaction networks are dominated by h atoms because hydrogen is the most abundant specie and also because it reacts with most of the other atomic and molecular species adsorbed on grain surfaces .",
    "furthermore , hydrogen atoms hop on the surface much faster than other adsorbed species and thus quickly react with other species even at very low coverages . for such reaction networks ,",
    "the dynamical variables in the master equation are the probabilities @xmath102 that there are @xmath103 copies of specie x on the grain .",
    "setting suitable cutoffs , each population of each specie is limited to @xmath104 .",
    "the problem is that as the number of reactive species increases , the number of coupled equations in the master equation increases exponentially , limiting the feasibility of this approach .",
    "using the fact that the reaction networks are usually sparse , it is possible to dramatically reduce the number of equations ( @xcite ) .",
    "this makes the master equation applicable even for complex surface reaction networks with a large number of reactive species .",
    "the master equation can be solved either by direct integration , as described above , or by monte carlo ( mc ) methods ( @xcite ) .",
    "a significant advantage of direct integration is that the equations can be easily coupled to the rate equations of gas - phase chemistry .",
    "furthermore , a single run of the direct integration method provides the entire probability distribution of populations of adsorbed species for the simulated conditions as well as the reaction rates .",
    "this is in contrast with the mc methods , which typically require large computational resources due to the need to accumulate much statistical information .",
    "we have presented the master equation approach for the evaluation of molecular hydrogen formation rates on interstellar dust grains .",
    "this approach is required in the limit of small grains and low flux where the population of hydrogen atoms on each grain is small . in this limit , the reaction rate is dominated by fluctuations .",
    "thus , the rate equation approach , which incorporates the mean - field approximation fails .",
