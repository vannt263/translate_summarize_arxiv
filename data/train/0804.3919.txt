    "the landau quantization@xmath0 of electron states manifests itself in oscillations of various physical quantities as functions of the applied magnetic field .",
    "the magnetoresistance oscillations in solids belong to the most fundamental quantum phenomena of this kind@xmath1 .",
    "in particular , the shubnikov - de haas oscillations@xmath1 ( sdho ) originating from sequential passage of the landau levels through the fermi level , are always present in three - dimensional ( 3d ) and two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron system with metallic type of conductivity .",
    "investigation of these oscillations is a powerful source of information about band structure , fermi surface , and electron interaction mechanisms .",
    "the sdho are strongly damped with increasing temperature as the thermal broadening of the fermi distribution exceeds the cyclotron energy . in quasi-2d electron systems , which are realized in quantum wells with two ( or more ) occupied subbands ,",
    "the possibility of intersubband transitions of electrons leads to another kind of magnetoresistance oscillations@xmath2 which are not damped considerably when the temperature raises .",
    "such oscillations , known as the magneto - intersubband oscillations ( miso ) , have been studied in single quantum wells with two populated 2d subbands@xmath3 and , theoretically , in 2d layers where electron states are split owing to the spin - orbit interaction@xmath4 .",
    "the physical mechanism of the miso is the periodic modulation of the probability of intersubband transitions by the magnetic field as the different landau levels of the two subbands sequentially come in alignment .",
    "oscillations of similar origin are present in 3d systems such as layered organic conductors with weak coupling between the layers.@xmath5    as compared to the sdho , the miso show a stronger suppression by the disorder , so their observation requires clean ( high - mobility ) samples .",
    "a decrease of the miso amplitude with increasing temperature reflects temperature dependence of the quantum lifetime of electrons .",
    "experimental studies of the miso allow one to determine the quantum lifetimes in the region of temperatures where the sdho disappear completely .",
    "another advantage of the miso is the possibility of direct and precise determination of the intersubband energy gap , which otherwise can be found from an analysis of the double periodicity of the sdho observed at low temperatures in various quasi-2d electron systems such as single quantum wells with two populated 2d subbands,@xmath6 double quantum wells,@xmath7 and 2d systems with spin - orbit splitting.@xmath8    the double quantum wells ( dqws ) , which consist of two quantum wells separated by a barrier , and where the electrons occupy two 2d subbands coupled by tunneling , should be recognized as the most convenient system for studying the miso phenomenon , owing to the unique possibility to control both intersubband energy gap and probabilities of intersubband transitions in a wide range by using barriers of different widths and biasing the structure by external gates .",
    "nevertheless , no studies of the miso have been reported so far for these particular systems . in this paper",
    "we report on the first observation and systematic investigation of the miso in symmetric high - mobility ( @xmath9 @xmath10/vs ) gaas dqws with different barrier widths . along with the experimental results , we present a theoretical description of magnetotransport in dqws , which explains the results of our measurements .",

    "as the system is driven out of the balance by the gates ( @xmath113 increases ) , the wave functions for @xmath66 and @xmath65 subbands are localized in the different wells , and intersubband scattering is suppressed , so the miso amplitude ( coefficient @xmath114 ) is reduced , while the non - oscillating positive manetoresistance ( coefficient @xmath115 ) becomes larger .",
    "this behavior is seen in experiment ( fig .",

    "this feature , also seen in our experiment , is described by the fact that the total density of states , @xmath118 $ ] , given by a superposition of the densities of states in @xmath65 and @xmath66 subbands , does not oscillate with energy under the condition @xmath119 , so the magnetic field has no effect on the scattering and resistivity under this condition .",

    "a good agreement is also obtained for lower temperatures , when the sdho are present . above 0.4 t ,",
    "the observed miso frequency becomes slightly smaller than expected from the theory .",
    "we do not know exact origin of this discrepancy , and assume that it is possibly related to modification of the tunnel coupling by the magnetic field.@xmath126    the amplitude fit of the miso in a wide region of temperatures allows us to plot the temperature dependence of the quantum lifetime of electrons .",
    "we have found that @xmath124 is constant at @xmath127 k and decreases at higher temperatures .",
    "this decrease can not be attributed to quasielastic scattering of electrons by acoustic phonons , because the acoustic - phonon scattering rates in gaas quantum wells are more than one order smaller in the described temperature region . on the other hand",
    ", the consideration of electron - electron scattering in dqws@xmath128 gives a reasonable explanation of the observed temperature behavior . to prove this ,",
    "we have compared the experimental dependence shown in the insert to fig .",
    "4 with the theoretically predicted dependence@xmath128 @xmath129 $ ] , where @xmath130 and @xmath131 is a numerical coefficient of the order of unity , considered here as a single fitting parameter . using the experimentally determined values @xmath132 mev and @xmath133 mev , we have found a good agreement between experiment and theory in the whole temperature region for @xmath134 .",
    "in conclusion , we have observed and investigated the magnetoresistance oscillations caused by resonant modulation of elastic intersubband scattering in dqws by landau quantization .",
    "these oscillations survive at high temperatures and represent a prominent and well - reproducible feature of magnetotransport in high - mobility dqws .",
    "the oscillations we observe are caused by the same physical mechanism as the magneto - intersubband oscillations ( miso ) previously studied in single quantum wells with two populated subbands .",
    "however , there are qualitatively different features in manifestation of the miso phenomenon in dqws .",
    "first , since the fermi energy in dqws is typically much larger than the subband separation , the miso have a large period as compared to the sdho period , and they are clearly identifiable without an additional fourier analysis . for the same reason , one can observe all intersubband resonances up to the last one , when the cyclotron energy equals the subband separation , in relatively weak magnetic fields ( see fig .",
    "next , since the intesubband scattering is dqws is easily controllable by modifying the wave functions of electrons via the gate , the miso appear to be very sensitive to the gate voltage .",
    "we also point out that observation of the large - amplitude miso requires large quantum lifetimes and high probability of intersubband scattering .",
    "these two requirements are difficult to satisfy simultaneously in single quantum wells with two populated subbands , because large quantum lifetimes are usually attainable in the modulation - doped systems , where the scattering probability strongly decreases with increasing momentum transfer , and the intersubband scattering , which requires a large momentum transfer , is suppressed.@xmath33 in contrast , the intersubband scattering in dqws does not require a large momentum transfer , and its probability is comparable to the probability of intrasubband scattering .",
    "theoretical consideration of the magnetotransport in dqws leads to an analytical expression for the oscillating resistivity which survives at high temperatures , the last term in eq .",
    "this expression , as far as we know , has not been derived previously .",
    "its simple form is a consequence of symmetric scattering , when the subbands are characterized by a single quantum lifetime @xmath124 , common for both subbands .",
    "the quantum lifetime can be extracted from the sdho amplitudes at low temperatures , while the measurements of the miso amplitudes allow us to find its temperature dependence in a wide region of temperatures .",
    "this dependence becomes an independent confirmation of the influence of electron - electron scattering on the quantum lifetime of 2d electrons ."
