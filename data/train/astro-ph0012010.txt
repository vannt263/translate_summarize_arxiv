    "distances of pne are usually difficult to determine and are a long standing problem of pne investigations .",
    "the vast majority of published distances of pne are based on the shklovsky ( @xcite ) method or derivatives of it ( often called statistical distances ) .",
    "this method allows the calculation of pn distances from the measurement of the recombination line h@xmath0  and the angular diameter . however , shklovsky distances are notoriously smaller than distances derived from model atmosphere analysis of the central stars ( cf .",
    "mndez @xcite ) .",
    "the question of pne space densities and birth rates is closely related to the distance scale problem .",
    "ishida & weinberger ( @xcite ) compiled a list of nearby pne , which contains mostly old , evolved nebulae ( actually many of our pne were selected from this list ) .",
    "ishida & weinberger collected distance determinations from literature and computed the space density and birth rates of this local sample of pne .",
    "the derived birth rate of @xmath1 is too high to be in accordance with estimates of white dwarf birth rates ( @xmath2 ; weidemann @xcite ) . since every central star of a pn ( cspn ) should become a white dwarf this yielded a real dilemma . taken at face value this",
    "would indicate that current white dwarf samples are very incomplete and the white dwarf birth rates are seriously underestimated .",
    "a certain fraction of white dwarfs may be hidden in binaries , indeed .",
    "weidemann ( @xcite ) used a very local sample of white dwarfs ( @xmath3pc ) for his estimate and applied corrections for incompleteness and binarity .",
    "pottasch ( @xcite ) reevaluated the pn space density and derived a value of @xmath4 , lower than ishida & weinberger s result , but still higher than the estimated white dwarf birthrate .",
    "the difference in the pne birthrate can be traced back to the use of different distance scales .",
    "while ishida & weinberger s collection is mainly based on statistical distance estimates ( mainly shklovsky distances and derivates of this method ) , pottasch excluded statistical distance determinations .    in paper  iv of this series ( napiwotzki @xcite ) we presented the results of an nlte model atmosphere analysis of 27 central stars of old pne .",
    "this analysis of a reasonably sized sample of central stars of old pne enables us to address the question of the distance scale of these objects . in paper",
    "iii ( napiwotzki & schnberner @xcite ) we proposed the use of the interstellar nad lines for distance determinations .",
    "these distances are free of assumptions about the nebula or the central star and are on average larger than the shklovsky distances by a factor of 2.5 for our sample of old pne . during the last years",
    "a number of trigonometric parallax measurements became available for a sample of central stars of old pne ( harris et al .",
    "@xcite , pottasch & acker @xcite , gutirrez - moreno et al .",
    "we will show that the cspne distances derived form our model atmosphere analysis , the nad distances , and the trigonometric parallaxes are in agreement , but all three distances scales are much larger than those based on the shklovsky method .",
    ".model atmosphere fluxes ( in @xmath5erg@xmath6s@xmath7@xmath7 ) at @xmath8for the calculation of absolute magnitudes and distances .",
    "these values are calculated for a hydrogen - rich composition ( @xmath9 ) and @xmath10 .",
    "however , the @xmath11 band flux is quite insensitive to composition and @xmath12 [ cols=\">,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     our simple description of the galactic disk is based on the galaxy model of bienaym et al .",
    "( @xcite ) . an exponential density law with a scale height @xmath13 of 300pc",
    "is adopted for the cspn .",
    "this corresponds to a stellar population with an age of @xmath14yrs .",
    "we included extinction by a dust component with a scale height @xmath15pc , which is the value appropriate for the interstellar matter .",
    "a dust opacity at the position of the sun @xmath16mag / kpc was chosen .",
    "the stellar and dust density decreases exponentially with the distance from the galactic center and a scale length @xmath17kpc . for the distance of the sun from the galactic center we adopted the standard value of 8.5kpc .",
    "let us note that kppen & vergely ( @xcite ) could successfully reproduce the extinction properties of galactic bulge pne with our parameter values .",
    "our parameter study in table  [ t : mcvar ] shows that the influence of particular values of the parameters of our `` galactic model '' are very small . due to the exponential decrease of stellar density with height above the galactic plane the number of stars within a sphere with a given radius @xmath18 increases less",
    "then @xmath19 .",
    "since this lower the numbers of far away stars , a lower bias is expected for lower values of the scale height .",
    "extinction introduces another selection against far away stars ( through the limiting magnitude ) .",
    "however , as table  [ t : mcvar ] proofs the effect of varying these parameters within reasonable limits is quite small .    for a given post - agb age",
    "the absolute magnitudes of cspne can be computed from theoretical post - agb tracks . in principle a mass distribution for the cspne should be used . however , since the mass distributions of cspn and white dwarfs are quite narrow , we considered it sufficient to use only one theoretical track for simplicity .",
    "spectroscopic studies of cspne ( paper  iv ) , white dwarfs ( bergeron et al .",
    "@xcite , napiwotzki et al .",
    "@xcite ) and an investigation of pne based on a distant independent method by stasiska et al .",
    "( @xcite ) derived peak masses in the range @xmath20 .",
    "thus we selected the @xmath21 post - agb track of blcker ( @xcite ) for our simulation .",
    "the post - agb age was varied within a given interval @xmath22 which approximately reproduces the @xmath23 distribution of our cspne .",
    "however the simulation results are quite insensitive to their particular values ( cf .  table  [ t : mcvar ] ) .      1 .",
    "we simulated a `` spectroscopic analysis '' with a random measurement error .",
    "we adopted a standard value for the scatter of the absolute magnitude determination of @xmath24 ( gaussian error distribution ) .",
    "this corresponds to the mean of the errors given in table  [ t : dist ] .",
    "if the `` spectroscopic analysis '' indicates that the distance of the cspn is below a given maximum value @xmath25 the star was selected for `` parallax measurement '' .",
    "3 .   the parallax is `` measured '' with an gaussian error distribution with @xmath26 .",
    "our standard value of @xmath26 is 0.95mas .",
    "that is the mean error of the parallax measurements provided in table  [ t : dist ] .",
    "a parallax measurement is used for distance determination if the value is larger than a lower limit @xmath27 .",
    "we chose @xmath28mas , corresponding to the value measured for .",
    "this process was repeated until @xmath29 distance determinations were performed .",
    "the standard value of @xmath29 is 8 , the number of cspne with parallax measurements in table  [ t : dist ] .",
    "the mean value of @xmath30 was computed with the same method as used for our observed sample ( cf .  section  2.2 . ) .",
    "5 .   to derive a proper statistic this simulation",
    "was repeated @xmath31 times .",
    "the best values given in table  [ t : mcvar ] and in section  2.3 are the median values .",
    "@xmath32 values were computed from the condition that they should include 68.3% of the simulations .",
    "results from repeated runs yielded results , which did nt deviate by more than 1% .    the effect of the most important input parameters , the threshold value @xmath25 for the pre - selection of stars , the parallax measurement error @xmath33 and the threshold parallax @xmath27 , is discussed in section  2.2 .",
