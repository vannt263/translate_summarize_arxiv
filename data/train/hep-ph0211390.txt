    "a series of rare elementary processes involving more than two particles in the final state are going to be measured with increasing precision .",
    "the multiplicity of the final state makes it difficult to extract predictions by the standard gauge theories even if semplifications arise when either partecipants are all massless or only some of the external particles are massive",
    ". however more accurate rate measurements of processes with heavy quark hadrons in the final state will soon be available as is the case of the chorus experiment where direct evidence for the associate charm production in charged current neutrino nucleon scattering has been shown @xcite . in the one loop calculation of such processes we encounter pentagon integrals with a massive line as skeched in figure 1 where massive particles are bold , massless ones thin and dashed ones can be either massive or not .",
    "in general the inclusion of masses makes things more involved , although the calculation simplifies when either external masses are equal to each other or they are equal to the internal masses or both eventualities occur as it is often the case in normal gauge theories .",
    "recently a lot of progress has been made in the technics for perturbative calculations with different approaches .",
    "a non - comprehensive list is given in @xcite and reference therein and in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . in particular adopting the dimensional regularization approach for feynman parametrized integrand the authors of ref.@xcite derived simplifications and recursion formulas by the implementation of algebraic technic . using these methods the problem of the evaluation of a one loop @xmath0 points scalar integral",
    "is translated to the evaluation of a combination of @xmath1 points scalar integrals and the original @xmath0 points integral in @xmath2 dimensions ; moreover the original @xmath0 points one loop integral can be represented as the solution of a partial differential equation system . in the present paper",
    "we use this approach to perform the calculation of the pentagon integral represented in figure 1 .",
    "other massive pentagon integrals have been recently evaluated in next to leading order calculations of processes in which an higgs particle can be generated at hadron colliders .",
    "in particular two independent groups report the nlo corrections for the process in which an higgs particle is generated together with a @xmath3 pair , @xcite and @xcite . another nlo calculation involving massive pentagon integrals",
    "is given in @xcite in which the final state considered consists of an higgs particle plus two jets .",
    "the general methods employed here do not concern with the specific processes and the results must be analitically continued to describe a specific process .",
    "finally only the most simple tensor integral is given while we postpone other cases to a dedicated paper @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follow : in section ii relevant formulas from ref.@xcite are collected , in section iii they are applied to the scalar massive pentagon represented in figure 1 transforming it in a combination of four points integrals ; section iv is devoted to four point integrals evaluation and in section v more simple tensor integral ( vector ) is given with the conclusions .",
    "the initial condition for the differential equations originated in the four points evaluation are calculated in the appendix .",
    "the starting point is the integral in @xmath4 dimensions @xmath5 with the momenta @xmath6 taken to be outgoing , @xmath7 and @xmath8 applying feynman parametrization , wick rotating and integrating over loop momentum this integral can be cast in the form @xmath9 @xmath10 with @xmath11 and the matrix @xmath12 given by @xmath13 with @xmath14 and @xmath15 for @xmath16 .",
