    "the spectra are created by passing light through both an echelle grating and cross  dispersing prism .",
    "although observing in a single order allows for up to 256 fibers to be used simultaneously , the cross ",
    "disperser permits order stacking at the expense of using fewer fibers .",
    "several post  fiber spectrograph slit widths are available that range from 18045@xmath26 m and provide a resolving power of r@xmath7@xmath27/@xmath22@xmath27=20,00038,000 , respectively ( mateo et al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "specific to this project , we developed a spectrograph setup mode that employs a wide band order blocking filter (  bulge@xmath28gc1 \" ) providing continuous wavelength coverage from @xmath1861206720   over 6 consecutive orders ( 5853 ; see also table 1 ) .",
    "this reduces the maximum number of available fibers from 256 to 48 ( 24 per spectrograph channel ) , but is roughly equivalent in terms of efficiency to a system such as flames  giraffe .",

    "an internal littrow ghost reflection ( e.g. , burgh et al . 2007 ) affecting the middle columns of both ccds was discovered when using this setup ; however , the reflection only interferes with a roughly 510   wide region in some orders of some fibers and is easily avoided in the reduced spectra .",
    "our observations used a 4 amp slow readout , 2@xmath291 ( spatial@xmath29dispersion ) binning , and the 125@xmath26 m slits to achieve a resolving power of r=22,500 .",
    "we placed 42 fibers on potential 47 tuc agb stars and 5 fibers on blank sky regions .",
    "only one available fiber was left unassigned .",
    "since the agb stars in 47 tuc are relatively bright ( v@xmath514 ; see also figure [ f2 ] ) and the observing conditions were good ( fwhm@xmath51@xmath25 ) , a set of 3@xmath291200 second exposures was sufficient to produce a signal  to  noise ratio ( s / n ) of about 100 per resolution element .",

    "the basic data reduction procedures , including bias correction and trimming the overscan regions , were carried out using the iraf task _",

    "the full wavelength range spanned by each order is listed in table 1 . however , as is evident in figure [ f1 ] , the s / n decreases near the edges of each order .",

    "the final (  effective \" ) wavelength coverage of each order after carrying out this procedure is given in table 1 .",
    "we also chose to remove , rather than combine , overlapping regions between orders because there is a small difference in resolution between the bluer and redder orders .",
    "a sample m2fs spectrum with all orders merged is shown in figure [ f4 ] .",
    "the model atmosphere parameters effective temperature ( t@xmath31 ) , surface gravity ( log(g ) ) , metallicity ( [ fe / h ] ) , and microturbulence ( vt ) were determined spectroscopically and in a manner identical to that used for the flames  giraffe sample of cordero et al .",
    "specifically , t@xmath31 was determined by removing trends in log @xmath12(fe i ) as a function of excitation potential , log(g ) was determined by enforcing ionization equilibrium with the fe i and fe ii lines , and vt was determined by removing trends in log @xmath12(fe i ) as a function of line strength .",

    "this brings both data sets into agreement at @xmath0[fe / h]@xmath2=0.73 .",

    "the large dispersion in [ na / fe ] is typical for globular clusters ( e.g. , see reviews by kraft 1994 ; gratton et al .",

    "the possible temperature scale difference between the agb and rgb samples also affects sodium .",

    "order 55 was selected because it exhibits several strong lines but does not contain many problematic features ( e.g. , telluric bands ; unusually strong or broad lines ) .",

    "all of the stars observed with m2fs have velocities consistent with cluster membership .",
    "recent work mentioned in section 1 suggests that agb and rgb stars in some globular clusters may show distinctly different chemical compositions .",
    "in particular , the agb populations are suspected of having systematically lower ratios of second generation ( cn  strong ; na  enhanced ; he  enhanced ) to first generation ( cn  weak ; na  poor ; he  normal ) stars , compared to the rgb populations .",
    "evidence linking the minimum mass and blue extension of stars along the horizontal branch to the agb / rgb star count ratio ( gratton et al .",
    "2010 ) indicates that the apparent composition difference between agb and rgb stars is likely due to some rgb stars not evolving through the agb phase , rather than an _ in situ _ process altering the envelope composition of some stars before or after the horizontal branch phase .",
    "the apparent loss of na  rich second generation stars between the rgb and agb is most evident in the metal  poor blue horizontal branch cluster ngc 6752 , which has a na  poor / na  rich ratio of 30:70 on the rgb and a 100:0 ratio on the agb ( campbell et al . 2013 ) .",
    "furthermore , sandquist & bolte ( 2004 ) note that ngc 6752 exhibits a low ratio of agb to horizontal branch stars , and interpret this observation as an indication that some fraction of rgb stars fail to evolve through the agb phase .",
    "since the number of dedicated studies comparing rgb and agb abundance patterns is still small ( e.g. , see campbell et al .",
    "2006 ; their table 1 ) , evidence is insufficient to determine whether the peculiar lack of na  rich agb stars in ngc 6752 is more the exception or the rule . therefore , the data provided here offer insight into a possible counter example .",
    "47 tuc is approximately 10@xmath29 more massive than ngc 6752 ( e.g. , pryor & meylan 1993 ) , 7@xmath29 more metal  rich , contains almost exclusively red horizontal branch stars ( e.g. , lee et al .",
    "1994 ; see also figure [ f2 ] ) , and has a high agb / rgb ratio ( gratton et al .",
    "2010 ) . in the left panels of figure [ f7 ]",
    ", we compare the [ na / fe ] abundances between the agb and rgb samples in 47 tuc as a function of t@xmath31 , as a binned distribution , and as a cumulative distribution .",
    "the agb [ na / fe ] distribution appears to be shifted to lower values than the rgb population , and also has fewer stars with [ na / fe]@xmath37@xmath150.4 but more with [ na / fe]@xmath36@xmath150.1 .",
    "after correcting for the agb / rgb temperature scale differences , comparing only the average values yields @xmath0[na / fe]@xmath2=@xmath150.23 for the agb sample and @xmath0[na / fe]@xmath2=@xmath150.35 for the rgb flames  giraffe sample . similarly , the ratio of na  poor to na  rich stars is 63:37 for the agb sample and 45:55 for the rgb sample=@xmath150.29 , after accounting for the agb / rgb temperature scale difference , and is based on the rgb [ na / fe ] distribution ( see also figure [ f7 ] ) . ] .",
    "the 0.12 dex average [ na / fe ] abundance difference between agb and rgb stars in 47 tuc is similar to , though less extreme than , the 0.34 dex average difference found by campbell et al .",
    "( 2013 ) for ngc 6752 ( see also the right panels of figure [ f7 ] ) .",
    "however , an examination of the dispersion ( @xmath4 ) and interquartile range ( iqr ) values of the agb and rgb stars in 47 tuc , which are mostly insensitive to systematic reduction or analysis differences between data sets , reveals that the two populations are similar .",
    "specifically , the 47 tuc agb stars have @xmath4@xmath38=0.17 and iqr@xmath38=0.23 and the rgb stars have @xmath4@xmath39=0.18 and iqr@xmath39=0.27",
    ". these values strongly contrast with the results of ngc 6752 in which the agb has @xmath4@xmath38=0.09 and iqr@xmath38=0.10 and the rgb has @xmath4@xmath39=0.28 and iqr@xmath39=0.37 .",
    "the stark contrast in agb / rgb [ na / fe ] dispersion and iqr distributions between the two clusters suggests that only a small fraction ( @xmath3620@xmath6 ) of na  rich rgb stars in 47 tuc fail to evolve through at least the early agb phase , instead of the 100@xmath6 fraction observed in ngc 6752 .",
    "color  magnitude diagram analyses also support the notion that both na  poor and na  rich rgb stars evolve through the horizontal branch and early agb phases in 47 tuc . aside from previous spectroscopic detections of both cn",
    " strong ( na  rich ) and cn  weak ( na  poor ) stars on 47 tuc s agb ( e.g. , mallia 1978 ; briley 1997 ) , we note that monelli et al .",
    "( 2013 ) make use of the ( u  b)(b  i ) color index , which is correlated with [ na / fe ] , and find a bimodal agb color spread .",
    "these data indicate that at least two stellar populations , containing roughly equal proportions but with different light element chemistry , are present along 47 tuc s agb .",
    "furthermore , color ",
    "magnitude diagrams do not show a significant population of blue horizontal branch stars that may fail to ascend the agb ( e.g. , anderson et al .",
    "2009 ; bergbusch & stetson 2009 ; dieball et al .",
    "2009 ; milone et al .",
    "2012 ) , and stars spanning the entire rgb [ na / fe ] range are found on the red horizontal branch ( gratton et al .",
    "this contrasts with the color  magnitude diagram of ngc 6752 , which shows a significant population of blue and extreme horizontal branch stars ( e.g. , grundahl et al .",
    "1999 ) , and also is known to contain agb  manqu stars ( e.g. , momany et al .",
    "however , the horizontal branch differences between 47 tuc and ngc 6752 are largely driven by metallicity , as is qualitatively illustrated in the isochrone tracks of figure [ f8 ] .",
    "since it is clear from figure [ f7 ] that the rgb and agb [ na / fe ] distributions are significantly different in absolute abundance _ and _ dispersion between 47 tuc and ngc 6752 , the question remains as to what ties together rgb composition and post  rgb evolution . as mentioned previously , a commonly adopted solution is that na  rich stars have a higher he abundance , and that the lower masses of he  rich / na  rich horizontal branch stars prevent them from evolving through the agb phase .",
    "at least for the extreme case of ngc 6752 , charbonnel et al .",
    "( 2013 ) note that stars with masses less than about 0.735 m@xmath19 and y@xmath140.31 do not ascend the agb",
    ". however , the required he  enhancements are significantly larger than those estimated from photometry ( @xmath22y@xmath180.030.04 ; milone et al .",
    "2013 ) , but charbonnel et al .",
    "( 2013 ) further suggest the maximum photometric he spread could be underestimated . for 47 tuc ,",
    "the he spread is estimated to be even smaller ( @xmath22y@xmath50.020.03 ; e.g. , di criscienzo et al .",
    "2010 ; nataf et al .",
    "2011 ; milone et al . 2012 ) than in ngc 6752 , and as figure [ f8 ] shows even rgb stars with y=0.3 are still likely to ascend the agb at 47 tuc s metallicity ( e.g. , see also valcarce et al .",
    "2012 and references therein ) .",
    "despite having significantly different metallicities and horizontal branch morphologies , the agb / rgb composition difference in 47 tuc may be more analagous to the case of m13 where johnson & pilachowski ( 2012 ) found that only the most na  rich _ and _ o  poor stars ( presumably also the most he  rich stars ) failed to reach the agb abundances for many stars in the agb data set because the preferred 6300    [ o i ] line was severely contaminated by telluric bands and the 6300 sky emission feature . ] .",
    "we note that the paucity of o  poor stars on m13 s agb , albeit from a sample of only @xmath1810 agb stars , is observed despite the failure ( so far ) of investigators to find a strongly he  enhanced population ( sandquist et al .",
    "2010 ; smith et al .",
    "could a different parameter be driving the agb / rgb composition disparity ?",
    "campbell et al .",
    "( 2013 ) proposed that , in addition to he enhancement for the na  rich stars , a substantial _ ad hoc _ increase in the mass loss rate ( 20@xmath29 the rgb value ) for ngc 6752 stars on the blue horizontal branch may be required to prevent further evolution up the agb .",
    "however , cassisi et al .",
    "( 2014 ) note that the required mass loss rate of @xmath1810@xmath40 m@xmath21 year@xmath3 is several orders of magnitude higher than those allowed by current analyses of hot horizontal branch and b subdwarf stars .",
    "additionally , horizontal branch simulations by cassisi et al .",
    "( 2014 ) that accurately reproduce the r@xmath41 parameter ( n@xmath42/n@xmath43 ) for ngc 6752 , m3 , and m13 , but do not invoke enhanced mass loss , also predict that @xmath1850@xmath6 of ngc 6752 s agb stars should be na  rich ( albeit with lower y than the most extreme values ) .",
    "these results indicate that enhanced mass loss for a particular subset of horizontal branch stars is unlikely to be the key link between rgb composition and post  rgb evolution .",
    "furthermore , even if processes associated with the radiative levitation of metals in blue horizontal branch stars played a role in mass loss and/or the subsequent envelope composition of agb stars , 47 tuc lacks a significant population of horizontal branch stars with t@xmath31@xmath1411,000 k that would experience this effect ( e.g. , behr et al .",
    "the data presented here indicate that the average [ na / fe ] abundance of agb stars in the galactic globular cluster 47 tuc is 0.12 dex lower than that of the rgb stars .",
    "additionally , the ratio of na  poor to na  rich agb stars is 63:37 compared to 45:55 for the rgb stars .",
    "however , both populations exhibit a similar dispersion and iqr of [ na / fe ] .",
    "this result strongly contrasts with that found by campbell et al .",
    "( 2013 ) in the globular cluster ngc 6752 where the agb consists of only na  poor stars with a small star  to  star [ na / fe ] dispersion .",
    "the 47 tuc [ na / fe ] distribution suggests that @xmath520@xmath6 of na  rich rgb stars fail to reach the early agb , which is similar to the case of m13 where only the most na  rich and o  poor stars are missing from the agb . for 47 tuc , the cluster s relatively high",
    "metallicity leads to a predominantly red horizontal branch morphology , and no significant population of hot horizontal branch and agb  manqu stars , which likely make up the missing na  rich component of ngc 6752 s ( and m13 s ) agb , has been found .",
    "unlike the case for ngc 6752 , however , in 47 tuc it seems that at least some na  rich rgb stars evolve through the early agb phase .",
    "we conclude that rgb [ na / fe ] abundances alone are not a unique predictor of future agb evolution in all clusters .",
    "several remaining questions must be addressed before a definitive link between stellar composition , cluster horizontal branch morphology , and agb evolution can be formed .",
    "for example , if he abundance , in addition to metallicity and age , is a significant factor in defining a globular cluster s horizontal branch morphology and a star s post  rgb evolution , why do the @xmath22y values estimated from photometry appear too low in a cluster such as ngc 6752 to prevent na  rich stars from ascending the agb",

    "enhancements actually underestimated , as was suggested by charbonnel et al .",
    "what roles do additional parameters such as mass loss , he core rotation , cno abundance , and/or environment play in defining a star s horizontal branch and eventual agb evolution ? what separates clusters such as 47 tuc and m13 , which lose only a fraction of na",
    " rich stars before the agb , to those such as ngc 6752 , which lose 100@xmath6 ?",
    "a deeper understanding of the critical parameters controlling horizontal branch and agb evolution , along with additional studies comparing large samples of rgb and agb chemical compositions , seems required in order to fully place the failure ( or not ) of some na  rich stars to ascend the agb into context with the developing narrative of forming multiple populations in globular clusters .",

    "<S> a recent analysis comparing the [ na / fe ] distributions of red giant branch ( rgb ) and asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars in the galactic globular cluster ngc 6752 found that the ratio of na  poor to na  rich stars changes from 30:70 on the rgb to 100:0 on the agb . </S>",
    "<S> the surprising paucity of na  rich stars on the agb in ngc 6752 warrants additional investigations to determine if the failure of a significant fraction of stars to ascend the agb is an attribute common to all globular clusters . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we present radial velocities , [ fe / h ] , and [ na / fe ] abundances for 35 agb stars in the galactic globular cluster 47 tucanae ( 47 tuc ; ngc 104 ) , and compare the agb [ na / fe ] distribution with a similar rgb sample published previously . </S>",
    "<S> the abundances and velocities were derived from high resolution spectra obtained with the michigan / magellan fiber system ( m2fs ) and mspec spectrograph on the magellan  </S>",

    "<S> we find the average heliocentric radial velocity and [ fe / h ] values to be @xmath0rv@xmath1@xmath2=18.56 km s@xmath3 ( @xmath4=10.21 km s@xmath3 ) and @xmath0[fe / h]@xmath2=0.68 ( @xmath4=0.08 ) , respectively , in agreement with previous literature estimates . </S>",
    "<S> the average [ na / fe ] abundance is 0.12 dex lower in the 47 tuc agb sample compared to the rgb sample , and the ratio of na  poor to na  rich stars is 63:37 on the agb and 45:55 on the rgb . </S>",
    "<S> however , in contrast to ngc 6752 , the two 47 tuc populations have nearly identical [ na / fe ] dispersion and interquartile range values . </S>",
    "<S> the data presented here suggest that only a small fraction ( @xmath520@xmath6 ) of na  rich stars in 47 tuc may fail to ascend the agb , which is a similar result to that observed in m13 . </S>",
    "<S> regardless of the cause for the lower average [ na / fe ] abundance in agb stars , we find that na  poor stars and at least some na  rich stars in 47 tuc evolve through the early agb phase . </S>",
    "<S> the contrasting behavior of na  rich stars in 47 tuc and ngc 6752 suggests that the rgb [ na / fe ] abundance alone is insufficient for predicting if a star will ascend the agb . </S>"
