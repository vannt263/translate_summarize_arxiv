    "evolutionary game theory ( egt ) provides a natural theoretical framework to describe the dynamics of systems where successful types or behaviors , as those arising in biology , ecology and economics  @xcite , are copied by imitation and spread .",
    "evolutionary stability is a crucial concept in egt and specifies under which circumstances a population is proof against invasion from mutants  @xcite .",
    "this notion was shown to be altered by finite - size fluctuations and led to the key concept of _ evolutionary stability in finite populations _",
    "the latter is closely related to the notion of _ fixation _",
    "@xcite , referring to the possibility for mutants to take over ( fixate ) an entire population of wild species individuals . furthermore",
    ", evolutionary dynamics is characterized by the interplay between random fluctuations  @xcite and selection , that underlies adaptation in terms of the different reproduction potential ( fitness ) of the individuals .",
    "thus , a parameter was introduced to measure the selection intensity  @xcite . in this context , the fixation probability of a species has been calculated for a finite two - species population in the weak selection limit of vanishingly small selection intensity  @xcite .",
    "this limit is often biologically relevant and greatly simplifies the analysis ( treating selection as a linear perturbation ) .",
    "however , the behaviors obtained under strong and weak selection are often qualitatively different ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . in this letter",
    ", we study fixation under non - vanishing selection in egt and provide a comprehensive analysis of the combined influence of non - vanishing selection and random fluctuations . as exact results for the fixation probability and mean fixation times ( mfts ) are rarely available and often unwieldy ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , our analysis relies on the wkb ( wentzel - kramers - brillouin ) approximation method  @xcite directly applied to the underlying master equation  @xcite .",
    "this technique was recently used to treat generic birth - death systems that undergo metastable switching or extinction  @xcite .",
    "importantly , here we generalize the wkb formalism to systems with _ multiple _ absorbing states .",
    "this theory accurately accounts for the large fluctuations not aptly captured  @xcite by the fokker - planck approximation ( fpa )  @xcite .",
    "we illustrate our method on two classes of prototypical models of cooperation dilemmas , the anti- coordination and coordination games , where a coexistence state separates two absorbing states in which the population is composed of only the fixated species while the other goes extinct  @xcite .",
    "we compute the fixation probabilities , the mfts , as well as the complete probability distribution function ( pdf ) of population sizes , and show that our theory is superior to the fpa for finite selection strength .",
    "in egt , the fitness , or reproduction potential of an individual , is determined by the outcome , called payoff , of its interaction with the others as prescribed by the underlying game  @xcite .",
    "in fact , when two @xmath1individuals interact , both receive a payoff @xmath2 .",
    "if an individual of type @xmath3 interacts with another of type @xmath4 , the former receives @xmath5 while the latter gets a payoff @xmath6 .",
    "similarly , when two @xmath7individuals interact , both get a payoff @xmath8 .",
    "now , assume that in a population of size @xmath9 there are @xmath10 individuals of type @xmath3 ( `` mutants '' ) and @xmath11 of type @xmath4 ( `` wild type '' ) .",
    "the respective average payoffs ( per individual ) are @xmath12b\\,$ ] and @xmath13d$ ]  @xcite , while the population mean payoff is @xmath14/n$ ] . for infinite ( @xmath15 ) and well - mixed populations , the density @xmath16 of the @xmath3 species changes according to its relative payoff and obeys the replicator dynamics , given by the rate equation  @xcite @xmath17 here , we are particularly interested in anti - coordination games ( acg ) , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 , and in coordination games ( cg ) , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "in addition to the absorbing states @xmath22 and @xmath23 , acg and cg admit an interior fixed point associated with the _ coexistence _ of @xmath3 and @xmath4 species at a density @xmath24 of @xmath3 s .",
    "according to the rate equation  ( [ rd ] ) , @xmath25 is an attractor in acg and a repellor in cg , whereas @xmath26 and @xmath27 are repelling fixed points in acg and attracting in cg .    to account for fluctuations arising when the population size is finite ,",
    "the evolutionary dynamics is implemented in terms of fitness - dependent birth - death processes  @xcite describing , e.g. , the evolution of the probability @xmath28 to have @xmath10 individuals of type @xmath3 at time @xmath29 : @xmath30p_n.\\ ] ] here , an individual chosen proportionally to its fitness produces an identical offspring which replaces a randomly chosen individual  @xcite , and the total population size @xmath9 is conserved .",
    "thus , in the master equation ( [ master ] ) , the reaction rates for the birth / death transitions @xmath31 are given by @xmath32 , where @xmath33 are functions of the fitness of each species , @xmath34 and @xmath35 . as often in egt , we focus on systems evolving according to the fitness - dependent _ moran process _ ( fmp ) for which @xmath36^{-1}$ ] and @xmath37^{-1}$ ]  @xcite .",
    "it is worth noticing that @xmath38 and @xmath39 intersect only at the fixed point value @xmath40 for @xmath41 , which ensures that the properties of the replicator dynamics  ( [ rd ] ) are recovered when @xmath15  @xcite .",
    "the fitnesses @xmath42 and @xmath43 are comprised of a baseline contribution [ the constant @xmath44 and a term accounting for selection [ @xmath45 for @xmath46 , where the parameter @xmath47 measures the selection intensity  @xcite .",
    "the latter is weak for @xmath48 , when @xmath49 , and strong for @xmath50 , when the baseline fitness becomes negligible . as @xmath51 $ ] and @xmath52 are absorbing , the boundary conditions to eq .",
    "( [ master ] ) are @xmath53 .",
    "our wkb - based approach is presented in the framework of acg ( _ e.g. _ snowdrift and hawk - dove games  @xcite ) , where the absorbing states @xmath22 or @xmath26 ( all @xmath54 ) , and @xmath23 or @xmath27 ( all @xmath55 ) are separated by the interior attractor @xmath25 [ in the language of the rate equation  ( [ rd ] ) ] . however , in the presence of noise @xmath25 becomes _ metastable _ , which is very naturally accounted by our theory . for @xmath56 , after a short relaxation time @xmath57 , the system settles into a long - lived metastable state whose population size distribution is peaked in the vicinity of @xmath58  @xcite .",
    "this implies that fixation of either species occurs only in the aftermath of a long - lasting coexistence . at @xmath59 , only the first excited eigenvector of ( [ master ] ) , @xmath60 , called the quasi - stationary distribution ( qsd ) ,",
    "has not decayed and hence determines the shape of the metastable pdf .",
    "indeed , at @xmath59 the higher eigenmodes in the spectral expansion of @xmath28 have already decayed , and the metastable dynamics of the population sizes pdf satisfies  @xcite @xmath61,\\ ] ] where @xmath62 .",

    "the fixation probability and mft are determined by the fluxes into the absorbing states .",
    "therefore , using eqs .",

    "according to eq .",
