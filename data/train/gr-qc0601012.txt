    "the phenomenon of the accelerated expansion of the universe is presently one of the central issues of both observational and theoretical cosmology .",
    "a number of diverse cosmological observations@xcite have by now established the accelerated nature of the present expansion of the universe and even provided additional information on the deceleration / acceleration transition and the redshift dependence of the expansion of the universe . from the theoretical side , the sole fact that the universe is presently accelerating , and may continue to do so , has triggered many studies .",
    "some particularly interesting possibilities include braneworld models of the late - time cosmic acceleration @xcite .",
    "the real theoretical challenge , however , lies in understanding the dynamics leading to the accelerated expansion of the universe . despite the fact that many promising models have been proposed , the fundamental nature of the accelerating mechanism remains presently unknown .",
    "the attempts towards shedding some light on the cause of the acceleration of the universe employ a broad range of concepts in many theoretical frameworks .",
    "the most widely used and the conceptually simplest option assumes the existence of _ dark energy _ ( de ) , the cosmic component with the negative pressure .",
    "dark energy is a very useful concept since it encodes all our ignorance on the acceleration of the universe in a single cosmic component .",
    "furthermore , de can also be used as an effective description of other mechanisms of the acceleration of the universe@xcite . a traditional candidate for",
    "the role of de is the cosmological constant ( cc ) , @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , the cosmological frw model with cold dark matter and @xmath0 as the de component ( the so - called @xmath0cdm cosmology ) fits the data reasonably well@xcite . theoretically , however , the cc as a de candidate faces a formidable problem related to the very many ( @xmath1 at least ) orders of magnitude difference of its predicted value in quantum field theory ( qft ) and the observed value@xcite .",
    "this huge discrepancy leads indeed to the cosmological challenge of the millennium and calls for a more profound treatment of the cc problem@xcite .",
    "the many inconsistencies related to the `` @xmath0 conundrum '' have led to the development of the dynamical de models .",
    "the tacit assumption of all these models is that @xmath0 does not contribute to the de or that it vanishes , which merely circumvents the cc problem .",
    "the dynamical de models , however , incorporate the advantage that they approach the modeling of the mysterious dark energy component in a more general way , allowing its properties to vary with the expansion . notwithstanding this welcome feature , the necessity of a ( severe ) fine - tuning of the parameters of these models in order that the measured value of the de coincides with the predicted value does persist and it is in no way less worrisome than in the cc case .",
    "the list of dynamical de models comprise , among others , _ quintessence _",
    "@xcite , _ phantom energy _ @xcite,_chaplygin gas_@xcite etc@xcite .",
    "very often these models of de are realized in terms of dynamical scalar field(s ) .",
    "these fields were actually introduced on more or less phenomenological grounds to deal with the cc problem long ago @xcite . in particular , in the popular quintessence approach the scalar fields and their parameters / scales are totally unrelated to the known particle physics fields , and as a consequence an obvious connection to fundamental physics is lacking .",
    "not only so , in all these models the scalar field potentials just concocted to describe an acceptable form of de are non - renormalizable by power counting and , what is worse , they are essentially field - theoretically unmotivated .    in this paper",
    "we take the point of view that these de models are not more fundamental than the original @xmath0 model .",
    "however , we exploit the most useful property of the former , namely the dynamical character of the de .",
    "therefore , we generalize the cc concept allowing the variability of the @xmath0 term ( and possibly also of the gravitational coupling @xmath2 ) with the cosmic time , both assumptions being perfectly compatible with the cosmological principle and can be realized , as we shall see , in a fully covariant way .",
    "the support for such a generalization of the @xmath0 term comes from qft on curved space - time @xcite and/or quantum gravity approaches @xcite . here , however , we do not derive the variability of @xmath0 and @xmath2 from these models , but discuss the general implications of this variability .",
    "our conclusions will therefore be valid for any specific model of the mentioned type .",
    "let us emphasize that this approach embodies many virtues : i ) the problem of the cc is dealt with instead of circumventing it ; ii ) the variability of @xmath0 may shed some light on the observed value of @xmath0 ; iii ) a variable @xmath0 is indeed a type of dynamical de , and will be handled here in the language of the effective de picture .",
    "we will show in a precise way how a cosmology with variable parameters @xmath3 can mimic a dynamical de model and produce a non - trivial _ effective _ equation of state ( eos ) , @xmath4 , beyond the naively expected one for the @xmath0 term ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "since the eos parametrization is widely used in all planned experiments aiming at a precise study of the de@xcite , such correspondence can be useful and it may even unveil some unexpected limitations of the eos method for characterizing the ultimate nature of the de .",
    "before presenting the general procedure for obtaining the effective dark energy eos corresponding to a generic variable @xmath0 and @xmath2 model , we briefly discuss the frameworks of two approaches which we call for short the _ de picture _ and the _ variable cc picture_. the _ de picture _ assumes the existence of two separately conserved cosmological energy density components , the matter - radiation component and the de component . in this picture",
    "the einstein field equations @xmath6 have a total energy - momentum tensor of the form @xmath7 .",
    "the standard energy - momentum tensors of matter - radiation @xmath8 and the one for dark energy @xmath9 are conserved separately . in the framework of frw metric",
    ", the conservation of the energy - momentum tensor for matter - radiation , @xmath10 , leads to the standard conservation law @xmath11 here @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 for nonrelativistic matter and radiation , respectively . in the standard _ de picture _",
    "the assumption that @xmath15 results in the additional conservation law for the de : @xmath16 generally the parameter @xmath17 is redshift dependent , @xmath18 .",
    "the hubble parameter in this picture is defined by the friedmann equation ( assuming zero spatial curvature ) @xmath19 where a subscript @xmath20 has been appended to @xmath21 to distinguish the expression ( [ depicture ] ) from its counterpart in the variable cc picture  see ( [ ccpicture ] ) below .",
    "the solution of the conservation laws ( [ eq : conservnr ] ) and ( [ eq : conservde ] ) results in the following scaling laws for the components of the model : @xmath22 and @xmath23 using the expressions ( [ eq : rhos ] ) and ( [ zeta ] ) , the friedmann equation acquires the form @xmath24\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] on the other hand we have the _ variable cc picture _ , which describes the kind of models studied in this paper .",
    "any of these models incorporates the matter - radiation component , a variable @xmath0 component and , possibly although not necessarily , a variable gravitational coupling @xmath2 . the variable @xmath0 model represents a modification of einstein equations of general relativity which maintains its geometrical interpretation .",
    "the dynamical equations for gravity are given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 stands for the energy - momentum tensor of matter .",
    "this equation demonstrates that the full covariance is maintained even if @xmath0 and @xmath2 acquire space - time variability . here",
    "@xmath27 is the energy density associated to @xmath0 . in the framework of the frw metric , @xmath27 and @xmath2 depend on the cosmic time only , in accordance with the cosmological principle .",
    "friedmann s equation is straightforwardly obtained from ( [ eq : einvarlam ] ) and reads @xmath28 the general bianchi identity of the einstein tensor leads to the covariant conservation law @xmath29=0 \\ , , \\ ] ] which for frw metric acquires the form @xmath30 + 3\\,g\\,h_{\\lambda}\\,(\\rho+p)=0\\,.\\ ] ] this  mixed \" conservation law connects the variation of @xmath27 , @xmath2 and @xmath31 , where the scaling of the matter - radiation density @xmath31 may be non - canonical in this picture ( in contrast to @xmath32 in the de picture ) . in this paper",
    "we consider a very broad class of models , just assuming the variability of the aforementioned quantities , without specifying the fundamental origin of such a variation .",
    "a number of variable cc models of various kinds @xcite , and the renormalization group ( rg ) models of running @xmath27 and @xmath2 @xcite provide the basis for the variability of these cosmological parameters .",
    "for example , the rg models @xcite do not determine the time dependence of @xmath27 and @xmath2 directly , but indirectly specifying them in terms of other cosmic dynamic quantities ( matter density @xmath31 , hubble parameter @xmath21 , etc ) : @xmath33 these functions usually have a monotonic dependence when expressed as functions of cosmic time or redshift .",
    "the relations ( [ variableccg ] ) , with the general conservation law ( [ bianchigeneral ] ) , lead to the complete solution of the variable cc cosmological model . using this solution the general expression for the hubble parameter becomes @xmath34\\,.\\ ] ] here @xmath35 and @xmath36 are known functions of redshift which may also depend on parameters @xmath37 originating from the fundamental dynamics .",
    "they generally have a nontrivial dependence on @xmath38 and only in the case of @xmath0cdm cosmology they satisfy @xmath39 .",
    "furthermore , they also fulfill the conditions @xmath40 and @xmath41 in accordance with the cosmic sum rule @xmath42 .",
    "notice that in general the two sets of cosmological parameters in the two pictures ( [ hlambda ] ) and ( [ hzss ] ) will be different , e.g. @xmath43 , because they correspond to two different fits of the same data .",
    "the two pictures presented in the preceding section may be considered as two separate , general de models . in the remainder of the paper we , however , assume that they are equivalent descriptions of the same cosmological evolution . more precisely , we study the effective de dynamics associated to the variable cc model through the procedure named the matching of pictures .",
    "the matching of pictures requires that the expansion history of the universe is the same in both pictures , i.e. that their hubble functions are equal , @xmath44 at all times . in this way , for a known dynamics of the variable cc model , an effective de can be constructed .",
    "a number of general results for the behavior of the effective de density can be obtained with interesting implications to the observational data .",
    "the aforementioned matching of the two pictures gives the following equality connecting the dynamical cosmological quantities in both pictures , @xmath45 .",
    "using @xmath46 , the general bianchi identity ( [ bianchigeneral ] ) can be cast in the form @xmath47 where we have introduced @xmath48 next we use the scaling law ( [ eq : conservnr ] ) for @xmath49 and we arrive at the compact form for the redshift evolution of the effective de density in the variable cc picture : @xmath50 the integration of ( [ drdz ] ) readily yields a closed form expression for the effective de density @xmath51\\,.\\ ] ] expanding @xmath52 around @xmath53 one can see that @xmath54 at sufficiently late time ( i.e. when @xmath55 ) . finally , the effective eos parameter for the variable cc model easily follows from ( [ zeta ] ) and ( [ drdz ] ) @xmath56 and it is seen to depend on the structure of the quantities ( [ xil ] ) and ( [ if ] ) . from this expression",
    "we immediately see that in this kind of models @xmath17 can cross the @xmath57 line as soon as @xmath58 equals @xmath59 .",
    "this observation reinforces the role of the effective de density @xmath59 in the study of the cc boundary crossing in the dark energy picture boundary crossing see e.g. @xcite . ] .",
    "for the following considerations it will be convenient to recast the solution of the ode ( [ drdz ] ) in a different way .",
    "let @xmath60 be the redshift value at which @xmath61 , i.e. @xmath62 . then it is easy to show that ( [ drdz ] ) is solved by the density function @xmath63 quite remarkably , one can prove that a value @xmath64 _ always _ exists near our present time ; namely in the recent past , in the immediate future or just at @xmath65 .",
    "the proof of this assertion is obtained by straightforward calculation using : i ) the matching condition @xmath66 and ii ) the differential constraint that the general bianchi identity ( [ bianchigeneral ] ) imposes on the functions @xmath36 and @xmath35 in ( [ hlambda ] ) . in this way one obtains the following relation @xmath67 from this",
    "the proof is obvious .",
    "indeed , we have already mentioned that at the present epoch function @xmath68 satisfies the condition @xmath69 .",
    "moreover , the parameter difference @xmath70 should not be large because the two pictures ( de and cc ) describe the same physics .",
    "hence from the continuity of @xmath68 it is clear that there must be a point @xmath64 close to 0 where ( [ dzeta ] ) vanishes , that is to say a point that satisfies @xmath62 .",
    "the advantage of the formulation ( [ if2 ] ) becomes evident when one calculates the slope of the @xmath59 function : @xmath71 this compact expression reveals some counterintuitive and general aspects of the effective de density evolution for variable cc models in which @xmath52 is a monotonous function of @xmath38 .",
    "intuitively one would expect that for @xmath52 growing / decreasing with @xmath38 ( decreasing / growing with expansion ) @xmath59 should be quintessence - like / phantom - like . the expression ( [ dif2 ] ) shows that this is not the case .",
    "namely , for @xmath52 growing with @xmath38 , @xmath59 decreases with @xmath38 for @xmath72 , i.e. in this redshift interval has the phantom - like characteristics . only for",
    "@xmath73 @xmath59 behaves as quintessence .",
    "analogously , for @xmath52 decreasing with @xmath38 , @xmath59 behaves like quintessence for @xmath72 , whereas only for @xmath73 it becomes phantom - like .",
    "interestingly enough , if @xmath64 lies near our recent past ( see fig.[plot]a ) , the last case could just reflect the experimental indications of de phantom - like behavior suggested by recent analyses of the data@xcite .",
    "a concrete framework describing this last possibility is outlined in section [ rgmodel ] .",
    "these results illustrate that in variable cc models , the behavior of effective de density is generally not determined by the cc only , but by the joint behavior of all quantities entering the general bianchi identity ( [ bianchigeneral ] ) .",
    "especially interesting results are obtained when in the variable cc models the matter component @xmath31 is separately conserved , i.e. when it also satisfies ( [ eq : conservnr ] ) . in this case ( [ bianchigeneral ] ) implies @xmath74 , which from ( [ dif2 ] ) results in @xmath75\\,.\\ ] ] thus in this case the properties of @xmath59 depend only on the scaling of @xmath2 with redshift , e.g. if @xmath2 is asymptotically free and @xmath76 , then @xmath77 behaves effectively as quintessence ( @xmath78 ) , whereas if @xmath2 is infrared - free then @xmath77 behaves phantom - like ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "as a concrete illustration of the general procedure we have developed for obtaining the effective de properties , in this section we consider the analysis @xcite of the renormalization group cosmological model of @xcite characterized by @xmath80 and the scaling law @xmath81 for the cc . here",
    "@xmath82 and @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the single free parameter of the model a typical value is @xmath85@xcite .",
    "this model is fully analytically tractable and relatively simple expressions for @xmath17 can be obtained . in this particular case",
    "it is clear that ( [ xil ] ) reads @xmath86 .",
    "therefore , for the flat universe case the effective parameter of eos obtained from ( [ if ] ) and ( [ we2 ] ) is @xmath87-(1-\\nu)\\,[\\tilde{\\omega}_m^0\\,(1+z)^3 - 1]}\\,.\\ ] ] for @xmath88 we may expand the previous result in first order in @xmath84 .",
    "assuming @xmath89 we find @xmath90 this result reflects the essential qualitative features of the general analysis presented in the previous sections .",
    "for @xmath91 , eq.([expwq ] ) clearly shows that we can get an ( effective ) phantom - like behavior ( @xmath92 ) and for @xmath93 we have ( effective ) quintessence behavior .",
    "we see that this variable cc model can give rise to two types of very different behaviors by just changing the sign of a single parameter . however",
    ", one can play with more parameters if desired . indeed , as we have seen the cosmological parameters in the two pictures ( de versus cc picture ) will generally be different ( @xmath94 ) .",
    "fig.[plot ] shows in a patent manner that in this case , even for @xmath93 , the variable cc model may exhibit phantom behavior due to the existence of a transition point @xmath60 in our recent past .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "we have shown that a model with variable @xmath0 ( and possibly of @xmath2 ) generally leads to a non - trivial effective eos , thus mimicking a canonical dynamical de model ( i.e. one with conserved de density ) . that eos can effectively appear as quintessence and even as phantom energy . moreover , we have proven that there _ always _ exists a transition point @xmath60 near @xmath95 where @xmath96 . if this point lies in our recent past ( as illustrated in fig.[plot]a ) there could have been a recent transition into an ( effective ) phantom regime @xmath97 , as suggested by several analysis of the data . if , however , experiments would unambiguously indicate @xmath98 we could equally well interpret this in our framework , for @xmath60 could just be in our immediate future .",
    "we conclude that variable @xmath99 models may account for the observed evolution of the de , without need of invoking any combination of fundamental quintessence and phantom fields . the eventual determination of an empirical eos for the de in the next generation of precision cosmology experiments should keep in mind this possibility .    _",
