    "low - dimensional quantum magnets are at the heart of current interest in strongly correlated electron systems .",
    "these systems are driven by strong correlations and large quantum fluctuations - especially when frustration comes into play - and can exhibit various unconventional phases and quantum phase transitions . similarly",
    ", doping these compounds leads to a rich variety of phases , like superconductivity for instance .",
    "one of the major difficulties in trying to understand these systems is that strong correlations often generate highly non trivial low - energy physics .",
    "not only the groundstate of such models is generally not known but also the low - energy degrees of freedom can not be identified easily . moreover , among the techniques available to investigate these systems , not many have the required level of generality to provide a systematic way to derive low - energy effective hamiltonians .    recently the contractor renormalization ( core ) method has been introduced by morningstar and weinstein  @xcite . the key idea of the approach is to derive an effective hamiltonian acting on a truncated local basis set , in order to exactly reproduce the low energy spectrum . in principle the method is exact in the low energy subspace , but only at the expense of having _ a priori _ long - range interactions .",
    "the method becomes most useful when one can significantly truncate a local basis set and still restrict oneself to short - range effective interactions .",
    "this however depends on the system under consideration and has to be checked systematically . since its inception",
    "the core method has been mostly used as an analytical method to study strongly correlated systems @xcite . some first steps in using the core approach and related ideas in a numerical framework",
    "have also been undertaken @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to explore the numerical core method as a complementary approach to more analytical core procedures ( see the contribution by a.  auerbach in this volume ) , and to discuss its performance in a variety of strongly correlated systems , both frustrated and unfrustrated .",
    "the approach consists basically of numerical exact diagonalizations of the effective hamiltonians .",
    "furthermore we discuss some criteria and tools useful to estimate the quality of the core approach .",
    "more technical details can be found in related work done in collaboration with d.  poilblanc  @xcite and with a. luchli and m. mambrini  @xcite .    after reviewing the core algorithm , we will present numerical applications to one - dimensional ( 1d ) systems .",
    "we will show that the numerical core method is able to get rather accurate estimates of physical properties by successively increasing the range of the effective interactions .",
    "then , we discuss two - dimensional ( 2d ) magnetic systems . as in 2d",
    "a long ranged cluster expansion of the interactions is difficult to achieve on small clusters , we will discuss some techniques to analyze the quality of the basis truncation .",
    "we illustrate these issues on two model systems , the plaquette lattice and the lattice .",
    "the plaquette lattice is of particular interest as it exhibits a quantum phase transition from a disordered plaquette state to a long range ordered nel antiferromagnet , which can not be reached by a perturbative approach .",
    "we show that a range - two effective model captures many aspects of the physics over the whole range of parameters .",
    "the lattice on the other hand is a highly frustrated lattice built of corner - sharing triangles and it is one best - known candidate systems for a spin liquid groundstate .",
    "a very peculiar property is the exponentially large number of low - energy singlets in the magnetic gap .",
    "we show that already a basic range two core approach is able to devise an effective model which exhibits the same exotic low - energy physics .",
    "in various fields , the high - energy description can be well captured by a well - known model , such as the hubbard or t - j models in the context of high temperature superconductors .",
    "however , one is interested in low - energy properties , or similarly long - distance behaviour , which are difficult to compute numerically due to system size limitations .",
    "the spirit of wilson s real - space renormalization group  @xcite is that one can integrate out local degrees of freedom ( i.e. high - energy ) in order to define new emerging degrees of freedom and derive an effective model which will be valid on larger distances .",
    "the definition of relevant degrees of freedom at a given energy scale is a very deep concept in the sense that one can forget many irrelevant details and derive an effective theory .",
    "for instance , chemists know very well that an atom or a molecule are very powerful concepts , even though they do not exist as fundamental particles .",
    "now , the question is how do we identify the relevant `` atoms '' and how do we compute an effective theory ?",
    "the answer is provided by the core algorithm .",
    "the core method has been proposed by morningstar and weinstein in the context of general hamiltonian lattice models  @xcite .",
    "later weinstein applied this method with success to various spin chain models  @xcite . for a review of the method we refer the reader to these original papers and also to a pedagogical article by altman and auerbach  @xcite",
    "( see also the contribution in this volume by a.  auerbach ) . here",
    ", we summarize the basic steps before discussing some technical aspects which are relevant in our numerical approach .    _ core algorithm  : _",
    "* choose a small cluster ( e.g. rung , plaquette , triangle , etc ) and diagonalize it .",
    "keep @xmath2 suitably chosen low - energy states . *",
    "diagonalize the full hamiltonian @xmath3 on a connected graph consisting of @xmath4 clusters and obtain its low - energy states @xmath5 with energies @xmath6 . *",
    "the eigenstates @xmath5 are projected on the tensor product space of the states kept and gram - schmidt orthonormalized in order to get a basis @xmath7 of dimension @xmath8 . as it may happen that some of the eigenstates have zero or very small projection , or vanish after the orthogonalization it might be necessary to explicitely compute more than just the lowest @xmath8 eigenstates @xmath5 . * next , the effective hamiltonian for this graph is built as  : @xmath9 * the connected range-@xmath4 interactions @xmath10 are determined by substracting the contributions of all connected subclusters .",
    "* finally , the effective hamiltonian is given by a cluster expansion as @xmath11    this effective hamiltonian _ exactly _ reproduces the low - energy physics provided the expansion goes to infinity .",
    "however , if the interactions are short - range in the starting hamiltonian , we can expect that these operators will become smaller and smaller , at least in certain situations . in the following",
    ", we will truncate at range @xmath12 and verify the convergence in several cases .",
    "this convergence naturally depends on the number @xmath2 of low - lying states that are kept on a basic block . by using the reduced density matrix",
    ", we will show a way to determine how `` good '' these states are .",
    "once an effective hamiltonian has been obtained , it is still a formidable task to determine its properties . within the core method different routes",
    "have been taken in the past . in their pioneering papers , morningstar and weinstein",
    "have chosen to iteratively apply the core method in order to flow to a fixed point that can be analyzed .",
    "a different approach has been taken in refs .",
    "[ ]  : there the effective hamiltonian after one or two iterations has been analyzed with mean - field like methods and interesting results have been obtained .",
    "yet another approach - and the one we will pursue in this paper - consists of a single core step to obtain the effective hamiltonian , followed by a numerical simulation thereof .",
    "this approach has been explored in a few previous studies @xcite .",
    "the numerical technique we employ is the exact diagonalization ( ed ) method based on the lanczos algorithm .",
    "this technique has easily access to many observables and profits from the symmetries and conservation laws in the problem , i.e. total momentum and the total @xmath13 component .",
    "in this section , we describe results obtained on @xmath0 spin chain and ladder systems with 2 and 4 legs respectively .",
    "[ fig : lattices1d ] ]    in the case of doped systems , we use the isotropic t - j model  : @xmath14 that reduces to the usual heisenberg hamiltonian in the undoped case , @xmath15 where the exchange constants @xmath16 will be limited to nearest neighbours .",
    "we have chosen periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) along the chains in order to improve the convergence to the thermodynamic limit .      in this simple example , one is able to iterate the core procedure in order to obtain the ground - state energy .",
    "let us recall that this model has an exact solution for the ground - state energy @xmath17 and has an infinite correlation length so that a numerical approach on a finite system is not obvious .",
    "using core and solving up to 12 sites , which is very easy even on a small computer , weinstein has obtained  @xcite a ground - state energy with a relative accuracy of @xmath18 .    a similar idea consists of increasing the size of the initial block , instead of the range of effective interactions , and this has been applied by malrieu _",
    "_ to the same system  @xcite .",
    "solving numerically up to 22 sites , they have a relative error of @xmath19 .",
    "being able to obtain such an accuracy on a ground - state energy by solving small systems compared to the infinite correlation length is very encouraging .",
    "therefore , we have pursued this approach more systematically on other models .",
    "the 2-leg heisenberg ladder has been intensively studied and is known to exhibit a spin gap for all couplings  @xcite .    in order to apply our algorithm",
    ", we select a @xmath20 plaquette as the basic unit ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : lattices1d ] ) .",
    "the truncated subspace is formed by the singlet ground - state ( gs ) and the lowest triplet state . using the same core approach , piekarewicz and shepard",
    "have shown that quantitative results can be obtained within this restricted subspace  @xcite .    ) and spin gap ( @xmath21 ) of a @xmath22 heisenberg ladder using core method with various range @xmath12 using pbc .",
    "for comparison , we plot the best known extrapolations   with arrows .",
    "[ fig : heisen_2xl ] ]    since we are dealing with a simple system , we can compute the effective models including rather long - range interactions .",
    "it is desirable to compute long - range effective interactions since we wish to check how the truncation affect the physical results and how the convergence is reached .    in a second step ,",
    "for each of these effective models , we perform a standard exact diagonalization ( ed ) using the lanczos algorithm on finite clusters up to @xmath23 clusters ( @xmath24 sites for the original model ) .",
    "the gs energy and the spin gap are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : heisen_2xl ] .",
    "the use of pbc allows to considerably reduce finite - size effects since we have an exponential convergence as a function of inverse length .",
    "core results are in perfect agreement with known results and the successive approximations converge uniformly to the exact results . for instance , the relative errors of range-4 results are @xmath19 for the gs energy and @xmath25 for the spin gap .",
    "this fast convergence is probably due to the rather short correlation length in an isotropic ladder ( typically 3 to 4 lattice spacings  @xcite ) .      in order to apply core ,",
    "we choose again a @xmath20 plaquette as the basic block .",
    "in addition to the magnetic states , we decide to keep the lowest 2-hole state .",
    "therefore , the effective degrees of freedom are hard - core bosons ( triplets and hole pairs ) . a similar approach has been used to study the 2-dimensional case  @xcite .    in ref .",
    "[ ] , we have shown that this effective bosonic model reproduces many features of the doped 2-leg ladder such as the persistence of the spin gap , the existence of a triplet - hole pair bound state , as well as the characteristic exponent of the superconducting correlations .",
    "a similar model had been proposed previously  @xcite , but the parameters were obtained from dmrg data obtained on large systems .",
    "here , we can deduce the effective parameters by using core method , i.e. by solving small clusters .    following a similar approach ,",
    "we have also studied the 4-leg t - j ladder  @xcite .",
    "qualitatively , the physics is very similar to the 2-leg case , albeit with smaller energy scales . in fig .",
    "[ hole12 ] , we draw density - density correlations obtained with the bosonic effective model for various dopings . upon increasing doping , we observe a clear tendency of the hole pairs to align along the diagonal @xmath26 directions ( for doping larger than 1/8 ) with a periodicity corresponding to one pair every two plaquettes , a behavior also reported in dmrg calculations@xcite and reminiscent of the picture of diagonal stripes . in our case , pbc were used in the leg direction so that stripes formation is intrinsic and not due to any boundary effects .",

    "correlations are measured from the reference plaquette on the lower left corner .",
    "the surfaces of the dots are proportional to the values of the correlations.[hole12 ] ]    therefore , with core method , we have both the advantage of working in a reduced subspace and not being limited to the perturbative regime . amazingly , we have observed that for a very small effort ( solving a small cluster ) , the effective hamiltonian gives much better results than perturbation theory .",
    "it also gives an easier framework to systematically improve the accuracy by including longer range interactions .",
    "for these models , the good convergence of core results may be due to the fact that the gs in the isotropic limit is adiabatically connected to the perturbative one . in the following part we will therefore study 2d models where a quantum phase transition occurs as one goes from the perturbative to the isotropic regime .",
    "in this section we would like to discuss the application of the numerical core method to two dimensional quantum spin systems .",
    "we will present spectra and observables and also discuss a novel diagnostic tool - the density matrix of local objects - in order to justify the truncation of the local state set .",
    "one major problem in two dimension is the more elaborate cluster expansion appearing in the core procedure .",
    "we therefore try to keep the range of the interactions minimal , but we still demand a reasonable description of low energy properties of the system .",
