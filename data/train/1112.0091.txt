    "cp asymmetry measurements in nonleptonic @xmath0 decays have been receiving considerable attention over the past several years since the recent experimental measurements in some decay channels are in disagreement with naive estimates of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "one of the important examples is the direct cp asymmetries in @xmath1 decays @xcite .",
    "current world averages of the cp asymmetries in @xmath1 decays are given by @xcite : [ acp_exp ] a_cp(b^0 k^^ ) & = & -0.086 0.007 , a_cp(b^k^^0 ) & = & 0.040 0.021 , a_cp(b^k^0 ^ ) & = & -0.015 0.012 .",
    "however , the naive factorization assumption predicts @xmath4 @xcite , which is inconsistent with the current data in eq .",
    "( [ acp_exp ] ) .",
    "this discrepancy can be explained by enhancing the smaller diagrams such as @xmath5 and @xmath6 with a sizable strong phase through the sm fit to the @xmath7 data @xcite , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 stand for the color - suppressed tree and electroweak penguin amplitudes , respectively , in the topological decomposition @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , such enhancement of subdominant diagrams in the sm is not fully understood theoretically and also may not be sufficient to resolve other puzzles simultaneously in the @xmath8 meson system @xcite . alternatively to the sm fit , since the prediction given in ref .",
    "@xcite did not incorporate all possible hadronic uncertainties , these decay modes have been also studied within the sm in the framework of different factorization approaches such as qcd factorization @xcite , perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) @xcite , and soft - collinear effective theory @xcite . even under such factorization assumptions , however , the above data have not been fully explained as well . in the sm",
    ", the sizes and patterns of cp violation in various decay modes are governed by a single complex phase which resides in the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix , but such large cp violation effects have not been simply explained with this single parameter in any of those factorization methods in various decay modes simultaneously .",
    "therefore , there has been several efforts to understand such large cp asymmetries beyond the sm with additional cp odd parameters @xcite .",
    "similarly in this paper , we study the new physics ( np ) contributions to the direct cp asymmetries in @xmath1 decays as well as to ( semi-)leptonic @xmath8 decays and @xmath8 mixing where np effects could be sizable . in order to minimize hadronic uncertainties",
    ", we consider all relevant tree and penguin contributions even including annihilation types by adopting pqcd approach , and estimate the possible np contributions .",
    "one of the simplest extensions of the sm corresponding to such a scenario with additional cp phases is the nonmanifest ( @xmath9 ) left - right model ( lrm ) with gauge group @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the left(right)-handed quark mixing matrix @xcite . since the lrm has the extended group @xmath12 , there are new parameters such as a right - handed gauge coupling @xmath13 , new charged ( neutral ) gauge bosons @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) , and the @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) mixing angle @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "after spontaneous symmetry breaking , the gauge eigenstates @xmath14 mix with @xmath20 to form the mass eigenstates @xmath21 and @xmath22 with masses @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "similarly , the neutral gauge bosons mix each other @xcite , but we do not present them here because @xmath15 contribution to flavor - changing b decays is negligible .",
    "although tree - level flavor - changing neutral higgs bosons with masses @xmath25 enter into our theory due to gauge invariance , we also neglect their contributions by assuming @xmath26 @xcite . the mixing angle @xmath18 and the ratio @xmath27 of @xmath28 to @xmath29 are restricted by a number of low - energy phenomenological constraints @xcite .",
    "one of the most stringent bounds on @xmath30 was obtained from @xmath31 mixing . if the model has manifest ( @xmath32 ) left - right symmetry ( @xmath33 ) where @xmath11 is the left(right)-handed quark mixing matrix , @xmath34 tev @xcite .",
    "similar bounds were obtained recently by cms and atlas from direct searches for the decay channels of the extra gauge bosons @xmath35 under various assumptions on the right - handed neutrino masses and gauge couplings @xcite .",
    "however , the form of @xmath36 is not necessarily restricted to manifest or pseudomanifest ( @xmath37 ) symmetric - type , where @xmath38 is a diagonal phase matrix @xcite .",
    "if @xmath36 takes one of the following forms , the @xmath14 mass limit can be significantly lowered @xcite , and @xmath39 can be as large as @xmath40 ( for @xmath41 gev ) @xcite : [ vr3 ] (    ccc 1 & 0 & 0 + 0 & 0 & 1 + 0 & 1 & 0    ) , (    ccc 0 & 1 & 0 + 1 & 0 & 0 + 0 & 0 & 1    ) , (    ccc 0 & 1 & 0 + 0 & 0 & 1 + 1 & 0 & 0    ) .    as well as the cp - violating observables in @xmath1 decays , we also accommodate a large cp - violating phase in @xmath42 mixing observed at tevatron and a disagreement emerged between the determination of @xmath2 from inclusive and exclusive b decays @xcite . in order to incorporate all of those considerations , we take the following form of @xmath36 as similarly done in ref .",

    "the matrix elements indicated as @xmath45 may be @xmath46 and unitarity requires @xmath47 .",
    "especially , with this form , the present experimental measurement of the large branching fractions for @xmath48 decays can be explained @xcite , but the right - handed current effect in @xmath49 mixing is negligible so we only consider direct cp asymmetries in @xmath1 decays .",

    "could be seen in various decay modes , and the bound of its mass could be obtained independent of the form of @xmath36 .",
