    "a _ dominating set _ @xmath2 of a graph @xmath3 is a set such that each vertex @xmath4 is either in the set or adjacent to a vertex in the set .",
    "the _ domination number _ of @xmath3 , denoted @xmath5 , is defined as the minimum cardinality of a dominating set of @xmath3 . in 1996 ,",
    "matheson and tarjan @xcite considered this asymptotically for _ plane triangulations _ ( or _ triangulations _ , for short ) , motivated by studying unstructured multigrid computations in two dimensions .",
    "they proved that any triangulated disc @xmath3 with @xmath0 vertices has @xmath6 .",
    "they defined an infinite class of outerplane graphs which achieve this bound , proving the bound is sharp ( even for outerplane graphs ) .",
    "however , they conjectured that one can do better if the disc is bounded by a triangle , that is , for a triangulation .",
    "@xcite[conj ] for @xmath0 sufficiently large , the domination number of any @xmath0-vertex triangulation is at most @xmath1 .",
    "as they note , the octahedron , which is a triangulation , contains six vertices and can not be dominated with less than two vertices ; hence @xmath7 is necessary .",
    "they also defined an infinite class of triangulations that need @xmath1 vertices to be dominated , and thus we know we can not do better .",
    "these graphs are constructed from any number of @xmath8s drawn in the plane , with edges added to the outer face to create a triangulation .",
    "domination is very widely studied ( see  @xcite for a recent monograph ) , and upper bounds have been found for various graph classes related to triangulations .",
    "for example , every triangulation other than @xmath9 has minimum degree @xmath10 , @xmath11 , or @xmath12 , and graph classes achieving these three minimum degree values have been studied .",
    "reed  @xcite proved that every @xmath0-vertex graph of minimum degree @xmath10 has a dominating set of size at most @xmath13 .",
    "xing , sun , and chen  @xcite proved that minimum degree at least @xmath12 implies that there is a dominating set of size at most @xmath14 , and sohn and yuan  @xcite show that with minimum degree @xmath11 there must be a dominating set of size at most @xmath15 .",
    "however , none of these bounds for general graphs is as low as matheson and tarjan s bound of @xmath16 for triangulated discs . as for planar graphs other than triangulations",
    ", people have primarily investigated upper bounds for planar graphs of small diameter  @xcite and recently there has also been a lot of work from the computational point of view ( for example ,  @xcite ) .",
    "recently honjo , kawarabayashi , and nakamoto considered triangulations on other surfaces , extending matheson and tarjan s bound of @xmath16 to triangulations on the projective plane , the torus , and the klein bottle , and to locally planar triangulations ( triangulations of sufficiently high representativity ) for every other surface  @xcite .",
    "when trying to construct a small dominating set for a given graph , it is rather intuitive that vertices of relatively high degree are good candidates for being part of a dominating set . the hard part ought to be in efficiently dominating those vertices that are not adjacent to any high degree vertices . however , this approach is not helpful for graphs with small maximum degree , which includes many triangulations , for example , the triangulations in which all vertex degrees are @xmath12 or @xmath17 .",
    "( these are known as _ geodesic domes _ , or as the duals of _ fullerene graphs _ , and they are of interest  @xcite partly due to applications in chemistry . ) moreover , such graphs must be considered at some point when attacking conjecture  [ conj ] . therefore it is interesting to see what kind of approach will work on such graphs , and thus this case is our focus for this paper .",
    "our main result is the following theorem .",
    "[ t : main ] there exists @xmath18 such that for any @xmath19 , an @xmath0-vertex triangulation with maximum degree @xmath17 has a dominating set of size at most @xmath1",
    ".    note that since a triangulation with maximum degree less than @xmath17 has at most @xmath20 vertices , theorem  [ t : main ] could be restated to include triangulations with no degree greater than 6 .",

    "sections  [ s : defs ] and  [ s : proof ] are devoted to the proof of theorem  [ t : main ] .",
    "as there are a fair amount of details to work through and verify , we first give an outline of its main steps .",
    "in this sketch , statements and quantities are only approximate , and claims are mostly unjustified .",
    "let @xmath3 be an @xmath0-vertex triangulation of maximum degree 6 .",
    "let @xmath21 be the set of vertices in @xmath3 of degree less than 6 ; using euler s formula we can see that @xmath22 .",
    "we select a minimum - size tree @xmath23 in @xmath3 that contains @xmath21 ( a `` steiner tree '' ) .",
    "then , thinking of @xmath3 as being embedded on the sphere rather than the plane , we will cut the surface along the edges of @xmath23 , obtaining a triangulated disc .",
    "let @xmath24 be the plane graph obtained ; note that the edges of @xmath24 along the boundary of the disc consist of two copies of each edge of @xmath23 .",
    "now let @xmath25 be the 6-regular infinite triangulation , as suggested on the left of figure  [ f : infinite - grid ] .",
    "the triangulated disc can be embedded in @xmath25 such that vertices , edges , and 3-faces are mapped to their counterparts in @xmath25 , preserving incidences .",
    "@xmath25 has a dominating set arranged in a pattern that uses every seventh vertex .",
    "we copy this pattern of vertices to @xmath24 , then to @xmath3 , then add all the vertices of @xmath23 to get a dominating set for @xmath3 .",
    "its size is roughly @xmath26 , which is about @xmath27 .",
    "this suffices if @xmath28 is at most @xmath29 .    , with a dominating set that contains every seventh vertex ]    next",
    ", we show that when @xmath23 contains more than @xmath29 vertices of @xmath3 , it must be that the triangulation @xmath3 of the sphere mostly consists of a `` triangulated cylinder '' with length @xmath30 much larger than its width @xmath31 , as follows :    let @xmath32 . by the choice of @xmath23 , @xmath33 .",
    "there are @xmath34 paths in @xmath23 with endpoints in @xmath35 and internal vertices in @xmath36 ; let @xmath37 be a longest one .",

    "let @xmath40 be a middle vertex of @xmath37 . by the choice of @xmath23 and @xmath37 , the vertices of @xmath35 closest to @xmath40 are the endpoints of @xmath37 .",

    "( see figure  [ f : hex - grid ] . )",
    "@xmath48 contains about @xmath49 distinct vertices , so @xmath50 . since this is less than @xmath51 ( for @xmath0 sufficiently large )",
    ", @xmath47 contains no vertex of @xmath21 ; all its vertices have degree  6 in @xmath3 .",
    "then , by the choice of @xmath46 , there must be two vertices @xmath52 on different sides of the hexagon @xmath48 that are connected by a short path ( length 2 or  3 ) within @xmath47 .",
    "this yields a cycle @xmath53 in @xmath47 that contains @xmath40 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 , of length at most @xmath56 .",
    "since the distance from @xmath40 to @xmath21 is at least @xmath51 , and the distance from @xmath40 to any vertex of @xmath53 is at most @xmath57 , the distance from @xmath53 to @xmath21 is at least @xmath58 , which is at least @xmath59 ( for @xmath0 sufficiently large ) .",
    "any cycle embedded in the plane or sphere has two sides .",
    "let @xmath60 be the graph induced by vertices on one side of @xmath53 that are at distance @xmath45 from @xmath53 , and let @xmath61 be the graph induced by vertices on the other side of @xmath53 that are at distance @xmath45 from @xmath53 , for all @xmath43 .",

    ". therefore @xmath77 and @xmath78 for @xmath67 .",
    "such cycles and the edges between consecutive cycles form a triangulated cylinder of `` length '' @xmath79 and `` width '' @xmath80 .",
    "since @xmath81 and @xmath82 is at most @xmath83 , the length is much larger than the width . removing the triangulated cylinder yields two components .",
    "using the fact that @xmath21 intersects @xmath63 and @xmath84 , we show that each component has at most @xmath85 vertices , which together is at most @xmath86 vertices .",
    "to finish , we do something like cutting the triangulated cylinder lengthwise , mapping it to @xmath25 and copying the dominating pattern back to the cylinder .",
    "this produces a set of size approximately @xmath87 that dominates the cylinder .",
    "the rest of @xmath3 has at most @xmath86 vertices , which we add to the previous set , obtaining a set that dominates @xmath3 .",
    "its size is about @xmath88 , which is roughly @xmath87 since @xmath89 .",

    "this sketch overlooks one major issue . in order to discuss the structure and number of vertices on each side of a cycle ( and more ) , we need to introduce the concept of _ marginal degree _ and prove several results about it .",

    "the major addition required to prove conjecture  [ c : n/6 ] is a case analysis that , for every triangulated cylinder from lemma  [ c : cylinder2 ] with @xmath512 , more carefully chooses @xmath478 and @xmath484 above .",
