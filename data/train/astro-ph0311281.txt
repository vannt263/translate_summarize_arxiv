    "belongs to the general group of systems known as low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxb ) .",
    "these systems consist of a neutron star or a black hole orbiting around a late - type star ( later than a ) .",
    "the x rays are the result of the accretion of material from the companion onto the compact star .",
    "mass transfer is thought to occur via roche lobe overflow , and hence proceeds via an accretion disk . in , the compact star is a neutron star and the mass - donating companion is a v=21.6 k7v star , located at an estimated distance of 2.5 kpc ( chevalier et al .",
    "an orbital period of 18.95 hours has been suggested ( chevalier & ilovaisky 1991 ; welsh , robinson & young 2000 ) . the high - energy radiation is characterized by 1.52 month long transient x - ray outbursts during which the x - ray luminosity can increase by more than three orders of magnitude .",
    "they are thought to be due to thermal instabilities in the accretion disk ( e.g. van paradijs 1996 ) .",
    "their recurrence time and duration vary but typical values are @xmath2  200 days and 4060 days , respectively ( @xmath3imon 2002 ) .",
    "the source also displays type i bursts ( zhang , yu & zhang 1998 ) that last a few tens of seconds and are interpreted as runaway thermonuclear burning of matter on the surface of the neutron star .",
    "various schemes have been proposed to categorize the lmxbs : x - ray spectral behavior as a function of intensity and the requirement of a low - energy blackbody component in the x - ray spectra ( parsignault & grindlay 1978 ; naylor & podsiadlowski 1993 ) , cluster analysis of a large number of source characteristics ( ponman 1982 ) , detailed x - ray spectral fits ( white & mason 1985 ) , x - ray hardness - intensity and color - color diagrams ( schulz , hasinger & trmper 1989 ) , aperiodic variability at very low frequencies ( reig , papadakis & kylafis 2003 ) .",
    "most relevant for the purpose of this paper is the classification scheme in terms of the rapid aperiodic variability and the patterns that these sources display in color - color diagrams ( hasinger & van der klis 1989 ) . in this scheme lmxbs",
    "are divided into two different subclasses , z and atoll sources .",
    "the three spectral branches that make up the z shape are called horizontal branch , normal branch and flaring branch and the two structures that occur in atoll sources are known as the island and the banana ( van der klis 1989 ) . at the lowest count rates an extension of the island state",
    "is sometimes seen with a harder spectrum and stronger band - limited noise than the `` canonical '' island state ( van straaten , van der klis & mndez 2003 and references therein ) .",
    "the term _ extreme island state _ has been used to designate such state ( prins & van der klis 1997 ; reig et al .",
    "the spectral and timing properties of atoll sources in this state are reminiscent of those seen in the low / hard state of black hole systems ( van der klis 1994a , 1994b ; berger & van der klis 1998 ; olive et al . 1998 ; belloni , psaltis & van der klis 2002 ) . both z and atoll sources move through these patterns continuously , that is , without jumping from one branch to another , although the source motion along the spectral tracks is much slower in atoll sources when they are in the island state than in the banana state and in z sources in all states .",
    "the classification of aquila x1 in this scheme was investigated by reig et al .",
    "( 2000 )  see also cui et al .",
    "( 1998 )  , who studied the correlated x - ray timing and spectral variations of  and presented evidence for its classification as an atoll source , exhibiting all classic atoll source states .",
    "this scheme has been revisited by muno , remillard & chakrabarty ( 2002 ) and gierliski & done ( 2002 ) .",
    "they reported that three transient atoll sources which display a wide dynamic range in intensity ( @xmath4 ; 4u 160852 , 4u 170544 and  trace out three - branch patterns in the color - color diagram similar to those of z sources , and suggested this may be a general feature .",
    "their study was based on the spectral properties only . however , as pointed out by hasinger & van der klis ( 1989 ) it is difficult to make a clear distinction between z and atoll sources on the basis of the motion through the color - color diagram alone .",
    "analysis of the rapid aperiodic variability to study the noise components in different regions of the color - color diagram and the actual time scales of the motion of the source through the diagram are important to identify source type and state .    in this work",
    "we have studied the spectral and timing properties of  in order to investigate whether atoll and z sources can be unified into one classification scheme and provide new insights into the poorly known extreme island states of atoll sources .",
    "we find that although the color - color diagram shows a branch whose topology is similar to the normal branch of z sources , neither the timing properties nor the motion in the color - color diagram of   agree with those of z sources .",
    "the data were retrieved from the _ rxte _ archive and comprise all observations of  available from 1997 february to 2002 may . data taken during satellite slews and earth occultation",
    "were removed .",
    "likewise , all type i bursts were excluded from our analysis .",
    "the observations contain five x - ray outbursts .",
    "although the duration and maximum intensity differ , the profile of the outbursts is very similar and is characterized by a fast rise and a slower decay . during intensity maximum",
    "the light curve is complex and multi - peaked .",
    "the fourth outburst showed two minor outbursts ( the peak intensity was one order of magnitude lower than the main outburst ) 70 days and 110 days after the main peak , respectively .",

    "background subtracted light curves corresponding to the energy ranges 2.03.5 kev , 3.56.0 kev , 6.09.7 kev and 9.716.0 kev were used to define the soft and hard colors as sc=3.56.0/2.03.5 and hc=9.716.0/6.09.7 , respectively . the color - color diagram ( cd ) of",
    "was then constructed by plotting the hard color as function of the soft color ( fig .",
    "[ ccd ] ) . during the time spanned by the observations the response of the detectors varied due to ageing .",
    "in addition , gain changes are applied occasionally , making the channel boundaries for a given energy range change with time , and also slightly affecting the effective areas of the detectors .",
    "each gain change is the start of a new `` gain epoch '' .",
    "we reduced the effect of the color shifts that results from these gain changes by linearly interpolating between the count rates in the two energy channels straddling the energy boundaries in each epoch .",
    "each data point of  was normalized with the closest corresponding crab point within the same gain epoch in order to mitigate the response change effects on the colors .",
    "the final cd was obtained by averaging the five ( one for each detector ) normalized cds and rebinning into 256-s data points .",
    "we excluded data for which the resulting relative errors were larger than 5% .",
    "the total number of data points excluded from the analysis was @xmath0 10% . in order to recover the true values of the colors of  the soft color",
    "should be multiplied by 2.35 and the hard color by 0.56 ( quoted values are averages of the crab colors during the observations and for all five pcus ) .",
    "the variation of the crab colors computed as the root - mean - square , i.e. ( the standard deviation over the mean color ) was 5.3% and 1.7% for the soft and hard colors , respectively  see also fig .  1 in van straaten et al .",
    "( 2003 ) .      can be found in two main states : a low - intensity hard state and a high - intensity soft state .",
    "in addition , a short - lived intermediate or transition state is found displaying values of the hard color in between the two main states .",
    "the aperiodic variability as a function of spectral hardness , i.e. position in the cd of  was previously studied by reig et al .",
    "( 2000 ) . with only two of the five outbursts analysed in that work , the cd consisted of a soft branch , the banana branch , and two isolated groups of points which were called extreme island and island states .",
    "the large amount of data now analyzed reveals a more structured cd , in which the extreme island state appears as a more stable and longer - lived branch than the island state .",
    "the high / soft state corresponds to the classical banana state and the island state represents the transition between the two main states .",
    "outbursts 1 , 4 and 5 ( o1 , o4 and o5 ) contain points in the two main states while outbursts 2 and 3 ( o2 and o3 ) provide points to the banana state only .",
    "observations of o2 and o3 began and finished when the source was still at a relatively high level of emission ( @xmath5 c / s ) and did not experience large amplitude changes ( i@xmath6/i@xmath7 @xmath8 5 ) .",
    "in contrast , outburst 1 , 4 and 5 extended over a larger dynamic range in intensity ( i@xmath6/i@xmath7 @xmath9 50 ) .",
    "none of the points of the two minor outbursts which followed o4 ( which will be termed here as o4@xmath10 ) contributed to the banana state .",
    "outbursts 1 , 4 , 4@xmath10 and 5 include points in the extreme island state . while o4 and o5 include points both during the rise and during the decay , o1 gives points during the decay only .",
    "the island state occurred only during the decay of o1 and o5 .",
    "all five outbursts ( except for o4@xmath11 ) have points in the banana state but only o3 provides banana state points during the rise .",
    "figure [ cdmotion ] displays the motion of  in the cd for outbursts 4 and 5 .",
    "data points are @xmath21-day averages .",
    "figure  [ coltime ] shows the evolution of the colors with time for those outbursts that include spectral transitions ( o1 , o4 , o5 ) .",
    "the 216 kev intensity just before the transitions is also given .",
    "all quoted intensities in this section are background subtracted and correspond to 5 pcus in the energy range 216 kev .",
    "there is a strong correlation between the position of the source in the cd and its intensity . at the onset of the outbursts",
    "the data points distribute in the softest part of the extreme island state .",
    "the count rate is @xmath0 100 c / s . as the intensity increases the source moves toward the right along the extreme island branch .",
    "the hard color ( hc ) slightly decreases on average . in about 6 days the count rate increases by one order of magnitude and the soft color ( sc ) increases by @xmath12 + 0.3 .",
    "then the source seems to jump to the banana state , recovering the initial values of the soft color .",
    "the hard color decreases by @xmath13 .",
    "the 216 kev intensity is @xmath2 3 or 4 times that of the extreme island state prior to the spectral transition , namely 40006000 c / s .",
    "no intermediate points between the two states are observed during the rise of the outbursts .",
    "this can be attributed to the fast rise and the lack of good sampling of the data .",
    "indeed , the observational gaps between the last point of the extreme island branch and the first one of the banana branch were 2.6 and 3.1 days for o4 and o5 , respectively .    as the intensity continues to increase the source becomes harder , i.e. , it moves to the right along the banana , with approximately constant hard color .",
    "the peak of the outburst is characterized by flaring activity with erratic changes in count rate .",
    "the count rate at the peak is 50100 times the minimum detected count rate . despite this irregular behavior",
    "the correlation between the intensity and the colors is maintained in the sense that the lower intensity points in the flares display a lower soft color as it is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ flare2ccd ] . in other words , during the flare maxima the source lies at the right end of the banana branch , and in between flares it moves to the left .",
    "thus the flaring variability in the light curve translates into the cd in a back and forth motion which approximately extends over the right half part of the banana state .",
    "this motion is quite fast . as an example , in one of the flares in o5 the soft color changed by 0.08 in about 2.4 hr . in another flare by 0.06 in 0.55 hr .",
    "this flaring behavior is seen in all outbursts but o2 shows it exclusively ( fig .",
    "[ flare2ccd ] ) .",
    "such behavior stops once the source gets to half way the decay of the outburst , at which point the source shifts to lower soft colors ( to the left along the banana branch ) .",
    "as the outburst declines the source moves back along the banana branch , abandoning it when the count rate becomes lower than @xmath2 800 c / s .",
    "the transition to the hard state occurs at much lower soft color than when it entered the banana , although not necesarily at the lowest soft color .",
    "the banana state covers values of the soft color between 0.87 ( o5 ) and 1.16 ( o3 ) .",
    "the transition to the hard state takes place at sc @xmath12 0.920.93 ( fig .",
    "[ cdmotion ] ) . the count rate at which the transition between the two main states takes place is higher when the source is in the rise of the outburst . hard to soft transitions",
    "occur when the count rate is well above @xmath2 1000 c / s .",
    "soft to hard transitions when the count rate is well below @xmath2 1000 c / s as it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ coltime ] .    rather than jumping directly to the hard branch",
    "the source remains for a short time ( @xmath14 days ) in an intermediate state , the island state .",
    "note that such a short island state episode would usually have been missed due to data gaps in the rise .",
    "the count rate in the island state is @xmath2 200400 c / s . at even lower count rates the source finds itself back in the extreme island branch , moving toward the left as the intensity decreases , to eventually become too weak to measure the colors sufficiently well .",
    "the source re - enters this state during the decay when the count rate goes below @xmath15 c / s .",
    "the re - entry point occurs at a lower soft color ( sc @xmath12 1.051.10 ) then when the source left the extreme island state ( sc @xmath12 1.3 ) .",
    "as the speed of motion along the extreme island state is approximately constant , the time during which the source can be found in this state is shorter during the decay of the outburst than during its rise .",
    "a difference in the position of the source in the cd depending on whether the source intensity increases or decreases was already recognized by reig et al .",
    "( 2000 ) .",
    "the main result that should be stressed is that transitions between states do not occur at the same point of the spectral branches . during the rise of the x - ray outburst the source occupies the hardest parts of the extreme island state before the spectral transition to the banana state . during the decay it tends to occupy the softest part of the banana branch before moving into the island state .",
    "however , the points of departure and arrival are different . in the cd , this translates into some sort of rectangular track ( fig .",
    "[ cdmotion ] ) along which   moves clockwise as the count rate first increases and then decreases .",
    "in addition to fig .",
    "[ coltime ] , tables [ dur ] and [ timetran ] also illustrate the time scale for the motion through the diagram .",
    "table  [ dur ] and table  [ timetran ] give upper limits on the duration of the source in each state and the time scales of the spectral transitions , respectively .",
    "note that the observational gap for the spectral transitions from the extreme island state to the banana state is approximately two times longer than viceversa . given the speed of motion of the soft color along the extreme island branch ( roughly 0.05 day@xmath16 )",
    "a three - day gap might imply a change in soft color of about 0.15 .",
    "thus , it is possible that the actual entry point into the banana branch is at lower values of the soft color . in this case",
    "the motion of  in the cd would be similar to that of 4u 1705 - 44 ( barret & olive 2002 ) , in which both the transition from ( to ) the extreme island state to ( from ) the banana state occur at the same point of the banana branch .",
    "the motion in the cd then would then resemble an inverted triangle rather than a rectangle .",
    "in order to investigate the aperiodic variability of  we obtained power spectra by dividing the 260 kev pca data of each observation into 256-s segments and calculated the fourier power spectrum of each segment up to a nyquist frequency of 2048 hz . the high - frequency end",
    "( 15002048 hz ) of the power spectra was used to determine the underlying poisson noise ( approximated by a constant power level ) , which was subtracted before performing the spectral fitting .",
    "our aim is to investigate the aperiodic variability in correlation with the spectral states , which in turn , correlate with the source count rate .",
    "thus we divided the color - color plane into various regions and obtained a mean power spectrum for each region .",
    "the mean power spectrum was the result of averaging all the power spectra corresponding to the points enclosed in each color region .",
    "see table  [ reg ] to find the average values of the colors , boundaries and intensity of each region .",
    "prior to this , we investigated whether power spectra from the same cd region taken at different outbursts were consistent with having the same properties .",
    "we found that while this was true for the banana state , some differences existed in the extreme island state depending on whether the source was in the rise or the decay of the x - ray outburst .",
    "the extreme island state is populated with points from the rising part of o4 and o5 , the decaying part of o1 , o4 and o5 and from the extended extreme island state of o4@xmath11 .",
    "consequently , the extreme island state was first separated into points pertaining to the rise , to the decay or to o4@xmath11 .",
    "then each one of these groups was further divided into three subgroups according to the value of the soft color .",
    "note that in the case of the rise and decay regions this division implies a division in count rate as well as in hard color . on average ,",
    "the extreme island sates eisrise1 and eisdecay2 , ( see table  [ reg ] ) have lower intensity and are softer than eisrise2 and eisdecay1 , respectively . in turn",
    ", eisrise2 contains softer points than eisrise3 .",
    "the island state points ( intermediate state ) defined another region .",
    "the timing properties of the banana state in atoll sources have been seen to vary smoothly as the soft color , or equivalently , the count rate increases , that is , from the lower ( left ) to the upper ( right ) banana branch .",
    "therefore , the banana branch was split into five regions ( bs1 to bs5 ) in increasing order of the soft color .",
    "each region approximately contains the same amount of data .",
    "there is no unanimity in the literature about the names of the power spectral noise components nor about the mathematical functions used to fit those components . in this work",
    "we have followed the terminology of belloni et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and fitted the power spectra using lorentzian functions only .",
    "also , for displaying our power spectra we have used the power times frequency representation @xmath17 vs @xmath18 , in which the product of the power density in the rms normalization and the fourier frequency is plotted as a function of the fourier frequency ( belloni et al .",
    "1997 ) . as fit parameters we use the frequency @xmath19 at which the lorentzian attains its maximum value in such representation , and the @xmath20 value , which gives a measure of the coherence of the lorentzian . in terms of the half width at half maximum or @xmath21 ,",
    "these quanties are related by @xmath22 and @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the central frequency of the lorentzian .",
    "between three and five lorentzians were needed in order to get a good fit .",
    "if during the fitting procedure a lorentzian component resulted with negative @xmath20 value then we set it to zero .",
    "it should be noted that the naming scheme of belloni et al .",
    "( 2002 ) was applied , in the case of low - luminosity neutron stars , to systems displaying the island state only .",
    "thus , a complete description of some power spectra , especially those in the banana state , in terms of the noise components given in that work is not always possible and extra or new components are needed in order to obtain acceptable fits .",
    "the extensions to the belloni et al . naming scheme we use are those of van straaten et al .",
    "( 2003 ) .    in the terminology of belloni",
    "et al . ( 2002 ) , the band - limited noise of atoll sources in the ( extreme ) island state consists of three lorentzians namely , @xmath25 that accounts for the power spectrum at low frequencies ( @xmath26 hz ) , @xmath27 and @xmath28 that fit its high - frequency end .",
    "@xmath27 may show up as a broad bump at frequencies 1025 hz ( normally in the island state ) or as a narrow qpo at frequencies @xmath1 100 hz ( normally in the banana state ) .",
    "in fact , at frequencies above @xmath1 100 hz @xmath27 and @xmath28 represent the khz qpos seen in low - mass x - ray binaries .",
    "however , note that this identification of @xmath27 with both a broad peak and the lower khz qpo is only tentative and the broad bump at 10 - 25 hz might alternatively represent a separate component ( van straaten et al .",

    "one single lorentzian with peak at @xmath43 hz and q value of 0.15 accounts for the entire 0.01100 hz frequency band .",
    "this noise component is identified as @xmath25 . a second narrower lorentzian with @xmath44 hz and @xmath45 fits the noise at higher frequencies .",
    "its fractional rms , @xmath46% , is too high to agree with the lower khz qpo . in fact , the value of the frequency and rms are similar to what it is seen in 4u 160852 and 4u 172834 for the upper khz qpo ( fig .  1 of mndez , van der klis & ford 2001 ) .",
    "nevertheless , given the relatively noisy spectrum at high frequencies such identification should be taken with care .      a qpo with frequency 714 hz has been found in at least two atoll sources , xte j1806246 ( wijnands & van der klis 1999 ; revnivtsev , borozdin & emelyanov 1999 ) and 4u 182030 ( wijnands et al . 1999 ) .",
    "these qpos are detected at the highest inferred mass accretion rates only , are short - lived ( a few hundreds of seconds ) and are localized in a very narrow region of the cd , namely the tip of the upper banana .",
    "they are reminiscent of those observed in z sources in the normal and flaring branches , when the source is accreting near the eddington limit .",
    "thus the detection of similar qpo in atoll sources at significantly lower accretion rates questions the current models that explain nbo in terms of near - eddington accretion ( fortner , lamb & miller 1989 ) .",
    "we searched for nbo - like qpo in  and tentatively found two of them at @xmath47 significance , at frequencies 10.3@xmath480.5 hz in o3 and 5.8@xmath480.2 hz in o5 ( fig .",
    "[ qpo ] ) .",
    "they have similar rms amplitude ( @xmath49% ) and q - values ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "the average values of the colors and intensity associated with these qpos are sc=1.11 , hc=0.52 , @xmath51=5045 count s@xmath16 and sc=1.06 , hc=0.51 , @xmath51=6870 count s@xmath16 , respectively . for the sake of comparison with other sources",
    "we also give the value of the x - ray luminosity : @xmath52 erg s@xmath16 for outburst 3 and @xmath53 erg s@xmath16 for outburst 5 . as a confirmation that they occur at the highest count rates , typical luminosities in the softest parts of the extreme island and banana states are @xmath54 and @xmath55 erg s@xmath16 , respectively .",
    "the values of the luminosity are for a distance of 2.5 kpc and the energy range 216 kev . in the other three outbursts the detection is only marginal .",
    "the low statistical significance of these qpos ( @xmath56 ) can be ascribed to their extremely short life .",
    "we have analysed all the available rxte data of  between 1997 february and 2002 may and investigated its spectral and timing properties in correlation .",
    "this work has been motivated by recent reports that show that if large data sets are used , the atoll sources displaying the largest ampitude variations in intensity show three - branch patterns in the color - color diagram ( cd ) , reminiscent of z sources ( muno , remillard & chakrabarty 2002 ; gierliski & done 2002 ) .",
    "consequently , they conclude that the distinction between atoll and z sources might be no longer justified",
    ". the extended island state , island state and banana state of atoll sources would then correspond to the horizontal branch ( hb ) , normal branch ( nb ) and flaring branch ( fb ) , respectively .",
    "the results of these studies were based on the spectral properties ( i.e. color - color diagram ) only . in order to be able to distinguish between the different types of low - mass x - ray binaries",
    "the rapid aperiodic variability associated with the various spectral states needs to be addressed as well ( hasinger & van der klis 1989 ) , and that is what we have attempted in this paper .",
    "we first make a comparison of the timing properties of with those of other atoll sources and then discuss whether ot not it can be considered as a z source .",
    "4u 160852 and  are the atoll sources that display the largest dynamic range in x - ray intensity ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "thus a comparison between these two sources is of particular interest .",
    "4u 160852 has been extensively studied by van straaten et al .",
    "( 2003 ) . by comparing the shape of the power spectra ( see fig .  7 in van straaten et al .",
    "2003 and our fig .",
    "[ pds ] ) and the results of the power spectral fits ( their table 2 and 3 and our table  [ fitres ] ) one can find distinct similarities between the two sources : the power spectra of intervals a , b and c in 4u 160852 resemble those of the extreme island state of , while interval d of 4u 160852 is reminiscent of the island state in . likewise , the shape and number of lorentzians appearing in the power spectra of the extreme island state of  are similar to those of the three low - luminosity x - ray bursters studied by belloni et al .",
    "( 2002 ) .",
    "it is worth noting the relevant role of the hard color in connection with the timing properties of the extreme island state . in  the characteristic frequencies of the timing features in the extreme island state increase from left to right",
    "this is opposite to what it is seen in 4u 1608 - 52 , where frequencies increase from right to left .",
    "however , in both sources the increase in frequencies occurs in correlation with an overall decrease in hard color .",
    "we therefore suggest that in the extreme island state it is the hard color , rather than the intensity , which is the main determining factor of the timing properties .",
    "we note , that black hole candidates are likewise characterized by power spectral states whose occurrence seems to primarily depend on spectral hardness and which are relatively insensitive to intensity , and which are associated with two - dimensional motion through the color - intensity plane rather than motion along a one - dimensional track ( homan et al .",
    "it may be that in the island and extreme island states , the states in which atoll sources are most similar to black holes ( e.g. , van der klis 1994a ; belloni , psaltis & van der klis 2002 ) , possibly because in these states the inner disk radius is furthest from the neutron star surface , this 2-d picture better describes neutron star behavior than the 1-d description appropriate to the banana state and to z sources .",
    "leaving aside the khz qpos , the overall shape of the banana - state power spectra of  present similarities with those of other atoll sources , namely , a strong red - noise component , the very - low frequency noise ( vlfn ) below @xmath2 1 hz and a broad and a narrow components describing the band - limited noise ( bln ) in the frequency range 1100 hz .",
    "compared to 4u 0614 + 09 , 4u 1608 - 52 and 4u 172834 ,  exbibits the strongest vlfn but the weakest bln . while the vlfn is normally described by either a power law with index between 1.5 - 2.0 or a zero centered lorentzian in the other atoll sources , it requires the use of two model components in , similar to the case of gx 13 + 1 ( schnerr et al .",
    "2003 ) . the broad band - limited noise component @xmath40 in  and 4u 1608 - 52 , or equivalently the zero centred lorentzian in 4u 172834 and 4u 0614 + 09 have similar rms values .",
    "in contrast , @xmath25 , which is clearly detected in these other atoll sources , is not significant in  in the banana state .",
    "gierliski & done ( 2002 ) suggested that the name atoll source is no longer appropiate as these type of low - mass x - ray binaries also display a three - branch pattern in the color - color diagram when large data sets of observations are used , reminiscent of the z pattern for which z sources are named .",
    "this effect is more pronounced in systems exhibiting large flux variations ( muno et al . 2002 ) , like .",
    "the cd of  ( fig .",
    "[ ccd ] ) does indeed show a branch ( the island state ) that can be interpreted to connect the two main branches like in a z shape .",
    "in addition , the correlation between the characteristic frequency of the 120 hz broad lorentzian @xmath29 and the band - limited noise component ( fig .  [ corr ] ) at low count rates , suggesting a common origin with the horizontal branch oscillations and lfn in z sources and the discovery of 714 hz qpo at the highest x - ray flux ( fig .",
    "[ qpo ] ) , reminiscent of the z - source normal / flaring branch oscillations , strengthen the similarities between  and z sources .    however , there are a number of systematic differences that clearly puts  outside the group of z sources .",
    "first , there is the motion in the cd . in the extreme island state as the count rate increases the soft color increases and the hard color decreases .",
    "then the source makes a rapid transition to the banana state and proceeds to harder colors ( right ) as the count rate increases further .",
    "however , after the peak of the outburst , when the intensity decreases the source does not follow exactly the reverse path . as shown in fig .",
    "[ cdmotion ] ,  enters the banana state ( extreme island state ) at a higher ( lower ) value of the soft color than when it leaves it .",
    "the source moves clokcwise following a rectangle track .",
    "it should be pointed out that the entrance into the banana state at such high soft color is not caused by the time resolution used ( @xmath2 1 day ) in fig .",
    "[ cdmotion ] .",
    "a 256-s bin shows the same effect .",
    "however , we can not rule out an observational origin since the time gap between the transition from the extreme island state to the banana state is @xmath12  5 days for outburst 5 and @xmath12  2.6 for outburst 4 ( table  [ timetran ] ) .",
    "if this is the case and the source entered the banana state from the left then the pattern that it would trace out in the cd would be that of an inverted triangle , much like 4u 170544 ( barret & olive 2002 ) .",
    "in contrast , the re - entrance into the extreme island state at a low soft color is probably not cause by the lack of data given the relatively short gap between the island state and the extreme island state ( just 1.6 days in outburst 5 ) .",
    "in either case this behavior is not that of z sources . in z sources ,",
    "the nb is not a fast transition between the other two branches , and the source follows the same path whether it is going up or down along the nb . in this respect ,  is like the other two atoll sources that display high - amplitude flux variations .",
    "more detailed looks into the motion of 4u 160852 and 4u 170544 have revealed different topologies from the classical z - shaped track .",
    "the motion of 4u 160852 resembles the greek letter @xmath58 ( van straaten et al .",
    "2003 ) and 4u 170544 describes an inverted triangle ( barret & olive 2002 ) . as noted above , these various topologies may simply be different aspects of 2-d motion through the color - intensity plane in which it is hard color that determines the timing properties .",
    "second , the amplitude of the x - ray luminosity change over the z track is also different . in  the x - ray luminosity throughout the cd ,",
    "i.e. , from the left of the banana state to the right of the extreme island state is about three orders of magnitude . in z sources ,",
    "luminosity changes are typically less than a factor of 2 ( di salvo et  al . 2000 , 2001 , 2002 ) .",
    "third , another difference is the velocity and time spent by the source in each spectral state .",
    "jonker et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) calculated that the z source gx 51 spent most of the time in the normal branch .",
    "in contrast , spends the smallest percentage of the the total observing time in the transition state ( the analogue to the normal branch would  be a z source ) .",
    "wijnands et  al .",
    "( 1997 ) found that cyg x2 moves through the z most slowly on the hb , faster on the nb and fastest on the fb . during a typical x - ray outburst ,",
    "i.e. , when  is x - ray active , it spends most of its time in the banana branch ( the analogue to the flaring branch ) .",
    "finally , the properties of the aperiodic variability of  also differ from those in z sources , especially at very low count rates .",
    "we can establish the following differences :    * the very existence of the extreme island state .",
    "although the characteristic frequencies in  increase along the extreme island state as the count rate increases as z sources do in the hb , the latter never reach the low frequencies that are seen in atoll sources in the extreme island state , even when at the left end of the hb . likewise , the rms amplitude of the noise components in the extreme island state is significantly higher than in a z source hb .",
    "the total rms amplitude of those components in  amounts to @xmath59% , while typically in z sources , it does not go above @xmath60% .",
    "the extreme island - state power spectra are typical of atoll sources . *",
    "the peaked noise components , such as @xmath29 and the upper khz qpo are narrow qpos on the hb in z sources , with typical values of the q parameter above 3 for the upper khz qpo , whereas they are considerably broader peaked noise components in the extreme island state in ( q @xmath8 0.5 ) . * in , the normal / flaring branch - like oscillation does not occur during the `` normal / flaring branch '' , i.e. the island or the lower banana branches but in the upper banana branch , just like in other atoll sources .",
    "* the strength of the khz qpos decreases as the z source moves along the z track from hb to nb .",
    "typically , the khz qpos become undetectable by the time the source reaches the middle of the nb .",
    "in contrast ,  presents khz qpos in the island and banana states . *",
    "the time scales of the aperiodic variability tend to decrease ( frequencies increase ) as the z source moves along the fb , which is the opposite behavior to what is is observed in  in the banana branch .",
    "we have investigated the timing and spectral properties of the soft x - ray transient  during five x - ray outbursts covering a period of more than five years .",
    "three spectral states show up in the color - color diagram of : a low / hard state , identified with an extreme island state , a high / soft state corresponding to the classic banana state and an intermediate state associated with the island state of atoll sources . we have found that the hard color plays a crucial role in determining the timing properties of the extreme island state .",
    "although the overall distribution of these states in the color - color diagram may resemble a z , neither the motion in the cd , nor the typical time scales through the different branches of the cd , nor the range of x - ray luminosities , nor the timing properties at very low count rates ( the existence of the extreme island state ) are compatible with the classical z - source behavior .",
