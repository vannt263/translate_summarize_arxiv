    "in the standard model of particle physics , mixing of the quark mass eigenstates in their charged current interactions is described by the cabibbo kobayashi maskawa ( ckm ) matrix  @xcite .",
    "this @xmath13 quark mixing matrix must be unitary and can be described by four independent parameters . if the standard model is complete , experimental determination of the ckm matrix elements should verify its unitarity .",
    "deviations from unitarity would indicate the presence of physics beyond the standard model . a variety of @xmath14-conserving and @xmath14-violating observables probe the elements of the ckm matrix and allow us to over - constrain it .",
    "many of the key observables require great precision or great sensitivity to provide the constraints at the level needed to test the validity of the standard model description .",
    "it thus remains a continuing experimental challenge to test the unitarity of the ckm matrix fully .",
    "study of the semileptonic decay of @xmath15 mesons plays a primary role in our understanding of the ckm matrix .",
    "these decays allow robust determination of the ckm matrix elements @xmath16 and @xmath17 by combining measured branching fractions with form factor calculations , such as those based on unquenched lattice qcd ( lqcd ) @xcite .",
    "in addition , these measurements will provide precision tests of lqcd itself  @xcite .",
    "one approach to tests of lqcd assumes unitarity of the ckm matrix and compares the constrained matrix elements @xcite to elements obtained with a combination of cleo - c measurements and lattice form factors .",
    "a second approach , which is independent of ckm elements and thus free from the unitarity assumption , compares the measured and calculated ratios of semileptonic and purely leptonic branching fractions .",
    "verification of lattice calculations at the few percent level will provide validation for use of the lattice in the @xmath18 system , where they are relied upon for several crucial theoretical quantities .",

    "a summary of the analysis is also provided in a shorter companion article  @xcite .",
    "the results are based on a sample of @xmath19 million @xmath0 pairs collected with the cleo - c detector at the cornell electron storage ring ( cesr ) from 281 pb@xmath20 of @xmath21 data at the @xmath22 resonance .",

    "the matrix element describing the semileptonic decay of a @xmath15 meson to a pseudoscalar meson @xmath25 is of the form @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the fermi constant , @xmath28 is the appropriate ckm matrix element and @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the leptonic and hadronic currents .",
    "the leptonic current can be written in terms of the electron and neutrino dirac spinors , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , @xmath33 in the case of pseudoscalar decays , where there is no axial - vector contribution , the hadronic current is given by @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the four - momenta of the parent @xmath15 meson and the daughter @xmath25 meson , respectively .",
    "the hadronic current is fundamentally a non - perturbative quantity that is difficult to evaluate .",
    "we can , however , re - parameterize the current by expressing it in terms of the independent four - momenta in the process , which for a pseudoscalar - to - pseudoscalar decay are the two four - momenta @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "we can identify @xmath39 as the four - momentum of the virtual @xmath40 boson .",
    "a typical formulation of the hadronic current in terms of these four - momenta is given by @xmath41 +    \\\\",

    "the non - perturbative contributions are incorporated in the scalar functions @xmath44 and @xmath45 , the form factors of the decay .",

    ", @xmath50 is a very good approximation . with this form for the hadronic current",
    "the partial decay width becomes @xmath51    the partial decay width ( eq .  [ slwidth ] ) clearly reveals that extraction of the ckm matrix elements from measured rates requires prediction of the semileptonic form factors . theoretical calculation of the form factors therefore has become a considerable industry .",
    "we focus here on parameterizations of the form factors that we employ in our form factor studies and in extraction of @xmath17 and @xmath16 .",
    "the goal of any particular parameterization of the semileptonic form factors is to provide an accurate , and physically meaningful , expression of the strong dynamics in the decays . to that end",
    ", one may express the form factors in terms of a dispersion relation , an approach that has been well established in the literature ( see for example ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it is common to write the dispersive representation in terms of an explicit pole and a sum of effective poles : @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are expansion parameters . given the underlying @xmath55 quark transition of the semileptonic decay , the mass @xmath56 is the mass of the lowest - lying @xmath57 vector meson .",
    "the parameter @xmath58 gives the contribution from the vector meson pole at @xmath59 .",
    "using this dispersion relation the true form factor can be approximated to any desired degree of accuracy by keeping sufficient terms in the expansion .",
    "this approach has the drawback that the decay dynamics are not explicitly predicted .",
    "additionally , experimental data have suggested the need for only a few parameters in the description of the form factor shape .",
    "it is therefore natural to seek simplifications of this parameterization that can still capture the correct dynamics .",
    "removing the sum over effective poles entirely , leaving only the explicit vector meson pole , provides one simplification route that is typically referred to as `` nearest pole dominance '' or `` vector - meson dominance '' .",
    "the resulting `` simple pole '' parameterization of the form factor is given by @xmath60 experimental data disagree with the physical basis for this approximation , since measurements of the parameter @xmath56 that fit the data do not agree with the expected vector meson masses  @xcite .",
    "effectively , at low or medium values of @xmath10 the spectrum is distorted compared to the simple pole model , receiving contributions from the continuum of effective poles above the lowest lying pole mass .    the modified pole , or becirevic - kaidalov ( bk ) parameterization  @xcite , was proposed to address this problem .",
    "the parameterization keeps the first term from the effective pole expansion , while making simplifications such that the form factor can be expressed using only two parameters : the intercept @xmath61 and an additional shape parameter .",
    "form factor , which we are neglecting due to the small electron mass , is also taken into account . ]",
    "the parameterization is typically expressed in the form @xmath62 this parameterization has recently been widely used in the extraction of semileptonic form factors from experimental measurements  @xcite .",
    "in addition , some recent lqcd calculations of the form factor have relied on this parameterization for extrapolation and interpolation purposes  @xcite .",
    "this scheme requires several assumptions to reduce the multiple parameters initially present ( eq .  [ disp_effp ] ) to one .",
    "the bk ansatz assumes that the gluon hard - scattering contributions ( @xmath63 ) are close to zero and that scaling violations ( @xmath64 ) are close to unity , which may be succinctly expressed as @xmath65 once again , however , the experimental data do not bear out these assumptions  @xcite",
    ". we should observe @xmath66 in order to obtain @xmath67 , whereas the observed data are removed from such values by many standard deviations .",
    "we note that both functional forms can provide adequate parameterizations of the data if their parameters are allowed to be non - physical . without a physical underpinning for the parameterization , however , parameters obtained from theory and/or from different experiments may not agree if their form factor sensitivities differ as a function of @xmath10 .",
    "our primary form factor shape analysis therefore utilizes a series expansion around @xmath68 that has been advocated by several groups for a physical description of heavy meson form factors  @xcite .",
    "the series expansion is congruous with the dispersion relations , and is guaranteed to contain the true form factor , yet is still rich enough to describe all variations that affect the physical observables .    to achieve a convergent series ,",
    "the expansion is formulated as an analytic continuation of the form factor into the complex @xmath69 plane .",
    "there is a branch cut on the real axis for @xmath70 that is mapped onto the unit circle by the variable @xmath71 , defined as @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 is the ( arbitrary ) @xmath10 value that maps to @xmath75 .",
    "the expression for the form factor becomes @xmath76^k,\\ ] ] with @xmath77 the @xmath78 factor accommodates sub - threshold resonances , which overcomes the convergence issues that a naive expansion would face with a nearby pole .",
    "good convergence properties are expected since the physical region is restricted to @xmath79 .",
    "the physical observables do not depend on the choice of @xmath80 , which can be any analytic function , or on the value of @xmath74 .",
    "we report @xmath81 parameters that correspond to @xmath82 and the `` standard '' choice for @xmath83 ( see , _ e.g. _ ref .",
    "@xcite and appendix  [ app : zexpand ] ) , which results from bounding @xmath84 from unitarity considerations .",
    "appendix  [ app : zexpand ] presents results for an alternate choice of @xmath74 that minimizes the maximum value of @xmath85 over the physical range .",
    "if the series converges quickly , as expected , it is likely that only the first two or three terms will be able to be seen in the data .",
    "we will explore the number of terms needed to adequately describe our data .",
    "while our primary form factor and ckm results will be based on the series expansion , we will also provide results based on the two pole parameterizations for comparative purposes .",
    "the analysis technique rests upon association of the missing energy and momentum in an event with the neutrino four - momentum @xcite , an approach enabled by the excellent hermeticity and resolution of the cleo - c detector @xcite .",
    "charged particles are detected over @xmath86 of the solid angle by two wire tracking chambers within a @xmath87  t solenoid magnet .",
    "the momentum resolution is @xmath88 at @xmath89 mev/@xmath90 .",
    "specific ionization measurements from the tracking system in combination with a ring imaging erenkov detector ( rich ) @xcite provide particle identification .",
    "a csi(tl ) crystal electromagnetic calorimeter provides coverage over about @xmath86 of @xmath91 , and achieves a typical @xmath92 mass resolution of @xmath93 mev/@xmath94 .",

    "below @xmath100 mev@xmath96 the efficiency falls rapidly , reaching 60% in the @xmath102 mev@xmath96 region . to reduce our sensitivity to final state radiation ( fsr ) , we add photons within 3.5@xmath103 of the initial electron momentum back into the tracking - based four - momentum .    charged pions and kaons from the signal decay are identified using specific ionization and rich measurements .",
    "pion candidates below 750 mev@xmath96 and kaon candidates below 500 mev@xmath96 are identified using only specific ionization information , which is required to be within three standard deviations ( @xmath104 ) of that expected for the assigned particle type . for pion candidates above 650 mev@xmath96",
    ", we also require the pion mass hypothesis be more likely than the kaon mass hypothesis . above these",
    "momenta , candidate tracks must also pass rich identification criteria .",
    "specifically , we require that pion ( kaon ) candidates are more than 3@xmath104 closer to a pion ( kaon ) hypothesis than a kaon ( pion ) hypothesis .",
    "a @xmath92 candidate must have a @xmath105 mass within 2.5@xmath104 of the @xmath92 mass .",
    "@xmath106 candidates are reconstructed using a constrained vertex fit to candidate @xmath107 daughter tracks .",
    "the @xmath107 mass must be within 4.5@xmath104 of the @xmath106 mass .    to reconstruct the undetected neutrino we utilize the hermeticity of the cleo - c detector to find the missing energy and momentum .",
    "in the process @xmath108 , the total energy of the beams is imparted to the @xmath0 system . because the beam energies are symmetric and the beam crossing angle is small at cesr , each produced @xmath15 has an energy of the beam energy to within a small correction .",
    "the missing four - momentum in an event is given by @xmath109 , where the event four - momentum @xmath110 is known from the energy and crossing angle of the cesr beams .",
    "charged and neutral particles for the sums must pass selection criteria designed to achieve the best possible @xmath111 resolution by balancing the efficiency for detecting true particles against the rejection of false ones .    for the charged four - momentum sum , @xmath112 ,",
    "optimal selection is achieved with topological criteria .",
    "these criteria minimize multiple - counting that can result from low - momentum tracks that curl in the magnetic field , charged particles that decay in flight or interact within the detector , and spurious tracks .",
    "tracks that are actually segments of a single low transverse momentum `` curling '' particle are identified by selecting reconstructed track pairs with opposite curvature whose innermost and outermost diametric radii each match within 14 cm and whose separation in @xmath83 is within 180@xmath113 . for physics use",
    "we select the track segment that will best represent the original charged particle based on track quality and distance - of - closest - approach to the beam spot .",
    "we employ similar algorithms to identify particles that curl more than once , creating three or more track segments .",
    "we also identify tracks that have scattered or decayed in the drift chamber , causing the original track to end and one or more tracks to begin in a new direction .",
    "we keep only the track segment with the majority of its hits before the interaction point .",
    "spurious tracks are identified by their low hit density and/or low number of overall hits and rejected .",
    "each hadronic track must be assigned a mass hypothesis to calculate its contribution to the total energy sum .",
    "we assign a most probable mass hypothesis by combining detector measurement with particle production information .",
    "the production information is introduced because it is only statistically advantageous to identify a track as a kaon at a momentum where many more pions than kaons are produced when the detector s particle i d information strongly favors a kaon . for each track , we first calculate a likelihood for the kaon and pion hypothesis based on specific ionization and rich measurements .",
    "those likelihoods are then weighted by the monte carlo ( mc ) prediction for the relative @xmath114 and @xmath115 abundances in @xmath15 decays at that track s momentum , which then gives us the true probability for each mass hypothesis .    for the neutral four - momentum sum , @xmath116",
    ", clusters resulting from the interactions of charged hadrons must be avoided . as a first step , calorimeter showers passing the standard cleo proximity - matching ( within 15 cm of a charged track )",
    "are eliminated .",
    "optimizations also revealed that all showers under 50 mev should be eliminated .",
    "the processes that result in reconstructed showers ( `` splitoffs '' ) separate from but within about 25@xmath103 of a proximity - matched shower tend to result in an energy distribution over the @xmath117 central array of the splitoff shower that `` points back '' to the core hadronic shower .",
    "we combine this information with the ratio of energies in the @xmath117 to @xmath118 arrays of crystals , whether the shower forms a good @xmath92 , and the mc predictions for relative spectra for true photons versus splitoff showers to provide an optimal suppression of the contribution .",
    "association of the missing four - momentum with the neutrino four - momentum is only accurate if the event contains no more than one neutrino and if all true particles are detected . for events with additional missing particles or doubly - counted particles ,",
    "the signal modes tend not to reconstruct properly while background processes tend to smear into our sensitive regions .",
    "hence , it is worthwhile to reject events for which independent measures indicate these problems .",
    "we therefore exclude events that have either more than one electron or non - zero net charge .",
    "multiple electrons indicate an increased likelihood for multiple neutrinos , while non - zero net charge indicates at least one missed or doubly - counted charged particle .",
    "after application of the above criteria approximately 90% of the signal mc @xmath111 distribution is contained in a central core with @xmath119 mev@xmath96 .    to further enhance the association of the missing momentum with an undetected neutrino in our final event sample ,",
    "we require that the @xmath120 resolution , @xmath121 is dominated by the @xmath122 term since the resolution of @xmath111 is roughly half that of @xmath122 .",
    "mc simulation indicated an optimal requirement of @xmath123 gev@xmath124 , which ( noting @xmath125 for signal ) provides selection at approximately constant @xmath122 resolution . additionally , because of the superior @xmath111 resolution , in subsequent calculations we take @xmath126 .",

    "these quantities are corrected for the small boost resulting from the 3 mrad beam crossing angle .",
    "because the @xmath131 resolution dominates the @xmath132 resolution , we can improve our @xmath133 measurement by scaling it by the factor @xmath134 satisfying @xmath135 .",
    "we use @xmath136 for the neutrino momentum in computation of @xmath137 . the resulting resolution for @xmath130",
    "is 4 mev@xmath138 .",
    "selection criteria were optimized by studying mc samples independent of those used elsewhere in the analysis .",
    "sources of backgrounds include events with fake electrons , non - charm continuum production ( @xmath139 , @xmath140 and @xmath141 ) , and @xmath0 processes other than signal .",
    "the optimal @xmath132 requirement was determined to be @xmath142 gev . for the cabibbo - favored modes , the background level remaining after this selection is only a few percent of the signal level .",

    "we re - fit the data with these biased mc samples , and use the deviation of the fit results from their nominal values to provide an estimate of the uncertainty .",

    "we measure the background pion spectra in data using the inclusive @xmath15 decays on the `` other side '' of a fully reconstructed hadronically - decayed @xmath15 `` tag '' , and correct the mc spectra accordingly . to be conservative in the associated systematic uncertainty ,",
    "we take the full difference for results obtained using corrected and uncorrected spectra . in the signal @xmath289 mode we also correct the cross - feed background from @xmath290 events that results from misidentifying a @xmath286 as a @xmath287 .",
    "once again the uncertainty estimate is taken as the difference of our measured rates obtained using the corrected and uncorrected fake rates .    for three of our signal modes , @xmath2 , @xmath291 and @xmath147 ,",
    "we have systematic uncertainty associated with the additional @xmath130 resolution parameter .",
    "the statistical uncertainty already has a contribution from allowing this parameter to float .",
    "we estimate the contribution to the systematic uncertainty for each mode by increasing the value of that mode s resolution parameter by one standard deviation beyond the best fit result .    we must also account for any uncertainty associated with modeling event loss from the single electron veto because of secondary electrons from photon conversions and other processes . according to data studies ( using",
    "the cleo - c `` tagged '' samples , where one of the two @xmath15 mesons from the @xmath1 is fully reconstructed ) , our mc simulation models the number of secondary electrons in our events accurately within the error of the study .",
    "the most likely potential source of uncertainty arises from mis - modeling the rate for photon conversion within the detector material . for the uncertainty estimate we therefore vary this contribution over the range allowed by the maximum allowed uncertainty of our data study , about 8% .    for the systematic uncertainty associated with the final state radiation ( fsr ) modeling , we take the difference between the klor and photos predictions .",
    "this simulates a change in the radiative branching fraction of up to 16% in the most extreme case .",
    "because the majority of the correction results from the lack of the fsr interference terms between the charged hadron and electron , the systematic should be an overestimate of the fsr uncertainty from final or initial - state particles .",
    "this overestimate compensates for the unknown direct ( structure - dependent ) contributions .",
