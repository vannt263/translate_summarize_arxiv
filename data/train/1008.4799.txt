    "understanding the formation and evolution of galaxy groups is crucial to solving the general problem of galaxy formation , as groups contain most of the galaxies in the universe at the present day ( e.g. , mulchaey 2000 ) , and a large fraction of the universal stellar mass is formed in groups ( e.g. , crain et al .",
    "they can also potentially yield important insights into the formation and evolution of more massive and rare galaxy clusters , since in the current cosmological paradigm clusters acquire most of their mass through the accretion / mergers of groups .",
    "groups of galaxies are special systems in an observational sense as well , as it is possible to probe both the stellar and hot gas components of these systems directly , whereas for normal galaxies detecting the diffuse hot gas is presently very challenging . as highlighted in many recent theoretical papers ( e.g. , bower et al .",
    "2008 , hereafter b08 ; mccarthy et al .  2010 ; fabjan et al .  2010 ; puchwein et al .",
    "2010 ) , the properties of the hot gas and of the stellar component are intimately linked and any successful model must be able to reproduce both simultaneously .",
    "x - ray observations of nearby , relatively bright galaxy groups have revealed that the hot gas ( the intragroup medium ,  for short ) has some puzzling properties . in particular , it is on average less dense than the hot gas found in massive clusters ( known as the intracluster medium , icm for short ) .",
    "this is not what one expects if gravitational processes alone determine the thermodynamic properties of the gas ( e.g. , voit , kay , bryan 2005 , hereafter vkb05 ) .",
    "the observed decrease of the gas density with halo mass therefore indicates that one or more non - gravitational processes ( e.g. , radiative cooling , star formation , and/or feedback ) has had a larger effect on groups than on massive clusters .",
    "the fact that a non - negligible fraction of the total mass of baryons in groups is locked up in stars ( e.g. , balogh et al .",
    "2001 ; lin & mohr 2004 ; gonzalez et al .  2007 ;",
    "giodini et al .",
    "2009 ) is already testament that non - gravitational processes are important on the scale of groups .",
    "the entropy , as @xmath1 and use units of kev @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath4 is the temperature of the gas and @xmath5 is the electron number density .",
    "the observational entropy @xmath6 is related to the thermodynamic specific entropy @xmath7 via @xmath8 and , like the thermodynamic entropy , @xmath6 will be conserved in any adiabatic process .",
    "] of the  is perhaps the best tool for studying the impact of non - gravitational physics , since it maintains a record of the thermal history of the gas ( see voit et al .",
    "2003 and voit 2005 for further discussion ) . using _",
    "rosat _ observations , ponman et al .",
    "( 1999 ) were the first to show convincingly that galaxy groups have ` excess ' entropy relative to massive clusters ; i.e. , when one scales the radius and entropy by some suitable characteristic radius and entropy that depend only on system mass ( e.g. , the virial radius and ` virial entropy ' ; see section 3.1 ) , groups typically have higher scaled entropies at all scaled radii than clusters . and",
    "both groups and clusters have excess entropy relative to theoretical models that only account for gravitational heating ( e.g. , balogh et al .",
    "1999 ; babul et al .",
    "2002 ; voit et al .",
    "more recent observations , particularly with _ asca _ , _ chandra _ , and _ xmm - newton _ , have improved the quality of the measurements and extended both the range of the masses and radii over which the entropy has been measured ( e.g. , finoguenov et al .  2002 ; ponman et al .  2003 ; sun et al .  2009 ; johnson et al .  2009 ; pratt et al .  2010 ; giodini et al .",
    "these newer results have generally confirmed those from the _ rosat _ satellite : groups contain excess entropy relative to clusters as well as to models that only take into account gravitational heating .",
    "on the theory side , many suggestions have been put forward for the physical origin of the excess entropy . the most commonly mentioned are ` preheating ' ( first introduced by kaiser 1991 and evrard & henry 1991 ) , radiative cooling ( e.g. , bryan 2000 ) , and supernova ( sn ) and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) feedback within groups .",
    "preheating is conceptually simple : at early times the entropy of the _",
    "proto_-  is raised by feedback processes ( such as outflows driven by sn or agn ) .",
    "the increased entropy prevents the gas from being easily accreted or compressed , resulting in a lower mean density ( and gas mass fraction ) for groups .",
    "note that for a fixed level of entropy injection the effect is larger for groups than for clusters , since groups have lower entropies than clusters .",
    "somewhat paradoxically , radiative cooling has also been shown to raise the entropy of the gas in groups and clusters .",
    "it does so not by heating the gas , but by selectively removing the lowest entropy gas from the hot  phase , turning it into cold gas and stars , and thereby raising the mean entropy of the hot gas that is unable to cool ( e.g. , bryan 2000 ) .",
    "feedback from winds driven by sne and jets / winds launched by supermassive black holes ( hereafter bhs ) originating from orbiting group galaxies may also significantly raise the entropy of the  by direct heating . at present , no clear consensus has emerged as to which of these processes are most important for raising the entropy of the gas over and above that generated through gravitational shock heating alone .    in the present study",
    ", we seek to develop a better understanding of the physical processes that set the _ global _ thermodynamic properties of the igrm .",
    "we will do this by exploiting a suite of high resolution cosmological hydrodynamical simulations which form part of the overwhelmingly large simulations project ( owls ; schaye et al .",
    "the purpose of the  project is to explore the effects of varying so - called ` subgrid ' physics in the simulations , such as radiative cooling , star formation , and sn and bh feedback .",
    "all simulations are started from identical initial conditions , with each simulation varying a parameter within one of the subgrid physics modules or switching on / off one of the subgrid processes entirely . by comparing the different simulations ,",
    "it is possible to isolate which processes are most important for raising the entropy of the igrm . in particular",
    ", we will compare not only the present - day entropy distributions of the groups in the different simulations , but also , for the first time , the _ lagrangian histories _ of the gas in the different runs .",
    "this allows us to follow the heating and cooling of a parcel of gas over cosmic time .",
    "we will show that a particularly powerful discriminator is to identify and follow the thermal properties of the same sets of particles in the ( identical ) initial conditions of the various simulations .    in mccarthy",
    "( 2010 ; hereafter paper i ) we showed that the  _ agn _ model yields an excellent match to a wide range of optical and x - ray observations of nearby galaxy groups , including the entropy , temperature , and metallicity distribution and their dependence on halo mass , as well as the stellar mass of the group and the central brightest galaxy ( cbg ) and the stellar age of the cbg .",
    "based on comparisons between this model and a number of other models , we argue below that , in fact , _ none _ of the three physical scenarios outlined above provides an accurate description for how the entropy of the  was raised . instead , we show that gas that constitutes the present - day  was that which _ escaped _ significant agn feedback and the excess entropy is due primarily to the ejection of the lowest entropy gas at high redshift ( i.e. , the gas that was significantly heated is no longer within the virialized region ) .",
    "the present paper is organised as follows . in section 2",
    "we provide a brief description of the simulations . in section 3",
    "we present our main results on the thermal history of the  in the simulations . in section 4",
    "we explore further how the agn feedback raises the entropy of the igrm . finally , in section 5",
    "we summarize and discuss our findings .",
    "all quantities presented in this study ( e.g. , entropy , temperature , density ) are in physical , rather than co - moving , units .",
    "an in - depth presentation of the  project can be found in schaye et al .",
    "we therefore present only a brief description of the simulations here .",
    "all of the  runs we analyse are initialised from identical initial conditions , in particular from a @xmath9cdm cosmological density field ( with a power spectrum computed using cmbfast ) in a periodic box of @xmath10 mpc on a side at @xmath11 . in generating this density field , the various relevant cosmological parameters ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 )",
    "were set equal to the maximum - likelihood values found from the analysis of the 3-year _ wmap _ cosmic microwave background data ( 0.0418 , 0.238 , 0.762 , 0.73 , 0.74 , 0.95 , respectively ; spergel et al .",
    "the simulations are evolved to @xmath18 using the treepm - sph code gadget-3 ( last described in springel 2005 ) .",
    "we extract from the final snapshot ( @xmath18 ) all galaxy groups for which @xmath19m@xmath20m@xmath21 ( where m@xmath22 is the total mass within a radius that encloses a mean density of 200 times the present - day critical density of the universe ) . the simulations use @xmath23 particles , yielding a particle mass for gas and dark matter of @xmath24 m@xmath25 and m@xmath26 m@xmath25 , respectively .",
    "thus , a @xmath27 m@xmath25 galaxy group is resolved with @xmath28 gas and dark matter particles . as shown in the appendix of paper i",
    ", this resolution is sufficient to robustly predict the properties of galaxy groups in the simulations .    [ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : simlist ]    in paper i ( see also schaye et al .",
    "2010 ) , we described in some detail the implementation of ` subgrid ' physics ( e.g. , radiative cooling , star formation , and sn and agn feedback ) in the gadget-3 code and how we select and analyse galaxy groups .",
    "we refer the reader to that study for details .",
    "as discussed in section 1 , the thermal properties of the  differ from those predicted by simulations that include only gravity and basic non - radiative hydrodynamics . as a result",
    ", it is now widely believed that one or more non - gravitational processes are responsible for modifying the properties of the hot gas .",
    "the most likely culprits are cooling , star formation , and feedback , which are implemented in the  simulations using subgrid prescriptions .",
    "the power of the  project is not only that it systematically varies the relevant physical parameters of a given subgrid physics module , but that it also systematically varies which subgrid processes are switched on / off .",
    "this is the best and perhaps only way to isolate which processes are most important for establishing the thermodynamics properties of the igrm .",
    "we note that the physics that raises the entropy of the icm in massive clusters is quite likely to be closely related to that which operates on the scales of groups . however , the volume of the  runs [ ( @xmath10 mpc)@xmath29 is not sufficiently large to contain massive galaxy clusters .",
    "we have plans to carry out both ` zoomed ' initial condition and larger periodic box simulations in the future .",
    "below , we provide brief descriptions of the runs that we analyse in the present study .",
    "the runs we have selected represent a range of interesting limiting cases and not the entire  suite of simulations . in table 1",
    "we list all the simulations , the corresponding names in the  project and the differences in the included subgrid physics .      *",
    "_ nocool _ : this model omits the effects of radiative cooling , star formation , and feedback from sne and bhs .",
    "it does , however , include _ net _ photoheating from a haardt & madau ( 2001 ) uv / x - ray background ( i.e. , whenever @xmath30 , otherwise @xmath31 ) . however , this photoheating has negligible consequences for the gas that constitutes the  at the present - day for redshifts of @xmath32 ( see the appendix ) .",
    "therefore , this model is basically equivalent to a pure ` non - radiative ' run below @xmath33 .",
    "we include net photoheating purely for consistency , since all other  runs include uv photoheating .",

    "_ zcool_sf _ : radiative cooling rates for the gas are computed on an element - by - element basis by interpolating within pre - computed tables ( generated with the cloudy software package , last described in ferland et al .",
    "1998 ) that contain cooling rates as a function of density , temperature , and redshift calculated in the presence of the cosmic microwave background and the haardt & madau ( 2001 ) uv / x - ray background ( see wiersma et al .",
    "star formation is tracked in the simulations following the pressure - based prescription of schaye & dalla vecchia ( 2008 ) , which reproduces the observed kennicutt - schmidt law by construction .",
    "the timed release of individual elements by both massive ( type ii sne and stellar winds ) and intermediate mass stars ( type ia sne and asymptotic giant branch stars ) is included following the prescription of wiersma et al .",
    "( 2009b ) .",
    "a set of 11 individual elements are followed in these simulations ( h , he , c , n , o , ne , mg , si , s , ca , fe ) , which represent all the important species for computing radiative cooling rates ( wiersma et al .",
    "as is the case for other  runs , uv / x - ray photoheating is included .",
    "however , as already noted , this is unimportant below @xmath33 and this model therefore effectively represents a ` no feedback ' model for galaxy groups .",

    "this choice of parameters corresponds to using approximately 40% of the total energy available sne , for a chabrier ( 2003 ) stellar initial mass function ( imf ) ( which is adopted in all of the simulations presented in this paper , with the obvious exception of _ nocool _ ) . * _ zcool_sf_sn _ : this model is identical to _ primcool_sf_sn _ except cooling rates are calculated on an element - by - element basis , as described above for the _",

    "a brief description is as follows .",
    "bhs grow in mass through mergers with other bhs and through the accretion of neighbouring gas .",
    "gas is assumed to accrete at the local bondi - hoyle - lyttleton rate .",
    "however , if the local gas density exceeds @xmath38 then this rate is multiplied by the factor @xmath39 ^ 2 $ ] to compensate for the fact that our simulations lack both the resolution and the physics to model a cold , interstellar gas phase ( see booth & schaye 2009 for a discussion ) . a certain fraction of the rest mass energy of the accreted gas , @xmath40 , is used to heat a number of randomly selected neighbouring gas particles , @xmath41 , by raising their temperatures by an amount @xmath42 .",
    "( note that the bhs store feedback energy until it is sufficient to heat @xmath41 particles by @xmath42 . )",
    "this efficiency is a free parameter of the model .",
    "booth & schaye ( 2009 ) find that a value of @xmath43 yields a good match to the observed @xmath18 relations between bh mass and stellar mass and velocity dispersion and the @xmath18 cosmic bh density .",
    "we therefore fix @xmath40 to this value . as discussed below",
    "( see section 4.4 ) , the predicted properties of galaxy groups are insensitive to the adopted value of @xmath41 ( which , for the present study , we set to unity ) but _ are _ sensitive to @xmath42 if this quantity is set to a value that is comparable to ( or lower than ) the virial temperature of the high redshift progenitors of galaxy groups . for specificity",
    ", we set @xmath44 k and @xmath45 .    to give a visual example of the importance of including non - gravitational processes in simulations of the  we present fig .",
    "1 , which shows projected mass - weighted entropy , surface gas mass density , and projected mass - weighted temperature of the gas in and around the same randomly - selected galaxy group in _ nocool _ , _ zcool_sf_sn _ , and _",
    "zcool_sf_sn_agn_. the maps are @xmath46 mpc on a side .",
    "particles were interpolated to a 3d uniform grid ( with @xmath47 pixels ) using the sph smoothing kernel and projected along the z - axis of the simulation box . in _ nocool _",
    "the hot , high entropy gas is confined to the area in the immediate vicinity of the group and to a large filament that runs from the bottom left to the top right of the maps .",
    "the introduction of supernova feedback ( and cooling and star formation ; _",
    "zcool_sf_sn _ ) results in a relatively small amount of moderate - entropy gas being expelled into voids .",
    "the inclusion of agn feedback has a much more dramatic effect , with large amounts of high entropy / high temperature gas being ejected out into the surrounding intergalactic medium .",
    "we discuss in detail the importance of gas expulsion by agn in sections 3 and 4 .",
    "in this section we first present the radial entropy distributions of the various  runs , demonstrating that the inclusion of cooling and feedback processes indeed raises the entropy of the hot gas in groups .",
    "we then examine the entropy histories of these runs in detail and compare them with one another to deduce which processes are most important for raising the entropy of the gas .",
    "we begin by examining the 3d radial entropy distributions of the hot gas ( @xmath48 k ) in the  runs described in section 2.1 . in fig .  2 we plot the median 3d mass - weighted entropy profiles for all groups with masses between @xmath49 [ approximately 70 groups with a median mass of @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the total mass within the radius that encloses a mean density of 500 times the present - day critical density of the universe .",
    "the radial coordinate has been normalised by @xmath52 , which is the radius that encloses m@xmath53 ( typically @xmath54 ) .",
    "the entropy has been normalised by @xmath55 , the ` virial entropy ' , which we define , following vkb05 , as : @xmath56^{2/3 } } \\\\ & = & \\frac{g m_{500 } \\mu m_h}{2 r_{500 } [ 500 f_b \\rho_{crit}(z=0 ) / ( \\mu_e m_h)]^{2/3 } } \\nonumber \\\\ & \\propto & \\biggl(\\frac{m_{500}}{f_b}\\biggr)^{2/3 } \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath57 , and @xmath58 is the mean molecular weight per free electron .",
    "note that @xmath55 is _ not _ the entropy at @xmath52 , i.e. , @xmath59 , even in the case of the self - similar model .",
    "this is because @xmath55 is defined in terms of the mean gas density within @xmath52 ( as opposed to the gas density at @xmath52 ) for a halo with the universal baryon fraction and the virial temperature , @xmath60 , which is not equivalent to the gas temperature at @xmath52 for non - isothermal mass distributions [ for an nfw distribution , @xmath61 , assuming hydrostatic equilibrium and that gas traces dark matter ] .",
    "therefore , @xmath55 depends only on the halo mass , which is dominated by dark matter , and is insensitive to the thermodynamic state of the gas .    for reference",
    "we show in fig .",

    "all other  runs not shown ( see schaye et al .",
    "2010 ) fall in between _ nocool _ and _ zcool_sf _ , in terms of their scaled entropy at intermediate radii . for reference",

    "zcool_sf _ and _ primcool_sf",
    "_ ) yield _ higher _ entropy than the runs that include sn feedback , while the run that includes agn feedback ( _ zcool_sf_sn_agn _ ) yields a similar entropy as the run with metal - line cooling and without feedback ( _ zcool_sf _ ) . ]    since we are interested primarily in investigating what sets the _",
    "global _ thermodynamic properties of the igrm , we will focus our attention on quantities such as the median gas particle entropy of groups .",
    "typically , the median entropy corresponds to the entropy at intermediate radii of @xmath64 . from fig .",
    "2 we see that over this range in radii the simulations show a wide range of entropy values , spanning nearly an order of magnitude in @xmath65 .",
    "of course , not all of the models we have included are physically reasonable , but several of them represent limiting cases which can be used to isolate the importance of certain subgrid physical processes , and the large differences between the models make it easier to do so .    for example , _ nocool _ , which is effectively a non - radiative run ( note the agreement between the _ nocool _ run and the power - law fit of vkb05 , who fit approximately to the range @xmath66 ) , yields the lowest entropy of any of the runs .",
    "this is not unexpected , since the only process by which the entropy may be raised in this model is through gravitational shock heating .",
    "since gravity has no preferred scale , the resulting shape and normalisation of the entropy profile does not depend on system mass , which is why it is sometimes referred to as the ` self - similar ' profile .",
    "note that within @xmath67 the entropy profile deviates from a pure power - law behaviour , flattening into a core .",
    "this was also found by vkb05 ( see also frenk et al .",
    "1999 ) for both adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) and sph non - radiative cosmological simulations .",
    "the physical origin of the core appears to be related to the efficiency of energy exchange between gas and dark matter ( mccarthy et al .  2007 ;",
    "see also mitchell et al .",
    "2009 ) .    _",
    "zcool_sf _ represents another interesting limiting case , as it includes cooling via both thermal bremsstrahlung and ( metal ) lines but no feedback .",
    "this model yields very high entropies at intermediate radii . that simulations _ without _ feedback can yield entropies in excess of the self - similar model has been noted previously ( e.g. , muanwong et al .",
    "2002 ; dav et al .",
    "2002 ) and explained , at least qualitatively , by knight & ponman ( 1997 ) and by bryan ( 2000 ) , voit & bryan ( 2001 ) , and voit et al .",
    "( 2002 ) ( hereafter collectively referred to as vb ) .",
    "these authors argued that radiative cooling acts to selectively remove the lowest entropy gas from the hot phase , turning it into cold gas and stars . in the language of vb , radiative cooling",
    "` truncates ' the entropy distribution of the gas ( voit & bryan 2001 and voit et al .",
    "2002 also noted the possibility that feedback could truncate the entropy distribution , by removing the lowest entropy gas ) .",
    "as a result of this truncation , the mean entropy of the remaining hot gas increases with time .",
    "this hot gas , which was initially at large radii , due to its buoyancy , would then flow inwards , approximately adiabatically , to fill the pressure decrement left by the gas that was converted into cold ( pressure - less ) form .",
    "as fig .  2 emphasises , this results in a large amount of excess entropy in the remaining gas",
    ". we will show below that this is because of the unrealistically large fraction of baryons that are converted into stars in this run .",
    "the results of _ primcool_sf _ , which is identical to _ zcool_sf _ except that the cooling rates are calculated assuming primordial abundances , are also consistent with the vb truncation hypothesis .",
    "this run also yields entropy in excess of the _ nocool _ ( self - similar ) result , but not to the same degree as _ zcool_sf_.",
    "this can be understood in terms of the reduced efficiency of cooling due to the neglect of metal - line emission in _",
    "primcool_sf_. the reduced cooling rate results in a smaller truncation of the entropy distribution of the hot gas which , in turn , leads to a smaller rise in the entropy .",
    "the relatively large difference in the resulting entropy distributions of _",
    "zcool_sf _ and _ primcool_sf _ highlights the importance of metal - line cooling in the simulations .",
    "models without metal - line cooling will seriously underestimate the fraction of baryons in stars relative to models that do include metal - line cooling .",
    "comparisons of such models to observations can therefore quite easily lead to spurious conclusions about the required efficiency of feedback processes .",
    "note also that the difference in the resulting entropy distributions between runs with and without metal - line cooling is even larger when feedback is included ( compare _ primcool_sf_sn _ and _ zcool_sf_sn _ ) , since more particles are enriched due to expulsion of metals from star - forming regions by sne , particularly at high redshift .",
    "unlike the  runs , most simulations presented in the literature calculate cooling rates assuming primordial abundances only or , if they do include metals , they do so by assuming abundances that are a fixed fraction of solar .     as a function of group mass , m@xmath53 , for the  runs investigated in this study .",
    "the mass fractions have been normalised to the universal baryon fraction , @xmath68 .",
    "the dashed line in the bottom panel represents the median baryon fraction of the high mass systems in the sph non - radiative millennium gas simulation ( crain et al .",
    "2007 ) , while the dotted lines represent the 10th and 90th percentiles from that study .",
    "variations in the included subgrid physics can have a large effect on the predicted stellar and gas mass fractions but the total baryonic fraction is always near the universal value .",
    "the one exception is the run that includes agn feedback ( _ zcool_sf_sn_agn _ ) , for which the total baryon fraction is a steep function of halo mass .",
    "energy injection from bhs is able to eject gas from groups , particularly at high redshift . ]",
    "the other runs plotted in fig .  2 ( _ zcool_sf_sn _ , _ primcool_sf_sn _ , _ zcool_sf_sn_agn _ ) also include feedback processes , so determining the relative importance of cooling and feedback in producing the excess entropy is not possible based on fig .  2 alone .",
    "furthermore , we have not yet explicitly demonstrated that it is indeed the vb truncation mechanism that is responsible for the excess entropy of the hot gas in the models without feedback ( _ zcool_sf _ and _ primcool_sf _ ) . in the remainder of this section",
    "we will exploit the lagrangian nature of the  simulations to deduce which processes are most important for raising the entropy of the  in the simulations .",
    "of particular interest will be isolating the effects the agn feedback , since only _",
    "zcool_sf_sn_agn _ reproduces the observed low baryon fractions of galaxy groups ( see paper i ) .      before discussing the lagrangian entropy distributions and histories , we present fig .  3 , which shows the gas , stellar , and total baryon mass fractions within @xmath52 as a function of mass , @xmath51 , of the simulated groups in all of the runs we consider in the present study .",
    "this figure is useful for the interpretation of the results presented below and will be referred to frequently .      in fig .",
    "4 we plot the @xmath18 sorted gas entropy as a function of the included gas mass fraction for the _ nocool _ , _ primcool_sf _ and _ zcool_sf _ runs .",
    "the sorted entropy is calculated for each group by ordering the hot ( @xmath69 k ) gas particles within @xmath52 by their entropies and calculating the total mass of gas , @xmath70 , with entropy lower than @xmath6 .",
    "the motivation for examining @xmath71 , rather than @xmath72 , is that cooling modifies @xmath71 in a very simple way : it selectively removes the gas with entropy lower than the cooling threshold ( see vb ; see also below ) . the resulting radial entropy distribution , by contrast , depends not only on the resulting entropy , but also on the depth of the gravitational potential well , since the gas will tend to re - establish hydrostatic and convective equilibrium . for this reason ,",
    "it is conceptually much easier to deduce the effects of cooling on the  using the sorted gas entropy as a function of the included gas mass fraction .",

    "eventually , by @xmath94 all of the low entropy gas is converted into stars ( see dot - dashed green curve ) .",
    "the entropy history of the remaining hot gas then becomes very similar to that represented by the solid red curve , since these are now almost identical sets of particles .",
    "all of the above information was gleaned from an analysis of the entropy history alone , but it is worthwhile to briefly consider the density and temperature histories as well . in the middle and bottom panels of fig .",
    "5 we see that gas that is destined to constitute the  in the _ zcool_sf _ run ( solid red ) is typically cooler ( at least until recently ) and less dense than that which will constitute the  in the _ nocool _ run ( solid blue ) . given the similarity of the entropy histories of the two runs until @xmath33 , this suggests the  in the _ nocool _ run was , on average , compressed ( adiabatically ) more strongly at early times , presumably because it was typically located deeper within the potential wells of small haloes .",
    "gas that is destined to constitute the  in the _ zcool_sf _ run , by contrast , is that which preferentially avoided significant cooling due to its lower density , presumably because it was located more on the periphery of overdensities at early times .",
    "this is confirmed by examining the dashed blue curve .",
    "it is also worth pointing out that , had we focused on the density and/or temperature alone without consideration for the entropy , we might have reasonably ( but wrongly ) deduced that cooling was directly important at very early times ( @xmath92 ) , since the densities and temperatures of the gas in the two runs differ at that time .",
    "however , the similarity of the entropies of the gas demonstrates that this is due purely to differences in the ( adiabatic ) compression of the gas at early times .",
    "we have also examined the thermal history of the other run without feedback ( _ primcool_sf _ ) and find that it is very similar to that of _ zcool_sf _ and confirms the above conclusions .          in section 3.2",
    "we demonstrated that in runs without feedback the excess entropy at intermediate radii is largely a consequence of the selective removal of low entropy gas due to cooling and star formation .",
    "runs that include sn feedback also show evidence for excess entropy relative to the self - similar model ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , but it is not immediately obvious in this case whether it is cooling / star formation or sn heating ( or both ) that is responsible for the extra entropy . a comparison of the thermal history of the groups in runs with sn feedback with that of _ nocool _ can resolve this issue .    in fig .",
    "6 we show the median entropy , density , and temperature histories for galaxy groups in the mass range @xmath49 .",
    "the solid blue and red curves represent _ nocool _ and _ zcool_sf_sn _ , respectively .",
    "focusing first on the entropy ( top panel ) , at the present day ( @xmath18 ) there is approximately a factor of @xmath37 difference between the medians in the two runs .",
    "this is smaller than the difference we found between _ nocool _ and _ zcool_sf _ ( fig .",
    "this is already a clue that the addition of sn feedback does not significantly raise the entropy of the igrm .    selecting from _ nocool _ only those particles which end up being hot and within @xmath52 in _ zcool_sf_sn _ ( dashed blue curve )",
    ", we see a remarkably similar thermal history to this same particle population in _ zcool_sf_sn _ ( solid red curve ) .",

    "zcool_sf_sn_.    as in the case of the runs without sn feedback , we thus find that the primary cause of excess entropy in _",
    "zcool_sf_sn _ is the selective removal of low entropy gas . as already noted , the amount of excess entropy in this run is smaller than for runs without feedback .",
    "in addition , the stellar fraction in this run , @xmath95 , is smaller than that for the runs without sn feedback ( @xmath96 for _ zcool_sf _ ; see fig .  3 ) . the role that sn feedback plays ,",
    "therefore , is to prevent some of the low entropy gas from turning into cold gas / stars which implies that the entropy distribution is not truncated to the same degree as in the runs with no effective feedback .",
    "consequently , the entropy of the  is not raised by the same amount . and",
    "feedback from sn - driven winds does not significantly heat the igrm .",
    "it is worth noting here that since the sn feedback is implemented in kinetic form in the  simulations ( see dalla vecchia & schaye 2008 ) , it does not suffer from the standard problem associated with most thermal implementations of sn feedback ; i.e. , that the gas radiates away its gained energy almost immediately .",
    "the density and temperature histories yield a similar story to what we found by analysing the runs with no feedback ; i.e. , the gas that constitutes the  at the present - day in the _ zcool_sf_sn _ run is that which escaped significant cooling because it was of lower density and temperature at early times .",
    "again , this is presumably because it was located in the outskirts of haloes at early times .",
    "the thermal history of the other run with sn feedback we consider ( i.e. , _ primcool_sf_sn _ ) is very similar to that of _ zcool_sf_sn _ , in the sense that sn feedback does not noticeably raise the entropy of the igrm .",
    "instead , it acts primarily to prevent some of the lowest entropy gas from turning into stars / cold gas .",
    "however , the lack of metal - line cooling in this run greatly reduces the fraction of baryons converted into stars , resulting in a smaller truncation of the entropy distribution and entropy profiles that clearly are at odds with observations ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "implies that agn feedback has significantly heated gas which did not end up in groups in _ zcool_sf_sn_agn _ but did in _ nocool _ ( i.e. , ejected gas ) . ]",
    "the  runs we have investigated so far , particularly those which include the important process of metal - line cooling , produce galaxy group stellar mass fractions that are much larger than observed .",
    "in particular , current estimates suggest that @xmath97 is between 0.1 - 0.2 @xmath76 for nearby groups ( lin & mohr 2004 ; balogh et al .",
    "2008 ; mcgee & balogh 2010 ) , depending on what fraction of the total light is assumed to be in a diffuse component ( see , e.g. , gonzalez et al .  2007 ; mcgee & balogh 2010 ) .",
    "this implies that _ zcool_sf_sn _ and _ zcool_sf _ have too high stellar mass fractions by factors of @xmath98 3 and 4 , respectively ( see fig .",
    "this is the so - called ` cooling crisis ' of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations that invoke inefficient feedback ( e.g. , balogh et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "based on the above results , any simulation that has too high a stellar mass fraction will overestimate the degree to which the entropy of the  will be raised by cooling / star formation , because it overestimates the degree to which the self - similar entropy distribution has been truncated .",
    "it is interesting to note that of the runs we have examined so far , the only ones with excess entropy comparable to what is observed ( _ zcool_sf _ , _ primcool_sf _ , _ zcool_sf_sn _ ) significantly violate the observed stellar mass fraction of groups .",
    "it is also interesting that while the model that includes sn feedback but calculates cooling rates assuming primordial abundances ( _ primcool_sf_sn _ ) , predicts a stellar mass fraction only slightly larger than observed , the predicted entropy is much lower than observed .",
    "it therefore does not appear possible to simultaneously match the observed thermal properties of the  and the observed stellar mass fractions of groups in the context of a model where the entropy is `` raised '' ( by truncation of low entropy gas ) via cooling / star formation alone .",
    "this likely indicates that some form of highly efficient feedback ( in terms of raising the entropy ) is required in order to explain the excess entropy and stellar mass fractions of galaxy groups simultaneously .",
    "we demonstrated in paper i that model _",
    "zcool_sf_sn_agn _ , which includes agn feedback , yields the correct stellar mass fraction and entropy distribution for the  as a function of halo mass , in addition to matching a wide range of additional properties . what is the physical process that sets the entropy distribution of the  in this model ? four possible scenarios are as follows :",
    "* bh feedback raises the entropy of the gas which , in turn , increases its cooling time and reduces its star formation efficiency .",
    "since the peak of the star formation ( and presumably bh formation ) history of the universe occurs at @xmath99 , and present - day groups contain most of the galaxies , this scenario would imply that the excess entropy was generated at high redshift , well before the formation of the igrm .",
    "this is another way of saying the  was ` preheated ' ( e.g. , kaiser 1991 ; evrard & henry 1991 ) . *",
    "a second possibility is that the entropy was raised much more recently through direct heating by bhs . *",
    "a third possibility is that bh feedback targets only the lowest entropy / shortest cooling time gas for feedback , ejecting it from the low - mass progenitors of present - day groups , while leaving the long cooling time gas unaltered ( i.e. , the long cooling time gas ends up forming the present - day igrm ) .",
    "here we do not distinguish whether the low entropy gas was first heated and then buoyantly floated out of the system or if it was launched balistically ( i.e. , given a large velocity kick ) from the system .",
    "but note the entropy gain / velocity kick must be sufficiently large so that the gas is not re - accreted as the group halo grows",
    ". some tuning of this mechanism is needed , as the gas _ is _ recaptured by massive clusters ( i.e. , their baryon fractions are near the universal value ) . *",
    "low entropy gas is ejected from present - day groups , as proposed recently by b08 . to be more accurate , b08 actually allowed for ejection from the low mass - progenitors of groups as well . however",
    ", this gas is re - accreted by the group at late times if the energy imparted to the gas is less than the binding energy of the present - day group .",
    "therefore , the energetics required to eject the gas are set by the depth of the potential well of the group at @xmath18 , which is why we refer to b08 as a ` present - day ejection ' model .",
    "the last two scenarios differ from the first two in that the excess entropy in groups is not achieved by heating of the  but instead by the removal of the lowest entropy gas , as proposed by vb , modulo that the truncation results from the combination of cooling / star formation and ejection .",
    "an examination of the thermal history of _ zcool_sf_sn_agn _ can distinguish between these four proposed scenarios ( i.e. , early heating , late heating , early ejection , and late ejection , respectively ) . in fig .",

    "the solid blue and red curves represent _ nocool _ and _ zcool_sf_sn_agn _ , respectively .",

    "we discuss below whether or not this is a coincidence .",

    "this is somewhat surprising as it indicates that _ feedback from supermassive bhs has not substantially raised the entropy of gas that ends up constituting the igrm _ in the run with agn feedback .",
    "this immediately rules out the first two scenarios we outlined above , which are based on the idea that the excess entropy in groups is a result of heating of the gas that ends up in the igrm .",
    "of course , some amount of gas could have been heated significantly by agn feedback and , as a result , ended up outside of @xmath52 in _ zcool_sf_sn_agn_. indeed , the reduced baryon fractions of groups in the _",
    "zcool_sf_sn_agn _ run relative to the universal value ( see fig .  3 ) already indicates that this is the case .",

    "zcool_sf_sn_agn _ that end up hot and within groups in _ nocool _ ) from the solid red curve ( gas that ends up hot and in groups in _ zcool_sf_sn_agn _ ) at @xmath33 .",
    "bh feedback has therefore raised the entropy of some of the gas that would have ended up in groups if not for this boost .",
    "this is contrary to what we found for the runs with only sn feedback ( see fig .",
    "6 ) .    thus , the way in which the entropy of the  is raised by feedback from bhs is not by heating of gas destined to end up in groups , but instead by ejecting low entropy gas at early times .",

    "this indicates that feedback from bhs is unimportant prior to @xmath110 . however , over a relatively small range of redshift ( @xmath111 ) , we see a sharp departure of the ejected gas from the gas destined to constitute the igrm , indicating that agn feedback is very important during this time .",
    "this behaviour is what we naively expect given the mass accretion rate history of the model ( see fig .  7 of booth & schaye 2009 , which shows that the bhs gain most of their mass between @xmath112 and @xmath113 ) .",
    "observationally , this is the epoch when the quasar luminosity function peaks , and the energy injection rate is proportional to the luminosity .",

    "note that the time period over which the heating / ejection occurs also corresponds to the peak of the star formation rate density of the universe for this run ( see booth & schaye 2009 ) , indicating that there is a strong correlation between bh growth and star formation in the simulation , as is also observed ( e.g. , boyle & terlevich 1998 ; kauffmann et al .",
    "2003 ; hring & rix 2004 ) . indeed , this is presumably the reason why the simulation reproduces the @xmath18 black hole mass - stellar mass relation .",
    "the ordering of the curves in the right panel of fig .",
    "11 is also very interesting .",
    "it indicates that the lowest entropy gas is the first to be ejected and ultimately ends up gaining the most entropy .",
    "this is consistent with the expectation that the gas that is ejected early on is able to travel further away from the group by @xmath18 and will therefore have acquired more entropy through weak shocking as it interacts with the intergalactic medium .      to more clearly demonstrate the effect of bh feedback on gas that did not end up in groups in _",

    "zcool_sf _ , which has no feedback .",
    "this can only mean that the gas that ends up constituting the  in _ zcool_sf_sn_agn _ has not been significantly heated by bh feedback , as discussed in section 3.4 .",
    "by contrast , the distribution of entropy magnifications for particles that end up _ outside _ groups in _ zcool_sf_sn_agn _ ( i.e. , ejected gas ) is shifted away from the other curves , implying that the gas has been strongly heated on average , and the distribution is skewed to higher ratios ( i.e. , a larger fraction of the particles have very high entropy ratios ) .",
    "typically , the entropy of an ejected gas particle in the run with agn feedback has had its entropy raised by a factor of @xmath114 over that in _ nocool _ , although many ejected particles receive boosts of up to @xmath115 times ( and higher ) .",
    "was the gas heated abruptly or gradually over time ?",
    "until now we have focused only on _ median _ entropy histories , which is the typical gas particle entropy as a function of time .",
    "the advantage of the median is that it gives an indication of what the population of particles as a whole is doing .",
    "the disadvantage is that it effectively ` smooths ' out the histories of individual particles .",
    "thus , the median history is not particularly useful for assessing if the heating process occurs gradually or through one abrupt episode .",
    "gradual heating could happen , for example , if outflowing gas experiences numerous weak shocks from collisions with hydrostatic / inflowing gas in galaxies or with other outflowing gas ( e.g. , newly outflowing gas could catch up with gas heated earlier ) , or if the gas re - collapses and experiences weak accretion shocks .",
    "however , it is difficult to assess the importance of gradual vs.  abrupt heating based on the median history of a large sample of particles . a better approach is to look at the thermal history of individual ejected gas particles .",
    "we randomly select ejected gas particles associated with a randomly - selected galaxy group in _",
    "zcool_sf_sn_agn_. for reference , the randomly - selected group has a total mass of m@xmath116 m@xmath25 with @xmath117 k and @xmath118 kev @xmath2 .",
    "( note that we have also randomly selected other groups for comparison and find very similar results . ) .",
    "we randomly select 10 particles in several radial bins ( the same bins as adopted in the right panel of fig .",
    "11 ) . in fig .",
    "13 we show the entropy , temperature , and density histories of these particles in three of the radial bins ( see caption ) .",
    "examining first the entropy histories ( top panels ) we see that , broadly speaking , the particles may be broken up into two classes : one where the entropy rises gradually , similar to ( but in excess of ) the gas destined to form the  ( i.e. , @xmath119 ; thick dashed black curve ) , and another where the entropy first drops before being abruptly raised to nearly its final value .",
    "the physical interpretation of the latter population is simple : it represents gas that significantly cooled ( radiatively ) and collapsed to the centre of its halo before being directly heated by a supermassive bh .",
    "we note that the entropy jump experienced by this gas ( often @xmath120 orders of magnitude ) is about what we would expect given that this gas cooled down to @xmath121 k ( see bottom panels ) before being heated orders of magnitude , rather than 4 , which would appear to be inconsistent with the entropy jump . however , we note that the time scale for a single hot particle to cool adiabatically by free expansion is @xmath122 , where @xmath15 is the sph kernel length @xmath123 $ ] ( where @xmath124 and @xmath125 are the gas particle mass and density ) and @xmath126 the sound speed . for groups with @xmath126 of a few hundred kilometers per second , this timescale is short compared to the interval between snapshots .",
    "thus , we expect directly - heated gas particles to cool due to adiabatic expansion",
    ". however , this kind of expansion does not affect the entropy .",
    "] by @xmath44 k ( see section 2.1 ) . some additional entropy generation occurs after the direct heating episode , which is likely due to weak shocks experienced by the gas as it flows outward .    in order to determine the nature of the heating of the class of particles",
    "whose entropy increases much more gradually with time ( but still in excess of the gas that ends up in the group ) , one needs to also examine the density and temperature histories . for this class of particles ,",
    "most of the entropy production occurs between @xmath127 . over this time period",
    "the density of these particles is typically slightly decreasing with time towards the present day .",
    "this indicates that the gas is outflowing and , as it does so , is experiencing numerous weak shocks .",
    "in fact , it is likely the gas is outflowing _ because _ it has experienced weak shocks , from collisions with rapidly outflowing directly - heated gas .",
    "that the outflowing , directly - heated gas shock heats other gas leading to further ejection can also be arrived at through other considerations . in particular , the mass of directly - heated gas ( @xmath128 ) is given by    @xmath129 \\",

    ", we find that the total mass of bhs within @xmath52 is @xmath132 m@xmath53 . filling in the other numbers yields the approximate scaling between the heated gas mass and the group mass :    @xmath133    one can compare this estimate of the directly - heated mass of gas with the typical mass of ejected gas ( see fig .  8) , which approximately scales with @xmath51 as    @xmath134 + 0.46 )   \\ \\ \\ .\\ ] ]    therefore , at our median mass of @xmath135 the ratio of ejected to directly - heated gas mass is @xmath136 .",
    "this indicates that the directly - heated gas is able to heat neighbouring low - density gas , leading to additional mass outflow . but note this process becomes less effective with increasing group mass .",
    "for example , for the randomly - selected group studied in fig .",
    "13 , which has a mass of @xmath137 , the expected ratio of ejected to directly - heated gas mass is @xmath138 .",
    "this ratio is approximately consistent with the fraction of particles that experience large entropy jumps in fig .  13 , confirming our hypothesis that these particles have been directly heated by the agn .      one of the main motivations for the  project is to quantify the effects of varying subgrid physics in the simulations .",
    "this is done by varying the parameters of a given subgrid physics module , or by switching on / off the various modules one at a time . in a future paper",
    "we will present a detailed comparison of groups from all of the @xmath139  runs , which , among other things , vary the parameters of the prescriptions for stellar populations , chemodynamics , radiative cooling , and sn and agn feedback .",
    "for the purposes of the present study , however , it is worth briefly discussing the sensitivity of our results / conclusions to parameter variations for our implementation of agn feedback ( see booth & schaye 2009 for a detailed description of the model ) .",
    "as already noted in section 2.1 , a certain fraction of the rest mass energy of accreted gas , @xmath40 , is used to heat a number of randomly - selected neighbouring gas particles . through systematic variation , booth & schaye ( 2009 ) found that a value of @xmath140 reproduces the local relations between bh mass and stellar mass and velocity dispersion , as well as the @xmath18 cosmic bh density .",
    "we therefore decided to leave @xmath40 fixed at this value .",
    "bhs in the simulation store up this accreted ` feedback energy ' until it is sufficient to raise the temperature of @xmath41 gas particles by @xmath42 .",
    "we have explored the effects of varying these two parameters on the properties of the igrm . in particular ,",
    "we have tried varying @xmath41 at fixed @xmath141 and @xmath42 at fixed @xmath41 , as well as fixing the product @xmath142 ( which implies a fixed level of energy injection per feedback episode ) while varying both parameters .",
    "we find that the results are quite insensitive to variations in @xmath143 at fixed @xmath42 , but are somewhat sensitive to variations in @xmath42 at fixed @xmath41 .",
    "this is not unexpected , since if @xmath42 is set to values that are comparable to , or smaller than , the temperature of the local ambient hot medium , the heating will be inefficient .",
    "this is because the gas is heated at fixed density , implying @xmath144 , so that a small fractional change in temperature corresponds to a small fractional change in entropy .    in terms of the _ median _ entropy of the igrm",
    ", we find that the result is insensitive to the exact value of @xmath42 so long as it is sufficiently high to expel gas from _ the low - mass progenitors _ of galaxy groups . as we have shown above",
    ", it is the ejection of gas from these high - z systems that yields the required truncation of the entropy distribution . to give one specific example",
    ", we found very similar median  entropies ( compared to _ zcool_sf_sn_agn _ , which uses @xmath44 k and @xmath45 ) for a run with @xmath145 k and @xmath146 .",
    "note , however , that in this case @xmath42 is comparable to the virial temperature of the @xmath18 groups we are studying .",
    "the argument presented above therefore implies that heating will be ineffective in these haloes today , and indeed we find that the entropy at the centers of the groups is lower than observed ( even though the median entropies of the groups remain similar to what is observed ) . in other words , decreasing @xmath42 to this level results in a pile - up of low entropy gas , since the entropy added to the gas by agn is not sufficient for the gas to rise buoyantly out of the group core .",
    "the upshot of the above is that as long as the agn is ` able to do something ' ( i.e. , the injected energy is not immediately radiated away ) , it tends to yield the same  properties , independent of the exact choice for the values of the parameters of the model .",
    "in paper i we demonstrated that the _ zcool_sf_sn_agn _ run that is part of the large  suite of simulations ( schaye et al .",
    "2010 ) simultaneously reproduces an impressively wide range of x - ray and optical properties of groups , including the entropy , temperature , and metallicity distributions and their dependence on halo mass , as well as the stellar mass of the group and the central brightest galaxy ( cbg ) and the stellar age of the cbg ( see also sijacki et al .",
    "2007 ; puchwein et al .",
    "2008 ; fabjan et al .",
    "2010 , who also find improved agreement with the data when agn feedback is included in their simulations ) . in the present study",
    "we have used a number of additional  runs ( including the effectively non - radiative and no feedback runs _ nocool _ and _ zcool_sf _ , respectively ) to deduce exactly how the  entropy is raised in the _",
    "zcool_sf_sn_agn _ run .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , we find that none of the previously proposed mechanisms for raising the entropy of the  are a good description of what happens in the simulation .",
    "the excess entropy of the gas within groups today is _ not _ the result of heating of that gas . on the contrary",
    ", we find that the gas within groups today is that which preferentially avoided strong heating by bh feedback .",
    "instead , we find that the excess entropy is the result of selectively removing the lowest entropy from the system by star formation and , much more importantly , by the ejection of gas from low - mass progenitor haloes , particularly over the redshift range @xmath147 ( see fig .",
    "the idea of selective removal of low entropy material as a mechanism for raising the entropy of the  goes back to the studies of vb .",
    "originally , these authors envisaged that the lowest entropy material would end up forming stars [ although voit & bryan ( 2001 ) and voit et al .",
    "( 2002 ) did note the possibility that extreme heating could also remove the lowest entropy gas ] .",
    "however , it is now clear that in order to reproduce the observed excess entropy via cooling / star formation alone , an unacceptably large fraction of the gas would need to be converted to stars .",
    "bower et al .",
    "( 2008 ; hereafter b08 ) proposed a simple modification of the vb truncation mechanism , in which bh feedback specifically targets the lowest entropy gas . in this way",
    ", the entropy of the  is still raised by the removal of the lowest entropy gas while allowing the possibility of retaining reasonable stellar mass fractions .",
    "indeed , b08 implemented this simple modification of the vb mechanism into the durham galform semi - analytic model of galaxy formation and showed that it can yield simultaneous matches to the mean thermal properties of the  and to the stellar content of group galaxies .    while our detailed cosmological hydrodynamic simulations also show that the primary mechanism for generating excess entropy in groups is through ejection of low entropy gas , the way in which this happens differs from that proposed by b08 .",
    "in particular , b08 ( see also bower et al .",
    "2006 ) implemented a prescription for ` radio mode ' agn feedback which becomes effective in high mass systems where quasi - hydrostatic gaseous atmospheres can develop . in their model ejection",
    "only occurs if the energy imparted to the gas exceeds the gravitational binding energy of the present - day group .",
    "consequently , the energy required to eject the gas is substantial ( see b08 for further discussion ) .",
    "by contrast , in our simulation the ejection occurs at high redshift when the low entropy gas is located in the shallower potential wells of the low - mass progenitors of groups .",
    "consequently , the energy required to eject the gas is lower than that required by the model of b08 .",
    "the ejection in our simulations occurs during the phase when the black hole accretion rate is close to eddington limited . in other words",
    ", we find that it is ` quasar mode ' agn feedback ( as opposed to ` radio mode ' ) that is responsible for raising the entropy of the  over and above that due to gravitational shock heating .    in the present study we have",
    "of course not explored the full range of conceivable agn feedback models .",
    "the simulations are therefore not guaranteed to capture the physics of agn feedback correctly .",
    "however , we are encouraged by the fact that the model simultaneously reproduces a wide range range of global and structural x - ray / optical properties of galaxy groups ( see paper i ) with virtually no tuning of the model parameters ( in terms of agn feedback , only the efficiency of feedback was tuned so that the simulations reproduce the normalization of the local black hole scaling relations ; see booth & schaye 2009 ) . a direct test of the model will be to search for outflows at high redshift to confirm their existence and validate the model .",
    "indeed , there are already signs that such ` quasar mode ' outflows are operating both at low and high redshift ( see , e.g. , moe et al .  2009 ; dunn et al .",
    "2010 ; tombesi et al .  2010a , b ; feruglio et al .",
    "2010 ; raimundo et al .",
    "2010 ) . determining how common these outflows are and",
    "what their typical properties are ( i.e. , whether they are ejecting sufficient mass on average to explain the overall entropy and baryon mass fractions of local groups ) will be key .",
    "how realistic is the current implementation of agn feedback given our existing knowledge of real quasar - driven outflows ?",
    "recent observations suggest outflow velocities up to a significant fraction of the speed of light on very small scales ( @xmath148 pc ; e.g. , tombesi et al .",
    "of course there is no hope of being able to resolve such tiny scales in cosmological simulations at present .",
    "however , the hot , outflowing gas will expand and cool adiabatically and as long as : i ) the simulations capture the outflow when the velocities are still supersonic with respect to the the igrm ; and , ii ) the cooling time of the shocked gas is large ; then the simulations should retrieve approximately the same result for a fixed amount of energy . in this respect ,",
    "an important parameter of the model is @xmath42 .",
    "if @xmath149 , then heating will be inefficient ( i.e. , it violates the second condition ) , which changes the physics and the results will be sensitive to the exact value @xmath42 ( see section 4.4 for further discussion ) .",
    "this is the reason why we have adopted a ` high ' value for @xmath42 - it guarantees efficient feedback on the scale of groups ( but note that this choice in no way guarantees that the simulations will reproduce the observations ) .",
    "another possible way to test the model may be through observations of cosmic rays ( crs ) , since the agn feedback results in some very strong shocks , with mach numbers approaching @xmath115 ( see fig .",
    "this may result in the production of crs , but whether or not this will be easily distinguishable from crs produced in shocks driven by sne and mergers ( e.g. , pfrommer et al .  2007 ) will require further detailed modelling .",
    "it is worth briefly commenting on the suitability of the sph formalism to the problem at hand .",
    "since sph by its nature will smooth out shocks , can we be confident that the rate of shock heating in the simulations is correct ?",
    "we have verified that a version of the agn model run with 8 times lower mass resolution ( 2 times lower spatial resolution ) yields remarkably similar entropy distributions for the igrm . also , as long as the radiative cooling time in the post - shock gas is long",
    ", the correct result should be obtained , since the energy is conserved and the gas will expand in both cases ( i.e. , in a real shock and in a sph shock ) .",
    "the implementation of agn feedback in our simulations guarantees that the post - shock gas has a long cooling time .",
    "it is interesting to ask the question whether only agn feedback is capable of ` raising ' the entropy of the  to the observed level .",
    "for example , perhaps an alternative implementation of sn feedback in the simulations could achieve a similar result .",
    "we find that it is difficult to rule out this possibility based on energy arguments alone .",
    "we have calculated the total energy injected by bhs within @xmath52 in our simulation as @xmath150 m_{\\rm bh } ( < r_{500 } ) c^2 $ ] , where @xmath151 and @xmath152 are the radiative efficiency of the bh accretion disk and the fraction of emitted energy assumed to couple to the gas and @xmath153 is the total mass of bhs within @xmath52 .",
    "this yields a typical total injection energy of a few @xmath154 ergs , or approximately 1 - 2 kev per particle , assuming @xmath155 .",
    "the maximum amount of energy available from sne is estimated as follows .",
    "we sum the _ initial _",
    "( i.e. , ignoring stellar mass loss ) stellar mass of star particles within @xmath52 in _ zcool_sf_sn_agn _ ( which reproduces the @xmath18 stellar mass fractions of observed groups , see paper i ) .",
    "assuming a chabrier imf , we calculate the number of stars in the mass range @xmath156 , all of which are assumed to yield core - collapse sne .",
    "finally , the energy per sn is assumed to be @xmath157 ergs .",
    "typically , we find that the energy available from sne is @xmath158 times that injected by bhs in our simulation ( note , however , that the _ maximum _ amount of energy that can be injected by bhs is an order of magnitude larger , but that the adopted bh efficiency was tuned to match the normalisation of the @xmath18 bh scaling relations - see booth & schaye 2009 ) .",
    "similar results are obtained if we use @xmath159 as our limiting radius , rather than @xmath52 .    energetically , therefore , the contribution from sne is significant .",
    "however , whether or not sne can significantly raise the entropy of the depends on the importance of radiative losses .",
    "since the energy injected by sne will likely be much more spatially - distributed than that by bhs , one expects radiative losses to be more important for the former .",
    "indeed , this is the reason why _",
    "zcool_sf_sn _ yields much higher stellar mass fractions and lower  entropies than _ zcool_sf_sn_agn _ in the present study .",
    "we also note that _ none _ of the many variations of the sn - driven feedback model parameters explored as part of the  project yield group properties that are similar to _ zcool_sf_sn_agn _ ( this will be presented in detail in a future paper ) .",
    "a wide range of implementations of sn - driven feedback have been explored in previous studies and similar conclusions have been drawn ( e.g. , thacker & couchman 2000 ; borgani et al .",
    "2002 , 2004 ; kay et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "two notable exceptions are kay ( 2004 ) and dav et al .",
    "dav et al .",
    "( 2008 ) implemented a stellar feedback model in which the initial wind mass loading and velocity scale with halo properties as expected on larger scales for outflows driven by radiation pressure from massive stars on dust grains .",
    "they found groups with stellar mass fractions that are similar to the observed mass fractions .",
    "it is worth noting , however , that the normalisation of their feedback prescription was treated as a free parameter and that the amounts of energy and momentum injected in their outflows both far exceed those available from star formation .",
    "kay ( 2004 ) showed that if the energy injected by sne is highly - targeted ( i.e. , deposited in a very small amount of gas ) and raises the entropy of the gas to a very high level ( he adopted 1000 kev @xmath2 ) , it can yield group properties in reasonable agreement with observations .",
    "this result is interesting because in this case the sne ` behave ' much like agn .",
    "the downside of this approach is that one must fine - tune the parameters of the sn feedback model to achieve a result that comes about naturally from a model that includes bh growth and agn feedback .    in the present study",
    "we have concerned ourselves with the establishment of only the global ( median ) properties of the  and found that quasar mode agn feedback is the dominant mechanism for raising the overall entropy of the gas .",
    "however , this statement does not imply that sn feedback or radio mode agn feedback are unimportant .",
    "as we have already discussed in section 3.3 , sn feedback prevents star formation in high - z galaxies .",
    "this gas ends up as part of the  but it has not been heated to such an extent that it modifies the _ median _ entropy of the hot gas . low accretion rate ( i.e. , radio mode ) agn feedback is likely important at late times to prevent the development of cooling flows .",
    "but it should be kept in mind that by mass the gas within the cooling radius ( where the radio mode heating tends to be targeted ) represents only about 10 - 20% of the total .",
    "it is therefore difficult for radio mode feedback to affect the _ global _ properties of the gas , which is necessary in order to match observations of groups [ see also the recent study of fontanot et al .",
    "( 2010 ) who find that semi - analytic models that invoke radio mode only , and whose parameters have been adjusted to reproduce the galaxy population , tend to greatly overproduce the observed radio emission ] .    finally",
    ", we have focused on the global thermal properties of the hot gas in groups and low - mass clusters .",
    "however , more massive galaxy clusters also show evidence for excess entropy , at least in the central regions ( see , e.g. , pratt et al .",
    "at present , it is widely believed that this excess entropy is due to agn radio mode feedback [ in ` cool core ' ( cc ) clusters ] or cluster - cluster mergers [ in ` non - cool core ' ( ncc ) clusters ] .",
    "however , there are problems with both of these explanations . in the case of radio mode feedback in cc clusters , while there may be sufficient energy to offset radiative cooling losses ( e.g. , dunn & fabian 2008 ) , there does not appear to be sufficient energy to explain how these systems obtained their high entropies in the first place if the heating occurred via radio mode after cluster formation ( mccarthy et al .  2008 ; ncc clusters can not be explained in this way either ) . as for mergers being an explanation for ncc clusters ,",
    "poole et al .",
    "( 2006 , 2008 ) used high - resolution sph simulations of cluster mergers to show that the dense , low entropy gas in the cores of clusters is generally robust to mergers ( although see mitchell et al .",
    "2009 and zuhone 2010 who argued that sph simulations may underestimate the degree of mixing during mergers ) . in any case , the physical origin of the high entropy in clusters ( and its scatter ) is still very much an open question .",
    "agn feedback at high redshift ( in quasar mode ) may provide an alternative explanation for the excess entropy of the icm in both cc and ncc clusters . naively one might rule the quasar mode hypothesis out by noting that bhs are not sufficiently energetic to eject gas from the most massive systems ( which our simulations confirm ; see fig .  3 ) .",
    "however , we note that , unlike groups , the excess entropy in clusters is confined to relatively small radii ( the gas at intermediate / large radii is described well by the self - similar model ) . thus , to explain the excess entropy in clusters the gas may not have to be ejected to beyond the virial radius .",
    "heating it at high redshift so that it ends up at intermediate / large radii may be sufficient .",
