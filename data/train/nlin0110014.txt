    "in this letter we shall introduce new mechanical models obeying the poincar algebra @xmath0 here @xmath1 will be the hamiltonian of the system generating time - translations , @xmath2 is a space - translation generator and @xmath3 the generator of boosts .",
    "the investigation of such models was initiated by ruijsenaars and schneider @xcite .",
    "the models they discovered were found to posses other nice features : they were in fact integrable and a quantum version of them naturally existed",
    ". we shall discuss these further features of our models below .",
    "ruijsenaars and schneider @xcite began with the ansatz @xmath4 and @xmath5 with this ansatz and the canonical poisson bracket @xmath6 the first two poisson brackets of ( [ poincare ] ) involving the boost operator @xmath3 are automatically satisfied .",
    "the remaining poisson bracket is then @xmath7 and for the independent terms proportional to @xmath8 to vanish we require that @xmath9 be odd .",
    "this entails that @xmath10 is either even or odd . ] and in either case @xmath11 is even . supposing that @xmath10 is so constrained , then the final poisson bracket is equivalent to the functional equation @xmath12 for @xmath13 this equation may be written in the form @xmath14 where @xmath15 .",
    "ruijsenaars and schneider @xcite showed that @xmath16 satisfies ( [ detdiff ] ) and further satisfies ( [ functional ] ) for all @xmath17 . this same functional equation ( without assumptions on the parity of the function @xmath18 ) has arisen in several settings related to integrable systems . it arises when characterising quantum mechanical potentials whose ground state wavefunction ( of a given form ) is factorisable @xcite . more recently it has been shown @xcite to characterise the calogero - moser system @xcite , which is a scaling limit of the ruijsenaars - schneider system . the analytic solutions to ( [ detdiff ] ) were characterised by buchstaber and perelomov @xcite while more recently a somewhat stronger result with considerably simpler proof was obtained by the authors @xcite .",
    "one has    let f be a three - times differentiable function satisfying the functional equation ( [ detdiff ] ) .",
    "then , up to the manifest invariance @xmath19 , the solutions of ( [ detdiff ] ) are one of @xmath20 , @xmath21 or @xmath22 . here @xmath23 is the weierstrass @xmath23-function and @xmath24 is a lattice point of the @xmath23-function .",
    "thus the even solutions of ( [ detdiff ] ) are precisely those obtained by ruijsenaars and schneider . as an aside we remark that the delta function potential @xmath25 of many - body quantum mechanics on the line , which has a factorisable ground - state wavefunction , can be viewed as the @xmath26 limit of @xmath27 with @xmath28 .",
    "thus all of the known quantum mechanical problems with factorisable ground - state wavefunction are included in ( [ detdiff ] ) .",
    "there appear deep connections between functional equations and integrable systems @xcite .    at this stage",
    "all we know is that the @xmath13 solution of ruijsenaars and schneider to ( [ functional ] ) in fact yields a solution for all @xmath17",
    ". the general even solution of ( [ functional ] ) has not been given .",
    "our first new result is    the general even solution of ( [ functional ] ) amongst the class of meromorphic functions whose only singularities on the real axis are either a double pole at the origin , or double poles at @xmath29 ( @xmath30 real , @xmath31 ) is : a ) for all odd @xmath17 given by the solution of ruijsenaars and schneider whileb ) for even @xmath32 there are in addition to the ruijsenaars - schneider solutions the following : @xmath33    here @xmath34 with @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , and we have given representations in terms of the weierstrass elliptic functions , theta functions and the jacobi elliptic functions @xcite .",
    "the functions @xmath38 are elliptic functions whose periodicities and ( double ) poles are as follows : @xmath39 these functions satisfy @xmath40 ( @xmath41 respectively ) and @xmath42 are @xmath43 lam polynomials .",
    "( the remaining two @xmath43 lam polynomials are of ruijsenaars - schneider form with similarly shifted argument . ) the functions @xmath38 have the expansion @xmath44 , and if @xmath2 denotes the other pole in the fundamental region determined by its periodicity we have @xmath45 for appropriate ranges of @xmath46 the solutions are real .",
    "their degenerations yield all the even solutions with only a double pole at @xmath47 on the real axis .",
    "these degenerations may in fact coincide with the degenerations of the ruijsenaars - schneider solution .",
    "one can straightforwardly verify these new solutions do in fact satisfy ( [ functional ] ) for even @xmath17 but new techniques needed to be developed to show we have exhausted the solutions .",
    "( these will be presented elsewhere @xcite . )",
    "one method of verifying these are solutions is as follows .",
    "let @xmath48 be any one of @xmath49 , @xmath50 or @xmath51 . setting @xmath52 , with @xmath53 in ( [ functional ] ) yields @xmath54+\\\\ ( -1)\\sp{\\alpha(n-1 ) } \\big[f'(\\epsilon)\\prod_{k=1}\\sp{n-2}f(x_{n-1}+\\epsilon - x_k)+ f(\\epsilon)\\partial_{n-1}\\prod_{k=1}\\sp{n-2}f(x_{n-1}+\\epsilon - x_k)\\big]\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] for both @xmath53",
    "there are pole terms @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 as @xmath58 . when @xmath59 it is easy to see these poles vanish .",
    "for example the @xmath55 term vanishes simply from the the oddness of @xmath60 .",
    "when @xmath61 ( corresponding to the pole @xmath2 of @xmath18 ) we see we require an even number of particles .",
    "( there are other poles in this expression of the form @xmath62 , but these correspond to @xmath63 and vanish by symmetry and the above arguments . ) viewed as a function of @xmath64 we have a doubly elliptic function with no poles , thus for @xmath17 even @xmath65 is independent of @xmath64 . by symmetry",
    "this is a constant .",
    "the value of this constant may be established as zero by the following argument .",
    "set @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is any number such that @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) is not a pole of @xmath18 .",
    "consider the pairing @xmath70 . with our choice of @xmath71 then @xmath72)=f(x_{n - j}-x_{n - k})$ ] while @xmath73",
    ". using this involution we may show the terms appearing in the constant sum cancel pairwise : @xmath74 thus we obtain @xmath75 and our functions satisfy the equation .",
    "the models discovered by ruijsenaars and schneider not only exhibited an action of the poincar algebra but were completely integrable as well and we will discuss this aspect of our models . throughout",
    "we henceforth assume that @xmath76 is either even or odd as discussed earlier .",
    "following @xcite we introduce the light - cone quantities @xmath77 then @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "we investigate the poisson commutativity of these @xmath80 s .",
    "let @xmath81 and define the sets @xmath82    then @xmath83 and so on . introduce the notation @xcite @xmath84 and for disjoint sets @xmath85 set @xmath86 ( using the evenness / oddness of @xmath76 ) .",
    "thus @xmath87 .",
    "also set @xmath88 then the light - cone quantity @xmath80 becomes @xmath89 now clearly @xmath90 and @xmath91 for all @xmath92 , thus we only need focus on @xmath93 . to calculate the poisson bracket @xmath94 we must evaluate expressions of the form @xmath95\\ ] ] where @xmath96 .",

    "if either @xmath99 or @xmath3 is empty the result is understood to be vanishing .",
    "similarly @xmath100\\\\ & = ( \\pm)\\sp{(|a|+|b|)|c|+|a||b| } e^{\\theta_{i}-\\theta_{j}}\\left ( ab\\right)\\sp2 \\partial _ { c}(cd)^{2 } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now @xmath94 will vanish if and only if the coefficients of the independent @xmath101 vanish .",
    "such a term fixes the sets @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 , and the same momentum dependence appears for each subset @xmath105 with @xmath106 .",
    "the coefficient of @xmath107 in @xmath94 then vanishes provided @xmath108 therefore ( with @xmath109 ) @xmath110 for all @xmath111 satisfying @xmath112 . in particular @xmath113 and we recover ( [ functional ] ) for @xmath114 .    if we take @xmath115 the term @xmath116 is allowed in the sum leading to @xmath117 we know our new functions do not satisfy this when @xmath118 is odd .",
    "thus the conserved quantities of ruijsenaars will not poisson commute for this new model",
    ". we can not as yet rule out other poisson commuting conserved quantities . in the case of",
    "@xmath119 we note that @xmath120 , @xmath121 and @xmath122 poisson commute .",
    "we will now construct some classical hamiltonian systems from our new solutions .",
    "we begin by recalling the scaling limit of the ruijsenaars - schneider model @xcite that results in the calogero - moser model . whereas the calogero - moser models are ( completely integrable ) natural hamiltonian systems , the scaling limits we must consider have a different form .",
    "there are also analogous systems corresponding to the these scaling limits of the ruijsenaars - schneider models .",
    "let us write @xmath123 and @xmath124 , a scaling which preserves the poisson brackets @xmath125 .",
    "putting in dimensionful parameters we have @xmath126 here the parameter @xmath99 has been introduced @xcite to make the argument of the @xmath23 function dimensionless : @xmath127 , thus @xmath99 scales as @xmath128 .",
    "this scaling limit is possible because of the ( assumed ) nonzero constant that can appear in the ruijsenaars - schneider solution ( here scaled to one ) .",
    "such a constant is not present in our new solutions , and the scaling does not work if the constant in the ruijsenaars - schneider solution is zero .",
    "we shall now consider a different scaling .",
    "both the ruijsenaars systems and ours have a different type of scaling limit @xmath129 here we have introduced @xmath130 which need not be constant . in some special cases",
    "however it is .",
    "we know for example that if @xmath131 is a constant , @xmath10 is an odd function , and    1 .",
    "( [ lamdef ] ) is true for all @xmath132 then @xmath133 ( @xmath134 ) , @xmath135 ( @xmath136 for @xmath17 odd and @xmath134 for @xmath17 even ) , 2 .",
    "( [ lamdef ] ) is true for all even @xmath32 then @xmath137 ( @xmath134 ) .",
    "this type of degeneration of the ruijsenaars - schneider models does not appear to have been considered before .",
    "( the same will work with the addition of extra potentials not considered here . )",
    "the functional identities being used here also underly the various hirzebruch genera @xcite .",
    "we find for example that    the functions @xmath138 obey the algebra @xmath139 if and only @xmath10 is either an even or odd function satisfying @xmath140 where @xmath131 is a constant .",
    "in particular , the odd functions @xmath133 ( @xmath134 ) , @xmath135 ( @xmath136 for @xmath17 odd and @xmath134 for @xmath17 even ) , @xmath141 ( @xmath134 ) yield solutions .",
    "when @xmath134 this is the galilean algebra , while @xmath142 is a central extension of the galilean algebra .",
    "our new functions do not satisfy this unless we have a degeneration .",
    "interestingly , in the case of an even number of particles , particular cases of the elliptic ruijsenaars - schneider model are in this list .",
    "whatever , we can ask whether the metrics this scaling limit yield have any special significance .",
    "we are encountering models of the form @xmath143 and so dealing with diagonal metrics . we can not as yet characterise these metrics , but towards this report    the diagonal metric @xmath144 with potentially nonvanishing curvature components @xmath145 , @xmath146 ( @xmath147 ) and @xmath148 has    1 .",
    "@xmath149 ( @xmath147 ) if and only if @xmath150 or @xmath151 .",
    "we may set @xmath61 by rescaling @xmath152 .",
    "2 .   @xmath153 when @xmath154 , 3 .",
    "@xmath155 when @xmath156 .",
    "thus @xmath156 yields a solution of the lam equations .",
    "these metrics are of stckel form .",
    "the rational degenerations of our models are given by this theorem .",
    "they may be understood as a parabolic limit of jacobi elliptic coordinates . indeed , although we have investigated metrics of the form ( [ diagm ] ) because these arise from our systems , we have more generally    the diagonal metric @xmath157 has @xmath149 ( @xmath147 ) if and only if @xmath150 or @xmath151 .",
    "ruijsenaars @xcite also investigated the quantum version of the classical models he and schneider introduced . from the outset he sought operator analogues of the light - cone quantities ( [ lccons ] ) .",
    "he showed that ( for @xmath158 ) @xmath159 pairwise commute if and only if ( for all @xmath92 and @xmath160 ) @xmath161 here @xmath162 is an arbitrary positive number . upon dividing by @xmath162 and letting @xmath163 this yields ( [ gencons ] ) and in particular ( [ functional ] ) with @xmath164 .",
    "( given @xmath18 there is of course an an ambiguity in @xmath165 under @xmath166 . )",
    "ruijsenaars was able to show that @xmath167 led to a solution of ( [ qgencons ] ) , the solution being related to the earlier ruijsenaars - schneider solution via @xmath168 ruijsenaars @xcite suggested that this solution was  most likely unique \" but was unable to prove this .",
    "a consequence of our classical analysis are the possible functions @xmath164 .",
    "a natural question to ask is whether there is a solution to ( [ qgencons ] ) corresponding to our new solutions . if not",
    ", then the ruijsenaars solution is indeed unique . at present",
    "we are able to show that the ruijsenaars solution is the unique solution to ( [ qgencons ] ) with @xmath169 for @xmath170 while for general @xmath17 and those @xmath165 with infinite real period and tending to @xmath171 at infinity , the only solutions correspond to @xmath172 and @xmath173 .",
    "in particular there is no @xmath165 corresponding to our new solution @xmath174 .",
    "we anticipate being able to extend this to show that none of the new solutions can be written in the form @xmath164 with @xmath165 satisfying ( [ qgencons ] ) .",
    "in this letter we have investigated mechanical systems exhibiting an action of the poincre algebra . by adopting a given anstz",
    "this reduces to a study of the functional equation ( [ functional ] ) and we presented the general solution to this . beyond the solution of ruijsenaars and",
    "schneider new solutions are obtained .",
    "the conserved quantities of ruijsenaars and schneider do not poisson commute for these new models .",
    "although we can not as yet rule out other poisson commuting conserved quantities , our models suggest that poincre invariance and integrability are distinct requirements .",
    "a new classical limit of our models ( and the ruijsenaars - schneider model ) was discussed . here",
    "a diagonal metric of a particular type arises .",
    "the rational degenerations of these models satisfy the lam equations and indeed are the only ones within our class of metrics that do .",
    "finally we have considered the quantum mechanical version of our new models . while not complete",
    ", we can show for @xmath170 that the only solutions to ruijsenaars functional equations ( [ qgencons ] ) are those given by ruijsenaars and schneider , and that for general @xmath17 the degenerations of our new models , where distinct from the ruijsenaars solutions , fail to yield a solution .",
    "our new techniques suggest a proof of the uniqueness of the ruijsenaars solution is now within reach , and this will be pursued elsewhere .",
