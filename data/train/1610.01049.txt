    "quantum field theory on curved backgrounds is nowadays a well - established , thriving branch of mathematical and theoretical physics . in the past decade ,",
    "especially thanks to the algebraic approach @xcite , not only several specific models , including those with perturbative interactions , were thoroughly studied , but also foundational and structural aspects , such as renormalization or local gauge invariance , were analysed .    a cornerstone of most part of the recent papers is the assumption that the underlying background is globally hyperbolic .",
    "this condition on the geometry of the spacetime guarantees that solutions to wave like operators , such as the klein - gordon , the dirac or the proca equation , can be found in terms of an initial value problem . as a consequence ,",
    "whenever one considers a free field theory , one can follow a well - established quantization scheme , to associate to any such systems an algebra of observables , encompassing the information on structural properties such as dynamics , locality and causality .",
    "the only choice consists in the selection of a quantum state , but , also in this respect , it is nowadays universally accepted that a physically acceptable criterion lies in the so - called hadamard condition .",
    "this is a technical requirement which guarantees on the one hand that the singular behaviour of the two - point function @xmath2 of the underlying free field theory mimics in the ultraviolet regime that of the poincar vacuum , while , on the other hand , that the quantum fluctuations of all observables are finite , @xcite and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ch . 5 ) . as a consequence one can give a covariant definition of wick polynomials , extending the standard one on minkowski spacetime , and , as a by - product",
    ", interactions can be introduced at a perturbative level . in other words , if one focuses the attention on quasi - free / gaussian states , selecting a physically acceptable state boils down to the construction of a positive , two - point function @xmath2 .",
    "this is a solution of the equation of motion in both entries , with a prescribed singular behaviour .",
    "the most famous examples of hadamard states are the poincar vacuum and the bunch - davies state on de sitter spacetime @xcite , but several construction schemes are nowadays known , especially on black hole @xcite and cosmological spacetimes @xcite .",
    "the situation changes drastically the moment we drop the assumption of the spacetime being globally hyperbolic . already at a classical level",
    "we face additional difficulties since we can not construct and characterize the solutions of the equation of motion just in terms of an initial value problem .",
    "it is therefore tempting to take the easy path of concluding that these scenarios are not of interest since they bear no physical information .",
    "this attitude is not justified as there are renown , experimentally verified effects , e.g.  the casimir force , which are described by field theoretical models whose underlying geometry is not that of a globally hyperbolic spacetime , since the manifold possesses boundaries @xcite .",
    "another relevant instance of a manifold which is not globally hyperbolic , while being central in several , important physical models is the @xmath1-dimensional anti de sitter @xmath3 spacetime , @xmath4 .",
    "this is a maximally symmetric solution of the vacuum einstein equations with a negative cosmological constant @xmath5 whose underlying manifold @xmath6 is such that the time coordinates runs along @xmath7 , hence yielding closed timelike curves @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we will focus on this class of backgrounds , more precisely on the so - called poincar fundamental domain @xmath0 which covers only a portion of the full @xmath3 spacetime and which is extensively used in the prominent ads / cft correspondence  see for example the recent monograph @xcite .",
    "contrary to @xmath3 , @xmath0 can be described as the subset @xmath8 of @xmath9 endowed with the metric @xmath10 , @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and where @xmath13 are standard cartesian coordinates with @xmath14 ranging only over the half line .",
    "one can realize per direct inspection that we can attach to @xmath0 a conformal , timelike boundary at @xmath15 .    from the point of view of the matter content , we will consider a real , massive scalar field , with a possibly non minimal coupling to scalar curvature .",
    "although the dynamics is ruled by the klein - gordon operator , its smooth solutions can not be constructed only starting from suitable initial data , but one needs also to prescribe boundary conditions at @xmath15 .",
    "this additional input has dramatic effects at the level of quantum theory , both in the construction of the collection of all possible observables and in the identification of a physically acceptable quantum state . in this paper",
    ", we will be focusing on the second problem . as a matter of fact",
    "we will be asking ourselves two questions .",
    "the first is if one can construct the two - point function @xmath2 for the ground state .",
    "this must be invariant under all isometries of @xmath0 , a solution of the equations of motion in both entries and it must also encode the choice of boundary conditions .",
    "the second question is whether such @xmath2 is the two - point function for a physically acceptable state . in this respect , the notion of hadamard states can not be invoked since it is strongly tied to spacetimes which are globally hyperbolic .",
    "when such requirement is missing , there is no universally accepted replacement and actually this is an interesting open problem .",
    "nonetheless , a minimal request , which one can ask , is that at least the restriction of the two - point function to any globally hyperbolic subregion of @xmath0 is of hadamard form , a condition which can be traced back to @xcite .    as a first step",
    ", we will be showing that for a certain range of the mass and curvature coupling no boundary condition at @xmath15 is required , whereas for its complement a whole one - parameter family of boundary conditions can be considered . as a second step",
    ", we will show that a two - point function @xmath2 with the desired characteristics exists and it encodes in particular the choice of boundary conditions .",
    "it is important to stress that , while dirichlet and neumann are always unproblematic choices",
    "( whenever admissible ) , the robin boundary conditions are rather tricky . as a matter of fact",
    ", we will prove that there exist instances where , upon choosing robin boundary conditions , `` bound states '' solutions , which are exponentially suppressed for large @xmath14 , appear .",
    "this is a very troublesome feature , first of all since it destroys the invariance under the @xmath0 isometry group .",
    "this peculiar scenario is drastically different from the usual free field theories and for this reason we will highlight its existence , leaving a more detailed analysis to future works .    in terms of the singular behavior of @xmath2",
    ", we will show that singularities occur whenever @xmath16 and @xmath17 are connected by a null geodesic , possibly reflected at the boundary .",
    "this behavior is not only consistent with the requirement that @xmath2 be of hadamard form in every globally hyperbolic subregion , but also with the construction via the method of images of the two - point function , associated to the casimir effect @xcite , which corresponds to one of the particular cases considered here : a massless , conformally coupled scalar field .",
    "it is important to stress that we are not the first ones to study the quantization of a real , massive scalar field in anti - de sitter , since a first analysis appeared already in the late seventies in @xcite .",
    "also the construction of a maximally symmetric two - point function was tackled before , see @xcite .",
    "other recent works for this and other matter fields on ads include @xcite .",
    "yet , these works considered only the special case of dirichlet boundary condition , which corresponds to the friedrichs extension of the helmholtz operator built out of the @xmath0 metric at constant time . in @xcite , the friedrichs extension was shown to be only one of the possible self - adjoint extensions of the helmholtz operator , which correspond to different robin boundary conditions . in this paper",
    ", we use an alternative method to determine all these possible boundary conditions spacetime , one might wish to adapt to this case the wentzell boundary conditions , a generalized version of the robin ones . a preliminary , recent investigation along these lines can be found in @xcite . ] and , in addition , we construct the associated two - point functions for a ground state , obtaining their singular behavior .    the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : ads ] , we will recall the basic structural , geometric properties of @xmath3 and in particular of the associated poincar fundamental domain . in section [ sec : kg ] , we will consider the klein - gordon equation on @xmath0 and , by means of a conformal rescaling , we will transform it to a wave equation with a singular potential on @xmath18 , the subset of minkowski spacetime with @xmath19 .",
    "after a fourier transform in the directions orthogonal to @xmath14 we will reduce the dynamics to a one - dimensional ordinary differential equation of sturm - liouville type .",
    "this is a well studied topic , in particular with reference to the assignment of boundary conditions at the endpoint of the domain of definition of the equation .",
    "as a matter of fact , at the point @xmath15 , where we want to prescribe boundary conditions , the potential of the differential equation is singular .",
    "hence , it fails the usual idea that dirichlet , neumann or robin boundary conditions are nothing but a prescription at the boundary of the behavior of a linear combination between a solution of the differential equation and its derivatives .",
    "we will outline how this obstruction can be circumvented in the language of a sturm - liouville problem . in section [ sec:2-pt ] , we will construct via a mode expansion the two - point functions for all admissible boundary conditions .",
    "we will show that for a certain class of robin boundary conditions `` bound states '' solutions appear , while , in all other cases , one can push the analysis to the very end obtaining a closed form expression for the two - point function .",
    "in addition , we will show invariance under all isometries of the background , hence proving that we have constructed a maximally symmetric state .",
    "finally , we will study the singular behaviour of the two - point function , unveiling its consistence with the standard hadamard prescription in all globally hyperbolic subregions and proposing a new definition of hadamard states which apply to @xmath0 .",
    "in this paper , our starting point is the anti - de sitter spacetime , @xmath3 , the maximally symmetric solution to the @xmath1-dimensional einstein s equation ( @xmath20 ) with a negative cosmological constant @xmath5 .",
    "it can be constructed starting from the embedding space @xmath21 , that is , @xmath22 endowed with metric @xmath23 where @xmath24 are the standard cartesian coordinates , and considering only the region identified by the relation @xmath25 for our purposes and in many physical applications , we do not work directly on @xmath3 , but rather on the _ poincar fundamental domain _ , @xmath0 , which is identified via the coordinate transformation @xmath26 where both @xmath27 and all @xmath28 are ranging over the whole @xmath29 , whereas @xmath30 .",
    "this translates the constraint which descends from the identity @xmath31 , hence showing that @xmath0 covers only half of the full @xmath3 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ads ] ) .",
    "in addition , the metric of the poincar domain becomes @xmath32 where @xmath33 stands for the kronecker delta .",
    "hence , @xmath0 is conformal to a portion of minkowski spacetime , the `` upper - half plane '' @xmath34 where we adopted the same cartesian coordinates as in . if we endow @xmath18 with the standard minkowskian metric @xmath35 ,",
    "then @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the metric of @xmath0 and @xmath38 is the conformal factor .",
    "conformal diagram of @xmath3 and the poincar domain and the representation with one spatial dimension restored . ]    to finish this short introduction on the geometric aspects of the background , let us briefly describe the notion of invariant distance in ads .",
    "one can proceed in two distinct , albeit equivalent ways .",
    "intrinsically , one can define the geodesic distance @xmath39 on @xmath0 between two arbitrary points @xmath16 and @xmath40 and the synge s world function @xmath41 given by @xmath42 . in view of",
    ", one can start instead from the chordal distance @xmath43 between @xmath16 and @xmath40 through the embedding space @xmath21 and from the synge s world function defined on @xmath21 as @xmath44 with the constraint that @xmath16 and @xmath17 are two points constrained by , hence lying in @xmath3 .",
    "these two notions are related by @xmath45 ( see e.g.  section 2.4 of @xcite ) . in the rest of the paper",
    ", we set @xmath46 .",
    "we consider a real , massive scalar field @xmath47 such that @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the dalembert wave operator built out of , @xmath50 is the mass of the scalar field , @xmath51 is the scalar - curvature coupling constant and @xmath52 is the ricci scalar .    in order to study the solutions of this equation , we follow a slightly unconventional strategy which relies on the observation made previously that @xmath0 is conformal to @xmath18 and it consists in translating into a partial differential equation intrinsically defined on @xmath18 .",
    "this is a standard procedure , see e.g.  appendix d of @xcite .",
    "let @xmath53 be any solution of and let @xmath54 .",
    "the latter can be read as a scalar field @xmath55 , solution of the equation @xmath56 in which @xmath57 is the standard wave operator built out of the minkowski metric @xmath35 and we define differs from the `` effective mass ''",
    "@xmath58 used in other references . ]",

    "it is known that there is a continuous spectrum contained in @xmath68 and , for some boundary conditions , there is also a point spectrum with negative eigenvalues , which is indicative of the existence of `` bound states '' in the space of solutions of , that is , exponentially decaying solutions in @xmath14 . to the best knowledge of the authors of this paper ,",
    "these solutions have not been discussed so far in the literature of scalar field theory on ads .",
