    "recently it became possible to derive simultaneously internal kinematics and characteristics of the stellar population of galaxies @xcite .",
    "we use a simple parametric procedure @xcite to fit the moments of the line - of - sight velocity distribution ( losvd ) : v , @xmath0 ; and parametrized star formation history ( sfh ) containing either single stellar population ( ssp ) or several star bursts , using models computed with pegase.hr @xcite . before running the inversion procedure one needs to : ( a ) determine variations of the spectrograph s line - spread function along wavelength and over the field of the ifu ; ( b ) inject this information into template spectra .",
    "we stress that the population parameters are constrained by the absorption lines and not by the shape of the continuum which may be affected by internal extinction or calibration uncertainties .",
    "the questions we address are :    1 .",
    "does the method return unbiased estimates of kinematics , age ( @xmath1 ) and metallicity ( @xmath2 ) at any signal to noise ratio ( snr ) ? 2 .",
    "what are the degeneracies between different parameters ? 3 .",
    "what snr and spectral resolution are required to get a given precision ?",
    "are various models of stellar populations consistent ?    _ biases and degeneracy .",
    "_ we have performed extensive monte - carlo simulations to fit ssp or sfh containing two bursts with snr ranging from 1 to 500 pix@xmath3 ( at r=10000 ; pix=0.2 ) .",
    "as long as the grid of models is fine enough for performing good interpolation , our method is not biased down to snr=5 pix@xmath3 .",
    "the main degeneracy is naturally between age and metallicity , but fig  [ fig:1 ] presents also the degeneracy between @xmath4 and @xmath2 : a discrepancy toward higher @xmath2 ( sharp lines ) is compensated by higher @xmath4 .",
    "this latter degeneracy is the strongest coupling between the kinematical and population parameters .",
    "an error of 1 dex on the metallicity results in an error of about @xmath5 on the velocity dispersion .",
    "this can introduce a significant systematics in the determination of the mass - to - light ratio of galaxies .",
    "this effect is considerably reduced if an additive continuum is included in the fit , but in this case constraints on the stellar populations are lost .",
    "_ relation between precision and snr .",
    "_ the precision essentially depends on the total snr integrated over the whole wavelength range ( fig  [ fig:2 ] ) : a lower snr per pixel can be balanced by a larger number of pixels . when the wavelength range is shortened to exclude the blue region containing h@xmath6 line and bluer ( but keeping the same total snr ) , the precision on kinematics and metallicity is not seriously affected , but the precision on age becomes twice worse .    , @xmath4 = 50kms@xmath3,title=\"fig:\",height=188 ] , @xmath4 = 50kms@xmath3,title=\"fig:\",height=188 ]    _ relation between resolution and precision_. the precision on kinematical and population parameters depends on ( @xmath7)(fig  [ fig:3 ] ) , where @xmath8 is the instrumental velocity dispersion .",
    "the resolution is an important parameter for the precise determination of the kinematics .",
    "but it has weaker influence over the errors on age and metallicity .(see the relations below . )",
    "when @xmath9 , the different minimization strategies that we experimented generally become unstable to measure the internal kinematics .",
    "the method based on the pixel fitting with pegase.hr templates can efficiently constrain kinematics and stellar population . we summarize below the relations between the errors on the population characteristics , the total signal to noise ratio , and the resolution ( for the spectral range 4000 6800 ) :       these relations are useful to select the observational setup : what is the optimal compromise between the spectral dispersion and the size of the spatial elements that minimizes the errors in a given observing time ? considering only the sources of uncertainties modeled in our simulations",
    ", it appears that the best precision on the internal kinematics will be obtained when @xmath10 . for the best precision on the parameters of the stellar population it is preferable to maximize the total snr with a lower dispersion .",
    "still , a single setup with a resolution matching the velocity dispersion is in general the good choice .",
    "the template mismatch due to abundance effects and the uncertainties in the modeling of a stellar populations are probably the source of significant biases on the parameters of the stellar population .",
    "in particular , we can guess that if balmer lines are not in the wavelength range , the determination of age will be extremely sensitive to abundance mismatch .",
    "we have inverted observations of globular clusters @xcite and simulated spectra from bruzual & charlot @xcite . for old populations",
    "the estimates appear too young and metallic .",
    "we are investigating the origin of this problem that may be connected with the bias found by prieto et al .",
    "@xcite in the elodie library .",
    "range from 400 to 680  nm and dispersion of 0.2 / pix .",
    "the curves noted bc03 are representing simulations with bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) models , and those noted rose gc are observation of globular clusters by rose et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , all analyzed with pegase.hr templates .",
