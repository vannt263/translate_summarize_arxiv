    "the question of whether splitting the phase diagram into the regions @xmath86 and @xmath87 does correspond to really different path behaviors has a positive answer , at least if we do not consider the critical case , that is if we consider the path behavior for @xmath88 and for @xmath89 in the interior of @xmath87 .",
    "however , while the localized regime is rather well understood , the delocalized one remains somewhat elusive ( we take up this point again in section  [ sec : path1 ] ) .",
    "more precisely :    * for @xmath88 one knows that the polymer is going to stay very close to the interface , _ essentially _ at distance @xmath90 and the polymer becomes positive recurrent for @xmath91 . due to the disordered distribution of the charges , even the most elementary results in this direction require a careful formulation and we prefer to refer to @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . * for @xmath89 in the interior of @xmath87 one can prove by large deviation arguments that there are @xmath92 visits to the unfavorable solvent and by more sophisticate arguments that these visits are actually @xmath93 @xcite .",
    "these results are in sharp contrast with what happens in @xmath86 and in this sense they are satisfactory .",
    "however they give at the same time still a weak information on the paths , above all if compared to what is available for non disordered models , see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and references therein , namely brownian scaling , which in turn is a consequence of the fact that all the visits in the unfavorable solvent happen very close to the boundary points , that is the origin , under the measure @xmath9 . in non disordered models",
    "one can in fact prove that the polymer becomes transient and that it visits the unfavorable solvent , or any point below a fixed level , only a finite number of times .",
    "recently it has been shown @xcite that such a result can not hold as stated , at least for @xmath94 , for the disordered copolymer .",
    "however the results in @xcite leave open the possibility of brownian scaling in the whole delocalized region .",
    "formula leaves an important gap , that hides the only partial understanding of the nature of this delocalization / localization transition .",
    "our purpose is to go toward filling this gap : our results are both of theoretical and numerical nature . at the same time",
    "we address the delocalization issues raised in ",
    "[ sec : pathwise ] , which are intimately related with the precise asymptotic behavior of @xmath85 and of @xmath95 .",
    "more precisely :    1 .   in section  [ sec : testing ]",
    "we present a statistical test with explicit error bounds , see proposition  [ th : stat ] , based on super  additivity and concentration inequalities , to state that a point @xmath89 is localized .",
    "we apply this test to show that , with a very low level of error , the lower bound @xmath96 defined in does not coincide with the critical line",
    ". 2 .   in section",
    "[ sec : lb ] we give the outline of a new proof of the main result in @xcite .",
    "the details of the proof are in appendix b and we point out in particular proposition  [ prop : stopping1 ] , that gives a necessary and sufficient condition for localization . this viewpoint on the transition , derived from (",
    "* section  4 ) , helps substantially in interpreting the _ irregularities _ in the behavior of @xmath97 as @xmath98 .",
    "3 .   in section  [ sec",
    ": path ] we pick up the conjecture of brownian scaling in the delocalized regime both in the intent of testing it and in trying to asses with reasonable confidence that @xmath89 is in the interior of @xmath87 . in particular , we present quantitative evidences in favor of the fact that the upper bound @xmath99 defined in is strictly greater than the critical line .",
    "we stress that this is a very delicate issue , since delocalization , unlike localization , does not appear to be reducible to a finite volume issue .",
    "4 .   finally ,",
    "in section  [ sec : guess ] , we report the results of a numerical attempt to determine the critical curve . while this issue has to be treated with care , mostly for the reasons raised in point 4 above , we observe a surprising phenomenon : the critical curve appears to be very close to @xmath100 for a suitable value of @xmath101 . by the universality result proven in @xcite , building on the free energy brownian scaling result proven in @xcite , the slope at the origin of @xmath102",
    "does not depend on the law of @xmath18 .",
    "therefore if really @xmath103 , since the slope at the origin of @xmath100 is @xmath101 , @xmath101 is the universal constant we are looking for .",
    "we do not believe that the numerical evidence allows to make a clear cut statement , but what we observe is compatible with such a possibility .",
    "we point out that our numerical results are based on a numerical computation of the partition function @xmath85 , exploiting the standard transfer",
    " matrix approach ( this item is discussed in more details in appendix  [ app : algo ] ) .",
    "the _ copolymer in the proximity of an interface _ problem has a long literature , but possibly the first article that attracted the attention of mathematicians is @xcite . here",
    "we are going to focus on very specific issues and the most interesting for our purposes is that in the physical literature both the conjecture that @xmath104 ( cf .",
    "@xcite and @xcite ) and that @xmath105 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) are set forth .",
    "the approaches are non rigorous , mostly based on replica computations , with the exception of @xcite whose method is the real space renormalization technique for one  dimensional disordered systems first proposed in @xcite in the context of quantum ising model with transverse field and then applied with remarkably precise results to random walk in random environment , see e. g. @xcite .",
    "the result in @xcite , that @xmath106 , is obtained by exploiting the path behavior of the copolymer near criticality suggested in @xcite .",
    "this strategy may by summed up by : the localized polymer close to criticality is mostly delocalized in the upper half  plane and it keeps in the lower half  plane only the rare portions with an atypically negative charge . the numerical results that we set forth in this work are saying that this strategy is not good enough .    at the opposite end ,",
    "the result @xmath107 , albeit relatively subtle , is absolutely elementary to prove @xcite . and",
    "such a bound does not depend at all on the details of the walk : any non trivial null recurrent walk with increments in @xmath108 leads to the same upper bound .",
    "this suggests that such a bound is too rough .",
    "one can however prove that the standard procedure for obtaining upper bounds that goes under the name of _ constrained annealing _ can not improve such a bound @xcite .",
    "this is in any case far from being a proof that @xmath109 , and in fact the numerics suggest that this is not the case .    in the literature",
    "one finds also a large number of numerical works on copolymers , we mention here for example @xcite , @xcite and references therein .",
    "as far as we have seen , the attention is often shifted toward different aspects , notably of course the issue of critical exponents , and the more complex model in which the polymer is not directed but rather self  avoiding , see @xcite and @xcite also for some rigorous results and references in such a direction .",
    "our work has been led rather by the idea that understanding the precise location of the critical curve is a measure of our understanding of the nature of the transition .",
    "understanding that , in turn , could promote an advance on the mathematical analysis of the copolymer and , more generally , of this kind of disordered models .",
    "at an intuitive level one is led to believe that , when the copolymer is localized , it should be possible to detect it by looking at the system before the infinite volume limit .",
    "this intuition is due to the fact that in the localized phase the length of each excursion is finite , therefore for @xmath35 _ much larger _ that the _ typical _ excursion length one should already observe the localization phenomenon in a quantitative way .",
    "the system being disordered of course does not help , because it is more delicate to make sense of what _ typicality",
    "_ means in a non translation invariant set  up .",
    "however the translation invariance can be recovered by averaging and in fact it turns out to be rather easy to give a precise meaning to the intuitive idea we have just mentioned .",
    "the key word here is super  additivity of the averaged free energy .",
    "in fact by considering only the @xmath74 trajectories such that @xmath110 and by applying the markov property of @xmath74 one directly verifies that for any @xmath111 @xmath112 @xmath113 , and therefore @xmath114 is a super  additive sequence , which immediately entails the existence of the limit of @xmath115/2n$ ] and the fact that this limit coincides with the supremum of the sequence .",
    "therefore from the existence of the quenched free energy we have that @xmath116 in a more suggestive way one may say that : @xmath117 the price one pays for working with a disordered system is precisely in taking the @xmath19expectation and from the numerical viewpoint it is an heavy price : even with the most positive attitude one can not expect to have access to @xmath118 by direct numerical computation for @xmath35 above @xmath119 .",
    "of course in principle small values of @xmath35 may suffice ( and they do in some cases , see remark  [ rem : n=2 ] ) , but they do not suffice to tackle the specific issue we are interested in .",
    "we elaborate at length on this interesting issue in   [ sec : computer_assisted ] .",
    "[ rem : n=2 ] an elementary application of the localization criterion is obtained for @xmath120 : @xmath121",
    "if @xmath122>0.\\ ] ] in the case @xmath123 from we obtain that for @xmath124 sufficiently large @xmath125 , with @xmath126 . from @xmath127 we obtain the same type of bound , with @xmath128 .",
    "this may raise some hope that for @xmath124 large an explicit , possibly computer assisted , computation for small values of @xmath35 of @xmath118 could lead to new estimates .",
    "this is not the case , as we show in  ",
    "[ sec : computer_assisted ] .      in order to decide whether @xmath129 we resort to a montecarlo evaluation of @xmath118 that can be cast into a statistical test with explicit error bound by means of concentration of measure ideas .",
    "this procedure is absolutely general , but we have to choose a set  up for the computations and we take the simplest : @xmath130 .",
    "the reason for this choice is twofold :    * if @xmath48 is a bounded random variable , a gaussian concentration inequality holds and if @xmath18 is symmetric and it takes only two values then one can improve on the explicit constant in such an inequality .",
    "this speeds up in a non negligible way the computations ; * generating _ true randomness _ is out of reach , but playing head and tail is certainly the most elementary case in such a far reaching task ( the random numbers issue is briefly discussed in appendix  [ app : algo ] too ) .",
    "a third reason to restrict testing to the bernoulli case is explained at the end of the caption of table [ tbl:2 ] .",
    "we start the testing procedure by stating the null hypothesis : @xmath131 @xmath35 in h0 can be chosen arbitrarily .",
    "we stress that refusing h0 implies @xmath129 , which by implies localization .",
    "the following concentration inequality for lipschitz functions holds for the uniform measure on @xmath132 : for every function @xmath133 such that @xmath134 , where @xmath135 a positive constant and @xmath136 is an abuse of notation for @xmath137 , one has @xmath138\\right)\\right)\\right]\\ , \\le\\ , \\exp\\left({\\alpha}^2c_{\\text{lip}}^2\\right),\\ ] ] for every @xmath21 . inequality with an extra factor @xmath139 at the exponent",
