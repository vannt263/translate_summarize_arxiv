    ", an atomic monoid means a commutative cancellative semigroup with identity element such that every non - unit may be expressed as a sum of finitely many atoms ( irreducible elements ) .",

    "let @xmath2 be a monoid , the @xmath0-invariant , introduced in @xcite , is a well - established invariant in the theory of non - unique factorizations , and appears also in the context of direct - sum decompositions of modules @xcite .",
