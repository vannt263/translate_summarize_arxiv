    "it is widely speculated that space - time is a dynamical medium , subject to quantum - gravitational ( qg ) effects that cause space - time to fluctuate on the planck time and distance scales  @xcite , for reviews see  @xcite .",
    "it has also been suggested that this ` foaming ' of space - time might be reflected in modifications of the propagation of energetic particles , namely dispersive effects due to a non - trivial refractive index induced by the qg fluctuations in the space - time foam .",
    "there are microscopic string - inspired models  @xcite that predict only subluminal refraction , and only for photons  @xcite , suppressed either linearly or quadratically by some qg mass scale : @xmath11 one might guess that the scale @xmath12 or @xmath13 would be related to @xmath14 , where @xmath15  gev is the reduced planck mass , but smaller values might be possible in some string theories  @xcite , or models with large extra dimensions  @xcite .",
    "superluminal modes and birefringence effects are also allowed in some other models  @xcite .",
    "a favored way to search for such a non - trivial dispersion relation is to compare the arrival times of photons of different energies arriving on earth from pulses of distant astrophysical sources  @xcite .",
    "the greatest sensitivities may be expected from sources with short pulses , at large distances or redshifts @xmath16 , of photons observed over a large range of energies . in the past , studies have been made of emissions from pulsars  @xcite , @xmath2-ray bursts ( grbs )  @xcite and active galactic nuclei ( agns )  @xcite .",
    "in particular , a combined analysis of many grbs at different redshifts made possible some separation between energy- and source - dependent effects , and yielded a robust lower limit @xmath17  gev  @xcite .",
    "astrophysical sources that produce very high energy photons in the tev range or higher could improve significantly the sensitivity to lorentz violation , if one could distinguish source and propagation effects . flaring agns are celestial objects with the desired properties , and a pioneering study of a flare of the agn mkn  421 yielded a sensitivity to @xmath18  gev  @xcite .    in this letter",
    "we analyze two flares of mkn  501 ( @xmath19 ) observed by the major atmospheric gamma - ray imaging cerenkov ( magic ) telescope  @xcite between may and july 2005 . after applying standard quality checks , data covering a total observation time of 31.6",
    "h spread over 24 nights survived and were analysed  @xcite .",
    "the data were taken at zenith angles of 10@xmath2030@xmath21 , resulting in an energy threshold ( defined as the peak of the differential event - rate spectrum after cuts ) of @xmath22 gev .",
    "the air - shower events were subjected to the standard magic analysis @xcite , which rejects about 99% of hadronic background events , while retaining 50@xmath2360% of the @xmath2-ray induced showers .",
    "the @xmath2-ray energies are , in a first approximation , proportional to the total amount of light recorded in the shower images ; corrections are applied according to further image parameters @xcite obtained from the analysis .",
    "the achieved energy resolution is @xmath24% over the range 170  gev to 10  tev .",
    "the arrival time of each event is obtained with sub - ms precision .    during the observations , variations in the @xmath2-ray flux by an order of magnitude",
    "were observed , with the maximum integrated flux above @xmath25  150 gev exceeding @xmath26 @xmath27s@xmath28 . in the two nights with the highest flux ,",
    "high - intensity outbursts of short duration ( flares ) were recorded with characteristic rise and fall times of 1@xmath232 minutes . while the flare of july  9 was clearly visible over the full energy range 0.15@xmath2310  tev and reached a peak flux more than a factor two higher than before and after the flare , that seen on june  30 was concentrated at low energies ( 0.25@xmath231  tev ) and less significant . in the analysis",
    "below , we applied cuts on the image parameter @xmath29 @xcite , describing the gamma shower arrival direction : @xmath30 , and on energy : @xmath31  gev .",
    "the spectral time properties of the most intense portions of the flares were quantified in  @xcite using four different energy bands with boundaries at 0.15 , 0.25 , 0.6 and 1.2  tev , the fourth band extending to infinite energies . in the june",
    "30 flare a signal above a uniform background appeared only in the energy band of 0.25@xmath230.6 tev , which did not permit any conclusion on the time - spectral properties of the signal . for the flare of july  9 ,",
    "a time lag of about 4 minutes was found for the maximum of the time profile envelope for photons in the 1.2@xmath2310  tev energy band relative to those in the range 0.25@xmath230.6  tev .",
    "the difference between the mean energies in these two bands is @xmath25  2 tev , which would lead to a naive estimate of a time delay of about 0.12 s for each gev of energy difference .",
    "however , this approach is too simplistic , since the energy range covered by the 1.2@xmath2310  tev band is much larger than the energy difference between the two bands , so the binned estimator used in  @xcite is inadequate for constraining possible linear or quadratic energy dependences . in view of this and the limited number of photons",
    ", we improve here on the binned estimator by analyzing the complete information encoded in the time - energy distribution of _ individual _ photons in the flare , with the aim of probing possible systematic energy - dependent time lags induced by qg vacuum refraction during photon propagation to the earth , or intrinsic to the source .",
    "the true shape of the time profile at the source is not known , so we choose the following analysis strategy . in general , the short pulse structure of any flare would be blurred by an energy - dependent effect on photon propagation .",
    "conversely , one may correct for the effects of any given parametric model of photon dispersion , e.g. , the linear or quadratic vacuum refractive index , by applying to each photon the appropriate time shift  @xcite corresponding to its propagation in a spatially - flat expanding universe : @xmath32 or similarly for the quadratic case , where @xmath33 is the hubble expansion rate and @xmath34 .",
    "if the correct energy - dependent qg shift is applied , the short pulse structure of the emission profile is restored .",
    "we implement this analysis strategy in two ways . in one analysis",
    ", we consider the most active part of the flare , that is distinguished clearly from the uniform background , and the qg shift is varied so as to maximize the total energy in this part . in the other analysis we use the shape of the flare as extracted from untransformed low - energy data .",

    "it is well known  @xcite that a pulse of electromagnetic radiation propagating through a linearly - dispersive medium , as postulated here , becomes diluted so that its power ( the energy per unit time ) decreases.$ ] or @xmath35 $ ] . ]",
    "any transformation of a signal to reproduce the undispersed signal tends to recover the original power of the pulse .",
    "if the parameter @xmath36 is chosen correctly , the power of the recovered pulse is maximized .",
    "we implement this observation as follows .",
    "first , we choose a time interval @xmath37 containing the most active part of the flare , as determined using a kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) statistic  @xcite .",
    "the ks statistic is calculated from the difference between the cumulative distribution function estimated from the unbinned data and that of a uniform distribution .",
    "the interval @xmath37 covers the time range where the value of the ks difference varies from its maximum over the whole time support of the signal down to a negligible value .",
    "this procedure determines the proper time - width @xmath38 of the most active ( transient ) part of the flare . having chosen this window , we scan over the whole support the time - distribution of all photons shifted by @xmath39 and sum up the energies of photons in the window . for convenience ,",
    "we re - parametrize the time shift as @xmath40 or @xmath41 respectively , with @xmath42 and @xmath43 in @xmath44 and @xmath45 units .",
    "the transformation is repeated for many values of @xmath42 and @xmath43 , chosen so that the shifts @xmath46 match the precision of the arrival - time measurements , and for each @xmath42 or @xmath43 the scan is performed and the maximal summed energy in a window of width @xmath38 is obtained .",
    "the maximal energies as a function of @xmath42 or @xmath43 define the ` energy cost function ' ( ecf ) .",
    "the position of the maximum of the ecf indicates the value of @xmath42 or @xmath43 that best recovers the signal , in the sense of maximizing its power . has a negligible effect on the position of the maximum .",
    "we take into account the difference between the width at the earth and at the source , also negligible . ]",
    "this procedure is applied to 1000 monte carlo ( mc ) data samples generated by applying to the measured photon energies the ( energy - dependent ) gaussian measurement errors .",
    "[ costeqg ] shows the ecf for one such energy - smeared mc sample .",
    "it exhibits a clear maximum , whose position may be estimated by fitting it with a gaussian profile in the peak vicinity .",
    "[ histas ] shows the results of such fits to the ecfs with @xmath42 for the 1000 energy - smeared realizations of the july  9 flare . from this distribution",
    "we derive the value @xmath47  s / gev , where @xmath48 , leading to a lower limit @xmath49  gev at the 95% c.l.-@xmath6 range of @xmath50 to estimate the @xmath51-@xmath6 range of @xmath36 . ] the same procedure applied to the ecf obtained using @xmath43 leads to @xmath52  s / gev@xmath8 , where @xmath53 , corresponding to @xmath54  gev at the 95% c.l . while our results for the june  30 flare have similar sensitivities and are compatible , they can not be used to strengthen our results , as this flare is not very significant .",
    "we have confirmed this result using another technique to study the energy - dependent delay signal in the data .",
    "it is motivated by the initial time and energy - binned analysis performed in  @xcite , which we used to check that the light - curve is well described by a simple gaussian profile , superimposed on a time - independent background .",
    "we compute a likelihood function @xmath55 based on the probability of a photon to be observed with energy @xmath56 and arrival time @xmath57 , using variables describing the energy spectrum at the source , the time distribution at emission obtained from the measured arrival times of the photons assuming an adjustable energy - dependent propagation delay , and the energy resolution of the detector , which is modelled as a gaussian  @xcite . to describe the photon energy at the source a simple power law @xmath58 is taken , with @xmath59 for the time - uniform part of the flare and @xmath60 for the flaring part  @xcite .",
    "the likelihood function is fitted to the july  9 data minimizing @xmath61 as a function of four parameters : ( i ) the energy - dependent delay parameterized in terms of @xmath62 , ( ii ) the position of the intrinsic maximum of the gaussian flare , ( iii ) its width and ( iv ) the normalization of the time - independent background component in arbitrary units .",
    "the best fit yields @xmath63 , corresponding to @xmath64  s / gev .",
    "the shape of the function @xmath65 around the minimum in these variables is quite parabolic almost up to the 2-@xmath6 level . in view of the correlations with these parameters",
    ", the sensitivity to @xmath42 would be improved if they were known more precisely .",
    "a similar procedure in the case of a quadratic dependency gives @xmath66 s / gev@xmath8 .",
    "[ datafit ] shows that the @xmath55 function gives a good overall fit to the data : binning in time and energy both the data and the @xmath55 function , we find @xmath67/ndf @xmath68 .      to check the robustness of the ecf and likelihood analyses",
    ", we simulated several mc test samples with two components : ( a ) a time - independent background with the same energy spectrum as the measured data before the flare , and ( b ) a superposed signal generated at the source with an energy spectrum similar to that observed during the flare and an energy - independent gaussian time distribution , each with the same numbers of photons as in the measurement .",
    "we then calculated the arrival times of all photons using various dispersion models and parameters , taking into account the magic energy resolution . for each dispersion model and parameter , we generated 1000 incarnations , using different random seeds .",
    "these samples were then analyzed blindly , and the encoded effects were recovered successfully by the two estimators within the expected uncertainties .",
    "in addition , the analysis techniques were applied to mc samples with no energy - dependent dispersive signal encoded , and found no effect , and both techniques also returned null results when applied to mkn 501 data from outside a flare .",
    "these tests confirm the numerical sensitivities of the analyses and the estimates of the uncertainties given above .",
    "for the likelihood method , additional checks have been performed  @xcite assuming different flare energy spectra and shapes , besides the gaussian one discussed here , which also fit reasonably well the binned data ( c.f .",
    "[ datafit ] ) .",
    "the probability of the zero - delay assumption relative to the one obtained with the ecf estimator is @xmath69 .",
    "the observed energy - dependent delay thus is a likely observation , but does not constitute a statistically firm discovery .",
    "the results of the two independent analyses of the july  9 flare of mkn  501 are quite consistent within the errors .",
    "their results exhibit a delay between @xmath2-rays of different energies , @xmath5  s / gev , corresponding to a lower limit @xmath49  gev at the 95% c.l .",
    "we also find a quadratic delay @xmath7  s / gev@xmath8 , and @xmath70  gev at the 95% c.l . , far beyond previous limits on a quadratic effect in photon propagation  @xcite .",
    "these numbers could turn into a real measurement of @xmath71 , if the emission mechanism at the source were understood and the observed delays were mainly due to propagation .",
    "we can not exclude , however , the possibility that the delay we find , which is significant beyond the 95% c.l . , is due to some energy - dependent effect at the source . would rise .",
    "] however , we can exclude the possibility that the observed time delay may be due to a conventional qed plasma refraction effect induced as photons propagate through the source .",
    "this would induce  @xcite @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the fine - structure constant , @xmath74 is the photon momentum , @xmath75 is the plasma temperature , @xmath76 is the mass of electron , @xmath77 is the size of the plasma , and we use natural units : @xmath78 .",
    "plausible numbers such as @xmath79  mev and @xmath80  km ( for a review see @xcite ) yield a negligible effect for @xmath81  tev .",
    "exclusion of other source effects , such as time evolution in the mean emitted photon energy , might be possible with the observation of more flares , e.g. , of different agns at varying redshifts .",
    "observations of a single flare can not distinguish the quantum - gravity scenarios considered here from modified synchrotron - self - compton mechanisms  @xcite .",
    "however , this pioneering study demonstrates clearly the potential scientific value of an analysis of multiple flares from different sources . the most promising candidate for applying the analyses proposed here is the flare from pks 2155 - 304 detected recently by h.e.s.s .",
    "unfortunately the occurrence of fast flares in agns is currently unpredictable , and since no correlation has yet been established with observations in other energy bands that could be used as a trigger signal , only serendipitous detections are currently possible .",
