    "big solute particles ( e.g.  colloids ) immersed in a solvent of smaller particles interact with each other by an effective potential which is the sum of their direct interaction and a solvent mediated ( sm ) potential .",
    "even when the direct interaction consists solely of two  body terms , the sm potential contains higher body contributions , of all orders which are determined formally by integrating out the solvent degrees of freedom .",
    "this conceptual framework yields , in principle , a much simpler effective hamiltonian which involves only the coordinates of the big particles .",
    "@xcite in certain systems the two  body term in the sm potential may dominate completely the corresponding direct interaction .",
    "a well  known example is a suspension of big hard  sphere colloids in a solvent of small hard  spheres . there",
    "the sm potential between the colloids is termed the depletion interaction and this is the only contribution to the effective potential for separations greater than the big hard  sphere diameter .",
    "@xcite in the case of a ( non  hard ) solvent which is at a state point near to fluid - fluid phase separation , big solute particles can be surrounded by a thick adsorbed ` wetting ' film of the coexisting solvent phase .",
    "@xcite if two such big particles become sufficiently close , there can be a ` bridging transition ' as the wetting films surrounding the two big particles join to form a fluid bridge of the wetting phase ",
    "see for example ref .   and references therein . in wet granular media",
    "these bridging ( or capillary ) forces lead to strong and very short  ranged interactions . for small solutes",
    "these effective attractions become rather long  ranged with respect to the dimension of the solute as is known from tip  substrate interactions in atomic force microscopy .",
    "@xcite long  ranged attractive interactions are also surmised for hydrophobic molecules in water at ambient conditions .",
    "@xcite bridging is also a possible mechanism for driving colloidal flocculation .",
    "@xcite    in previous work , @xcite the wetting of a binary solvent around a single big particle and the influence of these thick adsorbed films on the effective sm potential between two big particles , was investigated for a particular model fluid , namely the generalisation to mixtures of the gaussian core model ( gcm ) .",
    "@xcite a gaussian potential provides a good approximation for the effective potential between the centres of mass of polymers in solution .",
    "@xcite the approach to calculating the sm potentials was based upon the theory developed by roth    et al    .",
    "@xcite  henceforth referred to as the ` insertion method ' .",
    "the insertion method works within the framework of density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite and uses as input the density profiles calculated around a _ single _ big particle in order to calculate the sm potential between a _",
    "pair _ of big particles .",
    "although the insertion method is formally exact , in practice one must employ an approximation for the free energy functional of the mixture of big and small particles .",
    "@xcite for state points near to coexistence we found thick adsorbed films around the big particles resulting in long ranged , strongly attractive sm potentials whose range was determined by the thickness of the wetting film .",
    "however , using the insertion method , we were unable to detect any direct sign of bridging in the sm potential .",
    "@xcite    the present work can be viewed as going a significant step further than refs .  .",
    "here we investigate the same system : two large solute gaussian particles , immersed in a binary gcm solvent near to phase separation .",
    "however , whereas the previous work used the elegant insertion method , the present work can be viewed as the ` brute - force ' approach to the problem . using an accurate dft for the binary gcm solvent of small particles @xcite",
    "we calculate explicitly the solvent density profiles around a fixed _ pair _ of the big gcm particles , treating the latter as external potentials , and determine the resulting grand potential . by repeating this calculation for a range of values of the separation between the centres of the two big particles we obtain the sm potential .",
    "we find , within the present ( mean - field ) dft approach , that when thick adsorbed films are present there can be a bridging transition as the separation between the two big particles is decreased , i.e.  the formation of a bridging configuration gives rise to a discontinuity in the derivative of the sm potential .",
    "we believe that this is the first time a non - local dft has been used to calculate bridging density profiles and the resulting effective potential between two particles .",
    "bridging has been investigated previously within coarse - grained , local dft in the recent study of stark    et al    .",
    "@xcite for big hard spherical colloids immersed in an isotropic liquid crystal host close to the isotropic - nematic phase boundary .",
    "similarly , andrienko    et al    .",
    "@xcite calculated bridging density profiles of a solvent adsorbed between a big colloid and a planar wall using a local dft .",
    "we also investigate the sm potential between two big gcm particles in a region of the solvent phase diagram near the binodal but lying outside the single particle thin - thick adsorbed film transition line , @xcite where a single big particle does not have a thick adsorbed ` wetting ' film of the coexisting solvent phase around it .",
    "adsorption still influences strongly the sm potential .",
    "we find an analogue of capillary condensation ; as the two big particles become sufficiently close , the composite object is large enough to induce condensation of the coexisting solvent phase around the _ pair _ of big particles .",
    "this effect is somewhat different from that which can occur between two big hard - core particles in a solvent near to coexistence .",
    "when a pair of such particles are sufficiently close , a bridge of the coexisting phase can condense in the gap between the two big particles , without there being thick ` wetting ' films adsorbed on each of the big particles .",
    "@xcite in the present soft core system the strong adsorption is not confined to the space between the big particles , rather it extends through the whole region in which the two big particles are situated .",
    "this local condensation also results in a jump in the sm force between the two big particles with the sm potential becoming strongly attractive for small separations .    in the final part of the present work we relate our results for the sm potential to an approach for calculating the sm potential based upon the mixture ornstein - zernike ( oz ) equations . @xcite by solving the oz equations together with a closure relation one can calculate the various fluid correlation functions .",
    "it is well known that if one makes a diagrammatic expansion for the fluid correlation functions the hyper - netted chain ( hnc ) closure approximation neglects a certain class of ( bridge ) diagrams which , taken together , is termed the bridge function .",
    "@xcite we show that in order to account for the phenomenon of bridging of solvent between big particles within an oz approach to the fluid structure , one must incorporate an accurate theory for the bridge - diagrams .",

    "<S> using density functional theory we calculate the density profiles of a binary solvent adsorbed around a pair of big solute particles . </S>",
    "<S> all species interact via repulsive gaussian potentials . </S>",
    "<S> the solvent exhibits fluid - fluid phase separation and for thermodynamic states near to coexistence the big particles can be surrounded by a thick adsorbed ` wetting ' film of the coexisting solvent phase . </S>",
    "<S> on reducing the separation between the two big particles we find there can be a ` bridging ' transition as the wetting films join to form a fluid bridge . </S>",
    "<S> the potential between the two big particles becomes long ranged and strongly attractive in the bridged configuration . within our mean - field treatment the bridging transition results in a discontinuity in the solvent mediated force . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that accounting for the phenomenon of bridging requires the presence of a non - zero bridge function in the correlations between the solute particles when our model fluid is described within a full mixture theory based upon the ornstein - zernike equations . </S>"
