    "although we have already argued that the temperature drop to the north is steep , a comparison with the universal cluster temperature profile of loken et al .",
    "( 2002 ) also indicates that the temperature appears to be elevated .    in the same region",
    ", we found in section  4.1 an increased flux above a superposition of the two clusters .",
    "thus , in this region we might be witnessing a compression wave , which could be a sign that the two clusters are approaching each other , and their gases have already started interacting .    from the excess of the flux we measured in section  4.1 , we find that @xmath50 ( we use index @xmath51 for the post compression quantities , and @xmath52 are the undisrupted values , and @xmath53 is the photon flux ) .",
    "using @xmath54 , the compressed region is denser by @xmath55 . if the compression is isentropic , we find that the temperature should have increased by a factor @xmath56 . taking the pre - compression temperature ( @xmath57 ) of this region to be somewhere between the observed value and the theoretical value of loken et al .",
    "( 2002 ) at the same distance to the north of the cluster centre ( ie .",
    ", k@xmath58  kev ) , we find that a compression could boost the temperature up to @xmath0(7 - 8 )  kev , somewhat lower than the observed of ( 7.5 - 10.0 )  kev , but similar within the errors .",
    "such a compression would reproduce the excess seen in the surface brightness from this region .",
    "another possible explanation for the increased temperature and flux in this region is that it is due to a shock wave . if this is the case , using eqn .",
    "( 2 ) from markevitch , sarazin & vikhlinin ( 1999 ) , we find that the mach number of their relative motion should be @xmath59 , and the compression factor 1/@xmath60 . for the above calculation we use @xmath61 , a preshock temperature of k@xmath58  kev , and postshock temperature of k@xmath62  kev .",
    "such a shock wave would have increased the flux by an amount of @xmath63 .",
    "thus , in section  4.1 we should have measured a flux of @xmath64 , 2.5 times more than what we actually observe ( see section  4.1 ) .",
    "therefore , we conclude that it is possible that we are witnessing a compression region to the south of abell  401 , in the direction of abell  399 , as a shock would have boosted the flux to much higher levels than the observed .",
    "this finding suggests the possibility that abell  399 and abell  401 have already started interacting .",
    "if it is correct , they should be at early stages of merging , since the _ xmm - newton _ results are not as dramatic as seen in the simulated images of merging clusters ( e.g. , takizawa 1999 ) at later stages of their evolution , and their projected separation is as large as @xmath03  mpc .",
    "note also that the effects of such an early interaction should not affect the inner regions of the clusters .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , it has been suggested in the past that the two clusters have already passed through each other ( fabian et al .",
    "clusters of galaxies comprise two main components : the collisionless dark matter , and the collisional gas .",
    "when two clusters collide , the dark matter particles do not interact .",
    "each dark matter distribution can initially retain its ` identity ' , and after the collision carry on moving largely undisturbed . on the other hand ,",
    "the two gaseous components collide , with dramatic consequences .",
    "shock waves are formed and propagate within the gas , which is heated to high temperatures . as a result",
    "the gas does not follow the dark matter , but is left behind , between the two dark matter components .",
    "this is clearly seen in numerical simulations of merging clusters .",
    "for example , roettiger , loken & burns ( 1997 ) show that after core crossing , the dark matter components carry on moving away from each each for a time , before they re - collapse to form a common dark matter halo .",
    "however , the two gas components never detach , and do nt follow the two separate dark matter potentials .",
    "hence it seem very unlikely that a past head - on merger could provide an acceptable model for abell  399/401 .",
    "another possible scenario that could potentially explain the core disruptions and the large - scale irregularities is that of an off - centre collision .",
    "abell  399 could have come from the north , and abell  401 the south , they have swung closely around each other once in the past , and have now separated following this close encounter .",
    "a favourable combination of the closest separation and relative velocity could disrupt the clusters central regions , by the propagation of strong shocks .",
    "details and results of this process can be seen in the numerical simulations of ricker ( 1998 ) and ricker & sarazin ( 2001 ) .",
    "although this explanation for the dynamics of the system might seem attractive , caution is suggested by the facts that both clusters appear fairly relaxed at large radii , and that their current separation is @xmath03  mpc .",
    "based on cosmological arguments , a typical impact parameter for a cluster collision is @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the clusters scale length [ see sarazin ( 2001 ) for further details ] .",
    "for such an impact parameter , numerical simulations show that after the first close encounter , the clusters never acquire a large separation .",
    "tidal friction brings them together again , after some ( 3 - 4 )  gyr , and they finally merge to form a single remnant . however , larger impact parameters are possible , so we compare the abell  399/401 system with the simulations of ricker & sarazin ( 2001 ) , for their maximum impact parameter of @xmath67 .",
    "these simulations involve the collision of a pair of 2  kev clusters , so we must scale their results to the larger masses of the 7 - 8  kev abell  399/401 system . since @xmath68 , our clusters are more massive by a factor of 8 .",
    "if all lengths are scaled as @xmath69 , then densities are unchanged ( as required for virialised systems at a given epoch ) , as is the timescale of the interaction .",
    "the ricker & sarazin ( 2001 ) simulations predict that @xmath02  gyr after the first close encounter , the clusters have the largest separation , which is @xmath70  mpc . scaling this distance by a factor of two ( 8@xmath71 )",
    ", we expect a maximum separation after a large impact - parameter encounter , of no more than 2  mpc , which is smaller than the minimum projected separation of 3  mpc we observe .",
    "moreover , the temperature map of the collision at t=2  gyr , shows significant structure , with prominent cold tails emanating from both cluster cores .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _",
    "results do not agree well with this picture .    in summary , whilst an off - set collision has the potential to explain both core heating and large scale asymmetries in the gas , the large separation of abell  399 and abell  401 , and the modest nature of their temperature structure ,",
    "do not appear to be compatible with such a model .",
    "most of the features uncovered by the analysis of the _ xmm - newton _ data lead us to conclude that abell  399 is far from being a relaxed cluster , but it is more likely that we are witnessing a young merger remnant : there is an edge to the east of the core ( sector - e in the previous discussions ) , apparent in the _ xmm - newton _ images ; the temperature inside this edge is @xmath06.7  kev , while immediately outside it increases to @xmath08.3 ( see fig .  [ a399t_prof_pies ] ) ; the image analysis ( 1- and 2-dimensional ) gives uncommonly low values for @xmath1 ; there is no evidence for a cooling flow ; and there appears to be a weak radio halo , which seems to coincide with the location of the edge mentioned above ; there are narrow tailed radio galaxies ( nats ) at large distances from the cluster centre .",
    "thus , the most plausible explanation for all these properties is that a small cloud of material has recently fallen towards the centre of abell  399 , roughly in the east - west direction .",
    "the impact has created the ` indentation ' ( or edge ) to the west of the cluster core .",
    "numerical simulations of merging clusters ( e.g. , takizawa 1999 ; roettiger , loken & burns 1997 ) show that during the infall of even low mass systems into larger ones such an indentation is created in the gas density distribution , as the velocity field drags gas towards the cluster centre of the more massive cluster .",
    "simulations also predict the existence of two shock waves that propagate in opposite directions along the collision axis .",
    "we see some evidence for such structures in the temperature profiles obtained in different sectors of fig .",
    "[ a399t_prof_pies](a ) : the ` leading ' shock ( in - front of the infalling blob or group ) , which reaches a maximum temperature of @xmath72  kev in the central @xmath02  arcmin , appears in sectors - w and -s ; the ` back ' shock is expected behind the infalling group , and may be seen in the sector - e at a temperature of @xmath73  kev .",
    "as expected , the ` back ' shock is at larger distances than the leading shock from the cluster centre , as it travels in less dense medium , going down the density gradient .",
    "the exact orientation and temperature of the shocks depends of course on the choice of the sectors , and the 3-dimensional orientation of the collision direction",
    ". however , we believe that the merger is taking place close to the plane of the sky . in support of this , the analysis of girardi et al .",
    "( 1997 ) finds no substructure in the redshift data of abell  399 , and the clarity of the ` indentation ' also suggests that we view the collision from an essentially perpendicular perspective .",
    "as seen in the simulations of colliding clusters , at the early stages of the event the surface brightness distribution appears elongated along an axis perpendicular to the collision direction .",
    "this could explain the orientation of the residuals of the 2-dimensional fits , that appear elongated along the north - south direction .",
    "the last piece of evidence that argues for the merger hypothesis is the presence of diffuse radio emission in the central regions of the cluster ( see fig .",
    "[ halo ] and fig .",
    "although its presence is still to be confirmed by deep vla observations , the _ xmm - newton _ data provide a first evidence that it might be associated with a shock that was created during a recent merger event .",
    "thus , we conclude that abell  399 is undergoing a merger event with a smaller group , and they are close to the stage when their two cores collide .",
    "abell  401 appears also to be disturbed by a merger : there is temperature structure evident in fig .",
    "[ a401t_prof_pies ] ; the core region is hotter ( see fig .  [ t_prof ] ) ; the surface brightness appears elongated along the north - south direction ; there is no cooling flow ; the @xmath1-models that describe best the surface brightness distribution are not representative of relaxed clusters ; bright residuals are seen in the 2-dimensional spatial analysis ; the inner @xmath02  arcmin along sector - n and -s are at hotter temperatures that the rest ; there is a significant temperature decline along sector - n , which is accompanied by a rapidly declining x - ray flux ; there is a radio halo , brighter than the one in abell  399 ( see fig .",
    "[ halo ] ) , and many tailed radio galaxies .",
    "thus , a past merger scenario could explain all the above findings , if one considers that a small group or cloud of material has fallen into the main cluster from approximately the north , north - west direction , and now is travelling trough the core region .",
    "its motion has caused the temperature enhancement in the inner @xmath02  arcmin along sector - n and -w .",
    "it has also dragged the x - ray emitting material towards the cluster core , depleting sector - n from its gas , in a similar manner as in abell  399 sector - e .",

    "both clusters appear to host central radio halos , although the one seen in the nvss data of abell  399 requires confirmation .",
    "this halo in abell  399 appears to follow an edge apparent in the x - ray images , and is associated with harder x - ray emission .",

    "this region appears also hotter than the region on the opposite side of the cluster core , and the temperature distributions predicted for relaxed clusters by numerical simulations . *",
    "the large scale environment around the binary system appears surprisingly empty .",
    "there is no evidence in the galaxy distribution and rass data for the presence of other clusters nearby .",
    "the ` substructure ' _ xmm - newton _ finds in the core cluster regions can not be explained by the tidal field generated by the presence of the other cluster . on larger scales , ( 10 - 20 )",
    "arcmin@xmath47(0.8 - 1.6 )  mpc from the cluster centres , tidal forces become gradually far more important , in shaping the gas distributions .",
    "however , we find that the extensions of the gases towards the other member of the system seen in the _ xmm - newton _ data can not again be solely due to their mutual interactions . if the gases were extended by gravitational forces , their temperature should have been lower than what we observe .",
    "it is apparent that an additional driving force is required .",
    "we also find that the properties of abell  399/401 can not be reproduced by scenarios that either involve off - centre cluster collisions , or that speculate that they have been through each other once .",
    "an offset collision provides the only single mechanism which might explain all the properties of the system , but that it does nt seem consistent with the observed large separation and limited disturbance of the clusters at large radii from the cluster centres . on the other hand our analysis finds evidence for increased flux and temperature in the region in - between the two .",
    "it appears that the two have already stated interacting mildly , and that we are witnessing a compression region between them .",
    "the most possible explanation for the properties we find in the core region of the clusters is that they are due to each ones past merger activity .",

    "( 2003 ) to explain the unequal system abell  1750 .",

    "additionally , they confirm the presence of features like the indentaion and shock wave to the east of abell  399 , as being produced during the infall of a smaller group .",
