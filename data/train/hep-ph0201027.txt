    "it is well known that in the processes of @xmath0 meson photoproduction on protons at high energies the photon - gluon fusion partonic subprocess dominates @xcite . in the framework of general factorization approach of qcd",
    "the @xmath0 photoproduction cross section depends on the gluon distribution function in a proton , the hard amplitude of @xmath6-pair production as well as the mechanism of a creation colorless final state with quantum numbers of the @xmath0 meson .",
    "such a way , we suppose that the soft interactions in the initial state are described by introducing a gluon distribution function , the hard partonic amplitude is calculated using perturbative theory of qcd at order in @xmath7 , where @xmath8 , and the soft process of the @xmath6-pair transition into @xmath0 meson is described in nonrelativistic approximation using series in the small parameters @xmath1 and @xmath9 ( relative velocity of the quarks in @xmath0 meson ) . as it is statement in nonrelativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) @xcite , there are colour singlet mechanism , where @xmath6-pair is hardly produced in the colour singlet state , and colour octet mechanism , where @xmath6-pair is produced in the color octet state and at long distance it transforms into final colour singlet state in soft process . however , as it was shown in paper @xcite , the data from hera collider @xcite in the wide region of @xmath4 and @xmath10 may be described well in the framework of the colour singlet model and not colour octet contribution is needed . based on",
    "the above mentioned result we will take into account in our analysis only the colour singlet model contribution in the @xmath0 meson photoproduction @xcite .",
    "we consider a role of a proton gluon distribution function in the @xmath0 photoproduction in the framework of the conventional parton model as well as in the framework of the @xmath2-factorization approach @xcite .",
    "last one is based on bfkl evolution equation @xcite , which takes into account large terms proportional to @xmath11 and @xmath12 opposite to dglap evolution equation @xcite , where only large logarithmic terms @xmath13 are taken into account . in the process of the @xmath0 meson photoproduction one",
    "has @xmath14 and @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the @xmath0 meson mass , @xmath17 is the square of a total energy of colliding particles in center of mass frame .",
    "nowadays , there are two approaches in calculating of @xmath0 meson or heavy quark production cross sections at high energies . in the conventional parton model",
    "@xcite it is suggested that hadronic cross section @xmath19 and relevant partonic cross section @xmath20 are connected as follows : @xmath21 where @xmath22 , @xmath23 is the collinear gluon distribution function in a proton , @xmath24 is the fraction of a proton momentum , @xmath25 is the typical scale of a hard process .",
    "the @xmath25 dependence of the gluon distribution @xmath23 is described by dglap evolution equation @xcite . in the region of very high",
    "@xmath17 one has @xmath26 .",
    "this fact leads to bfkl evolution equation @xcite for the unintegrated gluon distribution function @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the gluon virtuality .",
    "the unintegrated gluon distribution function can be related to the conventional gluon distribution by @xmath29 the gluon 4-momentum is presented as follows @xmath30 where @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "so called bfkl gluon is off mass - shell and it has polarization vector along its transverse momentum such as @xmath34 . in @xmath2-factorization approach hadronic and partonic cross sections are related by the following condition : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is @xmath0 meson photoproduction on bfkl gluon , @xmath37 is azimuthal angle in the transverse @xmath38 plane between vector @xmath39 and fixed @xmath40 axis .",
    "at the present time an exact form of the unintegrated gluon distribution @xmath41 is unknown yet because the relevant experimental analysis of the experimental data has never been carried out .",
    "there are several theoretical approximations for @xmath41 , which are based on solving bfkl evolution equation @xcite . in the region of",
    "very small @xmath42 and moderate @xmath43 ( @xmath44 gev@xmath45 ) , which is relevant for @xmath46 photoproduction at hera , all parameterizations @xcite are approximately coincide ( see , for example , discussions in @xcite and @xcite ) . for our purposes , we will use the unintegrated gluon distribution , which was obtained in the paper @xcite .",
    "the proposed method lies upon a straightforward perturbative solution of the bfkl equation where the collinear gluon density @xmath23 is used as the boundary condition in the integral form ( 2 ) .",
    "technically , the unintegrated gluon distribution is calculated as a convolution of collinear gluon distribution @xmath23 with universal weight factors : @xmath47 where @xmath48 , \\mbox { at } { \\bf q}^2_{\\top}\\le   \\mu^2 \\\\ & & { \\cal g}(\\eta , { \\bf q}^2_{\\top } , \\mu^2)= \\frac{\\bar\\alpha_s}{\\eta { \\bf q}^2_{\\top } } i_0 \\left[2\\sqrt{\\bar\\alpha_s\\ln ( \\frac{1}{\\eta})\\ln ( \\frac{{\\bf q}^2_{\\top}}{\\mu^2})}\\right ] , \\mbox { at } { \\bf q}^2_{\\top } > \\mu^2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath49 and @xmath50 stand for bessel functions ( of real and imaginary arguments , respectively ) , and @xmath51 . as a input function @xmath23 in ( 5,6 )",
    "we use the standard grv parameterization @xcite . to test the method of calculation for @xmath41 we compare input collinear gluon distribution @xmath23 and collinear gluon distribution @xmath52 , which is obtained using formula ( 2 ) from the unintegrated distribution @xmath41 after integration over @xmath43 . in the figure 1 the result of our calculation for the ratio @xmath53",
    "it is visible , that at @xmath54 the ratio @xmath55 does not differ from 1 more than 1 - 2 % .",
    "note , that in a process of the @xmath0 photoproduction on protons @xmath56 ( @xmath16 is the mass of @xmath0 meson ) , and one has @xmath57 at @xmath58 gev .",
    "there are six feynman diagrams ( figure 2 ) which describere partonic process @xmath60 at the leading order in @xmath1 and @xmath5 . in the framework of the colour singlet model and nonrelativistic approximation the production of @xmath0 meson",
    "is considered as the production of a quark - antiquark system in the colour singlet state with orbital momentum @xmath61 and spin momentum @xmath62 . the binding energy and relative momentum of quarks in the @xmath0",
    "are neglected .",
    "such a way @xmath63 and @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is 4-momentum of the @xmath0 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 are 4-momenta of quark and antiquark . taking into account the formalism of the projection operator @xcite the amplitude of the process @xmath68 may be obtained from the amplitude of the process @xmath69 after replacement : @xmath70 where @xmath71 , @xmath72 is 4-vector of the @xmath0 polarization , @xmath73 is the color factor , @xmath74 is the nonrelativistic meson wave function at the origin .",

    "it is easy to find the differential cross section in the parton model too : @xmath109 however , making calculations in the parton model we use formula ( 20 ) , where integration over @xmath43 and @xmath37 is performed numerically , instead of ( 22 ) .",
    "this method fixes common normalization factor for both approaches and gives direct opportunity to study effects connected with virtuality of the initial bfkl gluon in the partonic amplitude .",
    "after we fixed selection of the gluon distribution function @xmath23 there are two parameters only , which values determine the common normalization factor of the cross section under consideration : @xmath74 and @xmath110 .",
    "the value of the @xmath0 meson wave function at the origin may be calculated in a potential model or obtained from experimental well known decay width @xmath111 . in our calculation",
    "we used the following choice @xmath112 gev@xmath113 as the same as in ref .",
    "concerning a charmed quark mass , the situation is not clear up to the end . from one hand , in the nonrelativistic approximation one has @xmath114 , but there are many evidences to take smaller value of a c - quark mass in the amplitude of a hard process , for example @xmath115 gev .",
    "taking into consideration above mentioned we perform calculations as at @xmath115 gev as well as at @xmath116 gev .",
    "the cinematic region under consideration is determined by the following conditions : @xmath117 and @xmath118 gev@xmath45 , which correspond h1 and zeus collaborations data @xcite .",
    "we assume that the contribution of the colour octet mechanism is large at the @xmath119 only . in the region of the small values of @xmath120 the contribution of the resolved photon processes @xcite as well as the charm excitation processes @xcite may be large too . all of these contributions are not in our consideration .",
    "figure 3 shows the ratio @xmath121 as a function of @xmath28 at the different @xmath122 . as well as it was necessary to expect ratio ( 23 ) decrease with growth of @xmath123 and the faster than less the value of @xmath122 .",
    "figures 46 show our results which were obtained as in the conventional parton model as well as in the @xmath2-factorization approach at two values of a charmed quark mass .",
    "the dependence of the results on selection of a hard scale parameter @xmath124 is much less than the dependence on selection of a c - quark mass .",
    "we put @xmath125 in a gluon distribution function and in a running constant @xmath7 .",
    "figure 4 shows the dependence of the total @xmath0 photoproduction cross section on @xmath126 .",
    "it is visible that the difference between the parton model prediction and the result of @xmath2-factorization approach is much less than between the results obtained at different values of c - quark mass in the both models . at the @xmath116",
    "gev the obtained cross sections in 1.5 2 times are less than experimental data @xcite , but at the @xmath115 gev the theoretical curves lie even a shade higher of the experimental points .",
    "there are not contradictions between the theoretical predictions and data for the @xmath10-spectrum of the @xmath0 mesons .",
    "figure 5 shows that the experimental points lie inside the theoretical corridor as in the parton model as in the @xmath2-factorization approach .",
    "the count of a transverse momentum of the bfkl gluons in the @xmath2-factorization approach results in a flattening of the @xmath4-spectrum of the @xmath0 as contrasted to by predictions of parton model . for the first time on this effect",
    "was indicated in the article @xcite , and later in the articles @xcite .",
    "figure 6 shows the result of our calculation for the @xmath4-spectrum of the @xmath0 mesons . using the @xmath2-factorization approach we have obtained the more hard @xmath4-spectrum of the @xmath0 than it have been predicted in the lo parton model .",
    "it is visible that at large values of @xmath4 only the @xmath2-factorization approach gives correct description of the data @xcite .",
    "however , it is impossible to consider this visible effect as the direct indication on a nontrivial developments of the small - x physics . in the article @xcite",
    "was shown that calculation in the nlo approximation gives more hard @xmath4-spectrum of the @xmath0 meson too , which one will be agreed the data at the large @xmath4 .",
    "as it was mentioned above , the main difference between the @xmath2-factorization approach and the conventional parton model is nontrivial polarization of bfkl gluon .",
    "it is obviously , that such spin condition of the initial gluon should result in observed spin effects during birth of the polarized @xmath0 meson .",
    "we have performed calculations for the spin parameter @xmath5 , as a function @xmath10 or @xmath4 in the conventional parton model and in the @xmath2-factorization approach : @xmath127",
    "@xmath128 here @xmath129 is the total @xmath0 production cross section , @xmath130 is the production cross section for the longitudinal polarized @xmath0 mesons , @xmath131 is the production cross section for the transverse polarized @xmath0 mesons .",
    "the parameter @xmath5 controls the angle distribution for leptons in the decay @xmath132 in the @xmath0 meson rest frame : @xmath133 figure 7 shows the parameter @xmath134 , which is calculated in the parton model ( curve 2 ) and in the @xmath2-factorization approach ( curve 1 ) .",
    "we see that both curves lie near zero at @xmath135 and increase at @xmath136 .",
    "the large difference between predictions is visible only at @xmath119 where our consideration is not adequate .",
    "let s remark , that parameter is gentle depends on mass of a charmed quark and we demonstrate here only outcomes obtained at the @xmath116 .    for the parameter @xmath137 we have found strongly opposite predictions in the parton model and in the @xmath2-factorization approach , as it is visible in figure 8 .",
    "the parton model predicts that @xmath0 mesons should have transverse polarizations at the large @xmath4 ( @xmath138 at @xmath139 gev@xmath45 ) , but @xmath2-factorization approach predicts that @xmath0 mesons should be longitudinally polarized ( @xmath140 at @xmath139 gev@xmath45 ) .",
    "nowadays , a result of nlo parton model calculation in the case of the polarized @xmath0 meson photoproduction is unknown . it should be an interesting subject of future investigations . if the count of the nlo corrections will not change predictions of the lo parton model for @xmath137 , the experimental measurement of this spin effect will be a direct signal about bfkl gluon dynamics .    nowadays",
    ", the experimental data on @xmath46 polarization in photoproduction at large @xmath4 are absent .",
    "however there are similar data from cdf collaboration @xcite , where @xmath0 and @xmath141 @xmath4-spectra and polarizations have been measured . opposite the case of @xmath0 photoproduction , the hadroproduction dada needs to take into account the large colour - octet contribution in order to explain @xmath0 and @xmath141 production at tevatron in the conventional collinear parton model .",
    "the relative weight of colour - octet contribution may be smaller if we use @xmath2-factorization approach , as it was shown recently in @xcite .",
    "the predicted using collinear parton model transverse polarization of @xmath0 at large @xmath4 is not supported by the cdf data , which can be roughly explain in @xmath2-factorization approach @xcite . in conclusion ,",
    "the number of theoretical uncertainties in the case of @xmath0 meson hadroproduction is much more than in the case of photoproduction and they need more complicated investigation , that is why the future experimental analysis of @xmath0 photoproduction at thera will be clean check of the collinear parton model and @xmath2-factorization approach .",
