    "strong gravitational lens systems , in which background sources are multiply imaged by foreground galaxies , are important for two main reasons .",
    "first , the lensing effect magnifies the background source ; although the surface brightness is conserved , the area increases and we can observe background sources with typically 510 times better signal - to - noise than without the lensing .",
    "second , the lensing effect allows us to probe the mass distribution of the lensing galaxy , on scales from the overall mass profile down to the scales of individual stars .",
    "general reviews of strong lensing and its applications relevant to this work are given by kochanek ( 2004 ) , courbin , saha & schechter ( 2002 ) , zackrisson & riehm ( 2010 ) , bartelmann ( 2010 ) and jackson ( 2013 ) .",
    "lens systems in which the background source is a quasar were the first class of systems to be discovered , mostly in radio surveys ( walsh , carswell & weymann 1979 ; hewitt et al .",
    "1988 ; browne et al . 2003 ) but later in optical surveys ( e.g. wisotzki et al . 1993",
    "; inada et al .",
    "lens systems with optical , or `` radio - quiet '' , quasars as the source now dominate the sample of strongly lensed quasars . the radio - selected sample is mostly composed of the 22 lenses from the cosmic lens all - sky survey ( class ; myers et al . 2003 ; browne et al .",
    "2003 ) together with smaller samples from the mit - greenbank ( mg ) and southern surveys ( e.g. hewitt et al .",
    "1992 ; winn et al .",
    "this sample has not expanded significantly in the last 15 years , because of the difficulty  in the era before the square kilometre array  of conducting more sensitive wide - field radio surveys at the necessary sub - arcsecond resolution for lens discovery .    in order to increase the size of the sample of quasar lenses observed at radio wavelengths",
    ", we can use the fact that all quasars are likely to have radio emission at some level .",
    "for example , white et al .",
    "( 2007 ) performed a stacking analysis at the positions of radio-``quiet '' quasars from the first 20-cm radio survey ( becker et al .",
    "1995 ) and found that quasars not detected at the 1-mjy level are likely , on average , to have radio flux densities which fall with decreasing optical brightness to @xmath2jy at @xmath3 .",
    "this is within reach of the new generation of telescopes such as the karl g. jansky very large array ( vla ) and the extended multi - element remote linked interferometer ( e - merlin ) .",
    "we began a programme ( wucknitz & volino 2008 , jackson 2011 ) to investigate four - image quasar lens systems without current radio detections , and achieved a successful detection , at around the 20 - 30@xmath1jy level , of lensed images of the background quasar in the cluster lens system sdss  j1004 + 4112 , as well as detections of lensed images at a brighter level in the lens system rxj  1131@xmath01231 .",
    "there are three main motivations for radio observations of the radio emission from radio-``quiet '' quasar lens systems .",
    "the first is that the emission mechanisms of radio - quiet quasars are not well understood , and in particular it is not clear how far the mechanisms which power radio - loud quasars  accretion and the formation of a powerful jet close to a black hole  also apply to radio - quiet quasars . in sources of intermediate flux density , jets characteristic of ordinary active nuclei",
    "are seen ( blundell & beasley 1998 , leipski et al .",
    "2006 ) and the radio sources appear to be variable ( barvainis et al . 2005 ) . both of these observations suggest that the agn paradigm applies to these objects . in fainter cases ( @xmath41  mjy at 1.4  ghz at redshifts of a few tenths )",
    "however , condon et al . ( 2013 ) argue that star formation is the primary mechanism for the emission .",
    "this is inferred from an analysis showing that the radio luminosity function of qsos turns up sharply below @xmath5  w@xmath6hz@xmath7 and suggesting that a second population emerges at these luminosities .",
    "it is also possible that a different emission mechanism is at work in the core of the sources .",
    "blundell & kuncic ( 2007 ) suggest the presence of optically - thin bremsstrahlung emission ( although see steenbrugge et al . 2011 for evidence against this view ) and laor & behar ( 2008 ) propose the possibility of emission from magnetically - heated coronae , rather than a classical agn source .",
    "it is important to achieve high - resolution radio imaging of these sources in order to separate the possibilities .",
    "this is typically very difficult to achieve with current long - baseline interferometers in very faint objects .",
    "however , the use of lensing magnification provides a way to detect otherwise unobservable objects .",
    "the second motivation is that radio and optical observations are subject to different propagation effects .",
    "the main such effect in the optical is microlensing due to stars in the lens galaxy , which produces measurable flux changes because the size of the optical source is very small .",
    "repeated optical monitoring can reveal the flux density variations associated with the movement of the source with respect to the microlensing caustic patterns ( irwin et al .",
    "1989 , wisotzki et al . 1993 ; burud et al . 2002 ; poindexter , morgan & kochanek 2008 ; blackburne et al .",
    "2011 ; muoz et al .",
    "2011 ) . at radio wavelengths ,",
    "the source is larger , and therefore much less susceptible to microlensing ; hence , comparison between the two wavebands can reveal the effects of microlensing directly . in the radio ,",
    "the only significant propagation effect is scattering by ionized media ( koopmans et al .",
    "claims exist for radio microlensing ( koopmans et al . 2000 ) which could also be explained by other propagation effects . in principle ,",
    "free - free absorption is also possible ( mittal et al .",
    "2007 ) although the electron columns are likely to be too small in all but exceptional cases . ] .",
    "this seems to be particularly noticeable in a few cases , such as class  b0128 + 437 ( phillips et al .",
    "2000 , biggs et al .",
    "2004 ) but should in principle decrease strongly at higher radio frequencies .",
    "a corresponding problem at optical wavelengths is extinction by dust in the lensing galaxy , which can be used to learn about the properties of the dust if the intrinsic fluxes are known ( e.g. jackson , xanthopoulos & browne 2000 , eliasdttir et al .",
    "2006 , ostman et al .",
    "radio wavelengths therefore provide an important input to any programme which aims to disentangle the effects of substructure in the lens galaxy from those of microlensing and extinction .",
    "the third motivation for radio observations of four - image gravitational lens systems is their potential to probe substructure in the lens galaxies . in principle ,",
    "quasar lens systems are useful for probing small - scale structure within the lens potential , down to 10@xmath8 and below ( mao & schneider 1998 ) , because the flux density of the lensed image can be perturbed by small - scale mass structures close to the corresponding ray path .",
    "such sub - galactic scale structures are important predictions of cold dark matter ( cdm ) models .",
    "initially they were thought not to be present in required quantities in the milky way ( moore et al .",
    "1999 , klypin et al .",
    "the situation is now less clear , as a population of faint milky way satellites have since been discovered ( belokurov et al .",
    "2006 ; zucker et al . 2006",
    "; koposov et al .",
    "2015 ) . the milky way halo mass is a critical variable ( wang et al . 2012 ; kafle et al .",
    "2014 ) as the predicted halo population is sensitive to it . in lens systems ,",
    "the flux density of the lensed images is particularly sensitive to small structures , because it depends on the second derivative of the lensing potential , as opposed to the image positions which depend on the first derivative .",
    "the usual evidence for a detection of substructure is therefore a set of image flux ratios which can not be fit by smooth models .",
    "more particularly , four - image lenses in cusp configurations ( where the source is close to the cusp of the astroid caustic ) and fold configurations ( resulting from the source being close to the caustic fold ) give clear theoretical expectations for image flux ratios which must be obeyed by any smooth model . in cusp lenses , there are three close images and the middle image is expected to have the brightness of the sum of the outer two ( schneider & weiss 1992 ) ; in fold lenses , the two close images are expected to have the same flux ( keeton , gaudi & petters 2003 ; congdon , keeton & nordgren 2008 ) . because of optical microlensing , radio lens systems have traditionally been used for this work ( mao & schneider 1998 , fassnacht et al .",
    "1999 , metcalf & zhao 2002 , metcalf 2005 , kratzer et al .",
    "the statistics of such objects were analysed by dalal & kochanek ( 2002 ) who found a fraction of between 0.6% and 7% of mass in @xmath9 substructures at the radius probed by the lensing .",
    "more recent theoretical work has used more realistic treatment of lens galaxies via the use of numerical simulations ( bradac et al . 2004 , amara 2006 , macci et al .",
    "2006 , xu et al . 2009 ) .",
    "the conclusions are generally that there is , if anything , an excess of substructure over what is predicted to exist in cdm ( though see metcalf & amara 2012 , xu et al .",
    "at the same time , analyses of individual lens systems have yielded constraints on substructures at the @xmath10 level ( e.g. fadely & keeton 2012 ) .",
    "the major problem in using quasar lenses to constrain substructure has been the lack of large enough samples of radio - loud four - image lenses ; the seven studied by dalal & kochanek in 2002 have formed the sample for most subsequent investigations .",
    "possible solutions to this problem include the use of mid - infrared fluxes ( chiba et al . 2005 ; fadely & keeton 2011 ) assuming that the mid - ir source is large enough not to be subject to microlensing ( but see sluse et al .",
    "an alternative approach is to use the narrow line region of quasars ( moustakas & metcalf 2003 , sugai et al .",
    "2007 , nierenberg et al . 2014 ) which should also be large enough to be unaffected by microlensing , or submillimetre observations in the case of new lenses from herschel and the spt ( hezaveh et al . 2013 ) .",
    "a further alternative is to perform lens reconstruction of systems with extended sources ( warren & dye 2003 , dye & warren 2005 , koopmans 2005 , vegetti et al .",
    "2009 , vegetti et al .",
    "cases of substructure detections have already been reported from these works , although the sensitivity is mainly towards the higher - mass end of the substructure mass function ; quasar lenses are thus likely to be usefully complementary to this method .",
    "this work presents a continuation of a programme to detect and image faint radio sources in gravitational lens systems .",
    "its aim is to increase the number of four - image lenses with detected radio fluxes , both to increase the sample sizes of quasar lens systems suitable for the investigation of sub - galactic scale substructures in the lens , and to begin the study of the very faint radio sources which are imaged by the foreground lens galaxies .",
    "where necessary we use a standard flat cosmology with @xmath11 and @xmath12kms@xmath7mpc@xmath7 .",
    "our target sample includes all known gravitational lens systems with four lensed images , no detected radio emission above the @xmath131  mjy level reached in large - scale sky surveys such as the first and nvss 1.4-ghz surveys ( becker et al .",
    "1995 , condon et al .",
    "1998 ) , and with declination @xmath14 for accessibility to the vla and e - merlin radio arrays .",
    "there are 13 of these in current compilations such as the castles ( kochanek et al .",
    "1998 ) and masterlens ( moustakas et al . 2012 ) lists , which represents a potential factor of 3 improvement in statistics if radio flux densities can be measured for all of them .",
    "one of these objects , sdss  j1004 + 4112 , was already detected by jackson ( 2011 ) using the vla in the lower resolution c - configuration .",
    "this is a wide - separation object ( inada et al .",
    "2003a ) resulting from the lensing action of a cluster , whose mass distribution is correspondingly more difficult to model .",
    "most such objects , however , are lensed by individual galaxies ; we have in this preliminary phase used the vla ( resolution @xmath1303 at 5  ghz ) to investigate the wider - separation objects within this sample .",
    "a further object , rxj  1131 - 1231 , was previously detected by wucknitz & volino ( 2007 ) in archival vla data , and subsequently with the vla and merlin ( although not with vlbi ) .",
    "table [ observations ] shows a summary of the lens systems observed ( including , for completeness , sdss  j1004 + 4112 ) together with the source and lens redshifts and other observational information .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     motivated by the residuals observed in the point - source model , we have again fitted a model in which a gaussian - shaped extended source is lensed .",
    "provided that the source size is not very small , neither it nor the source shape is well constrained ( table [ models ] ) .",
    "the modelled shear is large , suggesting that we are seeing the influence of the cluster to the south .",
    "the good overall fit to the data , @xmath15=3518 for 2290 degrees of freedom , gives no significant evidence for effects of substructure in the lens galaxy .",
    "sdss  j0924 + 0219 ( inada et al .",
    "2003b ) is a very interesting object because it has such a large optical flux anomaly , almost certainly as a result of microlensing ( morgan et al .",
    "this anomaly decreases with increasing observation wavelength ( floyd , bate & webster 2009 ) allowing the size of the accretion disk to be measured , but the anomaly persists over a period of @xmath137  years ( faure et al .",
    "2011 ) raising the possibility that some of it may be due to the effects of lensing by substructure .",
    "although we detect the object at a reasonable level of significance ( fig .",
    "[ fig_0924 ] ) , we unfortunately do not have sufficient signal - to - noise , in the three hours of observation time allocated to this object , to measure the flux densities separately . at a total flux density of @xmath16jy ,",
    "this is by far the weakest of the objects studied . using an isothermal model , plus external shear , fitted to the positions reported by inada et al .",
    "( 2003b ) , we obtain magnifications for the four components ( a , b , c and d ) of approximately 13 , 5 , 5 and 11 .",
    "our overall flux density of @xmath17jy implies an unlensed source flux density of about 1.5@xmath1jy .",
    "this is the second faintest radio source yet detected , the faintest being sdss  j1004 + 4112 ( jackson 2011 ) ; further observations of the sample of radio - quiet quasars are likely to yield the first detected nano - jy radio source .",
    "jy / beam , and a restoring beam of 696@xmath18416  mas in pa  @xmath19 .",
    "the object is detected , but individual flux densities for the images are impossible to measure .",
    "image registration to archival hst / nicmos data ( contours ) has been done by eye , but this procedure is not well - defined to better than the absolute astrometry of the hst image.,width=377 ]",
    "we detect the lensing galaxy in only one of the four objects : rx  j0911 + 0551 , at a level of 18@xmath1jy .",
    "the radio flux density of the lensing galaxies in the other three objects is @xmath20jy ( 3@xmath21 ) .",
    "the lensing galaxy flux density in rx  j0911 + 0551 corresponds to a luminosity of @xmath22  w@xmath6hz@xmath7 , which is at the top of the range that can plausibly be attributed to star formation ; this range is bounded by the @xmath23  w@xmath6hz@xmath7 of the milky way and 10@xmath24  w@xmath6hz@xmath7 for extreme star - forming galaxies .",
    "it is also close to the boundary between star - forming radio emitters and agns found by kimball et al .",
    "( 2011 ) in their study of radio luminosity functions of nearby ( @xmath25 ) agn .",
    "there is no evidence for ongoing star formation in the lens galaxy , which seems to be an early - type galaxy , in other wavebands .",
    "for example , burud et al . (",
    "1998 ) conducted optical and near - ir imaging and found that the lensing galaxy has a similar red colour to that of nearby members of the cluster of which it is part .",
    "this work has resulted in the measurement of radio flux densities , and in some cases resolved radio structure , in a significant number of radio-``quiet '' lensed quasar systems .",
    "such radio sources , if unlensed , would be beyond the reach of current instruments in all but exceptional observing times , and are objects whose study will only become routine with the ska .",
    "the luminosity of an object of intrinsic flux density of 1@xmath1jy and flat spectral index is about 1.0@xmath26whz@xmath7 at @xmath27 , 5@xmath26whz@xmath7 at @xmath28 and 30@xmath26whz@xmath7 at @xmath29 , orders of magnitude below what is typically accessible with current surveys except at low redshift ( e.g. fig . 4 of condon et al .",
    "previous studies of radio - quiet quasars have focused on optically bright quasars , such as the palomar green sample ( kellermann et al .",
    "1994 ) . in accordance with the radio - optical correlation noticed by white et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , these objects have typical radio flux densities of a few hundred @xmath1jy , two orders of magnitude brighter than the intrinsic flux densities of the objects studied here .",
    "we have observed four of the 15 known optically - selected , four - image quasar lenses with @xmath30 , and all of them have intrinsic radio flux density of between 1 and 5@xmath1jy . of the other nine ,",
    "three are known to have significant radio emission .",
    "pg1115 + 080 has vla archival data at 8.4  ghz taken in the compact ( d ) configuration , which yield a total radio flux density of 153@xmath3117  @xmath1jy , although the resolution of a few arcseconds does not allow the flux density of individual components to be determined .",
    "however , the likely magnifications in this lens system suggest that the intrinsic flux density of the source is also a few @xmath1jy .",
    "a similar result can be derived for the lens system rx  j1131@xmath01321 , which was found to have significant radio emission by wucknitz & volino ( 2008 ) .",
    "finally , h1413 + 117 is a radio - intermediate object which has been studied with the vla by kayser et al .",
    "further lenses from the cosmos survey ( faure et al .",
    "2008 , jackson 2008 ) do not have significant radio emission ( schinnerer et al .",
    "2007 , schinnerer et al . 2010 ) in the vla - cosmos survey , and three quad lens systems from the sloan quasar lens search ( sdss  j1138 + 0314 , sdss  j1251 + 2935 , sdss  j1330 + 1810 ) do not yet have deep radio imaging .",
    "it is therefore likely that at least half of optically - selected quasar lens systems will show radio emission at the micro - jansky level , if examined carefully , and a more complete census will be the focus of future work .",
    "the existing data are plotted in fig .",
    "[ radopt ] .",
    "the radio fluxes have been derived from the literature ( see the figure caption ) , with in some cases a limit of 1  mjy inferred from their absence from the first 1.4-ghz catalogue .",
    "the current sample is small .",
    "however , we note that the median radio flux density inferred by white et al .",
    "( 2007 ) from their stacking analysis is about 50 - 70  @xmath1jy at @xmath32 .",
    "this , combined with the distribution of detections in our optically - selected sample , suggests that there is a large scatter in radio flux densities at this optical magnitude , if not an outright bimodality .",
    "there are a number of theoretical models for the origin of radio emission in radio quiet quasars , each of which makes rather different predictions for what should be observed .",
    "the first possibility is that of a smaller version of a radio - loud quasar , where a flat - spectrum radio core and steeper - spectrum radio jet emission are present in some ratio ( urry & padovani 1995 , ulvestad et al . 2005 ) . in this case",
    ", we would expect steep - spectrum emission on scales of parsecs to tens of parsecs in addition to a compact , flat - spectrum radio core .",
    "a second possibility is the emission from radio starbursts in a similar manner to nearby examples such as m82 ( e.g. condon et al .",
    "this emission is expected to be optically thin synchrotron from supernova remnants , but should extend over most of the galaxy disk and therefore have a characteristic size of about 1 arcsecond , or 5 - 10  kpc ; studies of star - forming radio sources in the hdf , with mean redshifts around 1 , have shown that the radio emission nearly always displays a similar characteristic size ( muxlow et al .",
    "alternatively , the radio emission could be produced by thermal processes close to the accretion disk .",
    "suggestions for this include optically thin free - free emission from a disk wind ( blundell & kuncic 2007 ) and emission from magnetically - heated coronae ( laor & behar 2008 ) . in both cases",
    "the emission would be expected to originate close to the centre . in the case of disk winds ,",
    "this scale is likely to be at least 0.11pc , but for magnetically heated coronae the scale would be smaller . in both these cases , however , the radio spectral index should be approximately flat .",
    "we can use our data to confront the models in a number of ways .",
    "the first relevant result is the source sizes implied by our lens modelling , which are of the order of 70  pc in hs  0810 + 2554 . in he  0435@xmath01223 we find a characteristic size which is more uncertain , but probably greater than a few milliarcseconds and certainly less than 200  mas ( @xmath42  kpc ) . in rx  j0911 + 0551 we again detect a significantly extended source , but whose size is likely to be 100 - 150mas ( @xmath131  kpc ) rather than the larger values which would be expected for a typical star - forming region in a radio source .",
    "either we have an unrepresentative sample , or the star - formation model is disfavoured compared to the non - thermal agn hypothesis .",
    "this is in contrast to the inference of star - formation as the cause of the radio emission , made by wucknitz & volino in the case of rx  j1131@xmath01231 .",
    "a definitive test should be available using vlbi , as a non - thermal source should contain high - brightness emission at the @xmath1jy level which is detectable with current vlbi sensitivities .    a second , although rather more equivocal , result concerns the measured spectral indices .",
    "the spectral index of the radio emission in hs  0810 + 2554 appears to be steep , consistent with synchrotron emission from either a non - thermal source or a star - forming component . both the spectral index and the characteristic size disfavour coronal emission and emission from disk winds , which would be expected to be relatively flat - spectrum and to be emitted from a smaller region .",
    "however , the vla and e - merlin observations of rx  j0911 + 0551 may be consistent with such models . because the spectral index limit is currently relatively loose ( @xmath33 ) ,",
    "further e - merlin observations are needed to make a more definite statement .",
    "radio flux densities in four - image lens systems are important because they potentially give indications of substructure in lensing galaxies ( or along the line of sight ) , in the form of flux anomalies ( mao & schneider 1998 ; dalal & kochanek 2002 ) . in particular , violations of the cusp and fold relation allow us to quantify the levels of substructure present ( e.g. xu et al .",
    "2009 , xu et al .",
    "flux ratios between images can also be affected by propagation effects ( scattering in the case of the radio waveband ) , microlensing ( in the case when the source is smaller than the intrinsic size of the einstein radius of stars in the lensing galaxy , or about 1  @xmath1arcsec ) , variability ( in the case of a source which varies significantly over the time delay between the images ) and source size ( which can affect flux ratios , e.g. amara et al .",
    "2006 ; metcalf & amara 2012 ) . the use of cusp and fold relations , rather than the observation of disagreement with a smooth model , is important because otherwise the effect of substructure on the image flux ratios can be partially absorbed by varying the smooth model .",
    "we detect no new evidence in our objects for substructure . indeed , the flux ratios of rx  j0911 + 0551 obey the cusp relation within the errors of the measured radio flux densities",
    ". the flux ratios of the fold system hs  0810 + 2554 are also consistent with a smooth model , as the brightnesses of the merging images are equal to within the errors , unlike the optical case in which microlensing affects one of the images .",
    "the case of he  0435@xmath01223 is more interesting .",
    "here we obtain flux density ratios which are inconsistent with not only the optical , but also the mid - ir bands .",
    "there are a number of explanations for this which we do not favour .",
    "radio microlensing could affect the radio flux densities , but would require a very small radio source size ( microarcseconds rather than milliarcseconds ) .",
    "variability of the radio source , together with a time - delay , is also possible .",
    "however , intrinsic variations in typical radio - faint quasars are on timescales of several weeks to months with fluctuations at the @xmath34% level ( barvainis et al . 2005 ) . in order to reproduce these observations , a variation in the source flux of @xmath1340%",
    "would be required within the time - delay scales measured by courbin et al .",
    "( 2011 ) ( @xmath06.5 and @xmath014.3 days for b - d and c - d respectively ) .",
    "flux anomalies due to variations in the mid - ir are still less likely , because the @xmath35-band is expected to have a significant contribution from a dusty torus , whose size is @xmath36 , implying a light crossing - time of several years or more .",
    "differential extinction due to dust at non - radio wavelengths is not a likely culprit , as the colours ( wisotzki et al .",
    "2002 ) and the continuum slopes ( morgan et al . 2005 ; wisotzki et al .",
    "2004 ) are nearly identical for the four lensed images . while substructure can be used to explain the various flux ratio anomalies seen in the optical , mid - ir , and radio , it may prove difficult and would perhaps require fine - tuning to simultaneously explain all the observations with substructure alone .",
    "instead , at least some of the explanation is likely to be the effects of finite source sizes ; especially given the results in the other objects , an intrinsic radio source size of order a few parsecs is the explanation that we favour .",

    "<S> we present vla detections of radio emission in four four - image gravitational lens systems with quasar sources : hs  0810 + 2554 , rx  j0911 + 0511 , he  0435@xmath01223 and sdss  j0924 + 0219 , and e - merlin observations of two of the systems . </S>",
    "<S> the first three are detected at a high level of significance , and sdss  j0924 + 0219 is detected . </S>",
    "<S> hs  0810 + 2554 is resolved , allowing us for the first time to achieve 10-mas resolution of the source frame in the structure of a radio quiet quasar . </S>",
    "<S> the others are unresolved or marginally resolved . </S>",
    "<S> all four objects are among the faintest radio sources yet detected , with intrinsic flux densities in the range 15@xmath1jy ; such radio objects , if unlensed , will only be observable routinely with the square kilometre array . </S>",
    "<S> the observations of hs  0810 + 2554 , which is also detected with e - merlin , strongly suggest the presence of a mini - agn , with a radio core and milliarcsecond scale jet . </S>",
    "<S> the flux densities of the lensed images in all but he  0435@xmath01223 are consistent with smooth galaxy lens models without the requirement for smaller - scale substructure in the model , although some interesting anomalies are seen between optical and radio flux densities . these are probably due to microlensing effects in the optical .    </S>",
