    "various observations strongly indicate that at the present epoch the universe is in a phase of accelerated expansion @xcite .",
    "this accelerated expansion of the universe might be caused by a non - zero value of the cosmological constant @xcite , or an evolving scalar field such as quintessence @xcite , phantom field @xcite , tachyon field @xcite etc . for a detailed review of dark energy",
    "see for example ref.@xcite .",
    "quintessence refers to a scalar field whose lagrangian is of the form @xmath4 in this paper we investigate the consequences of a scalar field whose lagrangian is given by , @xmath5 without going into the details of the fundamental origin of this form , we use this form of the action at a phenomenological level .",
    "it is , however , appropriate to mention that this form of the lagrangian arises from string theory .",
    "a detailed investigation of this form of lagrangian in the context of einstein - hilbert action has been studied in ref@xcite . quite independently ( as described in @xcite ) the structure of this lagrangian can also be motivated from the fact that its form is very similar to that of a relativistic particle in classical mechanics ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "most of these scalar field models of dark energy are discussed in the context of einstein - hilbert action in general relativity . a well known alternative to einstein s theory",
    "is the brans dicke theory @xcite where newton s gravitational constant @xmath7 is identified with the inverse of a scalar field whose dynamics is governed by the matter distribution .",
    "the brans dicke theory is motivated from mach s principle which in a way suggest that @xmath7 should be function of epoch @xcite .",
    "brans dicke theory can be considered as a special case of more general scalar tensor theory of gravitation . accelerated expansion of the universe in scalar tensor theories of gravitation has been studied by various authors @xcite .",
    "these authors , however , considered a scalar field lagrangian which has a standard form @xmath8 . in this paper",
    "we consider a scalar field which plays a role similar to the brans - dicke field but with a lagrangian of the form @xmath9 .    throughout this paper",
    "we use the units @xmath10 .",
    "we consider the case when @xmath11 and @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a dimensionless parameter ( in the units @xmath10 ) . as pointed out earlier ,",
    "although this form of the action arises in certain models of string theory@xcite , we use this action at a purely phenomenological level , without analyzing the details of the fundamental origin of this form of the action .",
    "the precise form of the action and the resulting field equations are given in section [ action ] .",
    "we discuss in section [ cc ] the cosmological consequences of this theory in the matter dominated era and show that this leads to an accelerated expansion of the universe at the present epoch .",
    "the conclusions of this analysis are summarized in section [ conc ] .",

( [ tsi ] ) ] shows that the evolution of @xmath0 is determined by matter distribution ( through its trace @xmath28 ) just as in brans dicke theory but here the equation is not in as simple form as in brans dicke theory .    in this theory",
    "we have one dimensionless parameter @xmath13 whose value must be fixed observationally .",
    "we will fix its value by considering the cosmological evolution determined by this theory and comparing it with the observed parameters for the universe .",
    "the field @xmath0 , in general , will be a function of space and time _ i.e _",
    "we , however , will consider the field to be homogeneous and isotropic on cosmic scales .",

    "the friedmann equations governing the evolution of @xmath32 are given by @xmath33 with @xmath30 the equation for @xmath0 ( eq.([tsi ] ) ) takes the form :    @xmath34    here @xmath35 and @xmath36 which is the energy density and the pressure , respectively .    in our model we assume the universe to consist of the pressureless matter in addition to the field @xmath0 . the contribution from radiation at late time ( as is the case for the present era ) can be neglected .",
    "hence , we drop the contribution of radiation in the source term for einstein s equation .",
    "in addition to equations ( [ freq1 ] ) and ( [ freq2 ] ) we also have the continuity equation for matter .",
    "@xmath37 for pressure less matter this gives : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the matter density at the present epoch and @xmath40 is the scale factor at the present epoch .    in order to solve these equations ( eqs.([freq1 ] ) and ( [ freq2 ] ) ) we need the values of @xmath41 and @xmath13 as well as the values of @xmath42 , @xmath0 and @xmath43 at some instant of time .",
    "we now fix these values from the observations at the present epoch .",
    "first of all we normalize the scale factor to unity at the present epoch . at the present epoch @xmath44 ( as @xmath45 ) which is the hubble constant .",
    "the value of @xmath0 at the present epoch will be fixed as @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the newtonian gravitational constant at the present epoch .",
    "there is strong evidence from both experiments as well as cosmological observation that there is no significant variation of the gravitational constant at the present epoch .",
    "these considerations will be consistent if we consider the simplest case when @xmath48 which ensures that @xmath49 .",
    "so we consider the following conditions at the present epoch , @xmath50 : @xmath51    with these conditions we can determine the value of @xmath13 from eq .",
    "( [ freq1 ] ) . on substituting eqs .",
    "( [ at0 ] ) to ( [ sidt0 ] ) in the friedmann equation ( [ freq1 ] ) we get : @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the density parameter of ( pressureless ) matter today and is defined as @xmath54 observations indicate that @xmath55 and @xmath56 ( as indicated by the observations by wmap @xcite ) . in the units of @xmath10",
    "this gives the value @xmath57 and with the value of newtonian gravitational constant @xmath58 , we obtain the value of @xmath13 as : @xmath59 eq.([freq3 ] ) together with conditions eqs.([at0 ] ) to ( [ sidt0 ] ) gives , @xmath60 if the time variation of the field @xmath0 is exactly zero in the present epoch it would imply that @xmath61 is negative which in turn implies that @xmath62 has a maxima at the present epoch .",
    "observationally we know that there is no significant variation of the `` gravitational coupling '' with time . hence , with in the framework of this scenario ,",
    "the present value of the gravitational coupling parameter should be close to its maximum value .",
    "eq.([freq2 ] ) together with conditions eqs.([at0 ] ) to ( [ sidt0 ] ) gives , @xmath63 from eqs .",
    "( [ lamda ] ) , ( [ sidd ] ) and ( [ add ] ) we get : @xmath64    hence the conditions eqs.([at0 ] ) to ( [ sidt0 ] ) naturally leads to an accelerated expansion of the universe at the present epoch . within the frame work of einstein gr , if we consider dark energy to be a perfect fluid with equation of state @xmath65 , then such a value of @xmath66 ( eq.([addt0 ] ) ) would correspond to @xmath67 .",
    "the figure ( [ adda ] ) shows the plot of @xmath68 verses the scale factor @xmath42 .",
    "we see from the figure that @xmath69 is less than zero for small values of the scale factor and becomes positive for the large values .",
    "the transition occurs for @xmath70 ( corresponding to a redshift of @xmath71 ) .",
    "thus in this model the transition from a decelerating phase to an accelerating phase should have taken place at @xmath72 . in figure ( [ ga ] ) we plot the ratio @xmath73 verses the scale factor , where @xmath47 is the newtonian gravitational constant .",
    "we can see from the figure ( fig.([ga ] ) ) that the field @xmath0 asymptotically attains a constant value of @xmath74 .",
    "a constant value of the field @xmath0 would imply that the field equation ( eq.([feqgab ] ) ) would then become usual einstein equation with a cosmological constant .",
    "hence this model asymptotically becomes de sitter universe .",
    "we have considered a model in which the gravitational coupling evolves as @xmath75 where the lagrangian for the scalar field , @xmath0 , is given by the lagrangian of the form @xmath76 .",
    "we have chosen a potential of the form @xmath77 , where @xmath13 is a dimensionless parameter .",
    "on considering the cosmological consequence of this theory we have shown that imposing condition that @xmath78 gives a value of @xmath79 and also gives a positive value of acceleration ( at the present epoch ) with @xmath80 .",
    "such a value of @xmath69 would correspond to an effective equation of state @xmath81 .",
    "numerical calculation shows that there was a transition from an initial decelerating expansion to an accelerated expansion phase at the present epoch .",
    "this transition occurred at @xmath71 .",
    "this result is consistent with the observations@xcite .",
