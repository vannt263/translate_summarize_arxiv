    ", our knowledge of the universe is incomplete and new gauge forces beyond those of the sm may be crucial to describing the laws of physics .",
    "the existence of such forces is highly constrained if they couple significantly to sm matter unless they have an associated mass scale ( such as from confinement or the higgs mechanism ) well above a tev  @xcite .",
    "in contrast new _ dark _ gauge forces , with only feeble connections to the sm , can exist at energy scales much less than the tev scale ( or even be in a massless phase ) and still be fully consistent with existing experimental bounds  @xcite .",
    "such dark forces may also be related to the cosmological dark matter  @xcite .",
    "abelian dark forces have been studied in great detail and have the novel property that they can connect to the sm at the renormalizable level through gauge kinetic mixing  @xcite .",
    "limits on the existence of such a kinetically - mixed _ dark photon _ have been obtained from existing experimental searches and astrophysical and cosmological observations for a range of dark photon masses spanning many orders of magnitude  @xcite .",
    "an exciting dedicated experimental program to search for dark photons is also underway  @xcite .",
    "non - abelian dark forces have received somewhat less attention .",
    "as gauge invariance forbids the simple kinetic - mixing interaction with the sm , it is less clear how they potentially connect to the sm .",
    "even so , non - abelian dark forces are well - motivated and arise in many contexts including string theory constructions  @xcite , in models of dark matter  @xcite , baryogenesis  @xcite , theories of neutral naturalness  @xcite , and within the _ hidden valley _",
    "paradigm  @xcite .",
    "non - abelian dark forces can also lead to very different phenomenological effects compared to their abelian counterparts owing to the requisite self - interactions among the corresponding gauge bosons and their potential for a confining phase transition at low energies .",
    "the minimal realization of a non - abelian dark force is a pure yang - mills theory with simple gauge group @xmath3 .",
    "such a theory is expected to confine at the characteristic energy scale @xmath4 , with the elementary dark gluons binding into a spectrum of colour - neutral dark glueballs of mass @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "these dark states may have significant cosmological effects even when their connection to the sm is too small to be detected in laboratory experiments .",
    "for very small values of @xmath4 , dark gluons can act as self - interacting dark radiation  @xcite , and can be consistent with existing constraints provided their effective temperature is somewhat lower than the sm plasma . with larger @xmath4 , the glueballs will contribute to the density of dark matter if they are long - lived  @xcite , or may lead to observable astrophysical or cosmological signals if they decay at late times  @xcite .",
    "assessing the cosmological impact of massive dark glueballs requires a precise knowledge of their relic abundances .",
    "the primary goal of this work is to compute these abundances and map out the ranges of parameters where one or more dark glueball states might constitute all or some of the observed dark matter .",
    "we will focus mainly on @xmath6 , but we will also comment on how our results can be applied to other non - abelian gauge groups . in a future companion paper",
    "we will describe in detail the cosmological effects of both stable and unstable primordial glueball populations and use them to constrain the existence of non - abelian dark forces  @xcite .",
    "starting from an early universe containing a thermal plasma of dark gluons with temperature @xmath7 , typically different than the temperature of the sm plasma , dark glueballs will be formed in a phase transition as the temperature of the dark sector falls below the confinement scale , @xmath8 .",
    "since glueball number is not conserved , the number densities of the glueball states will then track their equilibrium values so long as their @xmath1 and @xmath9 interaction rates are fast relative to the hubble expansion rate .",
    "the key difference compared to standard freeze - out is that without direct annihilation or rapid decays to sm or lighter hidden states , the overall chemical equilibrium of the dark glueballs will be maintained primarily by @xmath10 number - changing reactions  @xcite .",
    "moreover , if the hidden glueballs do not have a kinetic equilibration with the sm or a bath of relativistic hidden states , the energy released by the @xmath11 annihilations will cause the remaining glueballs to cool much more slowly than they would otherwise  @xcite .",
    "together , these two effects produce freeze - out yields with a much different dependence on the underlying parameters of the theory than the typical freeze - out paradigm of annihilation into light relativistic particles .",
    "previous works have studied the effects of @xmath11 annihilation and self - heating in general massive self - coupled sectors  @xcite .",
    "the specific application of these processes to dark glueballs has also been studied in refs .",
    "we expand upon these works in two ways .",
    "first , we investigate possible effects of the confining phase transition on the final glueball yields .",
    "and second , we compute the freeze - out abundances of the heavier glueball states in addition to the lightest mode .",
    "we also show that when the glueballs are connected to the sm , the heavier relic glueball states can sometimes have a greater observational effect than the lightest mode .    following this introduction",

    "next , we study the freeze - out of the lightest glueball in section  [ sec : fo ] and investigate the effects of the confining phase transition . in section  [ sec : multi ] we extend our freeze - out analysis to include the heavier glueball states .",
