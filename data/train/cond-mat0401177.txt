    ", entropy can be either a continuous and infinitely differentiable function of the energy ( in the case of a continuous microcanonical transition ) or it can display a discontinuity already in the first derivative . this case is denoted as _",

    "this latter case remains to be fully understood from the physical point of view : what does the coexistence of two temperatures , at equilibrium , for a given energy mean ?",
    "in this letter we present a careful analysis of the microcanonical first order transition that appears in a toy model that describes the motion of particles in a two - dimensional bounded domain ( a torus ) .",
    "the model has been first introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the analysis was limited to microcanonical continuous transitions .    in the first part of this letter",
    ", we fully characterize the phase transition by studying the intricate dependence of temperature on energy ( the so - called caloric curve ) and the dependence of entropy on both the energy and the order parameter , discussing also finite @xmath0 effects .    in the second part we concentrate on a study of the relaxation dynamics from a _ metastable _ state for a finite number @xmath0 of particles .",
    "this process had been originally investigated by griffiths _",
    "_  @xcite within the canonical ensemble . in this pioneering paper",
    "the authors have shown that , for a curie - weiss ising model in an external magnetic field , the relaxation time of the metastable states grows exponentially with @xmath0 , the exponential growth rate being given by the free - energy barrier per spin .",
    "more recently , the influence on the relaxation dynamics of extrinsic ( thermal ) noise source and of the intrinsic noise source due to finite @xmath0-effects has been analysed for a @xmath1-model with long range interactions  @xcite .",
    "we are not aware of any similar study within the microcanonical ensemble , especially in a situation of ensemble inequivalence .",
    "indeed , the out of equilibrium dynamical behaviour near a microcanonical continuous transition has been already examined as far as the relaxation from _ unstable _ states is concerned  @xcite .",
    "the relaxation times have been shown to be typically proportional to some power of @xmath0 . in our analysis , since no extrinsic noise is present , we emphasize the role played by the _ intrinsic noise source _ originated by finite @xmath0 effects .",
    "these intrinsic fluctuations induce an exponential divergence with @xmath0 of the relaxation time , with a growth rate given by the entropy barrier per particle .",
    "the model we consider is a classical @xmath0-body hamiltonian system defined on a two - dimensional periodic cell .",
    "the inter - particle potential is infinite ranged and the particles are all identical and have unitary mass .",
    "the hamiltonian of the model is @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the kinetic energy while the potential energy reads @xmath4 \\quad , \\label{eqha}\\ ] ] where @xmath5-\\pi :   \\pi ] \\times ] -\\pi : \\pi ] $ ] represents the coordinates of the @xmath6-particle , @xmath7 the conjugated momenta and @xmath8 is a parameter .",
    "the complete phase diagram of this model has been previously presented in ref .",
    "we will limit here our analysis to the parameter value @xmath9 , for which the system undergoes a first order microcanonical phase transition .",
    "the different phases are conveniently characterized by the vector order parameter @xmath10 , where @xmath11 or @xmath12 and @xmath13 indicates the average over all the particles .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath14 and @xmath15 can be thought as the _ magnetization _ of the infinite - range heisenberg xy hamiltonian ( [ eqha ] ) . in the low energy @xmath16 clustered phase ( cp )",
    "all particles are trapped in a single cluster and @xmath17 , whereas in the high energy homogeneous phase ( hp ) they are uniformly distributed in the cell and @xmath18 . at the microcanonical transition energy , both the order parameter and temperature",
    "have a discontinuity .",
    "we have analyzed model ( [ eqha ] ) from an analytical and a numerical point of view .",
    "since the microcanonical and the canonical variational problems define the same critical states  @xcite , it is convenient to first solve the model in the canonical ensemble . indeed , via standard saddle - point techniques , one obtains all absolute and relative extrema of the free energy as a function of the order parameter  @xcite .",
    "these are also extrema of the entropy , although their stability properties are different in the two ensembles .",
    "states that are unstable in the canonical ensemble may become stable in the microcanonical : this is the mechanism at the origin of the negative specific heat in the microcanocical ensemble . from the entropy extrema , we get all the thermodynamics of the model in the mean - field ( @xmath19 ) limit , including caloric curves and entropy barriers , that we discuss in the next section . as far as the numerics is concerned ,",
    "we perform molecular dynamics simulations ( of course at finite @xmath0 ) using an accurate fourth order symplectic integrator .",
    "let us first briefly resume what is known  @xcite , about the phase diagram . in the canonical ensemble , model ( [ eqha ] ) exhibits a continuous transition from the cp to the hp for small @xmath8 values ( namely for @xmath20 ) , above the canonical tricritical point , @xmath21 , the transition becomes discontinuous with a finite energy jump . in the microcanonical ensemble",
    "the transition is continuous till the microcanonical tricritical point , @xmath22 , is reached . for @xmath23 a first order transition with a temperature jump is observed .",
    "we concentrate here our analysis to the specific parameter value @xmath9 , for which the transition is discontinuous in both the canonical and the microcanonical ensemble . in the canonical ensemble , at the transition temperature @xmath24 , one observes an energy jump from @xmath25 to @xmath26 , corresponding to a release of a latent heat . in this energy range the microcanonical ensemble gives different predictions .",
    "the cp is stable in the interval @xmath27 $ ] , while in the interval @xmath28 $ ] the stable phase is the hp .",
    "the two phases are connected by a finite temperature jump at @xmath29 from @xmath30 to @xmath31 .",
    "these results are confirmed by the numerical simulations ( see fig .  [ f.1](a ) ) , although the sharp jump is smoothed by finite @xmath0 effects .",
    "the specific heat is negative from @xmath32 till @xmath33 ( point b in fig .",
    "[ f.1](a ) ) , but before reaching this energy value , at point a , the cp becomes metastable and remains such from a to b. at point b the specific heat vanishes and the phase turns to unstable , with an associated positive specific heat .",
    "the unstable curve bc ( dot - dashed line in fig.[f.1](a ) ) joins the cp to the hp phase ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "hp is metastable along cd in fig.[f.1](a ) , while for @xmath35 it is always stable .",
    "the microcanonical transition can be better understood by considering the behaviour of the entropy per particle @xmath36 as a function of the order parameter @xmath15 . in the energy range @xmath37",
    "$ ] the entropy always exhibits two maxima separated by a minimum .",
    "the two maxima correspond to the hp ( @xmath38 ) and the cp ( @xmath39 ) , respectively , while the minimum refers to an unstable clustered phase ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "plotting the values of these extrema as a function of @xmath41 , three distinct branches can be drawn ( see fig .",
    "[ f.1 ] ( b ) ) : a concave one corresponding to the @xmath42 , and two convex ones corresponding to the @xmath43 and to the unstable phase , respectively . for @xmath44",
    "the entropy @xmath45 exhibits a single maximum @xmath39 . at @xmath46 , a second",
    "lower maximum @xmath38 emerges together with a minimum , via a saddle - node bifurcation . at higher energies",
    "the height of @xmath38 increases , while that of @xmath39 decreases . at @xmath29",
    "the two maxima reach the same height : this signals the first order transition energy .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ f.1](c ) , where @xmath29 is identified by the intersection of the barrier heights @xmath47 and @xmath48 . for @xmath49",
    "the hp maximum prevails and the cp phase becomes metastable . at @xmath50 the entropy minimum and the lower maximum corresponding to the cp merge and disappear via an inverse saddle - node bifurcation .",
    "above such energy only one maximum in the entropy is present and it is associated to the hp .    another strong indication that the transition is first - order comes from the fact that near the transition energy an intermittent behaviour is observed : the system jumps erratically from the cp to the hp and back  ] . in fig .",
    "[ f.1](d ) the histogram of the instantaneous temperatures is reported for a system of @xmath51 particles at an energy , @xmath52 , close to @xmath29 .",
    "two peaks are present in the histogram : one is associated to the hp ( @xmath53 ) and the other to the cp ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "hence , there is no mystery in the coexistence of two temperatures in equilibrium : temperature , in the microcanonical ensemble , is a derived quantity and is subject to fluctuations .",
    "the bimodal shape of the temperature histogram reflects the analogous bimodality of the order parameter fluctuations , which is a consequence of the first order nature of the phase transition .",
    "similarly , in a canonical simulation , one would observe a bimodal energy distribution , with peaks at @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "we are interested in characterizing the differences in the relaxation dynamics from an unstable state towards a stable one , with respect to an initial metastable state .",
    "as detailed above , an unstable state is an entropy minimum , while a metastable state is a relative maximum , separated from the stable state by an entropy barrier .",
    "it is reasonable to conjecture that in the first case the relaxation process is dominated by a `` diffusive like '' behaviour , while in the second situation the _ activation _ across an entropy barrier should play a fundamental role . at variance with canonical ensemble dynamics  @xcite , the activation process can be induced only by finite @xmath0 fluctuations , since there is no coupling to an external bath .",
    "hence , we expect that the relaxation time from an unstable state will typically increase with a power law in the particle number , the relaxation process being dominated by the _ granularity _ of the system , that drives it to equilibrium through collisional effects of the type encountered in self - gravitating systems  @xcite ) . instead ,",
    "for a metastable state , we should find a noticeably different behaviour .",
    "let us consider the situation where the cp is stable , while the hp is metastable . by following the standard fluctuation theory  @xcite",
    ", we expect that the probability to observe a given value of the magnetization in the interval @xmath57 $ ] is given by @xmath58 } \\enskip   dm \\quad = ( 2 \\pi < m^2>)^{-\\frac{1}{2 } }   \\enskip { \\rm",
    "e}^{-\\frac{m^2}{2 < m^2 > } }   \\enskip dm \\label{prob}\\ ] ] where @xmath59 is the entropy as a function of the order parameter , @xmath60 is the entropy of the hp ( for which @xmath61 ) and @xmath62 .",
    "as soon as the magnetization reaches the value corresponding to the entropy minimum @xmath63 , the system is quickly driven towards the cp .",
    "therefore , the relaxation time from a metastable state should diverge as : @xmath64^{-1 }   \\propto { \\rm e}^{[s_{hp}-s_{unst } ] n } \\label{tau}\\ ] ] and we will observe an activated escape process as long as @xmath65 .",
    "let us check these two distinct relaxation behaviours in numerical experiments .",
    "in order to measures the lifetime of a metastable ( unstable ) hp , the system is initialized with zero magnetization ( indeed due to finite @xmath0 effects @xmath66 ) .",
    "( where the hp is stable ) is taken and the velocities are rescaled to obtain the desired energy . ]",
    "once the initial state is prepared , we follow its time evolution by monitoring magnetization .",
    "a typical behaviour is reported in fig .",
    "[ f.3](a ) .",
    "then , we register the time @xmath15 needs to reach @xmath67 of its asymptotic value .",
    "the lifetime of the hp state is finally determined by averaging over several different initial conditions .",
    "we first examine the relaxation of a metastable state , therefore the system is initialized with an energy in the range @xmath68 $ ] . in this interval entropy",
    "exhibits an absolute maximum @xmath39 ( corresponding to the cp ) and a relative maximum @xmath38 ( corresponding to the hp ) separated by a minimum @xmath40 .",
    "if we prepare the initial state in the hp this will have a lifetime @xmath69 that we expect to grow as @xmath70}$ ] .",
    "in particular , as shown in fig.[f.3](b ) at @xmath71 , for @xmath72 @xmath69 has indeed an exponential growth with @xmath0 . moreover ,",
    "as reported in table [ t.1 ] the numerical estimation of the growth rates @xmath73 at three different energies in the interval @xmath68 $ ] are in agreement with the mean - field value @xmath74 . as a final remark , one should notice that for small @xmath0 ( e.g. for @xmath75 at @xmath71 ) the escape time grows proportionally to @xmath0 instead of exhibiting an exponential growth ( as it can be seen also in fig.[f.3](b ) ) .",
    "this behaviour resembles the relaxation from an unstable state and it is due to the fact that for such small number of particles @xmath76",
    ". therefore the magnetization fluctuations are so large to easily overcome the entropy barrier , that does not play any role here . in order to measure the lifetime of an unstable hp , we take the energy @xmath77 , for which the zero magnetization state is unstable and the cp is stable . at @xmath77",
    "the transition times @xmath69 scale clearly with @xmath0 as shown in the inset of fig .",
