    "this article is a continuation of @xcite , in which we introduced the notion of symplectic microfolds and symplectic micromorphisms between them .",
    "recall that a symplectic microfold is essentially the same thing as a germ @xmath0 $ ] of symplectic manifolds @xmath1 around a lagrangian submanifold @xmath2 , called the core .",
    "a symplectic micromorphism from @xmath0 $ ] to @xmath3 $ ] is a germ around the graph of a smooth map @xmath4 , the core map , of a canonical relation of a symplectic manifold @xmath5 is the manifold @xmath1 endowed with the opposite symplectic form @xmath6 . ] @xmath7 containing the graph of @xmath8 and satisfying a certain transversality condition ; we review the definitions in section [ subsec - definitions ] below .",
    "in contrast with their macroworld counterparts ( i.e. canonical relations ) , symplectic micromorphisms always compose well , forming thus , with the symplectic microfolds as objects , an honest symmetric monoidal category : the microsymplectic category , which can be thought as the appropriate `` microworld '' analog to the symplectic `` category '' of symplectic manifolds and canonical relations @xcite .",
    "this makes the microsymplectic category a natural setting for questions related to the functorial behavior of quantization schemes in symplectic geometry .    by `` quantization scheme '' ,",
    "we mean here any well - defined correspondence between a certain type of geometric structures in the symplectic realm ( such as poisson structures ) and a certain type of algebraic structures in the realm of analysis ( such as @xmath9-algebras ) .",
    "two important ingredients involved in these quantization questions have been the generating functions and the fourier integral operators associated with a given lagrangian submanifold ( see @xcite ) .    in this paper , we extend the notion of generating functions to the microworld .",
    "our first main result is that _ any _ symplectic micromorphism admits a _ global _ generating function .",
    "this is the best possible case when it comes to quantization via fourier integral operators ( as will be shown in a sequel @xcite ) .",
    "a second result ( theorem [ thm : normal form ] ) states that the underlying lagrangian submicrofold of a symplectic micromorphism can always be decomposed into a fibration by graphs of actual smooth map germs .",
    "the main example here is the cotangent lift @xmath10 of a smooth map @xmath4 , whose underlying lagrangian submicrofold is the germ of the lagrangian submanifold @xmath11 around the graph of @xmath8 .",
    "when @xmath8 is not a diffeomorphism , @xmath12 is not the graph of a symplectomorphism , although the cotangent maps @xmath13 to @xmath8 at each @xmath14 _ are _ actual maps .",
    "this gives us a decomposition @xmath15 of @xmath12 associated with the lagrangian fibration of @xmath16 by its cotangent fibers .",
    "more generally , a similar decomposition holds for general symplectic micromorphisms from @xmath0 $ ] to @xmath3 $ ] , which is uniquely associated with the data of a lagrangian fibration of @xmath3 $ ] .",
    "this special geometry of the underlying lagrangian submicrofolds may be of help in questions related to the continuity of their corresponding fourier integral operators .",
    "namely , in various instances ( @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) , the continuity in @xmath17-spaces of some classes of fios has been related to their wave - fronts being local graphs . from a different perspective",
    ", this decomposition is reminiscent of the notion of co - morphisms of chen and liu introduced in @xcite in the context of lie groupoids .",
    "we derive the existence of global generating functions for symplectic micromorphisms from a more general result : the _ equivalence theorem _ for clean lagrangian submicrofolds ( theorem [ thm : equivalence theorem ] ) .",
    "it states that the data of a germ @xmath18 $ ] of a lagrangian submanifold @xmath19 that intersects the zero section _ cleanly _ in @xmath20 is equivalent to the data @xmath21 of a symplectomorphism germ , when it is clear from the context , we write @xmath22 to denote the microfold @xmath23 $ ] , where @xmath24 is the zero section of @xmath22 .",
    "moreover , we also identify @xmath24 with @xmath2 and the submanifolds @xmath25 with the corresponding submanifolds of @xmath24 , yielding the notation @xmath26 $ ] . ]",
    "@xmath27 $ ] ( of the type prescribed by the lagrangian embedding theorem @xcite applied to the conormal bundle @xmath28 and satisfying an extra condition ) together with a function germ @xmath29 around the zero section ( and vanishing on it , as well as its differential ) . actually , we prove that for each @xmath30 there exists a unique @xmath31 such that @xmath32 .",
    "this defines the global generating function @xmath31 of the clean lagrangian submicrofold @xmath18 $ ] associated with the symplectomorphism germ @xmath30 .",
    "it turns out that the symplectic micromorphisms from @xmath33 to @xmath16 with core map @xmath8 are nothing but the _ clean _ lagrangian submicrofolds in @xmath34 with core @xmath35 . while giving another ( and simpler ) characterization of symplectic micromorphisms",
    ", the equivalence theorem also tells us that they admit global generating functions ( associated with special symplectomorphism germs @xmath30 as before ) .",
    "another application of the equivalence theorem comes from considering the restriction of a symplectic micromorphism to a local chart .",
    "the restriction is again a symplectic micromorphism , but now we have a canonical symplectomorphism germ @xmath30 coming from the affine structure of the local chart .",
    "this allows us to define the _ local _ generating function of the symplectic micromorphism in the local chart as the global generating function of its restriction .",
    "we conclude this paper by associating with any hamiltonian flow on a cotangent bundle a symplectic micromorphism , the evolution micromorphism , which encodes the dynamics for asymptotically short times .",
    "we show that the local generating functions of the evolution micromorphism coincide with the solutions of the hamilton - jacobi equation for the flow in local charts .",
    "moreover , by considering a particular monoid object in the microsymplectic category , the energy monoid @xmath36 , we show that the @xmath36-modules are essentially the same thing as germs of hamiltonian flows with time - independent hamiltonian .",
    "this gives us a categorical formulation for the temporal evolution in classical mechanics .",
    "finally , we briefly describe how symmetries in classical mechanics can be formalized using the language of symplectic microgeometry .",
    "this approach to symmetry , which will be developed in full details somewhere else , is very close in spirit to the work of benenti on the hamilton - jacobi equation for an hamiltonian action ( @xcite ) .    a.s.c .",
