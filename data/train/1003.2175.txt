    "several studies , both observational and computational , of groups and clusters of galaxies , and of individual early - type galaxies , assume that the hot gas present in these systems is in hydrostatic equilibrium ( he ) in the overall gravitational potential .",
    "even though the assumption of he has been shown to not always be robust ( e.g. bertin et al . 1993 ; ciotti & pellegrini 2004 ) , many authors assume an isothermal @xmath2-model ( cavaliere & fusco - femiano 1976 , 1978 ) to describe the gas profile , but several solve the he equation , assuming that the gravitational potential is due to dark matter ( dm ) only , usually described by an nfw ( navarro , frenk & white 1996 ) profile ( e.g. makino , sasaki & suto 1998 ; suto , sasaki & makino 1998 ) , or by more general profiles ( e.g. ciotti & pellegrini 2008 ) .",
    "while this approximation seems to hold for groups and clusters of galaxies , it is well known that stars contribute a significant fraction of the total and baryonic matter of elliptical galaxies , and even become the dominant part at the very centre of these systems ( e.g. ferreras , saha & williams 2005 ) .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to extend previous calculations that only considered the potential due to dm , and explicitly include the contribution of the stellar component as well .",
    "providing an analytic fitting formula for calculating the response of the gas to the presence of the gravitational potential induced by both dm and stars is useful while interpreting x - ray data of early - type galaxies and for setting up initial conditions for simulations of elliptical galaxies .",
    "the derivation of an equilibrium gas profile neglecting the effects of stars leads to an incorrect estimate of the enclosed gas mass , particularly in the central regions of the galaxy , and therefore has implications for the evaluation of the baryon fraction as a function of radius , and for the calculation of the rate of accretion onto a central supermassive black hole .",
    "moreover , the known relations ( e.g. makino et al . 1998 ) between observed properties of the hot gas , described via a @xmath2-model , and the parameters of the underlying dm gravitational potential , are significantly affected by the inclusion of the stellar component . in addition , an analytic formula that includes the effects of stars can be important to provide a more realistic formulation of the initial equilibrium conditions for simulations of galaxy formation and evolution ( e.g. di matteo , springel & hernquist 2005 ; springel , di matteo & hernquist 2005 ; hopkins et al . 2006 ) .",
    "it has long been observed , both at low redshift ( e.g. graham et al .",
    "1996 ; kormendy et al . 2009 ) and high redshift ( e.g. mancini et al . 2010 ; van dokkum et al .",
    "2010 ) , that the surface brightness of many elliptical galaxies can be well described by the empirically derived de vaucouleurs ( 1948 ) profile or , more generally , by the srsic ( 1963 , 1968 ) profile .",
    "unfortunately , the de - projected stellar mass density profile can not be calculated analytically ( but see young 1976 for a numerical study ) .",
    "there is , however , a family of stellar mass density profiles ( dehnen 1993 ; see also tremaine et al .",
    "1994 ) that also describes observed properties well .",
    "not only is the dehnen family analytically simple , but also , for a defined range of parameters , it quite successfully resembles the de vaucouleurs profile in both surface density and distribution function .",
    "furthermore , it includes , as special cases , the widely used jaffe ( 1983 ) and hernquist ( 1990 ) profiles .",
    "it is this family of density profiles that we investigate further in this paper , and use to model the stellar component . throughout the paper",
    ", we use the following values for cosmological parameters when needed : @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 km s@xmath8 mpc@xmath9 km s@xmath8 mpc@xmath8 , @xmath10 ( i.e. @xmath11 ) .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec : formulation ] , we formulate the problem and derive the new formalism for he gas profiles in the presence of dm and stars . in section [ sec : analysis ] , we analyse the he solutions for a realistic model of an isolated elliptical galaxy , compare the results for a wide range of parameters , and present new relations between @xmath2-model and dm parameters .",
    "we conclude in section [ sec : conclusions ] with a discussion of our results and their implications for interpreting x - ray observations , and for simulations of elliptical galaxies .",
    "we model the composite system of gas in equilibrium with stars and a dm halo . to start with",
    ", we consider the case of an ideal gas in a generic total gravitational potential @xmath12 with a finite central value @xmath13 , and solve the he equation , @xmath14 , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 refer to the pressure and mass density of the gas .",
    "note that the general equation simplifies in the case of spherical symmetry to the familiar form    @xmath17    where we have made use of poisson s equation , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the total enclosed mass and total mass density , respectively .",
    "if the gas is barotropic , i.e. @xmath21 , we can further write    @xmath22    where the free parameter @xmath23 was chosen as the boundary condition .    for simplicity , we only consider the two common barotropic cases : the isothermal and the polytropic case . in the isothermal ideal gas case ,",
    "pressure and density are related by @xmath24 \\rho(r ) = ( p_0/\\rho_0 ) \\rho(r)$ ] , where @xmath25 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath26 is the gas mean molecular weight , @xmath27 is the proton mass , and @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the central gas temperature and density , respectively .",
    "the solution to the he equation in this case can be reduced to the familiar integral :    @xmath30 = \\rho_0\\exp\\left[-\\frac{g\\rho_0}{p_0 } \\int_0^r{\\frac{m_t(r')}{r'^2}\\,dr'}\\right ] , \\label{eq : iso_sol}\\ ] ]    where @xmath31 .    for the polytropic ideal gas case ,",
    "pressure and density are related by @xmath32 , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 is the polytropic index .",
    "the solution to the he equation in this case is :    @xmath35^{\\frac{1}{\\gamma-1 } } = \\rho_0 \\left[1-\\frac{\\gamma-1}{\\gamma}\\frac{g \\rho_0}{p_0}\\int_0^r{\\frac{m_t(r')}{r'^2}\\,dr'}\\right]^{\\frac{1}{\\gamma-1}}. \\label{eq : poly_sol}\\ ] ]    it is worth pointing out that the polytropic solution is only physically meaningful if the term in square brackets of the r.h.s of equation is non - negative .",
    "moreover , the isothermal quantities ( and , in most cases , the polytropic quantities ) are non - zero at infinity : with our choice of the boundary condition , regardless of the slope of the gravitational potential at large radii , only a potential which is infinite at the origin would be able to cause the gas density at infinity to be zero .",
    "for this reason , results at large radii should be treated with caution .",
    "see bulbul et al .",
    "( 2009 ) for an alternate approach in the polytropic case , where they impose @xmath36 as the boundary condition .",
    "this is equivalent to setting @xmath37 in equation .",
    "we further assume that gas does not contribute to the total gravitational potential ( i.e. we neglect gas self - gravity ) , and therefore solve the simplified he equation instead , where now @xmath12 is the gravitational potential due to all mass _ excluding _ gas , and @xmath38 is the total mass _ excluding _ gas .",
    "this assumption is supported , especially for the inner regions , by previous studies ( e.g. suto et al .",
    "1998 ) , and is justified by the fact that gas is _ globally _ negligible , i.e. the enclosed gas mass is one or more orders of magnitude smaller than the total enclosed mass for all radii up to the virial radius .",
    "stars , on the other hand , while having a virial enclosed mass comparable to that of the gas , are not negligible in the inner parts of the galaxy : in fact , they represent the dominant matter fraction at least up to the effective radius ( e.g. ferreras et al . 2005 ) .",
    "we initially consider a system with gas and dm only , and assume that the dm density can be described by an nfw profile ,    @xmath39    where @xmath3 is a scale radius , @xmath40 is a characteristic ( dimensionless ) density , and @xmath41 is the critical density of the universe . the corresponding gravitational potential and enclosed mass are    @xmath42 , \\label{eq : nfw_pot_and_mass}\\ ] ]    respectively , where @xmath43 , and we have assumed @xmath44 . substituting these into equations and , we have , as in makino et al .",

    "now we move on to the case of an nfw dm halo with the stellar component modelled using a dehnen profile , neglecting the effects of adiabatic contraction .",

    "this is especially true for values of @xmath52 ranging between 1 ( which corresponds to the hernquist profile ) and 2 ( the jaffe profile ) , with @xmath53 being the value for which the match is closest .",

    "note , however , that the gas virial mass is the same with and without the stellar component in the gravitational potential , since stars are included in the total mass budget in both cases .",

    "note that , even though the @xmath2-@xmath122 relation is independent of temperature , the value of the characteristic slope parameter @xmath2 does depend on temperature through @xmath122 .",
    "now we go a step further and compare the @xmath2-model profile to the isothermal he gas profile in the case when stars are included in the gravitational potential , given by equation . since we found that there is no strong dependence on the dehnen parameter , we focus on the hernquist case ( @xmath160 ) for simplicity . also , we choose the stellar b - band mass - to - light ratio to be @xmath132 m@xmath97l@xmath73 , as the inferred stellar baryon fraction @xmath133 is closer to what found from gravitational lensing observations ( e.g. hoekstra et al .",
    "2005 ) , and because higher stellar mass fraction systems do not fit the @xmath2-model profiles as well . the fact that it is indeed possible to fit x - ray observations of early - type galaxies with @xmath2-model profiles ( e.g. osullivan , ponman & collins 2003 ) , is an additional indication that the stellar baryon fraction of such galaxies can not be much higher than @xmath110% .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : beta_model_comparison ] we show the equilibrium gas density profiles for an isothermal gas in a system with nfw dm and hernquist stars , for two different temperatures , including and excluding the effects of stars on the total gravitational potential .",
    "all he gas profiles are fitted to @xmath2-model profiles in the @xmath137 range .",
    "we chose this particular range to be able to make consistent comparisons with the results of makino et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , and also because it is typically difficult to obtain precise x - ray measurements at larger radii ( due to the low surface brightness of the gas ) and at smaller radii ( due to resolution limitations ) .",
    "we note that , whereas the relation between @xmath2 and @xmath122 does not change significantly ( @xmath159 excluding stars , and @xmath161 including stars ) , the @xmath153-@xmath3 relation between the two scale radii varies substantially , from @xmath158 , when stars are not included in the potential , to @xmath162 , when stars are included .",
    "we note that the particular constant of proportionality between @xmath153 and @xmath3 depends on the assumed stellar mass fraction .",
    "using the @xmath153-@xmath3 relation can therefore lead to an underestimate of the nfw scale radius , when stars are not taken into account . defining @xmath163 as the ratio between the @xmath2-model inferred value of @xmath3 when stars are included in the gravitational potential ( the _ new _ value ) , and when they are not ( the _ old _ value ) , we have @xmath164 . assuming the virial mass @xmath69 and radius @xmath66 of the system",
    "are known , we then have the ratio of concentration parameters @xmath165 .",
    "therefore , the enclosed dm mass at @xmath166 would be overestimated by a factor of @xmath167/[\\ln(1+c_{vir - new})-c_{vir - new}/(1+c_{vir - new } ) ] \\sim 2 $ ] .",
    "we solve the he equation analytically for a system with dm described by an nfw profile , and stars described by a dehnen profile , for the two common barotropic cases ( the isothermal case and the polytropic case ) .",
    "we thus extend previous calculations which only considered the potential due to dm . in doing so , we do assume spherical symmetry , and we neglect the effects of gas self - gravity and adiabatic contraction .",
    "we compare the newly obtained equilibrium solutions as a function of stellar mass fraction , central gas temperature , and the dehnen parameter , to the case when the stellar component is included in the total mass budget but not in the total gravitational potential .",
    "we determine that neglecting the effects of stars leads to an underestimate of the enclosed gas mass in the inner regions of the galaxy .",
    "we then present new relations between @xmath2-model and dm parameters , and find that the inclusion of the stellar component is necessary to avoid an underestimate of the nfw scale radius .",
    "in particular :    * for a system with nfw dm and hernquist stars at redshift @xmath114 , with virial mass @xmath115 m@xmath73 , and central temperature @xmath0 kev , we find in the isothermal case that the gas concentration ratio @xmath168 between the _ new _",
    "( i.e. including stars in the gravitational potential ) and the _ old _",
    "( i.e. excluding stars ) enclosed gas mass , can be as high as @xmath13 at the effective radius , and as high as @xmath11.2 at the nfw scale radius , for a stellar baryon fraction @xmath129 . *",
    "the effect of gas concentration decreases with decreasing stellar baryon fraction as expected , with @xmath169 varying from @xmath13 in the @xmath129 case , to @xmath12 in the @xmath131 case , to @xmath11.3 in the @xmath133 case .",
    "* on the other hand , the effect of gas concentration is virtually independent of the dehnen parameter , except in the very inner - most regions of the galaxy ( @xmath150 ) , with the value of @xmath169 changing by @xmath11% when varying the dehnen parameter in the @xmath170 range .",
    "* we further determine that the effect of gas concentration decreases with increasing temperature , as expected .",
    "* we find similar results for the polytropic case at higher temperatures , where the solution is physically meaningful .",
    "in fact , for a fixed central gas temperature , the effect of gas concentration is more pronounced than in the isothermal case , because the polytropic gas has a lower mean temperature .",
    "* we derive new relations between observed properties of the hot gas , described via a @xmath2-model , and the parameters of the underlying dm gravitational potential of early - type galaxies , which avoid an underestimate of the nfw scale radius by @xmath180% , and an overestimate of the enclosed dm mass at @xmath3 by a factor of @xmath12 , assuming a 10% stellar baryon fraction .",
    "* models with higher stellar mass fraction do not fit @xmath2-models well , further indicating that the stellar baryon fraction of isolated elliptical galaxies whose observed surface brightness profile is well fitted by a @xmath2-model can not be much higher than @xmath110%",
