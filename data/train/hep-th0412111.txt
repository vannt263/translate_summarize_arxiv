    "in higher dimensional supergravity and string theories compactifications of spacetimes are an essential tool to make contact with the four - dimensional phenomenology . in the past",
    "the majority of research was focused on the investigation of compactifications to four - dimensional minkowski or anti - de sitter spacetime .",
    " klein spectrum of such compactifications was studied in detail to analyze the properties of the resulting supergravity theories  @xcite .    in contrary",
    ", cosmology motivates the study of effective four - dimensional geometries that correspond to an expanding universe .",
    "the successful cosmological model with quasi - de sitter epochs during inflation and dark energy domination today gradually shifts the interest towards higher dimensional models that provide possibilities for incorporating effective four - dimensional cosmology .",
    "so far , realistic embeddings of cosmology / de sitter geometry into fundamental superstring / m - theories require tools beyond simple low - energy supergravity solutions  @xcite .",
    "higher rank form fields are natural ingredients of higher dimensional supergravity theories . in particular , in the attempt to construct cosmological solutions , form fields play a crucial role .",
    "they are utilized to stabilize the moduli fields associated with the shape of the extra dimensions  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , non - trivial background fluxes in the extra dimensional space generically induce exponential potentials for the volume modulus or radion .",
    "the applicability of such potentials for cosmological quintessence and inflaton fields was recently investigated in  @xcite .",
    "commonly the dynamics are analyzed within the effective four - dimensional theory , which has obvious limitations .",
    "most importantly , it requires a stable higher dimensional background configuration .",
    "the stability of background solutions is conveniently investigated by the study of linear perturbations .",
    "the analysis of perturbations in compactifications with effective four - dimensional de sitter geometry shows that it is not at all generic for finding stable background configurations .",
    "in particular , realistic scenarios with a large number of extra dimensions are plagued by two possible channels of instabilities in the scalar sector of perturbations .",
    "\\(i ) the nature and dynamics of the tachyonic instability of the lowest kaluza  klein state in the scalar spectrum  i.e .",
    ", the volume modulus  were investigated in  @xcite .",
    "the instability was recognized previously in  @xcite . the generic contribution that arises from a four - dimensional inflationary geometry with expansion rate @xmath0",
    "is given by @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the number of extra dimensions .",
    "it is possible to compensate this term with positive contributions from the curvature of the internal space ( if positive ) and from stabilizing bulk fields , e.g.  scalar fields or form fluxes .",
    "if not stabilized this tachyon indicates a non - linear reconfiguration of the compactification  @xcite .",
    "generic late - time attractors are universal kasner - like solutions , where the internal dimensions shrink to zero size , or complete decompactifications to a higher dimensional de sitter space , where all dimensions expand isotropically , or transitions towards regimes where the de sitter curvature is small and the tachyonic mode disappears .",
    "\\(ii ) it turns out that a second instability can arise from the quadrupole and higher moments of kaluza ",
    "klein excitations @xmath3 in the scalar sector .",
    "contrary to the instability of the volume modulus that can be stabilized due to the interaction with matter fields , this instability arises from the presence of non - trivial background configurations of matter fields .",
    "whereas the instability of the volume modulus ( that is , the kaluza  klein zero - mode ) preserves the spherical symmetry of the extra space , the second instability indicates a deformation of the internal geometry .",
    "although the tachyonic mode was noticed in  @xcite , its nature and consequences have not been explored so far and non - perturbative examples for this instability have not been studied yet .",
    "the range of values of the flux @xmath4 that allows for stable compactifications shrinks with the number of extra dimensions",
    ". for more than four extra dimensions , stable compactifications can not be found at all for this model .    on the other hand",
    ", the mass spectrum of vector and tensor perturbations does not reveal additional channels of instabilities . for the vector sector ,",
    "the lowest lying mass states are massless and independent of the matter fields .",
    "they transform in the adjoint representation of the isometry group of the internal manifold and their mass is protected by this local symmetry . unlike the scalar sector of perturbations , the coupling between matter and metric perturbations of the higher kaluza ",
    "klein vector modes does not lead to additional instabilities in the sector of vector perturbations .",
    "the lowest excitation of the tensor spectrum is the massless four - dimensional graviton , whose mass is protected by four - dimensional diffeomorphism invariance . besides the massless graviton a tower of positive kaluza ",
    "klein modes appears in the effective theory , whose scaling is only sensitive to the properties of the internal manifold .",
    "although the tachyonic instabilities render the discussion within the effective four - dimensional theory invalid , they may trigger interesting dynamics . the tachyonic scalars couple to the matter fields in the effective four - dimensional theory . in kaluza ",
    "klein compactifications the standard model fields of the effective four - dimensional theory are considered to be zero - modes of the higher dimensional theory .",
    "the unstable volume modulus couples gravitationally to such fields , which might lead to interesting phenomenological consequences such as tachyonic preheating of the standard model fields . in simple braneworld models",
    "the preheating of brane fields from the decaying radion was investigated in  @xcite .    in this paper , we present the complete analysis of the mass spectrum of perturbations around de sitter vacua in a unified way .",
    "we systematically treat scalar , vector and tensor perturbations .",
    "we choose the model of freund - rubin compactifications , where all spectra are obtained analytically .",
    "nevertheless , the qualitative results are expected to be valid for general de sitter compactifications with flux stabilization that are frequently discussed in the literature . in particular , we investigate the resulting spectrum in the context of inflation .",
    "light scalar modes ( with masses @xmath5 smaller than the inflation scale @xmath0 ) acquire a scale invariant spectrum of perturbations after inflation and therefore provide additional sources for cosmological perturbations .",
    "the mass scale of kaluza ",
    "klein excitations of vector and tensor modes is always larger than @xmath0 , so that no contribution to post - inflationary cosmology is expected .",
    "the analysis follows closely the calculations done in  @xcite but goes substantially beyond this for the case of vector perturbations and shape moduli fields , which have not been addressed in the framework of de sitter compactifications before .",
    "the calculation of the complete spectrum allows us to conclude that the tachyonic instability of de sitter compactifications is located in the scalar sector only .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : background ] , we set up the background solution for the de sitter compactification .",
    "the perturbations are introduced in sec .",
    "[ sec : perturbations ] . they are classified according to their transformation properties with respect to the de sitter isometry group .",
    "the equations of motion for the perturbations are obtained and their spectra calculated . in section  [ sec : applications ] , we discuss possible implications of the presence of light mass states for cosmological models . some technical details are shown in  [ sec : notation][sec : residual ] .",
    "we consider a @xmath6-dimensional product spacetime @xmath7 . like in freund - rubin compactification  @xcite , we allow for a @xmath2-form flux field that spontaneously compactifies @xmath2 of the spatial dimensions . for simplicity ,",
    "we assume that the compact space is a @xmath2-sphere  i.e . ,",
    "@xmath8 with radius @xmath9 .",
    "the generalization to any homogeneous space is straightforward .",

    "to compensate for the positive curvature of @xmath14 , a cosmological constant @xmath15 is introduced .",
    "we do not discuss the microscopical origin of the cosmological constant , but we assume that it is common to all dimensions . in principle , considering quantum effects , one can expect additional contributions from the casimir energy to the cosmological constant of the compact space .",
    "its contribution however strongly depends on the choice and the dimension of the compact manifold and we will assume that it can be neglected in comparison to the overall cosmological constant .",
    "the theory we study is described by the action @xmath16 from which the general equations of motion for the metric and the @xmath2-form field are derived @xmath17 the planar coordinate patch for @xmath10-dimensional de sitter geometry is parameterized by the coordinates @xmath18 and the @xmath2-dimensional sphere with radius @xmath9 is labeled by the coordinates @xmath19 @xmath20 throughout this work we use capital italic indices @xmath21 to address all spacetime dimensions .",
    "greek indices @xmath22 take values in @xmath23 and correspondingly @xmath24 are used to label the compactified dimensions . the static @xmath2-form flux that supports this compactification",
    "is given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the completely antisymmetric volume form of the @xmath2-sphere .",
    "the background is characterized by four parameters : the de sitter scale @xmath0 , the radius of compactification @xmath9 , the flux strength @xmath4 and the cosmological constant @xmath15 .",
    "the equations of motions  ( [ eq : eom1 ] ) and  ( [ eq : eom2 ] ) reduce to algebraic constraints in this space of parameters @xmath27 the last relation shows the requirement of a positive cosmological constant that compensates for the curvatures of the spacetime .",
    "the form field flux is an additional parameter that enriches the dynamics twofold . unlike the cosmological constant it is associated with a field degree of freedom .",
    "it is natural to consider perturbations of this field .",
    "secondly , it allows one to create a hierarchy between the hubble scale @xmath0 and the size of the internal manifold @xmath9 , which is needed if one wants to apply this background as approximate solution of the late - time universe , where @xmath28 .",
    "dirac s quantization condition requires @xmath4 to be quantized .",
    "although we treat @xmath4 effectively as a continuous parameter , its discrete nature is implied .    in the limit @xmath29 ,",
    "when the flux disappears , one recovers the known results for standard kaluza ",
    "klein compactifications .",
    "the range of values for the flux strength @xmath4 is limited by the physical restriction of @xmath30 .    from the first of the equations  ( [ eq : param_back ] ) follows that @xmath31 the limit @xmath32 corresponds to four - dimensional effective minkowski space geometry with @xmath33 .",
    "in this section we analyze the dynamics of perturbations in the background of freund - rubin compactifications introduced in the previous section . first the metric perturbations are grouped into scalar , vector and tensor perturbations .",
    "the gauge is fixed to eliminate gauge degrees of freedom that correspond to the infinitesimal coordinate transformations of the form @xmath34 similarly perturbations for the matter fields are introduced , grouped into scalars and vectors .",
    "gauge degrees of freedom associated with the transformation properties of the @xmath35-form gauge potential @xmath36 are fixed .",
    "the most general set of perturbations that respects the product geometry of the chosen background spacetime is parameterized by the following line element @xmath37 dx^\\mu    dx^\\nu+\\l[(1 + 2\\phi)g_{mn}+h_{(mn)}\\r]dy^mdy^n+v_{\\mu n}dx^\\mu dy^n\\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] that contains the scalars @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , vectors @xmath41 and the @xmath2-dimensional traceless graviton @xmath42 . throughout this paper , indices in parentheses",

    "it is customary to further decompose the vectors and tensor into longitudinal and transverse parts , e.g.  @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "however , this decomposition is only relevant for the zero - modes  that is , for the @xmath46-independent sector .",
    "the gauge choice that we impose below in equations  ( [ eq : dedonder ] ) has a residual gauge freedom that allows us to impose @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 for the @xmath46-independent perturbations , [ cf.equations  ( [ eq : res_constraint ] ) ] .",
    "for more details on the residual gauge freedom we refer to the calculations in  [ sec : residual ] . in the massive  i.e . , @xmath46-dependent sector these fields become the longitudinal components of the vectors @xmath41 and tensor @xmath42 .",
    "after compactification and integrating out the extra dimensions , the graviton of the effective four - dimensional theory is not canonically normalized unless the metric @xmath50 is rescaled by an appropriate weyl transformation , cf .",
    "[ sec : weyl ] . on the linear level",
    "this amounts to the redefinition of the scalar perturbation @xmath38 by the so - called weyl shift @xmath51 to fix the gauge and to obtain equations of motion in a suitable form the de donder gauge conditions are imposed @xmath52 the de donder conditions are trivially satisfied for the @xmath46-independent perturbations .",
    "therefore , @xmath41 consists of @xmath2 homogeneous vectors and @xmath40 contains @xmath53 homogeneous scalars . for inhomogeneous perturbations ,",
    "the de donder gauge imposes one condition on the vector fields @xmath41 and @xmath2 conditions among the scalars @xmath40 .",
    "therefore , @xmath41 represents @xmath54 massive vectors and @xmath40 contains @xmath55 scalars .",
    "the missing vector and scalar modes are reshuffled to the longitudinal polarizations of the graviton and the remaining vectors .",
    "this has been shown explicitly for compactifications on a @xmath2-dimensional torus in  @xcite .",

    "the remaining residual gauge transformations will be discussed in  [ sec : residual ] .",
    "next we provide the notation for the form field perturbations and the gauge choice analogous to the notation of  @xcite .",
