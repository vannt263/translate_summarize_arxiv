    "it is known that neutrinos are massless within the standard model , contrary to this , plethora of neutrino oscillation experiments confirm that neutrinos change their flavor while propagating from source to detector , thus providing evidence that neutrios are massive  @xcite__. _ _ general trend to accommodate the masses of neutrino through effective four fermions operator is extensively discussed in literature @xcite .",
    "the effective operators approach provides a plausible way to study the effects of new interactions in low energy electroweak precision measurements .",
    "these new interactions are predicted by various models such as r - parity violating supersymmetric model @xcite , heavy neutral vector bosons @xmath4model and the lepto - quarks model @xcite .",
    "the electroweak precision measurements have verified the universality and flavor conserving processes of the sm @xcite .",
    "but if neutrinos are given masses then it is strongly suggested that it may have some new interactions at some high energy scale @xmath5@xcite .",
    "such interactions are called nonstandard neutrino interactions ( nsis ) .",
    "the nsis include nonuniversal flavor conserving as well as flavor changing currents ( also called flavor diagonal and flavor non - diagonal , respectively ) , contrary to the standard model where both charge current ( cc ) and neutral current ( nc ) are universal and flavor conserving .",
    "to explore new physics , the study of nonuniversality and flavor violation couplings is of crucial importance .",
    "currently , constraining nsi coupling parameters , both in model dependent and model idependent way , are extensively studied in electroweak precision measurements @xcite .",
    "we study nsis arising in neutrino - fermion scattering processes and focus on the elastic @xmath1scattering .",
    "the major interest in this process is due to the fact that it is one of the few processes for which sm predicts a large distructive interference between cc and nc , thus provides the reason for lowering the @xmath6 cross section by 40% compared to that in the absence of interference .",
    "the presence of interference effect has been discovered by ccfr neutrino experiment at fermilab @xcite and successively improved the results by lampf and short baseline terrestrial lsnd experiments  @xcite , and found good agreements with the theory .",
    "the discovery of interference effect has provided a crucial test for varifying the gauge structure of sm bkayser .",
    "the inteference effect is deeply concerned with the fact that it can occur if the incoming and out going neutrinos are the same in a scattering process .",
    "for instance , in @xmath1scattering the interference could occur only if the incoming and out going neutrinos are @xmath7@xcite .",
    "we exploit this logic to study nsis using interference effect .",
    "this effect can be used both for constraining nsis in universal flavor conserving scatering and for knowing the guage structure of any new physics .",
    "based on the fact of flavor conservation ( incoming and out going neutrino should be the same ) we can not ignore the interference between cc , nc as estiblished in sm , and in addition , the interference of nsis with cc , nc .",
    "these facts impose us to reexamine the strength of interference in the presence of nsi .",
    "if there exists any nsis at low energy , it must interfere with the cc and nc of the sm .",
    "more accurate strength of total interference can be obtain using more and more accurate measurements of @xmath1scatterings @xcite .    _",
    "an important aspect of the interferecnce parameter is that its strength is energy independent .",
    "whatever energy is used for scattering , the total strength of interference is the same . using this reasoning , we can use interference effect as a probe to investigate any nsis , if exist .",
    "the impacts of interference between sm interactions and nsis  has been discussed in ref .",
    "it is shown in this ref.@xcite that how a small residual nsis could interfere with sm interacations and leads to a drastic loss in sensitivity in _",
    "_ in this paper , we investigate nsis using interference as parameter in the low energy _ @xmath1scattering process . _",
    "the same analysis can be performed for the other scattering processes like _",

    "w__e demonstrate how interference parameter can be used to constrain nsis .",
    "we obtain new bounds on nsis using interference parameter following the approach of keeping one operator at a time .",
    "the lower bounds on _ _ @xmath11 _ _  and _ _ @xmath12__obtained are more _ _ _ stringent in our case where as upper bounds relax the allowed region .",
    "these bounds are complimentary to one or another obtained using various different methods in ref @xcite . on the other hand , we obtain a single allowed region instead of four .",
    "four allowed regions are obtained when neutinos and anti - neutrino data is similtaneously used .",
