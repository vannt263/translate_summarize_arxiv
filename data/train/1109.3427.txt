    "this paper derives the averaged mhd - equations for oscillating flows .",
    "the resulting equations are similar to the original mhd - equations , but surprisingly ( instead of commonly expected reynolds stresses ) the _ drift velocity _ ( or just _ the drift _ ) plays a part of an additional advection velocity .",
    "it is known that the drift can appear from either lagrangian or eulerian considerations .",
    "the _ lagrangian drift _ appears as the average motion of lagrangian particles and its theory is often based on the averaging of odes , see @xcite . in this paper",
    "we focus on the _ eulerian drift _ , which appears as the results of the eulerian averaging of related pdes without addressing the motion of particles , see @xcite .",
    "the detailed materials about the eulerian drift can be found in @xcite .    to derive the averaged equations we employ the two - timing method ,",
    "e.g. _ @xcite .",
    "we expose it as an elementary , systematic , and justifiable procedure that follows the form developed by @xcite .",
    "this mathematical procedure is complemented by a novel material on the distinguished limit , which allows to find the proper slow time - scale .",
    "we introduce functions of variables @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 , which in the text below serve as dimensionless cartesian coordinates , slow time , and fast time .",
    "the class @xmath3 of _ hat - functions _ is defined as @xmath4 where the @xmath2-dependence is always @xmath5-periodic ; the dependencies on @xmath6 and @xmath7 are not specified .    for an arbitrary @xmath8 the _ averaging operation _ is @xmath9 where during the @xmath2-integration @xmath10 and @xmath11 does not depend on @xmath12 .",
    "the class @xmath13 of _ tilde - functions _ is such that @xmath14 the tilde - functions are also called purely oscillating functions ( _ @xmath13-function _ represents a special case of @xmath3-function with zero average ) .    the class @xmath15 of _ bar - functions _ is defined as @xmath16 ( any @xmath3-function can be uniquely separated into its @xmath15- and @xmath13- parts with the use of ( [ oper-1 ] ) )    _ @xmath13-integration ( or tilde - integration ) _ : for a given @xmath17 we introduce a new function @xmath18 called the @xmath13-integral of @xmath17 : @xmath19 which represents the unique solution of a pde @xmath20 ( with an unknown function @xmath18 and a known function @xmath17 ) supplemented by the condition @xmath21 ( [ oper-2 ] ) .",

    "one can see that ( [ strat - eqns ] ) is mathematically equivalent to the system of equations for an incompressible stratified fluid , written in boussinesq s approximation .",
    "the effective ` gravity field ' @xmath137 is non - homogeneous that makes the analogy with a ` standard ' stratified fluid non - complete .",
    "nevertheless one can see that any increasing function @xmath138 ( taken from the shear flow @xmath139 ) produces ` taylor instability ' of an inversely stratified equilibrium .",
    "it leads to the growth of longitudinal vortices and can be connected to langmuir circulations , see @xcite .",
    "the consideration of this paper is based on the assumption that the enforced frequency @xmath67 ( [ scales ] ) of oscillations is higher than all intrinsic frequencies .",
    "this frequency appears in our theory via the prescribed potential velocity @xmath101 ( [ eqn-0 - 0-h ] ) .",
    "the prescribed oscillatory velocity @xmath101 can be caused by different factors .",
    "for example , it can be produced by oscillations of boundaries or appear in full viscous theory after the matching of external flow with boundary - layer solution .",
    "the latter option is often considered , see @xcite .    \\3 . to justify the distinguished limit ( [ tau - s - h ] ) mathematically",

    "the following statement can be proven : for @xmath140 ( [ drift - vel ] ) and the function @xmath141 ( with a constant @xmath142 ) all solutions with @xmath143 contain secular terms , while all equations with @xmath144 produce a controversial ( unsolvable ) equations of successive approximations . if @xmath145 then the statement is different but we do not describe it here .",
    "the proof is omitted .",
    "the higher approximations of the averaged equation ( [ eqn-3-bar1 - 1 ] ) can be derived .",
    "they are especially useful for the study of motions with @xmath145 .",
    "in particular , one can show that in this case langmuir circulations cab be still generated by a similar mechanism .",
    "the viscosity and diffusivity can be routinely incorporated in ( [ eqn-3-bar1 - 1 ] ) as the rhs - terms @xmath147 and @xmath148 .",
    "accordingly , viscous and diffusion terms will appear in the equations ( [ eqn-3-bar1-vel ] ) and ( [ strat - eqns ] ) .",
    "at the same time after the incorporation of viscosity one more small parameter appears in the list ( [ small - pars - h ] ) , and the distinguished limit should be reconsidered .",
    "the abolishing of the requirement of a vanishing mean flow in zeroth approximation ( [ mean0 ] ) is also straightforward .",
    "however in this case the distinguished limit ( [ tau - s - h ] ) is different and the resulted averaged equations are more complicated than ( [ eqn-3-bar1 - 1 ] ) .    \\11 . for the finite and time - dependent flow domain",
    "@xmath149 the definition of average ( [ oper-1 ] ) directly works only if @xmath150 at any instant .",
    "if at some instant @xmath151 then the theory should include a ` projection ' of the boundary condition on the ` undisturbed ' boundary .",
    "such a consideration requires the smallness of the amplitude @xmath152 of spatial oscillations of fluid particles .",
    "however one can see that @xmath153 and hence @xmath154 ( [ small - pars - h ] ) .",
    "therefore the considering of a time - dependent domain does not introduce any new small parameter , and the distinguished limit ( [ tau - s - h ] ) will stay the same . in particular , it means that our small parameter @xmath155 is the same as the dimensional slope of free surface in the theory of langmuir circulations by @xcite",
    "the determining of the function @xmath138 in ( [ strat - eqns ] ) ( for real langmuir circulations ) requires an additional theory which includes viscosity or turbulent tangential stresses at the free surface .",
    "it is interesting , that from this viewpoint an ` unstable stratification ' can be continuously generated and amplified by tangential stresses applied at free surface .",
    "we do not compete here with the theories by @xcite , which describe this phenomenon well .",
    "one can suggest that since the equations ( [ eqn-3-bar1 - 1 ] ) for @xmath156 do describe a mechanism of vortex dynamo , and the mathematical structure of the full averaged equations ( [ eqn-3-bar1 - 1]),([eqn-3-bar1 - 1-model ] ) with @xmath157 is similar , then these full equations could also describe a possible mechanism of mhd - dynamo , such as the generation of the magnetic field of the earth .",
