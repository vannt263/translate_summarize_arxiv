    "if both lines can not be resolved , only _ one _ cyclotron resonance is observed at the frequency of the center of gravity . if the cyclotron resonances of both ion species can be resolved , both line centers are shifted to lower frequencies .",

    "the number of ions counted by the microchannel plate detector after each irradiation of the stored ion cloud with radiofrequency and ejection from the trap is subdivided into at least three count - rate classes with comparable average ion counts @xmath71 . a possible shift induced by a _ contamination _",

    "it becomes sharper and is shifted to @xmath296 for thallium , distinct and narrow for mercury but very much pronounced and broader for gold and platinum .",
    "+ the slopes of the isotopic chains of lead , thallium and mercury are almost identical in the region where data are available for the same neutron number .",
    "only the odd - even staggering is much more pronounced for the thallium isotopes as compared to those of lead and mercury . +",
    "down to neutron number @xmath297 , the slope of the charge radii for the isotopes of gold and platinum is a little bit smaller than for the other isotopic chains which indicates increasing deformation . for @xmath296 in the case of mercury and @xmath298 for gold",
    "a sudden change of the charge radii is observed which is due to a sharp change in deformation .",
    "+ comparing the slopes of pairing parameters with those of the charge radii , one observes that the extremely sharp discontinuity at the shell closure at @xmath274 is visible in the charge radii only as a small kink in their slope , that the pronounced increase of deformation at mid - shell @xmath24 is reflected as a local minimum in the pairing parameters , and that the size of the odd - even staggering in the pairing parameter @xmath291 is not reflected in the size of the one of the charge radii .",
    "there is an interesting observation : for thallium an unusual odd - even staggering between the isomers below mass number @xmath299 is observed . +",
    "the new data obtained in this region of the nuclear chart near @xmath300 will hopefully stimulate theoretical work to develop nuclear models further which are able to describe simultaneously experimental mean square charge radii as well as experimental masses of spherical and deformed nuclei in a satisfactory way .",
    "up to now , only little attention has been paid to such investigations which concern model - independent gross properties of nuclear matter .",
    "for example , the charge radii are only poorly described by macroscopic - microscopic mass models which are , however , quite successful in describing nuclear masses @xcite .",
    "even more demanding is a description of the odd - even staggering of masses and of the charge radii as attempted in ref .",
    "@xcite for spherical nuclei .",
    "the fine structure of the mass surface is important for the elucidation of the dramatic shape changes that appear so suddenly in this region of the nuclear chart . for most of the nuclides that were investigated in this work",
    "a clear mass - to - state assignment was possible .",
    "few exceptions due to an insufficient resolving power during the measurement are the nuclides @xmath4 , @xmath118 , @xmath301 , and @xmath137 .",
    "spectroscopic data giving production ratios could assist these identifications using eq .",
    "( [ 54 - 10 ] ) .",
    "the excitation energies of bismuth isotopes ( odd - odd nuclei ) suffer from particulary high uncertainties .",
    "hence , these cases should be addressed in a future mass measurement requiring the following conditions : ( i ) if the half - lives of the states are sufficiently long in order to allow an extremely high - resolution measurement : a mass resolution of , for example , @xmath302 can be obtained with an excitation time of @xmath232 . in these cases",
    "the count - rate - class analysis can give a meaningful interpretation , _",
    "i.e. _ a possible contamination is detected .",
    "( ii ) similar to the measurements of both states of @xmath303 @xcite , a narrow - band laser ionization with a bandwidth of @xmath304 can be used to selectively ionize one of the states . as a prerequisite",
    ", the element of interest has to be accessible for laser ionization and the hyperfine structure splitting of the isomeric components with different nuclear spin has to be known .",
    "( iii ) in cases where the half - life is not sufficiently long to perform a measurement with extended excitation time , the mass determination should be supported by nuclear spectroscopy in order to enable a clear identification of states . + * acknowledgements * + we gratefully acknowledge the isolde technical group and the rilis group for assistance during the experiments .",
