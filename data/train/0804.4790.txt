    "the study of _ knotted graphs _ in @xmath2-manifolds is a natural generalization of classical knot theory , with potential applications to chemistry and biology ( see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite ) . in knot theory ,",
    "extensive knot tables have been built up through the work of many mathematicians ( see _ e.g. _ conway  @xcite and hoste  thistlethwaite  weeks  @xcite ) .",
    "there has been much less work on the tabulation of knotted graphs , but some knotted graphs in @xmath6 have been enumerated in order of crossing number by simon  @xcite , litherland  @xcite , moriuchi  @xcite , and chiodo  et .",
    "al .  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we classify the simplest trivalent graphs in general closed @xmath2-manifolds .",
    "we first enumerate them using a notion of complexity which extends matveev s definition for @xmath2-manifolds  @xcite , and then we classify them with the help of geometric invariants , mostly defined using hyperbolic geometry .",
    "more precisely , the objects considered in this paper are pairs @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a closed , connected orientable @xmath2-manifold and @xmath3 is a trivalent graph in @xmath1 . the graph @xmath3 may contain loops and multiple edges , and is possibly disconnected ( in particular , @xmath3 can be a knot or a link ) . to avoid `` wild '' embeddings we work in the piecewise linear category :",
    "thus @xmath1 is a pl - manifold and @xmath3 is a 1-dimensional subcomplex , and we aim to classify graphs up to pl - homeomorphisms of pairs .",
    "following  @xcite , a compact polyhedron @xmath7 is called _ simple _ if the link of every point of @xmath7 embeds in the 1-skeleton of the tetrahedron ( the complete graph with 4 vertices ) .",
    "points having the whole of this graph as a link are called _ vertices _ of @xmath7 . moreover , as defined in  @xcite , @xmath7 is a _ spine _ of a pair @xmath0 if it embeds in @xmath1 so that its complement is a finite union of balls intersecting @xmath3 in the simplest possible ways , as shown in figure  [ balls : fig ]",
    ".     balls in the complement of a spine . ]    as usual in complexity theory , the complexity @xmath8 is then defined as the minimal number of vertices in a simple spine of @xmath0 .",
    "the case considered in  @xcite is actually that of 3-orbifolds , but the definition of complexity is the same as just given , except that a contribution of the edge labels is also introduced .",
    "when @xmath9 we recover the original definition of matveev , thus getting the equality @xmath10 . in general , we have @xmath11 .    for manifolds , matveev showed that complexity is additive under connected sum and that it behaves particularly well on _",
    "irreducible _ manifolds ( _ i.e. _  manifolds in which every 2-sphere bounds a 3-ball ) . in particular , there exist only finitely many irreducible manifolds with given complexity .",
    "these facts extend to the context of the pairs @xmath0 described above , with the following notion of irreducibility : @xmath0 is _",
    "@xmath4-irreducible _ if every 2-sphere embedded in @xmath1 and meeting @xmath3 transversely in at most two points bounds a ball intersecting @xmath3 as in figure  [ balls : fig ] , left or centre ( in particular , there exists no 2-sphere meeting @xmath3 in one point ) .",
    "this paper is devoted to the enumeration and the geometric investigation of all @xmath4-irreducible graphs @xmath0 of small complexity .",
    "as usual in @xmath2-dimensional topology , a key role in the study of our graphs is played by invariants coming from hyperbolic geometry , which in particular provided the tools we used in most cases to distinguish the pairs from each other .    while the complement of @xmath3 in @xmath1 very often has no hyperbolic structure with geodesic boundary ( for instance , it is often a handlebody ) , most pairs @xmath0 are indeed hyperbolic in a more general sense , namely they are _ hyperbolic with parabolic meridians_. this means that @xmath12 carries a metric of constant sectional curvature @xmath13 which completes to a manifold with non - compact geodesic boundary having :    * toric cusps at the knot components of @xmath3 , * annular cusps at the meridians of the edges of @xmath3 , and * geodesic 3-punctured boundary spheres at the vertices of @xmath3 .",
    "this hyperbolic structure is the natural analogue of the complete hyperbolic structure on a knot or link complement and is also useful when studying orbifold structures on @xmath0 .    by mostow - prasad rigidity ,",
    "a hyperbolic structure with parabolic meridians is unique if it exists , so its geometric invariants only depend on @xmath0 .",
    "one can therefore use the volume and kojima s canonical decomposition  @xcite to distinguish hyperbolic graphs .",
    "for the pairs in our list we have constructed and analyzed the hyperbolic structure using the computer program _ orb _ , written by the first named author  @xcite .    since knots and links have already been widely studied in many contexts , this paper focuses mostly on graphs containing vertices .",
    "table  [ hyp : num : tab ] gives a summary of our results .",
    "up to complexity @xmath14 our census of hyperbolic graphs @xmath0 is complete and contains @xmath15 elements , consisting of 5 knots , 24 @xmath16-graphs , 13 handcuffs , and 3 distinct connected graphs with four vertices .",
    "the graph types occurring are shown in figure  [ g : types : fig ] . in complexity 5",
    "we decided to rule out knot components , and we found 78 more hyperbolic graphs .",
    "out of our 123 graphs , 36 lie in @xmath6 .",
    ".*numbers of hyperbolic graphs .",
    "* when @xmath17 we have not investigated graphs having knot components .",
    "the other graph types not mentioned were all investigated and found to have no representative.[hyp : num : tab ] [ cols=\"<,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]      a surgery presentation of the pair @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 is a singular fibre of the fibration . ]      in complexity 5 we have only investigated pairs @xmath0 where @xmath3 is non - empty and all its components have vertices .",
    "as mentioned above , we have found here 5 very interesting pairs , where @xmath3 is a @xmath16-graph and the pair @xmath0 is @xmath4-irreducible , but non - hyperbolic since @xmath21 contains an embedded klein bottle , so it is not atoroidal .",
    "[ klein : irred : prop ] there are five @xmath4-irreducible non - hyperbolic pairs @xmath0 such that @xmath22 and @xmath3 has no knot component .",
    "they are described as follows :    * let @xmath23 be the twisted interval bundle over the klein bottle .",
    "* let @xmath24 be the solid torus with the embedded @xmath16-graph shown in figure  [ theta_in_torus ] .",
    "* then @xmath0 is obtained by gluing @xmath23 to @xmath24 so that @xmath1 is one of the manifolds @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , or @xmath29 .     the theta graph @xmath16 in the solid torus @xmath30 . ]",
    "this result was proved as follows .",
    "we first analyzed the triangulations of the @xmath31 pairs @xmath0 produced by our haskell code on which _ orb _ failed to construct a hyperbolic structure .",
    "this allowed us to show that the @xmath31 pairs are those described in points ( i)-(iii ) of the statement , whence to see that they are not hyperbolic .",
    "we then proved that they are indeed ( 0,1,2)-irreducible by classical topological techniques , the key point being that a compressing disc of @xmath24 must intersect @xmath16 in at least two points .",
    "here are the details of the argument .",
    "suppose there is a sphere @xmath32 intersecting @xmath3 transversely in at most @xmath5 points , and isotope @xmath32 to minimize its intersection with @xmath33 . now consider an innermost disc @xmath34 on @xmath32 bounded by a simple closed curve in @xmath35 .",
    "since there is no compressing disc in @xmath23 , such a disc must be a compressing disc in @xmath30 , so it must intersect @xmath16 at least twice .",
    "but if @xmath36 then there are at least two innermost discs on @xmath32 , whence @xmath37 contains at least 4 points , which is impossible .",
    "this shows that @xmath32 is disjoint from @xmath33 , so it is contained either in @xmath23 or in @xmath30 . however @xmath23 is irreducible , and @xmath24 is @xmath4-irreducible ( in fact , it is easy to see that it is hyperbolic with parabolic meridians )",
    ". therefore @xmath32 must bound a trivial ball in @xmath0 .",
    "this section contains pictures of the hyperbolic graphs up to complexity 4 , given in the form of a surgery description when the underlying space is not @xmath6 . for each graph",
