    "the origin of the observed pattern of fermion masses and mixings is one of the great open questions in particle physics . in this context , it is particularly challenging to explain the strong hierarchy among the masses of the three families of quarks and charged leptons , as well as the strong suppression of the neutrino masses and the fact that quark mixings are small whereas there is large mixing between mass and flavour eigenstates in the lepton sector .",
    "one possibility to address the fermion mass hierarchy is to introduce family symmetries which allow yukawa couplings , in particular for the first and second generation , only via higher - dimensional effective operators leading to a certain suppression compared to apparently natural @xmath13 values .",
    "an interesting observation in this context is that in supersymmetric theories with large ( or medium ) @xmath14 , the yukawa couplings of each of the three generations of fermions in the up - quark , down - quark and charged lepton sector are of similar order of magnitude .",
    "this observation can have an explanation in grand unified theories ( guts ) , where not only the gauge interactions of the standard model ( sm ) emerge from one unified gauge group , but also the quarks and leptons are unified in joint representations . in these theories ,",
    "the yukawa couplings for different types of fermions of one generation can be generated from common operators involving the gut representations .",
    "after gut symmetry breaking the resulting yukawa couplings typically have similar values . furthermore , depending on the specific operator , the group theoretical clebsch factors from gut symmetry breaking can lead to predictions for the ratios between the yukawa couplings ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "such relations , after evolving them from the gut scale to low energies via their renormalisation group equations and including threshold effects @xcite , can be compared to experimental results for the quark masses and provide crucial tests of unified models of fermion masses and mixings .    when testing the predictions of supersymmetric ( susy ) guts for quark and lepton mass ratios @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 the @xmath14-enhanced susy threshold corrections are of particular importance , as has been emphasized recently in @xcite . including the @xmath14-enhanced susy threshold corrections the allowed values of the gut scale yukawa couplings and their ratios",
    "have been calculated in @xcite for example ranges of low energy susy parameters .",
    "it has also been pointed out in @xcite that the presence of susy threshold corrections can open up new possibilities for gut model building .",
    "the goal of this study is to investigate which new predictions for yukawa coupling ratios at the gut scale can arise in unified models and whether they can be realised in common scenarios of susy breaking in a phenomenologically acceptable way . for this purpose",
    "we consider the three susy breaking schemes mamsb @xcite , mgmsb @xcite and cmssm @xcite which provide boundary conditions for the soft susy breaking parameters at high energies . as phenomenological constraints we will apply observables from electroweak precision data , @xmath4 physics , @xmath5 , mass limits on sparticles from direct searches as well as , optionally , dark matter constraints .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in section 2 we investigate possible predictions for gut scale ratios of quark and lepton masses ( or yukawa couplings ) in unified theories . in section 3",
    "we calculate the allowed gut scale ranges for the ratios @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 in mamsb , mgmsb and cmssm taking phenomenological constraints into account .",
    "the results of section 3 are independent of the details of the underlying gut theory .",
    "section 4 contains the comparison of possible theory predictions for the gut scale ratios with the phenomenologically allowed ranges . in section 5",
    "we summarise our main results and conclude .",
    "in the following , we will consider unified theories where the fermions of the sm are unified in representations of the unifying gauge group .",
    "we will focus on supersymmetric @xmath15 guts where the symmetry breaking to the mssm proceeds via the @xmath16 or pati - salam ( ps ) breaking chain at the gut scale @xmath17  gev .",
    "we will perform our analysis at the stage of @xmath16 or ps unification for simplicity , however our choice of possible gut higgs representations will be motivated by the embedding into @xmath15 guts . within such unified theories",
    "the yukawa couplings emerge from operators involving the joint fermion representations as well as higgs fields in gut representations of which one has to contain an electroweak higgs .",
    "each such operator thus in general generates yukawa couplings for different types of fermions , for example for down - type quarks as well as for charged leptons , which are related to each other by the group theoretical clebsch factors from the breaking of the gut symmetry to the mssm .",
    "let us now clarify under which conditions such relations lead to observable predictions for quark and lepton masses .",
    "one condition , which results in simple relations between entries of the yukawa matrices and the quark and charged lepton masses is that the yukawa matrices in the flavour basis are hierarchical and dominated by the diagonal elements .",
    "this situation is approximately realised in many approaches to unified model building , but only regarding the second and third generation . then",
    ", the masses of the second generation of quarks and charged leptons are related to the ( 2,2)-entries of the yukawa matrices and the masses of the third generation to the ( 3,3)-entries . for the masses of the first generation of fermions the condition is often violated and the relation to the elements of the yukawa matrices often depends on additional assumptions , e.g.  if there is a texture zero in the ( 1,1)-entry of the yukawa matrices ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "we will therefore focus mainly on the second and third generation in our analysis .",
    "the second condition is that there is one operator which dominates the relevant element of the yukawa matrices .",
    "this requirement is necessary because if , for instance , two operators would contribute with similar strength , the resulting prediction would be an intermediate value . in the following",
    "we will therefore assume that these two conditions are satisfied to good approximation .",
    "there are two examples of quark and lepton mass relations at the gut scale which are ubiquitous in many classes of unified models of flavour .",
    "these are third family yukawa unification ( or @xmath18-@xmath19 unification ) and the so - called georgi - jarlskog ( gj ) relations @xcite ( i.e.  @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) .",
    "let us briefly review them in the context of @xmath16 guts to give an explicit example : in @xmath16 guts , the @xmath22 singlet down - type quarks ( in three colours ) as well as the @xmath22 doublet leptons of the @xmath23-th generation are contained in the fundamental representation @xmath24 while @xmath22 doublet quarks as well as singlet up - type quarks and charged leptons are contained in a ten - dimensional matter representation @xmath25 ( see section [ sec : su5 ] for more details ) . if the yukawa matrix ( 3,3)-entries for down - type quarks and charged leptons are generated by an operator of the form @xmath26 where the five - dimensional @xmath27 contains an electroweak higgs @xmath22 doublet , then it is easy to see that the resulting prediction is @xmath28 , i.e.  approximate @xmath18-@xmath19 unification . on the other hand ,",
    "if the relevant ( 2,2)-entry of the yukawa matrices is generated by the operator @xmath29 with electroweak higgs fields contained in the @xmath30-dimensional representation @xmath31 then @xmath32 is predicted .",
    "this can be understood from the fact that the @xmath30-dimensional representation is traceless and the factor of @xmath33 for the charged leptons thus has to compensate the colour factor of @xmath34 for the quarks .",
    "in addition to @xmath18-@xmath19 unification and the gj relations there are various alternative relations between quark and lepton masses which can emerge from higher - dimensional operators in unified theories , as we will now discuss",
    ".      when the conditions specified in section [ sec : conditions ] are satisfied , the predicted relations between quark and lepton masses at the gut scale depend on the specific operator which dominates the relevant entries of the yukawa matrices .",
    "the simplest types of operators in this context are the renormalisable ones , for example the operators mentioned above which lead to @xmath18-@xmath19 unification and the gj relation for the second generation .",
    "the different predictions result from different higgs representations which can contain the electroweak higgs(es ) . here",
    "the general procedure to obtain the possible predictions for the yukawa coupling ratios is as follows : the operators include two matter and one higgs field . for the matter fields we take the common matter representations of the unified theories . by fixing two of the three fields , the possible representations of the higgs field are fixed by the condition that the operator has to be a gauge singlet after contracting all gauge indices and that the higgs field has to include the usual sm ( mssm ) higgs(es ) .",
    "explicit expressions for the matter fields and the higgs vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) will be given later .",
    "new possibilities , in addition to the ratios @xmath35 and @xmath33 can arise in particular when effective , higher - dimensional operators are taken into account . as has been discussed in the introduction , in many unified flavour models using family symmetries to explain the observed fermion mass hierarchy , the renormalisable ( dimension - four ) operators",
    "are forbidden by symmetry , and the yukawa couplings are generated from higher - dimensional operators in the effective theory limit .",
    "these non - renormalisable operators are typically generated from integrating out messenger fields @xmath36 and @xmath37 ( c.f .",
    "figure [ fig : messenger ] ) .",
    "the fields @xmath38 , @xmath4 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 can be either a matter field or a higgs field . in total",
    "the effective operator has to contain two matter fields , one higgs field which breaks electroweak symmetry and one higgs field with a gut scale vev .",
    "the latter must only break the unified gauge symmetry but not the electroweak symmetry . at low energies ,",
    "the yukawa operators of the sm ( mssm ) are realised with some of the yukawa couplings related to each other due to the underlying unified group structure .     and @xmath37",
    ". when the messenger fields are effectively integrated out of the theory below their mass scales , higher - dimensional operators are generated which can lead to gut relations between quark and lepton masses .",

    "softsusy runs in loops to achieve consistency with high scale boundary conditions as well as with low scale input , thereby determining @xmath54 . from softsusy we read out the masses of the quarks and charged leptons at the gut scale .",

    "the large logs appearing in the formulae in @xcite are already resummed in the gauge couplings and therefore are not included anymore ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "for the first two generations we have also set the external momenta of the fermions to zero .",
    "this provides a very good approximation since corrections are of the order of @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the mass of the corresponding ( light ) fermion and @xmath57 is the mass scale of the susy particles involved in the loops .",
    "we have also updated the experimental data on the quark masses according to @xcite .",

    "for example , in the mamsb scenario for @xmath63  gev , @xmath64  tev and @xmath65 we obtain @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "this large mixing can be understood from the fact that the splitting between the sfermion mass eigenstates in the example is mainly driven by the mass of the fermion . then both , the numerator and the denominator of eq .",

    "in addition , we have also made softsusy reject parameter points where the calculated susy threshold corrections are so large that the perturbative expansion is spoiled .    regarding the calculation of the experimental constraints , for some of them we have exported the spectrum calculated from softsusy to micromegas 2.2 cpc @xcite using the slha @xcite interface .",

    "however , for the outcome of our study it makes no difference if they are included or excluded .",
    "we have furthermore included constraints from electroweak precision observables ( ewpo ) such as the w boson mass @xmath68 and the effective leptonic weak mixing angle @xmath69 .",

    "however , other particles may contribute to dark matter in addition to a neutralino lsp , which relaxes this bound to the requirement that the relic density of the neutralino , which we require to be the lsp , should not exceed the dark matter observed by wmap .",
    "we will discuss this relaxed bound separately in the following , since it may be taken as a possible constraint under additional assumptions .",
    "however , since it can be avoided if , for instance , the cosmological evolution is `` nonstandard '' or if a small amount of r - parity violation is introduced , we do not include it in our final results .",
    "furthermore , in mgmsb the gravitino is the lsp and its relic density depends on its mass , which we treat as a free parameter in this setup such that no constraint can be applied .      the results for the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon @xmath5 ( or for the parameter @xmath89 ,",
    "respectively ) are still not completely settled .",

    "three other recent evaluations yield slightly different numbers @xcite . because of the discrepancies between the electron and the @xmath19 data and the slight differences in the theoretical predictions we only use as constraint that the susy contributions to @xmath5 have the right sign to make @xmath93 smaller and that they are not too large , @xmath94 .    for the calculation of",

    "the anomalous magnetic moment receives also larger corrections for smaller smuon and muon - sneutrino masses and larger neutralino and chargino masses .",
    "furthermore , we can also see the dependence on the sign of @xmath97 .",

    "compared to the yellow squads indicating the values calculated without taking the susy threshold corrections into account , we see that all ratios are reduced .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , the reason for this is that the sign of the dominant @xmath14-enhanced correction parameter @xmath106 is negative for negative gluino mass @xmath107 when @xmath97 is positive , which enhances the down - type yukawa couplings at the susy scale and finally lowers the possible values of the ratios at @xmath108 .",
    "large susy threshold corrections , and thus lower values of the gut scale ratios correspond to large @xmath14 .",
    "the plots also show that there is a strong correlation between @xmath102 and @xmath103 , which stems from the fact that the masses of the first two sfermion generations are very similar .",
    "one can see from the plots how the phenomenological constraints restrict the possible effects of the threshold corrections on the gut scale ratios .",
    "first of all , a sparticle spectrum free of tachyons already excludes values of @xmath109 below about 200 gev .",
    "furthermore , we found that large values of @xmath14 above 50 did not lead to a viable spectrum .",
    "these parameter points were rejected by the numerics and are not displayed in figure [ fig : finalresults ] . in the parameter range we considered ( and for points with a tachyon - free spectrum ) , the strongest constraint was @xmath74 ( c.f .  the first row of figure [ fig : plots_mamsb ] ) , which disfavours large values of @xmath14 . in mamsb , ewpo ( c.f .  the second row of figure [ fig : plots_mamsb ] ) also provide a significant constraint and disfavour large values of @xmath14 .",
    "compared to @xmath74 and ewpo , the limits from @xmath110 and @xmath5 are much less constraining . including all constraints the minimal allowed @xmath109 raises to about 600  gev and the maximal @xmath14 reduces to about 45 .    finally , under the assumption that the neutralino is the lsp , stable due to r - parity , and that the evolution of the universe is standard up to temperatures where the lsp freezes out , the lsp relic density could be used as an additional constraint .",
    "in particular the parameter points which lead to a lsp relic density larger than the dark matter density or where the lsp is charged would be excluded . the impact which this constraint would have",
    "is shown in the third row of figure [ fig : plots_mamsb ] .",

    "compared to the case of mamsb and following the arguments of section [ sec : constraints_mamsb ] , positive @xmath107 with positive @xmath97 leads to a positive threshold correction parameter @xmath106 which lowers the down - type yukawa couplings and consequently enlarges the yukawa coupling ratios compared to the case without threshold effects included . for the considered mgmsb parameter range ( see section [ sec : susybreaking ] ) we can see from the left plot that , with quark mass errors included , @xmath102 in the range from 3.62 to 7.69 and @xmath103 in the range from 0.30 to 0.87 are possible .",

    "dark matter constraints are not discussed since the gravitino is generically the lsp in gmsb and the gravitino mass essentially represents a free parameter in our setup .      in the cmssm , as in mgmsb , with positive @xmath107 and @xmath97 the susy threshold corrections tend to reduce the down - type yukawa couplings and consequently enlarge the yukawa coupling ratios at the gut scale .",

    "the first and second row of figure [ fig : plots_cmssm ] show as examples the impact of the constraints from @xmath74 and ewpo .",
    "the main consequence regarding the allowed gut scale ratios is that points are excluded where the susy threshold corrections tend to reduce the gut scale ratios .",
    "this is in agreement with @xcite , where it has been argued that third family yukawa coupling unification within the inverted scalar mass hierarchy scenario @xcite requires a region of parameter space where @xmath111 and @xmath112 and that this inevitably leads to conflicts with bounds on , e.g. , @xmath110 because of the large trilinear coupling .",
    "we note that we have not focused on this specific correlation between the parameters which explains why we have only relatively few ( excluded ) parameter points which are close to third family yukawa unification .",
    "the third row of figure [ fig : plots_cmssm ] shows the constraints which would come from the requirement that the neutralino relic density does not exceed the observed dark matter density , under the assumptions that the neutralino is the stable lsp and that the cosmic history is `` standard '' .",
    "we find from our scan that the impact of this constraint would be that a certain region with large @xmath14 would be favoured .",
    "however , we would like to note that there are comparatively thin parameter space regions which lead to a viable neutralino relic density , i.e.  the so - called funnel and coannihilation regions .",
    "since our parameter space is comparatively coarse , we can not exclude that we have missed viable parameter points in these thin regions .",

    "the red dots correspond to parameter points which are excluded by phenomenological constraints , while the black dots are allowed with grey regions indicating the experimental ( 1@xmath92 ) errors on the quark masses .",
    "the possible theory predictions discussed in section 2 are shown in figure [ fig : finalresults ] as green and blue lines and dots .",
    "we note that for mass ratios only the modulus of the ratio is relevant , since a sign only corresponds to a global phase redefinition . we will therefore in the following always display the modulus of the predicted ratios .",
    "the different colours have the following meaning : green lines denote the predictions from @xmath16 guts ( eventually embedded in @xmath15 ) and dashed green and blue lines the predictions which can arise in ps unification ( eventually embedded in @xmath15 guts ) as well as in guts based on @xmath16 . for the third family",
    "the dark blue points denote the predictions from operators up to dimension five in ps unification , whereas the light blue points denote predictions which can arise from certain dimension - six operators .      from figure",
    "[ fig : finalresults ] we see that mamsb is the only considered scenario where the gj relation @xmath10 is allowed .",
    "its realisation requires intermediate @xmath14 ( around 30 ) and a comparatively heavy sparticle spectrum corresponding to @xmath109 above about 1 tev and @xmath113 above about 100 tev .",
    "interestingly , this parameter region would also be compatible ( with quark mass errors included ) with the second gj relation @xmath114 , which arises in the presence of a texture zero in the ( 1,1)-elements of the yukawa matrices and under the assumption that they are symmetric .",
    "in addition to the gj relation , mamsb is also compatible with the ratio @xmath6 .",
    "this ratio arises in all scenarios whenever the susy threshold corrections are comparatively small , for instance if @xmath14 is small such that there is no @xmath14 enhancement . in figure",
    "[ fig : finalresults ] the yellow squad shows the gut scale ratios which would result when the susy threshold corrections were ignored . in the absence of susy threshold corrections",
    "a value close to @xmath6 would result as well .",
    "regarding the third generation we find that third family yukawa unification @xmath115 is not compatible with mamsb .",
    "the parameter points which came close to this relation were all excluded because either the spectrum contained tachyons and/or because it was not possible to achieve successful electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "partial third family yukawa unification @xmath116 turned out to be possible .",
    "interestingly , @xmath116 is realised in combination with @xmath117",
    ". both relations can emerge simultaneously from a dimension - six operator within ps unified theories .",
    "the gut predictions @xmath118 and @xmath10 can be realised for the same region of parameter space where @xmath14 is intermediate and the sparticle spectrum is rather heavy .",
    "we would like to note that including the dark matter constraint would exclude this parameter space region ( see third row in figure 3 ) .",
    "however , for example , in variants of mamsb where a small amount of r - parity violation is introduced or in `` nonstandard '' cosmology , this constraint might be avoided .",
    "the allowed gut scale ranges within mgmsb and cmssm differ significantly from the ranges in mamsb .",
    "this is due to the fact that the sign of the generically dominant @xmath14-enhanced susy qcd threshold correction is governed by @xmath119 which is positive in mgmsb and cmssm but negative in mamsb .",
    "it has turned out that mgmsb and cmssm are in fact compatible with the same theory predictions .",
    "we will therefore discuss both scenarios together in this subsection .    for mgmsb and cmssm the gj relation @xmath10 is disfavoured . for small @xmath14 , i.e.  small threshold corrections ,",
    "both scenarios ( and also mamsb ) are compatible with @xmath6 .",
    "in addition , for large @xmath14 ( i.e.  large susy threshold corrections ) , the theory prediction @xmath120 can be compatible with phenomenological constraints . the gut scale ratios",
    "@xmath6 as well as @xmath120 can be realised in @xmath16 guts , however , within our setup , not from the ps gauge group .    regarding the third generation",
    "we again find that third family yukawa unification @xmath115 is incompatible .",
    "however , interesting alternative relations are compatible with data : one example is the gut scale prediction @xmath8 which arises in the context of @xmath16 guts .",
    "it can be realised for moderate values of @xmath14 ( e.g.  @xmath121 in cmssm ) while it would be disfavoured for large values of @xmath14 .",
    "we would like to remark that this region of parameter space is also consistent with the gut prediction @xmath6 . for large @xmath14 ( i.e.  large susy threshold corrections ) ,",
    "on the other hand , the relations @xmath122 and @xmath123 are allowed .",
    "interestingly , the relation @xmath124 can also emerge as a prediction from dimension - six operators within ps unified theories .",
    "the parameter space where @xmath125 is realised additionally allows to realise the gut relation @xmath120 .",
    "however , while @xmath120 appears in @xmath16 the relation @xmath125 can emerge from ps . in our scan",
    "we found no parameter point in mgmsb and cmssm where partial third family yukawa unification @xmath116 was compatible with experimental constraints .",
    "the viability of third family yukawa unification @xmath115 ( and also on the less restrictive possibility @xmath126 ) has been extensively studied in the literature ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the recent study @xcite has reconsidered the phenomenological viability of this relation and it has been pointed out that in a variant of the cmssm with nonuniversal soft higgs mass parameters ( nuhm ) the relation @xmath115 is quite challenged by the experimental data from b physics .",
    "susy threshold effects on the gj relations have been discussed recently in @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the impact of the @xmath14-enhanced susy threshold corrections for all three generations and for down - type quarks as well as for charged leptons has been analysed numerically and analytically . for this purpose",
    "the threshold corrections have been treated in the ew - unbroken phase .",
    "the possible ranges for the gut scale values of the yukawa couplings and their ratios have been calculated for three example ranges of low energy susy parameters and it has been pointed out that the presence of susy threshold corrections can open up new possibilities for gut model building .",
    "compared to @xcite our results are in good qualitative agreement ( c.f .",
    "figure 5 of @xcite where the results are presented in a similar way ) .",
    "the example susy parameter range @xmath127 in @xcite was inspired by anomaly mediated susy breaking and the susy parameter ranges @xmath128 ( and @xmath129 ) by scenarios with gaugino unification and @xmath130 ( @xmath131 ) .",
    "quantitatively there are nevertheless differences , which are larger for the third family .",
    "for example for @xmath65 in the mamsb case we find that ( before applying experimental constraints ) @xmath102 can be in the range 2.41 - 5.73 , whereas in @xcite in case @xmath127 we found the very similar range 2.40 - 5.63 .",
    "on the other hand , for the ratio @xmath2 we find an allowed range of 0.94 - 1.28 within mamsb compared to 0.60 - 1.39 for the example susy parameter range @xmath127 .",
    "however , since in the present study we are considering explicit susy breaking scenarios at high energy resulting in different low energy susy spectra , there is no reason to expect perfect quantitative agreement .",
    "the main difference from @xcite is of course that the consideration of explicit susy breaking scenarios allows to take phenomenological constraints into account .",
    "their restrictions on the allowed gut scale ratios depend somewhat on the explicit minimal susy breaking scenario , however we expect that some consequences are also characteristic for variants of the considered schemes . for example , it has turned out that there is a certain tension between realising gut predictions which require large susy threshold corrections and the experimental constraints which basically restrict the effects of susy loops to the observables .",
    "it has also turned out that , contrary to claims in @xcite , it may be challenging to realise third family yukawa unification in amsb - like susy breaking scenarios .",
    "finally , we go beyond @xcite by investigating explicitly which alternative gut scale predictions for quark and lepton mass ratios can emerge in unified theories and by comparing them to the phenomenologically allowed gut scale ratios .        as mentioned in section 2",
    ", the relation between the mass of first generation of fermions and the yukawa couplings is often more complicated .",
    "we have therefore focused on the second and third generation so far .",
    "as discussed in section 2 , predictions for the ratios between quark and charged lepton masses at the gut scale can arise if two conditions are satisfied : a hierarchical structure of the yukawa matrices and the situation that one single gut operator dominates the relevant yukawa matrix element .",
    "the simplest case which can lead to predictions for the first generation of fermions is that the submatrix for the first and the second fermion generation is also hierarchical .",
    "then the masses of the first fermion generation would be approximately determined by the diagonal elements ( i.e.  the ( 1,1)-elements ) of the corresponding yukawa matrices and the phenomenologically allowed range for @xmath0 can directly be compared to the theory predictions in tables 2 and 4 of section 2 .",
    "the theory prediction @xmath132 , possible in @xmath16 , or the relation @xmath133 from ps unification would be compatible with the experimental constraints .    in many gut models of fermion masses and mixings , however , a different situation is realised : there , the yukawa matrices are symmetric and have a zero in the ( 1,1)-entries ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . in this case , the mass of the electron and down - type quark are inversely proportional to the masses of the second generation and , in addition , depend on the ( 1,2)-entries ( which are equal to the ( 2,1)-entries by assumption ) of the yukawa matrices .",
    "more precisely , the prediction for the ratio @xmath0 is then given by @xmath134 for @xmath135 and @xmath10 we recover the second gj relation @xmath21 which is consistent with our results when quark mass errors are included .",
    "interestingly , it is possible to realise both relations within mamsb . with @xmath135 ,",
    "no alternative gut prediction for @xmath1 is consistent with the above assumptions , due to the strong correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath1 in figure [ fig : finalresults ] .",
    "however , with a different clebsch factor relating @xmath136 to @xmath137 , the alternative gut predictions @xmath6 and @xmath120 can well be consistent with the assumption of symmetric yukawa matrices with zero ( 1,1)-elements : the relation @xmath6 is consistent with @xmath132 , which would require @xmath138 .",
    "similarly , @xmath120 is consistent with @xmath139 , which would require @xmath140 .",
    "of course , when one of the above assumptions ( i.e.  symmetric yukawa matrices and zero ( 1,1)-elements ) is dropped then there are more possibilities . for example , without zero ( 1,1)-element the relation @xmath141 can well be compatible with @xmath6 or @xmath120 .      in many gut models of fermion masses and mixings , characteristic predictions can arise for the neutrino mixing angles which are , however , perturbed by the mixing coming from the charged lepton sector ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "one typical example is the leptonic mixing angle @xmath142 . in many models",
    "the 1 - 3 mixing from the neutrino sector is very small or even zero ( @xmath143 ) .",
    "nevertheless a total lepton mixing @xmath142 can be induced from the possible corrections caused by mixing in the charged lepton mass matrix and is then given by @xmath144 where @xmath145 is the charged lepton 1 - 2 mixing angle given ( for a hierarchical mass matrix ) by @xmath146 .",
    "assuming for instance @xmath147 and @xmath148 we obtain @xmath149 where @xmath150 is the 1 - 2 mixing of the down - type quark mass matrix @xmath151 .",
    "interestingly , in many gut models @xmath150 is approximately equal to the cabibbo angle @xmath152 , which under the above assumptions would yield @xmath153 .",
    "this value emerges in many models as prediction for the neutrino mixing @xmath142 , closely related to the gj relation @xmath10 .    in this context",
    "we would like to remark that the alternative gut predictions @xmath6 and @xmath120 can lead to new predictions for the leptonic mixing angle @xmath142 , following the above chain of arguments .",
    "in particular , when @xmath6 is realised in a unified model it could predict @xmath154 analogously , @xmath120 could lead to the prediction @xmath155 for the still unmeasured leptonic mixing angle .",
    "additional predictions are possible when the assumption @xmath147 is replaced by a different group theoretical clebsch factor .",
    "gut predictions for the ratios of quark and lepton masses can arise after gut symmetry breaking from group theoretical clebsch factors and are characteristic properties of unified flavour models . to compare the gut scale predictions with experimental data , it is crucial to carefully include susy threshold corrections .",
    "their effects depend on the low energy susy parameters and are particularly relevant for large @xmath14 .",
    "our study consists of two parts :    in the first part ( section 2 ) we have derived possible alternative gut predictions for the ratios @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 at the unification scale ( see tables [ tab : su5messenger ] - [ tab : psrelations ] ) .",
    "we have assumed a unified gauge group @xmath15 which is broken to the mssm at the gut scale via the @xmath16 or pati - salam ( ps ) breaking chain . in the second part ( section 3 ) , we have analysed which gut scale ratios are allowed when phenomenological constraints from electroweak precision observable , @xmath4 physics , @xmath5 , mass limits on sparticles from direct searches as well as , optionally , dark matter constraints are taken into account . for explicitness , we have considered the three common minimal susy breaking scenarios mamsb , mgmsb and cmssm , which provide boundary conditions for the soft susy breaking parameters at high energies .    from comparing the gut scale predictions with the phenomenologically allowed ranges within mamsb , mgmsb and cmssm ( see figure [ fig : finalresults ] ) , we have obtained the following main results ( c.f .",
    "section 4 ) :    * the georgi - jarlskog ( gj ) relation of @xmath10 at @xmath108 is incompatible with mgmsb and cmssm , however it can be realised in mamsb for intermediate @xmath14 ( @xmath156 ) and relatively heavy sparticle spectrum . while the possibility of @xmath10 in amsb - like susy breaking scenarios has been suggested already in @xcite , our results show that the realisation of @xmath10 can be consistent with phenomenological constraints .",
    "* regarding alternative predictions for @xmath1 , we find that in mgmsb and cmssm , @xmath6 or @xmath120 are possible , where the former corresponds to small threshold effects and small or moderate @xmath14 whereas the latter corresponds to large threshold corrections and large @xmath14 . in mamsb with small or moderate @xmath14 ,",
    "@xmath6 is also consistent .",
    "both predictions , @xmath6 and @xmath120 , can be realised in unified theories based on @xmath16 ( or on @xmath15 with breaking chain via @xmath16 ) .",
    "smaller predictions such as @xmath157 proposed in @xcite are phenomenologically disfavoured in all three scenarios . * in the considered scenarios we found no example where third family yukawa unification @xmath115 was realised . interestingly ,",
    "even in mamsb we did not find any consistent parameter point , in contrast to the claims in @xcite , due to inconsistencies with tachyons , ewpo and b - physics observables .",
    "however , we would like to remark that mamsb is only a minimal scenario and @xmath115 may in principle be allowed in different models with anomaly mediation . on the other hand",
    ", our results suggest that it might be difficult to realise such large threshold effects in a phenomenological consistent way . in the cmssm ( as well as in mgmsb ) with @xmath119 positive , the threshold corrections generically enlarge @xmath104 such that third family yukawa unification is not allowed .",
    "however under certain conditions in cmssm , in particular with large negative trilinear coupling @xmath158 , one can in principle find tuned regions with @xmath115 , which are however excluded by the experimental constraints as argued in @xcite . in figure",
    "[ fig : finalresults ] there are only a few excluded points close to @xmath115 , which is due to the fact that we have not tuned any parameters for our scan .",
    "* there are alternative relations between the third generation yukawa couplings @xmath159 , @xmath160 and @xmath161 which seem to be favoured compared to third family yukawa unification : for instance , dimension - six operators in ps can lead to the relation @xmath118 which is allowed in mamsb ( with intermediate @xmath14 and comparatively heavy susy spectrum ) or to @xmath125 which is allowed in mgmsb and cmssm ( with large @xmath14 ) . in mgmsb and",
    "cmssm the relation @xmath8 can be realised for moderate values of @xmath14 . *",
    "it is also interesting to remark that in mamsb , the gut predictions @xmath118 and @xmath10 can be valid for the same region of parameter space . in mgmsb and cmssm , @xmath8 and @xmath6",
    "can be realised simultaneously as well as @xmath125 and @xmath120 . *",
    "furthermore , bounds from thermal overproduction of dark matter may be considered as constraints on the susy parameters under the additional assumptions of a stable lightest neutralino and of a `` standard '' cosmological history . these constraints ( which are not included in our results shown in figure [ fig : finalresults ] ) would exclude a large range of possible gut scale values , in particular in mamsb where only @xmath6 would remain as a viable gut prediction . in the cmssm ,",
    "the dark matter bounds are less restrictive ( c.f .",
    "discussion in section 3.4.3 ) and the relations @xmath8 , @xmath122 , @xmath6 and @xmath120 remain allowed .    in summary , we have derived possible new predictions for the gut scale mass ( or yukawa coupling ) ratios @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 and confronted them with phenomenological constraints . the soft susy breaking scenarios mamsb , mgmsb and cmssm have been taken as explicit examples , however our results may hold true approximately in variants of these schemes .",
    "the allowed gut scale ranges for @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 have been calculated and compared to the theory predictions .",
    "we found that new gut scale predictions such as @xmath6 or @xmath7 and @xmath8 or @xmath9 are often favoured compared to the ubiquitous @xmath10 or @xmath11 .",
    "in general , gut predictions for quark and lepton mass ratios point to characteristic susy spectra and breaking mechanisms which can be tested at the cern lhc and future colliders .",
