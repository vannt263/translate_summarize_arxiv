    "soft x - ray transients ( sxts ) , also known as x - ray novae , ( tanaka & shibazaki 1996 ) are low - mass x - ray binaries in which long periods of quiescence , typically decades , are punctuated by very dramatic x - ray and optical outbursts , often accompanied by radio activity . in a prototypical outburst , the luminosity approaches the eddington limit and x - ray emission is dominated by thermal emission from the hot inner accretion disk .",
    "optical emission is then thought to be produced by reprocessing of x - rays .",
    "there are exceptions , however , and some outbursts never show disk x - ray emission ( e.g. , groj0422 + 32 ; see nowak 1995 for summary and discussion ) .    xtej1118 + 480  was discovered by",

    "analysis of earlier data revealed an outburst in 2000 january reaching a similar brightness .",
    "a power - law spectrum was seen to at least 120kev ( wilson & mccollough 2000 ) , with spectral index similar to cyg x-1 in the low hard state .",
    "a 13th magnitude optical counterpart was promptly identified , coincident with an object with red magnitude 18.8 in sky survey images ( uemura , kato , & yamaoka 2000 ; uemura et al .",
    "the optical spectrum was typical of x - ray novae in outburst ( garcia et al .",
    "2000 ) . continued observations revealed a weak photometric modulation on a 4.1hr period ( cook et al .",
    "the optical brightness is surprising , as the x - rays are so faint .",
    "it was suggested that the system might be at very high inclination , so that the x - ray source was obscured by the disk rim and only scattered x - rays are visible ( garcia et al .",
    "a radio counterpart was also discovered with flux 6.2mjy ( pooley & waldram 2000 ) .",
    "xtej1118 + 480  has a very high galactic latitude ( @xmath0 ) and is close to the lockman hole ( lockman , jahoda , & mccammon 1986 ) .",
    "consequently it has a very low interstellar absorption of @xmath1 ( garcia et al .",
    "this , together with its brightness , make xtej1118 + 480  an ideal target for multiwavelength coverage .",
    "the observations described here were performed as part of a coordinated multi - wavelength campaign .",
    "a highlight of the campaign is that the low interstellar absorption allowed the first _",
    "spectroscopy of an x - ray transient .",
    "this campaign is still underway , so we report here only our earliest observations of 2000 april 418 .",
    "_ extreme ultraviolet explorer _ ( _ euve _ ) observations of xtej1118 + 480  took place during 2000 april 8.108.71 , 13.3213.93 , and 16.9119.60 ut . for a description of the _ euve _ satellite and instrumentation , refer to bowyer & malina ( 1991 ) , abbott et al.(1996 ) , and sirk et al .",
    "the deep survey ( ds ) photometer achieved net exposures of 0.93 , 0.90 , and 6.92ks , limited by shutdowns due to high background levels .",
    "the short wavelength ( sw ) spectrometer was not affected by such shutdowns and achieved net exposures of 19.4 , 19.8 , and 81.1ks .",
    "the bandpasses of the ds photometer and sw spectrometer are defined by a lexan / boron filter and extend from @xmath2180  although interstellar absorption extinguishes the flux longward of about 120 .",
    "the 2nd and 3rd observations were offset - pointed to recover more of the short - wavelength flux .",
    "the mean background - subtracted ds count rates for the three visits do not vary by much : 1.61 , 1.51 , and 1.62cntss@xmath3 .",
    "individual light curves show statistically significant variability about the mean ( e.g. , fig .  1 ; @xmath4 ) .",
    "to determine if this variability is correlated with orbital phase , we folded the data from the april 18 observation on the optical photometric period of 0.17082d ( patterson 2000 ) , with @xmath5 ( hjd ) corresponding to optical maximum ( j. patterson , private communication ) .",
    "the resultant light curve is shown in the inset of fig .  1 .",
    "there is no evidence for a modulation in the euv flux of greater than 6%  full amplitude on this period .",

    "[ euvelcfig ]    figure 2 shows the background - subtracted mean _ euve _ sw spectrum from the april 18 observation binned to @xmath8 , matching the spectral resolution of the instrument , and removing the nonstatistical correlation between neighboring wavelength bins .",
    "the short - wavelength limit of the spectrum is dictated by the strong increase in the background shortward of @xmath9   , while interstellar photoelectric absorption suppresses the flux longward of @xmath10   . to approximately constrain the absorbing column density and flux , we fit these data with constant @xmath11 and photoelectric absorption . for the latter",

    "the resulting fit parameters and 90% confidence errors are @xmath12 and @xmath13 , with @xmath14 .",
    "the fit is poor because the data systematically fall below this simple model shortward of @xmath15 , either because of a flattening of the continuum spectrum , or an absorption feature or edge .",
    "there may also be a broad emission feature at @xmath16 .",
    "we can not usefully constrain the slope of the euv spectrum but assuming a wide range of intrinsic euv spectra , @xmath17 , where @xmath18 , gives a range of column densities of ( 0.351.15)@xmath19@xmath20 respectively .",
    "these values are relatively low , and are fully consistent with the expected column density of the interstellar medium in the vicinity of the lockman hole , ( 0.51.5)@xmath19@xmath20 ( b. y. welsh , private communication )",
    ". there does not therefore appear to be any strong absorption intrinsic to the source , although estimates from fits to the _ euve _ spectrum are sensitive to the assumed ionization state of the absorber .",

    "the fit is constant @xmath11 subject to photoelectric absorption .",
    "[ euvespecfig ] the low intrinsic absorption implied by the euv spectrum together with the lack of orbital modulation is evidence against a high inclination explanation for the low x - ray to optical flux ratio ( garcia et al.2000 ) . in that case , because of the extreme sensitivity of the euv flux to absorbing material , we would expect some modulation due to asymmetry in the disk rim and significant intrinsic absorption by material above the disk .",
    "it instead appears likely that the central disk regions are unobscured , and that the system is in an intrinsically x - ray faint state .",
    "this is also consistent with the lack of optical eclipses .",
    "this argument does , however , assume that euv emission originates from the disk .",
    "if it actually comes from a wind , as in the cataclysmic variable oy car ( mauche & raymond 2000 ) , for example , then the system could still be at high inclination .",

    "the latter likely indicates that some optically thick disk emission is present .",
    "the underlying flat continuum , however , does not resemble a disk spectrum , as is discussed in section 5 .",
    "we observed xtej1118 + 480  with the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) _ proportional counter array ( pca ) and high - energy timing experiment ( hexte ) at several epochs selected to coincide with the _ hst _ visits .",
    "this included 2000 april 8.558.58 when a total exposure of about 4ks was obtained .",
    "subsequent discussion refers to that observation .    for the pca",
    ", we used the `` standard mode '' data ( 128 spectral channels , 16s accumulations ) , selecting sub - intervals when the number of detectors on remained constant ( about 75% of the total ) . the current pca background model and/or the instrument responses are unreliable above about 25kev , so we did not use those channels for our model fitting .",
    "there was sufficient pca ",
    "hexte overlap so that this was not a serious limitation .",
    "the lowest several energy channels are also known to be problematic so were discarded .",
    "the total flux on the 210kev band was about @xmath36ergs@xmath20s@xmath3 , i.e.  about 40mcrab .",
    "for hexte , the exposure time was rather marginal for detailed spectral modeling given the source intensity relative to the background , but the source seems to be solidly detected to @xmath37kev , and perhaps above 100kev .",
    "the data sets were then simultaneously deconvolved to derive a best estimate of the incident photon flux . given the known cross - calibration discrepancies between the two instruments , we allowed the two normalization terms to vary independently .",
    "the spectrum is hard , with a photon power - law index of about @xmath38 . a thermal comptonization model ( sunyaev & titarchuk 1980 ) with @xmath39 and @xmath40kev , also provided an acceptable fit . in both cases",
    ", there was a distinct positive residual corresponding to the 6.4kev fe k resonance , thus a gaussian line profile was included to refine our overall fit .",
    "given the low hydrogen column density , and our lack of low - energy coverage , the effect of interstellar absorption on the x - ray spectrum is negligible .",
    "there was no evidence ( in terms of statistical improvement to our fits ) for a soft - excess component .",
    "figure 3 shows the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) inferred from radio to hard x - ray data .",
    "radio data obtained with the vla and ryle telescope between 2000 april 2.743.13 were reported by dhawan et al.(2000 ) . between",

    "the low energy cut - off is fixed by an outer temperature of 8000k , chosen to be consistent with the hot phase of the disk instability model .",
    "the high energy cut - off then depends on the inner radius : @xmath51r@xmath52 and @xmath53r@xmath52 for models a and b respectively ( these assume an orbital period of 4.1hr and a 7m@xmath54 black hole as the accretor ) .",
    "model a is representative of a high state sed , with the disk extending to the last stable orbit .",
    "this is clearly ruled out by the euv and x - ray data as a direct consequence of the low x - ray to optical flux ratio . the uncertainty in the system parameters , including the possibility that the central object is a neutron star",
    ", can not resolve this .",
    "model b is more like the low hard state scenario proposed by esin et al .",
    "( 1997 ) in which the center of the disk ( out to 10@xmath5510@xmath56r@xmath52 ) is evaporated into an advective flow .",
    "such a model is consistent with the low x - ray to optical flux ratio and reproduces the uv slope fairly well .",
    "the euv to hard x - ray range can be approximately fitted by a single power - law , @xmath57 , typical of the low hard state , and so would not be disk emission .",
    "this spectral region does resemble the low hard state seds presented by esin et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , as does the x - ray to optical flux ratio .",
    "alternative explanations of this low flux ratio include material leaving the system in an outflow ( e.g. , blandford & begelman 1997 ) , or accumulating at larger radii in a non - steady state disk ; either option will reduce the central accretion rate as required .",
    "disk models provide a very poor fit in the ir , as a disk spectrum should steepen to a rayleigh - jeans tail well before the @xmath58 band is reached ( unless the edge of the disk is at @xmath59k ) .",
    "it thus appears that another source of near - ir flux is present .",
    "this may be related to the radio emission , as this lies close to an extrapolation of the ir ",
    "uv power - law .",
    "the very flat ir  uv part of the sed ( @xmath60 )",
    "could then very naturally be interpreted as a mixture of an optically thick disk spectrum and flat - spectrum emission , possibly synchrotron , such as is seen at radio ",
    "mm wavelengths in cyg x-1 and other black hole candidates ( fender et al .",
    "the radio emission has a steeper , inverted spectrum ( @xmath61 ) , likely optically thick synchrotron emission .",
    "consideration of the spectral energy distribution suggests that during the period 2000 april 418 the source was in the low hard state .",
    "power density spectra at x - ray , uv , and optical wavelengths support this , showing band - limited noise and qpos typical of this state ( revnivtsev , sunyaev , & borozdin 2000 ; haswell et al .",
    "this in itself is not particularly striking : groj0422 + 32 , for example , spent its entire 19921993 main outburst in the low hard state .",
    "what is striking is the low x - ray to optical flux ratio : it is an unusually low state .",
    "this is not typical of a major sxt outburst .",
    "there are , however , similarities in this behavior to _ mini - outbursts _ in groj0422 + 32 ( castro - tirado , ortiz , & gallego 1997 ; shrader et al.1997 ) . like the outbursts of xtej1118 + 480 ,",
    "these outbursts were characterized by a very low x - ray to optical flux ratio and low hard state behavior .",
    "the optical outbursts have comparable length and brightness ; in groj0422 + 32 the mini - outburst duration is @xmath62d with @xmath63d recurrence time . in xtej1118 + 480",
    "the first outburst lasted @xmath64d , with the second outburst beginning @xmath62d after the start of the first . in both cases , the peak optical brightness is @xmath65mag above quiescence , with the interoutburst brightness about 3.5mag above quiescence in xtej1118 + 480  ( uemura et al.2000 ) and 13mag above quiescence in groj0422 + 32 .",
    "it thus appears likely that the outburst of xtej1118 + 480  is of the same kind as the mini - outbursts in groj0422 + 32 , suggesting that this phenomenon is not just an aftereffect of a main outburst , but can occur in isolation .",
    "the nature of the compact object remains uncertain .",
    "the spectral energy distribution is equivocal , as both black hole and neutron star systems can show extended power - laws in the low hard state , with similar photon indices ( barret et al .",
    "2000 and references therein ) .",
    "a distinguishing neutron star feature may be a very soft excess , @xmath66kev , associated with the heated neutron star surface or boundary layer , however , our data clearly can not address this .",
    "we note that revnivtsev et al .",
