    "one of the most challeging problems in the physics of graphene@xcite is related to the spin relaxation time of electrons or holes.@xcite this is really the key point for possible spintronic applications@xcite of this material.@xcite it was suggested before that the spin relaxation in graphene can be extremely weak due to very small intrinsic spin - orbit interaction.@xcite the latter was extensively discussed in the past@xcite and , finally , quite persuasively confirmed by numerous investigations.@xcite    however , it is quite obvious that the spin relaxation rate can be essentially enhanced for graphene at a certain type of substrate generating strong rashba spin - orbit coupling , or in graphene with some heavy adatoms@xcite and magnetic impurities@xcite or for graphene with short - wavelength surface ripples.@xcite    an additional mechanism of the spin relaxation can occur due to electron spin - flip scattering from the magnetized graphene edge .",
    "such an effect of the magnetization of zigzag edges has been predicted by all first - principle as well as hubbard - model calculations ( for review , see refs .  ) , although experimental situation remains still not clear .",
    "since the ordering of effectively one - dimensional system of magnetic moments at the edge is necessarily broken by fluctuations,@xcite the magnetized zigzag edge could be powerful source of the spin relaxation .",
    "however , as we demonstrate in this paper , this is not always the case because the scattering probability of electrons at the zigzag edge is vanishingly small for gliding electrons .",
    "moreover , as we also show in this paper , in ballistic nanoribbons with magnetized zigzag edges , an anomalous diffusion of the spin density is possible , mostly due to electrons gliding along the ribbon edge.@xcite    our work is also motivated by the experiment,@xcite in which the enhanced spin relaxation time in hydrogenated graphene spin - valve devices has been found about 2  ns , so that the spin relaxation length was 7  @xmath0 m .",
    "we consider the graphene ribbon of width @xmath1 along the axis @xmath2 , so that the graphene edges are at @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "we assume that the nanoribbon width @xmath1 is not so small to take into consideration the size quantization , i.e. , the wavelength of electrons at the fermi level @xmath5 is much smaller than @xmath1 .",
    "it enables using the semiclassical botzmann equation to describe the charge or spin transport . at the same time",
    ", we assume that @xmath1 can be of the order or smaller than the electron mean free path @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , in the following we consider in detail two main regimes : dirty nanoribbon when @xmath7 , and ballistic nanoribbon with @xmath8 .",
    "let us consider first the case of a dirty nanoribbon .",

    "( 1 ) we denoted by @xmath17 the opposite to @xmath18 state , and @xmath19 is the characteristic size of the transition region near the edge,@xcite where the edge scatterers are located . in the following we take @xmath19 equal to the lattice constant of graphene .    .",
    "scattering of electrons from the edges at @xmath3 and @xmath4 is associated with spin - flip transitions . ]",
    "we do not include intervalley scattering to kinetic equation ( 1 ) assuming that the scatterers are not so short ranged .",
    "for the spin - flip edge scattering , it means that we assume that the correlation length of magnetic fluctuations @xmath20 is large with respect to the lattice constant of graphene , @xmath21 .    the kinetic equation of this form ( 1 ) with delta - functions in the right hand part can be used to describe the dirty ribbon , @xmath7 . in the opposite ballistic case of @xmath8",
    ", one should consider spin - flip scatterers as distributed within the ribbon ( see below ) .",
    "we can use eq .",
    "( 1 ) to describe the diffusion of spin density along the ribbon .",
    "hence , we consider time evolution of the spin distribution along the ribbon , defined as @xmath22 which includes averaging over orientation of the wavevector @xmath23 . here",
    "we denoted by @xmath24 the polar angle of the vector @xmath23 .    if we choose the initial state with a smooth distribution @xmath25 along @xmath2-axis , which does not depend on @xmath26 , then @xmath27 so , in the following we concentrate on the one - dimensional spin diffusion along the nanoribbon , which is consistent with the experimental setup in ref .  .",
    "for distances along the ribbon large with respect to @xmath6 we can use the diffusive approximation .",
    "thus , we substitute @xmath28 , where the first term does not depend on direction of vector @xmath23 , and find the diffusion equation for @xmath29 in the bulk @xmath30 and @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the one - dimensional diffusion coefficient , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 .    the general solution of eq .",

    "now we assume that the edges of the graphene nanoribbon are magnetized.@xcite it can be spontaneous magnetization as in the case of zigzag edge or due to magnetic impurities located at this edges .",
    "the boundary condition at @xmath3 is related to the spin - flip scattering from magnetic moments at the edge .",

    "note that , in fact , the functions @xmath29 do not depend on @xmath26 , as discussed before .",
    "as mentioned before , we assume that the main source of spin - flip scattering in the graphene nanoribbon is due to the magnetized graphene edge.@xcite recently , this problem has been very intensively studied by different methods , and therefore the possibility of edge magnetization is generally recognized by researchers .",
    "we consider the @xmath53-@xmath54 exchange coupling hamiltonian describing the coupling of electrons to the magnetic moments localized at the edge @xmath3 @xmath55 where @xmath56 is a short - range exchange potential related to the shape of electron wavefunction in a state localized at the edge .",
    "similar spin - flip scattering of electrons is at the other edge @xmath4 .",

    "( 20 ) we need to know the wavefunctions @xmath72 near the graphene edge .",
    "it is well known that the choice of these functions depends on the type of the edge , and can be described by using different boundary conditions for the wave functions .      strictly speaking , in the case of berry - mondragon ( bm ) boundary",
    "we probably should not expect any spontaneous magnetization of the graphene edge .",
    "most probably , this effect is associated only with the zigzag - shaped@xcite and chiral@xcite edges . nevertheless , in the absence of any firm confirmation of these mostly theoretical suggestions , we consider the effect of magnetization for different types of the boundaries .",
    "note that the magnetized boundary can be also achieved due to correlated magnetic atoms intentially inserted at the graphene edges .",

    "<S> we discuss the role of spin - flip scattering of electrons from the magnetized edges in graphene nanoribbons . </S>",
    "<S> the spin - flip scattering is associated with strong fluctuations of the magnetic moments at the edge . using the boltzmann equation approach , which is valid for not too narrow nanoribbons </S>",
    "<S> , we calculate the spin relaxation time in the case of berry - mondragon and zigzag graphene edges . </S>",
    "<S> we also consider the case of ballistic nanoribbons characterized by very long momentum relaxation time in the bulk , when the main source of momentum and spin relaxation is the spin - dependent scattering at the edges . </S>",
    "<S> we found that in the case of zigzag edges , an anomalous spin diffusion is possible , which is related to very weak spin - flip scattering of electrons gliding along the nanoribbon edge . </S>"
