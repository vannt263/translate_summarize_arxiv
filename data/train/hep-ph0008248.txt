    "therefore , their electric ( @xmath0 ) as well as magnetic dipole ( @xmath3 ) moments are expected to be proportional to their spins ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "so under discrete spacetime transformations , these moments and the spin must have the same transformation properties .",
    "despite their similarity concerning the particle spin , the electric and magnetic moments have quite different characteristics .",

    "consider now the lower part of the same figure where initial configuration is similar to that of the upper part ; @xmath13 .",
    "however , under a t operation @xmath14 and @xmath10 , and thus , the corresponding interaction term in the lagrangian violates the cp symmetry .",
    "therefore , unlike the magnetic moment discussed above , the electric dipole moment implies the violation of cp invariance in nature .",

    "indeed , the cp ",
    "odd long  living neutral kaon @xmath15 is known to disassociate into the cp  even final state consisting of two neutral pions @xmath16 @xcite .",

    "one notes that when @xmath26 is removed from this operator the corresponding quantity becomes the magnetic moment interaction which does not imply the discrete symmetries .",
    "the value of the form factor @xmath27 for on  shell photon ( @xmath28 ) is the sought expression for the edm of the fermion @xmath29 : @xmath30 of all the baryons the edm of the neutron @xmath31 has been of interest to the physicists for a long time . in 1950 , purcell and ramsey @xcite first considered the problem of existence of the neutron edm .",
    "however , at that time , it was assumed that the physical world is invariant under p inversion , and in order to have a nonzero @xmath31 , purcell and ramsey had to construct a rather unconventional p even edm of neutron .",
    "they gave the first limit on the edm of the neutron : @xmath32 in 1957 , landau @xcite observed that a non - vanishing edm of the neutron was a signal of p and t violation . about that time",
    "it was discovered that p invariance is not a strict law of nature @xcite as was experimentally confirmed @xcite .",
    "edm of neutron violates both parity and time reversal invariance . +",
    "even after the parity was found to be violated by the weak interactions it was believed that edm of the neutron was time ",
    "reversal invariant and by virtue of cpt theorem was also invariant under cp symmetry . in 1964 , when the cp violation was observed in kaon system @xcite , the subject of edm of neutron has become of particular importance for both theoretical and experimental interests .",
    "+ various methods have been invoked for the experimental investigation of the edms of elementary particles ( for details see , for example , @xcite ) .",

    "it would be the first observation of cp violation outside the kaon system .",
    "so , it could give us a new understanding of the cp violation mechanism and of the early universe cosmology where it is generally believed that cp violation gave rise to the observed baryon ",
    "antibaryon asymmetry of the universe @xcite .",
    "+ since the experimental discovery of cp noninvariance in nature , many diverse mechanisms of the cp violation have been proposed and several estimates of the edm of neutron have been obtained .",
    "a comprehensive review of the edm of neutron in various models of cp violation can be found in @xcite .",
    "+ in this dissertation we shall consider the cp violation and hence the neutron edm in the frame work of @xmath33 theory of electroweak and strong interactions , @xmath34 , * the standard model*. in the standard model there are two sources of cp violation namely : +   + 1 . the first source of cp violation in the standard model is related to the properties of strong interaction theory described by quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) . it has long been realized that , the nontrivial structure of vacuum in qcd and the existence of instantons @xcite in the non - abelian gauge theory make it necessary to add to the lagrangian the so  called @xmath35-term , which violates p and cp symmetries . this term for @xmath36",
    "gives an exceedingly large value for the neutron edm which can be made consistent with the experimental bounds @xcite if @xmath37 .",
    "several methods have been employed to evaluate the effect of cp violation on neutron edm .",
    "the first investigation on this subject was carried out by baluni @xcite .",
    "in chapter i we will discuss sources of cp violation in the strong interactions together with a calculation of the neutron edm .",
    "the second source of cp violation in the sm appears in the electroweak sector where the mixing matrix of quarks @xmath38 , appearing in the charged  current interactions , possess a complex phase which generates cp  violating observables . for three generations of the chiral fermions",
    "this matrix can be parametrized by three euler angles and a single phase , @xmath39 @xcite . for two generations ,",
    "for instance , there is no cp violation because the quark mixing matrix can always be made real .",
    "the analysis of the edm of the neutron in the electroweak sector is presented in chapter ii , where we have adopted the calculational techniques given by nanopoulous _ et al _ @xcite .",
    "in this chapter we will study first the sources of cp violation in strong interactions . for this purpose",
    "we will work out the nonperturbative and topological properties of the qcd vacuum together with its symmetries .",
    "progressively , we will construct the representation  independent cp violation lagrangian which is the mere source of cp  violating quantities in the hadron spectrum .",
    "finally we will compute the edm of neutron and compare the theoretical estimate with experimental bounds .      the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd )",
    "is the gauge theory of quarks and gluons , which are believed to be constituents of the hadrons .",
    "the total action density of the theory can be divided into two distinct parts , @xmath40 where @xmath41 describes the quarks ( color triplets : @xmath42 ) and gluons ( color octets : @xmath43 ) together with their interactions @xmath44}+i\\bigg{\\{}\\overline{\\psi}_l",

    "the second and third terms in ( [ l0lag ] ) refer to the chiral quarks @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the number of flavours , and each @xmath56 is a color triplet .",
    "the quark mass matrix @xmath57 , which is in general non ",
    "hermitian , is an @xmath58 matrix in the flavour space .    the second piece in ( [ lagran ] ) is given by @xmath59}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath60 is an angle parameter , and the dual field strength tensor is defined by @xmath61 .    for the coherence of the discussions it is convenient to specify the symmetries of the qcd lagrangian first",
    "the main difference between @xmath41 and @xmath62 is that the latter does not respect the time",
    " reversal ( t@xmath12cp ) invariance .",
    "this is clear from the fact that ( in the temporal gauge : @xmath63 ) the first term in @xmath41 corresponds to @xmath64 whereas @xmath62 does to @xmath65 , where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the non  abelian electric  like and magnetic  like fields .",
    "in fact , it is this cp  violating character of @xmath62 which makes it fundamental for calculating the edms , which are inherently cp  odd quantities .",
    "furthermore , since the gluons are flavour  diagonal , the massless quarks possess a @xmath68 global symmetry in the massless limit ; @xmath69 . in practice ,",
    "compared to the dynamical scale of qcd ( @xmath70 ) one can take @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 quarks approximately massless . to this approximation the global symmetry of ( [ lagran ] ) becomes @xmath74 .",
    "the diagonal group @xmath75 is also respected by the vacuum state since ( @xmath76 ) hadrons obey an approximate @xmath77 symmetry ( @xmath34 the @xmath78@xmath79 ) , and ( @xmath80 ) the baryon number is conserved .",
    "the remaining symmetries @xmath81 are not manifest in the hadron degeneracies so that the dynamics should be such that the qcd vacuum breaks all these axial symmetries . according to the goldstone theorem , from the break  down of @xmath82 we expect eight pseudo scalars which can indeed be identified with the set @xmath83 $ ] . however , there is no pseudoscalar meson in the spectrum to be identified with the goldstone boson of @xmath84 .",
    "hence , in the massless limit , there should be a remnant global symmetry of the qcd lagrangian given by the phase rotation @xmath85 . however , this symmetry is realized neither linearly ( by the vacuum invariance ) nor nonlinearly ( by the existence of a light pseudoscalar ) .    as will be detailed in the following sections , the resolution of the @xmath84 problem and the appearance of the cp  violating lagrangian @xmath62 are both related to the nontrivial vacuum structure of qcd .",
    "although there will be explicit quoting of the relevant work in the analyses below , still an exhaustive review of these problems can be found in @xcite together with @xcite .      for a clear understanding of the qcd vacuum it is convenient to discuss the topological properties of the continuous functions .",
    "to study the topological properties of the continuous functions one can divide them into @xmath86 @xmath87 ; each class contains the functions that can be deformed continuously into each other . as a warm  up case one",
    "can consider the @xmath88 mapping .",
    "let @xmath89 be the set of points @xmath90 on a unit circle @xmath91 , and let @xmath92 be the set of unimodular complex numbers @xmath93 .",
    "then the function @xmath94}$ ] realizes the mapping @xmath95 . for a fixed @xmath96 ,",
    "@xmath97 forms a homotopy class as @xmath98 varies .",
    "more precisely , given @xmath99 and @xmath100 with @xmath101 then these two functions can be deformed continuously into each other by the @xmath102 @xmath103}$ ] where @xmath104 .",
    "one can visualize @xmath97 as mapping @xmath96 points of one circle into one point of the other circle in other words one winds around the latter by @xmath96 times .",
    "every homotopy class is characterized by a @xmath105 @xmath106 @xmath107 in particular , mapping with @xmath108 is @xmath109 , and one can obtain the mapping for any winding number @xmath96 by using @xmath110 .",
    "though the @xmath111 mapping above is useful for illustrating the homotopy classes , a physically relevant case occurs only when the symmetry group under concern has an @xmath112 subgroup . here",
    "the question arises : `` how much it depends on the gauge group being @xmath112 ? ''",
    "the answer is : firstly , if the gauge group is @xmath113 , it is easy to see that every mapping of @xmath114 into @xmath113 is continuously deformable into the trivial mapping ( all the @xmath114 is mapped into a single point ) .",
    "thus _ for an abelian gauge theory there is no analog of winding number . _",
    "secondly , there is a theorem by raoul bott @xcite which states that any continuous mapping of @xmath114 into g can be continuously deformed into a mapping into @xmath112 subgroup of g , where g is a simple lie group .",
    "thus everything which will be discovered for @xmath112 will be true for an arbitrary simple lie group , in particular it will be true for @xmath115 . +",
    "as will be clear below , the @xmath112 group structure is needed to have a one  to ",
    "one correspondence with the spherical geometry at spatial infinity .",
    "therefore , we now discuss the @xmath116 mapping @xcite  a mapping from the three  dimensional euclidean space ( parametrized by three euler angles ) into the @xmath112 space ( characterized by three parameters ) .",
    "in fact , we now seek for solutions to the classical @xmath112 yang  mills theory in euclidean space ( @xmath117 ) with @xmath118 @xmath119 @xmath120}~,\\ ] ] that is , the field strength tensor must vanish at infinity , @xmath121 normally this condition is equivalent to vanishing of @xmath122 at infinity .",
    "however , a vanishing field configuration is equivalent to @xmath123 with @xmath124 thanks to the gauge transformation @xmath125 therefore , @xmath126 still vanishes at infinity ( [ fmunuvan ] ) for @xmath23 in the @xmath127 @xmath128 ; @xmath129 one notices that the points at infinity in the euclidean space are three ",
    "spheres , @xmath130 .",
    "therefore , the gauge transformation matrix @xmath124 realizes a mapping from @xmath131 to the @xmath132 .",
    "more precisely , the manifold of the @xmath112 group elements is topologically equivalent to the three ",
    ". this can be seen from the fact that @xmath124 can be expressed as @xmath133 due to unitary character of the gauge transformations , @xmath134 , it is clear that @xmath135 spans a sphere @xmath136 that is the group space of @xmath112 is topologically equivalent to the unit sphere , @xmath130 .",
    "following coleman @xcite , the previous expression ( [ wind ] ) for the winding number can now be written as @xmath137}=\\int d^{4}x\\ { \\cal{a}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 here are in the pure gauge discussed above , and the quantity @xmath138 is defined in ( [ theta ] ) .",
    "this is the expression for @xmath116 winding number corresponding to the @xmath112 gauge theory . from this very expression of the winding number ( [ wind3 ] )",
    "it can be shown that the action ( [ lelag ] ) is indeed finite , @xmath139 , and the corresponding gauge field is either self  dual or antiself  dual , @xmath34 , @xmath140 .",
    "the finite  action solutions of the classical euclidean yang  mills system ( [ lelag ] ) are @xmath141 solutions @xcite @xmath142 where @xmath98 is an arbitrary scale parameter , and the corresponding gauge transformation matrix has the form @xmath143 thus , the gauge field is of finite extension , and as @xmath144 it approaches the pure gauge form , as expected .",
    "for this very solution the action integral has the value @xmath145 , that is , this solution corresponds to the homotopy class @xmath108 hence the subscript `` 1 '' in @xmath146 .",
    "clearly the solution for the @xmath96th homotopy class can be obtained by compounding @xmath147 by @xmath96 times : @xmath148    suppose that there are two vacua belonging to different homotopy classes @xmath96 and @xmath149 .",

    "+ therefore the intanton configuration corresponds to tunneling between the vacuum states having different winding numbers .",
    "the rough estimate above , based on the finiteness of the eucleadean action , shows clearly that the effect here is inherently @xmath153 , that is , the transition rate is enhanced in the limit of large gauge coupling . besides this",
    ", the rate is enhanced for neighboring vacua ; @xmath154 . in the limit of small gauge coupling",
    ", the transition amplitude is diminished leaving system in any of the ( equivalent ) vacua with inherently @xmath155 dynamics .",
    "in summary we have infinite number of vacua each being characterized by its homotopy class or the winding number .",
    "another point of primary importance is the behavior of these vacua under gauge transformations .",
    "the gauge transformation that changes @xmath156 to @xmath157 works as @xmath158 so that the collection of the vacua @xmath159 is not gauge  invariant at all : @xmath160 thus , these infinitely many vacua are connected by topologically nontrivial gauge transformations .",
    "since the vacuum states @xmath161 belonging to different homotopy classes ( having different winding numbers ) are separated by the energy barriers ( as dictated by the tunneling amplitude in ( [ trans ] ) ) , it is clear that the @xmath162 vacuum state will be a linear superposition of all these vacua .",
    "similar to the situation with periodic potentials in quantum mechanics ( whose true ground state is the bloch wave ) , we define the true vacuum to be @xmath163 which we name as the `` @xmath164 '' .",
    "as expected , in contrast to @xmath159 the @xmath164 is gauge  invariant .",
    "this can be seen by computing @xmath165 therefore , @xmath35 labels the physically inequivalent sectors of the theory , and in each sector we can work physical processes in a gauge  invariant manner .",
    "the different @xmath35 worlds do not communicate with each other unlike @xmath159 which can be communicated via the quantum tunneling .",
    "obviously , @xmath35 is arbitrary , and thus , there is no @xmath166 @xmath167 way of determining it from the theory .",

    "it is clear that this effective action is equivalent to ( [ l0lag ] ) .    in concluding this section we note that the qcd vacuum has a nontrivial structure described by the gauge field configuration corresponding to `` pure gauge '' .",
    "the finite action solutions of the euclidean @xmath112 yang  mills system ( [ l0lag ] ) split into infinite number of equivalent subsets corresponding to the homotopy classes of @xmath173 mapping .",
    "the gauge field configurations are @xmath141 solutions in that they correspond to tunneling between the vacua with different winding numbers .",
    "therefore , the yang ",
    "mills system is characterized by infinite number of vacua communicated by quantum tunneling . moreover ,",
    "the vacua are not gauge invariant ; gauge transformation with winding number @xmath174 transforms the vacuum state @xmath161 to @xmath175 .",
    "the true ground state of the theory is given by a linear superposition of these vacua whereby defining the so ",
    "called @xmath35 vacuum .",
    "the @xmath35 vacuum is gauge  invariant , and each value of the parameter @xmath35 corresponds to a physically distinct state of the system .",

    "there is no communication among distinct @xmath35 vacua ; moreover , the corresponding transition amplitude is described by an effective action which differs from the original yang ",
    "mills action by @xmath62 in ( [ theta ] ) .",
    "the most interesting property of this additional piece is that it is odd under the cp transformation .",
    "therefore , the appearance of @xmath62 is due to the nontrivial nonperturbative topological structure of the qcd vacuum .",
    "as was mentioned when discussing the symmetries of the qcd lagrangian , there is an excess axial global symmetry ( @xmath84 ) of ( [ l0lag ] ) which has no imprint in the hadron spectrum .",
    "a resolution of the @xmath84 problem rests on the anomalous nature of this global symmetry and the nontrivial structure of the qcd vacuum discussed above .",
    "the conserved current , for massless @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 quarks , reads as @xmath176 at tree approximation this current is conserved because its divergence , which is proportional to the quark masses , vanishes identically in the massless limit .",
    "however , this current is no longer conserved if one goes to one loop level @xmath177 where @xmath178 for the present case .",
    "this result is independent of the looping quark masses .",
    "moreover , this result is exact , that is , it does get no contribution from higher loops ( the famous abj anomaly @xcite ) .",
    "it is this quantum mechanical nonconservation of @xmath179 which forbids an @xmath180 @xmath181 symmetry @xcite . in this sense",
    "the qcd lagrangian has no excess symmetry compared to the observed hadron spectrum , the partonic ( quarks and gluons ) and hadronic symmetry properties agree .",
    "though this observation solves the @xmath84 problem , there is more to be done with the qcd anomaly of @xmath179 .",
    "first , one observes that @xmath138 can , in fact , be written as a total divergence @xmath182}~,\\ ] ] with , however , the fact that @xmath183 is @xmath184 gauge invariant at all . despite this",
    ", one can embed the anomalous divergence in ( [ abj ] ) to define the a new current @xmath185 which is conserved in the massless quark limit .",
    "therefore , the anomalous character of @xmath179 ( that is the mismatch of the classical and quantum symmetries ) is now removed via ( [ new ] ) . however , under a gauge transformation its conserved charge @xmath186 can be shown to shift as follows @xmath187 } u_{1}^{-1}\\nonumber\\\\ & = & u_{1 } j_{5}^{0 } u_{1}^{-1 } - u_{1 } 2 n_{f}(\\frac{\\alpha_{s}}{4\\pi}k^{0 } ) u_{1}^{-1}\\nonumber\\\\ & = & j_{5}^{0}-2 n_{f}(\\frac{\\alpha_{s}}{4\\pi}k^{0})+2 n_{f}\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\widetilde q_{5}+2 n_{f}~ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where in arriving at the last line of the equation use has been made of ( [ new ] ) . this is a very important result as it implies that the @xmath35vacuum is not invariant under chiral transformations . to see this one computes @xmath188}&=&u_{1 } e^{i \\alpha \\widetilde q_{5 } } u_{1}^{-1 } u_{1 } |\\theta \\rangle\\nonumber\\\\ & = & e^{i(\\theta+2n_{f}\\alpha)}\\big{[}e^{i \\alpha \\widetilde q_{5}}|\\theta \\rangle \\big{]}~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which says that after a chiral rotation by an angle @xmath189 the @xmath35 parameter is shifted by @xmath190 .",
    "therefore , similar to the fact that the gauge transformations shift the winding numbers , or equivalently , cause transitions between vacua of different homotopy classes , the chiral transformations shift the @xmath35vacuum depending on the number of massless quark flavors .",
    "this very shift of the @xmath35 parameter under a chiral transformation has important implications concerning the quark sector of ( [ l0lag ] ) .",
    "it has long been known that cp is not a respected symmetry in the neutral @xmath191meson ( @xmath192 ) system since the mixings as well as the decays of these mesons apparently violate the cp symmetry @xcite .",
    "since the qcd vacuum angle @xmath35 does not contribute to @xmath192 cp , it is clear that there should be finite cp violation in the electroweak sector ( which will be throughly discussed in the next chapter ) , or simply , in the quark mass matrices in ( [ l0lag ] ) .",
    "the sensitivity of the @xmath35vacuum to the chiral transformations thus implies a hand  shaking of the vacuum angle @xmath35 and the phases of the quark mass matrix @xmath193 .    in general , the mass matrix of quarks is non  hermitian , so that part of ( [ l0lag ] ) containing the quark mass terms can be rewritten as @xmath194 where @xmath195 are flavour indices , and @xmath196 are elements of @xmath197 .",
    "however , by a chiral @xmath198 ( here @xmath178 ) transformation @xmath199 one can diagonalize @xmath193 with positive elements up to an overall phase factor .",
    "thus , without loss of generality the elements of @xmath193 can be assumed to have the form @xmath200 where it is clear that the common phase factor here can not be rotated away . using this form of @xmath197 in ( [ l0lag ] )",
    "one observes that after a further chiral rotation , similar to ( [ chiral ] ) , by the angle @xmath201 it is clear that the topological term @xmath62 disappears from the qcd lagrangian ( [ l0lag ] ) .",
    "this very chiral transformation acts on the quarks as @xmath202 .",
    "therefore , the expression for quark masses ( [ mass ] ) now goes over to @xmath203 where @xmath204 is the net phase of the quark mass matrix .",
    "one notices that now there is no @xmath35 term in the original qcd lagrangian ( [ l0lag ] ) ; however , the same phase is now moved to the quark mass lagrangian through the angle @xmath205 . in general the hand  shaking between the cp phases in the qcd vacuum ( @xmath35 ) and the phases in the quark mass matrices ( @xmath206 ) is expressed through the effective @xmath35 angle : @xmath207\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , obviously , @xmath208= n_{f}\\ \\rho$ ] .",
    "obviously it is the nature of ( [ tetbar ] ) which makes the cp violation by strong interactions nontrivial . indeed , if @xmath35 where stable under chiral transformations then there would not be any contribution to @xmath209 from the phases of the quark masses .",
    "in such an instance , setting @xmath35 to some value ( say , zero ) would be a natural operation because @xmath35 can not anyhow be determined from the theory itself .",
    "however , even if one chooses @xmath35 zero initially , this choice can not be kept unchanging due to the nonvanishing ( because of finite @xmath192 cp ) phases of the quark mass matrices .",
    "therefore , the cp violation in the qcd lagrangian ( [ l0lag ] ) is not removable at all .",
    "one can interpret it either as the topological @xmath62 piece in ( [ l0lag ] ) with real quark masses , or equivalently , as the quark mass lagrangian with the phase ( [ finphase ] ) with @xmath62 absent . except for this hand  shaking , there is an unremovable source of cp violation in the qcd lagrangian with primarily nonperturbative , topological origin . in the next section",
    "we discuss an observable effect of @xmath209 : the edm of the neutron .      as was stated in the introduction , the nonvanishing ,",

    "in this work we have presented a brief review of the neutron edm calculation in the sm . in doing this",

    "these sources have nothing in common concerning their nature and function in the theory . that of the strong interactions arises from the nontriviality of the qcd vacuum concerning its topological and nonperturbative structure . however , the cp violation source of the electroweak theory is related to the number of families ( for two families no source of cp violation , for four families there are two more sources ) , and the strength and hierarchy of the intergenerational mixings .",
    "the importance of these two contributions lies in the fact that they will always be present irrespective of what kind of extension of the sm is considered .",
    "for instance , in the supersymmetric models there are new sources of cp violation @xcite which generally exceed the experimental bounds by three orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "however , it is still meaningless to discuss the supersymmetric contribution alone , as the qcd contribution is there to exceed the bounds by several orders of magnitude unless a peccei  quinn type scenario is exploited ( such as @xcite or @xcite ) .",
    "the edm of the neutron receives contributions from strong as well as electroweak interactions as mentioned above .",
    "this remains true in any extension of the sm model .",

    "indeed , it is known that the experimental bounds on the neutron and electron edm s differ by an order of magnitude as could be taken into account by their mass ratios ; @xmath392 .",
    "this expectation is confirmed by the predictions of supersymmetry @xcite and two  doublet models @xcite .",
    "it is here that one observes the `` excess '' nature of the qcd contribution which spoils the existing bounds by several orders of magnitude . for any underlying model , consistency among the edm s and cp violation in meson systems",
