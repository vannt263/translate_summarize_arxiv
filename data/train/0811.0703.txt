    "cosmological observations have confirmed the existence of the non - baryonic dark matter . the observed dark matter relic abundance is @xmath1 and points to the existence of a stable and weakly interacting particle with a mass @xmath2 gev . in supersymmetric ( susy )",
    "models with conserved r - parity , the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) , usually the lightest neutralino , is stable and it is a perfect candidate for the dark matter .",
    "in fact , although the dark matter abundance in an arbitrary point of the susy parameter space is usually too large and only in regions where the lsp abundance is lowered effectively by annihilation the observed abundance can be reached .",
    "one of the best mechanisms to lower the dark matter abundance is the so - called coannihilation @xcite . in the coannihilation region ,",
    "the next to lightest supersymmetric particle ( nlsp ) has a mass nearly degenerate to the lsp .",
    "then the nlsp and the lsp decouple from thermal bath almost simultaneously and the lsp annihilates efficiently through collisions with the nlsp .",
    "the degeneracy required for the coannihilation to occur is generally @xmath3 a few % , where @xmath4 .",
    "numerically , this mass difference at a fixed @xmath5 value ranges from @xmath6 gev for low @xmath7 to practically zero at large @xmath7 , where @xmath7 is the universal gaugino mass .",
    "furthermore , it was pointed out in @xcite that if staus are the nlsp and its mass difference with the lsp is less than the tau mass , they destroy @xmath8li/@xmath8be nucleus through the internal conversion . with this small mass difference ,",
    "staus become long - lived , they survive until big - bang neucleosynthesis ( bbn ) starts and form bound states with nucleus .",
    "the stau - nucleus bound states decay immediately by virtual exchange of the hadronic current . in this way",
    ", it was shown that the relic abundance of the light elements is lowered effectively and the discrepancy between the observed value of @xmath8li/@xmath8be abundance @xcite and the predicted value from the standard bbn @xcite with wmap data @xcite can be solved .",
    "thus , a scenario with stau nlsp and neutralino lsp with @xmath9 could explain the relic abundance of the light elements as well as the abundance of the dark matter .",
    "at this point we could ask whether this small mass difference is really possible in the parameter space of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) or even the constrained mssm ( cmssm ) consistently with dark matter constraints . as we will show below , @xmath9 and even smaller values are possible in the cmssm . as shown in @xcite ,",
    "if the mass difference , @xmath10 , between neutralino and stau is less than the tau mass , the two - body decay is forbidden and the lifetime of stau increases by more than 10 orders of magnitude .    strictly speaking the previous discussion is correct only in the framework of the mssm without intergenerational mixing in the slepton sector , as could be , for instance , the cmssm defined at the gut scale without right - handed neutrinos , or neutrino yukawa couplings . in this case , the nlsp is only a combination of left and right - handed staus .",
    "however , there is no doubt that , in a general mssm we naturally expect some degree of intergenerational mixing in the sfermion sector . even starting from a completely universal mssm at @xmath11 in the presence of neutrino yukawa couplings , a small mixing between different sleptons",
    "is generated by renormalization group equations .",
    "moreover , there is no fundamental reason to restrict the flavour structures to the yukawa couplings and keep the soft mass matrices universal .",
    "in fact , we would expect the same mechanism responsible for the origin of flavour to generate some flavour mixing in the sfermion sector .",
    "as an example , we have flavour symmetries @xcite where we expect similar flavour structures in the yukawas and the scalar mass matrices .",
    "therefore , in general , we expect that the lightest slepton , @xmath12 , is not a pure stau , but there is some mixing with smuon and selectron . in the presence of this small intergenerational mixing , even with @xmath9 , other two - body decay channels like @xmath13 ,",
    "are still open @xcite . in this case ,",
    "given that the flavour conserving two - body decay channel is closed , the slepton lifetime will have a very good sensitivity to small lepton flavour violation ( lfv ) parameters .",
    "the lifetime will be inversely proportional to the sfermion mixing until two - body decay width becomes comparable to three or four - body decay widths .",
    "thus , it is worthwhile to study the lifetime of the sleptons in small @xmath14 case to obtain information on lfv parameters .",
    "several papers have studied in the past the possibility of measuring lfv at colliders @xcite . however , in these papers the lfv decays are always subdominant with small branching ratios and is never possible to reach the level of sensitivity we reach in our scenario . only ref .",
    "@xcite considers lfv in @xmath15 colliders through the slepton production in a long - lived stau scenario in a gauge - mediated model and as in the other works they are not sensitive either to the presence of small lepton flavour violation that we consider here .",
    "long - lived charged - particles are very interesting since they provide a clear experimental signature at the lhc @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite they conclude that even if the lifetime of the decaying particle is much longer than the size of the detector , some decays always take place inside the detector and it is possible to measure lifetimes as long as @xmath16 seconds in a particular gauge mediation scenario .    in this paper , we study lfv in the coannihilation region of the mssm with neutralino lsp and slepton nlsp with a mass difference @xmath9 . the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 , we study the case of the mssm without flavour mixing in the slepton sector . here",
    ", we show that a sizable part of the coannihilation region at large @xmath7 has @xmath9 region satisfying all the experimental constraints and we calculate the lifetime of the nlsp .",
    "then , in sec . 3 , we introduce a source of lepton flavour violation in the slepton mass matrices and we recalculate the lifetimes in terms of the lfv parameters . in sec . 4",
    ", we discuss the expected phenomenology of this scenario at the lhc and how lhc data could be used to measure small lfv parameters . finally in section 5",
    ", we present our summary and discussion .",
    "we start our analysis looking for allowed regions in the cmssm parameter space where the mass difference , @xmath10 , between the lightest neutralino mass , @xmath17 , and the lighter stau mass , @xmath18 , is smaller than tau mass , @xmath19 . in this section",
    ", we consider the case of a constrained mssm defined at the gut scale without neutrino yukawa couplings .",
    "thus , in this case , @xmath20 is equal to a combination of the right and left - handed stau and no lepton flavour violation ( lfv ) effects are present .",
    "the cmssm is parametrized by @xmath21 parameters and a sign , @xmath22 where the first three parameters are the universal gaugino and scalar masses , and the universal trilinear couplings at the gut scale , @xmath23 is the ratio of vacuum expectation values of two higgses and @xmath24 is the higgs mass parameter in the superpotential . in our numerical analysis ,",
    "we use spheno @xcite to obtain the parameters and mass spectrum at electroweak scale and use micromegas @xcite to calculate relic dark matter abundance .",
    "first , we list the experimental constraints that we have used in our analysis . the main constraint , apart from direct limits on susy masses , comes from the relic density of the dark matter abundance as reported by wmap collaboration in ref.@xcite : @xmath25 in this paper , we use more conservative range , @xmath26 but the results would remain basically unchained with a smaller range .",
    "a second constraint comes from the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon , @xmath27 , that has been measured precisely in the experiments at bnl .",
    "the final experimental result @xcite is @xmath28 and the standard model prediction is @xmath29 therefore , the difference between the experiment and the standard model prediction is given @xcite as @xmath30 which corresponds to a difference of @xmath31 standard deviations .",
    "these results seem to require a positive and sizable susy contributions to @xmath32 , although it is still not conclusive . in the following ,",
    "in all our plots we will show the regions favored by measurement of @xmath32 at a given confidence level , but we will not use it as a constraint to exclude the different points .",
    "the bound on br@xmath33 is also taken into account , but as we will see , in the region of small @xmath10 and correct dark matter abundance , @xmath34 gev .",
    "therefore the numerical prediction we obtained for br@xmath33 is always very close to the sm predictions .",

    "the green regions are not consistent with the dark matter abundance , eq .  , while the white area is the stau lsp region and therefore is excluded .",
    "note that in models where the observed dark matter abundance is accounted for other dark matter components besides the neutralino , the small @xmath10 region could be extended to the green regions below the yellow band . notice that choosing a positive and large @xmath48 , the renormalization group evolved value @xmath49 is reduced with respect to the cases of zero or negative @xmath50 .",
    "therefore the left - right entry in the stau mass matrix , @xmath51 , is also reduced .",
    "then the region of neutralino lsp , for a fixed value of the neutralino mass , @xmath52 , corresponds to smaller values of @xmath45 for positive @xmath50 than for zero or negative @xmath50 .",
    "therefore this implies slightly lighter spectrum and larger contributions to @xmath32 .",
    "anyway , the main features of the plots are maintained for different values of @xmath50 with only this slightly increase in the masses . from these plots",
    "we can see that the interesting region of correct value of dark matter relic abundance and @xmath39 corresponds always to relatively large values of @xmath7 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the coannihilation cross section decreases at larger susy masses @xcite and for sufficiently large @xmath7 the cross section is too small to produce a correct dark matter abundance , even for @xmath53 .    comparing the different @xmath5 values",
    ", we can see that at low @xmath5 the long - lived stau region corresponds to smaller values of @xmath54 gev , although it can only reach the @xmath32 favored region at 3 @xmath55 . for @xmath56 , the long - lived stau region corresponds to similar values of @xmath7 , but the required values of @xmath45 are nearly a factor two larger .",

    "the long - lived stau region corresponds to larger values of both @xmath7 and @xmath45 and it can only reach the @xmath32 favored region at 2.5 @xmath55 .",
    "this behavior of the allowed regions can be understood as follows . since the susy contribution to @xmath32 is proportional to @xmath58 , it is small when @xmath59 .",
    "but it is also suppressed at @xmath60 because the mass of the neutralino becomes heavier for large @xmath23 . with fixed @xmath50 ,",

    "<S> when the mass difference between the lightest slepton , the nlsp , and the lightest neutralino , the lsp , is smaller than the tau mass , the lifetime of the lightest slepton increases in many orders of magnitude with respect to typical lifetimes of other supersymmetric particles . </S>",
    "<S> these small mass differences are possible in the mssm and , for instance , they correspond to the coannihilation region of the cmssm for @xmath0 gev . in a general gravity - mediated mssm , where the lightest supersymmetric particle is the neutralino , the lifetime of the lightest slepton is inversely proportional to the square of the intergenerational mixing in the slepton mass matrices . </S>",
    "<S> such a long - lived slepton would produce a distinctive signature at lhc and a measurement of its lifetime would be relatively simple . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the long - lived slepton scenario offers an excellent opportunity to study lepton flavour violation at atlas and cms detectors in the lhc and an improvement of the leptonic mass insertion bounds by more than five orders of magnitude would be possible . </S>"
