    "one of the earliest successes of the standard cosmological model arose from the realisation that the early universe was hot and dense and that within these conditions some of the lighter elements can be forged from the initial soup of baryons , leptons and photons @xcite however , the period for element formation was relatively short , with the rapidly cooling universe shutting off nucleosynthesis within the first 20 minutes after the big bang @xcite .",
    "the short cooking window predicts a primordial universe dominated by hydrogen , with a helium mass fraction of 25% and trace amounts of other elements , in amazing agreement with the observed abundances ( see * ? ? ? * for a comprehensive review of the physics of the early universe ) .    even though it has proved to be very successful , the @xmath1cdm ( @xmath1 cold dark matter ) paradigm",
    "is regularly challenged .",
    "one of the more recent newcomers is the so - called @xmath0 universe @xcite , founded on the claim that the `` hubble sphere '' @xcite is an unrecognised horizon in the universe @xcite , although this been shown to be incorrect  @xcite .",
    "this model also encompassed a numerological coincidence , namely that the age of the universe , @xmath2 , and the present day hubble constant , @xmath3 , are related via @xmath4 . within @xmath1cdm ,",
    "such a coincidence occurs only for a short period of its infinite lifetime .",
    "however , if we suppose this coincidence is telling us something deeper about the universe , and demand that @xmath5 precisely at all points in the universe s history , we must demand that scale factor must evolve as @xmath6 , a very different cosmic history to @xmath1cdm . before continuing ,",
    "however , it is worth noting that this numerological relationship is only approximately true given our recent determination of cosmological parameters , with @xmath7 , providing a significant challenge to the underlying motivation of the @xmath0 cosmological model @xcite .",
    "this has not halted the continued appearance of this cosmology and it has been claimed that such a linearly expanding universe provides a better description of the observed universe , a claim that has met with resistance ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , and possesses significant underlying physical constraints , demanding interacting component to maintain a ` zero active mass ' condition to achieve linear expansion [ e.g. @xcite and @xcite ; although see @xcite ] , it continues to receive significant attention from some .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the implications of demanding the linear expansion of the @xmath0 universe on the initial stages of the universe , in particular during the epoch of nucleosynthesis . in section  [ nucleosynthesis ]",
    "we present a discussion of standard primordial nucleosynthesis as well as detailing our investigation of nucleosynthesis in the @xmath0 , with a theoretical exploration presented in section  [ melia ] and a numerical solution to the nucleosynthesis equations presented in section  [ numerical ] . in section  [ powerlaw ]",
    "we review the recent history of power - law cosmologies , finding that objections presented in favour of and against the @xmath0 cosmology have appeared in previous literature .",
    "we present our conclusions in section  [ conclusions ] .",
    "in the following we will present a combination of analytic and numerical arguments to examine the impact of demanding a linear expansion of the universe during the period of primordial nucleosynthesis . for this",
    "we employ a modified version of alterbbn , which simulates big bang nucleosynthesis by numerically integrating the yield equations for the various nuclear interactions occurring in the early universe @xcite .",
    "this code can consider a number of modifications to the physics of the early stages of the universe , but for our purposes we make two simple modifications . to enforce a linear evolution of the scale factor , the hubble",
    "constant is equal to @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the age of the universe at the epoch under consideration . given this , the temperature of the at this time is given by @xmath10 where @xmath3 is the present day value of the hubble constant , and @xmath11 is the present day temperature of the cosmic microwave background , taken to be @xmath12 ; note that in the following we have not considered the effective number of particle species which modifies the temperature profile in the early universe , although we find that this has no impact on the conclusions presented in this paper . as well as our modified cosmological calculations with alterbbn",
    ", we also undertook a standard cosmological run to provide a fiducial comparison .",
    "as noted , big bang nucleosynthesis is one of the great successes of cosmology of the last century , and the physical details are presented in numerous sources ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as well as being the staple of undergraduate courses on cosmology . here",
    "we will briefly review the key points .    ) for the standard cosmological model ( green line ) and the @xmath0 cosmology ( blue line ) .",
    "note that this has a value of roughly unity at 1 mev , diminishing quickly as the universe cools to lower energy , ensuring a freeze - out of the neutron to proton ration . at 1 mev in the @xmath0 cosmology",
    ", this has a corresponding value eight orders of magnitude larger , not decline to unity until temperatures are well below 0.01 mev .",
    "this ensures that there is no freeze - out of the proton to neutron ratio before nucleosynthesis in this cosmological model . ]    within the standard cosmological model , primordial nucleosynthesis occurs in the seconds to minutes after the big bang .",
    "given that the diproton is unbound , the build up of nuclei is dependent on the availability of free neutrons , which allow the formation of deuterium ( @xmath13h or d ) and thereafter the heavier elements . to examine this ,",
    "we define @xmath14 the expression for the dynamical equation for the evolution of @xmath15 is given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the masses of the neutron and proton respectively , and @xmath21 is the temperature of the universe ( assuming @xmath22 ) .",
    "furthermore , @xmath23 is the neutron to proton conversion rate and is given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the neutron lifetime .",
    "if @xmath23 is fast compared to the hubble expansion , the thermonuclear ratio of neutrons to protons , given by @xmath26 is maintained , meaning that , as the temperature drops , the relative availability of neutrons rapidly diminishes .",
    "however , in the standard cosmological model , this is not the case ( c.f . figure  [ freezeoutplot ] and discussion in section  [ melia ] ) ; here the expansion is dominated by the presence of the radiative components , with the expansion going as @xmath27 and as it cools below @xmath28 , the rates of @xmath29 become slow compared to expansion and the ratio of neutrons to protons is `` frozen - out '' with a ratio of ; @xmath30 at this period , the universe is still too hot for significant nucleosynthesis , entering what is known as the `` deuterium bottleneck '' , which requires a temperature below @xmath31 for @xmath32 formation to dominate over destruction , and a proportion of neutrons undergo weak decay through @xmath33 .",
    "a proportion of neutrons remain to be bound into deuterium and then helium such that the final mass fraction of @xmath34 is @xmath35 .",
    "it is straightforward to consider the above analysis in light of the @xmath0 cosmological model .",
    "the astounding thing about this relationship is that the age of the universe at the epoch of nucleosynthesis ( t@xmath36 k ) is about @xmath37 seconds , corresponds to about 30 years !",
    "clearly this age will have an impact on the resultant nucleosynthesis , begin with the freeze - out ( or , as we will see , lack of freeze - out ) in the @xmath0 universe .",
    "we can consider calculating the the appropriate rates for the @xmath0 universe in the same fashion as for the standard cosmological model ( section  [ standard ] ) .",
    "firstly , the relevant ratio of the neutron to proton conversion rate to the hubble expansion ( eqn .",
    "[ pnrate ] ) is given by @xmath38 we plot this in figure  [ freezeoutplot ] , with the blue line representing the @xmath0 universe , whereas the green line is the standard cosmological model .",
    "at a temperature of @xmath391 mev in the standard cosmological model , this term is roughly unity , dropping rapidly as the universe continues to cool , and ensuring a freeze - out of the neutron to proton ration before the onset of nucleosynthesis .",
    "however , in the @xmath0 cosmology , the corresponding term is roughly eight orders of magnitude higher at @xmath391 mev , not dropping to unity until the temperature of the universe is well below @xmath390.01 mev .",
    "the direct consequence of this is that the neutron to proton ratio maintains thermodynamic equilibrium into the epoch of nucleosynthesis , leading to a significant depletion in available neutrons for the build up of nuclei .    to further emphasise this point , in figure  [ freezeoutplot2 ] we plot the neutron to proton ratio in both the standard cosmological model , and the @xmath0 universe , as well as the theoretical equilibrium value ( eqn .",
    "[ pnratio ] ) , demonstrating the dramatic depletion of neutrons in the linearly expanding universe .",
    "as net production of deuterium ( @xmath13h ) is not significant until the temperature has decreased to @xmath390.2 mev , the expected neutron to proton ratio at that time will be @xmath40 .",
    "assuming that all neutrons get finally bound into @xmath41he , the resulting abundance of primordial helium will be @xmath42 , well below the observed value .",
    "universe ( blue line ) , while the red dashed line corresponds to the equilibrium ratio given by equation  [ dyneqn ] . at temperatures above @xmath391 mev ,",
    "the neutron to proton ratio in both cosmologies is in equilibrium , but as the standard universe cools , the neutron to proton ratio freezes out , departing from equilibrium , and then declines due to neutron decay",
    ". the precipitous decline at t@xmath39 0.05 mev is the onset of nucleosynthesis where all free neutrons are bound up into deuterium and helium .",
    "conversely , in the @xmath0 universe , the slow cooling and steady expansion ensures that the neutron to proton ratio does not depart from its equilibrium value , significantly depleting the universe of available neutrons . ]",
    "we have seen that , at the onset of nucleosynthesis , the neutron abundance in the @xmath0 cosmology has been significantly depleted due to the maintaining of equilibrium as the universe cools . here",
    "we focus on the impact of this on the resultant elemental abundances after nucleosynthesis . for this",
    ", we numerically integrate the yield equations in alterbbn , remembering that this takes into account the physics leading to the lack of a freeze - out of the neutron to proton ratio discussed in section  [ melia ] .",
    "figure  [ abundance_vs_time ] presents the results of this numerical integration , presenting the cosmic abundance of elements as a function of time ( the upper x - axis presents the corresponding temperature in mev ) .",
    "as expected , the time - scale for nucleosynthesis in the @xmath0 cosmology is over a period of years and decades , rather than the seconds and minutes seen in standard cosmological models . as expected from the analysis presented in section  [ melia ] , the universe is in equilibrium until about @xmath43s , after which the production of @xmath44 begins to exceed its destruction rate , and nucleosynthesis is underway in ernest by around @xmath45s .",
    "the lack of a freeze - out in the neutron to proton ratio is apparent , with a relative abundance of @xmath46 by this point .",
    "this deficit of neutrons feeds directly into the subsequent production of  @xmath44 and then @xmath47 , such that when nucleosynthesis is complete the resulting abundance of @xmath47 is @xmath48 .",
    "examining the other elements reveals that , while trace amounts of @xmath49he and @xmath50be are presents with abundances of @xmath51 and @xmath52 respectively , values in themselves , quite different to the observed abundances , deuterium is completely absent , having been used up in subsequent nucleosynthesis .",
    "this is in conflict with the observed primordial deuterium abundance of ( d / h)@xmath53 = @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "if the @xmath0 cosmology is to be taken as a valid cosmological model , this result is extremely problematic .",
    "cosmology ; note the scale on the lower x - axis which corresponds to multiple years in the age of the universe .",
    "the upper x - axis presents the corresponding temperature of the universe ( in mev ) . ]",
    "we note that the @xmath0 cosmology is not a new idea , but a resurgence of discussion of power - law cosmologies of the general form @xmath55 , where @xmath56 gives the linear expansion of the @xmath0 model , sometimes refereed to as a _ linearly coasting cosmology_. a number of the objections to the @xmath0 cosmology have been presented previously in terms of the analysis of power - law cosmologies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although these appear to be absent from the discussion in this latest incarnation of the linearly expanding cosmological model .",
    "various objections to the predictions of power - law cosmologies were presented by @xcite , responding to claims in earlier papers , noting several observational results that are directly in conflict with the predictions from the @xmath0 cosmological model . in the following , we focus upon the implications of linear expansion on nucleosynthesis , considering several points discussed in previous contributions .      while the discussion of primordial nucleosynthesis in an @xmath0 cosmological model has not been presented in the literature , at an oral presentation it was suggested that the idea of a `` simmering universe '' , gently cooking up elements over an extended period , might enable the production of sufficient quantities of helium in the linearly expanding universe ( melia , private communication to barnes ) .",
    "this model was derived in the original discussion of power - law cosmologies , although explicit detail in the literature is somewhat lacking @xcite .",
    "this acknowledges that weak interactions remain in thermal equilibrium for significantly longer period in power - law cosmologies than in standard cosmological models and that the neutron abundance is significantly depleted by the onset of nucleosynthesis .",
    "the claim is , however , once the production of @xmath13h overcomes photo - destruction , then inverse @xmath57-decay of protons will maintain the production of helium , bringing the resultant abundance to the observed level . a precise analysis of the approach adopted in modelling the ` simmering universe ' in previous works is difficult , as details are scant ,",
    "although it is stated that numerical realisations were undertake with the nuc123 fortran code @xcite with the required integrations apparently required quadruple precision calculations . to achieve the required helium yield ,",
    "the baryon - to - photon ratio , @xmath58 , had to be increased to @xmath51 , more than an order of magnitude larger than the measured value of @xmath59 .",
    "@xcite and @xcite also considered primordial nucleosynthesis in a linearly expanding cosmological model , partly in response to further support of the `` simmering universe '' by @xcite , again finding against this cosmological model by showing that the depletion of neutrons at nucleosynthesis results in a substantial deficit in the results abundance of helium .",
    "they also found that the helium mass fraction can be enhanced to be consistent with observational constraints by substantially boosting the baryon to photon ratio , although the resultant abundances of deuterium , @xmath49he and @xmath50li are significantly depleted at @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 respectively .",
    "as a function of the baryon to photon ratio ( blue line ) .",
    "the green vertical line is the observed baryon to photon ratio , whereas the red horizontal line is the observed mass fraction . ]",
    "we repeated this analysis for a simmering universe using our modified version of alterbbn , maintaining the expansion history and temperature dependence outlined previously ( section  [ numerical ] ) but considering the differing values of @xmath58 .",
    "the results of this appear in figure  [ heliumyield ] , which presents the @xmath41he mass fraction as a function of @xmath58 .",
    "the green dashed vertical line represents the observed value of @xmath63 , where as the red dashed horizontal line is the observed helium mass fraction of @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "as discussed above , at the observed value of @xmath58 , the @xmath0 cosmology results in a helium mass fraction of @xmath65 , far below the observed value . clearly , decreasing @xmath58 results in an even smaller helium mass factor , but increasing the baryon to photon ratio yields a higher resultant helium mass fraction .",
    "inline with previous claims , @xmath58 has to be increased to around @xmath51 , an order of magnitude above the observed limit , to achieve this substantial production of helium .",
    "given the extended period over which the `` simmering universe '' has to produce helium , it is interesting to consider the abundances of other elements in such a universe . in the following ,",
    "examine nucleosynthesis in @xmath0 cosmology , considering an boosted baryon to photon ratio of @xmath66 , with the results being presented in figure  [ abundance_vs_time_eta ] .",
    "as noted above , with this , appreciable quantities are produced during nucleosynthesis , bringing the abundance into line with observations .",
    "however , this increase in the baryon to photon ratio significantly impacts the rest of element production in the early universe .",
    "again , deuterium abundance rapidly decreases beyond @xmath67 seconds , in conflict with observations",
    ". however , there are other intriguing features , with many of the heavier elements diminishing after a few times @xmath37 seconds , leaving them absent from the universe . clearly , in the long times of nucleosynthesis in this enhanced baryon to photon universe",
    ", these lighter elements are being burnt into heavier and heavier elements . as seen in figure  [ abundance_vs_time_eta ] , at the end of nucleosynthesis ,",
    "the only appreciable elemental abundances are @xmath68h and @xmath41he , with smaller amounts of @xmath69o , @xmath70o and @xmath71o .    , but now considering a baryon to photon ratio of @xmath66 . the entire element output of alterbbn is displayed .",
    "note that while an appreciable quantity of @xmath41he is produced , other light elements are rapidly consumed and burnt into heavier elements , resulting in significant quantities of @xmath69o , @xmath70o and @xmath71o .",
    "we caution the reader , however , that the 88 reactions considered in this code only include those up to these elements and hence we currently do not know if this is the true end point of nucleosynthesis in the simmering universe . ]    at this point , it is worth noting that this conclusion is somewhat different to that presented by @xcite who found that , while not substantial , their modelling suggested that the simmering @xmath0 universe produces some light elements . to understand this , it is important to understand that their considered following the abundances of light elements in statistical equilibrium at high temperatures until they reach freeze - out values .",
    "however , they considered a limited number of elements and rates in their analysis , limiting nucleosynthesis to the production of the lightest elements .",
    "the alterbbn algorithm , on the other hand , considers a total of 88 reaction rates to calculate the evolution of the elemental abundances through nucleosynthesis @xcite , and hence provides pathways to heavier elements that were not considered in this earlier analysis , something simply revealed by `` switching - off '' some of the reactions in our numerical approach .",
    "hence , if @xcite had considered these additional reactions , they too would have found that the deuterium , @xmath49he and @xmath50li they found after nucleosynthesis were burnt to heavier elements as seen in figure  [ abundance_vs_time_eta ] .",
    "it is important , however , to insert a word of caution into the element abundances found after nucleosynthesis in this present study . in the 88 reactions considered in _",
    "alterbbn _ , the heaviest elements produced are the isotopes of oxygen .",
    "hence , it is quite likely that final oxygen abundances present in figure  [ abundance_vs_time_eta ] are due to the lack of inclusion of other reaction pathways to yet heavier elements , and we should expect that this simmering universe , very heavy elements are produced . including these reaction paths into alterbbn",
    "is beyond the scope of this work , but clearly this burning of all light elements , other than hydrogen and helium , into heavier elements is catastrophic for this cosmology and this is not a route to save the @xmath0 cosmological model .",
    "we have considered primordial nucleosynthesis within the recently proposed @xmath0 universe , a cosmology that demands linear evolution of the scale - factor at all times .",
    "we show that , compared to the standard @xmath1cdm cosmology , this universe cools extremely slowly , with the period of nucleosynthesis occurring several months to years after the big bang , rather than the seconds to minutes we encounter typical cosmological models .",
    "the long - term cooling has a significant influence on the state of the universe just before nucleosynthesis , as the @xmath29 reaction rates remaining in equilibrium over a substantial time , meaning that there is no freeze - out of the proton - to - neutron abundance .",
    "the implication of this is that at the onset of nucleosynthesis in ernest the proton - to - neutron abundance is @xmath46 , rather than the @xmath72 in standard cosmological models .",
    "this lack of available neutrons feeds into the abundance of deuterium , and then into the production of @xmath47 , with a resulting abundance of @xmath65 , differing significantly from the observed mass fraction of @xmath3925% .",
    "furthermore , the other resulting elemental abundances are also in conflict with the observed values .",
    "we showed that the ` simmering universe ' can result in an appreciable helium mass fraction if the baryon to photon ratio , @xmath58 is boosted to @xmath51 , more than order of magnitude larger than the observed value .",
    "however , the sustained period of nucleosynthesis in this model results in the synthesis of substantial quantities of heavier elements , robbing the universe of any lighter elements .",
    "the limitations of the nuclear pathways considered in this study have shown this up to oxygen and it is envisaged that this continues to heavier elements . hence , the @xmath0 cosmological model appears to be incapable of producing a realistic primordial abundance of elements .    in closing",
    ", we note that one of the apparent strngths of the @xmath0 cosmological model is some how `` simpler '' than the standard cosmological model @xcite , although this simplicity hides the completely unknown internal physics of the dark sector to demand a linear expansion @xcite .",
    "the inability of this model to reproduce anywhere near the required abundances of elements in primordial nucleosynthesis is also very troubling , and further additional physics is needed in the early universe to attempt to bring this cosmology into agreement with observations .",
    "whatever the case , this `` simple '' cosmological model does not appear to be so simple after all .",
