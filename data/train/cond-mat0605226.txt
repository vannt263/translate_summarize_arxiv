    "with constantly improving resolution of experimental techniques , novel features in the global phase diagram of high - t@xmath0 cuprate superconductors have emerged .",
    "one of the most striking is the observation by scanning tunnelling microscopy ( stm ) , in the pseudogap phase of underdoped bi@xmath1sr@xmath1cacu@xmath1o@xmath2",
    "@xcite and ca@xmath3na@xmath4cuo@xmath1cl@xmath1 single crystals  @xcite , of a form of local electronic ordering , with a spatial period close to four lattice spacings .",
    "these observations raise important theoretical questions about the relevance of such structures in the framework of strongly correlated models . here",
    ", we analyze the stability of new inhomogeneous phases  @xcite which can compete in certain conditions with the d - wave superconducting rvb state  @xcite . both mean - field  @xcite ( mf ) and numerical variational monte carlo results  @xcite(vmc ) will be summarized here .",
    "we describe the doped antiferromagnet by a @xmath5 model , @xmath6 first , we replace the local constraints of no doubly occupied sites by statistical gutzwiller weights ( see below ) and use a mean - field decoupling in the particle - hole channel to obtain a self - consistent renormalized mf hamiltonian  @xcite , @xmath7 where @xmath8 and where we explicitly assume an inhomogeneous solution and hence inhomogeneous gutzwiller factors , @xmath9^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\ , , \\nonumber     \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 , @xmath11 are the local hole densities",
    ". the @xmath12 terms account for the correlations of the probabilities between nearest - neighbor sites  @xcite and were not included in the original mf treatment  @xcite of the inhomogeneous state .",
    "our mf scheme applies to the `` normal '' phase .",
    "in contrast , an additional decoupling in the particle - particle channel leads to an rvb superconducting state  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the parent insulating rvb state can be viewed as a staggered flux state ( sfp )  @xcite mf solution of the above hamiltonian .",
    "we show here that , away from half - filling , the sfp spontaneously acquires ( small ) bond modulations .",
    "assuming a @xmath13 supercell with overall rotational symmetry ( see fig .",
    "[ fig-1 ] ) , the mf equations have been solved for an average doping of 1/8 . a typical solution depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig-1 ] exhibits orbital currents according to the original sfp pattern .",
    "however , small modulations of the bond hoppings @xmath14 and bond exchange terms @xmath15 as well as the on - site densities appear spontaneously .",
    "numerical values of the bond ( site ) parameters for @xmath16 are given in table  [ table : bond ] ( table  [ table : site ] ) .",
    "the charge - density - wave ( cdw ) modulation is found to be an order of magnitude smaller than the bond - order - wave ( bow ) modulations .",
    "it was argued recently  @xcite that this instability is connected to nesting properties of the small ellipsoidal fermi pockets of the sfp .",
    "the mf results have been tested by an exact ( within statistical errors ) vmc energy minimization and evaluation of the order parameters ( on a @xmath17 lattice with mixed boundary conditions , see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "comparative values are shown in tables  [ table : bond ] & [ table : site ] .",
    "interestingly , the vmc simulation also predicts a dominant bow component w.r.t the cdw one .",
    "however , an overall reduction of the magnitudes of these modulations by an approximate factor of 4 compared to mf is seen .",
    "how such a state can compete with the d - wave rvb superconductor is still unclear .",
    "however , our calculations  @xcite have suggested that the bow sfp is less sensitive than the superconducting state to a moderate ( e.g. nearest - neighbor ) coulomb repulsion . in this competition ,",
    "the role of the disorder and/or the surface might be crucial .",
