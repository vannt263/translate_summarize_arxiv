    "( [ modelloxy ] ) , here we tackle the evolution of the system by means of an _ information - flux approach _ , which is specifically designed for multi - spin interactions  @xcite .",
    "our method does not rely on the explicit analysis of the energy spectrum of the chain and allows us to gather an intuitive picture of the dynamics at hand .",
    "such an approach has already proved its flexibility and efficiency in identifying hamiltonian configurations suitable for state transfer and entanglement generation  @xcite .",
    "the information - flux approach requires the time - evolved form of specific operators @xmath11 in the heisenberg picture , which is given by @xmath12 with @xmath13 the time evolution operator , @xmath14 and @xmath15 . using this method ,",

    ", we will exploit the time dependence of the couplings in order to induce precisely this effect .",
    "our task here is the transmission of quantum information from the first spin to the last one in the chain .",
    "this requires the study of @xmath18 s , which can be decomposed into the operator basis built out of all possible tensor products of @xmath19 with @xmath20 the @xmath21 identity operator applied to spin @xmath22 .",
    "we have @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the initial state of the whole chain , the first spin being in @xmath25 and the rest of the chain in @xmath26 ( this definition can be easily generalized to the case of mixed states of the chain ) .",

    "if the interest is focused on the evolution of @xmath30 , it should occupy the first node of the graph .",
    "any operator resulting from the commutators of @xmath30 with the hamiltonian should be included in the graph and linked to it with an oriented edge .",
    "these steps are repeated as necessary and the construction process ends when no new operator is created on commutation .",
    "a numerical weight , determined by the performed commutations and needed in order to calculate the information flux , is attached to each edge of the graph .",

    "the method can be explicitly extended to any time - dependent model . however ,",
    "in our numerical analysis we divide the total time of the evolution in a series of short steps within which the hamiltonian is taken as constant . in this way , in the limit of a large number of steps and correspondingly short time steps , the flux of information can be accurately evaluated by means of only a light computational effort . a cut - off in the number of considered temporal steps",

    "they can thus be easily derived from the graph in fig .",

    "a similar transport of information from the leftmost to the rightmost part of the graph is achieved by kicking information using a pattern given by fixing @xmath82 ( @xmath83 ) and alternately changing the amplitude of @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) and @xmath86 in a way so as to satisfy the conditions stated above . after a sequence of @xmath0 ( for time - dependent @xmath84 and @xmath85 ) or @xmath87 kicks ( for time - dependent @xmath86 and either @xmath84 or @xmath85 ) , one obtains @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the total time of the evolution . by initially preparing the @xmath90 spin of the chain ( except the first ) in an eigenstate of @xmath91 ,",
    "there is a complete end - to - end transport of information across the chain .",
    "this evolution interaction can thus be exploited for a perfect state transfer exactly as it happens for the hamiltonian model of ref .",
    "@xcite . quite interestingly ,",
    "any other state - transfer protocol relying on the same information - flux structure , as those in refs .",
    "@xcite , can be mapped into the very same temporal pattern of information kicking illustrated here .",
    "this is the main result of our investigation , proving that an alternative to the standard architecture of properly arranged interaction - strength patterns for quantum state transfer is actually possible .",
    "the key is the introduction of an alternated series of non - overlapping temporal kicks of information .",
    "the equivalence of the two scenarios has here been proven in terms of an isomorphism of the respective information fluxes and is , as such , completely general .",
    "depending on the details of a specific practical realization of the intra - chain couplings , temporal control of the form highlighted here can be more convenient than pre - fabrication of a specific pattern of static coupling strengths .",
    "this is the case , for instance , for quasi - unidimensional optical lattices loaded with neutral atoms , where inter - site couplings are achievable in a time - controlled way via external optical potentials or cold atomic collisions . in perspective",
    ", this could also be a viable option in solid - state structures ( such as arrays of josephson junctions ) , where fabrication of exactly the pattern required for ideal state transfer would be demanding ( if not prohibitive ) already at moderate chain lengths . achieving control via proper voltage / magnetic pulses inducing time - controlled information kicks would be a possibility to exploit instead .",
    "in order to go beyond the idealization of the scheme assessed in the previous section and make our analysis closer to more realistic situations , the ideal conditions on the pattern of time - dependent couplings invoked before will be relaxed here .",
    "let us first consider @xmath92 with @xmath2 and @xmath4 following the behavior dictated by @xmath93^m,\\\\ & b(t)=b_{max}[\\cos(t+\\pi/4)]^m , \\end{split } \\label{sincos}\\ ] ] where @xmath94 are the maximum values of @xmath2 and @xmath4 ( properly chosen in order to satisfy the integral condition ) and @xmath95 is an even number .",
    "pulse shapes of this form ( for moderate values of @xmath95 ) are routinely generated by commercial pulse generators .",
    "a large value of @xmath95 obviously implies small overlap between the two coupling functions .",
    "a period of @xmath96 will correspond to a `` horizontal '' and a `` vertical '' kick in the associated operator graph . for a numerical analysis of the information - flux behavior under the action of this time - dependent hamiltonian",
    ", we divided the total time interval @xmath97 $ ] in short steps . within each of them , both @xmath2 and @xmath4 are taken as constant and numerically equal to the average values they assume in the respective time window . in this way , the recurrence formulas presented in sec .  [ informationflux ] allow us to estimate the evolution of @xmath40 or @xmath39 for the duration of the step . clearly , the shorter is the time step , the more accurate is the estimate .",
    "the method is then iterated for each step and the total evolution of @xmath40 or @xmath39 is finally reconstructed . as the number of operators involved in each decomposition is equal to @xmath98 , a light computational power is required .    in order to evaluate the performance of our scheme , both the coefficient @xmath99 , attached to @xmath100 in the decomposition of @xmath101 , and @xmath102 , attached to @xmath103 in the decomposition of @xmath104 , should be studied .",
    "however , one can equally well characterize the whole state transfer process simply by considering @xmath105 only .",

    ", while the arrangement of external potentials with a desired time - dependence can be relatively straightforward , this might not be the case for @xmath116 s , which are in general determined by coupling mechanisms internal to the chain itself and hardly controllable with the degree of accuracy required by our scheme .",
    "we thus make our requests lighter by taking @xmath84 as constant and allowing a time dependence only for the external magnetic field .",
    "obviously , it is formally the same to take a constant @xmath86 with time - varying @xmath2 .",
    "however , pragmatically our choice seems to us to be the least demanding .",
    "we thus adapt the strategy assessed before to the case of @xmath117 .",
    "our quantitative study shows that a slight modification to the sinusoidal trend described before is sufficient to retain the efficiency of the protocol .",

    "in this section we discuss another interesting aspect of the proposed model , namely the possibility to generate genuine multi - partite entanglement .",
    "bi - partite as well as multi - partite entanglement creation in spin chains has been recently studied from different points of view .",
    "for instance , one can generate entanglement by means of a proper pattern of coupling parameters  @xcite , by driving the evolution through a resonant interaction  @xcite , by performing a global quench  @xcite , or by leaving two empty sites in a uniformly filled chain  @xcite . by assuming the ability to initialize the state of the chain before the application of the pulse sequence in the protocol proposed in this article ( we necessarily have more demanding requirements for this particular task )",

    "such a resource is well - known to be useful for multi - agent protocols for distributed qip like quantum secret sharing , remote implementation of unknown operations and quantum average estimation  @xcite .",
    "let us consider again the hamiltonian @xmath10 in eq .",
    "( [ modelloxy ] ) under the ideal conditions mentioned above .",
    "it is interesting to notice that , after the proper kicking of information , the evolution of _ all _ the spin operators associated with the elements of the chain have exactly the same form as those obtained by using the model proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we now want to evaluate the dynamics of a particular pure state of the chain under the action of this hamiltonian . we will need to abandon the assumption that at most a single spin excitation populates the system .",
    "it is straightforward to check that , whenever spin @xmath22 is in an eigenstate of @xmath132 , the corresponding symmetric spin @xmath133 will end up in the same state .",

    "we have shown that the evolution of spin operators under the action of a site - dependent hamiltonian that is already known to allow perfect state transfer can be mimicked by the use of a homogeneous time - dependent hamiltonian .",
    "the engineering of the coupling strengths , necessary in the first scenario , is thus converted to a temporal arrangement of the interaction terms .",
    "we have discussed a particularly interesting case where such a time dependence can be reduced to the requirement of just a non - constant magnetic field affecting the spins of the chain .",
