    "subdwarf b ( sdb ) stars are core helium burning stars with very thin hydrogen envelopes which all have masses of 0.46 - 0.50 solar masses and can be identified with models of extreme horizontal branch ( ehb ) stars ( heber , 1986 ) .",
    "the atmospheres of sdb stars are typically deficient in helium by more than one order of magnitude , but there is a wide spread from solar he / h to stars with he / h@xmath110@xmath2 .",
    "these he abundances are still much too large to be accounted for by diffusion , i.e. by the balance between radiative levitation and gravity ( michaud et al . , 1989 ) which predicts he abundances * lower * by two orders of magnitudes than the average observed he abundance of he / h@xmath310@xmath4 ( see fontaine & chayer , 1997 ) .",
    "since the diffusion timescale is small ( 10@xmath5 yrs ) compared to the ehb lifetime ( 10@xmath6 yrs ) , * no * he should be visible in the radiative atmospheres : the puzzle here is not so much a lack of he but an excess in the sdb atmospheres .",
    "modelling of metal diffusion in sdb stars is still in its infancy .",
    "first attempts have been published by charpinet et al .",
    "( 1997 ) for fe and unglaub & bues ( 2001 ) for c , n and o but met the observational constraints with very little success ( except for iron ) .",
    "stellar winds have frequently been suggested as an explanation .",
    "the first realistic calculations have been carried out by fontaine & chayer ( 1997 ) and unglaub & bues ( 1998 , 2001 ) . the observed he abundances can indeed be explained if a mass loss rate of 10@xmath7 to 10@xmath8 msolar / yr is adopted .",
    "mass loss has been detected in sdo stars which are , however , considerably more luminous than sdb stars .",
    "( t@xmath9=40600k , logg=4.5 , rauch , 1993 ) for example displays strong , broad , blue shifted n  v lines produced in its stellar wind .    since sdb stars are less luminous we expect the mass loss rates to be lower than in sdo stars and therefore harder to detect .",
    "indeed , up to now there is no observational proof for mass loss and , therefore , the mass loss rate is still a free parameter for diffusion models .",
    "first hints about stellar winds came from the quantitative analysis of optical blue spectra obtained during the survey of maxted et al .",
    "they derived atmospheric parameters of 40 sdb stars from balmer ( h@xmath10 to h9 ) and he i lines using static nlte model atmospheres ( see napiwotzki , 1997 ) .",
    "the results are reproduced in figure 1 . as can be seen all but five stars fall onto the extreme horizontal branch as expected .",
    "the five stars above the ehb in fig .  1 have probably already evolved from the ehb .",
    "a comparison of theoretical h@xmath0 line profiles ( synthesised for the atmospheric parameters derived from the blue spectra , see maxted et al . , 2001 ) to the observations revealed perfect matches for all stars except for the four post - ehb stars ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "by plotting the goodness of fit versus luminosity ( fig .",
    "3 ) of the stars a clear trend becomes obvious .",
    "the quality of the fit deteriorates with increasing luminosity . in the optical spectral range h@xmath0",
    "is the line most sensitive to stellar winds .",
    "line asymmetries are another signature indicative of a stellar wind .    since mass loss rates of hot stars are expected to increase with luminosity ( pauldrach et al . , 1998 )",
    ", we conjecture that the observed deviations of the h@xmath0 lines from the predictions of static nlte models for the most luminous stars in our sample are caused by stellar winds .",
    "the somewhat asymmetric profiles of pg0909 + 164 and pg1000 + 408 make these two targets the best candidates .",
    "sdb stars form a fairly homogenous group of stars which evolve to higher luminosities ( from 10@xmath11 to 10@xmath4 eddington luminosities , see fig .",
    "3 ) , into the regime where winds switch on . if we can establish that some sdb stars do have winds , it will provide an important test for models of line - driven winds .",
