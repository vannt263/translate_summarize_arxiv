    "in the four - dimensional spacevelocity the spherically symmetric metric is given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are functions of @xmath8 and @xmath9 alone , and comoving coordinates @xmath10 have been used . with the above choice of coordinates , the zero - component of the geodesic equation becomes an identity , and since @xmath9 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are constants along the geodesics , one has @xmath13 and therefore @xmath14 the metric ( 1.1 ) shows that the area of the sphere @xmath15 is given by @xmath16 and that @xmath7 should satisfy @xmath17 .",
    "the possibility that @xmath18 at a point @xmath19 is excluded since it would allow the lines @xmath20 at the neighboring points @xmath19 and @xmath21 to coincide at @xmath19 , thus creating a caustic surface at which the comoving coordinates break down .",
    "as has been shown in part i the universe expands by the null condition @xmath22 , and if the expansion is spherically symmetric one has @xmath23 . the metric ( 1.1 ) then yields @xmath24 thus @xmath25 this is the differential equation that determines the universe expansion . in the following",
    "we solve the gravitational field equations in order to find out the function @xmath26 .",
    "the gravitational field equations , written in the form @xmath27 where @xmath28 with @xmath29 and @xmath30 , are now solved .",
    "one finds that the only nonvanishing components of @xmath31 are @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , and that @xmath36 .",
    "one obtains three independent field equations ( dot and prime denote derivatives with @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) @xmath37",
    "@xmath38 @xmath39+\\frac{1}{r}\\dot{r}\\dot{\\mu}+\\left(\\frac{\\dot{r}}{r}\\right)^2 + \\frac{1}{r^2}=\\kappa\\tau^2\\rho_{eff}.\\eqno(1.7)\\ ] ]",
    "the solution of ( 1.6 ) satisfying the condition @xmath40 is given by @xmath41 where @xmath42 is an arbitrary function of the coordinate @xmath9 and satisfies the condition @xmath43 .",
    "substituting ( 2.1 ) in the other two field equations ( 1.5 ) and ( 1.7 ) then gives @xmath44 @xmath45 respectively .",
    "the simplest solution of the above two equations , which satisfies the condition @xmath46 , is given by @xmath47 .",
    "using this in eqs .",
    "( 2.2 ) and ( 2.3 ) gives @xmath48 , and @xmath49 , respectively .",
    "using the values of @xmath50 and @xmath51 , we obtain @xmath52 where @xmath53 .",
    "we also obtain @xmath54 @xmath55    accordingly , the line element of the universe is given by @xmath56 or ,",
    "@xmath57 this line element is the comparable to the frw line element in the standard theory .",
    "it will be recalled that the universe expansion is determined by eq .",
    "( 1.2 ) , @xmath58 .",
    "the only thing that is left to be determined is the sign of @xmath59 or the pressure @xmath60 .",
    "thus we have @xmath61",
    "for @xmath62 one obtains @xmath63 this is obviously a closed universe , and presents a decelerating expansion .    for @xmath4",
    "one obtains @xmath64 this is now an open accelerating universe .    for @xmath65",
    "we have , of course , @xmath66 .",
    "from the above one can write the expansion of the universe in the standard hubble form @xmath67 with @xmath68,\\eqno(4.1)\\ ] ] where @xmath69 . thus @xmath70 depends on the distance it is being measured @xcite .",
    "it is well - known that the farther the distance , the lower the value for @xmath70 is measured .",
    "this is possible only for @xmath4 , i.e. when the universe is accelerating . in that case",
    "the pressure is positive .",
    "figure 1 describes the hubble diagram of the above solutions for the three types of expansion for values of @xmath3 from 100 to 0.245 .",
    "the figure describes the three - phase evolution of the universe .",
    "curves ( 1)-(5 ) represent the stages of _ decelerating expansion _ according to eq .",
    "as the density of matter @xmath71 decreases , the universe goes over from the lower curves to the upper ones , but it does not have enough time to close up to a big crunch .",
    "the universe subsequently goes over to curve ( 6 ) with @xmath65 , at which time it has a constant expansion for a fraction of a second .",
    "this then followed by going to the upper curves ( 7 ) and ( 8) with @xmath4 , where the universe expands with _ acceleration _ according to eq .",
    "8 fits the present situation of the universe . for curves ( 1)-(4 ) in the diagram we use the cutoff when the curves were at their maximum .",
    "to find out the numerical value of @xmath1 we use the relationship between @xmath69 and @xmath70 given by eq .",
    "( 4.1)(cr denote values according to cosmological relativity ) : @xmath72,\\eqno(5.1)\\ ] ] where @xmath73 is the redshift and @xmath74 with @xmath75 .",
    "( notice that our @xmath76 is different from the standard @xmath77 defined with @xmath70 . )",
    "the redshift parameter @xmath78 determines the distance at which @xmath70 is measured .",
    "we choose @xmath79 and take for @xmath80 , its value at the present time ( corresponds to 0.32 in the standard theory ) , eq .",
    "( 5.1 ) then gives @xmath81 at @xmath79 the corresponding hubble parameter @xmath70 according to the latest results from hst can be taken @xcite as @xmath82km / s - mpc , thus @xmath83km / s - mpc , or @xmath84 and @xmath85    what is left is to find the value of @xmath86 .",
    "we have @xmath87 , where @xmath88 and @xmath75 .",
    "thus @xmath89 , or @xmath90 as is seen from the above equations one has @xmath91 which means the universe is euclidean .",
    "our results confirm those of the supernovae experiments and indicate on the existance of the dark energy as has recently received confirmation from the boomerang cosmic microwave background experiment @xcite , which showed that the universe is euclidean .",
    "one has to add the time coordinate and the result is a five - dimensional theory of space - time - velocity .",
    "one can show that all the classical experiments predicted by general relativity are also predicted by cgr . also predicted a wave equation for gravitational radiation . in the linear approximation one",
    "obtains @xmath92 where @xmath93 is a first approximation term , @xmath94 @xmath95 hence cgr predicts that gravitational waves depend not only on space and time but also on the redshift of the emitting source .",
