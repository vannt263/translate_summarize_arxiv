    "in the context of classical algebraic geometry , consider a given embedded complex projective manifold @xmath0 .",
    "one of the typically used techniques was to replace @xmath1 by some of its smooth hyperplane sections , @xmath2 .",
    "thus , the dimension of @xmath1 is decreased and classification results may be obtained inductively .",
    "the efficiency of the method depends on the possibility of transferring some known special properties from @xmath3 to @xmath1 . in general ,",
    "given @xmath4 , there is no _ smooth _",
    "@xmath0 such that @xmath3 is one of its hyperplane sections .",
    "one can say that _",
    "@xmath1 is more special then @xmath3_.    the present paper is a survey of contemporary aspects of the hyperplane section technique . a first important `` modern '' incarnation of the above principle is given by lefschetz s theorem , showing that the topology of @xmath3 strongly reflects that of @xmath1 ( see @xcite ) . from a geometrical point of view",
    ", we are usually given some regular map , say @xmath5 , making @xmath3 _ special _ ; e.g. , a fano fibration .",
    "we would like to extend this map to @xmath1 .",
    "it was discovered by sommese , in his innovative early paper @xcite , that the extension is always possible , if one only assumes that the general fiber of @xmath6 has dimension at least two .",
    "his proof is based on lefschetz s theorem and on ( very much related ) vanishing results of kodaira type . in the same paper ,",
    "sommese showed that when @xmath6 is smooth and extends , the dimension of @xmath7 can not be too large .",
    "it soon became clear that the extension problem is much harder when @xmath8 .",
    "fujita @xcite further refined some of the techniques and considered new applications e.g. , when @xmath6 is a @xmath9-bundle or a blowing - up . in the case of three folds , fine results were found by bdescu @xcite , when @xmath3 is a @xmath10-bundle over a curve and by sommese @xcite , when @xmath3 is not relatively minimal .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the classical context of hyperplane sections was gradually replaced by the more general situation when @xmath2 is merely an ample divisor , and no projective embedding of @xmath1 is given .",
    "this is a substantial generalization , since in the new setting the normal bundle of @xmath3 in @xmath1 is _ not _ specified .    the appearance of mori theory made possible a change of both the point of view and the techniques ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the isomorphism between the picard groups of @xmath1 and @xmath3 given by the lefschetz theorem leads to an inclusion between the kleiman ",
    "mori cones @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "as is well known , faces of these cones describe non - trivial morphisms defined on @xmath3 and @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "so , the original question of extending maps from @xmath3 to @xmath1 translates into a comparison problem between these cones .",
    "ideally , when the two cones are equal , all morphisms from @xmath3 extend to @xmath1 ( see e.g. , @xcite and section 8 for results in this direction , usually when @xmath1 or @xmath3 are fano manifolds ) . in the general case , what we can hope for is to extend the contraction of an extremal ray of @xmath3 ( cf .",
    "this is not always possible , but very few counterexamples are known ( see section 4 for this intriguing aspect ) .",
    "the techniques used in this setting are the cone theorem , due to mori , and the contraction theorem , due to kawamata  reid  shokurov , combined with the well behaved deformation theory of families of rational curves @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite and @xcite for some useful facts about special families of rational curves , coming from extremal rays .",
    "general results on extending morphisms are discussed in section 3 ; in section 5 we concentrate on the special situation when @xmath6 is a @xmath9-bundle or a blowing - up .",
    "we pay special attention to the case of @xmath10-bundles , which is the most difficult . a ( still open ) main conjecture on the subject is stated and various related facts are proved in section 7 . the afore mentioned results by bdescu and sommese on three folds are recovered in section 6 , using the mori theory point of view ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . in the last section",
    "we discuss the ascent of some good properties from @xmath3 to @xmath1 : e.g. , being uniruled , or rationally connected , or rational , etc .",
    "we have tried to write a complete and coherent exposition , also accessible to the nonspecialist .",
    "we included several new proofs and sometimes substantial simplifications of the original arguments .",

    "let @xmath1 be a projective manifold and let @xmath2 be a smooth ample divisor .",
    "it is a natural classical question to try to understand how the structure of @xmath3 determines the one of @xmath1 .",
    "more precisely , given a surjective morphism @xmath52 associated to a linear system @xmath53 , we look for a linear system @xmath54 on @xmath1 defining a regular map @xmath55 onto a projective variety @xmath56 , such that the following diagram @xmath57_p \\ar @{^{(}->}[r ] & x \\ar[d]^{\\overline{p } } \\\\ z \\ar[r]_{\\alpha } & w } \\ ] ] commutes .",
    "if the morphism @xmath58 is finite we say that @xmath59 is a _ lifting _ of @xmath6 . if @xmath60 , that is if @xmath61 is an isomorphism onto its image , we say that @xmath59 is a _ strict lifting _ of @xmath6 , or that @xmath6 is _ extendable _ to @xmath59 .",

    "up to taking the remmert ",

    "@xmath6 is birational and @xmath67 ; in this case @xmath58 may be of degree @xmath68 .",
    "a simple example is obtained as follows .",

    "if the morphism @xmath6 is extendable , our aim is to describe @xmath1 by using the structure morphism @xmath59 .",
    "the occurrence that @xmath6 is not extendable forces @xmath1 to satisfy geometric constraints which , in turn , make @xmath1 special enough to be completely classified .    as a typical example , consider the following natural question , formulated in the classical context :    [ zeroq ] let @xmath1 be an @xmath44-dimensional manifold embedded in a projective space @xmath70 .",
