    "the opera neutrino experiment at the underground gran sasso laboratory ( lngs ) has recently determined the muon neutrino ( @xmath2 ) velocity with high accuracy through the measurement of the flight time and the distance ( 730 km ) between the source of the cngs neutrino beam at cern ( cern neutrino beam to gran sasso ) and the opera detector at the lngs  @xcite .",
    "the mean neutrino energy is 17 gev .",
    "very surprisingly , the opera experiment found that neutrinos arrived earlier than expected from luminal speed by a time interval @xmath3 this implies a superluminal propagation velocity for neutrinos by a relative amount @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the vacuum light speed . also , there is no significant difference between the values of @xmath6 measured for the lower- and higher- energy data with @xmath7 13  gev and 43  gev , respectively .",
    "interestingly , this is compatible with the minos results  @xcite .",
    "although not statistically significant , the minos collaboration has found  @xcite @xmath8 for muon neutrino with a spectrum peaking at about 3 gev , and a tail extending above 100 gev . moreover , the earlier short - baseline experiments have set the upper bounds on @xmath9 around @xmath10 in the energy range from 30 gev to 200 gev  @xcite .",
    "of course , the technical issues in the opera experiment such as pulse modelling , timing and distance measurement deserve further experimental scrutiny . other experiments like minos and t2k",
    "are also needed to to do independent measurements for further confirmation due to neutrino oscillations . from theoretical point of view , many groups have already studied the possible solutions to the opera anomaly  @xcite . for an early similar study ,",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite . especially , the background dependent lorentz violation ( bdlv ) has been proposed by considering the spin-2 , spin-1 and spin-0 particles , respectively in refs .",
    "@xcite .    moreover , the detection of neutrinos emitted from sn1987a gave us a lot of information not only on the process of supernova explosion , but also on neutrino properties .",
    "the irvine - michigan - brookhaven ( imb )  @xcite , baksan  @xcite , and kamiokande ii  @xcite experiments collected @xmath11 neutrino events ( presumably mainly @xmath12 ) with energies between @xmath13 and @xmath14 within 12.4 seconds . in particular , the neutrinos arrived on the earth about 4 hours before the corresponding light .",
    "although this is compatible with the supernova explosion models , we can still obtain the upper limit on @xmath6 @xmath15 this limit should be understood with an order - one uncertainty since the precise time delay between light and neutrinos is unknown .",
    "in addition , the magic  @xcite , hess  @xcite , and fermi  @xcite collaborations have reported time - lags in the arrival times of high - energy photons , as compared with photons of lower energies .",
    "the most conservative interpretations of such time - lags are that they are due to emission mechanisms at the sources , which are still largely unknown at present",
    ". however , such delays might also be the hints for the energy - dependent vacuum refractive index , as first proposed fourteen years ago in ref .",
    "assuming that the refractive index @xmath16 depends linearly on the @xmath17-ray energy @xmath18 , _ i.e. _ , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the effective quantum gravity scale , it was shown that the time delays observed by the magic  @xcite , hess  @xcite , and fermi  @xcite collaborations are compatible with each other for @xmath20 around @xmath21 gev  @xcite . also , there are the stringent constraints coming from the synchrotron radiation of the crab nebula  @xcite .",
    "the d - particle models of space - time foam have been proposed to explain all these effects within the framework of string / brane theory , based on a stringy analogue of the interaction of a photon with internal degrees of freedom in a conventional medium  @xcite",
    ". however , fermi observation of grb 090510 seems to allow only much smaller value for time delay and then requires @xmath22  @xcite .",
    "because these data probe different redshift ranges , they may be compatible with each other by considering a redshift dependent d - particle density  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we revisit the lorentz violation in the type iib string theory with d3-branes and d7-branes  @xcite .",
    "we study the relativisitc particle velocities in details , and show that there exist both subluminal and superluminal particle propagations . in particular , the extra contributions to the particle velocity @xmath23 from string theory is proportional to both the particle energy and the d3-brane number density , and is inversely proportional to the string scale .",
    "thus , we can realize the background dependent lorentz violation naturally by varying the d3-brane number density in space time . to explain the opera and minos experiments",
    ", the string scale should be around @xmath1 gev . with very tiny d3-brane number density on the interstellar scale",
    ", we can also explain the magic , hess , and fermi experiments simultaneously .",
    "interestingly , we can automatically satisfy all the stringent constraints from the synchrotron radiation of the crab nebula  @xcite , the sn1987a observations on neutrinos  @xcite , and the cosmic ray experiments on charged leptons  @xcite .",
    "the possible phenomenological challenges to our models from the relevant experiments done on the earth will be briefly addressed as well .",
    "we consider the type iib string theory with d3-branes and d7-branes where the d3-branes are inside the d7-branes  @xcite .",
    "the d3-branes wrap a three - cycle , and the d7-branes wrap a four - cycle .",
    "thus , the d3-branes can be considered as point particles in the universe , _ i.e. _ , the d - particles , while the sm particles are on the world - volume of the d7-branes . for the particles ( called nd particles ) arising from the open strings between the d7-branes and d3-branes which satisfy the neumann ( n ) and dirichlet ( d ) boundary conditions respectively on the d7-branes and d3-branes , their gauge couplings with the gauge fields on the d7-branes",
    "are @xmath24 where @xmath25 are the gauge couplings on the d7-branes , and @xmath26 denotes the volume of the extra four spatial dimensions of the d7 branes transverse to the d3-branes  @xcite . because the minkowski space dimensions are non - compact , @xmath26 is infinity and then @xmath27 is zero .",
    "thus , the sm particles have no interactions with the nd particles on the d3-brane or d - particles .",
    "to have the interactions between the particles on d7-branes and the nd particles , we consider the d3-brane foam , _",
    "i.e. _ , the d3-branes are distributed in the whole universe .",
    "we assume that the @xmath28 is the average three - dimensional volume which has a d3-brane locally in the minkowski space dimensions , and @xmath29 is the radius for the fourth space dimension transverse to the d3-branes in the d7-branes . especially , @xmath28 is the inverse of the d3-brane number density and can vary in the space time . in addition , the d - branes have widths along the transverse dimensions which are about @xmath30 from the analysis of tachyon condensation  @xcite",
    ". here , @xmath31 is string length , _",
    "i.e. _ , the square root of the regge slope @xmath32 .",
    "thus , our ansatz for the gauge couplings between the gauge fields on the d7-branes and the nd particles is @xmath33        we denote a generic sm particle as an open string @xmath34 with both ends on the d7-branes . for @xmath35",
    ", we obtain the gauge fields related to the cartan subalgebras of the sm gauge groups , and their supersymmetric partners ( gauginos ) , for example , the photon , @xmath36 gauge boson and the gluons associated with the @xmath37 and @xmath38 gell - mann matrices of the @xmath39 group . for @xmath40 , we obtain the other particles , for example , the electron , neutrinos , and @xmath41 boson , etc . as in fig .",
    "1(a ) , when the open string @xmath42 passes through the d3-brane , it can be split and become two open strings ( corresponding to the nd particles ) @xmath43 and @xmath44 with one end on the d7-brane ( @xmath45 or @xmath46 ) and one end on the d3-brane ( @xmath5 or @xmath47 ) .",
    "then , we can have the two to two process and have two out - going particles arising from the open strings @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "finally , we can have an out - going particle denoted as open string @xmath34 .",
    "in particular , for @xmath35 , we can have @xmath48-channel process at the leading order , and plot it in the fig .",
    "interestingly , the time delays or advances at the leading order arise from the two to two process in the box of fig .",
    "1(a ) , and we plot the corresponding string diagram in fig .",
    "moreover , for @xmath40 , we have time delays or advances at the next to the leading order in fig . 1(a ) .    to calculate the time delays or advances",
    ", we consider the four - fermion scattering amplitude and use the results in ref .",
    "@xcite for simplicity .",
    "we can discuss the other scattering amplitudes similarly , for example , the four - scalar scattering amplitude , and the results are the same .",
    "the total four - fermion scattering amplitude is obtained by summing up the various orderings  @xcite @xmath49 where @xmath50 @xmath51 is the standard four - point ordered scattering amplitude @xmath52 where @xmath53 are the space - time momenta , and we used the sl(2,r ) symmetry to fix three out of the four @xmath54 positions on the boundary of the upper half plane , representing the insertions of the open string vertex fermionic nd operators @xmath55 , @xmath56 , defined appropriately in ref .",
    "@xcite , describing the emission of a massless fermion originating from a string stretched between the d7 brane and the d3 brane .",
    "the amplitudes depend on kinematical invariants expressible in terms of the mandelstam variables : @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 , for which @xmath60 for massless particles . the ordered four - point amplitude @xmath61 is given by  @xcite @xmath62 ^ 2 } \\ , \\times   \\nonumber \\\\   & &   \\left [    { \\bar u}^{(1 ) } \\gamma_{\\mu } u^{(2 ) } { \\bar u}^{(4 ) } \\gamma^{\\mu } u^{(3 ) } ( 1-x ) + { \\bar u}^{(1 ) } \\gamma_{\\mu } u^{(4 ) } { \\bar u}^{(2 ) } \\gamma^{\\mu } u^{(3 ) }   x \\right ] \\",

    "similarly to the discussions in ref .",
    "@xcite , time delays or advances arise from the amplitude @xmath61 by considering backward scattering @xmath74 .",
    "noting that @xmath75 for massless particles , the first term in @xmath61 in eq .",
    "( [ 4ampldetail ] ) for @xmath74 is proportional to @xmath76 it has poles at @xmath77 .",
    "the divergence of the amplitude at the poles is an essential physical feature of the amplitude , a resonance corresponding to the propagation of an intermediate string state over long space - time distances . to define the poles we use the correct @xmath78 prescription with @xmath79",
    "first , we replace @xmath80 , which shift the poles off the real axis .",
    "thus , we obtain @xmath81",
    "so the particle velocity is subluminal . on noting that @xmath82",
    ", we obtain the time delay due to one d3-brane @xmath83 thus , the velocity of the particle is @xmath84 where @xmath85 here , @xmath86 is the string scale .",
    "we emphasize that @xmath28 is the local value around the d3-brane .",
    "second , we consider @xmath87 , which also shift the poles off the real axis .",
    "thus , we obtain @xmath88 interestingly , we obtain the superluminal particle propagation .",
    "the time advance due to one d3-brane is @xmath89 thus , the velocity of the particle is @xmath90 we emphasize that these results on relativistic particle velocities are brand new .",
    "let us discuss the time delays or advances at the leading order for concrete particles .",
    "we will assume that @xmath91 is a small number for a perturbative theory .",
    "then , for the gauge fields and their corresponding gauginos which are related to the cartan subalgebras of the sm gauge groups , all the amplitudes @xmath61 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 will give the dominant contributions to the total amplitude due to @xmath94 .",
    "thus , they will have time delays or advances as given in eq .",
    "( [ t - delay ] ) or ( [ t - adv ] ) , respectively .",
    "the resulting delay or advance for photon is independent of its polarization , and thus there is _ no birefringence _",
    ", thereby leading to the evasion of the relevant stringent astrophysical constraints  @xcite . especially , the photon refractive index is @xmath95 where the corresponding effective quantum gravity scale is @xmath96    however , for all the other sm particles , we have @xmath97 , and then only the amplitude @xmath92 gives dominant contribution .",
    "considering backward scattering  @xcite @xmath74 and @xmath75 , we obtain @xmath98 because they are just the pole terms , we do not have time delays or advances for the other particles with @xmath97 at the leading order , for example , @xmath41 boson , electron , and neutrinos , etc . at the order @xmath70 ( @xmath99 ) , we have time delays or advances for these particles , which arise from the @xmath70 term in eq .",
    "( [ 4ampl ] ) .",
    "thus , we obtain @xmath23 for all the other sm particles as follows @xmath100 in short , the additional contributions to the particle velocity @xmath23 from string theory is proportional to both the particle energy and the d3-brane number density , and is inversely proportional to the string scale .",
    "thus , we can realize the background dependent lorentz violation naturally by varying the d3-brane number density in space time .",
    "in this section , we shall use the background dependent lorentz violation to explain the opera , minos , magic , hess , and fermi experiments simultaneously . in particular , we assume that @xmath28 , which is the inverse of the d3-brane number density , is space - time dependent . for simplicity , we assume that @xmath101 , and we consider the lowest order for time delays or advances , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath102 . to explain the magic , hess , and fermi experiments",
    ", the photons must propagate subluminally . and to explain the opera and minos experiments , the muon neutrinos must propagate superluminally .",
    "therefore , we assume that the muon neutrinos propagate superluminally , while the photons propagate subluminally .",
    "the fundamental explanation on this assumption deserves further study .",
    "the possible reason is the following : photon is a vector boson while muon neutrino is a fermion , and the propagator of a fermion is similar to the square root of the propagator of a boson .",
    "first , let us consider the opera and minos experiments .",
    "we denote the parameters @xmath28 , @xmath70 , and @xmath103 on the earth as @xmath104 , @xmath105 , and @xmath106 , respectively . for simplictiy ,",
    "we choose @xmath107 , and then we have @xmath108 and @xmath109 . using the opera mean muon neutrino energy 17 gev and the central value for @xmath6 , we obtain @xmath110 thus , the physical volume of the three extra dimensions transverse to the d7-branes is very large . because @xmath6 is linearly proportional to the neutrino energy , we emphasize that our result is consistent with the @xmath6 weak dependence on the neutrino energy from the opera experiment .",
    "moreover , we understand that this may be a fruitless exercise , but it is certainly an imagination stretcher and see how far off we can find ourselves in order to explain the opera anomaly .",
    "let us subscribe to the eddington s dictum : `` never believe an experiment until it has been confirmed by theory '' .      because @xmath70 is equal to @xmath116 , our models",
    "can automatically satisfy not only the constraints from the sn1987a observations on neutrinos , but also the following astrophysical constraints on charged leptons :    * the constraint from the crab nebula synchrotron radiation observations on the electron dispersion relation  @xcite . *",
    "the electron vacuum cherenkov radiation via the decay process @xmath117 becomes kinematically allowed for @xmath118 .",
    "note that the cosmic ray electrons have been detected up to 2  tev , we have @xmath119 from cosmic ray experiments  @xcite . *",
    "the high - energy photons are absorbed by cmb photons and annihilate into the electron - positron pairs .",
    "the process @xmath120 becomes kinematically possible for @xmath121 .",
    "because it has been observed to occur for photons with energy about @xmath122  tev , we have @xmath123 from cosmic ray experiments  @xcite . * the process , where a photon decays into @xmath124 , becomes kinematically allowed at energies @xmath125 . as the photons",
    "have been observed up to 50 tev , we have @xmath126 from cosmic ray experiments  @xcite .",
    "the analogous bound for the muon is @xmath127  @xcite .    furthermore , there are possible challenges to our models from the relevant experiments done on the earth .",
    "let us address them in the following :    * the agreement between the observation and the theoretical expectation of electron synchrotron radiation as measured at lep  @xcite gives the bound @xmath128 .",
    "the possible solution is that the vacuum in the lep tunnel is similar to the vacuum on the interstellar scale .",
    "* for the electron neutrinos at the kamland , the non - trivial energy dependence of the neutrino survival probability implies that the lorentz violating off - diagonal elements of the @xmath6 matrix in the flavor space are smaller than about @xmath129  @xcite .",
    "the solution is that our d3-branes are flavour blind .",
    "we revisited the lorentz violation in the type iib string theory with d3-branes and d7-branes .",
    "we studied the relativistic particle velocities in details , and showed that there exist both subluminal and superluminal particle propagations .",
    "in particular , the additional contributions to the particle velocity @xmath23 from string theory is proportional to both the particle energy and the d3-brane number density , and is inversely proportional to the string scale .",
    "thus , we can realize the background dependent lorentz violation naturally by varying the d3-brane number density in the space time . to explain the opera and minos experiments",
