    "darcy law , which is the linear relation between the velocity vector and the pressure gradient , is used to describe fluid flow under low velocity and low porosity conditions , see in @xcite .",
    "it has been observed from many experiments that when the fluid s velocity is high and porosity is nonuniform , the darcy s law becomes inadequate .",
    "consequently , the attention has been attracted to the nonlinear equations for describing of this kind of flow .",

    "this is a nonlinear degenerate system with coefficients depending on the density gradient and degenerating to zero as it approaches to infinity .",
    "the kirchhoff transformation is not applicable for this system . for our degenerate equations ,",
    "we combine the techniques developed in our previous works in @xcite and utilize the special structures of the equations to obtain the stability of the approximated solution and the continuous dependence of the solution on parameters .",
    "the error estimates also derives for the density and momentum .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section  [ intrsec ] , we introduce the notations and the relevant results . in section  [ mfem ] , we defined a numerical approximation using mixed finite element approximations and the implicit backward difference time discretization to the initial boundary value problem ( ivbp )  [ rho : eq ] . in section  [ bsec ]",
