    "the properties of @xmath1-leg quantum spin ladders have attracted considerable recent attention from both theorists and experimentalists @xcite .",
    "the main reasons for this interest are that , like their one - dimensional counterparts , ladders are amenable to approximation schemes such as bosonization , and to accurate numerical investigation by the dmrg method .",
    "it is now well established that the @xmath1-leg heisenberg ladders have the rather striking property of being massive for @xmath1 even and massless for @xmath1 odd .",
    "a number of ladder - like compounds have been found .",
    "for example , the 2-leg ladders @xmath2 @xcite and @xmath3 @xcite exhibit a gap , while the 3-leg ladder @xmath4 @xcite is gapless .",
    "although the heisenberg ladders are not solvable in the sense of the heisenberg spin chain , a number of solvable ladder models are known @xcite .",
    "one 2-leg ladder model with fixed rung , leg and diagonal interactions is equivalent to the xxz chain at @xmath5 and is thus massive @xcite .",
    "another 2-leg model has been constructed which is massless in the absence of rung interactions with a transition to a massive phase at a critical ( non - zero ) value of the rung coupling @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast with the 2-leg heisenberg spin ladder for which the transition to the massive phase is at zero rung coupling . in the integrable model",
    "the heisenberg rung interactions appear as chemical potentials which break the underlying @xmath6 symmetry .",
    "the phase diagram of this model has been established by means of the bethe ansatz solution @xcite .",
    "the integrable model has been generalised to an arbitrary number of legs in which the underlying @xmath7 symmetry is broken by the heisenberg rung interactions , which again appear as chemical potentials in the bethe ansatz solution @xcite .",
    "integrable ladder models with hubbard @xcite and @xmath8 @xcite interactions have also been recently found .",
    "others have been constructed with @xmath9 and @xmath10 symmetry @xcite .",
    "some ladder models have also been constructed with dimer or matrix product ground states @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the thermodynamic properties of the solvable 3-leg qnantum spin tube @xcite .",
    "we consider an integrable 3-leg spin ladder , or spin tube for periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the spins along each leg and each rung have an isotropic heisenberg interaction , with the introduction of many - body terms to retain integrability . as usual , it is convenient to express the hamiltonian in terms of the pauli matrices , @xmath11 the hamiltonian of our model is @xmath12 where , taking the numbering on each elementary triangular plaquette to be @xmath13 , @xmath14 the operators @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 act as the corresponding pauli matrices on the @xmath18th factor in the hilbert space , @xmath19 we take periodic boundary conditions along and also across the ladder .",
    "now we note that @xmath20 is just the permutator on the space @xmath21 and thus that ( [ eq : hleg ] ) is simply the integrable isotropic permutation hamiltonian corresponding to the @xmath0 algebra @xcite . since @xmath22 = 0 $ ] ,",
    "@xmath23 defined in ( [ eq : ham ] ) is also integrable .",
    "we set @xmath24 and @xmath25 , so that we can go from the isotropic tube , @xmath26 , to the ladder , @xmath27 .",
    "this model thus generalizes that given in @xcite to anisotropic rung couplings .",
    "it is convenient to change to the basis where the square and the @xmath28-component of the total spin of a given triangle , @xmath29 are diagonal .",
    "it follows that the eight states on a given triangle fall into a spin-@xmath30 quadruplet and two spin-@xmath31 doublets .",
    "this basis , in terms of the @xmath32 eigenvalues , is , @xmath33 it is emphasized that the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hleg ] ) has the same form on this new basis .",
    "the rung hamiltonian ( [ eq : hrung ] ) now becomes diagonal and is given by @xmath34 .",
    "as claimed above , @xmath23 can be diagonalized using the bethe ansatz .",
    "the bethe ansatz equations are well known @xcite , and given by @xmath35where @xmath36 with @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the eigenenergies of @xmath39 are given by @xmath40 it is important to note that since the permutator ( [ eq : hleg ] ) is invariant under any ordering of the states ( [ eq : basis ] ) , this result may be obtained using any choice of reference state ( or pseudo - vacuum ) @xmath41 and any assignment of bethe ansatz pseudo particles . for each choice",
    "however , one has to re - interpret the numbers @xmath42 in terms of those corresponding to the ordering chosen in ( [ eq : basis ] ) .",
    "the rung hamiltonian does alter with the choice of ordering , but the change is just a rearrangement of its eigenvalues along the diagonal .",
    "we use this property to our advantage by doing calculations with that choice of ordering for which the bethe ansatz reference state is closest to the true ground state of the system .",
    "below we list the six different possibilities corresponding to the choice of ordering of the two doublets and the quadruplet .",
    "* @xmath43 .",
    "+ the bethe ansatz reference state is @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the number of states @xmath46 occuring in an excited state . in the cases below the reference state",
    "is understood to be the tensor product of the first state listed .",
    "* @xmath47 . + now the pseudo particle assignment is given by @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 for @xmath52 .",

    "of course , all of these different choices for the reference state do not change the physics , but it turns out that each of them is convenient in some part of the phase diagram , as we will see in section [ se : phases ] . before calculating the complete phase diagram",
    "we first consider two interesting lines .",
    "due to the extra symmetry in this case , the two doublets become degenerate .",
    "consider now the bethe ansatz where the reference state is the spin up state of either of the spin-@xmath31 doublets . according to case 1 . or 2 . in section",
    "[ se : model ] , the energy is given by @xmath73 where @xmath74 denotes the number of quadruplet excitations .",
    "it is obvious that if @xmath75 is large and positive , no quadruplet state can exist in the ground state .",
    "there are three fermi seas and therefore three gapless excitations .",
    "all flavours of the quadruplet excitations are massive and their gap may be calculated by creating a @xmath76 mode and a @xmath77 hole in the bethe ansatz equation @xcite ( see appendix [ ap : gap ] ) .",
    "the gap is @xmath78 thus we find a phase transiton from @xmath79 to @xmath80 where all quadruplet flavours become massless and there are seven fermi seas and no massive excitations .",
    "note that only at @xmath81 , all fermi seas are completely filled .    considering the case @xmath82 , it is convenient to choose either case 4 . or 5 . of section [",
    "se : model ] .",
    "the energy is given by @xmath83 where now @xmath74 denotes the number of excitations on the spin-@xmath84 ground state .",
    "these excitations are the four flavours belonging to the two spin-@xmath85 states and are all massive for @xmath86 .",
    "we can use the same calculation as above to conclude that again there is a phase transition at @xmath87 where the two spin-@xmath85 doublet excitations become massless .      as above ,",
    "we start by considering this case for @xmath88 .",
    "it is most convenient to take the bethe ansatz as in case 1 . of section [",
    "se : model ] .",
    "the energy is thus given by @xmath89 for @xmath90 it is obvious that @xmath91 for the ground state .",
    "the ground state is thus formed by the @xmath92 doublet and there is one gapless excitation and six massive ones . as before we can calculate the gap by introducing a @xmath93 mode and a @xmath94 hole , giving rise to @xmath95 this gap thus closes at @xmath96 and for @xmath97 there are three massless excitations and four massive ones corresponding to the triplet states .",
    "these become massless at a second critical point , @xmath98 , whose value can not be calculated analytically .",
    "this point continuously connects to the critical point @xmath99 on the line @xmath26 .",
    "as already noted , the different choices of the reference state do not change the physics , but each of them is convenient in some part of the phase diagram . to appreciate this , it is helpful to divide the phase diagram into six regions defined by the lines @xmath81 , @xmath26 and @xmath100 as in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase ] . in each of these regions ,",
    "the corresponding choice of reference state of section [ se : model ] is the most convenient .",
    "* @xmath88 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 . +",
    "this part of the phase diagram contains the ladder for @xmath88 . as in section",
    "[ se : ladder ] we choose to describe the spectrum as in case 1 . of the list in section [",
    "se : model ] .",
    "for @xmath103 it is obvious that for the ground state one must have @xmath91 .",
    "the ground state thus is formed by the doublet @xmath104 , which is effectively a spin-@xmath31 xxx chain .",
    "the system is critical with one massless excitation and six massive ones .",
    "the gap can again be calculated by creating a @xmath93 mode and a @xmath94 hole ( @xmath105 , @xmath106 ) in the bethe ansatz equations , and is given by @xmath107 thus there is a critical line on which this gap vanishes , given by @xmath108 above this line some of the excitations on the @xmath92 doublet become massless .",
    "we now investigate which ones . from the form of the energy it follows that if @xmath109 is large , @xmath110 and only the @xmath111 doublet excitations have become massless .",
    "thus for large @xmath109 and above the critical line ( [ eq:2 + 2to2 ] ) , the ground state is given by the two spin-@xmath31 doublets and the quadruplet excitations are massive . there is another phase transition where also the quadruplet excitations become massless , i.e. @xmath112 for the ground state , and its location on the line ( [ eq:2 + 2to2 ] ) is given by @xmath113 its location changes as @xmath114 increases , which can be calculated using perturbative calculations ( see appendix [ ap : perturb ] ) .",

    "* @xmath88 , @xmath116 and @xmath102 .",
    "+ by the same reasoning as above the ground state is again formed by a doublet for @xmath117 , but now @xmath118 since we use a different reference state .",
    "the system again is critical with one massless excitation and six massive ones .",
    "the gap can be calculated similarly and the critical line on which this gap vanishes is given by @xmath119 below this line the @xmath92 doublet excitations have become massless . there is another phase transition where also the quadruplet excitations become massless , i.e. @xmath120 for the ground state , and its location on the line ( [ eq:2pto2 + 2 ] ) is given by @xmath121 its location changes as @xmath114 increases reaching the previously calculated value , @xmath115 on the line @xmath26 where three fermi seas are completely filled instead of just one . *",

    "in this paper we have calculated the phase diagram of the integrable anisotropic 3-leg quantum spin tube defined in ( [ eq : ham ] ) .",
    "the model differs from the usual heisenberg spin ladder in that it includes additional four- and six - body terms in the leg hamiltonian ( [ eq : hleg ] ) .",
    "the phase diagram , as calculated from the bethe ansatz solution , is given in fig . [",
    "fig : phase ] .",
    "the straight line phase boundaries can be calculated exactly as well as the critical points on the lines where the rung hamiltonian becomes partially degenerate . for the location of the dotted phase boundaries one has to resort to perturbative calculations which show that they end parallel to the degeneracy lines . in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase ] we have sketched the full form of these phase boundaries .",
    "it is to be hoped that their precise location may be accurately determined numerically .",
    "since the model has an odd number of legs , it is critical in the entire phase space and has no true gap .",
    "it is however the simplest example with more than one quantum phase transition for @xmath88 and serves as an example for what to expect for higher leg ladders . in general ,",
    "if the rung hamiltonian has @xmath1 different eigenvalues , one may expect @xmath135 different phase transitions along a generic line between the phase with the lowest and highest total spin . at each of these one",
    "expects to find quantum critical behaviour , which will however diminish in magnitude .",
    "the 3-leg quantum spin tube is also integrable in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "the corresponding 3-leg heisenberg model has been shown to exhibit magnetization plateaus by means of renormalization group calculations based on the bosonized effective continuum theory @xcite .",
    "the exact calculation of the magnetic behaviour of the present model will thus be of considerable interest .",
    "this work has been supported by the australian research council .",
    "as is well known , the bethe ansatz equations ( [ eq : bae ] ) may be written as integral equations in the thermodynamic limit @xmath136 , @xmath137 @xmath138 where @xmath139 are the distributions of bethe ansatz roots and holes and @xmath140 in the sequel we will make use of the following convention for the fourier transform , @xmath141 and of the results , @xmath142    as an example we give here the calculation of the gap for the tube when @xmath143 .",
    "the ground state for @xmath90 consists of three completely filled fermi seas . the bethe ansatz equations ( [ eq : baetherm1 ] ) and ( [ eq : baetherm2 ] )",
    "may therefore be solved with fourier transforms .",
