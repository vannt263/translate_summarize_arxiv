    "vibrational molecular analysis provides important informations on the structure of the molecules .",
    "recently , the development of the powerful experimental techniques which allow the study of highly excited vibrational states @xcite . in born - oppenheimer approximation , electronic , rotational and vibrational quantum states",
    "@xcite can be considered separately and molecular vibrations can are approximately described by the harmonic oscillator @xcite",
    ". however , this model fails to describe the highest molecular vibrational modes and consequently to provide the correct dissociation energies .",
    "one of the first attempts to improve these approximations is due to morse @xcite who introduced a simple potential which allows to solve exactly the schrdinger equation ( se ) and provides a reasonably approximation to the spectrum of diatomic molecules , including an upper bound which lacks in the harmonic oscillator potential .",
    "later on , many other approximations based on the use of morse - like , kratzer - like or modified versions of these or other potential functions have been introduced in order to obtain better fittings with experimental data @xcite and for evaluating dissociation energies @xcite .",
    "although _ ab initio _ methods have shown to be able to provide good approximations for the spectra of many molecules , some authors have pointed out some of their limitations .",
    "@xcite , noted that the morse potential contains only quadratic corrections and one needs to use the empirical dunham expansion to fit the highest vibrational energies .",
    "iachello and levine @xcite , remarked that the solution of the se is very difficult in the case of two- and three- dimensions and , at this point , algebraic methods could bring some advantages .",
    "problems related to the dissociation energy estimation and also a algebraic energy method to calculate it , were described by sun _",
    "_ @xcite . nevertheless , besides the facts above mentioned , there are still some molecules whose potentials deviate strongly from morse - like potentials @xcite .",
    "the algebraic approach to the study of molecular vibrational and rotational spectra was pioneered by f. iachello in @xcite ( for a recent review see @xcite ) .",
    "the method has been proved to be useful for calculating accurately highly excited vibrational levels and for describing the whole spectrum of complex molecules , while maintaining its simplicity in cases where the use of _ ab initio _ methods are not feasible in practice @xcite .",
    "deformed heisenberg algebras ( dha or q - oscillators ) have attracted considerable attention since they have been proposed @xcite , due mainly to their potential physical applications @xcite ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "they are non - trivial generalizations of the heisenberg algebras characterized by the deformation parameter @xmath0 .",
    "it is interesting to notice that for some values of the @xmath0-deformation parameter , namely for @xmath1 , the energy spectrum associated with the deformed heisenberg algebras presents an upper bound , as in fact occurs in systems like composite particles @xcite , as for instance , diatomic molecules @xcite . within this formalism @xmath0-oscillators",
    "are used as a model of anharmonic oscillators , and the value of @xmath0 is chosen to reproduce experimental molecular vibrational spectra . when compared with other methods ,",
    "the dha approach requires only a few parameters , allows analytical expressions and fits well the first experimental levels .",
    "however , as it will become clear later , it does not provide always the correct dissociation energy because it may fail to fit the highest vibrational levels . recently",
    ", many authors have discussed the physical interpretation of this parameter @xcite but this analysis is out of the scope of this work .",
    "recently , a generalized heisenberg algebra ( gha ) , where the commutation relations among the operators depend on a characteristic function of the generalized number operator has been proposed @xcite . if the characteristic function is linear , with slope @xmath2 , the algebra corresponds to the @xmath0-oscillator algebra . in the present work",
    "we introduce and implement a nonlinear gha which is able to describe typical features of the vibrational molecular spectrum of the carbon monoxide molecule ( @xmath3 ) . the spectrum generated by this nonlinear gha ( nl - gha )",
    "allows us to fit the @xmath4 first vibrational transitions and to obtain the correct dissociation energy , providing better global results than the methods above mentioned .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sessao2 ]",
    "we discuss the solution of the schroedinger equation ( se ) with morse potential . in section 3",
    "we introduce the gha method . in section 4",
    "we apply our gha model to the @xmath3 molecule .",
    "finally , section 5 is devoted to discussions and conclusions .",
    "let us now turn our attention to one of the most familiar quantum descriptions of diatomic molecules . for low energy levels ,",
    "the molecular potential can be approximated by the harmonic potential , whereas for high energy this approximation breaks down .",
    "in fact , the higher vibrational transitions exhibit a certain degree of anharmonicity .",
    "thus , to take into account anharmonic terms and rotational effects , nonlinear terms must be introduced in the energy expression @xcite : @xmath5^m,\\ ] ] where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the vibrational and the rotational quantum numbers , respectively .",
    "the above expression was obtained by dunhan , using the wkb method @xcite .    an analytical solution for the se , which corresponds to the second order truncation of the equation ( [ eq:11 ] ) with @xmath8 ,",
    "was obtained by morse @xcite using the so - called morse potential ( see figure [ morsepot ] ) : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a characteristic constant of each molecule , @xmath11 is the nuclear distance , @xmath12 is the equilibrium position and @xmath13 is the dissociation energy .",
    "the solution of the se for this potential gives the following expression for the vibrational energy @xmath14,\\ , ( \\nu=0,1, ... ,\\frac{k-1}{2 } ) , \\ ] ] where @xmath15 is a positive constant called the anharmonicity coefficient , @xmath16 is the fundamental frequency , @xmath6 is the vibrational quantum number and @xmath17 .",
    "the anharmonicity coefficient is related to the dissociation energy by , @xmath18    the energy levels obtained agree reasonably well with experimental data for many molecules @xcite .",
    "the maximum allowed value of @xmath19 in equation ( [ eq:13 ] ) is such that the se solution remains finite .",
    "one can also show that this value is given by @xmath20 hence , there is maximum energy value @xmath21 beyond which the system is not bounded .    in order to improve the morse results , several perturbative methods , based on the morse or other analytical or numerical potential , have been proposed .",
    "huffaker @xcite , used a perturbed morse model to calculate the first terms of the dunhan expansion ( [ eq:11 ] ) for the @xmath3 molecule .",
    "he used a potential given by following expression , @xmath22 \\",

    "this model is good when compared with the model obtained via rkr method by mantz _",
    "if one ignores the rotational degree of freedom ( @xmath25 ) , the model has @xmath26 parameters .",
    "in @xcite curado e rego - monteiro proposed an algebra called gha which is generated by three operators @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , satisfying the following relations : @xmath30 & = & f(j_0)-j_0 ,   \\label{eq:3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the hermitian conjugate , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 is an analytical function of @xmath27 , called the characteristic function .",
    "assuming the existence of a vacuum state represented by @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) , it can be shown that @xmath37 where @xmath38 , @xmath39 is the lowest @xmath27 eigenvalue and @xmath40 is the @xmath41-th iteration of the function @xmath42 .",
    "this algebra describes a class of heisenberg - like algebras of quantum systems , having energy eigenvalues given by @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are two successive eigenvalues and are related with the energy for the system @xcite .",
    "therefore , the @xmath27 eigenvalues can be obtained iteratively and they can be upper bounded or not , depending on the chracteristic function , the values of the function parameters and the initial value @xmath39 . for each kind of function ,",
    "the values of the parameters and the initial values determine the existence or not of the fixed points , @xmath46 @xcite , and their stability . as a consequence ,",
    "different spectra are obtained for different functions and the eigenvalues behavior can be analyzed using dynamical systems techniques . for the linear case , @xmath47 ,",

    ". equations ( [ eq:8]-[eq:10 ] ) describe the one - parameter gha studied in @xcite and can be mapped into the @xmath0-oscillator algebra . if @xmath51 , the standard heisenberg algebra is recovered .",
    "a graphical analysis of the functions @xmath52 and @xmath53 is shown in figure [ ga ] .",
    "the intersection between the two lines is identified as the fixed point of the recurrence equation @xmath54 .",
    "the most interesting cases are obtained for @xmath55 and @xmath56 , since under these conditions the energy spectrum has an upper bound @xmath57 , as observed in the spectra of bounded systems , as for instance diatomic molecules @xcite .",
    "we will now study the spectrum generated by the linear gha mentioned above , which correspond to the @xmath0-oscillator algebra . to study the vibrational spectrum of diatomic molecules via gha formalism",
    ", we use a result developed in @xcite .",
    "let us start with the general hamiltonian @xmath58 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 obey the relations ( [ eq:1]-[eq:3 ] ) and @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 are real numbers .",

    "after some algebra we obtain @xmath73 with @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "the maximum energy ( @xmath76 ) for this system is given by @xmath77 , and the dissociation energy is then @xmath78 the @xmath79parameter can be interpreted as being related to the anharmonicity constant , @xmath80 , where @xmath81 @xcite .",
    "we will now apply the previous results to the carbon monoxide molecule spectrum and compare it with both experimental data and the spectra obtained by using the morse , the perturbed morse and the @xmath0-oscillator models .",
    "we used the data provided by the hitran database @xcite and chose the lines in which the molecules are in the electronic fundamental state . also , we selected the lines whose rotational quantum numbers are zero .",
    "thus , there remained the spectral lines which represent the first @xmath82 pure vibrational transitions of the @xmath3 molecule .    in order to fit the parameters ( @xmath0 and @xmath39 ) to the experimental data , note",
    "that the logarithm of the difference between two successive levels of the equation ( [ eq:14 - 0 ] ) , as a function of @xmath6 , is a straight line with slope @xmath83 . taking the logarithm of the difference between two successive data points , we obtain the value of @xmath0 by evaluating the slope of the curve after a linear regression .",
    "the fitted parameters are shown in table ( [ t1 ] ) .",
    "the linear gha spectrum agrees well with the experimental data ( see table ( [ t2 ] ) and figure ( [ error ] ) ) mainly in the case of the @xmath4 first vibrational transitions .",
    "however , the @xmath13 value calculated by equation ( [ eq:14 ] ) deviate strongly from the experimental value as can be seen in table ( [ t0 ] ) .",
    "this means that , although the @xmath0-oscillator relative errors ( @xmath84 ) are smaller than the relatives error obtained by morse model , for most of the 20 first vibrational transition ( figure ( [ error ] ) ) , the approach based on the @xmath0-oscillator is not able to fit higher frequency vibrational levels .      as we have seen above , the linear gha ( _ i.e. _ the q - oscillator ) , is a good model only for the first levels . in order to fit the energy levels and to obtain the correct dissociation energy we were led to use a nonlinear functional @xmath85 in the gha approach ( [ eq:1]-[eq:3 ] ) .",
    "we found that , by using the functional @xmath86 it is possible to obtain a good fit with the experimental data and the correct dissociation energy .",
    "due its nonlinearity , the spectrum generated by this nonlinear gha does not have an analytical closed expression like equation ( [ eq:14 - 0 ] ) . in this case",
    "the spectrum can only be calculated numerically .    for the sake of simplicity , we start from the hamiltonian @xmath87 which is derived from hamiltonian ( [ eq:13c ] ) with @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 . replacing @xmath34 given by equation ( [ eq:14a ] ) in relations ( [ eq:1]-[eq:3 ] ) and applying @xmath91 on the eigenstates of @xmath27 ( with @xmath69 )",
    "we obtain @xmath92 where @xmath93 is given by : @xmath94 we use the values generated by equation ( [ eq:14a2 ] ) with @xmath95 given by equation ( [ eq:16 ] ) in order to fit the @xmath0 , @xmath96 and @xmath39 parameters with the experimental data .",
    "the dissociation energy is given by @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the stable fixed point of the recurrence equation ( [ eq:16 ] ) .",
    "the fitted parameters are shown in table ( [ t1 ] ) .",
    "the dissociation energy are shown in table ( [ t0 ] ) . in table",
    "( [ t2 ] ) we compare the energy levels obtained with the different models referred in this work with experimental data .",
    "the relative errors are shown in the figure ( [ error ] ) .",
    "we can see that the nonlinear gha with the functional ( [ eq:14a ] ) provides better fittings with experimental data than both q - oscillator and morse models and it is comparable to the huffaker model @xcite .",
    "furthermore , nonlinear gha provides a more accurate dissociation energy when compared with that obtained in all other methods .",
    "this results show that our model is a good method of obtaining the higher anharmonic energy levels of the @xmath3 molecule .    as the @xmath96 parameter is very small ( table ( [ t1 ] ) ) , if @xmath39 is also small , the first iterations of the equation ( [ eq:16 ] ) are dominated by the linear term .",
    "the nonlinear term becomes relevant as the number of iterations increase .",
    "the difference between two successive energy levels decreases up to zero as the function ( [ eq:16 ] ) is iterated .",
    "because the @xmath96 parameter is negative , the difference between two successive energy levels tends to zero .",
    "thus , the nonlinear term flats the energy curve faster than in the pure linear and the perturbed morse cases but slightly slower than the morse model , as we can see in the figure ( [ energy ] )",
    ".    we would like to stress that besides these accurate fittings , the nonlinear gha gives us an extremely simple way to estimate higher transitions for the @xmath3 molecule , just by iterating equation ( [ eq:16 ] ) up to the required level .",
    "in this work we have proposed a method based on gha to reproduce the vibrational molecular spectrum of diatomic molecules . for the @xmath3 molecule",
    ", we have shown that the previous method based on the @xmath0-oscillator algebra ( linear gha ) reproduce the vibrational molecular spectrum for the @xmath4 first vibrational transitions , but it does not provide the correct dissociation energy , _",
    "i.e. _ , this model fails when describing higher vibrational levels . using a nonlinear functional ( @xmath99 order ) in the gha we were able to fit the experimental energy levels and also to calculate the dissociation energy for the @xmath3 molecule with good accuracy . for this molecule",
    "the nonlinear gha has provided better global results than the usual morse , perturbed morse models and @xmath0-oscillator model .",
    "this work shows that gha can be used as a phenomenological simple tool to study composite particles .",
    "gha produces different spectra for different characteristic functions .",
    "the gha spectrum could be related to deformations in harmonic potential .",
    "indeed , this algebra could reproduce a variety of spectra once we are able to find the appropriate characteristic function .",
    "consequently , this algebra could be used to study other molecules , simply choosing the appropriate characteristic function . in an even more general fashion ,",
    "de souza _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have constructed a more general structure that depends on two functionals .",
    "this new algebraic structure can reproduce a even greater variety of spectra allowing us to work with two quantum numbers .",
