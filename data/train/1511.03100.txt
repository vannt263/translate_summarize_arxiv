    "the problem though , is shown to be polynomial time solvable for constant capacity functions by a dynamic programming approach . however , even for constant functions , the linear programming problem of maximizing the value of the multiflow over the system of linear inequalities ( [ eq : flowcapacity ] ) has not even , in general , half - integral optimal solutions . in @xcite , the np - completeness of the edge  disjoint  multi commodity path problem for series  parallel graph ( and partial 2trees ) has been established while , previously in @xcite , the polynomial time solvability of the same problem for partial 2trees was proved under some restriction either on the number of the commodities ( required to be a logarithmic function of the order of the graph ) or on the location of the nets .",
