    "the design and the analysis of caching systems , a very traditional and widely studied topic in computer science , has recently drawn again attention by the networking research community .",
    "this interest revival is mainly due to the important role that caches play today in the distribution of contents over the internet .",
    "massive content delivery networks , indeed , represent the standard solution adopted by content and network providers to reach large populations of geographically distributed users in an effective way .",
    "mcdn allow providers to cache contents close to the users , achieving the twofold goal of reducing network traffic while minimizing the latency suffered by users .",
    "unfortunately , the performance evaluation of caching systems is very hard , as the computational cost to analyze the behavior of a cache is exponential in both the cache size and the number of contents  @xcite .",
    "for this reason , the effort of the research community has mainly focused on the development of accurate and computationally efficient approximate techniques for the analysis of caching systems , under various traffic conditions .",
    "che s approximation @xcite , proposed for the analysis of least recently used ( lru ) caches under the independent reference model ( irm ) , has emerged as one of the most powerful methods to obtain accurate estimates of the  hit \" probability at limited computational costs @xcite .",
    "the main idea of this technique is to summarize the response of a cache to the requests arriving for any possible content by a single primitive quantity , which is assumed to be deterministic and the same for any content .",
    "this approximation simplifies the analysis of caching systems because it allows to decouple the dynamics of different contents . in  @xcite che",
    "s approximation for lru caches under the irm found a theoretical justification . in this paper",
    "we extend the mathematical analysis of che s approximation to lru caches operating under the shot noise model ( snm )  @xcite .",
    "this model provides a simple , flexible and accurate description of the temporal locality found e.g. in video on demand ( vod ) traffic , capturing today traffic characteristics in a more natural and precise way than traditional traffic models .",
    "inspired by the seminal paper @xcite , we investigate the validity of che s approximation by means of an asymptotic analysis of the cache eviction time .",
    "specifically , we provide a large deviation principle , a law of large numbers and a central limit theorem for the cache eviction time , as the cache size grows large .",
    "furthermore , to the best of our knowledge , we give for the first time a non - asymptotic analytical upper bound for the error estimate of the  hit `` probability entailed by che s approximation .",
    "we provide also upper and lower bounds for the  hit '' probability , under che s approximation , for a tandem network of caches . finally , we present some numerical illustrations .",
    "our results show that che s approximation is a provable , highly accurate and scalable tool to assess the performance of lru caching systems under the snm .",
    "we consider a cache , whose size ( or capacity ) , expressed in number of objects ( or contents ) , is denoted by @xmath0 .",
    "the cache is fed by an exogenous arrival process of objects requests generated by users .",
    "requests which find the object in the cache are said to produce a  hit `` , whereas requests that do not find the object in the cache are said to produce a ' ' miss \" .",
    "an important performance index is the  hit \" probability , which is the fraction of the requests producing a  hit \" .",
    "the miss stream of a cache , i.e. the process of requests which are not locally satisfied by the cache , is forwarded to either other caches or to a common repository containing all the objects , i.e. the entire objects catalogue . in the literature",
    "it is common to neglect all propagation delays . in this paper",
    "we focus on caches implementing the lru policy : upon the arrival of a request , an object not already stored in the cache is inserted into it . if the cache is full , to make room for a new object the least recently used item is evicted , i.e. the object which has not been requested for the longest time is expunged from the cache .",
    "several models have been proposed to describe the process of requests arriving at a cache .",
    "the simplest and still the most widely adopted is certainly the irm  @xcite , which makes the following two fundamental assumptions : @xmath1 the catalogue consists of a fixed number of objects , which does not change over the time ; @xmath2 the process of requests of a given object is modeled by a homogeneous poisson process . as a consequence , the irm completely ignores all temporal correlations in the sequence of requests and does not take into account a key feature of real traffic referred to as temporal locality , which means that if an object is requested at a given time , then it is more likely that the same object will be requested again in the near future .",
    "it is well - known that the temporal locality has a beneficial effect on the cache performance , as it increases the  hit \" probability  @xcite .",
    "several extensions of the irm have been proposed to incorporate the temporal locality into the traffic model .",
    "existing generalizations @xcite typically assume that the process of requests is time - stationary , usually either a renewal process or a markov modulated poisson process .",
    "however , these models do not capture the kind of temporal locality encountered in traces related to video on demand ( vod ) traffic , which is instead well described by the snm as shown in @xcite .",
    "the basic idea of the snm is to represent the requests process as the superposition of many independent processes , each one referring to a specific object .",
    "the requests process of a fixed content @xmath3 is specified by two physical ( random ) parameters : @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath4 represents the time instant at which the content enters the system ( i.e. it becomes available to the users ) ; mark @xmath5 describes some attribute of the content @xmath3 , which summarizes its main characteristics ( content type , volume , etc . ) .",
    "we assume that the set of times @xmath6 at which contents become available to users ( i.e. , they are introduced in the common repository ) is distributed according to a homogeneous poisson process on @xmath7 with intensity @xmath8 .",
    "here , @xmath9 is supposed to be an unordered set of times . we suppose that",
    ", after the introduction into the catalogue of the content @xmath3 , the requests for this content arrive at the cache according to a cox process @xmath10 on @xmath7 whose stochastic intensity @xmath11 is defined by @xmath12 see e.g. @xcite .",
    "we assume that @xmath13 is a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables , independent of @xmath9 , with values on some measurable space @xmath14 .",
    "furthermore , we suppose that @xmath15 is a measurable non - negative function such that @xmath16 for any @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "finally , we suppose that , for any @xmath19 , @xmath20 almost surely and we assume that the cox processes @xmath21 are independent , given @xmath22 .",
    "we denote by @xmath23 a tagged content introduced into the catalogue at the deterministic time @xmath24 , @xmath25 .",
    "moreover , we denote by @xmath26 , @xmath27 , the number of contents different from @xmath23 that have been requested in the time interval @xmath28 $ ] , i.e. @xmath29,\\,\\xi_m\\in ( -\\infty , t]\\}.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] throughout this paper we shall consider the random variable @xmath30 which plays an important role in the dynamics of an lru cache because the cache eviction time may be expressed in terms of @xmath31 .",
