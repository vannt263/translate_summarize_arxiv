    "is positive , the amplitudes of covariant loop quantum gravity are finite @xcite",
    ". the issue of large - spin divergences for vanishing @xmath0 may then seem devoid of physical interest .",
    "it is not so , since , due to the size of @xmath0 , radiative corrections can still be large , jeopardizing the regime of validity of the expansion that defines the theory @xcite . ] here we present some indirect evidence that these three issues might be strictly related . while the relation between divergences and gauge has been pointed out @xcite , the connection with orientation is , as far as we know , new .    in particular , we present some indirect evidence that spinfoam divergences may be generated by the presence of the two terms of opposite orientation in the asymptotic expansion of the vertex amplitude .",
    "pictorially , divergences are generated by geometrical  spikes \" where one of the simplices of the spike has orientation opposite to the rest of the geometry .",
    "opposite orientation can be related to time ( or parity)-inversion @xcite in the lorentzian theory , hence divergences , or , more precisely , large radiative corrections , might come from large fluctuations of the geometry  back and forth in time \" .    to illustrate the point ,",
    "let us start from a puzzle .",
    "let @xmath1 be the triangulation obtained by splitting a single tetrahedron @xmath2 into four tetrahedra via a 1 - 4 pachner move , namely by adding a point @xmath3 connected to all the vertices of @xmath2 , as in figure [ f1 ] .",
    "the ponzano - regge amplitude associated to this triangulation is well known to diverge @xcite .",
    "this divergence has been associated to the invariance of the amplitude under translations of the point @xmath3 in the 3d hyperplane defined by the tetrahedron .",
    "indeed , in the asymptotic expansion of the vertex , the amplitude is determined by the regge action , and the regge action is invariant under an infinitesimal 3d translation of the point @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "one is therefore led to identify the divergence with the existence of the gauge orbit generated by moving @xmath3 in the hyperplane defined by @xmath2 .",
    ".,height=151 ]    however , the regge action is invariant in this way only as long as the point @xmath3 is _ inside _ @xmath2 .",
    "below we explicitly illustrate this point , perhaps under - appreciated , discussing the geometry of regge calculus . if the invariance is limited to translations of @xmath3 within @xmath2 , which is compact ,",
    "how come the amplitude diverges ?",
    "we suggest here that the answer lies in the fact that the asymptotic limit of the ponzano - regge amplitude is not the exponential of the regge action , but rather the sum of two exponentials of the regge action , taken with _",
    "certain _ flipped signs . with flipped signs ,",
    "the invariant contribution comes when @xmath3 is outside @xmath2 . in other words ,",
    "the divergence is strictly dependent on the existence of the second term in the expansion of the vertex amplitude .",
    "the geometrical origin of this second term can be traced to the fact that the asymptotic limit of the ponzano - regge model is not truly 3d general relativity in metric variables , but rather 3d general relativity in triad variables , with an action that flips sign under reversal of the orientation of the triad @xcite . in three dimensions , it is this action ( and not metric general relativity ) which is equivalent to @xmath4 theory . in turn , @xmath4 theory has an additional gauge symmetry with respect to general relativity : the shift @xmath5 ( where @xmath6 is the connection variable : @xmath7 ) , which can be shown to be related to the displacement of @xmath3 all over the hyperplane @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we present two arguments that provide some ground for these intuitions .",
    "first , we observe that the only classical solutions of regge theory on the triangulation @xmath1 are those where @xmath3 lies inside @xmath2 while in the presence of the flipped - orientation term in the action , there are also classical solutions with @xmath3 outside @xmath2 .",
    "second , and more specifically , we study in some detail a simplified form of the asymptotic approximation of the sum that defines the divergence . as will be discussed in more detail , the simplifications consist in trivializing the integration measure and in cutting away a region of the integration domain which is more complicated to control since it does not admit a 4d geometrical embedding .",
    "such simplifications define a quantum regge calculus for the regge triangulation @xmath1 .",
    "we show that the corresponding amplitude does not diverge if we take only the regge term , and diverges if we include the flipped - oriented term .",
    "this is the main technical result of the paper and comes a bit as a surprise , given the intuition that quantum regge calculus diverges because of the  spikes \" .",
    "here we show that crucial spikes at the root of the divergences are those formed by ",
    "anti - spacetimes \" , in the language of @xcite .",
    "these do not exist in conventional regge calculus .",
    "the relevance of these observations for the physical four - dimensional quantum gravity is far from granted , but it is suggestive . looking ahead , we do not think that the moral of our results is that the quantum theory of gravity should be formulated by dropping the flipped term contributions to the dynamics @xcite .",
    "rather , it should be better understood what kind of relation exists among  flipped - orientation \" ( or  anti - spacetime \" ) quantum fluctuations of the geometry , gauge - invariance , and radiative corrections .    the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we start by illustrating the geometry of the spikes in regge calculus in 2d and in 3d in section [ secii ] . in section [ seciii ]",
    ", we discuss the ponzano - regge model and its large spin limit , and in section [ secsadd ] we show how the flipped - orientation terms in the action give rise to new classical solutions , with @xmath3 outside @xmath2 . in section",
    "[ bound ] , we define the ( simplified ) integrals corresponding to the amplitudes in a quantum regge calculus with and without the flipped terms and show that the second amplitude is bounded , while the second is not .",
    "finally we conclude in section [ secconc ] .",
    "we start with an illustration of the geometry of the spikes in 2d and 3d regge calculus , as this is sometimes a source of confusion . we will deal with spikes which can be embedded in one more dimension ( i.e. in 3d and 4d respectively ) .",
    "remark that this is not the most general possible spike ( see section [ bound ] for more details ) .",
    "consider the 2d plane @xmath8 immersed in 3d euclidean space with coordinates @xmath9 .",
    "consider a triangulation of this plane , containing a triangle @xmath2 , whose sides have lengths @xmath10 . pick a point @xmath3 in @xmath11 at a distance @xmath12 from the vertices of @xmath2 . by joining @xmath3 with the three vertices of @xmath2",
    ", we obtain three triangles @xmath13 , each determined by @xmath3 and one of the three sides of @xmath2 .",
    "the 1 - 3 pachner move @xmath14 modifies the original ( flat ) triangulation into a triangulation which is in general curved . in particular , there is discrete ( distributional ) curvature at @xmath3 , given by the deficit angle _ p:=2-_a_a , where @xmath15 is the angle at @xmath3 of the triangle @xmath13.switching for the moment to a more general notation : the angle @xmath16 between the two sides @xmath17 and @xmath18 of a triangle with sides @xmath19 is given by : = _ pq .

    "a moment of reflection shows that in this case the curvature does _ not _ vanish .",
    "this can be seen for instance rather simply using continuity : consider a situation where the three lengths @xmath12 are large compared to the size of @xmath2 .",
    "then each of the three angles @xmath15 is small , and the deficit angle is near @xmath21 .",
    "if we move @xmath3 continuously toward the plane @xmath8 ( but still far from @xmath2 ) , the three angles remain small and @xmath20 remains near @xmath21 . on @xmath8 , one of the three angles ,",
    "say @xmath22 , will become equal to the sum of the other two ( see right side of figure [ tri ] ) , but this does not change the fact that the curvature at @xmath3 is high .",
    "it is important to observe that the topology of the triangulation is not affected by this degenerate case .",
    "the degeneracy is in the embedding of the 2d triangulated surface into @xmath11 , not in the topology of the triangulation , which is determined by its intrinsic geometry and which remains @xmath23 .",
    "confusing the intrinsic topology of the 2d triangulation with that induced by its embedding in @xmath11 is the source of the misleading intuition that the triangulation with @xmath3 in the plane but outside @xmath2 is flat .",
    "the only part of the plane where the curvature is constant is the interior of @xmath2 .",

    "inside @xmath2.,height=170 ]    again , the deficit angle is a well - defined continuous function of the position of @xmath3 in @xmath27 .",
    "it vanishes if @xmath3 lies in @xmath2 ( figure [ f3 ] ) and becomes non zero when @xmath3 is taken perpendicularly away from @xmath2 in @xmath27 ( figure [ ch1 ] ) . therefore if @xmath3 lies in @xmath2 and we consider infinitesimal shifts in its position , there are three directions that do not change the curvature , and one that does .",
    "now , what is the value of the curvature if @xmath3 lies in the hyperplane @xmath24 , but outside @xmath2 ?",
    "as before , in this case the curvature does _ not _ vanish . as in the two dimensional case ,",
    "this can be shown by continuity .",
    "however the argument is more subtle , since the dihedral angles do not necessarily go to zero as @xmath3 goes to infinity ; nevertheless , as it will be shown in section [ bound ] , in this limit the sum of the three dihedral angles associated to the edges @xmath35 and @xmath36 of the tetrahedron @xmath13 goes to @xmath37 ; thus , the sum of all twelve such dihedral angles is @xmath38 , and not @xmath39 ( a full turn for each internal edge of the triangulation ) as one would expect for the flat case .",
    "therefore , this configuration represents necessarily a curved regge geometry .",
    "if we now move continuously @xmath3 into the plane @xmath24 , the previous argument continues to hold .",
    "when @xmath24 , one of the three dihedral angles becomes equal to the sum of the other two dihedral angles relative to the same edge ( see figure [ ch1 ] ) ; nevertheless , this does not change the fact that the curvature is non - zero .",

    "this divergence goes like @xmath52 , suggesting that it is related to a 3d volume divergence .",
    "it is tempting to relate it to the invariance of the regge amplitude under shifts of the point @xmath3 in the 3d hyperplane of the tetrahedron @xmath2 .",
    "indeed , the divergence comes obviously from the large @xmath12 s region , where we can use the asymptotic value for the wigner 6-@xmath47 symbols : s go to infinity _ uniformly _ , the boundary spins @xmath53 included . ]    \\ { 6j } ~(_f_f j_f+4 ) , where @xmath54 is the external dihedral angle at the edge @xmath42 of a tetrahedron having sides with lengths @xmath55 , and @xmath56 is the volume of this tetrahedron .",

    "the asymptotic form can be best understood by drawing a tetrahedron , adding a fifth vertex @xmath3 in @xmath27 and pulling it to infinity ( figure [ asyfig ] ) .     above ) becomes @xmath37 .",

    "clearly , the same statement , just transposed into one less dimension , holds also for all the tetrahedra formed by the point @xmath3 and one of the faces of the original tetrahedron .",
    "in such a configuration the sum of the internal dihedral angles belonging to one of these `` stretched out '' tetrahedra will go to @xmath37 when @xmath3 approaches infinity : _ ba _ b^a .",
    "moreover , if @xmath3 approaches infinity at angles @xmath143 fixed and @xmath144 , it is clear that all four edge lengths scale as @xmath145 .",

    "is that the previous integral is bounded independently on the size of the regge spike in @xmath27 .",

    "any possible divergence arising in this integral comes from very large @xmath138 s ; therefore in looking for divergences we can expand the integrand for @xmath170 ; in doing this , we get @xmath171 .    \\label{reggdiv}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the above integrand clearly has a linear and a logarithmic divergence when integrated over @xmath138 up to infinity , which are given by its first two terms respectively , while its remainder is convergent .",
    "correction to the measure - see footnote [ foot ] - can possibly contribute to the logarithmic divergence .",
    "] therefore , the integral @xmath158 is in fact divergent , as a consequence of the sign flip .",
    "we have pointed out that if we consider the triangulation @xmath58 obtained by adding a point @xmath3 to a tetrahedron @xmath2 , as a regge geometry , the only flat configurations are those where @xmath3 is _ inside _ the boundary of the tetrahedron @xmath2 ; these flat solutions are all gauge equivalent .",
    "any other configuration of @xmath58 , where the point @xmath3 is _ outside _ @xmath2 , is _ not _ flat and carries curvature , depending on the position of the point @xmath3 .",
    "the ponzano - regge amplitude of the triangulation defined by @xmath58 is well - known to diverge . in the spin representation",
    "such divergence scales like @xmath52 in the cut - off spin .",
    "we have analysed the ponzano - regge model in its large @xmath47 limit , where the 6-@xmath47 symbol is known to behave like the cosine of the regge action ( plus a phase irrelevant here ) multiplied by some ( crucial ) signs . since @xmath58",
    "is composed by four tetrahedra @xmath13 , the full amplitude is given by the sum of 16 terms .",
    "each of these can be approximated by a path integral whose action @xmath75 is - loosely speaking - given by the sum of plus or minus the regge action for each of the four @xmath13 s .",
    "we analysed the classical equation of motion ( i.e. the saddle points of the path integral at large @xmath47 s ) for each @xmath75 and found that there are two main classes of solutions , where the point @xmath3 lies respectively inside or outside @xmath2 . in the first case",
    "these are solutions of the @xmath172 $ ] action , and are flat and gauge equivalent ( in the regge geometry sense ) ; they form a compact set in the space of the edge - lengths .",
    "in contrast , if @xmath3 lies outside @xmath2 , these are solutions of one of the @xmath173-like actions and encode a set of curved , non - gauge - equivalent regge geometries ; they form a non - compact set in the space of the edge - lengths .",
    "having found two sets of saddle points for the ponzano - regge amplitude of @xmath58 , we then wanted to explicitly evaluate the path integral of its different terms , to see which ones are at the origin of the divergence and to check if there was any correlation between their divergences and their sets of saddle points .    to be able to evaluate these integrals we had to considerably simplify them .",
    "the simplifications consist in trivializing the path integral measure @xmath122=\\left[\\prod_a\\frac{2l_a+1}{(12\\pi v_a)^{1/2}}\\right ] d^4 l_a\\to d^4 l_a$ ] , as well as in restricting the integration domain to those edge lengths which have an embedding in @xmath27 .",
    "we hence showed that the only divergent path integral is the one related to the @xmath173-like actions .",
    "its divergence is linear in the edge - length scale , and not cubic .",
    "the discrepancy with the ponzano - regge result can be traced to the use of a different measure .",
    "in fact each of the @xmath174 factors would take into another @xmath175 factor , while each volume another @xmath176 factor .",
    "fixed , and letting the point @xmath3 go to infinity , one gets a volume that scales like the @xmath118 s ( at given @xmath136 s ) . ]",
    "the total degree of divergence would hence be @xmath177 .",
    "unluckily , restoring the original measure entails many complications , which could eventually spoil our result .",
    "are such that ( at least ) one of the @xmath59 is zero .",
    "if this sector is a source of new divergences depends on the details of the integrand .",
    "however , remark that discarding this sector and doing the same kind of estimation for the @xmath87 amplitude , we would find that it does diverge , but with a degree of divergence not larger than 1 : the @xmath87 contribution to the total degree of divergence would therefore be subleading . ] despite of this , we think that this calculation can teach us something about the divergences : in fact it shows explicitly , even if in the context of a slightly artificial variation of the ponzano - regge model , how the presence of the two signs in the asymptotics can be ( one of the ) sources of divergences in the large @xmath47 regime .",
    "these observations are relevant because several spinfoam theories , and in particular lorentzian loop quantum gravity in four dimensions @xcite , contain the same two terms in the asymptotic expansion of the vertex .",
    "this work is in a context of general effort to understand the possible implications of the presence of these two terms .",

    "the latter two functions approach monotonically zero for @xmath138 larger than a certain value ( which depends on the @xmath136 s ) , just by the fact that @xmath150 is an analytic function of @xmath138 whose limit is zero when @xmath138 goes to infinity . by dirichlet s test ( see appendix [ appb ] for a reminder ) it is immediate to see that each of these terms converge for any @xmath136 s when @xmath156 goes to infinity .",
