    "the realization of bec in ultracold atomic gases [ 1 - 3 ] has opened a wide area of research in atomic physics , where quantum - statistical effects are of crucial importance : upon cooling , bosonic atoms in a trap condense into a superfluid state at a rather sharply defined critical temperature @xmath0 while fermionic atoms continuously evolve into a degenerate noninteracting gas , resisting spatial compression due to their fermi pressure [ 4 ] .",
    "both features are a consequence of the purely statistical interaction between the atoms .",
    "by contrast , the actual interparticle potential plays only a comparatively minor role . to see this , we start from the standard pseudopotential description , which replaces the complicated interatomic potential by an effective contact interaction of the form    @xmath1    containing the exact s - wave scattering length @xmath2 as the only parameter . for identical fermions",
    ", there is no s - wave scattering due to the pauli - principle and thus we obtain an ideal fermi gas to lowest order . for bosons , in turn , @xmath2 is finite , however at a given density @xmath3 the importance of direct interaction effects can be estimated from the ratio    @xmath4    between the interaction and the kinetic energy per particle . now",
    "the average interparticle spacing @xmath5 is usually much larger than the scattering length and thus @xmath6 is very small , with typical values around @xmath7 .",
    "this puts us into the weak coupling limit where the many body ground state of @xmath8 bosons is well approximated by a simple product [ 5 ]    @xmath9    in which all atoms are in the identical single particle state @xmath10 . taking ( 3 ) as a variational ansatz , the optimal macroscopic wave function @xmath10",
    "is found to obey the well known gross - pitaevski equation .",
    "it describes - even on a quantitative level - a wealth of remarkable and nontrivial properties of trapped condensates from interference between different condensates [ 6 ] to collective modes [ 7 ] or vortices [ 8 ] . from a many body point of view",
    ", the effective single particle or hartree - description ( 3 ) is of course the simplest of all possible cases , containing no interaction induced correlations between different atoms at all . a first step to go beyond this mean field description is the well known bogoliubov theory .",
    "this is usually introduced by considering small fluctuations around the gross - pitaevski equation in a systematic expansion in the number of noncondensed particles [ 9 ] . as emphasized , for example , by leggett",
    "[ 5 ] , it is more instructive from a many body point of view to formulate bogoliubov theory in such a way that the many body boson ground state is approximated by an optimized product    @xmath11    of identical , symmetric two particle wave functions @xmath12 .",
    "this allows us to build in the interaction beyond the mean field potential by suppressing configurations in which particles @xmath13 and @xmath14 are close together .",
    "the many body state thus incorporates two - particle correlations which are important e.g. to obtain the standard sound modes and the related coherent superposition of particle and hole excitations [ 10 ] .",
    "however , even the bogoliubov description is restricted to the regime @xmath15 , where interactions lead only to a small depletion of the condensate at zero temperature . the associated ground state is again characterized by a macroscopic matter wave field and continuously evolves from that of a noninteracting gas .",
    "an obvious way to go beyond the weak coupling regime is to increase the dimensionless interaction strength parameter @xmath6 by increasing the scattering length via a feshbach resonance . of course ,",
    "this method is limited by the fact that the associated condensate lifetime strongly decreases due to three - body losses which occur at a rate [ 11 ]    @xmath16    in spite of this problem , this method of reaching the strong coupling regime has been followed quite successfully recently , see e.g. [ 12 ] and [ 13 ] . in the following , we will discuss an alternative route to reach strong coupling even at small values of @xmath17 .",
    "it is based on confining cold atoms in the periodic potential of an optical lattice generated via the dipole force which atoms experience in a standing , off - resonant light field .",
    "depending on the sign of the polarizability , the atoms are attracted either to the nodes or the anti - nodes of the laser intensity . in this manner ,",
    "one- , two- , or three - dimensional lattices can be created with a lattice constant @xmath18 which is half the laser wavelength ( typically @xmath19 is in the range between @xmath20 m and @xmath21 m ) .",
    "in the simplest case , three orthogonal , independent standing laser fields with wave vector @xmath22 produce a separable 3d lattice potential    @xmath23    with a tunable amplitude @xmath24 . a convenient measure for the strength",
    "@xmath24 of the lattice potential is the recoil energy @xmath25 which is typically in the few khz range . in a deep optical lattice with @xmath26 ,",
    "the energy @xmath27 of local oscillations in the well is much larger than the recoil energy and each well supports many quasi - bound states .",
    "for instance in the deepest lattices generated in the recent experiments by greiner et.al [ 14 ] with @xmath28 this number is around four while the local oscillation frequency has reached @xmath29khz .",
    "provided all the atoms are in the lowest vibrational level at each site , their motion is frozen except for the small tunneling amplitude to neighbouring sites .",
    "the atoms are then effectively confined to move in the lowest band of the lattice . with @xmath30 as the states localized at site @xmath31 , the appropriate single particle eigenstates are bloch - waves @xmath32 with quasimomentum @xmath33 and energy    @xmath34    the bandwidth parameter @xmath35 is essentially the gain in kinetic energy due to nearest neighbour tunneling . in the limit @xmath26 it can be obtained from the exact result for the width of the lowest band in the 1d mathieu - equation    @xmath36    obviously , in a lattice , it is @xmath35 which plays the role of the kinetic energy per particle in the homogeneous case .",
    "the effective value of @xmath37 is therefore very large in optical lattices , increasing exponentially with @xmath38 .",
    "thus it is the quenching of the kinetic energy for motion in the lowest band which drives cold atoms into the strong coupling regime , even though @xmath17 may still be much smaller than one .",
    "alternatively , one may argue that @xmath39 becomes small because atoms in a deep optical lattice have an exponentially large effective mass @xmath40 . to really obtain interesting many body effects",
    "it is of course necessary to have the interaction and the kinetic energy of the same order .",
    "this requires optical lattices in which the number of atoms per site is of order one or larger , a regime which has been possible to reach only recently with bose - einstein - condensates .",
    "in the following , i will discuss the mott - hubbard transition for bosonic atoms , as a generic example illustrating how cold atoms in optical lattices can be used to study genuine many body phenomena in dilute gases .",
    "the original idea suggesting the possibility of nontrivial many body states using cold atoms in optical lattices is due to jaksch et.al . [",
    "their starting point is the so called bose - hubbard model , originally introduced by fisher et.al . in a rather different context [ 16 ] .",
    "it describes bosons hopping with amplitude @xmath35 to nearest neighbors on a regular lattice of sites @xmath41 .",
    "the particles interact with a zero - range , on - site repulsion @xmath42 , disfavouring configurations with more than one atom at a given site . with @xmath43 as the creation operator of a boson at site @xmath41 and @xmath44 the associated number operator , the hamiltonian reads    @xmath45    here @xmath46 denotes a sum over nearest neighbour pairs , including double counting . the last term with a variable on - site energy @xmath47 is introduced to describe the effect of the trapping potential and acts like a spatially varying chemical potential .",
    "the form of the interaction term is precisely that obtained by viewing each site as a local condensate with a gross - pitaevski mean field potential .",
    "the relevant interaction parameter @xmath42 is thus given by an integral over the on - site wave function @xmath48 via    @xmath49    the explicit result is obtained by taking @xmath48 as the gaussian ground state in the local oscillator potential around any of the sites .",
    "more precisely , @xmath48 is the exact wannier wave function of the lowest band . in a separable periodic potential like that in ( 6 )",
    ", @xmath48 decays exponentially in all directions rather than in a gaussian manner [ 17 ] , however this does not seriously affect the calculation of @xmath42 in the deep lattice limit @xmath26 . from eqn.(10 ) , it is obvious that the strength of the repulsion increases with @xmath24 due to the tighter squeezing of the on - site wave function @xmath48 . with increasing @xmath38 , therefore , not only does the kinetic energy drop exponentially , but at the same time the interaction energy increases . as a result , it is possible to reach the strong coupling regime @xmath50 simply by increasing the depth of the optical lattice potential . regarding the requirements necessary for the validity of the discrete lattice model ( 9 ) , it is obvious that the atoms have to remain in the lowest vibrational state at each site even in the presence of strong interactions .",
    "we thus require that @xmath51 which is well obeyed even in deep optical lattices as long as @xmath52 .",
    "the zero temperature phase diagram of the homogeneous bose - hubbard model was first discused by fisher et.al .",
    "although there are considerable quantitative differences between the case of one- , two- or three - dimensional lattices , the qualitative structure is similar in all cases and is shown schematically in figure 1 . at large",
    "@xmath53 the kinetic energy dominates and the ground state is a delocalized superfluid ( sf ) . at small values of @xmath53 , interactions dominate and one obtains a series of so called mott - insulating ( mi ) phases with fixed integer filling @xmath54 depending on the value of the chemical potential @xmath55 .",
    "to understand the peculiar structure of these mott - lobes , consider first the case of unit filling , i.e. the number @xmath8 of atoms is precisely equal to the number @xmath56 of lattice sites . in the limit where @xmath24 is very large compared to @xmath57 , there is no hopping ( @xmath58 ) and the obvious ground state     in the superfluid phase ( sf ) hit the corresponding mott - insulating ( mi ) phases at the tips of the lobes at a critical value of @xmath53 , which decreases with density @xmath59 . for @xmath60 the line of constant density stays outside the @xmath61 mi because a fraction @xmath62 of the particles remains superfluid down to the lowest values of @xmath35 . in an external trap with a @xmath63 mi phase in the center ,",
    "a series of mi and sf regions appear by going towards the edge of the cloud , where the local chemical potential has dropped to zero . ]",
    "@xmath64    is a simple product of local fock - states with precisely one atom ( @xmath65 ) per site . upon lowering @xmath24 ,",
    "the atoms start to hop around , which necessarily involves double occupancy , increasing the energy by @xmath42 .",
    "now as long as the gain @xmath35 in kinetic energy due to hopping is smaller than @xmath42 , the atoms remain localized although the ground state is no longer a simple product state as in ( 11 ) . once @xmath35 becomes of order or larger than @xmath42 , the gain in kinetic energy outweighs the repulsion due to double occupancies and the atoms will be delocalized over the whole lattice . in the limit",
    "@xmath66 the many body ground state becomes simply an ideal bose - einstein - condensate where all @xmath8 atoms are in the @xmath67 bloch - state of the lowest band . including the normalization factor in a lattice with a total number of @xmath56 sites",
    ", this state can be written in the form    @xmath68    for large enough @xmath35 therefore , we recover a gross - pitaevski like description in terms of one , macroscopically occupied state . in two- and three - dimensional lattices ,",
    "the critical value for the transition from a mi to a sf is reasonably well described by a mean - field approximation , giving @xmath69 for @xmath70 and @xmath71 for @xmath72 . here",
    "@xmath73 is the number of nearest neighbours . in one dimension",
    "there are strong deviations from a mean - field approximation and the corresponding values are @xmath74 for @xmath70 [ 18,19 ] and @xmath75 for @xmath72 .",
    "the latter result follows from mapping the bose - hubbard model to a chain of josephson junctions , for which the critical value of the transition to a mi phase is known precisely .",
    "consider now a filling with @xmath60 which is slightly larger than one .",
    "for large @xmath53 the ground state has all the atoms delocalized over the whole lattice and the situation is hardly different from the case of unit filling . upon lowering @xmath53 ,",
    "however , the line of constant density remains slightly above the @xmath70 mott - lobe , and stays in the sf regime down to the lowest @xmath53 ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "for any noninteger filling , therefore , the ground state remains sf as long as the atoms can hop at all .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact , that even for @xmath76 there is a small fraction @xmath62 of atoms which remain sf on top of a frozen mi - phase with @xmath70 .",
    "indeed this fraction can still gain kinetic energy by delocalizing over the whole lattice without being blocked by the repulsive interaction @xmath42 because two of those particles will never be at the same place .",
    "the same argument applies to holes when @xmath62 is negative .    in order to describe the situation in a weak harmonic trap , we use the standard appproximation that a slowly varying external potential may be accounted for by a spatially varying chemical potential @xmath77 ( we choose @xmath78 at the trap center ) .",
    "assuming that the chemical potential @xmath79 at trap center falls into the @xmath63 mott - lobe , one obtains a series of mi domains separated by a sf by moving to the boundary of the trap where @xmath80 vanishes ( see fig.1 ) [ 15 ] . in this manner ,",
    "all the different phases which exist for given @xmath53 below @xmath79 are present simultaneously .",
    "since the defining property of a mi - phase is its incompressibility @xmath81 , the atomic density stays constant in the mott - phases , even though the external trapping potential is rising .",
    "an estimate for the width of the incompressible domains is obtained by noting that for @xmath76 the range in chemical potential over which the density remains constant is close to @xmath42 . in a quadratic confining potential with axial frequency @xmath82hz and with typical values @xmath83khz",
    ", the width of the incompressible mi - states is around @xmath84 m .",
    "it remains an experimental challenge to spatially resolve the sf and mi phases in a trap , thus verifying the crucial property of incompressibility .    in practice ,",
    "the observation of the sf to mi transition is done in the usual manner by absorption imaging the atomic cloud after a given expansion time .",
    "the corresponding series of images is shown in fig.2 for different values of @xmath24 , ranging between @xmath85 ( a ) and @xmath86 ( h ) .",
    "one observes a series of bragg - peaks around the characteristic zero - momentum peak of a condensate in the absence of an optical lattice . with increasing @xmath24",
    "these peaks become more pronounced . beyond a critical lattice depth around @xmath87 ( e )",
    ", this trend is suddenly reversed , however , and the bragg peaks eventually disappear completely . in order to understand ,",
    "to which extent these pictures actually provide a direct evidence for the existence of a sf to mi transition predicted by the bose - hubbard model , we neglect the inhomogeneous nature of the atomic cloud and assume that the absorption images simply reflect the momentum distribution . for atoms which are confined to move in the lowest band of the lattice , it is straightforward to show that the momentum ( not quasi - momentum [ 20 ] ) distribution     @xmath88 ( a ) , @xmath89 ( b ) , @xmath90 ( c ) , @xmath91 ( d ) , @xmath92 ( e ) , @xmath93 ( f ) , @xmath94 ( g ) and @xmath95 ( h ) . taken from ref .",
    "[ 14 ] with permission . ]",
    "@xmath96    can be expressed in terms of the exact one - particle density matrix @xmath97 at separation @xmath98 and the fourier transform @xmath99 of the associated wannier wave - function .",
    "the summation in ( 13 ) is over all lattice vectors @xmath98 , which are integer multiples of the three primitive vectors of the given lattice .",
    "now the sf and mi phases are distinguished quite generally by the behaviour of the one particle density matrix ( or first order coherence function in quantum optics terminology ) at large separation . in the sf",
    ", @xmath100 approaches a finite value @xmath101 which defines the condensate density @xmath102 [ 21 ] . for the mi phase , in turn , @xmath100 decays to zero exponentially . using ( 13 )",
    ", the sf phase of cold atoms in an optical lattice can thus quite generally be characterized by the fact that at reciprocal lattice vectors @xmath103 defined by @xmath104 times an integer , the momentum distribution @xmath105 has a peak    @xmath106    which scales with the total number @xmath8 of particles .",
    "this is the expected behaviour for the interference pattern from a periodic array of phase coherent sources of matter waves and is precisely analogous to the more standard bragg - peaks in the static structure factor of a solid , with the condensate fraction playing the role of the debye - waller factor [ 22 ] .",
    "the fact that the peaks in the momentum distribution at @xmath107 initially grow with increasing depth of the lattice potential is a result of the strong decrease in spatial extent of the wannier function @xmath48 , which entails a corresponding increase in its fourier transform @xmath99 at higher momenta .",
    "it is important to realize that there is no broadening of the peaks as long as @xmath108 is finite , in agreement with the experimental observations [ 14 ] . in the mi regime , where @xmath100 decays to zero , remnants of the bragg - peaks still remain ( see e.g. ( f ) in fig.2 ) as long as @xmath100 extends over several lattice spacings , because the series in ( 13 ) adds up constructively at @xmath107 .",
    "physically this reflects the fact that phase coherence is still present over distances much larger than one lattice spacing provided one is close to the transition to superfluidity .",
    "in contrast to the sf regime , however , these peaks are now broadened and do not scale with the total number @xmath8 of particles . in the extreme mi limit @xmath76 ,",
    "hopping of atoms completely vanishes and @xmath100 is zero beyond @xmath109 .",
    "coherence is then completely lost and the momentum distribution is a structureless gaussian , reflecting the fourier transform of the wannier wave function ( see ( h ) in fig.2 ) .",
    "these arguments show that for a large and homogeneous system there is indeed a sharp signature of the sf to mi transition in the interference pattern .",
    "it is connected with the existence or not of ( off - diagonal ) long range order in the one particle density matrix , which effectively measures the range of phase coherence and the condensate fraction . of course the actual system is not homogeneous and a numerical computation of the interference pattern is necessary for a quantitative comparison with experiment [ 23 ] . due to the finite size and the fact that different mi phases are involved , the pattern evolves continously from the sf to the mi regime . indeed ,",
    "as is evident from the phase diagram in fig.1 , the critical value of @xmath53 is different for the two different mi phases @xmath70 and @xmath110 which are present in the trap .",
    "nevertheless , a rather sharp transition is observed experimentally , because @xmath53 depends exponentially on the control parameter @xmath38 . the small change from @xmath87 in ( e ) to @xmath111 in ( f )",
    "thus covers a range in @xmath53 wider than that which would be required to distinguish the @xmath70 from the @xmath110 transition .",
    "a second signature of the sf to mi transition is the appearance of a finite excitation gap @xmath112 in the mi .",
    "deep in the mi phase , this gap has size @xmath42 , which is just the increase in energy if an atom tunnels to an already occupied adjacent site ( note that this is much smaller than the gap @xmath113 for the excitation of the next vibrational state ) .",
    "the existence of this gap has been verified experimentally by applying a phase gradient in the mi and measuring the resulting excitations produced in the sf at smaller @xmath38 [ 14 ] . in this manner",
    "the fact that @xmath114 was verified for a range of @xmath24 , all reasonably deep in the mi phase . for reasons discussed above ,",
    "however , it has not been possible to see the vanishing of the gap near the transition , which should scale like @xmath115 in the three - dimensional case [ 16 ] . in the sf regime",
    ", there is no excitation gap and instead the homogeneous system exhibits a sound like mode with frequency @xmath116 .",
    "the associated sound velocity follows from the thermodynamic relation @xmath117 and thus gives information about the superfluid density @xmath118 . the existence of a sound like excitation even in the presence of an underlying lattice which explicitely breaks translation invariance is a consequence of long range phase coherence in the sf .",
    "its observation would thus constitute an independent proof that the atoms move coherently over the whole lattice and thus phase gradients give rise to dissipationless currents .",
    "finally we discuss the change in the atom number statistics at individual sites between the sf and the mi regime .",
    "this issue has been investigated in a very recent beautiful experiment , observing collapse and revival of the matter wave due to the coherent superposition of states with different atom numbers in the sf [ 24 ] . as noted above",
    ", the ground state ( 11 ) in the extreme mi limit is a product of fock states with a definite number @xmath59 of particles at each site . at finite hopping @xmath119 ,",
    "this simple picture breaks down because the atoms have a finite amplitude to be at different sites .",
    "the many body ground state can then no longer be written as a simple product state as in ( 11 ) . in the opposite limit @xmath120 ,",
    "the ground state is a condensate of zero quasimomentum bloch states .",
    "it turns out , that the probability of finding precisely @xmath3 atoms at any given site in the associated state ( 12 ) is close to a poissonian distribution .",
    "more precisely , in the limit @xmath121 at fixed density @xmath122 , the state ( 12 ) becomes indistinguishable in a local measurement from a coherent state    @xmath123    which factorizes into a product of local poissonian states with average @xmath124 because boson operators at different sites commute .",
    "we have thus come to the remarkable conclusion that for integer densities @xmath125 the many body ground state may be written in a local product form    @xmath126    in both limits @xmath127 and @xmath120 .",
    "the associated atom number probability distribution @xmath128 is either a pure fock or a full poissonian distribution .",
    "it is now very plausible to use the factorized form ( 16 ) as an approximation for arbitrary @xmath53 , taking the coefficients @xmath129 as variational parameters which are determined by minimizing the ground state energy [ 25 ] .",
    "as first pointed out by rokhsar and kotliar [ 26 ] , this is effectively a gutzwiller ansatz for bosons . beyond being very simple computationally , this ansatz describes the sf to mi transition in a mean - field sense , becoming exact in infinite dimensions .",
    "in addition , it provides one with a very intuitive picture of the transition to a mi state , which occurs precisely at the point where the local number distribution becomes a pure fock distribution .",
    "this is consistent with a vanishing expectation value of the local matter wave field    @xmath130    in the gutzwiller approximation .",
    "it is important , however , to emphasize that the ansatz ( 16 ) fails to account for the nontrivial correlations between different sites present at any finite @xmath35 .",
    "these correlations imply that the one particle density matrix @xmath100 is different from zero at finite distance @xmath131 , becoming long ranged at the transition to a sf .",
    "by contrast , in the gutzwiller approximation , the one particle density matrix has no spatial dependence at all : it is zero at any @xmath131 in the mi and is completely independent of @xmath98 in the sf .",
    "moreover , in the gutzwiller approximation the phase transition is directly reflected in the local number fluctuations , with the variance of @xmath132 vanishing throughout the mi phase .",
    "by contrast , in an exact theory local variables like the on - site number distribution will change in a smooth manner near the transition and the variance of the local particle number will only vanish in the limit @xmath127 . concerning the dynamics , one expects that the gutzwiller approximation qualitatively captures the time scales for local changes of the configuration , however it fails to correctly describe long wavelength excitations [ 26 ] .",
    "the realization of a sf to mi transition with cold atoms in optical lattices provides an essentially perfect realization of one of the most prominent models in many body physics .",
    "it allows to study a quantum phase transition by simply tuning the depth of the optical lattice .",
    "there remain , however , a number of open questions in particular concerning the detailed spatial structure in the trap and the dynamical behaviour [ 27 ] .",
    "as we have discussed above , superfluidity of cold atoms is destroyed in a deep optical lattice where the ground state looses phase coherence and - essentially - has a fixed number of atoms per site .",
    "the associated mott - hubbard transition occurs when the ratio @xmath133 is of order one . using the expressions ( 8) and ( 10 ) for @xmath35 and @xmath42 in terms of the optical lattice parameters , this translates into a condition of the form    @xmath134    for the critical value of the dimensionless lattice depth @xmath135 . in the interesting regime with one or two atoms per site ,",
    "the lattice constant @xmath19 is roughly equal to the the mean interparticle spacing @xmath5 .",
    "the prefactor @xmath136 in ( 18 ) thus coincides with the dimensionless interaction parameter @xmath6 introduced in ( 2 ) . for weak interactions @xmath15 therefore , the sf to mi transition requires deep optical lattices , for instance @xmath137 in the experiments by greiner et.al.[14 ] , where @xmath138 . in the following we want to adress the question what happens in a situation where the effective gas parameter @xmath6 becomes of order one or larger . the superfluid ground state is then expected to be destroyed already in a weak optical lattice , where the description in terms of a bose - hubbard model is no longer applicable .",
    "it turns out that this problem can be solved completely in the special case of one - dimensional bose gases in which the transverse motion is frozen into the lowest eigenstate of a strong confining potential [ 28 ] . as pointed out by petrov et.al .",
    "[ 29 ] , the ratio between the interaction and kinetic energy per particle in one dimension    @xmath139    scales inversely with the 1d density @xmath140 . here",
    "@xmath141 is the strength of the effective delta - function interaction in 1d and @xmath142 the oscillator length for the transverse confinement [ 29 ] . in one dimension , it is thus the low density limit where interactions dominate .",
    "this somewhat counterintuitive result can be understood physically by noting that at low 1d densities , the average kinetic energy per particle @xmath143 vanishes so quickly that the atoms are perfectly reflected by the repulsive potential of the surrounding particles . for @xmath144 , therefore , the system aproaches a gas of impenetrable bosons which is called the tonks - limit [ 29 ] .",
    "in particular at @xmath145 the exact many body wave function is just the absolute value of that of a free fermi gas , as was shown a long time ago by girardeau [ 30 ] .",
    "this equivalence remains valid in the presence of an arbitrary additional one - particle potential like that of an optical lattice . for a qualitative understanding of what happens in the strongly interacting regime it is therefore useful to consider a free fermi gas in a weak periodic potential @xmath146 with @xmath24 of order @xmath57 or smaller",
    "this is an elementary problem in solid state physics , equivalent to the nearly free electron limit of a one - dimensional bandstructure .",
    "the single particle spectrum consists of a series of free particle like bands separated by energy gaps @xmath147 .",
    "the gaps become exponentially small with increasing energy , scaling like @xmath148 in the limit @xmath149 . for a commensurate density , where an integer number @xmath41 of particles fit into one unit cell ,",
    "the @xmath41 lowest bands are completely filled .",
    "the groundstate of noninteracting fermions is thus a trivial band insulator .",
    "similar to the incompressible mott - insulating phase of the bose - hubbard model , the state with a fixed integer density remains locked over a finite range @xmath150 of the chemical potential . for weak optical lattices @xmath149",
    "the lowest gap @xmath151 is much larger than the higher order ones . as a result , it is the commensurate phase with unit filling @xmath152 which has maximal stability .    in the tonks",
    "limit @xmath153 we have thus found that an arbitrary weak optical lattice which is commensurate with the average density will pin the atoms into an incompressible optical crystal .",
    "the crucial question is obviously whether this peculiar feature of hard core bosons in one dimension is still present at finite and experimentally realizable values of @xmath154 . to answer that , it is convenient to use haldane s description of bose gases with arbitrary repulsive , short range interactions in terms of their long wavelength density oscillations [ 31 ] . introducing a field",
    "@xmath155 which is related to the fluctuations @xmath156 around the average density via @xmath157 , the hamiltonian in the presence of a weak , commensurate optical lattice can be shown [ 28 ] to be that of a quantum @xmath158dimensional sine - gordon model    @xmath159\\eqno(20)\\ ] ]    here @xmath160 is the actual sound velocity and @xmath161 is canonically conjugate to @xmath162 such that @xmath163=i\\delta(x - x')$ ] .",

    "the size of the gap also determines the critical value @xmath179 of the deviation from exact commensurability which can still be accomodated into a locked groundstate . in order to relate @xmath167 to the microscopic and experimentally tunable parameter",

    "it turns out that @xmath180 is a monotonically decreasing function which reaches the critical value @xmath181 at @xmath182 .",
    "the transition to a commensurate , incompressible state in a weak optical lattice thus occurs long before the tonks limit is reached . as is evident from eqn .",

    ", one thus needs @xmath183 where @xmath184 .    in a one - dimensional bose gas",
    "we have thus found that a transition from a sf to a mi state at weak coupling @xmath15 requires a deep optical lattice , while at strong coupling @xmath185 an arbitrary weak lattice is sufficient to destroy phase coherence ( similar to the mi phase of the bose - hubbard model , the one particle density matrix @xmath186 will decay exponentially in the phase where the atoms are locked to the external lattice potential ) .",
    "for weak coupling , the criterion @xmath187 for the transition in the anisotropic , one - dimensional bose - hubbard model can be written in a form similar to eqn . ( 18 )    @xmath188 .",

    "more precisely , the kosterlitz - thouless nature of the transition near @xmath181 determines the critical value of @xmath167 for small @xmath192 to behave like @xmath193 to linear order in @xmath194 [ 28 ] .",
    "the complete phase diagram for unit filling at arbitrary values of @xmath38 can then be obtained by combining these two asymptotic results in a smooth interpolation , as shown in fig.3 .",
    "the bose - hubbard transition ( bh ) for weakly interacting gases in a deep optical lattice thus continuously evolves into one of the commensurate - incommensurate ( c - ic ) type for strongly interacting gases in a weak lattice .",
    "it remains a challenge to extend these results to situations with two or more particles per lattice period and - in particular - to the case of two- or three - dimensional lattices .     as a function of the inverse interaction parameter @xmath6 .",
    "the dashed line is the asymptotic behaviour near the critical point @xmath195 as determined from the sine - gordon model , while the dashed - dotted line derives from the solution of the transcendental equation ( 23 ) as obtained from the critical point of the 1d bose - hubbard model . ]    regarding the prospects for an experimental observation of the c - ic transition discussed above , we have seen that realistic values of the excitation gap @xmath196 require @xmath154 to be of order @xmath91 .",
    "one - dimensional bose gases with parameters in this range may be realized with a strong optical lattice in only two directions @xmath197 which confine the atoms transversely but leave the motion along @xmath73 essentially free , except for a rather weak axial trap with frequency @xmath198 . as an example , using numbers close to those in the experiments by greiner et.al . [ 14 ] on the sf to mi transition , it is possible to generate a few thousand parallel one - dimensional gases with about @xmath199 atoms per wire . taking realistic values @xmath200 khz and @xmath201 hz , the central density for large @xmath6 is close to @xmath202m@xmath203 [ 34 ] .",
    "this is precisely commensurate with the lattice constant @xmath204 m of the optical lattice used in these experiments . adding a weak optical lattice in @xmath205direction ,",

    "since three - body losses are very strongly reduced in one dimension at large @xmath6 [ 35 ] , there is no problem with the condensate lifetime here .",
    "the transition may be observed in a similar manner than in the bose - hubbard case .",
    "more interesting however would be to measure the long range translational order present in the locked phase by bragg diffraction , as was done for cold atoms in deep optical lattices even at very low densities [ 22 ] .",
    "this method has the advantage that the signal from many parallel wires adds up constructively because they all experience the same modulation in @xmath205direction .",

    "basic models in many body theory like the hubbard - model for bosons or fermions with on - site interaction , which were originally introduced in a condensed matter context as a rather schematic description of say superfluid helium in vycor or electrons in high - temperature superconductors can now be applied even on a quantitative level .",
    "moreover the crucial parameters @xmath209 and density can easily be tuned in a controlled fashion .",
    "this opens a wide area of possibilities for strong correlation physics with cold atoms , in particular if degenerate fermions may be loaded into an optical lattice . with two equivalent species of fermions",
    "the resulting version of the hubbard model displays a wealth of different phases : in the attractive case it describes the bcs- to bose - crossover for cooper - pairing , in the repulsive case antiferromagnetic or unconventional superconducting phases appear , as recently discussed by hofstetter et.al . [ 36 ] . from the perspective of atomic and molecular physics , a mott - insulating state with precisely two atoms per site",
    "is an ideal starting point for the formation of molecular condensates via local photoassociation and subsequent melting of the mott - phase as suggested by jaksch et.al .",
    "[ 37 ] . finally , controlled interactions ( collisions ) between atoms in different internal states in an optical lattice may be used to generate highly entangled states useful for quantum computation schemes [ 38,39 ] .",
