    "gamma  ray bursts ( grbs ) are among the most dramatic events in the universe .",
    "their luminosities are so high ( @xmath3 ergs are emitted in a few seconds ) that they can be seen at the highest redshifts . however , since the decline in their energy emission is very fast , the investigation and understanding of their physical nature is is not particularly easy ( piran 2001 ) .",
    "for instance , the redshift of the afterglow or host galaxy has been measured in only 24 casesjcg / grbgen.html for the complete list of grb redshifts ] .    only eight of these objects have been targeted quickly enough by ground  based telescopes to obtain low resolution spectra of the optical transient , and all show a common peculiarity : very strong uv absorption lines of low ionization species ( fiore 2001 ; fynbo et al .  2002 ) .",
    "this is similar to what is seen in damped lyman@xmath0 systems ( dlas ) associated with intervening galaxies along qso sight lines .",
    "dlas are certainly an unexplored and important source of information on the circumburst and/or interstellar medium ( ism ) of the grb host galaxy . here",
    "we explore in more detail their properties and compare them with those of qso  dla galaxies .",
    "we use the curve of growth ( cog ) analysis to derive column densities of low ionization species in several grb  dlas . as for qso  dlas , we neglect ionization effects to derive the abundances of several heavy elements .",
    "the low ionization of the gas is warranted by the large equivalent widths of the low ionization lines , and the low equivalent widths of the moderate and high ionization lines .",
    "the difference in abundances between weakly and greatly dust depleted elements provides an estimate of the dust content .",
    "the cog analysis was applied to qso  dlas ( blades et al .",
    "1982 ; turnshek et al .",
    "1989 ) before the advent of high resolution spectroscopy , which allows a direct fitting of individual absorption lines . since grb emission fades very rapidly , high resolution ( fwhm @xmath4 km  s@xmath5 ) spectra of grb afterglows are very hard to obtain .    in this work ,",
    "we interpret strong differences between grb  dlas and qso  dlas as the result of the difference in the densities of the intervening gas .",
    "since grbs are , at least for some time , brighter than primarily optically selected qsos , they can be observed even if their sight lines cross very dense and dusty regions , such as molecular clouds , where extinction is very severe . on the other hand ,",
    "qso sight lines are easier to detect when intersecting less dusty interstellar clouds .",
    "this bias in qso ",
    "dlas has been already suggested in the past ( see , for instance , fall & pei 1993 ; boiss et al .",
    "more recently , ellison et al .",
    "( 2001 ) have studied a small sample of radio  selected qsos and tentatively found more dlas than in optically selected qsos . even if this result is affected by small number statistics ( significant at @xmath6 level ) , it supports the idea of dust obscuration in optically selected qso  dlas .",
    "our analysis is alternative to and independent of the dust content estimate obtained so far for grbs .",
    "the dust reddening in grb afterglows has been derived in several objects ( see for instance reichart 1998 ; jensen et al .",
    "2001 ; rhoads & fruchter 2001 ; fynbo et al .",
    "2001 ; galama & wijers 2001 ) and in most cases it has been found to be small or negligible . the method applied assumes initial power law emission from the grbs , and steep extinction curves such as those in the milky way ( mw ) or large & small magellanic clouds ( mc ) .",

    "2001 ) , grb990712 ( @xmath13 , vreeswijk et al .",
    "2001 ) , and grb011211 ( holland et al .",

    "table [ t1 ] lists oscillator strengths @xmath14 ( from the recent compilation by prochaska et al .",
    "2001 ) and rest frame equivalent widths @xmath15 of absorption lines in the three grbs used in the present analysis .",
    "the large @xmath15 of all these species relative to higher ionization species like , and , indicate that the medium is weakly ionized . from the equivalent widths ( ews ) , we derive column densities and directly compare the results with typical column densities in qso  dlas . comparing column densities instead of metallicities [ x / h ] has the advantage that the column density ( known only in grb000926 with large uncertainty ; fynbo et al .",
    "2002 ) is not required .",
    "moreover , it is not necessary to make any assumptions about the dust depletion , cosmic abundance or ionization level of the considered element , but we can still search for similarities and differences between grb  dlas and qso  dlas .",
    "a direct comparison is complicated by the fact that normally qso  dlas are observed at high spectral resolution ( fwhm @xmath16 km  s@xmath5 ) in a large wavelength range ( thanks to echelle spectroscopy ) , allowing a good determination of column densities of many ions , even in cases where saturated or weak lines in complex features are detected ( see for instance lu et al .",

    "moreover , the majority of absorption lines are saturated , and it is not possible to use the linear part of the cog to determine column densities",
    ". however , the lines are numerous and so , even if the uncertainty may be large , it is possible to make an abundance analysis using the general cog analysis ( spitzer 1978 ) . since the typical resolution of grb spectra does not allow the separation of the different components of a complex feature , due to the many clouds along the line of sight , in our analysis we adopt a large `` effective '' doppler parameter , being the result of the superposition of many narrow absorption lines . for reference",
    ", we note that typical velocities in qso  dlas are @xmath18 km  s@xmath5  or more .",
    "the cog analysis applied with the single component approximation was used for qso  dla studies before high resolution spectroscopy of qsos became possible ( see for instance blades et al .",
    "1982 ; turnshek et al .  1989 ) .",
    "in fact , jenkins ( 1986 ) showed that the cog technique applied to complex features gives nearly the correct answer ( the simulated  to  true column density ratio rarely goes below 0.8 ) even if different lines have very different saturation levels or doppler parameters .",
    "this general result is also confirmed by savage & sembach ( 1991 ) .    the best  fitting column density is determined by using simultaneously different ews of various ions and choosing the cog with an effective doppler parameter that minimizes the @xmath19 . once the best effective doppler parameter is determined ,",
    "the error on the column density for each ion is determined by varying @xmath20 for which @xmath21 . in the following   2.12.3 ,",
    "we discuss column density measurements in each individual grb .",
    "figures [ f1a][f1c ] show the best  fitting @xmath22 and column densities , and the corresponding cog .",
    "estimated column densities are given in table [ t2 ] .",
    "the optical transient of grb990123 at @xmath23 was observed with the keck / lris ( kulkarni et al .",

    "neither of these measurements is consistent with those observed ( @xmath52   and @xmath53  , respectively ) ; this might indicate a contamination of the @xmath48 line by an unidentified absorption associated with an intervening metal system .",
    "moreover , the @xmath35 is probably corrupted by a noise spike in the spectrum ( see figure 3 of castro et al .",
    "2001 ) probably due to a remnant of the strong sky line at @xmath54  .",

    "the lack of @xmath56 detection is puzzling . if , for instance , we assume @xmath57@xmath58   ( way above the detection limit in the spectrum ) , the line is almost unsaturated , and @xmath38@xmath59 for @xmath60 km  s@xmath5 , inconsistent with what is found from the other lines .",

    "the symbols in figure [ f2 ] indicates the column densities of the same ions measured for the three grb  dlas .",

    "the very low [ fe / zn ] values in three grb  dlas ( @xmath100 , @xmath101 , and @xmath102 ) are much smaller than in qso  dlas : @xmath103[fe / zn]@xmath104 in 32 objects .",
    "this is an indication of strong dust content in the grb circumburst medium and/or in the ism of the host galaxy , because while fe is heavily depleted on dust in the ism of galaxies , zn is marginally depleted only in the densest clouds ( savage & sembach 1996a ) .",

    "the gap between qso  dlas and grb  dlas is filled by a completely different class of absorbers : those in the ism of the mw and mc .",
    "low values of [ fe / zn ] are also an indication of high dust content .",
    "petitjean , srianand , & ledoux  ( 2002 ) discuss the gas density in qso  dlas with h@xmath105 detection , and suggest that the dust depletion might be larger in denser clouds . if this can be extended to grb ",
    "dlas , it might imply that their gas density is higher than in qso  dlas .    the small [ x / zn ] values found in grb",

    ".    since the metal column densities are so high , the dust extinction can be very important .",
    "a good indicator of dust content is given by the [ fe / zn ] values ; in the grb  dlas these are much smaller ( higher dust depletion ) than those seen in qso  dlas : @xmath103[fe / zn]@xmath140 in the former , @xmath103[fe / zn]@xmath141 in the latter .",

    "we notice , however , that another possible explanation for the very low [ fe / zn ] values would be a nucleosynthetic production of fe and zn in grbs and/or their environment being different from the standard solar pattern .    these strong differences between qso  dlas and grb  dlas",

    "this suggests that the galaxies associated with the absorbing gas around grbs are not different from those of qso  dlas .",
    "the important difference is in the column densities of the intervening ism : grbs are ( at least for some time ) much brighter than optically selected qsos , so their sight lines can probe much denser and dustier regions of galaxies .",

    "however , they also notice that another sample of five grbs ( not included in the first one , for lack of complete photometric information ) have much redder colors .",
    "low extinction can be explained by sublimation of dust grains due to uv emission ( waxman & draine 2000 ) .",
    "fruchter , krolik , & rhoads ( 2001 ) suggest grain destruction by grb heating and grain charging",
    ". these effects can be present up to a distance of @xmath144 pc from the grb source .",
    "this is in principle in contradiction with our findings .",
    "however , the dust disruption mechanisms suggested by fruchter et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , or other mechanisms , such as sputtering ( draine & salpeter 1979 ) , predict that small grains are destroyed first .",
    "dust destruction of small grains would still give a large content of dust , if the initial grain  size distribution is dominated by large grains , as suggested in models of mw an mc extinction curves ( weingartner & draine 2001 ) .",
    "therefore , what remains in dust can still be an important fraction of the total metal content .",
    "grain coagulation favored by high densities , leading to the formation of large grains , is also possible ( mathis 1990 ) . in these cases ,",
    "mw or mc extinction curves might be inappropriate to describe dust obscuration .",
    "a dust grain distribution skewed toward large grains would give a grey extinction , therefore may explain the low reddening found in grb afterglows ( stratta et al .",
    "this is a plausible speculation , but quantitative calculations , needed to determine if it works in practice , are beyond the scope of this paper . a first attempt is instead presented by perna & lazzati ( 2002 ) , who have developed a detailed numerical code that describes , among other effects , the dust destruction under an intense x  ray and uv radiation field the very first seconds after the burst .",
    "alternative explanations are unknown systematic effects . for instance , the low reddening suggested relies on the assumption of an intrinsic power law emission of the optical afterglow , which in principle can not be tested .",
    "it might also be that the extinction in itself is a power law , and when combined with the intrinsic grb power law emission , would still give a power law spectrum .",
    "therefore , this would require low or no rectification .",
    "the main result of the present work is the strong difference between qso  dla and grb  dla heavy element column densities .",
    "dlas occur most likely along the sight line of much brighter sources , and are embedded in star forming and therefore metal rich regions , where the dust extinction is probably not negligible .",
    "this is another evidence supporting the idea that dlas in front of the fainter qso radiation , can be detected and studied in detail only when the sight line crosses less dense , metal polluted and/or extincted regions of high redshift galaxies .",
    "we thank tim heckman , fiona harrison , eliana palazzi and ken sembach for fruitful information on grb spectra and ism absorptions .",
    "we are particularly grateful to daniela calzetti , julian krolik , nicola masetti , nino panagia , and james rhoads for stimulating discussions that helped to improve this paper .",
