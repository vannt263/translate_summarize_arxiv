    "the rapid directional localization of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) by the satellites bepposax ( e.g. costa et al .",
    "1997 ) , rossi ( e.g. levine et al . 1996 ) and by the ipn ( inter - planetary network ) of spacecrafts ( e.g. cline et al . 1999 ) led to the discovery of long - duration grb afterglows , to determinations of their redshifts that verified their cosmological origin ( meegan et al .",
    "1992 ) , to the identification of their birthplaces mainly star formation regions in normal galaxies and to evidence of a possible association of grbs with supernova explosions ( galama et al . 1998 ; kulkarni et al .",
    "the enormous isotropic energies inferred from the redshifts and fluences and the short - time variability have demonstrated that grbs are produced by highly collimated emissions from gravitational stellar collapse ( shaviv and dar 1995 ; dar 1998a and references therein ) , but the specific progenitors and production mechanisms are unknown . in table",
    "i we summarize some properties of the localized grbs , for a currently favoured @xmath0 universe with cosmological constant @xmath1 , matter density @xmath2 ( all in critical units ) , and hubble constant @xmath3 km/(s mpc ) .",
    "the prevalent widespread belief is that grbs are generated by synchrotron emission from fireballs or firecones produced by mergers of compact stars ( paczynski 1986 , goodman et al .",
    "1987 ) or by hypernova explosions ( paczynski 1998 ) .",
    "however , various observations suggest that most grbs are produced in supernova events by highly collimated superluminal jets ( for more details , see dar and de rjula 2000a ) .    in this paper , we outline a relativistic - cannonball model of grbs , which , we contend , explains the main observed features of grbs and their afterglows .",
    "we concentrate here on a major prediction of the model : the superluminal motion of the grbs afterglow .",
    "this specific signature , as we shall see , can still be searched for with a measure of urgency in the very particular case of sn1998bw / grb 980425 .",
    "there is mounting evidence for an association of supernova ( sn ) explosions and grbs .",
    "the first example was grb 980425 ( soffita et al . 1998 ; kippen 1998 ) , within whose error circle sn1998bw was soon detected optically ( galama et al .",
    "1998 ) and at radio frequencies ( kulkarni et al .",
    "the chance probability for a spatial and temporal coincidence is less than @xmath4 ( e.g. galama et al .",
    "1998 ) , or much smaller if the revised bepposax position ( e.g. pian , 1999 ) is used in the estimate .",
    "the unusual radio ( kulkarni et al . 1998a ; wieringa et al .",
    "1999 ) ) and optical ( galama et al . 1998 ; iwamoto et al . 1998 ) properties of sn1998bw , which may have been blended with the afterglow of grb 980425 , support this association .",
    "the exceptionally small fluence and redshift of grb 980425 make this event very peculiar , a fact that we discuss in detail below .",
    "evidence for a sn1998bw - like contribution to a grb afterglow ( dar 1999a ) was first found by bloom et al .",
    "( 1999 ) for grb 980326 , but the unknown redshift prevented a quantitative analysis .",
    "the afterglow of grb 970228 ( located at redshift @xmath5 ) appears to be overtaken by a light curve akin to that of sn1998bw ( located at @xmath6 ) , when properly scaled by their differing redshifts ( dar 1999b ) .",
    "let the energy flux density of sn1998bw be @xmath7 $ ] . for a similar supernova located at z : @xmath8 = } & & { \\rm{1+z \\over 1+z_{bw}}\\ ;   { d_l^2(z_{bw})\\over d_l^2(z)}}\\ , \\times\\nonumber \\\\ & & { \\rm f_{bw}\\left[\\nu\\,{1+z \\over 1+z_{bw}},t\\ , { 1+z_{bw } \\over 1+z}\\right]\\ ; a(\\nu , z)}\\ , , \\label{bw}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath9 is the extinction along the line of sight .",
    "grb association in the case of grb 970228 was reconfirmed by reichart ( 1999 ) and by galama et al .",
    "evidence of similar associations is found for grb 990712 ( hjorth et al .",
    "1999 ; sahu et al .",
    "2000 ) , grb 980703 ( holland 2000 ; dar and de rjula 2000a ) and grb 000418 : an example that we show in fig .  1 . in the case of grb 990510 ,",
    "the evidence is marginal ( dar and de rjula 2000a ) . for the remaining cases in table",
    "i the data preclude a conclusion , for one or more reasons : the late afterglow is not measured ; @xmath10 $ ] is not known for large @xmath11 ; the grb s afterglow or the host galaxy are much brighter than the sn .",
    "the case of grb 970508 , for which the afterglow is brighter than a sn contribution given by eq .",
    "( [ bw ] ) , is shown in fig .  2 .",
    "all in all , it is quite possible that a good fraction of grbs be associated with core - collapse sne , perhaps even _ all _ of the most frequent , long - duration grbs .",
    "the converse statement that most sne of certain types are associated with grbs appears at first sight to be untenable .",
    "the rate of type ib / ic / ii sne has been estimated at @xmath12 per @xmath13 galaxy ( e.g. van den bergh & tammann 1991 ) while the rate of grbs ( for our adopted cosmological parameters ) is a mere @xmath14 per @xmath13 galaxy .",
    "thus , very few of these sne produce _",
    "visible _ grbs .",
    "but , if the sn - associated grbs were beamed within an angle @xmath15 , only a fraction @xmath16 would be visible , making the observed rates compatible and making possible a rough one - to - one sn  grb association ( or a ten - to - one association for @xmath17 ) . beaming within such narrow cones also solves the grb `` energy crisis '' ( dar and plaga 1999 ) .",
    "to proceed , we need some understanding of the generation of superluminal jets in sne . lacking definite theoretical guidance",
    ", we turn to observations in search for enlightment .",
    "relativistic jets seem to be emitted by all astrophysical systems wherein mass is accreted at a high rate from a disk onto a central compact object ( for a recent review , see mirabel and rodriguez 1999a ) .",
    "highly relativistic jets have been observed with high resolution in galactic superluminal sources , such as the microquasars grs 1915 + 105 ( mirabel and rodriguez 1994 , 1999a , b ; rodriguez and mirabel 1999 ) and gro j165 - 40 ( tingay et al . 1995 ) where mass is accreted onto a stellar black hole , and in many active galactic nuclei ( agns ) hosting a massive black hole .",
    "these jets are not continuous streams : they consist of individual blobs of plasma ( plasmoids or `` cannonballs '' ) .",
    "the firing of these cannonballs ( cbs ) coincides with a sudden removal of the accretion - disk material ( mirabel and rodriguez 1999b ) .",
    "as they travel , microquasar cbs expand at the speed of a relativistic plasma ( c/@xmath18 in their rest system ) presumably due to the pressure of their enclosed radiation . as they become transparent and cool down ,",
    "their lateral size stabilizes to a roughly constant value , presumably constrained by magnetic self - containment and/or by the ram pressure of the ambient material .",
    "quasar cbs show no measurable expansion as they travel , sometimes for as long as mpcs .",
    "galactic and quasar cbs expand explosively when finally stopped by the material they traverse .",
    "microquasars cbs are emitted in pairs , at similar velocities , @xmath19 , and angles @xmath20 and @xmath21 relative to the line of sight .",
    "their apparent transverse velocities are @xmath22 . for @xmath23",
    "the approaching cb is superluminal : @xmath24 , a case of `` relativistic aberration '' ( rees 1966 ) . for @xmath25 and @xmath26 : @xmath27 yielding superluminal velocities @xmath28 for @xmath29 , and @xmath30 , for @xmath31 , provided @xmath32 .",
    "superluminal velocities of a few c have been observed in microquasars , and as high as 30 c in quasars ( gabudza et al . 1993 ) .",
    "the ejection of matter in a sn explosion is not fully understood .",
    "the known mechanisms for imparting the required kinetic energy to the ejecta are inefficient",
    ". simulations of stellar collapse for parent stars rotating at a typical observed rate give rise to proto - neutron stars spinning much faster than young pulsars ( heger et al .",
    "magnetic fields no doubt play an important role in the outwards transport of angular momentum , but current simulations ( e.g. spruit and phinney , 1998 ) can not fully cope with their effects . in the related problem of accretion disks",
    ", a freely parametrized bulk viscosity must be introduced to describe the efficient angular momentum transport , presumably due to turbulent magnetohydrodynamic effects ( e.g. longair , 1994 ) . for all these reasons , our theoretical understanding of core - collapse sn events is still unsatisfying .",
    "we posit that the result of a sn event is not just a compact object plus the ejecta : a fraction of the parent star falls back onto the newly born compact object ( de rjula 1987 ) . the free - fall time from a parent stellar radius @xmath33 into an object of mass @xmath34 is : @xmath35^{1/2 } } } \\nonumber \\\\ & & { \\rm \\sim 1\\ ; day\\ ; \\left[{r_\\star\\over 10^{12}\\;cm}\\right]^{3/2}\\ ;      \\left[{1.4\\;m_\\odot\\over m_c}\\right]^{1/2}}\\ , .",
    "\\label{tfall}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    for a parent star that rotates , this time would be longer , but for the material that falls from the polar regions .",
    "it is quite natural to suppose that the infalling material settles into an orbiting disk , or a thick torus if its mass is comparable to @xmath34 .",
    "we assume that , as in other cases of significant accretion into a compact object ( microquasars and agns ) , jets of relativistic cbs of plasma are ejected .",
    "we presume their composition to be `` baryonic '' , as it is in the jets of ss 433 , from which ly@xmath36 and fe k@xmath36 lines have been detected ( margon 1984 ) , although the violence of the relativistic jetting - process may break many nuclei into their constituents .    in our admittedly sketchy model of the grb engine",
    ", the time structure of the @xmath37-ray signal will be essentially that of the ejections .",
    "the energies of the grb subpulses and the `` waiting times '' between them are nearly proportional ( e.g. van paradijs et al .",
    "this is indicative of a process , such as discontinuous accretion , in which the `` reservoir '' must be replenished .",
    "let `` jet '' stand for the ensemble of cbs emitted in one direction in a sn event .",
    "if a momentum imbalance between the opposite - direction jets is responsible for the large peculiar velocities @xmath38 ( lyne and lorimer 1994 ) of neutron stars born in sne , the jet kinetic energy must be , as we shall assume for our grb engine , @xmath39 erg ( e.g. dar and plaga 1999 ) . for this choice",
    "the jet mass is relatively small : @xmath40 , or @xmath41 for the lorentz factor @xmath42 that we independently estimate from the grbs beaming angle , from the average fluence per pulse observed by batse in grbs , and from the typical duration of these pulses .",
    "the large peculiar velocities of pulsars may have been acquired well after their birth , in a `` second '' transition of the cooled and spun - down neutron star to a strange star or a quark star ( dar and de rjula 2000b ) . in that case @xmath43",
    "km s@xmath44 ought to be used : the observed velocity of young pulsars , millisecond pulsars and stellar black holes in binaries and isolation ( e.g. toscano et al . 1999 and references therein ) .",
    "the typical jet energy would then be @xmath45 erg and our results would have to be accordingly scaled , but their dependence on @xmath46 is weak and the conclusions are unaffected .",
    "there are other events in which a variety of grbs could be produced by mechanisms similar to the ones we have discussed : large mass accretion episodes in binaries including a compact object , mergers of neutron stars with neutron stars or black holes , the `` second transitions '' just discussed , etc . in each case",
    ", the ejected cannonballs would make grbs by hitting stellar winds or envelopes , circumstellar mass or light .",
    "we discuss only core - collapse sn explosions , as the grbs they would produce by our mechanism , although relatively `` standard '' , satisfactorily reproduce the general properties of the heterogeneous ensemble of grbs .",
    "the making of a grb is illustrated in fig .",
    "3 . in the time after core collapse @xmath47 day , as in eq .",

    "if the cbs expand with a velocity @xmath50 in their rest system ( @xmath51 for a relativistic plasma ) , by the time they hit the sn shell their transverse radius has grown to @xmath52 , or @xmath53 for @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",

    "the ensemble of cbs ( for which @xmath62 ) certainly blows a passage through the sn shell , but , for f sufficiently small , the leading cbs are significantly decelerated by the shell , opening up the possibility of cbs colliding and merging after they exit the shell , which complicates the nature and time structure of the grb signal .",
    "the fraction of the sn shell surface that is blown up by a cb is only @xmath63 , so that it appears unlikely that the cbs are aimed precisely enough to hit the very same place : cb pile - up may be the exception , not the rule .",
    "the collisions of the cb nuclei whose energy is @xmath64(1 ) tev with those in the sn shell produce hadronic cascades .",
    "the sn shell and the cb are transparent to the neutrinos , semitransparent to the muons and opaque to the photons constituting these cascades .",

    "it becomes transparent and emits its internal radiation , collimated and boosted by the cb s motion and observed in the form of mev @xmath37-rays : one of the pulses that constitute a grb .",

    "hence , we skip a more detailed discussion of the spectral properties of grbs ( dar and de rjula , 2000a ) to concentrate on the issue of superluminal motion of the afterglow s source .",
    "far from their parent sne , the cbs are slowed down by the interstellar medium ( ism ) they sweep , which has been previously ionized by the forward - beamed cb radiation ( travelling essentially at @xmath85 , the cb is `` catching up '' with this radiation , so that the ism has no time to recombine ) . as in the jets and lobes of quasars ,",

    ", the system has been last observed in february 1999 by atca ( australia telescope compact array ) to have @xmath142  mjy flux density ( frail et al .",
    "it approached a power - law time decline with a power - law index -1.47 .",
    "if a sedov - taylor break in the radio afterglow of grb 980425 has not occurred yet , its spectral density may still be strong enough to determine its position with vla and vlbi to better than mas precision .",
    "if the second peak is the grb s afterglow , the two radio centroids should now be separated by @xmath160 mas ( or by @xmath161 mas , if the first peak is the afterglow ) . a refined location from a reanalysis of the early atca observations ( kulkarni et al 1998a ; frail et al . 1999 ) of the initial sn and of the late afterglow",
    "may also reveal a superluminal displacement .",
    "if the grb afterglow has entered the late fast - decline phase seen in some grb afterglows and in quasar and microquasar `` afterglows '' from jetted ejections ( observed power - law index @xmath162 ) , a further delay in follow - up observations can make it very difficult or impossible to detect and resolve the grb / snr radio image into its two predicted images .",
    "a grb as close as grb 980425 ( z = 0.0085 ) should occur only once every @xmath163 years . for typical grbs ( @xmath164 )",
    "there is no hope of resolving them with hst into two separate sn and grb images .",
    "resolving them with vlbi would also be arduous .",
    "for these reasons , we exhort interested observers to consider immediate high - resolution optical ( stis ) and radio ( vla and vlbi ) follow - up observations of sn1998bw and the afterglow of grb980425 .",
    "we have argued that grbs and their afterglows may be produced by the firing of extremely relativistic cannonballs in sn explosions . for the grb to be observable , the cbs must be close to the line of sight , implying that their afterglows would appear to move superluminally .",
    "only one of the located grbs ( 980425 ) is close enough to us for this superluminal displacement to be observable with the currently available resolution .",
    "its afterglow may by now have reached a `` break '' and be too dim to be seen . or it may not",
    ". if observed , the superluminal displacement of this grb s afterglow would be a decisive card in favour of cannonballs , as opposed to stationary fireballs .",

    "<S> recent observations suggest that the long - duration gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) and their afterglows are produced by highly relativistic jets emitted in supernova explosions . </S>",
    "<S> we propose that the result of the event is not just a compact object plus the ejecta : within a day , a fraction of the parent star falls back to produce a thick accretion disk . </S>",
    "<S> the subsequent accretion generates jets and constitutes the grb `` engine '' , as in the observed ejection of relativistic `` cannonballs '' of plasma by microquasars and active galactic nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> the grb is produced as the jetted cannonballs exit the supernova shell reheated by the collision , re - emitting their own radiation and boosting the light of the shell . </S>",
    "<S> they decelerate by sweeping up interstellar matter , which is accelerated to cosmic - ray energies and emits synchrotron radiation : the afterglow . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize here a smoking - gun signature of this model of grbs : the superluminal motion of the afterglow , that can be searched for the sooner the better in the particular case of grb 980425 . </S>"
