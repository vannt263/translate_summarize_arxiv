    "kernel density estimation ( kde ) is such a ubiquitous and fundamental technique in statistics that our claim in this paper of an interesting and useful new contribution to the enormous body of literature ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) almost inevitably entails some degree of hubris .",
    "even the idea of using kde to determine the multimodal structure of a probability density function ( henceforth simply called `` density '' ) has by now a long history @xcite that has very recently been explicitly coupled with ideas of topological persistence @xcite .    in this paper , we take precisely the opposite course and use the multimodal structure of a density to perform bandwidth selection for kde , an approach we call _ topological density estimation _ ( tde ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in  [ sec : topologicaldensityestimation ] , we outline tde via the enabling construction of unimodal category and the corresponding decomposition detailed in @xcite . in  [ sec : evaluation ] , we evaluate tde along the same lines as @xcite and show that it offers advantages over its competitors for highly multimodal densities , despite requiring no parameters or nontrivial configuration choices . finally , in  [ sec : remarks ] we make some remarks on tde . scripts and code used to produce our results",
    "are included in appendices , as are additional figures .",
    "surprisingly , our simple idea of combining the ( already topological ) notion of unimodal category with ideas of topological persistence @xcite has not hitherto been considered in the literature , though the related idea of combining multiresolution analysis with kde is well - established @xcite .",
    "the work closest in spirit to ours appears to be @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , in which the idea of using persistent homology to simultaneously estimate the support of a compactly supported ( typically multivariate ) density and a bandwidth for a compact kernel was explored . in particular , our work also takes the approach of simultaneously estimating a topological datum and selecting a kernel bandwidth in a mutually reinforcing way .",
    "furthermore , in the particular case where a density is a convex combination of widely separated unimodal densities , their constructions and ours will manifest some similarity , and in general using a kernel with compact support would allow the techniques of @xcite and the present paper to be used in concert .",
    "however , our technique is in most ways much simpler and kde in one dimension typically features situations in which the support of the underlying density is or can be assumed to be topologically trivial , so we do not explore this integration here .",
    "let @xmath0 denote the space of continuous densities on @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath2 is _ unimodal _ if @xmath3 is contractible ( within itself ) for all @xmath4 .",
    "the _ unimodal category _",
    "@xmath5 is the least integer such that there exist unimodal densities @xmath6 for @xmath7 and @xmath8 with @xmath9 and @xmath10 : we call the rhs a _ unimodal decomposition _ of @xmath11 ( see figure [ fig : unidec ] ) .",
    "that is , @xmath5 is the minimal number of unimodal components whose convex combination yields @xmath11 . for example , in practice the unimodal category of a gaussian mixture model is usually ( but not necessarily ) the number of components .",
    "note that while a unimodal decomposition is very far from unique , the unimodal category is a topological invariant . for",
    ", let @xmath12 be a homeomorphism : then since @xmath13 , it follows that @xmath11 is unimodal iff @xmath14 is . in situations where there is no preferred coordinate system ( such as in , e.g. , certain problems of distributed sensing ) , the analytic details of a density are irrelevant , whereas the topologically invariant features such as the unimodal category are essential .",
    "the essential idea of tde is this : given a kernel @xmath15 and sample data @xmath16 for @xmath17 , for each proposed bandwidth @xmath18 , compute the density estimate @xmath19 and subsequently @xmath20 the concomitant estimate of the unimodal category is @xmath21 where @xmath22 denotes an appropriate measure ( nominally lebesgue measure ) .",
    "now @xmath23 is the set of bandwidths consistent with the estimated unimodal category .",
    "tde amounts to choosing the bandwidth @xmath24    that is , we look for the largest set @xmath23 where @xmath25 is constant  i.e . , where the value of the unimodal category is the most prevalent ( and usually in practice , also _",
    "persistent_)and pick as bandwidth the central element of @xmath23 .",
    "in this section , we evaluate the performance of tde and compare it to other methods following @xcite .",
    "however , in the present context it is also particularly relevant to estimate highly multimodal densities .",
    "sharp peaks and highly oscillating functions [ because they ] should not be tackled with kernels anyway . ''",
    "we feel that this reasoning is debatable in light of the qualitative performance and runtime advantages of tde on highly multimodal densities with a number of samples sufficient to plausibly permit good estimates . ] towards that end we also consider the following family : @xmath29 for @xmath30 and @xmath31 ( see figure [ fig : fkm ] ) .              as in @xcite ,",
    "all results below are based on @xmath52 simulation runs and sample sizes @xmath53 , noting that values @xmath54 were evaluated but not explicitly shown in the results of @xcite .",
    "we consider both gaussian and epanechnikov kernels , and it turns out to be broadly sufficient to consider just tde and ordinary least - squares cross - validation kde ( cv ) .    before discussing the results",
    ", we finally note that it is necessary to deviate slightly from the evaluation protocol of @xcite in one respect that is operationally insignificant but conceptually essential . because tde hinges on identifying a persistent unimodal category , selecting bandwidths from the sparse set of 25 logarithmically spaced points from @xmath55 to @xmath56 used across methods in @xcite is fundamentally inappropriate for evaluating the potential of tde .",
    "instead , we use ( for both cv and tde ) the general data - adaptive bandwidth set @xmath57 , where @xmath58 and @xmath59 denotes the sampled data . , with details determined ( as usual ) by the problem at hand .",
    "while it may be reasonable to dispense with constant spacing in a bandwidth set , it is absolutely essential to have enough members of the set to give persistent results . ]",
    "the results of cv and tde on the family are summarized in figures [ fig : hsscomparisongauss ] and [ fig : hsscomparisonepan ] .",
    "results of cv and tde on the family for @xmath60 are summarized in figures [ fig : fkmeval500matlab]-[fig : fkmeval200matlabtop ] , and results for @xmath61 are summarized in figures [ fig : fkmeval100matlab]-[fig : fkmeval25matlabtop ] in  [ sec : smallsamples ] .",
    "while tde underperforms cv on the six densities in , it is still competitive on the three multimodal densities @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 when using a gaussian kernel",
    ". as we shall see below using , the relative performance of tde improves with increasing multimodality , to the point that it eventually outperforms cv on qualitative criteria such as the number of local maxima and the unimodal category itself .    the relative performance of tde is better with a gaussian kernel than with an epanechnikov kernel : this pattern persists for the family .",
    "indeed , the relative tendency of tde to underestimate @xmath41 diminishes if a gaussian versus an epanechnikov kernel is used .    as the degree of multimodality increases , the relative tendency of tde to underestimate @xmath41 eventually disappears altogether , and the performance of tde is only slightly worse than that of cv .",
    "meanwhile , @xcite shows that cv outperforms all the other methods considered there with respect to @xmath41 .",
    "therefore we can conclude that tde offers very competitive performance for @xmath41 ( or @xmath42 ) for highly multimodal densities .    since cv is expressly designed to minimize the expected value of @xmath43 ( i.e. , @xmath44 )",
    ", it is hardly surprising that tde does not perform as well in this respect .",
    "however , it is remarkable that tde is still so competitive for the distribution of @xmath43 : indeed , the performance of both techniques is barely distinguishable in many of the multimodal cases .",
    "furthermore , the convergence of tde with increasing @xmath65 is clearly comparable to that of cv , which along with its derivatives has the best convergence properties among the techniques in @xcite . while @xcite points out that cv gives worse values for @xmath45 than competing methods , the performance gap there is fairly small , and so we can conclude that tde again offers competitive performance for @xmath43 ( or @xmath44 and @xmath45 ) for highly multimodal densities .    the only respect in which cv offers a truly qualitative advantage over tde for highly multimodal densities is @xmath66 ( or its surrogates @xmath47 and @xmath48 ) .",
    "however , there is still considerable overlap in the distributions for tde and cv , and for multimodal densities and sample sizes of @xmath67 or more , cv offers nearly the best performance in this respect of all the techniques considered in @xcite .",
    "therefore we can conclude that tde offers reasonable though not competitive performance for @xmath66 ( or @xmath47 and @xmath48 ) for highly multimodal densities .",
    "the preceding considerations show that tde is competitive overall with other methods  though still clearly not optimal  for highly multimodal densities ( and sample sizes sufficient in principle to resolve the modes ) when traditional statistical evaluation criteria are used .",
    "however , when _ qualitative _ criteria such as the number of local maxima and the unimodal category itself are considered , tde outperforms cv for highly multimodal densities ( see figures [ fig : fkmeval500matlabtop ] and [ fig : fkmeval200matlabtop ] ) . in practice ,",
    "such qualitative criteria are generally of paramount importance .",
    "for example , precisely estimating the shape of a density is generally less important than determining if it has two or more clearly separable modes .",
    "perhaps the most impressive feature of tde , and one that cv is essentially alone in sharing with it , is the fact that tde requires no free parameters or assumptions .",
    "indeed , tde can be used to evaluate its own suitability : for unimodal distributions , it is clearly not an ideal choice  but it is good at detecting this situation in the first place .",
    "in fact while for @xmath68 cv is uniformly better at determining unimodality , for @xmath69 the situation has reversed , with tde uniformly better at determining unimodality ."
