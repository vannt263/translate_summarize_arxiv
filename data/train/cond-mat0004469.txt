    "recent advances in the trapping techniques have renewed interest in various aspects of many body theory .",
    "in fact a cloud of weakly interacting trapped atoms is an ideal system for which various aspects of many body theory can be tested and verified .",
    "the ideal bosonic gas undergoes the bose - einstein condensation if the phase - space density exceeds one .",
    "this phenomenon manifests itself by the macroscopic occupation of the single particle ground state . in the case of an interacting system",
    "the condensate wave function can be defined by the spectral decomposition of the one - body density matrix .",
    "this decomposition is closely related to the off - diagonal long range order @xcite or the existence of the order parameter , i.e. , the ` classical ' field with given amplitude and phase commonly used in the theory of superfluidity @xcite .",
    "realization of decomposition procedure is practically impossible because it requires a full solution of the many - body problem .",
    "mean - field approaches are commonly used instead . the basic idea for a mean - field description of the dilute , weakly interacting bose gas below transition temperature",
    "was introduced by bogoliubov @xcite .",
    "most of the results for the interacting bose - einstein condensate are obtained within the bogoliubov theory which in many cases provides a reliable quantitative description of the quantum bose gas .",
    "indeed , the low energy excitation spectrum of the trapped condensate well below transition temperature @xcite agrees remarkably well with predictions based on the bogoliubov theory @xcite . on the other hand",
    "the mean - field bogoliubov approach fails to reproduce excitation spectrum at higher temperatures  close to the transition point @xcite .",
    "therefore , the question about limits of validity of the bogoliubov method is of great importance .",
    "one possible way to test the quality of this approximation is to go beyond the mean field theory .",
    "another possibility to assess the usefulness of bogoliubov s theory is to study the exactly soluble models and to compare their predictions with those based on the approximate method .",
    "the models provide not only a unique soluble many body problem but also allow to verify various approximations .",
    "this will shed some light on the validity and exactness of the bogoliubov method , widely used in many body physics @xcite .",
    "there are only few exactly soluble models of quantum systems where the interactions between atoms is chosen in the form allowing for the exact analytic solution .",
    "these are : ( i ) the one - dimensional model of impenetrable bosons introduced by girardeau @xcite , ( ii ) its contact potential version formulated by lieb @xcite ; ( iii ) the model of particles interacting by harmonic forces @xcite .",
    "although in the first two cases the formal solution is given but in practice the problem is still quite complicated and quantitative calculations can be done for a very small number of particles only @xcite .",
    "the latter case seems to be much simpler because , as it has been shown in @xcite , it can be reduced to the problem of noninteracting particles in a harmonic trap . therefore in the following we are going to examine , within this exactly soluble model , various concepts and methods related to the interacting bose - einstein condensate .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we present exact results regarding properties of harmonically interacting bosons trapped within harmonic potential .",
    "the results are obtained within a soluble model that was developed in @xcite . in the second part of sec .",
    "ii we find the analytic expression for the order parameter and study the effect of quantum depletion of the condensate as well as quantum fluctuations at zero temperature .",
    "in the third part we analyze the thermal properties of the system . in sec .",
    "iii we apply the bogoliubov method to our model . within this approximation",
    "we first determine a condensate wave function and an excitation spectrum . using the bogoliubov spectrum",
    "we calculate occupation of the condensate and its fluctuation at finite temperatures .",
    "we compare these mean - field results to the results obtained within the exact model .",
    "we finish in sec .",
    "iv with some concluding remarks .",
    "in our previous paper @xcite we have shown the algebraic method of diagonalization of the hamiltonian describing a system of many particles interacting via harmonic forces .",
    "the system under consideration consists of many particles confined by an external harmonic potential interacting by harmonic forces , i.e. , two body interaction potential has the form : @xmath0 where @xmath1 defines the interaction strength and @xmath2 signifies the attractive interaction of particles placed at positions @xmath3 and @xmath4 whereas @xmath5  corresponds to repulsive interactions .",
    "the total hamiltonian of the @xmath6-particle system has therefore the following form : @xmath7    let us first recall the exact results of @xcite . for the sake of simplicity",
    "we denote the set of all particle positions vectors by @xmath8 .",
    "the hamiltonian can be easily diagonalized if one introduces collective variables : @xmath9 where @xmath10 and the matrix @xmath11 is orthogonal .",
    "one of these collective variables namely the center of mass of @xmath6-particle system plays a particularly important role : @xmath12 the choice of @xmath13 remaining collective variables @xmath14 is not unique but this does not lead to any physical implications .",
    "in particular : @xmath15 in the following we are going to use a similar notation for description of a subsystem of @xmath16-particles , @xmath17 .",
    "the above - defined transformation brings the hamiltonian to the diagonal form and its eigenenergies can be easily found . while determining a spectrum , however , one must take into account the proper symmetry of a total wave function . in the case of bosonic particles ( @xmath18 )",
    "the allowed energies are : @xmath19 where @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the first term describes excitations of the center of mass , i.e. , @xmath23-dimensional harmonic oscillator of frequency equal to one . the second term in the eq .",
    "( [ spec ] ) corresponds to excitations of @xmath13 relative degrees of freedom .",
    "the frequency @xmath24 characterizes some effective potential felt by an individual quasi - particle because it results from a combined effect of all particles of our system .",
    "let us observe that @xmath25 corresponds to the noninteracting case , the repulsive interactions give @xmath26 while attractive forces lead to @xmath27 .",
    "moreover , very small values of @xmath28 signify very strong repulsion which almost destabilizes the whole system .",
    "it is very convenient to parameterize @xmath24 by an exponent @xmath29 defined in the following way : @xmath30 this exponent can be related to the actual strength of the interaction .",
    "in fact , for weakly interacting gas ( @xmath31 ) we obtain very small values of this parameter : @xmath32 , while for strong interactions ( @xmath28  repulsion , @xmath33  attraction ) we have @xmath34 .",
    "moreover , @xmath29 is positive in the case of attraction while it is negative for repulsion .",
    "let us add at this point that in realistic situations of short - range interparticle interactions , large bose - einstein condensates can exist only for repulsive forces .",
    "in the case of attraction the size of the trapped condensate is limited to about 1500 atoms @xcite . in our oscillatory model",
    "the forces between particles are negligible at small distances , therefore the model leads to the condensation ( in the thermodynamic limit ) in both attractive and repulsive case .",
    "the ground state of the system is the following : @xmath35 where @xmath36 and the function @xmath37 corresponds to the ground state of a system of @xmath13 independent quasi - particles ( in @xmath23 spatial dimensions ) interacting with an external potential of the harmonic oscillator of frequency @xmath24 : @xmath38,\\ ] ] and @xmath39 is the ground state of the single particle ( center of mass ) trapped into harmonic potential : @xmath40.\\ ] ] construction of excited eigenstates is difficult because it is not easy to impose the desired symmetry on the wave function .",
    "such a procedure was describe in details in @xcite .",
    "if the energy of the system ( or equivalently the temperature ) is sufficiently small we expect that the system forms a bose - einstein condensate .",
    "the bec of the ideal gas manifests itself by a macroscopic occupation of the single particle ground state . in the case of interacting system",
    "it is not obvious what is this particular state which is ` macroscopically occupied ' .",
    "the identification of the macroscopically occupied quantum state is equivalent to the definition of the order parameter  the single particle wave function which is inherently related to the bose condensation .",
    "the condensate subsystem can be then quite accurately described by the @xmath41-fold product of the order parameter , where @xmath42 is the occupation of the condensate . in the conventional approaches , for example in the bogoliubov method",
    ", it is simply assumed that a mean value of the boson field operator is different than zero and this mean value is associated with the macroscopically occupied state .",
    "then , consistently with the above assumption , the bogoliubov equations give in fact the nonzero solution for the order parameter .",
    "however , because of the superselection rules ( resulting from the conservation of the barionic charge ) any @xmath6-particle system must be in the fock state ",
    "the state with a well defined particle number .",
    "therefore the mean value of the boson field operator _ must vanish _ in this state as the field operator changes the number of particles .    in the following we use our model to demonstrate how to define the order parameter , occupation of the condensate , and its fluctuations . at zero temperature",
    "the system is in the ground state and one might naively expect that it is totally bose condensated .",
    "however , the ground state of the n - particle bosonic system is not equivalent to the bose - einstein condensate .",
    "interactions can significantly deplete the condensate .",
    "we are going to show this effect in the most spectacular but also in relatively simple case of the zero temperature .",
    "let us now define the hierarchy of the reduced @xmath16-particle density matrices which can be conventionally obtained by averaging the density matrix of the total system of @xmath6 particles over the degrees of freedom of @xmath43 remaining particles . for a given @xmath6-particle quantum state @xmath44",
    "the corresponding @xmath16-particle reduced density matrix @xmath45 is defined by : @xmath46 we use previously defined shorthand notation for vectors in a configuration space of @xmath16-particles .",
    "the reduced density matrix describes the subsystem of @xmath16-particles and can be directly related to different measurement processes . for the statistical description of the system one should first of all define the statistical density matrix by averaging all @xmath6-particle density matrices with the appropriate statistical weights depending on the ensemble .",
    "in general it is quite a complicated task but at zero temperature there is only one quantum state of the system and no statistical averaging is necessary .",
    "the total wave function ( or density matrix ) carries all the information about the system . in real experiments",
    "however one does not probe simultaneously all the particles .",
    "typical detection scheme consists on the measurement of one or at most few particles at a given time .",
    "in other words a single measurement process is reduced to a subsystem of small number of particles .",
    "such subsystems are described by reduced density matrices . in the considered here case of zero temperature the description of the interacting system",
    "the @xmath16-particle density matrix can be brought to the following form : @xmath47 the functions @xmath48 describes the ground state of @xmath49 quasi - particles ( collective relative coordinates , see eq.([phirel ] ) ) while @xmath50 corresponds to the density matrix of center of mass of the subsystem : @xmath51   \\nonumber \\\\ & & { \\rm exp}\\left [ -\\frac{1}{2 }        \\left(\\omega_s + \\frac{\\delta_s}{2}\\right )        \\left[({\\bf x}^c_s)^2 + ( { \\bf y}^c_s)^2 \\right ] \\right ] . \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the @xmath16-particles collective coordinates are defined in the familiar way : @xmath52 , @xmath53 and frequencies @xmath54 , @xmath55 as well as auxiliary parameter @xmath56 are : @xmath57    having defined the @xmath16-particle matrices we are ready now to analyze the nature of the bose - einstein condensation of the interacting system and to discuss the meaning of the order parameter . to this end",
    "we write the density matrix eq.([s - part ] ) in the diagonal form : @xmath58 the function @xmath59 can be treated as the wave function of the @xmath16-particle subsystem : @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the ground state wave function of the relative degrees of freedom .",
    "this function corresponds to the ground state of @xmath49 noninteracting quasi - particles ( in @xmath23-spatial dimensions ) subject to the external harmonic potential of frequency @xmath24 . the second part of the eq .",
    "( [ cm ] ) describes states of the center of mass of @xmath16-particles ; @xmath62 is simply the @xmath23-dimensional harmonic oscillator wave function corresponding to the effective center of mass frequency @xmath63 .",
    "quantum numbers @xmath64 label different states of the center of mass while @xmath65 corresponds to the energy of the given state .",
    "the effective center of mass frequency @xmath63 is : @xmath66^{1/2}.\\ ] ] it is interesting to observe that all the frequencies of the relative motion of the @xmath16-particles subsystem are exactly the same as the frequencies of the relative motion of the whole system , i.e. , equal to @xmath24 . on the other hand",
    "the center of mass oscillation frequency of the subsystem is neither equal to @xmath24 nor to 1 ( trap frequency ) .",
    "this collective degree of freedom couples to the center of mass of @xmath43 remaining particles what leads to some energy shift .",
    "finally , the eigenvalues @xmath67 of @xmath68 are equal to the occupation probabilities of a given @xmath16-particle state : @xmath69 it follows from the normalization condition for the density matrix that @xmath70 .",
    "the spectral decomposition of the reduced single particle density matrix gives natural single - particles states @xmath71 .",
    "these states are crucial for the definition of the condensate wave function ( order parameter ) .",
    "it can be seen from eq.([lambda ] ) that if @xmath6 goes to infinity ( thermodynamic limit ) with fixed value of the interaction frequency @xmath24 the lowest eigenvalue @xmath72 dominates the others : @xmath73 this behavior signifies nothing else but the onset of the bose - einstein condensation .",
    "the single particle density matrix becomes very close to the pure state because with quite good accuracy it can be approximated by @xmath74 .",
    "this particular single - particle ground state @xmath75 is usually called the order parameter",
    ". the @xmath6-particle wave function can be quite accurately approximated by the @xmath6-fold product of the order parameter .    above the critical temperature",
    "the situation is completely different , namely all eigenvalues of @xmath76 should be close to zero what means that the single particle reduced density matrix is ` very far ' from the pure state and order parameter vanishes  there is no leading state in the spectral decomposition of the single - particle density matrix .",
    "7.5 cm    our analytic formula allows to study quantitatively the role of interactions on the bose - einstein condensate . on the basis of the discussion it is obvious that the average occupation of the condensate becomes : @xmath77 in the case of the ideal gas at zero temperature",
    "the above equation gives , of course , @xmath78 ; all particles occupy the single particle ground state .",
    "for a fixed number of particles , if the interaction strength @xmath79 grows , the occupation of the condensate decreases .",
    "this behavior is presented in fig . 1 where we show the mean occupation of the condensate versus the exponent @xmath80 for different values of particle number @xmath6 in three spatial dimensions ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "the values of @xmath29 less than zero signify repulsive interactions while @xmath82 corresponds to attraction .",
    "one can easily see that if the interaction becomes strong ( @xmath83 ) the condensate is almost totally depleted .",
    "all curves presented in the figure tend to an universal curve if the number of particles increases .",
    "when @xmath6 increases to infinity with @xmath29 being constant then our expression for the occupation of the condensate has the form : @xmath84 the above formula , valid in the thermodynamic limit , gives an universal critical behavior .",
    "it exhibits no depletion ( @xmath85 ) for @xmath86 followed by an abrupt jump and total destruction of the condensate ( @xmath87 ) for @xmath88 .",
    "the effect of quantum depletion of the trapped atomic condensate with a short range interactions , for the realistic experimental parameters , has been estimated to be of the order of @xmath89 @xcite .",
    "this is opposite to the case of superfluid helium where this effect accounts for depletion as large as more than @xmath90 @xcite .",
    "our model exhibits very interesting feature .",
    "it shows that in large @xmath6 limit the quantum effects are almost negligible or totally destroy the condensate depending on the value of the interaction strength . at this point",
    "it is not clear if this is an unique feature of our model or if it is a more general result .",
    "we see that interactions play an important role .",
    "if they are strong , the condensate disappears although the @xmath6-particle system remains in its ground state .",
    "there is no coherence in the strongly interacting system , i.e. , no wave function can be assign to a single particle subsystem . at this point",
    "we want to make a comment about the notion of the coherence of the bose - einstein condensate .",
    "approximate methods assume explicitly that the mean value of the boson field operator is different from zero in the case of the bose - einstein condensate .",
    "therefore , the folk wisdom associates the condensate with the coherent state  the analog of the coherent state of the electromagnetic field .",
    "this analogy is of limited value and in fact may be misleading because the condensate must be in a fock state in which a mean value the field operator vanishes .",
    "however there is coherence in the condensate in the sense that majority of particles are described by the same wave function with the same phase .",
    "the expression for this wave function can be obtained rigorously only when one considers the single particle reduced density matrix .",
    "the 2-particle reduced density matrix allows to find a joint probability of finding one particle in a given single particle state and simultaneously another particle in another given state .",
    "in particular we have : @xmath91 simple integration gives : @xmath92 now we are ready to analyze the fluctuations of the condensate defined as : @xmath93 these fluctuations are shown in fig.2 . we see that as the interaction strength grows up ( at fixed number of particles ) the fluctuations start to grow from zero value for the ideal gas .",
    "however when the interactions become so strong that condensate practically disappears ( @xmath83 ) fluctuations also decrease - as there is no condensate the fluctuations also die out .",
    "the fluctuations are maximal in a region of the critical destruction of the condensate by quantum effects .",
    "7.5 cm      in this subsection we estimate , within the exact model , some effects in finite - temperature behavior of the trapped gas .",
    "rigorous description of the condensate requires a knowledge of the statistical density matrix of the @xmath6-particle system . knowing this matrix one can apply the procedure described previously to define the finite temperature condensate , its occupation and fluctuations .",
    "however , because of a huge degeneracy of high energy states the statistical averaging procedure is difficult .",
    "therefore , we limit our study to the case of weak interactions ( @xmath94 ) when we can neglect the quantum effects leading to a significant depletion of the condensate . in this case",
    "we can expect that the condensate wave function in a finite temperature is equal to the ground state of the harmonic oscillator with some effective frequency ( characterizing a mean field experienced by a single particle ) which at @xmath95 is equal to @xmath96 . in the case of a weak interaction",
    "this frequency can be approximated by @xmath97 .",
    "we expect that , similarly to the noninteracting case , the main effect of the temperature is to deplete the condensate rather than modify the condensate wave function , i.e. , the frequency @xmath96 .    as it has been shown in @xcite , the trace of the density matrix of the @xmath6-particle system , i.e. , the microcanonical partition function @xmath98 is identical ( in the thermodynamic limit ) to the microcanonical partition function @xmath99 of the @xmath6 noninteracting bosonic particles ( quasi particles ) trapped by the harmonic potential of frequency @xmath24 : @xmath100 the effect of the center - of - mass excitations on the spectrum and on the statistical properties of the system is negligible since it is related to only one degree of freedom as compared to the @xmath13 remaining collective degrees of freedom .",
    "this fact , together with our remarks about the condensate wave function , signifies that the system of interacting ( via harmonic forces ) particles is , in the thermodynamic limit , equivalent to the ideal gas in the oscillatory trap .",
    "this observation allows to recall all results obtained for the ideal bose gas @xcite .",
    "in particular , considered here interacting system undergoes the bose - einstein condensation at the temperature @xmath101 equal to : @xmath102 where the @xmath103 is the riemann function , @xmath104 .",
    "this critical temperature should be compared to the critical temperature of the noninteracting system , @xmath105 the shift of the critical temperature @xmath106 is therefore equal to : @xmath107 it is negative in the case of repulsive interaction and has the opposite sign for the attractive system what is in a qualitative agreement with results of ref .",
    "@xcite for the system of trapped atoms .",
    "the critical temperature for the trapped gas with repulsive interactions is decreased as compared to the noninteracting case : due to interactions a mean separation between particles grows , therefore the quantum statistical effects become important at larger de broglie wavelength .",
    "it is worth to stress that the transition temperature for the system with short range interactions remains a controversial subject even in the uniform case @xcite .",
    "there is no consensus how the shift of the temperature should depend on the interaction strength , nor even the sign .",
    "the fraction of condensate particles @xmath108 is : @xmath109 it is known that the critical temperature and mean occupation of the ground state do not depend on the statistical ensemble used for the description of the system .",
    "the value of the fluctuations of the number of the particles in the condensate calculated for different statistical ensembles differ significantly @xcite . in the canonical ensemble",
    "the square of the fluctuations @xmath110 is : @xmath111 where @xmath112 . in the case of perfectly isolated system ( microcanonical ensemble )",
    "fluctuations of the ground state occupation are smaller than canonical ones @xcite : @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "in realistic cases the exact solution of the many - body schrdinger equation is impossible . instead , mean - field approaches are being developed .",
    "the basic idea of the mean - field theory was introduced by bogoliubov .",
    "we will now formulate the bogoliubov approximation in the case of inhomogeneous systems @xcite .",
    "next we find the energy spectrum within this approximation for our exactly solvable model . in order to do this we rewrite the hamiltonian ( [ a0 ] ) using the second quantization formalism .",
    "thus we introduce the field operator @xmath115 which annihilates a particle at a point @xmath116 and its conjugate @xmath117 which creates a particle at a point @xmath116 .",
    "these operators fulfill standard bosonic commutation relations : @xmath118 = \\delta ( { \\bf x}-{\\bf x}^{\\prime } ) .\\ ] ] in the second quantization formalism the hamiltonian becomes : @xmath119 where @xmath120    the bogoliubov approximation is formulated in two steps .",
    "the first one is to express the field operator as a sum of its mean value @xmath121 and an operator @xmath122 responsible for the fluctuations around the mean value . below the bose - einstein condensation temperature",
    "the occupation of the ground state is nonzero .",
    "it is therefore convenient to write @xmath123 note that now the mean value of the field operator @xmath115 is not equal to zero and is proportional to the square root of the number of condensed particles @xmath41 .",
    "the spirit of the bogoliubov approximation is based on the fact that the occupation of the condensate is of the order of total particles number @xmath124 .",
    "this , in principle , limits the bogoliubov approach to low temperatures . in the following , consistently with the above assumption we will substitute in the eq.([a5 ] ) @xmath41 by @xmath6 . for any physically realizable @xmath6-particle state , and in particular for our solutions of the system eq.([a0 ] ) , the mean value of the field operator is zero .",
    "( strictly , separation of the eq.([a5 ] ) should be done for operators conserving particle number .",
    "however , extracting a @xmath125number part of the field operator has formally the same consequences and is easier to handle ) .",
    "if such a form is substituted into the total hamiltonian eq.([a1 ] ) the number of particles is no longer conserved . to overcome this difficulty one considers the grand canonical hamiltonian instead @xmath126 where @xmath127 is the total particle number operator and @xmath128 is the chemical potential .",
    "it should be chosen in such a way that the mean particle number is equal to the desired value .",
    "self consistent equation for the condensate wave function @xmath129 follows from the assumption that the decomposition ( [ a5 ] ) gives the best self consistent function .",

    "0({\\bf x}^{\\prime } ) .\\ ] ] this equation replaces the standard gross - pitaevskii equation for the condensate wave function .",
    "the effective potential in the eq.([a71 ] ) has different form than usuall nonlinear term appearing in the gross - pitaevskii equation because of long range forces assumed in our model as opposed to the more realistic zero range interactions .    the lowest energy state of the hamiltonian from eq.([a71 ] )",
    "is @xmath132 and the value of chemical potential is @xmath133 .",
    "the function eq.([bwf ] ) is the bogoliubov approximation to the exact order parameter @xmath134 found in the previous section : @xmath135 where the effective frequency @xmath96 in the limit of weak interactions can be approximated by : @xmath136 because the effective frequency @xmath96 is very close to @xmath24 the bogoliubov expression for the condensate wave function is quite accurate in the limit of weak interactions .",
    "however , if the interaction strength is large the bogoliubov method fails to reproduce the condensate wave function .",
    "this is consistent with the basic assumption of the bogoliubov method which requires the order parameter ( multiplied by the mean occupation of the condensate ) to be large .",
    "as we have shown in the previous section this is not the case for strongly interacting system .",
    "the second step in the bogoliubov method is to find the low energy excitation spectrum of the system by expanding the total hamiltonian around the mean value of the field operator given by the solution eq.([bwf ] ) . after substituting the field operator eq.([a5 ] ) into @xmath137 and retaining all terms up to @xmath138 ,",

    "for example , one such pair is : @xmath180 and two others can be obtained by permutations of indices .",
    "the shift in the ground state energy is given by @xmath181    the excitation energies @xmath169 obtained within the bogoliubov approach are the same as exact eigenenergies of the interacting system .",
    "the degeneracies of the eigenenergy state when we compare with ref.@xcite are also the same .",
    "the bogoliubov method is very well suited for the description of the excitation spectrum of the quantum degenerate gas .",
    "this result is somewhat surprising .",
    "one might rather expect that bogoliubov approach works well only for the short range interaction .",
    "our calculation shows that it works also in a rather exotic case when the interaction strength grows quadratically with the distance between particles .",
    "there are some differences between wave functions obtained in the bogoliubov approximation and exact solutions of the @xmath6-particle hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "they come from the fact that the exact solution can not be written as a symmetrized product of any single particle functions .      in this subsection",
    "we consider bose gas at finite temperatures .",
    "we will study the impact of interactions on the occupation of the condensate and its fluctuations using bogoliubov method @xcite .",
    "we will compare the obtained results with those inferred from the exactly soluble model .",
    "the statistical density matrix is @xmath182 , where @xmath137 is the hamiltonian given in eq.([hamiltonian ] ) and @xmath183 is the statistical sum .",
    "this density matrix describes the excited subsystem only ( quasi - particles ) .",
    "number of quasi - particles is not conserved and the condensate is assumed to act as a reservoir of quasi - particles .",
    "in fact all this assumptions are in the spirit of the maxwell s demon ensemble introduced for the description of the ideal gas below the condensation temperature @xcite .",
    "imposing the constraint on the total number of particles implies that occupation and fluctuations of the condensate can be directly related to the mean number and fluctuations of quasi - particles .",
    "the mean number of excitations ( quasi particles ) above the condensed phase @xmath184 is defined as : @xmath185 what leads to the following expression : @xmath186 f_{\\bf n } + v_{\\bf n } ^2({\\bf x})\\right\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath187^{-1}$ ] plays the role of the mean quasi - particle occupation of the given energy state .",
    "the functions @xmath188 and @xmath189 are closely related to the wave functions of harmonic oscillator . the integration can be easily performed but the summation over all eigenstates might be quite difficult because of huge degeneracy of the energy levels .",
    "fortunately , in our case almost all functions @xmath189 vanish and their contribution to the final result is negligible at finite temperatures",
    ". therefore the problem can be easily reduced to the calculation of the canonical occupation of the condensate trapped in the harmonic trap of frequency @xmath24 . again , similarly as in the exact solution we will treat separately the two regimes : ( i ) zero temperature limit where only quantum effects described by the last term of the eq .",
    "( [ mean ] ) affect the condensate population , ( ii ) finite temperature case where the above mentioned effect is negligible .",
    "the occupation of the interacting condensate at zero temperature is : @xmath190 the first term in eq .",
    "( [ qdep ] ) corresponds to the weak interaction limit of the exact result , which is @xmath191 the second term in eq .",
    "( [ qdep ] ) is new .",
    "this additional term overestimates the depletion of the condensate as compared to the rigorous treatment .",
    "therefore the bogoliubov treatment does not describe quantitatively an occupation of the zero temperature condensate .    on the other hand , in the thermodynamic limit",
    ", we recover the familiar expression : @xmath192 this is exactly the same result which we obtained in the exact treatment .",
    "similarly , the critical temperature which can be defined by setting @xmath193 to zero in the eq.([n01 ] ) : @xmath194 is identical to the exact result , eq .",
    ". it might be somewhat surprising but the bogoliubov method works in our case pretty well up to the critical temperature , i.e. , in the region where , in principle , its assumptions are not valid .    in a similar way we can obtain the fluctuations of the condensate population .",
    "because fluctuations , contrary to the mean occupation , depend on the statistical ensemble , we use a notation which explicitly indicates the kind of performed averages ( i.e. , the canonical one ) . as we imposed constraint on the total number of particles , these fluctuations are equal to the fluctuations of the above - condensate part , @xmath195 : @xmath196 ^ 2 ( f^2_{\\bf n } + f^{}_{\\bf n } ) \\right . \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\left.+ 4\\left [ \\int { \\rm d}{\\bf x } u_{\\bf n}^{}({\\bf x})v_{\\bf n}^{}({\\bf x } )           \\right]^2 \\big",
    "( f^2_{\\bf n } + f^{}_{\\bf n}+1 \\big ) \\right\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the last term is responsible for the quantum fluctuations which do not vanish at zero temperature .",
    "again the problem of calculating the condensate fluctuation can be reduced to finding the fluctuations of the ideal trapped bose gas . in the case of zero temperature we have : @xmath197 this formula overestimates ( quite significantly ) the condensate fluctuations due to the quantum effects as compared to the exact results in the limit of weak interaction , eq .",
    "( [ fluk ] ) .    the fluctuations ( in the thermodynamic limit and after neglecting the small quantum fluctuations obtained above ) at finite temperatures are : @xmath198 this result gives the correct value of the thermal fluctuations of the condensate .",
    "the bogoliubov method works very well in predicting the thermal fluctuations of the condensate while it fails to reproduce the correct value of the quantum fluctuation",
    ". it might be surprising as in fact the approach should work in the low temperature region . in our opinion",
    ", it is the substitution of the operator annihilating the lowest energy state by a @xmath125-number that is responsible for inaccurate treatment of some quantum effects , particularly important at zero temperature .",
    "in our paper we used the exactly soluble many - particle model to illustrate the rigorous procedure of defining the condensate phase at zero temperature . by diagonalizing one - particle reduced density matrix",
    "we were able to study in details the role of interactions on the condensate at zero temperature .",
    "if the interaction strength becomes large @xmath199 condensate disappears even when the system is in its ground state .",
    "this total depletion of the condensate has , in the thermodynamic limit , a character of critical phenomena .",
    "the destruction of the condensate signifies a breakdown of the mean - field theory . due to strong quantum correlations",
    "the system can not be viewed as being composed of independent quasi - particles moving in some effective potential resulting from interactions with a rest of the system .",
    "instead the quasi - particles become strongly correlated and simple single - particle picture is not longer valid .",
    "we have also carefully compared the exact quantum solutions of the oscillatory model with the approximate solutions obtained with the help of the gross - pitaevskii equation and bogoliubov approximation .",
    "we have found that many of the characteristics of the exact solutions like the excitation spectrum , occupation of the condensate , and its thermal fluctuations are indeed reproduced with the help of the approximate methods .",
    "the bogoliubov approach fails in the case of very strong interactions when the condensate is almost destroyed .",
    "this is however consistent with the basic assumption of the bogoliubov method which explicitly assumes small condensate depletion and relays on the validity of a mean - field description .",
    "surprisingly , in the studied model , the method works quite well even at temperatures close to the critical one . on the other hand the zero temperature ( quantum ) depletion and fluctuations of the condensate",
    "are not given correctly by the bogoliubov method .",
    "substitution of the destruction operator of the particle in the lowest energy state by a classical field results in inaccurate description of some quantum effects .",
    "fortunately for the weakly interacting system , these effects are small and can be neglected .",
