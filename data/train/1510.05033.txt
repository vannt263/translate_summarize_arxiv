    "it furthermore becomes clear that the directionality of the information transfer in general need not be related to the order in which the oscillators phase - lock because the phase - advanced oscillator can either effectively pull the lagging one , or , as in this example , the lagging oscillator can push the leading one to restore the equilibrium phase - difference .    in summary ,",

    "this establishes several generic mechanisms to globally change information routing in networks via local changes in modular properties , local connectivity , or via switching of local dynamical states .    in a network consisting of two sub - networks ( fig .",

    "is preserved in the dynamics of the entire modular network .",
    "consequently each choice of the @xmath118 possible combinations of `` local '' states gives rise to at least one network - wide collective state .",
    "certain combinations of local states can give rise to one or even multiple globally phase - locked states ( e.g. @xmath119 $ ] in fig .",
    "[ fig : combinatorics ] ) .",
    "others support non - phase locked dynamics that gives rise to time - dependent irps ( cf .",
    "[ fig : combinatorics]c and below ) .",
    "thus , varying local dynamical states in a hierarchical network flexibly produces a combinatorial number @xmath120 of different irps in the same physical network .",
    "general reference states , including periodic or transient dynamics , are not stationary and hence the expressions for the dmi and dte become dependent on time @xmath0 .",

    "[ fig : combinatorics]c shows irps that undergo cyclic changes due to an underlying periodic reference state ( cf .  also supplementary figure 8a - c ) . in systems with a global fixed point",
    "systematic displacements to different starting positions in state space give rise to different stochastic transients with different and time - dependent irps ( supplementary figure  8d ) .",
    "similarly , switching dynamics along heteroclinic orbits constitute another way of generating specific progressions of reference dynamics .",
    "thus information surfing on top of non - stationary reference dynamical configurations naturally yield temporally structured sequences of irps , resolvable also by other measures of instantaneous information flow , e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the above results establish a theoretical basis for the emergence of information routing capabilities in complex networks when signals are communicated on top of collective reference states .",
    "we show how information sharing ( dmi ) and transfer ( dte ) emerge through the joint action of local unit features , global interaction topology and choice of the collective dynamical state .",
    "we find that information routing patterns self - organize according to general principles ( cf .",
    "[ fig : mechanisms ] , [ fig : control ] , [ fig : combinatorics ] ) and can thus be systematically manipulated . employing formal identity of our approach at every scale in oscillatory modular networks ( eq .   vs.  ) we identify local paradigms that are capable of regulating information routing at the non - local level across the whole network ( figs .",
    "[ fig : control ] , [ fig : combinatorics ] ) .",
    "we derived theoretical results based on information sharing and transfer obtained via delayed mutual information and transfer entropy curves . using these abstract measures our results are independent of any particular implementation of a communication protocol and",
    "thus generically demonstrate how collective dynamics can have a functional role in information routing .",
    "for example , in the network in fig .",
    "[ fig : mechanisms ] externally injected streams of information are automatically encoded in fluctuations of the rotation frequency of the individual oscillators .",
    "the injected signals are then transmitted through the network and decodable from the fluctuating phase velocity of a target unit precisely along those pathways predicted by the current state - dependent irp ( supplementary section 7 ) .",
    "our theory is based on a small noise approximation that conditions the analysis onto a specific underlying dynamical state . in this way we extracted the precise role of such a reference state for the network",
    "s information routing abilities . for larger signal amplitudes or in highly recurrent networks in which higher - order interactions can play an important role the expansion can be carried out systematically to higher orders using diagrammatic approaches @xcite or numerically to accounting for better accuracy and non - gaussian correlations ( cf .",
    "also supplementary section 3.4 ) .    in systems with multi - stable states two signal types need to be discriminated : those that encode the information to be routed and those that indicate a switch in the reference dynamics and consequently the irps .",
    "if the second type of stimuli is amplified appropriately a switch between multi - stable states can be induced that moves the network into the appropriate irp state for the signals that follow .",
    "for example , in the network of fig .",
    "[ fig : mechanisms ] a switch from state @xmath49 to @xmath50 can be induced by a strong positive pulse to oscillator @xmath79 ( and vice versa ) .",
    "if such pulses are part of the input a switch to the appropriate irp state will automatically be triggered and the network auto - regulates its irp function .",
    "more generally a separate part of the network that effectively filters out relevant signatures indicating the need for a different irp could provide such pulses .",
    "moreover , using the fact that local interventions are capable to switch irps in the network the outcomes of local computations can be used to trigger changes in the global information routing and thereby enable context - dependent processing in a self - organized way .    when information surfs on top of dynamical reference states the control of irps is shifted towards controlling collective network dynamics making methods from control theory of dynamical systems available to the control of information routing .",
    "for example , changing the interaction function in coupled oscillators systems @xcite or providing control signals to a subset of nodes @xcite are capable of manipulating the network dynamics .",
    "moreover , switch like changes ( cf .",
    "[ fig : control ] ) can be triggered by crossing bifurcation points and the control of information routing patterns then gets linked to bifurcation theory of network dynamical systems .",
    "while the mathematical part of our analysis focused on phase signals , including additional amplitude degrees of freedom into the theoretical framework can help to explore neural or cell signaling codes that simultaneously use activity- and phase - based representations to convey information @xcite .",
    "moreover , separating irp generation , e.g. via phase configurations , from actual information transfer , for instance in amplitude degrees of freedom , might be useful for the design of systems with a flexible communication function .    the predicted phenomena , including non - local changes of information routing by local interventions , could be directly experimentally verified using methods available to date , such as electrochemical arrays @xcite or synthetic gene regulatory networks @xcite ( supplementary section 5.3 ) .",
    "in addition our results are applicable to the inverse problem : unknown network characteristics may be inferred by fitting theoretical expected dmi and dte patterns to experimentally observed data . for example , inferring state - dependent coupling strengths could further the analysis of neuronal dynamics during context - dependent processing @xcite .",
    "modifying inputs , initial conditions or system - intrinsic properties may well be viable in many biological and artificial systems whose function requires particular information routing . for instance , on long time scales , evolutionary pressure may select a particular information routing pattern by biasing a particular collective state in gene regulatory and cell signaling networks @xcite ; on intermediate time scales , local changes in neuronal responses due to adaptation or varying synaptic coupling strength during learning processes * * @xcite can impact information routing paths in entire neuronal circuits ; on fast time scales , defined control inputs to biological networks or engineered communication systems that switch the underlying collective state , can dynamically modulate information routing patterns without any physical change to the network .",
