    "the idea of lorentz violations ( lv ) in modern physics can be traced back to the studies of dirac in late 50 s @xcite .",
    "contemporary research problems of high energy physics lead to the formulation of various quantum gravitational ( qg ) theories which inherit local anisotropies in most circumstances .",
    "a sensible approach to this direction is the study of gr s extensions , where new space - time symmetries are introduced .",
    "noteworthy formalizations in this direction , are extra dimensional physics and the non - commutativity of space - time geometry ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in this framework ,",
    "new physical phenomena emerge in long range distances that may resolve questions of modern theoretical physics .",
    "a common feature in qg is the prediction of a modified mass - shell condition for elementary particles .",
    "moreover , these departures from lorentz invariance predict a vacuum refractive index and corrections at the threshold energy .",
    "the most debated effects are the time delay of light - rays which depends on the energy of photons ( see e.g. @xcite ) , and threshold anomalies reported from astrophysical observations @xcite .",
    "this phenomenology was recently associated with a velocity dependent geometry called finsler . in particular , f.girelli et.al @xcite argued that several structures , like the `` rainbow metric '' @xcite and other alternative scenarios of deformed special relativity - like @xcite models , can be approached by a finslerian perspective .",
    "the same formalism seems to be compatible with the propagation of rays in horava - lifshitz gravity @xcite .",
    "another case where finsler - like structures appear is the d - particle recoil example , where the effective 4-dimensional metric depends on phase space coordinates @xcite .",
    "similar scenarios from a different point of view on string - like theories have been discussed in @xcite .",
    "we also mention the correlation of birefringence optics to finslerian space - times @xcite .",
    "the aforementioned phenomenology suggests that finsler geometry could play a fundamental role in modern qg theories .",
    "another case on lorentz violations is the minimalistic approach of very special relativity ( vsr ) .",
    "the construction of vsr is based on a proper subgroup of the poincare group .",
    "an induced `` _ ether _ '' moving with the speed of light simulates a null spurionic vector field . in the context of vsr the introduction of a neutrino",
    "mass requires no additional states and needs no violation of leptonic number @xcite .",
    "however , departures from special relativity and cpt invariance are difficult to detect due to the null nature of `` _ ether _ '' @xcite .",
    "the above construction is incorporated to the finslerian framework again , after considering a curved version of vsr namely general very special relativity ( gvsr ) @xcite .",
    "gvsr is manipulated to build a cosmological toy model .",
    "we use a similar approach to @xcite , with the essential difference that the null character of the spurion is preserved in alliance to the original gvsr theory .",
    "a better insight about the effects of finsler geometry to gravitational physics is achieved by the osculation of a finslerian manifold to a riemannian one .",
    "we consider that the physical geometry is represented by a finslerian space - time , while gravitational geometry is described by a riemann structure , following @xcite .",
    "therefore , the frw metric is invoked to the finslerian background to study deviations from the standard cosmological picture . in this framework ,",
    "an observer falls on a peculiar non - geodesic congruence with respect to the frw comoving motion .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : after a short introduction to finsler geometry we outline the model of gvsr and some of its phenomenological consequences . in sec.3",
    "we describe the useful tool of the osculating riemannian space and its implications to gravitational physics . in sec.4",
    "we apply the osculating process to the model of gvsr using the frw metric for a flat universe .",
    "sec.5,6 are devoted to the construction of the equations of motion and continuity , relied on the induced space - time symmetries . in sec.7",
    "we present the solutions for the scale factor , flux and anisotropic pressure , while in sec.8 we discuss the implied long range modifications depicted by a modified frw potential . besides , we attempt to relate the dynamical behavior to some large scale observables .",
    "it seems that exotic matter or lower values for the energy density of the cosmic fluid is required to generate late time acceleration . sec.9,10 further analyze the kinematical properties of the model , to achieve some level of insight about the evolution of the medium .",
    "finally , we highlight for future development , that departures from the safe harbor of riemann geometry may trigger density perturbations , leaving artifacts of lorentz violations .",
    "finsler geometry is a generalization of riemann geometry , where all the geometrical structures depend on the element @xmath0 rather than the position coordinate solely .",
    "the line element is defined by a norm @xmath1 over the tangent bundle @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the base manifold .",
    "the @xmath1 is a homogenous function of first degree with respect to @xmath4 , such that the integral of the arc - length @xmath5 is independent of the parameter @xmath6 .",
    "finsler geometry is strictly discriminated from riemann geometry after dropping the quadratic restriction over the metric function @xmath1",
    "@xcite i.e. @xmath7 using euler s theorem we can calculate the finsler metric @xmath8 which is homogeneous of zero degree with respect to @xmath4 . the definition ( [ fmn ] ) is reduced to a riemannian metric when the metric tensor depends solely on the position @xmath9 , indicating that ( [ fsq ] ) is a quadratic form in @xmath10 . therefore , finsler geometry can be considered as a natural generalization of riemann geometry .",
    "the unit sphere @xmath11 is called the _ indicatrix _ and defines a 3-dimensional locus in every tangent space @xmath12 . in case of a riemannian space",
    "the indicatrix is an ellipsoid as a result of the quadratic restriction .",
    "however , ( [ fsq ] ) implies that the tangent spaces of a finsler space are not equipped with ellipsoidal unit balls as in riemann geometry , generating local anisotropies of space - time .",
    "therefore a geometrical property should arise to describe this `` distortion '' of the indicatrix , called color ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in particular , a riemannian space is considered entirely `` white '' , while in most cases a finsler space possesses different color patterns over the manifold .",
    "the lack of quadratic restriction appears in some phenomenological quantum gravitational theories as a consequence of lorentz symmetry breaking @xcite-@xcite .",
    "thus , in such a scenario , quantities which measure the color and its variations , are directly related to lorentz violations .",
    "these space - times can be characterized as _ colorful curved manifolds _ providing a way to study gravitational phenomena under the hypothesis of lorentz violations . and the @xmath13-curvature measure the color and its variations respectively . ]",
    "an intriguing case of lorentz symmetry breaking where finsler geometry turns up , is cohen and glashow s very special relativity ( vsr ) @xcite .",
    "the lorentz violations are generated by the @xmath14 subgroup of lorentz transformations .",
    "gibbons et.al investigated a deformation of vsr called _ general very special relativity _ ( gvsr )",
    "@xcite . among the deformations of @xmath14",
    "there is an 1-parameter family called the @xmath15 .",
    "this deformation group leaves invariant the finslerian line element , @xmath16 proposed by bogoslovsky ( see @xcite and references there in ) for the study of local anisotropies .",
    "the entity @xmath17 is a null spurionic vector field that determines the direction of the `` etheral '' motion s 4-velocity and can be selected as @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the signature of the minkowski metric is set to @xmath19 through - out this paper",
    ". the line element ( [ ds ] ) determines a particle s mass - tensor @xmath20 which indicates the machian nature of the theory @xcite .",
    "the symmetry of the line element ( [ ds ] ) indicates the lagrangian of a free - moving particle @xmath21 the above lagrangian implies the particle s action integral @xmath22 and the canonical momentum @xmath23.$ ] reveals the effect of the preferred direction on the particle s dynamics .",
    "the scalars @xmath24 are defined in ( [ fmn_explc ] ) . ] using the first order degree homogeneity of the lagrangian with respect to @xmath4 , we can construct the generalized mass - shell condition @xmath25 since the tangent and cotangent bundles define equivalent geometrical frameworks @xcite .",
    "condition ( [ fmscd ] ) can be reformed to the following convenient expression @xmath26 this relation reflects the colored nature of the space - time manifold .",
    "the parameter @xmath27 is restricted by various experiments to the order of @xmath28 ( _ ether drift experiment _ ) and @xmath29 _ ( anisotropy of inertia ) _ @xcite .",
    "the metric ( [ fmn ] ) of finsler geometry does not describe completely the geometric properties of the underlying manifold as in the riemannian case .",
    "further information must be supplied concerning the ( non ) linear connection .",
    "we refer two main branches of formalism among others , characterized by cartan s and chern s connections .",
    "the chern s approach introduced a connection which gave a complete system of local invariants ensuring that two finsler structures differ by a change of coordinates ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , it is an almost metrical ansatz . on the other hand ,",
    "cartan s connection is purely metrical .",
    "physical implications of the aforementioned perspectives , suggest a non - conservation of energy and momentum apart from a subclass of finsler spaces called berwald spaces ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein )",
    ". however , it is rather obscure if departures from relativistic invariance anymore guarantee the energy - momentum conservation and/or metricity of space - time . in the following sections we use a method of great simplicity , initially developed for the purpose of comparing various covariant derivatives of finsler geometry , _ the process of osculation_. in this approach , a purely riemannian metric is defined in a local subregion ( see next section ) and gr s machinery is valid for the induced levi - civita connection .",
    "before we proceed to the limit of osculation we investigate the mass - shell condition ( [ ndr ] ) which may provide observational motivations as we expect modified dispersion relations ( mdr ) and an influence on threshold energies .",
    "these phenomenological concepts drew some attention due to the possibility of constraining various qg models with current astrophysical data ( time of flight differences between photons of different energies , tev-@xmath30 and ultra high energy cosmic rays ( uhecr ) threshold anomalies ) @xcite . in order to demonstrate some physical implications of the modified mass - shell condition ( [ ndr ] )",
    "we will roughly compute the threshold energy of @xmath31 for the finslerian background ( [ ds ] ) .",
    "the threshold anomalies have also been studied for a finsler - randers space @xcite .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we will assume energy and momentum conservation @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 refer to a high energy particle colliding with a photon @xmath35 and @xmath36 represent the energy and momentum of the produced particles .",
    "the non - lorentz invariant relation ( [ ndr ] ) , for a further assumption of massless photons and small departures from lorentz invariance , reads for a photon and the @xmath37-particle , @xmath38 \\label{mrlth}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 and @xmath40 denotes the angle between the particle s spatial momentum and the spatial part of the null spurion .",
    "the dependence of ( [ mrlth ] ) on the parameter @xmath41 , reflects the local anisotropic structure of the finslerian space - time .",
    "the same particle with different orientation possesses a different energy component . working only on the lab frame , we can side - step the definition of different local frames in our lv - theory @xcite .",
    "the limit of high energy particles leads to the following formula for the threshold energy @xmath42b\\label{thres}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 stands for the angle between the total 3-momentum of the produced particles and the spurion s spatial preferred direction .",
    "we remark that , the lv effect to the threshold energy fades out parallel to the spatial direction ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "the above particle s production is expected between soft photons of the cmb and uhecrs . in general",
    ", we do nt expect to observe uhecrs above the well - known gzk cutoff @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "particles with energy values above this cut - off should be absorbed by the cmb background .",
    "however , cosmic rays with energies up to @xmath46 have been reported .",
    "a possible explanation is that the threshold of the photonpion process is at larger energies . in that spirit",
    "we can constrain various parameters coming from qg scenarios . for our case",
    "the value of @xmath27 is constraint up to @xmath47 .",
    "this is not a tight constraint for our parameter but it clearly depicts that locally a finsler space is directional dependent .",
    "nevertheless , the reader should keep in mind that energy - momentum conservation is not necessarily valid in a finslerian background .",
    "also , non trivial physics is involved due to the angle - dependence of the mass - shell condition .",
    "last but not least , a proca - like lagragian is invariant under @xmath15 , therefore massive photons should be embodied to the calculations .",
    "let @xmath48 be a region of the space - time finsler manifold @xmath49 parameterized by the local coordinates @xmath50 . in this neighborhood",
    "the velocity vector field @xmath51 can be picked up to be @xmath50 dependent , @xmath52 .",
    "thus this local region of @xmath53 possesses a riemannian metric @xmath54 and leads to the construction of the _ osculating riemannian space_. in other words , the process of osculation relates the velocity field uniquely to the space - time points , implying the limit of relativistic cosmology @xcite .",
    "the osculation of a finslerian manifold determines a purely riemannian space - time for a specified selection of @xmath55 . in case of a general fluid",
    "the comoving observers live on a different riemann space to the one of a tilted observer . in such a scenario",
    "the link between different families of observers belongs to the context of finsler geometry @xcite .",
    "consider an early time of the universe where lorentz violations and chaotic motion govern the cosmic fluid .",
    "finsler geometry is a candidate physical geometry of this state .",
    "as the universe evolves , lorentz violations and chaotic motion are expected to fade out , enabling the introduction of the observer s 4-velocity with respect to space - time coordinates .",
    "hence , the definition of an osculating riemannian space is possible , using the observer s 4-velocity field .",
    "a post big - bang riemannian cosmology rises up where seeds of the finslerian era can survive .",
    "the induced einstein field equations for the @xmath51 observer are @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the standard einstein tensor coming from the riemann metric ( [ oscmetr ] ) .",

    "the groups that leave ( [ curvf ] ) invariant for different values of @xmath27 are not isomorphic , leading to geometrical phase transitions @xcite .",
    "the substitution of relation ( [ curvf ] ) into ( [ fmn ] ) implies the finslerian metric tensor to the explicit form @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",

    "note that for a lorentz violating background , @xmath74 plays the role of physical geometry while @xmath67 represents the gravitational `` potential '' @xcite .",
    "we construct a cosmological model by inserting a flat frw metric and the observer s 4-velocity @xmath75 into ( [ fmn_explc ] ) .",
    "if lorentz violations `` dilute '' to thermal energy and entropy , this set up recovers the classical frw - limit .",
    "the process of osculation leads to a riemannian space - time , where the observer s rest frame lies on a tilted non - geodesic congruence .    the cosmological model is investigated during a geometrical phase where @xmath27 is a constant of first order disturbance upon the frw metric .",
    "therefore , the osculating riemannian line - element , by virtue of ( [ curvf ] ) , is reduced to @xmath76 \\\\ \\ : & \\ : \\\\      \\ : & + 2b / a(t)dtdz \\end{array}\\label{line_elem}\\ ] ] where the null spurion has been transformed to @xmath77 .",
    "the form of the metric ( [ line_elem ] ) indicates that the background geometry includes anisotropy , since the space - time expansion is of different rate at different directions . due to the independence of the metric components to the spatial coordinates ,",
    "all the invariant quantities are only functions of time .",
    "the off - diagonal terms of ( [ line_elem ] ) imply that the @xmath75 observer will measure an energy flux component .",
    "this effective peculiar motion with respect to the frw limit is owed to a 4-acceleration vector @xmath78 of lorentz violating origin .",
    "since ( [ line_elem ] ) is of riemannian nature we use the standard formulas for the connection and curvature .",

    "hence , this mechanism indicates that lorentz violations may generate inhomogeneities .",
    "a direct calculation gives back the non - vanishing components @xmath164 where @xmath104 is the frw solution since the leading terms of ( [ dz ] ) are proportional to @xmath27 .",
    "note that , in case of @xmath103 the density inhomogeneities are zero .",
    "the osculation of a finslerian manifold generates a riemannian cosmological _ toy model _ for a specific 4-velocity @xmath51 .",
    "the rest frame of the fundamental observer lies on a tilted non - geodesic congruence .",
    "the peculiar velocity @xmath51 defines the energy - momentum tensor of an imperfect fluid , given an almost frw - metric of zero spatial curvature .",
    "this construction holds for @xmath165 to retrieve the standard frw limit of the comoving observer , in case of vanishing lorentz violations .",
    "the resulting line element of space - time describes an anisotropic expanding ( contracting ) medium .",
    "therefore , an imperfect fluid with flux and anisotropic pressure is `` injected '' into space to support this anisotropy .",
    "the field equations lead to a modified friedmann equation of motion with an effective varying cosmological constant proportional to @xmath27 .",
    "the spatial curvature is considered @xmath166 in accordance to the astrophysical observations .",
    "the einstein field equations combined with the conservation laws for the flux and energy density , provide analytical solutions for the scale factor , anisotropic pressure , energy density and flux . however , the expressions for the scale factor are given in the form @xmath167 .",
    "the model s differential equations add a first order exponential factor to the frw s standard energy density while the flux and anisotropic pressure tend to zero for an increasing @xmath104 .",
    "we remark that the flux vector does not directly vanish even if the parameter @xmath27 is set to zero .",
    "furthermore , we investigate the model s behavior using the zero energy particle with a modified potential , in relation to the frw case . the parameter @xmath27 plays an influential role , since it determines substantial properties of the dynamics . in particular ,",
    "for @xmath168 a contracting universe will hit the initial singularity faster than the frw . on the other hand , if @xmath169 a richer scenario occurs ; an accelerating contraction leads to the potential s local minimum , turning to a decelerating contraction until it bounces back at some turning point .",
    "after the particle s reflection to the potential , an accelerating phase takes place until we cross the extremal point .",
    "finally , a decelerating expansion governs the evolution due to the attractive nature of gravity , recovering the frw limit with @xmath170 . in order to reproduce late time acceleration two possibilities rise up : assume exotic matter with @xmath132 , or a ` lighter ' universe with @xmath171 today .",
    "nevertheless , the time dependent effect to the kinematics , coming from the lv parameter , gives birth to a direct discrimination to the @xmath172 structure since the extra term can be addressed as an `` effective '' varying cosmological constant .",
    "one key geometrical quantity to `` translate '' observational data is the luminosity distance @xmath173 .",
    "the form of this function depends on the physical hypotheses taken into account . in that sense",
    ", the interpretation of the observations is model dependent . violating the symmetries of space - time in large distances ,",
    "@xmath173 might be crucially affected .",
    "a first question is how sensitive this function can be in terms of any extra parameters introduced by the model .",
    "if our model is not sensitive to the parameter @xmath27 , one could accurately determine whether or not the effective varying cosmological constant plays a role to the expansion dynamics .",
    "even in such a case , observations suggest that a constant @xmath174-term is completely consistent to the current data . on the other hand , due to many theoretical motivations , there has been an extensive amount of work investigating whether improved observational scenarios could measure a time - dependent @xmath174 behavior .",
    "these surveys are mainly directed by baryon acoustic oscillations , snia , lensing and cmbr data @xcite .    in gr ordinary matter",
    "always falls along geodesics at the presence of gravity alone .",
    "the study of gravitational collapse leads to the formulation of singularity theorems .",
    "however , other phenomena in nature impose non - geodesic motion ( for a recent review see @xcite ) . in this arena",
    "the question of a caustic singularity must be revisited .",
    "a characteristic example is the collapse of an ideal mhd fluid where magnetic tension may prevent the formation of a caustic @xcite .",
    "the present phenomenological model points out that the osculation of a finsler space to a riemannian one leads to non - geodesic motion .",
    "the observer s 4-acceleration vector mimics lorentz violations for our effective theory .",
    "therefore , raychaudhuri s equation implies that the formation of a singularity depends on the magnitude of the parameter @xmath27 which gives birth to lorentz violations .",
    "the presence of flux at the energy - momentum tensor is a direct consequence of the reduced non - comoving motion , since @xmath175 .",
    "the existence of flux combined to the peculiar motion acts as a source of inhomogeneities . as a result",
    ", relics of lorentz violations are encoded to density perturbations . in the context of finsler geometry",
    ", this mechanism demonstrates a possible correlation of lorentz violations to cmb physics , pointing out some possible future developments in the field",
    ".    a further research would be the construction of a spatially curved modified frw model and the back - reaction of lorentz violations to spatial curvature . also , the concept of geometrical phase transitions via finslerian geometrical structures is of some interest . in the framework of gvsr",
    "we can express these phase transitions by setting @xmath27 dependent on the space - time coordinates .",
    "the study of the @xmath27-evolution may shed light to the question `` _ why @xmath27 is so small ?",
    "finally , a vital task still remains : how a consistent modified gravitational theory can be achieved using the whole machinery of finsler geometry @xcite .",
    "the authors would like thank c.g.tsagas for the useful discussions on non - geodesic motion and the university of athens ( special accounts for research grants ) for the support to this work .",
