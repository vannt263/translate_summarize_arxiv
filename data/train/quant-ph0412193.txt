    "constraints and resources are intimately related in physics .",
    "if we impose a constraint on a physical setting then certain tasks become impossible .",

    "can not be created employing only the constrained set of operations but it may be manipulated and transformed under these operations . that the amount of resource does not increase under any operation satisfying",
    "the constraint emerges then as a fundamental law , for example in entanglement theory @xcite .",
    "one example of particular importance is the restriction to local quantum operations and classical communication ( locc ) .",
    "the resource that is implied by this constraint are non - separable states and in particular pure entangled states such as singlet states , neither of which can be created by locc alone .",
    "this setting gives rise to a theory of entanglement as a resource under locc operations .",
    "any such theory of entanglement as a resource will generally aim to provide mathematical structures to allow answers to three questions , namely ( 1 ) the characterization of entanglement , ( 2 ) the manipulation of entanglement and ( 3 ) the quantification of the entanglement resource @xcite under the given constraint .",
    "of particular interest is the question of how many inequivalent types of entanglement exist within such a theory . in the limit of infinitely many identically prepared copies of bipartite pure states , entanglement can be inter - converted reversibly @xcite and it is reasonable to say that there is only one type of pure bipartite entanglement .",
    "even for pure states , the situation changes dramatically when we consider the single copy setting .",
    "it has been shown that the schmidt rank of bipartite pure states can not be increased by locc @xcite . at the single copy level , the convertibility of bipartite entanglement",
    "is then characterized by the schmidt - rank @xcite . for finite dimensional systems",
    "a state can be converted to another one with finite probability exactly if the schmidt - number of the target state is not larger than that of the initial state . in a tripartite",
    "setting the situation is more complicated .",
    "here it is well - known for example that a ghz state can not be transformed to a @xmath0 state and vice versa @xcite .",
    "these states are then said to be incomparable .",
    "it can be shown that there are two incomparable types of tripartite entanglement in three qubits systems .",
    "the situation is even more complicated in multipartite settings composed by many parties @xcite or infinite dimensional bipartite systems @xcite , where there are many ( possibly infinitely many ) incomparable types of entanglement .    a different setting",
    "is presented by the concept of partial time reversal or partial transposition @xcite . for two qubits , states that remain positive under partial transposition ( denoted as ppt - states )",
    "are exactly the separable states @xcite but for higher dimensions this is generally not the case as there are ppt - states that are inseparable @xcite .",
    "this motivates the definition of the set of positive - partial - transpose - preserving operations ( ppt - operations ) , defined as operations that map any ppt - state into another ppt - state @xcite . in this case , the resource are states that are not ppt ( denoted as npt - states ) . in the single copy setting for pure states , it has been shown that both under ppt - operations @xcite and with locc supported by ppt - bound entanglement @xcite the schmidt - number can be increased so that state transformations become possible that are strictly impossible under locc .",
    "furthermore , there are mixed state transformations that are reversible in the asymptotic setting @xcite .",
    "this suggests that a theory of entanglement under ppt - operations might have a much simpler structure than that under the locc constraint .    in this paper , we focus attention on the entanglement manipulation under ppt operations in the non - asymptotic , single copy setting to explore what simplification occur .",

    "in the previous two sections we have demonstrated explicitly that the success probability for the transformation between pure states can in some cases be improved significantly by employing ppt - operations instead of locc operations . obtaining the optimal success probabilities is a hard task , however , especially in the multipartite setting . in the following",

    "the discussion above demonstrates that ppt - operations can improve the success probability of the single copy distillation for some mixed states .",
    "one may perhaps expect that single copy distillation becomes possible for all npt mixed states when we consider ppt - operations .",
    "this , however , is not the case . as shown in @xcite",
    "( see also @xcite ) , locc can not distill any pure entangled state from a single copy of mixed states @xmath203 on @xmath233 if @xmath234 .",
    "for such high rank mixed states , ppt - operations can not distill any pure entangled state either .",

    "this highlights the fact that locc state manipulation suffers certain restrictions that ppt - operations can not relax .",
    "indeed , the convertibility of some mixed states ( into pure entangled states ) at the single copy level , and therefore the convertibility of mixed states under ppt - operations remains much more involved than the convertibility of pure states .",
    "in this paper we have considered the transformation of single copies of multi - particle entanglement under sets of operations that are larger than the class of local operations and classical communication ( locc ) . in particular",
    ", we considered probabilistic state transformations under positive partial transpose preserving maps ( ppt - maps ) .",
    "we demonstrated that transformations that are strictly impossible under locc can have a finite success probability under trace preserving ppt - maps . for specific examples",
    "the optimal success probabilities are determined .",
    "surprisingly large values are obtained for example for the transformation from the ghz to @xmath0 state which under trace preserving ppt - maps has a success probability of more than 75% while it is strictly forbidden under locc .",
    "furthermore , we completely clarified the convertibility of arbitrary multipartite pure states under ppt - operations . as a remarkable result , we showed that all @xmath140-partite pure entangled states are inter - convertible under ppt - operations at the single copy level , and therefore infinitely many different types of entanglement under locc are merged into only one type . in this way , a drastic simplification in the classification of pure state entanglement occurs when the constrained set of operations is changed from locc to ppt - operations .",
    "it should be emphasized that despite such drastic simplification in the single copy settings , the theory of entanglement under ppt - operations possesses the desirable properties that ppt - operations alone can not create pure state entanglement and that the amount of bipartite pure state entanglement is uniquely determined in asymptotic settings @xcite .",
    "the above results can be regarded as an application of ppt - bound entanglement . in multipartite settings however another type of bound entanglement called unlockable bound entanglement exists .",
    "motivated by this , we enlarged the class of ppt - operations to consider the effects of unlockable bound entanglement . as a result we showed that all pure entangled states become inter - convertible independent of the number of parties , and",
    "therefore a further drastic simplification in the classification of pure states occurs when locc is supported by unlockable bound entanglement .",
    "finally , we considered one aspect of mixed state entanglement transformations , namely the single copy distillation by ppt - operations .",
    "we demonstrated that ppt - operations can distill a pure entangled state from a single copy of some mixed states with finite success probability , while the success probability under locc is strictly zero .",
    "however , we also proved that ppt - operations can not distill pure entangled state from mixed states with very high rank .",
    "therefore , certain restrictions of entanglement manipulation of mixed states under locc persist under ppt - maps , and the classification of mixed states under ppt - operations in the single copy settings is not as simple as that in the pure state case .",
    "it is important to further clarify how the structure of theory of entanglement is simplified under ppt - operations especially in the mixed state settings and in asymptotic settings , as this might enable a unified and systematic understanding of characteristics of quantum entanglement as a resource .",
