    "in classical differential geometry ( `` a language the muse did not sing at my cradle '' - see below ) , _ parallel transport _ is defined in the context of a _ connection _ on a smooth bundle @xmath4 .",

    "holonomy _ is given by the evaluation of @xmath8 on @xmath9 , the space of based loops in @xmath0 .",
    "the _ holonomy group _ is the image as a subgroup of the structure group of the bundle . that it is a group follows from the uniqueness of the lifting .",
    "it is well defined up to conjugation depending on the choice of base point .",
    "if @xmath4 is only a fibration of topological spaces , the situation is different : we still can lift paths but not uniquely .",
    "however , the lifts are related by homotopies , so that the right action of @xmath9 on the fibre @xmath10 is well behaved up to homotopy , i.e.    @xmath11    is homotopy commutative , where @xmath12 is multiplication in @xmath9 and @xmath13 is the action . in fact , there is a whole sequence of coherent higher homotopies , which we review below .",
    "( because @xmath14 denotes travelling along @xmath15 first and then along @xmath16 , the action will be written as right action : @xmath17 )    perhaps the oldest treatment in algebraic topology ( i learned it as a grad student from hilton s introduction to homtopy theory @xcite - the earliest textbook on the topic ) is to consider the long exact sequence , where @xmath10 is the fibre over a chosen base point in @xmath0 , @xmath18 ending with @xmath19 of course , exactness is very weak at the end since the last three are in general only sets , but exactness at @xmath20 is in terms of the action of @xmath21 on @xmath22 this passage to homotopy classes obscures the ` action ' of @xmath9 on @xmath10 .",
    "initially , this was referred to as a _",
    "homotopy action _ , meaning only that @xmath23 was homotopic to @xmath24 for @xmath25 and @xmath26    in those days , at least at princeton , there was no differential geometry until milnor gave an undergrad course my final year there .",
    "notice that our book ` characteristic classes ' @xcite considers differential forms only in appendix c , added much later .",
    "i think this lack of de rham theory in my graduate education was the result of serre s thesis which triumphed over characteristic 0 , cf .",
    "colloque de topologie , bruxelles ( 1950 ) .",
    "only recently have i learned of even greater significance of the metric geometry for the boundary map @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "similarly , i learned only much lateer of the notion of _ thin homotopy _ which quotients @xmath9 to a group without losing so much information .",
    "just recently , johannes huebschman led me to a paper of kobayashi ( from 1954 ! ) where he is already using what is now called thin homotopy in terms of parallel transport and holonomy for smooth bundles with connection .    back in 1966 , in the mexican math bulletin @xcite , a journal not readily available@xcite (",
    "although summarized in @xcite ) , i showed that in the topological setting of fibrations ( satisfying the homotopy lifting property ) , there was a notion of ` parallel ' transport not dependent on having a connection .",

    ".    inspired by block - smith @xcite and igusa @xcite , abad and schaetz @xcite showed that ` flat ' smooth parallel transport ( e.g. as in @xcite ) can be derived from the @xmath28 version of de rham s theorem due to gugenheim @xcite ; this allows them to extend parallel transport to an @xmath28-functor .- connections data , as in @xcite . ]",
    "they work with what is known as the @xmath3-groupoid @xmath30 of a space @xmath0 and its _ representations up to homotopy _ on a fibre bundle @xmath31 .",

    "what i am after here is an analog of parallel transport along paths extended to parallel transport over ( maps of ) simplices , not just 1-simplices .",
    "just as there is only linguistic difference between an action of a group on an object and a representation of that group , the same is true in the homotopy setting , but sometimes a homotopy action means only the existence of a single homotopy and some times the usual coherent collection of higher homotopies ; when in doubt , it is best to prepend @xmath28 or _ strong homotopy_.",

    "associativity is trivial ; the subtlety is in handling the 2-simplices and higher ones for multiple compositions .",
    "the idea of constructing a representation up to homotopy is very much like that of theorem 1 , the major difference being that instead of comparing two different liftings of the composed paths which are necessarily homotopic , we are comparing a lifting e.g. of a path from 0 to 1 to 2 with a lifting of a path from 0 to 2 if there is a singular 2-simplex @xmath139 .",

    "_    _ in contrast to the smooth bundle case where a connection provides unique path lifting , the fibration case is considerably more subtle since path and homotopy lifting is far from unique . _",
    "the proof is in essence the same as that for theorem [ parallel ] .",

    "later specific formulas were introduced by chen @xcite and , most recently , equivalently but more transparently , by igusa @xcite . more precisely :    @xmath157 is the trivial path , constant at @xmath158    and @xmath159 is the ` identity ' .",
    "for any @xmath135 ,    @xmath160 and @xmath161 @xmath162    one way to describe the relation between the @xmath163 and the @xmath164 in words is : travel from vertex 0 partway toward vertex 1 then straight partway toward vertex 2 then straight partway toward vertex 3 etc .",

    "the case @xmath188 is illustrative . the faces @xmath189 and @xmath190",
    "lift just as @xmath139 had via @xmath191 , but that lift must then be ` whiskered ' by a rectangle over @xmath192 which glues onto @xmath193 . in a less complicated way @xmath194 is lifted so that vertex @xmath180 agrees with the end of the ` whisker ' which is the lift of @xmath195 .",

    "however , we can plug in @xmath208 since @xmath209 will supply the glue over vertex 2 .    to describe the total space of the fibration ( or at least a quasi - fibration ) , we use the special maps @xmath210 now return to the description of the fibration @xmath211 above . in greater precision , @xmath212 the attaching maps over the vertices @xmath158 and @xmath180 are obvious as are the projections to the edges of @xmath213 on @xmath214 , the attaching maps are obvious except for the face @xmath215 where it is given by @xmath216 so as to be compatible with the projection @xmath217    the result is at least a quasi - fibration @xmath218 and can be replaced up to fibre homotopy equivalence by a true fibration ( cf .",
