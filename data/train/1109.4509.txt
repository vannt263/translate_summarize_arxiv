    "the magnetic properties of solids are typically described in terms of two archetypical and opposing viewpoints . on the one hand ,",
    "the picture of weakly interacting itinerant electron magnetism is usually implemented for metallic systems . on the other hand , for small overlap between sites or for strong local interactions the valence electrons can form localized moments and behave",
    "effectively like spin degrees of freedom of a heisenberg model ( for introductory texts , see , for example , refs .   and ) .    in strongly correlated electron systems , such as cuprate high - temperature superconductors@xcite or heavy fermion systems,@xcite such a clear distinction",
    "is often obscured since aspects of both pictures appear .",
    "due to the strong coulomb interaction the electrons are rather localized furnishing large magnetic moments . however , at low temperatures usually a bandstructure of heavy but itinerant quasiparticles around the fermi level forms , giving rise to the screening of local moments .",
    "central to the magnetic properties in these systems is the competition between quasiparticle - band formation , possibly spin - polarized , and ordering tendencies of large local moments .",
    "this competition yields especially interesting and novel physics in the case of frustrated systems.@xcite in the recently studied frustrated heavy fermion systems , such as liv@xmath1o@xmath2 , frustrated local moments dominate at elevated temperatures , while at low temperatures strongly correlated quasiparticles emerge ( see , for example , ref .  ) .",
    "similarly , a competition between frustrated magnetic moments and a low temperature fermi liquid has been proposed as an explanation for the re - entrant mott - transition found in the highly frustrated organic compound @xmath3-(et)@xmath1cu[n(cn)@xmath1]cl.@xcite in the context of the cuprate high - temperature superconductors there is a longstanding question whether the magnetic properties are best described in the local or itinerant picture , see , for example , ref .  .",
    "due to the proximity of these systems to the mott - insulating phase , the localized picture is often proposed , whereas recent studies also revealed the presence of itinerant spin - fluctuations throughout the whole brillouin zone.@xcite    in the hubbard model , all these aspects can be captured .",
    "weakly interacting band electrons can be studied for small values of the coulomb repulsion . with increasing interaction strength",
    "the system undergoes a mott metal - insulator transition above which it is best characterized by an effective heisenberg spin model .",
    "the interesting region is close to the mott transition where large magnetic moments and itinerant quasiparticles compete .",
    "frustration effects can be studied by considering , for example , the influence of a next - nearest neighbor hopping in an otherwise bipartite lattice .",
    "the magnetic properties of the hubbard model are very well studied . even though the model was introduced in order to describe ferromagnetism ( fm ) this phase",
    "is restricted to very large interaction strength and depends on details of the bandstructure.@xcite antiferromagnetism ( afm ) , however , represents a generic phase of the model and is found in large regions of phase space.@xcite    a very useful method to study the hubbard model in the strongly correlated regime near the mott transition is provided by the dynamical mean field theory@xcite ( dmft ) . with this method",
    "one can access the single - particle green function as well as two - particle quantities like susceptibilities .",
    "we will consider the bethe - salpeter equations and derive coupled equations for dynamic lattice susceptibilities which prove equivalent to the usual expression known from the dmft,@xcite but lend themselves more directly to our specific investigation of magnetism .",
    "the ultimate goal of this approach is to analytical continue these equations directly to the real axis and obtain integral equations for functions of real frequency arguments .    in this work , however , we employ an additional decoupling scheme for the internal matsubara summations which allows us to derive an universal approximation for the susceptibility , which unifies localized and itinerant aspects of magnetism .",
    "we discuss the range of validity of this formula and demonstrate its accurateness by reproducing the dmft nel temperature for the hubbard model on a simple cubic ( sc ) lattice in three dimensions , @xmath5 .",
    "the appeal of this approach lies in its simplicity compared to the usual matsubara approach to two - particle properties.@xcite only functions of real frequencies enter and the inversions of matsubara - space matrices is avoided .",
    "the competition between local - moment and itinerant quasiparticle magnetism is studied for a three - dimensional body - centered cubic ( bcc ) lattice with an additional next - nearest neighbor hopping @xmath0 . in situations",
    "where quasiparticle magnetism is dominant , the tendency toward magnetic order should be strongly suppressed by a finite next - nearest neighbor hopping , since the perfect nesting property of the fermi surface is removed . on the other hand , local - moment magnetism is less sensitive since the geometric frustration induced by the next - nearest neighbor hopping reduces the effective exchange coupling only quadratically in @xmath0 .",
    "this behavior is indeed found for weak and strong coulomb repulsions , respectively . in the crossover region for intermediate interactions , an interesting re - entrant behavior is found where the effective picture to be used depends on the temperature of the system .",
    "crucial to the occurrence of this behavior is the presence of the frustrating next - nearest neighbor hopping @xmath0 .",
    "the findings of this work are in accord with the common believe that frustration is capable of producing novel and interesting phenomena .    the paper is organized as follows . after a brief introduction of the model , sect .",
    "[ sec : model ] sketches the derivation of the bethe - salpeter equations for lattice susceptibilities .",
    "we present two different interpretations of the resulting simple formula for the magnetic susceptibility , one in terms of local moments and the other utilizing itinerant quasiparticles . in the first part of sect .",
    "[ sec : results ] we investigate the validity of our approach and compare the nel temperature for the sc lattice to known results from the literature .",
    "the second part of this section then focuses on the bcc lattice where the magnetic properties are investigated in detail .",
    "we also include two appendices , where more details on the technicalities are presented .",
    "the focus is laid on the similarities and differences of the the single - particle and two - particle set - up .",
    "in metals the long - ranged coulomb interaction is usually screened and only short - range components have to be considered . in order to study the effects of electronic correlations we consider the hubbard model , where only the on - site coulomb repulsion is retained . for the sake of simplicity ,",
    "we assume ionic @xmath6-shells without orbital degeneracy and with remaining spin - degeneracy only , although the formal developments described below can easily be generalized .    the hamiltonian is given by @xmath7 where the operator @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) annihilates ( creates ) an electron in a localized wannier orbital at lattice site @xmath10 with spin @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the number operator and @xmath13 is the ionic level position where the chemical potential is already taken into account .",

    "implements the local coulomb repulsion with the interaction matrix element @xmath16 .",
    "the structure of the lattice is encoded into the one - particle hopping amplitude @xmath15 , the fourier transform of which gives the single - particle dispersion relation @xmath17 the noninteracting density of states ( dos ) is entirely determined by the dispersion relation @xmath18    despite its simplicity , the exact solution of the hubbard hamiltonian of eq .",
    "is only possible in one spatial dimension@xcite ( for a recent book , see , e.g. , ref .  ) and in infinite spatial dimensions , @xmath19 ( with an appropriate rescaling the hopping parameters),@xcite by means of the dmft . in this work",
    "we will utilize dmft in order to extract an approximate solution for three dimensional systems .    in finite dimensions",
    "the major approximation of dmft is to treat all spatially nonlocal correlations in a mean - field manner . for the single - particle properties ,",
    "this implies the assumption of a momentum independent interaction self - energy , @xmath20 .",
    "then , the structure and dimensionality of the lattice enters the lattice green function only via the dispersion relation , @xmath21    however , the dependence on the ( complex ) energy variable @xmath22 is not neglected and thus dynamic local correlations are fully retained within dmft . the self - energy and the local green function , @xmath23 can be obtained from an effective single - impurity anderson model ( siam ) embedded in a self - consistent medium characterized by the hybridization function @xmath24 . once the effective siam is solved for a given @xmath24 , a new guess for the self - energy",
    "is obtained by inverting eq .  , which in turn is used to get @xmath25 via eq .  .",
    "only in this last step the lattice structure enters .",
    "the self - consistency cycle is closed by reorganizing eq .   and extracting a new guess for @xmath24 .",
    "the nontrivial part in this cycle is the solution of the effective siam .",

    "we introduced a matrix notation in orbital space for the fourier transform of the connected two - particle green function , @xmath43 ( see appendix [ app:2pdmft ] ) .",
    "this is the central quantity of interest , as other particle - hole susceptibilities can equally well be calculated from it .",
    "the charge susceptibility , for example , is obtained by using different matrix elements @xmath44 in eq .  , which amounts to a different sum over the matrix elements of the susceptibility matrix in eq .  .",
    "therefore , we will focus in the following on the susceptibility matrix @xmath45 , without the specific pre - factors @xmath46 unless needed , i.e.  for their signs .",
    "in analogy to the self - energy , the particle - hole irreducible two - particle interaction vertex is assumed to be momentum independent within dmft,@xcite @xmath47 as a consequence , sums over crystal momentum only involve the one - particle propagators leading to simple local expressions for closed loops or a geometric series for chains through the lattice . at interaction points crystal momentum",
    "is only conserved on average .",
    "a similar procedure fails for internal matsubara sums since all frequency dependencies are retained within dmft .",
    "therefore , the bethe - salpeter equations , as detailed in the appendix , have the structure of coupled integral equations in matsubara frequency space .",
    "the dynamic susceptibility is obtained by summing the appropriate two - particle green function over two internal frequencies , @xmath48 the exponential incorporates infinitesimal convergence factors @xmath49 which ensure the correct time ordering of the number - operators in the two - particle green function .",
    "frequently , in particular when using qmc as impurity solver , the two - particle lattice susceptibility is obtained by interpreting green functions as matrices in matsubara frequency space , @xmath50 ( indicated by a hat and the different placement of the external variable in our notation ) .",
    "the bethe - salpeter equation then has the structure of a matrix equation , where the internal frequency sums are represented by matrix multiplications , @xmath51 the particle - hole propagator @xmath52 is determined by the single - particle green function ( cf .",

    "the _ same _ irreducible local vertex @xmath57 is assumed for the impurity and the lattice model .",

    "it is important to realize that all quantities entering eq .",
    "can be calculated directly from the effective impurity model and the lattice green function .",
    "one thus has an explicit equation for the lattice susceptibility .",
    "however , the shortcoming of the approach sketched above is twofold .",
    "first , the set of matsubara frequencies @xmath59 is infinite as @xmath60 .",
    "the matsubara matrices are therefore infinite dimensional , which is of course not sustainable in practical calculations and truncations have to be introduced .",
    "second , the calculated susceptibilities are functions of complex matsubara frequencies which have to be numerically continued to the real axis which is mathematically an ill - defined problem .",
    "there exist sophisticated techniques , such as maximum entropy methods,@xcite but uncertainties and uncontrolled errors remain .",
    "another approach utilizes the dynamic density - matrix renormalization group technique and a subsequent deconvolution.@xcite apart from being very resource consuming , the deconvolution to obtain data on the real frequency axis might also introduce artefacts .    in order to avoid these difficulties we take a different route here .",
    "we introduce an additional approximation and decouple the matsubara sums in the bethe - salpeter equations in a manner similar to the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) . for technical details",
    "see appendix [ app:2pdmft ] .",
    "the major advantage is that the analytic continuation of all frequency variables to the real axis , like @xmath61 , can be done analytically . as derived in the appendix , the result is@xcite , we omit it here . ]",
    "@xmath62^{-1 }    .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the structure of this equation is of course the same as eq .  , but the important difference is that no matsubara matrices occur ( there are no hats are over the quantities ) and the external frequency @xmath63 is a real variable .",
    "the indicated matrix structure and inversions only refer to the orbital / spin space .    in the following",
    "we will focus on the magnetic susceptibility and on simple @xmath6-shells . in that case , all quantities are matrices in spin - space only .",
    "the particle - hole propagators of the paramagnetic regime are spin - symmetric , @xmath64 , and only two independent components exist for the susceptibilities , @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "the magnetic susceptibility is a linear combination of these two components , @xmath67 , and can be expressed as ( neglecting the prefactor @xmath68 ) , @xmath69^{-1 }      .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] all quantities entering this form are scalar functions of a real variable .",
    "@xmath70 is the dynamic local magnetic susceptibility of the impurity model , @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the local and lattice dependent particle - hole propagators , which only depend on the fully interacting single - particle green function ( see eqs .   and ) .",
    "this specific form for the susceptibility lends itself directly to interpretations in terms of the two archetypical physical pictures underlying magnetism :    * the picture of local - moment magnetism is suggested if eq .",
    "is re - written as + @xmath73 + where local spins characterized by @xmath74 interact via a nonlocal and dynamic exchange coupling @xmath75 this view is substantiated by approaching the atomic limit .",
    "then , the hopping matrix elements vanish , @xmath76 , and the lattice and the local particle - hole propagators become identical , @xmath77 .",

    "expanding up to second order in the hopping around the atomic limit yields the exchange coupling @xmath81 .",
    "the susceptibility then correctly reproduces the the mean - field approximation to the heisenberg model , @xmath82 in case of a simple - cubic lattice with nearest hopping , the @xmath83 is given by @xmath84 .",

    "the local vertex is nothing but the bare coulomb interaction , @xmath93 , and then @xmath94    the two opposing cases of a weakly interacting electron gas and the atomic limit are exactly incorporated in the approximate form for the susceptibility , eq .  .",
    "this substantiates the hope to be able to correctly describe the regime of intermediate coupling strength and especially the transition from itinerant to localized forms of magnetism .    at this point",
    "a comment on the advantages and shortcomings of the final expression , eq .",
    ", is in place .",
    "the major advantage of this formula lies in its simplicity in combination with the correct incorporation of the weak and strong coupling limit . and",
    "as it will be shown in the following , the qualitative and quantitative description of correlation effects even for intermediate coupling is very good .    in the usual weak - coupling rpa",
    "@xcite or extensions thereof , such as the fluctuation exchange approximation@xcite and the two - particle self - consistent approach@xcite , the particle - hole propagator is either calculated with bare propagators , i.e.  without interactions , or interaction processes are included only at a very crude level .",
    "this also applies to auxiliary boson approaches@xcite and equation of motion decoupling schemes.@xcite in contrast , the particle - hole propagator employed here is calculated with the fully interacting single - particle green function obtained from dmft , which incorporates life - time and many - body effects and can already lead to considerable modifications .",
    "furthermore , in the above mentioned approximation schemes the two - particle interaction vertices are given by weighted linear combinations of bare interaction matrix elements , i.e.   by numbers , and the frequency dependence of two - particle vertices is usually ignored . in the present treatment",
    "nontrivial _ dynamic _",

    "finite order cumulant expansions in the hopping @xmath97 as done , for example , in ref .",
    "do respect the leading frequency dependence of the two - particle vertex and include leading order nonlocal effects .",
    "lifetime broadening and kondo physics , however , are not captured in these treatments .",
    "our approach requires a thorough assessment of the quality of the rpa - like decoupling of frequency sums , which could possibly cause errors .",
    "virtues and limitations of our result contained in eq .",
    "will be borne out by the discussion in the next section .",
    "however , we can already formulate the expectation , that in situations , where coherent two - particle propagations through the lattice lead to the build - up of nonlocal correlations the decoupling is likely to fail . in the general set - up",
    ", the coherence is maintained at each interaction vertex due to its energy dependence , whereas in the decoupled version averages are taken at each local vertex .",
    "therefore , coherence is maintained only between consecutive local two - particle vertices , so that long - ranged correlations are affected .",
    "the most prominent example where such excitations are crucial is fm , as it is clear from the conditions favoring nagaoka - type fm.@xcite as will be demonstrated below , this leads to a very accurate description of afm phase transitions , while fm transition temperatures are overestimated , as in the usual stoner theory .",
    "another source of inaccuracies stems from the method chosen to solve the effective impurity model . in most cases ,",
    "the drawbacks of the impurity solver pose the strongest limitations on the accuracy and validity of the calculated green functions .",
    "the following investigation of the hubbard model on two different lattices uses the dmft scheme , applied to various one- and two particle properties furnishing , e.g. , spectral properties , local moments , susceptibilities , effective interactions and transition temperatures .",

    "<S> detailed analysis of the magnetic properties of the hubbard model within dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) is presented . using a rpa - like decoupling of two - particle propagators we derive an universal form for susceptibilities , which captures essential aspects of localized and itinerant pictures . </S>",
    "<S> this expression is shown to be quantitatively valid whenever long - range coherence of particle - hole excitations can be neglected , as is the case in large parts of the phase diagram where antiferromagnetism is dominant . </S>",
    "<S> the applicability of an interpretation in terms of the two archetypical pictures of magnetism is investigated for the hubbard model on a body - centered cubic lattice with additional next - nearest neighbor hopping @xmath0 . for large values of the coulomb interaction , local - moment magnetism </S>",
    "<S> is found to be dominant , while for weakly interacting band electrons itinerant quasiparticle magnetism prevails . in the intermediate regime and for finite @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> an re - entrant behavior is discovered , where antiferromagnetism only exists in a finite temperature interval . </S>"
