    "we assume that the matrix @xmath4 has signature @xmath5 and that the time level sets @xmath6 are space - like , i.e. @xmath7 .",
    "we consider semilinear wave equations , @xmath8 and quasilinear wave equations , @xmath9 to each of these equations we associate initial data in sobolev spaces @xmath10 there are two natural questions to ask : ( i ) are the equations locally well - posed in @xmath11 ?",

    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    in a first approximation we define it as follows :    a nonlinear wave equation is well - posed in @xmath12 if for each @xmath13 there is @xmath14 and a neighborhood @xmath15 of @xmath16 in @xmath12 so that for each initial data @xmath17 there is an unique solution @xmath18 , @xmath19 which depends continuously on the initial data .    in practice in order to prove uniqueness one often has to further restrict the class of admissible solutions . in most problems , the bound @xmath20 from below for the life - span of the solutions can be chosen to depend only on the size of the data .",
    "it is not very difficult to prove that all of the above problems are locally well - posed in @xmath11 for large @xmath21 .",
    "the interesting question is what happens when @xmath21 is small .",
    "one indication in this regard is given by scaling .",
    "at least in the case when the nonlinear term has some homogeneity , for instance @xmath22 or @xmath23 , one looks for an index @xmath24 so that all transformations of the form @xmath25 , @xmath26 leave the equation unchanged .",
    "correspondingly one finds an index @xmath27 so that the norm of the initial data @xmath28 in the homogeneous sobolev spaces @xmath29 is preserved by the above transformations .    below scaling ( @xmath30 ) a small data small time result",
    "rescales into a large data large time result .",
    "heuristically one concludes that local well - posedness should not hold .",
    "still , to the author s knowledge there is no proof of this yet .",
    "semilinear wave equations are ill - posed below scaling .",
    "this becomes much easier to prove if one strengthens the definition of well - posedness , e.g. by asking for uniformly continuous or @xmath31 dependence of the solution on the initial data .    if @xmath32 then for small initial data local well - posedness is equivalent to global well - posedness",
    "the same would happen for large data if we were to strengthen the definition of well - posedness and ask for a lifespan bound which depends only on the size of the data .",
    "this is the only case where this distinction makes a difference .    if @xmath33 then a local well - posedness result gives bounds for life - span @xmath34 of the solutions in terms of the size of the data , @xmath35 the better localization in time makes the problems somewhat easier to study .",
    "however , besides scaling there are also other obstructions to well - posedness .",
    "these are related to various concentration phenomena which can occur depending on the precise structure of the equation .",
    "[ [ global - well - posedness . ] ] global well - posedness .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    we briefly mention that there is a special case in which the global well - posedness is well understood , namely when the initial data is small , smooth , and decays at infinity .",
    "this is not discussed at all in what follows .",
    "consider first the case when @xmath21 is above scaling , @xmath33 , and local well - posedness holds in @xmath11 .",
    "then any solution can be continued as long as its size does not blow - up .",
    "hence the goal of any global argument should be to establish a - priori bounds on the @xmath11 norm of the solution .",
    "all known results of this type are for problems for which there are either conserved or quasi - conserved positive definite quantities .",
    "such conserved quantities can often be found for equations which are physically motivated or which have some variational structure .",
    "for simplicity suppose that there is some index @xmath36 and an energy functional @xmath37 in @xmath38 which is preserved along the flow .",
    "the index @xmath36 needs not be equal to the scaling index @xmath39 .",
    "there are three cases to consider :    \\(i ) the subcritical case @xmath40 .",
    "then a local well - posedness result at @xmath41 implies the global result for @xmath42 .",
    "furthermore , in recent years there has been considerable interest in establishing global well - posedness also for @xmath43 .",
    "this is based on an idea first introduced by bourgain  @xcite in a related problem for the schredinger equation , and followed up by a number of authors .",
    "\\(ii ) the critical case @xmath44 . here",
    "the energy is not needed for small data , when local and global well - posedness are equivalent . for large data , however , the energy conservation is not sufficient in order to establish the existence of global solutions . in addition",
    ", one needs a non - concentration argument , which should say that the energy can not concentrate inside a characteristic cone .",
    "\\(iii ) the supercritical case , @xmath45 .",
    "no global results are known :    are supercritical problems globally well - posed for @xmath46 ?    a simple example is the equation ( nlw ) with @xmath47 .",
    "the energy is @xmath48 then @xmath49 , while @xmath50 . in @xmath51 dimensions , for instance",
    ", @xmath52 is subcritical , therefore one has global well - posedness in @xmath53 .",
    "the exponent @xmath54 is critical and in this case the problem is known to be globally well - posed in @xmath55 ; the non - concentration argument is due to grillakis  @xcite .",
    "the exponent @xmath56 is supercritical .",
    "[ [ blow - up . ] ] blow - up .",
    "+ + + + + + + +    not all nonlinear wave equations are expected to have global solutions .",
    "quite the contrary , generic equations are expected to blow up in finite time ; only for problems with some special structure it seems plausible that global well - posedness may hold .",
    "a simple way to produce blow - up is to look for self - similar solutions , @xmath57 .",
    "if they exist , self - similar solutions disprove global well - posedness . because they must respect the scaling of the problem , they are not so useful when trying to disprove local well - posedness .",
    "another way to produce blow - up solutions is the so - called ode blow - up . in the simplest",
    "setting this means looking at one dimensional solutions ( say @xmath58 ) which solve an ode and blow up in finite time .",
    "then one can truncate the initial data spatially and still retain the blow - up because of the finite speed of propagation .",
    "this is still not very useful for the local problem .",
    "a better idea is to constructs blow - up solutions which are concentrated essentially along a light ray , see lindblad  @xcite,@xcite and alihnac  @xcite . in this setup",
    "the actual blow - up occurs either because of the increase in the amplitude , in the semilinear case , or because of the focusing of the light rays , in the quasilinear case .",
    "as it turns out , the counterexamples of this type are often sharp for the local well - posedness problem .",
    "-5 mm    usually , a fixed point argument is used to obtain local results for semilinear equations .",
    "we first explain this for the case when @xmath32 .",
    "we define the homogeneous and inhomogeneous solution operators , @xmath59 and @xmath60 by @xmath61 @xmath62 then the equation ( nlw ) for instance can be recast as @xmath63 to solve this using a fixed point argument one needs two banach spaces @xmath64 and @xmath65 with the correct scaling and the following mapping properties : @xmath66 the first two are linear , but the last one is nonlinear .",
    "the small lipschitz constant is always easy to obtain provided the initial data is small and that @xmath67 decays faster than linear at @xmath2 .",
    "the solutions given by the fixed point argument are global .    in the case",
    "@xmath33 the scaling is lost , and with this method one can only hope to get results which are local in time . to localize in time one",
    "chooses a smooth compactly supported cutoff function @xmath68 which equals @xmath69 near the origin .",
    "the fixed point argument is now used for the equation @xmath70 a solution to this solves the original equation only in an interval near the origin where @xmath71 .",
    "the modified mapping properties are @xmath72 how does one choose the spaces @xmath64 , @xmath65 ?",
    "one approach is to use the energy estimates for the wave equation and set @xmath73 the first two mapping properties are trivial .",
    "however , if the third holds then we must also have @xmath74 .",
    "the one unit difference in scaling between @xmath75 and @xmath76 implies that this can only work for @xmath77 .",
    "what is neglected in the above setup is the dispersive properties of the wave equation .",
    "solutions to the linear wave equation can not stay concentrated for long time intervals .",
    "instead , they will disperse and decay in time ( even though the energy is preserved ) .",
    "in harmonic analysis terms , this is related to the restriction theorem ( see @xcite ) and is a consequence of the nonvanishing curvature of the characteristic set for the wave operator , namely the cone @xmath78 . here",
    "@xmath79 stands for the fourier variable .",
    "one way of quantifying the dispersive effects is through the strichartz estimates .",
    "they apply both to the homogeneous and the inhomogeneous equation ( see @xcite and references therein ) : @xmath80 and @xmath81 are subject to @xmath82 the worst case in these estimates occurs for certain highly localized approximate solutions to the wave equation , which are called wave packets .",
    "a frequency @xmath83 wave packet on the unit time scale is essentially a bump function in a parallelepiped of size @xmath84 which is obtained from a @xmath85 parallelepiped at time zero which travels with speed @xmath69 in the normal direction . because of the uncertainty principle , this is the best possible spatial localization which remains coherent up to time @xmath69 . of course one can rescale and produce wave packets on all time scales .    in low dimension",
    "@xmath86 the strichartz estimates provide a complete set of results for generic equations of both ( nlw ) and ( gnlw ) type .",
    "consider the following two examples , of which the second is wrong but almost right : @xmath87 @xmath88 for @xmath89 , however , the strichartz estimates no longer provide all the results .",
    "the reason is as follows .",
    "the worst nonlinear interaction in both ( nlw ) and ( gnlw ) occurs for wave packets which travel in the same direction .",
    "one can use the strichartz estimates to accurately describe the interaction of same frequency wave packets .",
    "but in the interaction of two wave packets at different frequencies , the low frequency packet is more spread , and only a small portion of it will interact with the high frequency packet .",
    "however , unlike in low dimension , the strichartz estimates do not provide sharp bounds for this smaller part of a wave packet .    a more robust idea due to bourgain  @xcite and klainerman - machedon  @xcite is to use the @xmath90 spaces associated to the wave equation very much in the same way the sobolev spaces are associated to the laplacian : @xmath91 then one chooses @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "the strichartz information is not lost since for @xmath94 as above we have the dual embeddings @xmath95 within the framework of the @xmath90 spaces one can prove bilinear estimates which provide a better description of the interaction of high and low frequencies , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "the bilinear estimates are obtained as weighted convolution estimates in the fourier space , by using the above embeddings , or by combining the two methods .",
    "sometimes even this setup does not suffice and has to be modified further , see @xcite .",
    "the equation @xmath96 is locally well - posed in @xmath97 for @xmath89 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 .",
    "( see @xcite for more details )    [ [ the - null - condition . ] ] the null condition .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    a natural question to ask is whether there are equations which behave better than generic ones .",
    "this may happen if the worst interaction ( between parallel wave packets ) does not occur in the nonlinearity .",
    "a good example is ( gnlw ) with a quadratic nonlinearity @xmath100 .",
    "the cancellation condition , called null condition , asserts that @xmath101 all such null forms are linear combinations of @xmath102    study semilinear wave equations corresponding to variable coefficient wave operators for @xmath89 ( generic case ) or @xmath103 ( with null condition ) .    in the constant coefficient case one",

    "this is done using inequalities of the following form : @xmath104 respectively @xmath105 where by @xmath106 we denote the symbol of the constant coefficient wave operator , given by @xmath107 .",
    "combining this with the embeddings above one can lower the @xmath21 in the local theory whenever the null condition is satisfied .",
    "unfortunately , this does not always give optimal results .",

    "the restriction to @xmath157 is not central to the problem , it can likely be removed with some extra work .        in most approaches ,",
    "the key element in the proof of the strichartz estimates is the construction of a parametrix for the wave equation .",

    "the disadvantage is that all spatial localization comes from stationary phase , which seems to require too much regularity for the coefficients .",
    "one way to address the issue of spatial localization is to begin with wave packets , which have the best possible spatial localization on the unit time scale . in the variable coefficient case the frequency @xmath83 wave packets are bump functions on curved parallelepipeds of size @xmath163 .",

    "it is not too difficult to construct individual wave packets , the more delicate point is to show that the wave packets are almost orthogonal .",
    "this approach , which is used in @xcite , was originally introduced by smith  @xcite and used to prove the strichartz estimates in @xmath167 and @xmath168 dimensions for operators with @xmath169 coefficients .",
    "another parametrix with a better built in spatial localization can be obtained by doing a smooth phase space analysis : @xmath170 here @xmath171 is the hamilton flow for @xmath165 on the characteristic cone @xmath172 .",
    "one can factor this into a product of three operators , namely an fbi transform , a phase space transport along the hamilton flow and then an inverse fbi transform . neglecting the first one ,",
    "i.e. setting @xmath173 above , produces an operator which is similar to the fourier integral operators with complex phase .",
