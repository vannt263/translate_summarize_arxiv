    "studies of two - level quantum systems have acquired recently a new meaning related to the use of this simple quantum object as an elementary cell ( qubit ) of a quantum computer.@xcite this paper addresses the measurement of a qubit state , so it necessarily touches the long - standing and still somewhat controversial problem of quantum measurement,@xcite which is known under the name of quantum state `` collapse '' .",
    "having in mind a solid - state realization of qubit ( for different proposals see , e.g.  refs .",
    "@xcite ) let us emphasize that a realistic detector has a noisy output signal , so the measurement of a qubit state should necessarily have finite duration in order to provide an acceptable signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "in this situation the `` orthodox '' collapse postulate @xcite can not be applied directly , since the measurement is not instantaneous .",
    "the necessity of a more general formalism is obvious , for example , in the case when the qubit `` self - evolution '' changes the quantum state considerably during a measurement process . even if there is no self - evolution",
    ", one can wonder what happens with the qubit state after a partially completed measurement ( when the signal - to - noise ratio is still on the order of unity ) .",
    "so , we need a formalism to describe the gradual qubit evolution , caused by the measurement process . as will be discussed later , the schrdinger equation alone is not sufficient for the complete description of this evolution , and should be complemented by a slightly generalized collapse principle .",
    "continuous quantum measurement was a subject of extensive theoretical analysis during last two decades , and there are two main approaches to this problem .",
    "one approach is based on the theory of interaction with a dissipative environment .",
    "@xcite taking the trace over the numerous degrees of freedom of the detector , it is possible to obtain a gradual evolution of the measured system density matrix from the pure initial state to the incoherent statistical mixture , thus describing the measurement process.@xcite since the procedure implies an averaging over the _ ensemble _ , the final equations of this formalism are deterministic and can be derived from the schrdinger equation alone , without any notion of state collapse .",
    "the success of the theory in describing many solid - state experiments has supported an opinion common nowadays that the collapse principle is a needless part of quantum mechanics . because of the dominance of this approach ( at least in the solid - state community ) we will call it `` conventional '' .",
    "the other general approach to continuous quantum measurement ( see , e.g. , refs .   ) explicitly or implicitly uses the idea of the state collapse . since",
    "quantum measurement is a fundamentally indeterministic process so that the exact measurement result is typically unpredictable , the approach describes the random evolution of the quantum state of the measured system .",
    "the important advantage in comparison with the conventional approach is the absence of averaging over the total ensemble ; hence , it is possible to describe the evolution of an _ individual _ quantum system during a particular realization of the measurement process .",
    "the evolution of the measured system obviously depends on a particular measurement outcome ; in other words , it is selected by ( conditioned on ) the measurement result .",
    "so , this approach is usually called the approach of _ selective _ or _ conditional _ quantum evolution .",
    "there is a rather broad variety of formalisms and their interpretations within the approach .",
    "depending on the details of the studied measurement setup and applied formalism , different authors discuss quantum trajectories , quantum state diffusion , stochastic evolution of the wavefunction , quantum jumps , stochastic schrdinger equation , complex hamiltonian , method of restricted path integral , bayesian formalism , etc .",
    "( for comparison between several different ideas see , e.g. ref .",
    "the approach of selective quantum evolution is relatively well developed in quantum optics ; in contrast , it was introduced into the context of solid - state mesoscopics only recently .",
    "@xcite    in the present paper we continue the development of the bayesian formalism @xcite for selective quantum evolution of a qubit due to continuous measurement .",
    "several issues of the formalism derivation and interpretation are explained in more detail than in previous papers .",
    "a new way of derivation is presented for a special case of low - transparency quantum point contact ( tunnel junction ) as a detector .",
    "we also discuss equations ( briefly mentioned in ref .",
    "@xcite ) for the evolution of a qubit measured by single - electron transistor , which go beyond the approximation used for a nonideal detector in ref .  @xcite .",
    "special attention is paid to a regime outside the `` weakly responding '' limit .",
    "finally , we discuss the operation of a quantum feedback loop which can suppress the qubit decoherence caused by interaction with the environment .",
    "the total hamiltonian @xmath0 of a qubit continuously measured by a detector , @xmath1 consists of terms describing the qubit , the detector , and their interaction .",
    "the qubit hamiltonian , @xmath2 is characterized by the energy asymmetry @xmath3 between two levels and the mixing ( tunneling ) strength @xmath4 ( we assume real @xmath4 without loss of generality ) .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ qb ] ) is written in the basis defined by the coupling with the detector",
    ". we will refer to mutually orthogonal states @xmath5 and @xmath6 as `` localized '' states in order to distinguish them from the `` diagonal '' basis consisting of the ground and excited states , which differ in energy by @xmath7",
    ".      our study will be applicable to several different types of qubits and detectors .",
    "as the main example we consider a double quantum dot occupied by a single electron , the position of which is measured by a low - transparency tunnel junction nearby ( see fig .  [ schematic ] ) . basically following the model of ref .",
    "@xcite let us assume that the tunnel barrier height depends on the location of the electron in either dot 1 or 2 ; then the current through the tunnel junction ( which is the detector output ) is sensitive to the electron location . in this case",
    "the detector and interaction hamiltonians can be written as @xmath8 where both @xmath9 and @xmath10 are real and their dependence on the states in electrodes ( @xmath11 ) is neglected . if the electron occupies dot 1 , then the average current through the detector is @xmath12 ( @xmath13 is the voltage across the tunnel junction and @xmath14 are the densities of states in the electrodes ) while if the measured electron is in the dot 2 , the average current is @xmath15 .",
    "the difference between the currents , @xmath16 determines the detector response to the electron position ( notice the different sign in the definition of @xmath17 used in ref .",
    "because of the finite noise of the detector current @xmath18 , the two states of the system can not be distinguished instantaneously and the signal - to - noise ratio gradually improves with the increase of the measurement duration .",
    "let us define the typical measurement time @xmath19 necessary to distinguish between two states as the time for which the signal - to - noise ratio is close to unity:@xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the low - frequency spectral densities of the detector noise for states @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "( as will be seen later , @xmath19 also determines the timescale for selective evolution of the qubit state due to measurement . ) for a low - transparency tunnel junction @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the inverse temperature . at sufficiently small temperatures @xmath25 ( we assume zero temperature unless specially mentioned )",
    "the detector shot noise is given by the schottky formula , @xmath26 to avoid an explicit account of the detector quantum noise we will consider only processes at frequencies @xmath27 ( in particular , we assume @xmath28 ) .",
    "the major part of the paper will be devoted to the detector in the `` weakly responding '' regime when two states of the detector differ only a little ( one can also call this regime `` linear '' , while the term `` weak coupling '' is reserved for a different meaning ) , in particular , @xmath29 so the typical measurement time is @xmath30 for a weakly responding detector the timescale @xmath31 of individual electron passages through the detector is much shorter than @xmath19 , so the current can be considered continuous on the measurement timescale .      besides the low - transparency tunnel junction as a detector",
    ", we can also consider a quantum point contact with arbitrary transparency @xmath32 which depends on the electron position in the double dot .",
    "this setup in the context of continuous quantum measurement has been extensively studied both experimentally @xcite and theoretically .",
    "@xcite in spite of a somewhat different mathematical description ( we will not write the hamiltonian explicitly ) this case is very close to the case above , which we prefer because of its simplicity .",
    "the obvious new feature is the different formula for the shot noise , @xcite @xmath33 where @xmath34 .",
    "notice that for the quantum point contact as a detector we make the condition ( [ wr1 ] ) for weakly responding regime a little stronger , @xmath35 , so that both transmitted and reflected currents can be considered continuous on the measurement timescale .",
    "another interesting measurement setup ( fig .  [ set ] ) introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite in the context of a solid - state quantum computer , is a single - cooper - pair box measured by a single - electron transistor ( a somewhat similar setup has been recently used for the experimental demonstration @xcite of quantum oscillations in the time domain ) .",
    "the qubit in this case is represented by two charge states of a small - capacitance josephson junction .",
    "the josephson coupling provides the matrix element @xmath4 in eq .",
    "( [ qb ] ) which is assumed to be much smaller than the single - electron charging energy , so that only two charge states ( adjusted by the gate voltage to be close in energy ) are important .",
    "the capacitively coupled single - electron transistor is sensitive to the charge state of the cooper - pair box and serves as the detector ; the current @xmath18 through the transistor is the measurement output .",
    "one can find the detailed discussion of the hamiltonian for this measurement setup in ref .",
    "the qubit state affects the energy of the middle island of the single - electron transistor ( fig .",
    "[ set ] ) , so the interaction is of `` density - density '' type : @xmath36 where the factor in large brackets is the number of extra electrons on the transistor island . in the `` orthodox '' regime of sequential single - electron tunneling @xcite in the transistor ,",
    "the energy change @xmath37 affects the rates of tunneling through the two tunnel junctions and thus affects the average current @xmath38 . in the simplest case when the electrons can tunnel only in a strict alternating sequence with rates @xmath39 and @xmath40 , the average currents @xmath41 and @xmath42 can be calculated as @xcite @xmath43 where @xmath44 corresponds to the charge state of the qubit .",
    "well outside the coulomb blockade range the difference between the rates is @xmath45 and @xmath46 , where @xmath47 are the resistances of tunnel junctions .",
    "the measurement time to distinguish between states @xmath5 and @xmath6 for this setup is given by eq .",
    "( [ tau_m ] ) , in which the spectral density of the single - electron transistor current can be calculated using equations of refs .",

    "( [ set - cur ] ) the shot noise is given by the formula@xcite @xmath48      one more solid - state realization of continuous quantum measurement of a qubit can be done using two flux states of a squid as a qubit and another inductively coupled squid as a detector.@xcite the corresponding hamiltonian and calculations of the squid noise can be found , e.g.  in ref .",
    "@xcite . a minor difference in the formalism",
    "is related to the fact that the typical output signal from a squid is voltage instead of current in the examples above .",
    "the goal of the present paper is the analysis of a selective evolution of the qubit state due to continuous measurement , taking into account the detector output @xmath18 .",
    "however , before that let us review the results of the conventional approach to this problem which does not take into account the detector output .",
    "we describe the quantum state of a qubit by the density matrix @xmath49 in the basis of localized states @xmath5 and @xmath6 , so that @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) is the probability to find the system in the state `` @xmath52 '' _ if _ an instantaneous measurement in this basis is performed , while @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) characterizes the coherence ; in particular , @xmath55 corresponds to a pure state . in the conventional approach @xcite the evolution of @xmath49 is calculated using the schrdinger equation for the combined system including the detector and then tracing out the detector degrees of freedom that leads to the following equations : @xmath56 where the effect of continuous measurement is described by the ensemble decoherence rate @xmath57 .",
    "( such equations in similar problems when the environment causes dephasing are known for many years ",

[ schematic ] .",

    "first of all , a natural question is how it is possible that the qubit density matrix evolution can be described simultaneously by the conventional equations ( [ conv1])([conv2 ] ) and the bayesian equations ( [ bayes1])([bayes2 ] ) [ and even also by the improved bayesian equations ( [ bayesset1])([bayesset2 ] ) ] . which equations are correct ?",
    "the answer is : all are correct depending on the problem considered .",
    "if only the ensemble evolution is studied ( for example , the ensemble of particles is measured , as in typical nuclear magnetic resonance experiments ) then the conventional approach is completely sufficient .",
    "it is also possible to use the bayesian equations ; however , they should be averaged over all possible measurement results , after which they coincide with the conventional equations .",
    "so , the selective approach does not have real advantages for the study of the averaged evolution ( besides a significant computational gain in some cases @xcite ) .",
    "there is still no advantage even for the majority of experiments with individual quantum systems ( see examples in section ii ) _ if _ the averaging is done over a number of repeated experiments , disregarding the results of individual measurements ( more exactly , when not more than one number is recorded as a result of each run ) .",
    "the principal advantage of the selective evolution approach arises for continuous measurement of an individual quantum system when the continuous detector output @xmath18 is recorded ( or at least two numbers are recorded in each run ) . in this case",
    "the selective approach gives the possibility to make experimental predictions , unaccessible for the conventional approach .",
    "the proposals of such experiments with solid - state qubits have been discussed , for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite for a one - detector setup and in ref .",
    "@xcite for a two - detector setup ( the latter experiment seems to be realizable at the present - day level of solid - state technology ) .    in this case",
    "the density matrices calculated by the conventional and bayesian equations are significantly different .",
    "however , they do not contradict each other but rather the bayesian - calculated density matrix is more accurate than the conventional counterpart .",
    "for example , there are no situations when two approaches predict different pure states of the qubit  then it would be possible to prove experimentally than one of the approaches is wrong . instead , in a typical situation the conventional equations give a significantly mixed state ( so , essentially no predictions are possible ) while the bayesian equations give a pure state ( and so some predictions with 100 % certainty are possible ) .",
    "a similar relation holds between bayesian equations ( [ bayes1])([bayes2 ] ) and the improved bayesian equations ( [ bayesset1])([bayesset2 ] ) : the latter give a more accurate description of qubit evolution and allow us to make more accurate predictions .    the difference between density matrices calculated in different approaches",
    "can be easily understood if we treat density matrix not as a kind of `` objective reality '' but rather as our knowledge about the qubit state ( in accordance with orthodox interpretation of quantum mechanics ) .",
    "then it is obvious that since bayesian equations take into account additional information [ detector output @xmath18 ] , they provide us with a more accurate description of the qubit state than the conventional equations .",
    "another controversial issue is the state collapse due to measurement ( here it is more appropriate to mention the mathematical formulation by lders @xcite rather than by von neumann @xcite ) .",
    "the conventional equations are derived without any notion of collapse while the derivation of bayesian equations requires either implicit or explicit ( as in the model of section vi ) use of the collapse postulate .",
    "philosophically , the collapse postulate is almost trivial : when the result of the measurement becomes available , we know for sure that the state of the measured system has changed consistently with the measurement result ( even though it is generally impossible to predict the result with certainty ) . in spite of being trivial , this postulate in the author s opinion",
    "can not even in principle be derived dynamically by the deterministic schrdinger equation because of the intrinsic randomness of the measurement result . in other words ,",
    "the measurement process can not be described by the schrdinger equation alone because this equation is designed for closed systems while a quantum object under measurement is always an open system ( even including the detector ) , since the measurement information is output to the outside world .",
    "( the incompatibility between quantum mechanics and `` macrorealism '' has been discussed , e.g. , in ref .",
    "@xcite . )    following the orthodox ( copenhagen ) interpretation , we can regard collapse not as a real physical process but rather as a convenient formal tool to get correct experimental predictions . in the author s opinion",
    "this tool is still irreplaceable ( if we leave aside the many - worlds interpretations@xcite ) for the complete description of the quantum realm .",
    "( of course , in many cases the collapse postulate is not necessary as , for example , for the description of decoherence due to interaction with the environment  this problem has been solved with great success by the conventional approach . )",
    "bayesian equations predict several quite counterintuitive results .",
    "for example , even for a qubit with an infinite barrier between localized states , @xmath120 , the continuous measurement by an ideal detector leads to a gradual `` flow '' of the wavefunction between the states ( for an initially coherent qubit ) .",
    "the interpretation of this effect is rather difficult if we treat the wavefunction as objective reality ; in contrast , there is no problem with the orthodox interpretation .",
    "most importantly , experimental observation of such effects in solid - state qubits is coming into the reach of present - day technology .",
    "these experiments would be extremely important not only for better understanding of the foundations of quantum theory , but could be also useful in the context of quantum computing .                                                                                    actually , for @xmath287 the signal - to - noise ratio corresponding to @xmath19 defined by eq .",
    "( [ tau_m ] ) is not exactly unity ; however , it has the desired asymptotic behavior @xmath288 at @xmath289 .",
    "notice that a reliable measurement result can be obtained only after several times @xmath19 ( @xmath290 gives 98% reliability , @xmath291 gives 99.9% , etc . ) .",
    "notice that the noise spectral density @xmath292 is treated in the bayesian formalism as frequency - independent .",
    "this implies that we do not consider frequencies higher than the typical frequency @xmath293 above which @xmath292 becomes frequency - dependent .      in a more general case of an arbitrary detector with the possibility to observe each passing electron , eqs .",
    "( [ iter1])([iter2 ] ) remain valid , so using the inequality @xmath240 and ensemble averaging we obtain the lower bound @xmath294 . if the schottky formula is still applicable , @xmath295 , this makes the general inequality @xmath242 valid even outside the weakly responding regime .    at the first glance the condition @xmath296 seems to be sufficient for the equivalence between the two results . however , if @xmath41 and @xmath42 are significantly different , then the averaging of @xmath118 gives different results in the two models ( see remark 28 in ref .",
    "this is because the tails of poissonian and gaussian distributions are different even when the central parts coincide well .    in a model with an effectively finite number of detector degrees of freedom",
    "the collapse by the pointer would disturb the interaction between qubit and detector ; in particular , sufficiently frequent collapse could lead to quantum zeno freezing of the detector state .",
    "for example , for a finite - transparency quantum point contact the `` attempt frequency '' @xmath297 is always comparable to the typical frequency @xmath298 of electron passage . as a consequence , a readout often and strong enough to observe individual electrons , @xmath299 , would necessarily disturb the measurement process ."
