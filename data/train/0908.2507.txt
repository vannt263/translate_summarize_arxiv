    "our gas- and detector - studies of atlas monitored drift tube ( mdt ) muon detectors are motivated by the requirements for the atlas muon spectrometer at future increased luminosities of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern .",
    "luminosity upgrades are planned in several steps up to a final increase in luminosity of about an order of magnitude at super - lhc . at the lhc design luminosity 10@xmath5 @xmath6s@xmath7 ,",
    "background rates of gammas and neutrons of up to 10  @xmath6s@xmath7 are predicted for the barrel part of the spectrometer and rates up to 100  @xmath6s@xmath7 for the forward region of the endcap spectrometer .",
    "the atlas muon spectrometer will provide momentum resolution of 10 @xmath8 at 1 tev / c transverse muon momentum at 3 - 6 tm bending power generated by a superconducting air coil toroid .",
    "it consists of 3 layers of precision drift tube chambers .",
    "an atlas mdt chamber@xcite consists of 2 multilayers with 3 or 4 layers of 30 mm drift tubes each , which are filled with an argon and co@xmath2 gas mixture ( 93:7 ) at an absolute pressure of 3 bar .",
    "the voltage at the gold plated w - re anode wire ( diameter 50 @xmath9 ) is 3080 v. these conditions correspond to a maximum electron drift time of 700 ns and a gas gain of 2 @xmath10 .    for sufficiently good sagitta reconstruction , single tube resolutions of around 80 @xmath9",
    "are envisaged .",
    "but at increased background rates of 1000 @xmath11 or higher , the single tube resolution deteriorates mostly due to space charge effects in the slow and nonlinear drift gas mixture . at too high occupancies",
    "unambigous track reconstruction will become difficult or impossible@xcite .",
    "this paper shows resolution measurements of fast and linear drift gases , the sensitivity of mdt chambers on fast neutrons , the influence of fast neutron background on the resolution , and the comparison of space charge effects in 15 mm and 30 mm diameter drift tubes under @xmath4-irradiation .",
    "the reduction of co@xmath2 from 7 to 3 % reduces the maximum drift time by about 200 ns and the addition of small percentages of n@xmath2 makes the drift gas more linear . two inert gas mixtures ( ar - co@xmath2-n@xmath2 96:3:1/97:2:1 ) with linear position - drifttime relations ( rt - relations ) and maximum drifttimes around 450 ns",
    "are promising candidates .",
    "these mixtures were tested on their single tube resolutions .",
    "+ at standard voltage and pressure conditions , the measurements were performed at the cosmic ray facility in garching ( fig.1 ) .",
    "+ a set of three mdt chambers is sandwiched by layers of scintillation counters to trigger on cosmic muons . using a 40 cm thick iron absorber , we selected muons with an energy higher than 600 mev .",
    "+        the measured drifttime in each drifttube is transformed into a driftradius @xmath12 with the help of the rt - relation .",
    "+ the reference chambers provide a highly precise track reconstruction and therefore we get a precise prediction for the driftradius @xmath13 in the tubes of the test chamber .",
    "the difference between these two values defines the residual @xmath14 : @xmath15 the width @xmath16 of gaussians describing the shape of the residual distribution of small drift radii intervals define the single tube resolution .",
    "fig.2 shows almost identical resolution for the tested mixtures including the standard gas .",
    "the most promising candidate is ar - co@xmath2-n@xmath2 in the ratio 96:3:1 % .",
    "quenching , afterpulsing and streamerrate of the alternative gas mixtures are ongoing .    ,",
    "to study the dependence of the single tube resolution on fast neutron background , we used the test setup shown in fig.3 , at the 14 mv tandem of the munich maier - leibnitz laboratory ( mll ) .",
    "almost monoenergetic 11 mev neutrons were produced bombarding a hydrogen gas target with 60 mev @xmath17b ions .",
    "the small test chamber ( 3 layers , 3 tubes per layer ) , surrounded by si - strip detectors for reference tracks and scintillation counters for cosmic trigger , was operated under standard gas and electronics conditions .",
    "the si - strip detectors have a position resolution of better than 20 @xmath9 .",
    "+         the single tube resolution was determined in runs with and without background neutrons .",
    "the result for the first method , comparing the measured radii for tubes 3 , 9 , 11 , 19 , 21 ( see fig.4 ) with the tracks through the si - strip detectors , is shown in the lower part of fig.4 .",
    "the upper part of fig.4 shows the result for the comparison of a track fitted to a triplet of tubes with the individual drift radii per tube .",
    "the degradation of the single tube resolution under 11 mev neutron flux densities of 4 - 16 @xmath18 is about 10 @xmath9 .",
    "using triple sums , in most cases a small radius contributes to the calculation , worsening the resolution as observed in fig.2 .",
    "+        to determine the overall neutron efficiency , which quantifies the sensitivity of the mdt chamber to neutrons , the mdt chamber readout was randomly triggered . dividing the number of counts per second in a tube by the neutron flux leads to an efficiency of @xmath19 .",
    "this value is indicated in fig.5 , where two simulations@xcite are shown as well .",
    "@xmath4-background events as well are ionizing the counting gas .",
    "the produced primary electrons drift towards the anode wire and close to the wire due to the gas avalanche most of the electron - ion pairs are produced .",
    "the ions ( the ring in fig.6 , left plot ) drift in a time scale of 4 ms to the tube wall .",
    "these space charges contribute to the total drift field . for big radii the field",
    "is enhanced and one gets faster drift times , whereas the field reduction at small radii lead to less gas gain .",
    "both effects account for the degradation of the tube resolution .",
    "garfield simulations@xcite of the tube resolution including the field change and gain drop confirm measured results of the dependence of the resolution on the @xmath4-background count rate for 30 mm drift tubes ( see fig.7 ) ."
