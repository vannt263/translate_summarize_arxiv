    "inside rotationally excited baryons , qcd leads to the formation of diquarks well separated from the remaining quark . at this separation",
    "the scalar , spin independent , confining part of the effective qcd potential is dominant .",
    "since qcd forces are also flavor independent , the force between the quark ( @xmath3 ) and the diquark ( @xmath4 ) inside an excited baryon is essentially the same as the one between @xmath3 and the antiquark @xmath5 inside an excited meson .",
    "thus , the approximate spin - flavor independence of hadronic physics expressed by @xmath0 symmetry gets extended to the @xmath6 supersymmetry through a symmetry between @xmath5 and @xmath7 , resulting into the parallelism of mesonic and baryonic regge trajectories .",
    "various aspects and implications of this approximate effective supersymmetry and its breaking are discussed in the first section .    in the next section",
    "we discuss the skyrmion approach to effective hadronic lagrangians . in the early @xmath8 s skyrme@xmath9 proposed a model in which baryons can be understood as solitons in an effective lagrangian for bosons .",
    "he added a fourth term to the non - linear sigma model@xmath10 and proposed that the topological soliton solution of the meson field could be identified as a nucleon , and that the winding number is the baryon number .",
    "this pioneering work of skyrme was largely ignored until two decades later when pak and tze@xmath11 , and gipson and tze@xmath12 re - expressed skyrme s ideas in the modern context of qcd and studied their implications for weak interactions . in an attempt to verify one of the skyrme",
    "s conjectures that the winding numbers are the baryon numbers , balachandran and his collaborators@xmath13 considered a system of interacting quarks and solitons .",
    "using some results of goldstone and wilczek@xmath14 , they showed that , in the presence of the classical soliton field , the dirac sea of quarks carries a baryonic current which is same as the topological current .",
    "the possible connections of qcd to effective meson theories are due to t hooft@xmath15 and witten@xmath16 .",
    "they showed that in the limit of large number of colors @xmath17 , qcd can be reduced to a theory of weakly interacting mesons and glue balls . using @xmath18 as an expansion parameter",
    ", witten argued that to leading order , baryons emerge as solitons in the weakly coupled phase of mesons if some topological properties and stability conditions are assumed .",
    "later witten@xmath19 showed that it is necessary to introduce a wess - zumino term in the effective chiral theory in order to predict some observed physical processes allowed by the non - abelian anomaly in qcd .",
    "he also demonstrated that the gauged w - z action can lead to the identification of the topological current with the baryonic current . to verify another skyrme conjecture about topological solitons being fermions , he rotated a skyrmion adiabatically through @xmath20-radians and found that the skyrmion had picked up a phase of @xmath21 .",
    "hence a skyrmion is a fermion if @xmath17 is odd .",
    "afterwards , adkins , nappi and witten@xmath22 systematically studied some static properties of nucleons in an explicit model in which the skyrme lagrangian is invariant under @xmath23 .",
    "these results agreed with experiment to 30 % .",
    "since then , there has been a tremendous interest in the skyrme model .",
    "a good number of modifications to the model have been proposed , such as including the effect of the pion mass@xmath24 , adding higher order terms@xmath25 , extending the symmetry to @xmath26@xmath27 , including vector mesons@xmath28 , hidden symmetry approach@xmath29 , bound state approach to strangeness@xmath30 , and non linear supersymmetric models and relation to skyrmions@xmath31 .",
    "a recent review of supersymmetric chiral models was given by perelomov@xmath32 .",
    "although the skyrme model provides a reasonably good description of baryons , there are many problems which remain to be solved . in the skyrme model ,",
    "if the masses of the low lying baryons @xmath33 and @xmath34 are taken as input parameters , the predicted value of the pion decay constant @xmath35 is found to be too high ; or if the experimental value of @xmath35 is taken as an input , the predicted masses of the nucleons turn out to be too high . because the value @xmath35 is too large , many other predictions which depend on @xmath35",
    "disagree with experiment .",
    "the model also predicts a tower of baryon states with equal spin and isospin ( @xmath36 ) which do not exist in nature .",
    "they are considered artifacts of the model .    quark model , on the other hand , is regarded as an effective theory when the gluon degrees of freedom are integrated out . if both the skyrme model and the quark model are effective models of qcd , they should have common symmetry of hadrons , such as chiral symmetry , the hadronic approximate @xmath0 symmetry@xmath37 and @xmath6 symmetry@xmath38 have been established for the quark model but ways to restore these symmetries for the skyrme model have yet to be found .    in this paper",
    "we address some of these problems , give partial solutions to some of the difficulties by improving the skyrmion model for hadrons and suggest a strategy toward building a full fledged quantitatively viable skyrmionic description of hadronic physics .",
    "supersymmetry is a symmetry between fermions of half odd integer spin and bosons of integer spin . in supergravity ,",
    "for example , we have an action that is invariant under operations transforming fields of spin @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 among themselves@xmath44 . here",
    "we recall that low lying hadrons have the same range of spin values with @xmath45 and @xmath42 baryons interlaced with @xmath46 and @xmath43 mesons .",
    "groups that transform @xmath47 and @xmath40 mesons into each other and simultaneously mix @xmath45 and @xmath42 baryons have been proposed long ago@xmath48 .",
    "this kind of symmetry had to be broken symmetry since no degeneracy is observed between particles of different spin .",
    "however , a cursory glance at the chew - frautschi plot of hadronic trajectories@xmath49 reveals the following features :    * \\(a ) all trajectories with @xmath50 ( hadronic spin ) versus @xmath51 ( @xmath52 hadronic mass ) are approximately linear . *",
    "\\(b ) leading mesonic trajectories associated with lowest spin @xmath53 and @xmath43 are parallel among themselves . *",
    "\\(c ) leading baryonic trajectories associated with @xmath45 , @xmath42 are also parallel among themselves .",
    "* \\(d ) mesonic and baryonic trajectories are approximately parallel to each other with a universal slope of @xmath54 ( gev)@xmath55 .",
    "* \\(e ) the separation between mesonic trajectories is nearly the same as the one between baryonic trajectories .",
    "now , properties ( b ) and ( c ) suggest the existence of a phenomenological symmetry between mesons of different spin , which also operates on baryons with different spin . for hadrons composed of light quarks @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 , this symmetry is expressed by the group @xmath59 where @xmath60 describes the rotational excitations on the leading trajectories , and the spin - flavor group @xmath0 classifies the lowest elements of the trajectories into particle multiplets .",
    "the property ( d ) on the other hand , tells us that there is a new kind of symmetry ( supersymmetry ) between the bosonic mesons and fermionic baryons .",
    "the universal regge slope for hadrons is a supersymmetric observable .",
    "the meaning of property ( e ) is that , the physical mechanism that breaks the @xmath0 symmetry must also be responsible for breaking of its supersymmetric extension .",
    "finally , from property ( a ) we infer that the potential binding the quarks is approximately linear and we have to apply relativistic quantum mechanics appropriate to light quarks while the schroedinger nonrelativistic theory is sufficient for the description of quarkonium systems for heavy quarks .",
    "according to the quark model of gell - mann and zweig , mesons and baryons are described respectively by bound ( @xmath61 ) and @xmath62 systems .",
    "any symmetry between mesons and baryons must correspond at the quark level to a supersymmetry between @xmath5 ( antiquarks ) and bound @xmath7 states ( diquarks ) .",
    "now @xmath5 , with @xmath45 and unitary spin associated with the triplet @xmath63 representation of the flavor @xmath64 belongs to the @xmath65 representation of @xmath0 .",
    "the low lying baryons are in its @xmath66 representation .",
    "since @xmath66 is contained in @xmath67 , the diquark with @xmath47 or @xmath41 must be in the symmetric @xmath68 representation of @xmath0 .",
    "hence the hadronic supersymmetry we are seeking must transform the @xmath69 and @xmath68 @xmath0 multiplets , both color antitriplets into each other and therefore must be @xmath70 dimensional with @xmath71 fermionic and @xmath72 bosonic states .",
    "this supergroup is @xmath6 .",
    "it was first introduced by miyazawa@xmath73 as a generalization of the hadronic @xmath0 symmetry , following earlier attempts by hwa and nuyts@xmath74 .    the @xmath75 symmetry that also implies @xmath76 symmetry will transform the meson ( @xmath77 in general not only to baryons @xmath62 and antibaryons @xmath78 but also to exotic mesons @xmath79 ( @xmath80 , and @xmath81 ) that belong to the @xmath0 representations @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "the @xmath84 and @xmath85 are @xmath86 and @xmath87 mesons while the ( @xmath83 ) also includes mesons with spin @xmath88 and isospin @xmath43 .",
    "all the low lying hadrons will now be in the adjoint representation of @xmath6 with both spin and isospin taking values @xmath89 and @xmath43 .",
    "the next introduction of supersymmetry into physics was within the context of dual resonance models that evolved later into string models .",
    "these theories due to ramond@xmath90 and neveu and schwarz@xmath91 lead naturally to linear baryon and meson trajectories that are parallel .",
    "the string models were not local and they were not relativistic in four dimensions .",
    "examples of renormalizable relativistic local quantum field theories involving @xmath92 and @xmath41 fields with interaction were first constructed by wess and zumino@xmath93 following initial attempts by other authors@xmath94 .",
    "wess and zumino based their work on the super - poincar algebra that is a supersymmetric generalization of the infinitesimal poincar group and sits in the superconformal algebra .",
    "the final step of incorporating @xmath95 and @xmath96 fields in a local relativistic field theory was taken by the discoverers of supergravity@xmath44 and extended supergravity who were able to supersymmetrize einstein s general relativity and kaluza - klein theories .",
    "all these local supersymmetric quantum field theories have fascinating convergence and symmetry properties but they are far from describing properties of hadrons or even quarks and leptons .",
    "if these fundamental fields have any physical reality at all , they may be associated with preons ( or haplons ) that would be hypothetical constituents of quarks , leptons and fundamental gauge bosons .",
    "returning to the more concrete world of hadrons , we may try to see if the phenomenological approximate group @xmath0 and its supersymmetric extension can be justified within the standard theory of colored quarks interacting through gluons that are associated with the color gauge group @xmath97 .",
    "the justification of @xmath0 and the derivation of its breaking was given by georgi , glashow and de rujula@xmath98 .",
    "on the other hand , a phenomenological supersymmetry in nuclear physics between odd and even nuclei was discovered and formulated by means of supergroups@xmath99 @xmath100 by balantekin , bars and iachello@xmath101 .",
    "it was natural to see if such groups could also describe hadronic supersymmetry .",
    "in the first part of this paper we propose to extend the approach of georgi et al . to see",
    "how far it can provide a basis for the existence of an approximate hadronic supersymmetry .",
    "it turns out that most of the ingredients for this approach are already in the literature .",
    "the key concepts are :    * \\(a ) * the approximate validity of the string theory * as an approximation to qcd .",
    "this was shown by the lattice gauge theory as a strong coupling approximation to qcd , following the pioneering work of wilson@xmath102 and also by the elongated bag model of johnson and thorn@xmath103 following the bag model@xmath104 approximation to qcd .",
    "* \\(b ) * the emergence of the diquark structure * in qcd through the string approximation .",
    "this was done by eguchi@xmath105 and also by johnson and thorn@xmath103 . *",
    "\\(c ) the vector ( spin dependent ) nature of the coulomb part together with the scalar ( spin independent ) nature of the confining part of the @xmath106 potential .",
    "these properties were collectively worked out by many authors using both perturbation theory and lattice gauge theory methods@xmath107 . *",
    "\\(d ) the necessity for introducing exotic @xmath79 mesons in qcd through the bag approximation@xmath108 , the string picture@xmath109 or the confining potential model@xmath110 . *",
    "\\(e ) deviations from linearity of regge trajectories within the context of qcd@xmath49 .",
    "once all the parts of this jigsaw puzzle is put together , a rather simple picture emerges .",
    "the diquark behaves very much like the antiquark in the strong coupling regime because qcd forces are flavor independent and the confining part of qcd potential is spin independent .",
    "this immediately leads to a @xmath111 effective supersymmetry at large separation . at short distances ,",
    "spin is approximately conserved because of asymptotic freedom but spin independence gets broken through one - gluon exchange in the perturbation theory regime .",
    "the diquark structure also disappears at short distance , leading to the breaking of both @xmath0 and @xmath6 at low energies .",
    "there is another difficulty associated with a supersymmetric extension of @xmath0 noted by salam and sthrathdee@xmath112 . because of the anticommutativity of the grassmann numbers and also of supercharges , antisymmetrical representations of @xmath0 like @xmath113 for diquarks and @xmath114 for baryons will occur in hadronic supermultiplets . in the case of colored quarks , however , it is possible to introduce non associative grassmann numbers @xmath115 and @xmath116 constructed out of octonion units@xmath117 .",
    "they transform like a triplet under the @xmath64 subgroup of the automorphism group @xmath118 of octonions . then the octonionic quarks @xmath119 and @xmath120 will commute unlike @xmath121 and @xmath122 that are anticommutative ( @xmath123 and @xmath124 are combined spin - flavor indices ) .",
    "this procedure which is the basis of color algebra not only converts antisymmetrical spin - flavor group representations into symmetrical ones , but suppresses the color sextet @xmath65 representations for diquarks that would otherwise be allowed under the rule for the preservation of the pauli principle for the colored quark states . with the introduction of octonionic quarks , diquarks , mesons and baryons can all be viewed as elements of an octonionic superalgebra@xmath38 .",
    "the simplest supersymmetric hamiltonian is obtained starting from semirelativistic dynamical models of quarks and diquarks already used by lichtenberg et al.,@xmath125 for an approximate calculation of baryonic masses . in the following subsections",
    "we will first give a derivation of hadronic mass formulae using semi - relativistic and relativistic formulation .",
    "later , in section 2 using the skyrmion model we will show that we obtain the same mass formulae .",
    ".    in qcd ,",
    "both @xmath106 and @xmath127 forces are attractive , the color factor of the latter being half of that of the former .",
    "thus , the formation of diquarks inside a baryon is a definite possibility .",
    "various strong coupling approximations to qcd , like lattice gauge theory@xmath102 @xmath107 , t hooft s @xmath128 approximation ( when @xmath17 , the number of colors is very large ) , or the elongated bag model@xmath103 all give a linear potential between widely separated quarks and an effective string that approximates the gluon flux tube .",
    "in such a theory , eguchi@xmath105 has shown that it is energetically favorable for three quarks in a baryon to form a linear structure with a quark in the middle and two at the ends or , for high rotational excitation , a bilocal linear structure with one quark at one end and a diquark at the other end .",
    "this was reconfirmed by johnson and thorn independently in the bag model when the bag is deformed and elongated in a rotationally excited baryon@xmath103 . thus if we move along a leading baryon regge trajectory to a region of high @xmath50 , we are likely to find a baryon as a bilocal object consisting of a quark and a diquark instead of a trilocal object that represents a ground state baryon more accurately . on the other hand",
    "a meson is a bilocal object consisting of a quark and an antiquark interacting via a linear potential at large separation .",
    "consider then a bilocal object with constituents with respective masses @xmath129 , @xmath130 , spins @xmath131 , @xmath132 and color representations @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "one of the constituents can be a quark @xmath3 or the anti - diquark @xmath135 ( both color triplets ) while the other can be an antiquark @xmath5 or a diquark @xmath136 which are both color antitriplets .",
    "the qcd force between the two constituents will be flavor independent and it will consist of two parts : a coulomb like part @xmath137 which transforms like the time component of a @xmath138-vector ( due to the exchange of single @xmath139 gluons at short separations ) and a confining part @xmath140 which is largely a relativistic scalar , is spin independent and is due to the exchange of a great many gluons that form a flux tube or an elongated bag at large separation of the constituents .",
    "let @xmath141 and @xmath142 be the center of mass momenta of the two constituents .",
    "the quantity which is canonically conjugate to the relative coordinate @xmath143 is    @xmath144    ignoring the center of mass motion , following lichtenberg et al.@xmath38 , we can write a semi - relativistic wave equation for the wave function @xmath145 of the bilocal object with energy eigenvalues @xmath146 , namely    @xmath147^{\\frac{1}{2 } } + [ ( m_2 + \\frac{1}{2}~v_s)^2 -\\nabla^2)]^{\\frac{1}{2 } } \\ } \\psi_{12 } \\label{eq : bir}\\ ] ]    the scalar and vector potentials are given by    @xmath148    where @xmath149 is the color factor , @xmath150 is the strong coupling constant at the energy @xmath146 , and the spin dependent part of the vector potential is the hyperfine structure correction due to gluon exchange with @xmath151 .",
    "we see that at large @xmath152 , neglecting the mass difference @xmath153 , we find the same equation for both the @xmath154 and the @xmath155 system , except for the presence of the hyperfine term that breaks the symmetry between @xmath5 and @xmath136 . to this approximation",
    ", we can transform the second constituent @xmath5 into @xmath136 and vice - versa without changing the energy eigenvalue @xmath156 .",
    "this means that the system admits the approximate @xmath6 supersymmetry transformation    @xmath157    @xmath158    in addition to the @xmath0 transformation    @xmath159    @xmath160    the breaking of both @xmath0 and @xmath6 is due to the hyperfine term while the supersymmetry is further broken by the quark - diquark mass difference @xmath161 .",
    "we could also have brought into play the wave functions @xmath162 and @xmath163 of the diquark and antidiquark at point @xmath164 in the field of the quark at point @xmath164 .",
    "the masses @xmath129 and @xmath130 must then be replaced by the reduced masses    @xmath165    in this case , the wave function belongs to the fundamental @xmath70 dimensional representation of @xmath6 and the hamiltonian commutes with the supersymmetry transformation eq.([eq : iki ] ) of the wave function except for the difference in the reduced masses @xmath166 and @xmath167 and the hyperfine structure term in the hamiltonian .",
    "the breaking of supersymmetry results in the mass difference    @xmath168    at high energies both for baryons and mesons . at low energies ,",
    "the baryon mass becomes a trilocal object with three quarks and the mass splitting is given by    @xmath169    where @xmath129 , @xmath130 and @xmath170 are the masses of the three different quark constituents .",
    "going back to the first formulation which is more symmetrical , we can write the hamiltonian associated with eq.([eq : bir ] ) in a @xmath6 covariant form : we have four cases for @xmath171 , namely @xmath172 , @xmath173 , @xmath174 and @xmath175 that represents mesons , exotic mesons , baryons and antibaryons with respective dimensions @xmath176 , @xmath177 , @xmath178 , and @xmath179 that all fit into the following @xmath180 adjoint representation of @xmath6 :    @xmath181    the wave equation for the hadronic wavefunction @xmath182 can now be written as    @xmath183+\\mbox{\\boldmath$s$ } \\psi \\mbox{\\boldmath$s$ }   \\label{eq : sekiz}\\ ] ]    where @xmath184 is the diagonal matrix    @xmath185    with    @xmath186^{\\frac{1}{2 } }   \\nonumber\\ ] ]    @xmath187^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\ ] ]    and    @xmath188    the second , spin dependent term on the right hand side of eq.([eq : sekiz ] ) is a symmetry breaking term for both @xmath0 and @xmath6 .",
    "the first term is @xmath0 symmetrical .",
    "it also preserves the supersymmetry in the limit @xmath189 .",

    "the hamiltonian @xmath199 commutes with the generators of the transformation eq.([eq : onbir ] ) .",

    "we can write    @xmath200    where @xmath201 is associated with the orbital excitation of the system . for high rotational excitations , the expectation value of @xmath152 is large , corresponding to a stretched string .",
    "the angular momentum @xmath201 is also large .",
    "the value of the centrifugal energy which is proportional to @xmath202 has a similarly large value .",
    "since @xmath140 that is proportional to @xmath152 will also have a high absolute value , the constituent masses become negligible in the high relativistic limit . on the other hand ,",

    "the @xmath208 corresponds to the bohr radius for the bound state .",
