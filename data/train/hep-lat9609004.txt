    "in su(2 ) lattice gauge theory the plaquette , @xmath1 takes values from @xmath2 to @xmath3 .",
    "the action studied is @xmath4 if @xmath5 and @xmath6 if @xmath7 , where @xmath8 cutoff parameter , @xmath9 .",
    "for instance , the positive plaquette action@xcite has @xmath10 .",
    "since the continuum limit is determined only by the behavior of the action in an infinitesimal region around its minimum which occurs around @xmath11 , this action should have the same continuum limit as the wilson action for all values of @xmath12 except @xmath13 .",
    "this study was primarily designed to determine whether a sufficiently strong cutoff would cause the system to deconfine . to give the lattices the maximum chance to confine , the strong coupling limit , @xmath14 ,",
    "was taken .",
    "this removes the wilson part of the action completely , leaving only the plaquette restriction .",
    "the study was carried out on symmetric lattices from @xmath15 to @xmath0 in an attempt to study the zero - temperature system . however , as is well known , symmetric lattices are not really at zero temperature until one takes the limit of infinite lattice size .",
    "finite size lattices are at a finite temperature corresponding to their inverse time extent . in this sense , finite symmetric lattices can be thought of as small spatial - volume finite temperature systems .",
    "the big question is whether the transition observed here as a function of the cutoff is a bulk transition which will remain on the infinite lattice , or the remnant of the usual finite temperature transition which will disappear by moving to @xmath13 on the infinite lattice .",
    "the purpose of an action restriction is to eliminate lattice artifacts which occur at strong coupling , and which may give misleading results that have nothing to do with the continuum limit .",
    "for instance , the original motivation of the positive plaquette action was to eliminate single - plaquette @xmath16 monopoles and strings , which were possibly thought to be responsible for confinement @xcite .",
    "however , for strong enough couplings the positive - plaquette action was shown to still confine @xcite . eliminating these artifacts ,",
    "does , however , appear to remove the `` dip '' from the beta - function in the crossover region , possibly improving the scaling properties of the theory , and suggesting that this dip is indeed an artifact of non - universal strong coupling aspects of the wilson action .    for the u(1 ) theory ,",
    "all monopoles are eliminated for @xmath17 , since in this case six plaquettes can not carry a visible flux totaling @xmath18 , ( @xmath19 ) . therefore a dirac string can not end and there are no monopoles .",
    "the theory will be deconfined for all @xmath20 for @xmath21 , since confinement is due to single - plaquette monopoles in this theory .",
    "su(2 ) confinement may be related to u(1 ) confinement through abelian projection .",
    "it is an interesting question whether a similar action restriction which limits the non - abelian flux carried by an su(2 ) plaquette will eliminate the associated abelian monopoles causing deconfinement , or whether surviving large monopoles can keep su(2 ) confining for all couplings .",
    "a related question is how can the su(2 ) average plaquette go to unity in the weak coupling limit , but the corresponding effective u(1 ) average plaquette stay in the strong coupling confining region ( @xmath22 ) ?",
    "chernodub et .",
    "al .  have found @xmath23 over a wide range of couplings @xcite .",
    "a deconfining phase transition is observed on all lattices studied ( @xmath15 to @xmath0 ) .",
    "the behavior of the polyakov loop , @xmath24 , shows the normal symmetry breaking behavior and is smooth , suggesting a second or higher order transition ( figs 1,2 ) .",
    "the transition point has a clear lattice size ( n ) dependence ( figs 1,3 ) .",
    "the normalized fourth cumulant , @xmath25 , shows fixed point behavior ( no discernible lattice size dependence ) for @xmath26 at a non - trivial value around @xmath27 ( fig 3 ) .",
    "this suggests either a line of critical points for @xmath28 , e.g. from a massless gluon phase , or that correlation lengths are so large that finite lattice size dependence is hidden . for the standard interpretation to hold",
    "the normalized fourth cumulant should go to zero as lattice size approaches infinity for all values of @xmath12 .",
    "the polyakov loop susceptibility shows signs of diverging with lattice size ( @xmath29 ) for @xmath30 and converging to a finite value for @xmath31 ( fig .",
    "this supports the idea of a different behavior in these regions in the infinite volume limit .",
    "extrapolations of finite lattice `` critical points '' to infinite lattice size are consistent with infinite lattice critical points ranging from around @xmath32 to @xmath33 depending on scaling function assumed , so are basically inconclusive ( fig 5 ) .",
    "although a straightforward extrapolation gives infinite lattice critical cutoff around @xmath32 , a logarithmic scaling function can be made consistent with @xmath34 in which case the transition would no longer exist on the infinite lattice .",
    "finally , the pseudo - specific heat from plaquette fluctuations shows a definite signal of a broad peak or shoulder beginning to form for the largest lattice sizes ( fig 6 ) , near the location of deconfinement .",
    "interestingly , no noticeable effect was seen here on the smaller lattices , but the @xmath35 and @xmath0 results are definitely shifted up .",
    "this indicates a rather large scaling exponent .",
    "preliminary analysis shows an exponent near @xmath36 , i.e. a peak height diverging according to the space - time volume ( if indeed it is a peak ) .",
    "this would indicate a possible weak first - order transition .",
    "since this is a bulk ( local in space - time ) quantity , a divergence here would be a surprise for a finite - temperature transition",
    ". clearly larger lattices and better statistics are needed to get the full picture behind this rich and interesting system .",
    "the imposition of an action restriction clearly induces a deconfining `` phase transition '' on a finite symmetric lattice , even in the strong coupling limit ( of course there really is no phase transition on a finite lattice ) .",
    "the extrapolation to infinite lattice size is , as always , difficult .",
    "there are two possibilities .",
    "evidence is consistent with deconfinement on the infinite lattice for all @xmath37 , representing possibly a massless gluon phase in the continuum limit , similar to the u(1 ) continuum limit .",
    "it should be remembered that the compact u(1 ) theory itself undergoes a similar deconfining transition at @xmath38 . the mechanism in both cases may be the same , namely that limiting the flux that can be carried by an individual plaquette prevents a dirac string from ending , and spilling its flux out in all directions in the form of a point monopole .",
    "although it has proven hard to identify monopoles in the su(2 ) theory , the identification of them with abelian monopoles appearing in the maximal abelian gauge suggests a possibly similar behavior in su(2 ) and u(1 ) .",
    "it is also possible , however , that all signs of critical behavior will disappear on large enough lattices , nothing will diverge , and the theory will confine for all values of c , ( i.e. @xmath34 ) , the apparent critical behavior being due to the finite temperature associated with finite @xmath29 .",
    "however , as a small 3-volume usually _ masks _ critical behavior by smoothing would - be criticalities it is difficult to see how this could explain the large divergent - looking finite size effects being seen here .",
    "it is especially difficult to explain the large - lattice behavior of the pseudo - specific heat . due to the small spatial volume and the fact that one is very far from the scaling region , however , it is rather difficult to make definite predictions from this scenario .",
    "one also must remember that our parameter is the cutoff , @xmath12 , and not the coupling constant .",
    "although @xmath12 does seem to play the role of an effective coupling , ( with @xmath39 corresponding to @xmath40 in the wilson theory , and @xmath13 corresponding to @xmath41 ) , it certainly differs in some respects .",
    "incidentally , the average plaquette at @xmath38 is 0.7449 , corresponding to a wilson @xmath20 of around 3.2 .",
    "this relatively weak coupling means that rather large lattices will be needed to disentangle the finite temperature effects , from any possible underlying bulk transition .",
    "it is likely that further light could be shed on this subject by gauge transforming configurations from restricted action simulations to the maximum abelian gauge and extracting abelian monopole loops .",
    "this would answer the question of what effect the su(2 ) action restriction has on the corresponding abelian monopoles . by studying the strength of the monopole suppression it may be possible to tell whether a sufficient density of monopoles will survive the continuum limit to produce a confining theory .",
    "such a study is underway .",
    "it is clear that gauge configurations from the restricted action will be relatively smoother on the smallest scale .",
    "it should be pointed out , however , that anything can ( and does ) still happen at larger scales .",
    "for instance with @xmath38 , even the @xmath42 wilson loop can take on any value .",
    "the maximum flux carried by a plaquette is only limited to roughly @xmath43 of its unrestricted value , i.e. around the value expected on a lattice twice as fine as that in a typical unrestricted simulation . from this point of view",
    ", one should only need lattices twice as large in linear extent to see the same physics in a @xmath44 restricted simulation as in an unrestricted simulation .",
    "the smoother configurations produced by restrictions of this strength may also eliminate or at least suppress dislocations , possibly enabling one to study instantons without the need for cooling .",
