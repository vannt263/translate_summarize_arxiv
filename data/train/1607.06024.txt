    "supersymmetry @xcite is , in our opinion , one of the most interesting idea which has appeared in physics over the last 50 years .",
    "it is the only other space - time symmetry , beside the poincar invariance , which has been proposed for flat space - time .",
    "moreover it has a unique role in taming the ultraviolet divergences of quantum field theories @xcite .",
    "unfortunately so far there is no experimental indication of it .",
    "it may be that the phenomenological models that have been tested are not the ones which nature uses .",
    "but it may also be that there are further theoretical aspects of supersymmetry ( susy ) which have not been investigated in enough details .",
    "this paper is a modest attempt in this direction .",
    "susy is a symmetry which put in the same multiplets fields of different statistics , boson and fermions .",
    "a short manner to write up all these fields in a single multiplet is via the concept @xciteof superfield .",
    "this concept was crucial also in order to bring to light the geometry hiding behind susy .",
    "this geometry is related to the concept of superspace which is an extension of ordinary space - time .",
    "the superfields usually have a first component , a known physical field like the electron field or the quark or the higgs , while the other components are partner fields which should somehow appear in nature .    the manner to obtain the first component from the superfield",
    "is to bring to zero the grassmannian partners of space - time .",
    "this is a very rude manner to proceed which does not throw any light in the interplay between the superfield and its first component which is usually also the only physical components discovered so far . in this paper",
    "we wiil study another manner to go from the superfield to its first component .",
    "it is based on a similarity transformation on the superfield .",
    "the generators of this transformation belong to the susy algebra in the case of 1-dimensional system and to the enveloping algebra in the 4-dim case .    for the 1-dim case",
    "the similarity transformation is basically a sort of change of picture from the heisenberg to the schrdinger one with respect to the grasmannian partner of time . in the 4-dim case we have not succedeed in giving such a clear - cut interpretation .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in sect .",
    "[ sect2 ] we analise a particular 1-dim . symmetric model which is basically a modern version to rewrite classical mechanics . in sect .",
    "[ sect3 ] we analise the 4-dim case of a scalar superfield . in this case",
    "tt first we perform , like for the 1-dim case , a similarity transformation which is a transformation in the superpartners of space - time .",
    "we prove that this transformation does not bring the superfield to its first components but to the set of its scalar components . in sect .",
    "[ sect4 ] we apply to this first transformation a second one but built with elements of the enveloping algebra of susy .",
    "this set of combined transformations brings the superfield to its first component .",
    "some long and detailed calculations are confined to few appendices .",
    "the 1-dim model we will analyse in this section made its appearance in a path - integral approach to classical mechanics summarized in ref .",
    ".the lagrangian which appeared there is the following one : @xmath2 where @xmath3 are the @xmath4-phase space coordinates of a classical point particle @xmath5 the @xmath6 are auxiliary variables dependent on the 1-dim @xmath7 variable , the index `` @xmath8 '' runs from 1 to @xmath9 and @xmath10 are variables of grassmannian parity .",
    "@xmath11 is the symplectic matrix of the original space of the @xmath12 variables @xmath13 and @xmath14 is a function of @xmath15 which plays here the role of a superpotential but originally was the hamiltonian of the classical system moving on the @xmath12 space .",
    "the readers interested in the relation between @xmath16 and the original classical system moving in the @xmath15-space can consult ref .  . here",
    "let us only mention that the @xmath17 turn out to be the basis of differential form on @xmath15 -space and that @xmath16 turns out to be related to the lie - derivative of the hamiltonian flow @xcite .",
    "as @xmath16 makes its appearance in a path - integral we can calculate @xcite the graded commutators @xcite among the @xmath18 variables @xmath19 .",
    "the only non - zero graded commutators are the following ones @xmath20 & = & i\\,\\delta_b^a\\\\ \\left[c^a,\\bar c_b\\right ] & = & \\delta_b^a.\\\\ \\end{matrix } \\label{eq:8 - 1}\\ ] ] the hamiltonian associated to the lagrangian ( [ eq:6 - 1 ] ) is @xmath21 and it is easy to prove that it commutes with the following charges @xmath22 besides commuting with @xmath23 it is easy to check that @xmath24=2\\,i\\,\\widetilde{\\mathcal h}.    \\label{eq:8 - 4}\\ ] ] so the @xmath25 are generators of an @xmath26 supersymmetry @xcite .",
    "there are other charges which commute with @xmath27 @xcite but we are not interested in them in this paper .",
    "an important tool introduced in refs .   for supersymmetry is the one of superfield .",
    "this is basically a manner to put in the same multiplet all the @xmath18 variables @xmath19 .",
    "first we extend the base - space @xmath7 via two grassmannian partner @xmath28 to what is called a superspace @xmath29 .",
    "next we introduce a function @xmath30 in this superspace defined as follows : @xmath31 in this superspace it is easy to give to the charges a differential - operator representation ,",

    "in  [ appendixa ] we will prove the first of ( [ eq:10 - 1 ] ) .",
    "the others are easy to derive .",
    "now let us turn to the goal of this paper , i.e. to build a similarity transformation which project out of the superfield @xmath36 of ( [ eq:9 - 1 ] ) its first component @xmath12 .",
    "trivially it could be obtained freezing to zero @xmath37 : @xmath38 but we would like to do it in a different manner that could be given a physical interpretation like it happens in the 1-dimensional case .",
    "what we will do here is already contained in ref .. but we present it again for completeness and in order to help the reader not familiar with ref .   + it is easy to prove that the similarity transformation we are looking for is the following @xmath39 the proof of the formula above is contained in ref .  . and for completeness we will reproduce it here in  [ appendixb ] . using ( [ eq:12 - 1 ] ) it is not difficult to prove a generalization of that formula which is the following : @xmath40 the proof of this formula has been done in ref .   and we shall not do it again here .",
    "it is also easy to prove the inverse of ( [ eq:12 - 1 ] ) and ( [ eq:12 - 2 ] ) , i.e. @xmath41 and @xmath42    it is now amusing to give a physical interpretation of these formulas .",
    "we said that @xmath43 are grassmannian partner of @xmath7 and more details can be found in ref .  .",
    "with respect to @xmath7 we can have the usual heisenberg and scroedinger picture of the system and the same is possible with respect to @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the observables in the heisenberg picture depend on @xmath7 while they do nt in the schroedinger picture .",
    "the same is possible for the grassmannian partners @xmath43 of @xmath7 .",
    "we can have a picture in which the observables depend on @xmath37 ( which we will call heisenberg picyure for @xmath37 ) and one in which the observables do not depend on @xmath37 ( the schroedinger picture in @xmath37 ) .",
    "looking now at ( [ eq:13 - 1 ] ) and ( [ eq:13 - 2 ] ) we can say that the superfield @xmath46 is the heisenberg picture in @xmath37 of the variables @xmath3 . the same for the general observable @xmath47 as proved by formula ( [ eq:13 - 2 ] ) .",
    "this is the physical interpretation of the similarity transformation we mentioned at the beginning and we like it .",
    "it may throw further light on the interplay between the superfield and its first component .",
    "for sure it throws more light that the naive procedure of getting one from the other by naively putting @xmath37 to zero .",
    "in this section we will try to do the same we did in section [ sect2 ] but for a relativistic field theory in @xmath48-dim .",
    "we will use the wess - zumino model @xcite in the notation of ref .  .",
    "the superspace in this case will be made of @xmath48-dim .",

    "notice that the @xmath72 carry mixed indeces @xmath73 while its adjoint is defined as @xmath74 the various expressions without explict index notation appearing in ( [ eq:17 - 1 ] ) are defined as follows : @xmath75    note that differently than the scalar superfiend in 1-dim of eq.([eq:9 - 1 ] ) , the scalar superfield in 4-dim of ( [ eq:17 - 1 ] ) contains up to 4-power in @xmath76 , because these @xmath44 and @xmath77 carry two indices .    in the weyl - formulation the supersymmetry charges @xmath78 are two and each carries two indices : @xmath79 the supersymmetry ( or super - poincar algebra ) is the following one @xmath80&=&0\\\\ \\left[(\\bar q_h)_{\\dot a},(\\bar q_h)_{\\dot b}\\right]&=&0\\\\ \\left[(q_h)_a,(\\bar q_h)_{\\dot b}\\right]&=&2\\,\\left(\\sigma^\\mu\\right)_{a\\dot b}\\,p_\\mu \\end{matrix } ,    \\label{eq:18 - 1}\\ ] ] where @xmath81 is the 4-momentum operator .",

    "note that @xmath92 are given in ( [ eq:19 - 2 ] ) and are not the supersymmetry charges but the generators of translations in @xmath44 and @xmath77 in analogy to the 1-dim case . in this manner ,",
    "if ( [ eq:20 - 1 ] ) would give the first component of the superfield , we could say that this last one is the heisenberg picture representation of its first component .    in order to perform the calculation ( [ eq:20 - 1 ] ) we need first to find out the expression for the exponentials surrounding @xmath93 .",
    "it is easy to prove that @xmath94 while the other exponential @xmath95 is nothing else than the r.h.s . of ( [ eq:21 - 1 ] ) with @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "we note that , because @xmath98 carries two indices , in the r.h.s . of ( [ eq:21 - 1 ] )",
    "we have up to quartic terms like @xmath99 .",
    "we will never find cubic terms in @xmath44 or in @xmath77 .",
    "this is the crucial difference with respect to the 1-dim case . in ( [ eq:21 - 1 ] )",
    "the convention we have used is to put round brackets @xmath100 around quantities which have their indeces saturated with each other like it is done in ( [ eq:16 - 3 ] ) .",
    "moreover in ( [ eq:21 - 1 ] ) we use the convention of putting in front all the strings of @xmath44 and @xmath45 and behind the operators @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "going back to ( [ eq:21 - 1 ] ) , in order to understand how the indeces are saturated among quantities which are not incapsulated inside round brackets , let us explicitily write few terms present in ( [ eq:21 - 1 ] ) .",
    "so for example : @xmath101 let us now insert ( [ eq:21 - 1 ] ) and its conjugate into eq .",
    "( [ eq:20 - 1 ] ) and let us perform the calculations .",
    "these are rather long and some samples of them are reproduced in [ appendixc ] .",
    "the final result is the following : @xmath102 where @xmath103 are the scalar and pseudocalar fields component of the superfield ( [ eq:17 - 1 ] ) .",
    "we immediately notice that our similarity transformation does not give us just the first component @xmath104 of the superfield like in the 1-dim .",
    "case ( see ( [ eq:12 - 1 ] ) ) .",
    "so this is not the transformation we are looking for .",
    "anyhow the result ( [ eq:23 - 1 ] ) is consistent with ( [ eq:12 - 1 ] ) .",
    "infact if the @xmath44 and @xmath45 in ( [ eq:23 - 1 ] ) had no index , then @xmath105 and the last three terms on the r.h.s . of ( [ eq:23 - 1 ] ) would be zero leaving only the first term like in ( [ eq:12 - 1 ] ) .    at this point",
    "we were tempted by the idea that if we had started with a superfield containing less components than the one in ( [ eq:17 - 1 ] ) , we may have ended up in the r.h.s . of ( [ eq:23 - 1 ] ) with less fields as even just one .",
    "the superfield with less components that we know are the chiral and antichiral superfields.they are also called lefthanded ( l ) or righthanded ( r ) chiral superfields .",
    "we will use the notation of ref .   and",
    "they are given by : @xmath106 where @xmath107 and @xmath108 are the complex scalar fields of no definite parity and @xmath109 is a weyl fermion field .",
    "doing the similarity transformation analog of ( [ eq:20 - 1 ] ) for @xmath110 and @xmath111 we get : @xmath112 so we conclude that also for the chiral superfields our similarity transformation does not lead us to the first component but to a combination of the scalar fields present in the original field . the calculations that lead to the results ( [ eq:25 - 1 ] ) are rather easy .",
    "basically we started identifying the fields present on the r.h.s .",
    "of ( [ eq:17 - 1 ] ) with the analog ones present on the r.h.s . of ( [ eq:24 - 1 ] ) and",
    "the first of eq.([eq:25 - 1 ] ) .",
    "some of them turned out to be zero . once",
    "this identification was done we plugged it in the r.h.s . of ( [ eq:23 - 1 ] ) and",
    "immediately we got eqs.([eq:25 - 1 ] ) .",
    "let us now go back to ( [ eq:23 - 1 ] ) and let us define with @xmath113 the r.h.s . of ( [ eq:23 - 1 ] ) : @xmath114 so ( [ eq:23 - 1 ] ) can be written as : @xmath115 as we said in the previous section the reason that the r.h.s . of ( [ eq:27 - 1 ] ) is different from @xmath104 is because the grassmannian variables @xmath44 are two : @xmath116 , and the same for the @xmath77 .",
    "we should then look for a differential operator which kills term like @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "the @xmath119 , from its definition ( [ eq:19 - 2 ] ) , kills only one @xmath44 or one @xmath45 .",
    "we need something like a double derivative .",
    "we tried on @xmath120 the following similarity transformation : @xmath121 where @xmath122 and @xmath123 are parameters to be adjusted in order for the result of ( [ eq:28 - 1 ] ) to be the @xmath104 of ( [ eq:27 - 1 ] ) .",
    "if this were possible then the combination of the similarity transformation ( [ eq:27 - 2 ] ) and ( [ eq:28 - 1 ] ) would manage to turn the superfield into its first component which was our original goal . a long set of calculations ( of which some samples are reported in [ appendixd ] ) shows that a choice of @xmath124 , which leads to the result we want , exists and it is @xmath125 .",

    "we tried other kind of transformations like : @xmath132 this new charge generates still a translation in @xmath98 like the @xmath133 but it does not act as a translation on quadratic function of @xmath44 , so its geometric meaning is lost .",

    "this transformation can be built from the generators of the supersymmetry algebra ( or better from a supertranslation ) , in 4-dim this was not possible and we had to use the generators of the enveloping algebra .",
    "this took away the possibility to interpret the similarity transformation as an heisenberg picture transformation in the grassmannian time like in 1-dim .",
    "some extra work could be done along the directions indicated at the end of section [ sect4 ] .",
    "that means to try to see if there are changes on the generators and the space @xmath37 which would turn our similarity transformation in some translation in a modified space .",
