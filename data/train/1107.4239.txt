    "in his contribution to the 1962 international congress of mathematicians , igor shafarevich formulated an influential conjecture , considering smooth , projective families @xmath1 of curves of genus @xmath2 , over a fixed smooth quasi - projective base curve @xmath3 .",
    "one part of the conjecture , known as the `` hyperbolicity conjecture '' , gives a sufficient criterion to guarantee that any such family is isotrivial .",
    "the conjecture was shown in two seminal works by parshin and arakelov , including the following special case .",
    "[ thm : shafarevich ] let @xmath1 be a smooth , complex , projective family of curves of genus @xmath2 , over a smooth quasi - projective base curve @xmath3 . if @xmath3 is isomorphic to one of the following varieties ,    * the projective line @xmath4 , * the affine line @xmath5 , * the affine line minus one point @xmath6 , or * an elliptic curve ,    then any two fibres of @xmath7 are necessarily isomorphic .    throughout this paper , a _",
    "family _ is a flat morphism of algebraic varieties with connected fibres .",
    "we always work over the complex number field .",
    "following standard convention , we refer to theorem  [ thm : shafarevich ] as `` shafarevich hyperbolicity conjecture '' rather than `` arakelov - parshin theorem '' .",
    "the reader interested in a complete picture is referred to @xcite , where all parts of the shafarevich conjecture are discussed in more detail .",
    "formulated in modern terms , theorem  [ thm : shafarevich ] asserts that any morphism from a smooth , quasi - projective curve @xmath3 to the moduli stack of algebraic curves is necessarily constant if @xmath3 is one of the special curves mentioned in the theorem . if @xmath3 is a quasi - projective variety of arbitrary dimension , then any morphism from @xmath3 to the moduli stack contracts all rational and elliptic curves , as well as all affine lines and @xmath6s that are contained in @xmath3 .",
    "we refer to ( * ? ? ?",
    "16.e.1 ) for a discussion of the relation between the shafarevich hyperbolicity conjecture and the notions of brody and kobayashi hyperbolicity .",
    "this survey is concerned with generalisations of the shafarevich hyperbolicity conjecture to higher dimensions , concentrating on methods and results that relate moduli and minimal model theory .",
    "we hope that the methods presented here will be applicable to a much wider ranges of problems , in moduli theory and elsewhere .",
    "the list of problems that we would like to address include the following .",
    "apart from the quasi - projective curves mentioned above , what other varieties admit only constant maps to the moduli stack of curves ?",
    "what about moduli stacks of higher dimensional varieties ? given a variety @xmath3 , is there a good geometric description of the subvarieties that will always be contracted by any morphism to any reasonable moduli stack ?",
    "much progress has been achieved in the last years and several of the questions can be answered today .",
    "it turns out that there is a close connection between the minimal model program of a given quasi - projective variety @xmath3 , and its possible morphisms to moduli stacks .",
    "some of the answers obtained are in fact consequences of this connection .    in the limited number of pages available ,",
    "we say almost nothing about the history of higher dimensional moduli , or about the large body of important works that approach the problem from other points of view .",
    "hardly any serious attempt is made to give a comprehensive list of references , and the author apologises to all those whose works are not adequately represented here , be it because of the author s ignorance or simply because of lack of space .",
    "the reader who is interested in a broader overview of higher dimensional moduli , its history , complete references , and perhaps also in rigidity questions for morphisms to moduli stacks is strongly encouraged to consult the excellent surveys found in this handbook and elsewhere , including @xcite .",
    "a gentle and very readable introduction to moduli of higher dimensional varieties in also found in @xcite , while viehweg s book @xcite serves as a standard technical reference for the construction of moduli spaces .",
    "most relevant notions and facts from minimal model theory can either be found in the introductory text @xcite , or in the extremely clear and well - written reference book @xcite .",
    "recent progress in minimal model theory is surveyed in @xcite .",
    "section  [ sec : generalization ] introduces a number of conjectural generalisations of the shafarevich hyperbolicity conjecture and gives an overview of the results that have been obtained in this direction .",
    "in particular , we mention results relating the moduli map and the minimal model program of the base of a family .    sections  [ sec : vz ] and [ sec : ext ] introduce the reader to methods that have been developed to attack the conjectures mentioned in section  [ sec : generalization ] . while section  [ sec : vz ] concentrates on positivity results on moduli spaces and on viehweg and zuo s construction of ( pluri-)differential forms on base manifolds of families , section  [ sec : ext ] summarises results concerning differential forms on singular spaces .",
    "both sections contain sketches of proofs which aim to give an idea of the methods that go into the proofs , and which might serve as a guideline to the original literature .",
    "the introduction to section  [ sec : ext ] motivates the results on differential forms by explaining a first strategy of proof for a special case of a ( conjectural ) generalisation of the shafarevich hyperbolicity conjecture . following this plan of attack ,",
    "a more general case is treated in the concluding section  [ sec : ideaofproof ] , illustrating the use of the methods introduced before .",
    "this paper is dedicated to the memory of eckart viehweg .",
    "like so many other mathematicians of his age group , the author benefited immensely from eckart s presence in the field , his enthusiasm , guidance and support .",
    "eckart will be remembered as an outstanding mathematician , and as a fine human being .",
    "the work on this paper was partially supported by the dfg forschergruppe 790 `` classification of algebraic surfaces and compact complex manifolds '' .",
    "patrick graf kindly read earlier versions of this paper and helped to remove several errors and misprints .",
    "many of the results presented here have been obtained in joint work of sndor kovcs and the author .",
    "the author would like to thank sndor for innumerable discussions , and for a long lasting collaboration .",
    "he would also like to thank the anonymous referee for careful reading and for numerous suggestions that helped to improve the quality of this survey .",
    "not all the material presented here is new , and some parts of this survey have appeared in similar form elsewhere .",

    "the first subsection of every chapter lists the sources that the author was aware of .",
    "given its importance in algebraic and arithmetic geometry , much work has been invested to generalise the shafarevich hyperbolicity conjecture , theorem  [ thm : shafarevich ] . historically , the first generalisations have been concerned with families @xmath8 where @xmath3 is still a quasi - projective curve , but where the fibres of @xmath7 are allowed to have higher dimension",
    ". the following elementary example shows , however , that theorem  [ thm : shafarevich ] can not be generalised navely , and that additional conditions must be posed .",
    "[ ex : counter ] consider a smooth projective surface @xmath0 of general type which contains a rational or elliptic curve @xmath9 .",
    "assume that the automorphism group of @xmath0 fixes the curve @xmath10 pointwise .",
    "examples can be obtained by choosing any surface of general type and then blowing up sufficiently many points in sufficiently general position each blow - up will create a rational curve and lower the number of automorphisms .",
    "thus , if @xmath11 and @xmath12 are any two distinct points , then the surfaces @xmath13 obtained by blowing up the points @xmath14 are non - isomorphic .    in order to construct a proper family , consider the product @xmath15 with its projection @xmath16 and with the natural section @xmath17 . if @xmath18 is the blow - up of @xmath15 in @xmath19",
    ", then we obtain a smooth , projective family @xmath20 of surfaces of general type , with the property that no two fibres are isomorphic .",
    "it can well be argued that counterexample  [ ex : counter ] is not very natural , and that the fibres of the family @xmath21 would trivially be isomorphic if they had not been blown up artificially .",
    "this might suggest to consider only families that are `` not the blow - up of something else '' .",
    "one way to make this condition is precise is to consider only _ families of minimal surfaces _ , i.e. , surfaces @xmath22 whose canonical bundle @xmath23 is semiample . in higher dimensions",
    ", it is often advantageous to impose a stronger condition and consider only _ families of canonically polarised manifolds _ , i.e. , manifolds @xmath22 whose canonical bundle @xmath23 is ample .",
