    "in the density functional approach , the set of equations describing the inhomogeneous electron gas in the kohn - sham approximation should be satisfied by the self - consistent distribution of electron density @xmath0 and coulomb potential @xmath1 @xcite . due to the essential nonlinearity of these equations ,",
    "the only general method of self - consistent solution involves iterations using alternately the poisson equation for potential and the set of schrdinger equations for single - particle wave functions in the effective potential @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the exchange - correlation potential in the local density approximation .",
    "a well - known problem of such an approach lies in the necessity of taking into account the boundary conditions of the poisson equation , which impose certain requirements in terms of integral relations on the charge distribution in the right - hand side of this equation @xcite . from the physical point of view",
    ", these integral relations specify , for example , the total charge of the electron system , if the boundary conditions are imposed on the electric field , or the total dipole moment of the system , if the values of potential on the boundaries of an infinite region are fixed .    however , until the self - consistency is reached , the distribution of electron density found by means of the schrdinger equation at each step of iteration process turns out , as a rule , to be incompatible with the poisson boundary conditions specified .",
    "consequently , as shown in @xcite , in the case of infinitely extended systems it is either not possible to build the next step solution at all , or the iteration process lacks convergence as reported , for example , in @xcite .",
    "in such a situation , some authors resort to replacing the process of solving the poisson equation with some kind of variation scheme relative to numerical parameters that specify the functional form chosen to approximate the potential or charge distribution .",
    "this is discussed in more detail in subsections [ subsec_self - levels ] and [ subsec_w simple met ] .    to manage this difficulty",
    "there are several artificial techniques suggested , all of them changing the parameters of the system in question , for example , the compensating background charge density @xcite .",
    "however , the existence and uniqueness of the solution of self - consistent field equations follows from their being obtained as euler - lagrange equations for a variational problem of minimizing the total energy of non - degenerate ground state ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "in such a case the single - particle orbital wave functions and coulomb potential are varied at fixed boundary conditions , while the parameters of the system remain constant . for varying the system parameters over the iteration process one",
    "needs a proof of existence and uniqueness of solution , which is now absent .",
    "another approach suggested in @xcite finds the electrostatic potential @xmath1 by means of a linear integral equation of the second kind , to which the poisson equation is artificially reduced . in so doing ,",
    "the necessity of special measures to maintain compatibility of the poisson boundary conditions with charge distribution obtained at each iteration is allegedly eliminated ( see @xcite , appendix ) .",
    "however it is clear that the exact solution of integral equation , which is equivalent to the original differential one , does not exist either , if some of the compatibility conditions fail to hold .",
    "apparently for this reason , the said method , even if successful , was complemented at each iteration by some unclear renormalization of electron density obtained by means of the schrdinger equation to fulfil the neutrality condition before solving the poisson equation @xcite .",
    "one more drawback of this approach appears to be , in fact , the conservation of screening term in the region without electrons but with nonzero potential , as it is the case in the surface problems .    in this work",
    "we realize the iteration algorithm suggested earlier and described in @xcite , which is applicable to solving the kohn - sham equations for the equilibrium inhomogeneous electron gas and satisfies the boundary conditions for the poisson equation at any shape of electron distribution induced by the effective potential of the previous approximation ( section 2 ) .",
    "the algorithm peculiarities caused by discontinuity of quasiclassical expression for the induced electron density with exchange - correlation potential taken into account are pointed out ( section [ ssec - algorithm / applicat ] ) .",
    "the convergence of the algorithm is demonstrated by example of self - consistent calculations in a model with homogeneous compensating background while studying such problems as : 1 ) self - induced bound states near the surface of barrier - bounded electron gas ( section [ subsec_self - levels ] ) , 2 ) parallel - plate capacitor with real distribution of screening charge accounting for friedel oscillations of electron density ( section [ ssec c - limit ] ) , 3 ) work function and surface energy of simple metals ( section [ sec work function & surf energy ] ) .",
    "the example of a metal - semiconductor tunneling contact with schottky barrier is used to demonstrate the method s applicability to the systems where the current flow is possible ( section [ sec - schottky ] ) .",
    "some of the results were preliminarily presented in @xcite and reported to the russian conferences on semiconductor physics in 2001 - 2007 .",
    "in the kohn - sham approximation , the gas of interacting electrons at temperature @xmath4 is described by the set of equations for single - particle wave functions @xmath5 @xmath6 with the effective potential @xmath7 here @xmath8 is the energy eigenvalue of a single - particle state , and @xmath9 is coulomb potential energy of the electron described by the poisson equation @xmath10 where @xmath11 is positive charge density , @xmath12 is electron density . everywhere , unless otherwise specified , the atomic units @xmath13 are used based on charge @xmath14 and mass @xmath15 of the free electron , when the unit of distance is bohr radius @xmath16 , and the unit of energy is hartree @xmath17 .    the exchange - correlation potential in equation ( [ ueff - def ] )",

    "( [ n(r)-def ] ) does not necessarily comply with them until the self - consistency is reached .",
    "however , if we conceive of the total electron density as the sum @xmath25 where the induced density @xmath26 depends explicitly on the unknown potential , the incompatibility problem of boundary conditions with the right - hand side of poisson equation does not arise because the long - range coulomb interaction is replaced with the screened interaction of finite range . in the kohn - sham theory , the electron density and effective potential can be coupled with an approximate local relation similar to that used for the classical ideal equilibrium fermi gas @xmath27 formula ( [ n_ind - def ] ) can be obtained from the solutions of schrdinger equation ( [ schred - gen ] ) for wave functions of continuous spectrum in quasiclassical approximation by substituting them into eq .",

    "the value @xmath44 accepted in the literature for ` cs ` turns out less than the critical one @xmath45 , which characterizes the stability of homogeneous electron gas in the jellium model with respect to spatially inhomogeneous perturbations .",
    "the impossibility to use the formula ( [ n_ind - def ] ) for induced charge in the case of @xmath46 would make the suggested algorithm inapplicable , so the choice of correlation energy in the form ( [ e_c - def ] ) provides the existence of cesium metal in the framework of calculation technique under development .",
    "there are also other expressions suggested in the literature for correlation energy in the local density approximation lda ( see , for example , discussion in @xcite ) , but for the purposes of this work aimed at demonstrating in detail the application of the new algorithm to a number of classical problems , the specific form of correlation potential is not so important , because the relevant modifications to the expression for @xmath47 lead to only quantitative changes in calculation results , and do not create fundamental difficulties for realization of iteration scheme suggested .",

    "11 ) .",
    "the calculation technique using the induced electron density is clarified more specifically in further sections , where the suggested iteration algorithm is realized in calculating the quantum correction to the capacitance of barrier structures and in finding the work function and surface energy of simple metals in the model with homogeneous positive background . at the same time",
    ", the homogeneity of background allows to get still further in the analytical transformation of the general equations .",
    "let us consider the semiinfinite electron gas assuming that the ion charge forms a homogeneous positive background of density @xmath72 given by @xmath73 in this model , the effective potential in the schrdinger equation ( [ schred^i - cycle ] ) depends solely on the coordinate @xmath74 .",
    "such system can represent , for example , a metal surface with self - consistent barrier or a semiconductor structure bounded by a potential barrier .",
    "the expression for induced charge in the form ( [ n_ind - def ] ) is asymptotically correct ( with respect to quasiclassicality parameter , which is always small in the systems in question at @xmath75 ) in describing the self - consistent reaction of electrons to the change in the long - wave part of coulomb potential , which is what is necessary to eliminate the infinite range of direct coulomb interaction of electrons .",

    "the critical point @xmath88 is defined as the point where inequality([stability cond ] ) reverses its sign , that is , the derivative @xmath101 turns positive . as long as with reversing sign the derivative of multivalued implicit function @xmath102 passes through infinity",

    "all the above considered , the inequality that determines the validity range of quasiclassical expression ( [ n_ind - def ] ) is conveniently written as @xmath113 the derivative of the exchange potential ( [ u_x - def ] ) is expressed here in our dimensionless variables .",
    "on the basis of ( [ x - inequality ] ) one can obtain the equation for critical values @xmath114 of total density @xmath115 , which correspond to changing in sign of the derivative @xmath116 , @xmath117 its solutions should satisfy the condition of non - negative total density , @xmath118 , and induced density , @xmath119 , by virtue of their definition by formulae ( [ n(r)-def ] ) and ( [ n_ind - def ] ) .",
    "the value of the quantum correction @xmath108 can be of any sign , because it is defined by formula ( [ n_ind - intro ] ) as a difference of two expressions for electron density found from the exact and approximate solutions of the schrdinger equation .",

    "the critical density is even higher .",
    "taking into account the correlation potential also increases the estimate for @xmath123 , adding a positive term to the left - hand side of inequality ( [ x - inequality ] ) . in the case of a homogeneous gas with correlation energy as ( [ e_c - def ] ) , this shifts the critical value towards @xmath107 .",
    "while negative values of @xmath108 do not change qualitatively the dependence of induced density @xmath128 on the average coulomb potential @xmath100 compared to the homogeneous case , leaving only one value of critical density , there is quite another picture at @xmath129 .",
    "both roots given by formula ( [ nc - roots ] ) have physical meaning and ensure positivity of both total density @xmath123 , which is evident , and the induced one @xmath130 , which can be easily checked .",
    "it can also be seen that there is the limitation @xmath131 on the value of quantum correction to provide the existence of the roots .",
    "if @xmath108 exceeds this limit , the coulomb potential @xmath100 becomes a steadily decreasing function of @xmath128 in the total range of physically acceptable values , and the applicability condition ( [ stability cond ] ) for the induced density formula ( [ n_ind - def ] ) holds at any values of @xmath100 and @xmath132 .",
    "it should be emphasized that the conditions for @xmath123 caused by inequality ( [ x - inequality ] ) do not coincide with the condition of non - negativity of the radicand in formula ( [ n_ind - def ] ) , coming into action earlier .",
    "it is due to this circumstance caused by negativity of @xmath133 and its dependence on @xmath132 that formula ( [ n_ind - def ] ) breaks down earlier with growing potential @xmath100 , than @xmath89 turns to zero .",
    "so at the increasing @xmath100 or decreasing @xmath132 , the induced charge drops to zero by a jump from some finite value in the course of iterations , creating discontinuities of the first kind in the distribution of total electron density and the effective potential , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1-n(z)-jump ] . after the self - consistency",
    "is achieved , this discontinuity naturally turns out to be less than accuracy specified , i. e. the loop termination criterion ( [ nevyazka_n - gen ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , the treatment of this discontinuity when solving the schrdinger and poisson equations turned out an essential factor touching upon the effectiveness of the whole algorithm , what will be discussed further .",
    "the estimate of the value of discontinuities in the density and effective potential can be made accurately , neglecting @xmath108 .",
    "it follows from the results of such analysis that the value of density discontinuity equals @xmath134 , taking on the value @xmath135 at the initial cycle of iterations .",
    "one can see that with a growing non - ideality of electron gas and @xmath43 closing to @xmath136 the dimensionless density jump tends to unity and becomes a more and more strong perturbation .",
    "the discontinuity of effective potential equals @xmath137 $ ] , because the coulomb potential is continuous everywhere . in the atomic units ,",
    "this discontinuity has an universal value dependent only on the expression chosen for correlation energy and ranges from @xmath138 with just the exchange potential taken into account to @xmath139 with the correlation potential added according to the standard wigner formula @xcite . in the dimensionless units , however , the discontinuity of effective potential also grows considerably with the increase of electron non - ideality due to decreasing @xmath140 .",

    "independently of @xcite , the idea of depletion region near the barrier was also suggested in @xcite , where the energy of localized states and the depth of self - induced potential well were calculated as functions of @xmath191 .",

    "the total dimensionless electron density @xmath203 at @xmath204 obtained after solving the schrdinger equation on the @xmath53-th iteration was calculated by formula @xmath205 where @xmath206 , @xmath207 is the number of a discrete level , @xmath208 are discrete energy levels , @xmath163 and @xmath209 are the respective wave functions of continuous and discrete parts of the spectrum . the first term in([n_loc_plus_continue ] ) corresponds to the density of continuous - spectrum electrons , and the second one is the electron density in the localized states .",
    "since the considered problem with an infinitely high barrier is close to that of potential scattering of @xmath210-wave by a short - range potential , one could search for energy levels in the potential well by means of the levinson s theorem ( see , for example , @xcite ) that expresses the number @xmath15 of levels in a well in terms of the asymptotic phase of continuous - spectrum wave functions at infinity by relation @xmath211 .",

    "however , when finding the energy and the wave function of a bound state we applied the trigonometric sweep method , which eliminates the well - known numerical instability of solution decreasing in the classically forbidden region , caused by the second solution that grows exponentially @xcite . in this method , the wave function is written as @xmath214 so one can easily show that the total phase @xmath215 introduced here has the increment @xmath216 at zeros of the function @xmath217 where the logarithmic derivative of the latter turns to infinity .",

    "the oscillating component of electron density is maximal at the same points as the coulomb potential .",
    "the exchange - correlation contribution into @xmath231 always has a sign opposite to that of the direct interaction . so in virtue of the repulsive nature of electron - electron interaction",

    "the similar considerations show that at the minima of the effective potential the coulomb contribution and the exchange - correlation one also summarize in phase opposition .",

    "the reason for this is discussed in more detail in section [ sec - schottky ] .    in conclusion",
    ", one should note that the system considered with filled states of discrete and continuous spectrum has much in common with quasi two - dimensional electron gas of accumulation layers close to semiconductor - insulator boundary with an external electric field applied or even without it . though one believes @xcite that the problem of self - consistent spectrum calculation for size - quantized subbands in the enriched layer is solved in @xcite",

    "it was shown by mead @xcite that the measured inverse capacitance of the metal - insulator - metal junction as a function of insulation layer thickness @xmath233 does not tend to zero at @xmath234 in contrast to the common formula for geometrical capacitance of a plate capacitor .",

    "<S> the density functional approach in the kohn - sham approximation is widely used to study properties of many - electron systems . </S>",
    "<S> due to the nonlinearity of the kohn - sham equations , the general self - consistence searching method involves iterations with alternate solving of the poisson and schrdinger equations . </S>",
    "<S> one of problems of such an approach is that the charge distribution renewed by means of the schrdinger equation solution does not conform to boundary conditions of poisson equation for coulomb potential . the resulting instability or even divergence of iterations manifests itself most appreciably in the case of infinitely extended systems . </S>",
    "<S> the published attempts to deal with this problem are reduced in fact to abandoning the original iterative method and replacing it with some approximate calculation scheme , which is usually semi - empirical and does not permit to evaluate the extent of deviation from the exact solution . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we realize the iterative scheme of solving the kohn - sham equations for extended systems with inhomogeneous electron gas , which is based on eliminating the long - range character of coulomb interaction as the cause of tight coupling between charge distribution and boundary conditions . the suggested algorithm is employed to calculate energy spectrum , self - consistent potential , and electrostatic capacitance of the semi - infinite degenerate electron gas bounded by infinitely high barrier , as well as the work function and surface energy of simple metals in the model with homogeneous distribution of positive background . </S>",
    "<S> the difference between self - consistent hartree solutions and those taking into account the exchange - correlation interaction is analyzed . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison with results previously published in the literature is carried out . </S>",
    "<S> the case study of the metal - semiconductor tunnel contact shows this method being applied to an infinitely extended system where the steady - state current can flow .    </S>",
