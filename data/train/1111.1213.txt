    "whenever the ground state of a given physical system does not exhibit a symmetry that is present in the fundamental equations of that system , it is said that this symmetry has _ spontaneously been broken . _ + _ the spontaneous breakdown of a symmetry _ was first noticed in solid state physics and related fields , where it has played an important role in our understanding of phenomena such as superconductivity and ferromagnetism . for an introduction to symmetry breakdown in that context , one may consult @xcite and @xcite .",
    "+ in 1960 y. nambu @xcite offered the conjecture that some of the approximate symmetries observed in relativistic particle physics could be explained as spontaneously broken exact symmetries.the term _ spontaneous breakdown of a symmetry _ was introduced the following year by m. baker and s. l. glashow @xcite ( see also @xcite . ) + an apparently unsurmountable objection to nambu s conjecture was quickly raised by j. goldstone , a. salam and s. weinberg @xcite .",
    "this objection , the goldstone theorem , states that in every physically acceptable ( i. e. covariant ) theory , the spontaneous breaking of a symmetry brings with it the presence of unwanted massless particles ( the so called goldstone ghosts , or goldstone bosons . )",
    "+ this in turn lead to the proposition , by p. w. anderson @xcite , that the coupling of the system with a long - range field ( such as the electromagnetic one ) could remove the goldstone ghosts from the theory .",
    "+ finally , in 1964 p. w. higgs @xcite proposed his celebrated mechanism , by means of which the goldstone bosons are eliminated by coupling the currents associated with the broken symmetry with a gauge field . from then on , the search for traces of the higgs mechanism has become one of the main obsessions of experimental and theoretical physicist , as is known by every newspaper reader .",
    "+ of course , there are many fine points we have left out of this very brief historical account .",
    "but at least one thing should come out clear : that _ spontaneous symmetry breakdown _ plays a central role in contemporary high energy physics , so that it is natural , for anyone studying this field for the first time , to be quickly introduced to this phenomenon , and for introductory textbooks , such as @xcite or @xcite , to contain simplified models exhibiting _ spontaneous broken symmetries _ as a first approximation to the subject .",
    "+ indeed , @xcite contains an expositions that starts with a classical model of symmetry breakdown : a point - like classical particle moving on the line , under the sole influence of a potential @xmath0 ( with @xmath1 and @xmath2 positive constants ) an example of the so called _ sombrero _ type potentials .",
    "there are two different positions of stable equilibrium ( and thus , two different _ ground states _ ) for the particle in this model , as can be deduced from taking a glance at figure 1 .",
    "+ in this example , the potential posses a global spatial - inversion , or @xmath3-symmetry , i.e. the symmetry associated with the eveness of the potential about the axis @xmath4 @xmath5 as the equilibrium positions ( each taken separatedly ) do not posses this symmetry , so it is said that the @xmath3-symmetry is violated by the ( twice - fold degenerate ) ground level of potential ( [ mexican.peasant.hat ] ) .",
    "+    [ msbs1 ]     ( arbitrary units , ) an example of a _ sombrero _ type potential , with characteristic double minima and reflection symmetry . ]    thus , spontaneous symmetry breakdown can be illustrated with a simple model in the realm of classical mechanics .",
    "other , more realistic but less simple , realizations of spontaneous symmetry breakdown in classical systems have been discussed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "+ it is then natural to ask , first : if ( non - relativistic ) quantum - mechanical models can be constructed , that reflect the main features of spontaneous symmetry breakdown , as they appear in quantum field theories . and , in second term : if this purported non - relativistic quantum models offer any substantial pedagogical advantage over the classical one .",
    "+ most of this communication is addressed to answering this two questions .",
    "we have discovered a previous answer in the well known textbook by merzbacher @xcite , which we find to be not completely satisfactory , for reasons that shall be exposed in section 4 . + this communication has been written with senior university students , and graduate students , in mind .",
    "we think it may also be useful for faculty members , and general physicists , interested in obtaining a better grasp of the concept _ spontaneous breakdown of a symmetry . _",
    "the only requisites for understanding the present communication are a fair level of understanding of classical and non - relativistic quantum mechanics ( especially one - dimensional systems ) not above the level of the first chapters of a textbook such as @xcite .",
    "+    [ msbs2_2.1 ]    , which crosses the origin , @xmath6 .",
    "all trajectories outside the separatrix are symmetric , whereas none of the trajectories inside the separatrix are symmetric . ]",
    "consider the classical model sketched in the previous section , along with its associated hamiltonian : @xmath7 following hamilton s formalism , it is not difficult to find that the system obeys equations @xmath8 and has a phase - space portrait as shown in figure 2 .",
    "one may very well get the impression , by looking at this phase - space diagram , that the breakdown of symmetry _ happens _",
    "( so to speak ) at separatrix energy @xmath9 : above this energy all the phase - space trajectories are symmetric with respect to the @xmath4 axis , while below none of them are .",
    "this facts make it cogent that this symmetry breakdown is not necessarily associated with the global @xmath3-symmetry of potential @xmath10 , but is rather a _",
    "phenomenon , that has to do with the properties of @xmath11 in a neighborhood around a local maximum @xmath12 .",
    "+ indeed , a potential such as the one shown in figure 3 has , as sombrero - type potentials do , two different positions of stable equilibrium , but in contrast , it has no global spatial - inversion symmetry to be broken .",
    "thus , the very least that can be said is that the degeneracy of the ground state in such classical systems is not necessarily associated with the breakdown of a global @xmath3-symmetry .",
    "+    [ msbs3_2.2 ]     has no reflection symmetry , yet exhibits a twice - fold degenerate",
    "_ ground level _ ( two different points of stable equilibrium . ) ]    we ascertain that , on the other hand , there is a breakdown of _ local _ spatial - inversion symmetry in the phase - space trajectories around the point @xmath13 whenever @xmath14 is a maximum , for a wide family of analytical potentials .",
    "+ indeed , let us consider an arbitrary potential @xmath10 , analytical on @xmath15 .",
    "recalling elementary calculus , it is not difficult to see that a sufficient condition for @xmath10 to have a local maximum at a point @xmath14 is that :    * taylor s expansion around @xmath14 takes the form @xmath16 where @xmath17 stands for terms of order equal or higher than @xmath18 , and * @xmath19    thus , @xmath14 is a local maximum of @xmath10 if the behaviour of the system can be approximated by the equation of motion @xmath20 near the point @xmath21 , with @xmath22 the mass of the particle .",
    "the repulsive force term in ( [ repulsiff.f ] ) is derived from the potential @xmath23 which is in all cases _ even _ about @xmath14 .",
    "+ at this moment , we can at least ascertain the following : if an analytical potential has a maximum @xmath14 complying with conditions ( 1 ) and ( 2 , ) then there exist a potential ( [ 2.pot ] ) even about @xmath24 that is associated with the approximate equation of motion ( [ repulsiff.f ] . )",
    "+ but we can do a little bit better : we can show that in every case when an analytical potential has a maximum as the one described , the approximate equation of motion predicts the existence of two different trajectories for each energy value below the local maximum .",
    "+ in order to see this more clearly , let us introduce a new variable : @xmath25 in terms of which we have a potential @xmath26 a lagrangian @xmath27 a momentum @xmath28 and a hamiltonian @xmath29 that give us the equation of motion ( [ repulsiff.f ] ) which models the behaviour of the particle in sufficiently small regions around the point @xmath30 . as @xmath31 has no explicit time dependency , @xmath32 is a constant of motion in each trajectory , and the points of return of a given trajectory must respond to the condition @xmath33 thus , for energies below @xmath34 there are always two different points of return : @xmath35 one at the left , and one at the right , of the local maximum @xmath36 this two points belong necessarily to two different , disconnected , trajectories .",
    "+ in so many words we have shown that : for every local maximum , @xmath14 , of an analytical potential , complying with the previously stated conditions , the @xmath3-symmetry of the approximate equation of motion ( [ repulsiff.f ] , ) that governs the local behaviour of the particle near the point @xmath37 , is broken for energies below this local maximum .",
    "+ observe that the symmetry breakdown is better understood , in this case , by considering the phase - space of the system .",
    "it is probably fair to say that this illustrates , in the classical realm , nambu s _ dictum : _",
    "`` ... it is always a dynamical question whether a symmetry breaks or not ... ''@xcite +",
    "[ msbs4_3 ]    , ) shown in black , along with its ground state , shown in gray . ]",
    "consider a function @xmath38 given by @xmath39 for some @xmath40 .",
    "+ this function is clearly normalizable , as @xmath41 the operator @xmath42 annihilates @xmath43 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath44 so that the explicitly self - adjoint operator @xmath45 also annihilates @xmath43 .",
    "+ the action of @xmath46 on any given function , @xmath47 , is easily calculated : @xmath48 thus , for any value , @xmath49 we can construct a hamiltonian , @xmath50 , of the typical schroedinger form : @xmath51 with potential @xmath10 is given by @xmath52 as @xmath43 is also node - less , we know @xmath43 to be proportional to the ground state eigenfunction of @xmath50 .",
    "thus , the ground level energy is zero : @xmath53 potential ( [ pottyhat ] ) is of the _ sombrero _ type , as is shown in figure 4 .",
    "+ in stark contrast with the behaviour of classical systems , the energy eigenvalue of the ground - state ( _ the most stable stationary state ! _ ) of ( [ herohat ] ) corresponds to the energy level of the separatrix curve of the analogous classical system .",
    "moreover , the probability density of @xmath54 has its peak , and is centered , in what would be the position of unstable equilibrium in the classical counterpart of potential ( [ pottyhat ] ) .",
    "+ yet , the most important point of this example is that there are no stationary states below the even state @xmath43 .",
    "there is simply no breakdown of symmetry in this case .",
    "this is not casual .",
    "+ indeed , for an analytical potential @xmath55 with reflection symmetry @xmath56 stationary states are either even or odd with respect to @xmath4 , i.e. for a stationary state @xmath57 of @xmath58 one can either have @xmath59 or @xmath60 so that probability density @xmath61 is in all cases even with respect to @xmath4 .",
    "in non - relativistic one - dimensional quantum mechanics there are no analytical potentials , _ sombrero _ type or otherwise , that can exhibit spontaneous @xmath3-symmetry breakdown .",
    "[ cochise ]    . adapted from @xcite . ]    in the well known textbook by e. merzbacher @xcite one can find a model that is claimed to exemplify the spontaneous breaking of symmetry .",
    "it starts with a family of double oscillator potentials ( see figure 5 ) @xmath62 and then it is asserted that , as the limit @xmath63 is approached   two degenerate ground state wave functions are concentrated in the separate wells and do not have definite parity .",
    "thus , the reflection symmetry  is said to be hidden or broken spontaneously  \" no proof is provided for this statement .",
    "+ one problem with this model is that there is no potential @xmath64 that could be represented in graphical form .",
    "indeed , it is not difficult to prove that @xmath65 it would then seem that in order to accomplish symmetry breaking one would have to have two minima separated by an infinitely wide potential barrier of infinite height . + we believe a more graspable example starts with piece - wise - constant potentials of the type @xmath66 ( see figure 6 ) so that , in the limit as @xmath67 , one gets two separated , infinitely deep , wells ( see figure 7 ) : @xmath68 the advantage being that the solutions of the associated schroedinger equations can now be worked thoroughly .",
    "+ each @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) has a completely discrete spectrum , classified according to parity , with an infinite number of levels above @xmath71 .",
    "levels start appearing below the barrier after some threshold value @xmath72 is reached in the parameter . + let us focus in the discretization condition below barrier @xmath71 .",
    "for even states it reads @xmath73    [ betty ]     of equation ( [ ucases ] ) . ]",
    "while odd levels below the barrier level have to comply with @xmath74 in the limit @xmath75 both of this expressions diverge to @xmath76 which only makes sense if @xmath77 which , in turn , is the usual discretization condition for a single infinitely deep well of width @xmath78 .",
    "+ thus , for the limit potential @xmath79 even and odd levels merge , so that the each level is twice - fold degenerate . + a pair of perfectly acceptable  concentrated \" eigensolutions , @xmath80 and @xmath81 , of the stationary schroedinger equation : @xmath82 are given by @xmath83    [ sussy ]     of equation ( [ uinfty ] ) . ]    and @xmath84 if the system is in a @xmath80 state , one has absolute certainty that the particle is found at the well standing at the left , and an analogous assertion can be made about the @xmath81 states and the well at the right .",
    "but an equally acceptable pair , spanning the same eigenspace , is @xmath85 the elements of which are not `` concentrated '' in the sense given above .",
    "+ thus , it is not true that symmetry breaking _ necessarily _ begets , in this case , `` concentrated '' states .",
    "rather , the breaking of symmetry brings with it a degeneracy that _ allows one to prepare the system in such `` concentrated '' states , among other possible stationary states , including definite - parity ones . _ + moreover , the separation between the wells has nothing to do with the breaking of symmetry . in our model",
    ", this separation is arbitrary .",
    "changing the distance between the wells , or even taking it to infinity , will not change the behavior of the solutions .",
    "+ this last model is still not completely satisfactory : when symmetry breaking is achieved , at the limit potential , all levels become degenerate , in contrast with the classical model .",
    "+ adding to the strangeness of this last example , the expectation value for the position is , for any of the definite - parity eigenstates @xmath86 : @xmath87 which is at the middle of what could be called ( tongue in cheek ) a _ very _ classically prohibited region .",
    "+ let us close this section with yet another quote by y. nambu : `` a symmetry implies degeneracy .",
    "in general there are multiplets ...",
    "(that ) can be distinguished only relative to a weakly coupled external environment which breaks the symmetry . ''",
    "consider a pair of energy displaced harmonic oscillators : @xmath88 and take inconmensurable fundamental frequencies , _",
    "i.e. _ take frequencies @xmath89 such that the quotient @xmath90 is irrational : @xmath91 the matrix arrangement @xmath92 which acts on spinors , arrangements of the form @xmath93 has eigenvalues and eigenspinors given by the equations @xmath94 where @xmath95 the @xmath86 ( @xmath96 ) standing for the well known eigenfunctions of hamiltonian @xmath97 + the so called pauli matrix @xmath98 which is self - adjoint and unitary , i.e. @xmath99 ( @xmath100 standing for the @xmath101 identity matrix ) is an internal symmetry of the system : @xmath102=0\\ ] ] and eigenspinors are classified according with this symmetry : @xmath103 condition ( [ irrational ] ) guarantees that all the excited levels in the spectrum of @xmath104 are not degenerate , yet the ground state level is : @xmath105 thus , in this model symmetry is broken only at ground state level . + it is interesting to note that @xmath106 , along with the identity matrix , furnishes a representation of the group of second order , just as @xmath3 and the identity operator do : @xmath107 this example may be given a little more _ physical _ ( in contrast with purely mathematical ) appearance , by writing @xmath104 in the form @xmath108 where @xmath109 is just an energy displaced harmonic oscillator @xmath110 and @xmath111 is a _ position - dependent spinorial interaction _",
    ", with position - dependence given by : @xmath112 in order to do this , one just needs to define : @xmath113 finally , a word of caution is probably in order , more for the seasoned reader than for the beginner : although the toy model discussed in this section may remind of ( and is partially inspired in ) the quantum - mechanical super - symmetric models presented by witten in @xcite , our system is clearly _ not _ super - symmetric .",
    "the telling difference being that its energy levels are not degenerate above ground - state level , while the excited levels of quantum - mechanical super - symmetric models are _ always _ degenerate , not withstanding if super - symmetry is broken or not .",
