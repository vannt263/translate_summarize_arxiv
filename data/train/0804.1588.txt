    "gravity , the earliest and the weakest of the known forces , has never been very settled .",
    "the beauty of co - variant symmetry motivated einstein to supersede the newton s paradigm with general relativity , but ( inadequate ) empirical evidences motivated einstein to introduce first and then withdraw the cosmological constant , a concept defying quantum physics understanding even in modern day .",
    "while making generally tiny or a factor of two corrections , the equivalence principles insist on certain symmetries in space - time , _",
    "e.g. _ , co - variant symmetry and no frame to measure locally any absolute direction of gravitational acceleration for a free - falling observer .",
    "however , symmetry can be spontaneously broken if there are dynamical interactions or couplings of fields ; a well - known mechanism in several branches of physics , especially the higgs - mechanism in particle physics to give a mass to a particle .",
    "many attempts have been made to break the strong equivalence principle by adding new fields ( degrees of freedom ) in the gravity sector , which essentially means the gravitational `` constant '' @xmath2 may be is a new dynamical degree of freedom governed by other fields coupled to the metric .",
    "the best known is the brans - dicke theory ( 1961 ) .",
    "the lesser known is that a vector field of non - zero absolute value in vacuum can also be coupled to gravity , to give absolute directions ( will 1993 ) .",
    "it has long been suggested that lorentz symmetry can be broken locally in the quantum gravity and string theory context ( kostelecky & samuel 1989 ) to yield a vector field of a non - zero expectation value ( _ e.g. _ , pointing towards the direction of time ) in the vacuum .",
    "the most successful attempt so far is the einstein - aether theory of jacobson et al .",
    "a common theme of these theories is that they are _ not _ invented for certain observational anomaly .",
    "rather in the same vein as how symmetry motivated general relativity , these theories meet the astronomical data only a posteri , e.g. , li , mota , barrow ( 2007 ) showed a vector field in the gravity sector could not be excluded by the accurate cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) data .",
    "nevertheless , the above order is not the only way to discover theories .",
    "the puzzling black body radiation spectrum and balmer s curious empirical formula for hydrogen lines are among the odd pieces of classical physics , which lead to full formulation of quantum mechanics .",
    "this bottom - up approach is often gradual , the arrival of the final theory taking several generations of formulations ( _ e.g. _ , from planck s model for blackbody radiation and bohr s model for hydrogen atom to heisenberg s matrices - based formulation in general ) with different levels of mathematical rigour and sophistication .",
    "historically , milgrom s modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ) was invented without any packaging by co - variant theories of gravity , just as the dark matter empirical concept was invented by zwicky without packaging first with supersymmetry - like particle field theories .",
    "mond is a formula motivated to reveal the curious uniform rules ( or facts ) underlying rotation curves of many spiral galaxies , as balmer s formula and its generalisations suggesting strongly a fundamental rule for all atomic lines .",
    "since the rule is empirical and bare ( without co - variance ) , it waits to be enshrouded by a theory preserving basic symmetries to predict any logical corrections to situations where the empirical rule must fail slightly , _",
    "e.g. _ , by factor of two in some gravitationally lenses made by elliptical galaxies and clusters of galaxies .",
    "the tensor - vector - scalar ( teves ) framework of bekenstein ( 2004 ) , unifying earlier constructions by sanders and others , makes the first step to the integration of mond formula with fundamental physics .",
    "a time - like vector field is shown to be the necessary ingredient of a mond gravity .",
    "yet the original aim of teves was limited , _",
    "e.g. _ , not addressing the cosmological constant problem , or the inflation .",
    "orthogonally many literatures considered theories of modified gravity such as the @xmath0 gravity ( chiba 2003 ) and scalar inflation theory as _ ad hoc _ fixes of the cosmological constant problem and the horizon problem respectively , without aiming to address outstanding questions on galaxy rotation curves . recently zhao ( 2007 ) ,",
    "built on the work of zlosnik et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , showed that these outstanding problems of dm and de can find at least one common solution simultaneously in the framework of a massive vector field .",
    "in these theories , there is `` one field which rules them all and in the darkness bind them . ''",
    "the most famous examples of a vector field is the massless spin-1 photon and the massive z - boson in the electro - weak theory .",
    "the standard way to give masses to particles in particle physics is the higgs mechanism where a scalar field , coupled to the vector field , acquires a non - zero value in vacuum . turning to the gravity sector",
    ", however , it is unclear how the fundamental prediction of spontaneous symmetry breaking from quantum gravity might be related to the mundane effects of galactic dark matter and cosmological constant .",
    "we lack a framework .",
    "we shall show that mond , @xmath0 gravity , einstein - ther theory and inflation can be integrated into a common framework with a unit vector and a dynamical scalar field .",
    "mond would become a specific choice of the potential of the scalar field .",
    "having such a framework allows one to explore the consequences of modified gravity systematically . it can be meaningless to even differentiate dark energy and modified gravity .",
    "modified gravity contains extra fields , which can be treated as dark energy field .",
    "the goal of this paper is to show the existence of a very general lagrangian for which the mond formulae are the natural consequences in spiral galaxies in equilibrium , rather than the golden rule for ( non)-equilibrium systems of all scales .",
    "we demonstrate this with the modified poisson equation and for the equation for the hubble expansion .",
    "the outline is as follows .",
    "we propose our general lagrangian in  2 , and illustrate how it reduces to various special cases , teves , bstv , einstein - aether , @xmath3 , @xmath0 , inflation .",
    "we choose a subset of models with mond and dark energy effects in  3 .",
    "we examplify the properties of our dark fluid in the case of hubble expansion and inflation (  4 ) , and for static galaxies (  5 ) .",
    "we discuss corrections to mond in  6 , and summarize the properties of the dark fluid in  7 .",
    "appendix gives an estimate of the damping frequency of the dark fluid .",
    "denote a vector field by @xmath4 , which has generally a variable or dynamic norm ^2 g_ab z^az^b , which is essentially an auxiliary scalar field characterizing the norm of the vector field @xmath4 , hence is not an independent dynamical freedom .",
    "a generic coupling of the vector field @xmath4 with the space - time is through the contractions among the @xmath5 tensor , the @xmath6 metric tensor , the ricci tensor @xmath7 .",
    "hence the most generic theory of the vector should contain the terms @xmath8r_{ab } + f_{34 } , \\\\",
    "f_{34 } & \\equiv &   f_3 \\varphi^2 + f_4 \\nabla^{a}\\varphi\\nabla_{a}\\varphi + \\cdots\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 could be constants or functions of @xmath10 .",
    "the term @xmath11 could always be recast through a full divergence to @xmath12 where @xmath13 are constant tensors or tensor functions .",
    "the equivalent expression for the lagrangian is @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the ricci scalar , and @xmath13 are constant tensors for simplicity but can also be lengthy functions of @xmath10 in general ; @xmath16 are constants in the simplest case but functions of @xmath10 in general .",
    "the above lagrangian is generic enough , and many dark energy models can be derived from it . for example , the terms @xmath17 can lead to an @xmath18 ( li & barrow 2007 ) gravity ( as could be checked by solving @xmath10 from the equation of motion of @xmath10 and then substituting back into the original lagrangian ) ; and the terms @xmath19 leads to the brans - dicke theory of gravity , where the auxilliary field @xmath20 .",
    "the usual inflation - like or quintessence theories can be recovered from the terms @xmath21 .",
    "the essential dynamics of a cosmological vector field is described by the first term @xmath22 ( ferreira et al .",
    "2007 , halle , zhao & li 2008 ) .",
    "if insisting that the field has a unit norm guaranteed by a lagrange multiplier , one would recover einstein - ther theory ( jacobson et al . 2001 ) and its generalizations ( zlosnik _ et al .",
    "_ 2007 , li _ et al .",
    "to see the relation to mond , consider the subset where @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 . let s decompose the four dynamical freedoms in the vector field into a unit norm part of 3 degrees of dynamical freedom , ^a , ^2 g_abz^az^b , and rewrite the scalar field @xmath10 in term of the new scalar field @xmath26 . the lagrangian is then casted to a form containing _ at least _",
    "the following @xmath27 where @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are various coupling constants or functions of @xmath33 , and @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 is the ricci scalar , and @xmath38 is the lagrange multiplier ( a kind of potential ) .",
    "the lagrangians @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 are for the matter , the scalar field @xmath10 and the unit vector field @xmath42 respectively , where we omitted two possible terms @xmath43 in @xmath41 .",
    "@xmath44 is the only dimensional scale in the dark fluid , it is a scale of energy density .    in this lagrangian",
    "we have three dynamical fields : the scalar field @xmath26 , the ther field @xmath45 and the metric field @xmath46 plus a non - dynamical @xmath38 .",
    "now varying the action @xmath47 with respect to them will lead to the scalar field equation of motion ( eom ) , ther field eom and the modified energy - momentum tensor plus the unit vector constraints for @xmath48 field respectively .",
    "the general results are more tedious and are presented elsewhere ( halle , zhao , li 2008 ) . here",
    "we illustrate the physics by considering only the main terms for a specific choice of functions .",
    "the dimensionless function @xmath49 has the meaning of the potential of the scalar field @xmath33 , and @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are of order unity , and are also generally functions of @xmath26 and will be shown to be related the sound speeds of the dark fluid .    *",
    "we set the scalar field sound speed c_&~ & 1 , and we shall treat @xmath28 and @xmath50 as constants . * we choose the coefficients & = & ^2 + c_2 ( ) 2 & & b ( ) -1 3 = -1 3 , i.e. @xmath51 . for simplicity we set two other terms in @xmath41 of jacobson s unit vector field to zero , i.e. , @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "this might not be necessary , but simplifies the analysis of ppn parameters in the solar system and the sound speed of the vector field .",
    "our choice of lagrangian with @xmath54 kills spin-1 mode waves of the vector field , and gurantees that the normal gravitational wave in the tensor mode will propagate with the normal speed ( of light ) .",
    "this choice is perhaps not necessary , but is intended to avoid contraversy on the causuality issue .",
    "even the spin-0 mode sound speed @xmath55 is plausible : a rigourous analysis ( foster & jacobson 2006 , valid for any constant @xmath26 and @xmath56 ) predicts c_^2 = c_2 c_4(2-c_1 ) ( 2 + 3 c_2 ) = ( 1-b ) ( -1)3 b = 1 3 ^ 2 > 0 .",
    "interestingly in the solar system , where @xmath57 , the spin-0 mode of the vector field propagates almost instantaneously with @xmath55 being @xmath58 times bigger than the speed of light , avoiding the cherenkov radiations constraint in the solar system .",
    "all ppn parameters are expect to be equal to that of gr in the solar system as well ; although the ppn parameters @xmath59 , @xmath60 are non - zero , as shown later the scalar field @xmath26 is expected to settle to a very small equilibrium value @xmath61 on earth for our choice of the penalizing scalar field potential @xmath49 . *",
    "our choice for the dark fluid potential ( shown in fig.1 ) is _ 0 f()|_=^2 & = & 8 ( -1)^3 3_0 .",
    "the dark fluid s energy scale is defined by @xmath44 .",

    "consider background cosmology in the frw flat metric , @xmath66 firstly , the scalar field follows an equation of motion exactly as a quintessence , @xmath67 so @xmath10 , the norm of the vector field @xmath4 , tracks the hubble rate @xmath68 .",
    "the vector field equation of motion gives the lagrange multiplier ( or the mass of the vector field ) @xmath69 , where @xmath70 .",

    "there is no dark matter - like effect at very high redshift , e.g. , radiation era or bbn , where @xmath75 , hence @xmath76 .",

    "<S> empirical theories of dark matter like mond gravity and of dark energy like f(r ) gravity were motivated by astronomical data . </S>",
    "<S> but could these theories be branches rooted from a more general hence natural framework ? </S>",
    "<S> here we propose the natural lagrangian of such a framework based on simple dimensional analysis and co - variant symmetry requirements , and explore various outcomes in a top - down fashion . </S>",
    "<S> our framework preserves the co - variant formulation of gr , but allows the expanding physical metric be bent by a single new species of dark fluid flowing in space - time . </S>",
    "<S> its non - uniform stress tensor and current vector are simply functions of a vector field of variable norm , resembling the 4-vector electromagnetic potential description for the photon fluid , but is dark ( e.g. , by very early decoupling from the baryon - radiation fluid ) . </S>",
    "<S> the dark fluid framework naturally branches into a continuous spectrum of theories with dark energy and dark matter effects , including the @xmath0 gravity , teves - like theories , einstein - aether and @xmath1 theories as limiting cases . </S>",
    "<S> when the vector field degenerates into a pure higgs - like scalar field , we obtain the physics for inflaton and quintessence . in this broad </S>",
    "<S> setting we emphasize the non - constant dynamical field behind the cosmological constant effect , and highlight plausible corrections beyond the classical mond predictions . </S>",
    "<S> choices of parameters can be made to pass bbn , ppn , and causality constraints . </S>",
    "<S> the dark fluid is inspired to unify / simplify the astronomically successful ingredients of previous constructions : the desired effects of inflaton plus quintessence plus cold dm particle fields or mond - like scalar field(s ) are shown largely achievable by one vector field only . </S>"
