    "one of the most surprising observations at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) is a particle type dependence of the nuclear modification factors @xmath2 at the intermediate transverse momentum ( 2 @xmath3 @xmath0 @xmath3 5 gev/@xmath1 )  @xcite . in au+au central collisions at @xmath4 gev ,",
    "yields for mesons are largely suppressed  @xcite with respect to the yields in proton - proton collisions at the intermediate @xmath0 , while those for baryons are not suppressed .",
    "the cronin effect  @xcite alone does not explain the observed large baryon yield in central au+au collisions  @xcite .",
    "this phenomena is called `` baryon anomaly ( or enhancement ) at rhic '' . to explain the data , many theoretical models have been proposed . among those ,",
    "a quark recombination process  @xcite is now believed to be one of the dominant hadronization processes at the intermediate @xmath0 in central au+au collisions at rhic , with the support by the experimental data of the nuclear modification factor and the elliptic flow for @xmath5 meson  @xcite .",
    "now the key questions are the onset effect of baryon enhancement and how it evolves as a function of beam energy . in order to answer these questions ,",
    "the lower energy beam data in au+au / cu+cu / p+p collisions were taken during the successive rhic runs from 2004 to 2006 by the phenix experiment . in this paper , we present the preliminary results of @xmath0 spectra for identified charged particles ( @xmath6 ) in au+au / cu+cu / p+p collisions at @xmath7 = 62.4 gev and cu+cu collisions at 22.5 gev from phenix .",
    "the centrality and beam energy dependences of @xmath8 ratio are presented .",
    "we also discuss a possible onset effect of the baryon enhancement at rhic energy .",
    "figure  [ fig : ppi_ratio_all ] shows the compilation of @xmath9 ratios as a function of @xmath0 , which includes the phenix data points in au+au / cu+cu at @xmath10 200 gev  @xcite , au+au / cu+cu / p+p at 62.4 gev , and cu+cu at 22.5 gev .",
    "the isr data in p+p at @xmath1153 gev  @xcite is also shown for the comparison , and it agrees with the newly measured @xmath12 ratio in p+p at 62.4 gev .",
    "no weak decay feeddown correction is applied for proton and antiproton yields .",
    "more details on the data analysis method can be found in  @xcite .",
    "for the central collisions ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ppi_ratio_all ] , left panel ) , the @xmath9 ratios at the intermediate @xmath0 in au+au / cu+cu at 200/62.4 gev are larger than the values in p+p , except for the central cu+cu collisions at 22.5 gev , which is consistent with the p+p values . for the peripheral collisions ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ppi_ratio_all ] , right panel ) , all of the ratios are converging on the ratios in p+p collisions .",
    "figure  [ fig : ppi_beam_dep_pos ] and figure  [ fig : ppi_beam_dep_neg ] show the @xmath7 dependence of @xmath13 and @xmath9 ratios respectively , from sps @xmath10 17.3 gev  @xcite to the top rhic energy 200 gev in au+au / cu+cu for the central collisions at the intermediate @xmath0 ( 2.0 - 2.2 gev/@xmath1 ) .",
    "the data points for p+p are also shown in these plots .",
    "in general , @xmath13 ( @xmath9 ) ratio decreases ( increases ) as a function of @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "the larger @xmath13 ratios for the lower beam energies can be understood by the influence of the incoming nucleons from the beams ( a baryon transport at the midrapidity ) . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath9 ratio can be used as a measure for the baryon enhancement , because antiprotons are `` produced particles '' . as shown in figure  [ fig : ppi_beam_dep_neg ] , the @xmath9 ratio in cu+cu",
    "22.5 gev is consistent with both p+p measurements and the sps pb+pb central collision data .",
    "it suggests there is no baryon enhancement at 22.5 gev in cu+cu collisions .",
    "an onset effect of baryon enhancement could be seen in between @xmath14 22.5 to 62.4 gev .",
    "to conclude , the high statistics data with the heavier collisions system like au+au at around 22.5 gev is necessary in the future rhic run , as well as the more extensive beam energy scan in the rhic - ii program .",
    "in summary , we have measured @xmath13 and @xmath9 ratios in au+au , cu+cu , and p+p collisions at @xmath10 62.4 gev , and cu+cu at 22.5 gev . in the central cu+cu collisions at 22.5 gev ,",
    "@xmath9 ratio at the intermediate @xmath0 is consistent with the values in both p+p collisions and pb+pb central collision , and it suggests that there is no strong baryon enhancement at 22.5 gev cu+cu collisions and the onset of baryon enhancement might exist in between @xmath10 22.5 to 62.4 gev . these @xmath13 and @xmath9 ratios may give a further constraint to the hadronization process in the recombination models at the beam energies from sps to rhic .",
