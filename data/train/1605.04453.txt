    "and non - perturbatively by the bielefeld group @xcite . in a series of works",
    "@xcite we have pointed out that , instead of pqcd features , unexpected inverse power corrections in temperature dominate above the phase transition , a non - perturbative feature which finds a natural explanation in terms of dimension-2 condensates of the dimensionally reduced theory . on the other extreme",
    "we have also found a hadronic representation in the confined phase both for the polyakov loop @xcite and its correlators  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) . for a pedagogical review",
    "see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "perturbative calculations of the renormalized polyakov loop have been pursued to nnlo  @xcite .",
    "the mysterious power corrections have been confirmed on the lattice for @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "quite recently , the tum lattice calculation for physical quark masses in 2 + 1 flavours has been carried out in the temperature range @xmath1  @xcite concluding that at earliest pqcd to nnlo  @xcite might set in at @xmath2 . here",
    "we display the power correction pattern over a huge range of temperatures and argue on the missing singly heavy hadronic states below the phase transition .",
    "the polyakov loop is a local operator which in the static gauge reads @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "its expectation value is a ratio of two partition functions ( we take conventionally @xmath5 ) @xmath6 where the qcd lagrangian for @xmath7 flavours @xmath8 reads , in terms of the re - scaled gluon field @xmath9 with @xmath10 , @xmath11 the renormalized polyakov loop is uniquely defined up to a constant factor which corresponds to @xmath12 .",
    "there is no natural way to fix the ambiguity , but it can be removed by using the corresponding entropy @xmath13 \\ , .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] being dimensionless , one should have @xmath14 , with @xmath15 the renormalization scale .",
    "renormalization group invariance requires @xmath16 where the beta function and the mass anomalous dimension are , @xmath17 respectively .",
    "direct evaluation yields the shift in the specific heat @xmath18   \\right\\ }   \\equiv \\frac{\\partial   \\delta u_q}{\\partial t } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the trace of the energy momentum tensor , the argument of ref .",
    "the entropy shift is not a true entropy .",
    "for instance , the true entropy must be a monotonous function of the temperature since from @xmath20 it follows @xmath21 .",
    "thus _ both _ @xmath22 and @xmath23 but the sign of @xmath24 is not fixed .",
    "the exact relations for thermodynamics of heavy quarks  @xcite are still subjected to ambiguities which are removed in the specific heat . ]",
    "@xmath25 the entropy shift can be obtained by integrating with suitable boundary conditions featuring the dimensions of the hilbert space with and without polyakov loop . at low temperatures @xmath26 for @xmath27 degenerate flavours and @xmath28 , whereas at high temperatures @xmath29 , thus @xmath30 the first condition is the third principle of thermodynamics for degenerate states .",
    "the recent tum lattice calculations directly provide the entropy in the range @xmath1  @xcite taking the convention @xmath31 in harmony with their normalization @xmath32 which , unlike ours , _ is not _ a partition function at low temperatures .",
    "the critical temperature was found to be @xmath33 .",
    "in the confined phase we expect a hadronic representation of the polyakov loop @xcite .",
    "there the ambiguity comes from the heavy quark mass which is subtracted from the hadron total mass . in @xcite",
    "we explicitly reconstructed the entropy @xmath34 although the available lattice data were noisier than the recent ones  @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : entropy - models ] we show the lattice entropy results @xcite and compare them with the hadron resonance gas using either the bag model ( centered at the heavy quark source ) , the pdg or the rqm of isgur , godfrey and capstick for mesons and baryons  @xcite taking either the charm or the bottom as the putative heavy quark .",
    "we have noted in previous works that these rqm singly heavy states follow a hagedorn - like pattern with a hagedorn - polyakov temperature of about @xmath35 for @xmath36-quarks .",
    "results from a simple constituent quark model ( cqm ) are also shown @xmath37 with @xmath38 and @xmath39 and spin degeneracies @xmath40 , @xmath41 .",
    "at high temperatures the polyakov loop can be expanded in powers of @xmath42 @xcite @xmath43   .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath44 has both perturbative ( pert ) and non - perturbative ( np ) contributions , whence the entropy reads @xmath45 where @xmath46 is a slowly varying function with temperature . in fig .",
    "[ fig : entropy - inv ] we display the recent tum data @xcite as a function of @xmath47 .",
    "a clear straight line behaviour emerges over a huge range of temperatures .",
    "a fit for @xmath48 , neglecting the @xmath49 dependence in @xmath46 , gives @xmath50 with @xmath51 for @xmath52 .",
    "this gives @xmath53 which is within the expected @xmath54 .",
    "when a heavy colour source in the fundamental representation of the @xmath55 group is placed into the hadronic vacuum there arises an entropy shift as a measurable and unambiguous observable .",
    "we noted long ago that lattice data for the corresponding free energy display corrections to the perturbative result in the unequivocal form of an inverse second power of the temperature .",
    "this behaviour has been corroborated by subsequent lattice studies .",
    "the present analysis improves on previous ones thanks to the quality of the tum lattice data , and the fact that the unambiguous entropy is used for the comparison . at low temperatures the quick increase in the number of active states , @xmath56 ,",
    "suggests that there are missing states in the singly heavy hadronic spectrum . at high temperatures power corrections",
    "dominate over the perturbative contributions , in harmony with our previous findings .",
    "taken at face value , the impressive agreement calls for a deeper understanding on the nature of these power corrections above the phase transition .",
