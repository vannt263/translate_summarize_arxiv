    "technology is reaching many sports nowadays offering new ways to improve the performance of the players to obtain competitive advantage over the opponents . in sports like soccer , american football , or basketball ,",
    "the locations of the players and of the ball are measured and logs of such locations are created .",
    "this allows for analysis and visualization of the plays .",
    "for example , in soccer this translates to the trajectories the ball takes on the field , thanks to the tactics the team applies .",
    "the challenge professionals in sports are facing is to take the reverse path : given the trajectories of the ball is it possible to infer the underlying strategy / tactic of a team ?",
    "although professionals working at soccer clubs hardly ever share insights publicly , the head of match analysis of fc bayern munich recently shared his view on the next steps to come in sport analytics : `` pattern detection , repeated actions  that s what makes it a little bit more predictable and helps the team prepare '' quantitative performance analysis in sports has become mainstream in the last decade driven by the availability of sport related datasets .",
    "the limitation of the current systems that analyze sport - related logs is twofold .",
    "first , these systems focus on descriptive statistics that do not capture entirely the strategy of the players and teams . for example , in case of soccer , the average number of shots , goals , fouls , passes are derived both for the teams and the players  @xcite .",
    "the systems are able to identify and evaluate the outcome of the strategies but are reluctant to extract the key components of the strategies that lead to these metered outcomes  @xcite .",
    "second , prior art does not completely address the dynamic aspect of the games , _",
    "i.e. _ , the fact that particular sequences of events might result in advantage opportunities . moreover , during the training sessions , players are taught to apply sequences ( _ e.g. _ , of the passes ) as part of the team s strategy .",
    "the state - of - the - art systems are not able to fully process such temporal patterns , but have shown interesting results using small databases  @xcite .",
    "the proposed implementations are very computation intensive , making it difficult to process large trajectory logs .",
    "our proposal offers an advantage over these methods in terms of scalability : we are able to handle multiple leagues and seasons due to the usage of dynamic programming to identify recurring patterns ( see section  [ sec : algorithm ] for details ) .",
    "we propose a method to _ reveal the tactics of a team _ through the analysis of repeating series of events , _",
    "i.e. _ , the positions of the ball .",
    "the method is able to find fine - grained , reoccurring patterns across complete seasons , which is impossible in the traditional way .",
    "our main contributions are :    * we propose an algorithm based on dynamic time warping to identify and extract the pass strategies of soccer teams automatically .",
    "* we determine all the recurring pass sequences of a complete season of the spanish first division , including patterns spanning more than 100 meters or applied as much as five times .",
    "* we derive insights such as passing patterns ( i ) for maintaining ball possession or launching counter attacks , ( ii ) to enter the attacking third , and ( iii ) with a focus on the team s philosophy rather than the individual capabilities of the players ( section  [ sec : evaluation ] ) .    identifying recurrent pass sequences",
    "is currently done via manual analyses of the logs and of the video footage of the games by dedicated personnel of soccer teams . on the one hand , with the proposed method we can _",
    "scale _ such analysis by analyzing many more games that a human could manually process . on the other hand ,",
    "we are able to _ objectively quantify _ the obtained results ( e.g. how often a found tactic is performed , how accurate a given sequence of movements / events is from each other , _ etc . _ ) .",
    "the application of the derived insights is twofold . on the one hand , the identified passing strategies are useful in opponent scouting , _",
    "i.e. _ , in the preparation for the upcoming opponent . our methodology reveals all the intentional ( _ i.e. _ , learnt at training sessions ) passing strategies of the next opponent . by knowing the strategy of the opponent , a team can prepare to prevent these traits happening during the game . on the other hand ,",
    "the extracted patterns provide insights on the players involvement in these orchestrated movements , hence , it is a valuable addition to the evaluation of players ( _ e.g. _ , in case of player scouting ) .",
    "a team may prefer to sign such a player who is involved in patterns similar to those that are applied by the given team itself .",
    "in this section , we briefly review the methodology used to extract insights by finding repeating patterns of pass events during soccer games .",
    "the input of the system is the logs of locations on the field where passes happened . for each pass",
    "we use the information regarding the position on the field ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 locations , normalized to the range @xmath2 $ ] ) both for the reception and the emission of the ball .",
    "furthermore , we treat each team s ball possession individually , resulting in a set of two - dimensional sequences for each team for each game .",
    "an additional pre - processing step is the normalization of the passes with respect to location and time .",
    "to do so , we insert a number of virtual positions into the pass sequence such as the distance between any two positions is less than @xmath3 unit .",
    "we use a dynamic programming algorithm derived from dynamic time warping ( dtw ) ( like those proposed in @xcite ) to compare sequences of passes present in the datasets . in figure",
    "[ fig : dtw_idea ] , we present the idea behind the use of dtw techniques for the matching of time series , _",
    "i.e. _ , sequences of passes .",
    "we illustrate two sequences of passes that could correspond to two different sequences or to two segments in the same sequence .",
    "each vertex in the figure corresponds to the position of the field where a pass originates or finishes , and the straight solid line connecting them indicates the sequence order .",
    "the axes represent the @xmath4 coordinates of the field .",
    "we define two subsequences @xmath5 and @xmath6 , with limits @xmath7 and @xmath8 for which we compute their optimum distance by first aligning the vertices in both subsequences and then computing their local @xmath9 ( between any pair of vertices ) and global @xmath10 distances ( between the complete subsequences ) .",
    "we use @xmath3 and @xmath11 units as the local and global distances , respectively .",
    "the algorithm discovers the start and end locations of the subsequences @xmath5 and @xmath6 automatically .",
    "when aligning the vertices , we allow for insertions and deletions of vertices ( represented by the alignment of two or more vertices in one subsequence to the same vertex in the other subsequence ) .",
    "in addition , our implementation of the dynamic time warping allows us to skip outliers ( _ i.e. _ , vertices that due to noise or other artifacts deviate from the general trend ) so that these do not jeopardize the correct matching of the two subsequences .",
    "outliers can be originated by errors in the measuring / annotation method or by small deviations from the pre - trained strategy that a player is forced to undertake due to the opponent s reaction .",
    "in addition , our method allows the application of additional constraints that ensure the parallel behavior of both trajectories as well as their minimum length ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "the output of the algorithm is the list of the most common sequences of passes , with a minimum length and similarity between them , that a particular team performs in a given game ( or set of games ) . in our evaluations",
    ", we only consider matching sequences with more than 40 positions and at least one complete , original pass .",
    "* toy example .",
    "* we show two pass sequences of a team in figure  [ fig : extraction_example ] .",
    "the proposed scheme determines the parts of the sequences that share a common trajectory ( denoted with blue ) .",
    "the pattern may not start or terminate at an endpoint of an original pass ( denoted by triangles ) .",
    "we illustrate the pre- , and post - pattern parts of the pass sequences until reaching an endpoint of an original pass with green and red shapes , respectively .",
    "the figure also shows the resilience of our algorithm to outliers ( _ i.e. _ , the short back and forth passes in the middle of the reference sequence ) . in the remainder of the paper",
    "we denote the two instances of a pattern as reference and found sequences .",
    "this naming is just for lucidity , the algorithm itself does not apply any kind of a priori hints ( _ i.e. _ , references ) on the patterns .",
    "* dataset .",
    "* we use the proposed method to analyze one season of the spanish first division soccer league .",
    "our dataset contains information on all the passes that happened in the 2013/14 season , along with the location ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath4 coordinates ) of the start and end of the passes .",
    "additionally , the dataset includes the time when the passes happened and the identity of the involved players .",
    "the dataset involves 20 teams , 380 matches , and more than 300,000 passes .",
    "we focus on the reoccurring pass patterns of individual teams , _",
    "i.e. _ , both the reference and the found pass sequences belong to the same team .",
    "this enables us to derive the strategies of the teams they follow throughout the season .",
    "* high - level statistics . *",
    "we investigate the prevalence of designed passing sequences of individual teams , table  [ tab : highlevel ] presents the high - level statistics of the league .",
    "fc barcelona and real madrid applied the most patterns in the season ( remarkable @xmath13 and @xmath14 patterns per game ) , suggesting that these teams have a well - defined playing style .",
    "we stress that the difference along the joint part of the sequences are less then couple of meters .",
    "the results reveal conscious preparation for the games in case of mid - level teams such as bilbao , celta vigo , and vallecano . on the other hand",
    ", atletico madrid  the champion of the season  was barely using reoccurring patterns in the season .",
    "the number of passes within the patterns shows the complexity of the passing strategy of the teams",
    ". some teams , like almeria and espanyol , had only simple patterns : all of their extracted pass strategies had a single pass .",
    "we emphasize again that this does not mean that the matched pattern consist of only this pass , it also contains a fraction of passes and ball movements preluding and following the one complete pass .",
    "again , fc barcelona is the other end of the spectrum , it had the most complete passes in its patterns .",
    "the last column of the table presents the number of final third entries enabled by the patterns , which is an important performance indicator in soccer  it shows the attacking capabilities of a team .",
    "we consider those patterns that start outside of the final third ( _ i.e. _ , the x coordinate of the first matching part is less then 66 units ) and end within that area .",
    "betis and vallecano have an impressive usage rate of the patterns to enter the final third : 44.4% and 29.5% , respectively .",
    "fc barcelona also applies patterns that lead into the final third frequently ( 25.4% ) . on the contrary ,",
    "only a small fraction of real madrid s reoccurring pass sequences are designed to enter the final third ( 15.1% ) .",
    ".high - level statistics of the matching patterns : number of patterns ( pt ) , the average number of passes within ( and their std.dev . ) , and the number of final third entries using the patterns ( fte ) . [ cols=\"<,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "building on a dtw based algorithm , we are able to extract all the recurring pass sequences of whole soccer seasons automatically , which is , based on our numerous discussions with domain experts , unprecedented and innovative in the soccer industry .",
    "the identified patterns reveal novel insights on the playing style and strategy of the teams that can be used as a competitive advantage . as future work",
    ", we plan to analyze multiple , consecutive seasons to study the stability of the teams applied patterns ."
