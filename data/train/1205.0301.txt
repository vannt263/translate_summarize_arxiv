    "origins of satellites around outer giant planets such as jupiter and saturn are important for determining the history of these objects , and their existence holds clues to the origins of such planets .",
    "satellites around jupiter and saturn , in fact , are suitable targets for formation theories because their orbital parameters and compositions are well documented ( e.g. , @xcite ) compared to those of exoplanets .",
    "therefore , we have developed a formation theory that compares physical parameters .    besides satellites in the solar system , those in extrasolar systems , known as exomoons , are an additional focus of this study .",
    "exomoons have recently attracted great interest because of their habitability .",
    "the number of detected extrasolar giant planets is much larger than rocky exoplanets , with the exception of kepler candidates , and some orbit within the habitable zone ( hz ) , i.e. , an orbital region in which the stellar flux is sufficient to maintain liquid water on the surface of a planet ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "if rocky satellites orbit giant planets in the hz , they are potentially habitable . according to studies on the possibility of life - bearing moons",
    "( @xcite , @xcite ) , satellites around extrasolar giant planets in the hz might be habitable if their size is sufficient ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "an obvious exception is titan , which has a dense atmosphere even though its mass is @xmath2 .",
    "a detailed study on the detectability of habitable exomoons by @xcite determined that exomoons in the hz down to @xmath3 may be detected by transit timing effects , including transit timing variations and transit duration variations , with the expected performance of the _ kepler space telescope_. in fact , an ongoing observational project uses photometry data of _ kepler _ to detect and investigate exomoon signals @xcite .",
    "in addition , the possibility of screening the atmosphere of exomoons for habitability with transmission spectroscopy has been discussed by @xcite , who discovered that the number of transits needed to detect biomarkers on an earth - like exomoon under idealized conditions and viewing geometry is feasible using the _ james webb space telescope _ ( _ jwst _ ) for the sample of the closest m stars .",
    "thus , it is important to predict the characteristics of satellites , such as mass , composition , and orbital location , that are likely to exist around extrasolar giant planets .    regular satellites , which follow prograde and relatively close orbits up to tens of planetary radius with little orbital eccentricities and inclinations , are believed to have formed as by - products of planets formation within a circumplanetary accretion disk ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "circumplanetary disk models currently fall into two categories : ( i ) solids - enhanced minimum mass ( semm ) model ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , in which a stationary disk is assumed ; and ( ii ) gas - starved disk model ( @xcite ) , also known as a slow inflow disk , in which an actively supplied gaseous disk is considered .    in the semm model , a disk",
    "is composed of two different zones : an optically thick inner region with a peak surface density @xmath4 and an optically thin outer region extended to a fraction of the hill radius of the planet ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the transition from the inner disk to the outer disk is assumed to occur at the location between ganymede and callisto for the jovian disk . in this model ,",
    "the disk is static , that is there is no inflow from circumstellar orbits .",
    "the inner high density region with very low turbulent viscosity ( @xmath6 ) is practically inviscid .",
    "solid components of the disk are supplied by ablation and capture of planetesimal fragments passing through the disk . in the gas - starved disk model , however ,",
    "a low - mass viscously evolving disk with a peak surface density of @xmath7 is considered .",
    "this disk is continuously supplied by the ongoing inflow of gas and dust particles from the protoplanetary disk .",
    "disk conditions evolve in a quasi - steady state mode in response to the rate of gas accretion and turbulent diffusion , leading to lower disk gas densities than in the semm model . in this study",
    ", we adopt a fiducial model for gas surface density based on the gas starved disk model ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "note that if low disk viscosity or rapid gas inflow is assumed , the gas surface density can become higher than @xmath9 ( see equations  ( [ eq : surface_density ] ) and ( [ eq : fg ] ) ) .",

    "physical properties of the galilean satellites are shown in table  [ tbl : galilean_satellites ] .",
    "orbital and compositional characteristics can provide valuable constraints on formation scenarios .",
    "the orbital resonances among the satellites io , europa , and ganymede present a fascinating dynamic system .",
    "io - europa and europa - ganymede are in the 2:1 mean motion resonance , which causes their successive conjunctions to occur near the same longitude .",
    "these satellites are also in the laplace resonance , which denotes the 1:1 commensurability between the rates of motion of the io - europa and europa - ganymede conjunctions ; thus , a triple conjunction never occurs .",
    "these resonances suggest that the galilean satellites underwent orbital migration either during or after their formation . with regard to composition ,",
    "a progressive increase in satellite ice mass fraction with increasing distance from jupiter is observed .",
    "io is composed of rock , and europa , ganymede , and callisto are believed to contain approximately 8% , 45% , and 56% ice and water by mass , respectively ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , callisto s interior structure allows it to constrain its accretion timescale .",
    "data from the _ galileo spacecraft _ suggest that callisto appears to be largely undifferentiated , provided that the satellite is in hydrostatic equilibrium ( e.g. , @xcite ) . therefore",
    ", callisto must have avoided melting in its entire history .",
    "estimates of the temperature increase associated with accretional heating show that callisto could have remained unmelted during formation if its accretion was on a timescale longer than @xmath15  years @xcite .",
    "in addition , eccentricities and inclinations are considerably small , which are considered to be damped by the surrounding gas nebula and/or tidal dissipation within the satellites .",
    "formation of the galilean satellites has been investigated from several perspectives . @xcite performed _",
    "n_-body simulations of satellite accretion from satellitesimals in a starved disk that included the effects of a gas disk .",
    "because the type i decay and accretion timescales are shorter than the disk lifetime , several generations of satellite formation and migration are repeated before gas disk dissipation . as the infall of gas and solid materials wanes because of global depletion of the circumstellar disk , the circumplanetary disk",
    "is depleted through viscous spreading and/or photoevaporation .",
    "thus , the current satellites are the survivors of the final generation . @xcite also found that the total satellite mass fraction to the host planet is regulated to @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ; mass of the planet ) , which is only weakly dependent on model parameters and is consistent with jovian and saturnian systems .",
    "several authors attempt to clarify the origin of resonant states . @xcite and",
    "@xcite proposed that io captured europa into the 2:1 resonance through differential orbital expansion due to gravitational tides raised on jupiter .",
    "with continuing orbital expansion , europa eventually encountered the 2:1 mean motion commensurability with ganymede , resulting in capture into the laplace resonance .",
    "in contrast , @xcite and @xcite advocated a primordial origin of the resonant states through differential inward type i migration in the gaseous disk .",
    "since the type i migration timescale is inversely proportional to the satellite mass , the largest satellite , ganymede , underwent the most rapid drift and caught up with the inner satellites , leading to capture into the resonances .",
    "however , @xcite performed detailed _",
    "n_-body simulations , which is the first _ n_-body study of satellite accretion , and it is suggested that resonant states can not be produced in their calculations .",
    "it seems that the initial orbital configuration of @xcite can not be established during canup & ward s _ n_-body simulations , because when a ganymede - mass satellite forms in outer region , satellites that reside in inner region do not grow to the mass comparable to those of io and europa .    as shown in recent studies on formation of close - in super - earths @xcite ,",
    "migrating bodies can be trapped in mean motion resonances near the disk inner edge .",
    "@xcite introduced the concept of the disk inner cavity in their investigation of satellite formation and found that four or five satellites are generally formed by being trapped in resonances , which agrees well with the galilean satellites .",
    "@xcite adopted a semianalytical method rather than direct orbital integration and performed monte carlo simulations .",
    "although this approach provides a powerful means for overall understanding of satellite formation , it is not adequate for effectively discussing detailed features of resonant trapping , because particularly in the formation of galilean satellites , similar - sized satellites interact with each another , and multiple bodies are eventually trapped in resonances .",
    "several studies outlined the prediction of capture probability for resonances as a function of initial particle eccentricity in the adiabatic limit , where the migration timescale is much longer than the resonant libration timescale ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "recently , @xcite and @xcite studied a rapid migration case in the restricted three - body problem in the limit of low initial particle eccentricity and semianalytically obtained capture probability using a hamiltonian model .",
    "however , it is uncertain whether their formulae can be used in a case in which bodies have comparable masses and the effect of eccentricity damping is included . therefore , the _",
    "n_-body simulation is the only currently available method to accurately examine the detailed features of resonant trapping in systems in which multiple bodies with comparable masses interact with each other .",
    "thus , we conduct _",
    "n_-body simulations of satellite accretion in a gas - starved disk @xcite by adding an inner cavity to the original model , to clarify the formation scenario with the disk edge .",
    "in particular , we assess the probability of primordial formation of the resonance relationship .",
    "moreover , we attempt to reproduce additional properties of galilean satellites such as the total number and the compositional gradient .",
    "furthermore , we examine the dependence of model parameters on the properties of formed satellites .",
    "recent studies on disk - planet interactions have suggested that torque exerted on a planet from a disk can be significantly altered because of disk structure @xcite and radiative effects ( e.g. , @xcite ) , resulting in a discrepancy with the type i migration speed predicted by linear calculations @xcite . in an actively supplied disk , in which equilibrium between gas inflow and viscous diffusion is assumed",
    ", gas surface density depends on the inflow flux and gas viscosity .",
    "given such uncertainties , we discuss satellite formation under a wide range of parameters .",
    "the results of this study are instrumental for effective prediction of orbital properties of extrasolar satellite systems .    in section  [ sec : model ] of this paper , we detail our model and numerical method ; in section  [ sec : n - body ]",
    ", we present the results of _",
    "n_-body simulations ; in section  [ sec : parameters ] , we discuss the dependence of model parameters on the properties of formed satellites ; in section  [ sec : saturn ] , we briefly discuss satellite formation for the saturnian system ; and in section  [ sec : conclusion ] , we summarize our conclusions and the implications of this study .",
    "@xcite considered two different models that correspond to jovian and saturnian systems : surviving satellites around jupiter were formed in a relatively massive protosatellite disk with an inner disk cavity , and those around saturn were formed in a less massive and cooler disk without an inner disk cavity .",
    "these disk conditions are inferred from gap openings along the host planet s orbit in the circumstellar protoplanetary disk and through observations of classical t - tauri stars ( cttss ) and weak - line t - tauri stars ( wttss ) .",
    "gap openings require that both viscous and thermal conditions be satisfied @xcite .",
    "the critical masses are expressed as @xcite : @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the viscous and the thermal conditions , respectively .",
    "although these masses have some uncertainties , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are larger at saturn s orbits than at jupiter s orbit . since saturn s mass is three times less than jupiter s one , it is plausible that jupiter opened a gap to halt its growth while saturn did not and saturn s growth was terminated by global dissipation of the solar nebula @xcite . as will be discussed in section  [ sec : disk_model ] , gap openings lead to rapid depletion of protosatellite disks ; satellites formed in a relatively massive protosatellite disk could survive around jupiter , while those formed in a late - stage less massive disk could survive around saturn .",
    "@xcite observed that spin periods of young stars show bimodal distribution in peaks at about 1 week and 1 day .",
    "they suggested that the stellar magnetic field of the 1-week - period stars is coupled with the circumstellar disk and is sufficiently strong to transfer spin angular momentum to the disk and open a disk inner cavity , whereas the disks around the 1-day - period stars do not have the cavity ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "they also suggested that the 1-week and 1-day stars may correspond to cttss and wttss , respectively , enabling massive ctts disks with a cavity to evolve to less massive wtts disks without a cavity . in this evolution analogy ,",
    "protosatellite disks may have a cavity in relatively early stages that disappears as the disk evolves , although this scenario includes a large uncertainty . because the current spin rate of jupiter is much slower than its break - up spin rate ,",
    "magnetic coupling between jupiter and the circum - jovian disk is an obvious assumption .",
    "in fact , @xcite showed that the circum - jovian disk may have contained an inner cavity .",
    "the satellites formed in such a disk survived in case of jupiter .",
    "the circum - saturnian disk may once have contained a similar disk in early stages . however , if the disk evolved to a less massive disk without a cavity , the satellites formed in the massive disk would have fallen onto saturn , and the surviving satellites would have formed in the late - stage disk .",
    "we comment on the formation of the saturnian system in section  [ sec : saturn ] . in the rest of this paper , we focus on the model for jupiter .        as stated in section  [ sec : intro ] , we adopted the actively supplied gas - starved disk model in our calculations .",
    "our disk model is based on that by @xcite , in which the disk inner cavity is added to the model by @xcite with other slight modifications . in this section , we briefly summarize the model by @xcite .    for the case",
    "in which gas inflow from the circumstellar disk is limited to the region between @xmath21 and @xmath22 , @xcite suggested that the inner and outer radial boundaries of the inflow region for the proto - jovian disk are @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "this theory is consistent with the three - dimensional hydrodynamic simulation by @xcite , i.e. , @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the physical radius of jupiter .",
    "as adopted by @xcite and @xcite , we used @xmath27 in this study .",
    "the total inflow rate is expressed as @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the gas inflow timescale ; then the infall flux per unit area is @xmath30 .",
    "here we ignore the radial dependence of the inflow because the resolution of the current hydrodynamic simulations is insufficient to constrain the radial dependence of the infall , as will be discussed in section  [ sec : saturn ] .",
    "a disk is formed with the inflowing gas , which diffuses viscously .",
    "if the viscous diffusion timescale is shorter than the characteristic timescale over which the inflow changes , the gas disk can be described as a steady accretion disk , in which the inflow and viscous diffusion are equilibrated .",
    "according to the steady - state disk model derived by @xcite , the gas surface density of the disk is approximately given by ( appendix  [ app : disk ] ) @xmath31 @xmath32 where @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 are the viscosity , mass , radial distance from the planet , and physical radius of the bodies , respectively .",
    "the subscripts `` p '' and `` j '' denote quantities of the host planet and jupiter , respectively . because the magnitudes of turbulent viscosity and the gas inflow rate are not well determined",
    ", we introduce the scaling factor @xmath37 for gas surface density .",
    "we adopt an alpha model for the disk viscosity @xcite @xmath38 , where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the disk scale height and the keplerian angular velocity , respectively , and the sound velocity @xmath41 is derived thorough the temperature distribution @xmath42 .",
    "@xmath42 is determined by the balance between viscous heating and blackbody radiation ( appendix  [ app : disk ] ) as follows : @xmath43      gas surface density depends on the inflow rate ; thus , the decay of the inflow leads to a decrease in gas surface density ( and disk temperature ) . in our calculations",
    ", we generally assume an exponential decay of the inflow rate as @xmath44 , where the decay timescale @xmath45 is set to be @xmath46 years .",
    "we therefore adopt an exponential decay of gas surface density with a dissipation timescale of @xmath46 years .",
    "altough more accurate dependence of the inflow rate on the surface density is represented by @xmath47 , we used the same decay timescale for simplicity .    although infall flux decay associated with global dissipation of a protoplanetary disk is @xmath48 years , we introduce a significantly more rapid decay associated with inflow truncation by the gap opening in the protoplanetary disk .",
    "after the gap opening , the protosatellite disk would be rapidly depleted on the viscous diffusion timescale @xmath49 , @xmath50 the gap opening timescale itself would be comparable to @xmath49 @xcite ; therefore , both timescales are much shorter than accretion and migration timescales of satellites . in our calculations ,",
    "the disk gas is abruptly dissipated with @xmath49 , such that the satellites are `` frozen '' at that time .",
    "note that although hydrodynamic simulation suggests that the gap opening could not completely truncate the infalling gas ( e.g. , @xcite ) , even in this situation , results that are shown in this study remain unchanged because the infall rate would be reduced by several orders of magnitude .",
    "as long as the inflow cutoff timescale is shorter than accretion and migration timescales , which are @xmath51 , the results are not affected .",
    "that is , the results are not sensitive to the decay rate of the inflow",
    ".    as the location of the inner edge of the protosatellite disk is not well constrained , in our calculations , we set the disk inner edge at @xmath52 , which is slightly outside the current corotation radius of jupiter ( @xmath53 ) . at the disk inner edge ,",
    "the gas surface density of the disk smoothly vanishes with a hyperbolic tangent function with the width @xmath54 .",
    "we adopt @xmath55 , which is comparable to the disk scale height @xmath39 .",
    "in addition , satellites that migrate inside @xmath56 are disregarded from calculation mainly for computational reasons , which is also described in section  [ sec : tidal ] .",
    "based on the model used by @xcite , solid bodies are added to the calculation between @xmath57 and @xmath58 at a rate @xmath59 , where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the scaling factors of the amount of solid material and the increase of solid materials due to ice condensation outside the `` ice line , '' respectively . the solid infall flux per unit surface area is assumed to be uniform because we assume a uniform infall flux of gas @xmath62 , which is stated in section  [ sec : gas_density ] . when @xmath63 , the gas - to - solid ratio in the inflow is assumed to be 100 .",
    "however , the `` effective '' gas - to - solid ratio in the disk is not fixed to 100 , because gas surface density is also parameterized by @xmath37 and the solid materials which are decoupled from the gas evolve independently .",

    "@xmath64 is a scaling factor to allow for retardation and acceleration of type i migration .",
    "we include neither reverse torque of type i migration near the disk edge @xcite nor the radiative effect through the entropy gradient @xcite ; such issues will be resolved in future studies .",
    "instead , we handle @xmath89 as a parameter in some runs and focus on the effect of the eccentricity trap , which is a physical mechanism to halt type i migration near the disk inner edge @xcite .",
    "this trapping arises when a body with an elliptical orbit straddles the disk inner edge ; the body gains a net positive torque from the gas disk , which can compensate for negative type i migration torques that are exerted on a resonantly interacting convoy of bodies .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , @xcite assumed small @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( @xmath90 ) to obtain the damping rate of eccentricity .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite showed that the formulae of @xmath13-damping and @xmath84-damping must be multiplied by correction factors in the case of supersonic flow .",
    "when the correction factors are added to @xmath91 and @xmath89 , it is suggested that the eccentricity trap becomes more efficient because the correction factor for @xmath89 is a stronger function of @xmath92 than that for @xmath91 .",
    "however , we neglect these factors for simplicity .",
    "tidal dissipation within satellites plays an important role in satellite evolution .",
    "thus , we incorporate tidal eccentricity damping of satellites as a force acting on them @xcite : @xmath93 where the damping timescale is @xcite @xmath94 here , @xmath95 ( @xmath96 @xmath97 is the love number ) and @xmath98 are the effective rigidity and the tidal dissipation function of the satellites , respectively . although there is an uncertainty in @xmath98 , it is likely that both @xmath98 and @xmath95 are of the order of 10 - 100 @xcite .",

    "the migration timescale is @xcite @xmath100 where @xmath101 and @xmath102 are the tidal dissipation function and the love number of the central planet , respectively .",
    "the direction of migration is determined by the position of the satellite with respect to the corotation radius with the spin of the host planet .",
    "for example , if the satellite is on the inside of the corotation radius , the satellite moves inward .",
    "because the migration timescale is generally much longer than the simulation time , we neglect this effect . the change in semimajor axis due to dissipation within the satellite",
    "is also ignored because this timescale is also long except for very close - in satellites .",
    "the migration timescale has a strong dependence on the semimajor axis ; thus , extremely close satellites inside the corotation radius would fall onto the planet in a short time .",
    "as previously described , the current corotation radius of jupiter is @xmath103 ; satellites that migrate inside of this radius would be quickly lost to the planet .",
    "because of both computational cost and uncertainty in the corotation radius , we disregard bodies that reach @xmath56 from our calculation .",
    "in this section , we show typical results with our fiducial parameters ; the parameters for each simulation are listed in table  [ tbl : parameters ] .",
    "first , we perform _",
    "n_-body simulations in a gas disk that dissipates with the global dissipation timescale of @xmath104 , assuming that the solid inflow flux also decreases with the same timescale .",
    "then , the host planet opens a gap in the circumstellar disk at a certain time to enable the gas and solid inflow fluxes to rapidly decrease with a disk viscous diffusion timescale of @xmath105 .",
    "however , because the timing can not be determined , we randomly choose the moment and perform the subsequent simulation .",
    "we mainly focus on the _ n_-body results in a gas disk because we found that orbital configurations do not change after rapid gas depletion .",
    "orbital evolution of satellites embedded in a gas disk is presented in this subsection . in our fiducial",
    "runs ( models 1a , 1b , and 1c ) , the gas scaling factor @xmath106 is used , the solid inflow rate is fixed at @xmath107 , and the migration rate @xmath108 is assumed to be that predicted by the linear theory .",
    "we note that these parameters are not unique values but contain some uncertainties . in section  [",
    "sec : parameters ] , we will discuss the dependency of the results on these parameters .",

    "the orbital evolution for model  1a is shown in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : t_a_run1 ] . in this figure , 30 most massive satellites at each time are plotted as circles , the radii of which are proportional to the radii of the bodies .",
    "@xmath109 is the orbital period at @xmath110 around a jovian mass planet ( @xmath111 ) .",
    "the dashed line at @xmath52 represents the location of the disk inner edge .",
    "when a satellite with mass greater than @xmath112 falls onto the host planet , it migrates inside @xmath56 ; the descent is indicated by an arrow .",
    "the evolution of mass is shown in the top panel of figure  [ fig : t_a_run1 ] , which can be useful for physical understanding of what we observe here .",
    "the dashed line refers to the total mass added , and the solid line to the solid mass remaining within the disk .",
    "although many satellitesimals are not initially placed , solid materials are continuously added to the calculation , and the growth of satellitesimals proceeds in a manner similar to that of planetesimals around a star ( e.g. , @xcite ) . through orbital repulsion of oligarchs that form from planetesimals , their orbital separations",
    "are kept wider than five mutual hill radii .",
    "the typical orbital separation is @xmath113 , where @xmath114 is the mutual hill radius of oligarchs . as is discussed in @xcite , it is important to note that owing to the low solid inflow rate , the growth rate of a satellite is governed by the solid inflow flux .",
    "the accretion timescale is given by @xmath115 more detailed descriptions of satellite growth and the growth timescale are presented in appendix  [ app : growth ] .    when the satellite grows to a critical mass , which is determined by a balance between the accretion time @xmath116 and migration time @xmath89 , it begins to undergo orbital decay .",
    "the critical mass @xmath117 is estimated from equations  ( [ eq : tanaka_a_s ] ) and ( [ eq : acc ] ) as @xmath118 the critical mass in our fiducial case is @xmath119 , which is comparable to the masses of of the galilean satellites .",
    "because satellites grow to some extent during migration , the factor ( @xmath120 ) in equation  ( [ eq : m_crit ] ) , which places a lower limit on the satellite mass , would be smaller than unity for the case of the jovian satellite formation .",
    "a discussion of parameter dependence is given in section  [ sec : parameters ] .",
    "the migrating satellites exhibit dynamics different from those in @xcite because of the existence of the disk inner cavity .",
    "the satellite that reaches the disk inner edge no longer experiences gas drag , and migration ceases .",
    "the subsequently migrating satellite is captured into a 2:1 mean motion resonance with the inner satellite , leading to excitation of eccentricities ( @xmath121 ) of both bodies .",
    "the inner satellite that resides near the disk inner edge gains a positive torque from the disk , and eventually , the satellites captured into the 2:1 mean motion resonance remain in the disk .",
    "this trapping mechanism of bodies near the disk edge has been both numerically and analytically investigated by @xcite .",
    "they refer to the positive torque gained by the satellite and the trapping mechanism as the edge torque and the eccentricity trap , respectively .",
    "it should be emphasized that we do not establish a rigid wall at the disk inner edge or manually impose an edge torque to the satellite at the edge .",
    "we apply only instantaneous drag forces that have been physically examined in previous studies @xcite onto all bodies .",
    "if the body at the disk edge has a nonzero eccentricity , it moves back and forth between the inner cavity and the gas disk .",
    "when it moves into the gas disk near the apocenter , the tangential velocity of the body is slower than the local gas velocity ; therefore , the body suffers a tailwind .",
    "on the other hand , when it enters into the cavity near the pericenter , where the tangential velocity of the body is faster than the local circular keplerian velocity , the body does not feel gas drag , which results in a net positive torque on the body .",
    "@xcite determined that if the edge torque balances with the negative type i torque exerted on the bodies , the eccentricity trap works effectively and other migrating bodies can even be trapped without pushing the innermost body into the cavity .",
    "figure  [ fig : t_a_run1 ] shows that the eccentricity trap is retained , except at @xmath122 .",
    "in fact , this trapping ordinarily also occurs in other simulations not shown here . however , an upper limit exists on the total number of satellites that can be retained in the disk , which is discussed in section  [ sec : number ] .",
    "we also found that the 2:1 mean motion commensurability is universal in our _ n_-body simulations .",
    "figure  [ fig : t_r2_run1 ] shows the evolution of period ratios .",
    "open circles and triangles represent period ratios of the innermost and the second innermost pairs , respectively .",
    "although some satellites are pushed inside the 2:1 resonant location by outer migrating satellites and are captured into closer first - order resonances ( e.g. , 3:2 and 4:3 ) , almost all pairs , whose period ratios decrease above two , are locked in the 2:1 resonance .",
    "hence , the period ratio is two .",
    "however , the resonant angles do not always librate about fixed values but sometimes exhibit circulation .",
    "the commensurate value and the occurrence of the eccentricity trap , which regulates the number of trapped bodies outside the disk edge , depends on eccentricity damping and migration rates , which is discussed in section  [ sec : parameters ] .    satellites with mass @xmath117 begin to move inward and continue to grow during migration even after they are captured into a resonance . at @xmath123 when we stopped calculations , the masses were @xmath124 ( innermost ) , @xmath125 ( second innermost ) , @xmath126 ( third innermost ) , and @xmath127 ( fourth innermost ) , which are heavier than the current galilean satellites . for satellites with masses comparable to those of the galilean satellites to be formed , the gap opening time , in which the solid inflow is terminated , should be earlier than @xmath128 .",
    "in addition , the critical mass for migration ( equation  ( [ eq : m_crit ] ) ) must not exceed the masses of the galilean satellites .",
    "a discussion of satellite mass appears in section  [ sec : mass ] .",
    "we performed two additional runs ( models 1b and 1c ) under the same conditions but with different random numbers for additional satellitesimal locations , and we confirmed that the overall evolutionary tendency is identical .",
    "the averaged orbital distributions of the four innermost satellites ( @xmath129 ) at each time are plotted in figure  [ fig : e_a ] .",
    "circles , triangles , and squares represent averaged values over three simulations at @xmath130 , @xmath131 , and @xmath132 , respectively .",
    "error bars indicate 1@xmath133 dispersion .",
    "the semimajor axis distributions that are obtained at given times are similar to those of the galilean satellites .",
    "the three inner satellites are usually in the 2:1 resonance , and the fourth one is often captured into the 2:1 resonance .",
    "we set the disk inner edge at @xmath52 so that the innermost one is located at @xmath52 .",
    "this orbit is slightly interior compared with that of io ; thus , satellites in figure  [ fig : e_a ] generally exist closer than the galilean moons .",
    "the inclinations are kept small compared to the excited eccentricities due to resonant interactions , and they are comparable to the current inclinations of the galilean satellites .",
    "table  [ tbl : galilean_satellites ] shows @xmath13 and @xmath14 of the galilean satellites .",
    "the inflow is abruptly cut off because of the gap opening ; thus , the disk gas is depleted at a certain time during the evolution in figure  [ fig : t_a_run1 ] . because the time of the gap opening is unknown ,",
    "we randomly choose the moment and continue calculations with gas dissipation on the timescale of @xmath134 .",
    "figure  [ fig : continue ] shows subsequent evolution of model  1a in which the orbital calculation is restarted at @xmath135 .",
    "considering the formation of the galilean moons in which the fourth satellite , callisto , is not in a mean motion resonance , it is likely that this satellite underwent little or no migration . to achieve little significant migration , the gap opening timing , after which the circumplanetary disk dissipates on the timescale of @xmath49 , must be comparable to the timing of the completion of callisto formation .",
    "we assume the time to be @xmath135 .",
    "an alternative scenario is that callisto was accreted from the slowly inflowing materials during an imperfect gap opening @xcite , which naturally explains the inferred undifferentiated interior of callisto @xcite .",
    "both scenarios explain the non - resonant callisto .",
    "however , because the timing of gap opening can not theoretically be predicted , more detailed discussion of characteristics of callisto is left for future study .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ fig : continue ] shows the semimajor axis evolution .",
    "because the satellites are in mean motion resonances and their orbital separations are wide ( @xmath136 ) , orbital configurations hardly change .",
    "although the semimajor axis can be slightly decreased because of tidal dissipation , such an effect is negligible .",
    "tidal torque can also change the semimajor axis ; however , we ignore this effect , as previously stated .",
    "the right panel shows the eccentricity evolutions of the innermost ( solid line ) , the second innermost ( dotted line ) , and third innermost ( dashed line ) satellites .",
    "the @xmath13-damping timescale of the innermost satellite , which is located at @xmath52 , is estimated as @xmath137 ( equation  ( [ eq : e - damp_tide ] ) ) .",
    "this result is not strictly consistent with the actual damping time ( @xmath138 ) of the innermost satellite observed in figure  [ fig : continue ] , because eccentricities of outer satellites in resonances are also dragged down by tidal dissipation in the innermost satellite via resonant interactions between them .",
    "thus , the eccentricities of the resonant satellites become @xmath139 , which is consistent with thos of the galilean satellites ( table  [ tbl : galilean_satellites ] ) . regarding the evolution of the resonant angles , as the orbital energy",
    "is dissipated because of tidal @xmath13-damping , the satellites evolve deeper into the resonances , leading to a small amplitude libration around @xmath140 or @xmath141 . again , not all of resonant angles librate about fixed values . in three runs of all fifteen simulations ( models 1 , 3 - 6 ) , the laplace relationship , which indicates that @xmath142 librates , can be observed . the galilean - like configuration ( @xmath143 , @xmath144 , @xmath145 , and @xmath142 librate while @xmath146 circulates )",
    "is reproduced by one run of all .",
    "the definition of the resonant angle is presented in appendix  [ app : resonant ] .      by tracking the orbital evolution of all the satellites in the _ n_-body simulation , satellite composition",
    "can be discussed . as mentioned in section  [ sec : intro ] , a compositional gradient exists in the galilean satellites .",
    "that is , bulk densities of io , europa , ganymede , and callisto are 3.53 , 2.99 , 1.94 , and 1.83  @xmath147 , respectively .",
    "the composition of satellites is considered to be a reflection of disk temperature ; thus , we discuss in this subsection the origin of the compositional gradient in terms of disk temperature .",
    "disks can be classified into three classes : ( i ) hot , in which only rocky materials exist ; ( ii ) cool , in which the ice condensation line is located in the satellite - forming region , and rocky and icy objects coexist ; ( iii ) cold , in which water vapor can condense into ice in all parts of the disk .    to observe the effect of the ice line , we performed an additional set of _",
    "n_-body simulations ( model  2 ) by considering the enhancement of solid materials outside the ice line assuming @xmath148 , and we track the accumulation and migration of satellites . as noted in section  [ sec : solid_model ] , we assume that the ice line moves inward according to @xmath72 , which indicates that a cool disk is considered .",
    "figure  [ fig : t_comp ] shows the evolution of model  2a , in which the colors corresponds to the water ( ice ) mass fraction of satellites , from red ( dry ) to light blue ( up to 67% ) .",
    "( the colors are visible in the online version of the paper . )",
    "the long dashed line denotes the location of the ice line .",
    "the water content is calculated using the following prescription for components of satellites that originated at @xmath35 : @xmath149 in the case without the disk inner edge , icy materials can reach the innermost region with the timescale of type i migration ( @xmath150 ) , and fine - tuning of timing is required for the final survival of both rocky and icy satellites .",
    "the type i decay time should be comparable to the migration time of the ice line in the final state . however , as shown in figure  [ fig : t_comp ] , icy satellites stay outer region ( @xmath151 ) . because satellites are lined up outside the disk inner edge , migrating icy satellitesimals are consumed by the outer satellites captured into mean motion resonances , leading to the deficiency of icy materials in the inner satellites .",
    "thus , contamination of inner satellites by icy materials is prevented owing to the disk inner edge , and we do not have to rely on the fine - tuning of the timing .",
    "we find a monotonic increase in the water content with an increase in the distance from the planet . between @xmath152 and @xmath153 , the water mass fraction of the innermost satellite is @xmath154 , while that of the outer satellite is @xmath155 .",
    "this configuration is approximately consistent with the those of galilean satellites .",
    "however , after @xmath156 , the rocky inner satellites are lost to the planet because of the violation of the eccentricity trap . as a result ,",
    "the surviving satellites contain a large quantity of ice ( @xmath157 ) .    rather than the effect of the ice condensation line , we find in a companion paper ( nimmo , ogihara & ida , in preparation ) that the impact erosion of ices during accretion can produce the compositional gradient even in a cold disk .",
    "we find that the impact velocity increases with a decrease in the radial distance and exceeds @xmath158 at the orbits of io and europa .",
    "this observation is attributed to the high keplerian orbital velocity ( @xmath159 ) and a large velocity dispersion .",
    "thus , nearly all ice in the innermost body , which corresponds to io , and most of the ice in the second innermost body , which corresponds to europa , evaporates through collisions .",
    "the amount of ice vaporization depends on the mass ratio of the target and the impactor , the impact velocity , and the impact angle ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "detailed analysis is presented in the companion paper , in which the evaporation of ice owing to tidal heating is also discussed .    to summarize , to reproduce the compositional gradient by considering ice condensation outside the ice line , which indicates a cool disk , the following two conditions are necessary .",
    "first , the location of the ice line , in which there is an uncertainty , should be sufficiently far to enable the formation of a large amount of rocky satellitesimals .",
    "second , once icy materials move into the inner satellite formation region , the eccentricity trap of a resonant convoy should not be broken .",
    "we also find that fine - tuning of timings is not required .",
    "it is suggested that the gap opening at which the satellites cease to form occurs during the period when satellites are trapped by the disk edge .",
    "this inferred gap opening time is consistent with that assumed in section  [ sec : continue ] .",
    "in addition , we find that even if satellites are formed in the cold disk , the origin of the compositional gradient can be explained by collisional erosion of volatiles , as discussed in the companion paper .",
    "furthermore , we can exclude the possibility that the galilean satellites are formed in the hot disk , that is , jupiter did not open the gap in the protoplanetary disk when the circumplanetary disk was hot .",
    "in the previous section , we presented _ n_-body results of satellite accretion for our fiducial parameters and reproduced the properties of the galilean satellites ( e.g. , 2:1 commensurability ) .",
    "there are , however , uncertainties in the parameters that we used .    _",

    "this approach , in which dependences of parameters on properties of satellites are investigated , is valid not only for setting limits on parameters that reproduce the galilean satellites but also for discussing satellite formation in general , including satellite formation around extrasolar giant planets .",
    "we present the results of _",
    "n_-body simulations with various parameters in figures  [ fig : results_parameters](a)-(e ) .",
    "the model parameters for each simulation are summarized in table  [ tbl : parameters ] .",
    "the left panels of figures  [ fig : results_parameters ] show orbital evolution of each representative run , while the right panels display averaged orbital distributions of the four innermost satellites at each time over three runs .",
    "an exception is figure  [ fig : results_parameters](e ) in which only the three innermost satellites are plotted .",
    "the times are selected after the time at which the innermost satellite reaches the disk inner edge .",
    "figure  [ fig : results_parameters](a ) shows the case of model  3 , in which the gas surface density is 10 times higher than that adopted in model  1 .",
    "although the damping timescales of the eccentricity and the semimajor axis due to the gravitational drag become 10 times shorter , the trend agrees with that of model  1 .",
    "three to five satellites are lined up outside the disk inner edge , and they generally exhibit 2:1 mean motion commensurabilities . the critical mass for starting migration drops to @xmath167 , and the masses of satellites trapped near the edge are comparable to those of the galilean satellites ( @xmath168 ) before @xmath169 . after this time , the masses continue to increase as the satellites accrete inflowing solid materials . at @xmath170 ,",
    "the mass of the satellites that are trapped by the edge become @xmath171 , which is consistent with model  1 because the solid inflow rate is the same as that of model  1 ( @xmath107 ) . despite the increase in the eccentricity damping force ,",
    "the eccentricities of the satellites captured into resonances are nearly comparable to those in model  1 , because the eccentricities of the satellites exhibiting the eccentricity trap are given as a function of @xmath172 @xcite .",
    "figures  [ fig : results_parameters](b ) and ( c ) show the results of models 4 and 5 , respectively , in which the inflow rate of solid materials is changed .",
    "the critical mass for migration is proportional to @xmath173 ; thus , the change of the inflow rate by a factor of 2 leads to a variation of the critical mass by a factor of @xmath174 .",
    "the masses of satellites that are trapped by the edge at @xmath175 are @xmath176 ( model  4 ) and @xmath177 ( model  5 ) .",
    "although the masses of the migrating satellites change , altering the migration rate , the overall results are hardly affected .",
    "in particular , three to four satellites are captured into the 2:1 mean - motion resonance as is found in the fiducial model .",
    "figures  [ fig : results_parameters](d ) and ( e ) show the results of models 6 and 7 , in which the type i migration speed is reduced ( model  6 ) and increased ( model  7 ) from model  1 by a factor of 10 .",
    "the critical mass is changes ; however , the orbital configuration in model  6 , in which approximately four satellites in the 2:1 resonance are trapped by the edge , is approximately the same as in model  1 .",
    "the masses of satellites trapped by the edge at @xmath175 are also comparable to those in model  1 .",
    "however , the eccentricity trap is no longer effective in model  7 , which results in orbital distributions of satellites that differ significantly from those in other models .      in this subsection",
    ", we discuss properties of remaining satellites in detail . to further discuss the resonant configuration and the total number of formed satellites over a wide parameter range",
    ", we calculate the orbital evolution of hypothetical three satellite systems . here",
    "we show that capture into 2:1 resonance is robust for a reasonable range of parameters .",
    "the masses of satellites are set to @xmath178 .",
    "the gas surface density @xmath37 , which affects damping rates of @xmath13 and @xmath84 , and the migration speed @xmath64 ( hence @xmath172 ) are treated as free parameters .",
    "the results are summarized in figure  [ fig : small_body ] .",
    "filled circles and filled squares in the figure indicate that all the three satellites exhibit the eccentricity trap and are captured into the 2:1 and 3:2 resonances , respectively .",
    "filled triangles represent the cases in which the satellites exhibit the eccentricity trap but the inner pairs are in the 2:1 resonance and the outer pairs are in the 3:2 resonances .",
    "inverted triangles represent inner pairs in the 3:2 resonance and outer pairs in the 2:1 resonances .",
    "open squares represent transitional cases from the filled triangles to the filled squares in which inner and outer pairs are temporarily captured into the 2:1 and 3:2 resonances , respectively , outside the disk edge ; after a while , configurations of the inner pairs are converted to the 3:2 resonance when the innermost satellites move inside the edge .",
    "crosses represent cases in which the eccentricity trap is not realized , although the satellites are captured into the 2:1 or 3:2 resonances .",
    "asterisks show cases of satellites collisions .",
    "we find that the region ( filled circles ) in which satellites are captured into the 2:1 resonance outside the disk edge is vast .",
    "in fact , even with rapid migration ( @xmath179 ) and a high gas surface density ( @xmath180 ; @xmath181 ) , final configurations are identical .",
    "this region represents the necessary condition for the formation of the galilean satellites , suggesting that a galilean - like configuration in which the three satellites are in the 2:1 mean motion resonance can be formed with near certainty if the disk inner edge is sufficiently sharp . in some runs",
    ", we observe that the laplace angle @xmath142 librates about some fixed values .",
    "it is difficult to derive analytical formulae that represent the filled circle region because resonant capture for equal - mass multiple systems has not been analytically discussed .",
    "therefore , we obtain semianalytical conditions by using simplified treatments . from figure",
    "[ fig : small_body ] , we find that the following three conditions are necessary for capture into the 2:1 resonance outside the disk edge : ( i )  satellites should be trapped towing to the eccentricity trap to avoid falling onto the planet , ( ii )  eccentricity damping should not be excessively strong , and ( iii )  the migration speed should not be extremely rapid .",
    "next we derive semianalytical formulae for each condition .",
    "initially , the condition ( i ) is considered . for the eccentricity trap to occur ,",
    "a constraint on @xmath172 ( hence @xmath64 ) is derived by an argument similar to that provided in @xcite . if the edge torque , which is exerted on the innermost satellite because of the eccentricity damping force , balances migration torques of the outer satellites , then the satellites can be trapped by the edge .",
    "the trapping condition is obtained from equation  ( 32 ) of @xcite : @xmath182 where @xmath183 is the numerical coefficient @xcite , @xmath13 is the eccentricity of the innermost satellite , and @xmath184 is the number of trapped satellites .",
    "the first term is the edge torque , the second term is the migration torque on the innermost satellite , and the third term is the resonant torque from outer satellites . here",
    ", we assume that the satellites have nearly equal masses for simplicity .",
    "( note that we used a more accurate expression for the edge torque than that in equation  ( 32 ) of @xcite . )    from numerical calculations , eccentricities excited by resonances are well fitted by @xmath185 substituting equation  ( [ eq : e ] ) into equation  ( [ eq : e_trap1 ] ) , the following constraint on @xmath172 is obtained : @xmath186 where the second term of equation  ( [ eq : e_trap1 ] ) is ignored .",
    "the orbit of the innermost satellite partially enters the inner cavity , in which the satellite is not affected by the type i torque . in this case , the magnitude of type i migration torque on the innermost satellite should be smaller than @xmath187 , and the third term dominates the second term @xcite .",
    "the capture constraint by the eccentricity trap is plotted with a solid line in figure  [ fig : small_body ] .",
    "this condition is consistent with the results of orbital calculations .",
    "then , from condition ( ii ) , we derive a constraint by comparing timescales of excitation and eccentricity damping .",
    "the eccentricity excitation by a single distant encounter of two satellites on approximately circular orbits is given by @xcite @xmath188 where @xmath189 is the difference in the semimajor axes of the two satellites . because the distant encounter occurs at every synodic period @xmath190 the variation of eccentricity per unit time",
    "is expressed as @xmath191 for first - order resonances of @xmath192 , the orbital separation is expressed as @xmath193a,\\ ] ] then , equation  ( [ eq : de_dt_scat ] ) is reduced to @xmath194 where @xmath195 is assumed in the final transformation .",
    "a necessary condition for capture into a resonance is that @xmath13-excitation due to distant encounters should be larger than @xmath13-damping due to the gas drag described in equation  ( [ eq : tanaka_e_s ] ) : @xmath196 this leads to the following constraint on @xmath37 : @xmath197 from figure  [ fig : small_body ] , we find that the capture condition for the 2:1 resonance is well explained by @xmath198 , in which @xmath199 is used .",
    "this capture constraint is plotted with a dashed line in figure  [ fig : small_body ] .    finally , from condition ( iii ) , a necessary constraint condition on the migration speed is derived . according to both analytical @xcite and numerical @xcite studies of resonant trapping ,",
    "capture probability depends on the mass and the semimajor axis .",
    "the dependence of the critical migration rate , which can be represented by @xmath200 , for trapping is given as @xmath201 .",
    "then , we adjust the coefficient by our numerical calculations . the numerical result shown in figure  [ fig : small_body ]",
    "is fitted as @xmath202 which is the critical migration timescale of the three satellites for the 2:1 resonance , and it is plotted with a dotted line in figure  [ fig : small_body ] .",
    "the enclosed shaded region in figure  [ fig : small_body ] represents the condition for formation of galilean - like satellites .",
    "the results of three satellite calculations and the semi - analytical arguments are consistent with the results of _ n_-body simulations .",
    "figure  [ fig : model ] indicates the parameters used in our _ n_-body simulations on the gas surface density ( @xmath37 ) and the migration speed ( @xmath64 ) plane .",
    "the shaded region corresponds to that in figure  [ fig : small_body ] . in case of models  1 - 6 , the parameters are in a good region for reproducing the number and the resonant relationships of the galilean satellites , while the parameter values of model  7 is far from the eccentricity trapping limit .",
    "we also compare our results with previous studies , in which the hamiltonian model is used in case of rapid migration ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these studies have considered the circular restricted three - body problem with a massive planet and a massless test particle orbiting a central star to derive capture probability for first- and second - order resonances . because the bodies with comparable masses are captured into resonances in our simulation and the effect of eccentricity damping is included , it is not possible to directly apply their predictions to our case .",
    "however , we find that their results are approximately consistent with our _ n_-body results and hence our semianalytical arguments . in @xcite ,",
    "capture probability is derived as a function of the generalized momentum @xmath203 and the migration rate @xmath204 . since",
    "@xmath205 and @xmath206 are derived in the case of model  1 , it is determined from figures  2 and 11 in @xcite that capture into the 2:1 resonance is highly likely .",
    "therefore , our findings of a robust 2:1 resonance formation are also confirmed by the hamiltonian model .",
    "in addition , @xcite documented the following trends , which is also observed in our calculations : capture probability decreases with a decrease in mass .",
    "if the migration rate increases by @xmath207 times of that in model  1 , bodies tend to be captured into the closer 3:2 resonance .",
    "these features therefore agree with our semianalytical estimates .",
    "further investigation of the resonant capture for comparable masses including eccentricity damping is expected in future work .",
    "finally , we note that since the satellites are captured into the 2:1 resonance , the orbital difference @xmath189 is generally @xmath208 , which is larger than @xmath209 assumed in @xcite . in their calculations",
    ", small satellites are trapped between large satellites ; as a result , orbital differences between large satellites become @xmath210 .",
    "their assumption is valid for relatively fast migration cases ( e.g. , planet formation ) ; therefore slight improvement is needed .",
    "this is also discussed in section  [ sec : saturn ] .      in this subsection",
    ", we discuss the satellite mass by using semianalytical estimates . as mentioned in section  [ sec : growth ] , satellites grow according to the accretion timescale of equation  ( [ eq : acc ] ) . adding the exponential decay of the gas inflow ,",
    "we can obtain the satellite mass as a function of time by integrating equation  ( [ eq : acc ] ) : @xmath211^{3/2 } , \\label{eq : m_evolution}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath212 is the initial mass .",
    "the time dependence of @xmath35 is neglected .",
    "figure  [ fig : results_parameters2 ] plots the mass of the largest three satellites as a function of @xmath60 for 12 runs ( models  1 , 3 - 5 ) .",
    "the circles , triangles , and squares express the mass at @xmath213 , @xmath214 , and @xmath215 , respectively . the estimates of equation  ( [ eq : m_evolution ] ) are also drawn with the dotted line ( @xmath216 ) , the dashed line ( @xmath217 ) , and the solid line ( @xmath215 ) , where @xmath218 is substituted . because satellites migrate inward from the original locations , we neglect @xmath35-dependence .",
    "we find that the results are reasonably consistent with the estimates .",
    "however , it should be noted that although @xmath219 is assumed in deriving equation  ( [ eq : acc ] ) , the orbital separation of satellites trapped by the edge can decrease to @xmath220 with an increase in mass , and @xmath54 becomes independent of @xmath34 .",
    "thus , the power - law index in the right - hand - side of equation  ( [ eq : m_evolution ] ) decreases to unity .",
    "in fact , the slope at @xmath215 is close to the linear dependence of @xmath60 .",
    "@xcite showed that the mass of satellites and the total mass in a system are both regulated by the balance between the supply of the inflowing materials and orbital decay due to type i migration .",
    "the critical mass is derived in equation  ( [ eq : m_crit ] ) . however , in our case in which the inner cavity exists , the total mass regulation does not work effectively unless the eccentricity trap is inhibited . for a case in which",
    "the number of trapped satellites by the edge is equal to the critical number for the eccentricity trap , the configuration is destroyed and some satellites are lost to the planet if an additional satellite migrates and is trapped in a resonance . in other cases , the total mass continues to increase .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , when the total mass of the trapped satellites exceeds the disk mass , the satellites may be released to the host planet , and mass regulation occurs .",
    "in addition , recent magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ) suggest that the inner cavity may be buried by intermittent gas accretion onto the planet , and satellites trapped by the edge would episodically fall .",
    "these effects should be examined in detail through mhd simulations .    with an analytical estimate of the growth timescale",
    ", model parameters can be constrained for the formation of the galilean satellites . to prevent these parameters from exceeding the masses of the galilean satellites ,",
    "@xmath221 should be satisfied as a necessary condition , which leads to ( equation  ( [ eq : m_crit ] ) ) : @xmath222 where we neglect the impact erosion of ice .",
    "in addition , to be consistent with callisto s partially differentiated state , an accretion time longer than @xmath223 is implied to enable @xmath224 at the time of callisto s accretion ( equation  ( [ eq : acc ] ) ) .",
    "@xcite proposed that jupiter opened a gap in the protoplanetary disk to halt its growth , and saturn did not .",
    "the circum - saturnian disk gradually dissipated on the global depletion timescale of the protoplanetary disk ; therefore , in the final stage of satellite accretion around saturn , the circum - saturnian disk did not have an inner cavity because a low accretion rate would lead to a weak magnetic field , as discussed in section  [ sec : model ] .",
    "this condition is comparable with that adopted in @xcite ; however , properties of the saturnian system are not commonly reproduced either by their _",
    "n_-body simulations or our preliminary _",
    "n_-body calculations without the inner cavity .",
    "that is , the average number of final satellites is @xmath225 , while the number of large satellites ( @xmath226 ) in the current saturnian system is one ( titan ) .",
    "hence , the solid material distribution produced by _",
    "n_-body calculations is also not consistent in the current saturnian system .    according to equation  ( [ eq : acc ] ) ,",
    "the growth timescale of satellites decreases with distance from the central planet ; therefore , satellite seeds predominantly develop in the outer region ( @xmath227 ) , and the satellites exhibit inward migration . if the migration rate significantly increases during migration , the migrating satellites rapidly fall onto the planet , and as a result , a single satellite always exists in titan s orbit . @xcite",
    "assumed accelerated migration and showed that one or two satellites remain in the end ; however , their method for generating satellite seeds is not appropriate for satellite formation . because the migration timescale in protosatellite disks is proportional to @xmath228 ( equation  ( [ eq : tanaka_a_s ] ) ) , the migration rate is not accelerated ( @xmath229 ) during migration , which is observed in _",
    "n_-body simulations of @xcite and in this study .",
    "it should be noted that planets in a minimum - mass nebula , in which a steeper surface density profile ( @xmath230 ) is considered , undergo accelerated migration , because @xmath231 .",
    "thus , we suggest in this section several possibilities to reconcile the inconsistency .    in our calculations and also in those of @xcite and @xcite , the radial dependence of the gas inflow is ignored , which results in a relatively gentle gradient of gas surface density ( @xmath232 ) .",
    "if the gas inflow flux is inversely proportional to @xmath35 ( @xmath233 ) , the gradient of gas surface density becomes steep ; recent hydrodynamic simulations by @xcite suggest that @xmath234 .",
    "in addition , photoevaporation can produce the steep gradient of gas density @xcite .",
    "the type i migration speed increases in the region close to the central planet so that the satellites that begin to undergo migration are rapidly lost to the planet .",
    "our preliminary _",
    "n_-body simulations that include this effect suggest that the number of satellites decreases with an increase in @xmath235 .",
    "more detailed calculations are required , and it is also important to examine the radial and time dependence of the inflow flux by a high - resolution hydrodynamic simulation .",
    "another possibility is that the solid density is locally increased around titan s orbit ( @xmath236 ) , leading to the preferential growth of satellites in the region .",
    "the radial distribution of solid inflow and satellitesimal formation should be investigated .",
    "a detailed discussion of the saturnian system formation will be presented in a separate paper .",
    "we have investigated the formation of regular satellites around giant planets using direct _ n_-body simulations , including the effects of the eccentricity trap near the disk edge and the damping of the semimajor axis and eccentricity . through these simulations , we confirmed the following scenarios of the final stage of a satellite formation in a steady accretion disk with an inner cavity and a gas / solid inflow from a circumstellar disk :    1 .   within the inflow region , protosatellites accrete from solid materials in their feeding zones .",
    "when the satellites grow to the critical mass for migration , they begin to exhibit orbital decay . because the width of the feeding zone increases with an increase in distance from the central planet and disk surface density",
    "has a relatively weak radial dependence ( @xmath237 ) , satellites in outer orbits grow larger than inner satellites .",
    "when the satellites reach the inner disk edge , they cease inward migration .",
    "the subsequently migrating satellites are captured into mean motion resonances with the inner satellites .",
    "if the edge torque exerted on the innermost satellite balances the migration torque , the satellites are trapped near the edge , which is called as the eccentricity trap .",
    "satellites with the critical mass migrate inward to be trapped in successive resonances .",
    "if the number of trapped satellites exceeds the critical number for the eccentricity trap , the orbital configuration of the resonant convoy is disrupted , resulting in a loss of the inner satellites to the planet .",
    "that is , the total number of trapped satellites is self - regulated .",
    "4 .   the disk gas of circumplanetary protosatellite disks quickly ( @xmath238 ) vanishes because of truncation of inflowing gas by the gap opening along the planet s orbit in the circumstellar disk , and resonant configuration is frozen at that time .",
    "although the eccentricities of trapped satellites are excited by resonances , they are generally damped to @xmath139 through long - term tidal dissipation within the satellites .",
    "we tracked the compositional evolution of satellites in _",
    "n_-body simulations including the ice line beyond which water is condensed .",
    "as migration of icy satellites from the outer region ceases because of the eccentricity trap , inner satellites avoid contamination by water - rich materials , resulting in a radial compositional gradient .",
    "this composition is described as an increase in icy components with distance .",
    "in addition , it is suggested that to reproduce the compositional gradient , the gap opening needs to occur while the satellites are trapped by the edge via the eccentricity trap . an additional pathway for producing the compositional gradient",
    "is also suggested such that the volatile materials of inner satellites would be evaporated because of high - speed collisions during their accretion .",
    "furthermore , we examine the relationship between the characteristics of the final satellites and the model parameters by numerical simulations and semianalytical arguments to evaluate the probability of the galilean - like satellite formation .",
    "the physical properties of the galilean moons provide the following constraints on the model parameters .",
    "the number of satellites that can be trapped by the eccentricity trap restricts the ratio of the @xmath13-damping timescale versus the @xmath84-damping timescale : @xmath239 where @xmath240 is substituted into equation  ( [ eq : e_trap2 ] ) .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : cond_etrap ] ) is given as @xmath241 , which is usually satisfied in the protosatellite disk with the temperature of equation  ( [ eq : temp ] ) .",
    "the number of final satellites also depends on the inflow region of the solid materials , although the actual inflow region of gas and dust for the circum - jovian orbit is probably consistent with our adopted theory @xcite . by considering capture into resonances , constraints on the @xmath13-damping and @xmath84-damping",
    "timescales are derived .",
    "a necessary condition for capture into the 2:1 resonance is @xmath242 this parameter can be easily satisfied in the gas - starved disk ( @xmath106 ) , and this condition implies that an actively - supplied disk with either a much lower viscosity and/or a more rapid inflow rate than considered in previous works can also produce 2:1 resonant orbits .",
    "an additional condition for satellites with masses of @xmath243 is @xmath244 this parameter can also be satisfied because @xmath245 .",
    "we therefore find that formation of galilean - like satellites is robust , because even with fast migration and a high gas surface density over three satellites , they are captured into the 2:1 mean motion resonance outside the disk inner edge .",
    "the parameters for growth and migration are also constrained by considering that the satellite mass does not exceed the critical mass for migration : @xmath246 it is also inferred that the solid inflow is decreased ( @xmath247 ) at the time of callisto s formation . in addition , to prevent callisto from being captured into mean motion resonances , the gap opening timing of jupiter should be comparable to the timing of the completion of callisto formation . this theory is consistent not only with the gap opening time , which was inferred from the discussion of composition , but also with the time assumed in our calculation .",
    "we finally provide theoretical predictions for characteristics of exomoons , which should be detected in the near future .",
    "if the disk inner edge width is sufficiently sharp , the eccentricity trap is likely to occur because the value of @xmath172 is generally small even in the case that applies the full type i migration rate from the linear theory .",
    "the number of trapped satellites by the disk edge would be less than @xmath248 because the inflow region of solid material is probably consistent with that in the adopted theory @xcite . in the last stage of satellite accretion ,",
    "the gas surface density would presumably be less than @xmath249 so that the damping timescales of eccentricity and semimajor axis are sufficiently long to enable the capture of satellites into the 2:1 mean - motion resonance , unless the mass of the satellite is significantly small .",
    "these properties of multiple satellite formation and capture into resonances imply that the satellites can be substantially affected by tidal heating .",
    "the satellites that have a sufficient mass to retain water in the hz are potentially habitable . furthermore , according to tidal heating , their host planet is not required to be in the hz ; thus , the probability of forming europa - like habitable satellites , which have tidally heated oceans , would be high . from the perspective of tidally heated habitable moons , it is probable that satellites in relatively outer orbits retain water compared to close - in moons , which are strongly heated .",
    "tidal heating is extremely important for habitable moons ; therefore , further study of the evolution of satellites including tidal heating is necessary . by considering the migration efficiency and the accretion rate",
    ", the mass of normal satellite size would be @xmath16 , which is similar to that of the galilean satellites and titan .",
    "it is possible for observable exomoons ( @xmath250 ) to form around giant planets more massive than jupiter .",
    "satellite systems with a large mass ratio of the satellite to the host planet are more stable for detecting exomoons @xcite , and when the factor @xmath120 is larger than unity , larger satellites ( @xmath251 ) are formed .",
    "we find that several satellites are formed locked in resonances under the assumption that the host planet opens a gap around its orbit .",
    "@xcite proposed that if the planet does not create a gap , satellites are unlikely to form in resonances , such as that observed in saturnian satellites .",
    "because a gap opening indicates that the planet may undergo type ii migration , it is expected that satellites systems in mean motion resonances migrate inward to some extent .",
    "therefore , planets that reside in closer orbits probably harbor jovian - system - like moons , although destabilization by tidal torque @xcite or shrinkage of hill sphere @xcite may also be important .",
    "in contrast , saturnian - system - like moons orbit more distant planets .",

    "the growth rate of satellites is determined by the velocity dispersion @xmath133 and the spatial density of satellitesimals @xmath264 . when velocity dispersion is smaller than the surface escape velocity of the satellite core , the accretion rate of the core with the mass @xmath34 at @xmath35 is @xmath265 where @xmath266 is a numerical factor of 2 - 3 @xcite and @xmath267 is the surface density of satellitesimals in the disk . because @xmath268 and @xmath269 are large compared to the corresponding values for planetary growth at @xmath270 1 au around the sun , the accretion rate is relatively high .",
    "thus , the accretion timescale is @xmath271 where @xmath80 and @xmath13 are the internal density of the core and the rms eccentricity of satellitesimals , respectively . through numerical simulations , we find that @xmath272 and @xmath273",
    ".    however , in the case in which the core accretion timescale @xmath274 is smaller than the mass inflow timescale @xmath116 , the growth timescale is controlled by the inflow flux of solid materials , as determined by @xcite .",
    "satellites accrete materials across an annulus of width @xmath54 and grow in the timescale as @xmath275 where @xmath276 is the gas - to - solid mass ratio in the inflow , and @xmath219 is used .",
    "this derivation differs slightly from that of @xcite , in which @xmath277 is assumed",
    ". however , the timescale is approximately consistent .",
    "obviously , @xmath116 is longer than @xmath274 ; thus , @xmath116 can be considered as the growth timescale of the satellite .",
    "these estimates are in good agreement with numerical results shown in the text .",
    "the angels are defined as @xmath278 where @xmath279 and @xmath280 are mean orbital longitudes and longitudes of the pericenter , respectively .",
    "the subscripts @xmath281 1 , 2 , and 3 refer to the innermost satellite ( body  1 ) , the second satellite ( body  2 ) , and the third satellite ( body  3 ) , respectively .",
    "these angles represent displacements of longitude of conjunction from pericenters ; thus , @xmath282 indicates that conjunctions of body  1 and body  2 occur when body  1 is near the apocenter and body  2 is near the pericenter .",
    "if the angles librate about some fixed values , it is usually considered that they are in mean motion resonances .",
    "in addition , the laplace resonance is characterized by the libration of @xmath142 . in this case , conjunctions of body  1 and body  2 drift at the same rate as those of body  2 and body  3 so that triple conjunction is impossible .    for the galilean satellites , @xmath143 and @xmath144 librate about @xmath140 and @xmath141 , respectively , indicating that the conjunction longitude between io and europa is locked to io s pericenter and europa s apocenter .",
    "@xmath145 librates about @xmath140 , while @xmath146 circulates through @xmath283 , which indicates that the europa - ganymede conjunction is locked to europa s pericenter but to neither apse of ganymede .",

    "<S> as the number of discovered extrasolar planets has been increasing , diversity of planetary systems requires studies of new formation scenarios . </S>",

    "<S> we found that several satellites are formed and captured in mutual mean motion resonances outside the disk inner edge and are stable after rapid disk gas dissipation , which explains the characteristics of the galilean satellites . in addition , owing to the existence of the disk edge , a radial compositional gradient of the galilean satellites can also be reproduced . </S>",
    "<S> an additional objective of this study is to discuss orbital properties of formed satellites for a wide range of conditions by considering large uncertainties in model parameters . through numerical experiments and semianalytical arguments </S>",
    "<S> , we determined that if the inner edge of a disk is introduced , a galilean - like configuration in which several satellites are captured into a 2:1 resonance outside the disk inner cavity is almost universal . in fact , such a configuration is produced even for a massive disk @xmath0 and rapid type i migration . </S>",
