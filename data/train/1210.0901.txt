    "* background sources : * very little information exists about the radio properties of background objects below 100 @xmath50jy in flux density , especially when spectral index information is included . using the limited deep background source counts from the literature@xcite , we find that @xmath730.4 background objects with flat spectra and flux densities of 30100 @xmath50jy would be expected in the @xmath74 radius core of m22 . in the central @xmath18 ,",
    "@xmath75 source would be expected .",

    "for these reasons , we believe that it is very unlikely , but not impossible , that m22-vla1 and m22-vla2 are both background sources .",
    "background galaxies can have flat radio spectra through two scenarios : active galactic nuclei with partially self - absorbed jets , or star - forming galaxies in which the synchrotron emission is  diluted \" with thermal emission to produce a flat composite spectrum .",
    "active galactic nuclei are expected to dominate at the flux densities of our sources .",
    "most background radio continuum sources in the observed range of flux densities are found to have optical galaxy counterparts brighter than the @xmath13 completeness limit of @xmath77@xcite .",
    "this is especially true of sources with flat radio spectra , many of which are associated with relatively bright early - type galaxies at @xmath78@xcite .",
    "there are no candidate optical background galaxies that are plausibly associated with either source .",
    "by contrast , in the outer regions of our m22 vla image there is a canonical background galaxy : it has a flux density of @xmath79jy at 5.9 ghz and is resolved in the vla data , it has a spectral slope @xmath80 , and has an obvious distant early - type galaxy as an optical counterpart in the @xmath13 images .    two published studies with multi - band radio continuum imaging can be used to assess the occurrence of background dopplegangers to the m22 sources .",
    "the first uses deep vla 1.4 and 8.4 ghz data and @xmath13 imaging@xcite . of a catalog of 65 sources with optical data ,",
    "only two have inferred 5.9 ghz flux densities in the range 30 to 100 @xmath50jy and @xmath81 to + 0.2 , and both have bright ( @xmath82 ) early - type galaxy counterparts .",
    "another study used vla 1.4 and 4.8 ghz data in the chandra deep field south@xcite .",
    "here there are 12 sources that satisfy these flux density and slope ranges , though some of the spectral slopes have large uncertainties .",
    "eight of 12 are bright enough that they would have been detectable in the @xmath13 data ; two others are borderline . from these ( limited ) comparisons",
    "we conclude that the lack of background optical counterparts reduces the expected rate of radio sources with the observed properties by at least a factor of 23 .",
    "* pulsars / supernova remnants : * millisecond pulsars are commonly found in globular clusters",
    ". however , these have universally steep radio spectra@xcite ( @xmath83 ) , inconsistent with the flat measured spectra . in rare cases",
    "pulsars drive a wind that interacts with ambient material , termed a pulsar wind nebula .",
    "these objects have flat measured spectra and @xmath10 consistent with the constraints for our sources .",
    "however , they also generally have @xmath84 erg / s , a high degree of radio polarization , large sizes , are short lived , and are found in regions with dense gas , all inconsistent with observations@xcite .",
    "supernova remnants have similar properties and are also excluded .",
    "* accreting compact objects : * a number of candidates involve accreting neutron stars or white dwarfs . for most companions these systems will have much lower @xmath10 or @xmath85 than accreting black holes",
    ", so are not consistent with the observed constraints on our sources@xcite .",
    "figure 3 shows this graphically .",
    "the black hole data in this figure are compiled from recent papers on stellar - mass black holes@xcite .",
    "a contrived exception to this argument is if the sources are very strongly variable ; the radio luminosities could be consistent with flares from accreting neutron stars , which then might have @xmath86 just below that which would have set off all - sky x - ray monitoring satellites .",
    "however , this scenario would require the coincidence of both neutron stars flaring simultaneously .",
    "in addition , they would need to be abnormally faint in quiescence@xcite , since the typical @xmath87 for quiescent accreting neutron stars is @xmath88 erg s@xmath7 .",
    "symbiotic stars , which are white dwarfs accreting from luminous red giants , are ruled out by the optical source matching .",
    "* planetary nebulae : * planetary nebulae can emit optically - thin thermal emission at radio wavelengths , and would therefore show a flat spectral index consistent with our sources .",
    "however , planetary nebulae are also bright [ o iii ] @xmath89  emission line sources .",
    "no [ o iii ] nebulosity is observed around either source in archival @xmath13/wfpc2 images obtained in the narrow f502n filter . by contrast , the known m22 planetary nebula iras 18333 - 2357 is clearly detected in this @xmath13 [ o iii ] image , and is not detected in our vla radio continuum image .",
    "* foreground ultracool dwarfs : * the last remaining possibility is that the sources are nearby ( @xmath90 pc ) , cool ( late m to early l ) active dwarf stars in the foreground , which satisfy the @xmath10 constraints and which can have flat radio spectra@xcite",
    ". the stars can not be too nearby ( @xmath91 pc ) or else they would be detectable in the @xmath13 data , so they would need to be in a relatively narrow range of @xmath92 pc , the larger end of which would require strong flares ( and be inconsistent with the lack of strong radio variability of our sources ) . some ultracool dwarfs also show strong circular polarization@xcite , which we do not observe .",
    "cool dwarfs will be more luminous in the infrared , so we have consulted archival @xmath93 data from the vista vvv survey@xcite .",
    "these data rule out a cool dwarf identification with source m22-vla1 .",
    "the constraint for source m22-vla2 is less strong as it is located near the diffraction spike from a bright star .",
    "thus we can not fully discount this possibility for m22-vla2 , but consider it to be unlikely because of the rarity of these sources .",
    "we searched for variability in the radio sources by imaging each 2.5-hr data block separately and measuring their flux densities at each epoch .",
    "s1 shows the results . over the week of observations",
    ", m22-vla1 appears constant within the uncertainties , while the flux density of m22-vla2 appears to decrease monotonically by about 20% .",
    "this overall trend is significant at the @xmath94 level .",
    "thus , the evidence for variability is only suggestive with the present data , and additional observations are necessary to determine if significant variability is present .",
    "the core radius of m22 is @xmath95 pc , which is fifth - largest among luminous ( @xmath96 ) milky way globular clusters ( it is third - largest , next to m14 and m53 , if the anomalous clusters @xmath97 cen and ngc 2419 are excluded)@xcite .",
    "a number of processes can lead to an increase in the core radius for globular clusters that contain black holes , and could help explain the large core radius of m22 .",
    "the process dominant in some theoretical simulations@xcite is the formation of one or more black hole ",
    "black hole binaries in the cluster core .",
    "three - body interactions between one of these binaries and another black hole can eject the black hole from the core ( but not the cluster entirely ) , and as this black hole sinks back to the center through dynamical friction it heats stars , removing them from the core .",
    "it is not clear what the necessary minimum population of black holes is for this process to be effective@xcite .",
    "it is also possible that binaries containing a black hole and another object , such as a main sequence star or white dwarf , can also heat the core through three - body scattering interactions .",
    "black hole binaries with roche lobe - overflowing counterparts can have binding energies ( @xmath98@xmath99 erg s@xmath7 ) comparable to the total binding energy of all of the single stars in the core of a globular cluster .",
    "however , these interactions may instead lead to stellar mergers@xcite .",
    "a possibility frequently discussed in the literature is that stellar interactions with an intermediate - mass black hole ( @xmath100 @xmath12 ) can also lead to heating and core expansion@xcite .",
    "deep radio data for m22@xcite have ruled out central intermediate - mass black holes with masses @xmath101 @xmath12 ( @xmath102 ) but less massive black holes could still be present .",
    "these would have a mass ratio @xmath103 compared to the cluster mass and so it is unclear whether they could be solely responsible for a significant increase in the core radius , but some contribution is possible .    finally , it is possible that the large core radius of m22 is unconnected to the presence of black holes .",
    "it has been proposed that the dynamical evolution of most globular clusters is less advanced than generally supposed , and that many clusters are still in an initial , slow phase of core contraction@xcite . in this case",
    ", the unusually large core radius of m22 might just reflect the initial conditions of the formation of the cluster .",
    "here we mention a few possible explanations for the presence of multiple black holes in m22 .",
    "the discussion in the main text emphasized theoretical work suggesting that only one black hole or black hole ",
    "black hole binary will generally remain through long - term dynamical evolution of a globular cluster .",
    "a contrasting view is drawn from simulations in which the presence of black holes causes significant core expansion@xcite .",
    "this expansion leads to a large reduction in the stellar density in the core and slows the black hole interaction rate . under these circumstances , a significant fraction of the initial complement of black holes",
    "remain bound over timescales of several gyr .",
    "these simulations were designed to match magellanic cloud star clusters with lower masses and larger core radii than m22 and so have central densities much lower ( by a factor @xmath104 ) than m22 at the present day .",
    "comparable simulations tailored to the properties of m22 can help constrain the formation of m22-vla1 and m22-vla2 .",
    "a speculative hypothesis for the existence of multiple black holes arises from the observation that m22 has modest spread in [ fe / h]@xcite .",
    "[ fe / h ] dispersions are common among massive globular clusters and may be due to self - enrichment@xcite .",
    "it has also been proposed ( for m22 and other massive clusters ) that an [ fe / h ] spread is due to the merger of two or more globular clusters that were each homogeneous in [ fe / h ] , but with different mean levels of enrichment@xcite .",
    "such mergers could occur either in dwarf galaxies with low velocity dispersions or if the clusters were in binary systems .",
    "if these putative mergers happened after the formation and dynamical evolution of black hole subsystems in globular clusters , then , even if each cluster originally had only one remaining black hole , multiple black holes could be present after the merger .",

    "<S> these objects are the first strong candidates for stellar - mass black holes in any milky way globular cluster , and the first stellar - mass black holes to be discovered through radio emission rather than via x - rays.@xcite    the radio emission implies that the black holes are actively accreting , and the flat radio spectra are consistent with relatively low accretion rates@xcite ( @xmath113% of the eddington rate ) . because globular clusters have modest amounts of interstellar gas , it is very unlikely that the radio luminosity can be explained by bondi accretion . </S>",
    "<S> thus the objects can not be black - hole / black - hole binaries , and instead are probably in binary systems with roche lobe - overflowing companions . </S>",
    "<S> stellar - mass black holes ( @xmath2@xmath3 @xmath12 ) offer the best explanation for the presence of multiple sources close to the cluster center ; objects more massive than the average cluster star will sink to the center because of mass segregation .    to look for optical counterparts to the radio sources , we used archival _ </S>",

    "<S> m22-vla2 is @xmath16 from the nearest detected star , which is a @xmath17 @xmath12 main sequence star . </S>",
    "<S> considering the distribution of stars in the inner @xmath18 of the cluster , the probability of a chance coincidence as close as for m22-vla1 is only 2% ; for m22-vla2 it is 26% . </S>",
    "<S> thus we consider the optical association for source m22-vla1 suggestive , but that for m22-vla2 uncertain . </S>",
    "<S> however , for the case of m22-vla1 , there is an additional complication : since the average stellar mass in the core is greater than that of the putative companion , the low - mass main sequence star would likely be exchanged out of the binary in a three - body interaction with another star@xcite . on the other hand , because of the low central density of m22@xcite ( @xmath19 @xmath12 pc@xmath20 ) , a binary with a low - mass companion may survive longer than in a typical globular cluster . </S>",

    "<S> stellar - mass black holes with accretion rates below @xmath21 of the eddington rate@xcite ( in the so - called low / hard state ) follow an empirical correlation between radio and x - ray luminosity with a scatter of @xmath22 a factor of two@xcite . fig .  </S>",

    "<S> first , there is the possibility of variability . </S>",
    "<S> the x - ray data were taken in in 2005 , six years earlier than the radio data . </S>",
    "<S> field stellar - mass black holes in the low / hard state show substantial ( typically a factor of 210 ) variability in both radio and x - rays@xcite . therefore , concurrent radio and x - ray data are necessary for precise constraints on @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> we found marginal evidence for radio variability in m22-vla2 on the timescale of a week ; more details can be found in the supplementary information . </S>",
    "<S> another plausible explanation is that there is larger scatter in the radio  x - ray correlation at very low accretion rates . </S>",
    "<S> only a single known black hole binary has a measured radio luminosity as faint as our sources@xcite , and there is evidence that some stellar - mass black holes with low x - ray luminosities may not fall on the correlation@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> an intriguing possibility is that these sources have high values of @xmath10 because they are more massive than typical stellar - mass black holes in the field . </S>",
    "<S> the radio  x - ray correlation for stellar - mass black holes is a special case of a </S>",
    "<S>  fundamental plane \" for black hole accretion in the low / hard state that includes the black hole mass as a third parameter@xcite . in this relation , </S>",
    "<S> more massive black holes have larger values of @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> if our sources have masses of @xmath2520 @xmath12 rather than the 510 @xmath12 typical of field stellar - mass black holes@xcite , then their x - ray luminosities should be lower than predicted by the correlation in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3 by a factor of @xmath263 . </S>",
    "<S> it is reasonable to expect that black holes in globular clusters will be more massive than those in the field . </S>",
    "<S> field black holes with measured dynamical masses are all in binary systems and were probably affected by mass transfer during a common envelope stage that reduced the mass of the resulting black holes@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this need not be the case in globular clusters , since black holes can form as single objects or in wide binaries , and then be exchanged into pre - existing binaries or tidally capture companions due to the high stellar densities@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> globular cluster black holes also form at lower metallicity than in the field , leading to less mass loss from the progenitor and thus more massive remnants@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> as mentioned above , the location of stars in a cluster also gives information about their masses . </S>",
    "<S> stellar - mass black holes will mass - segregate to the core of the cluster . </S>",
    "<S> this process can be used to roughly estimate their masses by assuming thermalization , for which this relation holds@xmath27 : @xmath28 , where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the characteristic black hole mass and radius , @xmath31 is the typical stellar mass , and @xmath32 is the core radius . </S>",
    "<S> assuming @xmath33 @xmath12 in the segregated cluster core and taking the observed values of @xmath34 pc and @xmath35 pc , we estimate @xmath36 @xmath12 .    the existence of black holes in a low - density globular cluster such as m22 constrains the magnitude of initial velocity kicks received by the black holes at birth . </S>",
    "<S> the current central escape velocity of m22@xcite is @xmath37 km s@xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> this value may have been higher in the past , due to a larger cluster mass and a more compact structure . </S>",
    "<S> nonetheless , the retention of two black holes in a globular cluster with a modest escape velocity implies that the black holes could not have received large natal kicks . </S>",
    "<S> large kicks are inferred for some stellar - mass black holes in the field@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> low kick velocities can originate from supernovae if the black hole mass is large , or if the black holes form from direct collapse with no supernovae . in either case , higher black holes masses are favored .    </S>",
    "<S> the presence of black holes in a globular cluster can lead to an expansion of the core radius through interactions between black holes and stars . </S>",
    "<S> this could explain why m22 has the fifth - largest core radius among luminous ( @xmath38 ) milky way globular clusters@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> additional discussion can be found in the supplementary information .    </S>",
    "<S> most theoretical models in the literature predict that only a single black hole ( or black - hole / black - hole binary ) will survive the dynamical processes by which black holes mass - segregate to the cluster center , form an unstable subcluster , and evaporate@xcite . in some cases </S>",
    "<S> more than one black hole may temporarily survive for an additional black hole relaxation time ( @xmath39 gyr ) , if the extra black holes are kicked into orbits outside the core@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> additional discussion can be found in the supplementary information .    in contrast to these theoretical predictions , m22 contains more than one black hole . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , it is possible that more than two black holes are present in m22 , either as single black holes or in binary systems that are not undergoing observable mass transfer . under the uncertain assumption that both of the m22 sources are black hole  </S>",
    "<S> white dwarf binaries , published calculations can be used to estimate the fraction of surviving black holes that are actively accreting in present - day globular clusters@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> over 10 gyr , 240% of black holes are expected to become members of binary systems with observable accretion . </S>",
    "<S> our two observed sources thus suggest a total population of @xmath2100 black holes in m22 . </S>"
