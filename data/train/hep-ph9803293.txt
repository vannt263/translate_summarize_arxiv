    "it is widely believed that nonperturbative effects play a central role in describing the real world in superstring theories .",
    "horava and witten  @xcite have argued that the strong - coupling heterotic string theory is dual to an m - theory compactified on @xmath1 .",
    "the low - energy limit of this m - theory is well described by eleven - dimensional supergravity , where the fundamental energy scale is the eleven - dimensional planck mass @xmath2  gev , rather than the four - dimensional one @xmath3  gev  @xcite .",
    "the four - dimensional planck mass @xmath4 is only an effective parameter appearing at low energies .",
    "this m - theory description of strong - coupling heterotic string theory leads to various interesting new phenomenologies .",
    "banks and dine  @xcite have pointed out that the bulk moduli fields provide axion candidates in the m - theory compactified further on a calabi - yau manifold , and some of the axions survive at low energies , since world - sheet instanton effects are suppressed owing to the large compactification radius in the string tension unit .",
    "one of the string axions may acquire its mass dominantly from the qcd anomaly , and it plays the role of the peccei - quinn axion  @xcite in solving the strong @xmath5 problem .",
    "the decay constant @xmath6 of the m - theory axion is estimated as  @xcite @xmath7 this value greatly violates the constraint @xmath8  gev , derived in standard cosmology  @xcite . however",
    ", this problem may be solved by late - time entropy production through decays of moduli fields  @xcite or a thermal inflaton field  @xcite . since a very low reheating temperature , such as @xmath9 - @xmath10mev ,",
    "is required to solve the above problem , it is hard to imagine a consistent production of the lightest supersymmetric ( susy ) particles , and they can not be the dark matter  @xcite .",
    "thus , the m - theory axion seems the most plausible candidate for the dark matter in our universe .",
    "if the m - theory axion is indeed the dark matter , fluctuations of the axion density should consist of mixtures of adiabatic and isocurvature modes in general  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we show that a hybrid inflation model proposed by linde and riotto  @xcite naturally produces isocurvature fluctuations of the axion comparable to the adiabatic fluctuations that are in the accessible range of future satellite experiments on anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) .",
    "the present analysis , therefore , confirms the previous proposal  @xcite .",
    "let us now discuss the hybrid inflation model  @xcite , which contains two kinds of superfields .",
    "one of these fields is @xmath11 and the others are @xmath12 and @xmath13 . the model is based on @xmath14 symmetry under which @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the superpotential is then given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a mass scale and @xmath19 a coupling constant .",
    "the scalar potential obtained from this superpotential , in the global susy limit , is @xmath20 where scalar components of the superfields are denoted by the same symbols as the corresponding superfields .",
    "the potential minimum , @xmath21 lies in the @xmath22-flat direction @xmath23 .",
    "gauge symmetry , where @xmath12 and @xmath24 have charges opposite of @xmath25 , so that the @xmath26 term is allowed .",
    "] by the appropriate gauge and @xmath27-transformations in this @xmath22-flat direction , we can bring the complex @xmath28 and @xmath29 fields on the real axis : @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are canonically normalized real scalar fields .",
    "the potential in the @xmath22-flat directions then becomes @xmath33 and the absolute potential minimum appears at @xmath34 .",
    "however , for @xmath35 , the potential has a minimum at @xmath36 .",
    "the potential given by eq.([d - flat - potential ] ) for @xmath37 is exactly flat in the @xmath31 direction .",
    "the one - loop corrected effective potential ( along the inflationary trajectory @xmath38 with @xmath39 ) is given by  @xcite @xmath40,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 indicates the renormalization scale .",
    "next , let us consider the supergravity ( sugra ) effects on the scalar potential ( ignoring the one - loop corrections calculated above ) .",
    "the @xmath27-invariant khler potential is given by  @xcite @xmath42 where the ellipsis denotes higher order terms , which we neglect in the present analysis .",
    "here , we set the gravitational scale @xmath43  gev equal to unity .",
    "then , the scalar potential becomes  @xcite @xmath44.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as in the global susy case , for @xmath45 the potential has a minimum at @xmath39 .",
    "the scalar potential for @xmath45 and @xmath36 becomes @xmath46 in the first approximation , we assume that the inflaton potential for @xmath47 and @xmath36 is given by the simple sum of the one - loop corrections eq.([one - loop - correction ] ) and the sugra potential eq .",
    "( [ sugra - correction ] ) : @xmath48.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] hereafter , we study the dynamics of the hybrid inflation with this potential .",
    "we suppose that the inflaton @xmath31 is chaotically distributed in space at the planck time and it happens in some region in space that @xmath31 is approximately the gravitational scale and @xmath32 is very small ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "then , the inflaton @xmath31 rolls slowly down the potential , and the region inflates and dominates the universe eventually . during the inflation , the potential assumes an almost constant value .",
    "also the hubble parameter changes only very slightly and it is given by @xmath50 .",
    "when @xmath31 reaches the critical value @xmath51 , a phase transition occurs and the inflation ends .",
    "in order to solve the flatness and horizon problem we need an _ e_-folding number @xmath52 @xmath53  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the adiabatic density fluctuations during the inflation should account for the observation by cobe , which leads to  @xcite @xmath54 the evolutions for @xmath31 and @xmath52 are described by @xmath55 which are numerically integrated with @xmath56 and eq .",
    "( [ inf - n60 ] ) as boundary conditions .",
    "though the inflaton potential is parametrized by three parameters ( @xmath57 , and @xmath18 ) , we can reduce the number of the free parameters from three to two by using the constraint eq .",
    "( [ inf - n60 ] ) .",
    "we consider @xmath18 as a function of @xmath19 and @xmath58 , i.e. @xmath59 .    when @xmath60 , the slow roll approximation can not be maintained .",
    "therefore , if the obtained value of @xmath61 is larger than the gravitational scale , we should discard those parameter regions .",
    "also , one of the attractions of the hybrid inflation model is that one does not have to invoke extremely small coupling constants .",
    "thus we assume all of the coupling constants @xmath19 and @xmath58 to have values of @xmath62 . here , we choose @xmath63 as a `` reasonable parameter region '' ( when @xmath64 , @xmath65 exceeds unity , and @xmath52 can not be as large as 60 ) .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : no - iso ] , where we plot the hubble parameter during the inflation , @xmath66 , as a function of @xmath19 and @xmath58 .",
    "one may see easily from fig .",
    "[ fig : no - iso ] that @xmath67 is large ( @xmath68 ) with the reasonable values of the coupling constants @xmath69",
    ". when @xmath67 has such a large value , the inflation should generate large isocurvature fluctuations of the axion , if it exists . in the above calculations ,",
    "we have neglected the isocurvature fluctuations .",
    "hence , to be consistent , we must take account of the effects of the isocurvature fluctuations when we normalize the inflaton potential by cobe ; i.e. , we must modify eq .",
    "( [ inf - n60 ] ) .",
    "we will estimate @xmath67 taking account of the isocurvature effects later .",
    "we now evaluate the contribution of the isocurvature fluctuations assuming the existence of the m - theory axion .",
    "kawasaki , sugiyama and yanagida  @xcite defined @xmath70 as the ratio of the initial entropy perturbation to the adiabatic one when the universe is radiation dominant , and found it to assume the form  ) is different from eq .",
    "( 5 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite by a factor of @xmath71 due to a typographical error appearing there . ] @xmath72 here , @xmath73 is the initial value of the axion field . in this paper , we redefine @xmath70 as the ratio of the _ present _ ( the universe is matter dominant ) matter power spectra .",
    "therefore , in our notation , @xmath74 implies that the adiabatic and the isocurvature matter power spectra have the same value in the long wavelength limit .",
    "the old version @xmath75 in eq .",
    "( [ alpha - old ] ) is related to our new version @xmath70 as comes from the value of the transfer function in the long wavelength limit  @xcite , and the extra factor @xmath76 is due to the decay of the gravitational potential at the transition from the radiation dominated universe to the matter dominated one . ]",
    "@xmath77 the isocurvature fluctuations give a contribution to the cmb anisotropies which are about six times larger than the adiabatic ones in the long wavelength limit . at the cobe scales , this factor somehow decreases , and the precise value depends on @xmath78 and @xmath79 , and is a monotonically increasing function of these parameters .",
    "here , @xmath78 is the ratio of the present energy density to the critical density , and @xmath79 is the present hubble parameter normalized by @xmath80  km s@xmath81 mpc@xmath81 . if we take @xmath82 and @xmath83 , the factor is approximately @xmath84 .",
    "therefore , when we take account of the isocurvature fluctuations , the correct cobe normalization becomes @xmath85 rather than eq .",
    "( [ inf - n60 ] ) . here",
    ", we have ignored the tensor perturbations since they are negligibly small in our model .",
    "note that the spectral index is almost unity in our model .    from eqs .",
    "( [ alpha - old ] ) , ( [ alpha - relation ] ) , and ( [ iso - cobe ] ) , one may see that @xmath86 for the m - theory axion , the decay constant @xmath6 is estimated as @xmath87  gev  @xcite .",
    "this value is much larger than the constraint on @xmath88 , @xmath89  gev , which comes from the requirement that the axion should not overclose the universe .",
    "however , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite this constraint is greatly relaxed if late - time entropy production occurs . in this case , the unclosure condition for the present universe leads to an upper bound on @xmath90 : @xmath91 here the reheating temperature after late - time entropy production is taken as @xmath92  mev .",
    "thus , a decay constant @xmath93  gev of the m - theory axion is allowed if we take @xmath94 , which is not an unnaturally small value .",
    "if one takes @xmath95  gev as in the standard invisible axion model , the isocurvature fluctuations become too large .",
    "thus the large value of @xmath88 for the m - theory axion is a rather crucial point in our mixed fluctuation model .",
    "we are at the point of evaluating @xmath70 , which depends on two parameters @xmath73 and @xmath67 , as seen from eq .",
    "( [ fa - alpha ] ) .",
    "we take @xmath96  gev , which has been obtained for the case of @xmath97 .",
    "we have , however , found that similar values of the hubble constant @xmath67 are obtained even for @xmath98 , as long as @xmath99 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : alpha-0.01 ] we plot @xmath67 for @xmath100 as an example . from eq .",
    "( [ fa - alpha ] ) we derive @xmath101 for @xmath102  gev and @xmath96  gev .",
    "the mixture of isocurvature and adiabatic fluctuations is astrophysically interesting .",
    "since isocurvature fluctuations yield anisotropies of the cmb that are six times larger than those caused by adiabatic fluctuations , mixed fluctuations reduce the amplitude of the power spectrum if the amplitude is normalized by cobe .",
    "it is well known that the standard cold dark matter scenario ( @xmath103 ) with cobe - normalized pure adiabatic fluctuations predicts density fluctuations that are too large on scales of galaxies and clusters .",
    "this problem is avoided if the isocurvature fluctuations are mixed with adiabatic ones , as is pointed in ref .",
    "furthermore , it can be shown that for the general flat universe ( @xmath104 , with @xmath105 the cosmological constant ) , the shape and amplitude of the power spectrum are in good agreement with observations if @xmath106  @xcite",
    ".    the cmb anisotropies induced by the isocurvature fluctuations can be distinguished from those produced by pure adiabatic fluctuations  @xcite , because the shapes of the angular power spectrum of cmb anisotropies are quite different from each other on small angular scales .",
    "the most significant effect of the mixture of the isocurvature fluctuation is that the acoustic peak in the angular power spectrum decreases . in fig .",
    "[ fig : mix_sample ] we show the angular power spectrum for @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 as an example .",
    "it is seen that the height of the acoustic peak ( @xmath110 ) in the case of mixed fluctuations is greatly reduced compared with the pure adiabatic case .",
    "since the axion decay constant @xmath6 is much higher than @xmath111  gev , a direct search for the m - theory axion is implausible .",
    "therefore , observations of cmb anisotropies by future satellite experiments ( map  @xcite , planck  @xcite ) are very crucial to test the m - theory axion hypothesis .",
