    "recently , cogent @xcite has reported an excess of events at low nuclear recoil .",
    "it is unknown what the source of the events is , but it is consistent with a light dark matter ( dm ) particle in the 7 - 11 gev range interacting with their germanium crystals .",
    "the region is remarkably close to the mass and cross - section preferred by the dama experiment s @xcite observation of an annual modulation @xcite .",
    "the dm mass window in the several gev range is well - motivated by several models of dm @xcite , notably models that solve the baryon - dm coincidence problem @xcite .    at the same time , the preferred cross - section and dm masses of the two experiments , while being close to each other in parameter space , are naively inconsistent with each other .",
    "they are also naively inconsistent with the results of other null experiments , the most relevant of which are the silicon run of cdms @xcite and xenon10 @xcite .",
    "the cogent region overlaps neither with the dama region for channeled scattering off iodine , nor with the dama region for unchanneled scattering off sodium @xcite .",
    "however , we have also begun to learn more recently about the experimental uncertainties which must be properly taken into account to make a conclusion about the relevance of experimental constraints for excluding the light dm window , as well as for the consistency of the dama and cogent signals with each other .",
    "for example , a new measurement of the scintillation light yield efficiency , @xmath0 @xcite , opens an allowed region for dama channeled spin - independent scattering off iodine @xcite .",
    "in addition , by choosing the sodium and germanium quenching factors appropriately , the dama unchanneled and cogent spin - independent scattering regions can be marginally consistent with each other @xcite .",
    "lastly , by assuming a 20% systematic uncertainty in the energy threshold for the constraint from cdms silicon , the region in which the two signals are consistent with each other can be made consistent with the null observation of cdms .",
    "while obtaining consistency in this way is marginally possible for spin - independent scattering , it does stretch the experimental parameters and theoretical uncertainties to their limits in order to allow it .",
    "the purpose of this paper is two - fold .",
    "first , we unpack the results of @xcite to show more explicitly how the experimental and theoretical uncertainties allow for better agreement between the signals of dama and cogent with each other and with the results of null experiments for standard spin - independent scattering .",
    "we find , however , that pushing all the experimental systematic uncertainties beyond the edge of their @xmath1 preferred values only allows agreement between dama and cogent in the 99% c.l . regions .",
    "we then demonstrate that with the choice of a different operator to mediate the scattering , significantly better agreement can be obtained .",
    "tension with the null results of cdms - si and xenon can also be alleviated .",
    "interestingly , the operators that we consider , the dark anapole and magnetic dipole moment operators , @xmath2 are unique in that the contributions from spin - dependent and spin - independent scattering can be equal for some elements ( sodium in particular ) . , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "this operator has the same spin structure as eq .",
    "( [ anapole ] ) , but has an additional @xmath3 suppression . ] the model that we have in mind is a massive dark photon kinetically mixed with the visible photon .",
    "that the coupling to nuclei in the scattering goes through the sm photon imposes constraints on the coefficients of the scattering cross - section which we utilize .",
    "these operators also have unusual velocity and momentum dependence : @xmath4 with @xmath5 the mediator mass , @xmath6 an expansion parameter ( associated in some models with strong coupling in the dm state ) , @xmath7 the nucleus mass , @xmath8 the dm mass , and @xmath9 and @xmath10 the momentum transfer and velocity of the incoming wimp .",
    "we use the standard notation for the form factors @xmath11 for a coupling of a gauge field to @xmath12 , _ e.g. _ @xmath13 when @xmath12 is spin-1/2 .",
    "this unusual momentum and velocity dependence has been noted before in other contexts @xcite , though in most of these cases only some of the terms in the full expression are considered ( but see @xcite ) .",
    "we find , by contrast , that both terms arising from the magnetic and electric form factors can be important and give rise to significantly modified spectra .    in this paper",
    "we show that non - standard velocity and momentum dependence can , depending on how they enter into scattering cross - section , reconcile the dama and cogent regions .",
    "the dark magnetic dipole moment interaction in particular has the right structure to give agreement between the two experiments , consistent with null results of other direct detection experiments .",
    "the dark anapole interaction on the other hand does not bring the two experimental regions together , and its main benefit is to alleviate tension between dama and the null results . the magnitude of the shifts in the preferred dama and cogent regions , and whether this leads to better agreement , is a detailed numerical question .",
    "this can however be understood qualitatively as follows .",
    "cogent records slightly lower momentum transfer than dama , and since these operators are momentum suppressed , this causes cogent to shift slightly up relative to dama in comparison to the standard spin - independent case .",
    "more importantly for these operators , however , is the velocity dependence .",
    "the maximum momentum transfer depositable in the detector is @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the dm - nucleus reduced mass . since the typical momentum transfers observed by cogent are lower than those observed by dama , and the reduced mass of germanium is higher than that of sodium , the typical velocities of particles observed by cogent are significantly lower than those of dama , further suppressing the overall scattering rate in cogent , and further shifting the cogent region up relative to dama .",
    "the relative importance of these effects and the amount that it improves the agreement between dama and cogent is a question we address in detail in this paper .",
    "the types of models in which the anapole and magnetic moment operators dominate the scattering are not hard to construct . for a majorana particle scattering through a vector mediator , for example , @xmath16 vanishes , and one expects the anapole to be the dominant contribution .",
    "for dirac particles , one can explicitly construct models where the coupling of the dm particles is purely axial .",
    "likewise , the dm can have a large magnetic moment when constituents charged under a dark force are bound into a neutral state . because the rates are velocity and momentum suppressed , the corresponding scattering cross - section must be large .",
    "this can be accommodated with a light mediator which is weakly coupled to standard model particles .",
    "we discuss a model where the large cross - section generates both the observed rate and is consistent with the results of null experiments .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in the next section we lay out the rates for standard spin - independent scattering and for the anapole and magnetic dipole operators .",
    "we then turn to discussing the effect of the experimental uncertainties on standard spin - independent , anapole and magnetic dipole scattering cases , and show how , properly accounting for these uncertainties , we can bring the two results into better agreement .",
    "we focus in particular on the sodium quenching factor , xenon prompt photon ( @xmath17 ) to nuclear recoil conversion factor @xmath0 , the stochasticity of photo - electrons in xenon10 , and the systematic uncertainty in the cdms - si energy threshold .",
    "lastly , we discuss models that generate the observed event rates , and conclude .",
    "we begin by reviewing the standard scattering rates and then turn to a discussion of the anapole and dipole rates .",
    "the rate for scattering is = n_t _ || > v_min d^3v v f(,_e ) , [ totalrate ] where v_min= , and @xmath15 is the reduced mass of the nucleus - dark matter system .",
    "we take the velocity distribution @xmath18 to be a modified boltzmann distribution : f(,_e ) ( e^-(+_e)^2/v_0 ^ 2-e^-v_esc^2/v_0 ^ 2 ) ( v_esc^2-(+_e)^2 ) .",
    "the additional term is to allow for a smooth cut - off of the velocity distribution near the galactic escape velocity @xmath19 .",
    "the earth s speed relative to the galactic halo is @xmath20 $ ] with @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "we take as a standard case @xmath26 but allow @xmath27 to vary up to 270 km / s , with higher values decreasing the tension with xenon10 .",
    "we fix @xmath28 ; allowing this to vary changes the dama and cogent windows only by a small amount , though the constraints from xenon10 become more stringent for larger @xmath29 .",
    "a standard calculation relates the differential rate for scattering off nuclei to the scattering rate off a nucleus @xmath30 , = .",
    "[ eq : ratenorm ] for the standard spin - independent case , this rate is related to a scattering off protons , @xmath31 , through _",
    "p f^2(e_r ) , where @xmath32 is the dm - nucleon reduced mass and @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the dark matter couplings to the neutron and proton .",
    "we set @xmath35 since this is the normalization that will arise most naturally in the models we discuss later , would give slightly different results .",
    "in particular , @xmath36 is approximately 30% larger for germanium than for silicon , and thus the cdms - si constraints on cogent would be weakened by approximately this amount .",
    "similarly , the region of parameter space favored by sodium scattering at dama would move up about 20% in cross - section relative to cogent , which would help ( hurt ) agreement between the two regions in the case of scattering through the dipole or anapole ( standard ) coupling . ]",
    "and we consider two different choices for the form factor @xmath37 , which can give rise to @xmath38 variations in the derived cross - sections .",
    "we make use of a helm form factor f(e_r ) = e^-(qs)^2 fm^2 /2 , with two different choices for @xmath39 : r_0 = ( ( 1.2 a^1/3)^2 - 5 s^2)^1/2 [ r01 ] with @xmath40 , and r_0 = ( ( 1.23 a^1/3-a)^2 + ^2 b^2 - 5 s^2 ) ^1/2 , [ r02 ] with @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 @xcite .",

    "we take the constraints derived from the set - up of @xcite , and we derive results from the simple experiment for 14 kg - days @xcite .",
    "obtaining constraints from xenon10 is more involved .",
    "recently , it was pointed out that the effects of stochasticity in the number of @xmath17 photo - electrons ( pes ) observed can be important for constraining dm in the low mass window @xcite . in particular ,",
    "each nuclear recoil energy can be mapped onto the number of prompt @xmath17 pes expected in each scatter . to suppress background contamination",
    ", xenon10 cuts out events with fewer than two pes , which for a given @xmath0 roughly corresponds to a recoil energy threshold @xmath70 given implicitly by @xmath71",
    ". however , there can be low - energy recoil events below @xmath70 that , thanks to poisson fluctuations and detector resolution , nevertheless make it over the s1 cut .",
    "since the dm signal is highly peaked near low energies , this results in more dm signal events being tipped above threshold by the fluctuations than below , resulting in a tighter constraint .",
    "this was utilized by xenon100 to purportedly rule out the cogent window @xcite . in that analysis , however , a high @xmath0 converting expected @xmath17 photo - electrons to nuclear recoil energy was employed .",
    "a choice of a larger @xmath0 translates to a lower energy threshold and a strong constraint on light dm .",
    "we think it likely that the @xmath0 chosen there is too high , and hence the constraints are too strong . here",
    "we focus on xenon10 constraints , which are in general more restrictive than those due to xenon100 on account of its higher threshold .",
    "we will follow the procedure outlined in @xcite , and make use of the detector resolution and efficiency derived in that analysis .",
    "in particular , we show in each constraint plot the 90% limit based on two different assumptions on @xmath0 .",
    "both assumptions take the central values measured for @xmath0 in @xcite , but the first ( stronger ) constraint assumes a constant @xmath0 below the lowest measured energies , and the second ( weaker ) constraint assumes a linear interpolation to zero at vanishing recoil energy .",
    "the constraint on a wimp model is determined by the predicted rate of events after convolving with the detector resolution and taking into account detector and cut efficiencies : = _ 2 kev d e_r ( e_r ) ( e_r)(e_obs ) . here ,",
    "@xmath72 and @xmath73 are detector and cut efficiencies ( including the acceptance rate of the `` 50% '' acceptance box ) , taken from @xcite and @xcite respectively , and @xmath74 is the detector resolution also from @xcite , which is somewhat broader than a pure poisson distribution as utilized in @xcite .",
    "we further cut off the low end of the integration over recoil energies at @xmath75 , though due to the low detection efficiency at such low energies , the constraint is not strongly dependent on the exact limit .",
    "the constraints derived from these two extrapolations of @xmath0 are shown as the edges of the green band in the figures .",

    "[ fig : spectra],title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]    we have shown here than when experimental uncertainties are taken into account appropriately , that a region of parameter space where dama and cogent are consistent with the results of null experiments is available .",
    "agreement can be improved by considering the effects of the scattering primarily through the magnetic dipole operator .",
    "we now turn to a brief discussion of models where the anapole and magnetic dipole operators are the dominant form of scattering .",
    "though different in detail , both the anapole and magnetic dipole operators are velocity and momentum suppressed , and thus need sufficiently large cross - sections to explain the event rates seen at dama and cogent .",
    "therefore the mass of the dark photon @xmath89 that mediates the interaction should be fairly light .",
    "for example , consider the mass of the mediator necessary to generate the large cross - sections for scattering through the anapole interaction , eq .",
    "( [ anapole ] ) .",
    "that cross - section scales as = = 10 ^ -34 ^2 ( ) ^4 , where @xmath90 @xmath91 is approximately the size needed for @xmath92 , from fig .",
    "[ fig : anapole1 ] .",
    "a cross - section of this size is not difficult to generate .",
    "consider a model with a weyl fermions @xmath93 and complex scalar @xmath94 with charges @xmath95 , respectively .",
    "a second weyl fermion @xmath96 is present for anomaly cancellation , but otherwise plays no role ; we impose a @xmath97 symmetry under which @xmath93 is odd and all other fields are even in order to restrict the possible interactions of @xmath96 with @xmath93 .",
    "the allowed renormalizable interactions within the dark sector are then the following : @xmath98 we assume that @xmath94 dynamically obtains a vev @xmath99 gev , which gives mass to @xmath93 and the dark gauge boson .",
    "the @xmath93 mass term after symmetry - breaking is majorana , which gives a simple explanation for why the anapole operator dominates : the leading vector operator @xmath100 vanishes for majorana fermions .",
    "the dark majorana particles can couple to the dark force because the dark gauge group is broken .",
    "other interactions of @xmath93 with the dark force are higher dimensional and therefore suppressed relative to the anapole interaction .",
    "parity is badly broken in the dark sector , and a dark electric dipole moment ( edm ) , while higher - dimensional , has the same @xmath3 suppression as the anapole interaction .",
    "however , such a dark edm must be generated radiatively and therefore be phase - space suppressed relative to the anapole .",
    "the dark sector then interacts with the standard model through kinetic mixing @xmath73 of the light dark force with field strength @xmath101 with hypercharge : - f_f^ + f _ b^",
    ". then we find = 10 ^ -34 ^2 ( ) ^2 ( ) ^2 ( ) ^2 , where @xmath102 is the gauged messenger mass and @xmath103 is the dark gauge coupling .",
    "these choices for @xmath73 and @xmath104 are consistent with the bounds on kinetic mixing .",
    "the magnetic dipole operator may also be easily generated with a sufficiently large cross - section .",
    "it arises quite naturally when the dm is a dirac fermion composite .",
    "consider the case where the dark matter @xmath93 is a fermionic bound state with compositeness scale @xmath6 .",
    "if @xmath93 is not charged under the dark gauge force , but its constituents are ( similar to the neutron and the electromagnetic force ) , then at low momentum transfer its interactions with the standard model will shut off .",
    "we require that the scale @xmath6 be above the momentum transfer @xmath105 mev relevant for scattering at dama , so that we may parametrize the interactions of @xmath93 with the dark gauge field in terms of the lowest dimensional gauge - invariant operator , @xmath106 . here",
    "we are assuming that parity is not violated in the dark sector , so that a dark edm can not be generated . in our constraint plots ,",
    "we have already taken @xmath107 mev , since this is approximately the minimum that the compositeness scale can be and still give a reliable effective theory . with this choice",
    ", we find = = 1.5 10 ^ -32 . ^2 ( ) ^2 ( ) ^4 .",
    "the additional @xmath3 dependence in the cross - section that arises from the dark magnetic dipole moment tends to lower the direct detection rates at low energies .",
    "this allows lighter dm , since the main obstacle to taking dark matter to be very light is the rapidly rising spectrum at low energies in dama and cogent , ruining the fit at low recoils .",
    "the @xmath3 dependence tends to counteract this , allowing for successful models which evade the constraints of xenon10 , even taking the stochasticity into account .",
    "we have studied the implications of experimental uncertainties and non - standard velocity dependence on the agreement of cogent and dama both with each other and with the results of the null experiments . while some marginal agreement can be obtained between the two experiments when the sodium quenching factor is pushed to @xmath76 and the cdms - si energy threshold",
    "is assumed to have a systematic error of 20% ( assumed to be too low ) , optimal achievement between the two regions is not obtained for the standard spin - independent case .",
    "agreement can be improved by choosing a different velocity dependence , and in particular the magnetic dipole operator gives optimal agreement with all experiments .",
    "simple models were constructed where velocity and momentum dependent cross - sections are expected to dominate , and it was shown that acceptably large cross - sections can be obtained .    while the dama and cogent signals can be consistent with each other and the results of null experiments , large theoretical and experimental uncertainties limit our current understanding of the signals and their consistency with models .",
    "as we are learning , in an age of dm discovery , we must systematically quantify errors on theoretical and experimental parameters to determine whether a given dm model is consistent with the signals and with the results of null experiments . until these uncertainties are reduced and the low mass signals can be strongly excluded given the uncertainties",
    ", it appears the light dm candidate can not be ruled out .",
    "we look forward to further pursuing theoretically well - motivated models of low mass dm .",
    "we thank katie freese , dan hooper , brian feldstein , aaron pierce , and chris savage for discussions , and peter sorensen for help on interpreting the xenon stochasticity bound .",

    "additionally , after this work was submitted to arxiv , we became aware of a talk @xcite discussing preliminary results from a new method of analyzing xenon10 data that would allow it to probe lower recoil energies .",
