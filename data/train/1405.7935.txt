    "dark matter is dead , to begin with  at least in the sense of `` non - baryonic dark matter comprising 85% of the dynamical mass of the universe '' . a vast amount of observations collected during , especially ,",
    "the last decade has enforced the conclusion that a solution of the `` missing mass problem '' of astronomy requires a modified law of gravity @xcite .",
    "early proposals aimed at modifications of newtonian gravity beyond characteristic length scales of few kiloparsecs @xcite were unsuccessful eventually .",
    "a breakthrough was achieved by milgrom s modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ) @xcite which postulates a modification of newtonian gravity  with newtonian gravitational acceleration @xmath1  as function of acceleration ( gravitational field strength ) @xmath2 .",
    "this modification takes the form @xmath3 with @xmath4 , @xmath5 being milgrom s constant ( of the dimension of an acceleration ) , and @xmath6 denoting a transition function with the asymptotic behavior @xmath7 for @xmath8 and @xmath9 for @xmath10 .",
    "the first limiting case corresponds to the usual newtonian dynamics .",
    "the second limiting case ",
    "i.e. , @xmath11  leads to @xmath12 for stellar systems dominated by rotation ( like disk galaxies ) and @xmath13 for stellar systems dominated by random motions ( like elliptical galaxies or galaxy clusters ) @xcite ; here , @xmath14 denotes the circular speed of a particle around a luminous mass @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the three - dimensional velocity dispersion , and @xmath17 is newton s constant . the scaling laws eqs .",
    "[ eq : vc ] , [ eq : sigma ] are in excellent agreement with observations , specifically the baryonic tully  fisher @xcite and faber ",
    "jackson @xcite relations as well as the surface density  acceleration relation of disk galaxies @xcite ; these observations constrain milgrom s constant to a value of @xmath18 .    whereas the _ asymptotic _ scaling relations ( eqs .",
    "[ eq : vc ] , [ eq : sigma ] ) are well explored , the _ transitional _ regime between newtonian and modified dynamics , quantified by the function @xmath6 , is not  at least not theoretically .",
    "the functional form of @xmath6 does not follow from theory , like bekenstein s tensor  vector ",
    "scalar ( teves ) theory @xcite , in a straightforward manner ; instead , various functional relations have been assumed ad hoc for the analysis of stellar dynamics @xcite .",
    "a notable exception is provided by the analysis of @xcite : assuming that mond is the result of a modification of inertia due to vacuum effects  specifically the unruh effect ",
    "it is possible to derive the expression @xmath19 which is consistent with observations @xcite .",
    "empirically , @xmath6 is constrained the strongest by the mass discrepancy  acceleration ( mda ) relation of disk galaxies , meaning a strong anti - correlation between gravitational field strength @xmath2 and the ratio @xmath20 , with @xmath21 and @xmath15 denoting dynamical and luminous mass , respectively @xcite .",
    "any theory of modified gravity which provides a prediction of the functional form of @xmath6  and , eventually , any complete theory should do so  can be tested by comparison to the empirical mda relation in a straightforward manner .    in this article",
    "i revisit the `` graviton picture '' , a model of gravity which employs the ad - hoc assumption that gravitation is mediated by virtual particles  gravitons  with non - zero mass @xcite .",
    "this model provides ( i ) the usual mond scaling laws ( eqs .",
    "[ eq : vc ] , [ eq : sigma ] ) in the limit @xmath11 @xcite and ( ii ) a theoretical mda relation in good agreement with the observed one @xcite .",
    "the construction of any model of modified gravity begins with a census of the essential boundary conditions that need to be incorporated ; in the following , i regard a simple dynamical system composed of a luminous point - like mass @xmath15 orbited by a quasi - massless test particle with circular speed @xmath14 on a circular orbit with radius @xmath22 for reference .",
    "we can start off from two fundamental observations : ( i ) asymptotically flat rotation curves @xcite , implying with radial coordinate @xmath23 and mass profile @xmath24 leads to @xmath25 ; this is the case if , and only if , the mass density obeys @xmath26 . ]",
    "distributions of the `` missing '' mass like @xmath26 , with @xmath27 being the mass density as function of radial coordinate @xmath23 ; and ( ii ) the observation that the luminous mass is a proxy for the dynamical mass in all dynamical systems and at all scales @xcite .",
    "the latter condition demands that we find a model wherein luminous and dynamical mass  and thus the density of the `` missing mass ''  are related one - to - one .",
    "the former condition implies that the density follows an inverse - square - of - distance law . in combination ,",
    "the two conditions lead to an interesting idea : _ the extra mass behaves as if it were a radiation composed of massive particles emitted isotropically from a source mass @xmath15 .",
    "_    with this idea being formulated , we immediately see that those particles must be of a peculiar nature .",
    "firstly , the particle radiation must originate from ( or couple to ) the source mass @xmath15 without removing mass ( or energy ) from it  on the contrary , mass needs to be _ added _ to @xmath15 .",
    "secondly , these particles must be electromagnetically dark ( or `` invisible '' ) in order to escape observation .",
    "fortunately , a candidate is available : the _ graviton _ , the virtual mediator of gravitational interaction in quantum field theories @xcite .",
    "i note that , usually , gravitons are assumed to be massless , but this is not necessarily the case : consistent theoretical descriptions of gravity based on gravitons with non - zero mass can be , and have been , developed @xcite .      following up on the idea motivated in ",
    "[ sec : motivation ] , i make the following fundamental assumptions ( a ) .",
    "* gravitation is mediated by discrete exchange particles : gravitons .",
    "* gravitons are virtual particles arising from quantum fluctuations .",
    "* gravitons have a non - zero mass . *",
    "gravitational interactions are possible only between ( i ) two real masses , and ( ii ) a real mass and a graviton emitted by a real mass . especially , graviton  graviton interactions are forbidden .",
    "the assumptions a14 imply the following geometry : the mass @xmath15 is the source of virtual , massive gravitons which are radiated away isotropically .",
    "these gravitons form a spherical halo around @xmath15 with a density profile @xmath28 with @xmath29 being a factor of the dimension of an inverse length .",
    "the proportionality to @xmath15 follows from consistency with classical field theories which demand that a field strength is proportional to the source charge , with mass being the charge of gravity in our case .",
    "the proportionality to @xmath30 mirrors the inverse - square - of - distance law of radiation .",
    "when integrating @xmath27 over @xmath23 from 0 to @xmath22 while demanding that @xmath29 is not a function of the radial coordinate , the total , dynamical mass @xmath31 is given by the sum of the initial source mass and the graviton mass enclosed within @xmath22 , @xmath32 at this point , we ought to make a choice for the parameter @xmath29 which is nothing else than the inverse of a characteristic radius . for simple , circular , dynamical systems as introduced in ",
    "[ sec : motivation ] , a characteristic radius is given by the kinetic energy per unit mass of the test particle , @xmath33 , in units of a constant of the dimension of an acceleration , @xmath34 , thus suggesting the choice @xmath35 using the definition of the centripetal acceleration , @xmath36 , we eventually find @xmath37 where the deviation from the identity of luminous and dynamical mass ( i.e. , the second summand ) scales with the inverse of the centripetal acceleration .",
    "the assumption of gravitons having non - zero mass ( a3 ) implies that this mass must be very small .",
    "heisenberg s uncertainty relation @xcite for energy and time demands that the graviton mass must be small enough to permit a graviton life time on the order of the hubble time @xmath38 years  meaning a mass of less than roughly @xmath39 kg or @xmath40ev@xmath41 . due to the vast differences in particle life times ,",
    "these values are about 40 orders of magnitude lower than the masses of the exchange particles mediating the nuclear forces @xcite .",
    "evidently , any modified law of gravitation  eq .  [ eq : mdyn2 ] in our case  has to comprise the relevant limits : newtonian dynamics for @xmath42 , and modified newtonian dynamics for @xmath43 .",
    "the former case is self - evident : for @xmath42 , the second term in eq .",
    "[ eq : mdyn2 ] vanishes , leading to @xmath44 and thus removing any mass discrepancy .    in the case",

    "[ eq : mdyn2 ] becomes dominant , meaning @xmath45 . using the relations @xmath46 and @xmath36",
    ", we can bring this expression into the form @xmath47 comparison of eqs .",
    "[ eq : vc ] and [ eq : vcgrav1 ] shows that the expressions are equivalent , with milgrom s constant @xmath5 and the constant @xmath34 being related like @xmath48 .      the transitional regime between newtonian and modified newtonian dynamics is quantified by the evolution of the ratio of dynamical and luminous mass , @xmath20 , as function of gravitational acceleration ( @xmath2 or @xmath49 )  the _ mass discrepancy ",
    "acceleration relation_. the best dynamical probe is provided by disk galaxies : flattened , rotating stellar systems with the rotation dominating over random motions .",
    "dynamical masses can be derived from the stellar rotation speeds as function of galactocentric radius , luminous masses are derived from the amount of light emitted by stars and interstellar gas .",
    "disk galaxies show @xcite a strong and characteristic anti - correlation between the ratio @xmath20 and gravitational acceleration .",
    "this anti - correlation is universal  all data from all galaxies studied fall on the same curve ( within measurement uncertainties ) .",
    "i illustrate this behavior in fig .",
    "[ fig : mda ] which displays @xmath20 as function of the newtonian gravitational acceleration @xmath50 , using data from @xcite after correcting for a systematic offset @xcite",
    ".    using the relation @xmath48 , we can re - write eq .",
    "[ eq : mdyn2 ] as @xmath51 noting that @xmath52 for circular orbits and that @xmath53 , we realize that the mass discrepancy as function of acceleration is simply the inverse of @xmath6 in eq .",
    "[ eq : mond ] . indeed , the relation given by eq .",
    "[ eq : mda ] is equivalent to @xcite the empirical `` simple @xmath0 function '' of mond used for modeling galactic rotation curves @xcite as well as the mda relation @xcite .",

    "[ eq : mda ] can be identified with the _ virial mass _ of a stellar system  comprising luminous mass plus apparent phantom dark matter halo  like @xmath55 with @xmath56 , @xmath57 being the critical density of the universe , and @xmath58kms@xmath59mpc@xmath59 being hubble s constant ( e.g. , @xcite ) . by construction , the _ virial radius _",
    "@xmath60 is the radius enclosing a dynamical mass with an average density which is 200 times the critical density of the universe .",
    "comparison of eqs .",
    "[ eq : mda ] and [ eq : virialmass ] for the case @xmath61 leads to a virial radius of @xmath62 for @xmath63 , with the second equality following from eq .",
    "[ eq : vc ] .",
    "this may be compared to the newtonian expression @xmath64 .",
    "the assumption ( a3 ) that gravity is mediated by massive particles ( also referred to as _ massive gravity _ ) with limited life times is in tension with the standard assumption that the range of gravity is infinite .",
    "gravitational fields mediated by massive gravitons decay exponentially , resulting in a yukawa profile @xcite .",
    "graviton masses consistent with graviton life times ( the decay time scale ) on the order of the hubble time @xmath65 provide for a decay of gravity on cosmological scales and an apparent acceleration of the expansion of the universe  as actually observed .",
    "indeed , recent studies conclude that cosmological observations are in agreement with cosmological models based on massive gravity @xcite .    for reasons of self - consistency , i introduced the assumption ( a4 ) that gravitons do not interact with each other .",
    "a priori , mediator particles which themselves carry the charge they couple to  mass in our case  should also interact with each other , leading to substantial deviations from the classical force laws .",
    "a good example are the color charges of gluons in quantum chromodynamics which lead to the confinement of quarks @xcite .",
    "notably , the assumption that massive gravitons do not interact with each other is a common feature of massive gravity theories @xcite .      despite its success in describing galactic dynamics , the `` graviton picture ''",
    "is subjected to serious limitations .",
    "firstly , it is , a priori , non - relativistic ; the scaling relations i derive from the `` graviton picture '' ( eqs .",
    "[ eq : mdyn2 ] , [ eq : mda ] ) follow from classical field theory and classical mechanics .",
    "furthermore , the assumptions a14 are , although motivated by ongoing research efforts , ad hoc ; their consistency with quantum field theories is unclear .    secondly , the scaling law given by eq .",
    "[ eq : mda ] is probably inconsistent with the kinematics of the solar system .",
    "the relative `` extra mass '' added to the mass of the sun , i.e. , @xmath66 , is , in units of @xmath67 , 5 , 66 , and 162 for jupiter , uranus , and neptune , respectively ( using orbit data from @xcite and assuming @xmath68 ) .",
    "the observational limits ( @xmath69 upper limits ) are 2 , 18 , and 35 , respectively @xcite  meaning that the predicted values exceed the observational limits by factors up to about five .",
    "the concerns raised above indicate a failure of the `` graviton picture '' in the regime of strong  relative to @xmath5  gravitational fields . remarkably , the discrepancy between the predictions of eq .",
    "[ eq : mda ] and solar system kinematics is , although highly significant , still very small in absolute terms : in a regime where @xmath70 , the discrepancy between eq .  [",
    "eq : mda ] and the observational limits is @xmath71 .",
    "accordingly , the `` graviton picture '' provides a good approximation formula for describing the dynamics in gravitational fields with @xmath72 ranging approximately from @xmath73 ( in the outskirts of galaxies  cf .",
    "[ fig : mda ] ) to @xmath74 ( in the outer solar system ) at the very least .",
    "i revisited the `` graviton picture '' of gravitation , a model based on the ad - hoc assumption that gravitation is mediated by massive gravitons that obey certain reasonable rules of interaction .",
    "this model provides a scaling law for the ratio of dynamical and luminous mass which is in good agreement with the empirical mass discrepancy  acceleration of disk galaxies .",
    "more generally speaking , this suggests that if gravity is mediated by a massive boson in a way that preserves the limits of classical field theory , the resulting potential is mondian .",
    "eventually , i arrive at two principal conclusions .",
    "firstly , the mda relation is , arguably , the most important test for any theory of gravity in the regime of weak gravitational fields .",
    "indeed , the asymptotic relations given by eqs .",
    "[ eq : vc ] and [ eq : sigma ] derive from _ any _ law of gravity scaling with acceleration ( field strength )  meaning they are actually unable to discriminate between theories ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "any complete theory must provide for a theoretical mda relation which in turn must agree with the mda data .",
    "secondly , the `` graviton picture '' is , despite its success on galactic scales , not yet a consistent theory of gravity .",
    "however , it bears strong similarity to one of the most famous heuristic models of physics : bohr s `` planetary system '' model of the structure of atoms @xcite . even though it is obvious today that atoms are not even remotely similar to microscopic planetary systems , bohr s model provided the first successful quantitative prediction of the spectrum of hydrogen and hydrogen - like atoms",
    " an approximation satisfactory for many purposes until the present day . a similar role might , eventually , be played by the `` graviton picture '' for gravity : despite its incompleteness , the `` graviton picture '' provides a successful prediction of the empirical mda relation and thus for the dynamics of gravitationally bound systems spanning interstellar and galactic scales .",
    "this work made use of the galactic dynamics data base provided by stacy s. mcgaugh at case western reserve university , cleveland ( ohio , u.s.a . ) , and of the software package dpuser developed and maintained by thomas ott at mpe garching ( germany ) .",
