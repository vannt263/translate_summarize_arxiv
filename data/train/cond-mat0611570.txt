    "somatic gene therapy holds great promise for future medical applications , for example , as new treatment for various inherited diseases and cancers @xcite .",
    "viral vectors have been the most widely used systems for this purpose @xcite , but synthetic nonviral vectors are emerging as an attractive alternative because of their inherent advantages @xcite .",
    "these advantages include ease and variable preparation , unlimited length of the transported dna , and lack of specific immune response due to the absence of viral peptide and proteins @xcite .",
    "complexes consisting of cationic lipids ( cls ) and dna comprise one of the most promising classes of nonviral vectors .",
    "they are already used widely for _ in vitro _",
    "transfection of mammalian cells in research applications , and have even reached the stage of empirical clinical trials @xcite . currently , their efficiency of gene transfer is considerably lower than that of viral vectors @xcite .",
    "substantial improvement of their efficiency is required before cl - dna complexes become available for therapeutic purposes .",
    "cl - dna complexes are formed spontaneously when dna is mixed with cationic and natural lipids in an aqueous environment @xcite .",
    "their formation is driven by the electrostatic attraction between negatively charged dna and cationic lipid headgroups , and through the entropic gain associated with the concurrent release of the tightly bounded counterions from the cl and dna @xcite .",
    "x - ray diffraction experiments have revealed that cl - dna complexes exist in a variety of mesoscopic structures @xcite .",
    "these structures include a multilamellar phase where dna monolayers are intercalated between lipid bilayers ( @xmath4 ) @xcite , and an inverted hexagonal phase with dna encapsulated within cationic lipid monolayers tubes and arranged on a two - dimensional hexagonal lattice ( @xmath5 ) @xcite . in the more commonly observed @xmath6 phase , the dna chains form a one - dimensional lattice , where the interaxial spacing @xmath0 decreases with the charge density of the membrane .",
    "isoelectric complexes , where the charges on the dna exactly match those on the cl , are the most stable ones since they enable nearly complete counterion release @xcite . for transfection ,",
    "positively charged complexes are used , which can adhere to the negatively charged cell plasma membrane @xcite .    despite all the promise of cl - dna complexes as gene vectors , their transfection efficiency ( te ; the ability to transfer dna into cells followed by expression )",
    "remains substantially lower than that of viral vectors@xcite .",
    "this has spurred an intense research activity aimed at enhancing te @xcite .",
    "recent tragic events associated with the use of engineered adenovirus vectors have further stimulated the search for efficient synthetic dna carriers @xcite .",
    "recognizing that the structure of cl - dna complexes may strongly influence their function and te , much of the effort in theoretical and experimental studies has been devoted to understanding the mechanisms governing complex formation , structure , and phase behavior @xcite .",
    "the most widely used approach to describe the free energy of the complexes is the mean - field poisson - boltzmann equation which takes into account the electrostatic interactions of a charged continuum and the mixing entropy of the lipids and counterions @xcite .",
    "the bending energy of the lipid layer is introduced by means of the effective helfrich energy @xcite .",
    "thus , the preferred structure is determined by a delicate interplay between electrostatic interactions and bending elasticity , both depending on the molecular nature and composition of the lipids .",
    "the vast majority of neutral lipids , when complexed with cls , lead to the @xmath6 phase .",
    "addition of the neutral lipid dope ( or other pe - based lipids ) drives the spontaneous curvature negative , thereby inducing the transition to the @xmath5 phase @xcite .",
    "this transition is also promoted by addition of the cosurfactant hexanol which lowers the bilayer bending rigidity .",
    "the relationship between the physical properties and te of cl - dna complexes has been studied in a recent set of experiments utilizing a combination of several techniques ( synchrotron x - ray diffraction for structure determination , laser scanning confocal microscopy to probe the interactions of complexes with cells , and luciferase reporter - gene expression assays to measure te ) @xcite .",
    "the most notable result of these experiments is the identification of the membrane charge density , @xmath1 , as a key universal parameter that governs te of @xmath4 complexes @xcite .",
    "the highest transfection rate has been observed at intermediate @xmath1 , reaching values that are comparable to the high , @xmath1-independent , te of dope - containing @xmath7 complexes @xcite . that lamellar complexes compete the high te of hexagonal complexes is of prime importance because , as mentioned above , most commonly used lipids prefer the @xmath6 over the @xmath5 phase .",
    "moreover , with newly synthesized multivalent lipids with headgroups whose charge is as large as @xmath8 , it is possible to reach the optimal te with a fewer number of cls .",
    "this is a desirable feature which reduces the cost and , more importantly , the toxic effects of the cls .",
    "it also means a smaller metabolic effort for the elimination of the lipids from the cell .",
    "based on the above te data , as well as x - ray diffraction and laser scanning confocal microscopy imaging , a model of cellular entry of @xmath4 complexes has been proposed which suggests that the process of transfection involves two stages @xcite : ( 1 ) cellular uptake via endocytosis , and ( 2 ) escape of the complex from the endosome , presumably through the fusion of the complex with the endosomal membrane and release of the dna into the cytoplasm .",
    "the adhesion of the complex to the cell is mediated by electrostatic attraction between the positively charged complex and the negatively charged cell s plasma membrane .",
    "the transfection process is limited by the rate of the second step , which increases exponentially with @xmath1 .",
    "the independence of @xmath9 complexes te on @xmath1 ( in the low @xmath1 regime ) has been attributed to the mismatch between the _ positive _ curvature of the outermost lipid monolayer ( which provides the complex with hydrophobic shielding ) and the complex _ negative _ spontaneous curvature .",
    "this elastically frustrated state drives , independently of @xmath1 , the rapid fusion of the @xmath5 complex with the plasma or endosomal membrane .",
    "lamellar complexes with very high @xmath1 also exhibit reduced te which should be attributed to the inability of the dna to dissociate from the highly charged membranes ( of the free complex ) and to become available for expression @xcite .",
    "theoretical modeling of large molecular assemblies pose significant challenges due to the spatial complexity of such systems and by the range of temporal scales involved . in the case of cl - dna complexes ,",
    "the size of the complex may be as large as @xmath10 , while the basic unit cell of the @xmath4 complex is in the nanometer range ( the dna spacing is typically @xmath11 , and the inter - layer spacing @xmath12 ) . since both short- ( steric , hydrophobic ) , and long - range ( electrostatic ) interactions determine the physical and biomedical properties of cl - dna complexes , it is essential that these systems will be studied at all possible levels of detail .",
    "moreover , phase transitions of cl - dna complexes as well as other topological changes ( e.g. , membrane fusion which occurs during transfection ) involves the collective motion of many lipid molecules and , therefore , inherently take place on a variety of spatial and temporal scales .    to address the multi - scale nature of cl - dna complexes , a variety of models , differing in the length and the time scales of the phenomena of interest have been devised . at the microscopic molecular level",
    ", we have atomistic molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations in which the lipids , dna , and the embedding solvent are modeled explicitly in full ( classical ) atomic detail @xcite .",
    "these simulations provide valuable information regarding the molecular structure of the complexes , such as the role played by the neutral pc headgroups ( more specifically , the @xmath13 end of the @xmath14 dipole ) in the screening of the electrostatic repulsion between the dna chains .",
    "the length and time scales of atomistic simulations are limited by memory and cpu requirement to several nanometers and nanoseconds , which is far below the macroscopic regime encompassing the statistics and evolution of large molecular ensembles . at the macroscopic level ,",
    "only the continuum behavior of existing cl - dna structures can be addressed based on free energy functionals which are insensitive to the fine details of the lipids and dna @xcite .",
    "electrostatic screening effects between the dna chains resulting from _ non - specific _ interactions between the lipids and dna have been reported in these studies .",
    "this observation is complementary to the specific mechanisms observed in detailed atomistic computer models .    in this paper",
    "we present an `` intermediate '' molecular modeling approach that retains the most essential components of self - assembly and molecular statistics , but avoids the computational overhead of a full atomistic model .",
    "the model @xcite extends an existing coarse - grained ( cg ) molecular bilayer model @xcite by including both charged and neutral lipids , as well as charged dna molecules .",
    "the inter - molecular potentials between different molecular species are designed to mimic the hydrophobic effect _ without _ the explicit presence of solvent .",
    "thus , the approach carefully balances the need for molecular detail with computational practicality in a manner that allows for solvent - free simulations of complex self - assembly over long enough time scales to address experimental reality .",
    "in addition to showing spontaneous self - assembly of cl - dna complexes , we also investigate the structural properties of lamellar complexes and measure a number of important quantities such as the dependence of the interaxial distance between dna chains on the fraction of charged lipids , the polarization of the cationic charge distribution , local area density fluctuations , and the effective two - dimensional stretching elastic modulus , @xmath15 .",
    "some of these quantities are not easily accessible to theoretical continuum models and may require further approximations .",
    "one of the more interesting results is the decrease in @xmath15 upon increasing the membrane charge density @xmath1 , which reflects reduced mechanical stability and a higher probability of structural defects , such as membrane pores .",
    "the observations of such pores is consistent with the experimental findings of enhanced transfection efficiencies at high concentration of cls , because pores must be formed to enable the escape of the dna from the complex ( see discussion above ) .",
    "it demonstrates the utility of cg modeling in addressing some key features of complex biological systems in general , and lipid - dna assemblies in particular .",
    "we focus on isoelectric lamellar complexes in which the total charges carried by the cls and dna are equal .",
    "the mechanism of counterion release is most effective at this point , making the free energy of the complex minimal @xcite .",
    "the counterions concentrations inside the complex depend on their bulk concentrations . here",
    ", we study the very low bulk concentration limit in which the counterions are ( almost ) completely depleted from the complex .",
    "this regime has been previously addressed in atomistic computer simulations of cl - dna complexes @xcite .",
    "counterions effects have been dealt with in the framework of continuum poisson - boltzmann ( pb ) theory @xcite .",
    "while this approach captures certain features of the charge distribution and the electric fields in the complex , it neglects several important factors such as the discrete nature of the ions and their finite sizes , which may govern their distribution in the gaps of ( sub)nanometer dimensions that exist between the membranes and the dna . treating the water in these tiny voids as a bulk medium of effective dielectric constant @xmath16 and neglecting dehydration effects are other gross approximations made by most current modeling techniques .",
    "we use a continuum model to analyze some of the simulation results .",
    "our analytical study is based on the minimization of a phenomenological free energy functional with respect to the profile of the membrane and the cationic charge distribution .",
    "this free energy includes contributions from all the electrostatic interactions existing between the lipids and the ( infinite array of ) dna molecules , as well as terms associated with the mixing entropy and ( small length scale ) protrusion modes @xcite of lipids .",
    "we show , both computationally and analytically , that the cationic charge distribution is polarized .",
    "the minimum of the charge density is obtained halfway between adjacent dna molecules while the maximum is not reached right above the dna , but is slightly shifted .",
    "the origin of this shift is the ability of the lipids not located right above the dna to protrude and thus position their charged headgroups in regions of the complex where the electrostatic potential created by the dna array is lower .",
    "interestingly , we find that the charge density in the immediate vicinity of the dna tends to match effective area charge density of the dna rod",
    ". charge matching between narrowly separated surfaces has been observed in previous studies of cl - dna complexes @xcite , as well as in studies of other molecular assemblies @xcite .",
    "it has been attributed to the increased concentration of ions which are bound to remain in the confined volume between surfaces in order to neutralize the system .",
    "charge matching is favorable because it enables the release of these strongly confined ions .",
    "our study , which is based on an ion - free model , suggests that charge matching can be also driven by other mechanisms .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section we present our cg model of cl - dna complexes and provide most of the details of the simulations ( except for the details of a new monte carlo ( mc ) scheme that we use to sample the constant tension ensemble , which we introduce in appendix [ appendix : surfacetension ] ) .",
    "the results of our simulations are described in the two following sections dealing , respectively , with the dependence of the dna spacing and the complex stability on the charge density , and the charge density fluctuations .",
    "the computational results are compared to the predictions of a analytical continuum model in appendix [ appendix : analytical ] .",
    "we close the paper with a brief discussion of the main results and an outline of some future prospects .",
    "the computer model of cl - dna complex is based on a bilayer cg model presented elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the lipids are modeled as short trimer molecules consisting of one `` hydrophilic '' and two `` hydrophobic '' beads which are connected to each other by stiff linear springs @xcite",
    ". the model does not include explicit solvent .",
    "rather , a set of short - range attractive intermolecular potentials is used , which effectively mimic hydrophobicity and allow self - assembly of bilayer from molecular disorder @xcite .",
    "depending on the area density of the lipids , the bilayer is found in either a solid or a fluid phase @xcite , where the latter is characterized by an in - plane lipid diffusion and out - of - plane fluctuations whose spectrum is well depicted by helfrich effective hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "the model of the cl - dna complex is obtained by : ( 1 ) choosing a fraction @xmath2 of the lipids and placing a unit ( point ) charge @xmath17 at the centers of their hydrophilic bead .",
    "( 2 ) introducing dna molecules , each of which is modeled as a rigid rod with a uniform axial charge density @xmath18  and radius @xmath19 .",
    "the diameter of the spherical particles constituting the lipids is set to @xmath20  ( see definition of @xmath21 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , which yields an area per lipid @xmath22@xmath23 for uncharged bilayers . excluded volume interactions between rods ( r ) and spheres ( s ) are introduced via a truncated ( at @xmath24 ) and shifted potential of the form : @xmath25^{12 } -1\\right\\}$ ] , where @xmath26 is the distance between the center of the sphere and the axis of symmetry of the rod .",
    "the distance between nearest - neighbor rods is restricted to @xmath27 .",
    "modeling the dna strands as infinite rods carrying uniform charge density @xmath28 is consistent with the cg approach of the model , where only electrostatics , noise , and simple geometric features are retained . in this representation of dna molecules",
    "we ignore the effects associated with their ( 1 ) flexibility and ( 2 ) the discrete nature of their charge distribution .",
    "the first approximation is justified in view of the fact that the dna persistence length ( @xmath29 ) is an order of magnitude larger than all the other relevant length scales in the problem .",
    "curvature fluctuations involve free energy penalty of about @xmath30 per @xmath31 of dna length , which is negligible compared to the complex stabilization free energy of @xmath32 per persistence length @xcite .",
    "the second approximation is supported by numerical studies revealing that the electrostatic potential around the dna surface is not much different from that produced by the continuous charge density , except for a narrow regime in its immediate vicinity @xcite .",
    "we study isoelectric complexes where the total charges of the dna and the cls neutralize each other , with no added counterions .",
    "simulations of the quasi two - dimensional ( 2d ) complex are conducted in a rectangular system of size @xmath33 , with full periodic boundaries along the @xmath34 and @xmath35 directions , and periodicity with respect to only lipid mobility and short - range interactions in the @xmath36 direction .",
    "the simulations were performed at room temperature and with a bulk water uniform dielectric constant @xmath16 .",
    "the rods are arranged in a 1d array , parallel to the @xmath35 axis and with equal spacing along the @xmath34-direction .",
    "long range electrostatic interactions between the charged spheres , infinite rods , and their periodic images were accounted for using the lekner summation method @xcite .",
    "the electrostatic potential energy , per simulation cell , between a cl whose charged headgroup is located at @xmath37 and another cl and its replicas located at @xmath38 , where @xmath39 are integers , is given by the exponentially convergent summation of , e.g. , the form : @xmath40\\nonumber \\\\ & -&\\left.\\frac{1}{l_x}\\ln\\left[\\cosh\\left(2\\pi\\frac{\\delta z}{l_y}\\right ) -\\cos\\left(2\\pi\\frac{\\delta y}{l_y}\\right)\\right]^{2}-\\frac{\\ln 2}{l_x } \\right\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 is the modified bessel function of order @xmath42 .",
    "the self - energy @xmath43 that arises from a charged sphere with its own periodic images is found by evaluating the expression @xmath44 and is given in ref .",
    "the sphere - rod electrostatic energy per simulation cell is the combined logarithmic interactions between a point charge and a 1d array of line charges .",
    "it is given by @xcite @xmath45\\right\\}. \\label{eq : sphererod}\\ ] ] the rod - rod electrostatic self - energy is @xcite @xmath46    simulations of electrostatics in water - free models are usually conducted with a uniform dielectric constant due to the complexity of including mirror charges in a disordered molecular ensemble . in pb theories",
    "@xcite a different type of boundary conditions ( bcs ) is usually assumed , namely that the dielectric constant vanishes in the interior of the dna and the lipid membrane .",
    "this latter approximation is justified by the fact that the ( bulk ) water dielectric constant , @xmath16 , is much larger than all the other relevant dielectric constants .",
    "the electric field lines prefer to stay in high dielectric media and the limit @xmath47 corresponds to systems in which the electric field is entirely contained within the aqueous part .",
    "fortunately , the exclusion of electric fields from the dna and the membranes is not solely related to their low dielectric constants . in our simulations",
    ", it is mainly a matter of the geometry and the charge distribution in the system .",
    "therefore , the electrostatic forces , through which the charges in water interact with each other , are expected to be insensitive to the dielectric constants of the dna and the membranes .",
    "computational studies @xcite of electrostatics near similar simple geometric interfaces indicate that the net effect of mirror images is , indeed , minor .",
    "this observation also serves as a justification for our choice of bcs . rather than using full periodic bcs in all three directions , we study an infinite `` slab '' consisting of a single array of charged dna molecules and two bilayers ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : complex1 ] ) , in which only the inner monolayers ( facing the dna rods ) are charged while the outer monolayers consist of neutral lipids only .",
    "the interaction between different slabs ( whose overall net charge is neutral ) is well screened and is significantly weaker than the coulomb interactions between the charged components within each slab .    in a preceding publication @xcite",
    ", we have shown that complexes such as the one appearing in fig .",
    "[ fig : complex1 ] are formed spontaneously in simulations starting from a disordered initial state where the lipids are randomly distributed within the simulation cell .",
    "this demonstrates that the complex represents a stable equilibrium phase of the system . in this work",
    "we focus on structural properties of cl - dna complexes and use pre - assembled complexes for this purpose .",
    "the simulations were performed at constant surface tension @xmath48 by employing a new sampling scheme to generate area - changing trial moves .",
    "the sampling scheme , which is different from the commonly used method of sampling the @xmath49 ensemble @xcite , is described in detail in appendix [ appendix : surfacetension ] .",
    "the rest of the details of the simulations appear in ref .  @xcite .",
    "measuring the dna interaxial spacing , @xmath0 , serves as a critical test to our model s ability to mimic the mesoscale behavior of cl - dna complexes , because @xmath0 can be measured in x - ray diffraction experiments .",
    "the experimental data of safinya et al .",
    "@xcite shows that for isoelectric complexes , the dependence of @xmath0 on the membrane charge density @xmath50 is governed by the relationship @xcite @xmath51 which results from simple mass conservation in the lamellar geometry .    the computational results for the average spacing between adjacent dna rods , @xmath0 ,",
    "are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : ddna ] as a function of the inverse of the fraction of charged lipids , @xmath52 .",
    "the solid line is a fit to eq .",
    "( [ eq : ddna ] ) with @xmath53@xmath23 which is the area per lipid in uncharged membranes .",
    "the deviation from linear behavior at high charge densities arises from the increase in @xmath54 with @xmath2 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : lipidarea ] ) .",
    "the numerical data is in excellent agreement with the experimental results reported in ref .",
    "specifically , the experimental @xmath55 vs.  @xmath2 data [ see fig .  4 ( b ) in ref .",
    "@xcite ] show agreement with eq .",
    "( [ eq : ddna ] ) at low charge densities ( with a value of @xmath54 which is slightly different than the one defined here ) and a similar deviation trend at high charge densities ( note that our eq .",
    "( [ eq : ddna ] ) and the comparable one in ref.@xcite express the same relationship in different forms . see discussion in @xcite . ) the assumption underlying eq .",
    "( [ eq : ddna ] ) is that the effective interactions between the dna are repulsive and balanced by the elastic membrane forces .",
    "linear elastic stress acting on a membrane is related to @xmath54 and its equilibrium value @xmath56 by @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the 2d stretching modulus , which for lipid bilayers is typically in the range @xmath59 . at high charge densities ,",
    "the electrostatic stress is sufficiently large to eliminate the membrane thermal undulations and increase @xmath54 @xcite . in the present study",
    ", we find for complexes with @xmath60 that the strain @xmath61 , which is somewhat larger than the typical strain lipid bilayers withstand before rupture ( @xmath62 , @xcite ) .",
    "the discrepancy between experimentally observed rupture strains and the strain found in our model is not surprising given the coarse grained lipid - model of simple three point objects .",
    "it may also be partially attributed to the system size dependence of the rupture strain @xcite .",
    "membranes with higher @xmath2 have indeed been found to be susceptible to pore formation , as illustrated by the configuration in fig .",
    "[ fig : porecomplex ] of a complex with @xmath63 .",
    "the loss of mechanical stability is also evident from the rapid decrease in the effective stretching modulus of the complex @xmath64 for @xmath65 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : modulus ] ) , which has been extracted from the mean square of fluctuations in @xmath54 : @xmath66 $ ] .",
    "the larger area fluctuations at high @xmath2 increase the probability of pore opening which in turn may lead to disassociation of the complex .",
    "it is interesting to compare the inter - dna electrostatic interactions in the complex with the same interactions in bulk in the presence of monovalent counterions @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "the bare electrostatic repulsion is screened by the distribution of microions and cls around the dna . in the complex , the distribution of the cationic charge is limited by a geometric constraint , namely the residence of the cls on the membrane surface which maintains a finite separation from the inter - dna plane .",
    "therefore , we expect that screening to be less efficient than in bulk solutions . it is also reasonable to expect that , compared to 3d systems , the confinement to a surface increases the repulsive electrostatic interactions between the cationic charges which further increases the magnitude of the effective inter - dna repulsive force .    since our model does not include water explicitly , the hydration forces which may be significant at small @xmath0 are missing from the picture @xcite .",
    "this can be corrected either by introducing an additional short range dna - dna potential that explicitly account for the hydration free energy or assuming that @xmath67 represents the hydrated rather than the bare dna radius .",
    "since the hydration forces decay on dna - dna surface separations of more then @xmath68 1 nm , their introduction into the model will only modify the results at small @xmath0 ( large @xmath2 ) .",
    "specifically , this will increase the effective dna - dna repulsion and , therefore , will strengthen the trend observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : ddna ] that at high charge densities eq .",
    "( [ eq : ddna ] ) underestimates @xmath0 .",
    "it will also shift the limit of mechanical stability to slightly lower charge densities .",
    "another feature missing in our model is the contribution of dna bending fluctuations to the inter - dna interaction .",
    "the effect of these fluctuations in bulk is to increase the decay length of both hydration and electrostatic forces @xcite .",
    "one may expect a similar contribution to inter - dna interactions in cl - dna complexes , although we are unaware of any systematic study of this effect in 2d .",
    "x - ray studies find weak positional disorder in cl - dna complexes .",
    "the typical correlated domain size of the 1d lattice of dna extends to nearly 10 unit cells @xcite , which is twice as large than the size of the complex in our simulations .",
    "our computational results explain well the recently observed enhanced te of lamellar cl - dna complexes at high charge densities @xcite .",
    "the limiting stage of the transfection process is the escape of the complex from the endosome in which it is initially trapped after entering the cell .",
    "escape from the endosome occurs through activated fusion of the complex and endosomal membranes , during which both must be perforated .",
    "having a complex with poor mechanical stability is an advantage at this stage , since such a complex will tend to open pores more easily , and through these pores the dna may be released to the cytoplasm .",
    "we suggest that the loss of mechanical stability results from the cationic charge of the lipids and the pressure which it exerts on the complex membrane . at high charge densities",
    "this pressure exceeds the rupture tension of the membrane and , thus , leads to mechanical failure of the complex .",
    "the quantity defined as @xmath2 represents the _",
    "mean _ number fraction of charge lipids .",
    "however , the lateral distribution of cationic charge on the membranes need not be uniform .",
    "one may expect the cls to accumulate above and below the negatively charged dna rods .",
    "this tendency to minimize the electrostatic energy of the cls - dna interactions is competed by the thermally induced mixing entropy and the repulsive electrostatic interactions between the cls , which favor homogeneous composition of the cationic and neutral lipids .",
    "furthermore , charge density modulations may be coupled to membrane undulations @xcite , and both can contribute to lowering the free energy of the complex . as discussed above , the stability of the complex is directly related to its te and , therefore , it is important to study the effect of these `` degrees of freedom '' of the lipids .    the dependence of @xmath2 on @xmath34 , the position within a unit cell of the complex ( i.e. , the interval between adjacent dna rods ) is depicted in fig .  [",
    "fig : fraction ] , where @xmath69 and @xmath70 correspond to lipids located right above or below the dna ( see inset of fig .  [",
    "fig : fraction ] ) .",
    "the curves , from bottom to top , are for the following value of the mean number fraction : @xmath71 .",
    "as expected , we find that for all values of @xmath2 , the minimum of @xmath72 is achieved for @xmath73 , i.e. , in the middle of the unit cell .",
    "the minimum is more pronounced for low values of @xmath2 , in which case the maximum of @xmath72 is at @xmath69 and @xmath70 . at the higher values of @xmath2 , the maximum shifts from the edge of the unit cell towards the center and , in general , the fluctuations in @xmath72 become quite small .",
    "the shift in the maximum of @xmath72 from the immediate vicinity of the dna towards the center of the cell has been previously reported in theoretical studies of the system based on pb theory @xcite .",
    "it has been attributed to the tendency of the system to match the areal charge density of the membrane with the effective areal charge density of the dna , @xmath74@xmath23 .",
    "this involves attraction of cls towards the dna at low values of @xmath2 and significant charge modulation over the relatively large distance between the dna rods . on the other hand , when @xmath2 is large and @xmath0 is small , the charge density fluctuations are weak and cls must be depleted from above / below the dna to match the local charge density of the dna .",
    "the tendency to match the local charge densities of the membranes with @xmath75 is seen more clearly in fig .",
    "[ fig : chargedensity ] . here , the charge density @xmath76 rather than @xmath72 is plotted as a function of @xmath34 .",
    "the dashed horizontal line corresponds to the effective charge density of the dna @xmath77@xmath23 .",
    "the graphs show that for all values of @xmath2 , the local charge density at the edge of the unit cell remains within @xmath78 of @xmath75 .",
    "more interestingly , the graphs show that in contrast to @xmath72 , the maximum of @xmath79 is always shifted from the dna towards the center of the unit cell .",
    "this observation deserves some special comment : in most analytical studies of membranes , area density fluctuations are neglected ( or , rather , it is assumed that the local area per lipid @xmath80 is constant ) and , therefore , @xmath72 and @xmath81 are proportional to each other .",
    "our computational results indicate that area density fluctuations ( see fig .  [ fig : areadensity ] ) may be quite important and serve as an additional degree of freedom that further reduces the free energy of the system . in fig .",
    "[ fig : areadensity ] , @xmath82@xmath83 denotes the area density of uncharged membranes . for large @xmath2 , @xmath84 for",
    "all values of @xmath34 , reflecting the fact the _ mean _ area per lipid increases at high charge densities ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : lipidarea ] and discussion above ) .",
    "more noticeable are the area density fluctuations within the unit cell which can be observed for all values of @xmath2 .",
    "the location of the maximum area density coincides with that of the maximum charge density and , therefore , can be attributed to the accumulation of charged lipids .",
    "had the area density been constant , this would mean depletion of the neutral lipids from the same region in the unit cell .",

    "two comments should be made regarding the solution of the pb equation : first , the screening of the electrostatic interactions by the highly confined counterions is probably overestimated by continuum pb theory because the slithering of counterions into the small gaps will be hindered both dynamically ( excluded volume ) and thermodynamically ( dehydration ) .",
    "second , our simulations of isoelectric complexes with no counterions apply to the no - screening limit where this effect is not expected to occur .",

    "we have presented a molecular simulation method which captures the self - assembly of cationic liposomes complexed with dna - a promising synthetically based nonviral carrier of dna for gene therapy .",
    "the method is an intermediate modeling approach between atomistic computer simulations and continuum phenomenological theories . like the former",
    ", it utilizes a molecular description of the system ; but similarly to the latter , it employs a coarse - grained ( cg ) representation of the intra - molecular atomic details . the reduced number of degrees of freedom , as well as the fact that the model does not require explicit representation of the embedding solvent , lead to a significant improvement in computational efficiency .",
    "thus , the approach carefully balances the need for molecular detail with computational practicality in a manner that allows for solvent - free simulations of complex self - assembly over long enough time scales to address experimental reality .",
    "in addition to showing spontaneous self - assembly of cationic lipid - dna complexes , the broad utility of the model is illustrated by demonstrating excellent agreement with x - ray diffraction experimental data for the dependence of the interaxial distance between dna chains , @xmath0 , on the fraction of charged lipids @xmath2 .",
    "specifically , we find that @xmath0 is inversely proportional to @xmath2 - a relationship which can be also derived by a simple packing argument where the dna rods form a space - filling 1d lattice .",
    "this result is indicative of a repulsive long - range inter - dna interaction .",
    "the predominant contribution to this interaction is due to _ non - specific _ electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged dna rods , which is only partially screened by the cationic charge on the membranes .",
    "we note that the magnitude of the repulsive interaction plays no role in the packing argument .",
    "therefore , a linear relationship between @xmath0 and @xmath3 is predicted by both our cg simulations and the pb theory , despite of the fact that in the pb treatment the screening of inter - dna repulsion is also due to the counterions presented in the complex .",
    "certain features of cl - dna complexes , for instance the process of self - assembly and structural defects ( fig .",
    "[ fig : porecomplex ] ) , can be addressed more effectively through cg simulations rather than by continuum theories of existing structures .",
    "this point is nicely demonstrated by our simulations of highly - charged complexes . upon increasing the fraction of the cls",
    ", we find that : ( 1 ) the area per lipid increases , ( 2 ) the effective stretching modulus of the complex decreases , and ( 3 ) the rate of pore formation increases which eventually leads to the disintegration of the complex .",
    "all together , these results indicate that the higher the charge density of the membranes the lower the mechanical stability of the system .",
    "this is a key observation which may explain the recently observed enhanced transfection efficiency ( te ) of lamellar cl - dna complexes at high charge densities .",
    "transfection is viewed as a two - stage process : ( 1 ) cellular uptake via endocytosis , and ( 2 ) escape of the complex from the endosome , presumably through fusion of the lipids with the endosomal membrane and release of the dna into the cytoplasm . te of lamellar complexes is limited by the rate of the second stage and , hence , increases with the decrease of mechanical stability , i.e. , with increase of charge density .",
    "given the consistency of agreement between our cg molecular approach and observed experimental features , we suggest that the presented model is an appropriate and promising tool for investigating the statistics and dynamics of lipid - dna complexes on spatial and temporal scales relevant for biological and biomedical applications . in future work",

    "a special effort will be made to develop a model for the inverted hexagonal ( @xmath5 ) structure , and to examine the mechanical behavior of this phase , which appears to be experimentally quite distinct from the behavior of the lamellar phase .",
    "we will also investigate the effect of counterions which must be presented in the positively charged complexes that adhere to the negatively charged cell membrane ( at the initial stage of the transfection process ) .",
    "the model may be also extended to include some features of the dna helical structure .",
    "these more advanced models may lead to a better understanding of the principles governing the statistical - mechanical behavior of cl - dna complexes , which is crucial for systematic and successful design of efficient synthetic vectors for gene therapy .",

    "however , in computer simulations it is difficult to sample an ensemble where @xmath118 is constant since @xmath119 can not be easily controlled and , moreover , its value is not well defined ( in contrast to continuum models ) .",

    "let us also assume that the particle with index `` 1 '' resides on the interface .",

    "<S> this last result , together with other findings such as the decrease in the effective stretching modulus of the complex and the increased rate at which pores are formed in the complex membranes , are indicative of the gradual loss of mechanical stability of the complex which occurs when @xmath2 becomes large . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that this may be the origin of the recently observed enhanced transfection efficiency of lamellar cl - dna complexes at high charge densities , because the completion of the transfection process requires the disassembly of the complex and the release of the dna into the cytoplasm . </S>",
    "<S> some of the structural properties of the system are also predicted by a continuum free energy minimization . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis , which semi - quantitatively agrees with the computational results , shows that that mesoscale physical behavior of cl - dna complexes is governed by an interplay between electrostatic , elastic , and mixing free energies . </S>"
