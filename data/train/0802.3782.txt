    "within the last two decades , effective field theory ( eft ) has provided new methods for nuclear structure investigations . both two- and three - nucleon interactions based on the most general chiral effective pion - nucleon lagrangian have been developed utilizing weinberg s power counting scheme .",
    "the phase shifts of the nucleon - nucleon interaction below the pion production threshold are reproduced with a precision that is comparable with the one achieved by modern phenomenological two - nucleon potentials , when pushing the expansion to the order n@xmath3lo , see refs.@xcite .",
    "these forces together with three - nucleon forces at n@xmath4lo have been applied to a cornucopia of reactions . in particular ,",
    "a good description of most of the low - energy nucleon - deuteron scattering observables at order n@xmath4lo has been reported .",
    "the binding energies of @xmath3he and @xmath5he are also correctly reproduced once the leading three - nucleon force is included . within the framework of the no - core shell model , the chiral forces have been used to study nuclei with @xmath6 systems , in particular the sensitivity to the three - nucleon force . for details , see @xcite .",
    "recent progress along these lines is reviewed in ref .",
    "@xcite . given these successes",
    ", the question arises whether chiral effective field theory can contribute to the solution of the nuclear matter problem .",
    "first attempts in this direction have been done by the munich group , see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ( and references therein ) which concentrates on the development of a chiral effective interaction to be used exclusively in the nuclear medium without link to the two - nucleon interaction in the vacuum . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "nuclear matter has been studied with a low - momentum two - nucleon force @xmath7 derived from the argonne @xmath8 potential via renormalization group techniques .",
    "it was found that the low - momentum interactions can be used in second - order perturbation theory to describe nuclear matter provided pauli blocking effects due to the medium are properly included .",
    "this approach was recently extended to the @xmath9 versions of the chiral n@xmath3lo potentials  @xcite .",
    "note , however , that while the chiral three - body force at n@xmath4lo has been taken into account , its running down to low momenta has not been considered .    in the present communication ,",
    "we apply the n@xmath4lo version of the chiral nucleon - nucleon interaction to nuclear matter .",
    "we use chiral nuclear effective field theory because it gives a systematic connection between the two- and many - nucleon forces in each order of the chiral expansion , as reviewed in ref .",
    "we also compare with two other recent approaches to nuclear matter based on lo versions of the two - nucleon interactions  @xcite .",

    "the pion - nucleon vertices are systematically taken from the chiral expansion of the pion - nucleon interaction which provide the direct link to the spontaneously broken chiral symmetry of qcd . in the present calculations ,",
    "we adopt the values ( in units of gev@xmath12 ) @xmath13 employed in ref.@xcite which enter the long - range part of the two- and three - nucleon force .",
    "the two - nucleon interaction is generated by eliminating the pion - two - nucleon space via the time - honored projection method of fukuda , sawada , taketani , and okubo  @xcite .",
    "a discussion of the sensitivity of the observables to the cutoffs can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite where , in particular , the error bands for the phase shifts are shown .",
    "the phenomenological two - nucleon interactions of the 1950 s such as e.g.  the reid potential  @xcite could not be used in perturbative approaches to nuclear matter because a strong repulsion at short distances between the interacting nucleons was required to reproduce the empirical s - wave phase shifts .",
    "brueckner proposed an effective two - nucleon interaction , commonly called the g - matrix , which allows to perform perturbative calculations of nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "nuclear matter calculations within the brueckner theory based on phase shift equivalent potentials yield the well - known coester band  @xcite which does not pass through the empirical saturation energy @xmath14mev at the fermi momentum @xmath15",
    ". theoretical efforts to include the effect of three - nucleon correlations show that three - nucleon correlations by themselves do not suffice to solve the nuclear matter problem , see e.g. refs.@xcite . the necessity to incorporate three nucleon interactions in a theory of nuclear matter",
    "was realized subsequently , see ref.@xcite , but progress was made difficult by the limited experimental information about three - nucleon interactions .    in 1971 , baker criticized brueckner theory . in order to obtain a well - defined analytical structure of the energy function",
    ", he rearranged the energy series in powers of the r - matrix which is the solution of the lippmann - schwinger integral equation for nucleon - nucleon scattering incorporating pauli blocking of the intermediate states due to the nuclear medium  @xcite .",
    "while baker has illustrated his formalism using a two - nucleon interaction consisting of a short - range hard core and a medium - range constant attractive potential , we want to operate with the interactions derived in effective field theory .",
    "our calculations proceed in three steps :    ( i )   the r - matrix is obtained by solving the lippmann - schwinger equation in a partial wave representation , using the matrix inversion method of haftel and tabakin  @xcite : @xmath16 the angular momentum @xmath17 , the spin @xmath18 , and the isospin @xmath19 are combined into the index @xmath20 , while the orbital angular momenta in the initial and final state are denoted by @xmath21 , and @xmath22 , respectively .",

    "for comparison , let us discuss some earlier determination of these quantities .",
    "bethe employed the semi - empirical mass formula for finite nuclei by myers and swiatecki  @xcite to obtain the binding energy of nuclear matter and estimated the fermi momentum using the central density of finite nuclei and the argument that the surface tension is balanced by the coulomb pressure  @xcite ( downward ( blue ) triangle ) . a more detailed treatment of the coulomb force is made by microscopic calculations employing empirical interactions which need approximately ten parameters to reproduce both the binding energies and the charge distributions of finite nuclei .",
    "the review by bender , heenen , and reinhard  @xcite discusses the merits of the various types of phenomenological interactions which have been adjusted to reproduce the binding energies and radii of finite nuclei as accurately as possible .",
    "the corresponding predictions for the saturation of nuclear matter are summarized by the blue squares .",
    "a ( blue ) dashed ellipse has been added to guide the eye .",

    "finds that the saturation points obtained by the present calculation based on the n@xmath4lo interaction ( circles ) overlap with the empirical ones .",
    "there is a dependence on the regulators @xmath11 and @xmath79 which leads to an uncertainty of the binding energy per particle of approximately 0.6  mev , while the fermi momenta scatter within an interval of @xmath80 .",
    "the magnitude of this uncertainty is comparable to the uncertainty due to the different types of empirical interactions , however .",
    "there is another uncertainty due to the three - nucleon interaction . in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] , we compare the saturation point of nuclear matter obtained using only the longest range part of the three - nucleon interaction ( square , obtained with @xmath81 and @xmath82 ) with the result of the full calculation . the corresponding binding energy , e / a = @xmath83mev , and the fermi momentum @xmath84  @xmath2 are in the vicinity of the empirical saturation area .",
    "in order to show the sensitivity to the short range contributions , we have varied the value of @xmath60 in the range from @xmath85 to @xmath86 for @xmath82 and @xmath87 to @xmath88 for @xmath89 .",
    "these ranges are consistent with determinations of the lecs from few - nucleon reactions , see  ref .  @xcite .",
    "we find that the empirical saturation area can be approached with relatively small values of both @xmath61 and @xmath60 which suggests that effective field theory applied to nuclear matter converges reasonably fast . the uncertainty inherent in the two - nucleon interaction at order n@xmath4lo is comparable to what is obtained in a systematic comparison of high quality fits of more phenomenological interactions , see ref .",
    "therefore a detailed fine - tuning of the low energy constants @xmath60 and @xmath61 is not necessary .",
    "the role of the delta - isobar in the description of nuclear matter based on chiral dynamics was stressed in ref .",
