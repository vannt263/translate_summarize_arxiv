    "ross , schulze , and whiteley @xcite have studied the problem we do here , but they do not give any combinatorial characterizations . borcea and streinu @xcite have proposed a kind of `` doubly generic '' periodic rigidity , where the combinatorial model does not include the colors on the quotient graph .",
