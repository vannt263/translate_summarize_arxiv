    "determining the neutrino mass is one of the great unsolved problems of modern particle physics .",
    "the standard model contains three massless neutrino species ; observations of neutrino oscillations in atmospheric and solar neutrino experiments have confirmed that neutrinos are massive , but can not pin down their absolute mass scale .",
    "fortunately , the universe offers a new laboratory for neutrino physics .",
    "massive neutrinos affect both the background expansion and the growth of cosmological structure , making cosmological observations an unrivaled probe of the total neutrino mass @xcite .",
    "the redshift at which massive neutrinos become non - relativistic alters the time since matter - radiation equality , thus changing the position of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy peaks .",
    "measurements of the cmb have used this effect to find @xmath8ev ( 95% c.l . )",
    "@xcite , and a sensitivity of @xmath9ev could soon be achieved with the planck satellite ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "massive neutrinos also play a role in the formation of large scale structure .",
    "once non - relativistic , they damp the growth of perturbations within their free streaming scale , resulting in a suppression of the small - scale linear matter power spectrum of @xmath10 @xcite . measurements of the matter power spectrum can thus improve constraints on the neutrino mass considerably .",
    "many analyses have been performed combining cmb data with large scale structure ( lss ) probes such as the 2df galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ) @xcite , the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite , wigglez @xcite and the sdss lyman-@xmath11 forest @xcite to constrain @xmath1 .",
    "the combination of the sdss dr8 lrg angular power spectra , wmap7 data and an hst prior on the hubble constant gives @xmath12ev ( 95% c.l . ) , assuming a flat @xmath13cdm model with the standard model effective number of neutrino species , @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "a detection of @xmath15 , as recently hinted at by the atacama cosmology telescope ( act ) and the south pole telescope ( spt ) experiments @xcite , would imply additional relativistic relics or non - standard neutrino properties . the additional energy density of extra relativistic particle species would change the redshift of matter - radiation equality , leaving imprints on the cmb anisotropies and matter power spectrum .",
    "parameter degeneracies limit the constraining power of the primary cmb anisotropies on @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "the 95% lower limit is @xmath17 from wmap7 alone @xcite . adding information on the matter power spectrum and the hubble constant",
    "can tighten the constraint significantly @xcite , as can measurements of smaller scale cmb fluctuations .    in this work ,",
    "we introduce new constraints from measurements of the angular power spectrum of galaxies at @xmath18 in the canada - france - hawaii - telescope legacy survey wide fields ( cfhtls - wide ) @xcite .",
    "this is the deepest wide - field survey of its kind , covering 133 sqr .",
    "deg . and sampling a comoving volume of 0.2 gpc@xmath19h@xmath20 from @xmath21 .",
    "this data has been used for cosmological studies , including weak lensing constraints @xcite . in particular , a joint analysis using the weak lensing measurements has given a limit for massive neutrinos of @xmath22ev ( 95% c.l . ) @xcite .",
    "the small - scale clustering was studied using the halo model by ref . @xcite and",
    "the deprojected power spectrum was presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "considerable gains can be made by probing the power spectrum on weakly non - linear scales , provided one can model the galaxy bias sufficiently accurately . on large scales ,",
    "the galaxy power spectrum is well - fit by the dark matter power spectrum and a linear galaxy bias : @xmath23 . on small scales , where the details of galaxy formation come into play , this relation breaks down and a general , scale - dependent , galaxy bias model is necessary @xcite .",
    "this results in a degeneracy between galaxy bias and cosmological parameters that is difficult to break without further observations such as gravitational lensing @xcite .",
    "the scale - dependence of galaxy clustering has been investigated with simulations @xcite and observations @xcite .",
    "these studies show that galaxies with lower luminosity have a weaker scale - dependence of the bias than the most luminous ones at @xmath24 .",
    "additionally , the scale dependence becomes more severe for strongly biased tracers ; negligible scale dependence of the halo bias is found in simulations at @xmath25 for halos with @xmath26 , while for more massive halos with @xmath27 , there is a 20% effect @xcite .",
    "for the sdss main sample , the halofit non - linear matter power spectrum with a constant bias factor has been demonstrated to be a good fit to the galaxy power spectrum @xcite , while the power spectrum of the lrg sample diverges at @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "we select the range of scales to study based on the dominance of the two - halo term in the halo occupation distribution ( hod ) model of the power spectrum . in ref .",
    "@xcite , hod fits are made to the correlation function of the cfhtls galaxies .",
    "we have checked explicitly that the two - halo term is greater than the one - halo term to @xmath29 in our lowest redshift sample ( @xmath30 ) . in sec .",
    "[ results ] we test our cfhtls data set using a comparison of the constant bias model with a two - parameter model in the context of @xmath13cdm without massive neutrinos .",
    "we conclude that a constant bias model is sufficient .",
    "the cfhtls data set is ideal for this study because ( i ) at higher redshift the onset of non - linear growth happens at smaller scales ; and ( ii ) we are targeting `` normal '' galaxies : the flux limited sample that we construct ( @xmath31 ) selects galaxies to @xmath32 with luminosities of @xmath33 , similar to the sdss main sample at @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "since we analyze the projected density field , any modulation of the power spectrum due to redshift - space distortions is minimized , although these effects must be considered for surveys covering a larger fraction of the sky than cfhtls @xcite .",
    "we must also consider systematic errors arising from the luminosity dependence of the galaxy bias . in a flux - limited sample with a mixture of galaxy types ,",
    "luminosity - dependent biasing can modify the slope of the galaxy power spectrum .",
    "however , for current surveys such as 2dfgrs , the effects can be neglected @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will present constraints on the total mass of neutrinos , @xmath1 , and the effective number of neutrino species , @xmath16 , from different cosmological observations .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in section [ cltheory ] we briefly review the general formalism of the angular power spectrum @xmath35 . in sections [ cldata ] and [ otherdata ]",
    "we describe the recently released cfhtls clustering power spectra data set , and the other data sets we use .",
    "section [ results ] contains our main results on @xmath1 and @xmath16 , while section [ summary ] is dedicated to the conclusions and discussion .",
    "the angular power spectrum , @xmath35 , is a projection of the spatial power spectrum of fluctuations , @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the comoving wave number and @xmath38 is the redshift .",
    "the equation for the projection is @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the matter power spectrum today and @xmath41 is the assumed scale - independent bias factor relating the galaxy overdensity to the mass overdensity . in our calculations , we assume the values of bias are constant in each redshift bin ; with width @xmath42 , these are relatively narrow .",
    "we also neglect the effect of redshift space distortions , as their effect is limited to large scales , @xmath43 @xcite , and our largest bin is at @xmath44 . with these assumptions , the kernel @xmath45 is given by @xmath46~,\\label{eq : gl}\\ ] ] where @xmath47 is the spherical bessel function",

    "we analyze the galaxy density maps constructed by ref .",
    "@xcite from the canada - france - hawaii legacy survey wide fields ( cfhtls - wide ) .",
    "the data set is based on the cfhtls t0006 release , including photometric redshift estimates @xcite .",
    "a selection of galaxies was made photometrically to an apparent flux limit of @xmath56 in three photometric redshift bins : @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 , labeled s6 , s7 and s8 .",
    "we are not overly concerned with the error in the photometric redshift estimates , although it is typically @xmath60 @xcite ; we only require knowledge of the redshift distributions of the samples . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the redshift distributions were measured using a subset of @xmath6114000 spectroscopic redshifts obtained from the vimos public extragalactic redshift survey ( vipers ) @xcite .",
    "we also use those redshift distributions here .",
    "we estimate the @xmath62 with a maximum likelihood approach first applied to cosmic microwave background maps @xcite .",
    "it is well suited to fields that may be described by a gaussian likelihood function , and it has been extended successfully to measure the angular power spectrum in galaxy surveys @xcite .    for surveys that cover only a relatively small patch of sky , such as cfhtls , the maximum likelihood approach has advantages over other techniques . generally , it is challenging to measure harmonic modes that are strongly affected by the survey geometry .",
    "modes become correlated due to the convolution effect of the survey mask ; further , the hard edges can introduce ` ringing ' in harmonic space .",
    "our estimator accounts for these effects and measures the @xmath62 with minimum variance ( in the case of a gaussian field ) .",
    "along with the @xmath62 , we derive the covariance matrix of the measurements and window functions .",
    "the galaxy density maps were constructed on a healpix grid with an angular resolution of 7 arcmin ( @xmath63 ) @xcite .",
    "we order the @xmath64 pixels of the density map , form a data vector , @xmath65 $ ] , and write the covariance of the data as @xmath66 .",
    "the pixel covariance matrix is given by the sum of the signal and the noise components @xmath67 where @xmath68 are the legendre polynomials , @xmath69 is the separation between pixels @xmath70 and @xmath71 and @xmath72 is the noise covariance matrix . the noise matrix is taken to be diagonal with poisson elements given by @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is a weight accounting for partially - sampled pixels .",
    "the finite resolution of the pixelised map attenuates the power spectrum by the pixel window function , @xmath75 , which depends on the pixel geometry @xcite .    to simplify the following expressions , we introduce a symmetric matrix @xmath76 .",
    "this is a sum of the legendre polynomials over a band - power indexed by @xmath41 including @xmath77 .",
    "the components are @xmath78    the quadratic band - power estimator is given by @xmath79 the matrix @xmath80 is a mixing matrix that sets the normalization and may be specified to form linear combinations of the bin estimates .",
    "it is related to the fisher matrix , @xmath81 the expectation and variance of the estimator are @xmath82 @xmath83 and the window functions are @xmath84 . the matrix @xmath80 can be chosen in a variety of ways to optimize the estimator @xcite .",
    "because the fisher matrix is ill - conditioned due to the small survey size , we use the robust normalization @xmath85 .",
    "the covariance between the @xmath62 measurements of two redshift slices labeled @xmath86 and @xmath87 may be estimated as @xmath88 where @xmath89 is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : cl ] ) , rewriting as @xmath90 we must further convolve by the survey window functions .",
    "this is an idealization that neglects the precise survey geometry but we may scale it to match the variance computed from the quadratic estimator    .cfhtls samples [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]          in this subsection , we consider the constraints on the effective number of neutrino species , @xmath16 , assuming massless neutrinos .",
    "since @xmath16 can be written in terms of @xmath91 and the redshift of matter - radiation equality , @xmath92 , there are strong degeneracies present between @xmath16 , the matter density , @xmath93 and the hubble parameter @xmath94 @xcite .",
    "cmb constraints on @xmath16 can thus be strongly improved by combining them with measurements of the small - scale matter power spectrum such as those obtained from sdss or cfhtls .",
    "we find the wmap7 data alone gives @xmath95 at the 95% confidence level , consistent with the result derived by the wmap7 team @xcite .",
    "adding the cfhtls data significantly improves the constraints on @xmath16 to @xmath96 at the 68% and 95% c.l .",
    "figure [ fig : neff-2d ] shows the two dimensional likelihood contours for both these constraints , with @xmath97 , making it clear that the improvement is coming from degeneracy breaking . for comparison ,",
    "when we use the sdss dr4 lrg power spectra data instead of cfhtls , we obtain the very consistent @xmath98 ( 68 and 95% c.l . ) .",
    "wmap7+hst gives @xmath99 ( 68 and 95% c.l . ) .",
    "adding the cfhtls angular power spectra tightens this to @xmath100 .",
    "this is similar to wmap7+hst+sdss , which gives @xmath101 .",
    "wmap7+hst+sdss+cfhtls gives @xmath102 .",
    "table [ table : neff ] lists these constraints on @xmath16 , while figure [ fig : neff-1d ] shows one - dimensional marginalized likelihood constraints on @xmath16 , @xmath103 and @xmath94 , with @xmath104 .",
    "wmap7+hst+sdss+cfhtls+sn gives our most stringent constraint of @xmath105 we also consider the @xmath106 case and find that the constraint improves slightly : @xmath107 for the 68% and 95% confidence levels .",
    "our results are quite consistent with those of the act and spt cmb experiments , which are @xmath108 and @xmath109 ( @xmath110% confidence level ) , and , like them , display a slight preference for an extra relativistic relic @xcite .",
    "however , the standard value of @xmath14 remains well within the 95% confidence intervals .",
    "measurements of the galaxy power spectrum can put strong constraints on the neutrino mass and effective number of neutrino species .",
    "significant gains can be made by probing weakly non - linear scales and investigating redshift evolution .",
    "we have used the improved parametrization developed by ref .",
    "@xcite , who precisely calibrated the effect of massive neutrinos on the matter power spectrum using a suite of n - body simulations , to investigate non - linear scales .",
    "although the non - linear matter power spectrum may be estimated accurately from simulations , connecting it to the galaxy clustering is challenging . in this study , we have assumed a simple bias model with no dependence on scale . to check the validity of this model",
    ", we fit the power spectrum with a simple two - parameter @xmath111 bias model in @xmath13cdm without massive neutrinos .",
    "we find that the best - fitting @xmath111 model has negligible scale - dependence to @xmath112 .",
    "we stress that this is only a consistency check , but it demonstrates that a scale - dependent bias model is not needed to fit the data at the redshifts we consider , @xmath113 , even to weakly non - linear scales of @xmath112 .",
    "these results are in part due to the range of galaxy luminosities represented in the cfhtls sample .",
    "the cfhtls data set thus probes an interesting regime for neutrino studies for @xmath21 at small scales that can be modeled with confidence .",
    "we find that combining the cfhtls data with wmap already gives tight limits on the total neutrino mass .",
    "adding additional low - redshift probes , including sdss lrgs and sn , only marginally improves the constraints .",
    "we benefit considerably by extending the angular scale limit from @xmath104 to @xmath114 .",
    "this extends the fit from @xmath115 to @xmath112 .",
    "however , there is a strong correlation between galaxy bias and total neutrino mass , since both parameters modulate the amplitude of the galaxy power spectrum .",
    "thus , future analyses can benefit from adding additional observables to constrain the galaxy bias .",
    "we further constrain the effective number of neutrino species . again , cfhtls complements the wmap7 data by constraining @xmath116 leading to tighter limits on @xmath16 .",
    "we find that the constraining power of the cfhtls data is similar to that of the sdss lrg sample and the limits from both surveys are fully consistent .",
    "the main constraints derived in this paper are summarized as follows : cfhtls , combined with wmap7 and a prior on the hubble constant provides an upper limit of @xmath3ev and @xmath4 ( 2@xmath5 confidence levels ) .",
    "if we instead omit smaller scales which may be affected by non - linearities , these constraints relax to the following values : @xmath6ev and @xmath7 ( 2@xmath5 confidence levels ) . by combining with the sdss lrg matter power and sn luminosity distance moduli",
    "we further improve to @xmath117ev and @xmath118 ( 2@xmath5 confidence levels ) .",
