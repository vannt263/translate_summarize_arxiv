    "the primary source of energy for the earth s atmosphere is the sun , so it is reasonable to explore whether changes in the global climate result from solar variability .",
    "it was first suggested by the astronomer william herschel ( @xcite ) that variations in the solar irradiance caused by sunspots could lead to climatic changes on earth , and he cited the variation of british wheat prices with sunspot number as evidence for this link .",
    "the occurrence of the `` little ice age '' during the 1645 - 1715 maunder sunspot minimum ( @xcite ) , the correlation between the long - term solar cycle variations and tropical sea surface temperatures ( @xcite ) , polar stratospheric temperatures ( @xcite ) , and the width of tree rings ( @xcite ) , along with many other studies also support a link between solar variations and the earth s climate .",
    "a direct link between the sun and these phenomena is tenuous , however , because the magnitude of the solar irradiance variation over the 11-year solar cycle is very small . over the 1979 - 1990 solar cycle ,",
    "for example , the variation in the irradiance was only @xmath0 ( @xcite ) , or @xmath1 w m@xmath2 globally - averaged at the top of the atmosphere .",
    "this is insufficient to power the sea surface temperature changes associated with the solar cycle by a factor of @xmath3 ( @xcite ) , and is significantly smaller than the globally - averaged forcings due to clouds ( @xmath4 w m@xmath2 ; e.g. @xcite ) , anthropogenic greenhouse gases ( @xmath5 w m@xmath2 ; @xcite ) , and anthropogenic aerosols ( @xmath6 w m@xmath2 ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , suggesting that any direct atmospheric forcing from solar irradiance variations would be relatively unimportant .",
    "an indirect link between solar cycle variations and the earth s climate appears more likely , especially given the discovery of a link between the flux of galactic cosmic rays ( gcrs ) and global cloudiness ( @xcite ) in the isccp cloud database ( @xcite ) .",
    "the sun modulates the gcr flux at the earth through the action of the solar wind , which scatters and attenuates the gcrs in times of heightened solar activity ( solar maximum ; e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "using @xmath7 @xmath8 m infrared ( ir ) cloud amounts from the isccp database for the years 1983 - 1993 , marsh and svensmark ( 2000 ) and pall bag and butler ( 2000 ) showed that there is evidence of a positive gcr - cloud correlation only for low ( @xmath9 km ) clouds , and that the effect of the cosmic rays on global cloud amount appears to be greatest at the low to mid latitudes .",
    "the globally - averaged forcing due to the increase in low clouds associated with the solar cycle gcr variations is estimated ( @xcite ) to be approximately @xmath10 w m@xmath2 , which is sufficient to power the sea surface temperature variations ( @xcite ) .",
    "this is also comparable in magnitude ( but opposite in sign ) to the forcing due to anthropogenic co@xmath11 emission over the last century ( @xcite ) . decreasing local cloud amounts correlated with short - term forbush decreases in cosmic - ray rates were observed by pudovkin and veretenko ( 1995 ) .",
    "the reality of the gcr - cloud connection has been questioned by a number of authors ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these objection can be distilled into three main points : 1 ) the gcr - cloud correlation should be seen prominently in high ( cirrus ) clouds at high latitudes where the cosmic - ray intensity is highest , 2 ) the increased cloudiness can be more plausibly attributed to other phenomena instead of gcrs , and 3 ) the correlation is an artifact of the isccp analysis .",
    "the first objection is addressed by the theory of ion - mediated nucleation ( imn : @xcite ; yu 2002 ) , in which the efficiency of the cosmic - ray interaction is limited at high altitudes by the lack of aerosol precursor vapors such as h@xmath11so@xmath12 relative to the ion concentration . for the second objection , the temporal profile of the gcr - cloud correlation may be inconsistent with the profiles of the dominant volcanic and el nio / southern oscillation ( enso ) events during the same time period ( @xcite ) , although no quantitative study of the various temporal signatures in the data has been undertaken . finally , the isccp artifacts pointed out by norris ( 2000 ) are troubling , but it is not clear that they are of sufficient magnitude to produce the observed gcr - cloud correlation , and it does nt explain why the correlation exists only for low clouds and not the other cloud types in the isccp database .",
    "the linkage between cosmic rays and cloud formation has been recently investigated by a number of authors ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite and references therein ) . here",
    "we apply a perturbative approach to quantify the effects of variations in the cosmic - ray rate on the optical thicknesses , or opacities , of clouds , and use the observed cloud opacity variations to constrain the microphysical models of ion - mediated ultrafine particle formation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we discuss how the effect of cosmic rays could alter the optical thickness and emissivity of clouds by affecting the nucleation of condensation nuclei ( cn ) .",
    "the search for variations in cloud optical properties using the isccp database and their correlation with cosmic - ray flux variations are discussed in section [ variations ] a discussion of the results is given in section [ discussion ] , and finally we summarize our results in section [ summary ]",
    "cosmic rays form water droplets in the supersaturated air of a classical cloud chamber ( @xcite ) , and it seems plausible that they could also play a significant role in natural cloud formation .",
    "yu and turco ( 2000 , 2001 ) and yu ( 2002 ) have investigated the formation of ultrafine cn from charged molecular clusters formed from cosmic - ray ionization , and they find that the charged clusters grow more rapidly and are more stable than their neutral counterparts up to a size of @xmath13 nm . although the subsequent growth of the cosmic - ray formed ultrafine cn to viable @xmath14 nm cloud condensation nuclei ( ccn ) has not been explored , the concentration of ccn should also reflect the cn concentration , as well as the direct influence of cosmic rays , if the cosmic - ray ionization rate does not affect other important nucleation efficiency parameters such as condensible vapor concentration , temperature , and pressure .",
    "we will make this assumption here although it may not be strictly true with respect to the condensible vapor concentration ( see e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "althought the formation of ccn and ultimately cloud droplets is a function of many variable factors such as temperature , pressure , vapor concentration , and relative humidity , we can quantify the effects of small variations in the ionization rate ( primarily due to cosmic rays above ocean and at altitudes @xmath15 km above land ; e.g. @xcite ) on the number of ccn through a perturbation approach , i.e. @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the concentration of ccn , @xmath18 is the ionization rate , @xmath19 refers to the set of parameters other than the ionization rate affecting @xmath17 , and the partial derivative is evaluated for fixed @xmath19 ( hereafter this will not be written explicitly ) . along with the assumption discussed previously , this approach assumes that the quantity @xmath20 , which is probably true for solar cycle variations , where @xmath18 typically varies by @xmath21 , but may not be true during periods of large scale changes in the geomagnetic field ( e.g. @xcite ) .    to quantify the effect of varying ccn concentrations on cloud optical thicknesses , we envision the two idealized scenarios depicted in figure  1 . in both cloud formation scenarios , changes in the ionizing cosmic - ray flux cause changes in the number of cloud condensation nuclei through the process of ion - mediated nucleation on the formation of ultrafine cn in accordance with the assumptions mentioned above in figure  1 , which need not be valid for all @xmath18 . ] . in the first case",
    "we assume that the nucleation of cloud droplets is limited by the available amount of water in the supersaturated air , so that the liquid water content ( lwc ) , or density of water in droplets , is constant .",
    "therefore the amount of water per droplet and hence the effective radii of cloud droplets will change with the cosmic - ray ionization rate .",
    "this is analogous to the `` twomey effect '' of enhanced aerosol pollution on droplet size distributions and the albedo of clouds ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , and would primarily occur in environments where the amount of water in the air ( and not the number of ccn ) is the limiting factor .",
    "thus , using ( [ perturb ] ) , we would expect that the effective radius @xmath22 of the cloud droplet distribution resulting from a small change in the cosmic - ray ionization rate @xmath23 in any particular volume of air will be @xmath24}^{1/3}r_{eff}^{0}\\approx{\\left ( 1 + { \\delta q\\over   n_{\\rm{ccn}}}{\\partial n_{\\rm{ccn}}\\over \\partial q}\\right ) } ^{-1/3 }   r_{eff}^{0},\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the effective radius of the unperturbed droplet distribution , which we will associate with the solar maximum period of the solar cycle .    in the second case in figure  1",
    ", we assume that the change in ccn concentration resulting from change in cosmic - ray ionization causes a proportionate change in the amount of water extracted from the supersaturated air , with the effective radius of the cloud droplet distribution remaining constant .",
    "this is the case where the formation of the cloud is limited by the local availability of ccn and not condensible water .",
    "this effect has been seen in the marine boundary layer in ship track clouds ( @xcite ) , which have higher reflectivities ( @xcite ) and liquid water contents ( @xcite ) due to the formation of additional ultrafine cn from ship exhaust .",
    "the perturbed liquid water content of a cloud in any particular volume of air will then be given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the unperturbed cloud liquid water content associated with solar maximum as before .",
    "these two scenarios probably represent extremes of the direct cosmic - ray ionization effect on the clouds . as in the ship track clouds , the effect of the gcrs",
    "will probably be a combination of both lwc changes and @xmath22 changes , with the magnitude of the effect being bounded by the changes given in ( [ reff ] ) and ( [ lwc ] ) .",
    "changes in the cloud liquid water content and droplet effective radius , associated with changes in the ionization rate due to cosmic rays , will result in changes in cloud opacities .",
    "the optical thickness @xmath28 of a uniform cloud layer of thickness @xmath29 is given by ( @xcite ) : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the concentration of cloud droplets with radii between @xmath32 and @xmath33 , @xmath34 is the mie extinction efficiency , and it is commonly assumed that @xmath35 which is a good approximation when @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the wavelength ( @xcite ) .",
    "the effective radius of the cloud droplet distribution is given by @xmath38 and the cloud liquid water content is given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the density of liquid water .",
    "combining these equations , we see that @xmath41 thus from ( [ tau2 ] ) we would expect that an increase ( decrease ) in the mean @xmath22 and a decrease ( increase ) in the mean @xmath42 , resulting from ionization variations due to cosmic rays , would result in a decrease ( increase ) the mean opacity of clouds .    the change in cloud opacity with cosmic - ray rate",
    "can be quantified using the perturbation assumptions discussed in section [ nucleation ] and equations ( [ reff ] ) , ( [ lwc ] ) , and ( [ tau2 ] ) . the fractional change in cloud opacity",
    "is then given by @xmath43 where @xmath44 for ccn ( water ) limited cloud formation , and the fractional change in the perturbed opacity @xmath28 ( relative to the unperturbed opacity @xmath45 ) is defined by @xmath46 . as mentioned previously",
    ", this derivation assumes that the right hand side of ( [ dtaureff ] ) is much less than one , which may not be the case for large changes in @xmath18 and @xmath17 . as before we will assume that the unperturbed ( perturbed ) values of @xmath18 and @xmath17 refer to the values at solar maximum ( minimum ) .    at visible wavelengths from space",
    ", the primary consequence of the change in cloud opacity associated with cosmic rays will be an increase in cloud reflectivity , or albedo . to investigate this",
    ", we use the radiative transfer code sbdart ( @xcite ) to calculate the top of the atmosphere broadband ( @xmath47 @xmath48 ) upward flux for three uniform low cloud models : 1 ) a @xmath49 km thick cloud layer extending to a height of @xmath50 km , 2 ) a @xmath50 km thick cloud extending to a height of @xmath51 km , and 3 ) a @xmath52 km cloud layer extending to @xmath53 km .",
    "these simulations were done with a tropical atmosphere profile ( @xcite ) and an ocean surface albedo .",
    "the fractional increases in albedo , resulting from a 10% increase in the number of cloud droplets due to cosmic ray ionization variations , is shown in figure  2 for the @xmath49 km thick cloud case , for a wide range of lwc and @xmath22 in the variable lwc case ( top panel ) and the variable @xmath22 case ( bottom panel ) . in both cases",
    "the contours of changing albedo approximately parallel the change in optical thickness calculated assuming @xmath54    figure  3 shows the fractional change in albedo directly as a function of opacity for all three cloud models .",
    "this figure clearly shows that the change in albedo is largest for clouds with opacities @xmath28 between 1 and 10 , but is roughly independent of cloud geometrical thickness .",
    "figures  2 and 3 indicate that the change in cloud optical thickness can be used to quantify the effects of the cosmic rays on cloud optical properties .",
    "although the fractional change in albedo due to the cosmic rays is only @xmath55 for a @xmath56 variation in the number of cloud droplets , this can produce a significant forcing per cloud of @xmath57 w m@xmath2 at the top of the atmosphere for a solar zenith angle of @xmath58 .",
    "the modulation of cloud opacity due to cosmic rays could therefore produce a similar modulation of the earth s energy budget over the 11 year solar cycle , although the exact amount of forcing due to cosmic rays will depend sensitively on cloud amount variations , cloud opacity variations , and the efficiency at which changes in the cosmic ray rate are reflected in the number of cloud condensation nuclei .",
    "because of the relationship between cloud opacity and emissivity , the cosmic rays should also produce an observable effect on cloud emission at infrared ( ir ) wavelengths .",
    "the effective ir emissivity @xmath59 can be parameterized by a relation of the form ( @xcite ) : @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the mass absorption coefficient .",
    "empirical fits to ir emission from water clouds yield @xmath62 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the exponent in ( [ emiss ] ) is proportional to the cloud optical thickness for a given droplet effective radius , so the infrared emissivity increases with cloud opacity , with the change being most noticeable for optically thin clouds .",
    "therefore one would expect a change in ir emission , along with the primary effect of changes in visible albedo , from clouds at solar minimum relative to clouds at solar maximum if the cosmic rays change the cloud liquid water contents .",
    "interestingly , a correlation between cosmic ray rate and cloud top temperature for low clouds has been reported by marsh and svensmark ( 2000 ) , supporting this hypothesis .",
    "to search for systematic temporal changes in synoptic scale cloud optical properties , we used the international cloud climatology project ( isccp ) monthly gridded cloud products ( `` d2 '' ) datasets , a compilation of cloud properties derived from satellite observations during the period 19831999 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the isccp d2 data used here consists of mean daytime cloud amount fractions and visible optical depths , as a function of time , for @xmath63 `` boxes '' with equal area covering the entire surface of the earth . for a given time",
    ", the cloud amount fraction in each box is defined as the number of cloudy satellite image pixels , as determined by a cloud detection algorithm , divided by the total number of pixels in the box .",
    "the cloud optical thicknesses are derived from the visible satellite cloud albedos by using a radiative transfer model and assuming spherical droplets with droplet sizes characterized by a gamma distribution with variance @xmath64 and @xmath65 @xmath8 m .",
    "isccp cloud top temperatures are simultaneously determined from the @xmath66 ir radiances , allowing for determination of cloud altitude and pressure , and the low , mid - level , and high clouds are defined as having cloud top pressures @xmath67 mb , @xmath68 mb , and @xmath69 mb , respectively . because we require the simultaneous visible and infrared radiances to determine the opacity and cloud height for our analysis , we only use the isccp daytime data .",
    "this is a different dataset than the diurnal 1983 - 1993 ir data used for the cloud amount analyses of marsh and svensmark ( 2000 ) and pall bag and butler ( 2000 ) .",
    "detailed information on the distribution of cloud optical thicknesses is not preserved in the the isccp d2 database , and instead the mean optical thickness @xmath70 is recorded for three broad opacity bands @xmath71 : @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 .",
    "thus a detailed analysis of the change in @xmath28 over the solar cycle is not possible using the d2 data , but a value of the _ weighted _ mean cloud optical thickness @xmath75 can be calculated using @xmath76 where the @xmath77 are the total mean cloud amount fractions within each of the broad isccp optical thickness bins mentioned above .",
    "we calculated @xmath75 separately for the three cloud altitude levels and for two latitude bands with @xmath78 ( low latitude ) and @xmath79 ( high latitude ) .",
    "the error associated with each @xmath70 was estimated by calculating the standard deviation of each isccp data point , from the scatter about the mean , and scaling by the square root of the number of data points .",
    "the mean optical thicknesses @xmath75 as a function of time for the low latitude clouds are shown in figure  4 , and the corresponding result for global high latitude clouds is shown in figure  5 . shaded is the two year period in which the effects of the mt .",
    "pinatubo eruption appear to be most significant .",
    "also shown for comparison are the mean counting rates from the climax , colorado neutron monitor run by the university of chicago ( obtained from http:@xmath80ulysses.uchicago.edu@xmath81neutronmonitor@xmath81neutron_mon.html ) , which is a good measure of the local cosmic - ray ionization rate . in the low latitude case ,",
    "the abrupt and large decrease in @xmath75 during 19911993 is due to the eruption of mt .",
    "pinatubo , and the subsequent plot scaling obscures smaller scale opacity variations . for comparison",
    ", we also plot the total mean cloud amount fractions @xmath82 for the same two latitude bands in figures  6 and 7 .",
    "these plots show evidence for increases in mean cloud amount due to mt .",
    "pinatubo , as well as the smaller - scale temporal variations .      to search for subtle variations in the isccp cloud opacities and amounts due to cosmic rays only , it is first necessary to eliminate the opacity variations in the data due to the mt .",
    "pinatubo volcanic eruption in june - september 1991 and strong enso events during the period of the isccp data . to separate out the various temporal signatures in the isccp data , we use a linear temporal model of the form @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the mean isccp quantity of interest for the year @xmath85 , which for our purpose is either the visible cloud opacity @xmath75 or the mean cloud amount / fractional area @xmath86 .",
    "the model consists of four temporal basis vectors @xmath87 , which are functions of time , each scaled by a linear coefficient @xmath88 . for our temporal model",
    "we choose basis vectors corresponding to constant level of the given quantity ( @xmath89 ) and variations due to enso events ( e.g. @xcite ) , the mt .",
    "pinatubo eruption of 1991 , and cosmic rays ( @xmath90-@xmath51 , respectively ) .",
    "given the functional form of the basis vectors , the best - fit values of the linear coefficients can be determined through least squares minimization , and the fractional change in the time - varying isccp quantity over the data stretch is then given by @xmath91 , where @xmath90-@xmath51 . this model assumes a linear correlation between the quantity of interest and the basis vectors and assumes no time delays ; more complicated models are possible but will not be considered here .",
    "the normalized basis vectors used in the temporal analysis of the isccp cloud data are shown in figure  8 .",
    "all of the vectors are scaled to values between zero and one . for the enso term @xmath92 we use the scaled yearly - averaged southern oscillation index ( soi ) from the australian bureau of meteorology ( obtained from http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/current/soihtm1.shtml ) .",
    "the soi is a measure of the size of fluctuations in the sea level pressure difference between tahiti and darwin , australia , and small values of the scaled soi denote el nio conditions and large values la nia  both of which affect global weather ( @xcite ) . to parameterize the effect of the mt .",
    "pinatubo eruptions of 1991 , we adopt a simple step function for @xmath93 , with identical non - zero intensities only for years 1991 and 1992 . for the final term in the temporal model , @xmath94 , we use the scaled cosmic - ray rate from the climax neutron monitor .",
    "neutron monitor rates are directly proportional to the ionization rates due to cosmic rays because the neutrons are produced by the same cosmic ray cascade particles that produce the ionization , and the neutrons subsequently diffuse through less than 100 m of air before they are thermalized and captured by n to form @xmath95c ( e.g. lingenfelter , 1963 ) .",
    "neutron counters are thus unsusceptible to background ionizations due to terrestrial radiation from radioactive decays , which dominate the ionization signal from galactic cosmic rays only below @xmath96 km in the atmosphere ( @xcite )",
    ".    the results of the temporal fitting of both the isccp visible cloud opacities and amounts are shown in table  1 .",
    "formally most of the fits are not good , with reduced chi - squares ranging from @xmath97 for twelve degrees of freedom .",
    "there are a number of possible factors that could be contributing to this .",
    "for example the error bars on the data may have been underestimated , leading to an artificially large values of chi - squared .",
    "another possibility is that our fitting model is missing other significant temporal drivers , or perhaps a non - linear model or different basis vectors may be required to fit the data .",
    "we tried to fit the isccp data with linear models composed of different combinations of our four basis vectors , and models with the cosmic - ray term provided a better fit to the data in general .",
    "nevertheless it is possible that un - modeled phenomena mimic the temporal signature of cosmic rays in the data ; more robust calculations of isccp error bars , inclusion of more isccp data , and exploration of more complicated temporal models in future work will help resolve this issue .",
    "the fractional variation in visible opacity @xmath98 associated with the cosmic rays ranges from @xmath99 for high clouds to @xmath100 for low clouds . for the mean visible cloud amounts",
    "the variation due to cosmic rays is just the opposite  becoming greater in magnitude as the cloud height",
    "_ decreases _  qualitatively consistent with the positive correlation seen in the isccp ir data between cosmic ray rate and low clouds ( @xcite ; marsh and svensmark 2000 ; pall bag and butler 2000 ) .",
    "therefore the high clouds appear to become thicker but smaller in response to increasing cosmic ray flux , while for the low clouds the response is the opposite .",
    "the observed variation of cloud optical thicknesses with cosmic - ray rate can be used to constrain microphysical models of the cloud condensation nuclei concentration @xmath17 using ( [ dtaureff ] ) . of crucial importance",
    "is the partial derivative @xmath101 , which determines the sign of the change in opacity with cosmic - ray rate . recently",
    "yu ( 2002 ) calculated @xmath17 as a function of altitude and ionization rate using an ion - mediated nucleation code .",
    "given this model and the vertical profiles of sulfuric acid vapor concentration , ionization rate , temperature , relative humidity , pressure , and surface area of pre - existing particles assumed therein ( yu 2002 ) , the value of @xmath102 peaks at values of @xmath103 , @xmath104 , and @xmath105 ion pairs @xmath106 for low , mid - level , and high clouds , respectively , such that @xmath107 for @xmath108 and @xmath109 for @xmath110 . using the cosmic - ray ionization rates found by neher ( 1961,1967 ) interpolated to geomagnetic latitude @xmath58 , we find typical ionization rates of , respectively , @xmath111 , @xmath104 , and @xmath112 ion pairs @xmath106 for the low , mid - level , and high isccp clouds .",
    "therefore from ( [ dtaureff ] ) we would expect a positive or zero correlation between opacity and cosmic - ray rate only for low clouds , and negative correlations for higher clouds for this model .",
    "we observe just the opposite , but the precision of the temporal model fits to the isccp data is not sufficient for us to rule out the yu ( 2002 ) model based on the data .",
    "all three of the time - varying parameters in our temporal model show inverse correlations between mean visible cloud opacity and amount , suggesting a common origin for this behavior .",
    "these inverse correlations are illustrated in figure  9 .",
    "these are probably not artifacts of the averaging process because the quantities in figure  9 have been normalized by their constant model terms in their temporal fits .",
    "one possible explanation for the inverse opacity - amount correlation is via a feedback mechanism . for the case of positive opacity variations , an increase in mean cloud opacity and albedo would result in increased energy loss to space and eventually less surface heating and subsequent water evaporation . hence clouds",
    "would tend to be smaller and have smaller areas than they would otherwise .",
    "conversely , for negative opacity variations clouds would tend to be larger .",
    "global climate simulations ( @xcite ) indicate that global cloud albedo - increasing perturbations  similar to the changes induced by cosmic rays  decrease the global transport of moisture from the tropics , which then could conceivably produce fewer or smaller global clouds on average by this mechanism .",
    "dynamical simulations of the response of global cloudiness to synoptic changes in the opacity are needed to investigate this .",
    "here we consider a model in which galactic cosmic rays alter the optical properties of clouds by changing the number of available cloud condensation nuclei .",
    "the main observational consequence of our model is a change in mean cloud opacity , with a secondary effect being a change in infrared emittance for optically thin clouds due to the relationship between cloud emissivity and opacity .",
    "we use the global isccp cloud database to search for variations in cloud properties due to cosmic rays , and after subtracting the background signals in the data due to mt .",
    "pinatubo and ensos , we find systematic variations in both opacity and cloud amount associated with changes in the cosmic - ray rate .",
    "the fractional variation in opacity attains a maximum positive value for high clouds and decreases with height , becoming negative or zero for low clouds .",
    "the fractional variation of the cloud amounts with cosmic - ray rate , however , show the opposite trend  increasing from a negative correlation at high altitudes to a positive correlation at low altitudes , which is consistent with the positive correlation between global low clouds clouds and cosmic - ray rate seen in the infrared ( @xcite ; marsh and svensmark 2000 ; pall bag and butler 2000 )    clearly more work is needed to model the opacity and cloud amount variations seen in the isccp data . using our simple temporal model and perturbative approach ,",
    "we have outlined a framework on which the variations in the data due to cosmic rays can be isolated and compared to model predictions . as the time span of the isccp data increases in length , more complicated models with additional components and nonlinear dependencies can be used , and the analysis can then be more robust .",
    "the isccp data requires the culling together and normalizing of many disparate satellite datasets ( @xcite ) , and although this approach is necessary at the present time it is not ideal .",
    "one complement to the isccp global cloud data would be provided by the nasa deep space mission _ triana _ , which would be able to retrieve cloud optical thicknesses simultaneously over the entire sunlit earth from the l1 lagrangian point between the earth and the sun .",
    "continuous deep space observing of earth s clouds would be ideal for detecting not only the solar cycle variations seen here but also the shorter duration but possibly more frequent variations in global cloud cover associated with forbush decreases of galactic cosmic rays and high energy solar proton events from the sun .",
