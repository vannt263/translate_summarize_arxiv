    "in the present paper we consider an extension of the standard model ( sm ) based on the randall - sundrum model with two branes stabilized by a bulk scalar field @xcite , which is necessary for the model to be phenomenologically acceptable .",
    "a characteristic feature of this extension is the presence of a massive scalar radion field together with its kaluza - klein ( kk ) tower .",
    "these fields have the same quantum numbers as the neutral higgs field .",
    "thus , the radion field and its excitations can mix with the higgs field , if they are coupled .",
    "originally , a higgs - radion coupling in the unstabilized randall - sundrum model arising due to a higgs - curvature term on the brane was put forward in @xcite .",
    "then , such a coupling and the resulting higgs - radion mixing in the case of the stabilized model were discussed in paper @xcite without taking into account the kk tower of higher scalar excitations .",
    "the phenomenology of the higgs - radion mixing originating from the higgs - curvature term was also considered in view of the discovery of the higgs - like boson at the lhc @xcite ; various assumptions about the masses and the mixings of the scalar states have been analyzed in papers @xcite@xcite .",
    "in particular , it was shown that the light radion - dominated state with mass below or above the observed 125-gev boson is still not completely excluded by all the electroweak precision constraints and the lhc data .    here",
    ", we discuss a different mechanism of higgs - radion mixing immanent in stabilized brane - world models , where a higgs - radion coupling naturally arises due to spontaneous symmetry breaking on the brane involving the stabilizing scalar field .",
    "this approach takes into account the influence of the kk tower of higher scalar excitations on the parameters of the higgs - radion mixing , which turns out to be of importance .    in principle , the most general mechanism of higgs - radion mixing can include both possible higgs - radion couplings .",
    "however , after the spontaneous symmetry breaking on the brane the higgs - curvature term also gives rise to a brane - localized curvature term that affects the mass spectrum and the couplings to matter of the graviton kk modes @xcite ; this effect should be taken into account when examining the four - dimensional effective theory . for this reason , here we restrict ourselves to the new mechanism of higgs - radion mixing , which has the advantage that it modifies only the scalar sector of the model and leaves intact the masses and the coupling constants of the graviton kk excitations .",
    "this also allows one to isolate the effects due only to the new mechanism of the mixing .",
    "a stabilized brane - world model in five - dimensional space - time @xmath0 with coordinates @xmath1 , @xmath2 , with the coordinate @xmath3 parameterizing the fifth dimension , is defined by the action @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are given by @xmath7 here the signature of the metric @xmath8 is chosen to be @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the fundamental five - dimensional energy scale , @xmath11 is a bulk scalar field potential , @xmath12 are brane scalar field potentials , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 denotes the metric induced on the branes .",
    "the space of extra dimension is the orbifold @xmath15 , which is realized as the circle of circumference @xmath16 with the points @xmath17 and @xmath18 identified .",
    "correspondingly , the metric @xmath8 and the scalar field @xmath19 satisfy the orbifold symmetry conditions @xmath20 the branes are located at the fixed points of the orbifold , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , and it is assumed that the sm fields with lagrangian @xmath23 live on the brane at @xmath22",
    ".    for this form of the action , the vacuum solution for gravity and the stabilizing scalar field and the vacuum solution for the sm fields are independent .",
    "if we consider this brane - world model to be an indivisible theory , it is reasonable to believe that there should be a common interconnected vacuum solution for all these fields . to this end , let us modify action ( [ actionsm ] ) so that it contains a quartic interaction of the stabilizing scalar field and of the higgs field , which would connect the stabilization of the extra dimension size and the sm spontaneous symmetry breaking : @xmath24 where the lagrangian @xmath25 is the sm lagrangian without the higgs potential , which is replaced by the interaction lagrangian @xmath26 @xmath27 being a positive dimensionless parameter .",
    "a similar interaction lagrangian quadratic in the stabilizing scalar field was discussed in @xcite .",
    "the background solutions for the metric and the scalar field , which preserve the poincar invariance in any four - dimensional subspace @xmath28 , look like @xmath29 with @xmath30 denoting the flat minkowski metric , whereas the background ( vacuum ) solution for the higgs field is standard , @xmath31 with all the other sm fields being equal to zero .",
    "if one substitutes this ansatz into the equations corresponding to action ( [ actiondw ] ) , one gets a relation between the vacuum value of the higgs field and the value of the field @xmath19 on the brane at @xmath32 , @xmath33    this means that in such a scenario the higgs field vacuum expectation value , being proportional to the value of the stabilizing scalar field on the tev brane , arises dynamically as a result of the gravitational bulk stabilization .",
    "the gravitational background solution follows from the well - known system of nonlinear differential equations for functions @xmath34 @xcite , @xmath35 where the first equation is the equation for the scalar field and the other two follow from the einstein equations . here",
    "@xmath36 .",
    "suppose we have a solution @xmath37 to this system for an appropriate choice of the parameters of the potentials such that the interbrane distance is stabilized and equal to @xmath38 .",
    "this means that the vacuum energy of the scalar field has a minimum for this value of the interbrane distance .",
    "now the linearized theory is obtained by representing the metric , the scalar and the higgs field in the unitary gauge as @xmath39 substituting this representation into action ( [ actiondw ] ) and keeping the terms of the second order in @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 . the lagrangian of this action is the standard free lagrangian of the sm ( i.e. , the masses of all the sm fields , except the higgs field , are expressed in the same way as usual in terms of the vacuum value of the higgs field and the coupling constants ) together with the standard second variation lagrangian of the stabilized randall - sundrum model @xcite supplemented by an interaction term of fields @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "the part of the lagrangian relevant to the higgs - radion mixing is @xmath43\\delta(y - l).\\ ] ]    the bulk scalar field @xmath41 can be expanded in kk modes . in the case under consideration",
    "we can , in the standard way , find the equations for the mass spectrum and the wave functions of the kk excitations of the scalar fields just by replacing @xmath44 in the formulas of paper @xcite ( we note that in this paper the signature of the metric was @xmath45 , and for this reason some formulas of that paper my differ in sign from the corresponding formulas in the present paper ) .",
    "namely , in this paper it was shown that it was most convenient to describe the scalar degrees of freedom of stabilized brane - world models by the field @xmath46 related to the field @xmath41 by the gauge condition @xmath47 the equations of motion and the boundary conditions on the branes for the field @xmath48 define wave functions @xmath49 , corresponding to mass eigenvalues @xmath50 .",
    "expanding the field @xmath41 in these modes , substituting this expansion into the second variation lagrangian and integrating over the extra dimension coordinate @xmath17 , we get a four - dimensional lagrangian , in which there is an interaction between the modes and the higgs field coming from the term @xmath51 using gauge condition ( [ gauge_f ] ) , the mode decomposition of @xmath52 , @xmath53 and the boundary condition for the mode wave function @xmath54 at @xmath22 @xcite rewritten in terms of eq .",
    "( [ sigma_f_tems ] ) , @xmath55 the field @xmath41 can be expressed through @xmath54 as follows : @xmath56 where we have taken into account that @xmath57 in order to have galilean coordinates on the brane at @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "thus , the couplings of the modes to the higgs field can be written as @xmath59 where we have introduced dimensionless quantities @xmath60 which are supposed to be positive .",
    "these couplings are proportional to the squared masses of the modes and can be rather large for large @xmath61 . below we will see that it is the dimensionless quantities @xmath62 that are of importance .",
    "they are proportional to the values of the wave functions of the modes on the brane and it is convenient to express them in terms of the ratios of the latter and @xmath63 : @xmath64 these ratios must go to zero for large @xmath61 in order for the cumulative effect of the radion kk tower to be finite . in paper",
    "@xcite the scalar wave functions @xmath49 have been found explicitly in a stabilized brane - world model , where the warp factor is approximately equal to that of the unstabilized randall - sundrum model , and one can check that the quantities @xmath62 are indeed positive and the ratios @xmath65 really fall off fairly quickly for large @xmath61 in this case .",
    "it is rather difficult to find them explicitly in the stabilized brane - world models , where the warp factor is different from the exponential of a linear function , as it is in the randall - sundrum model .",
    "a study of such stabilized brane - world models has been carried out in papers @xcite , and it was found that they may also solve the hierarchy problem of the gravitational interaction , giving rise to the masses of kk excitations in the @xmath66 energy range .",
    "however , the corresponding equations can not be solved exactly and should be studied numerically for each set of the fundamental parameters of the model , which is a very complicated and laborious task .    here",
    ", we will not carry out such calculations for a specific stabilized brane - world model , but rather give a qualitative description of the phenomena due to the interaction of the higgs field with the radion and its kk tower , choosing the masses and the coupling constants in a consistent manner and taking into account the present - day theoretical and experimental restrictions on their values .",
    "the part of the extended sm lagrangian containing the scalar fields linearly or quadratically looks like @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the trace of the sm energy - momentum tensor and @xmath69 is the conformal anomaly of massless vector fields explicitly given by @xmath70 with @xmath71 being the well - known qcd and qed @xmath71 functions .",
    "the coupling of the scalar modes to the trace of the energy - momentum tensor comes from the standard interaction lagrangian for the metric fluctuations @xcite , which results in the expression for the parameters @xmath72 in terms of the scalar mode wave functions : @xmath73 in the case of the lowest scalar mode , the radion , this parameter is usually denoted as @xmath74 where @xmath75 is supposed to be of the order of the fundamental energy scale @xmath10 . below we will use @xmath75 as a natural scale for the interactions of the radion and for those induced by its kk tower . for this reason , it is also convenient to express @xmath72 in terms of @xmath75 and @xmath65 defined in ( [ ratios ] ) as @xmath76    in what follows , we consider the phenomenology of the higgs boson and the radion in the energy range much lower than the masses of the radion excitations . in this case",
    ", we can pass to a low - energy approximation for this lagrangian by dropping the kinetic terms of the radion excitation fields and integrating them out , which gives the following effective lagrangian for the interactions of the higgs and radion fields with the sm fields @xmath77 where the new parameters are defined in terms of the old ones as follows : @xmath78 we have already mentioned that these series should be convergent .",
    "the positive parameter @xmath79 can be of the order of @xmath80 , because the mass term @xmath81 should be positive , and , within the approach under consideration , the coupling constant of the higgs boson self - interaction @xmath82 can be larger than in the regular sm case .",
    "possible restrictions on the parameters @xmath83 will be discussed below .",
    "next we turn to the mass matrix of the fields @xmath42 and @xmath84 , which looks like @xmath85 this matrix can be diagonalized by a rotation matrix @xmath86 where the rotation angle @xmath87 is defined by the relation @xmath88 it is not difficult to see that it is sufficient to take this angle only in the interval @xmath89 , which is one full period of the function @xmath90 .",
    "the observable masses of the mass eigenstates are given by the expressions @xmath91 which are written in the form that explicitly shows that the smaller mass becomes smaller and the larger one becomes larger due to the mixing .",
    "the latter , in particular , means that the observable masses @xmath92 and @xmath93 can not be exactly equal in the presence of the mixing and the mixing angle @xmath87 is negative for @xmath94 in accordance with the observation in paper @xcite .    the original unobservable parameters of the matrix @xmath95 can be expressed in terms of the observable parameters @xmath93 , @xmath92 and @xmath87 .",
    "the correspondence between these sets of parameters is one - to - one , if one puts the mixing angle @xmath96 for @xmath97 .",
    "then the following formula for the parameter @xmath63 can be easily obtained : @xmath98 this formula , together with the second formula in ( [ parameter_c ] ) , gives an expression for the parameter @xmath83 in terms of the physical masses and the mixing angle @xmath99 which also depends on the sum of the wave function ratios @xmath100 .",
    "these ratios are , of course , model dependent , and , although they should fall off with @xmath61 in order for the sum to be convergent , one can not exclude that , in certain models , several first ratios can be of the order of unity .",
    "thus , one can conservatively estimate this sum to be also of the order of unity , for the radion mass in the interval @xmath101 and the mass of its first kk excitation of the order of 1 tev . ] which gives the estimate for the parameter @xmath83 @xmath102 which will be used in the subsequent calculations .",
    "the physical mass eigenstate fields @xmath103 are easily expressed in terms of matrix @xmath104 and the original fields as @xmath105 the field @xmath106 is called the higgs - dominated field , and the field @xmath107 is called the radion - dominated field because @xmath108 in the interval @xmath109 ( we recall that @xmath110 for @xmath94 ) . the interaction of these fields with the fields of the standard model is given by the following effective lagrangian :    @xmath111    the effective four - dimensional interaction lagrangian ( [ h - r - lagrangian ] ) expressed in terms of the physical higgs - dominated @xmath106 and radion - dominated @xmath107 fields contains their interactions with the sm fields and involves only five parameters in addition to those of the sm : the masses of the higgs - dominated and radion - dominated fields @xmath112 and @xmath113 , the mixing angle @xmath87 , the ( inverse ) coupling constant of the radion to the trace of the energy - momentum tensor of the sm fields @xmath75 and the parameter @xmath83 that accommodates the contributions of the integrated - out heavy scalar modes .",
    "we would like to note here that , according to formulas ( [ restriction ] ) and ( [ restriction1 ] ) , the parameter @xmath83 is proportional to its maximal value @xmath114 and therefore depends on the masses @xmath112 , @xmath113 and the mixing angle @xmath87 , which is a particular feature of the model .",
    "it is interesting to examine what occurs to lagrangian ( [ h - r - lagrangian ] ) if the fundamental energy scale @xmath10 goes to infinity . in the model under consideration , it is impossible just to take the limit @xmath115 because there exists relation ( [ relation ] ) for the model parameters , which includes the vacuum value of the higgs field . in the stabilized brane - world model discussed in @xcite ,",
    "the radion mass was found to be proportional to @xmath116 .",
    "thus , in order to keep this mass fixed , we have to take the limit @xmath117 and @xmath118 so that @xmath119 .",
    "one can see that in this case @xmath63 , which is proportional to @xmath120 , does not vanish , whereas @xmath75 defined in ( [ bees ] ) and ( [ lambda_r ] ) goes to infinity . as a result , in lagrangian ( [ h - r - lagrangian ] ) the terms with the energy - momentum tensor that are proportional to @xmath121 vanish , but all the other terms remain because the mixing angle must not be equal to zero .",
    "the situation in this case is rather similar to the one in the sm extended by an extra singlet scalar @xcite .",
    "however , there are differences due to extra interactions between the higgs field and the singlet scalar in these models , arising from the scalar field potentials that are absent in our model .",
    "we would also like to note here that , if we formally put the parameters @xmath63 , @xmath83 and @xmath87 equal to zero , i.e. , consider the case of the zero mixing , lagrangian ( [ h - r - lagrangian ] ) becomes just the sm higgs lagrangian plus the usual lagrangian of the radion interaction with the sm fields via the trace of the sm energy - momentum tensor . in the case of a nonzero mixing , there are additional terms in this lagrangian that may lead to certain changes in the collider phenomenology of the higgs boson and the radion .",
    "these issues will be discussed in the next section .",
    "the effective lagrangian ( [ h - r - lagrangian ] ) describes the interactions of the higgs - dominated @xmath106 and the radion - dominated @xmath107 fields with the standard model fields and with each other . a few natural questions arise .",
    "what model parameter regions are allowed by the present - day experimental data such as lep and tevatron searches , higgs - like 125-gev boson discovery and the higgs signal strength measurements at various signatures at the lhc , and the limits from searches for the second higgs - like boson at the lhc ? is an interpretation of the observed boson as a radion - dominated state is still possible for some model parameters ?",
    "detailed answers to such questions require a corresponding detailed phenomenological analysis , which will be considered in a separate study . in this paper",
    "we present constraints coming from the discovery of a 125-gev higgs - like boson at the lhc , measurements of the signal strengths at various production channels and decay modes , and searches for heavier higgs bosons .",
    "the feynman rules needed for our study can be easily derived from lagrangian ( [ h - r - lagrangian ] ) and are given in the table in the appendix .",
    "we have omitted the terms coming from off - shell fermions since the corresponding contributions to physical processes are exactly canceled out by additional diagrams with contact four - point vertices coming from the first - order expansions in gauge couplings of the sm energy - momentum tensor trace as was proved in @xcite .",
    "the feynman rules have been implemented as a `` new model '' in a special version of the comphep code @xcite which also includes a routine for @xmath122 analysis of the higgs signal strength in a way similar to those used in papers @xcite .",
    "the next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) corrections are taken into account in the comphep computations and in the corresponding analysis by multiplying the involved vertices by correction factors for each model parameter point such that the partial and the total sm higgs decay widths and the higgs production cross sections in gluon - gluon fusion ( ggf ) are exactly equal to those presented by the lhc higgs cross section working group @xcite . because of the similarity of the higgs boson and the radion production and decay amplitudes including loops @xcite , the same correction factors have been used for the higgs- and the radion - dominated states .",
    "we examine two possible scenarios , where the observed 125-gev boson is either the higgs - dominated state or the radion - dominated state .      in order to understand how much room is left for the radion - dominated state ,",

    "as is well known , the main decay mode of the light radion is the decay to two gluons due to the anomaly enhancement .",
    "however , once the mixing with the higgs boson is included , the picture might be changed drastically because of the appearance of higgs - like couplings for the radion - dominated state proportional to @xmath128 and because of the influence of the higher scalar modes encoded in the parameter @xmath83 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig_2 ] , the behavior of the upper level of this parameter as a function of the radion mass and the mixing angle is illustrated .",
    "we recall that for @xmath129 the radion - dominated state is heavier than the higgs - dominated state , @xmath130 , and vice versa ( @xmath110 for @xmath131 ) , and therefore , for @xmath132 and for @xmath133 , the areas shown as zero plates are not allowed . if one takes a rather large mixing angle , for example , @xmath127 , the @xmath134 decay mode is dominating as shown in fig .",

    "however , an important difference is the presence of an extra coupling at low energies of the higgs - dominated field to the trace of the sm energy - momentum tensor originating from the coupling of this field to the heavy scalar states of the radion kk tower .    in order to study the physical consequences of the higgs - radion mixing in stabilized brane - world models , we derived the effective lagrangian and gave a qualitative description of the phenomena , taking consistent values for the masses , the coupling constants , and the mixing angle , which are useful for comparing the results of our calculations with the experimental data at the lhc .",
    "it turned out that , though the interaction of an individual higher excited scalar state with the higgs field may be weak , their cumulative effect on the higgs - radion mixing may be observable .",
    "if they give noticeable contributions to the parameter @xmath83 , it leads to certain changes in the collider phenomenology of the higgs boson .",
    "a similar contribution of the directly unobservable higher tensor kk modes to scattering processes was discussed in @xcite .    in the framework of this model ,",
    "we have studied two _ a priori _ possible scenarios : the scalar state discovered at 125 gev is either a higgs - dominated state or a radion - dominated state . in our analysis , we used measurements of the 125-gev higgs signal strengths by the atlas and cms collaborations and exclusion limits obtained in searches for heavy higgs - like states .",
    "our results show that the interpretation of the 125-gev scalar state as a higgs - dominated state is the preferred one , although the radion component in this state can be rather large . depending on the value of the radion coupling constant @xmath75",
    ", the allowed regions for the mass of the radion - dominated state have been found .",
    "it turns out that the radion - dominated state can either have a mass close to 125 gev or a mass close to the tev range .",
    "the allowed regions somewhat increase with the growth of the radion coupling constant @xmath75 .",
    "we have also shown that the interpretation of the 125-gev scalar state as a radion - dominated state is not completely excluded by the two leading signal strength measurements , though in this case the restrictions on the allowed masses of the higgs - dominated state are very stringent",
    ". the mass of the higgs - dominated state can be close to 125 gev , which is in accordance with our analysis of this state at 125 gev .",
    "thus , in the considered model the presence of two nearly degenerate states close to 125 gev is a very probable scenario .",
