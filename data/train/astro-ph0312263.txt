    "the lensed b0218 + 357 @xcite is one of the rapidly growing but still small number of gravitational lens systems with an accurately known time - delay @xcite .",
    "it is therefore a candidate to apply refsdal s method to determine the hubble constant @xmath4 @xcite . besides the time - delay and an at least partial knowledge of the other cosmological parameters ,",
    "only good mass models of the lens are needed to accomplish this task .",
    "no other complicated and potentially incompletely known astrophysics enters the calculation or contributes to the errors .",
    "since the cosmological parameters are believed to be known with sufficient accuracy now , e.g.  from the wmap project @xcite , the only significant source of errors lies in the mass models themselves",
    ". the difficulties in constraining the mass distribution of lenses should not be underestimated , but the lens method is still much simpler to apply than classical distance - ladder methods , where errors difficult to estimate can enter at each of the numerous steps .    the classical methods still fight with the problem of results which are incompatible within the formal error bars . the hst key project @xcite e.g.  obtains a value of @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) which is often used as a reference .",
    "it should not be forgotten , however , that other groups obtained results which are significantly different , even though the general distance ladder used is very similar .",
    "@xcite determines a value of @xmath7 ( @xmath6 ) , @xcite obtain @xmath8 ( 90% ) .",
    "the differences in the analyses are various , ranging from the correction of selection effects and the cepheid period - luminosity  relation to instrumental effects .",
    "the fact that a number of world - expert groups spent such an amount of effort but still do not agree on the final result proves how difficult the problems of distance ladder methods really are .",
    "see the references above for a discussion of possible reasons for the discrepancies .",
    "in addition we refer to @xcite for an extensive discussion of this subject and an additional result of @xmath9 .    after finishing a first version of this paper ,",
    "the analysis of the results of the first year of wmap observations have been published .",
    "although @xmath4 is not the primary goal of cmb observations , determinations of this parameter are possible with additional assumptions . assuming an exactly spatially flat universe ( @xmath10 ) and a cosmological constant for the ` dark energy ' ( equation of state parameter @xmath11 ) , @xcite obtain a value of @xmath12 .",
    "for different @xmath13 , the result for @xmath4 can be significantly smaller .",
    "the assumptions of @xmath14 and @xmath10 can only be dropped if additional information from other astronomical fields are included . with the local information from the 2df galaxy redshift survey @xcite , a constraint on @xmath13",
    "is obtained .",
    "wmap alone can constrain @xmath15 only weakly , leading to wide allowed ranges for the density of dark energy or matter . for a determination of all free parameters ,",
    "more astronomical data has to be included as discussed in detail by @xcite .",
    "the constraints for all cosmological parameters obtained from the combination of many data sets are very impressive , but it should be kept in mind that the situation now becomes similar to the distance ladder methods where model assumptions in many astrophysical fields are necessary , making realistic error estimates of the final result extremely difficult .",
    "therefore the more parameters that go into cmb models have accurate independent determination , the better .",
    "this allows the cmb analyses to concentrate on other parameters which can not be determined in any other way .",
    "taking these difficulties into account , we believe that the lens method is superior to most other methods not only in terms of the possible accuracy of @xmath4 but also , and not less important , in terms of estimating the possible errors reliably .",
    "we emphasize that the effort needed is small when compared with large projects like the hst key project or wmap plus 2df survey etc .",
    "the only serious problem when using the lens effect to determine the hubble constant lies in the mass models for the lenses which directly affect the resulting @xmath4 . to be able to constrain a mass model accurately , two conditions should be met .",
    "first , the lens should be simple by which we mean the galaxy should be normal without nearby companions and without a surrounding cluster . only in these cases",
    "can the mass distribution be described with confidence by a small number of parameters .",
    "second , as many observational constraints as possible should be provided by the system .",
    "advantageous is a high number of highly structured images .",
    "extended lensed sources and einstein rings can provide constraints for a wide range of positions and are therefore preferred to point - like multiple images . in the case of more than two images ,",
    "multiple time - delays can also be used as constraints for the mass model .",
    "in addition to these pure lensing constraints , additional information from stellar dynamics or surface photometry of the lens can be included in the modelling .",
    "radio loud lensed sources have the potential to provide a whole set of independent observational constraints additional to those provided by optical observations .",
    "flux ratios of the images are less affected by microlensing and extinction at radio wavelengths than optical ones .",
    "radio observations also have the advantage that they can reach much higher levels of resolution than in the optical .",
    "much smaller substructures in the images can therefore be detected and used for the lens models .",
    "the lens b0218 + 357 , discovered in the jvas survey @xcite , meets most of the criteria for a ` golden lens ' which allows an accurate determination of @xmath4 .",
    "the lens is an isolated single galaxy , and no field galaxies nearby contribute to the lensing potential significantly @xcite .",
    "the lens shows only two images of the core of the source , but substructure of the images can be used as further constraint .",
    "the main bonus is the presence of an einstein ring which shows a lot of substructure in detailed radio maps @xcite .",
    "this paper deals with utilizing the information from the ring to constrain the mass models and to determine @xmath4 .",
    "b0218 + 357  has only one disadvantage : it is the system with the smallest image separation known , which makes useful direct measurements of the lensing galaxy s position relative to the lensed images extremely difficult .",
    "since this parameter is of fundamental importance for the determination of @xmath4 , no reliable results have been possible so far .",
    "@xcite present a galaxy position which may be close to the correct value , but their error bars are highly underestimated as was already stated by @xcite .",
    "in this paper we will first discuss ` classical ' lens models which only use parametrized data of the compact images to constrain the models .",
    "we will see that with this approach the constraints are not sufficient to determine the galaxy position with any accuracy . to be able to determine the hubble constant",
    ", other information has to be included which is naturally provided by the highly structured radio ring .",
    "the best method available to utilize this information is lensclean@xcite . because the method in its original form has serious shortcomings which prevent its use in a system like b0218 + 357 , where the dynamic range between the compact images and the ring is very high , we had to improve the algorithm considerably .",
    "the lensclean  method itself is discussed in paper  i  @xcite while the results are presented here ( paper  ii ) .",
    "we will use the improved version of lensclean  to determine the galaxy position for isothermal models with an accuracy that is sufficient to achieve a result for the hubble constant which is competitive with other methods but avoids their possible systematic errors .",
    "possible deviations from isothermal mass distributions , which are the main source of systematic error when combining the results from many lenses , will be discussed by presenting a preliminary analysis of vlbi observations of the substructure of the images .",
    "these will allow us to constrain the radial mass profile for power - law models .",
    "we will learn that deviations from isothermal mass distributions do _ not _ play a major role in b0218 + 357 , because the constraints are already quite strong and in addition the effect on @xmath4 is in this special case , where the galaxy position is determined indirectly with lensclean , much weaker than in most other systems .",
    "we nevertheless discuss future work which will improve the results even more .    as a secondary result we will use our best lens models and newly developed methods to produce maps of the source plane as it would look like without the action of the lens .",
    "we will show the source as well as its appearance in the lensed image plane on scales from milli - arcseconds to arcseconds .",
    "finally we use lensclean  to shed some light on the question of scattering induced effective ` extinction ' in the a component of b0218 + 357  by comparing results for data sets of different frequencies .",
    "this paper  ii  as well as paper  i  are condensed versions of major parts of @xcite . for more details the reader is referred to that work .",
    "in the absence of an accurate position of the lens relative to the position of the lensed images there is no need to use very complicated and general lens models .",
    "the effect of the lens position shows its full impact already with simple standard models .",
    "we therefore restrict most of our work to isothermal elliptical mass models . to introduce the notation",
    ", we write the lens equation as @xmath16 the true source position @xmath17 is the image position @xmath18 shifted by the apparent deflection angle @xmath19 . in static single - plane lenses ,",
    "the latter can be written as gradient of a potential @xmath20 : @xmath21 we use this potential to parametrize the mass models .",
    "general power - law models have @xmath22 the radial power - law index is @xmath3 in the isothermal case .",
    "the arbitrary azimuthal function @xmath23 describes the asymmetry .",
    "mass distributions _ can be described by the formalism presented in @xcite or @xcite .",
    "we prefer the approximation of elliptical _ potentials _",
    "@xcite , which have practical advantages over the true elliptical mass distributions , because the inversion of the lens equation is possible analytically for elliptical potentials . for sufficiently small ellipticities ,",
    "both approaches are equivalent .",
    "a singular elliptical power - law potential ( ` siep ' in the isothermal case ) is given by @xmath24 for small ellipticities",
    "@xmath25 and moderate @xmath26 , this model corresponds to an elliptical mass distribution with axial ratio @xmath27 , or @xmath28 for isothermal models .",
    "we do not include external perturbations , because the external shear and convergence introduced by field galaxies and large scale structure are expected to be very small .",
    "@xcite estimate them to be of the order @xmath29 to @xmath30 , which is negligible in our context .",
    "the time - delay @xmath31 between images @xmath32 and @xmath33 is generally related to the potential and the apparent deflection angle in the following way : @xmath34 here @xmath35 is the redshift of the lens and @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the normalized angular size distances to the lens , source and from lens to source , respectively .",
    "isothermal models have an interesting analytical property , first described by @xcite . for fixed positions of the images relative to the mass centre ,",
    "the time - delay for given @xmath4 is uniquely determined and does not depend on any other parameters of the model , as long as the images are fitted exactly . in our case",
    "this means that , given the time - delay , @xmath4 for isothermal models can be calculated directly from the lens position @xmath39 using the equation @xmath40 the dependence of @xmath41 on @xmath39 is linear .",
    "these simple relations show the importance of measuring the lens position directly .",
    "once this position is known with sufficient accuracy , no explicit model fits are necessary , but the hubble constant can be derived directly from the positions of the images and the lens .",
    "the resulting hubble constant for isothermal models using the time - delay of @xmath42 @xcite is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : h0 ] as a function of @xmath39 .",
    "these values are calculated for a low - density flat universe ( @xmath43 , @xmath44 ) .",
    "they would be smaller by 5.5  per cent for an einstein - de sitter universe ( eds ) .",
    "we use a lens redshift of @xmath45 ( @xcite ; and others ) and a source redshift of @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "the older value of @xmath47 @xcite would lead to a 4.2  per  cent smaller hubble constant .",
    "included in the plot are estimates for the lens position from different sources .",
    "the optical positions from @xcite are clearly not accurate enough .",
    "the centre of the ring is relatively well defined , but it can deviate from the position of the mass centre by 003 or even more , depending on the ellipticity of the lens and the size and shape of the source .",
    "we will see later that the error bars of @xcite are underestimated significantly so that their result for the lens position can not be used .",
    "the alternative time - delay of @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) from @xcite is compatible with the result from @xcite which we used for our work because of the smaller error bars .",
    "the result for @xmath4 obtained from the @xcite time - delay would be 4  per cent higher .",
    "our first modelling attempts for b0218 + 357  followed the classical route of using only parameters of the two compact components as constraints .",
    "this is the same approach as presented in @xcite",
    ". we will learn that it is not possible to determine uniquely the lens position with this information .",
    "the results shown in this section were obtained using isothermal models because the ( small , see below ) deviations from isothermality are not of importance as long as the galaxy position is not known with high accuracy . once this parameter is determined with lensclean , constraints on these deviations as well as the impact on @xmath4 will be discussed in sec .",

    "the errors of this method are expected to be only small ( see also below ) but a combined fit of non - isothermal lens models to the vla and vlbi data should be aimed for in the future .      as explained in paper  i , lensclean  relies on a very robust method for the inversion of the lens equation . using the newly developed lentil  method implemented into lensclean , we were now able to perform a few tests with non - isothermal lens models .",

    "the scales are the same for lens plane and source plane .",
    "the contour lines start at three times the rms noise and double for each new level .",
    "the surface brightness levels in the lens plane and source plane maps are directly comparable .",
    "the magnified sections are marked by black rectangles in the vla maps .",
    "it is a generally accepted fact that the apparent flux ratio a@xmath76b changes systematically with the frequency at which it is measured . at the high end",
    "the value seems to reach its final value of 3.8 for frequencies @xmath77 . on the other",
    "end the ratio goes down to 2.6 at @xmath78 ( compare table  [ tab : flux ] ) . at even lower frequencies it is difficult to separate the compact emission from the ring which becomes more dominant at low frequencies .",
    "there is unambiguous evidence that the ism of the lensing galaxy is very rich and that optical and radio emission are affected to a significant degree @xcite .",
    "@xcite estimated the scattering measure from the broadening of image a relative to b ( taking into account the magnifying effect of the lens ) .",
    "they obtain a value of @xmath79 which is very high compared to typical lines of sight along our galaxy but comparable to lines of sight through the galactic centre .",
    "one possible explanation for the low flux ratios at low frequencies is therefore the action of the very rich ism of the lensing galaxy in front of image a. this can cause an effective extinction of a either by a high amount of scattering or by other physical effects .",
    "the refractive index of an interstellar plasma goes proportional to @xmath80 which would explain the stronger effects for larger @xmath81 .",
    "another possible explanation is a very strong frequency dependence of the source structure which would effectively result in a position shift along the jet for lower frequencies . because the spectrum of the jet is much steeper than the spectrum of the core , such an effect is not implausible .",
    "when the source is shifted in this direction , the situation becomes more symmetric and the magnification ratio decreases . for a sufficiently large shift ( @xmath82 ) the differential magnification gradient could",
    ", in combination with this frequency dependent source position , well explain the observed flux ratio changes .",
    "there are , however , strong arguments against this scenario .",
    "if the shift is as large as required , there should be significant differences in the appearance of the innermost components in vlbi maps at 8.4ghz ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and 15ghz ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but these maps look remarkably similar .",
    "both show two strong inner components with similar shapes and compatible relative positions .",
    "their separation of @xmath83 is far too small to explain the demanded shift by different spectral indices .",
    "if the shift is caused by another component which is not seen at 15ghz but becomes stronger at low frequencies , such a component should be detectable on a scale of @xmath84 to @xmath85 in the existing very deep 8.4ghz vlbi observations .",
    "@xcite do indeed detect more jet components but these are far too weak to account for a shift of the required magnitude .",
    "a more exotic alternative scenario would be refraction caused by large scale systematic trends in the column density of the lens galaxy s ism .",
    "to investigate the question of extinction and/or source shifts with lensclean , we compare our best lens models fitted to the 15ghz data which are known to be unaffected by both effects with a merlin data set at 5ghz .",
    "this multi - frequency data set was used to produce the maps in @xcite and is described in detail there .",
    "we used only the merlin part because the vla resolution at 5ghz is too low to be of any help here .",
    "unfortunately , this data set has some disadvantages for lensclean .",
    "while the resolution is better than in the 15ghz vla data , and the flux in the ring is higher due to the lower frequency , it was not possible to obtain reliable direct constraints for the lens model with lensclean .",
    "one problem is the possibility of extinction itself .",
    "another very serious problem is the frequency - dependence of the emission , which is different for the ring and the compact images .",
    "@xcite approximately corrected for this effect by first mapping the three frequencies independently .",
    "the clean  components responsible for the compact images were then subtracted from the data so that only the ring remains .",
    "the three data sets were rescaled in magnitude to obtain a consistent total flux density at all frequencies .",
    "finally , the compact components from the central frequency were added back to the complete data set .",
    "this process may introduce some distortions to the lowest and highest frequencies , because it combines data for the ring from these frequencies with data for the compact components from the central frequency .",
    "the combined data were then successively mapped and self - calibrated to obtain the final data set and map .",
    "we used the resulting @xmath86 data set as basis for our computations .",
    "the spectral index correction seems to work very well for making maps , but introduces errors in lensclean  which are not fully understood .",
    "this shows especially in incompatible results from the individual three frequencies and the combination of all three .    on the other hand",
    ", tests showed that the data can nevertheless be used to fit a subset of the lens model parameters if the other ones are fixed . at most three parameters",
    "can be determined accurately because they are already well defined by the two bright images alone and the ring is only a relatively small correction .",
    "we therefore used a variety of lens models compatible with the 15ghz vla data and fitted the same models to the 5ghz data set allowing for a relative shift of the two data sets and a possible extinction in the a image at 5ghz .",
    "these fits are much more robust than complete lens model fits from this data set alone . in particular",
    ", the results do not depend on which of the frequencies is used .",
    "the combination of all three also leads to the same result .    our strategy to determine shift and extinction works like this .",
    "first we took one of the best lens models from lenscleaning the 15ghz data .",
    "then we fixed all parameters but @xmath39 and made a fit with the 5ghz data including a ( for the moment fixed ) extinction in a. the difference between the two values of @xmath39 is then a measurement of the shift in the lens plane because in reality the lens should have the same position at both frequencies but the source may shift .",
    "we then varied the extinction to find the best value by minimizing the residuals .",
    "vla data.,width=302 ]    the results for one of the best vla 15ghz lens models are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vlarefit ] .",
    "the position of the minimum changes somewhat when other lens models still compatible with the 15ghz data are used .",
    "the most extreme values for the extinction are 15 and 35  per  cent ; most probable is a value between 20 and 30  per  cent .",
    "the data sets where initially registered to obtain the same position for the a image . the relative shift in the fit ( measured as a shift of the lens centre merlin @xmath52 vla , equivalent to a shift of the source by the same amount with opposite direction ) in the region of",
    "the minimum is negligible .",
    "the fact that the shifts in @xmath50 and @xmath51 have their zeros at almost the same extinction which itself is furthermore compatible with the residual minimum gives strong evidence that the real shift is indeed small and that the brightness of a at 5ghz is reduced by @xmath87  per  cent by some propagation effect , possibly scattering . for zero extinction",
    ", the required shift would be about @xmath88 eastwards , but the residual curve seems to be incompatible with this scenario .",
    "it seems as if extinction in a , caused by whatever physical process , accounts for a least most of the frequency dependent flux ratio .",
    "this has an important consequence for further modelling work .",
    "although the ring becomes brighter at lower frequencies , only high frequencies can be used in a simple way to fit lens models .",
    "observations at medium frequencies may on the other hand be used to study the propagation effects in the ism of the lensing galaxy in more detail now that the lens model is known with sufficient accuracy .",
    "b0218 + 357  is one of the most promising lens systems for determining the hubble constant with the method of @xcite .",
    "this method has , compared with other approaches , the advantage that it is a very simple one - step determination and relies on the understanding of only very little astrophysics . in this way the systematic uncertainties can not only be minimized but ( equally important ) also be estimated much better than in distance ladder methods which have their problems with several astrophysical processes at each step .",
    "the only serious uncertainty left is the mass distribution of the lens . in this respect b0218",
    "+ 357  is a close to optimal ` golden lens ' .",
    "the lensing galaxy seems to be a regular isolated galaxy without contributions from a group or cluster nearby .",
    "this not only avoids the inclusions of further parameters to describe the external mass distribution but also allows the assumption that the mass distribution of the galaxy itself is that of an unperturbed smooth ellipsoid .",
    "b0218 + 357  provides a wealth of potential constraints for the mass models in the form of highly accurate image positions , a measurable flux density ratio with probably negligible influence by microlensing , substructure on scales resolved by vlbi and a well resolved and structured einstein ring on the scale of the image separation .    without using the ring , ` classical ' lens modelling allows us to tightly constrain the ellipticity and mass of the galaxy as long as its position is known .",
    "the vlbi structure of several subcomponents along the jet in a radial direction relative to the lens allows us to determine the radial mass distribution with an accuracy not possible in most other lenses ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "this most important general degeneracy of the lens method can therefore be broken in the case of b0218 + 357 .",
    "the only real disadvantage is the small size ( @xmath89 ) of the system .",
    "b0218 + 357  is indeed the lens with the smallest image separation known to date .",
    "although the images and the lens are detected with optical observations , it was until now not possible to use these observations to accurately measure the galaxy position directly . _",
    "hst_/acs observations obtained recently are currently analysed to allow a first useful direct measurement .",
    "the model lens positions from @xcite are probably not too far from the truth and are indeed consistent with our results but their error bars are seriously underestimated .",
    "we have shown that , without using the ring , no useful estimate of the galaxy position and thus @xmath4 is possible .",
    "previous efforts have not utilized the most striking feature of b0218 + 357 , the beautiful einstein ring shown by radio observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "doing this is much more difficult than using parameters of compact components because the source itself has to be modelled as well , either implicitly or explicitly .",
    "the method best suited for this task is lensclean  which surprisingly has been used only for very few cases before .",
    "this is partly a result of the high numerical demands and partly of serious shortcomings of the original method as it was implemented by @xcite and @xcite . in paper",
    "i  we discuss the development of our new improved variant of lensclean .",
    "one of the most important improvements is the implementation of a new unbiased selection of components .",
    "the problem of determining the lens position is almost degenerate because the bright components , which contribute most of the signal , provide no information for this parameter .",
    "it is only the relatively weak and fuzzy ring which can be used as constraint . in other words",
    "the residuals have a very strong dependency on two directions ( defined by the compact components ) of the five dimensional parameter space but change only weakly in the other three directions as a result of the constraints provided by the ring .",
    "finding minima of functions like this is a numerically difficult problem and relies on the very accurate knowledge of the residual function .",
    "any numerical noise produces local minima which make the finding of the global minimum difficult .",
    "special care was therefore needed to produce the best possible results with the given limited computing resources .",
    "the modified lenscleanalgorithm was applied to a 15ghz vla data set resulting in good constraints for all parameters of an _ isothermal _ lens model , including the lens position of @xmath90mas , @xmath91mas relative to the a image .",
    "this model was then used to determine the hubble constant from the time - delay of @xcite to be @xmath92 .",
    "the error bars are @xmath49 confidence limits which for the hubble constant include the error of the lens position ( 6 per cent ) and the time delay ( 4 per cent ) . the accuracy for all other lens model parameters is much higher as long as the position is fixed .",
    "the value for @xmath4 is in agreement with the results from the _ hst _  key project @xcite and the wmap project @xcite but incompatible with the lower distance - ladder results of @xcite , @xcite or @xcite .",
    "recently , a series of papers was published by @xcite , see also @xcite , in which it is claimed that a number of gravitational lens time - delays is compatible with the hubble constant from the _ hst _  key project only if the mass concentration is as compact as the light distribution ( @xmath93 in the picture of power - law models ) .",
    "our result for b0218 + 357  does not confirm this view and does not give rise to a ` new dark matter problem ' since it is significantly higher than other results from lenses .",
    "our isothermal models lead to a value absolutely compatible with the one preferred in @xcite .",
    "one could now in a similar way compare with the lower @xmath4 results of @xcite , @xcite or @xcite .",
    "however , as long as the local determinations do not agree with each other , we consider such an exercise to be of only limited value .    rather than using locally measured values for @xmath4 to constrain lens mass distribution ,",
    "we prefer a more direct approach , either using the lens effect itself ( see below ) , or by including additional information .",
    "the latter approach is followed by thy ` lenses structure and dynamics ' survey lsd @xcite .",
    "the general idea is simple : the total mass within the einstein radius is well constrained by lensing , in contrast to the radial mass _",
    "profile_. for the given mass , the stellar velocity dispersion of the lensing galaxy depends strongly on this profile .",
    "the more the mass is concentrated in the centre , the deeper the potential well and the higher the velocity dispersion has to be . with some additional assumptions ,",
    "it is indeed possible to obtain valuable constraints which can then again be included in the lens models to determine @xmath4 . for the important system pg  1115 + 080 , @xcite obtain a power - law index of @xmath94 which increases the otherwise very low estimate of @xmath4 for this system to a value of @xmath95 ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "this steep mass profile is quite unusual and moves the galaxy significantly off the fundamental plane .",
    "nevertheless it is not as steep as the _ light _ profile and the result for @xmath4 correspondingly lies between the isothermal and constant @xmath96 model results of @xcite . for b1608 + 656 ,",
    "@xcite are able to constrain the mass profile of the main lensing galaxy quite well and find that it is consistent with isothermal .",
    "the resulting hubble constant is @xmath97 ( @xmath98 , inconsistent with the very low mean value of @xmath99 obtained by @xcite for isothermal models for a number of lenses , but consistent with our result for b0218 + 357 .",
    "however , b1608 + 656 has the major disadvantage of a second lensing galaxy very close to the primary .",
    "the two galaxies might even be interacting which could cause complicated deviations from usual galaxy mass distributions .",
    "these examples show that the general picture of lensing constraints for @xmath4 and mass profiles is not as consistent as it appeared not long ago ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in our opinion",
    "the only way to resolve the discrepancies is to try and use the best available constraints for all applicable lens systems individually .",
    "our work on b0218 + 357  shows this for one example , although there are still many open questions .",
    "our alternative way of constraining mass profiles relies on the lens effect alone and has the advantage that additional astrophysics ( galactic dynamics in lsd work ) and corresponding additional model assumptions are not needed , keeping the method simple and clean .",
    "it is easy to understand that lenses showing only two or four images of one compact source can not provide sufficient information to constrain the mass profile tightly , especially since quads usually have all images close to the einstein ring so that they probe the potential at only one radius .",
    "far better suited are systems with extended sources or at least with substructure in the compact images .",
    "b0218 + 357  is a good example which offers both .",
    "using our galaxy position as an estimate , non - isothermal power - law models could be constrained with the vlbi substructure . these are not the final results since no self - consistent fitting of all available data has been performed so far , but the weak dependency of the radial mass exponent @xmath26 on the galaxy positions shows that the estimate is nevertheless quite good .",
    "we learned that the mass distribution in the lens is close to isothermal ( which would be @xmath3 ) but is slightly shallower ( @xmath100 ) .",
    "preliminary calculations with lensclean  showed that the shift in the best lens position caused by this small deviation partly compensates for the expected scaling with @xmath72 for a fixed position .",
    "we therefore do not expect very significant changes of the result for @xmath4 from the slight non - isothermality in this system .",
    "a very conservative error estimate disregarding this compensation effect would be a possible 4  per cent error for @xmath4 .",
    "it has to be kept in mind , however , that all results presented so far depend on the assumption of a power - law for the mass profile ( and potential and deflection angle ) . for more general mass models the constraints on @xmath26 are still interesting , but they only measure the _ local _ slope of the profile rather than the global mass profile .",
    "it is expected that power - laws can be used as a very good approximation for more general models for limited ranges of radii , and our model fits confirm this view in the case of b0218 + 357 .",
    "the lensclean  results for the lens position presented here are therefore also valid for other mass profiles , but the value for the hubble constant may well have to be modified slightly .    the mass models discussed here do not include external shear because it seems to be very small .",
    "the expected true external shear of 12  per cent @xcite would change the result of @xmath4 by about the same amount at most . more difficult to estimate",
    "is the possible influence of differences in the ellipticity of the inner and outer parts of the lensing galaxy which can effectively also act as external shear .",
    "the possible impact of the remaining higher - order aspects of the mass profile degeneracies and the effects of multi - component mass models ( bulge+disc+halo ) are currently under investigation , especially the aspect of what apparent isothermality in the central part of the galaxy , which should be dominated by the luminous matter in the bulge , means for the true mass distribution .    in the future",
    "we will avoid the model fitting of vlbi components which are then used as constraints and instead use lensclean  itself also on the existing vlbi data that show a wealth of structure in the images ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : comp ] ) . to be able to use non - isothermal models with lensclean",
    ", we developed the new method lentil  for the inversion of the lens equation .",
    "with these two methods combined , a simultaneous fit of medium resolution vla data ( sensitive to the lens position ) and the existing high resolution vlbi data of @xcite , which are more sensitive to the radial mass profile , will not only improve the results for all parameters but will , by using self - consistent lens models , also provide realistic error estimates including all uncertainties .    to be able to use the 8.4ghz data",
    "set it will be necessary to include the extinction and scatter broadening in the a image in the models .",
    "this is possible because the 15ghz data are only little affected by extinction so that the combination of the two allows estimates of this effect .",
    "since the vlbi constraints for the lens models are mainly given by the positions of subcomponents but not by their size , which is relatively independent of the lens model , the different sizes of components in a and b can be used to obtain better constraints on the scattering measure than the simple estimates from @xcite .",
    "the application of lensclean  to the vlbi data will also show whether any significant amount of substructure in the mass distribution of the lens is needed to explain all features of the jet .",
    "the first results from @xcite seem to be compatible with no substructure , but a quantitative analysis can be done in the future . if significant substructure effects are present , it will also be necessary to correct the medium resolution data for them before using lensclean  to determine the galaxy position .",
    "clumps of matter close to one of the images could change the magnification significantly which would then mimic a different lens model .",
    "the analysis of the vlbi data will show whether this may be the explanation for the ( compared with some other lenses ) relatively high result for @xmath4 .",
    "lensclean  can also be used to study substructure from vlbi observations of other lenses .",
    "it will then be possible to do an analysis similar to e.g.  @xcite but without any assumption about the true source structure .    to improve the medium resolution side , we recently performed observations of b0218 + 357  at 15ghz using the fibre link between the vla and the vlba telescope pie  town .",
    "this combination provides a resolution 1.52 times better than the vla alone .",
    "the long track observation of the total accessible hour angle range of 14  hours also improves the sensitivity which in combination with the improved resolution can reduce both statistical and ( even more important ) systematical errors .",
    "simulations performed before the observations showed that an accuracy of about 12@xmath101 for the lens position should be achievable .",
    "this would in comparison to the existing data be an improvement of a factor of @xmath102 . the remaining uncertainty in @xmath4 from the lens position alone",
    "will then shrink to below 2  per  cent .",
    "possible uncertainties caused by calibration errors will also be reduced significantly .",
    "this new data set is currently being calibrated and will be analysed with lenscleansoon , alone and in combination with the vlbi data .    as a secondary result of lensclean  we presented maps of the brightness distribution of the source as well as improved lens plane maps , both produced with a method newly developed together with lensclean  in paper  i. this allowed the first view of b0218 + 357 s source as it would be seen without the distortion of the lens , but with improved resolution .",
    "the ring itself is caused by a bending jet which crosses the tangential caustic of the lens . in the future",
    "we will improve these results and also produce source plane polarization maps .",
    "the ring shows an interesting radial polarization pattern @xcite and the data will , when projected to the source plane , give us a very detailed and magnified view of the polarization structure in the jet of the source .",
    "finally we used lensclean  to investigate the puzzling changes of the flux density ratio a@xmath76b with frequency . to test the two theories of either scattering induced extinction caused by the ism in the lensing galaxy or of an effective shift of the source with frequency , we compared our best lensclean  models , which were fitted to 15ghz data where the fluxes are expected to be unaffected by propagation effects , with merlin data at 5ghz taking into account a possible relative shift and extinction in the 5ghz data .",
    "although the 5ghz data set has some calibration problems , the evidence for a significant extinction ( @xmath103  per  cent ) of the a component at 5ghz is very strong .",
    "the relative shift of the source between these two frequencies seems to be negligible .",
    "this work will be extended in the future by comparing medium resolution data sets at different frequencies in order to study the propagation effects in the lensing galaxy in more detail .",
    "observations with merlin at different frequencies will allow us to measure the position dependent faraday rotation and depolarisation , providing invaluable information about the ism of the lensing galaxy .    a direct measurement of the galaxy position in b0218 + 357  by",
    "_ hst_/acs observations will be available soon .",
    "the formal uncertainty of this measurement may be larger than the lensclean  model constraints but it will be an absolutely independent and therefore complementary direct measurement . the comparison will either confirm the lens models or give information about deviations of the true mass distribution from the relatively simple models .",
    "we will then reach the point were the uncertainty in @xmath4 is no longer dominated by the lens models but by the time - delay uncertainties themselves .",
    "a reanalysis of existing monitoring data @xcite and new monitoring campaigns will therefore allow further improvements .",
    "with all the constraints available now or soon and the simplicity of the possible mass models , b0218 + 357  has the potential to lead to the most robust measurement of @xmath4 of all time - delay lenses .",

    "<S> consisting of two bright images , which are well resolved in vlbi observations , plus one of the most richly structured einstein rings , it potentially provides better constraints for the mass model than most other systems . the main problem left until now was the very poorly determined position of the lensing galaxy .    after presenting detailed results from classical lens modelling </S>",
    "<S> , we apply our improved version of the lensclean  algorithm which for the first time utilizes the beautiful einstein ring for lens modelling purposes . the primary result using isothermal lens models is a now very well defined lens position of @xmath0mas relative to the a image , which allows the first reliable measurement of the hubble constant from the time - delay of this system . </S>",
    "<S> the result of @xmath1 is very high compared with other lenses . </S>",
    "<S> it is , however , compatible with local estimates from the _ hst _  key project and with wmap results , but less prone to systematic errors . </S>",
    "<S> we furthermore discuss possible changes of these results for different radial mass profiles and find that the final values can not be very different from the isothermal expectations . </S>",
    "<S> the power - law exponent of the potential is constrained by vlbi data of the compact images and the inner jet to be @xmath2 , which confirms that the mass distribution is approximately isothermal ( corresponding to @xmath3 ) , but slightly shallower . the effect on @xmath4 </S>",

    "<S> maps of the unlensed source plane produced from the best lensclean  brightness model show a typical jet structure and allow us to identify the parts which are distorted by the lens to produce the radio ring . </S>",
    "<S> we also present a composite map which for the first time shows the rich structure of b0218 + 357  on scales ranging from milli - arcseconds to arcseconds , both in the image plane and in the reconstructed source plane . </S>",
    "<S> finally we use a comparison of observations at different frequencies to investigate the question of possible weakening of one of the images by propagation effects and/or source shifts with frequency . </S>",
    "<S> the data clearly favour the model of significant ` extinction ' without noticeable source position shifts .    </S>",
