    "the main features of the @xmath6-mixing studies were explained in previous notes @xcite ( see also references cited therein ) , so we do nt need to repeat them here .",
    "instead we will try to give arguments that @xmath6-mixing phenomenon is indeed worthy to be studied .",
    "the famous russian painter casimir malevich said a long time ago : `` the object in itself is meaningless ... the ideas of the conscious mind are worthless '' .",
    "we would like to choose his great painting `` the black square '' , which is reproduced below , as a starting point of our introduction .",
    "( 100,30 ) ( 45,28)(2,0)25 ( 70,28)(0,-2)25 ( 70,3)(-2,0)25 ( 45,3)(0,2)25 ( 50,15.5)(2,0)15    but from this starting point it is possible to go to the very different directions depending from one s imagination .",
    "so let us imagine the following picture behind the black square @xcite :    `` a cat is penned up in a steel chamber , along with the following diabolical device : in a geiger counter there is a tiny bit of radioactive substance , that perhaps in the course of one hour one of the atoms decays , but also , with equal probability , perhaps none ; if it happens , the counter tube discharges and through a relay releases a hammer which shatters a small flask of hydrocyanic acid .",
    "if one has left the entire system to itself for one hour , one would say that the cat still lives if meanwhile no atom has decayed .",
    "the state vector @xmath7 of the entire system would express this by having in it the living and the dead cat mixed or smeared out in equal parts . ''",
    "but this is of course nonsense , at least from cat s point of view !",
    "we have reminded schrdinger s cat old story here in order to give an impression that although we all became familiar with particle mixing , because the superposition principle lies on a very background of quantum mechanics , this phenomenon is by no means obvious or trivial property of reality .",
    "but what is strange and queer at the macrophysics level can still appear as the most common thing at the microphysics level .",
    "it seems that even our existence is based on particle mixing as will be explained below .",
    "one of very important characteristics of elementary particle is its mass .",
    "we can get some insight about its origin from the following simple trick .",
    "the propagator of a massive fermion can be represented in such a way @xmath8 or graphically    ( 120,10 ) ( 15,5)(2,0)5 ( 21.5,5 ) ( 23,5)(2,0)5 ( 30,5.5)(2,0)2 ( 30,4.5)(2,0)2 ( 34,5)(2,0)5 ( 41,4)+ ( 46,5)(2,0)17 ( 52.5,6)(2,-1)4 ( 52.5,4)(2,1)4 ( 53,8)m ( 65,4)+ ( 70,5)(2,0)17 ( 76.5,6)(2,-1)4 ( 76.5,4)(2,1)4 ( 77,8)m ( 87,5)(2,0)17 ( 93.5,6)(2,-1)4 ( 93.5,4)(2,1)4 ( 94,8)m ( 106,4)@xmath9    where a single line represents the propagator of a massless particle .",
    "so things look like as if the massless particle is propagating through some medium and the mass emerges as a result of friction or interaction with this environment .",
    "but what is the medium the particle interacts with ?",
    "a ( massless ) fermionic particle can have the following interaction with some scalar field @xmath10 :    ( 120,20 ) ( 50,2)(1,2)2 ( 52,6)(1,2)2 ( 54,10)(-1,2)2 ( 52,14)(-1,2)2 ( 54,10 ) ( 54,10)(2,0)2 ( 58,10)(2,0)2 ( 62,10)(2,0)2 ( 66,10)(2,0)2 ( 70,9)@xmath11 ( 50,9)@xmath12    if now the self interactions of this scalar field are such that it does nt disappear in a vacuum state and develops a nonzero vacuum expectation value @xmath13 , when it is convenient to expand @xmath14 , where @xmath15 corresponds to the physical scalar particles ( excitations over the vacuum ) and @xmath13 just gives the medium ( the vacuum ) where all of us are living . now because of this decomposition of @xmath11 the fermion - scalar interaction splits into two parts :    ( 125,20 ) ( 10,2)(1,2)2 ( 12,6)(1,2)2 ( 14,10)(-1,2)2 ( 12,14)(-1,2)2 ( 14,10 ) ( 14,10)(2,0)2 ( 18,10)(2,0)2 ( 22,10)(2,0)2 ( 26,10)(2,0)2 ( 30,9)@xmath11 ( 10,9)@xmath12 ( 40,10)(2,0)10 ( 55,2)(1,2)2 ( 57,6)(1,2)2 ( 59,10)(-1,2)2 ( 57,14)(-1,2)2 ( 59,10 ) ( 57,11)(2,-1)4 ( 57,9)(2,1)4 ( 62,9)@xmath16 ( 83,9)@xmath17 ( 95,2)(1,2)2 ( 97,6)(1,2)2 ( 99,10)(-1,2)2 ( 97,14)(-1,2)2 ( 99,10 ) ( 99,10)(2,0)2 ( 103,10)(2,0)2 ( 107,10)(2,0)2 ( 111,10)(2,0)2 ( 115,9)@xmath15 ( 95,9)@xmath12    the second diagram represents an emission of the real scalar quantum and the first one generates the fermion mass @xmath18 .",
    "but if , for example @xmath19-quark can emit a scalar particle without changing its flavour , why ca nt it do this with changing the flavour ?",
    "we know that the flavour is not always conserved , so the following interaction is not excluded :    ( 125,20 ) ( 10,2)(1,2)2 ( 12,6)(1,2)2 ( 14,10)(-1,2)2 ( 12,14)(-1,2)2 ( 14,10 ) ( 6,2)@xmath19 ( 6,16)@xmath20 ( 14,10)(2,0)2 ( 18,10)(2,0)2 ( 22,10)(2,0)2 ( 26,10)(2,0)2 ( 30,9)@xmath11 ( 10,9)@xmath12 ( 38,10)(2,0)10 ( 55,2)(1,2)2 ( 57,6)(1,2)2 ( 59,10)(-1,2)2 ( 57,14)(-1,2)2 ( 59,10 ) ( 51,2)@xmath19 ( 51,16)@xmath20 ( 57,11)(2,-1)4 ( 57,9)(2,1)4 ( 62,9)@xmath16 ( 83,9)@xmath17 ( 95,2)(1,2)2 ( 97,6)(1,2)2 ( 99,10)(-1,2)2 ( 97,14)(-1,2)2 ( 99,10 ) ( 91,2)@xmath19 ( 91,16)@xmath20 ( 99,10)(2,0)2 ( 103,10)(2,0)2 ( 107,10)(2,0)2 ( 111,10)(2,0)2 ( 115,9)@xmath15 ( 95,9)@xmath12    but now the first term gives @xmath21 mixing ! as a result our initial @xmath19 and @xmath20 fields are no longer mass eigenstates ( the states with definite mass ) , instead their time development in the rest frame is described by the matrix schrdinger s equation ( @xmath22 ) : @xmath23 @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 mass eigenvalues are defined from the equations @xmath27 .",
    "it is obvious that the corresponding eigenvectors ( the physical @xmath19 and @xmath20 quarks ) are @xmath28    this particle mixing has one important observable consequence .",
    "if initially the weak transitions were possible only within the @xmath29 or @xmath30 pairs , now the intergeneration transitions @xmath31 and @xmath32 are also possible because , for example , the physical @xmath20-quark contains both @xmath19 and @xmath20 bare fields @xmath33 .",
    "thus @xmath34 transition is proportional to @xmath35 - sine of the so called cabibo angle .",
    "but we have three quark - lepton generations .",
    "so after the mixing the weak transitions are possible between any up and any down quarks .",
    "the amplitudes of these weak transitions are convenient to express as a @xmath36 unitary matrix .",
    "this kobayashi - maskawa matrix is a generalization of the cabibo angle and reveals a remarkable hierarchical structure @xcite @xmath37 here @xmath38 is a small quantity .",
    "so the intergeneration weak transitions are suppressed and this suppression is more strong for not neighboring generations .    if @xmath39 , the kobayashi - maskawa matrix is complex and violates @xmath40 .",
    "it is commonly believed today that this @xmath40-violation is an important ingredient in baryon - antibaryon asymmetry generation in the universe @xcite and so the source of our very existence .",
    "so far we were talking about particle mixing at quark level .",
    "but quarks are confined into hadrons and we can study quark - mixing only indirectly via hadron - mixing .",
    "@xmath41-meson system is very promising in this respect : because of a large mass of the @xmath42-quark we can enjoy an asymptotic freedom advantage of qcd and calculate strong interaction corrections , unlike , for example , @xmath43-meson system .    in the standard model",
    "the @xmath44 mixing originates from the following diagram ( and from the second one there intermediate up - quark and @xmath45 lines are interchanged )    ( 125,40 ) ( 17,29)@xmath42 ( 23,10)(2,0)10 ( 43,10)(-2,0)10 ( 43,10)(0,2)10 ( 43,30)(0,-2)10 ( 23,30)(2,0)10 ( 33,30)(2,0)10 ( 17,9)@xmath46 ( 43,10 ) ( 43,30 ) ( 43,10)(1,-2)2 ( 45,6)(1,2)3 ( 48,12)(1,-2)3 ( 51,6)(1,2)3 ( 54,12)(1,-2)3 ( 57,6)(1,2)3 ( 60,12)(1,-2)3 ( 63,6)(1,2)2 ( 37,19)@xmath47 ( 43,30)(1,2)2 ( 45,34)(1,-2)3 ( 48,28)(1,2)3 ( 51,34)(1,-2)3 ( 54,28)(1,2)3 ( 57,34)(1,-2)3 ( 60,28)(1,2)3 ( 63,34)(1,-2)2 ( 68,19)@xmath48 ( 85,29)@xmath49 ( 85,9)@xmath19 ( 65,10)(2,0)10 ( 75,10)(2,0)10 ( 65,10)(0,2)10 ( 65,30)(0,-2)10 ( 85,30)(-2,0)10 ( 65,30)(2,0)10 ( 65,10 ) ( 65,30 ) ( 52,24)@xmath45 ( 52,13)@xmath45 ( 39,33)@xmath50 ( 39,5)@xmath51 ( 65,5)@xmath51 ( 65,33)@xmath50    @xmath47 stands for any up quark .",
    "so @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 represents the loop integral .",
    "this integral diverges quadratically . but",
    "this divergence is harmless because the unitarity of the kobayashi - maskawa matrix ensures its cancellation in the sum : the unitarity means @xmath55 , therefore @xmath56\\ ] ] and these subtractions greatly improve the convergence .",
    "for example , in case of @xmath57-quark contribution , these subtractions lead to the replacement @xmath58    from this expression it is also clear that in fact just @xmath57-quark contribution is dominant for @xmath41-mixing , because of its extraordinary large mass .",
    "when argus made his measurement of the @xmath59-mixing @xcite , nobody thought that @xmath57-quark is so massive .",
    "so the result of this measurement appeared as a big surprise .",
    "we can even say that @xmath57-quark was discovered by argus , because the large @xmath59-mixing , observed by argus , is very difficult to explain without the existence of the @xmath57-quark with mass @xmath60 .",
    "we can infer from the above given diagram that even larger mixing is expected in @xmath6-system : @xmath61 } \\sim \\frac{1}{\\lambda^2 } \\sim 25\\ ] ] we see also that the relative magnitude of @xmath6 and @xmath59 mixings measures @xmath62 - one side of the notorious unitarity triangle @xcite . it is worthwhile to mention that this ratio is , to a great extent , free from hadronic uncertainties , which arise when we ask how quark and antiquark from the above given @xmath41-mixing diagram really form @xmath41-meson .    to summarize , the @xmath6-mixing studies are interesting , because they reveal a very fundamental underlying phenomenon - the generation of particle masses and mixing angles via the higs mechanism , the least understood thing in the standard model .",
    "because of heaviness of the @xmath42-quark and asymptotic freedom of qcd , the theory gives very definite predictions about expected @xmath6-mixing , hampered only from uncertainties due to our inability to solve qcd in the confinement region .",
    "but these uncertainties are also , to a certain extent , under control @xcite .",
    "the theoretical predictions involve such a fundamental property as the unitarity of the kobayashi - maskawa matrix ( the existence of only three generations ) .",
    "any deviation between the theory and experiment can lead to significant change of our present day picture of the elementary particle world ( recall the @xmath59-mixing story ) .",
    "the forthcoming atlas experiment sensitivity to the @xmath6-mixing covers the standard model prediction range @xcite .",
    "so it will either give one more conformation of the theory or will open a window into a physics beyond the standard model .",
    "we hope the above given considerations convinced the reader that the black square can hide a very reach content behind it .",
    "for example , reflecting about the schrdinger s cat we can end with the following picture of @xmath59-oscillations ( experimentally confirmed by argus @xcite )    escher1.jpg here    as we have already mentioned , more rapid oscillations are expected in the @xmath6 system .",
    "so if man eagerly stares on the black square he will at last distinguish the picture of @xmath6-mixing :    escher2.jpg here    the most impressive people can remark even a symbolization of the @xmath40-violation on this illustration : the nature for some reason makes an absolute difference between particle and antiparticle , not just the conventional difference between black and white .",
    "to observe the @xmath3-mixing in a real experiment like atlas and extract the corresponding @xmath5 parameter , which characterizes the @xmath64 oscillation frequency , you need to reconstruct @xmath6 meson and determine its decay vertex with great precision .",
    "two of the @xmath6 decay channels were considered for this goal up to now : @xmath65 @xcite and @xmath66 @xcite . for the second channel @xmath67 decay mode was used for the @xmath1 reconstruction .",
    "it was mentioned in @xcite that other decay channels of @xmath1 can be also used to increase signal statistics . in the present note",
    "we consider @xmath68 decay mode as one of the possibilities :    ( 150,110 ) ( 20,40 ) ( 20,40)(-3,-2)30 ( -8,17)*@xmath69 * ( 20,40)(2,1)40 ( 42,45)*@xmath70 * ( 60,60)(3,-1)15 ( 63,52)*@xmath71 * ( 75,55)(3,1)33 ( 110,65)*@xmath72 * ( 75,55)(3,0)35 ( 113,55)*@xmath73 * ( 75,55)(3,-2)35 ( 110,35)*@xmath74 * ( 60,60)(1,3)10 ( 65,90)*@xmath75 * ( 60,60)(2,3)20 ( 82,90)*@xmath74 * ( 60,60)(3,2)45 ( 100,90)*@xmath75 * ( 125,62)(3,15)[r ] ( 122,45)(3,30)[r ] ( 130,62)*@xmath76 * ( 130,56)@xmath77 ( 127,45)*@xmath78 * ( 127,39)@xmath79 ( 77,95)(25,4)[t ] ( 77,100)*@xmath80 * ( 87,105)(44,4)[t ] ( 87,110)*@xmath81 *    as it is clear from the table 1 below , this decay channel is quite promising if compared to the previously used @xmath82 .",
    "+ branching ratios and signal statistics for @xmath83 . +    [ cols=\"<,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     as we see , about 2570 reconstructed @xmath3 mesons are expected for @xmath84 integrated luminosity from @xmath66 channel when both of @xmath2 and @xmath85 modes are used for @xmath1 reconstruction .",
    "to them we should add 3640 @xmath3 mesons from @xmath65 channel @xcite .",
    "so in total we expect 6210 reconstructed @xmath3 mesons per @xmath86 integrated luminosity when all as yet considered decay modes are used .",
    "to extract the oscillation frequency , from m.c . or experimental asymmetry distributions , the so called amplitude fit method is useful @xcite . here",
    "we describe some refinements of this method .    in the amplitude fit method an asymmetry distribution @xmath87 is fitted with the cosine function @xmath88 in which @xmath5 is fixed and @xmath89 is the only free parameter . repeating the fit for different values of @xmath5 , we get @xmath90 distribution .",
    "this distribution is peaked at @xmath5 which corresponds to the true value of the oscillation frequency .",
    "the peak position in the @xmath90 distribution can be found with the help of the recently suggested `` quantum '' peak finding algorithm @xcite .",
    "the idea of this algorithm is based on the property of small quantum balls to penetrate narrow enough obstacles .",
    "so if such a ball is placed on the edge of some potential wall it will find its way down to the potential wall bottom even if the potential wall is distorted by statistical fluctuations .",
    "let us introduce instead of continuous @xmath5 some discrete parameter @xmath91 , say through @xmath92 .",
    "the transformation @xmath93 , which we call peak amplifier , is defined for selected discrete values of @xmath5 as follows @xmath94 and @xmath95 transition probabilities are determined by the initial @xmath96 spectrum @xcite @xmath97 } \\hspace*{2 mm } , \\label{eq3 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath98 normalization constant being defined from the @xmath99 condition .",
    "@xmath100 is a standard deviation ( error ) of @xmath96 as determined by the cosine fit .",
    "if now we apply this peak amplifier to the data after the amplitude fit we get the probability distributions shown on fig . 5 ( for @xmath101 ) and on fig . 6",
    "( for @xmath102 ) .",
    "as we see , the peak amplifier enables a clear determination of @xmath5 from the amplitude fit spectrum .",
    "to estimate the atlas sensitivity range for the @xmath5 measurement , the analogous procedure was used as in @xcite .",
    "amplitude fit is applied to the asymmetry distribution generated by monte - carlo program .",
    "the input parameters of this program , such as signal to background ratio , @xmath3 lifetime , proper - time resolution and dilution factors are the same as in @xcite , with the exception of the number of signal events , which was taken to be 6210 .",
    "the amplitude fit spectrum is further transformed using the peak amplifier transformation as described above . in the resulting @xmath103 spectrum",
    "the mean value of @xmath5 and its standard deviation is calculated considering @xmath103 as a probability density .",
    "the `` experiment '' is considered as successful if the measured @xmath5 value ( mean value of @xmath5 according to the @xmath103 distribution ) is within two standard deviations from the true @xmath5-value defined in the monte - carlo program .    for each @xmath5 point 1000",
    "such `` experiments '' were generated and the fraction of the successful `` experiments '' was calculated .",
    "the highest value of @xmath5 , for which this fraction is above 95% , is considered as a sensitivity limit for the atlas experiment .",
    "this limit was found to be about @xmath104 .",
    "this is almost the same number as found in @xcite .",
    "in fact the peak amplifier method does nt give a significant increase for the sensitivity limit , but it allows a more accurate @xmath5 determination , as is indicated by fig .",
    "6 , because the probability peak is much more narrow .",
    "7 shows the distribution of the @xmath5 values , found by the peak amplifier method , for 1000 `` experiments '' , generated with the `` true '' @xmath105 .",
    "so we are at the end of our investigation .",
    "our main conclusions are :    * @xmath0 mode enables a two fold increase in the signal statistics for the @xmath4 decay channel .",
    "* the atlas experiment can reach a sensitivity limit for @xmath5 as high as @xmath104 with the certainty .",
    "* @xmath0 mode can be used also for the @xmath106 channel . if the same increase in signal statistics is assumed , the total number of reconstructed @xmath6 events can reach @xmath107 per @xmath86 integrated luminosity . according to estimates from @xcite",
    "this will mean a sensitivity limit for @xmath5 about 46 .",
    "we began our story with the black square . here",
    "is one more black square image which illustrates the continues progress in the @xmath6-mixing studies .",
    "escher4.jpg here    this picture leads to a question about a meaning of the scientific progress , or even to a more general question @xcite `` what profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the sun ? '' . we refrain to give any other comment about this things because @xcite `` wo alle worte zu wenig wren , dort ist jedes wort zu viel '' .    nevertheless we do nt want to end with only black and white images of the @xmath6-mixing related stuff . with the very great imagination you can catch sight of the glorious full colour artist s view on the particle mixing behind the black square ( note the role of vertexing in emergence of this dream ) :    tigers.jpg here",
