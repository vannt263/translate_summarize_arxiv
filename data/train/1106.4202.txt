    "a strong mid - ir source , irc2 , has been long suspected to be the dominant energy source , but when observed at sub - arcsecond resolution , it breaks up into multiple peaks @xcite .",
    "moreover , mid - ir observations have recently shown that irc2 is not self - luminous , but is illuminated and heated by source  i @xcite .",
    "while it has been proposed that source  i is also ( externally ) heating the hot core @xcite , direct evidence is lacking and the kinetic temperature ( t@xmath2 ) of molecular gas within 1  from source  i is not known . tackling this uncertainty",
    "requires studies at radio rather than ir wavelengths , in order to penetrate the high column densities towards the hot core , and measurements of thermal rather than maser lines .",
    "ammonia ( nh@xmath0 ) is well suited to measuring t@xmath2  over densities @xmath14  @xmath15 .",
    "in particular , metastable transitions ( j = k ) are interesting because they are collisionally excited , thus different ( optically - thin ) transitions can be used to determine t@xmath2  via a rotational diagram analysis @xcite .",

    "high - excitation transitions observed at sub - arcsecond resolution enable us to map the gas density and temperature distribution with unprecedented precision .",
    "this has revealed hotter , denser material than previously derived from nh@xmath0  measurements .",
    "the temperature inferred from high-@xmath18 lines of ch@xmath0cn is 200 - 600k @xcite , consistent with our findings from nh@xmath0 .",
    "our analysis assumes optically thin transitions @xcite .",
    "hyperfine - structure satellite lines are outside of the bandwidths employed , hence direct estimation of optical depth is impossible .",

    "non - negligible optical depths in the lowest available transitions ( 6,6 for ortho ; 7,7 for para ) might systematically boost the derived temperatures .",
    "we argue otherwise that this is not the case .",
    "para - transitions yield higher temperatures than ortho - transitions , inconsistent with expectation of lower optical depth for ( 7,7 ) than ( 6,6 ) .",
    "moreover , rotation diagrams for individual pixels do not diverge from a linear trend for the lower ( j , k ) states .",
    "the first moment maps of ( 6,6 ) and ( 7,7 ) in figure  [ mom12 ] show that redshifted gas ( 7 to 14  km  s@xmath8 ) is located on the nw part of the heart - shaped structure , blueshifted gas ( @xmath410 to 0  km  s@xmath8 ) is concentrated towards the central part , while the ne lobe is around systemic velocity ( 0 to 7  km  s@xmath8 ) .",
    "the nh@xmath0  emission shows a velocity gradient southward from source  i towards the hot core center , where the largest values of velocity dispersion are also observed .",
    "unless we assume the presence of an additional embedded source in that location , this may indicate shock propagation in the hot core ( see sect .  [ discussion ] ) .",
    "interestingly , we identified a n - s velocity gradient ( @xmath545  km  s@xmath8 ) in the bipolar structure traced by high-@xmath18 nh@xmath0  emission in irc7 , where line - widths also appears enhanced .",
    "the n - s bipolar morphology , the velocity gradient in the elongation axis , and the line - width enlargement provide strong evidence of a low - velocity outflow associated with irc7 .",
    "our multi - transition measurements of nh@xmath0  emission enable the estimation of temperature and density of ( hot ) molecular gas at high - spatial resolution in the vicinity of source  i and the hot core .",
    "this complements the temperature distribution as a function of radius close to source  i inferred from radiative transfer modelling of sio masing gas @xcite .",
    "maser action in the disk / wind from source  i implies temperatures 1000 - 2000k inside @xmath7100au and temperatures of 400 - 1000k in the outflow at radii 100  au to 1000  au .",
    "a dust color temperature of @xmath7700  k is consistent with this finding @xcite . on the other hand , an nh@xmath0  temperature of @xmath7260  k toward source",
    "i implies that hot nh@xmath0 emission is not directly ( radiatively-)excited by source  i. one explanation of this apparent discrepancy could be that a high ultraviolet radiation field in the vicinity of source  i may dissociate fragile molecules like nh@xmath0  ( dissociation energy 4  ev ) , while enhancing gas - phase abundance of sio through grain sputtering .",
    "this would also explain the offset between source  i and the peak of high-@xmath18 nh@xmath0  emission .",
    "what is exciting the high - energy transitions of nh@xmath0 ?",
    "in fact , all known or suspected ( massive ) ysos in the region are offset from peaks in hot nh@xmath0  emission ( figure  [ mom0 ] ) , and there is no evidence of any other embedded objects heating the hot core in the radio @xcite , millimeter @xcite , and infrared @xcite .",
    "additionally , the color temperature distribution from mid - ir measurements shows a decreasing gradient from source  i to the hot core @xcite .",
    "we propose that the elevated gas temperatures measured from nh@xmath0  in the hot core are produced by shock - waves and not by stellar radiation .",
    "theoretical models suggest that nh@xmath0  might form through surface chemistry on dust grains and then be released in the gas - phase by the passage of shocks , either through hydrodynamic gas - grain interaction @xcite or shock - induced ir radiation @xcite .",
    "indeed , enhanced nh@xmath0  has been observed in the l1157 low - mass outflow @xcite , as well as towards a dense ( quiescent ) clump downstream from the high - mass protostellar jet hh 80 north @xcite .",
    "@xcite report also ortho - para enhancement in the l1157 outflow .",
    "several pieces of evidence corroborate the shock hypothesis in the orion hot core : the offset of hot nh@xmath0  emission peaks from known ( proto)stellar sources , the high t@xmath2 , the departure of the ortho - para ratio from the statistical equilibrium value ( 1.0 ; @xcite ) , and the high abundances of shock tracer molecules ( sio , so , so@xmath11 ) and common molecular constituents of interstellar ices ( c@xmath11h@xmath35cn , ch@xmath0oh , ch@xmath0cn ; @xcite ) .",
    "what generates the shocks ?",
    "recent studies report strong evidence that a dynamical interaction occurred @xmath7500  years ago between source  i and the high - mass yso bn @xcite . the stellar interaction resulted in high stellar proper motions for source  i and bn and possibly produced the fast bullet outflow traced by co and h@xmath11 @xcite . in this framework",
    ", it has recently been proposed that the hot core might have originated from the impact of a shock - wave onto a pre - existing dense core , driven by either the expansion of a dense bubble of material previously associated with bn and source  i @xcite and/or the fast bullets @xcite .",
    "data in figure  [ tkin_ncol]c , however , suggest another possibility .",
    "the relationship between the high column density gas as traced by nh@xmath0 , the source  i proper motion , and the source  i outflow as traced by sio emission @xcite together suggest that the source  i outflow drives compression and shocks in the surrounding medium .",
    "the relative narrowness of the sw outflow in close proximity of the column density peak is suggestive of ram pressure effects caused by the outflow and the yso proper motion .",
    "the more open ne lobe , its apparent symmetry about the flow axis , and its extension beyond the northern nh@xmath0 clump may indicate that the outflow is in front of or behind the dense gas , compressing it more along the line of sight .",
    "part of the mechanical energy of the outflow could be dissipated and contribute to gas heating .",
    "this is also consistent with the ortho - para ratio being larger in the nw - side of the ridge facing source  i.    detailed modeling , including shock - physics as well as dust / gas - phase chemistry , will be required to discriminate between different ( shock ) scenarios proposed for the hot core excitation .",
    "however , the shock velocities implied by different scenarios and inferred nh@xmath0  chemistry are suggestive .",
    "@xcite showed that shocks with velocities of 1050  km  s@xmath8  ( c - type ) efficiently sublimate ice mantles , ejecting volatile molecules intact and enabling efficient abundance enhancement .",
    "shocks with velocities @xmath5510  km  s@xmath8  would have just a diminished impact on grain - mantle evaporation and nh@xmath0  abundance enhancement , which weighs against the hypothesized slowly - expanding bubble ( 7  km  s@xmath8 )  value quoted in @xcite is divided by two for spherical expansion .",
    "] as the main mechanism for the hot core excitation .",
    "in contrast , fast bullets ( @xmath56  km  s@xmath8 ) would drive strong j - type shocks , causing grain sputtering and molecular dissociation .",
    "reformation of nh@xmath0  by gas - phase chemistry is possible but less likely on the short dynamical time of the region ( @xmath7500  years ) .",
    "nonetheless , existing models have not investigated chemical evolution behind j - type shocks .",
    "intermediate - velocity bullets traced by h@xmath11 ( 30 - 70  km  s@xmath8 ; @xcite ) could in principle drive c - type shocks and release nh@xmath0  as well as excite h@xmath11 emission , but the poor correlation between nh@xmath0  and mid - ir / h@xmath11 emission @xcite argues against this possibility .",
    "we note that the impact of outflow from source  i ( 20  km  s@xmath8 ) in combination with proper motion of 12  km  s@xmath8could efficiently heat the hot core with limited molecular dissociation .",
    "@xcite reported an anticorrelation of methyl - formate and h@xmath11 in the hot core and proposed a similar mechanism for its excitation .",
    "extinction could however be responsible for the observed anticorrelation .    in summary",
    ", we suggest that local mechanical interaction of source  i with the orion hot core is more likely to be responsible for enhanced nh@xmath0  abundance and heating of gas in the core than the consequence of the hypothesized explosive event tied to the protostellar dynamical interaction .",

    "<S> using the expanded very large array , we have mapped the vicinity of the orion bn / kl hot core with sub - arcsecond angular resolution in seven metastable inversion transitions of ammonia ( nh@xmath0 ) : ( j , k)=(6,6 ) to ( 12,12 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this emission comes from levels up to 1500  k above the ground state , enabling identification of source(s ) responsible for heating the region . </S>",
    "<S> we used this multi - transition dataset to produce images of the rotational / kinetic temperature ( t@xmath1/t@xmath2 ) and the column density n@xmath3  of nh@xmath0 for ortho and para species separately and on a position - by - position basis . </S>",
    "<S> we find t@xmath1  and n@xmath3  in the range 160@xmath4490  k and @xmath5  @xmath6 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> our spatially - resolved images show that the highest ( column ) density and hottest gas is found in a northeast - southwest elongated ridge to the southeast of source  i. we have also measured the ortho - para ratio of ammonia , estimated to vary in the range 0.9 - 1.6 . </S>",
    "<S> enhancement of ortho with respect to para and the offset of hot nh@xmath0  emission peaks from known ( proto)stellar sources provide evidence that the nh@xmath0  molecules have been released from dust grains into the gas - phase through the passage of shocks and not by stellar radiation . </S>",
    "<S> we propose that the combined effect of source  i s proper motion and its low - velocity outflow impinging on a pre - existing dense medium is responsible for the excitation of nh@xmath0  and the orion hot core . finally , we found for the first time evidence of a slow ( @xmath75  km  s@xmath8 ) and compact ( @xmath71000  au ) outflow towards irc7 . </S>"
