    "the first experimental observation of bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) in 1995 @xcite is one of the great achievements of modern science .",
    "this milestone achievement has been motivated many theoretical and experimental works @xcite including creation and propagation of matter - wave solitons @xcite .",
    "solitons in a bec are traditionally produced by changing the sign of atom - atom scattering length ( @xmath0 ) from positive to negative values or vice versa with the help of magnetic @xcite or optical @xcite feshbach resonances ( frs ) .",
    "these frs either individually or a combination @xcite of them offer an additional flexibility to obtain spatial variation of the scattering length and thereby introduces spatially inhomogeneous nonlinear interaction in the condensate .",
    "becs with such nonlinear interactions have become systems of considerable current interest since it is expected that these systems may help to understand the dynamics of solitons emission which will be useful to construct atom laser @xcite . in view of this , some theoretical works have been done on the existence , stability and localization of matter - wave solions in single -component @xcite as well as two - component @xcite becs with spatially spatial inhomogeneous atomic interaction .",
    "a bec can also be loaded in periodic potentials .",
    "these potentials , often called optical lattices ( ols ) , are generally created by interfering two counter propagating laser beams @xcite .",
    "the geometry and depth of the ol can be completely controlled @xcite to create a large variety optical potentials .",
    "studies in the dynamics of bec solitons in periodic potentials with different spatially inhomogeneous atomic interaction have received a great deal of attention .",
    "depending on the spatial variation of the atomic interactions , this system shows some new and interesting phenomena .",
    "for example , a localized state of becs loaded in ols can undergo delocalized transitions @xcite when the atomic interaction is made to vary periodically in space .",
    "this inhomogeneous interaction helps a bec in ols to support gap solitons in the upper half of the forbidden gap even when @xmath1 , the background atomic scattering , vanishes @xcite .",
    "a special feature of a bound state in a bec with localized inhomogeneous interaction is that it can contain any arbitrary number of solitons @xcite .",
    "moreover , the potential arising from the spatially inhomogeneous atomic interaction may help a bec to support bright as well as dark soliton solutions @xcite .",
    "recently , sakaguchi et al investigated the existence , stability and mobility of solitons in single - component becs for spatial periodically modulated nonlinearity @xcite . for two - component becs studies on the stability properties of solitons in ols with spatially periodic interatomic and inter - species interactions",
    "have also been made in @xcite .",
    "the object of the present paper is to study the dynamics of matter - wave solitons in ols with spatially localized ( gaussian ) nonlinear interactions within the framework of variational approach . in particular , we work with a cigar - shaped bec and make use of a potential model to investigate effects of the optical lattice wave number as well as width of the gaussian nonlinearity on localization of the bec soliton . in addition , we examine that the stable fundamnetal gap soliton supported by the system satisfy an anti vakhitov - kolokolov criterion .",
    "the mean - field dynamics of a cigar - shaped bec is satisfactorily described by means of a quasi - one - dimensional ( q1d ) gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation @xcite .",
    "the gp equation for a cigar - shaped bec in optical lattices is given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the order parameter which is normalized to the total number of atoms @xmath4 in the condensate and @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the quantities @xmath6 and @xmath7 stand for the strength and wave number of the ol respectively .",
    "in @xmath8 we have measured length ( @xmath9 ) , time ( @xmath10 ) in the units of @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "understandably , @xmath13 refers to frequency of the transverse harmonic confinement that produces the cigar - shaped bec and @xmath14 with @xmath15 , the atomic mass .    as noted above , the mean - field atomic interaction @xmath16 in @xmath8",
    "can be varied spatially only by changing the s - wave scattering length @xmath0 .",
    "experimentally , this is achieved by using a proper detuned laser light in the vicinity of the frs .",
    "the dependence of @xmath0 on the spatial coordinate @xmath9 is given by @xcite @xmath17 where , @xmath18 is the intensity of the laser light and @xmath1 stands for the scattering length in the absence of the light .",
    "the quantities @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the constants which depend on the detuning parameter @xmath21 of the laser .",
    "clearly , such variation of @xmath22 will make @xmath16 in @xmath8 space - dependent . for a large detuning laser beam having gaussian intensity variation",
    ", @xmath16 can be written as @xmath23 , \\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the width of the gaussian profile and , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the constants . equation @xmath8 with @xmath16 in @xmath27 will provide the governing equation for a cigar - shaped bec in ols having spatially localized nonlinear interaction .    in section @xmath28",
    "we present a variational formulation using a gaussian ansatz and derive equations for the parameters of the trail solution with the help of ritz optimization procedure . in section",
    "@xmath29 we construct a potential model from the newtonian equation for the center of the trial solution and analyze how the effective potential changes with the variation of @xmath30 the wave number of the ol and @xmath31 width @xmath32 of the laser beam of gaussian intensity variation . in both cases , we focus our attention on whether the width of the soliton exceeds the period of the lattice or not . in section",
    "@xmath33 we consider the dynamics of the condensates in the effective potential .",
    "in particular , we study time evolution of the center and velocity of the soliton within the framework of a variational formulation and simultaneously perform a purely numerical calculation to examine stability as well as to verify the result obtained from the variational approach . in section",
    "@xmath34 we envisage a study on the existence and stability of fundamental gap soliton in a bec with spatially localized atomic interaction . finally , in section @xmath35 we make some concluding remarks .",
    "the initial boundary value problem in @xmath8 can be restated as the variational problem @xmath36 the lagrangian density @xmath37 of @xmath8 obtained from @xmath38 is given by @xmath39 here @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the solution of a self - focussing nonlinear schrdinger equation is a @xmath42 function @xcite .",
    "the shape of a gaussian function is almost identical with a @xmath42 function .",
    "therefore , in our variational formulation we adopt a gaussian function as a trial solution @xcite of @xmath8 . to include the effects ol and spatial inhomogeneous nonlinearity we make parameters of the trial solution time - dependent and thus introduce @xmath43}\\,e^{\\left[i\\,\\dot{s}_0\\left(s - s_0(\\tau))\\right)+i\\ , \\phi(\\tau)\\right]},\\ ] ] as the variational ansatz for the problem . in @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 represent amplitude , center of mass and phase of the solitonic solution and also act as variational parameters in our formulation .",
    "understandably , @xmath48 and @xmath49 stand for the width and velocity of the soliton .",
    "now we shall make use of the ritz optimization procedure @xcite to obtain equations for the variational parameters . in this optimization procedure , the first variation of the variational functional is made to vanish within a set of suitably chosen trial functions .",
    "understandably , the variational functional for the problem considered here is the so - called effective lagrangian density . inserting @xmath44 in @xmath50 and then integrating the resulting equation over @xmath9 from @xmath51 to @xmath52 we get @xmath53 as the effective lagrangian density . from the vanishing conditions of the variational derivatives of @xmath54 with respect to @xmath55 , @xmath45 and @xmath56",
    ", we obtain the following equations .",
    "@xmath57 = 0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath58    and @xmath59 = 0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    clearly , these equations show how the parameters of the lattice and a bec soliton are related with each other .",
    "it is interesting to note that the equations in @xmath60 provide a natural basis to study the dynamics of the solitons .",
    "for example , @xmath61 is a newtonian equation that describes the evolution of the soliton s center in the presence of localized nonlinearity and an ol while @xmath62 represents an amplitude equation which shows that during evolution number of atoms @xmath4 in the soliton remains constant since normalization condition of @xmath44 gives @xmath63 . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath64 describes the phase evolution of the condensate . in view of this",
    ", we shall judiciously make use of @xmath60 to construct an effective potential for the soliton and then study their dynamics for different environment of the effective potential .",
    "potential model is one of the simplest analytical models that may be used to understand dynamics of optical as well as bec solitons @xcite .",
    "in fact , this model is employed to calculate an effective potential for a moving soliton by drawing an analogy with the equation of motion of a classical particle .",
    "the effective potential of the soliton obtained from @xmath61 is given by @xmath65 for homogeneous nonlinear interaction ( @xmath66 ) @xmath67 in @xmath68 gives a periodic potential .",
    "the spatial extension of this potentail depends on @xmath69 . on the other hand , the presence of spatially inhomogeneous interaction ( @xmath70 gives rise to an effective potential ( second term in @xmath67 ) the effect of which is likely to depend on the spatial width ( @xmath24 ) of the ( gaussian ) nonlinearity .",
    "when the spatial inhomogeneous atomic interaction acts in a bec loaded in an optical lattice , then such an interaction will tend to change both the shape and magnitude of the trapping potential arising from the optical lattice .",
    "therefore , the relative values of @xmath69 and @xmath24 may be expected to have considerable effects on @xmath67 and thus on the dynamics of the solitons .    with a view to get a physical feeling from @xmath67 on the behaviour of the soliton due to interplay between the optical lattice and spatial nonlinearity , we consider two cases , namely , ( i ) @xmath71 and ( ii ) @xmath72 . in both @xmath30 and @xmath31",
    "we shall focus on whether @xmath73(= soliton s width ) or @xmath74 .",
    ", @xmath75,@xmath76 , @xmath77 and for @xmath78 @xmath79(dashed ) , @xmath80(dotted ) , @xmath81(dot - dashed ) and @xmath82(solid).,width=377 ]    for the first case , the variation of @xmath67 as a function of @xmath83 for different @xmath69 values corresponding to @xmath73 is displayed in figure @xmath84 . in this figure ,",
    "the dashed , dotted , dot - dashed and solid curves show @xmath67 with @xmath75 , @xmath77 and @xmath76 for @xmath85 and @xmath82 respectively .",
    "the variational approach followed by us shows that the amplitude of the soliton remains constant with time . in view of this , we shall work with a constant values of @xmath86 , namely , @xmath28 . from figure",
    "@xmath84 we see that each curve for the effective potential consists of two distinct parts . a deep potential well around @xmath87 and a periodic potential with smaller amplitudes on either sides of the well",
    ". clearly , periodicity of the effective potential increases as @xmath69 increases . with the increase of @xmath69 , @xmath88 begins to deform near the well due to interplay between the ol and spatially localized atomic interaction .",
    "particularly , for @xmath89 there appears two peaks ( dotted line ) , the amplitudes of which depend on @xmath69 . as @xmath69 increases amplitudes of these peaks decrease ( dot - dashed line ) . for @xmath90 , amplitude of these peak ( solid curve ) becomes too low that a soliton with sufficient energy initially situated at the minima near the well may cross the peak and will begin to move inside the well .    on the other hand , the variation of @xmath67 as a function of @xmath83 with @xmath91 for different @xmath69 values corresponding to @xmath92 displayed in figure @xmath28 .",
    ", @xmath75,@xmath76 , @xmath77 and for different values of @xmath69 , namely , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "clearly , all curves merge and form a single curve.,width=321 ]    this figure shows that the curves for different @xmath69 coincide and appear to form a single curve with only a deep well around @xmath87 . clearly , the effects of the ol is almost negligible . as a result , we have only a potential well produced due to the localized nonlinear interaction . since our aim in this paper is to study combined effects of the ol and spatially localized atomic interaction , we shall have to work with @xmath92 .",
    "note that the potential curve in figure @xmath28 has a minimum at @xmath87 .",
    "so , one may expect that the soliton in this case may also be stable there .",
    "we have verified that the optical trap is unable to confine such solitons and thus they are unstable .    , @xmath75,@xmath76 , @xmath90 and for @xmath93 @xmath94(dotted ) , @xmath95 ( dashed ) and @xmath84 ( solid).,width=321 ]    in view of the above , for @xmath71 we consider only the case @xmath73 . in this case , the plot of @xmath67 as a function of @xmath83 for different values of @xmath24 is shown in figure @xmath29 . here , values of the other parameters are kept same as those used in figure @xmath84 but @xmath90 . in this figure ,",
    "the dotted , dashed and solid curves give variations of @xmath67 for @xmath96 , @xmath95 and @xmath84 respectively .",
    "clearly , all the curves represent periodic potentials with local minima at @xmath87 .",
    "these local minima are separated by potential barriers from the minima of lattice potential .",
    "interestingly , the depth of the intermediate ( the central minimum ) well introduced by the inhomogeneous interaction increases as @xmath24 increases . but as @xmath24 increases the heights @xmath97 of these barriers decrease . at @xmath77 ,",
    "the value of @xmath98 becomes so small that the soliton with sufficient initial energy can cross the barrier and enter into the well .",
    "therefore , it is clear that the crossover from a lattice minimum to the interaction energy minimum can also be taken place with the variation of laser - beam width .",
    "the potential curves we have portrayed above are the effective potentials for the soliton in a single - component bec where all the atoms are in the same hyperfine state .",
    "however , it has also been possible to confine atoms of different hyperfine states or different species in a single trap leading to a two - component bec @xcite .",
    "in addition to inter - atomic interactions in a single - component bec , the interaction between the atoms of different component ( inter - species ) in the two - component bec has come into play . as a result , the effective potential for a component soliton in a coupled bec will be affected due to this inter - species interaction .",
    "it is of interest to note that the effective potential in figure @xmath84 has some similarity with the effective potential for the separation between of centers of the solitons in a two - component bec with optical lattices @xcite .",
    "for example , the @xmath67 in both cases consists of two parts , ( i ) a deep potential well and ( ii ) oscillatory wings on either side of the well .",
    "interestingly , source of the periodic part of the effective potentials for two interacting solitons as well as for the soliton in the present case is same .",
    "however , origin the well in effective potentail in two cases are different . in the present case",
    ", this well ( figure @xmath84 ) appears due to presence of spatially localized inter - atomic interaction . on the other hand ,",
    "it is shown in refs . @xmath99 and",
    "@xmath100 that the same well in the effective potential arises due to mutual interaction between the condensates .",
    "therefore , the mutual interaction between the solitons in a coupled condensates may reasonably be approximated by a spatially localized interaction .",
    "whatever the origin of the well in @xmath67 , we see that the response of solitons to the variation of soliton and lattice parameters in both cases is almost same . for example , the solitons in both cases can be forced to move in localized / mutual interaction region only by varying the wave number @xmath69 .",
    "a soliton of a relatively larger width appears to experience an effective potential ( figures @xmath28 , a potential having no oscillatory wings ) similar to the potential that arises due to only mutual interaction between the solitons in a coupled bec .",
    "therefore , the system considered here may server to a certain extend as an useful model to get some realization on the behaviour of coupled solitons loaded in ( linear or nonlinear ) optical lattices .",
    "however , to confirm this remark we shall have to study dynamics of the soliton for different environments of the effective potential .",
    "we have seen that the bright soliton in a bec with spatially localized nonlinearity , loaded in ols experiences an effective potential @xmath67 which consists of two parts , ( i ) a deep well around @xmath87 and ( ii ) oscillatory wings on either side of the well .",
    "clearly , the well arises due to the inhomogeneous nonlinearity while the oscillation in @xmath67 due to the ol .",
    "we also pointed out that the variation of wave number @xmath69 of the ol as well as width @xmath24 of the gaussian nonlinearity deforms @xmath67 considerably only near the well at @xmath87 .",
    "therefore , it will be an interesting curiosity to investigate how the soliton responses to such deformed periodic potential . to visualize this , we solve the ordinary differential equation in @xmath61 using runge - kutta method for different values of @xmath83 and @xmath101 at @xmath102 and calculate density profiles of the solitons .",
    "we also solve gp equation in @xmath8 using a purely numerical routine to verify the result obtained from variational calculation .",
    "in particular , we shall make use of crank - nicholson method to solve @xmath8 with the conditions @xmath103 $ ] , @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "note that the numerical calculation of @xmath8 not only serves as a supplement of the result obtained on the basis of a variational approach but also explicitly show whether the density profile will decay or not with time parameter @xmath10 .",
    "the effective potentials ( @xmath67 ) shown in figures @xmath8 and @xmath27 are equivalent in the sence of their shapes .",
    "the only exception is that in the first case the deformation in @xmath67 arises with @xmath69 while in the later it is due to variation of @xmath24 . in view of this",
    ", we consider only figure @xmath84 ( solid curve ) to calculate different data required in calculating density profiles @xmath106 .",
    "the influence of the inhomogeneous interaction on lattice potentials is prominent near @xmath87 . in order to visualize the effects arising due to interplay between the nonlinearity and lattice on the condensate",

    "therefore , the trial solution for the gap soliton can also be adopted as @xmath137 where variational parameters @xmath4 and @xmath138 are respectively the amplitude and width of the soliton . integrating the equation obtained by inserting @xmath139 in @xmath140 over @xmath9 from @xmath51 to @xmath52 we get the averaged lagrangian @xmath141 in the form @xmath142 from the vanishing conditions of @xmath143 and @xmath144 we get @xmath145 and @xmath146 for @xmath147 , @xmath148 and @xmath149 give @xmath150 and @xmath151 now , we make use of @xmath152 and @xmath153 to draw the band gap spectrum . the band - gap diagram for @xmath154 is displayed in figure @xmath155 .    .",

    "solve @xmath133 with the initial conditions @xmath157 and @xmath158 . here",
    ", we have used @xmath159 and @xmath160 .",
    "clearly , the value of @xmath132 lies in the first gap ( figure @xmath155 ) .",
    "the result obtained form the numerical integration of @xmath8 is shown in figure @xmath161 .",
    "we are interested to fundamental gap solitons in a bec with repulsive atomic interaction i.e , with positive @xmath162 values . in view of this , we plot in figure @xmath163 @xmath164 as a function of @xmath9 for @xmath165 and @xmath166 .    , @xmath154 with strength of repulsive atomic interaction @xmath167 @xmath165 and @xmath166 ( solid curve ) and @xmath113 @xmath168 and @xmath169 ( dotted curve),title=\"fig:\",width=283 ] , @xmath154 with strength of repulsive atomic interaction @xmath167 @xmath165 and @xmath166 ( solid curve ) and @xmath113 @xmath168 and @xmath169 ( dotted curve),title=\"fig:\",width=283 ]    here , the solid curve represents @xmath164 while the dashed curve serves as a guide of the lattice potential .",
    "we have noted that the spatially localized atomic interaction have some effects on the effective potential for the bright solitons . with a view to examine effects of the localized interaction on the fundamental gap soliton",
    "we make @xmath170 , arising background scattering length @xmath1 . in this case , the density profile obtained from numerical integration of @xmath133 is portrayed in figure @xmath171 .",
    "the dotted curve in figure @xmath171 clearly shows that the density profile here is also localized .",
    "interestingly , such localized wave exists only for relatively higher @xmath26 values , namely , @xmath172 .",
    "therefore , a bec in ols with spatially localized nonlinear interaction may support quasi - gaussian shaped solution .    up to now",
    "it is not clear whether the fundamental gap solitons discussed above are stable or not . in order to examine stability of such localized states",
    "we make use of vakhitov - kolokolov criterion @xcite . according to this criterion localized nonlinear wave like soliton will be stable if @xmath173 .",
    "however , studies on fundamental gap soliton reveal that such solitons are linearly stable as long as @xmath174 @xcite .",
    "understandably , the generalized vakhitov - kolokolov ( vk ) criterion is `` inverted '' for a stable fundamental gap soliton .",
    "this inverted vk criterion has also been explained by the approximation based on the averaging method @xcite .",
    "here we shall exploit variational method to justify stability of the profiles portrayed in figures @xmath163 and @xmath171 and also to verify inverted vk criterion for the gap soliton considered .    from @xmath148 and @xmath149",
    "we can obtain @xmath175 in figure @xmath133 we plot @xmath176 as a function of @xmath138 for @xmath77 and @xmath154 .",
    "in particular , the solid curve shows @xmath176 in presence of both homogeneous and inhomogeneous atomic interactions ( @xmath177 and @xmath178 ) while the dotted curve gives similar plot for @xmath170 but @xmath178 .     as a function of @xmath138 for ( i ) @xmath165 and @xmath166 ( solid curve ) and ( ii ) @xmath170 and @xmath169 ( dotted curve),width=321 ]    both",
    "the curves in this figure clearly show @xmath176 has a positive maximum value at @xmath179 ( indicated by vertical line ) . on either sides of @xmath179 , the value of @xmath176 gradually decreases .",
    "sivan et al @xcite showed that the solitons are more stable at the maximum value of @xmath176 .",
    "therefore , the fundamental gap solitons considered here are stable if their width @xmath180 . from the figures @xmath163 and @xmath171 , we see that the width of density profiles of the fundamental gap solitons obtained from direct numerical calculations have width @xmath181 and thus they are stable .",
    "understandably , the positive value of @xmath176 implies that the stable fundamental gap soliton in the presence of spatially localized interaction also satisfy `` inverted '' vakhitov - kolokolov criterion .",
    "recently , a physical mechanism of scattering of the gap solitons in the presence of linear gaussian impurity has been reported in @xcite .",
    "in particular , they observe the occurrence of repeated reflection , transmission , and trapping regions due to resonance of the linear impurity mode with gap solitons .",
    "our study on the existence of gas soliton in the presence of nonlinear gaussian impurity may motivate for further study in this direction .",
    "we derived an expression of the effective potential for a soliton in becs which were confined in an ol having spatially localized atomic interactions with a view to study the dynamics of the soliton .",
    "the localized interaction introduces a deep well at a maximum of the periodic potential due to the optical lattice .",
    "this well is separated from the nearest lattice minima by potential wall .",
    "the amplitude of which depends on lattice parameter ( namely , wave number ) as well as width of localized inter - atomic interaction .",
    "therefore , if a soliton initially located at a minimum nearest to the well is at rest , it can be forced to move into the well by varying only the width of localized interaction .",
    "we showed that dynamical behavior of the soliton depends sensitively on its initial location in effective potential as well as its velocity .",
    "this is obtained by solving the appropriate gp equation by a purely numerical routine .",
    "we examined that , depending on the initial conditions , the density profile of the soltion may execute steady and oscillatory motions and can move with a constant speed without any attenuation .",
    "the unattenuated long time evolution of the density profile implied that during evolution the profile remains stable .",
    "in addition , the numerical calculations not only gave validity of the method used but also justified the accuracy of the trial function for the model considered .",
    "we also showed that the effective potential resulting from the localized nonlinearity and ol for a soliton in a single - component bec is almost same as that of the effective potential of two interacting solitons in a two - component bec with optical lattices .",
    "interestingly , we found that the response of the soliton was also similar to that of the solitons in two - component becs .",
    "therefore , the effective potential for two interacting solitons in a bec may be represented by a gaussian space - dependent function .",
    "finally , we noticed that the system can support fundamental gap solitons even in the absence of background scattering length and/or even only in the presence of spatially localized interaction .",
    "these solitons are stable only when they satisfy inverted vakhitov - kolokolov criterion",
