    "it is well known that zeroes of @xmath0-functions contain an important information about the arithmetic properties of the objects to which these @xmath0-functions are associated .",
    "the question about the distribution of these zeroes on the critical line was studied by many authors .",
    "this problem can be looked upon from many angles ( the proportion of zeroes on the critical line , low zeroes , zero spacing , etc . ) .    in this paper",
    "we study the distribution of zeroes of @xmath0-functions on the critical line when we let vary the modular form to which the @xmath0-function is associated . the same question was considered by s. lang in @xcite and m. tsfasman and s. vldu in @xcite for the dedekind zeta function of number fields .",
    "let @xmath4 be a holomorphic cusp of weight @xmath5 for the group @xmath6 such that @xmath7 is its normalized fourier expansion at the cusp @xmath8 we suppose that @xmath4 is a primitive form in the sense of atkin ",
    "lehner @xcite ( it is a new form and a normalized eigen form for all hecke operators ) , so @xmath9 can be defined by the euler product @xmath10 we denote by @xmath11 and @xmath12 the two conjugate roots of the polynomial @xmath13 .",
    "deligne has shown ( see @xcite ) that @xmath14 for @xmath15 ( the ramanujan  peterson conjecture ) .",
    "on the other hand , one knows ( see @xcite ) that for @xmath16 we have @xmath17    if we define the gamma factor by @xmath18 with @xmath19 then the function @xmath20 is entire and satisfies the functional equation @xmath21 with @xmath22 the generalized riemann hypothesis ( grh ) for @xmath0-function of modular forms states that all the non - trivial zeroes of these @xmath0-functions lie on the critical line @xmath23 throughout the paper we assume that grh is true .",
    "the analytic conductor @xmath24 ( see @xcite ) is defined as @xmath25 when @xmath26 we will use the last expression ( or , more precisely , its logarithm minus a constant ) as a weight in all the zero sums in the paper .    to each @xmath4 we can associate the measure @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 runs through all non - trivial zeroes of @xmath9 ; here @xmath30 denotes the atomic ( dirac ) measure at @xmath31 since we suppose that grh is true , @xmath32 is a discrete measure on @xmath33 moreover , it can easily be seen that @xmath32 is a measure of slow growth ( see below ) .",
    "our main result is the following one :    [ zeroesmodular ]    assuming grh , for any family @xmath34 of primitive forms with @xmath35 the limit @xmath36 exists in the space of measures of slow growth on @xmath37 and is equal to the measure with density @xmath38 ( i. e. @xmath39 ) .",
    "our method of the proof will , roughly speaking , follow that of @xcite , where a similar question is treated in the case of dedekind zeta functions",
    ". it will even be simplier in our case due to the fact that the family we consider is `` asymptotically bad '' .",
    "let us recall a few facts and definitions from the theory of distribution .",
    "we will use @xcite as our main reference . recall that the schwartz space @xmath40 is the space of all real valued infinitely differentiable rapidly decreasing functions on @xmath37 ( i.  e. @xmath41 and any its derivative go to 0 when @xmath42 faster then any power of @xmath43 ) .",
    "the space @xmath44 is defined to be the space of all real valued infinitely differentiable functions with compact support on @xmath33 both @xmath45 and @xmath44 are equipped with the structures of topological vector spaces .    the space @xmath46 ( resp .",
    "@xmath47 ) , topologically dual to @xmath48 ( resp .",
    "@xmath49 ) is called the space of distribution ( resp . tempered distributions )",
    "we also define the space of measures @xmath50 as the topological dual of the space of real valued continuous functions with compact support on @xmath33 the space @xmath50 contains a cone of positive measures @xmath51 i.  e. of measures taking positive values on positive functions .",
    "one has the following inclusions : @xmath52 and @xmath53 the intersection @xmath54 is called the space of measures of slow growth .",
    "a measure @xmath55 of slow growth can be characterized by the property that for some positive integer @xmath2 the integral @xmath56 converges ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "vii of ch .",
    "in particular , from this criterion and the fact that the series @xmath57 converges ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 5.5 ) ) , we see that @xmath32 is a measure of slow growth for any @xmath58    finally , we note that the fourier transform @xmath59 is defined on @xmath49 and @xmath47 and is a topological automorphism on these spaces . @xmath48 is known to be dense in @xmath49 and so @xmath60 is also dense in @xmath61 to check that @xmath55 is a measure of slow growth it is enough to check that it is defined on a dense subset and that it is continuous on this dense subset in the topology of @xmath62 in the same way , to check that a sequence of measures of slow growth converges to a measure of slow growth it is enough to check its convergence on a dense subset to a measure continuous on this dense subset .",
    "this follows from the definition of measures as linear functionals .",
    "our main tool will be a version of weil explicit formula for @xmath0-functions of modular forms proven in ( * ? ? ? *",
    "i.2 ) or in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 5.12 ) ( in the last source some extra conditions on test functions are imposed ) .",
    "suppose @xmath63 satisfies for some @xmath64 the following condition @xmath65 where @xmath66 the next proposition gives us the explicit formula that we need to relate the sum over zeroes to the sum of coefficient of modular forms :    [ propexpl ] let @xmath4 be a primitive form of level @xmath1 and weight @xmath67 then the limit @xmath68 exists and we have the following formula : @xmath69 where @xmath70 , @xmath71 if @xmath16 and @xmath72 otherwise .",
    "taking a subsequence of @xmath73 we can assume that the limit @xmath74 exists .",
    "we will check the convergence of measures on @xmath75 from the above discussion this is enough to prove the result .",
    "let us take any @xmath76 @xmath77 @xmath78 we have @xmath79 the function @xmath80 satisfies the condition ( [ cond ] ) , so we can apply the explicit formula to it .",
    "we fix @xmath81 and let vary @xmath82 then , we get the equality when @xmath83 .",
    "@xmath84 since @xmath85 and the integral is uniformly convergent as @xmath86 the limit under the integral sign can be evaluated using the stirling formula @xmath87 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this gives us @xmath88 but @xmath89 and so the right hand side of ( [ eqlim ] ) equals @xmath90 this concludes the proof of the theorem .",
    "one can prove a similar equidistribution statement for @xmath0-functions of bounded degree in the selberg class , assuming suitable conjectures ( like the generalized riemann hypothesis ) .",
    "it is an interesting question how zeroes of @xmath0-functions are distributed if the degree of these @xmath0-functions grows with the analytic conductor .",
    "some examples of non - trivial distributions of zeroes for dedekind zeta functions are considered in @xcite ."
