    "tunnel current transport in superconducting junctions is a classical topic of interest and research.@xcite theoretical description of the superconducting tunneling given by the tunnel model@xcite is based on the assumption about equilibrium in the junction electrodes .",
    "the resulting equations for the tunnel current are expressed through the nonperturbed density of states ( dos ) and equilibrium distribution function .",
    "such an approach includes only single - particle tunnelling processes , and it is sufficient for describing current - voltage characteristics at large applied voltage @xmath2 , and within the subgap voltage region @xmath3 at nonzero temperature . at very small temperature , multiparticle tunneling processes must be taken into account.@xcite however , these processes are exponentially weak at small voltage , and if the temperature is not particularly small , @xmath4 , only tunneling of thermally excited quasiparticles plays significant role .",
    "it is clear , however , that quasiparticle tunnelling generates nonequilibrium distribution in the electrodes , and that the effect is enhanced in diffusive junctions because of the scattering by impurities .",
    "traditionally , this effect is considered to be negligibly small since it is of a higher order in the junction transparency .",
    "how small is the nonequilibrium effect actually ?",
    "in voltage biased superconducting junctions , the phase of the order parameter has different time dependencies in different electrodes , and the interference of the order parameters induced by the tunnelling leads to the time oscillations of the dos .",
    "the character of these oscillations can be qualitatively understood from comparison with the well studied case of ballistic tunnel junctions.@xcite in the latter , the andreev levels are formed in the vicinity of the tunnel barrier ; their energies lie within the energy gap in the bulk electrodes and oscillate in time following evolution of the superconducting phase difference .",
    "similarly , one may expect that in diffusive junctions the time oscillation of the dos will have the form of a `` breathing '' potential well localized in the vicinity of the tunnel barrier ( `` andreev band '' ) , which periodically , with the josephson period , traps and releases quasiparticles .",
    "thus the quasiparticles spend larger time within the junction area compared to the travelling time , which should generate strongly nonequilibrium quasiparticle distribution and , as a result , an appreciable change of the tunnelling current",
    ". the effect should be most pronounced for a planar junction geometry sketched in fig .",
    "[ model](a , b ) , when the tunnel junction is connected to bulk electrodes via diffusive superconducting wires whose length exceeds the size of the andreev band .",
    "otherwise , as in diffusive point contacts , the proximity of large equilibrium reservoirs will suppress the dos oscillations and hence formation of the andreev band because of rapid spreading out of the current .",
    "= 8.0 cm    in this paper we demonstrate that the nonequilibrium quasiparticle distribution generated by nonstationary process of formation of the andreev band during the tunneling considerably modifies the dc tunnel current at small applied voltage .",
    "we show that the nonequilibrium effect results in a time dependent amplitudes of all the three current components given by the tunnel model,@xcite @xmath5 ( josephson current , quasiparticle current , and the interference current , respectively ) .",
    "all the amplitudes have nonharmonic time dependence , and generally all of them contribute to the dc current .",
    "however , at small voltage , the major contribution , nonanalytic in junction transparency and voltage , comes from the sine term ( josephson current ) .",
    "more precisely , this additional dc current results from a non - adiabatic component of the distribution function associated either with inelastic relaxation of quasiparticles , or with the quasiparticle diffusion away from the tunnel barrier .",
    "the additional dc current may considerably exceed the magnitude given by the tunnel model , and moreover , leads to a _ non - monotonous _ net dc current .",
    "such effect has close qualitative similarity to the nonequilibrium effects in transparent weak links [ superconductor - normal metal - superconductor ( sns ) junctions and superconducting bridges ] studied earlier.@xcite there are however the differences : in superconducting bridges , the potential well appears due to suppression of the order parameter by the current concentration ( depairing effect),@xcite while in the tunnel junctions this effect does not play any essential role . in long sns junctions ,",
    "the potential well is pre - prepared by the proximity effect , and it exists in the absence of the transport current ; as a result , the oscillations develop at small energy,@xcite while in the tunnel junctions the oscillations occur at large energies close to the gap edge in the electrodes .",

    "ii we formulate the theoretical model and microscopic equations describing current transport through the tunnel junction with diffusive leads . in sec .",
    "iii we introduce an adiabatic approach for solving the time - dependent problem in the limit of low applied voltage .",

    "these processes are weak at small voltage compared to the continuum - bound level exchange , and they are neglected within the adiabatic approximation adopted in the present paper . for this reason , the spectral flow of the trapped quasiparticles is blocked , which results in a flat ( energy - independent ) distribution of these quasiparticles in the absence of inelastic relaxation .    however , there is considerable quantitative difference between the point contacts and diffusive junctions : in the point contacts , most of the quasiparticles reflected by the tunnel barrier escape to the reservoir , while in the long diffusive lead the quasiparticles multiply collide with the barrier due to the impurity backscattering .",
