    "the current version of the standard model ( sm ) consists of three generations of quarks and leptons .",
    "recently we proposed @xcite a four generation lepton model based on the non - abelian discrete symmetry @xmath0 ( icosahedron ) , in which the best features of the three family @xmath2 ( tetrahedral ) model survive . besides the new heavy degrees of freedom in the @xmath3 model , which satisfy the experimental constraints , we retain tribimaximal neutrino mixings , three light neutrino masses , and three sm charged lepton masses in the three light generation sector .    in this paper",
    ", we will explore a generalization of our @xmath4 model to include four generations of both quarks and leptons .",
    "but before launching into that discussion we must first discuss the viability of models with four generations given recent experimental developments .",
    "a fourth generation is now being constrained @xcite by precision electroweak data @xcite , by flavor symmetries @xcite , and by the higgs - like particle at 125 gev recently reported at the lhc @xcite .",
    "the new data provide an important step forward in distinguishing various four generation models , and in particular eliminating some from consideration .",
    "in particular , four sequential generation models are now highly disfavored @xcite ; however , it would be premature to dismiss all four generation models .",
    "while tension between four generation models and data has developed , a fourth generation is not excluded by the electroweak precision data @xcite , so the existence of a fourth generation is still a viable phenomenological possibility which can provide an explanation of the observed anomaly of cp asymmetries in the b meson system @xcite , and the baryon asymmetry of the universe @xcite , with additional mixings and cp phases . also , there are a number of way to relieve this tension . for example two higgs doublet models ( see e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) can accommodate a fourth generation of fermions and current data . for a comprehensive review",
    "typically these two higgs doublet models are low energy effective field theories that require composite higgses similar to top quark condensate models @xcite .",
    "for some recent examples see ref .",
    "another possibility is to add electroweak doublets that are in color octets @xcite .",
    "further discussion can be found in ref . @xcite .",
    "while the model we will discuss has an extended higgs structure , a full exploration of the possible composite nature of the scalar sector is beyond the scope of our present study .    to generalize our @xmath4 model to include four generations of quarks and leptons",
    ", we first recall the three family scenarios in which the binary tetrahedral group @xmath5 is capable of providing a model of both the quarks and leptons with tribimaximal mixings and a calculable cabibbo angle  @xcite . the @xmath6 group is the double covering group of @xmath7 .",
    "it has four irreducible representations ( irreps ) with identical multiplication rules to those of @xmath7 , one triplet @xmath8 and three singlets @xmath9 , and @xmath10 , plus three additional doublet irreps @xmath11 , and @xmath12 .",
    "the additional doublets allow the implementation of the @xmath13 structure to the quark sector  @xcite , thus the third family of quarks are treated differently and are assigned to a singlet .",
    "hence they can acquire heavy masses  @xcite .",
    "one should note that @xmath7 is not a subgroup of @xmath6 , therefore , the inclusion of quarks into the model is not strictly an extension of @xmath7 , but instead replaces it  @xcite . based on the same philosophy , we study the model of four families of quarks and leptons by using the binary icosahedral group @xmath14 .",
    "the relation between @xmath1 and @xmath3 is similar to that for @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the icosahedral group @xmath15 has double - valued representations that are single - valued representations of the double icosahedral group @xmath16 .",
    "hence , besides the irreps of @xmath1 that are coincident with those of @xmath3 , there are four additional spinor - like irreps @xmath17 , and @xmath18 of @xmath1 . we shall be able to assign quarks to the spinor - like representations , but to discuss model building using @xmath1 , we must first review our lepton model based on @xmath3 , which will remain essentially unchanged when generalized to @xmath1 .",
    "some useful group theory details have been relegated to the appendix .",
    "the irreps of @xmath3 are one singlet @xmath19 , two triplets @xmath8 and @xmath20 , one quartet @xmath21 , and one quintet @xmath22 .",
    "the model is required to be invariant under the flavor symmetry of @xmath23 and the particle content is given by table  [ a5 ] .",
    "the most general form of the higgs potential containing the scalar fields @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , invariant under the discrete @xmath23 symmetries is given by @xmath28 where the individual terms are written as @xmath29 , \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath30 ,   \\\\",

    "the first stage of ssb takes us from the initial @xmath1 discrete symmetry to @xmath6 , and this is accomplished with a vev for @xmath35 .",
    "consider the pure @xmath35 sector of the higgs potential @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are @xmath1 group matrices .",
    "since @xmath39 in @xmath1 contains three terms there are three singlets in @xmath40 ^ 2 $ ] and hence in @xmath41 .",
    "there is also a potential cubic term that can be suppressed , either by imposing an addition @xmath42 symmetry , or by making @xmath35 a complex field . for @xmath43 and @xmath44 sufficiently small and of the proper signs",
    ", the ssb is dominated by the @xmath45 term and we have @xmath46 such that @xmath47 with the sm gauge group unaffected and with the scalars decomposing as in eq . ( 6 ) .",
    "the sector of the higgs potential of the @xmath1 model that depends only on @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 is given in the appendix of @xcite which only involves @xmath6 invariant terms and is identical to our form of the potential up to constraints due to residual @xmath1 relations on the coupling constants .",
    "the work of @xcite demonstrates how @xmath6 is broken completely and how the light quark and lepton masses and mixings arise .",
    "our only other additional scalars are the @xmath1 triplet , sm doublet fields @xmath52 . since @xmath53 under @xmath47 , a @xmath52 breaks @xmath6 .",
    "the pure @xmath52 scalar sector can be rewritten as @xmath54 where we have included the triplet indices @xmath55 and find two quartic terms due to the fact that @xmath56 in @xmath1 contains two terms and hence @xmath57 ^ 2 $ ] contains two singlets .",
    "given the @xmath6 level vevs for @xmath50 , and @xmath51 , there is no @xmath6 symmetry remaining to rotate the @xmath52 vev .",
    "hence the choice @xmath58 is stable for @xmath59 and of the form needed in the model .",
    "a similar analysis can be applied to the investigation of the ssb in our @xmath4 model .",
    "finally we note that typically , only an @xmath60 fine tuning of scalar quartic coupling constants is needed to maintain the stability of such patterns of ssb .",
