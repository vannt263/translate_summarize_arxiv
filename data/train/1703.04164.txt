    "the search for new physics at the lhc has covered enormous ground so far , constraining the parameters of many possible new particles that appear in a variety of extensions of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "there are still exceptions , models that have not been carefully confronted with the lhc data , amongst them an extension of the scalar sector of the sm with a color octet electroweak doublet scalar .",
    "this model was introduced some time ago by manohar and wise ( mw ) @xcite , and it is motivated by minimal flavor violation @xcite .",
    "there are several phenomenological papers concerning lhc studies of the mw model available , but all of them predate the lhc .",
    "the original mw paper already gave analytic expressions for the pair production of the new scalars through the dominant gluon fusion channel , finding production cross - sections that vary many orders of magnitude , between @xmath3  fb and @xmath4  fb for @xmath5 between @xmath6 and @xmath7  tev respectively at lhc14 @xcite .",
    "shortly after , gresham and wise considered the production of a single neutral scalar , a one loop process similar to the production of the higgs boson , which becomes dominant over the two scalar production at around 1  tev @xcite .",
    "et al _ @xcite considered pair production of scalars leading to final states with four heavy quarks ( top or bottom ) at the lhc concluding that discovery would be possible for masses up to about a tev .",
    "finally arnold and fornal considered constraints that can be imposed by studying high @xmath8 four - jet events at lhc @xcite , and concluded that 10  fb@xmath9 would be enough to discover a scalar as heavy as 1.5  tev at lhc14 .    in this paper",
    "we partially address the existing gap in the extraction of lhc constraints for the mw model by comparing the cross section for production of a single neutral scalar and a pair of neutral scalars to limits obtained by atlas and cms in the dijet , top - pair , dijet - pair , @xmath0 and @xmath1 channels .",
    "we defer the study of charged scalar production and their different decay modes to a future publication .",
    "we restrict this paper to a parton - level study because its main weakness , not knowing the relevant acceptance of lhc detectors , can only be addressed by the experimental collaborations .",
    "for this reason , the constraints we obtain will be stronger than is actually possible .",
    "a similar study for pseudo - scalar color octets , common to composite higgs models , exists in the literature @xcite .",
    "the mw model contains many new parameters , several of which have been studied phenomenologically before . in particular the new color octet scalars can have a large effect on loop level higgs production and decay @xcite and this has resulted in multiple studies of one - loop effective higgs couplings @xcite .",
    "they are also constrained by precision electroweak measurements @xcite , flavor physics @xcite , unitarity and vacuum stability @xcite and other lhc processes @xcite .    in the mw model , the new field",
    "@xmath10 transforms as @xmath11 under the sm gauge group @xmath12 and this gives rise to the gauge interactions responsible for its pair production at the lhc .",
    "numerous new couplings appear in the self - interactions of the scalars as well as in the yukawa couplings to fermions .",
    "the latter are restricted by minimal flavor violation to two complex numbers @xcite , @xmath13 where @xmath14 are left - handed quark doublets , @xmath15 and the @xmath16 generators are normalized as @xmath17 .",
    "the matrices @xmath18 are the same as the higgs couplings to quarks , and @xmath19 along with their phases @xmath20 , are new overall factors .",
    "non - zero phases signal @xmath21 violation beyond the sm and contribute for example to the edm and cedm of quarks @xcite .",
    "the most general renormalizable scalar potential is given in ref .",
    "@xcite and contains several terms . of these",
    ", our study will only depend on the following ( with @xmath22  gev the usual higgs vacuum expectation value ) @xmath23 the number of parameters in eq.([potential ] ) can be reduced for our study as follows : first @xmath24 can be chosen to be real by a suitable definition of @xmath10 ; then custodial @xmath25 symmetry can be invoked to introduce the relations @xmath26 ( and hence @xmath27 ) @xcite and @xmath28 @xcite ; and finally , requiring cp conservation removes all the phases , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 .",
    "after symmetry breaking , the non - zero vev of the higgs field in eq.([potential ] ) gives the physical @xmath32 its usual mass @xmath33 , and in addition it splits the octet scalar masses as , @xmath34 these relations , combined with the use of custodial and cp symmetries result in the following independent input parameters : @xmath35 the parameter @xmath36 controls the split between the two neutral resonances @xmath37 and the parameter @xmath38 controls the strength of scalar loop contributions to single neutral scalar production through gluon fusion .",
    "the parameters @xmath19 control respectively the strength of the @xmath39 and @xmath40 interactions .    under the above assumptions",
    ", the effective one - loop coupling @xmath41 can be written in terms of two factors @xmath42 as , @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the gluon field strength tensor and @xmath45 .",

    "the loop functions @xmath53 and @xmath54 are well known and given by : @xmath55 from this it follows that the top - quark contribution starts as large as @xmath56 for a resonance with twice the top - quark mass , and goes to zero as @xmath57 . additionally , the factor @xmath58 , generates some suppression in contributions from scalar loops relative to top - quark loops . for this reason",
    "only relatively large values of @xmath38 make a significant contribution to single scalar production .",
    "we have also included the bottom - quark loop , which is important only for regions of parameter space where @xmath59 .",
    "this situation is completely analogous to higgs production in type ii two higgs doublet models where the @xmath60 quark contribution is important for @xmath61 .",
    "we will consider this case for the dijet final state study .",
    "an early paper constraining new particles at the lhc introduced several benchmarks @xcite , including a color octet scalar @xmath10 , that have since been pursued by both atlas @xcite and cms @xcite .",
    "both these studies appear to rule out the new color octet scalars with masses up to 3  tev .",
    "unfortunately , the original benchmark does not cover interesting possibilities for additional color octet scalars like the mw model .",
    "this can be easily seen from their coupling to two gluons , @xmath62 , which has been used with @xmath63 in the cms study . comparing this to @xmath64 in eq.([loopc ] ) , one sees that realistic couplings in the mw model result in cross - sections that are three orders of magnitude below the benchmark .    to proceed with our numerical study",
    "we implement the lagrangian of eq.([yukc ] )  and  eq.([loopc ] ) in feynrules @xcite to generate a universal feynrules output ( ufo ) file , and then feed this ufo file into mg5_amc@nlo @xcite . to extract constraints on the parameters of the new resonances we will compare our predicted cross - sections times branching ratios with existing lhc studies .",
    "we divide our study according to the different channels that dominate different regions of parameter space .",
    "we will use in particular the following channels : two jets ; top pairs ; four jets ; four top - quarks ; and four bottom quarks .",
    "we illustrate all cases with production and decay of @xmath51 or @xmath65 but the limits are identical for @xmath66 and similar for @xmath52 provided we prevent the decays @xmath67 ( which is done by a choice of @xmath36 ) .",
    "if those decays are allowed , different limits apply from channels involving final state leptons which we do not consider in this paper . in the limit of @xmath21 conservation that we consider here",
    ", the @xmath52 is a pseudo - scalar and therefore its gluon fusion production mechanism is a bit different from @xmath51 , being independent of @xmath38 .",
    "this channel has been studied before in the context of the mw model for the tevatron . a comparison with the dijet cross - section at the tevatron revealed that signatures from the mw model are orders of magnitude below the qcd background and no constraint emerged for masses below 350  gev with @xmath68 as large as 10 @xcite .",
    "existing lhc searches that can be used to compare the mw model with the two jets channel are : atlas-8 tev @xcite , atlas-13 tev @xcite , cms-8 tev @xcite , cms-13 tev @xcite . for example , atlas used its 8 tev data to conclude that color octet scalars are ruled out below 2.8  tev @xcite , but as explained above , their benchmark color octet model , that of ref .",
    "@xcite , results in cross - sections many orders of magnitude larger than the mw model .",
    "the dijet decay mode is dominant when one of the two neutral color octet resonances @xmath51 or @xmath52 is kinematically suppressed from decaying to the charged one through processes of the form @xmath67 , and its decay into top quark pairs is suppressed due to a small parameter @xmath69 ( we will assume the mass is above threshold for top - pair production ) . under these conditions the dominant decay rate is into two jets .",
    "we illustrate this scenario with the choices : @xmath70 , which makes @xmath71 ; and @xmath72 , which places the mass , @xmath73 above @xmath74 .",
    "the decay of @xmath51 in this case is almost 100% into two jets , with the dominant channels being @xmath75 and @xmath76 as illustrated in figure  [ br - case1 ] .     with the parameters @xmath70 , @xmath72 .",

    "this coupling is weak enough that the resonance width does not exceed @xmath83 , a very narrow resonance which we compare to the experimental curve that assumes a width set at the detector resolution .",
    "this figure illustrates the dependence on @xmath38 , showing it is almost symmetric but with a slight enhancement ( from constructive interference between quark and scalar loops ) for negative values of @xmath38 .",
    "for this reason we will show negative values of @xmath38 in what follows , but remind the reader that results are almost identical for the corresponding positive values of @xmath38 .",

    "@xmath85 can reach the percent level for @xmath86 .    the most restrictive data available for this channel comes from 13 tev and we use it to extract bounds in figure  [ fig:2jets ] .",

    "figure  [ br - case1 ] suggests that this type of resonance would be dominantly produced by a @xmath75 initial state so that it does nt match either of the two cases explicitly considered by cms .",
    "for example , with @xmath88 and @xmath89gev , production from @xmath90 accounts for 98.7% of the cross - section , with only about 1.1% originating in gluon fusion . for @xmath91 ,",
    "the contribution from gluon fusion has increased to about 10% .    from this comparison",
    "we conclude that for values of @xmath92 , its perturbative unitarity bound @xcite , the cross - sections are too small for the lhc to place any meaningful limit .",
