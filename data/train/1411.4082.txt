    "<S> following banks , levi and sepanski @xcite we define a section @xmath13 and a @xmath14-cocycle @xmath15 of @xmath10 , representing the cohomology class in @xmath16 of @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the restriction of @xmath15 to @xmath17 satisfies a block - compatibility relation , with respect to standard levi subgroups . </S>",
    "<S> this is a useful condition for studying parabolically induced representations .    </S>",
    "<S> fix a borel subgroup in @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> the preimage @xmath18 of the maximal torus @xmath19 in the cover is a two step nilpotent subgroup , its irreducible genuine representations are parameterized by genuine characters of its center @xmath20 . the analogous theory for covers of @xmath21 was developed by kazhdan and patterson @xcite , who studied a special class of genuine characters which they called  exceptional \" . in our setting </S>",
    "<S> these are characters @xmath22 of @xmath20 satisfying @xmath23 for all simple roots @xmath24 of @xmath5 and @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is a certain lift of the coroot @xmath27 to the cover and @xmath28 is the length of @xmath24 .    </S>",
    "<S> we use an exceptional character @xmath22 to construct a genuine principal series representation of @xmath11 , which has a unique irreducible quotient denoted @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> the quotient @xmath30 is an exceptional representation , or a small representation in the terminology of bump , friedberg and ginzburg @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our purpose is to develop a theory of these representations .    </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath31 be a unipotent class of @xmath5 , it corresponds to a partition of @xmath32 for which an even number appears with an even multiplicity . </S>",

    "<S> we consider certain characters of @xmath34 , called  generic \" . </S>",
    "<S> roughly , a character @xmath35 of @xmath34 is generic if it is in general position . </S>",
    "<S> the definitions are similar to those of bump , friedberg and ginzburg @xcite ( see also @xcite ) for @xmath0 and are given in section  [ subsubsection : vanishing and results ] . </S>",
    "<S> the following result characterizes the sense of  smallness \" of @xmath30 .    </S>",

    "<S> the twisted jacquet module of @xmath30 with respect to @xmath34 and @xmath35 is zero .    </S>",
    "<S> theorem  [ theorem : local vanishing result ] is proved in section  [ subsubsection : vanishing and results ] . to remove the restriction on the residual characteristic </S>",
    "<S> , we only need to know that exceptional representations of the double cover of @xmath42 ( with the @xcite parameter @xmath43 ) do not have whittaker models , for @xmath44 and even residual characteristic , this is an expected result ( @xcite p.  145 </S>",
    "<S> , see @xcite lemma  6 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the local theory has a global counterpart . </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath7 be a number field with an adles ring @xmath45 . </S>",

    "<S> see section  [ subsubsection : global vanishing results ] for the definitions . </S>",
    "<S> the local - global principle ( see e.g. @xcite proposition  1 ) immediately implies the following global corollary of theorem  [ theorem : local vanishing result ] .    </S>",
    "<S> [ theorem : global vanishing result ] let @xmath40 be any orbit greater than or non comparable with @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> any fourier coefficient with respect to @xmath40 and a generic character vanishes identically on the space of @xmath30 .    a minimal representation is a representation supported on the minimal coadjoint orbit . if @xmath50 , vogan @xcite ( theorem  2.13 ) proved that @xmath0 ( or its cover groups ) do not afford such representations . </S>",
    "<S> bump , friedberg and ginzburg @xcite constructed a local and global  small \" representation @xmath51 of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> it is a representation of a cover @xmath52 , this cover was obtained by restriction of the @xmath53-fold cover of @xmath54 of matsumoto @xcite . in the cases </S>",
    "<S> @xmath55 it is in fact the minimal representation . </S>",
    "<S> it is small in the sense that it is supported on the orbit @xmath41 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the use of the @xmath53-fold cover implies a minor technical restriction on the field , namely that @xmath56 is a square .    </S>",
    "<S> the arguments of vogan @xcite apply also to @xmath5 , that is , for @xmath50 there is no minimal representation . </S>",

    "<S> our local and global results are parallel to those of @xcite and are obtained using similar methods . </S>",
    "<S> for example , because the unipotent subgroups of @xmath5 are in bijection with those of @xmath0 , manipulations on jacquet modules are similar . one notable difference , is in the restriction of the cover to levi subgroups . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast with the cover of @xmath0 , here direct factors of levi subgroups do not commute in the cover . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that representations of levi subgroups can not be studied using the usual tensor product . in this property , as well as in other details , the cover of @xmath5 is more related to the cover of @xmath21 , than to that of @xmath0 .    </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath57 be a maximal parabolic subgroup with a levi part @xmath58 isomorphic to @xmath59 . in the particular case of @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 </S>",
    "<S> do commute and we can define a tensor product . </S>",

    "<S> assume @xmath68 , for the precise meaning of this equality see section  [ subsubsection : global induction transitivity ] . </S>",
    "<S> we compute the constant term of an automorphic form @xmath69 in the space of @xmath30 along the unipotent radical @xmath70 and prove the following result .    </S>",
    "<S> [ theorem : the constant term ] the function @xmath71 on @xmath72 belongs to the space of @xmath73    the definition of the constant term @xmath74 and the proof of the theorem occupy section  [ subsubsection : the constant term ] . </S>",
    "<S> note that @xmath75 is also an exceptional character .    for @xmath0 and any @xmath76 </S>",
    "<S> , the mapping @xmath77 belongs to the space of the tensor product @xmath78 , for a uniquely determined exceptional representation @xmath79 ( @xmath80 is unique ) . </S>",
    "<S> this was conjectured in @xcite and proved for @xmath81 , and in general proved in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we mention that for the current applications the case of @xmath60 is sufficient . for the lifting results of @xcite ( see below ) the constant term was not used .    </S>",
    "<S> we will study representations of @xmath58 using a  larger \" induced representation , similar to the construction of kable @xcite , see section  [ subsubsection : tensor product ] . </S>",
    "<S> a metaplectic tensor product for cover groups of @xmath21 has been studied in @xcite , but will not be used here . </S>",
    "<S> refer to the discussion in section  [ subsubsection : tensor discussion ] .    </S>",
    "<S> there are several applications to our work . </S>",
    "<S> essentially , one can simply replace @xmath51 with @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> this has the benefit of removing the restriction on the field with respect to the @xmath53-th roots of unity . </S>",
    "<S> we describe one application , whose details are given in section  [ section : application 1 coperiod ] . in general , let @xmath82 be a split reductive algebraic @xmath7-group , where @xmath7 is a number field . </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath83 be a maximal parabolic subgroup of @xmath82 with a levi part @xmath84 and let @xmath85 be an irreducible unitary cuspidal globally generic automorphic representation of @xmath86 . denote the central character of @xmath85 by @xmath87 . </S>",
    "<S> denote by @xmath88 the eisenstein series corresponding to an element @xmath89 in the space of the representation of @xmath90 induced from @xmath85 ; @xmath91 and @xmath92 . for @xmath93 , </S>",

    "<S> .    periods of automorphic forms are often related to poles of @xmath98-functions and to questions of functoriality . </S>",
    "<S> ginzburg , jiang and soudry @xcite described such relations in a general setup and considered several examples . </S>",
    "<S> they conjectured ( @xcite conjecture  1.4 ) that the pole at @xmath99 of a partial @xmath98-function corresponding to @xmath85 is related to the non - triviality of certain period integrals , the existence of a residual representation and the existence of a representation @xmath100 such that @xmath85 is the langlands functorial transfer of @xmath100 .    among the examples given in @xcite </S>",
