    "in recent years , great efforts have been devoted to the design / realization of spintronic devices , which employ the spin degree of freedom in traditional electronics for the sake of higher power efficiency , higher speed , and also greater functionality.@xcite among different kinds of hosts for such devices , si appears to be a particularly promising one and attracts much attention , partly due to the high possibility of eliminating hyperfine couplings by isotopic purification and the well developed microfabrication technology.@xcite in fact , the electron spin relaxation , which is necessary to be understood for the device design , has been widely investigated in si materials during the last decade .",
    "the study on relaxation of electron spin qubit in si quantum dot suggests that the relaxation rate can be strongly decreased by adding strain.@xcite the electron spin relaxation in asymmetric @xmath4-type si / sige quantum wells ( qws ) has been investigated both theoretically@xcite and experimentally.@xcite it is shown that the electron spin relaxation time can be quite long ( on the order of @xmath5  s)@xcite due to the weak rashba spin - orbit coupling@xcite ( typically about three orders of magnitude smaller than that in qw structures based on iii - v semiconductors@xcite ) .",
    "the electron spin transport / diffusion in bulk si with a magnetic field perpendicular to both the directions of spin polarization and spin transport / diffusion has also been studied recently.@xcite it is revealed that even in the absence of the traditional dyakonov - perel ( dp ) relaxation mechanism,@xcite there is an obvious spin relaxation along spin transport / diffusion , as predicted several years ago from a general qw model without any dp relaxation mechanism but with a magnetic field in the voigt configuration.@xcite that is also the case in the symmetric si / sige qws.@xcite    although a broad interest has been taken in the electron spin relaxation in si , to our knowledge , the hole spin relaxation has been rarely investigated so far .",
    "glavin and kim have calculated the spin relaxation of two - dimensional holes in strained asymmetric si / sige ( ge / sige ) qws four years ago,@xcite and obtained a spin relaxation time of several tens of picoseconds ( several sub - picoseconds ) in si / sige ( ge / sige ) qws with large gate voltage ( which induces an electric field at @xmath6  kv / cm ) at room temperature .",
    "however , the results were obtained by means of the single - particle approximation,@xcite therefore the effect of the carrier - carrier coulomb scattering on spin relaxation , which has been revealed to be important in spin relaxation,@xcite was not included . besides , the nondegenerate perturbation method with only the lowest unperturbed subband of each hole state considered as basis function is utilized to calculate the subband energy spectrum and envelope functions in ref .  . however , as shown later in this paper , only considering the lowest unperturbed subband is inadequate in converging the calculation , but when more unperturbed subbands are included as basis functions , the nondegenerate perturbation method fails .",
    "this work is to perform a detailed investigation on hole spin relaxation in asymmetric si / sige and ge / sige qws by means of the fully microscopic kinetic spin bloch equation ( ksbe ) approach,@xcite with all the relevant scatterings included .",
    "meanwhile , we apply the exact diagonalization method to obtain the energy spectrum and envelope functions , with sufficient unperturbed subbands included . in the ksbe approach ,",
    "the momentum - dependent spin precessions give rise to the inhomogeneous broadening , with which any scattering ( including the coulomb scattering ) leads to an irreversible spin relaxation.@xcite this approach has been successfully applied to study spin dynamics in quantum wire,@xcite qw@xcite and bulk@xcite semiconductor structures .",
    "the current work reveals that the coulomb scattering plays a much more important role in hole spin relaxation in si / sige ( ge / sige ) qws .",
    "it leads to a peak in both the temperature and density dependences of spin relaxation time in si / sige qws , where holes are generally in the strong scattering limit .",
    "nonetheless , it leads to not only a peak but also a valley in the temperature dependence of spin relaxation time in ge / sige qws , where with the change of temperature the holes in ge / sige qws can be in the either strong or weak scattering limit . besides , the spin relaxation time can be effectively influenced by the hole - impurity scattering , which tends to weaken the effect of the coulomb scattering mentioned above with the increase of impurity density .",

    "[ figzw10 ] , one finds that the spin relaxation time @xmath121 decreases with hole density @xmath122 monotonically , which is different from the case in si / sige qws ( indicated by the dotted curve in fig  [ figzw5 ] ) .",
    "that is because the rashba term here depends on the momentum cubically and the inhomogeneous broadening increases with density strongly with an @xmath143 dependence .    while the peak is associated with the crossover from the degenerate to nondegenerate regime , the valley in fig .",
    "[ figzw10 ] is actually related to the crossover from the weak to strong scattering limit .",

    "it is discovered that the hole - phonon scattering is very weak compared to the hole - hole coulomb scattering , even at high temperatures .",
    "this makes the hole - hole coulomb scattering to play a very important role in spin relaxation .",
    "it leads to a peak of spin relaxation time in both the temperature and carrier density dependences in si / sige qws .",
    "the peak is associated with the crossover from the degenerate to nondegenerate regime of hole system , and thus locates around the crossover point .",
    "however , the increase of inhomogeneous broadening with temperature / hole density tends to lead to a shift of the peak towards a lower temperature / hole density .",
    "the magnitude of the shift depends on the form of the momentum dependence of the rashba term . for si / sige ( ge / sige ) qws , the rashba term mainly ( only ) depends on momentum linearly ( cubically ) , and",
    "thus the shift of the peak is marginal ( obvious ) .",
    "in addition , in contrast to the gaas qws where the peak in the temperature dependence of the electron spin relaxation can only be observed for high mobility samples with low carrier density,@xcite the peak predicted in si / sige ( ge / sige ) qws can be observed even at high carrier density , thanks to the weak hole - phonon scattering .",
    "the coulomb scattering also leads to a valley at low temperature in the temperature dependence of hole spin relaxation time in ge / sige qws with high hole density , which is related to the crossover from the weak to strong scattering limit .",
    "the hole spin relaxation time can be effectively influenced by the hole - impurity scattering , tending to weaken the effect of coulomb scattering mentioned above with the increase of impurity density .",
    "apart from the abundant temperature and hole / impurity density dependences , the spin relaxation time decreases with the gate voltage , accompanying the increase of spin - orbit coupling strength .",
    "the hole spin relaxation time , depending on the temperature , carrier / impurity density and gate voltage , is found to be on the order of 1@xmath3100  ps ( 0.1@xmath310  ps ) in si / sige ( ge / sige ) qws within the scope of our investigation .",
    "these time scales are much shorter than the electron spin relaxation time in si / sige qws ( on the order of @xmath5  s).@xcite a hole spin relaxation time on the order of 0.1@xmath31  ps was theoretically reported in @xmath7-doped gaas qws ( with temperature being 100@xmath3300  k , hole density being @xmath144  @xmath114 , impurity density being 0@xmath31 times hole density and gate voltage induced electric field being about 100 kv / cm)@xcite and a hole spin relaxation time of 4  ps was experimentally observed in @xmath4-doped gaas qws ( at 10  k).@xcite thus , generally , the hole spin relaxation time in si / sige ( ge / sige ) qws is longer than ( comparable with ) the hole spin relaxation time in gaas qws .",
    "it should be pointed out at last that the strain in si / sige ( ge / sige ) qws plays an important role in spin relaxation , as it shifts the energy levels of the light hole states away from the heavy hole ones . if the strain is removed ( e.g. , in sio@xmath8/si or sio@xmath8/ge inversion layer ) , the coupling between the light hole and heavy holea states are strengthened and the hole spin relaxation should be enhanced .",
