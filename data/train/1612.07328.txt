    "ultrahigh - energy ( @xmath9 ) cosmic rays provide a formidable beam to study particle collisions at center - of - mass energies and kinematic regimes not accessible at terrestrial accelerators .",
    "the incident cosmic radiation interacts with the atomic nuclei of air molecules and produces air showers which spread out over large areas .",
    "if the primary cosmic ray is a baryon , hundreds to thousands of secondary particles are usually produced at the interaction vertex , many of which also have energies above the highest accelerator energies  @xcite .",
    "these secondary products are of course intrinsically hadrons . generally speaking , by extrapolating final states observed at collider experiments",
    ", we can infer that , for @xmath10 collisions at center - of - mass energy @xmath11 , the jet of hadrons contains about 75% pions ( including 25% @xmath7 s , in accord with isospin invariance ) , 15% kaons , and 10% nucleons  @xcite .    during the shower evolution ,",
    "the hadrons propagate through a medium with an increasing density as the altitude decreases and the hadron - air cross section rises slowly with energy .",
    "therefore , the probability for interacting with air before decay increases with rising energy . moreover , the relativistic time dilation increases the decay length by a factor @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the energy and mass of the produced hadron .",
    "when the @xmath7 s ( with a lifetime of @xmath15 ) do decay promptly to two photons , they feed the electromagnetic component of the shower . for other longer - lived mesons ,",
    "it is instructive to estimate the critical energy at which the chances for interaction and decay are equal . for a vertical transversal of the atmosphere",
    ", such a critical energy is found to be : @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19  @xcite .",
    "the dominant @xmath20 branching ratios are to @xmath21 , to @xmath22 , to @xmath23 , and to @xmath24 , whereas those of the @xmath25 are to @xmath26 , to @xmath27 , and for @xmath28 we have @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32  @xcite . with these figures in mind , to a first approximation it seems reasonable to assume that in each generation of particles about 25% of the energy is transferred to the electromagnetic shower , and all hadrons with energy  @xmath33 interact rather than decay , continuing to produce the hadronic shower .",
    "eventually , the electromagnetic cascade dissipates around 90% of the primary particle s energy and the remaining 10% is carried by muons and neutrinos .",
    "as the cascade process develops in the atmosphere , the number of particles in the shower increases until the energy of the secondary particles is degraded to the level where ionization losses dominate . at this point",
    "the density of particles starts to decline .",
    "the number of particles as a function of the amount of atmosphere penetrated by the cascade ( @xmath34 in @xmath35 ) is known as the longitudinal profile .",
    "a well - defined peak in the longitudinal development , @xmath36 , occurs where the number of @xmath37 in the electromagnetic shower is at its maximum .",
    "@xmath36 increases with primary energy , as more cascade generations are required to degrade the secondary particle energies",
    ". evaluating @xmath36 is a fundamental part of many of the composition analyses done when studying air showers .",
    "the generic shower properties can be qualitatively well understood using the superposition principle , which states that a shower initiated by a nucleus with @xmath38 nucleons and energy @xmath39 behaves to a good approximation as the superposition of @xmath38 proton showers with initial energy @xmath40",
    "this phenomenological assumption relies on the fact that the effect of nuclear binding must be negligible at extremely high energies .",
    "thus , for a given total energy @xmath39 , showers initiated by a heavy nucleus have smaller @xmath36 than proton induced showers .",
    "the integrated longitudinal profile provides a calorimetric measurement of the energy of the primary cosmic ray , with a relatively small uncertainty due to the correction for energy lost to neutrinos and particles hitting the ground .",
    "the characteristics of the cascade depend dominantly on the elasticity ( fraction of incoming energy carried by the leading secondary particle ) and the multiplicity of secondary particles in the early , high - energy interactions .",
    "modeling the development of a cosmic - ray air shower requires extrapolation of hadronic interaction models tuned to accommodate lhc data  @xcite .",
    "not surprisingly , such extrapolation usually leads to discrepancies between measured and simulated shower properties .",
    "the hadronic interaction models are further constrained by independent measurements of @xmath36 and the density of muons at @xmath41 from the shower core @xmath42  @xcite .",
    "the mean @xmath36 is primarily sensitive to the cross - section , elasticity , multiplicity , and primary mass .",
    "the mean @xmath42 is primarily sensitive to the multiplicity , the @xmath7 energy fraction ( the fraction of incident energy carried by @xmath7 s in hadronic interactions ) , and the primary mass .    over the past few decades , it has been suspected that the number of registered muons at the surface of the earth is by some tens of percentage points higher than expected with extrapolations of existing hadronic interaction models  @xcite .",
    "very recently , a study from the pierre auger collaboration  @xcite has strengthened this suspicion , using a novel technique to mitigate some of the measurement uncertainties of earlier methods  @xcite .",
    "the new analysis of auger data suggests that the hadronic component of showers ( with primary energy @xmath43 ) contains about @xmath44 to @xmath45 more muons than expected .",
    "the significance of the discrepancy between data and model prediction is somewhat above @xmath46 .    changing the @xmath7 energy fraction or suppressing @xmath7 decay are the only modifications which can be used to increase @xmath42 without coming into conflict with the @xmath36 observations  @xcite . distribution .",
    "since the muon lateral distribution function is a steeply falling function of the radius , a larger production angle would increase @xmath42 .",
    "however , as shown in  @xcite , the measured zenith angle dependence of the ground signal vetoes the correlated flattening of the muon lateral distribution function necessary to accommodate auger data . ]",
    "several new physics models have been proposed exploring these two possibilities  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we adopt a purely phenomenological approach to develop an alternative scheme .",
    "in sharp contrast to previous models , our proposal is based on the assumption that ultrahigh energy cosmic rays are heavy ( or medium mass ) nuclei .",
    "our work builds upon some established concepts , yet contravenes others .",
    "we conceive the production and separation of strangeness in a baryon - rich _ centauro - like _ fireball before its spontaneous _ explosive _ decay  @xcite . at production",
    "the fireball has a very high matter density and consists of gluons and two flavors of light quarks ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "because the fireball is formed in the baryon - rich projectile fragmentation region , the high baryochemical potential slows down the creation of @xmath47 and @xmath48 pairs , resulting in gluon fragmentation dominated by @xmath49 .",
    "the larger amount of @xmath50 and @xmath51 with respect to @xmath52 and @xmath53 gives a higher probability for @xmath54 to find @xmath50 or @xmath51 and form @xmath20 or @xmath55 than for @xmath56 to form the antiparticle counterparts .",
    "prompt _ hard _",
    "kaon emission then carries away all strange antiquarks and positive charge , lowering somewhat the initial temperature and entropy .",
    "the late - stage hadronization is characterized by production of @xmath57 , @xmath58 , nucleons , pions , and strange baryons .",
    "overall , after hadronization is complete , the relative density of strange hadrons is significantly enhanced over that resulting from a hadron gas alone , damping the @xmath7 energy fraction .",

    "[ s3 ] we discuss the particulars of air shower evolution and present our results from monte carlo simulations .",
    "we show that the formation of a plasma , with gluons and massive quarks , could play a key role in the hadronization process , modifying shower observables .",
    "in particular , we demonstrate that air showers triggered by a fireball explosion tend to increase @xmath42 , and under some reasonable assumptions can accommodate auger data .",
    "finally , we summarize our results and draw our conclusions in sec .",
    "it has long been suspected that , for systems of high energy density , the elementary excitations can be safely approximated by an ensemble of free quarks and gluons at finite temperature and baryon number density  @xcite .",
    "this is because when the energy density is extremely high , the expected average particle separation is so small that the effective strength of interactions is weak ( asymptotic freedom )  @xcite . for many purposes ,",
    "the order of the energy density of matter inside a heavy nucleus is immense , @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the proton mass , @xmath38 is the nuclear baryon number , and @xmath61 is the nuclear radius .",
    "however , at typical energy densities inside of nuclei , quarks and gluons are very probably confined , on the average , inside of hadrons such as protons , neutrons , or pions . for @xmath62",
    "all of these hadrons could be squeezed so tightly together that on the average they will all overlap and the system would become an unconfined plasma of quarks and gluons , which are free to roam the system .",
    "the energy scale at which hadrons begin to overlap is above the energy density of matter inside the proton , @xmath63 , where we have taken the radius of the proton as measured in electron scattering @xmath64 . indeed , using phenomenological considerations",
    "it is straightforward to estimate that the critical energy density to form a non - hadronic medium is around @xmath65  @xcite .",

    "this will provide additional information to reduce systematic uncertainties and perhaps increase the significance of the muon excess .    even though the excess is not statistically significant yet , it is interesting to entertain the possibility that it corresponds to a real signal of qcd dynamics flagging the onset of deconfinement . in this paper",
    ", we have proposed a model that can explain the observed excess in the muon signal .",
    "we have assumed that ultrarelativistic nuclei ( @xmath197 ) that collide in the upper atmosphere could create a deconfined thermal fireball which undergoes a sudden hadronization . at production ,",
    "the fireball has a very high matter density and consists of gluons and two flavors of light quarks ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "because the fireball is formed in the baryon - rich projectile fragmentation region , the high baryochemical potential damps the production of @xmath47 and @xmath4 pairs , resulting in gluon fragmentation mainly into @xmath5 .",
    "the strange quarks then become much more abundant and upon hadronization the relative density of strange hadrons is significantly enhanced over that resulting from a hadron gas .",
    "we have shown that the augmented production of strange hadrons by the fireball , over that resulting from a hadron gas alone , provides a mechanism to increase the muon content in atmospheric cascades by about 40% , in agreement with the data of the auger facility .",
    "contrary to previous proposals  @xcite to explain the muon excess in auger data our model relies on the assumption that ultrahigh - energy cosmic rays are heavy ( or medium mass ) nuclei . as noted elsewhere  @xcite , upper limits on the cosmic diffuse neutrino flux provide a constraint on the proton fraction in ultrahigh - energy cosmic rays , and therefore can be used to set indirect constraints on the model proposed herein . in particular ,",
    "the nearly guaranteed flux of cosmogenic neutrinos is a decay product from the generated pions in interactions of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays with the cosmic microwave background and related radiation  @xcite .",
    "the spectral shape and intensity of this flux depend on whether the cosmic - ray particles are protons or heavy nuclei . for proton primaries , the energy - squared - weighted flux peaks between @xmath198 and @xmath199 , and the intensity is around 1 in waxman - bahcall ( wb ) units  @xcite .",
    "@xcite . ] for heavy nuclei , the peak is at much lower energy ( around @xmath200  @xcite ) and the intensity is about 0.1 to 0.01  wb , depending on source evolution  @xcite . the sensitivity of existing neutrino - detection facilities has a reach to 1  wb , challenging cosmic - ray models for which the highest energies are proton - dominated  @xcite .",
    "next - generation neutrino detectors will systematically probe the entire range of the parameter space of cosmogenic neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "observation of the cosmogenic neutrino flux with intensity of 0.1 to 0.01  wb could become the smoking gun for the ideas discussed in this paper .",
    "complementary information can be obtained with accompanying cosmogenic photons  @xcite . as a matter of fact",
    ", the pierre auger observatory has begun to probe the region of the parameter space relevant for proton primaries  @xcite .",
    "a third probe of proton - dominated uhecr models is the extragalactic gamma - ray background seen by fermi - lat ( and , in the future , cta )  @xcite . for heavy nuclei",
    ", however , the cosmogenic photon intensity is almost negligible and therefore can not be used ( for the time being ) as a harbinger signal  @xcite .    for @xmath201 , the mean and dispersion of @xmath36 inferred from fluorescence auger data point to a light composition ( protons and helium ) towards the low end of this energy bin and to a large light - nuclei content ( around helium ) towards the high end ( see fig .  3 in  @xcite ) .",
    "however , when the signal in the water cherenkov stations ( with sensitivity to both the electromagnetic and muonic components ) is correlated with the fluorescence data , a light composition made up of only proton and helium becomes inconsistent with observations  @xcite .",
    "the hybrid data indicate that intermediate nuclei , with @xmath202 , must contribute to the energy spectrum in this energy bin .",
    "moreover , a potential iron contribution can not be discarded .    at this stage , it is worthwhile to point out that the production of a fireball may modify the shower evolution .",
    "for example , after emitting @xmath20 and @xmath55 , the fireball has a finite excess of @xmath56 quarks , and because of the @xmath56 quarks stabilizing effects , the fireball could form heavy multiquark droplets @xmath203 , with large strangeness  @xcite .",
    "the energy lost by the @xmath203 particles during collision with nucleons is primarily through hard scattering , and so the fractional energy loss per collision is @xmath204  @xcite .",
    "@xmath203 production may thus slow down the shower evolution . although this effect has not been included in our simulations",
    ", one may wonder whether the structure observed in the elongation rate above about @xmath205  @xcite could be ascribed to the onset of @xmath203 production . of course one would not expect a fireball to be created when nuclei just slide along each other .",
    "the admixture of peripheral and fireball collisions would then produce large fluctuations in the number of muons at ground level .",
    "however , since the critical energy for charged pions @xmath149 and kaons @xmath206 is roughly the same , the elongation rate of the muon channel would be almost unaltered and so the muon shower maximum @xmath207 would have small fluctuations .",
    "moreover , if the fireball indeed modifies the elongation rate of the electromagnetic shower , the peripheral collisions would also tend to increase the dispersion of @xmath36 , mimicking what is expected for a light composition in the canonical framework where no fireballs are being produced in this energy range .    in closing ,",
    "we comment on the differences between our model and the proposal by farrar and allen ( fa )  @xcite , which also relies on qcd dynamics at high temperature . to better understand the differences between these models",
    "we first note that at low energies , qcd exhibits two interesting phenomena : confinement and ( approximate ) spontaneous chiral - symmetry breaking .",
    "these two phenomena are strong - coupling effects , invisible to perturbation theory .",
    "the confinement force couples quarks to form hadrons and the chiral force binds the collective excitations to goldstone bosons .    as a matter of course",
    ", there is no relation _ a priori _ between these two phenomena ; in thermodynamics , the associated scales are characterized by two distinct temperatures , @xmath208 and @xmath209 . for @xmath210 , hadrons dissolve into quarks and gluons , whereas for @xmath211 , the chiral symmetry is fully restored and quarks become massless , forming an ideal quark - gluon plasma .",
    "the @xmath212 phase diagram of hadronic matter thus contains a _ confined phase _ consisting of an interacting gas of hadrons ( a _ resonance gas _ ) and a _ deconfined phase _ comprising a ( non - ideal ) gas of quarks and gluons  @xcite .",
    "the _ phase boundary _ reflects the present uncertainties from lattice qcd extrapolated to finite baryochemical potential .",
    "the intermediate region in - between the hadron gas and the ideal quark - gluon plasma is the domain of the thermal fireball .",
    "the existence of this intermediate region with deconfined massive quarks and gluons is also conjectured from high - statistics lattice - qcd calculations , which indicate that , for @xmath213 , the energy density is about 85% of the stefan - boltzmann energy density for the ideal quark - gluon plasma  @xcite .",
    "note that this temperature is not inconsistent with our estimate in ( [ t ] ) . in the fa model ,",
    "the pion suppression is a direct consequence of massless quarks living above the chiral symmetry restoration temperature , i.e. , @xmath214 . in our model , however , the pion suppression is the result of the large baryochemical potential which forbids the creation of light @xmath47 and @xmath4 pairs , allowing abundant production of massive @xmath5 via gluon fragmentation .",
    "this process naturally occurs in the fireball boundary phase ( where @xmath215 ) , and is a consequence of the high nucleon density of lorentz - boosted nuclei . in principle",
    ", it is possible that the muon excess observed in auger data originates in a combination of these two high - temperature qcd phenomena .",
    "note that if ultrahigh - energy cosmic rays are heavy ( or medium mass ) nuclei and the observed muon excess is not the result of a large baryochemical potential suppressing the production of @xmath216 and @xmath4 pairs , but rather an effect of chiral symmetry restoration , then the excess should also be visible at @xmath217 , which corresponds to the center - of - mass energy in collisions of projectile cosmic ray protons with @xmath218 .",
    "this disparity could be use to discriminate among dominance between these two pion - suppression mechanisms .",
    "on the one hand , a model consistent with all data requiring heavy nuclei at the high - energy end of the spectrum is generally considered a bit disappointing  @xcite , especially for neutrino and cosmic - ray astronomy . on the other hand ,",
    "we have shown that even if heavy nuclei dominate at the highest energies , upon scattering in the earth s atmosphere these nuclei could become compelling probes of qcd dynamics at high temperatures , particularly in the not - so - well - understood fireball boundary phase .",
    "should this be the case , future augerprime data would provide relevant information on the strange quark density of the nucleon , complementing measurements at heavy - ion colliders .",
    "for the sake of completeness , in this appendix we provide all of the formulae used for computing the number densities of @xmath219 , @xmath220 , and @xmath221 .",
    "the fermi - dirac and bose - einstein distributions ( [ fd - be ] ) can be rewritten as infinite sums of boltzmann distributions , @xmath222 following  @xcite we introduce the dimensionless variables , @xmath223 and @xmath224 : latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned } z = \\frac{m_i}{t } ;   \\quad \\tau=\\frac{\\sqrt{p^2+m_i^2}}{t } ; \\quad        in terms of @xmath224 and @xmath223 , the number density for the boltzmann distribution can be written as , @xmath226 a closed form expression can be found for @xmath227 in terms of the modified bessel function @xmath228 note that @xmath229 has another representation , which follows from ( [ kn1 ] ) by partial integration , @xmath230 the modified bessel function has a recurrence relation , @xmath231 such that if the expressions for @xmath232 and @xmath233 are known , all the others can be easily obtained . from ( [ kn2 ] )",
    "it is straightforward to obtain @xmath234 and so ( [ nb ] ) becomes @xmath235 for the fermi - dirac distribution , the number density is found to be @xmath236 for the bose - einstein distribution , the number density is given by @xmath237 in the limit @xmath238 and @xmath239 we immediately obtain @xmath240 where @xmath119 is the riemann function . finally , using ( [ fd ] ) and ( [ be ] ) , it is straightforward to obtain ( [ ns ] ) , ( [ nqbar ] ) and ( [ ng ] ) .",
    "our best understanding of the thermodynamical properties of qcd at vanishing baryon density is rooted on high statistics lattice qcd numerical simulations . however , if the baryon density is non - zero , these simulations break down .",
    "the only physically relevant analyses for which the obstacles of lattice qcd can be circumvented are those dealing with small baryon density or , more accurately , small @xmath95 .",
    "namely , if we are interested in the observable @xmath242 , we can expand it in powers of @xmath95 as @xmath243 and try to determine the series coefficients  @xcite .",
    "which values of @xmath95 can be considered _ small enough _ to give reliable results with this procedure is something that can only be determined _ a posteriori _ by the convergence property of the series , limited by the accuracy in the evaluation of the expansion coefficients .",
    "one such observable is the quark - hadron crossover line .",
    "data from heavy - ion colliders suggest that the energy dependence of this line can be parametrized as @xmath244 with @xmath245 , @xmath246 and @xmath247 , and that the baryochemical potential can be parametrized as @xmath248 with @xmath249 and @xmath250  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the lattice - qcd calculation converges towards the quark - hadron crossover line as but it appears to depart from this line at large values of @xmath95  @xcite .",
    "this a widely discussed feature  @xcite which has , however , not been conclusively understood .",
    "( several hadronization schemes have been proposed , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "they differ in the geometry and in the flow velocity profile . )",
    "this perplexing region may well be relevant to cosmic - ray observations .",
    "our results in the region shown in fig",
    ".  [ fig:1 ] , suggest that this is so .",
    "the aires simulation engine  @xcite provides full space - time particle propagation in a realistic environment , taking into account the characteristics of the atmospheric density profile ( using the standard us atmosphere ) , the earth s curvature , and the geomagnetic field ( calculated for the location of auger with an uncertainty of a few percent  @xcite ) .",
    "the following particles are tracked in the monte carlo simulation : photons , electrons , positrons , muons , pions , kaons , eta mesons , lambda baryons , nucleons , antinucleons , and nuclei up to @xmath251 .",
    "the high - energy collisions are processed invoking external hadronic event generators , whereas the low - energy ones are processed using an extension of the hillas splitting algorithm  @xcite .",
    "the aires program consists of various interacting procedures that operate on a data set with a variable number of records .",
    "several data arrays ( or stacks ) are defined .",
    "every record within any of these stacks is a particle entry and represents a physical particle .",
    "the data contained in every record are related to the characteristics of the corresponding particle .",
    "the particles can move inside a volume within the atmosphere where the shower takes place .",
    "this volume is limited by the ground , the injection surfaces , and by vertical planes which limit the region of interest . before starting the simulation ,",
    "all the stacks are empty .",
    "the first action is to add the first stack entry , which corresponds to the primary particle",
    ". then the stack processing loop begins .",
    "the primary is initially located at the injection surface , and its downwards direction of motion defines the shower axis . after the primary s fate has been decided , the corresponding interaction begins to be processed .",
    "the latter generally involves the creation of new particles which are stored in the empty stacks and remain waiting to be processed .",
    "particles entries are removed when one of the following events happen : _",
    "( i ) _  the energy of the particle is below the selected cut energy ; _ ( ii ) _  the particle reaches ground level ; _ ( iii ) _",
    "a particle going upwards reaches the injection surface ; _ ( iv ) _  a particle with quasi - horizontal motion exists the region of interest . after having scanned all the stacks",
    ", it is checked whether or not there are new particle entries pending further processing .",
    "if the answer is positive , then all the stacks are scanned once more ; otherwise the simulation of the shower is complete .    for the present analysis ,",
    "we use the aires module for _ special and/or multiple primary particles_. this useful feature allows to dynamically call a user - defined module that tracks the interactions of a bundle of particles returning a handy list of secondaries , which can be conveniently controlled by the propagating engine for further processing .        c.  a.  garcia canal , s.  j.  sciutto and t.  tarutina , testing hadronic interaction packages at cosmic ray energies , phys .",
