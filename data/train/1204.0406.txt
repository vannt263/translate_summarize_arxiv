    "theoretical studies and huge technological progresses over the last decades made it possible to reach a considerable level of control over quantum states of matter in a large variety of physical systems , ranging from photons , electrons and atoms to bigger solid state systems such as quantum dots and superconducting circuits .",
    "this opened the possibility for novel tests of quantum mechanics and allowed , among other things , to take important steps forward in investigating the quantum regime of macroscopic objects . in this perspective , one of the main goals in today quantum science is controlling nano- and micromechanical oscillators at the quantum level .",
    "quantum optomechanics @xcite , i.e. studying and engineering the radiation pressure interaction of light with mechanical systems , comes as a powerful and well - developed tool to do so .",
    "first , radiation pressure interaction can be exploited to cool a ( nano)micromechanical oscillator to its motional ground - state @xcite ; this is a necessary step for quantum manipulation and could not be accomplished by direct means such as cryogenic cooling ( at the typical mechanical frequencies involved @xmath0 this would require cooling the environment to a temperature of the order @xmath1 ) .",
    "backaction cooling has been experimentally demonstrated for a variety of physical implementations , including micromirrors in fabry - perot cavities @xcite , microtoroidal cavities @xcite or optomechanical crystals @xcite .",
    "second , there exists a strong analogy between quantum optomechanics and non - linear quantum optics , so that many ( if not all ) optomechanical effects can be mapped onto well - known optical effects . as a result , optomechanics becomes a natural way for controlling a mechanical resonator at the quantum level .",
    "experimentally , the strong coupling regime needed to observe quantum behaviors has been demonstrated only very recently @xcite , and detection of quantum effects is still awaiting .",
    "nevertheless , a lot of theoretical studies on the subject has been carried out in the last decade and several proposals have been produced @xcite .",
    "these cover , among other things , the generation of entanglement between one oscillator and the radiation in a fabry - perot cavity @xcite , the generation of entanglement between two oscillators @xcite , or the generation of squeezed mechanical states @xcite .",
    "in particular , references @xcite introduced a new and effective way of enhancing the generation of quantum effects , which relies on applying a periodic modulation to some of the system parameters ( a similar result has also been found in the analogous contest of nanoresonators and microwave cavities @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we further investigate the properties of periodically modulated optomechanical systems and we address the following questions : which is the fundamental link between modulation and enhancement of quantum effects ? is there an optimal choice of the modulation , for which the visibility of quantum effects is maximal ?",
    "is this optimal regime robust against parameter fluctuations ?",
    "what happens when two independent modulations are applied simultaneously ? to tackle these issues we analyze the paradigmatic case of a mechanical oscillator whose natural frequency @xmath2 is externally modulated when it evolves under the action of the noise and of the radiation pressure exerted by the photons of an externally driven optical cavity mode .",
    "while quantum optomechanics is nowadays extensively studied within a variety of experimental setups , the modulation of the mechanical frequency we analyze here is a very crucial aspect of our system and one that has not been implemented yet .",
    "however , very recent proposals for doing optomechanics with levitated dielectric spheres @xcite can be a good answer . in these proposals the mechanical degree of freedom is represented by the center of mass motion of a nanodielectric sphere which is trapped and levitated by means of an optical trap .",
    "the sphere is then put inside an optical cavity , where it interacts with the intracavity radiation via the usual optomechanical hamiltonian ( [ eqdimham ] ) .",
    "the frequency of the center of mass motion depends on the shape of the trapping potential and can thus be modulated adjusting the intensity of the trapping laser , as shown in @xcite . moreover , typical parameters attainable with such setups are comparable to those we have adopted in our simulations ( see below ) , assuring the feasibility of the system under analysis .    in the above scenario we study the formation of squeezing , entanglement and discord  @xcite , showing that in the steady state all these quantum effects are enhanced when the modulation frequency @xmath3 is twice the original value of @xmath2 .",
    "as we shall see , such resonance admits a simple interpretation in terms of an effective parametric phase - locking between the external driving forces and the natural evolution of the involved degree of freedom .",
    "similar enhancements were also observed in refs .",
    "@xcite , where an harmonic modulation of @xmath4 was imposed on the amplitude of the cavity mode laser , and in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a harmonic modulation of @xmath4 was imposed on the coupling rate between two generic bosonic modes . since several mechanisms can lead independently to the same effect , an interesting question is how they can be best exploited to control specific quantum properties in the system .",
    "this goes in the direction of developing optimal quantum control protocols , a topic which is currently benefiting from many contributions @xcite . in the present case , to study the interplay of different mechanisms",
    "we add a second modulation in our model and we observe the arising of interference pattern in the system response .",
    "specifically we notice that the ability in cooling and squeezing the mechanical oscillator strongly depends upon the relative phase of the two modulations , the relative variation being almost 50@xmath5 .",
    "the material is organized as follows . in section [ secsys ]",
    "we present the system and solve its dynamical evolution under the action of a periodic modulation of the mechanical frequency . in section [ secres1 ]",
    "we then characterize the asymptotic stationary state in terms of entanglement , squeezing , etc . in section [ secres2 ]",
    "we compare our findings to other recent proposals @xcite and we study what happens when a second independent modulation is applied to the system [ specifically , in our case we introduce a modulation on the amplitude of the input laser ] .",
    "conclusions and general remarks follows in section [ seccon ] .",
    "some technical derivations are finally reported in appendix  [ appa ] .",
    "our choice falls on the simplest optomechanical system of all , i.e. a fabry - perot cavity of lenght @xmath6 with a movable mirror at one end ( see fig . [ figsys ] ) , which nevertheless captures all interesting physics .",
    "we can reasonably assume @xcite that a single optical mode is interacting with a single mechanical mode , be it the center of mass oscillation .",
    "the mirror can thus be modeled as a mass @xmath7 attached to a spring of characteristic frequency @xmath2 and friction coefficient @xmath8 ; it is described by dimensionless position and momentum operators @xmath9 , @xmath10 which obey the canonical commutation relation @xmath11=i$ ] .",

    "is assumed to be driven by an external laser which , to begin with , we take to have constant power @xmath17 and quasi - resonant frequency @xmath18 . in this context a periodic modulation is inserted at the level of the spring constant , which we express as the following time dependent parametric rescaling of the mirror frequency @xmath19 , \\label{modulation}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath20 . accordingly",

    "@xmath26 is the unperturbed cavity laser detuning while @xmath27 is the radiation vacuum input noise with autocorrelation function @xcite @xmath28 similarly @xmath29 is the brownian noise operator describing the dissipative friction forces acting on the mirror .",
    "its autocorrelation function satisfies the relation  @xcite @xmath30 which for the specific case of an harmonic oscillator with a good quality factor @xmath31 , acquires the same markov character of eq .",
    "( [ eqvacnoise ] ) , i.e. @xmath32 ( this is a consequence of the fact that for @xmath31 only resonant noise components at frequency @xmath33 do sensibly affect the motion of the system ) . in the above expressions @xmath34 is the system temperature while @xmath35 is the anti - comutator  @xcite .",
    "the evolution of the system is ruled by a set ( [ eqset ] ) of non - linear stochastic differential equations with periodic coefficients , whose solution is in general very difficult . in the following we will then introduce some useful approximations to simplify the calculations .",
    "first , we expand each operator as the sum of a c - number mean value and a fluctuation operator , i.e. @xmath36 we recall that the cavity is usually driven by a very strong laser in order to attain satisfactory levels of optomechanical interaction , so that the mean value will be much bigger than the fluctuations , which are due to the presence of random noise .",
    "this allows us to write ( [ eqset ] ) as two different sets of equations , one for the mean values ( [ eqsetmean ] ) , one for the fluctuations ( [ eqsetfluc ] ) and linearize the latter neglecting all terms which are second order small , obtaining @xmath37\\ ; q - \\gamma_m p + g_0 |a|^2,\\\\      \\partial_t \\ ; a = -(k + i \\delta_0 ) a + i g_0 a q + e ,      \\end{cases }      \\label{eqsetmean}\\ ] ]    @xmath38\\ ; & -\\gamma_m & g_0 re[a ] & g_0 im[a ] \\\\",

    "equation  ( [ eqsetfluc ] ) can be also expressed in a more compact form @xmath43 with @xmath44 being a @xmath45 time - dependent matrix , and with @xmath46 and @xmath47 being the column vectors of elements @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively .",
    "we stress that eqs .",
    "( [ eqsetmean ] ) and ( [ eqsetfluc ] ) must be solved in the correct order , because the mean values @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 play the role of coefficients in the equations for the fluctuations .",
    "equation  ( [ eqsetmean ] ) is nonlinear but can be solved numerically . assuming that we are far from optomechanical instabilities and that we keep the modulation strength @xmath53 small enough to avoid additional instabilities due to parametric amplification",
    ", one finds that the mean values evolve toward an asymptotic periodic orbit with the same periodicity @xmath54 of the applied modulation . in this regime ,",
    "an approximate analytic solution can also be derived , which we detail in appendix  [ appa ] .",
    "indeed since the modulation strength @xmath53 is not too strong , one can guess a perturbative expansion of the form @xmath55 where @xmath56 does not depend on @xmath53 , @xmath57 is linear in @xmath53 , @xmath58 is quadratic in @xmath53 and so on .",
    "it turns out that each order is exactly solvable , as long as previous orders are known .",
    "this originates a chained set of equations and by keeping a finite number of orders @xmath59 , we can finally obtain the asymptotic solution up to the desired precision ( e.g. see fig .",
    "[ figmeanqp ] ) .    equation ( [ eqsetfluc ] ) is stochastic and needs some more manipulation .",
    "nonetheless since we have linearized the dynamics and the noises are zero - mean gaussian noises , fluctuations in the stable regime will also evolve to an asymptotic zero - mean gaussian state .",
    "the state of the system is then completely described by the correlation matrix @xmath60 of elements @xmath61 whose evolution can be derived directly from equations ( [ eqcomp ] ) and ( [ eqcorrmat ] ) : @xmath62 where @xmath63 is transpose of @xmath44 , and where @xmath64 is the diagonal noise correlation matrix with diagonal entries @xmath65 , defined by @xmath66 equation ( [ eqcomp2 ] ) is now an ordinary linear differential equation .",
    "we know that its solution evolves toward a unique asymptotic configuration ( independently of the initial state ) , proven that the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath44 have negative real part for all times @xmath67 , which can be verified by applying the routh - hurwitz criterion @xcite .",
    "again , we can either solve eq .",
    "( [ eqcomp2 ] ) numerically or obtain an approximate analytic solution with a perturbative expansion in @xmath53 ( see appendix  [ appa ] for the latter ) .",
    "as already mentioned , thanks to gaussianity of the asymptotic solution all relevant informations about the system can be extracted directly from the correlation matrix @xmath60 . in particular",
    "we will focus on the following quantities : the number of phonons in the mirror , the squeezing in the mirror and in the radiation quadratures , and the nonclassical correlation between the mirror and the radiation degrees of freedom .",
    "the number of phonons @xmath68 can be expressed using the approximate relation @xmath69 which holds if the modulation of the mechanical frequency is not too strong .",
    "this tells how far the system is from the ground state .",
    "since both @xmath70 and @xmath71 are periodic in time , we will identify the number of phonons with the maximum over one period @xmath72 of the modulation , i.e. @xmath73 ( here and in the following @xmath74 represents an optimization with respect to a time interval @xmath75 $ ] with @xmath76 being sufficiently larger than @xmath77 to guarantee that the system has reached the asymptotic steady state ) .     and momentum mean values @xmath51 obtained by numerically integrating eq .",

    "the plot has been obtained by setting the system parameters as detailed in sec .",
    "[ secres1 ] : in particular here the modulation frequency @xmath3 is twice the natural frequency @xmath2 of the mechanical oscillator which , in turn , is resonant with the detuning @xmath81 that governs the free evolution of the optical field @xmath52 . the analytic solution for the asymptotic orbit ( see appendix  [ appsinglemod ] ) is also shown for comparison ( thick red line).,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    squeezing of the generalized mirror quadratures @xmath82 is also easily found : @xmath83 again we construct a time independent quantity to deal with .",
    "first , for each time @xmath67 we select the parameter @xmath84 for which @xmath85 is minimum . in terms of covariance matrix , this is just the smaller eigenvalue of the block matrix @xmath86 .",
    "we then minimize this quantity with respect to time over a period @xmath87 .",
    "this tells how much squeezing can be produced at most . @xmath88",
    "analogous formulas for the radiation quadratures lead to @xmath89 non - classical correlations in the system can be described using quantum discord @xmath90  @xcite , which includes entanglement as well as more general quantum correlations that are shown also by separable states @xcite . for a gaussian state ,",
    "@xmath90 is easily constructed from the correlation matrix as demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "time dependance is then eliminated by considering @xmath91 entanglement alone will be specifically described using logarithmic negativity @xmath92 @xcite , which is also easily constructed from the correlation matrix as demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "again , time dependance is eliminated by considering @xmath93",
    "we now present the results obtained by solving the dynamics of the system as detailed in the previous section .",
    "the parameters used in our analysis are @xmath94 ng , @xmath95 mhz , @xmath96 hz , @xmath97 k , @xmath98 , @xmath99 mm , @xmath100 mhz , @xmath101 nm and @xmath102 mw : this choice is compatible with values attained in state of the art experiments and is also consistent with the stability requirement of section [ secsol ] ( furthermore , under the condition @xmath98 the optical and the mechanical variables are brought at resonance ) .",
    "the strength @xmath53 and the frequency @xmath3 of the modulation are left as variable parameters instead , since we want to characterize the optimal modulation regime , e.g. which @xmath53 and @xmath3 maximize the visibility of quantum effects .",

    "+ we then focus on the solution of equation ( [ eqcomp2 ] ) and we plot the quantities described in section [ secquantumprop ] , for multiple values of @xmath105 $ ] , @xmath106 $ ] . in particular : fig .",

    "( [ eqmaxdiscord ] ) ; and the minimum variance @xmath110 of all the mirror generalized quadratures , computed via eq .",
    "( [ eqminmirrorvariance ] ) .    as evident from the plots , the level of squeezing and entanglement is maximum when the modulation frequency is @xmath111 and increases monotonically with respect to the strength @xmath53 , until the system eventually reaches an instability point for too strong modulations ( in the above figures , this instability is represented by a blank region around the point @xmath112 , @xmath113 ) .",
    "it is also clear that the optimal modulation , the one that most enhances quantum effects , is also responsible for heating the system far from its ground state",
    ".    we can understand this behavior if we interpret eq .",
    "( [ eqcomp2 ] ) as describing the dynamics of a set of ( classical ) parametric oscillators with canonical coordinates defined by the correlations functions @xmath114 ( [ eqcorrmat ] ) , which evolve under the action of damping and constant external driving forces . indeed , by a close inspection of the matrix @xmath44 one notices that such oscillators possess natural frequencies which are periodically modulated through functions ( i.e. @xmath52 , @xmath50 , and the direct term @xmath115 )",
    "that , in first approximation , evolve sinusoidally with the same frequency @xmath3  see eq .",
    "( [ eqqanalytic1mod ] ) in appendix  [ appa ] for details .",
    "moreover , in the stability region we are sure that parametric modulation pumps energy into the system at a lower rate with respect to losses , since the system evolves toward a stationary orbit : we call this regime `` below - threshold '' to distinguish it from the exponential amplification usually associated with parametric oscillators . for this",
    "model phase - locking is expected to occur when @xmath3 matches the zero - order eigenfrequencies defined by the constant part of @xmath44 ( and not twice this frequencies as in the case of parametric instability ) , resulting in an enhancement of the oscillations of the effective coordinates @xmath114 ( [ eqcorrmat ] ) and hence of the associated quantum effects defined in sec .",
    "[ secquantumprop ]  @xcite ( more details are found in appendix  [ appa ] ) .",
    "it turns out that , at least for the figure of merit we are concerned here ( i.e. @xmath110 , @xmath116 , @xmath109 , etc ) the relevant frequency is indeed @xmath117 .    to see this , we can procede by steps .",
    "first of all notice that from the numerical solution , we can guarantee that the system is not unstable ( see fig .  [ figmaxphonons ] ) , i.e. that it is indeed in the below - threshold regime . next ,",
    "consider the case of no coupling ( @xmath118 ) and no modulation ( @xmath119 ) : we stress out three relevant aspects .",
    "first , the mechanical part and the radiation part are independent , so there is no entanglement .",
    "second , each subsystem evolves with the hamiltonian of a quantum harmonic oscillator , so the quadrature mean value @xmath120 evolves with a phase @xmath121 and the variance @xmath122 with a phase @xmath123 ( we remind that we fixed @xmath124 ) .",
    "this tells us that , at least in this regime , the frequencies which govern the quantities of interest are degenerate at the value @xmath4 .",
    "third , each subsystem is also coupled to its own environment and will eventually relax to a thermal state characterized by @xmath125 , so there is no squeezing . now turn on the coupling @xmath126",
    ": this has three main effects .",
    "first it introduces entanglement in the system @xcite ( @xmath127 ) .",
    "second the eigenfrequencies are brought out of degeneracy and shifted by a term @xmath128 @xcite , which is quite small with respect to @xmath4 for our choice of values ( confirming that indeed the latter is the resonant value at which the modulation should provide an enhancement ) .",
    "third , backaction cooling @xcite is now active and the oscillator approaches the ground state @xmath129 .",
    "squeezing is still absent at this level .",
    "finally , turn on the modulation  ( [ modulation ] ) .",
    "thanks to the phase - locking mechanism we have anticipated previously and detailed in appendix  [ appa ] this will yield an enhancement of the correlations when @xmath3 matches the natural frequency @xmath130 . for instance , for the negative entropy @xmath131 and for mirror variance @xmath132 , we get @xmath133 where @xmath134 and @xmath135 are associated response functions analogous to the lorentzian response of a simple harmonic oscillator  ( though an exact expression is rather cumbersome in our specific case ) and are peaked around @xmath113 .",
    "we see that the quadrature @xmath136 gets periodically squeezed over time and entanglement is periodically increased to higher values with respect to the unmodulated case .",
    "in addition , these effects increase monotonically with @xmath53 , up to the instability threshold . a similar enhancement of the entanglement is also described in ref .",
    "@xcite , where two harmonic oscillators are coupled via linear interaction @xmath137 and the coupling constant is a periodic function of time .",
    "this time dependance produces an effective modulation on the normal frequencies of the system : as a result , entanglement is shown to increase and become much more robust against temperature .",
    "this agrees very well with what we found here .",
    "results analogous to those presented in the previous section has been found very recently by mari and eisert @xcite , for an optomechanical system driven with an amplitude modulated input laser . for clarity ,",
    "we rewrite their hamiltonian @xmath138 at first sight , the situation appears to be somewhat different from our initial problem . in eq .",
    "( [ eqmariham ] ) , internal parameters of the system are left unchanged ; it is instead the external driving that undergoes an oscillatory behavior .",
    "nevertheless the effects are strikingly similar : high levels of squeezing can be attained when the frequency of modulation is @xmath113 @xcite , and the same regime is also optimal to enhance entanglement between mechanical and radiation modes @xcite the authors themselves comment that _  ... this dynamics reminds of the effect of parametric amplification , as if the spring constant of the mechanical motion was varied in time with just twice the frequency of the mechanical motion , leading to the squeezing of the mechanical mode ... \" _ @xcite .    in fact",
    "there is a strong analogy between the two cases .",
    "independently of what hamiltonian ( [ eqdimham ] ) or ( [ eqmariham ] ) one chooses , far from instability regions the mean values @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 will be characterized by an asymptotic periodic orbit with the same periodicity of the applied modulation @xmath72 .",
    "this assures that in both cases the equation ( [ eqcomp2 ] ) for the covariance matrix has the same linear form , with @xmath44 being a periodic function of time ( in the limit @xmath139 ) and @xmath64 being a constant driving .",
    "the conclusions we derived in section [ secres1 ] , must therefore hold , at least qualitatively , also for the system studied in @xcite .",
    "an interesting question now rises .",
    "what if the two modulations are applied together ? can they interfere , either constructively or destructively , and sensibly alter the one - modulation picture ?    to get an answer , we consider a new composite system , described by the hamiltonian @xmath140 note that we explicitly introduced a relative phase @xmath141 between the two applied modulation : if we expect any interference , the properties of the system should indeed depend on this new variable .",
    "the analysis presented in the previous sections is straightforwardly generalized to the present case , so we will skip directly to the results [ details can be found however in the appendix ] . taking the same parameters as in sec .",
    "[ secres1 ] , we choose the optimal modulation frequencies @xmath142 and fix @xmath143 , @xmath144 ( this is the same value used in @xcite ) .",
    "these modulation strengths give comparable squeezing performances when considered singularly , and also assure that we are reasonably far from the instability region .",
    "to present the results , we plot the quantities introduced in sec .",
    "[ secquantumprop ] against the relative phase @xmath141 in fig .",
    "[ figtwomodphonons ] .",
    "an interference pattern is indeed evident and each of the above quantities oscillates between a minimum and a maximum as @xmath141 varies in the range @xmath145 $ ] .",
    "however , entanglement and quantum discord are affected very weakly and do not differ much from our initial one - modulation case . besides we see that in order to generate quantum correlations , a modulation of the mechanical frequency is more suitable than a modulation of the driving laser amplitude .",
    "adding the second modulation to the first is of little effect .    squeezing generation instead ,",
    "presents very interesting features .",
    "first , as we said , we choose two modulations that give comparable levels of squeezing when applied individually .",
    "moreover , when applied together , they can strongly interfere .",
    "for example we see in fig .",
    "[ figtwomodphonons](d ) that for a phase @xmath146 , @xmath110 rises toward the threshold value @xmath147 and squeezing becomes weaker .",
    "each modulation taken alone would generate more squeezing than the two combined : this is an unambiguous sign of a disadvantageous interplay . for a phase @xmath148",
    "we find instead a great advantage in applying two modulations : @xmath110 is lowered to a value @xmath149 , a considerable performance if compared to our initial one - modulation case where instabilities prevent us from reaching @xmath150 .",
    "in fact , not only we attain the same high levels of squeezing , but we are also well inside the stability region , so that we could increase both @xmath53 and @xmath151 to perform even better .",
    "we also note that the optimal(worst ) phase choice for squeezing generation also corresponds to maximum heating(cooling ) of the mirror , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ figtwomodphonons](a ) .",
    "this is another confirmation that parametric oscillation is indeed the main underlying mechanism : in fact not only does a stronger modulation enhance the generation of quantum effects , as inferred from equations ( [ new ] ) , it also pumps more energy into the system .",
    "we then see how the interplay between two independent modulations can be carefully exploited to increase levels of squeezing in an optomechanical system .",
    "we have studied in great detail the effect of periodic modulations on optomechanical systems and we have characterized several ways in which such modulations can be exploited to enhance relevant quantum properties including squeezing , entanglement and quantum discord .",
    "while the idea that modulations can help accessing the quantum regime was already known from previous works @xcite , we have proposed a new interpretation of this enhancement mechanism in terms of a resonance between the modulation frequency and the natural frequencies of the system .",
    "this simple model allowed us to prove the existence of an optimal modulation regime and to understand the arising of instability thresholds .",
    "finally , we have analyzed the interplay of different modulations and we have found that constructive ( destructive ) interference effects may arise when they are applied simultaneously , causing a further enhancement ( a suppression ) of quantum effects .",
    "we believe that these results could lead further on toward the development of optimal control strategies .",

    "as anticipated in the main text the evolution of the correlations matrix describes the dynamics of a multi - dimensional ( classical ) oscillator which evolves in presence of damping and external constant driving ( defined by the matrix @xmath64 ) and which possesses characteristic frequencies ( determined by @xmath153 ) that are externally modulated at frequency @xmath3 [ these statements are explicitly verified in secs .",

    "for this simple scenario , two cases are possible .",
    "if @xmath161 ( above - threshold condition ) , parametric modulation pumps energy into the system at a faster rate with respect to dissipation ; the system increases its energy exponentially and is therefore unstable . if @xmath162 ( below - threshold condition ) , the system reaches a stationary regime , given by the balance of pumping and dissipation",

    "clearly the superimposed oscillation , which we remind is an effect of the parametric modulation , will be much greater near resonance with the natural frequency @xmath169 and for @xmath158 just below the instability threshold . going to second order in @xmath158 yields small deviation from this picture and",
    "we can stop our qualitative analysis here . in summary , parametric modulation can controllably enhance oscillations of the system coordinates if two main conditions are satisfied : the modulation must not be too strong , otherwise the system becomes unstable , and an external ( constant ) driving",
    "must also be applied , otherwise the system relaxes to @xmath170 ( as from eq .",

    "we also stress out that , in the below - threshold regime , the resonance condition is given by @xmath169 ( i.e. the modulation frequency should be the same as the natural frequency of the system ) and not by @xmath172 , as is the usual case of exponential parametric amplification .      turning back to eq .",
    "( [ eqcomp2 ] ) , we will see that all conditions are indeed satisfied : the coefficient matrix @xmath153 is periodically modulated over time , stability can be verified with a numeric solution and external driving is provided by the noise correlation function @xmath64 .",
    "the above result implies that in the case of our multi - dimensional parametric oscillator , maximum enhancement of the oscillations is expected when @xmath3 matches the characteristic frequencies that govern the dynamics of the correlation functions in absence of the modulation .",

    "hence we can say , at least qualitatively , that squeezing will be dominated by first order effects in the range of values considered . on the contrary",
    "the number of phonons can be considered time - independent , with oscillations that are negligible if compared to the constant term .",
    "moreover , we know that the mirror is cooled close to its ground state when the system is unmodulated",
    ". therefore the number of phonons is strongly dependent on @xmath226 , and the constant shift due to second order effects becomes quickly the dominant effect .",
    "these results agree very well with the numerical simulation summarized in fig .",
    "[ figmaxphonons ] .",
    "we conclude this section with one last comment on why the number of phonons is constant in time . we know that the position @xmath50 and momentum @xmath51 of the mirror oscillate with frequency @xmath227 and a relative phase shift of @xmath228 ( slight modifications being induced by the interaction with the optical subsystem ) . in the same way @xmath229 and @xmath230 oscillate with twice this frequency , i.e. @xmath231 , and with twice this relative phase shift , i.e. @xmath232 . in turn , the two oscillations cancel each other out when summing @xmath222 and @xmath233 , thus giving a time - independent number of phonons .",
    "in addition we see that the modulation is most effective on the mirror correlations when @xmath234 , as stated before .",
    "we now reintroduce the second modulation and study the interplay between the two .",
    "again we would like to fix all parameters except @xmath53 , @xmath151 and @xmath141 to the values found in the main text .",
    "however , already at the classical level , expressions for @xmath52 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 tend to become rather long and complex since we have now 3 free parameters .",
    "therefore we will substitute also the numerical values of @xmath53 and @xmath151 ( values are found in sec .",
    "[ secres2 ] ) .",
    "this is not so bad : indeed recall that we are particularly interested in the dependence of quantum properties on the relative phase @xmath141 .",
    "for example we report the expression of the mirror position @xmath50 + @xmath235 + without losing much time on the cumbersome formula above , we only point out that again first order effects are dominating ( as we can see by comparing oscillations at @xmath3 and oscillations at @xmath197 ) .",
    "however we also see that , already at the classical level , the the phase @xmath141 has a strong influence on the amplitude of oscillations .",
    "this is a clear sign that the phase plays indeed an important role in the system dynamics .",
    "+   +      we turn now to quantum properties of the system .",
    "again we fix all parameters at the values used above , except for the relative phase @xmath141 . to second order in the perturbation ,",
    "we get expressions for the number of phonons and the correlation @xmath224 that depends on the phase as +        where for brevity we have neglected the smallest terms .",
    "looking at expression  ( [ eqphononsphase ] ) above , it is clear that the main effects of the modulation are contained in the first and third terms , other terms being an order of magnitude smaller than the two .",
    "the two bigger terms are both independent of time ( similarly to the single modulation case ) , hence they must come either from the unmodulated solution @xmath238 or from the constant part of the second order solution @xmath239 . again , since in the unmodulated scenario the mirror is very close to its ground state , we can reasonably assume that the matrix @xmath238 contributes in a negligible way .",
    "therefore , the dependance of @xmath240 on the phase @xmath141 is almost entirely described by the matrix @xmath239 and is a second order effect in the modulation strengths @xmath53 and @xmath151 .",
    "the maximum number of phonons ( i.e. eq .  ( [ eqphononsphase ] ) maximized over one period @xmath241 of evolution ) , as well as the various contributions described here , are plotted in fig .",
    "[ figphononsanalytic ] .",
    "we see that the analytic approximation correctly resembles the numeric solution ( see fig .",
    "[ figtwomodphonons ] ) , the two differing only by a small constant shift which is due to higher order corrections .",
    "however , the qualitative behavior is fully understood already at the second order ; therefore we do not report here explicitly higher orders contributions .    from eq .",
    "( [ eqc11phase ] ) , we see that @xmath222 ( and similarly @xmath233 ) undergoes strong oscillations in time , reaching a minimum value that depends much on the phase @xmath141 .",
    "this tells us that mechanical squeezing will have a very similar behavior and hence will also depend strongly on @xmath141 .",
    "entanglement and quantum discord have instead a much smaller response .",
    "indeed , both quantities are computed using all entries of the matrix @xmath205 ( and not only two entries as in the case of phonons ) .",
    "each entry will have an expression similar to  ( [ eqc11phase ] ) and made of three parts : a constant part , a time independent part which oscillates with the relative phase @xmath141 and a time dependent part .",
