    "a crucial point is that if the two probes are attached to a common environmental point ( cb case ) , i.e. @xmath32 , we have @xmath33 and @xmath34 @xcite , whereas for probes attached to two independent environments ( sb case ) we would have @xmath35 , i.e. no cross terms .",

    "the dependence on probes distance at @xmath37 and long times is then @xmath38 note that in the weak damping regime we are considering here , the dissipation rate @xmath39 is much smaller than the frequencies of the problem , which guarantees that at times where the quantum units start ` feeling ' dissipation , the sinc function is well approximated by a delta .",
    "notice that an immediate consequence , previously observed in @xcite , but scarcely commented upon , is that for 1d homogeneous environments , irrespective of the dispersion relation , we have @xmath40 , since the frequency resonance constraint exhausts all freedom in choosing the crystal momenta in eq . ( [ 0tcross ] ) .",
    "this means that two probes will experience collective dissipation not only when attached to the same point of the environment but also when at the anti - nodes of the resonant mode @xcite . in this case",
    "the relative position or the center of mass of the pair is shielded from decoherence , allowing to preserve entanglement among the probes at large distances .",
    "indeed the surprising results is the lack of asymptotic cross - damping decay above any distance , being the cross - over between sb and cb periodically predicted .",
    "further , if the relative size of cross - damping and self - damping are considered , this result is unchanged when increasing the temperature of the thermal bath ( this is due to @xmath41 factoring out of the integrals because it depends only on the frequency ) .",

    "this localization effect @xcite hinders the periodic cross - over between cb and sb leading to a spatial decay : beyond some distance , two independent probes will dissipate into sb .",
    "when moving to @xmath46 a common assumption in several phenomenological approaches , either based on spin - boson @xcite or boson - boson models @xcite , is the isotropy of the dispersion relation of the environment , i.e. its dependence only on the modulus @xmath47 .",
    "this is the case for electromagnetic environment @xcite .",

    "does the transition from cb to sb we have seen up to now have to do with the correlation length of the environment ?",
    "the quick answer is no , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig4]a and b. the cross- and self - damping terms in the dissipation equation ( [ lindblad ] ) come from bath operator spatial correlation functions @xmath103 at two times .",

    "the correlation in the crystal at two different points comes from functions at equal time @xmath107 and follows from all phonons momenta .",
    "in other words cross - damping is caused by _ resonant _",
    "phonons , while generic correlations in the crystal are caused by interference of _ all _ phonons thus decaying with distance even in 1d ( fig .",
    "[ fig4]a ) .",
    "usually , as in our case , the bath is in a stationary ( thermal ) state , and thus the correlation function is time - independent @xmath108 , with @xmath109/\\omega_{\\vec{k}}$ ] .",
    "the 2d case ( fig .",
    "[ fig4]b and c ) clearly displays spatial correlations decay at distances of the order of the crystal lattice @xmath110 ( notice that all spatial coordinates are scaled with @xmath111 in the rest of the manuscript ) , being stronger along crystal directions , while the cross - talk decays on a scale given by the resonant normal mode wave - length @xmath112 ( isotropic case ) or does not decay at all ( anisotropic case ) .",
    "our conclusions can be generalized to other system - bath models , e.g. where the environment is a non - interacting field which exchanges excitations with the system probes : i.e a collection of free particles with a given dispersion relation @xmath113 whose eigenfunctions have a spatial profile @xmath114 , so that the bath hamiltonian is @xmath115 ( or @xmath116 for continuous spectra ) ; the exchange interaction between bath and system probes being @xmath117b_{\\vec{k}}^\\dagger+h.c.$ ] , so probe 1 is located at @xmath16 and probe 2 at @xmath118 . in such case and assuming secular and born - markov regime , the cross - talk is given by @xmath119 where the function @xmath120 is related to how the probes couple to each mode .",
    "the free particles could be bogoliubov bosons on top of a condensate in an optical lattice , electrons in the bulk , phonons in a crystal with disorder ( as in the main text ) or any other free particles which , because of the locality and weakness of the probe - bath coupling lead to such master equation with this cross - term .",
    "the delta function is a consequence of the fact that the system - bath is energy exchanging , and thus that we have _",
    "dissipation_. note also that we have assumed that different bath modes are uncorrelated and stationary , as usual in e.g. a thermal state .",
    "the bath free field can be expressed in terms of the single - particle operators , leading to a correlation function @xmath121 ( notice that there are two generic functions @xmath122 and @xmath123 which are model - dependent ) . for non - interacting fields",
    "it is thus clear that cb / sb cross - over distance is unrelated to the correlation length in the medium , simply because the former is propagated by resonant free particles , while the latter is propagated by all particles .",
    "other models with more complicated interactions than just particle exchange , or even interacting models for the bath , might yield different behaviours and are subject of future interest .",
    "we comment now on how the phenomenology studied for the d - dimensional crystal translates into this generic class of models : a ) in the 1d case the cross - damping will be of the form @xmath124 , meaning that the overlap of mode functions ( of eigenmode @xmath104 ) between the two probe positions will dictate the decay from cb to sb , i.e. the spatial shape of @xmath125 , be it localized or periodic , will lead to decay or non - decay respectively ; b ) the very peculiar behaviour observed in fig .",
    "[ fig2]c , d requires very well - matched interference of plane waves ( thus a translational invariant medium ) and thus is not to be expected in general ; c ) the short / long time argument is based on the nature of the _ sinc _ function and thus independent on the details of the model , hence any possible long - range cross - damping will take a time to build up , related with the fastest excitations in the environment ; finally , d ) also irrespective of the details of the bath model , the presence of a probe with finite spatial extension will blur any short - range ( high momentum ) details , leading to a high - momentum cutoff in the integrals defining the coefficients of the master equation .",
    "a further interesting point is to consider the comparison with the case of a _ dephasing model_. in that situation the cross - talk will _ not _ have any resonance constraint imposed , and thus the two integrals eqs .",
    "( [ cross ] ) and ( [ correl ] ) will be similar except for the functions @xmath126 and @xmath127 , leading to similar behaviours .",
    "some typical bath s spectral densities ( encoding function @xmath120 and the density of states of the bath ) @xmath128 favour small momenta in the cross - talk for 1d , while for 3d they favour frequencies / momenta near the cut - off frequency @xmath82 @xcite .",
    "thus for pure dephasing the cb to sb transition length will be similar to the correlation length of the environment .",
    "one possible way to experimentally implement the 2d crystal is via trapped ions with a tight axial confinement so that they effectively lie on a plane and form a triangular - symmetric coulomb crystal , such as in @xcite .",
    "the major problem in that setting is that axial motion is coupled to radial degrees of motion , but this can be overcome if the axial frequency is sufficiently higher than the radial counterpart .",
    "the probe ions would need to be sitting in the same plane thus distorting the modes of the coulomb crystal .",
    "therefore the modelling would be slightly more complicated , although the basic physics would be the same .",
    "addressability of the probe ions , e.g. by fluorescence @xcite , would be a central requirement .",
    "another possible way of investigation is the intentional deposition of atoms adsorbed in metallic surfaces .",
    "this has always been considered as a drawback and a source of anomalous heating in ion trap electrodes @xcite , but could suit our purposes .",
    "adsorbed atoms bound to a metallic surface can have oscillation frequencies in the thz regime , very close to debye frequencies of metals ( gold for example has a debye frequency of around 3.6 thz ) . in this way , by placing intentionally adsorbed atoms at different distances would allow us to check our results .",
    "different masses of these atoms would scan the different frequencies as compared to the maximum phonon frequency of the metallic substrate . for this to be possible",
    "we should deal with fluorescent adatoms which can be addressed and localized by lasers .",
    "investigation of cross - damping could be done by exciting the motion of one atom and evaluating the effect on the other .",
    "a coupling of the fluorescent transition to the motional degree of freedom would probably be needed , though .",
    "an immediate consequence of this work is that initial correlations between two dissipating units will be highly sensitive to details of the underlying medium , such as crystal symmetries .",
    "this suggests a possible avenue to use multi - party quantum systems to test / probe media with unknown properties .",
    "one could further envision the use of a lattice of coupled probes to obtain information of an unknown surface through the decay of spatial modes of the probe - lattice . in this direction , recent work @xcite has shown that a single trapped ion can be confined near a metallic surface to extract electric - field noise characteristics through its heating rate .",
    "also , in view of recent proposals to use surface acoustic waves as a quantum bus between many different types of quantum systems @xcite , the phenomenon of preferential directions seen in figures  [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] could be potentially used to build substrates with a patterned surface whose symmetry allows for distant units to communicate along diagonal / triangular directions with a decay only given by static imperfection ( disorder ) of the material .",
    "all these avenues are left for future investigation .",
    "do the separate units of a spatially extended system suffer dissipation and decoherence from common or separate baths",
    "? we tackled this fundamental issue introducing a microscopic environment model where spatial distances and correlations appear naturally . beside the ineffectiveness of environment spatial correlations to determine this transition , we have shown the importance of dimensionality , symmetries and probes extensions .",
    "the prediction of collective dissipation between distant probes in a 1d homogeneous environment when placed at a distance multiple of @xmath129 opens up interesting possibilities in surface phononic cavities @xcite and phonon wave - guides @xcite .",
    "similar predictions can hold for planar or bulk platforms environments , for probes at relative position now determined both by their oscillations frequency and the crystal symmetries . indeed when @xmath46 , the dispersion is isotropic for @xmath130 , with @xmath131 the effective propagation velocity in the medium and @xmath132 either wavelength of the crystal periodicity or the mean distance between disorder patches in an otherwise homogeneous medium @xcite .",
    "the anisotropy opens a communication channel ( resulting from the interference of a manifold of resonant phonons ) between the probes , even at large distance while the effect is degraded in presence of disorder . on the other hand",

    "<S> practical implementations of quantum technology are limited by unavoidable effects of decoherence and dissipation . with </S>",
    "<S> achieved experimental control for individual atoms and photons , more complex platforms composed by several units can be assembled enabling distinctive forms of dissipation and decoherence , in independent heat baths or collectively into a common bath , with dramatic consequences for the preservation of quantum coherence . </S>",
    "<S> the cross - over between these two regimes has been widely attributed in the literature to the system units being farther apart than the bath s correlation length . </S>",
    "<S> starting from a microscopic model of a structured environment ( a crystal ) sensed by two bosonic probes , here we show the failure of such conceptual relation , and identify the exact physical mechanism underlying this cross - over , displaying a sharp contrast between dephasing and dissipative baths . </S>",
    "<S> depending on the frequency of the system and , crucially , on its orientation with respect to the crystal axes , collective dissipation becomes possible for very large distances between probes , opening new avenues to deal with decoherence in phononic baths .    </S>",
    "<S> models for quantum dissipation address the interaction of a quantum system with bosonic , fermionic or other kinds of environments , where the relevant information about the microscopic structure of the environment is encoded in its spectral density @xcite . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> further information is required to properly describe spatially extended multipartite systems : an often used generalization is the independent dissipation of the system s components into separate baths ( sb ) , leading to complete erasure of quantum correlations @xcite . also , collective or spatially symmetric decoherence into a common bath ( cb ) @xcite has been proposed as an alternative scenario in the limit of small system size ( or components separation ) in comparison with environment correlation length or with radiating atoms transition wave - length @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a cb opens up outstanding possibilities like superradiance @xcite , superdecoherence @xcite , and decoherence free / noiseless subspaces @xcite , allowing the preservation and also creation of entanglement @xcite , the emergence of collective synchronization @xcite , with potential applications in quantum computation @xcite and metrology @xcite .    besides artificial methods to engineer collective dissipation mechanisms @xcite , the cross - over between cb to sb can naturally arise in structured environments . </S>",
    "<S> the still open and fundamental question is : _ how small needs to be a multipartite system to dissipate collectively ? _ the cb / sb cross - over when increasing the size of spatially extended systems has been phenomenologically modeled in the last decade yielding a smooth change and , generally , assuming isotropic dispersion relations of bosonic environments @xcite ( like it happens for electromagnetic radiation in free - space @xcite ) . assuming a distance dependent transition from collective to independent dissipation , important predictions </S>",
    "<S> have been reported in the context of quantum error correction @xcite , in the dynamics of photosynthetic complexes @xcite and in quantum metrology @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> even if a microscopic derivation of the cb / sb cross - over is _ still missing _ in spatially structured environments , it is usually argued that a common environmental medium with significant spatial correlations up to distances @xmath0 will produce both damping for each system unit and a _ cross - damping _ among them : a collective dissipation is therefore generally associated to systems smaller than the correlation length @xmath0 , while units far away will be damped independently in sb . </S>",
    "<S> here we are going to show the failure of this prediction for a large class of energy - matter exchange dissipation models , particularizing to a specific microscopic model to clarify and illustrate several details : a phonon bath in a crystal probed at different spatial locations . </S>",
    "<S> we address the cross - over from cb to sb in detail , providing a physical ground for the description of intermediate regimes , and assessing the role played by geometric factors , spatial extension of the system - probe contact and bath correlations . </S>",
    "<S> our model allows to clarify several issues including : a ) why when increasing the system size in 1d environments @xcite there is no asymptotic interpolation between cb and sb , but a periodic cross - over ; b ) why choosing an isotropic environmental dispersion relation will always lead to distance - decaying cross - damping , c ) why anisotropic dispersion relations ( like those in real crystals with symmetries ) can lead to surprising effects like cb at large distances , also showing d ) that in general the correlation length is _ not _ related to the cb / sb transition . </S>",
    "<S> we further e ) give a simple intuitive picture of how a bath s frequency cutoff appears naturally from the fact that the system s quantum units have a finite spatial extent , and f ) we show how the presence of static disorder favours sb dissipation .    for clarity we introduce next a particular model displaying all the phenomenology , and leave the discussion on the generality of these effects to the last section . </S>"
