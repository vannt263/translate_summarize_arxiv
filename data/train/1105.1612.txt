    "the theory of discrete analytic functions has been developed in recent years based on the theory of circle packings or circle patterns , which was initiated by thurston s idea of using circle packings as an approximation of the riemann mapping@xcite .",

    "it is known that certain circle patterns with fixed regular combinatorics admit rich structure .",
    "for example , it has been pointed out that the circle patterns with square grid combinatorics introduced by schramm@xcite and the hexagonal circle patterns@xcite are related to integrable systems .",
    "some explicit examples of discrete analogues of analytic functions have been presented which are associated with schramm s patterns : @xmath1 , @xmath2 , airy function@xcite , @xmath3 , @xmath4@xcite . also , discrete analogues of @xmath3 and @xmath4 associated with hexagonal circle patterns are discussed in @xcite .    among those examples",
    ", it is remarkable that the discrete analogue of the power function @xmath3 associated with the circle patterns of schramm type has a close relationship with the sixth painlev equation ( p@xmath5)@xcite .",
    "it is desirable to construct a representation formula for the discrete power function in terms of the painlev transcendents as was mentioned in @xcite .",
    "the discrete power function can be formulated as a solution to a system of difference equations on the square lattice @xmath6 with a certain initial condition . a correspondence between the dependent variable of this system and the painlev transcendents can be found in @xcite , but the formula seems somewhat indirect .",
    "agafonov has constructed a formula for the radii of circles of the associated circle pattern at some special points on @xmath7 in terms of the gauss hypergeometric function@xcite . in this paper",
    ", we aim to establish an explicit representation formula of the discrete power function itself in terms of the hypergeometric @xmath0 function of p@xmath5 which is valid on @xmath8 and for @xmath9 .",
    "based on this formula , we generalize the domain of the discrete power function to a discrete analogue of the riemann surface .    on the other hand ,",
    "the fact that the discrete power function is related to p@xmath5 has been used to establish the immersion property@xcite and embeddedness@xcite of the discrete power function with real exponent .",
    "although we can not expect such properties and thus the correspondence to a certain circle pattern for general complex exponent , we have found a special case of @xmath10 where the discrete power function is an immersion .",

    "<S> we present an explicit formula for the discrete power function introduced by bobenko , which is expressed in terms of the hypergeometric @xmath0 functions for the sixth painlev equation . </S>",
    "<S> the original definition of the discrete power function imposes strict conditions on the domain and the value of the exponent . </S>",
    "<S> however , we show that one can extend the value of the exponent to arbitrary complex numbers except even integers and the domain to a discrete analogue of the riemann surface . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we show that the discrete power function is an immersion when the real part of the exponent is equal to one . </S>"
