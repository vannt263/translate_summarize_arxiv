    "mode coupling and conversion are commonly known and primarily important phenomena in fiber and integrated optics , either hindering or fueling the operation of numerous devices and elements , e.g. , electro - optical and acousto - optical switches and modulators , waveguide couples , power splitters , wavelength filters , and others  @xcite . when a mode of certain configuration transverses the structure and converts into some other mode , say , due to the externally induced perturbation in optical properties or geometrical configuration of the structure or due to the imperfectness of the materials used , or when the exchange of energy between the guided modes of adjacent waveguides occurs  anyway we face the phenomena of mode coupling and conversion .",
    "the crucial regime for the mode coupling is in the vicinity of the points of virtual phase matching ( otherwise referred to as `` anticrossings '' or `` avoided crossings ''  a terminology brought about from quantum mechanics and solid - state physics ) . at anticrossings ,",
    "the complete mode conversion can be achieved , which makes tailoring this regime particularly important for the applications . for a positive example , let me mention a promising method for controllable dispersion compensation in photonic bandgap fibers based on weak interactions at anticrossings between the core - guided mode and a mode localized in an intentionally introduced defect of the crystal  @xcite .",
    "an opposing example of technology strains due to the undesirable intermodal interactions is radiation losses caused by the coupling of the guided mode to radiation modes in a two - dimensional photonic crystal etched into a planar waveguide  @xcite .",
    "a dominating theoretical tool for the whole of mode coupling and conversion phenomena ( except a few cases when rigorous analytical treatment is possible  @xcite ) is the coupled - mode , or the coupled - wave , formalism  @xcite that was first proposed more than fifty years ago and since then became commonplace in both optical engineering research and textbook literature .",
    "the mathematical foundation of all the modifications of the coupled - mode formalism is the method of variation of independent coefficients  one of the fruitful methods in perturbation theory  @xcite",
    ". nevertheless , the formalism grounds upon the differing amount of approximations  e.g. , that of slowly - varying dielectric function @xmath1 , so that the electric field @xmath2 is assumed to satisfy @xmath3 ; the so - called parabolic approximation ; and others  which certainly limits the usefulness of the model .",
    "moreover , the resultant `` coupled modes '' often fail to satisfy orthogonality relations and boundary conditions in the actual ( perturbed ) structure .",
    "finally , the coupled - mode formalism ignores all of the explicit mathematical parallels to the classical quantum - mechanics problems that also exploit perturbation techniques , in particular the widely known perturbation method for stationary levels  @xcite  a modification of the lindstedt - poincar method of strained parameters sometimes called the rayleigh - schrdinger method ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for the bibliographical details ) .",
    "meanwhile , establishing and tracking the analogies between classical quantum mechanics and optics tends to be a really stimulating approach  both through adopting the formalism of electromagnetic - wave propagation in dielectric materials to collisionless propagation of effective - mass electron waves in semiconductor crystals  @xcite , and on the other hand through applying the formalism of quantum - mechanical solid - state electronics to electromagnetic propagation in periodic dielectric structures which proved to be a very successful programme during the last decade  @xcite .    in this article ,",
    "i translate the classical stationary perturbation technique  i.e. , the method of strained parameters  to the case of mode coupling and conversion in optical waveguiding systems .",
    "the problem of source - free light propagation is formulated in as an ordinary eigenvalue problem in the squared free - space wavenumber @xmath4 ( or , actually , in the angular frequency @xmath5 ) for the magnetic field @xmath6 , and perturbations in dielectric index profile of the waveguide are considered , embracing the cases of optical inhomogeneity , magnetization of arbitrary orientation , and nonlinearity .",
    "both the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors are expanded into the series in perturbation parameter , giving rise to an electromagnetic counterpart of the quantum - mechanics stationary perturbation method as an alternative to the coupled - mode formalism .",
    "although physical interpretation of the former in the case of nondegenerate spectrum of eigenvalues looks rather questionable from the point of experiment , the method however provides promptly solvable and naturally interpretable treatment of the modal behavior at the anticrossings , which is an issue in the mode conversion analysis . to demonstrate the efficiency of the method ( to distinguish from the coupled - mode theory , the qualifying term `` stationary '' is retained here with the primary meaning that the coefficients of an expansion into which an input wave is decomposed",

    "the unperturbed basis for the both cases is a multilayer waveguide composed of linear isotropic dielectric materials  a simple structure known to exhibit under certain circumstances the perfect phase matching of guided te and tm modes  @xcite , thus it is natural to implement here the developed theory for the mode conversion at anticrossings . for both systems ,",
    "i pursue the formulated way to derive closed - form first - order analytic expressions for the minimum value of mode mismatch and hence for the length of complete @xmath0 mode conversion ( the coupling length , or the beat length ) .",

    "<S> the focus here is on the mode conversion at the points of virtual phase matching ( otherwise called anticrossings or avoided crossings ) associated with the maximum conversion efficiency . </S>",
    "<S> the method is shown to provide a convenient tool to deal with intermodal interactions at anticrossings  interactions induced by any kind of perturbation in dielectric index profile of the waveguide , embracing optical inhomogeneity , magnetization of arbitrary orientation , and nonlinearity . </S>",
    "<S> closed - form analytic expressions are derived for the minimum value of mode mismatch and for the length of complete mode conversion ( the coupling length , or the beat length ) in generic waveguiding systems exhibiting anticrossings . </S>",
    "<S> demonstrating the effectiveness of the method , these general expressions are further applied to the case of @xmath0 mode conversion in ( i ) a multilayer gyrotropic waveguide under piecewise - constant , arbitrarily oriented magnetization , and ( ii ) an optically - inhomogeneous planar dielectric waveguide  an example which the standard coupled - mode theory fails to describe . </S>"
