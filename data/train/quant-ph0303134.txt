    "rapid advances in experimental techniques of laser cooling and trapping made it possible to achieve bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) in weakly interacting systems .",
    "one of the many interesting aspects of bec in dilute gases is the dynamics of growth and decay of the condensate  @xcite .",
    "bose - einstein condensates can have long lifetimes ranging from @xmath0  s  @xcite up to more than @xmath1  s  @xcite .",
    "this finite lifetime is mainly caused by inelastic collisions between condensate atoms and by collisions with particles from the background gas , resulting in atom loss and heating of the system .",
    "many experiments with condensates can be performed on a time scale short compared to the condensate lifetime , such that decay effects are not important .",
    "this is , however , not always the case and some experiments specifically focus on condensate decay  @xcite .",
    "hence , it is important to model the decay of a condensate in detail , taking into account all processes which significantly contribute . in literature condensate decay due to",
    "inelastic collisions and collisions with background gas atoms as well as heating effects are discussed . to our knowledge , the transfer of atoms between the condensate and the thermal cloud occuring dynamically as a consequence of thermalization of the system has not yet been taken into account .",
    "we will show that this process plays an important role when the number of atoms in the condensate is of the same order or smaller than the number in the thermal cloud .",
    "its effect could only be neglected in experiments with large condensate fractions which are often obtained by removal of most of the thermal part with an rf - knife , or in situations in which our assumption of fast thermalization is not fulfilled .",
    "the present work concentrates on the decay of condensates in the presence of a considerably large thermal fraction .",
    "we assume thermal equilibrium during the decay of the condensate which is justified in most experiments with bec in dilute atomic gases .",
    "since elastic collision rates are typically large ( @xmath2  s@xmath3  @xcite ) , one expects thermalization to occur very rapidly  @xcite compared to the rate of change in thermodynamic variables during the decay . using the simple condensate growth equation  @xcite we investigated numerically the effect of dynamical disturbances caused by atom loss and heating from inelastic collisions on a system originally in thermal equilibrium .",
    "we found that the system stays very close to thermal equilibrium under conditions typically encountered in the experiments with dilute atomic gases .",
    "although our model incorporates two- and three - body collisions it does not take into account subsequent secondary effects . for instance , the effects of induced local variations in the mean - field interparticle interaction  @xcite are neglected . also",
    "secondary collisions of reaction products with atoms of the condensate or the thermal cloud are not accounted for .",
    "avalanches , recently discussed by schuster _",
    "@xcite , are therefore beyond the scope of this work .",
    "they may be incorporated later .",
    "this letter is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ need ] we derive a simple analytical formula for the decay of a condensate of non - interacting bosons including only losses due to collisions with background gas particles .",
    "the expressions derived in this section show the existence of transfer of atoms between condensate and thermal cloud and the significant reduction in condensate lifetime that may occur . in sec .",
    "[ model ] we present a more complete dynamical model of condensate decay using the mean - field theory for weakly - interacting bosons and including also losses by inelastic two- and three - body collisions . in sec .",
    "[ results ] we present , as an example , numerical simulations of condensate decay in metastable helium .",
    "apart from elastic collisions that keep the system in thermal equilibrium , in this section we assume the atoms to undergo only collisions with background gas particles , inducing atom losses . for simplicity",
    "we consider a system of non - interacting bosons . at a temperature @xmath4 below the critical temperature @xmath5^{1/3}/k$ ]",
    "the number of atoms @xmath6 in the thermal cloud is given by  @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the averaged frequency of the harmonic potential trapping the atoms , @xmath9 denotes the number of atoms and @xmath10 , @xmath11 .",
    "the energy @xmath12 contained in the thermal cloud is  @xcite @xmath13 with @xmath14 . to describe the equilibrium state we choose instead of the temperature @xmath4 and the total number of atoms @xmath9 as dynamical variables the number of atoms in the condensate @xmath15 and the number of atoms in the thermal cloud @xmath6 .    for the background gas particles we assume room - temperature energies and a uniform distribution over the volume occupied by the trapped atoms .",
    "as the average kinetic energy of a background gas particle is much larger than the energy of an atom in the trap , the collision cross section does not depend on the latter and each collision removes one atom from the trap .",
    "after such a collision the total energy of the system @xmath16 is depleted on average by the mean energy per atom @xmath17 . with these assumptions we obtain for the loss rate @xmath18 with @xmath19 denoting the trap lifetime .",
    "for the rate of change in the total energy @xmath16 of the system accompanying the atom loss we have @xmath20 where we used the energy contained in the condensate @xmath21 with @xmath22 being the ground state energy of the trap .",
    "using eq .",
    "( [ energythermal ] ) the time derivatives @xmath23 and @xmath24 can be substituted in eq .",
    "( [ energychange1 ] ) and in combination with eq .",
    "( [ lossrate1 ] ) we then find @xmath25 where we used @xmath26 , neglecting the energy of a condensate atom compared to the average energy per atom in the thermal cloud . substituting in eq .",
    "( [ lossrate1 ] ) yields @xmath27 this simple analysis shows that for a condensate coexisting in thermal equilibrium with a thermal cloud in a trap neither @xmath28 nor @xmath29 holds for the decay induced by collisions with background particles .",
    "conservation of energy and number of atoms combined with rapid thermalization inevitably results in transfer of atoms from condensate to thermal cloud thereby enhancing the decay rate of the condensate . especially with a considerable fraction of thermal atoms in the system",
    "this affects the decay of the condensate . only in the limit of a large condensate fraction eq",
    "( [ becdec1 ] ) becomes @xmath28 .",
    "in order to parametrize the equilibrium state of the gas , we will use the temperature @xmath4 and the number of atoms in the condensate @xmath15 as independent variables fully describing the state of the system .",
    "we will start with the stationary `` two - gas '' model proposed by dodd _",
    "@xcite , in which atoms of the thermal cloud do not affect the condensate described by the stationary gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation . the thermal cloud atoms do not interact with each other ( except for thermalization ) but they are influenced by the condensate through the mean - field potential @xmath30 . here , the contact potential @xmath31 expresses the binary interaction between atoms with scattering length @xmath32 and mass @xmath33 , and @xmath34 denotes the spatial density of the condensate which can be calculated from the gp equation .",
    "we additionally simplify the two - gas model by describing the thermal cloud semiclassically , replacing discrete states when evaluating statistical averages by a continuum of states .",
    "this way we obtain analytical formulas for the atomic density @xmath35 @xcite and energy density @xmath36 in the thermal cloud : @xmath37 - 1 } \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\lambda^{-3 } g_{3/2}\\left(e^{-\\left(v_{eff}({\\bf r})-\\mu\\right)/kt}\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath38 - 1 } \\nonumber \\\\ \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\frac{3}{2 } kt \\lambda^{-3 } g_{5/2}\\left(e^{-\\left(v_{eff}({\\bf r})-\\mu\\right)/kt}\\right ) + \\nonumber \\\\ & & v_{eff}({\\bf r})\\,\\lambda^{-3 } g_{3/2}\\left ( e^{-\\left(v_{eff}({\\bf r})-\\mu\\right)/kt}\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath39  is the thermal de broglie wavelength , @xmath40 is the chemical potential and  @xmath41",
    ". the explicit form of @xmath34 and @xmath40 follows from the gp equation .",
    "they depend on the number of atoms in the condensate @xmath15 . by integrating the densities @xmath42 and @xmath43 over spatial degrees of freedom we obtain the number of atoms in the thermal cloud @xmath44 and the energy of the thermal cloud @xmath45 .",
    "we are interested in the time dependence of @xmath15 and @xmath4 .",
    "as before , we will first consider the dynamics of the total number of trapped atoms @xmath9 and total energy @xmath16 as a function of @xmath15 and @xmath4 .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that we do not need to state transfer terms explicitly ; the transfer will follow from our analysis automatically .",
    "the total loss rates @xmath46 and @xmath47 are related to @xmath48 and @xmath49 via @xmath50 with @xmath51 .",
    "the reparametrization is straightforward as we have already found explicit expressions of almost all terms appearing in eq .",
    "( [ repa ] ) .    in order to describe the dynamics of the system we must consider all relevant processes affecting its state .",
    "we include three main dynamical effects that may cause losses of atoms from the system : two - body inelastic collisions , three - body recombinations and collisions with background gas . in the following",
    "we will neglect all secondary collisions .",
    "then the total atomic loss rate @xmath46 is given by @xcite : @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are two- and three - body collision rate constants and @xmath19 is the lifetime of the trap .",
    "each term in eq .",
    "( [ l ] ) corresponds to a loss process that may occur in the system .",
    "for example the term @xmath55 expresses the probability density of a three - body recombination between two condensate and one thermal cloud atom to take place at point @xmath56 . in this event",
    "we lose all three atoms from the system , hence the factor @xmath57 in front of the integral in eq .",
    "( [ l ] ) .",
    "the energy lost in this particular process consists of two terms .",
    "first , an energy @xmath58 carried by the two lost condensate atoms .",
    "second , the energy carried by the thermal cloud atom just before the recombination .",
    "we assume that the change in internal energy per lost thermal particle is equal to the average energy per atom @xmath59 at point @xmath60",
    ". then the energy loss rate by this process becomes @xmath61 analogously , one can derive the proper rates corresponding to the other possible collisions .",
    "finally we end up with the expression for the total energy loss rate : @xmath62 + \\nonumber \\\\ \\nonumber \\\\ & & 3 \\xi \\int \\mbox{d}^3 r\\ , \\left [ \\frac{e_t } { n_t } \\left ( \\frac{1}{2 ! } n_c^2 n_t + 2 n_c n_t^2 + n_t^3 \\right ) + \\right .",
    "\\nonumber \\\\ \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\left.\\mu \\left(\\frac{1}{3 ! } n_c^3+\\frac{2}{2 ! }   n_c^2 n_t + n_c n_t^2 \\right ) \\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in equations ( [ repa ] ) , ( [ l ] ) , and ( [ lfalka ] ) @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath6 , @xmath12 , and @xmath40 are functions of @xmath15 and @xmath4 only .",
    "in this section we present some numerical solutions of the set of equations ( [ repa ] ) , ( [ l ] ) , and ( [ lfalka ] ) .",
    "we have performed simulations of the condensate decay for the conditions of the paris experiment on metastable helium @xcite : an initial number of atoms in the condensate of @xmath63 , a trap lifetime @xmath64  s , s - wave scattering length @xmath65  nm , trap parameters @xmath66  hz and @xmath67  hz , two - body inelastic collision rate @xmath68  @xmath69 @xcite , and three - body recombination rate @xmath70  @xmath71 @xcite . the initial number in the thermal cloud is either @xmath72 ( fig .  [",
    "fig : w1 ] ) or @xmath73 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : w3 ] ) , with initial temperatures of @xmath74  @xmath40k and @xmath75  @xmath40k , respectively .",
    "this gives densities still outside the regime where avalanches occur .",
    "the numerical solution @xmath76 is shown together with results for a much simpler approach in which the transfer is absent .",
    "for the loss rates @xmath48 and @xmath77 again eq .",
    "( [ l ] ) is used , setting to zero the thermal or condensate density , respectively .",

    "further details as in the caption of fig .",
    "[ fig : w1 ] . ]    comparing both curves with the same initial conditions it follows that , when the existence of transfer is neglected , the lifetime of the trap is overestimated by @xmath82 when the initial fraction of atoms in the thermal cloud is 0.5 and by more than a factor of 2 when this fraction is 0.8 .",
    "the third ( dotted ) line in each figure shows the decay in the absence of a thermal cloud .",
    "the lifetime increases by a factor of 2.5 in fig .",
    "[ fig : w1 ] and a factor of 8 in fig .",
    "[ fig : w3 ] , due to the absence of inelastic collisions between condensate and thermal cloud atoms . in both models",
    "the decay rate is larger with a thermal cloud , but in the full model the effect is enhanced by atomic transfer .",
    "another feature of condensate decay that can be studied on the basis of our model is the time dependence of the temperature during the decay .",
    "usually it is assumed that the temperature is constant @xcite . in both figures",
    "an inset shows the numerical solution for @xmath83 .",
    "indeed , the temperature remains constant within @xmath84 .",
    "we have presented an equilibrium model of the decay of a bose - einstein condensate .",
    "our analysis has shown that the assumption of sustained thermal equilibrium leads to transfer of atoms from the condensate to the thermal cloud which can significantly enhance the condensate decay rate .",
