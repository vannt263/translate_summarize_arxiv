    "in the analysis of data on decays of the @xmath1-meson family @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4  the contribution of multi - channel @xmath7 scattering in the final - state interactions is considered .",
    "the analysis , which aims at studying the scalar mesons , is performed jointly considering the isoscalar s - wave processes @xmath0 , which are described in our model - independent approach based on analyticity and unitarity and using an uniformization procedure , and the charmonium decay processes @xmath5 , @xmath6 .",
    "importance of studying properties of scalar mesons is related to the obvious fact that a comprehension of these states is necessary in principle for the most profound topics concerning the qcd vacuum , because these sectors affect each other especially strongly due to possible `` direct '' transitions between them .",
    "however the problem of interpretation of the scalar mesons is faraway to be solved completely @xcite .",
    "e.g. , applying our model - independent method in the 3-channel analyses of processes @xmath11 @xcite we have obtained parameters of the @xmath9 and @xmath12 which differ considerably from results of analyses which utilize other methods ( mainly those based on dispersion relations and breit  wigner approaches ) .    to make our approach more convincing , to confirm obtained results and to diminish inherent arbitrariness ,",
    "we have utilized the derived model - independent amplitudes for multi - channel @xmath7 scattering calculating the contribution of final - state interactions in decays @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath2 @xcite .    here",
    "we add to the analysis the data on decays @xmath3 and @xmath4 from cleo(94 ) collaboration .",
    "a distinction of the @xmath13 decays from the above ones consists in the fact that in this case a phase space cuts off , as if , possible contributions which might interfere destructively with the @xmath7-scattering contribution giving a characteristic 2-humped shape of the energy dependence of di - pion spectrum in decay @xmath3 .    after establishing the 2-humped shape of di - pion spectrum lipkin and tuan @xcite",
    "have suggested that the decay @xmath3 proceeds as follows : @xmath14 .",
    "+ then in the heavy - quarkonium limit , when neglecting recoil of the final - quarkonium state , they obtained that the amplitude contains a term proportional to @xmath15 ( @xmath16 is the angle between the pion three - momenta @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) multiplied by some function of the kinematic invariants .",
    "if the latter were a constant , then the distribution @xmath19 ( and @xmath20 ) would have the 2-humped shape .",
    "however , this scenario was not tested numerically by fitting to data .",
    "it is possible that this effect is negligible due to the small coupling of the @xmath1 to the b - flavored sector .    in his work @xcite",
    ", moxhay has suggested that the 2-humped shape is a result of interference between two parts of the decay amplitude .",
    "one part , in which the @xmath7 final state interaction is allowed for , is related to a mechanism which acts well in the decays @xmath6 and @xmath2 and which , obviously , should operate also in the process @xmath3 .",
    "the other part is responsible for the lipkin ",
    "tuan mechanism .",
    "though there remains nothing from the latter because the author says that the term containing @xmath21 does not dominate this part of amplitude and `` the other tensor structures conspire to give a distribution in @xmath22 that is more or less flat ''  indeed , constant .",
    "it seems , the approach of work @xcite resembles the above one .",
    "the authors have supposed simply that a pion pair is formed in the @xmath13 decay both as a result of re - scattering and  directly \" .",
    "one can , however , believe that the latter is not reasonable because the pions interact strongly , inevitably .",
    "we show that the indicated effect of destructive interference can be achieved taking into account our previous conclusions on the wide resonances @xcite , without the doubtful assumptions .",
    "considering the multi - channel @xmath7 scattering , we shall deal with the 3-channel case ( namely with @xmath0 ) because it was shown @xcite that this is a minimal number of coupled channels needed for obtaining correct values of scalar - isoscalar resonance parameters .",
    "*     the 3-channel @xmath23-matrix is determined on the 8-sheeted riemann surface .",
    "the matrix elements @xmath24 , where @xmath25 denote channels , have the right - hand cuts along the real axis of the @xmath26 complex plane ( @xmath26 is the invariant total energy squared ) , starting with the channel thresholds @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) , and the left - hand cuts related to the crossed channels .",
    "the riemann - surface sheets are numbered according to the signs of analytic continuations of the square roots @xmath29 as follows : +    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "for decays @xmath31 we have taken data from mark iii @xcite , dm2 @xcite and bes ii @xcite collaborations ; for @xmath32 from mark  ii @xcite ; for @xmath33 from crystal ball(80 ) @xcite ; for @xmath34 from argus @xcite , cleo @xcite , cusb @xcite , and crystal ball(85 ) @xcite collaborations ; finally for @xmath35 and @xmath36 from cleo(94 ) collaboration @xcite .    formalism for calculating di - meson mass distributions of decays @xmath5 and @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) can be found in ref .",
