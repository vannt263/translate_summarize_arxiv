    "<S> are typically less than 20% , in qualitative agreement with theoretical expectations . </S>",
    "<S> however , recent measurements by the hermes collaboration of the inelastic lepton - nucleus cross section at low @xmath5 gev@xmath6 and small @xmath7 for a @xmath8 gev positron beam interacting on gas jet targets at hera display an extraordinarily strong nuclear and virtual photon polarization dependence @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the hermes data for deuterium , @xmath9he and @xmath10n targets show an anomalously strong nuclear dependence of the ratio @xmath11 at low momentum transfer @xmath2 and small @xmath12 for example , @xmath13 ( nitrogen vs. deuterium ) is @xmath14 at @xmath15 gev@xmath6 , for @xmath16 this ratio of five results from a nuclear enhancement of the longitudinally polarized virtual photoabsorption by about a factor of 2 and a reduction of the transverse cross section @xmath17 by about a factor of 2.5 . </S>",
    "<S> these nuclear effects are very much larger than the typical shadowing effects mentioned above , and very much larger than previous estimates @xcite of nuclear enhancements of @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> the nuclear target experiments in this kinematic regime are very challenging because of the large size of the radiative corrections .    </S>",
    "<S> it has long been recognized that a small value of @xmath19 is the signature of spin 1/2 partons , and , conversely , a large value would be a signature of bosonic constituents @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the rapid decrease of the nuclear enhancement of @xmath20 with increasing @xmath2 seen by hermes is compatible with elastic scattering of the positron on a composite bosonic system : the power - law decrease of the square of the mesonic form factors @xmath21 could account for the rapid fall - off of the @xmath22 enhancement with momentum transfer . </S>",
    "<S> it is thus natural to interpret the unusual nuclear enhancement of @xmath18 reported by hermes in terms of leptons scattering on the mesonic fields of nuclei .    </S>",
    "<S> the fundamental microscopic description of the deep inelastic electroproduction cross section on nuclei in qcd is based on quark and gluon degrees of freedom , but at small @xmath2 there exist intricate and non - local correlations which are more readily described in terms of mesonic currents . </S>",
    "<S> a familiar example is the emergence of pions as approximate goldstone bosons , which is difficult to see directly in the quark language , but is immediate in the language of effective lagrangians . </S>",
    "<S> thus meson fields are natural degrees of freedom for the physics of leptoproduction at low values of @xmath2 and @xmath4 .    </S>",
    "<S> the nuclear enhancement of @xmath23 for @xmath7 observed by hermes suggests constructive interference of amplitudes from mesons emitted by different nucleons . </S>",
    "<S> the minimum laboratory momentum transfer to the nucleus in diffractive production of a meson of mass @xmath24 is @xmath25 mev , which is comparable with the inverse nuclear size of nitrogen . </S>",
    "<S> thus electroproduction can occur from higher - twist subprocesses in which the lepton scatters elastically on mesons emitted coherently throughout the entire nuclear volume .    </S>",
    "<S> now let us consider the specific processes which could contribute . </S>",
    "<S> the most natural effect to consider is positron quasi - elastic scattering from a nuclear pion . </S>",
    "<S> the emission of a pion leads to a set of low - lying nuclear states , and one could find significant effects in the sum over states . </S>",
    "<S> however , the probability of finding a pion at small values of @xmath4 in the nuclear medium vanishes relative to vector mesons , reflecting the connection between the regge behavior of deep inelastic structure functions and the spin of the exchanged constituents @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , even though the pion couples strongly to nucleons , we do not expect the pion to contribute significantly to the hermes effect at small @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> however , as we discuss below , pionic currents can yield significant effects for @xmath26 and @xmath27 gev@xmath6 .    </S>",
    "<S> other nuclear mesons besides pions are known to play an important in nuclear physics . in simple models </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the exchange of scalar mesons between nucleons leads to attractive forces which bind the nucleus . on the other hand , the exchange of vector mesons supplies the repulsive potential which prevents the collapse of the nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> the strengths of such fields in the nucleus are quite large @xcite , corresponding to a significant number of effective bosonic partons at very small values of @xmath4 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , in high energy processes , the effects of vector mesons are enhanced because of the presence of factors of momentum in the interaction . </S>",
    "<S> this is an essential feature of the explanation provided here .    </S>",
    "<S> nuclear deep inelastic lepton - scattering and drell - yan experiments place important constraints which limit the nuclear enhancements of mesons relative to the nucleon ; see the summary @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for example , for infinite nuclear matter the nucleons must carry 90% of the light cone plus momentum @xcite , which implies mesons can carry no more than 10% . </S>",
    "<S> our calculations shall use models and parameters which respect these constraints .    </S>",
    "<S> we begin a quantitative analysis by examining the consequences of nuclear - coherent vector and scalar mesons . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the process of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1a in which the interaction between the virtual photon @xmath28 of momentum @xmath29 with a nuclear @xmath30 meson which produces a @xmath31 meson in the final state can give a significant contribution to @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> to understand the shadowing of @xmath33 , we need a process which interferes destructively with the dominant process ( at low @xmath4 ) of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1b . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the process of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1c in which the virtual photon converts a nuclear @xmath31 meson into a vector meson can supply the necessary destructive interference . if this amplitude is 1/3 of the dominant process it leads to a reduction of the cross section of a factor of 4/9 , which is needed to account for the shadowing observed at low @xmath4 . in order to evaluate these diagrams , we will adopt a procedure of postulating photon - meson interactions , consistent with gauge invariance , and then verifying that there is no conflict with available information .    </S>",
    "<S> consider the longitudinal cross section . </S>",
    "<S> we denote the contribution ( per nucleon ) to the nuclear hadronic tensor caused by excess nuclear mesons as @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> this is in addition to the gluonic effects which give a non - zero value for @xmath19 for a free nucleon . </S>",
    "<S> then , using standard kinematic relations @xcite , we take the ratio of nuclear to nucleon values of the longitudinal cross section to find = 1+q^4 ( ^2+q^2 ) w^00f_2^d r_d ( 1+r_d).[kinrel]the notation @xmath35 represents the nucleonic value as represented by the deuteron cross section , with @xmath36 and @xmath37 taken from standard parameterizations of the data@xcite . the implication of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ kinrel ] ) is that @xmath38 must vary as @xmath39 to obtain a significant effect at small @xmath4 .    in order to evaluate the effects of fig .  1a </S>",
    "<S> , we need to determine the @xmath40 interaction . </S>",

    "<S> the branching ratio for @xmath47 @xcite , which we assume to come from the process @xmath48 followed by the two pion decay of the @xmath31 meson </S>",

    "<S> the predicted value of @xmath53 and the extracted value of @xmath45 depend strongly on the mass of the @xmath31 meson , which is given @xcite as the @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> if we use the average value of 800 mev , the decay would not occur , and the width of the @xmath30 would provide no constraint on the value of @xmath45 . in these first calculations we choose @xmath55 mev , and determine an upper limit for g : @xmath56 we shall take @xmath57 as a nominal value .    the standard formula for a contribution to the hadronic tensor per nucleon is w^=14m_a1a d^4 e^iqp|j^()j^(0)|p . </S>",

    "<S> * will be huge on a scale of nuclear momenta @xmath70 , and the nuclear form factor nearly vanishes unless @xmath71 is parallel to the direction of the virtual photon . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , the angular integration gives a factor @xmath72 , which , when multiplied by a large factor @xmath73 arising from the product of two volume integrals over the entire size of the nucleus , leads to @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> this term increases roughly as a@xmath75 , representing the net coherent effect of the nuclear @xmath30 field , and it has the necessary dependence on @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> * * *    the essential input is @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> for the @xmath10n target , we use a fermi form : @xmath77.$ ] the resulting @xmath78 is computed numerically using eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ good],[ftdef ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the term @xmath79 is the central value of the field . in mean field theory , @xmath79 is the vector potential for the nucleon divided by the @xmath30-nucleon coupling constant . </S>",
    "<S> the value is @xmath80 mev in nuclear matter ( along with the nucleon effective mass , @xmath81 ) using qhd1 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the very small nucleon effective mass causes the value of light cone plus momentum carried by nucleons to be far too small for consistency with lepton - nuclear deep inelastic scattering data . however , there are many versions of the theory </S>",
    "<S> . one could include meson - meson interactions in the lagrangian , as well as rpa and brueckner correlations . </S>",
    "<S> for example , in a mean field theory which includes @xmath82 and @xmath83 terms , the value @xmath84 mev ( @xmath85 ) gives a reasonable description of many nuclear properties @xcite , and is also consistent with nuclear deep inelastic scattering @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the quark - meson coupling model @xcite also gives @xmath86 . </S>",
    "<S> thus the expected range of @xmath79 is @xmath87 mev . in our present calculations </S>",
    "<S> we adopt the average value of @xmath88 mev as a nominal value .    in order to complete the description of our calculation we need to specify the form factor . </S>",
    "<S> the expression : @xmath89 is an analytic representation of the quark - loop diagram calculation of ito and gross @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the results obtained with this form factor ( labeled ig ) are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2 , using @xmath90 fm , a value which is consistent with available information . to display the sensitivity to parameters </S>",
    "<S> , we also use a dipole form factor ( results labeled dipole in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2 ) , along with the values @xmath91 . in either case , the values of @xmath32 are large , and a qualitative reproduction of the hermes data is obtained . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , the values of the couplings could be much smaller ; for example if @xmath92 , then the computed ratio of @xmath93 would be @xmath94 for @xmath95 .    </S>",
    "<S> 1.cm    ( 15,9)(-3,-10 )    we now return to the effects of the pion . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath96 interaction is represented by the current : @xmath97 its use in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ kinrel ] ) gives the pionic contribution as : & = & q^42 ^ 31+r_df_2^d r_d f_/a(x)f_^2(q^2 ) = x f_/a(x)1+r_df_2^d r_df_^2(q^2).[second]the effects of the pion form factor are included via the term @xmath98 . </S>",
    "<S> the pion distribution function @xmath99 gives the probability that a nuclear pion has a plus momentum of @xmath100 . </S>",
    "<S> as noted above , @xmath99 vanishes as @xmath4 approaches zero . </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath101 for the data point at @xmath102 is estimated using @xcite @xmath103 , @xmath104 , and @xmath105 from the calculation of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for infinite nuclear matter . </S>",
    "<S> this calculation uses a version of the ericson - thomas @xcite model in which the parameters are chosen to be consistent with nuclear deep inelastic and drell - yan data . </S>",
    "<S> the result is @xmath106 which is negligible . </S>",
    "<S> the function @xmath99 peaks at @xmath107 with a value ( for the charged pions ) of 0.24 . for this @xmath4 , @xmath108 . </S>",
    "<S> these values give @xmath109 for the kinematics in the hermes experiment , @xmath110 gev@xmath6 and the square of the form factor is @xmath111 . </S>",
    "<S> thus one obtains a contribution of about 0.03 . </S>",
    "<S> this is small compared to the vector meson current contributions , but it is not entirely negligible . </S>",
    "<S> however , in an experiment at @xmath107 with @xmath112 , nuclear - coherent pions would contribute significantly to @xmath20 .    </S>",
    "<S> the presence of nuclear pions opens the door to a variety of new experiments . </S>",
    "<S> one could study the exclusive final state of pionic reactions such as @xmath113 , @xmath114 , and @xmath115 , where the final state nuclides can be formed in their ground or excited states . </S>",
    "<S> these nuclear - diffractive electroproduction processes can be used to test predictions from qcd for the @xmath3 and @xmath116 dependence of the off - shell mesonic form factors @xmath117 . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , by tagging the nuclear final state in an inelastic reaction , one could identify the structure functions of off - shell mesons , as in the sullivan process . </S>",
    "<S> such processes are analogous to the measurements of the pomeron structure function in diffractive deep inelastic scattering .    </S>",
    "<S> next we examine the nuclear value of the transverse cross section @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> our explanation of the data requires a significant destructive interference effect at low @xmath118 , which decreases rapidly as @xmath2 increases . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the shadowing of the real photon ( @xmath119 ) is not very strong , and it is well explained by conventional vector meson dominance models @xcite . thus consistency with all available data demands an amplitude for @xmath120 which vanishes , or is small , as the @xmath2 of the virtual photon @xmath28 approaches 0 . </S>",
    "<S> this means that measuring the real photon decays of the vector mesons provides no constraints on the coupling constant . </S>",
    "<S> we postulate a sum of two gauge - invariant forms : _ & = & g_2 m _ [ vo1 ] + & & -g _ m_. the choice @xmath121 leads to an effective lagrangian @xmath122 which is the form that we adopt . </S>",
    "<S> we choose a gauge such that @xmath123 note also that the difference in the two terms of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ vo1 ] ) is due to the source of the electromagnetic field , so that @xmath124 depends on the virtuality of the photon . </S>",
    "<S> a form factor @xmath125 is introduced . </S>",
    "<S> we simplify the calculation by considering only one intermediate vector meson state , which we label @xmath126 . </S>",
    "<S> we shall treat its mass denoted @xmath127 , which can range from the mass of the physical @xmath126 meson up to values comparable with @xmath128 20 gev here , as a free parameter . </S>",
    "<S> then the usually dominant term @xmath129 of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1b takes the form : _ dom = em_^2f_-1q^2+m_^2 ^^d^4xt_a(x)e^i(p - q)x , [ dom ] in which @xmath65 is the momentum of the final vector meson , and @xmath130 represents the purely imaginary final - state interaction with the target nucleus which converts the intermediate vector meson to the final vector meson .    the nuclear - coherent term of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1c takes the form _ </S>",
    "<S> = q^2 f_v(q^2)^^ d^4xd^4xe^ipxt_a(x ) e^-il(x-x)l^2-m_^2+i e^-iqx(x).the evaluation is straightforward . </S>",
    "<S> the integration over @xmath131 gives a delta function setting @xmath132 equal to @xmath133 . </S>",
    "<S> the propagator contains a factor @xmath134 in which the direction of the photon momentum is taken as the positive @xmath135 axis . </S>",
    "<S> the approximation of neglecting @xmath136 yields a propagator of the eikonal form , so that after integration _ = -iq^2f_v(q^2)2 ^^d^4xe^i(p - q)xt_a(x ) _ -^z dz e^-iq^2+m_^22(z-z)(*x_*,z ) [ stf]the overall factor of @xmath137 arises from the eikonal propagator , and another phase appears in the exponential . </S>",
    "<S> this phase factor vanishes for extremely large values of @xmath76 , but it is important here because the large nuclear radius enters ( @xmath138 ) . thus @xmath139 can interfere with @xmath140 . note that for large enough values of @xmath76 , @xmath141 this gives a rough guide to the dependence on @xmath3 and @xmath142 . </S>",
    "<S> thus there is a very strong dependence on the specific value of @xmath143 used . </S>",
    "<S> we choose this parameter to be 5 times the square of the mass of the physical @xmath126 meson . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude @xmath139 is proportional to the central value of the nuclear @xmath31 field @xmath144 which takes on a value of @xmath145 mev in qhd1 . </S>",
    "<S> if the non - linear model @xcite is used , @xmath146 mev . in our present calculations </S>",
    "<S> we choose the average value @xmath147 mev . </S>",
    "<S> the results shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3 are obtained by numerical integration and assuming that the time dependence of @xmath148 is the same for all positions within the nucleus . </S>",

    "<S> we use choose @xmath152 to be the physical mass of the @xmath153 meson . </S>",
    "<S> this defines the value of @xmath154 , and is simply a convention for defining the value of @xmath155 . </S>",
    "<S> an exponential , rather than power - law fall - off , is essential in reproducing the data . </S>",
    "<S> this form factor implies a strong @xmath2 dependence at fixed values of @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the parameter @xmath156 takes on the value of a typical hadronic size .    </S>",
    "<S> how large should @xmath155 be ? </S>",
    "<S> we can compare the strength of the @xmath157 transition with that of @xmath158 at @xmath159 : @xmath160 . </S>",
    "<S> the factor @xmath31 is expected from the @xmath31 model to be of the order of @xmath161 mev . </S>",
    "<S> thus the couplings are comparable if @xmath162 . </S>",
    "<S> this is about ten times smaller than the coupling needed to describe the strong shadowing observed by hermes . </S>",

    "<S> , one should perform a three - body calculation . </S>",
    "<S> we do not attempt this here . to understand if our theory has a reasonable dependence on @xmath142 , we simply rescale the radius parameter @xmath19 by a factor @xmath165 and take the number of nucleons to be 3 . the result , as shown in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> 1.cm    ( 15,9)(-3,-10 )    our analysis shows that it is possible , with reasonable coupling strengths , to reproduce the salient features of the hermes data . </S>",
    "<S> the calculations employ a particular choice of couplings , optimized to reproduce the hermes , without contradicting other experimental constraints . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the strengths of the meson fields in nuclear medium which we use are at least roughly consistent with measured nuclear binding energies , nuclear densities , and nuclear deep inelastic and drell - yan data . however , the constants @xmath166 have never been measured , and their magnitudes could turn out to be small . the increase in the longitudinal cross section is readily explained by the exclusive process @xmath167 via @xmath30 exchange . </S>",
    "<S> the nuclear enhancement follows from the coherence of the @xmath30 field . </S>",
    "<S> the strong shadowing of @xmath33 at small @xmath2 requires a special choice of the effective lagrangian which is theoretically and empirically allowed , but does not seem to follow from any general principle . </S>",
    "<S> thus , more conservatively , we can not rule out the hermes data using our theory .    further tests of our model are possible </S>",
    "<S> . an immediate consequence would be the observation of exclusive mesonic states in the current fragmentation region . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , our description of @xmath32 implies significant nuclear - coherent production of @xmath31 mesons along the virtual photon direction . our model for the strong shadowing of coherent meson effects in @xmath168 can be tested by measurements performed at the same value of @xmath4 but different values of @xmath2 than hermes used .    </S>",
    "<S> the prospect that the mesonic fields which are responsible for nuclear binding can be directly confirmed as effective fundamental constituents of nuclei at small @xmath4 and @xmath112 is an exciting development at the interface of traditional nuclear physics and qcd . </S>",
    "<S> the empirical confirmation of nuclear - coherent meson contributions in the final state would allow the identification of a specific dynamical mechanism for higher - twist processes in electroproduction . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , these concepts should be explored further , both experimentally and theoretically . </S>"
