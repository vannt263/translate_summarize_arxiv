    "the magnetization observed is greatly enhanced as a result of substitution of a small amount of co.    the dependence of magnetization on the applied field strength can be fitted by @xmath42 , indicating the existence of a weak ferromagnetic component @xmath43 .",

    "figure  [ noro](b ) shows @xmath44 along [ 1  1  0 ] .",
    "the pure ba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2cl@xmath0 trace indicates that a ferromagnetic component is developed at @xmath39k and quickly saturates .",
    "co substitution evidently has two effects : firstly , the transition temperature for the appearance of the cu@xmath3 structure rises .",
    "secondly , the ferromagnetic moment never saturates but continues to rise steadily down to low temperatures .",
    "a 2% substitution triples the ferromagnetic moment with an increase up to 4% giving a six - fold enhancement ! in sr@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2cl@xmath0",
    "it was shown that the ferromagnetic moment tracked the behavior of the order parameter for the cu@xmath3 sites  @xcite . here",
    "the order parameter behavior is shown in fig .",
    "[ tdependence](a ) . evidently the ferromagnetic contribution departs from this .",
    "the ferromagnetic contribution to the magnetic structure of pure ba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2cl@xmath0 is attributed to a canting of the magnetic moments .",
    "this canting of the moments is augmented , both by co substitution and then by decreasing temperature .",
    "figure  [ noro](c ) shows the magnetic susceptibility as a function of temperature and co substitution along the [ 1  1  0 ] direction .",
    "the overall shape changes little .",
    "the magnitude of the susceptibility is observed to increase with co substitution and this is the first indication of the presence of the co moments on the cu@xmath5 sites . on top of this",
    "the susceptibility climbs strongly at the lowest temperatures with increasing co substitution .",
    "we have made a study of the magnetic properties of ba@xmath0cu@xmath16co@xmath17o@xmath2cl@xmath0 using neutron scattering and magnetization measurements .",
    "for the pure material the behavior for @xmath45 is marked by a single phase transition .",
    "here we observe evidence of a new transition for @xmath30  k and a transition very similar to that of the pure material at around @xmath31 .",
    "the co substituted material also exhibits a much larger ferromagnetic moment than the pure material .",
    "the cu@xmath3 spins with co substitution order in the same way as they do in the pure material , albeit with an increased average moment .",
    "unlike in the pure material case there is now an uncompensated moment component that is experienced by the cu@xmath5 sites .",
    "there are two useful ways to think about the effect on the cu@xmath5 sites .",
    "firstly , the co substitution can be thought of as creating new , effective , interactions between the cu@xmath5 spins .",
    "secondly , the co substitution can be thought of as longitudinal fluctuations which interact with the thermal and quantum fluctuations of the cu@xmath5 spins .",
    "effective interactions between cu@xmath5 spins give rise to the new behavior we observe in ba@xmath0cu@xmath16co@xmath17o@xmath2cl@xmath0 .",
    "figure  [ coupling](a ) shows the cancellation of the cu@xmath3 contributions at the cu@xmath5 sites . a co moment on the central site in this figure",
    "would strengthen the coupling between cu@xmath5 moments but would not create anything new .",
    "the effective interactions arise from the co moments on the cu@xmath3 sites pictured in fig .",
    "[ coupling](b ) .",
    "the existence of the uncompensated moment introduces an effective ferromagnetic interaction j@xmath0 between cu@xmath5 moments .",
    "as pointed out by villain , ferromagnetic interactions at random locations in an antiferromagnetic material would give rise to spin - glass behavior in an ising system  @xcite .",
    "in the case of xy or heisenberg symmetry the frustration between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions can be resolved by canting of the cu@xmath5 moments close to the co site .",
    "this situation is pictured in fig .",
    "[ coupling](c ) and exhibits simultaneous ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic order .",
    "villain considered a similar case with interstitial magnetic impurities : a _ decorated _ model  @xcite . in that case antiferromagnetic coupling between the host and interstitial were chosen .",
    "for ba@xmath0cu@xmath16co@xmath17o@xmath2cl@xmath0 the local canted states have a non - zero moment as is evident in our magnetization results . in villains model the local canting compensates the impurity moment and a quadrupolar field results  @xcite .",
    "the substituted co moments on the cu@xmath3 sites are longitudinal fluctuations in the field experienced by the cu@xmath5 moments .",
    "there is a coupling between cu@xmath3 fluctuations and the fluctuations of the cu@xmath5 moments . in the pure material",
    "the coupling gives rise to collinear ordering  @xcite .",
    "this is because the fluctuations are predominantly transverse to the moment direction for both cu@xmath3 and cu@xmath5 spins . here",
    "the co substituted cu@xmath3 spins have large static longitudinal fluctuations .",
    "in order for the cu@xmath5 thermal and quantum fluctuations to couple to the longitudinal fluctuations it is necessary for the cu@xmath5 spins to align perpendicular to the cu@xmath3 spins .",
    "this model was studied by henley  @xcite .",
    "canting similar to fig .",
    "[ coupling](c ) is the prediction of considerations of the effective interaction and the fluctuations .",
    "evidently longitudinal fluctuations also exist due to the co substitution on the cu@xmath5 sublattice .",
    "these are at random fixed locations and are dilute .",
    "these fluctuations will couple to the thermal and quantum fluctuations of the cu@xmath3 moments and hence these co moments will also favor perpendicular alignment .",
    "our elastic neutron diffraction results indicate that the cu@xmath3 and cu@xmath5 sublattices of ba@xmath0cu@xmath16co@xmath17o@xmath2cl@xmath0 order in a very similar manner to the pure material ( fig .",
    "[ tdependence ] ) .",
    "we assume that the low temperature ordering of the cu@xmath5 spins is collinear to the ordering of the cu@xmath3 spins as in the pure material .",
    "this assumption is supported by the observation that substitution with co has hardly changed the ordering temperature and critical properties .",
    "if there were competition between collinear and perpendicular ordering , due to the co substitution , it might have been expected that the low temperature transition would have moved away from ising critical properties .",
    "the quasi - elastic measurements ( fig .",
    "[ tdependence](b ) ) revealed diffuse scattering at intermediate temperatures which is associated with very short - range correlations .",
    "this scattering is not the same as that observed in the pure material  @xcite .",
    "here the correlations are due to the local ordering close to the co moments on both sublattices .",
    "the co moments on the cu@xmath3 sites create a preferred orientation for the antiferromagnetic fluctuations which is perpendicular to the co moment .",
    "the local canted states give rise to the short - range order .",
    "it appears likely that the drop in quasi - elastic intensity is associated with a freezing of the perpendicular spin components while the collinear component retains the pure material behavior .",
    "it is the interactions between canted regions that lead to spin - glass freezing .",
    "other magnetic effects also occur in the same temperature range where we observe changes in the diffuse scattering .",
    "the development of antiferromagnetic cu@xmath3 domains in the vicinity of 100  k has been studied in detail by parks and coworkers  @xcite .",
    "this is a rare magnetization study of antiferromagnetic domains and was possible because of the ferromagnetic moment developed on the cu@xmath5 sites due to the pseudo - dipolar interaction .",
    "two kinds of cu@xmath3 domains are possible and the orientation of the associated ferromagnetic moments are mutually orthogonal and so the domain populations can be studied via the magnetization signal .",
    "the application of a high magnetic field leads to a single domain dominating the sample . as the field",
    "is reduced domains of the other type begin to nucleate . at 100",
    "k the susceptibility for domain wall formation is maximum .",
    "additional studies were made using neutron scattering showing the decrease in intensity of the ( 3  2  1 ) reflection at around 100  k. we do not believe that the decrease in scattering intensity at the ( @xmath26  @xmath26  @xmath27 ) position at around 100  k is associated with the proliferation of domain walls in the cu@xmath3 spin system .",
    "this is true in principle because we did not use an applied magnetic field to create a monodomain sample .",
    "it is also true in practice as can be observed from our measurements : at this temperature the cu@xmath5 antiferromagnetic fluctuations at ( @xmath26  @xmath26  @xmath27 ) are very short ranged ; there is no peak in reciprocal space .",
    "by contrast , the cu@xmath3 antiferromagnetic structure has long - range order .",
    "evidently there is no correspondence between the size of the cu@xmath3 and cu@xmath5 antiferromagnetic domains at these temperatures .",
    "figure  [ noro](a ) shows that the three regimes we have observed via neutron scattering are also observed in the magnetization studies presented here .",
    "the first regime is the high temperature cu@xmath3 ordering",
    ". then the spin - glass freezing transition emerges at intermediate temperatures on diluting with co. importantly , the behavior in the middle regime is seen to be new : the divergence between field - cooled and zero field - cooled magnetization measurements for the @xmath46 measurements has no parallel in the pure material ( fig .",
    "[ noro](a ) ) . at low temperatures",
    "the ordering of the cu@xmath5 sublattice persists ( presumably for those moments not pinned by a co moment ) .",
    "figure  [ noro](b ) shows that in a magnetic field applied along the [ 1  1  0 ] direction the ferromagnetic moment m@xmath47 is substantially larger than that in the pure material and has different temperature dependence . in the pure material m@xmath47 tracks the cu@xmath3 order parameter and",
    "is induced by pseudo - dipolar coupling between sublattices . in the co substituted system",
    "the applied field aligns the co moments on the cu@xmath3 sites and the canted contributions on the cu@xmath5 sites as pictured in fig .",
    "[ coupling](c ) .",
    "some canting of the cu@xmath3 moments will also occur  @xcite .",
    "the combination leads to a large ferromagnetic contribution . figure  [ noro](c )",
    "shows that these local large moments also give an increase in the susceptibility .",
    "magnetization measurements have been made for ba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2cl@xmath0 with the cu diluted with zn , ni and co. in the case of zn and ni no new transitions appear  @xcite whereas with co spin - glass behavior results .",
    "these differences stem from the magnitude of the effective interactions induced .",
    "the magnetic interaction between the spin of a cu@xmath48 ion on a cu@xmath3 site and the cu@xmath5 spins is canceled by the other spins on the cu@xmath49 sublattice . ni@xmath48",
    "and zn@xmath48 have moments that differ from cu@xmath48 by @xmath26 .",
    "hence zn and ni on cu@xmath3 sites result in an uncompensated spin one - half moment which is apparent to the cu@xmath5 moments .",
    "co@xmath48 has a moment that differs from cu@xmath48 by 1 hence for co the effect is doubled . since j@xmath5 and j@xmath50 are equal and opposite only co is likely to give rise to new and dominant interactions between the cu@xmath5 spins .",
    "our neutron scattering and magnetization results are consistent with the co substitution leading to a new transition in the cu@xmath5 spin system .",
    "spin - glass freezing at @xmath51 100  k precedes the antiferromagnetic ordering at @xmath51 30  k. we interpret our observations in - terms of the involvement of both the parallel and perpendicular spin components on the cu@xmath5 sites ( fig .",
    "[ coupling](c ) ) .",
    "the change in behavior is due to the influence of the co moments located on the cu@xmath3 sites ; this can be explained in terms of new effective interactions or alternatively coupling between fluctuations . either way the cu@xmath5 moments",
    "are caused to form local canted states around the co moments .",
    "the local canted states frustrate each other and lead to spin - glass freezing .",
    "the local cluster has a substantial moment and this is reflected in the magnetization measurements . at lower temperatures the portion of the cu@xmath5 moment that is collinear with the cu@xmath3 ordering direction ( and not pinned by a co moment ) orders antiferromagnetically as in the pure material .",
    "this system exhibits a delicate balance of quenched random and quantum fluctuations .",
