    "<S> systematic analysis of the determination of the value of leptonic cp - violating angle @xmath0 and the neutrino mass hierarchy @xmath1 by long baseline neutrino oscillation experiments is presented . </S>",
    "<S> we note the difficulty to distinguish a pair of oscillation probability spectra that are peaked at the same energy and have the same probability at that energy . </S>",
    "<S> we thereby set forth the peak - matching condition as a criterion of the presence of degeneracy , and visualize it by intersections of the trajectories drawn by a peak of an oscillation spectrum while the value of @xmath0 is varied from @xmath2 to @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we numerically calculate the pairs of the trajectories for both hierarchies and show that the pair becomes disjoint as the baseline gets longer than a critical length , indicating the matter effect resolving the degeneracy on the hierarchy . </S>",
    "<S> we formulate the trajectories into analytic expressions and evaluate the critical length . </S>",
    "<S> we provide prospects of the following four approaches of resolving the hierarchy : making the baseline longer than the critical length , using both neutrinos and anti - neutrinos , combining experiments with different baseline lengths , and observing two or more oscillation peaks . </S>"
