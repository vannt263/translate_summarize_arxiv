    "self - consistent mean - field models based on relativistic energy density functionals ( edfs ) with density - dependent strength parameters @xcite , have been successfully applied to studies of a broad variety of nuclear phenomena such as radii , masses , collective modes , fission and shape coexistence ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "remarkable results have been obtained both in the relativistic mean - field ( rmf ) framework @xcite , and more recently using the relativistic hartree - fock ( rhf ) scheme @xcite , even though rhf applications have mostly been restricted to spherical nuclei .",
    "one of the basic advantages of using functionals with manifest covariance is the natural inclusion of the nucleon spin degree of freedom , and the resulting nuclear spin - orbit potential which emerges automatically with the empirical strength in a covariant formulation @xcite .",
    "non - relativistic edfs such as , for instance , skyrme @xcite or the gogny @xcite functionals must , of course , also include a spin - orbit term . in this case",
    ", however , the strength of the phenomenological spin - orbit term has to be adjusted to data on the energy spacing between spin - orbit partner states .",
    "this approach has been extensively applied and refined over the last four decades @xcite , and it provides an effective description of spin - orbit effects in nuclei .",
    "the omission of an explicit treatment of exchange terms in the rmf approach may have an impact on the description of the isovector channel , in particular for the energy gap between spin - orbit partner states when the ratio between neutrons and protons becomes very large .",
    "the modification of spin - orbit splittings predicted by rmf - based models differs from that obtained with non - relativistic , e.g. skyrme models @xcite .",
    "empirical constraints can be obtained by studying the changes in neutron spin - orbit splittings when the number of protons change and vice versa , as in the recent study of spectroscopic properties of @xmath0si and @xmath1s @xcite .",
    "this task is , however , not straightforward because single - particles energies and occupations factors are not direct observables @xcite .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "the difference between the isospin dependence of rmf and non - relativistic spin - orbit interactions can be analyzed by performing a non - relativistic reduction of the dirac equation .",
    "such a study was reported , for instance , by sulaksono et al .",
    "@xcite with the goal to compare in a global way the magnitude of spin - orbit terms in these two approaches . in this work we focus on the isospin dependence of the spin - orbit effect using relativistic edfs with density - dependent strength parameters , and evaluate the effect of explicit treatment of exchange terms in relativistic structure models .",
    "most scmf models based on the relativistic mean - field approximation have been formulated using the finite - range meson - exchange representation , in which the nucleus is described as a system of dirac nucleons coupled to mesons fields through an effective lagrangian .",
    "the isoscalar scalar @xmath2-meson , the isoscalar vector @xmath3-meson , and the isovector vector @xmath4-meson build the minimal set of meson fields that , together with the electromagnetic field , is necessary for a description of bulk and single - particle nuclear properties . the corresponding lagrangian density reads @xmath5 where , for simplicity , we omit the coulomb term which is not relevant for the present discussion .",
    "@xmath6 denotes the nucleon spinor , @xmath7 is the nucleon bare mass , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 denote the meson masses . @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the @xmath3 and @xmath4 meson field tensors .",
    "boldface symbols denote vectors and tensors in isospin space .",
    "the meson - nucleon couplings are assumed to be functions of the nucleon density ( time - like component of the nucleon 4-current ) @xmath13 , and this density dependence in principle encodes all in - medium many - body correlations .    in the self - consistent rmf framework",
    "the dynamics of independent nucleons is determined by local scalar and vector self - energies . for simplicity",
    "spherical nuclei are considered and time - reversal symmetry is assumed ( pairwise occupied states with kramers degeneracy ) , which ensures that the only non - vanishing components of the 4-vector fields are the time - like ones and thus there is no net contribution from nucleon currents . because of charge conservation only the 3rd component of the vectors in isospin space gives a non - vanishing contribution .",

    "the scalar and time - like vector self - energies read : @xmath24    @xmath25    the explicit dependence of the coupling functions on the baryon density @xmath26 produces rearrangement contributions to the vector nucleon self - energy .",
    "the rearrangement terms result from the variation of the couplings with respect to the baryon density .    in applications to nuclear matter and finite nuclei , relativistic models are used in the _ no - sea _ approximation : the dirac sea of states with negative energies does not contribute to the densities and currents . in the nuclear ground state",
    "a nucleons occupy the lowest single - nucleon orbitals , determined self - consistently by the iterative solution of the dirac equation ( [ dirac ] ) . expressing the single - nucleon energy as @xmath27 , where @xmath7 is the nucleon mass , and rewriting the dirac equation as a system of two equations for @xmath22 and @xmath23 , then , noticing that for bound states @xmath28 , the equation for the upper component @xmath22 of the dirac spinor reduces to the schr \" odinger - like form @xcite @xmath29 \\phi_i = \\varepsilon_i    \\phi_i\\ ] ] for a nucleon with effective mass    @xmath30    in the potential @xmath31 . the resulting additional spin - orbit potential @xcite @xmath32 plays a crucial role in reproducing the empirical nuclear magic numbers .",

    "the isoscalar density @xmath34 can be approximated by the non - relativistic nucleon density @xmath13 . at the energy scale characteristic for nuclear binding , meson exchange",
    "( @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath35 ) is just a convenient representation of the effective nuclear interaction .",
    "the exchange of heavy mesons is associated with short - distance dynamics that can not be resolved at low energies , and therefore in each channel meson exchange can be replaced by the corresponding local four - point ( contact ) interactions between nucleons .",
    "the relation between the two representations : finite - range ( meson exchange ) and zero - range ( point - coupling ) , is straightforward in nuclear matter because of constant nucleon scalar and vector densities .",
    "the klein - gordon equations of the meson - exchange model with meson masses @xmath36 and density - dependent couplings @xmath37 , are replaced by the corresponding point - coupling interaction terms with strength parameters @xmath38 . in finite nuclei , however , because of the radial dependence of the densities , the expansion of the meson propagator in terms of @xmath39 leads to a series of gradient terms @xcite .",

( [ eq : w1w2 ] ) but , in addition to the isovector - vector , it contains also an isovector - scalar contribution but the strength parameter @xmath68 of this channel is not independent . in the meson - exchange representation",

    "it should be noted that , in contrast to the value of the ratio @xmath71 used in standard non - relativistic hartree - fock calculations , in the rmf case the ratio @xmath73 is close to one .",

    "the effective rhf interaction is pko2 @xcite which includes the @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 meson exchange , but not the pion or the @xmath69-meson .",
    "the most important result is that in this case the overall value of the ratio @xmath73 is around 1.8 .",
    "this is significantly larger than in the simple rmf approach based on the hartree approximation , and much closer to the value 2 which characterises standard non - relativistic hf calculations based on skyrme forces .",
    "the difference with respect to the latter is due to the fact that there is already an isovector dependence of the effective spin - orbit potential for the lagrangian pko2 which arises because of the @xmath4-meson exchange contribution , and also due to the non - relativistic reduction of the single - nucleon dirac equation to the schr \" odinger - like form eq .",

    "( [ eq : w1w2fierz ] ) for the case of the relativistic hartree - fock effective interaction pko2.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=80.0% ]    an effect that has been attributed to the isospin dependence of the effective spin - orbit potential is the change ( kink ) of charge isotope shifts across the @xmath78 shell gap @xcite .",
    "the charge isotope shift is the difference between the charge radius @xmath79 of a given isotope with respect to the reference nucleus .",
    "the best known example is the kink in the isotope shifts of even pb nuclei and , more recently , a similar effect has also been observed in polonium isotopes @xcite .",
    "numerous calculations over the last twenty years have shown that all relativistic mean - field effective interactions , both at the rmf level ( without or with inclusion of the isovector scalar @xmath69 meson ) and in the rhf approach , reproduce the empirical kink in the isotope shifts of even pb isotopes @xcite .",
    "this was explained by a relatively weak isospin dependence of the corresponding spin - orbit potentials .",
    "conventional skyrme hf parameterizations with @xmath80 were unable to reproduce the kink and , therefore , in ref .",
    "@xcite the skyrme framework was extended with an additional degree of freedom in the spin - orbit channel which allows to modify the value of the ratio @xmath72 .",
    "this simple modification of the skyrme functional , in which the relative weights of the neutron and proton contributions to the spin - orbit potential can be freely adjusted , produces values for the isotope shifts of pb in reasonable agreement with data .",
    "experimental values @xcite are shown in comparison with theoretical results obtained in the rmf calculation with the effective interaction dd - pc1 , using the relativistic hartree - fock effective interaction pko2 , and with the rmf model obtained by performing the fierz transformation of the point - coupling approximation of pko2.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=60.0% ]    in figure [ fig:3 ] we plot the experimental isotope shifts for even - a pb nuclei with respect to the reference nucleus @xmath76pb , in comparison with results obtained in the rmf calculation with the effective interaction dd - pc1 , using the relativistic hartree - fock effective interaction pko2 , and with the rmf model obtained by performing the fierz transformation of the equivalent point - coupling approximation of pko2 . in all three cases",
    "the theoretical values reproduce the empirical kink at @xmath78 and , in particular , the kink is most pronounced in the rmf calculation with the fierz - transformed effective interaction pko2 , even though @xmath81 for this model .",
    "this result is consistent with a more recent interpretation of the change of charge isotope shifts across the @xmath78 shell gap @xcite , in which the kink is attributed to the occupation of the @xmath82 neutron orbital and the resulting overlap between neutron and proton orbitals with the same principal quantum number , @xmath83 .",
    "it was noted that effective forces for which the @xmath82 neutron orbital has a significant occupation above @xmath78 , display an increase in the isotope shift of the @xmath83 proton states .",
    "this is because when neutrons gradually occupy the @xmath84 orbital , proton states expand to larger radii to maximally overlap with the additional neutrons @xcite . in the present calculation ,",
    "both for dd - pc1 and pko2 , the neutron orbitals @xmath84 and @xmath85 are almost degenerate above @xmath78 , and this leads to significant occupation of @xmath82 and the resulting sudden increase in the isotope shifts .",
    "in fact , the quasi - degeneracy of @xmath85 and @xmath82 corresponds to an approximate realization of pseudospin symmetry of single - nucleon states with @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "when the fierz transformation is performed on the point - coupling approximation of pko2 , the equivalent rmf lagrangian leads to the lowering of the orbital @xmath82 below @xmath85 .",
    "although it can not directly be compared to data @xcite , this discrepancy with the experimental spectra of @xmath88pb and @xmath89pb is probably caused by the fact that the parameters of the equivalent lagrangian are not fine - tuned after performing the point - coupling approximation .",
    "nevertheless , it leads to the pronounced kink shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] .",
    "in fact we note that the best agreement with the empirical kink is obtained with those interactions for which pseudospin symmetry is realized in the single - neutron spectra ( here dd - pc1 and pko2 , but also other relativistic interactions ) .",
    "if this symmetry is broken by further lowering @xmath82 , below @xmath90 , the kink in the isotope shifts becomes too strong compared to data ( cf .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ) .",
    "the presence of the kink in the isotope shifts and the relativistic models that reproduce the data thus provide evidence for the occurrence of pseudospin symmetry in neutron - rich pb nuclei .    in conclusion",
    ", we have analyzed the isospin dependence of the effective spin - orbit potential in standard relativistic meson - exchange or point - coupling ( contact ) effective interactions , when used in the mean - field ( hartree ) or hartree - fock approximations . by performing a non - relativistic reduction of the single - nucleon dirac equation to a schr \" odinger - like form that explicitly exhibits the spin - orbit potential ,",
    "the corresponding isospin dependence can be directly compared to that of the non - relativistic hartree - fock models based on effective skyrme forces .",
    "this isospin dependence can be characterised by the ratio @xmath73 of the two parameters in the expression for the effective spin - orbit potential eq .",
    "( [ w1andw2 ] ) . in conventional non - relativistic hartree - fock mean - field calculations based on the skyrme force @xmath71 ,",
    "whereas in standard rmf models this ratio is close to 1 .",
    "the deviation from 1 arises because of the explicit isovector contribution to the spin - orbit potential .",
    "it should be noted that , because of the medium - dependence of the effective coupling parameters , either through an explicit density dependence or higher - order self - interaction terms , the ratio @xmath73 is density dependent in the relativistic approach . in the case of relativistic hartree - fock models , to evaluate the effect of exchange terms we have performed a fierz transformation of the point - coupling rhf lagrangian and derived an equivalent rmf lagrangian that , in addition to the isovector - vector contribution of the original rhf lagrangian ( @xmath4-meson exchange ) , contains also an isovector - scalar term . as a result ,",
    "the ratio @xmath91 is much closer to the value that characterises standard skyrme hartree - fock models .",
    "this result is important in view of recent experimental efforts to explore the isospin dependence of spin - orbit forces in nuclei .",
    "it shows that , when comparing with results obtained using conventional skyrme hf models , fock terms should also be treated explicitly in relativistic mean - field models or , if one wants to preserve the advantage of local density functionals , the isovector - scalar channel has to be taken into account in addition to the usual isovector - vector contribution .",
    "of course , this channel has been considered before in relativistic structure models , however the standard data ( masses , radii ) could not be used to discern between the two isovector channels .",
    "information on the isospin dependence of the energy spacings between spin - orbit partner states could thus be used to determine the isovector - scalar channel contribution .",
    "we have also shown that the reproduction of the empirical kink in the isotope shifts of even pb nuclei by relativistic effective interactions points to the occurrence of pseudospin symmetry in the single - neutron spectra in these nuclei .",

    "<S> relativistic self - consistent mean - field ( scmf ) models naturally account for the coupling of the nucleon spin to its orbital motion , whereas non - relativistic scmf methods necessitate a phenomenological ansatz for the effective spin - orbit potential . </S>",
    "<S> recent experimental studies aim to explore the isospin properties of the effective spin - orbit interaction in nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> scmf models are very useful in the interpretation of the corresponding data , however standard relativistic mean - field and non - relativistic hartree - fock models use effective spin - orbit potentials with different isovector properties , mainly because exchange contributions are not treated explicitly in the former . </S>",
    "<S> the impact of exchange terms on the effective spin - orbit potential in relativistic mean - field models is analysed , and it is shown that it leads to an isovector structure similar to the one used in standard non - relativistic hartree - fock . </S>",
    "<S> data on the isospin dependence of spin - orbit splittings in spherical nuclei could be used to constrain the isovector - scalar channel of relativistic mean - field models . </S>",
    "<S> the reproduction of the empirical kink in the isotope shifts of even pb nuclei by relativistic effective interactions points to the occurrence of pseudospin symmetry in the single - neutron spectra in these nuclei . </S>"
