    "the obtention of density - potential pairs ( pdp ) corresponding to idealized thin discs is a problem of great astrophysical relevance , motivated by the fact that the main part of the mass in many galaxies is concentrated in an stellar flat distribution , usually assumed as axisymmetric ( @xcite ) .",
    "once the potential - density pair ( pdp ) is formulated as a model for a galaxy , usually the next step is to find the corresponding distribution function ( df ) .",
    "this is one of the fundamental quantities in galactic dynamics specifying the distribution of the stars in the phase - space of positions and velocities .",
    "although the df can generally not be measured directly , there are some observationally accesible quantities that are closed related to the df : the projected density and the light - of - sight velocity , provided by photometric and kinematic observations , are examples of df s moments .",
    "thus , the formulation of a pdp with its corresponding equilibrium dfs establish a self - consistent stellar model that can be corroborated by astronomical observations .    now then",
    ", there is a variety potential - density pairs for such flat stellar models , e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite . in particular",
    ", @xcite formulated a generalized family of models whose first member is the one introduced by @xcite .",
    "this family represents a set of discs of infinite extension , derived by solving the laplace equation in cylindrical coordinates subject to appropriated boundary conditions on the discs and at infinity .",
    "analogously , @xcite obtained a family of finite thin discs ( generalized kalnajs discs ) whose first member corresponds precisely to the well - known model derived by @xcite .",
    "such family was derived by using the hunter s method ( @xcite ) , which is based in the obtention of solutions of laplace equation in terms of oblate spheroidal coordinates , by imposing some appropriate conditions on the surface density .",
    "so , by requiring that the surface density behaves as a monotonously decreasing function of the radius , with a maximum at the center of the disk and vanishing at the edge , detailed expressions for the gravitational potential and the rotational velocity were obtained as series of elementary functions .",
    "also , some two - integral distribution functions for the first four members of this family were recently obtained by @xcite .",
    "now then , as the generalized kalnajs models correspond to discs of finite extension , they can be considered as more realistic descriptions of flat galaxies than the toomre s family .    in the present paper",
    "we formulate a new infinite set of finite thin discs , obtained by superposing the members of the generalized kalnajs family in such a way that the resulting density surface can be expressed as a well behaved function of the gravitational potential . as it was pointed out by some authors , this is a fundamental requirement for the searching of equilibrium distribution functions ( df ) describing such axisymmetric systems ( see for example , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . thus , the new family formulated here has the advantage of easily providing the corresponding two - integral dfs .    furthermore , the models have two additional advantages . in one hand ,",
    "the mass surface density is well - behaved , as in the case of generalized kalnajs discs , having a maximum at the center and vanishing at the edge .",
    "moreover , the mass distribution of the higher members of the family is more concentrated at the center . on the other hand ,",
    "the rotation curves are better behaved than in the kalnajs discs .",
    "we found that , in some cases , the circular velocity increases from a value of zero at the center of the disc , then reaches a maximum at some critical radius and , after that , remains approximately constant .",
    "as it is known , such behavior has been observed in many disclike galaxies .",
    "now , apart from the circular velocity , there are two important quantities concerning to the interior kinematics of the models : the epicyclic and vertical frequencies , which describe the stability against radial and vertical perturbations of particles in quasi - circular orbits .",
    "we found that the models formulated here are radially stable whereas vertically unstable , which is a characteristic inherited from the generalized kalnajs family ( @xcite ) .",
    "when we deal with three dimensional orbits , there are also a common feature between the new models and the kalnajs family : the phase space structure of disc - crossing orbits , that can be viewed through the poincar surfaces of section , is composed by shape - of - ring kam curves and prominent chaotic zones .",
    "however , there are certain situations in which the chaoticity disappears and the 3-dimensional motion of test particles is completely regular . in such cases , one can suggest the existence of a third integral of motion , as in the case of stckel and kuzmin potentials .    finally , in order to formulate the new family as a set of self - consistent stellar models , we shall deal with the problem of obtaining the corresponding equilibrium dfs . by jeans",
    "s theorem , they are functions of the isolating integrals of motion that are conserved in each orbit .",
    "some authors have shown that , if the density can be written as a function of the gravitational potential , it is possible to find such kind of two - integral dfs ( see eddington ( 1916 ) ; fricke ( 1952 ) ; @xcite ; jiang and ossipkov ( 2007 ) ) . in this paper",
    "we shall adopt the approach introduced by @xcite , which fits quite well to axisymmetric disc - like systems .",
    "then , starting from the dfs derived from this method , a second kind of dfs is obtained by using the formulae introduced by @xcite , that takes into account the principle of maximum entropy .",
    "these dfs describe stellar systems with a preferred rotational state .",
    "accordingly , the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , at section [ sec : newfam ] , we obtain the potential - density pairs for the new family of thin disc models . then , at section [ sec : kin ] , we study the motion of test particles around these new galactic models and , at section [ sec : dfs ] , we derive the distribution functions associated with the models .",
    "finally , at section [ sec : conc ] , we summarize our main results .",
    "in this subsection we summarize the principal features of the generalized kalnajs family , introduced by @xcite , an infinite family of axially symmetric finite thin discs .",
    "the mass surface density of each disc ( labeled with the positive integer @xmath0 ) is given by @xmath1^{n-1/2 } , \\label{densidad}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the total mass , @xmath3 is the disc radius and @xmath4 are constants given by @xmath5 such mass distribution generates an axially symmetric gravitational potential , that can be written as @xmath6 here , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the usual legendre polynomials and the legendre functions of the second kind respectively , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are spheroidal oblate coordinates , related to the usual cylindrical coordinates @xmath11 through the relations @xmath12 in such a way that the discs are located at @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "finally , the @xmath15 are constants given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the gravitational constant .",
    "as it was shown by @xcite , in these models the surface density is a monotonously decreasing function of the radius , with a maximum at the center of the disk and vanishing at the edge , being the mass distribution of the higher members of the family more concentrated at the center . on the other hand ,",
    "the corresponding rotation curves behave as follows : for @xmath18 , the circular velocity is proportional to the radius , whereas for the other members of the family it increases from a value of zero at the center of the discs , then reaches a maximum at a critical radius and , finally , decreases to a finite value at the edge .",
    "besides , the critical radius decreases as the value of @xmath0 increases .",
    "now , we will show that it is possible to formulate a new family of stellar models by performing a linear combination of generalized kalnajs discs , in such a way that the new surface densities can be written as polynomials of the new potentials .",
    "as it was quoted , this is a basic requirement for the derivation of equilibrium dfs through the kalnajs formalism sketched above . in particular , we are interested on to derive a simple relation between the relative potential on the disc and the surface density .    at first , note that @xmath19 , given by ( [ dk ] ) , can be rewritten as @xmath20 where @xmath21 are constants defined as @xmath22 and the relation ( [ eq : phi1 ] ) was derived by introducing the identity ( @xcite ) @xmath23 from ( [ eq : phi1 ] ) we note that the maximum value of the gravitational potential on the @xmath0th disc is @xmath24 .",
    "therefore , we define the relative potential on such a disc as @xmath25 now , suppose that we can choose a linear combination of those @xmath26 leading to a new relative potential @xmath27 of the form @xmath28 where @xmath29 are constants that can be determined from @xmath30 and @xmath31 ( see section [ sec : bn ] ) .",
    "the new relative potential @xmath27 is generated by a new mass distribution described by a surface density @xmath32 that is also a linear combination of generalized kalnajs discs @xmath33 .",
    "that is @xmath34 from this relation and ( [ potnew ] ) , we can note that @xmath32 can be rewritten as @xmath35 thus , we can see that this new family of discs is characterized by the fact that the surface density can be split as a combination of powers of the relative potential .",
    "this important fact makes viable the further derivation of two integral dfs for the whole family ( see section [ sec : dfs ] ) , that can be considered as a set of self - consistent galactic models .",
    "now , the above statements are only true if we can determinate the constants @xmath29 , introduced in ( [ potnew ] ) . in the next subsection , we show a procedure that , by using the orthogonality properties of @xmath36 , leads to a recurrence relation expressing @xmath29 in terms of @xmath30 and @xmath31 .      according to definitions ( [ eq : psidef ] ) and ( [ dk ] ) , the relative potential associated to the generalized kalnajs discs can be written as @xmath38 where",
    "@xmath39 are constants defined by @xmath40 so , by introducing ( [ eq : psileg ] ) into ( [ potnew ] ) , @xmath27 can also be written in terms of legendre polynomials as @xmath41 where @xmath42 are constants to be determined . here",
    ", it is important to note that these @xmath42 are such that    @xmath43    the above equations can be written in a compact way as @xmath44 which summarizes the previous series of recurrence relations .",
    "now , let us come to the problem of calculating @xmath45 .",
    "according to ( [ potnew ] ) and ( [ eq : psir ] ) , we have @xmath46 and by using the orthogonality properties of legendre polynomials , we obtain @xmath47 that reduces to @xmath48,\\ ] ] in such a way that , by using ( [ eq:4.25a ] ) , we can determine the constants @xmath37 . in order to do this ,",
    "note that equations ( [ eq:4.22])-([eq:4.25 ] ) give us recurrence relations : from ( [ eq:4.22 ] ) we obtain @xmath49 , from ( [ eq:4.23 ] ) we obtain @xmath50 , and so on .",
    "in general , we have    @xmath51    relations that can be summarized as @xmath52    in table [ tabla1 ] we show the values of @xmath37 for the first four models , i.e. @xmath53 . although we have solved the problem of finding these constants , there is another inconvenient . if one introduces such coefficients in ( [ dennew ] ) , the corresponding surface density is negative for certain ranges of @xmath54 , as it is shown in figure [ fig : densneg ] , where we plot the resulting @xmath55 for the first four models .",
    "however , this problem can be solved by correcting @xmath56 , i.e. the coefficient corresponding to the dominant term in ( [ dennew ] ) . in the next subsection , we show that it is possible to define minimum values for @xmath56 , corresponding to each model , in such a way that all of they be described by positive surface densities .",
    ".constants @xmath29 for the first four models : @xmath53 [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     so , taking this values as a lower limit for @xmath57 , the dfs given by ( [ dfsnew2 ] ) become positive - defined in the physical domain of the phase space .",
    "the figure [ fig : dfjac ] shows the graphics of the dfs as functions of the jacobi s integral , with different values of @xmath57 . in general",
    ", we can observe that the probability is maximum for small values of @xmath58 , and tends to a constant as @xmath58 increases .",
    "moreover , in the cases @xmath59 we can see that for values of @xmath57 near to @xmath60 , the probability has a minimum at @xmath61 , and it is zero for @xmath62 at @xmath63 , in agreement with equations ( [ sist1 ] ) and ( [ sist2 ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , it is convenient to derive a new kind of dfs , corresponding to more probable rotational states .",
    "as it was shown by @xcite , it is possible to obtain dfs obeying the maximum entropy principle , through the equation @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the even part of ( [ dfsnew2 ] ) . the figure [ fig : peddf1 ] shows the behavior of the dfs given by ( [ dfsnew3 ] ) . in ( a ) and ( b ) are plotted the contours corresponding to the model @xmath66 , with different values of parameter @xmath67 .",
    "as it can be seen , @xmath67 determines a particular rotational state in the stellar system . as @xmath67 increases , the probability to find a star with positive @xmath68 increases as well .",
    "a similar result can be obtained for @xmath69 , when the probability to find a star with negative @xmath68 decreases as @xmath67 decreases , and the corresponding plots would be analogous to figure [ fig : peddf1 ] , after a reflection about @xmath70 . in ( c ) and",
    "( d ) are plotted the contours of model @xmath71 with @xmath72 for the same values of @xmath67 .",
    "the behavior of the dfs for the remaining cases is pretty similar to the shown in these figures : when @xmath73 , the contours are similar to ( a ) and ( b ) , while if @xmath74 , the contours are similar to ( c ) and ( d ) , in agreement with figure [ fig : dfjac ] .",
    "we have obtained a set of models for axisymmetric flat galaxies , by superposing members belonging to the generalized kalnajs discs family .",
    "the mass distribution of each model ( labeled through the parameter @xmath75 ) , described by ( [ dennew ] ) , is maximum at the center and vanishes at the edge , in concordance with a great variety of galaxies .",
    "moreover , the mass density can be expressed as a function of the gravitational potential ( see equation ( [ dennew2 ] ) ) , which makes possible to derive , analytically , the equilibrium dfs describing the statistical features of the models .",
    "these models have also interesting features concerning with the interior kinematical behavior .",
    "on one hand , we showed that for some values of @xmath56 , the circular velocity has a behavior very similar to that seen in many discoidal galaxies .",
    "this is a very relevant fact , which suggests that it is not always necessary to introduce the hypothesis of dark matter halos ( or mond theories ) in order to describe adequately a variety of rotational curves . on the other hand",
    ", the analysis of epicyclic and vertical frequencies , associated to quasi - circular orbits , reveals that the models are stable under radial perturbations but unstable under vertical disturbances . with regard to the motion of test particles around the models formulated here",
    ", we found that the behavior of disc - crossing orbits is similar to that seen in the generalized kalnajs family .",
    "however , for certain values of the parameter @xmath56 , the poincar surface of section reveals that one can suggest the existence of a ( non analytical ) third integral of motion .    on the other hand , we find two kinds of equilibrium dfs for the models .",
    "such two - integral dfs can be formulated , at first , as functionals of the jacobi s integral , as it was sketched in the formalism developed by @xcite .",
    "this class of dfs essentially describes systems which rotational state , in average , behaves as a rigid body .",
    "then , we use the procedure introduced by @xcite , obtaining dfs which represents systems with a mean rotational state consistent with the maximum entropy principle and , therefore , more probable than the first ones .",
    "the statements exposed above suggest that the family presented here , can be considered as a set of realistic models that describes satisfactorily a great variety of galaxies .",
