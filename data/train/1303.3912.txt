    "stars with mass below @xmath12 , shortly after the end of core helium burning , develop a degenerate core of carbon and oxygen , and evolve supported by two nuclear regions , where cno and 3@xmath13 burning occur .",
    "due to the narrow dimensions of the he  burning layer , @xmath14 burning is not thermally stable @xcite , and occurs periodically , in violent episodes known as thermal pulses ( hereinafter tp ) ; for most of the time cno burning is the only energy channel active in the star @xcite . in the hertzprung  russell diagram , the evolutionary tracks , after the excursion to the blue during the core he  burning phase , turn again to the red ; this evolutionary phase is commonly known as asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) .",
    "more massive objects , with mass @xmath15 , undergo a similar evolution , with the difference that their internal temperatures are sufficiently high to trigger carbon ignition in a partially degenerate region , near the stellar center @xcite . in these stars the inwards propagation of a convective flame favors the formation of a core made up of oxygen and neon . like their lower mass counterparts , they also undergo a series of thermal pulses , and evolve in the super asymptotic giant branch ( sagb ) phase @xcite .",
    "the fate of agb stars is to eventually loose their envelope , and evolve to the white dwarf stage .",
    "the final stages of the evolutionary history of sagbs is more uncertain .",
    "if the mass loss rate is low , their core grows in mass until exceeding the chandrasekhar limit , thus favoring the conditions for core  collapse supernova , via electron capture .",
    "alternatively , they evolve as one white dwarfs @xcite .",
    "the agb evolution is rather short compared to the previous phases of core burning , but it proves extremely important because it is during this phase that most of the mass is lost from the star . understanding the evolution of the surface chemistry of these stars is crucial for a number of topics , such as the role played by agbs and sagbs as dust producers @xcite , that was shown to depend critically on the abundances of the various chemical species in the surface layers of the star @xcite .",
    "agb and the sagb stars have been invoked to explain the observations of stars in globular clusters ( gc ) @xcite .",
    "the spectroscopic and photometric results gathered in the last decades indicate the presence of multiple populations @xcite , and that ( at least ) a new generation of stars formed from the ashes of rapidly evolving stars belonging to the original population of the cluster .",
    "massive agbs and sagbs appear to be the most appealing candidates , in spite of an ongoing debate , due to the various uncertainties affecting the robustness of the results of agb modeling .",
    "this is the reason why some research groups argued against the possibility that agb winds could ever reproduce the chemical patterns observed @xcite , whereas other investigations showed that on the qualitative side the most massive agbs produce ejecta whose chemistry is in agreement with the anticorrelations observed @xcite .",
    "the investigations by @xcite set the theoretical framework to describe the formation of a second generation of stars in gcs , by gas ejected by agb and sagb stars , diluted with pristine gas having the original chemistry .",
    "these studies outlined the importance of the role played by sagbs : these stars evolve rapidly , and their winds could give origin to the formation of a he  rich stellar component , whose presence is suggested by photometric investigations of some gcs .",
    "the yields from sagbs are therefore crucial for this study .",
    "the spectroscopic analysis of stars belonging to the blue ms of gcs constitute a valuable test of the self ",
    "enrichment by agbs mechanism , because their surface chemistry should reflect the composition of the yields of sagbs .    our previous investigations on this topic were based on a single metallicity , z=0.001 , corresponding to the chemistry of gcs with intermediate metallicity @xcite .",
    "this limitation was caused by lack of sagb models of different metallicity , with the exception of the compilation by @xcite .",
    "to allow a more complete analysis we present here agb and sagb models spanning the range of metallicities of gcs , ranging from the chemistry typical of low ",
    "metallicity gcs , @xmath1 , to the more metallic clusters , i.e. @xmath2 .",
    "although we discuss the implications for the self ",
    "enrichment by agb & sagb stars , this investigation is focused on the properties of the models , while the analysis of how these new yields compare with the observations of the gcs of the same metallicity is postponed to future investigations .",
    "the models presented and discussed in this paper were calculated by means of the aton code for stellar evolution .",
    "a detailed description of the numerical structure of the code can be found in @xcite .",
    "the metallicities investigated are @xmath2 and @xmath1 .",
    "the mixtures follow the relative abundances of the elements according to @xcite , with @xmath16enhancement @xmath17fe@xmath18=+0.2 $ ] ( for @xmath2 ) and @xmath17fe@xmath18=+0.4 $ ] ( for @xmath1 ) .",
    "these choices correspond to [ fe / h]@xmath19 and [ fe / h]@xmath20 , typical of high metallicity gcs , such as ngc 6388 , and low  metallicity structures , such as ngc 2419 .",
    "convection was modelled in all cases by means of the full spectrum of turbulence ( fst ) model , presented by @xcite .",
    "the impact of this choice has been discussed extensively in the literature ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and will not be repeated here .    in convectively unstable regions nuclear burning and mixing of chemicals were coupled by means of a diffusive approach , using the scheme by @xcite .",
    "overshoot of convective eddies into radiatively stable regions is modelled by assuming an exponential decay of convective velocities starting from the convective borders ; the e",
    " folding distance of this behavior is given by @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the free parameter measuring the extent of the extra  mixing . during the two main phases of core burning we assumed @xmath23 , in agreement with @xcite .",
    "we further explore the effects of a tiny extra  mixing from the convective shell that forms during the ignition of each thermal pulse ( pulse driven convective shell , hereianfter pdcs ) by comparing the results obtained by neglecting any extra  mixing during the agb evolution , with those found by assuming @xmath24 : this assumption was found to enhance the strength of thermal pulses , and to an increase in the inwards penetration of the external mantle during the post ",
    "pulse phases @xcite .",
    "no overshoot was assumed from the bottom of the convective envelope during the agb phase .",
    "these choices , far from being a true calibration of a still largely unknown physical phenomenon , are intended to have a rough estimate on how the extent of the third dredge  up , and consequently the yields of the elements discussed in this investigation , depend on the various factors that favor an enhancement of the inwards penetration of the convective envelope in the phases following the thermal pulse .",
    "a much more detailed treatment would be required for those phenomena strongly dependent on the details of such a penetration , such as the s  process enrichment .",
    "mass loss was modelled according to @xcite .",
    "the free parameter entering this recipe was set to @xmath25 , in agreement with the calibration based on the luminosity function of lithium  rich stars in the magellanic clouds given by @xcite .",
    "the blcker description is based on a steep dependence of @xmath26 on luminosity , @xmath27 , in agreement with dynamical models of agb envelopes by @xcite . for m stars , with masses @xmath28 , evolving at large luminosities ,",
    "the mass loss rates used here are substantially larger than other treatments in the literature , such as the classic recipe by @xcite , or the empirical relation by @xcite ; this difference will result in a smaller number of thermal pulses . for models of smaller mass , the comparison between the blcker formula and the treatment for c ",
    "star winds by @xcite is mainly determined by the strong sensitivity to the effective temperature ( @xmath29 ) of this latter . in this mass interval",
    "the mass loss rates used here are smaller , although a comparison with other investigations in the literature is not trivial , because the effects of the mass loss treatment are strongly related to the way convection is modelled , which is relevant for the effective temperature of the models .",
    "radiative opacities for temperatures above 10000k were computed by the opal release , in the version documented by @xcite . in the low temperature regime",
    "we use the aesopus tool by @xcite , that allows to account for changes in the surface chemistry determined by tdu and hbb .",
    "though more time consuming , this choice is mandatory for a reliable description of the evolutionary phases during the agb evolution that follow the carbon enrichment of the external layers , as discussed in details in @xcite .",
    "the conductive opacities were taken from poteckhin ( 2006 ) , and are added harmonically to the radiative opacities .",
    "tables of the equation of state are generated in the ( gas ) pressure - temperature plane , according to the latest release of the opal eos ( 2005 ) , overwritten in the pressure ionization regime by the eos by @xcite , and extended to the high - density , high  temperature domain according to the treatment by @xcite .",

    "816 give information on the average composition of the ejecta , that is the helium mass fraction , the lithium content ( expressed in the standard notation for lithium , i.e. @xmath44 , and the abundances of the elements mostly investigated in the spectroscopic surveys of gc stars , i.e. the cno elements , sodium , magnesium ( where we intend the sum of the three isotopes ) , aluminium and silicon .",
    "the abundances from carbon to silicon are given as [ i / fe]@xmath45 , to allow a more straight comparison with the observations .",
    "the two panels of fig .  [ physics ] show the main physical properties of the agb evolution of the models computed : in the left panel we show the highest luminosity reached during the agb phase as a function of the corresponding core mass , whereas in the right panel we report the highest temperature reached at the bottom of the convective mantle .",
    "the trend of luminosity with core mass is rather similar for the two metallicities , with the exception of the models within the sagb regime : the lower metallicity models reach larger luminosities .    in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ physics ] we see a clear gap in temperature separating low  mass models , with core masses below @xmath46 , from their higher mass counterparts .",
    "these latter experience hot bottom burning ( hereinafter hbb ) , consisting in the nuclear activity at the bottom of the convective envelope when the temperature exceeds @xmath47mk .",
    "hbb favours a rapid increase in the luminosity of the star @xcite , and its description depends on the details of convection modelling @xcite .",
    "the threshold mass to achieve hbb is 3m@xmath41 and 3.5m@xmath41 , respectively , for the @xmath1 and @xmath2 cases . as will be discussed in more details in the following sections , hbb ignition has a strong influence on the chemical patterns .",
    "models experiencing hbb evolve at large luminosities , and loose their envelope much faster ; compared to the lower masses , they undergo a limited number of thermal pulses , so that the effects of tdu in the alteration of the surface chemistry is modest @xcite .",
    "models whose core ",
    "mass exceeds @xmath48 ignite carbon in an off ",
    "center , partially degenerate region , and evolve as sagb stars .",
    "the right panel of fig .",
    "[ physics ] confirms that the strength of hbb is extremely sensitive to metallicity .",
    "the @xmath49 vs @xmath50 trend of the two sets of models discussed here differ in the hbb domain . while in the @xmath2 models the temperature at the bottom of the external mantle hardly reaches 100mk , in all low",
    " z models undergoing hbb we find @xmath51 , with a maximum temperature , approaching 150mk , reached inside the @xmath52 model .",
    "this is going to have a great impact on the extent of the nucleosynthesis experienced , given the extreme sensitivity to t of the cross  section of the various proton capture channels around @xmath53mk .    as discussed in section [ models ] , the results obtained depend on the choices made to model convection and mass loss .",
    "the treatment of convection is essential in determining the strength of hbb : the range of masses experiencing hbb would be narrower if a lower  efficiency convection model , such as the mixing length theory , would be used .",
    "mass loss has no influence in determining whether hbb occurs for a given mass or not .",
    "however , changing the mass loss rate alters the rapidity with which mass loss occurs , hence the number of tps experienced . for models experiencing hbb ,",
    "we have seen that the blcker s",
    "recipe used here leads to mass loss rates in excess with other treatments in the literature : this favours a faster agb evolution , and the contamination of the surface chemistry determined by hbb will be softer , because there is no time of achieving a very advanced nucleosynthesis . in the low  mass regime , for models reaching the c  star stage , our recipe for mass loss leads to smaller rates : this reflects in a difference in the final core mass of the models , which is @xmath54 larger in the present case .",
    "the surface chemistry of agbs is modified by tdu and hbb .",
    "the results obtained change dramatically according to which of these two mechanisms is dominant , given the different chemical patterns produced .",
    "tdu determines an increase in the surface carbon , possibly followed by nitrogen synthesis via proton capture during the quiescent phase of cno burning .",
    "hbb changes the chemical composition according to the equilibrium abundances associated to p  capture nucleosynthesis ; this is extremely sensitive to the temperature at which hbb occurs .",
    "a fundamental difference between the effects of these two mechanisms is that the overall c+n+o keeps constant as far as hbb dominates , whereas it increases if repeated tdu episodes occur .",
    "the surface content of carbon , nitrogen and oxygen is touched by both tdu and hbb . in the three panels of fig .",
    "[ cno ] we show the average content of c ( left ) , n ( middle ) , o ( right ) in the ejecta of stars with initial mass in the range @xmath0 . to allow a more straight comparison with the spectroscopic analysis of stars in globular clusters , we show in the ordinate , for each elements @xmath55 , the quantity [ i / fe ] . for a solar ",
    "scaled mixture , a positive [ i / fe ] indicates a production of the @xmath55th element , whereas a negative value means that the element was destroyed .",
    "note that for oxygen , which is an @xmath13element , the threshold values separating the production and destruction regimes are + 0.2 and + 0.4 , respectively , for @xmath2 and @xmath1 .",
    "the same holds for magnesium and silicon .",
    "the @xmath2 models , indicated with red circles , are connected with dashed lines ; the results for @xmath1 are indicated with squares , connected with solid lines . in the low  mass regime , full points indicate the results obtained by neglecting extra  mixing from the convective shell formed during the thermal pulses ; models with some extra  mixing are indicated with open points .",
    "because this difference mainly reflects on the efficiency of the tdu , it has no influence in the high  mass domain , where the chemistry is mostly determined by hbb .",
    "[ c / fe ] increases with mass in the low  mass domain ( see left panel of fig  [ cno ] ) ; this holds independently of metallicity , and is due to the higher number of thermal pulses experienced by higher mass models , allowing a greater enrichment in the surface carbon .",
    "the yields of lower z models are predicted to be much richer in carbon , because mixing is more efficient in low metallicity models @xcite ; also , for a given penetration of the surface convection determined by tdu , the percentage increase in the abundance of a given element is larger the lower is z.    independently of the metallicity , assuming some extra  mixing from the borders of the pdcs , in agreement with the results by @xcite , favors the inwards penetration of the base of the envelope in the post  pulse phase , thus leading to a more efficient tdu .",
    "the carbon yields are consequently enhanced by a factor @xmath11 .    in models experiencing hbb carbon",
    "is destroyed during the interpulse phase , which is the reason for the negative trend with mass , shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "the @xmath1 models , though experiencing a stronger hbb ( see right panel of fig .  [ physics ] ) , show a higher carbon content , because of the effects of late tdu episodes , that increase the surface carbon content in the evolutionary phases preceding the white dwarf cooling , just before the whole envelope is lost .",
    "nitrogen is not directly touched by tdu , which refurbishes the envelope of carbon and ( in minor quantities ) of oxygen .",
    "this is the reason why models with mass below 22.5m@xmath41 show only a modest ( if any ) enhancement of nitrogen ( see the middle panel of fig .",
    "[ cno ] ) .",
    "the average nitrogen in the ejecta shows a sharp increase for masses around the threshold value separating the tdu from the hbb regime : in these models , the carbon carried to the surface by tdu is later converted into nitrogen during the interpulse phase .",
    "low z models , experiencing a deeper tdu and a stronger hbb , are more efficient nitrogen manufacturers .",
    "n is increased by a factor @xmath56 in the @xmath1 models experiencing both tdu and hbb , and by a factor @xmath57 in @xmath2 models .",
    "higher mass models , experiencing only hbb , achieve a smaller production of nitrogen : in this case the increase is only due to the conversion of the carbon and oxygen originally present in the gas , with no additional contribution from tdu .    unlike carbon , the predictions regarding the nitrogen content of the ejecta are more robust , and much less sensitive to the quantity of extra  mixing assumed from the borders of the pdcs .",
    "the influence of this latter is limited to the models achieving the maximum production of nitrogen , and is at most a factor @xmath58 for masses @xmath59 .",
    "oxygen is a key  element in the interpretation of the physical processes that alter the surface chemical composition of agbs : tdu produces a positive oxygen yield , whereas hbb destroys it .",
    "the variation of the surface oxygen in some of the models discussed here is shown in fig .",
    "[ o16 ] . the choice of the mass of the star ( decreasing during the evolution ) as abscissa allows a better understanding of the average chemistry of the yields .",
    "the solid and dashed lines in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ cno ] ( indicating , respectively , the metallicities @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) , trace similar patterns , with the difference that the lower  z line is more stretched both upwards and downwards . models with mass below @xmath60 produce oxygen ",
    "rich ejecta ( see fig .  [ o16 ] ) , because tdu prevails over hbb . in analogy with carbon , we find that in the @xmath1 models the increase in the surface oxygen is larger . this can be clearly seen in the difference between the increase in [ o / fe ] found in the low  mass ( @xmath61 ) models of @xmath1 ( left panel of fig .  [ o16 ] ) , and the corresponding models of @xmath2 ( right panel ) .    the oxygen yield becomes negative ( i.e. [ o / fe ] below + 0.4 for @xmath1 , and + 0.2 for @xmath2 ) for @xmath62 , where hbb destroys part of the surface oxygen .",
    "the effects of hbb can be seen in the decreasing trend of the surface oxygen found for @xmath62 for both metallicities .    because there is no way to produce oxygen efficiently via p ",
    "capture nucleosynthesis , the history of oxygen under the effects of hbb is a pure destruction process , that proceeds at a higher rate for larger hbb temperatures .",
    "this motivates the smaller oxygen in the ejecta of lower z models , and also the decreasing trend with mass for @xmath62 ( see right panel of fig .",
    "[ cno ] ) .",
    "the comparison among lines corresponding to massive agbs in the two panels of fig .",
    "[ o16 ] shows that oxygen is destroyed much more strongly in the @xmath1 case ( note the different scales of the two panels ) .",
    "the lowest oxygen abundances in the ejecta are found for @xmath63 , with [ o / fe]@xmath64 ( note that considering the initial [ o / fe]@xmath65 for this mixture , this corresponds to a reduction factor @xmath66 ) .",
    "the trend with mass becomes increasing in the sagb regime , despite these models experience a stronger hbb ( see right panel of fig .",
    "[ cno ] ) .",
    "this behaviour , discussed in @xcite , is due to the large mass loss rates experienced by sagbs , that loose their envelope before a great destruction of the surface oxygen occurs .",
    "both panels of fig .",
    "[ o16 ] show that the variation of [ o / fe ] with mass becomes less steep for @xmath67 , confirming that the mass loss rate of the largest masses is the key ",
    "factor for the larger oxygen in the ejecta of sagbs .    that mass loss is the key ",
    "quantity in this context is confirmed by the results we obtain by assuming a smaller parameter entering the blcker s recipe , @xmath68 ( corresponding to 1/4 of the standard value ) ; the corresponding oxygen abundances in the ejecta , indicated with open squares in fig .",
    "[ cno ] , are consequently reduced .",
    "the results of these simulations are shown as dotted lines in fig .",
    "[ o16 ] ; we see that the smaller mass loss favors ejection of oxygen  poor gas , because little mass is lost in the early agb phases , when the surface oxygen is still large .",
    "the surface abundances of magnesium and aluminium are altered by the effects of tdu and hbb .",
    "the initial total magnesium in the stars is mainly under the form of @xmath36 mg . in the regions touched by",
    "he  burning during the thermal pulses large amounts of @xmath38 mg and @xmath39 mg are produced , via a series of @xmath13captures , that start from @xmath33n , and produce magnesium via @xmath10ne .",
    "the effects of hbb on the magnesium abundance are more complex , due to the various proton capture reactions involving the different isotopes , ending up with the synthesis of aluminium @xcite .",
    "to destroy magnesium via hbb , temperatures at the bottom of the convective zone of the order of @xmath69k are needed : this is required to activate efficiently the p  capture by @xmath36 mg nuclei .",
    "the outcome of magnesium burning is sensitive to the hbb temperature .",
    "when the temperature is sufficiently large , great quantities of aluminium are produced , with also the synthesis of some silicon ; conversely , when the temperature is only slightly exceeding @xmath70k , most of the magnesium is locked in the @xmath38 mg isotope , with only a modest decrease in the total magnesium @xcite .    based on the above arguments , we understand that tdu and hbb produce opposite effects on the surface magnesium : while tdu increases the mg content , hbb favors mg  depletion , provided that the hbb temperatures exceed @xmath71k .",
    "because the initial magnesium is much larger ( by @xmath72 a factor 50 ) than aluminium , even a weak magnesium burning is sufficient to increase the surface aluminium .",
    "[ mgal ] shows the magnesium ( left panel ) and aluminium ( right ) content of the ejecta of the agb models presented in this investigation .",
    "the trend of [ mg / fe ] with mass is similar to oxygen .",
    "tdu in low ",
    "mass models favours an increase in the @xmath38 mg and @xmath39 mg produced in the tpds by the chain of @xmath13captures mentioned above . in high  z models the increase in the total magnesium is negligible , given the weaker efficiency of the tdu , and the higher initial magnesium in the envelope . in the low ",
    "metallicity case the increase in the surface total magnesium is sensitive to the efficiency of the tdu , as confirmed by the difference between the lines connecting open and full squares in the left panel , indicating , respectively , the results obtained with and without extra  mixing from the borders of the pdcs .    the increase in magnesium favors a contemporary increase in the surface aluminium , because part of @xmath38 mg and @xmath39 mg dredged  up to the surface is converted into aluminium during the following interpulse phase .",
    "models dominated by hbb show a different behavior : magnesium is destroyed by a series of proton captures starting from the reaction @xmath36mg(p,@xmath31)@xmath38al , that eventually lead to the formation of aluminium ( see e.g. @xcite for the details of the mg  al nucleosynthesis ) .",
    "the decrease in the total magnesium reaches a maximum around @xmath6 for the @xmath1 models , where the destruction factor is @xmath73 dex ; in the sagb regime the magnesium yields are higher , because mass loss is so fast to prevent great destruction of magnesium before the envelope is lost .",
    "models achieving the greatest destruction of magnesium also produce great quantities of aluminium , whose abundance is increased by a factor @xmath66 in comparison with the initial stellar content .",
    "agb stars are known to evolve through a phase when they are efficient lithium manufacturers .",
    "the mechanism by which lithium is produced in the envelope of these stars was first suggested by @xcite , and is activated whenever the temperature at the bottom of the convective envelope reaches @xmath74mk . under these conditions @xmath13capture by @xmath75he",
    "nuclei begins , with the production of beryllium , which decays into lithium ; because the time  scale for beryllium decay is @xmath76d , part of the lithium is produced in the outermost and cooler regions of the envelope , where it survives to proton fusion .",

    "@xcite confirmed that lithium production can be activated efficiently when convection is modelled according to the fst treatment , in all models with mass @xmath77 .    while the lithium  rich phase is crossed by all high  mass agb models , the amount of lithium which they eject into the interstellar medium is highly uncertain .",
    "the recent analysis by @xcite outlines the various factors affecting the lithium content of the agbs ejecta .",
    "the uncertainty of the results obtained stems from the fact that lithium production stops when the surface @xmath75he is consumed : the quantity of lithium expelled is determined by the mass lost by the star during the phase when it is lithium  rich .",
    "the recent investigation by @xcite stressed that the lithium yields by sagbs are even more uncertain .",
    "when the same slope of the mass loss vs luminosity relation used for agbs is adopted , sagb models are found to produce an extremely lithium  rich gas , because most of the mass is lost before @xmath75he is consumed completely . however , this latter finding is extremely sensitive to the mass loss rate adopted in the early thermal pulses experienced , after the formation of the one core .",

    "the oxygen yields are negative , because hbb destroys oxygen ; conversely , sodium can be produced , because of the initial increase in the surface sodium determined by the second dredge  up and by the @xmath10ne burning via proton capture .",

    "also , the gcs harboring a stellar generation formed directly from the ejecta of massive agbs , with no dilution with pristine gas , must show a correlation of the lowest oxygen abundances with metallicity , more metal  poor gcs showing the most oxygen  poor population . in these stars",

    "both the @xmath43 and the @xmath1 models produce magnesium  poor matter , the maximum reduction factor being , respectively , @xmath7[mg / fe]@xmath85 and @xmath7[mg / fe]@xmath86 . similarly to oxygen , we find that the most extreme chemistry is not found for the most massive , sagb models , because in the context of the present modeling these latter loose their envelope very rapidly , before a very advanced mg  al nucleosynthesis may occur .",
    "the magnesium depletion is accompanied by an increase in the surface aluminium .",
    "the al content in the ejecta reaches a threshold value of [ al / fe]@xmath87 , independently of the metallicity , and of the extent of the magnesium depletion .",
    "this is the effect of the balance reached between the production and destruction channels , that eventually leads to the formation of some silicon .",
    "the uncertainties affecting the extent of magnesium depletion and aluminium enhancement were discussed in details by @xcite .",
    "the main outcome of this investigation is that massive agbs in the low  z domain reach at the bottom of the surface convection zone temperatures sufficiently large to destroy @xmath36 mg , thus their ejecta are predicted to show large @xmath38mg/@xmath36 mg and @xmath39mg/@xmath36 mg isotopic ratios .",
    "the maximum depletion of the total magnesium was found to be determined by the cross section of the @xmath38mg(p,@xmath31)@xmath39al reaction in the range of temperatures around @xmath71k , an increase by a factor 2 in the reaction rate corresponding to a further @xmath88  dex in the magnesium depletion ( see fig .",

    "even a larger mg  depletion would scarcely influence the al  enhancement , due to the afore mentioned equilibrium established between production and destruction rates , once al increases by a factor @xmath11 .",
    "the recent years have seen a growing interest towards agb modeling .",
    "several research groups have contributed to produce an impressive series of models , spanning a wide range of mass and metallicities .",
    "some of these investigations were focused on the efficiency of mixing in low  mass agbs , and on the treatment of the borders at the convective / radiative interface @xcite .",
    "these studies complete the previous investigations on these evolutionary phases by @xcite , @xcite , and the most recent update by @xcite .",
    "on the side of sagb modeling , the recent works by @xcite provided a complete and exhaustive update of the pioneering explorations focused on the physics of carbon ignition in regime of partial degeneracy , by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .    among the above investigations on the agb phase",
    ", we decided to compare our results with those by @xcite ( k10 ) : in this compilation , the yields of models with mass in the range @xmath89 , and metallicities in the range @xmath90 are presented and discussed .",
    "k10 yields are indicated in fig .",
    "[ cno ] and [ mgal ] with blue triangles : the open points indicate the @xmath2 metallicity ( to be compared with the red points in our compilation ) , whereas full points refer to @xmath91 ( among the various metallicities treated in k10 , this is the closest to the @xmath1 case discussed here ) .    as for the sagb phase , the most complete investigation currently present in the literature",
    "is by @xcite ( hereinafter s10 ) , which treats the same chemistry as k10 , with masses in the range @xmath92 , i.e. those undergoing carbon ignition in conditions of partial degeneracy .",
    "the corresponding points are indicated as open pentagons ( @xmath2 ) and asterisks ( @xmath91 ) in figs .",
    "[ cno ] and [ mgal ] .    for what concerns carbon , for masses m@xmath93 , and metallicity @xmath2 , our yields for models calculated with some extra  mixing from the pdcs are rather similar to those by @xcite .",
    "the reason for this is in the similarity of the physical properties of the two sets of models in this range of mass .",
    "a comparison with the models presented in @xcite shows that for any given initial mass the core masses at the first tp are very close , whereas the minimum core mass at which tdu occurs is @xmath94 larger in our case .",
    "the investigations by @xcite and @xcite showed that to reproduce the luminosity function of carbon stars in the large magellanic cloud , whose metallicity is similar to @xmath2 , the core masses when the first tdu occurs must be @xmath95 smaller than in @xcite .",
    "this means that the carbon yields found in the low  mass models presented here must be considered as lower limits .    in the low ",
    "metallicity case the k10 carbon yields are a factor @xmath96 higher than ours ; certainly the smaller metallicity upon which the computations by k10 are based ( @xmath91 vs @xmath1 ) plays a role here , although other factors , such as a different efficiency of tdu , can not be ruled out as possible reasons for this difference . in both compilations",
    "we see a decrease with mass in the carbon content of the ejecta , although in the models presented here the carbon yields become negative ( i.e. the average carbon content of the ejecta is smaller as it was initially ) , whereas in k10 models [ c / fe ] hardly reaches 0 , rather it remains above 2 in the low  z case .",
    "this finding outlines the main difference between the models presented here and those by k10 , i.e. the extent of hbb , much stronger in our case , because of the large convective efficiency predicted by the fst treatment ; k10 models are based on the mlt treatment with @xmath97 , which leads to a much weaker hbb @xcite .",
    "[ confz8m3 ] compares the evolution of our models with metallicity @xmath2 ( black , solid lines ) with those of the same metallicity by k10 ( red , dashed tracks ) .",
    "the initial masses are slightly different , to compare models with the same core mass at the beginning of the agb phase : our @xmath98 and @xmath78 cases correspond , respectively , to masses @xmath99 and @xmath100 in k10 .",
    "the differences in the hbb experienced can be clearly seen in the comparison of the temperatures at the base of the envelope ( see right panel ) : models by k10 are @xmath101 cooler than ours .",
    "this is also related to the different luminosity of the models ( see right panel of fig .  [ confz8m3 ] ) .",
    "our models , evolving at larger luminosities , also suffer a larger mass loss , thus experience a smaller number of thermal pulses : we find a total of 35 and 37 tps for @xmath102 and @xmath103 , to be compared to 38 tps experienced by the k10 @xmath99 model , and 56 tps in the @xmath100 case .",
    "hbb also affects the oxygen yields , as can be seen in the right panel of fig .",
    "in the @xmath2 case we see that our models show some depletion of oxygen , by @xmath104dex , not found in the investigation by @xcite .",
    "the most striking difference is however found in the low  z case : while in the models presented here the ejecta are predicted to be extremely poor in oxygen , with a maximum depletion factor of the order of @xmath105 , in the k10 study we obtain , independently of the mass , oxygen  enriched matter , with [ o / fe]@xmath106 . to understand this difference",
    "we compared in details the most massive model in the k10 @xmath91 set , i.e. @xmath107 , with our @xmath1 model of the same core mass , i.e. @xmath108 . as in the previous comparison at larger metallicities , we find the same difference of @xmath101 ( 100mk in k10 , and 120mk in our case ) between the maximum temperatures experienced at the bottom of the convective envelope .",
    "these different temperatures would explain the larger depletion of oxygen in our exploration , but not the large oxygen content in the k10 yields ; this latter is due to the relevant contribution from tdu , partly due to the smaller metallicity of k10 models , and also to the much larger number of tps experienced ( the total number of tps in k10 and our model are , respectively , 109 and 54 ) .",
    "the differences outlined above have also a feedback on the amount of nitrogen that these stars produce . upon discussing the cno yields",
    ", we stressed that the most efficient production of nitrogen takes place when tdu and hbb are both operating during the agb evolution , because carbon transported outwards by tdu is later converted into nitrogen .",
    "while in our case this overproduction of nitrogen is restricted to masses @xmath59 ( more massive stars experience only a small number of thermal pulses , due to the strong hbb ) , in k10 this behavior is shared by practically all masses , as can be understood from the position of the full triangles in the middle panel of fig .",
    "[ cno ] .    in the comparison with the work by @xcite ,",
    "we preliminary note that the difference in the masses involved are due to the difference in the treatment of the convective borders during the main sequence phase of hydrogen burning .",
    "we assumed some overshoot from the border of the convective core , whereas s10 models were calculated with no extra  mixing : similar results are obtained for a mass @xmath109 larger in siess computations , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ cno ] .",
    "other than the shift in the initial mass , the @xmath2 models from the two compilations are fairly similar . in particular , we note that the maximum temperature reached at the bottom of the envelope ranges between @xmath71k to @xmath110k ( compare the values in the 7th col . of tab .  [ yields ] with those of col.15 in @xcite ) .",
    "this is the reason for the similarity in the cno yields at this metallicity . at these temperatures",
    "hbb is sufficiently strong to destroy carbon , and to synthesize nitrogen ; oxygen is only marginally touched .    turning to the low ",
    "metallicity regime , the @xmath1 yields presented here are rather different from those of @xmath91 by @xcite . while in our case we find @xmath111[o / fe]@xmath112 , in the s10 work it is @xmath113[o / fe]@xmath114 .",
    "the reason for this difference is twofold . on one hand , we see by comparing the temperatures reached at the bottom of the envelope of our models with their counterparts in the s10 compilation that these latter experience a much stronger hbb , owing to the smaller metallicity . also , in analogy with what found in @xcite , we stress the importance of the different treatment of mass loss : the blcker prescription used here leads to higher rates compared to the @xcite treatment used by @xcite ; our models loose their envelope before a great reduction of the surface oxygen is achieved .",
    "this is also clear in the difference in the number of tps , which exceeds 2000 in s10 , while it barely reaches 50 in our sagb models .",
    "a confirmation of this comes from the results from computations of models of @xmath12 and @xmath115 where the free parameter entering the blcker formula was reduced to @xmath68 , simulating a reduction of @xmath116 of the mass loss rate : the corresponding oxygen yields , indicated with open squares in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ cno ] , confirm that more oxygen  poor ejecta are produced when the mass loss rate is decreased .    among the various elements involved in p ",
    "capture nucleosynthesis , the evolution of the surface magnesium , and the amount of this element in the ejecta , is the most sensitive to the details of the modeling of the agb phase .",
    "this can be seen in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ mgal ] , where our yields are compared with those by @xcite and @xcite . in analogy with the cno elements , the yields corresponding to the @xmath2 chemistry are similar , whereas those for the low metallicity models are extremely different . for @xmath117 an increase in the magnesium content of the ejecta is found both in our models and in those by @xcite ; these latter predict a larger enrichment in magnesium , partly due to the smaller metallicity adopted .",
    "the magnesium yields of more massive stars are completely different : while our models , experiencing strong hbb , show a reduction of the initial magnesium , up to 0.6 dex at @xmath118 , the k10 yields are magnesium  rich , confirming the difference in the efficiency of the hbb experienced , and in the relative role played by hbb and tdu .",
    "both our and k10 models are found to be al  rich , as a consequence of the conversion of magnesium to aluminium via p - capture during the interpulse phase .    in the sagb domain",
    ", the differences with respect to the models by @xcite reflect the situation already found in the analysis of the oxygen content of the ejecta . because of the smaller mass loss experienced , the yields by @xcite are more mg  poor , because there is more time available to destroy the surface magnesium via hbb .",
    "we present and discuss new models of stars of intermediate mass , evolved during the agb phase , characterized by the occurrence of a series of thermal pulses .",
    "we also focus on the sagb evolution , experienced by models with mass @xmath119 , that develop a core of oxygen and neon .",
    "these results complete previous explorations from our group , based on a single metallicity , @xmath43 , and extend to metallicities typical of low  z globular clusters , i.e. @xmath1 , and to a chemistry typical of substantially higher metallicity clusters , @xmath2 .    in agreement with previous investigations",
    ", we find that massive models with @xmath77 experience hbb , whereas in lower  mass structures the only mechanism active in changing the surface chemistry is tdu .",
    "the ejecta of low  mass agbs are enriched in the overall c+n+o content , and also in magnesium , whereas the more massive models will reverse into the interstellar medium gas contaminated essentially by p ",
    "capture nucleosynthesis , with the depletion of the surface oxygen and magnesium , and the increase in the sodium and aluminium content .",
    "the extent of the hbb is found to be strongly sensitive to metallicity : low  z , massive agbs ( with @xmath1 , roughly corresponding to [ fe / h]@xmath20 ) reach very large temperatures at the bottom of the surface convective mantle , exceeding 100mk .",
    "the corresponding yields show a small oxygen content , up to @xmath66 times lower than in the initial mixture , and a magnesium depletion of a factor @xmath120 .",
    "aluminium is increased by a factor @xmath121 , which is the highest abundance achievable within the present schematization ; this is because at very large temperatures the production and destruction channels compensate : at these t s , silicon synthesis is expected .",
    "the oxygen and sodium in the ejecta are correlated , because for @xmath122mk oxygen depletion is accompanied by the destruction of the sodium previously accumulated by the second dredge  up , and further increased in the early agb phase , by proton ",
    "capture on @xmath10ne nuclei .",
    "the @xmath2 massive agb models experience only a modest hbb , thus the ejecta are expected to produce much less contaminated ejecta : magnesium is hardly touched by the hbb nucleosynthesis , whereas the depletion of oxygen barely exceeds a factor @xmath58 .    in the low  mass regime , where the surface chemistry in unaffected by hbb ,",
    "the results presented here are in good agreement with other investigations in the literature , although the extent of the carbon enrichment is sensitive to the details of the treatment of the convective borders . for more massive models ,",
    "the results depend on the combined effects of the description of convection and on the mass loss treatment .",
    "while the enhancement of nitrogen and aluminium appear as rather robust , the extent of magnesium and oxygen depletion are strongly model dependent , as the sodium content , which is also affected by the uncertainties in the relevant cross  sections .",
    "two main results found in the investigations by @xcite are confirmed here , independently of metallicity :    * the helium content of the ejecta increases with mass , reaching @xmath123 in the more massive models , in the sagb regime . *",
    "the models showing the most extreme chemistry are those with mass @xmath63 , at the edge between the agb and sagb regimes .",
    "this is due to the large mass loss experienced by sagbs , that loose their envelopes before a very advanced hbb nucleosynthesis is experienced .",
