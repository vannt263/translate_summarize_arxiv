    "in a large number of engineering applications of queueing theory it is pertinent to know what to expect when we replace one probability distribution function of a given stochastic model , by another probability distribution with simpler / concise properties .",
    "many of these applications are associated with the case where a probability distribution is replaced by an exponential distribution if it is known that the given distribution is close ( in a certain sense ) to the exponential distribution .",
    "these problems are closely related to characterization problems associated with the exponential distribution and its stability ( e.g. azlarov and volodin @xcite )",
    ".    continuity analysis of queueing systems is a difficult problem when compared to general characterization and continuity problems for random variables , and it is relevant to know the expected behavior of the system under a range of _ different _ conditions .",
    "the paper discusses three different conditions under which the probability distribution function of a service time , which differs slightly from the exponential distribution in the uniform metric , can be approximated by that exponential distribution .",
    "this paper considers an @xmath1 queueing system , where @xmath2 is the buffer size excluding a customer in service , @xmath3 is the rate of poisson input , @xmath4 is the probability distribution of a service time @xmath5 , and the parameter @xmath6 is the reciprocal of the expected service time .",
    "it is assumed then that the probability distribution function @xmath7 is close ( under specific cases described below ) to the exponential distribution with the same parameter @xmath6 .",
    "let @xmath8 denote the number of losses during a busy period of this queueing system .",
    "the classic explicit results for the @xmath1 queueing system , for example the recurrence relations for the expectations @xmath9 , as well as a number of results on the asymptotic behavior of @xmath9 as @xmath10 , can be found in abramov @xcite , @xcite , cooper and tilt @xcite and tomko @xcite .",
    "an application of these explicit results to asymptotic analysis of lost messages in communication networks is given in abramov @xcite , and their application to problems of optimal control of large dams is given in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "some simple stochastic inequalities for different finite buffer queueing systems are obtained in abramov @xcite , @xcite , righter @xcite , pekz _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , wolff @xcite and other papers .",
    "other relevant studies of the loss probability in finite buffer systems can be found in abramov @xcite , @xcite and choi _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "the present paper establishes continuity theorems in the form of _ stochastic inequalities _ for @xmath8 similar to the stochastic inequalities established in abramov @xcite , @xcite . the main difference between the results of this paper and those of abramov @xcite",
    ", @xcite is that the stochastic inequalities established in the present paper depend on specific properties of the service time distribution , whereas the stochastic bounds of the earlier papers @xcite , @xcite are obtained without any special assumption on that service time distribution .",
    "then the specific feature of the present paper is that the stochastic inequalities obtained can be considered as _",
    "approximation bounds _ or _ continuity bounds _ for the queueing system in the uniform metric , and these approximation bounds can have real application for stochastic systems arising in practice . the phrase _ continuity theorems _ used in this paper is associated with the traditional   @xmath11-@xmath12 language `` of mathematical analysis '' .",
    "the input characteristic of the system is assumed to have a small variation @xmath11 , and then the output characteristic has a small variation @xmath12 continuously depending on @xmath11 .",
    "both these @xmath11 and @xmath12 variations are assumed to be described by some special metrics .",
    "a large variety of metrics for the continuity analysis of complex systems can be found in dudley @xcite , kalashnikov and rachev @xcite , rachev @xcite , zolotarev @xcite and many others . in the cases where an application of the well - known traditional metrics such as the uniform metric or the levy metric becomes unavailable",
    ", very difficult or not profitable , the continuity analysis of a complex system requires to use the special type of metrics , appropriate for analysis of a given system or associated with given special conditions .",
    "the continuity analysis of queueing systems goes back to the papers of kennedy @xcite and whitt @xcite and further developed by kalashnikov @xcite , zolotarev @xcite , @xcite and gordienko and ruiz de chvez @xcite , @xcite to mention a few .",
    "the continuity analysis of such standard characteristics as _ the number of losses during a busy period _ is a very difficult problem .",
    "one of the advantages of the method in this paper , is that the continuity of this characteristic is studied in terms of the _ uniform probability metric_. as a result , the final results are simple and clear , and the conditions of the theorems are verifiable .",
    "( the uniform metric of one - dimensional distributions is usually called the kolmogorov metric . ) furthermore , under different assumptions that the service time distribution belongs to its parametric family of distributions depending on parameter @xmath13 we establish _ uniform _ estimates for the number of losses during a busy period given for all possible values @xmath13 .",
    "that is , stochastic inequalities depending only on @xmath11 but not on @xmath13 are obtained . in the case where parameter @xmath13 of this family is fixed ( specifically the case @xmath14",
    "is considered ) we establish essentially stronger estimates than these corresponding uniform estimates .    for the purpose of the continuity analysis",
    ", this paper essentially develops the level crossing approach of the earlier papers of abramov @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and some characterization theorems associated with the exponential distribution , that are then used together with the aforementioned metrical approach .",
    "we also develop the continuity theorem of azlarov and volodin @xcite under some additional conditions and use the properties of the known classes of special probability distributions such as nbu ( new better than used ) , nwu ( new worse than used ) ( e.g. stoyan @xcite for the properties of these classes of distribution and related results ) .",
    "the special parametric order relation @xmath15 , which was introduced and originally studied in abramov @xcite , is also used . for the reader",
    "s convenience all necessary facts and concepts are recalled in this paper .",
    "the main conditions for the probability distribution function @xmath7 ( @xmath16 ) of a service time under which we obtain the stochastic bounds are as follows .",
    "@xmath17 _ condition ( a)_. the probability distribution of a service time has the representation @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a probability distribution function of a nonnegative random variable having the expectation @xmath20 , and @xmath21 where @xmath22 .",
    "relation ( [ r20 ] ) says that the distance in the uniform metric between @xmath23 and @xmath24 is not greater than @xmath11 , the case @xmath25 corresponds to the equality @xmath26 for all @xmath27 . in the following",
    "we assume that @xmath28 and write the strong inequalities ( i.e. the right - hand side of ( [ r20 ] ) is less than @xmath11 ) .",
    "@xmath17 _ condition ( b)_. along with ( [ r10 ] ) and ( [ r20 ] ) it is assumed that @xmath23 belongs either to the class nbu or to the class nwu .",
    "recall that a probability distribution function @xmath29 of a nonnegative random variable is said to belong to the class nbu if for all @xmath30 , @xmath31 we have @xmath32 .",
    "( throughout the paper , for any probability distribution function @xmath29 we use the notation @xmath33 . )",
    "if the opposite inequality holds i.e. @xmath34 then @xmath29 is said to belong to the class nwu .",
    "@xmath17 _ condition ( c)_. the probability distribution function @xmath7 of a service time belongs to the class nbu , and @xmath35 where @xmath36 .",
    "@xmath17 _ condition ( d)_. let @xmath37 be a family of given probability distributions . it is assumed that there exists the probability distribution @xmath38 of this family satisfying the relation @xmath39 for all @xmath31 .    the definition and main property of the parametric order relation @xmath15 is recalled in appendix a. for a more detailed consideration see abramov @xcite .",
    "@xmath17 _ condition ( e)_. let @xmath40 be a family of given probability distributions . it is assumed that there exists the probability distribution @xmath41 of this family satisfying the relation @xmath42 for all @xmath31 .    if the family of probability distributions @xmath43 ( or @xmath44 ) is partially ordered with respect to the order relation @xmath15 , then according to zorn s lemma ( e.g. ciesielski @xcite ) @xmath45 ( or correspondingly @xmath46 ) is a minimal element of this family ( regarding this order relation @xmath15 ) .    the only difference between conditions ( d ) and ( e )",
    "is that condition ( e ) is related to the probability distribution function @xmath7 of a service time , whereas condition ( d ) is related to the associated probability distribution function @xmath23 .",
    "conditions ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) are the main conditions for our consideration , while conditions ( d ) and ( e ) are additional ( associated ) conditions . in other words",
    "one of conditions ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) are always present in our consideration .",
    "condition ( d ) can be present only with conditions ( a ) and ( b ) , and condition ( e ) can be present only with condition ( c ) .",
    "it is worth noting that in certain known cases the minimal element @xmath45 can be determined easily .",
    "for example , in the case where @xmath23 belongs to the class nwu , the minimal element of the family of probability distributions @xmath43 is @xmath47 in the sense of the order relation @xmath48 .",
    "( by replacing nwu with nbu and respectively ` minimal ' with ` maximal ' , this fact is explicitly used in theorem [ t42 ] , section 4 . )",
    "conditions ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) are three different conditions where if @xmath11 is small , then the probability distribution function @xmath7 is close to the exponential distribution in the sense of the uniform metric .",
    "therefore it is very significant to know what one can expect if conditions ( a ) , ( b ) or ( c ) are satisfied .    in most queueing problems representation ( [ r10 ] )",
    "is not standard .",
    "the standard assumption appearing in characterization problems associated with the exponential distribution is ( [ r30 ] ) ( e.g. azlarov and volodin @xcite ; cf .",
    "daley @xcite for some earlier results ) .",
    "representation of the probability distribution @xmath7 in its special form ( [ r10 ] ) matches the usual case @xmath49 ( that is the case @xmath50 ) .",
    "it is shown below ( see lemma [ l21 ] ) that assumptions ( [ r10 ] ) and ( [ r20 ] ) of condition ( a ) allow us only to prove that for all @xmath51 @xmath52 and only in the special case where @xmath14 we have @xmath53 ( see remark [ rem1 ] ) . as a result ,",
    "the approximation bounds under conditions ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) are all different , and more specifically representation ( [ r10 ] ) together with assumption ( [ r20 ] ) lead to relatively worse estimates than those in the special case @xmath49 under assumption ( [ r30 ] ) . however ( [ r1_1 ] ) is a uniform estimate for all @xmath51 , whereas ( [ r1_2 ] ) is a usual local estimate better than ( [ r1_1 ] ) . in the special case",
    "@xmath50 it is a local estimate too , which in fact is ( [ r30 ] ) .",
    "the advantage of ( [ r10 ] ) is also as follows .",
    "when the parameter @xmath13 is small , the service time distribution is close to the exponential one in the uniform metric .",
    "thus , our results are associated with a wider class of approximations and based on a two - parameter family of distributions . in practice , this can help us find a more appropriate representation and approximation for the initial probability distribution function @xmath7 given empirically .",
    "the main results of this paper establish explicit dependence of the parameter @xmath11 only and are uniform in @xmath13 .",
    "however there are examples related to the special case of @xmath14 where the bounds obtained are essentially better than in the general case of arbitrary @xmath13 . in a similar manner the case of any given @xmath13 can be considered , where the specific estimates are expected to be better than the corresponding uniform estimates .",
    "notice also that the class of stochastic inequalities is wider .",
    "on the one hand , only the parameter @xmath11 can be assumed to be small , and on the other we can assume that both @xmath11 and @xmath13 are small values .",
    "the variety of these assumptions enables us to choose the possible appropriate parameters of the model for the further approximations in order to obtain a relevant conclusion .",
    "this paper is structured into 4 sections . following this introduction ,",
    "sections 2 , 3 and 4 study the number of losses during a busy period under conditions ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) , respectively .    in section 2",
    "we give a deeper analysis of the intervals obtained under the special procedure of deleting subintervals and connecting the ends as is explained in a number of the earlier papers of the author ( see abramov @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "specifically we prove the following results .",
    "the first result of this section , lemma [ l21 ] , provides the uniform estimate ( [ r1_1 ] ) for the parametric family of distributions .",
    "remark [ rem1 ] provides local estimate ( [ r1_2 ] ) in the special case @xmath14 .",
    "the proof of both these estimates is based on the characterization theorem of azlarov and volodin @xcite , which is formulated in lemma [ l22 ] .",
    "the proof of theorem [ t24 ] is based on the level crossing approach which in its present form is originated and developed by the author ( see abramov @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .    in section 3 , under conditions ( b ) and ( d ) stronger results than those under conditions ( a ) and ( d ) are established .",
    "the results are based on similar proofs to those in section 2 .    in section 4 , under condition ( c ) the two - sides stochastic inequalities are given in theorem [ t42 ] .",
    "the proofs of the statements under condition ( c ) are completely analogous to the earlier proofs under condition ( a ) .",
