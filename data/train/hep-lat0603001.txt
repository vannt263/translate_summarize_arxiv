    "in recent years the nucleon mass has been in the focus of steadily improving lattice qcd computations .",
    "technical limitations have so far restricted lattice qcd results to quark masses larger than five times the physically relevant masses of the light quarks , @xmath2 . under such conditions , the nucleon masses produced on the lattice",
    "are considerably larger ( @xmath3 ) than the physical one .",
    "systematic extrapolations guided by well - defined rules of low - energy qcd are necessary in order to bridge this gap .",
    "several versions of such extrapolations have been developed in recent years @xcite .",
    "they differ partly in details but agree on the basics , namely on the relevance of one - loop chiral pion - nucleon dynamics in determining the dependence of @xmath4 on the pion mass @xmath5 .    the connection between @xmath5 and the @xmath6- and @xmath7-quark masses ( for which we take their average , @xmath8 ) , is given in leading order by pcac and the gell - mann  oakes  renner relation , @xmath9 , with the pion decay constant @xmath10 and the chiral condensate @xmath11 both taken at the chiral limit .",
    "accurate lattice qcd results for the pion mass as a function of the quark mass @xmath12 @xcite demonstrate that this leading linear relation between @xmath13 and @xmath12 remains remarkably stable even at large quark masses .",
    "corresponding lattice data are consistent with one - loop chiral perturbation theory at next - to - leading order , up to @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "moreover , the data continue to display the leading - order ( linear ) pcac behavior even beyond this margin , for reasons not yet understood in detail .",
    "we will therefore accept this as a fact when we later compare our theoretical @xmath15 with lattice results .    the present work updates and extends previous investigations @xcite in several respects :    * the overall consistency of parameters and low - energy constants in the expansion of @xmath15 with those extracted from pion - nucleon scattering ,",
    "is carefully examined .",
    "* the role of explicit @xmath0 degrees of freedom in the one - loop nucleon self - energy is studied .",
    "* a systematic error analysis for the extrapolation from the lattice data through the physical point down to the chiral limit is performed . *",
    "a study of finite volume effects in comparison with lattice data provides interesting additional constraints .",
    "issues of convergence when carrying chiral expansions over relatively large ranges of quark masses , will also be addressed .    the following section briefly summarizes the framework of the present approach , covariant baryon chiral perturbation theory ( b@xmath16pt ) using infrared regularization .",
    "we omit derivations of basic equations which have already been reported elsewhere @xcite .",
    "section [ sec - erranalysis ] describes the detailed error analysis of the extrapolation from lattice data down to the physical region .",
    "section [ sec - empconstr ] discusses connections with the analysis of low - energy pion - nucleon scattering .",
    "section [ deltasec ] introduces the @xmath0 as an explicit degree of freedom and examines its relevance to the chiral extrapolation of the nucleon mass .",
    "section [ sec - voldep ] investigates effects induced by varying the finite volume of the lattice , and section [ sec - voldep2 ] completes the analysis by exploring the effects of avoiding the inclusion of the physical nucleon mass as input .",
    "conclusions are drawn in section [ sec - conclusions ] .",
    "in previous work @xcite we have investigated the quark mass dependence of the nucleon mass using chiral effective field theory in the two - flavor , pion - nucleon sector .",
    "a fit has been performed to lattice data selected according to the largest available lattice volumes and smallest accessible lattice spacings , in order to be as close as possible to the infinite volume and continuum limits for which these @xmath16pt calculations are designed .",
    "we first present a brief summary of this approach .    in ref.@xcite",
    "a one - loop calculation has been performed , taking into account diagrams up to chiral order @xmath17 in covariant b@xmath16pt with infrared regularization @xcite .",
    "the following result is obtained for @xmath15 when expanded in powers of @xmath5 : @xmath18\\,m_\\pi^4 \\nonumber\\\\      & + \\frac{3 g_a^2}{256 \\pi f_\\pi^2 m_0 ^ 2 } m_\\pi^5 + { \\cal{o}}(m_\\pi^6)~~.      \\label{massp4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this formula requires the following input :    1 .   the nucleon axial vector coupling constant @xmath19 and the pion decay constant @xmath10 , both taken in the chiral @xmath20 limit . in practice",
    "we use their physical values , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , for guidance and examine variations around these values ; 2 .   the nucleon mass in the chiral limit , @xmath23 ; 3 .",
    "the low - energy constants @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath1 . here",
    "@xmath24 is closely linked to the pion - nucleon sigma term , while @xmath26 encode information primarily on the @xmath0 excitation in p - wave pion - nucleon scattering ; 4 .",
    "a parameter @xmath27 , combining three different couplings of the most general @xmath28 b@xmath16pt lagrangian ( see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "@xmath27 represents unresolved short distance dynamics .",
    "this term compensates the logarithmic dependence on the renormalization scale @xmath29 so as to ensure scale independence of the result .",
    "the present work builds upon a successful fit of eq.([massp4 ] ) to unquenched two - flavor lattice results , referred to as `` fit ii '' in ref.@xcite .",
    "the input lattice data with improved wilson fermions ( points 19 , 41 , 8 and 23 in ref.@xcite and table  [ tab - latticedat ] ) are chosen according to the following criteria : small lattice spacing , @xmath30 , and large spatial lattice size , @xmath31 .",
    "we have considered only the smallest available pion masses , @xmath32 . in order to avoid an under - determined fit we fix some parameters . in particular , @xmath24 is eliminated by substituting the empirical nucleon mass into eq.([massp4 ] ) at the physical value of the pion mass , @xmath25 is set equal to @xmath33 as determined in @xcite , and @xmath1 is fixed at @xmath34 , according to the @xmath35 phase shift analysis in ref.@xcite . employing the physical values @xmath22 , @xmath21 , only two parameters remain free : @xmath23 and @xmath27 ( we chose a renormalization scale @xmath36 throughout this work ) .    in eq.([massp4 ] ) we have truncated the @xmath28 infrared regularized expression at @xmath37 in order to avoid further unconstrained counter terms , cf .",
    "we note that the truncation of @xmath38 at @xmath39 coincides with the @xmath40 result in heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory ( hb@xmath16pt ) , see ref.@xcite .",
    "we stress that in the context of baryon @xmath16pt with infrared regularization , recoil corrections are part of the same order in the corresponding perturbative , diagrammatic expansion .",
    "manifestly covariant and non - relativistic methods just lead to a different organization of the perturbation theory .",
    "we have checked that fits based on the hb@xmath16pt @xmath28 expression give results that are compatible with the analysis presented here .",
    "thus the term proportional to @xmath37 in eq.([massp4 ] ) , _ i.e. _ the leading recoil correction to the non - relativistic result , plays no significant numerical role . the application of chiral perturbation theory to interpolations spanning a rather large interval of quark masses has always been a point of concern . in the next section",
    "we examine the degree of convergence as the calculation of the nucleon mass evolves order by order in the chiral expansion . in preparation of this study",
    "we first recall further basic results discussed in ref.@xcite . at chiral order @xmath41",
    ", we have @xmath42 and the one - loop expression at @xmath43 using infrared regularization , expanded in powers of @xmath5 , is    @xmath44\\,m_\\pi^4 \\nonumber\\\\      & + \\frac{3 g_a^2}{256 \\pi f_\\pi^2 m_0 ^ 2 } m_\\pi^5 + { \\cal{o}}(m_\\pi^6)~~.      \\label{massp3 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here , @xmath45 absorbs the @xmath29-dependence at @xmath39 , which differs from that of @xmath27 in eq.([massp4 ] ) .",
    "in this section a systematic error analysis is performed in order to test the reliability of the interpolation between lattice results and the physical nucleon mass based on eq.([massp4 ] ) .",
    "we are confronted with uncertainties from two different sources of errors , namely _",
    "input uncertainties _ and _ theoretical uncertainties _ , which need to be distinguished throughout the analysis because they require different treatments .",
    "input uncertainties result from statistical errors of lattice calculations and from limited empirical information on low - energy constants .",
    "theoretical uncertainties come from two sources : first , they arise because our fit function derives from a perturbative expansion and is therefore subject to corrections of higher order .",
    "secondly , we are dealing with an effective field theory , which has a limited range of applicability .",
    "our analysis is performed in two steps .",
    "first , we compare different orders in the perturbative expansion of @xmath15 focusing only on pion masses up to @xmath46 . this range is consistent with the conclusions drawn in ref.@xcite . in a second step",
    "we treat input uncertainties .    .",
    "shown is the best fit interpolation between lattice results and the physical point ( star ) , performed at chiral order @xmath17 using eq.([massp4 ] ) ( solid curve ) , with input given in column ( a ) of table  [ tab - paramsb ] .",
    "the physical point is included .",
    "the lattice data points in the grey region have not been used as input . also shown",
    "are intermediate steps at orders @xmath41 and @xmath47 according to eqs.([massp2]),([massp3 ] ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath45 has been fitted to lattice data . ]    using @xmath24 and @xmath23 as given by the @xmath38 best fit in table [ tab - paramsb ] , we display , in fig.[fig - conv ] , @xmath48 and examine @xmath49 of eq.([massp3 ] )",
    ". the pattern of successive steps is certainly promising for @xmath50 .",
    "note that the parameter @xmath45 in @xmath49 and @xmath27 in @xmath38 have different @xmath29-dependence .",
    "in contrast to ref.@xcite , we do not identify the two parameters at a specific scale .",
    "instead @xmath45 is fitted to lattice data , yielding @xmath51 , a naturally sized value for that coupling .",
    "a more stringent test of convergence would have to involve an estimate of corrections from @xmath52 .",
    "then , however , the number of poorly constrained parameters would become prohibitively large . in the present work a consistency check of the low - energy constants required by the fit to the nucleon mass in comparison with the same constants deduced from the analysis of pion - nucleon scattering data",
    "provides a non - trivial test that will be performed in section [ sec - empconstr ] .",
    "let us now study the numerical impact of input uncertainties for eq.([massp4 ] ) .",
    "the relevant technical details are summarized in appendix  [ sec - detailserror ] .",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath1 is substantial but difficult to quantify . for the moment",
    ", we ignore uncertainties in @xmath25 and @xmath1 and defer this part of the discussion to sections [ sec - empconstr ] and [ sec - voldep ] . to start with , @xmath19 and @xmath10 are set equal to their values at the physical point .",
    "fitting with this setup has led to the results of `` fit ii '' in @xcite .",
    "we now also take into account uncertainties in extracting the lattice pion mass , see appendix [ sec - errpionmass ] .",
    "they turn out to have little effect .",
    "the resulting parameter values are listed in column ( a ) of table  [ tab - paramsb ] .",
    "the global error band for the pion mass dependence of the nucleon mass is the `` statistical band '' displayed in fig.[fig - band ] .",
    "the values of @xmath19 and @xmath10 , to be taken in the chiral limit , are expected to differ slightly from the values at the physical point .",
    "we assume to find these values in the intervals @xmath53 the range for @xmath19 is taken from @xcite .",
    "for the lower boundary of @xmath10 , we take the estimate from an analysis of the pion mass dependence of @xmath10 in ref.@xcite .",
    "varying @xmath19 and @xmath10 within these intervals extends the error band to what is labeled `` systematic envelope '' in fig.[fig - band ] ( see appendix [ sec - detailserror ] ) .",
