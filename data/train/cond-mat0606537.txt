    "elemental lithium , with superconducting t@xmath5 15 k around@xcite 30 gpa and up to 20 k in strained samples@xcite at 50 gpa , joins mgb@xmath6 ( t@xmath0=40 k ) , metallic y ( t@xmath0=20 k)@xcite , and pucoga@xmath7 ( t@xmath0=19 k)@xcite as the big surprises in critical temperature in this century . transformation from a simple nearly - free - electron metal not superconducting@xcite above 100 @xmath8k to a strongly coupled electron - phonon superconductor at 20 - 50 gpa has been explained , at least semiquantitatively , in recent work by profeta _",
    "et al._@xcite and by kasinathan _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "the evolution of t@xmath9 has been linked to the increase in electron - phonon coupling of specific phonon branches along intersections of kohn anomaly surfaces with pressure .",
    "the coupling strength is quite strongly dependent on the phonon wave vector @xmath10 and phonon polarization . in particular",
    ", the @xmath11 polarized phonon along the ( 110 ) @xmath12-k direction softens with increasing pressure and finally becomes unstable .",
    "the nesting function @xmath13 which describes the phase space for the electron - hole scattering processes across the fermi surface has fine structure@xcite requiring a very dense mesh to obtain accurate values where its amplitude is large .",
    "since the electron - phonon ( ep ) coupling involves these same scattering events weighted by ep matrix elements that normally vary smoothly with q , the fine structure in @xmath13 implies corresponding fine structure in ep coupling ( as contained for example in the ep contribution to the phonon linewidths @xmath14 ) .",
    "such fine structure makes the sampling of the brillouin zone an issue if accurate numerical results for @xmath3 are desired .",
    "our previous linear response phonon calculations @xcite were performed on 12@xmath2 mesh ( 72 @xmath10 points in the irreducible zone ) . in the present work ,",
    "we focus on the 20 gpa case ( fcc lattice constant a@xmath15 = 6.80 bohr ) where strong phonon softening arises but structural instability has not yet occurred .",
    "the phonon energies and the eliashberg spectral function constants have been presently calculated on a much finer 24@xmath2 mesh ( 413 @xmath10 points in the irreducible zone ) .",
    "careful examination of the results lead to a revised picture of what coupling is important for t@xmath0 ( as opposed to what is important in increasing @xmath1 , which is a far simpler question ) .",
    "the electronic wave functions are calculated using a full potential linear muffin tin orbital ( fp lmto ) method as implemented by savrasov @xcite .",
    "we have used the vosko - wilk - nusair local exchange - correlation @xcite .",
    "the phonon energies and the coupling constants have been calculated using linear response theory @xcite .",
    "phonons were calculated for a dense 24@xmath2 mesh corresponding to 413 inequivalent @xmath10 points in the irreducible zone .",
    "the electronic bz zone integration was performed with a 40@xmath2 k point grid .",
    "the calculated phonon dispersion curves are displayed in fig . [ phonons ] .",
    "the only noticeable softening is seen midway along the @xmath12-l direction ( transverse @xmath16 branches ) , for the @xmath11 polarized @xmath4 branch along the @xmath12-k direction emphasized previously,@xcite and possibly softening in the @xmath16 branches around the x point .",
    "we had identified previously that the @xmath10 = @xmath17 @xmath4 phonon ( near k ) causes large band shifts with atomic displacement ( @xmath18 5 ev /  ) near the fs necks , reflecting strong ep coupling .",
    "the corresponding ` mode @xmath1 ' values @xmath19 are presented in fig .",
    "[ modelambda ] .",
    "the @xmath19 values for the @xmath4 branch near k , and also near the midpoint of the @xmath12-l line are larger compared to other areas in the bz , as expected from the phonon kinks . in addition , we notice that the @xmath19 values for all the three branches are large all along @xmath12-x ; this coupling is not immediately obvious from the phonon dispersion in fig .",
    "[ phonons ] because it depends only weakly on q. +    in fig .",
    "[ linewidth ] , we display the corresponding linewidths @xmath14 , which are given by@xcite @xmath20}|^2    \\delta(\\varepsilon_k)\\delta(\\varepsilon_{k+q}).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] while @xmath14 includes the same q - specific fermi surface average of the ep matrix elements with respect to the available phase space for scattering through wavevector q as does @xmath21 , it is proportional to @xmath22 rather than inversely proportional . as a result",
    ", @xmath14 is a much better indicator of the importance of the coupling for t@xmath0 . coupling at high frequency is much more important than at low frequency for t@xmath0 , whereas the opposite is true for @xmath1 .",
    "thus it is not surprising that the linewidth ` dispersion ' in fig .",
    "[ linewidth ] provides a different viewpoint than does the @xmath21 dispersion .",
    "there is still the large contribution from the region around k where there is an incipient instability , but it is very limited in q and very sharply structured , not being resolved even by the q mesh we have used .",
    "the really impressive region however is the @xmath23 branch along ( 100 ) directions , which dominates the landscape ( at least along symmetry lines ) .",
    "there are also important contributions from the @xmath23 branch along the @xmath12-k lines and from the @xmath16 branches along ( 100 ) .",
    "even the small peak in the @xmath16 branches midway between @xmath12 and l ( where the kink in the @xmath16 branch occurs ) is small compared to the contribution from the @xmath23 branch along the same line .",
    "present @xmath24 at v / v@xmath15 = 0.45 gpa ( @xmath25 50 gpa ) which have some features @xcite in common with fig .",
    "[ linewidth ] , but can not be compared in detail because of the different volumes .",
    "the phonon frequency distribution @xmath26 is shown in fig .",
    "[ phonondoscomp ] where it is clear that the coarser q mesh had given a good picture of the density of states .",
    "this insensitivity does not persist when coupling is included .",
    "the eliashberg spectral function @xmath27 from both meshes is plotted in fig .",
    "[ spectralfncomp ] . for this 20 gpa case",
    "a large broad peak dominates the 15 - 35 mev range , with less intense coupling extending on up to 70 mev .",
    "compared to its value from the coarser mesh , it is much smaller in the 7 - 20 mev range .",
    "the intensity in the low frequency region is clearly from the transverse branch phonons , while the less impressive ( but still substantial ) intensity in the high frequency region is from the longitudinal phonon branch .",
    "the frequency resolved coupling strength @xmath28 , also shown in fig .",
    "[ spectralfncomp ] is dramatically changed by using the finer q mesh .",
    "there is now a broad peak around 12 mev , still indicative of comparatively stronger coupling in the low frequency regime .",
    "however , the overriding peak in the 7 - 16 mev range has disappeared , showing that is was an artifact of the sampling of the volume near the point k using only a 12@xmath2 mesh .",
    "this feature is reminiscent of results calculated by yin _",
    "et al . _ , @xcite who have found an even narrower peak in @xmath29 growing at lower frequencies ( 2 - 5 mev ) in elemental y under pressure .",
    "this peak also was traced to incipient instability for a transverse branch near the zone boundary .",
    "we now concentrate on the difference in t@xmath0 , and the interpretation of the distribution of the coupling , that we obtain from our denser q mesh of data ( we note that the quantities we discuss are still not fully converged ) .",
    "the results of this much better zone sampling are displayed in table [ table ] .",
    "startlingly , the value of @xmath1 has dropped from 3.1 to 1.0 , ( which was also obtained by profeta _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) reflecting the fact that the low energy region of @xmath3 was ( and still is ) reliant on large contributions ( from near k and perhaps elsewhere ) that vary sharply with q. for the determination of t@xmath0 , the strong reduction in @xmath1 is considerably compensated by increases in the frequency moments .",
    "the logarithmic moment @xmath30 _ increases _ by a factor of 2.7 , and the second moment by 40% . at a similar volume , shi and papaconstantopoulos @xcite",
    "obtain @xmath1 = 0.5 from rigid muffin tin calculations .",
    "one source of difference is the value @xmath31 325 k ( scaled from the p = 0 debye frequency which is our calculated value of @xmath32 .",
    ".from the calculated @xmath33 at 20 gpa for both @xmath10 meshes , this table provides : the logarithmic , first , and second moments of the frequency ; the value of @xmath1 ; t@xmath0 ( k ) calculated using @xmath34=0.13 and @xmath34=0.20 ; and two simple measures of @xmath3 ( see text ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table ]    we have obtained t@xmath9 using the allen - dynes equation@xcite @xmath35 where @xmath36 are strong coupling corrections that depend on @xmath1 , @xmath34 , and the ratio @xmath37 , which is a measure of the shape of @xmath3 .",
    "these @xmath38 factors are important for @xmath1=3.1 but have little effect for @xmath391 or less . for the commonly used value of @xmath34=0.13 ,",
    "our more nearly converged results give t@xmath0=13 k vs. the earlier estimate of 20 k , only a 35% drop even though @xmath1 decreases by more than a factor of three . for @xmath34=0.20 , t@xmath0 = 3.4 k. these values should be compared with the nearly hydrostatic value t@xmath0 = 6 k at 20 gpa found by deemyad and schilling.@xcite",
    "this apparent weak dependence of t@xmath0 on @xmath1 reflects the observation , made several times in the past,@xcite that , for providing an estimate of t@xmath0 with averages of @xmath3 , the combination of @xmath1 and some frequency moment separately is not the best choice .",
    "this observation is connected with the observation that coupling at low frequency , which strongly enhances @xmath1 , has only a weak effect on t@xmath0 .",
    "carbotte and collaborators@xcite argued that the product @xmath40 ( with @xmath41 being the first moment as defined by allen and dynes@xcite ) is nearly proportional to t@xmath0 for 1.2@xmath42 2.4 ; this quantity is proportional to the area under @xmath3 and corresponds to a zone integral of @xmath43 .",
    "they were not including strong coupling corrections to t@xmath0,@xcite however , which were unknown at the time of the original work .",
    "the strong - coupling limit@xcite gives t@xmath44 @xmath45 ; this product @xmath46 corresponds to a zone integral of @xmath14 .",
    "we find that , for the fine mesh compared to the coarse ( see the table ) : @xmath1 decreases by @xmath47% ; t@xmath0 drops by 35% ( at @xmath34=0.13 ) ; the carbotte product decreases by 30% ; the strong - coupling limit factor drops by only 5% .",
    "hence the carbotte ratio follows the change in t@xmath0 best , of these choices .",
    "the behavior of @xmath48 does not faithfully represent the relative importance of modes for t@xmath0 except in the weak - coupling limit . in the strong coupling limit ( which we do _ not _",
    "claim is the case for li ) it is @xmath14 that gives the better picture . for another perspective we display in fig .",
    "[ isogamma ] an isosurface of @xmath14 for the @xmath23 modes . as expected from fig .",
    "[ linewidth ] , it is dominated by contributions near the center of the ( 100 ) line .",
    "the isocontours form a blunt jack - like shape although the true symmetry is only four - fold .",
    "our corresponding plots for @xmath21 are almost like those of profeta _",
    "et al._@xcite except that we seem to find somewhat larger contributions near the zone center .    in this paper",
    "we have clarified and supported our earlier suggestion@xcite that denser zone sampling would be necessary to obtain accurate numerical results .",
    "we find in addition that careful sampling of the fine structure in the coupling is required even for obtaining a correct understanding of the microscopic origin of the pressure - induced increase in t@xmath0 .",
    "in particular , we call into question the view ( easily surmised from the earlier work@xcite even if not so claimed ) that the impressive value of t@xmath0 in li under pressure arises either from soft phonons near k , or from a box - like set of regions in momenta along ( @xmath49 ) with @xmath50 . these questions , and the strong polarization dependence of matrix elements , will be addressed in further work .",
