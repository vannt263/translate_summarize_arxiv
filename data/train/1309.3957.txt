    "the * persistence conjecture *  @xcite asserts that so long as the reaction network is _ weakly - reversible _  ( definition  [ def : rnprop ] ) , this can not happen .",
    "this conjecture has a history going back to 1974  @xcite .",
    "it remains open , even when all reactions are reversible , _ even for as few as @xmath16 species _ !",
    "the @xmath17 species case was settled only very recently  @xcite .",
    "the notion of * critical siphon *  @xcite provides a powerful and easy combinatorial way of proving persistence for a certain subclass of networks .",
    "the idea is that the existence of a trajectory violating persistence has certain combinatorial implications , i.e. , the existence of critical siphons .",
    "conversely , the absence of critical siphons  which can be combinatorially checked  has dynamical implications , i.e. , persistence .",
    "for example , consider the following network in the species @xmath0 and @xmath1 with reactions given by @xmath18 this is persistent .",
    "the idea is that if @xmath0 were ever at zero concentration , it would be produced from nothing , and similarly for @xmath1 .",
    "only the first reaction @xmath19 matters for this analysis .",
    "the other reactions can be replaced arbitrarily , and so long as they remain reversible , we can prove persistence .",
    "the notion of _ siphon _ helps to make this idea into a proof .",
    "a siphon is a set of species that , once absent , remain absent .",
    "it turns out that reaction networks without siphons are persistent .",
    "another example is @xmath20 . here",
    "if @xmath0 and @xmath1 are both absent , they remain absent , so @xmath21 is a siphon .",
    "however , there is a conservation law : @xmath22 is time - invariant , because whenever an @xmath0 is destroyed , a @xmath1 is created , and vice versa .",
    "therefore , if the initial conditions are @xmath23 then the point @xmath24 where both @xmath0 and @xmath1 are absent is unreachable .",
    "the idea is that if there is a positive conservation law whose support is contained in a siphon then that siphon can not be drained .",
    "hence , among siphons , the challenge to persistence comes only from _",
    "critical _ siphons , i.e. , siphons that do not contain the support of a positive conservation law . the example with reactions @xmath25 and @xmath26 has the critical siphon @xmath21 .",
    "so , though it is persistent , showing this requires a different argument that proceeds by exhibiting a lyapunov function  @xcite .",
    "a different approach to the persistence conjecture is to try to identify a subclass of weakly - reversible systems which are somehow _ physical _ , and exploit this extra structure to obtain a proof for the persistence conjecture . this program was initiated in @xcite and @xcite , where the notion of systems where every species is made up of _ atoms _ in a unique way was made precise , and it was shown that atomic systems have no critical siphons , and hence are persistent .",
    "later , in @xcite , this result was extended to all _ saturated _ or non - catalytic systems , a larger class of systems properly containing the atomic systems .",
    "the biological motivation for our work comes from synthetic biology , specifically from the dna molecular programming community  @xcite , where reaction networks are being viewed as programming languages for the synthesis of desired behaviour .",
    "one would like to have a programming language that is natural with respect to chemical reaction dynamics , so that there are meaningful ways to separately test , and then compose , different subsystems .",
    "the petri net view of reaction networks makes a connection with process algebras , and connects to work on concurrent programming languages .",
    "our work may be viewed as setting down a mathematical bridge between these two different areas , by making explicit the combinatorial foundations of reaction network notions like catalysis , self - replication , and persistence .",
    "we hope to exploit these connections more in future to describe ways of programming chemical reaction networks that will take advantage of advances in concurrent programming language design .",
    "our contributions in this paper are the following :    we give an explicit combinatorial characterization of the minimal critical siphons .",
    "specifically , we introduce the notions of * drainable * and * self - replicable * sets in definition  [ def : siphon ] , and prove in theorem  [ minimal - siphon ] that every minimal critical siphon is either drainable or self - replicable .",
    "conjecture  1 from @xcite asserted a link between a certain notion of autocatalysis and critical siphons .",
    "we provide a counterexample  ( example  [ ex : counter ] ) to this conjecture .",
    "our notion of self - replicable siphons captures a more nuanced notion of autocatalysis . with this notion ,",
    "we show in the spirit of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* conjecture  1 ) that the weakly - reversible networks that have critical siphons are precisely the autocatalytic systems  ( theorem  [ minimal - siphon ] ) . in particular , all non - autocatalytic ( i.e. , without self - replicable siphons ) weakly - reversible networks are persistent . as a special case , in section  [ sec : catalysis ]",
    "we obtain a combinatorial proof for the persistence of non - catalytic networks , the main result in @xcite which was originally proved using algebraic geometric methods .",
    "angeli et al .",
    "@xcite have shown that conservative reaction networks without critical siphons are persistent .",
    "we show that reaction networks without drainable siphons are persistent  ( theorem  [ thm : persistence ] ) . since networks with drainable siphons are a proper subclass of networks with critical siphons  ( theorem  [ minimal - siphon ] ) , our result sharpens angeli s result , and brings out that the obstruction to proving the persistence conjecture comes from a competition between the drainable and self - replicable natures of a siphon  ( remark  [ rmk : compete ] ) .    in section  [ sec : dm ] , towards proving theorem  [ minimal - siphon ] , we prove the convex rank - nullity theorem ( theorem  [ rank - nullity ] ) , a trichotomy result for matrices that have a sign pattern with all diagonal terms are negative , and all off - diagonal terms positive .",
    "though this result is very suggestive of farkas lemma and its variants , to our best knowledge it has neither appeared before , nor is it an immediate corollary of farkas lemma  ( remark  [ rmk : notfarkas ] ) .",
    "all our results are in the setting of _ positive _ reaction networks ( definition  [ def : rn ] ) .",
    "this means our results hold for reactions like @xmath27 with fractional stoichiometric coefficients .",
    "we introduce the notion of a _",

    "the species @xmath0 is not a siphon because of the second reaction . the sets @xmath136 and @xmath21 are not critical because of the conservation law @xmath48 .",
    "a reaction network admits various choices for dynamics whose appropriateness depends on the context of the application .",
    "we briefly describe some of the possible choices .    _ mass - action kinetics _",
    "@xcite prescribes a way for going from a reaction network and a collection of reaction `` specific rates '' to a system of ordinary differential equations .",
    "the variables of this ode system are concentrations of the reaction species as functions of time , and the right - hand sides are polynomials in these variables . many of the mathematical results about chemical reaction networks have been proved in the setting of mass - action kinetics .",
    "such models also appear in the study of power - law systems and s - systems from biochemical systems theory  @xcite .",
    "quadratic dynamical systems  @xcite studied in computer science to model genetic algorithms are mathematically cognate to bimolecular mass - action systems .",
    "many models in population biology like predator - prey systems  @xcite are described as mass - action systems .",
    "the _ chemical master equation _ describes the evolution of species populations as a continuous - time markov process , given a `` specific propensity '' for each reaction .",
    "it is a physically more accurate choice for dynamics than mass - action kinetics , since it also takes into account stochastic effects .",
    "it is especially relevant when modeling reactions where the species population sizes are small , and the stochastic effects can cause a significant deviation from mass - action behavior .",
    "a common choice of dynamics in the computer science community , especially in the study of petri nets , is _ non - deterministic dynamics_. the key question here is that of `` reachability : '' whether there is a path to go from one population vector to another , by applying the reactions in any sequence .    in practice ,",
    "the rates and propensities of reactions are often not easily obtainable by experiment .",
    "indeed , they may not even be constants , but may vary in time , or across assays .",
    "this can be captured by _ mass - action differential inclusions _",
    "@xcite , where the reaction rates simultaneously take all values in a fixed interval bounded away from @xmath252 and @xmath340 .",
    "the assumption of mass - action can be relaxed to allow other functional forms for the right - hand sides of the odes .",
    "many of the results first proved in the setting of mass - action can be extended to these more general dynamical systems  @xcite .",
    "stochastic and deterministic _ reaction - diffusion _ systems combine spatial effects of diffusion with some local dynamical model of the progress of reactions .",
    "they are relevant in settings where the assumption that the reactants are well - mixed no longer holds .",
    "reaction networks have been studied in chemistry for a long time  @xcite , but they have also been studied beyond chemistry . in 1962 , carl petri  @xcite applied reaction networks to the study of distributed processes in computer science , and they have come to be known in this area as `` petri nets . '' kauffman  @xcite has conjectured a key role for autocatalytic reaction networks in the origin of life .    in recent times , advances in systems and synthetic biology and molecular computation have given a new impetus to the study of reaction networks .",
    "it is now commonplace wisdom in biology that the sophisticated behavior of living systems emerges from the dynamics of their reaction networks . as high - throughput techniques uncover more details about these biochemical reaction networks , the questions of inference and control of dynamical properties of the system from this combinatorial data",
    "becomes more compelling .",
    "such efforts are already underway in the areas of flux balance analysis  @xcite , and biochemical systems theory  @xcite .",
    "it is hoped that a deep mathematical understanding of reaction networks would aid such efforts .    in the area of molecular computation ,",
    "researchers have engineered proof - of - principle molecular circuits that synthesize sophisticated behavior  @xcite .",
    "interesting applications would result if these constructions could be scaled economically by two orders of magnitude .",
    "one problem with attempts at scaling has been `` retroactivity : '' composition of two reaction networks leads to changes in the behavior of each network  @xcite , so that the gestalt dynamics does not have the targeted behavior . to obtain a good compositional scheme for reaction networks",
    ", it may be helpful to investigate whether there are mathematically - natural ways for reaction networks to be composed , and decomposed .",
    "the persistence conjecture  @xcite is a good candidate problem for gauging progress in our understanding of the dynamics of reaction networks . in recent times",
    ", there has been a resurgence of interest in this conjecture  @xcite , and in critical siphons  @xcite .",
    "autocatalysis almost certainly plays a central role in the complexity and self - organization exhibited by living systems , and possibly also played a role in the origin of life  @xcite .",
    "autocatalysis is also a feature of synthetic dna molecular circuits that perform signal amplification  @xcite  signal amplification is essential for the scaling of molecular circuit constructions",
    ".    our notion of `` self - replicable siphons '' may be relevant in the context of kauffman s program  @xcite of explaining the origin of life using _ autocatalytic sets of reactions_. autocatalytic sets of reactions have been studied extensively  @xcite .",
    "the notion of self - replicable siphons  ( definition  [ def : sr ] ) appears to be cognate with the idea of autocatalytic sets , and has a certain mathematical naturalness to it .",
