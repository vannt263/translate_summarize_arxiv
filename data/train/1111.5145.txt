    "using methods from stochastic geometry and spatial statistics , a stochastic model is developed which describes the 3d nanomorphology of composite materials , being blends of two different ( organic and inorganic ) solid phases .",
    "such materials are used , for example , in photoactive layers of hybrid polymer zinc oxide ( zno ) solar cells where the two solid phases play the role of a polymeric electron donor , consisting of , for example , poly(3-hexylthiophene ) , and an inorganic zno - electron acceptor , respectively .",
    "there is a great advantage of polymer solar cells due to their potentially low production costs , in comparison with classical silicon solar cells .",
    "however , the efficiency of polymer solar cells critically depends on the intimacy of mixing of the donor and acceptor semiconductors used in these devices to create charges as well as on the presence of unhindered percolation pathways in the individual solid phases of the composite material to transport positive and negative charges toward electrodes ; see , for example , @xcite .",
    "it is therefore very important to have tools at one s disposal which are suitable to analyze and model the 3d morphology of these materials quantitatively .",
    "so far , no such tools are available in literature due to the fact that imaging of the 3d morphology in high resolution is a difficult task . the first 3d images of photoactive layers in polymer solar cells , gained by means of electron tomography ( et ) , have been published only recently ; see @xcite and @xcite .    in the present paper ,",
    "such 3d images are used to fit our model to real data .",
    "the model then helps to get a better insight into the impact of morphology on the performance of polymer solar cells and , simultaneously , it can be used for virtual scenario analyses , where model - based morphologies of solar cells are simulated to identify polymer solar cells with improved nanostructures .    the model developed in this paper",
    "is based on methods from stochastic geometry and spatial statistics ; see @xcite and @xcite for comprehensive surveys on recent results in these fields . in particular , stationary marked point processes are considered as models for complex point patterns extracted from et images , where the points are associated with additional information , so - called `` marks . ''",
    "note that point processes in 3d have been used for many years to analyze geometrically complex point patterns ; see , for example , @xcite .",
    "more recently , further case studies in 3d point process modeling have been performed , for example , in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ; see also @xcite . besides , there are many monographs dealing with point processes in multidimensional spaces and their statistical inference and simulation .",
    "we refer , for instance , to @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , as well as @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec.pre.lim ] briefly describes the considered solar cells and the corresponding image data on which the model is based . in particular , in section  [ sec.multi-scale ] , the main ideas of a multi - scale approach to the segmentation of 3d images are summarized , which has been developed recently in @xcite .",
    "the crucial step of this approach is to find an efficient representation of the binarized and morphologically smoothed images by unions of overlapping spheres .",
    "then , in section  [ sec.simulationmodel ] , the spatial stochastic model for the zno phase is introduced , separately for morphologically smoothed zno domains ( macro - scale ) and for those parts representing the difference between the smoothed and nonsmoothed binary images ( micro - scale ) . based on unions of overlapping spheres representing the zno domains ,",
    "that is , marked point patterns extracted from et images , a stochastic model is built for the smoothed 3d morphology ( macro - scale ) of the photoactive layers considered in this paper . since a strong correlation of midpoints of spheres in @xmath0-direction",
    "is observed , we propose a multi - layer approach considering sequences of correlated 2d point processes to model the 3d point patterns of midpoints .",
    "the members of these sequences belong to a suitably chosen class of planar poisson cluster processes , being parallel to the @xmath1@xmath2-plane .",
    "in particular , a generalized version of matrn cluster processes is considered , where the cluster points are scattered in uniformly oriented ellipses around their cluster centers ( section  [ sec.mod.sli ] ) . to model the 3d point patterns of midpoints , a markov chain with stationary initial distribution is constructed , which consists of highly correlated matrn cluster processes ( section  [ sec.spa.bir ] ) .",
    "it can be seen as a stationary point process in 3d , where the radii of spheres are considered as marks of this point process ( section  [ sec.sim.rad ] ) .",
    "subsequently , a spatial stochastic model for the micro - scale part of the morphological structure is developed ( section  [ sec.simulationmodelmicro ] ) .",
    "it is used to invert morphological smoothing and completes our model for the 3d morphology of hybrid polymer - zno solar cells .",
    "furthermore , a method to fit model parameters to real image data is proposed.=-1    section  [ sec.mod.val ] deals with model validation . to evaluate the goodness of fit",
    ", we compare model characteristics which have been computed from real and simulated data , respectively , like the volume fractions of voxels contributing to monotonous percolation pathways through the photoactive layer , the distribution of spherical contact distances , and the probabilities of exciton quenching .",
    "these characteristics have already been considered in @xcite , since they are strongly related with the performance of solar cells .",
    "finally , section  [ sec.con.out ] concludes and provides a short outlook regarding possible future research .",
    "in this section some necessary background information regarding the functionality of polymer solar cells is provided , together with corresponding image data on which the model is based .",
    "we consider photoactive layers of hybrid polymer zinc oxide ( zno ) solar cells where the two solid phases play the role of a  polymeric electron donor , consisting of , for example , poly(3-hexylthiophene ) , and an inorganic zno - electron acceptor , respectively . upon exposure to light ,",
    "photons are absorbed in the polymer phase and so - called `` excitons , '' that is , photoexcited electron ",
    "hole pairs , evolve .",
    "excitons are neutral quasi - particles which diffuse inside the polymer phase within a limited lifetime ; see @xcite . if an exciton reaches the interface to the zno phase , it is split up into a free electron ( negative charge ) in the zno and a hole ( positive charge ) in the polymer phase .",
    "this process is commonly referred to as quenching , because it reduces the intrinsic fluorescent decay of the exciton in the polymer .",
    "provided that the electrons in the zno phase and the holes in the polymer phase reach the electrodes at the top and bottom of the photoactive layer , respectively , photocurrent is generated .",
    "a schematic illustration of the morphology of photoactive layers in hybrid polymer - zno solar cells is shown in figure  [ fig.schematicview ] , where the electrodes are supposed to be parallel to the @xmath1@xmath2-plane .",
    "for further information about polymer solar cells and the physical processes therein we refer , for example , to @xcite .    ) and electrons ( @xmath3 ) . ]",
    "note that the extent of blending of the two materials has a large impact on the efficiency of these solar cells , because not all excitons are quenched due to their limited lifetimes .",
    "thus , a morphology as displayed in figure  [ fig.schematicview ] , where both materials are mixed intimately , is desirable since the excitons are likely to reach the interface and charges can be generated .",
    "in other words , for a morphology which would be ideal with respect to this aspect of functionality , each location of the polymer phase should have a distance to the zno phase that is smaller than the diffusion length of excitons .",
    "for each location within the polymer phase , the fraction of excitons reaching the interface is called the quenching probability at this location .",
    "the mean of these quenching probabilities , that is , the quenching probability at a randomly chosen location of the polymer phase , is called the quenching efficiency .    furthermore , the existence of unhindered percolation pathways within both phases , zno and polymer , is crucial since the generated charges have to be transported to the electrodes throughout the phases .",
    "because of the electric field between the electrodes , these pathways should be preferably monotonous .",
    "hence , to obtain solar cells with high efficiency , an intimately mixed morphology with monotonous percolation pathways for both charge carriers is desirable and should be taken into account when producing devices .",
    "the stochastic model developed in the present paper will be used to identify morphologies with improved efficiency by generating virtual morphologies and investigating the transport processes of electrons and excitons , respectively .",
    "this will be the subject of a forthcoming paper .",
    "the image data have been gained by electron tomography ( et ) ; see @xcite and @xcite . in particular , we consider images for three devices with different thicknesses of the photoactive layers : 57  nm , 100  nm and 167  nm .",
    "for each of the three thicknesses , the 3d et images are given as stacks of 2d grayscale images ( being parallel to the @xmath1@xmath2-plane , say ) , which are numbered according to their location in @xmath0-direction .",
    "the sizes of these images in the @xmath1@xmath2-plane are @xmath4 voxels for the 57  nm film , and @xmath5 voxels for the other two thicknesses .",
    "each voxel represents a cube with side length of 0.71  nm .",
    "figure  [ fig.raw_data_slices ] shows representative 2d slices for the three film thicknesses , where the darker parts of the images represent the zno phase due to a higher electron density compared to polymer .",
    "the images displayed in figure  [ fig.raw_data_slices ] indicate clear structural differences for the three films .",
    "with increasing layer thickness , the separated domains of polymer and zno are getting finer .",
    "in particular , the thinnest film , that is , the photoactive layer with thickness of 57  nm , features large domains of both polymer and zno .",
    "the stochastic 3d model to be fitted takes these morphological differences into account .",
    "more precisely , the model type will be the same for all three layer thicknesses .",
    "only the values of some model parameters will be different for the varying morphologies ; see section  [ sec.simulationmodel ] below .    to develop a stochastic model for the 3d morphology of hybrid polymer - zno solar cells ,",
    "the 3d et grayscale images have to be binarized appropriately .",
    "binarization is necessary since we need to decide which voxels are classified as polymer and which as zno .",
    "an elementary approach to binarize grayscale images is to use a global threshold : voxels are set to white ( polymer ) if their grayscale value exceeds a certain threshold , and are otherwise set to black ( zno ) .",
    "however , it is difficult to find a single global threshold to binarize the et images because of the irregular brightness of these images .",
    "thus , instead of considering global thresholds , a  method of adaptive thresholding has been used for binarization ; see @xcite .",
    "this method is based on techniques of @xcite and @xcite , where the main idea is to construct a threshold surface which is location - dependent and takes local conditions like overexposure or underexposure into account .",
    "examples of binarizing the et images by adaptive thresholding are displayed in figure  [ fig.raw_data_slices ] .      in this section",
    "we briefly summarize the main ideas of a multi - scale approach to the segmentation of 3d images , which has been developed recently in @xcite .",
    "the crucial step is to find an efficient representation of the binarized and morphologically smoothed images by unions of overlapping spheres .",
    "let @xmath6 denote the zno phase of the binarized images . since the morphology of the set @xmath6 is rather complex ( see figure  [ fig.raw_data_slices ] ) , it is difficult to describe this morphology directly , just by a single stochastic model .",
    "we therefore developed a multi - scale approach to represent the zno phase by different structural components .",
    "each of them will be described separately by suitably chosen stochastic models .",
    "more precisely , we distinguish between a macro - scale component of the binarized et images , which is obtained by morphological smoothing , and several micro - scale components , which consist of those voxels that have been misspecified by the morphological smoothing ; see figure  [ fig : micromacroscale ] .",
    "the intention of morphological smoothing is to reduce the structural complexity of the binarized et images , that is , to omit very fine structural components such as `` thin zno branches , '' that is , thin zno parts connected to larger zno domains , `` isolated zno particles , '' that is , small zno particles in the polymer domains , and `` polymeric holes , '' that is , small polymeric particles inside the zno domains .",
    "the morphological transformations which we use for smoothing the zno phase @xmath6 of the original binarized et images are twofold : `` dilation '' and `` erosion . ''",
    "the morphologically smoothed version of the set @xmath6 will thus be denoted by @xmath7 .        in the next step a stochastic algorithm",
    "[ see @xcite ] is used to efficiently represent the set @xmath7 by a union of spheres , which is denoted by @xmath8 .",
    "this leads to an enormous data reduction .",
    "another advantage of this representation of the set @xmath7 by unions of spheres is that it allows the interpretation of the morphologically smoothed zno phase as a realization of a marked point process where the midpoints of the spheres are the points and the corresponding radii the marks .",
    "recall that in the macro - scale component @xmath7 of the binarized et images as well as in its representation @xmath8 by unions of spheres , some structural details of the original zno phase @xmath6 , like isolated particles , thin branches and polymeric holes , are omitted .",
    "furthermore , the boundaries of zno domains are morphologically smoothed and slightly enlarged by dilation .",
    "hence , when comparing the sets @xmath6 and @xmath8 , we observe that some voxels are misspecified , that is , indicated as zno although originally being polymer , and vice versa .",
    "the set @xmath9 of misspecified voxels is subdivided into several subcomponents , where each of these subcomponents will be modeled separately .",
    "first , two main types of misspecifications are distinguished : outer misspecifications and inner misspecifications ; see figure  [ fig.misspecification ] . each zno voxel that is not covered by a sphere , that is , belonging to the set @xmath10 and therefore constituted as polymer , is called an outer misspecification",
    "typically , thin branches and isolated zno particles are outer misspecifications . on the other hand ,",
    "each polymer voxel which is covered by a sphere , that is , belonging to @xmath11 and constituted as zno , is called an inner misspecification .",
    "inner misspecifications are further subdivided into boundary misspecifications and interior misspecifications .",
    "on the one hand , polymer voxels ( belonging to @xmath12 ) , located near the boundary @xmath13 of the macro - scale component @xmath7 and covered by a sphere , are called boundary misspecifications . on the other hand , each inner misspecification which is not a boundary misspecification",
    "is called an interior misspecification .",
    "typically , polymeric holes belong to interior misspecifications .",
    "we now present our approach to stochastic modeling of the 3d nanomorphology of the zno phase in photoactive layers with three different thicknesses which are given by the binarized et images described in section  [ sub.tom.gra ] .",
    "note that the model type is the same for all three thicknesses , just the fitted values of some model parameters are different .",
    "this means , in particular , that our model can be used for computer - based scenario analyses with the general objective of developing improved materials and technologies for polymer solar cells .    in accordance with the multi - scale representation of the zno phase which has been described in section  [ sec.multi-scale ]",
    ", we will establish stochastic simulation models separately for the morphologically smoothed zno domains represented by unions of overlapping spheres , that is , the macro - scale representation of the zno phase , and for the three types of misspecifications , that is , the micro - scale components .      to begin with ,",
    "we develop a point - process model which describes the macro - scale component of the zno phase represented by unions of spheres .",
    "this model is constructed in several steps .",
    "first we consider 2d point processes for those midpoints of spheres which belong to single slices of voxels , being parallel to the @xmath1@xmath2-plane .",
    "since a strong correlation of midpoints spheres in @xmath0-direction is observed , we propose a multi - layer approach considering sequences of correlated 2d point processes to model the 3d point patterns of midpoints.=-1    the members of these sequences belong to a suitably chosen class of planar poisson cluster processes .",
    "in particular , elliptical matrn cluster processes are considered , where the cluster points are scattered in ellipses of uniformly distributed orientation around their cluster centers . to model the 3d point patterns of midpoints ,",
    "a markov chain with stationary initial distribution is constructed , which consists of highly correlated matrn cluster processes .",
    "it can be seen as a stationary point process in 3d , where the radii of spheres are considered as marks of this point process .",
    "the mark correlation functions , which have been computed for the radii of spheres extracted from et images , show strong positive correlations for small distances between midpoints .",
    "hence , for a given configuration of midpoints , the radii associated with these midpoints are not modeled just by independent marking , but a certain moving - average procedure is proposed .",
    "note that our model of a stationary marked point process in 3d describing the macro - scale component of the zno phase is not isotropic .",
    "this is in accordance with the nanomorphology observed in the et images ; see @xcite .",
    "to get an idea which class of point processes is suitable to model the midpoints belonging to the individual slices of voxels , we consider the pair correlation function @xmath14 of stationary and isotropic point processes in @xmath15 .",
    "note that @xmath16 is proportional to the relative frequency of point pairs with distance @xmath17 from each other ; see , for example , @xcite .",
    "then , for each of the three photoactive layers with thicknesses of 57  nm , 100  nm , and 167  nm , the values  @xmath18 of the pair correlation function have been estimated for distances @xmath19 within some interval @xmath20 ; see figure  [ fig.cor.fun ] .",

    "the clusters appearing in these point patterns seem to be located in relatively small ( bounded ) areas , which corresponds to the fact that @xmath27 for sufficiently large @xmath17 .",
    "the shapes of the clusters are not circular , but rather elongated .",
    "hence , we propose to consider matrn cluster processes , where the cluster points are scattered in ellipses of uniformly distributed orientation around their cluster centers .",
    ", @xmath28 , @xmath29 ) . ]",
    "this class of ( elliptical ) matrn cluster processes in @xmath15 can be described by a vector of four parameters : @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the intensity of the stationary poisson point process @xmath32 of cluster centers , @xmath33 and @xmath34 with @xmath35 are the semi - axes of ( random ) ellipses @xmath36 centered at the points @xmath37 of the poisson process @xmath38 of cluster centers and rotated around @xmath37 by random angles @xmath39 which are independent and uniformly distributed on the interval @xmath40 , and @xmath41 is the intensity of the stationary poisson processes @xmath42 of cluster members which are released by the cluster centers @xmath37 within the ellipses @xmath43 .",
    "the matrn cluster process is then defined as the random point pattern @xmath44 given by @xmath45 , where the sequences @xmath46 are assumed to be independent .",
    "there are strong similarities between consecutive 2d slices in terms of a high correlation of midpoint locations in @xmath0-direction as well as approximately equal numbers of points .",
    "figure  [ fig.successivemidpoints ] shows a series of such consecutive 2d slices from the 57  nm data  set .    as a consequence , it is not suitable to model the stacks of these 2d point patterns by sequences of independent matrn processes .",
    "but the ( vertical ) correlation structure visualized in figure  [ fig.successivemidpoints ] can be taken into account by considering a markov chain of matrn processes .",
    "this allows us to model small displacements of clusters when passing from slice to slice .",
    "furthermore , `` births '' and `` deaths '' of clusters in @xmath0-direction can also be modeled in this way . in other words ,",
    "we consider a certain class of spatial birth - and - death processes with random displacement of points ; see , for example , @xcite .",
    "for each integer @xmath47 , let @xmath48 be a stationary poisson point process in @xmath15 with intensity @xmath49 such that @xmath50 , and let @xmath51 be an independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) sequence of bernoulli random variables , which is independent of @xmath52 , where @xmath53 for some @xmath54 .",

    "let @xmath65 be an elliptical matrn cluster process as introduced in section  [ sec.mod.sli ] , that is , @xmath66 .",
    "assume that the `` birth rate '' @xmath49 and the `` survival probability ''  @xmath67 satisfy @xmath68 , where @xmath31 is the intensity of the poisson process @xmath38 of cluster centers .",
    "for @xmath69 , the poisson process @xmath70 of cluster  centers is then given by @xmath71 .",
    "the poisson process @xmath72 is constructed in the same way as @xmath70 , that is , @xmath73 and so on ; see also figure  [ fig.3dstack ] .",
    "the matrn processes @xmath74 are built similarly to the construction of @xmath75 for example , @xmath76 is given by @xmath77 where the sequences @xmath78 are defined in the same way as @xmath79 introduced in section  [ sec.mod.sli ] .",
    "the markov chain @xmath63 of matrn processes introduced above can be seen as a stationary point process in 3d .",
    "it possesses seven ( free ) parameters : @xmath80 describing its initial distribution , and @xmath81 describing the transitions from step to step , whereas the `` birth intensity '' @xmath49 of ( new ) cluster centers is given by @xmath82 .",
    "it turned out that suitable choices for @xmath83 are the values of @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "this means that the uniform distribution of the displacement vectors @xmath57 is implemented as ( discrete ) uniform distribution on the @xmath86-neighborhood in the considered slice of voxels .",
    "techniques for fitting the remaining five parameters of the markov chain @xmath63 are discussed in section  [ sub.mod.mod ] .",
    "to get an idea which class of mark distributions is suitable to model the radii of spheres , we computed histograms of radii which have been extracted from the et images for each of the three photoactive layers with thicknesses of 57  nm , 100  nm and 167  nm . recall that in the sphere - putting algorithm mentioned in section  [ sec.multi-scale ] we only consider spheres with a minimum radius of @xmath87 voxel sizes",
    ". hence , instead of computing histograms for the original radii , say , @xmath88 we computed histograms for correspondingly reduced radii @xmath89 where @xmath90 .",
    "it turns out that for all three film thicknesses , gamma distributions can be fitted quite nicely to the histograms of reduced radii ; see figure  [ fig.gamma_distribution ] .",

    "this also is an important characteristic , because only if there is a high connectivity , that is , if many percolation pathways exist , the produced charges can be transported to the electrodes , where current can be gripped .",
    "for estimating the connected and monotonously connected volume fractions of zno we applied the same methods as in @xcite .",
    "however , in general , the ( conditional ) connected and monotonously connected volume fractions of the foreground phase in globally thresholded images do not monotonously depend on the values of global thresholds .",
    "but as shown in figure  [ fig.connectivity ] , this is the case for the globally thresholded et data of photoactive layers of polymer - zno solar cells .",

    ", we can conclude that our model fits very well to real data regarding the considered structural characteristics . as the model has been developed for analyzing the influence of morphology on the performance of solar cells , we also consider a physical characteristic for model validation which is described in the following section .",
    "quenching efficiency  @xmath104 is the probability of a random exciton being quenched ; see section [ sub.pho.act ] .",
    "it is an elementary but important physical characteristic for the efficiency of solar cells .    in a hybrid polymer - zno solar cell ,",
    "absorption of light by the polymer phase does not directly yield free charge carriers . instead excitons are formed .",
    "it is only at the interface of the polymer and zno phase that free charges are generated by quenching ( splitting ) of excitons .",
    "it is therefore of the utmost importance that excitons are able to reach this interface .",
    "the exciton diffusion length in conjugated polymers is typically a few nanometers , which puts a considerable constraint on the morphology of polymer solar cells . in other words ,",

    "in the present paper we developed a parameterized stochastic simulation model for the nanostructure of photoactive layers of hybrid polymer - zno solar cells . the model is based on tools from stochastic geometry .",
    "additional to the model itself , we developed a method to fit its parameters to real 3d et image data .    to establish our model ,",
    "the adaptively thresholded et images are segmented using a stochastic algorithm which consists of two main steps .",
    "first , the images are morphologically smoothed in order to slightly decrease their structural complexity .",
    "then , the morphologically smoothed binary images are represented by a system of overlapping spheres , which can be interpreted as a realization of a 3d marked point process , where the sphere centers are the locations of points and the corresponding radii are their marks . for the stochastic simulation model ,",
    "we use a correlated vector of 2d elliptical matrn cluster processes , where the points are subsequently marked to create a 3d marked point process . to complete the model , that is , to include the structural details which were omitted due to the morphological smoothing , a stochastic simulation model for this `` micro - scale '' component is developed afterward .",
    "as our stochastic simulation model is fully parameterized , we also developed techniques for the estimation of the model parameters of all model components .",
    "thus , we are able to fit the simulation model to the et image data described in section [ sub.tom.gra ] .    finally , we validated the simulation model by comparing structural and physical characteristics computed from simulated image data with the corresponding characteristics obtained from globally and adaptively thresholded et images , respectively .",
    "in particular , the quenching efficiencies computed for realizations of the simulation model agree very well with those of the et images .",
    "hence , our model nicely reflects the diffusion of excitons .",
    "since we were able to fit our model to 3d et data , it has already proved its capability to represent realistic nanostructures of photoactive layers of hybrid polymer - zno solar cells .",
    "the fact that the model is parameter - based enables us to predict morphologies for film thicknesses , which have not ( yet ) been imaged by 3d et , by interpolating or extrapolating the fitted model parameters . due to a strong correlation between morphology and efficiency of polymer solar cells",
    "[ see @xcite ] , the developed simulation model is of significant importance for further investigations of polymer solar cells . in a forthcoming paper",
    "we will also investigate the transport processes of charges to the electrodes as described in @xcite , additional to the structural and physical characteristics considered in the present paper . by generating virtual morphologies , which are generated as realizations of the developed model with different parameter configurations , and investigating the transport processes of electrons and excitons therein",
    ", the spatial stochastic model will be used to identify morphologies of improved efficiency with respect to the considered physical characteristics .",
    "we also remark that the modeling approach developed in the present paper can be applied to various other kinds of image data , including geographical data considered , for example , in ecology .",
    "then , for instance , the markov chain of matrn cluster processes introduced in section  [ sec.spa.bir ] may be viewed as a sequence of dependent 2d point processes through time , which can model , for example , the temporal movements of species in a given region .",
