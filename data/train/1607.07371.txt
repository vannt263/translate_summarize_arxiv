    "quantum control is aimed at designing external pulses in order to achieve efficient transfers between the states of the quantum system under study @xcite .",
    "this task is crucial in atomic and molecular physics , and has many applications extending from photochemistry to quantum computation .",
    "quantum control has attracted attention among the physics and chemistry communities @xcite , but also in applied mathematics for the development of new theoretical methods . in strong field molecular physics , antagonistic basic mechanisms like bond softening versus vibrational trapping @xcite , or barrier lowering versus dynamical dissociation quenching @xcite have been referred to in the control scenarios of molecular reactivity or even for alignment / orientation purpose @xcite .",
    "an even more unexpected quenching mechanism is in relation with the so - called zero - width resonances ( zwr ) . for certain couples of laser parameters ( wavelength and intensity ) the photodissociation rate vanishes leading to , in principle , infinitely long lived resonances ( zwrs ) in both continuous wave @xcite and pulsed regimes @xcite . in a diatomic molecule ,",
    "a destructive interference is in play taking place among fluxes contributing to the outgoing scattering amplitude of an initial vibrational state decaying through two laser - induced adiabatic channels .",
    "when dealing with intramolecular couplings , the specific requirement for such destructive interference can only be fulfilled for some particular interchannel coupling amplitudes . despite strong interchannel coupling",
    ", the observation of some narrow rotational lines in ibr predissociation provides such an example @xcite .",
    "radiative interactions offer the possibility of a continuous tuning of laser parameters to reach a zwr .",
    "our laser control objective is the vibrational cooling of diatomic molecules produced by photoassociation in translationally and rotationally cold , tightly bound states @xcite .",
    "the filtration strategy we are referring to aims at protecting against photodissociation a given single vibrational state , while all others are decaying fast .",
    "this is achieved through an adiabatic and continuous transport of this state population on its corresponding zwr all along a laser pulse adequately shaped and frequency chirped . starting from a given vibrational distribution ,",
    "the efficiency of such a control remains on two crucial issues : ( i ) the best possible protection of the given vibrational state ; ( ii ) the highest decay rates for all the others .",
    "the first issue deals with the adiabatic transport model .",
    "recently , we built an intuitive transport scheme by chirping a laser pulse such as to merely combine , at each time within the pulse duration , the wavelength and the intensity corresponding to the following of a zwr originating , in field - free conditions , from the vibrational state we wish to protect .",
    "although this simple scheme does not result from a formal adiabatic treatment , we obtained encouraging results in the case of a light diatomic like h@xmath1 , with 70@xmath2 of the initial population left at the end of the pulse thanks to the relatively slowly varying pulse envelope and modest chirp amplitude @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the situation is drastically different for na@xmath0 where almost the whole initial population can photodissociate .",
    "this prompted us to go through a full adiabatic transport control scheme based on the adiabatic floquet theory @xcite completely reformulated to account for zwrs in a pulsed regime .",
    "the second issue concerns the anharmonicity and relatively high density of vibrational levels in heavier species like na@xmath0 .",
    "the consequence is that laser pulses shaped so as to protect a given vibrational level can have characteristics close to the ones appropriate for at least partly protecting neighboring levels .",
    "a semiclassical analysis helps in finding and interpreting , in the laser parameter plane , a complete map of zwrs originating from a field - free vibrational level .",
    "we show how a choice can be done of a particular zwr path , among the complete series identified by the semiclassical analysis .",
    "this aims at realizing the most efficient filtration , namely the best compromise for selectively protecting the single vibrational state in consideration .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way : in section [ sec2 ] , zwrs are introduced within a two - state photodissociation model referring both to a time - independent close - coupled floquet hamiltonian formalism and a semiclassical interpretation .",
    "two computational methods , either grid or global are presented .",
    "section [ sec3 ] is devoted to a complete derivation of the adiabatic control theory .",
    "the filtration strategy as applied to na@xmath0 is discussed in section [ sec4 ] , by introducing the model , the zwr maps , the adiabatic transport dynamics and the choice of the optimal zwr path .",
    "in this section , we examine the rather unexpected property of a resonance state , originating from a bound state coupled to a dissociative continuum , to possibly acquire an infinite ( or quasi - infinite ) lifetime .",
    "such exotic resonances have already been discussed in the literature , first in the context of accidentally narrow rotational lines in predissociation @xcite , then as bound sates in continuum ( bic ) @xcite , and more recently as zero - width resonances ( zwr ) @xcite . in the following , the physical context is molecular photodissociation and our illustrative example is na@xmath0 .",
    "we briefly recall the model used to describe the photodissociation of a rotationless field - aligned diatomic molecule in a single spatial dimension ( the internuclear distance @xmath3 ) with only two electronic states labeled @xmath4 and @xmath5 in a born - oppenheimer approximation . reduced dimensionality with the frozen rotation assumption is validated by considering linearly polarized light and short pulse durations we refer to hereafter , as compared to the rotational periods of the molecular species .",
    "the time - dependent wave function is written as : @xmath6 the nuclear dynamics is governed by the time dependent schrdinger equation ( tdse ) : @xmath7    =    \\left ( t_n + \\left[\\begin{array}{c c } v_1(r)&0 \\\\ 0&v_2(r ) \\end{array}\\right ] \\right . & \\nonumber \\\\   & - \\left .",

    "resonances are solutions with siegert type outgoing - wave boundary conditions @xcite and have complex quasi - energies of the form @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the resonance width related to the decay rate . in the following ,",
    "the label @xmath31 designates both the field - free vibrational level and the laser - induced resonance originating from this vibrational state .    now relaxing the cw laser assumption",
    ", we consider a chirped laser pulse with parameters @xmath37 involving slowly varying envelope and frequency .",
    "the molecule , initially in a particular field - free vibrational state @xmath31 , is supposed to be adiabatically driven by such a pulse .",
    "adiabaticity means here that a unique resonance @xmath38 , labeled @xmath31 according to its field - free parent bound state @xmath31 , is followed during the whole dynamics .",
    "this resonance wave function involves , through its complete basis set expansion , a combination of both bound and continuum eigenstates of the field - free molecular hamiltonian .",
    "but the important issue is that , at the end of the pulse , the molecule is again on its initial single vibrational state @xmath31 ( adiabaticity condition ) . for such open systems ,",
    "contrary to dynamics involving bound states only , there is unavoidably an irreversible decay process , precisely due to the fact that vibrational continuum states are temporarily populated under the effect of the pulse .",

    "there are two central control issues : ( 1 ) investigating how rates are changing with the field parameters and in particular find optimal combinations @xmath44 for which these rates are small enough ( or even ideally zero ) to insure the survival of the vibrational state @xmath31 to the laser excitation , that is @xmath45 , @xmath46 being the total pulse duration ; ( 2 ) predicting how well the adiabatic following is effectively realized ( this point will be analysed in more details in section [ sec3 ] ) .      the occurrence of zwrs , at least under some particular circumstances , is rationalized by the semiclassical theory of predissociation of a diatomic molecule @xcite .",
    "the formalism deals with the so - called adiabatic potentials @xmath47 resulting from the diagonalization of the molecule - field interaction matrix and predicts dissociation quenching resulting from a null value of the outgoing scattering amplitude in the lower ( open ) adiabatic channel @xmath48 , if the following two conditions are simultaneously fulfilled@xcite : @xmath49 and @xmath50 in eqs.([eq : semiclassical1],[eq : semiclassical2 ] ) the wavenumbers are @xmath51^{1/2}$ ] , @xmath52 is the reduced nuclear mass , @xmath53 are the left turning points of @xmath54 potentials , @xmath55 is the right turning point of @xmath56 and @xmath57 is the diabatic crossing point resulting from field - dressing . with integer @xmath58 and",

    "this is practically the diabatic attractive potential @xmath9 .",
    "more precisely , the coincidence condition is implemented in the expression of the resonance width @xmath36 @xcite : @xmath67 ^ 3 } ( \\varepsilon_{\\tilde{v}}-\\varepsilon_{\\tilde{v}_{+}})^2      \\label{eq : gammasem}\\ ] ] @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the local energy spacings of the modified diabatic and adiabatic potentials respectively .",
    "@xmath70 is the landau - zener coupling parameter : @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the classical velocity and slope difference of the diabatic potentials at @xmath57 .",
    "clearly , the two energies @xmath64 and @xmath60 , and therefore the width @xmath36 are dependent on field parameters , i.e. , both frequency ( or wavelength ) and amplitude ( or intensity ) .",
    "this is in particular due to the ( @xmath74 , @xmath75)-dependence of the corresponding field - dressed adiabatic potentials @xmath47 .",
    "all other factors building up @xmath36 in eq.([eq : gammasem ] ) , that is the coupling @xmath70 and the local energy spacings @xmath68 , @xmath69 , also depend on field parameters .",
    "contrary to predissociation where such coincidences can only be accidental since there is no easy and continuous way to modify potentials and interstate couplings ( electronic or spin - orbit ) , for a diatomic molecule submitted to an electromagnetic field , a fine tuning of the wavelength and intensity produces them at will .",
    "this explains the occurrence of zwrs in photodissociation .",
    "moreover , for a wavelength @xmath74 which roughly brings into coincidence the levels @xmath59 ( corresponding to the field - free vibrational level @xmath31 in consideration ) and @xmath76 , a fine tuning of the intensity @xmath75 will result in an accurate determination of a zwr , that is @xmath77 . in some cases , a stronger field ( higher @xmath75 )",
    "may also bring into coincidence @xmath59 with @xmath78 , producing thus a second zwr , for the same wavelength , and so on for @xmath79 but , one can also envisage slightly different wavelengths which build energetically close enough @xmath59 and @xmath76 levels in a field - dressed picture , such that a subsequent fine tuning of the intensity brings them into precise coincidence .",
    "this flexibility offered by the field parameters that , in principle , can be continuously modified , is at the origin of not only quasi - zero width photodissociation resonances , but also for their multiple occurrence in the ( @xmath74 , @xmath75)-parameter plane @xcite .",
    "we are referring to two classes of computational methods for an accurate determination of laser parameters @xmath44 producing a zwr : ( i ) grid methods and ( ii ) global methods .",
    "to be more specific , for these calculations , @xmath43 has not to be considered as a time variable , but rather as a parameter .",
    "to a fixed @xmath43 corresponds a set of field parameters @xmath37 or equivalently @xmath80 , which determine a specific cw laser , fulfilling the single period requirement of the floquet ansatz of eq.([eq : anzats ] ) . the time - independent system of close - coupled equations for the @xmath3-dependent fourier coefficients @xmath81 of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : closecoupled ] ) are solved for these given field amplitude and frequency .",
    "these methods are based on so - called shooting - matching techniques .",
    "the fox - goodwin propagation algorithm @xcite is used in conjunction with a properly chosen set of imposed boundary conditions , which accounts for the correct behavior of the channel wave functions both at short and large distances .",
    "the algorithm consists in an iterating sequence of two steps @xcite : ( i ) shooting : with an initial guess for the quasi - energy @xmath32 , properly initialized fox - goodwin matrices are constructed at each point of a grid ( along @xmath3 ) in terms of independent solution matrices propagated inward and outward ; ( ii ) matching : the criterion for convergence is a condition to be fulfilled for matching both the functions and their derivatives on two adjacent points of the grid , by properly changing the energy @xmath32 . while regularity ( @xmath82 ) is imposed at the origin for both open and closed channels , which are classically forbidden , the boundary conditions for large @xmath3 are different for these two types of channels .",
    "zero inward initialization is still valid for the closed channel @xmath83 , whereas siegert - type outgoing boundary conditions should be adopted for the open one @xmath84 @xcite .",
    "high accuracy can be achieved by using complex rotation of the coordinate @xmath3 @xcite which actually plays the role of an absorbing potential .",
    "the most important observation is that the use of the complex coordinate brings the outgoing asymptotic behavior to regularity ( zero inward initialization ) @xcite .",
    "such imposed boundary conditions are at the origin of quantization conditions leading to discrete complex resonance energies .    in practice ,",
    "a plausible laser wavelength is guessed from the semiclassical coincidence criterion involving the vibrational level @xmath59 of the quasi - diabatic potential @xmath9 at low intensity eq.([eq : semiclassical2 ] ) and one of the vibrational levels @xmath85 of the upper adiabatic potential @xmath61 eq.([eq : semiclassical1 ] ) .",
    "this is convenient for the search of a zwr originating from @xmath59 , which actually is nothing but @xmath31 at the zero field intensity limit .",
    "an important point to consider is that , due to the possibility to bring into coincidence several vibrational levels of the upper adiabatic potential @xmath85 with a given @xmath59 , there are several wavelengths which may be convenient for a zwr search .",
    "such a wavelength being fixed for a given field - free vibrational level @xmath31 , the field strength @xmath75 is progressively increased . for each discrete value of @xmath75 ,",
    "starting from an initial guess for the energy coming from the previously considered value of @xmath75 , the propagation - matching procedure leads to an accurate eigenenergy @xmath86 when properly converged .",
    "all calculations are conducted within the single photon absorption approximation frame of eqs.([eq : closecoupled ] ) , which is valid for low enough intensities , neglecting the mixing of neighboring floquet blocks occurring within the period @xmath87 @xcite .",
    "a typical behavior of the resonance width @xmath36 as a function of the increasing field strength @xmath75 displays a linear increase , and a saturation , followed by a natural decrease of the decay rates which is interpreted in terms of spatial non - adiabatic effects @xcite .",
    "but more interesting is the observation of very fast and local collapse of the width , for specific intensities .",
    "one can finely adjust the intensity , such as to obtain resonance widths close to zero within several figures of accuracy .",
    "this shows that , at least in the single floquet block approximation of eqs.([eq : closecoupled ] ) , zwrs do exist as also predicted by the semiclassical theory .",
    "introducing multiphoton processes will offer additional dissociation channels from which the outgoing flux could be evacuated .",
    "this may give rise to ( small but still non zero ) partial widths contributing to @xmath36 @xcite which may no more strictly collapse to zero .",
    "inserting the floquet ansatz eq .   into the schrdinger equation",
    "leads to an eigenvalue problem for the floquet states @xmath88 and the associated quasienergies @xmath32 , @xmath89    \\left [ \\begin{array}{c } \\chi_{v,1 } ( r , t ) \\\\   \\chi_{v,2 } ( r , t ) \\end{array }   \\right ] = e_v    \\left [ \\begin{array}{c } \\chi_{v,1 } ( r , t ) \\\\   \\chi_{v,2 } ( r , t ) \\end{array }   \\right ] , \\label{floquetev1}\\ ] ] where @xmath90 is the hamiltonian introduced in eq .  .",
    "this eigenvalue problem can be solved using a global iterative method .",
    "the operator @xmath91 appearing in the left - hand side of eq .",
    "is called the floquet hamiltonian and can be represented within a direct product basis set made of two fourier basis sets , one for the radial coordinate and another for the time coordinate ( as an additional quantum coordinate ) .",
    "we typically use 4 to 8 floquet blocks with both open channels ( describing multi photon absorption ) and closed ones ( describing photon emission ) . with the moderate intensities used hereafter , the floquet block describing a single photon absorption remains the dominant one .",
    "it is to be noticed that grid method calculations can also be extended to perform calculations including a larger number of floquet blocks and the convergence with respect to the number of channels has been checked independently with both numerical approaches . in any case , if the intensity is small enough , the difference between two - channel calculations and calculations using a larger number of floquet blocks remains very small .    using the global representation of the floquet hamiltonian described above , we proceed as follows : for each value of the field parameters @xmath92 , one particular solution of eq .",
    "( [ floquetev1 ] ) is obtained by using an initial guess for the eigenvector and modifying it by using an iterative method .",
    "we have taken advantage of the wave operator method which can handle dissipative problems and is well - adapted for searching small numbers of complex eigenvalues of a large matrix @xcite .",
    "the main idea is to define an active space of interest chosen so as to possess a strong overlap with the expected unknown eigenvector .",
    "then we find the wave operator @xmath93 which transforms the floquet hamiltonian matrix @xmath94 into a smaller , effective matrix within the active space , @xmath95 p_o , \\label{waveop}\\ ] ] the eigenvalues of which are exact eigenvalues of the initial problem .",
    "@xmath96 is the projector on this active space and @xmath97 is a non - invertible matrix with a special structure , such that all columns corresponding to states out of the active space be zero .",
    "the wave operator can be found by effectively solving the non - linear bloch equation @xcite , @xmath98 the above eq .  , together with the special structure imposed to @xmath97 ,",
    "completely define the wave operator able to reduce the eigenvalue problem to an effective , small - dimensional problem .",
    "eq .   can be solved in an iterative way .",
    "we have used a variant of the recursive distorded wave approximation algorithm @xcite . here , the active space can be chosen as one - dimensional ( the space spanned by the vibrational state from which the resonance is formed ) .",
    "this choice is simple and sufficient to attain convergence .",
    "this means that we calculate one resonance at a time .",
    "the same approach has been previously used in a slightly different context within the constrained adiabatic trajectory method ( catm ) and more methodological details about the iterative equations can be found in ref .",
    "it should be noted that the wave - operator equation ( [ waveop ] ) can give either solutions to the tdse ( if suitable time - dependent absorbing potentials are included in the model to constrain the initial conditions , as in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , or quasienergies and the corresponding floquet eigenstates defined in eq . ( [ floquetev1 ] ) ( if there are no constraints on the initial conditions , as is the case here ) .    in comparison with grid methods described in section [ gridmethods",
    "] , there is no need for an initial energy guess but we do need an initial guess for the eigenvector . at low intensities ,",
    "the algorithm converges well by using a field - free vibrational state , constant over the time period , as an initial guess .",
    "then , when the laser parameters are progressively varied it is possible to use the result obtained in the previous calculation ( with slightly different parameters ) as the initial guess for calculating the next eigenvector corresponding to the next laser parameters .",
    "each new calculation costs only a few more iterations to converge toward the new quasienergy ( only one iteration is often sufficient ) .",
    "this is an advantage of using a global iterative method , the exploration of the parameter plane is made easier .",
    "another difference with grid methods is that the calculations with the global algorithm have been done using a radial complex absorbing potential to discretize the continuum , instead of using a complex rotation of the coordinate .",
    "this different implementation has very little consequence on the results , since the absorbing potential is acting over a large domain .",
    "the optimal zwr paths in the @xmath92 parameter plane are obtained following a two - step strategy . in a first step",
    ", we fix a low intensity and we study exhaustively the variations of the width @xmath36 with respect to the wavelength , for different resonances originating from different values of @xmath31 .",
    "this allows us to identify the wavelengths of interest",
    ". then complete zwr paths are obtained by gradually varying the laser intensity @xmath75 and finding for each intensity the optimal @xmath74 corresponding to a minimum resonance width @xmath36 .",
    "this gives a critical set of parameters @xmath99 which forms an almost continuous numerical path ( see section [ zwrmaps ] ) .",

    "the methodology goes through the following steps : ( a ) introduction of the adiabatic floquet hamiltonian acting on an extended hilbert space together with the conditions of its equivalence with the original tdse of the physical space ; ( b ) adiabatic approximation aiming at the tracking of a single resonance in the extended space ; ( c ) zero - width resonance ( zwr ) strategy in the extended space ; ( d ) back transformation to the physical space .",

    "in practical calculations done for the different zwr paths originating from @xmath2068 , we obtain semiclassical estimates for @xmath265 typically less than 0.04 .",

    "the contrast is then optimal in comparison to the two other possible minima of @xmath275 appearing around @xmath279 and @xmath280 .",
    "this semiclassical analysis conducted on near zero - field limit , can be confirmed by the time - dependent quantum behavior of resonance widths during their adiabatic transport all along the zwr paths of fig.([loci_zwr ] ) .",

    "the implementation of the filtration scheme , within the hypothesis of an initial ensemble of vibrational states , or of an initial coherent vibrational superposition , is summarized in fig.([populations ] ) .",
    "we assume an equally populated field - free initial vibrational distribution among levels @xmath186 ( in black ) , @xmath269 ( in red ) and @xmath271 ( in blue ) .",

    "full quantum dynamical simulations based on wavepacket propagation are used for solving the tdse eq.([tdse ] ) as explained in section [ nummethod ] .",
    "the first observation is that for all zwr paths the initial population of @xmath2068 is well protected against dissociation , as is expected from an adiabatic transport .",
    "the final @xmath2068 undissociated populations are all above 95@xmath2 , which remains a remarkable result for the zwr quenching mechanism itself .",
    "the second important information concerns the overall filtration process efficiency . while for zwr ( @xmath283 ) a large remaining population on @xmath2069 , 10 levels ( more than 80@xmath2 and 50@xmath2 respectively ) renders the filtration inefficient , only the choice of zwr ( @xmath186 , @xmath187 ) leads to acceptable results , with less than 10@xmath2 of undissociated population on @xmath284 .",
    "the vibrational cooling control is achieved as the system is left on a single vibrational level , namely @xmath186 .",
    "a final stirap process @xcite could optionally be referred to for transferring the population from @xmath186 to @xmath285 .",
    "we propose a laser control strategy for the vibrational cooling of diatomic molecules based on an efficient filtration scheme.the basic mechanism which is referred to is a destructive interference between outgoing fluxes from the two field - dressed electronic states involved in the photodissociation process . in principle , infinitely long lived resonances ( zwrs ) result from such interference , for some well tuned couples of laser parameters ( wavelength and intensity ) .",
    "starting from an initial vibrational population distribution , filtration aims at a selective decay among them ; namely , all levels , except one , should dissociate .",
    "the proposed scheme goes through the optimization of a laser pulse envelop shaped and frequency chirped in such a way as to protect against dissociation a given initial vibrational level @xmath31 .",
    "this is achieved by an adiabatic transport of the @xmath31 population on its corresponding zwr which is continuously followed all along the pulse duration .",
    "two important issues that turn out to be crucial for the success of the process when dealing with heavy systems like na@xmath0 , and that have not been addressed previously , are emphasized in this work .",
    "the more fundamental first one concerns the challenging problem of adiabaticity in decaying system dynamics involving a dissociative continuum .",
    "actually this is solved by adapting the adiabatic floquet approach ( originally derived for bound states ) to the special case of zwrs , taking advantage of their non - decaying peculiarity , although being coupled to a dissociative continuum ( bics , bound states in continuum ) .",
    "it is only through such an adiabatic transport that we can protect the population of a vibrational level in a robust way .",
    "the second issue concerns more specifically the application in mind .",
    "we have shown that the family of zwrs , originating from the field - free initial vibrational level @xmath31 to be protected , is organized in terms of several paths in the laser parameter plane .",
    "if all the members of this family are convenient to quench the dissociation from @xmath31 , some of the laser pulses built to follow such paths may have characteristics close to be appropriate for partly protecting neighboring vibrational populations as well .",
    "this situation arises when transposing the control scheme to heavier diatomics like na@xmath0 , basically due to anharmonicity and relatively high vibrational levels density .",
    "its occurrence is obviously against the efficiency of the filtration process .",
    "a semiclassical analysis developed in detail helps the choice of the pulse offering the best compromise between quenching @xmath31 and providing highest possible decay rates for the neighboring vibrational states @xmath286 ( @xmath287 ) .",
    "a full quantum wavepacket propagation using the optimal pulse confirms the expectations of both the adiabatic floquet theory and the semiclassical analysis . in the hypothesis of an initial equal vibrational population partition on @xmath2068,9 , and 10 for na@xmath0 prepared by photoassociation",
    ", @xmath2068 is protected up to 95@xmath2 of its initial population , whereas only less than 5@xmath2 of the @xmath2069 and 10 populations are left .",
    "it is worthwhile noting that such a control is achieved with a total pulse duration not exceeding 12@xmath177 , thus avoiding rotational heating of the molecule .",
    "our final claim is that the proposed laser pulse characteristics , namely rather modest frequency chirp amplitudes around @xmath288 , moderate intensities ( less than @xmath289 ) , realistic pulse duration ( less than 12@xmath177 ) , remain experimentally feasible .",
    "moreover , within the adiabatic transport frame that has been developed , the model becomes finally generic enough to be transposed to the vibrational cooling of other alkali dimers .",
