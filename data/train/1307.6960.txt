    "compressed sensing @xcite is a theoretical framework which gives guarantees to recover sparse signals ( signals reprensented by few non - zero coefficients in a given basis ) from a limited number of linear projections . in some applications ,",
    "the measurement basis is fixed and the projections should be selected amongst a fixed set .",
    "for instance , in mri , the signal is sparse in the wavelet basis , and the sampling is performed in the spatial  ( 2d or 3d ) fourier basis ( called ) .",
    "possible measurements are then projections on the lines of matrix @xmath1 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 denote the fourier and inverse wavelet transform , respectively .",
    "recent results  @xcite give bounds on the number of measurement @xmath4 needed to exactly recover @xmath5-sparse signals in @xmath6 or @xmath7 in the framework of bounded orthogonal systems .",
    "the authors have shown that for a given @xmath5-sparse signal , the number of measurements needed to ensure its perfect recovery is @xmath8 .",
    "this methodology , called _ variable density sampling _ , involves an independent and identically distributed  ( iid ) random drawing and has already given promising results in reconstruction simulations  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , in real mri , such sampling patterns can not be implemented , because of the limited speed of magnetic field gradient commutation .",
    "hardware constraints require at least continuity of the sampling trajectory , which is not satisfied by two - dimensional iid sampling . in this paper",
    ", we introduce a new markovian sampling scheme to enforce continuity .",
    "our approach relies on the following reconstruction condition introduced by juditski , karzan and nemirovki  @xcite :    if @xmath9 satisfies : @xmath10 all @xmath5-sparse signals @xmath11 are recovered exactly by solving : @xmath12    which can be seen as an alternative to the _ mutual coherence _  @xcite .",
    "we will show that this criterion makes it possible to obtain theoritical guarantees on the number of measurements necessary to reconstruct @xmath5 sparse signals , using variable density sampling or markovian sampling .",
    "unfortunately the bounds we obtain are in @xmath13 .",
    "this phenomenon is due to the _ quadratic bottleneck _ described in @xcite .",
    "we are currently trying to obtain @xmath14 results using different proof strategies .",
    "a signal @xmath11 is said to be @xmath5-sparse if it has at most @xmath5 non - zero coefficients .",
    "@xmath15 is measured through the acquisition system represented by a matrix @xmath16 .",
    "downsampling the measurements consists of deriving a matrix @xmath9 composed of @xmath4 lines of @xmath16 and observing @xmath17 .",
    "we aim at finding @xmath18 composed of @xmath4 rows of @xmath9 , and @xmath19 such that @xmath20 , for a given positive integer @xmath5 .",
    "following @xcite , we set @xmath21 and use the decomposition @xmath22 .",
    "we consider a sequence of @xmath4 random i.i.d .",
    "matrices @xmath23 , taking value @xmath24 with probability @xmath25 .",
    "we set @xmath26 , where @xmath27 , so that @xmath28 is equal to @xmath29 .",
    "let us denote @xmath30 .",
    "then @xmath31 may be written as @xmath32 .",
    "[ prop : indep ] @xmath33 + @xmath34    bernstein s concentration inequality @xcite states that if @xmath35 are independent zero - mean random variables such that for all @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , then @xmath39 @xmath40 for @xmath41 , let @xmath42 denote the @xmath43th entry of a matrix @xmath44 .",
    "the random variable @xmath45 is centered since @xmath46 . moreover , @xmath47 . applying bernstein s inequality to the sequence @xmath48",
    "gives @xmath49 finally , using a union bound and the symmetry property of matrix @xmath50 , we get : @xmath51 since @xmath52 is independent of @xmath43 , we obtain eq .  .",
    "setting @xmath53 in lemma  [ prop : indep ] , the bound given by juditsky et al . in @xcite is @xmath54 .",
    "this bound is obtained by upper - bounding the mean of @xmath55 and using markov inequality . setting the same @xmath56 value in eq .  , and assuming @xmath57 , we obtain @xmath58 .",
    "this huge difference comes from inability of markov inequality to capture large deviations behaviors .    from lemma  [ prop : indep ]",
    ", we can derive the immediate following result by setting @xmath59 :    let @xmath60 be a measurement matrix designed by drawing @xmath4 lines of @xmath9 under the distribution @xmath61 .",
    "then , with probability @xmath62 , if @xmath63 every @xmath5-sparse signal @xmath15 is the unique solution of the @xmath64 problem : @xmath65      sampling patterns obtained using the strategy presented in section [ part:2 ] are not usable for many practical devices .",
    "a common constraint met on many hardwares ( e.g. mri ) is the proximity of successive measurements . a simple way to model dependence between successive samples consists of introducing a markov chain @xmath66 on the set @xmath67 that represents locations of possible measurements .",
    "the transition probability to go from location @xmath36 to location @xmath68 is positive if and only if sampling @xmath36 and @xmath68 successively is possible .",
    "we denote @xmath69 . + in order to use a concentration inequality , @xmath31 should satisfy @xmath70 .",
    "we thus need ( i ) to set the stationary distribution of the markov chain to @xmath61 and ( ii ) to set up the chain with its stationnary distribution @xmath61 .",
    "these two conditions ensure that the marginal distribution of the chain is @xmath25 at any time .",
    "the issue of designing such a chain is widely studied in the frame of markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) algorithms .",
    "a simple way to build up the transition matrix @xmath71 is the metropolis algorithm  @xcite .",
    "let us now recall a concentration inequality for finite - state markov chains  @xcite .",
    "[ thm : lezaud ] let @xmath72 be an irreductible and reversible markov chain on a finite set g of size @xmath73 .",
    "let @xmath74 be such that @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "then , for any initial distribution @xmath77 , any positive integer @xmath4 and all @xmath78 , @xmath79 where @xmath80 , @xmath81 is the second largest eigenvalue of @xmath82 , and @xmath83 is the spectral gap of the chain .",
    "finally @xmath84 is given by @xmath85 .",
    "using this theorem , we can guarantee the following control of the term @xmath86 : +    @xmath87 , @xmath88    by applying theorem  [ thm : lezaud ] to a function @xmath89 and then to its opposite @xmath90 , we get :    @xmath91    then we set @xmath92 .",
    "the markov chain is constructed such that @xmath93 .",
    "since we have @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and since @xmath96 , @xmath97 .",
    "moreover , since the initial distribution is @xmath61 , @xmath98 and thus @xmath99 . again , resorting to a union bound ( [ eq : ineg_inf ] ) enables us to extend the result for the @xmath43th entry to the whole infinite norm of the @xmath100 matrix @xmath101  .",
    "+    then we can quantify the number of measurements needed to ensure exact recovery :    [ prop : measurements_needed ] let @xmath60 be a measurement matrix designed by drawing @xmath4 lines of @xmath9 under the markovian process described above .",
    "then , with probability @xmath62 , if @xmath102 every @xmath5-sparse signal @xmath15 is the unique solution of the @xmath64 problem : @xmath65    the spectral gap @xmath103 takes its value between 0 and 1 and describes the mixing properties of the markov chain .",
    "the closer the spectral gap to 1 , the fastest the convergence to the mean .",
    "+    all the results above can be extended to the complex case using a slightly different proof .",
    "in order to cover a larger domain of @xmath0-space , we consider the following chain : @xmath104 , where @xmath105 corresponds to an independent drawing @xmath106 .",
    "this chain has @xmath61 as invariant distribution , and fulfills the continuity property while enabling a jump with probability of @xmath107 .",
    "weyl s theorem  @xcite ensures that @xmath108 . this bound is useful because of the dependence of @xmath103 with respect to the problem dimension , which would have weakened condition  .    sampling scheme obtained by these methods",
    "are composed of @xmath109-average length random walks on the @xmath0-space .",
    "all our experiments consist of reconstructing a two - dimensional image from a sampled @xmath0-space by solving an @xmath64 minimization problem .",
    "constrained @xmath64 minimization ( eq .  ) is performed using the douglas - rachford algorithm  @xcite . in each case , only twenty percent of the fourier coefficients are kept , which corresponds to an acceleration factor of @xmath110 .",
    "since the schemes are obtained by a random process , we run each experiment 10 times independently , and compared the mean value of the reconstruction results in terms of _ peak signal - to - noise ratio _ ( psnr ) .",
    "+ in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , it is shown that the image reconstruction quality degrades when @xmath107 decreases .",
    "these results can be explained by the spatial confinement of the continuous parts of a given markov chain , except for large values of @xmath107 .",
    "there seems to be a compromise between the number of discontinuities of the chain ( linked to the hardware constraints in mri ) and the @xmath0-space coverage .",
    "nevertheless , accurate reconstruction results can be observed with reasonable average mean length of connected subparts ( @xmath111 or @xmath112 ) .",
    "the mixing properties of the chain ( through its spectral gap ) seem to have a strong impact on the quality of the scheme , as shown in proposition  [ prop : measurements_needed ] .",
    "unfortunately , the spectral gap is strongly related to the problem dimension @xmath73 and can tend to zero if @xmath73 goes to infinity .",
    "this proves to be a theoretic limitation of this method .",
    "nevertheless , we obtained reliable reconstruction results which can not be explained by the proposed theory .",
    "since the design process is based on randomness , we can even expose a specific scheme which provides accurate reconstruction results instead of considering the mean behavior ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ) .",
    "we currently aim at deriving a stronger result on the number of measurements needed , involving a @xmath14 bound .",
    "meanwhile , we are developing second order chains which can ensure more regularity of the trajectories and for which we have already observed good reconstruction results ( fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ) .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "we proposed a novel approach combining compressed sensing and markov chains to design continuous sampling trajectories , required for mri applications .",
    "our work may easily be extended to a 3d framework by considering a different neighbourhood of each @xmath0-space location .",
    "existing continuous trajectories in cs - mri only exploit 1d or 2d randomness for 2d or 3d @xmath0-space sampling , respectively . in the latter case ,",
    "the points are randomly drawn in the plane defined by the partition and phase encoding directions so as to maintain continuous sampling in the orthogonal readout direction ( frequency encoding ) . here",
    ", the novelty relies both    on the use of randomness in all @xmath0-space dimensions , and the establishment of compressed sensing results for continuous trajectories , based on a concentration result for markov chains .",
