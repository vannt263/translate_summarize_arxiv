    "the nucleus of ngc 4151 is a well known strong x - ray source . during the exposure of a single acis frame ,",
    "two or more photons from such a high count rate x - ray source may be recorded as a single event .",
    "this is known as the `` pile - up effect '' , which causes the loss of information from the original events , resulting in a hardened source spectrum and grade migration ( davis 2001 ) .",
    "aiming to study the extended x - ray emission as close to the nucleus as possible , our observations were performed using the acis `` 1/8 sub - array '' mode ( 0.6 s frame time ) to reduce nuclear pile - up . however , pile - up is still a concern as yang et al .",
    "( 2001 ) showed that , although their observation was taken when ngc 4151 was experiencing a low flux state , pile - up still significantly affects the inner @xmath40-radius region in the acis image in the same mode .",
    "before we proceed to further imaging analysis , we must evaluate the effects of pile - up on the nuclear psf , to exclude that some of the observed features may be due to pile - up effects .",
    "we first compared the radial profiles of the observed x - ray emission to that expected from a point source . to simulate the nuclear psf , we need to know the intrinsic spectrum of the heavily piled - up nucleus .",
    "the events extracted from the acis readout streak do not suffer pile - up as the incoming photons during each frame readout were still recorded by the acis ccd with an exposure equivalent to 40 @xmath41s per frame .",
    "we used these readout events to model the spectrum of the nucleus ( wang et al .",
    "2010b ) and obtained an absorption corrected luminosity of @xmath42 erg s@xmath43 .",
    "this model was used as the input spectrum to the _ chandra _ hrma ray tracer ( chart ; carter et al .",
    "2003 ) which was run with the same observation configurations as our acis observations ( table  1 ) . the chart output was then fed into the marx simulator to project rays onto the detector and create an event file , with responses applied .",
    "we also used marx to simulate a piled event file using the @xmath035% pile - up fraction found by wang et al .",
    "( 2010b ) , in order to compare with the observed radial profiles .",
    "the effectiveness of this procedure was demonstrated by russell et al .",
    "( 2010 ) .    figure  [ fig2]a compares the observed radial profiles of the nuclear region of ngc 4151 in the 17 kev band with the simulated psf of a point - like nucleus ( with and without pile - up ) .",
    "the count rate in the brightest inner 2 arcsec region is significantly lower than the expected values without pile - up , and consistent with the psf including marx simulated pile - up .",
    "the soft ( 0.31 kev ) x - ray emission close to the nucleus is clearly resolved , both along the ne  sw and the nw  se direction . in both directions ,",
    "the soft extended emission dominates over the nuclear psf wings at radii @xmath44 from the nucleus ( figure  [ fig2]b and  [ fig2]c ) . beyond a radius of @xmath03 from the nucleus , the piled marx simulations produced essentially identical results to the simulations without pile - up , so at these larger radii pile - up is not an issue .",
    "as pile - up combines events of different energies and causes grade migration , another way to estimate the importance of pile - up is using the ratio of events with `` bad '' asca grades ( 1 , 5 , 7 ) to those with `` good '' asca grades ( 0 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 ) where a bad / good grade ratio of @xmath45 indicates that pile - up is approximately @xmath46 ( russell et al .",
    "the radial distribution of the bad / good grade ratio is shown in figure  [ fig2]d for both the 0.31 kev and the 17 kev bands , which indicates that , beyond @xmath47 from the nucleus pile - up is no longer significant in the 0.31 kev band ( and beyond @xmath48 for the 17 kev band ) .",
    "we conclude that for our analysis of the _ extended soft _ x - ray emission , the effect of pile - up is mild beyond a radius of 2 from the nucleus , and effectively absent at @xmath49 .    for imaging analysis , the major effect of pile - up on the acis on - axis",
    "psf is that , the core ( where most of the photons hit ) gets suppressed , because some piled events are rejected as bad events , creating a circular `` caldera '' ( e.g. , yang et al . 2001 ) . at the pile - up fraction of @xmath035% encountered in this observation , there is @xmath040% decrease in brightness in the core of the psf , but little distortion of its circular shape ( gaetz et al . , private communication ; see the _",
    "chandra proposers observatory guide _ [ pog ] section 6.15 . ) .",
    "thus , although we will discuss the images of extended features in the central 2 region that are affected by pile - up with caution , deviations from circular shape must be related to real x - ray emission features .",
    "_ chandra _ hrma s psf ( half - power diameter hpd=0.6 , @xmath50  kev ; see the _ chandra _ pog ) is undersampled by the acis ccd pixels ( @xmath51 ) . to take advantage of the telescope dithering to improve the sampling , a fine pixel size ( 0.0625 , @xmath01/8 of the native acis pixel size )",
    "was used when extracting the images .",
    "this subpixel binning approach is frequently adopted in imaging studies of x - ray jets pushing for the highest spatial resolution ( e.g. , harris et al .",

    "this extent is in good agreement with the overall morphology of the [ oiii ] emission ( e.g. kaiser et al .",

    "the acis images with subpixel binning ( e.g. , figures  [ fig3]a and  [ fig4]b ) reveal curvy extensions 2 away from the nucleus ( labelled as `` c '' and `` d '' ) , which are not discernable in the raw soft acis image ( figure  [ fig4]a ) .    the subpixel acis image also shows a linear feature at p.a.=235@xmath11 ( labelled as `` e '' in figure  [ fig4]b ) and discrete knots in the inner region ( on scales @xmath21 from the nucleus ) .",

    "we emphasize that although the inner 2 region is affected by pile - up (   [ pile - up ] ) in the 0.31 kev band , the acis features seen in the soft x - ray emission are not observation specific or pile - up artifacts , for the following reasons :    1 .   for the on - axis nucleus , the psf with pile - up simulated with marx is circular , thus the elongated features ( 4 across ) seen in the soft band",
    "can not be due to pile - up related psf distortion ; 2 .   using only the single pixel events ( grade 0 ) , which give the best spatial resolution and are likely to be unaffected by pileup ( ballet 1999 ; davis 2001 ) , the extended features are clearly present ( figure  [ fig4]c ) ; 3 .",
    "low pile - up acis images from _ chandra _ archival observations of ngc 4151 ( obsid 372 ) show structures of similar shape and spatial scale as the features seen in our images ( figures  [ fig4]d and e ) .",
    "because of the short frame time ( 0.1 s and 0.4 s ) and a factor of two lower nuclear flux , the estimated pile - up fraction is 6% and 11% in these observations , respectively @xcite .",
    "we also examined the hetg zero - order images of ngc 4151 . although some suffer significant pile - up due to longer frame time and a brightened nucleus ( obsid 7830 ) , extended emission along ne  sw with similar substructures as we detect is seen in obsids 335 and 7829 ; 4 .",
    "the psf - deconvolved hrc image ( figure  2 in wang et al . 2009 ) , which is not affected by pile - up , shows the same extended morphology and small - scale enhancements within 2 from the nucleus that are not seen in acis without subpixel binning .",
    "we applied two image reconstruction techniques to the acis data , the richardson - lucy ( r - l ) algorithm ( richardson 1972 ; lucy 1974 ) and the expectation through markov chain monte carlo ( emc2 ) method ( esch et al .",

    "the resemblance of the ne - sw elongation and substructures ( such as the curvy feature `` c '' and ne clump `` d '' marked in figure  [ fig3]a ) between the subpixel acis images and the deconvolved hrc strengthens our confidence that the resolved features are real .",

    "the morphology of the enhancement located 1 sw to the nucleus is also different in two reconstructed images : it is mostly a linear north - south elongation in the acis image , whereas in the hrc image it shows a tail towards sw ) .",
    "two factors may cause these discrepancies : ( 1 ) the region within 1radius of the nucleus in the acis image is affected by pile - up , but the accuracy of the piled psf on this scale has not been calibrated ; yet this inaccuracy may have an impact on the reconstructed image ; ( 2 ) hrc is sensitive to photons in the energy range of 0.110 kev , therefore may reveal real structures that are not seen in the 0.31 kev acis image .      to find regions of harder spectral index or higher x - ray obscuration , we extracted _ chandra _ images in the 0.31.0 kev and 1.02.0 kev bands and derived the counts ratio @xmath59 over @xmath60 .",
    "these bands are sensitive to hydrogen column densities of the order of @xmath61 @xmath62 , and the relative changes in the ratio map have been demonstrated to reflect variations in the x - ray absorption ( bianchi et al .",
