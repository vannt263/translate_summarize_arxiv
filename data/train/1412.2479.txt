    "in study of spin transfer torque ( stt ) , it has been proposed @xcite to manipulate magnetic order parameter dynamics by using non - equilibrium electron bath instead of external magnetic fields .",
    "the proposal has already led to commercial products in spintronics engineering .",
    "recently , there has been much attention on the `` spin - orbit torque''(sot ) , which was first proposed in theory@xcite , and later confirmed in experiments@xcite ( see ref .   for a comprehensive review ) . after applying an external electric field to the electron gas with spin - orbit interaction(soi )",
    ", a component of the accumulated electron spin density mis - aligned with the ferromagnetic ordering can be created@xcite , which then will induce a field - like torque .",
    "the sot opens the possibility of manipulating the magnetic order parameter in collinear magnetic structures and may efficiently reduce the critical current density for magnetization switching@xcite . in the theoretical side , a full quantum theory has been proposed and developed to describe the dynamics of a single domain magnet under the continuous scattering by spin - polarized electrons .",
    "the quantum stt theory recovers the results of the semiclassical stt theory , and has revealed more details about the magnetization dynamics in the stt@xcite .",
    "therefore , it will be natural to apply a full quantum theory to study the magnetization dynamics influenced by the soi electron gas",
    ". this may be an extension of the quantum stt theory to sot . in the full quantum theory ,",
    "the quantum dynamics of the magnetization can be described by the evolution of its density matrix under the influence of the electron gas , which can be tuned by the external electric field .",
    "this treatment will not only give the mean - field effect on the magnetization dynamics by the electron bath , but also include the damping of the magnetization due to the fluctuation of the electron spin .",
    "the similar strategy has been exploited to investigate the photo - excited dynamics of the order parameter in peierls chain@xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we apply density matrix technique to derive general formalism for the magnetization dynamics driven by the electron bath through s - d exchange interaction . in section iii",
    ", we apply the general formalism to the special case where the spatially uniform magnetization is coupled to a two dimensional electron gas with rashba soi , and calculate the spin - orbit torque and the damping effect of the electron bath .",
    "the main results are summarized and discussed in section iv .",

    "thus the results below will be quite general .    the effect of the s - d exchange interaction @xmath6 is twofold . on one hand , the magnetization dynamics is driven by the electron bath via @xmath6 ; on the other hand , the electron states are also affected by the magnetization configuration in turn due to @xmath6 .",
    "since the time scale of the electron dynamics is usually much faster than that of the magnetization dynamics , we may assume that the electrons under the bias voltage establish a stationary non - equilibrium distribution in a very short time interval , during which the change of the magnetization configuration is negligible and the non - equilirium electron bath is approximated to be constant .",
