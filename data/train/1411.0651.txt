    "<S> we introduce the notion of the simple connectivity at infinity of a finitely generated group ( in analogy with that for finitely presented groups ) . </S>",
    "<S> our main result is : if a finitely generated group @xmath1 contains an infinite , finitely generated , subcommensurated subgroup @xmath0 , of infinite index in @xmath1 , then @xmath1 is 1-ended and semistable at @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> if additionally , @xmath0 is finitely presented and 1-ended , then @xmath1 is simply connected at @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> a normal subgroup of a group is commensurated , so this result is a strict generalization of a number of results , including the main theorems of g. conner and m. mihalik @xcite , b. jackson @xcite , v. m. lew @xcite , m. mihalik @xciteand @xcite , and j. profio @xcite . </S>"
