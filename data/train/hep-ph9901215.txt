    "the double beta ( @xmath1 ) decay attracts the attention of both experimentalists and theoreticians for already a long period and remains of major importance both for particle and nuclear physics .",
    "the double beta decay is a second order process of weak interaction and there are few tenths of nuclear systems @xcite , which offer an opportunity to study it .",
    "the @xmath1 decay can be observed because the pairing force renders the even - even nuclei with even number of protons and neutrons more stable than the odd - odd nuclei with broken pairs .",
    "thus , the single beta decay transition from the even - even parent nucleus ( a , z ) to the neighboring odd - odd nucleus ( a , z+1 ) is forbidden energetically and the @xmath1 decay to the daughter nucleus ( a , z+2 ) is the only possible decay channel .",
    "there are different possible modes of the double beta decay , which differ from each other by the light particles accompanying the emission of two electrons .",
    "we distinguish the double beta decay modes with and without lepton number violation .",
    "the two - neutrino double beta decay ( @xmath2-decay ) , which involves the emission of two electrons and two antineutrinos , @xmath3 is a process fully consistent with the standard model ( sm ) of electroweak interaction formulated by glashow @xcite , weinberg @xcite and salam @xcite .",
    "this decay mode with obvious lepton number conservation was first considered by mayer in 1935@xcite .",
    "the inverse half - life of @xmath2-decay is free of unknown parameters on the particle physics side and is expressed as a product of a phase - space factor and the relevant @xmath2-decay nuclear matrix element .",
    "thus , the measured experimental half lifes of @xmath2-decays give us directly the value of the @xmath2-decay nuclear matrix elements . in this way",
    "@xmath2-decay offers a severe test of nuclear structure calculations .",
    "the @xmath2-decay is already well established experimentally for a couple of isotopes .",
    "the most favored for the experimental study of this rare process is the transition from the ground state @xmath4 of the initial to the ground state @xmath4 of the final nuclei because of the large energy release .",
    "but recently , increased attention is paid also for transitions to the @xmath5 and @xmath4 excited states of the final nucleus @xcite .",
    "the half - lifes of the @xmath2-decay range from @xmath6 up to @xmath7 years [ see table [ tabint.1 ] ] .",
    "direct counter experiments have observed @xmath2-decays for ground state to ground state transitions in @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "a positive evidence for a @xmath2-decay transition to the @xmath14 excited state of the final nucleus was observed for @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the geochemical experiments , which observe the double beta decay through daughter isotope excesses in natural samples has proved the existence of double beta decay in @xmath10 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the radiochemical experiment , which observes the accumulation of daughter isotopes under laboratory condition , has observed double beta decay in @xmath18 .",
    "the positive signals of geochemical and radiochemical experiments are identified with the lepton number conserving @xmath2-decay mode .",
    "the neutrinoless mode of the double beta decay ( @xmath0-decay ) ( proposed by fury in 1939 @xcite ) , which involves the emission of two electrons and no neutrinos @xmath19 is expected to occur if lepton number conservation is not an exact symmetry of nature and thus is forbidden in the sm ( standard model ) of electroweak interaction . the @xmath0-decay takes place only if the neutrino is a majorana particle ( i.e. identical to its own antiparticle ) with non - zero mass .",
    "the study of the @xmath0-decay is stimulated by the development of grand unified theories ( gut s ) @xcite representing generalization the of @xmath20 sm . in spite of the facts that the sm represents the simplest and most economical theory , which describes jointly weak and electromagnetic interactions and in spite of the fact that it has been very successful , wherever it has been tested",
    ", the sm can not answer many of the fundamental questions , e.g. : is the neutrino really massless ?",
    "if it has mass , why is this mass much smaller than that of corresponding charged leptons ?",
    "what kind of particles are neutrinos , dirac or majorana ?",
    "does neutrino mixing take place ?",
    "therefore , the sm can not be considered as the ultimative theory of nature .",
    "the non - zero neutrino masses and neutrino mixing appear naturally in many different variants of gut s like the simplest so(10 ) left - right symmetric model @xcite , minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) and their extensions .",
    "the exception is essentially the minimal su(5 ) model @xcite , which however has been practically ruled out due unsuccessful searches for nucleon instability .",
    "the expectations arising from gut s are that the conservation laws of the sm may be violated to some small degree .",
    "the gut s offer a variety of mechanisms which allow the @xmath0-decay , from which the well - known possibility is via the exchange of a majorana neutrino between the two decaying neutrons @xcite .",
    "if the global symmetry associated with lepton number conservation is broken spontaneously , the models imply the existence of a physical nambu - goldstone boson , called majoron @xcite , which couples to neutrinos .",
    "the majoron might occur in the majoron mode of the neutrinoless double beta decay @xcite : @xmath21 there are also other possible mechanisms of @xmath0-decay induced by lepton - number violating quark - lepton interactions of r - parity non - conserving extensions of the sm @xcite . a complete analysis of this mechanism within the mssm for the case the initial d - quarks are put inside the two initial neutrons ( two - nucleon susy mode )",
    "was carried in @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been found that a new contribution of the r - parity violating ( @xmath22 ) supersymmetry ( susy ) to the @xmath0 via pion exchange between the two decaying neutrons dominates over the two - nucleon @xmath22 susy mode @xcite .",
    "the r - parity conserving susy mechanisms of @xmath0-decay have been proposed and investigated in ref .",
    "the gut s predict also new type of gauge bosons called leptoquarks , which can transform quarks into leptons or vice versa @xcite .",
    "a new mechanism for @xmath0-decay based on leptoquark exchange has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-decay has not been seen experimentally till now .",
    "we note that it is easy to distinguish between the three decay modes in eqs .",
    "( [ int.1])-([int.3 ] ) in the experiment by measuring the sum of electron energies @xcite .",
    "a signal from the @xmath0-decay is expected to be a peak at the end of the electron - electron coincidence spectrums as a function of the sum of the energies of the two electrons as they carry the full available kinetic energy for this process .",
    "both , the @xmath2-decay and the @xmath23-decay modes yield a continuous electron spectrum , which differ by the position of the maximum as different numbers of light particles are present in the final state .",
    "the observation of @xmath0-decay would signal physics beyond the sm .",
    "it is worthwhile to notice that the @xmath0-decay is one of few eminent non - accelerator experiments which may probe grand unification scales far beyond present and future accelerator energies .",
    "for these reasons , considerable experimental effort is being devoted to the study of this decay mode .",
    "presently there are about 40 experiments searching for the @xmath0-decay .",
    "the best available experimental limits on the half - life of this decay mode for different nuclei are presented in table [ tabint.1 ] .",
    "the most stringent experimental lower bound for a half - life has been measured by the heidelberg - moscow collaboration for the @xmath0-decay of @xmath9 @xcite : @xmath24 the experimental half - life limits allow to extract limits on different lepton number violating parameters , e.g. effective neutrino mass , parameters of right - handed currents and parameters of supersymmetric models",
    ".    however , in order to correctly interpret the results of @xmath0-decay experiments , i.e. to obtain quantitative answers for the lepton number violating parameters , the mechanism of nuclear transitions has to be understood .",
    "this means one has to evaluate the corresponding nuclear matrix elements with high reliability .",
    "the calculation of the nuclear many - body green function governing the double beta decay transitions continues to be challenging and attracts the specialists of different nuclear models .",
    "as each mode of double beta decay requires the construction of the same many - body nuclear structure wave functions , the usual strategy has been first to try to reproduce the observed @xmath2-decay half - lifes .",
    "a comparison between theory and experiment for the @xmath2 - decay provides a measure of confidence in the calculated nuclear wave functions employed for extracting the unknown parameters from @xmath0-decay life measurements .",
    "a variety of nuclear techniques have been used in attempts to calculate the nuclear @xmath2-decay matrix elements , which require the summation over a complete set of intermediate nuclear states .",
    "it has been found and it is widely accepted that the @xmath2-decay matrix elements are strongly suppressed . the nuclear systems which can undergo double beta decay are medium and heavy open - shell nuclei with a complicated nuclear structure .",
    "the only exception is the a=48 system . within the shell model , which describes well the low - lying states in the initial and final nuclei ,",
    "it is clearly impossible to construct all the needed states of the intermediate nucleus .",
    "therefore , the proton - neutron quasiparticle random phase approximation ( pn - qrpa ) , which is one of the approximation to the many - body problem , has developed into one of the most popular methods for calculating nuclear wave functions involved in the @xmath1 decay @xcite .",
    "the qrpa plays a prominent role in the analysis , which are unaccessible to shell model calculations .",
    "the qrpa has been found successful in revealing the suppression mechanism for the @xmath2-decay @xcite .",
    "however , the predictive power of the qrpa is questionable because of the extreme sensitivity of the calculated @xmath2-decay matrix elements in the physically acceptable region on the particle - particle strength of the nuclear hamiltonian .",
    "this quenching behavior of the @xmath2-decay matrix elements is a puzzle and has attracted the attention of many theoreticians .",
    "the main drawback of the qrpa is the overestimation of the ground state correlations leading to a collapse of the qrpa ground state .",
    "several attempts have been made in the past to shift the collapse of the qrpa to higher values by proposing different alterations of the qrpa including proton - neutron pairing @xcite , higher order rpa corrections @xcite and particle number projection @xcite .",
    "but , none of them succeeded to avoid collapse of the qrpa and to reduce significantly the dependence of @xmath2-decay matrix elements on the particle - particle strength .",
    "it is because all these methods disregard the main source of the ground state instability which is traced to the assumption of the quasiboson approximation ( qba ) violating the pauli exclusion principle .",
    "recently , toivanen and suhonen have proposed a proton - neutron renormalized qrpa ( pn - rqrpa ) to study the two neutrino @xcite and schwieger , simkovic and faessler the @xmath25 decay @xcite . in these works",
    "the pauli exclusion principle is taken into account more carefully .",
    "the pn - rqrpa prevents to build too strong ground state correlations and avoids the collapse of the pn - rqrpa solution that plaque the pn - qrpa .",
    "the @xmath2-decay matrix elements calculated within pn - rqrpa and pn - rqrpa with proton - neutron pairing ( full - rqrpa ) @xcite has been found significantly less sensitive to the increasing strength of the particle - particle interaction in comparison with pn - qrpa results . in the meanwhile ,",
    "some critical studies have discussed the shortcomings of rqrpa like the violation of the ikeda sum rule @xcite and particle number non - conservation in average in respect to the correlated ground states in the double beta decay @xcite .    a large amount of theoretical work has been done to calculate nuclear matrix elements and decay rates .",
    "however , the mechanism which is leading to the suppression of these matrix elements is still not completely understood .",
    "the practical calculation always involves some approximations , which make it difficult to obtain an unambiguous decay rate .",
    "the calculation of the @xmath2-decay nuclear transition continues to be subject of interest , which stimulates the rapid development of different approaches to the many - body problem , e.g. shell model and qrpa .",
    "the aim of this review is to present some of the most recent developments in the field of the double beta decay .",
    "let us note that several other review articles treating the problem of double beta decay already exist .",
    "the theory and the experimental status of double beta decay have been reviewed e.g. by primakoff and rosen ( 1981 ) @xcite , boehm and vogel ( 1984 ) @xcite , haxton and stephenson ( 1984 ) @xcite , schepkin ( 1984 ) @xcite , doi et al ( 1985 ) @xcite , vergados ( 1986 ) @xcite , avignone and brodzinski ( 1988 ) @xcite , grotz and klapdor @xcite , tomoda ( 1991 ) @xcite , and moe and vogel ( 1994 ) @xcite .",
    "the neutrino remains a puzzle .",
    "the neutrino is the only elementary particle , which basic properties are not known till today . in contrast with the charged fermions the nature and the masses of the neutrinos has not yet been established phenomenologically .",
    "the neutrino can be like other fermions a dirac particle , i.e. is different from its antiparticle .",
    "however , there is an another possibility proposed long ago by majorana @xcite .",
    "the neutrino is the only fermion which can be a majorana particle , i.e. it is identical to its antiparticle .",
    "this distinction is important if the mass of neutrino is non - zero .",
    "it is worthwhile to notice that there is no principle , which dictates neutrinos to be massless particles as it is postulated in the sm .",
    "if the neutrinos are particles with definite mass , it is natural to suppose that neutrino mixing does take place .",
    "this was first considered by pontecorvo @xcite .",
    "it means that flavor neutrino fields in the weak interaction lagrangian are a mixture of fields of neutrinos possessing definite masses .",
    "unlike of only one possible scheme for quark mixing there exist several totally different schemes of neutrinos mixing as the neutrino is electrically neutral .",
    "the number of massive neutrinos depends on the considered scheme of neutrino mixing and varies from three to six .",
    "the problem of neutrino masses and mixing is very important for understanding of fundamental issues of elementary particle physics and astrophysics and has been treated in numerous review articles , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the investigation of neutrino properties is a way to discover new physics beyond the sm .",
    "however , the problem of neutrino masses and mixing is still far of being solved .",
    "the finite mass of neutrinos is related to the problem of lepton flavor violation .",
    "the sm strictly conserves lepton flavor but the gut extensions of the sm violate lepton flavor at some level .",
    "the lepton flavor violation has been discussed in several review articles @xcite .    by using the flavor fields @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 ( the indices l and r refer to the left - handed and right - handed chirality states , respectively , and the superscript @xmath30 refers to the operation of charge conjugation ) one can construct dirac , majorana and dirac - majorana neutrino mass lagrangian s : @xmath31 + h.c . \\label{mass.3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here the index @xmath32 and @xmath33 take the values @xmath34 .",

    "are connected with the three dirac neutrino mass eigenstates as follows : @xmath39 here u is a unitary matrix and @xmath40 is the field of the dirac neutrino with mass @xmath41 .",
    "the mixing of neutrinos generated by dirac mass term is analogous to the mixing of quarks described by the cabbibo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix .",
    "it is evident that lepton flavor is violated in the theories with a dirac mass term , if the matrix @xmath36 is not diagonal , i.e. additive partial lepton numbers of electronic ( @xmath42 ) , muonic ( @xmath43 ) and tauonic ( @xmath44 ) type are not conserved . however , the dirac mass term is invariant in respect to the global gauge transformation @xmath45 , @xmath46 ( @xmath47 is arbitrary ) what implies the conservation of the total lepton number @xmath48 .",

    "another reason can be the omission of the spin - orbit partners .",
    "recently , it has been found that there is a destructive interference between `` spin - flip '' and `` non spin - flip '' contributions to the @xmath2-decay transition leading to the suppression of @xmath2-decay matrix elements @xcite .",
    "in addition the matrix elements obtained within the shell model can be suppressed by the renormalization of the gamow - teller operators in order to account for about @xmath292 quenching of the beta decay strength .",
    "till now , the origin of this quenching phenomenon is not well understood and can be explained by a number of reasons , e.g. by influence of many - particle configurations or by the renormalization of axial vector and vector weak interactions constants due to nuclear medium effects leading to @xmath293 .      the pn - qrpa has been found to be a powerful model , considering its simplicity , to describe nuclear matrix elements in ordinary beta decay .",
    "in addition , the qrpa can handle of great number of intermediate states .",
    "therefore , the pn - qrpa has been the most frequently used nuclear structure method to deal with the nuclear structure aspects of the @xmath1 decay for open shell systems [ see e.g. @xcite ] . in the double beta decay the initial nucleus decays to final nucleus through virtual excitations of all states of the intermediate nucleus .",
    "the excited states are obtained by solving the well - known qrpa equations , which yield all excited states of a given even - even nucleus .",
    "the advantage of the qrpa calculation in respect to the shell model approach is that it can be performed in large model spaces .",
    "the qrpa produces a considerably smaller number of states than the shell model as it is based on a harmonic approximation .",
    "a shortcoming of the pn - qrpa is that it frequently overestimates the ground state correlations , leading to instabilities and finally to collapse of the qrpa solution .",
    "the collapse is caused by generation of too many correlations with increasing strength of the attractive proton - neutron interaction .",
    "unfortunately , the physical value of this force is usually close to the point in which the qrpa solutions collapse .",
    "this behavior has its origin in the quasi - boson approximation ( qba ) violating the pauli exclusion principle and causing the qrpa excitation operators behave like bosons @xcite .",

    "it is an improvement over the commonly used qrpa approach .",
    "an improved description of the complete set of the intermediate nuclear states , which are needed for the calculation of double beta decay , can possibly also be obtained with growing computer power for example in the shell model approach .",
    "additional experimental information about the @xmath2-decay and related processes is of great interest .",
    "we note that the nemo experiment allows to perform a precise measurement also of the energy and angular distributions of the outgoing electrons .",
    "further , there is a chance to detect the @xmath2-decay to the excited @xmath4 and @xmath5 states of the final nucleus at the level of @xmath428-@xmath429 years with present low - background detectors .",
    "new @xmath1 experiments are planned by the detection of the capture of two bound atomic electrons @xcite .",
    "a recent theoretical analysis has shown that the experimental measurement of the double beta decay induced in a neutrino beam can be feasible due to an enhancement due to a resonance in the corresponding amplitude @xcite .",
    "such an experiment is planned for the double beta decay at the kurchatow institute @xcite .",
    "these future experiments are important because they complement the known informations from the conventional @xmath2-decay .",
    "the @xmath0-decay is a powerful tool for the study of lepton number conservation in general . in particular",
    ", it contributes to the search for the majorana neutrino mass , the heavy w - boson ( mainly responsible for a possible right - handed weak interaction ) , the @xmath22 susy and leptoquarks on the sensitivity level competitive to large hadron colliders .",
    "we remind that the study of rare decays at low energy is complementary to high energy physics experiments .",
    "searches for double beta decay are pursued actively for different nuclear isotopes , but the @xmath0-decay has been not yet observed , experimentally .",
    "the currently laboratory upper limits on the half - life provide severe constraints on the effective majorana neutrino mass @xmath390 , on parameters of the left - right symmetric models @xmath181 and @xmath173 , on the effective majoron coupling constant @xmath391 , on the @xmath198-parity violating coupling constant @xmath422 and on the the inverse effective mass of heavy neutrinos @xmath430 as follows : @xmath431 the uncertainty of these parameters is due to the ambiguity of nuclear matrix elements .",
    "the above limits constitute our most stringent test of the lepton number conservation .",
    "it is worthwhile to notice that the @xmath0-decay imposes very restrictive bounds on the lepton number violating sector of r - parity violating susy models .",
    "the upper limit on @xmath422 ( deduced from the pion - exchange @xmath22 susy mode for the @xmath0-decay @xcite ) , is significantly stronger than those previously known or expected from the ongoing accelerator experiments . the @xmath0-decay constraints on lepton number violating parameters in eq .",
    "( [ out.1 ] ) must be taken into account by theoreticians , when they build new theories of grand unification .    in the @xmath0-decay",
    "it is still possible to improve the existing limits .",
    "the extension of the ongoing experiments : elegant ( @xmath8 ) @xcite , heidelberg - moscow ( @xmath9 ) @xcite , nemo ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) @xcite , the @xmath17 cryogenic experiment @xcite and caltech neuchatel tpc @xmath432 @xcite is expected to reach the level of 0.1 ev . the prospect for exploration of susy in the next generation of the @xmath0-decay experiments have been discussed in @xcite .",
    "recently , a new project genius for the measurement of the @xmath0-decay of @xmath9 have been proposed , which suppose to probe neutrino masses down to @xmath433-@xmath434 ev by using 1 ton of enriched @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "if the @xmath0-decay will be discovered , it would be a major achievement , which would initiate new experimental activities both for rare decays at low - energies and also at high energy accelerator facilities .",
    "in the case that the lepton number violation is out of reach of near future @xmath0-decay experiments , the improved upper limits will yield more stringent constraints for the grand unified theories and super symmetric ( susy ) models .",
