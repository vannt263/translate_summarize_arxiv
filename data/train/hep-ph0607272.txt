    "within the standard model ( sm ) the neutrinos are massless and hence there is no cp violation in the lepton ( l ) sector .",
    "the current evidence  @xcite from the neutrino oscillation experiments , on the other hand , suggest that neutrinos are massive , however small , and they mix up . the goal of the present neutrino oscillation experiments is to determine the nine degrees of freedom in the low energy neutrino mass matrix .",
    "they are parametrized by three masses , three mixing angles and three cp violating phases out of which two are majorana and one is dirac . at present the neutrino oscillation experiments able to measure the two mass square differences , the solar and the atmospheric , and three mixing angles with varying degrees of precision , while there is no information about the phases .    assuming that the neutrinos are of majorana type the small masses of the physical left handed neutrinos",
    "can be explained by the elegant seesaw mechanism  @xcite which involves singlet right - handed neutrinos ( type - i seesaw ) or triplet higgs ( type - ii seesaw ) or can be both ( hybrid seesaw ) . in the present article we limit ourselves to the case of type - i seesaw models .",
    "although we call them right - handed neutrinos , in the extensions of the sm they are just singlet fermions that transform trivially under the sm gauge group .",
    "so , there is no apparent reasons for the number of heavy singlet neutrinos to be same as the number of left - handed neutrinos .",
    "so , for the main part of our discussions we restrict ourselves to only two right - handed neutrinos .",
    "these results will also be true when there are three right - handed neutrinos , but the third right - handed neutrino do not mix with the other two neutrinos .",
    "we start with three right - handed neutrinos and after some general comments work mostly with two right - handed neutrinos .    while there is no information about the absolute mass scales of the physical neutrinos ,",
    "the currently discovered tiny mass scales ; the atmospheric neutrino mass ( @xmath0 ) in the @xmath1 oscillation and the solar neutrino mass ( @xmath2 ) in the @xmath3 oscillation , can be explained by adding at least two right handed neutrinos to the sm lagrangian . however , with two right - handed neutrinos the seesaw mechanism predicts one of the physical light neutrino mass to be exactly zero which is permissible within the current knowledge of neutrino masses and mixings .",
    "the majorana mass of the right - handed neutrino violates @xmath4-number and hence is a natural source of l - asymmetry in the early universe  @xcite . a partial l - asymmetry",
    "is then converted to baryon ( b ) asymmetry through the non - perturbative sphaleron processes , unsuppressed above the electroweak phase transition .",
    "currently the @xmath5-asymmetry has been measured precisely by the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap)@xcite and is given by @xmath6    it is legitimate to ask if there are any connecting links between leptogenesis and the cp violation in the low energy leptonic sector , in particular neutrino oscillation and neutrinoless double beta decay .",
    "in the context of three right - handed neutrino models several attempts have been taken in the literature to connect the cp violation in leptogenesis and neutrino oscillations  @xcite .",
    "it is found that there are almost no links between these two phenomena unless one considers special assumptions  @xcite .",
    "in fact it is shown that leptogenesis can be possible irrespective of the cp violation at low energy  @xcite . on the other hand , in the two right - handed neutrino models",
    "there is a ray of hope connecting leptogenesis with the cp violation in neutrino oscillation  @xcite and neutrinoless double beta decay processes .",
    "while the magnitude of cp violation is fairly known in the quark sector , it is completely shaded in the leptonic sector of the sm .",
    "therefore , searching for cp violation in the leptonic sector is of great interest in the present days .",
    "it has been pointed out that the dirac phase , being involved in the l - number conserving processes , can be measured in the long baseline neutrino oscillation experiments  @xcite , while the majorana phase , being involved in the l - number violating processes , can be investigated in the neutrinoless double beta decay  @xcite processes .    at present the magnitude of b - asymmetry",
    "is precisely known , while the sign of this asymmetry is not known yet . however , by knowing the cp violating phases in the leptonic mixing matrix one can determine the sign of the b - asymmetry .",
    "this is the study taken up in this work .",
    "we consider a minimal extension of the sm by including two singlet right - handed neutrinos which are sufficient to explain the present knowledge of neutrino masses and mixings .",
    "we adopt a general parameterization of the neutrino dirac yukawa coupling and give the possible links between the cp violation in leptogenesis and neutrino oscillation , cp violation in neutrinoless double beta decay and leptogenesis .",
    "it is shown that the knowledge of low energy cp violating re - phasing invariants can indeed determine the sign of the b - asymmetry since the size of this asymmetry is known precisely .",
    "rest of the manuscript is arranged as follows . in section",
    "ii we elucidate the canonical seesaw in the framework of three right handed neutrinos .",
    "we then display the possible links between leptogenesis and the low energy cp - violating phases appearing in the leptonic mixing matrix in certain special circumstances .",
    "it is found that there are almost no links between these two phenomena occurring at two different energy scales .",
    "therefore , in section iii we give a parameterization of @xmath7 in the two right - handed neutrino models . in section",
    "iv we calculate the neutrino masses and mixings by using the parameterization of @xmath7 given in section iii . in section",
    "v we estimate the cp violation in leptogenesis . in section",
    "vi we consider the re - phasing invariant formalism to study the possible links between the cp violating phases responsible for leptogenesis and the cp violation at low energy phenomena .",
    "first we calculate th cp violation in neutrino oscillation and then elucidate its link to leptogenesis .",
    "after that we calculate the cp violation in low energy lepton number violating process , i.e. , the neutrinoless double beta decay , and then elucidate its link to leptogenesis .",
    "we conclude in section vii .",
    "to account for the small neutrino masses we extend the sm by including right - handed neutrinos .",
    "the corresponding leptonic lagrangian is given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 runs from 1 to 3 , representing the left - handed fields .",
    "@xmath11 represent the right handed neutrino indices .",
    "@xmath12 represents the @xmath13 doublets , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are right - handed singlets of the theory .    after the electroweak symmetry breaking the canonical seesaw  @xcite gives the effective neutrino mass matrix @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the dirac mass matrix of the neutrinos with @xmath18 is the vev of sm higgs and that of @xmath19 is the mass matrix of right handed neutrinos . without loss of generality",
    "we consider @xmath19 to be diagonal and in this basis @xmath7 contains rest of the physical parameters that appears in @xmath20 .",
    "the diagonalization of @xmath21 , through the lepton flavor mixing matrix @xmath22  @xcite , gives us three masses of the physical neutrinos .",

    "the two physical phases @xmath31 and @xmath32 associated with the majorana character of neutrinos are not relevant for neutrino oscillations .",
    "thus we see that there are three phases in the low energy effective theory responsible for cp violation",

    "the mass matrix @xmath7 can be given as @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are @xmath43 unitary matrices .",

    "there will be cp violation at low energy as we shall see below .",
    "the light neutrino mass matrix is given by @xmath57 so that the pmns matrix will become @xmath58 thus both the dirac and majorana phases at low energy are non - vanishing .",
