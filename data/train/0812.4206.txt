    "_ safety _ and _ security _ are key issues for the design and operation of a distributed system ; see , e.g. , @xcite or ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 7 ) . indeed , with the unprecedented advent of the internet , there is a growing interest to formalize , design and analyze distributed systems prone to _ malicious attacks _ and ( _ non - malicious _ ) _ defenses_. a new dimension stems from the fact that internet _",
    "servers _ and _ clients _ are controlled by _ selfish _ agents whose interest is the local maximization of their own benefits rather than the optimization of global performance @xcite .",
    "so , it is a challenging task to formalize and analyze the _ simultaneous _ impact of selfish and malicious behavior of internet agents ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .    in this work ,",
    "a distributed system is modeled as a graph @xmath1 ; nodes represent the _ hosts _ and edges represent the _ links_. an _ attacker",
    "_ represents a _ virus _ ; it is a malicious client that targets a host to destroy .",
    "a _ defender _ is a non - malicious server representing the _ antivirus software _ implemented on a subnetwork in order to protect all hosts thereby connected .",
    "here is the rationale and motivation for these modeling choices :    * associating attacks with nodes makes sense since computer security attacks are often directed to individual hosts such as commercial and public sector entities . *",
    "associating defenses with edges is motivated by _ network edge security _",
    "@xcite ; this is a recently proposed , distributed _ firewall architecture _ where antivirus software , rather than being statically installed and licensed at a host , is implemented by a _ distributed algorithm _ running on a subnetwork .",
    "such distributed implementations are attractive since they offer increased fault - tolerance and the benefit of sharing the licensing costs to the hosts . + we focus here on the simplest possible case where the subnetwork is just a _ single _ link ; a precise understanding of the mathematical pitfalls of attacks and defenses for this simplest case is a necessary prerequisite to mastering the general case .    in reality ,",
    "malicious attackers are _ independent _ ; each ( financially motivated ) attacker tries to maximize on her own the amount of harm it causes during her lifetime ( cf .",
    "hence , it is natural to model each attacker as a strategic _ player _ seeking to maximize the chance of escaping the antivirus software ; so , the strategy of one attacker does not ( directly ) affect the payoff of another .",
    "in contrast , there are at least three approaches to modeling the defenses :    * defenses are _ not _ strategic ; this approach would imply the ( _ centralized _ ) optimization problem of computing locations for the defenders that maximize the system protection given that attackers are strategic .",
    "* defenses are strategic and they _ cooperate _ to maximize the number of trapped viruses .",
    "this is modeled by assuming a _ single _",
    "( strategic ) defender , which centrally chooses multiple links .",
    "this approach has been pursued in @xcite .",
    "* defenses are strategic but _ non - cooperative _ ; so , each defender still tries to maximize the number of trapped viruses she catches , while competing with the other defenders .",
    "we have chosen to adopt the third approach .",
    "our choice of approach is motivated as follows :    * in a large network , the defense policies are _ independent _ and _ decentralized_. hence , it may be not so realistic to assume that a _ centralized _ ( even selfish ) entity coordinates all defenses .",
    "* there are financial incentives offered by hosts to defense mechanisms on the basis of the number of sustained attacks ; consider , for example , the following scenaria : * * prices for antivirus software are determined through _ recommendation systems _ , which collect data from networks where scrutinized hosts were witnessed .",
    "such price incentives induce a competition among defenders , resulting to non - cooperation . * * think of a _ network owner _ interested in maximizing the network protection . towards that end ,",
    "the owner has subcontracted the protection task to a set of independent , deployable agents .",
    "clearly , each such agent tries to optimize the protection she offers in order to increase her reward ; again , this manifests non - cooperation .",
    "we materialize the assumption that defenses are independent and non - cooperative on the basis of an intuitive _ reward - sharing _ scheme : whenever more than one colocated defenders are extinguishing the attacker(s ) targeting a host , each defender will be rewarded with the _ fair share _ of the number of attackers extinguished .",
    "so , each defender is modeled as a strategic player seeking to maximize her _ total _",
    "fair share to the number of extinguished attackers .",
    "we assume two selfish species with @xmath2 attackers and @xmath3 defenders ; both species may use mixed strategies . note that @xmath3 is proportional to the real cost of purchasing and installing several units of ( licensed ) antivirus software .",
    "the very special but yet highly non - trivial case with a single defender was originally introduced in  @xcite and further studied in  @xcite . in a _",
    "nash equilibrium _",
    "@xcite , no player can unilaterally increase her ( expected ) _",
    "utility_.    to evaluate nash equilibria , we employ the _ defense - ratio _ ; this is the ratio of the optimum number @xmath2 over the expected number of attackers extinguished by the defenders ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . motivated by _ best - case _ nash equilibria and the _ price of stability _",
    "@xcite , we introduce _ defense - optimal _ nash equilibria where the defense - ratio attains the value @xmath4 ( definition [ defense optimal nash equilibrium ] ) ; we choose this value since we observe that it is a ( tight ) lower bound on defense - ratio ( corollary [ lower bound on defense ratio ] ) .",
    "( contrast defense - optimal nash equilibria and the smallest possible defense - ratio to _ worst - case _ nash equilibria and the _ price of anarchy _ from the seminal work of koutsoupias and papadimitriou  @xcite . ) a _ defense - optimal _ graph ( for a given @xmath3 ) is one that admits a defense - optimal nash equilibrium .",
    "we are interested in the possibility of achieving , and the complexity of computing , a defense - optimal nash equilibrium for a _ given _ number of defenders @xmath3 .",
    "we discover that this possibility and the associated complexity depend on @xmath3 in a quantitatively subtle way : they are determined by two graph - theoretic thresholds for @xmath3 , namely @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( the size of a _ minimum edge cover _ ) .",
    "( recall that @xmath7 . )",
    "our chief tool is a combinatorial characterization of the associated nash equilibria we obtain ( proposition [ characterization of nash equilibria ] ) . for pure nash equilibria where both species use pure strategies ,",
    "this characterization yields some interesting necessary graph - theoretic conditions for nash equilibria ( proposition [ necessary condition for pure nash equilibria ] ) .",
    "furthermore , this characterization yields some sufficient conditions for defense - optimal nash equilibria ( theorems [ lemma one ] and [ defender pure is defense optimal ] ) .",
    "our end findings are as follows :    * when either @xmath8 or @xmath9 , there _ are _ cases allowing for a defense - optimal nash equilibrium .",
    "* * we provide a combinatorial characterization of defense - optimal graphs ( theorem  [ characterization of defense optimal graphs ] ) , which points out an interesting connection to _ fractional _ ( _ perfect _ ) _ matchings _  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 2 ) . roughly speaking ,",
    "these graphs make a strict subset of the class of graphs with a fractional perfect matching : for a defense - optimal graph , and assuming that @xmath10 , it is possible to partition _ some _ fractional perfect matching of it into @xmath3 smaller , _ vertex - disjoint _ fractional perfect matchings so that the total weight ( inherited from the original fractional perfect matching ) in each partite is equal to @xmath11 ( theorem  [ characterization of defense optimal graphs ] ) .",
    "call such a fractional perfect matching a _ @xmath3-partitionable fractional perfect matching _ ; this is a previously unconsidered , combinatorial concept in _ fractional graph theory",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "+ we prove that the recognition problem for the class of graphs with a @xmath3-partitionable fractional perfect matching is @xmath12-complete ( corollary [ fractional perfect matching theo npcompleteness1 ] ) ; this intractability result holds for an _ arbitrary _ value of @xmath3 .",
    "hence , so is the decision problem for a defense - optimal nash equilibrium @xmath13 ( corollary  [ fractional perfect matching theo npcompleteness ] ) . to establish the @xmath0-completeness of the recognition problem",
    ", we develop some techniques for the reduction of fractional ( perfect ) matchings ( section [ fractional perfect matchings section ] ) ; these may be of independent interest .",
    "+ we note that the recognition problem for the class of graphs with a @xmath3-partitionable fractional perfect matching simultaneously generalizes a tractable and an intractable recognition problem : the first one concerns the class of graphs with a perfect matching @xcite , while the second concerns the class of graphs whose vertex set can be partitioned into triangles ( * ? ? ?",
    "* gt11 ) . + a further interesting number - theoretic consequence of the combinatorial characterization we have derived for defense - optimal graphs @xmath14 is that @xmath3 divides @xmath15 in a defense - optimal graph ( corollary [ defense optimal graphs corollary ] ) .",
    "+ on the positive side , we identify another restriction of the class of graphs with a fractional perfect matching that are defense - optimal in certain , well - characterized cases ( theorem  [ perfect matching few defenders characterization ] ) ; these are the graphs with a _",
    "perfect matching_. * * we identify two cases where there are defense - optimal nash equilibria with a special structure , namely the _ vertex - balanced _",
    "nash equilibria ( definition [ defender - pure vertex - balanced profile definition ] ) ; their structure enables their polynomial time computation ( theorems  [ defender pure balanced equilibria ] and  [ pure balanced equilibria ] ) .",
    "the two corresponding algorithms rely on the efficient computation of _ minimum edge cover _ ; the second algorithm requires some relation between @xmath3 and @xmath2 ( namely , that @xmath16 divides @xmath2 ) .",
    "* we provide a combinatorial proof that there is _ no _ defense - optimal graph for @xmath17 ( theorem  [ impossibility result for many defenders ] ) .",
    "this is somehow paradoxical since with fewer defenders @xmath18 , we already identified cases with a defense - optimal nash equilibrium .",
    "however , since the defense - ratio in a defense - optimal nash equilibrium has a transition around the value @xmath19 , this paradox may not be wholly surprising .",
    "our techniques have identified several new classes of graphs for any arbitrary pair of values of @xmath3 and @xmath2 , such as graphs with @xmath3-partitionable fractional perfect matching , defense - optimal graphs and _ pure graphs _ ( which admit pure nash equilibria ) ; each such class was defined to support the existence of some nash equilibria with a particular structure ( for example , defense - optimal nash equilibrium or pure nash equilibrium ) .",
    "our results have revealed a fine structure among these classes , which is summarized in figure [ statusfigure ] .",
    "we emphasize that the assumption of @xmath20 defenders has required a far more challenging combinatorial and graph - theoretic analysis than those used for the case of a single defender in  @xcite .",
    "hence , we view this work as a major generalization of the work in  @xcite towards the more realistic case of @xmath20 defenders .",
    "the notion of defense - ratio generalizes a corresponding definition from  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 3.4 ) to the case of @xmath21 defenders .",
    "the special case where @xmath22 of theorem  [ characterization of defense optimal graphs ] was considered in  ( * ? ? ? * corollary 2 ) ; this case allowed for a polynomial time algorithm to decide the existence of ( and compute ) a defense - optimal nash equilibrium by reduction to the recognition problem for a graph with a fractional perfect matching .",
    "in contrast , the decision problem for a defense - optimal nash equilibrium @xmath23for an arbitrary @xmath24 is @xmath0-complete ( corollary  [ fractional perfect matching theo npcompleteness ] ) .    schechter and smith @xcite considered the complementary question of determining the minimum number of defenders to catch a _",

    "<S> in a distributed system with _ attacks _ and _ defenses , _ both _ attackers _ and _ defenders _ are self - interested entities . we assume a _ reward - sharing _ scheme among _ interdependent _ defenders ; each defender wishes to ( locally ) maximize her own total _ fair share _ to the attackers extinguished due to her involvement ( and possibly due to those of others ) . </S>",

    "<S> _ defense - optimal _ nash equilibrium , the defense - ratio is optimized .    </S>",
    "<S> we discover that the possibility of optimizing the defense - ratio ( in a nash equilibrium ) depends in a subtle way on how the number of defenders compares to two natural graph - theoretic thresholds we identify . in this vein , </S>",
    "<S> we obtain , through a combinatorial analysis of nash equilibria , a collection of trade - off results :    * when the number of defenders is either sufficiently small or sufficiently large , there are cases where the defense - ratio can be optimized . </S>",
    "<S> the optimization problem is computationally tractable for a large number of defenders ; the problem becomes @xmath0-complete for a small number of defenders and the intractability is inherited from a previously unconsidered combinatorial problem in _ fractional graph theory_. * perhaps paradoxically , there is a middle range of values for the number of defenders where optimizing the defense - ratio is never possible . </S>"
