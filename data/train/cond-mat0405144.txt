    "for more than a decade , extensive studies have been devoted to clarifying how the electronic structure evolves in filling - controlled metal - insulator transition ( mit ) systems in the presence of strong electron correlation,@xcite stimulated by the discovery of high-@xmath13 superconductivity in the cuprates .",
    "empirically , many three - dimensional perovskite - type 3@xmath14-transition - metal oxides become insulators when the band filling approaches an integer number.@xcite for example , la@xmath15sr@xmath1tio@xmath16 shows a filling - controlled mit at @xmath17 ; the electron effective mass @xmath18 is enhanced on approaching the metal - insulator phase boundary from the metallic side.@xcite simultaneously , the quasiparticle ( qp ) band at the chemical potential @xmath4 becomes narrower , and the spectral weight is transferred from the qp band to the lower hubbard band.@xcite in a two - dimensional system la@xmath19sr@xmath1cuo@xmath20 , on the other hand , the effective mass @xmath18 decreases towards the metal - insulator phase boundary , a pseudogap in the normal state is formed and eventually evolves into the mott insulating gap.@xcite in order to induce the relationship between the dimensionality and the behavior of the electronic states near mit , it is necessary to study the electronic structure of other two - dimensional filling - controlled systems .",
    "in addition , when we discuss the behavior of the filling - controlled mit , we should also consider the effect of structural disorder , which is inevitably introduced into the system by atom substitution to realize the filling control . under the influence of disorder in real systems,@xcite a small number of doped carriers are necessarily anderson - localized and thus feel a long - range coulomb interaction .",
    "the above factors intricately involved in the mit of correlated systems should be seriously considered , since a variety of phenomena including high-@xmath13 superconductivity and colossal magnetoresistance appear near the filling - controlled mit .",
    "recently , filling control over a very wide doping range encompassing both electron and hole doping has been realized in a two - dimensional  misfit - layer \" compound system la@xmath0a@xmath1vs@xmath2 ( a = sr or pb).@xcite the crystal structure is composed of alternately stacking las and vs@xmath21 layers.@xcite while the structure of the las layer is a distorted rock - salt type , the vs@xmath21 layer forms a two - dimensional triangular lattice of the v atoms which are octahedrally surrounded by s atoms",
    ". therefore , while the lattice constants of las and vs@xmath21 layers may be commensurate in one direction , they are inevitably incommensurate in the other direction . remarkably , both electron doping ( @xmath22 ) and hole doping ( @xmath23 ) are possible within the single system , and therefore la@xmath0a@xmath1vs@xmath2 is an unique system for studying the filling - controlled mit . according to the electrical resistivity",
    "measurement,@xcite the system become most insulating when the substitution @xmath3 approaches @xmath24 , where the triply degenerated @xmath25 orbitals of v 3@xmath14 are filled by two electrons . assuming that the doped hole concentration @xmath26 is given by @xmath27 ( and hence that the doped electron concentration is given by @xmath28 ) , the holes and electrons are doped up to @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "also the hall coefficient and thermoelectric power measurements@xcite have indicated that the carrier density decreases towards the insulating limit @xmath7 and the carrier changes its sign between @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "furthermore , those two transport properties are considerably temperature dependent in a similar way to the high-@xmath13 cuprates .",
    "another similarity to the cuprates is that the low - temperature electronic specific - heat coefficient @xmath33 _ diminishes _ towards the mott insulating state.@xcite in the insulating phase of la@xmath0a@xmath1vs@xmath2 , a nonmagnetic behavior has been indicated by a nuclear - magnetic - resonance ( nmr ) study.@xcite lattice distortions in the insulating sample @xmath34 are suggested by anomalies at @xmath35 k in the temperature dependence of the thermal dilatation and the ultrasound velocity.@xcite    in the present study , the electronic structure of la@xmath0pb@xmath1vs@xmath2 is systematically studied by means of photoemission spectroscopy .",
    "we have investigated the chemical - potential shift with carrier - doping , and the doping and temperature dependence of the density of states ( dos ) of the v 3@xmath14 band .",
    "we also discuss possible effects of structural disorder under strong electron correlations near the mit .",
    "polycrystalline samples of la@xmath0pb@xmath1vs@xmath2 ( @xmath36 , and 0.35 ) were prepared by sintering a mixture of la@xmath21s@xmath16 , pb , v , and s powders at 1050 @xmath37 1150 @xmath38c . x - ray powder - diffraction patterns indicated that single - phase samples were obtained.@xcite details of the sample preparation are described elsewhere.@xcite high - resolution photoemission spectroscopy was performed for the valence band , using a gammadata - scienta ses-2002 hemispherical electron - energy analyzer and a gammadata - scienta vuv-5010 helium discharge lamp .",
    "the overall instrumental resolution was 4 mev including the natural width of the excitation source .",
    "the base pressure in the spectrometer chamber was about @xmath39 torr .",
    "clean surfaces were obtained by scraping _ in situ _ with a diamond file .",
    "all the spectra were recorded within 90 and 60 min after scraping at @xmath40 k and @xmath12 k , respectively , so that the signals of broad spectral features around @xmath41 ev and @xmath42 ev due to surface contamination became inappreciable .",
    "also x - ray photoemission spectroscopy ( xps ) and x - ray absorption spectroscopy ( xas ) were performed for core levels .",
    "the xps spectra were collected using a double - pass cylindrical - mirror analyzer , using the mg k @xmath43 line ( @xmath44 ev ) .",

    "spectral weight near @xmath4 is depressed for all the compositions.,width=257 ]    the energy shift of the s 3@xmath50 band can be accurately determined from the valence - band spectra , because we find that the spectral shape of the s 3@xmath50 band remains virtually unchanged except for a rigid energy shift with pb substitution @xmath3 .",
    "although it appears that the intensity of the secondary background slightly changes with samples in the lower kinetic - energy region ( @xmath52 ev ) , the secondary background hardly affects the spectra in the higher kinetic - energy region ( @xmath53 ev ) .",
    "figures  [ s3pshift](a ) and [ s3pshift](b ) show that the spectra of the leading edge of the s @xmath54 peak have almost identical curve in a wide energy range for all the compositions .",

    "( b ) energy shifts of the leading edge , the peak , and the tail of the v @xmath58 band . while the spectral shape of v @xmath58 band gradually changes with @xmath3 ,",
    "a discontinuous energy shift has also been observed for v @xmath58 between @xmath6 and 0.17.,width=302 ]    the rigid - band - like shift of the s 3@xmath50 band is most likely due to the shift of the chemical potential @xmath4 with carrier doping . in order to confirm this ,",
    "the energy shifts of the core levels have been measured as in the previous studies on other filling - controlled materials.@xcite as shown in fig .",
    "[ corelevelshift ] , the la , pb , and s core levels follow the shift of the s 3@xmath50 valence band within experimental uncertainties . on the other hand ,",
    "the v core level is shifted in the opposite direction , i.e. , towards higher binding energies with hole doping .",
    "this shift is caused by the extra contributions from the varying number of transition - metal @xmath14 electrons , so - called chemical shift , as in the cases of the other filling - controlled materials.@xcite as shown by the plot at the bottom of fig .",
    "[ corelevelshift ] , the energy difference between v 2@xmath50 and s 3@xmath50 , @xmath60 shows nearly linear dependence on @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , the observed v 2@xmath50 shift is decomposed into two components : one is the shift which is linear in @xmath3 and the other is the shift which is common to all the core levels and the valence band .",
    "the former shift is proportional to the v valence and the latter common shift should reflect the shift of the chemical potential . here ,",
    "the changes in the madelung potential upon substituting pb for la does not account for the experimental result , because they should be different between the different atomic sites , particularly between the cations and anions .",
    "the present result is remarkably similar to the cases of the other filling - controlled systems in that all the core levels except for the core level of the transition - metal element are shifted by the same amount owing to the chemical - potential shift.@xcite    thus , we identify the energy shift of the s 3@xmath50 valence band shown in fig .",
    "[ s3pshift](c ) as representing the chemical - potential shift .",
    "then , one may find that the chemical potential is abruptly shifted by @xmath61 ev between @xmath6 and 0.17 .",
    "it is difficult to use the v @xmath58 band as a direct measure of the chemical - potential shift , because the spectral shape of the v @xmath58 have large @xmath3-dependence .",
    "nevertheless , a discontinuity has also been observed in the energy shifts of the leading edge , peak and tail of the v @xmath58 band , as shown in fig .",
    "[ v3dshift ] . therefore , we concluded that the shift of the chemical potential jumps between @xmath6 and 0.17 , i.e. , across the mott insulating state .",
    "this suggests that an energy gap is opened when @xmath62 or when the filling of the v 3@xmath14 band becomes 2 and that the magnitude of the gap is @xmath5 ev . when a sufficient number of carriers are doped , namely , in the overdoped region @xmath63 the chemical potential @xmath4 is monotonously shifted as in a normal metal on both the electron- and hole - doped sides .",
    "in the underdoped region , on other hand , the shift of the chemical potential is deviated from the monotonic behavior and seems to be suppressed towards the insulator limit . since the spectral weight decreases towards @xmath4 , the observed suppression of the chemical - potential shift is inconsistent with the rigid band picture of the conventional band insulator , but in good agreement with @xmath64 , which has been predicted for the two - dimensional hubbard model,@xcite as shown by dotted lines in fig .",

    "[ dopingv3d ] and [ dopingef ] .",
    "the v 3@xmath14 band shows a general trend of being shifted towards @xmath4 with substitution of pb for la .",
    "since the spectral intensity at @xmath4 always remains low , the total width of the v 3@xmath14 band becomes somewhat narrower with increasing @xmath3 .",
    "it should be noted that between @xmath6 and 0.17 , the higher binding - energy side of the v 3@xmath14 band is rigidly shifted by a large amount in spite of the small change in @xmath3 , implying that the chemical potential jumps across the gap between the electron- and hole - doped samples , as described above .",

    "[ dopingef](a ) , and the spectral weight within @xmath65 ev of @xmath4 is increased at the cost of the decrease in the spectral weight around @xmath59 ev .",
    "this means that spectral - weight transfer occurs upon electron doping from @xmath49 ev to near @xmath4 .",
    "if one takes into account the upward chemical - potential shift by @xmath65 ev from @xmath6 to @xmath66 , the spectral - weight transfer into the gap region should be considered even larger , as schematically illustrated in fig .",

    "when the holes are doped into the @xmath24 mott insulator , the spectral weight in the vicinity of @xmath4 increases . however , the increase rate from @xmath34 to 0.35 is lower than that expected from the @xmath34 spectrum shifted according to the rigid - band model .",

    "the figure clearly shows that the gap of the insulating @xmath6 sample is rapidly filled with temperature .",
    "the increase of the spectral weight at @xmath4 is continuous and monotonic at least from @xmath40 k to 300 k , and shows no anomaly at @xmath76 k unlike the thermal dilatation and the ultrasound velocity .",

    "[ tempall ] , temperature - dependent spectra are also shown for several different composition .",
    "it should be noted that the gap filling with temperature looks quite similar for all the compositions , and does not depend on whether it has a real gap or a pseudogap .",
    "at room temperature 300 k , the spectral intensity at @xmath4 is filled up to about half of the peak intensity of the v 3@xmath14 band , so that the spectra at 300 k appear almost those of a normal metal .",
    "now , we discuss on the nature of the metal - to - insulator transition in la@xmath0pb@xmath1vs@xmath2 .",
    "since the three @xmath25 orbitals of the v 3@xmath14 states are thought to be nearly degenerate , the insulating state around @xmath7 is difficult to be understood as a conventional band insulator , and should be explained as a mott insulator induced by the repulsive electron - electron interaction .",
    "in fact , the observed critical behavior of the chemical - potential shift around mit is consistent with the mott - hubbard model calculation .",
    "then , the nonmagnetic behavior of the insulating state of la@xmath0pb@xmath1vs@xmath2 at low temperatures would be interpreted as due to a singlet formation out of the atomic @xmath77 state of the @xmath8 configuration , e.g. , the formation of a small cluster such as v@xmath16 trimer.@xcite in the case of the weak interaction limit , such a picture of the insulating state becomes that of a charge - density - wave ( cdw ) insulator . whether the interaction is strong or weak ,",
    "these insulating states require lattice distortion , which is indeed observed as the anomaly in the thermal dilatation and in the ultrasound velocity at @xmath76 k.@xcite    although the chemical - potential shift and the transport properties indicate that the mott mit occurs , no effective mass enhancement has been observed near the mit of la@xmath0pb@xmath1vs@xmath2 in the electronic specific - heat coefficient @xmath33 nor in the photoemission spectral weight at @xmath4 , @xmath9 .",
    "alternatively , @xmath9 is decreased towards the insulating phase because the pseudogap develops at @xmath4 . with increasing temperature ,",
    "the pseudogap is rapidly filled .",
    "the behaviors of both the chemical - potential shift and the doping and temperature dependence of @xmath9 are similar to those of the high-@xmath13 cuprate la@xmath19sr@xmath1cuo@xmath20,@xcite rather than those of the three - dimensional typical mott mit system la@xmath15sr@xmath1tio@xmath16.@xcite therefore , the present results suggest that the dimensionality of the system is crucial to whether the mass enhancement occurs or the pseudogap behavior is observed .",
    "then , we consider a possible origin of the suppression of @xmath9 near mit . for la@xmath19sr@xmath1cuo@xmath20 ,",
    "the formation of the large pseudogap is closely related to the antiferromagnetic correlation@xcite or singlet correlation.@xcite thus , a singlet formation of the v@xmath16 trimer may lead to the disappearance of the electronic states around @xmath4 . a hubbard model calculation has shown that dimerization may reconcile the suppression of the chemical - potential shift with the absence of the mass enhancement.@xcite     taken at @xmath40 k , plotted against the square of binding energy .",
    "the spectrum for @xmath6 has the widest straight portion near @xmath4.,width=207 ]    in addition , the effect of structural disorder can not be ignored in the filling - controlled systems . in particular , for the present system , the parent insulator la@xmath78pb@xmath79vs@xmath2 is nonstoichiometric unlike the stoichiometric la@xmath21cuo@xmath20.@xcite ( scraping sample surfaces may also introduces additional disorder for the present experiment . )",
    "when the carrier concentration is low , random potential leads to anderson localization .",
    "doped carriers just being localized are more strongly affected by the long - range coulomb interaction between electrons , and a so - called `` coulomb gap '' is formed at @xmath4 .",

    "a small residual step at @xmath4 for @xmath84 indicates that the coulomb - gap opening is incomplete , but it is difficult at present to judge whether this is an intrinsic feature of the material or is due to small residual metallic regions in the sample .",
