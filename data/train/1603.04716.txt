    "as one of the most striking features of quantum phenomena@xcite , quantum entanglement has been identified as a key non - local resource in quantum information processing vary from quantum teleportation@xcite and quantum cryptography@xcite to dense coding@xcite .",
    "these effects based on quantum entanglement have been demonstrated in many outstanding experiments .",
    "an important issue in theory of quantum entanglement is to recognize and quantify the entanglement for a given quantum state .",
    "concurrence is one of the well - defined quantitative measures of entanglement@xcite-@xcite . for a mixed two - qubit state , an elegant formula of concurrence",
    "was derived analytically by wootters in @xcite . however , beyond bipartite qubit systems and some special symmetric state @xcite , there exists no explicit analytic formulas to show the concurrence of arbitrary high - dimensional mixed states . instead of analytic formulas ,",
    "some progress has been made toward the analytical lower bounds of concurrence . in recent years",
    ", there are many papers @xcite-@xcite to give the lower bounds of concurrence for bipartite quantum states by using different methods .",
    "all these bounds give rise to a good quantitative estimation of concurrence .",
    "they are usually supplementary in detecting quantum entanglement .    with the deepening research of the lower bound of bipartite concurrence",
    ", some nice algorithms and progress has been concentrated on possible lower bound of concurrence for tripartite quantum systems @xcite-@xcite . in ref.@xcite analytic lower bounds of concurrence for three - qubit systems or for any @xmath0 @xmath1 tripartite quantum systems have been presented by using the generalized partial transposition(gpt ) criterion . in ref.@xcite",
    "another analytic lower bounds of concurrence for @xmath2 tripartite quantum systems have been obtained in terms of the concurrence of sub - states .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 , we generalize the results in @xcite and obtain some new operational lower bounds of concurrence for arbitrary dimensional @xmath3 @xmath4 tripartite quantum systems in terms of lower - dimensional systems . in sec . 3",

    "we first recall the definition of the tripartite concurrence .",
    "let @xmath5 and @xmath6 be @xmath7- , @xmath8- , @xmath9-dimensional hilbert spaces , respectively . in general , we can assume that @xmath10 any pure tripartite state @xmath11 has the form @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the basis of @xmath14    the concurrence of a tripartite pure state @xmath11 is defined by @xcite    @xmath15    where the reduced density matrix @xmath16 ( respectively , @xmath17 ) is obtained by tracing over the subsystems @xmath18 and @xmath19(respectively , @xmath20 and @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath18 ) .",

    "any given term @xmath68 in eq.(4 ) .",
    "if @xmath69 and @xmath70 then there are @xmath71 different @xmath64 sub - states @xmath72 with @xmath73 where @xmath74 @xmath75 and @xmath76 such that the term ( 8) appears in the concurrence of @xmath77    if @xmath69 and @xmath78 then there are @xmath79 different @xmath64 sub - states @xmath80 with @xmath81 where @xmath82 such that the term ( 8) appears in the concurrence of @xmath83    otherwise , if @xmath84 and @xmath70 then there are @xmath85 different @xmath64 sub - states @xmath86 with @xmath87 where @xmath88 such that the term ( 8) appears in the concurrence of @xmath89    since @xmath90 and @xmath91 we have the following relation : @xmath92 equivalently ,    @xmath93      equation ( 7 ) gives a lower bound of @xmath104 one can estimate @xmath61 by calculating the concurrence of the sub - states @xmath105 different choices of @xmath106 may give rise to different lower bounds .",
    "a convex combination of these lower bounds is still a lower bound .",

    "we can use the same method in proof of theorem 2 to prove the theorem .",
    "the lower bound of concurrence of @xmath32 in equation ( 12 ) is given by the concurrence of sub - matrix @xmath115 choosing different @xmath116 and @xmath117 would result in different lower bounds .",
    "generally , we have the following corollary .    for any @xmath64 tripartite mixed quantum state @xmath107",
    "then the concurrence @xmath61 satisfies    @xmath118    where @xmath119 and @xmath120    associated with theorem 2 and theorem 3 , we get the other lower bounds of tripartite mixed state @xmath103    for any @xmath58 tripartite mixed quantum state @xmath107 assume @xmath60 then the concurrence @xmath61 satisfies    @xmath121    where @xmath122^{-1 } , c_{\\lambda\\otimes \\mu\\otimes \\nu}= [ \\binom{s-1}{\\lambda-1}\\times \\binom{s-2}{\\mu-2}\\times \\binom{s-2}{\\nu-2}]^{-1 } , \\sum_{p_{s\\otimes s\\otimes s}}$ ] stands for summing over all possible @xmath64 mixed sub - states and @xmath123 stands for summing over all possible @xmath113 mixed sub - states .",
    "the lower bounds ( 7 ) and ( 12 ) are in general not operationally computable , as we still have no analytical results for concurrence of lower - dimensional states .",
    "if we replace the computation of concurrence of lower - dimensional sub - states @xmath124 and @xmath125 by that of the lower bounds of three - qubit mixed quantum sub - states , eq .",
    "( 7 ) and ( 12 ) gives an operational lower bound based on known lower bounds .",
    "the lower bound obtained in this way should be the same or better than the previously known lower bounds .",
    "hence ( 7 ) and ( 12 ) can be used to improve all the known lower bounds of concurrence by associating with some analytical lower bounds for three - qubit mixed quantum states @xcite in this sense .",
    "assume @xmath126 is any lower bound of concurrence , i.e. @xmath127 then for a given mixed state @xmath101 the concurrence of the projected lower - dimensional mixed state @xmath124 satisfies @xmath128 associated with ( 7 ) , we get @xmath129 here if we choose @xmath124 to be the given mixed state @xmath32 itself , the inequality reduces to @xmath130 again .",
    "generally , the lower bound @xmath126 may be improved if one takes into account all the lower - dimensional mixed states @xmath131    in the following , we will first present an analytical lower bound for @xmath132 mixed quantum sub - states like @xmath133 by using the theorem 2 in @xcite and ( 16 ) .    for any @xmath58 tripartite mixed quantum state @xmath59 assume @xmath60 let @xmath133 be a @xmath132 mixed quantum sub - state",

    "we will show the power of ( 18 ) by the following example :    we consider the @xmath145 quantum mixed state @xmath146 with @xmath147 where @xmath148 and @xmath149 denotes the @xmath150 identity matrix . according to ( 18 ) , we obtain @xmath151 so our result can detect the entanglement of @xmath32 when @xmath152 see fig.1 .",
