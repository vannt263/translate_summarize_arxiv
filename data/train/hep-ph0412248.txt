    "the pion distribution amplitude ( da ) can be defined through the matrix element of a nonlocal axial current on the light cone @xmath1 which is explicitly gauge - invariant due to the connector @xmath2 .",

    "theoretically we use , following mikhailov and radyushkin  @xcite , a qcd sum rule approach with non - local condensates ( nlc ) . just for illustration , we present here the simplest scalar condensate of the used nlc model , which reads @xmath9 this model is determined by a single scale parameter @xmath10 characterizing the average momentum of quarks in the qcd vacuum .",
    "it has been estimated in qcd srs  @xcite and on the lattice  @xcite : @xmath11 .",

    "the cleo experimental data on @xmath0 allow one to obtain direct constraints on @xmath22 . for @xmath23 ,",
    "@xmath24 pqcd factorization is valid only in leading twist , but higher twists are also of importance  @xcite .",
    "the reason is : if @xmath25 one needs to take into account the interaction of a real photon at long distances of order of @xmath26 .",
    "applying the lcsr approach  @xcite , one effectively accounts for the long - distance effects of a real photon , using the quark - hadron duality in the vector channel and a dispersion relation in @xmath27 .",

    "we have adopted a 20% uncertainty in the magnitude of the twist-4 contribution , @xmath30  gev@xmath13 , and produced new @xmath31- , @xmath32- and @xmath33-contours dictated by the cleo data  @xcite .",
    "we concluded that even with a 20% uncertainty in @xmath34 , the cz da is excluded * at least * at the * @xmath35 * -level , whereas the asymptotic da  at the * @xmath33 * -level .",
    "our `` bunch '' is inside the @xmath31-region and other nonperturbative models are near the 3@xmath36-boundary .",
    "we show in fig.[fig : cleo_ff]a the plot of @xmath37 for our `` bunch '' ( shaded strip ) , cz da ( upper dashed line ) , asymptotic da ( lower dashed line ) , and two instanton - based models ( dotted  @xcite and dash - dotted  @xcite lines ) in comparison with the cello and cleo data .",
    "we see that the bms `` bunch '' describes rather well all data for @xmath38 gev@xmath13 .",
    "the diffractive dijet production in @xmath39 collisions has been suggested as a tool to extract the profile of the pion da by frankfurt et al . in 1993  @xcite .",
    "they argued that the jet distribution with respect to the longitudinal momentum fraction has to follow the quark momentum distribution in the pion and hence provides a direct measurement of the pion da . as it was shown just recently in  @xcite",
    "( see also  @xcite ) , this proportionality does not hold beyond the leading logarithms in energy .",
    "braun et al . found that the distribution in the longitudinal momentum fraction of the jets for the non - factorizable contribution is the same as for the factorizable contribution with the asymptotic pion da .",
    "using the convolution approach of braun et al .",
    "we estimated  @xcite the distribution of jets in this experiment for our `` bunch '' of pion das and show the results in comparison with @xmath40 and @xmath41 in fig.[fig : cleo_ff]b .",
    "it is interesting to note that the corresponding @xmath42 values are : as  12.56 ; cz  14.15 ; bms  10.96 ( accounting for 18 data points ) .",
    "the main conclusion from this comparison : * all three das are compatible with the e791 data*. hence , this experiment can not serve as a safe profile indicator .",
    "let us say a few words about similarities and differences between the cz and bms das .",
    "both are two - humped , but the cz da is strongly end - point enhanced , whereas the bms da is end - point suppressed , as is well illustrated in fig.[fig : pidatasum]a . and the reason for this behavior is physically evident : nonlocal quark condensate reduces pion da in the small @xmath43 region and enhances in the vicinity of the point @xmath44 . in order to keep the norm equal to unity , it is forced to have in the central region some reduction as well .",

    "how well is the bms bunch in comparison with the jlab data on the pion form factor ? we have calculated the pion form factor in analytic nlo pqcd  @xcite @xmath45 taking into account the soft part @xmath46 via the local duality approach  @xcite , based on perturbative spectral density @xmath47  @xcite , and correcting the factorized contribution @xmath48 via a power - behaved pre - factor ( with @xmath49  gev@xmath13 ) in order to respect the ward identity at @xmath50 while preserving its high-@xmath51 asymptotics .    in our analysis",
    "@xmath52 has been computed to nlo  @xcite using analytic perturbation theory  @xcite and trading the running coupling and its powers for analytic expressions in a non - power series expansion , i.e. , @xmath53_\\text{maxan }    \\ = \\ \\bar{\\alpha}_\\text{s}^{(2)}(\\mu_\\text{r}^{2})\\ , { \\cal f}_{\\pi}^\\text{lo}(q^2 )     + \\frac{1}{\\pi}\\ ,        { \\cal a}_{2}^{(2)}(\\mu_\\text{r}^{2})\\ ,         { \\cal f}_{\\pi}^\\text{nlo}(q^2;\\mu_\\text{r}^{2})\\ , , \\label{eq : pffmaxan}\\ ] ] with @xmath54 and @xmath55 being the 2-loop analytic images of @xmath56 and @xmath57 , respectively @xcite , whereas @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the lo and nlo parts of the factorized form factor .",
    "this procedure with the analytic running coupling and the analytic versions of its powers gives us a practical independence of the scheme / scale setting and provides results in rather good agreement with the experimental data @xcite .",
    "indeed , the form - factor predictions are only slightly larger than those resulting from the calculation with the asymptotic da ( see fig.[fig : pidatasum]b ) .",
    "the qcd sum rule method with nonlocal condensates produces a `` bunch '' of admissible pion das for each @xmath60 value . comparing these results with the cleo constraints , obtained in the lcsr analysis of the @xmath61-transition form factor ,",
    "clearly fixes the value of qcd vacuum nonlocality to @xmath17  gev@xmath13 .",
    "the corresponding `` bunch '' of pion das agrees well with both the e791 data on diffractive dijet production and with the jlab f(pi ) data on the pion electromagnetic form factor .",
    "analytic perturbation theory with a non - power nlo contribution for the pion form factor diminishes scale - setting ambiguities already at the nlo level .",
