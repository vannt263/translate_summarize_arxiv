    "to read the genetic information encoded in the base sequence , hidden in the helical structure of a dna , it is necessary to break the hydrogen bonds of the base pairs@xcite .",
    "the mechanism for doing so is the unzipping by a force @xcite of a double stranded dna ( dsdna ) , or a thermal melting @xcite . in the melting transition ,",
    "the hydrogen bonds of base pairing are broken by thermal energy , while in the unzipping transition , it is by a pulling force at one end of the dna . in both cases ,",
    "the strands remain intact .",
    "while there is a long history of experimental studies of the melting transition@xcite , the investigations of the unzipping transition or responses to external forces are of more recent origin@xcite .",
    "pioneering calorimetric studies were done over a large range of temperature ( @xmath0 ) from 2k to 400k under different solution conditions@xcite .",
    "so far as force is concerned , isotherms of dna , like the response under a force have been obtained in many different types of single molecule experiments@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , calorimetry in presence of a force is still not available .",
    "it is known from various theoretical models that , for both melting and unzipping , the nature of the transition depends on the aspects of the dna captured in a model@xcite . any natural dna , because of its large length , is expected to show the characteristic features of the transitions ; however , the situation is not so clear on the experimental front . in - vitro experiments",
    "are generally restricted to short chains .",
    "consequently , very little is known about the role of sequence variation , e.g. , as seen across species , vis - a - vis the true transition behaviour expected of long chains . as a matter of fact",
    ", we even lack a clear experimental answer about the order of the melting transition @xcite .",
    "the co - operativity in melting comes from the entropy ( @xmath1 ) of the dna through the correlations introduced by the strands as long polymers@xcite .",
    "the unzipping transition is due to the competition between the pairing of the strands and the stretching of the unbound strands@xcite .",
    "the work done in stretching the free polymers provides the cost of unpairing the strands .",
    "this cost at zero temperature is only the pairing energy , but , because of entropy , the critical unzipping force vanishes as one approaches the melting temperature .",
    "the thermodynamic conjugate pair for the transition is @xmath2 , the unzipping force , and @xmath3 , the separation of the two strands at the point of application of force ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "it transpires that gross quantities like the entropy , the specific heat , and the response function for force , are the relevant thermodynamic quantities to study , especially as the transition point is approached .",
    "the advantage in the thermodynamic approach is that the results obtained are valid under quite general conditions without getting into the microscopic details of dna .        besides the conjugate pairs ( @xmath4 ) , and @xmath5",
    ", there could be other types of external forces , e.g. , isotropic hydrostatic or osmotic pressure affecting the volume of the polymer , and a stretching force ( @xmath6 ) that distorts and elongates the chain .",
    "although there are evidences of hydrostatic or osmotic pressure affecting protein - dna interaction@xcite , there is only a very weak effect on the melting of dna .",
    "in contrast , a stretching force may lead to an `` overstretching '' transition where the length of the dna increases by a factor of 1.7 @xcite . whether it is an equilibrium ( meaning thermodynamic ) transition is still debated .",

    "various aspects of the unzipping transition , and in that context the corresponding melting transition , have been studied .",

    "many details of the transition have also been studied , like various distributions@xcite , temperature dependence@xcite , different types of noise@xcite , role of ensembles@xcite .",
    "the dependence of melting on the nature of the space has also been studied via the choice of different fractal lattices@xcite , showing the possible variations in the melting transition .",
    "the mapping of the dna melting problem to a quantum problem revealed the connection between the bubble entropy of dna and the quantum transition @xcite , and to the efimov - physics@xcite .",
    "biological applications have also been considered , especially the motion of the interface or the y - fork@xcite .",
    "our purpose in this paper is to consider the melting and the unzipping transitions from a purely thermodynamic point of view , without any consideration of any microscopic models . this way we derive the relevant thermodynamic relations applicable to these transitions .",
    "obviously such predictions are independent of the microscopic details .",

    "a justification is as follows . in a nonequilibrium situation , to change the force from zero to @xmath2 , the work done on the dna is @xmath18 for a trajectory .",
    "for example , an instantaneous change in force would require a work @xmath19 if the distance remains fixed at @xmath3 .",
    "then the histogram transformation in statistical mechanics gives us the free energy difference as @xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 , and the angular bracket indicates averaging over all possible trajectories starting with the equilibrium distribution at zero force . in this particular case of instantaneous increase , the averaging is over all values of @xmath3 with the equilibrium probability distribution @xmath22 at the initial force .",

    "the conjugate variable is volume ( @xmath143 ) , but it is the volume of the polymer with the surrounding distorted solvent layers . for simplicity we ignored the terms involving @xmath6 and @xmath145 , and considered only the unzipping force @xmath2 .",
    "the extended form of the free energy shows that it is possible to have cross - effects like the @xmath146 and @xmath145 dependence of @xmath3 .",
    "different studies looked at the effect of hydrostatic pressure , e.g. , the stability of hairpins , b - dna , the stalling of transcription elongation complexes@xcite . the melting temperature @xmath28 seems to depend on the hydrostatic pressure , @xmath145 , only at a very high @xmath145 .",
    "it is possible to measure the adiabatic compressibility ( constant entropy ) of a dna molecule by measuring the velocity of ultrasonic waves .",
    "a different way of exerting a pressure is to use osmolytes like polyethylene glycol ( peg ) and other molecules that can not penetrate the dna .",
    "there are reports of hydrostatic pressure reversing the effect of osmotic pressure in protein - dna interaction",
    ".    there can be a stretching force ( @xmath146 ) that distorts the shape and tries to elongate the chain .",
    "what one finds is a transformation of a dsdna to an `` overstretched '' state with its length increasing by a factor of 1.7 @xcite . whether it is an thermodynamic ( meaning equilibrium ) transition",
    "is still debated .",
    "the conjugate variable is the end - to - end distance ( @xmath147 ) , if the end points are tied together .",
    "the conjugate variable becomes the length of the polymer for the overstretching transition .",
    "this is the usual force considered for a polymer@xcite , but coupling to unzipping seems to lead to the new feature of overstretching . as a perturbation to an entropy - dominated polymer configuration , the response to the stretching force need not be linear , if the chain does not behave as gaussian , but the overstretching transition is beyond this regime where the finite extensions of the bonds need to be taken into account .",
    "there are evidences of overstretching being coupled with unzipping making cross terms important .",
    "the response functions needed for such cross effects would be @xmath148 with other appropriate variables kept constant .",
    "the differential relations of the free energy are of the expected type @xmath149 in the canonical fixed-@xmath2 case , the conjugate parameters and the response functions are the first and second derivatives respectively of the appropriate thermodynamic potential as    @xmath150    where @xmath151 is the constant force heat capacity and @xmath44 is the extensibility at constant temperature , the local slope of a @xmath2-@xmath3 isotherm . as usual ,",
    "the positivity of @xmath151 and @xmath44 , needed for stability , are related to the convexity conditions satisfied by @xmath13 .",
    "the differential forms yield the maxwell relations for dna as @xmath152    of which the first two relate the thermal expansion of the open fork to the heat flow for change in force .",
    "let us consider a phase boundary @xmath153 , where at any point @xmath154 , the gibbs free energies and the entropies of the two phases a and b are the same , i.e. , @xmath155 along the phase boundary , at a neighbouring point , @xmath156 .",
    "an expansion gives @xmath157 which tells us that at the transition point , the conjugate variable @xmath3 is continuous , because of the continuity of the entropy ( @xmath158 ) .",
    "the constant force specific heat is given by @xmath159 the derivative of the entropy can be expressed in terms of the derivative along the transition line as @xmath160 and a similar relation for phase b. since at each point on the transition line entropy is continuous , @xmath161 .",
    "eq . can now be used to express the constant force specific heat difference as @xmath162.\\ ] ] a further simplification can be achieved by using one of the maxwell relations , eq .",
    ", @xmath163 where @xmath164 is the extensibility of phase a. with a similar relation for phase b , we obtain @xmath165 if the extensibility of phase a is less than that of b , then the specific heat of phase a is higher than that of b."
