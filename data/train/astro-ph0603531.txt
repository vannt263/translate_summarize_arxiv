    "it is not known yet which of the polarization structures , invisible in total emission , are real and which are due to wavelength and latitude  dependent faraday effects .",
    "the existing polarization data are insufficient to construct a realistic model .",
    "one of the `` toy '' models for cmb correction ( giardino et al .",

    "furthermore , at @xmath5  cm faraday effects are still strong in the galactic plane .",
    "all - sky polarization surveys at higher frequencies are urgently needed , as well as better models of the magneto - ionic interstellar medium .",
    "another approach is to model the galactic radio emission at high frequencies with help of models of the distribution of cosmic ray and magnetic fields in the milky way .",

    "they contribute significantly to the total pressure which balances the ism against gravitation .",

    "_ , emitted by cosmic - ray electrons spiralling around magnetic fields in the interstellar or intergalactic medium , in pulsars and in background quasars , typically has a much higher degree of polarization than in the other spectral ranges .",
    "the observed degree of polarization is reduced by unpolarized thermal emission within the beam , which may dominate in star - forming regions , by _ faraday depolarization _ ( sokoloff et al .",
    "@xcite ) , and by geometrical depolarization due to variations of the field orientation within the beam .",
    "the orientation of the polarization vectors is changed in a magneto - ionic medium by _ faraday rotation _ which increases with @xmath7 . at small @xmath8 ( below about 6  cm for typical ism magnetic fields or about 1  cm for strong fields in starburst regions ) the @xmath9vectors ( i.e. the observed @xmath10vectors rotated by @xmath11 ) trace , within a few degrees , the _ orientation _ of the field in the sky plane ( sect .",

    "the energy density of global rotation of the neutral gas in the inner part of ngc  6946 is @xmath24 larger than that of the turbulent gas motion .",
    "as the radial decrease of magnetic energy density is much slower than that of the rotational energy density , the magnetic field energy density may reach the level of global rotational gas motion at some radius and hence affect the rotation curve , as proposed by battaner & florido ( @xcite ) .",

    "the @xmath25vectors and the gas streamlines around the bar as obtained in numerical simulations are surprisingly similar , which suggests that the regular magnetic field is generally aligned with the shearing flow ( beck et al .",
    "remarkably , the optical images of ngc  1097 and ngc  1365 show dust filaments which are almost perpendicular to the bar and aligned with the @xmath25vectors .",
    "however , the upstream / downstream contrast in polarized intensity is significantly smaller than that expected from compression and shearing of the regular magnetic field , which could be the result of decoupling of the regular field from the dense molecular clouds ( beck et al .",
    "the regular field in the bar is probably strong enough to resist shearing by the rarefied diffuse gas .",
    "these observations , for the first time , indicate that _ magnetic forces can control the flow of the diffuse interstellar gas at kiloparsec scales_.    present - day polarization observations are limited by sensitivity at high resolution .",

    "the ska will allow to study magnetic field structures in nearby galaxies at angular resolutions more than 10@xmath28 better than today ( beck & gaensler  @xcite ) .",
    "dynamo action generates _ coherent _ spiral magnetic fields , while compression or shearing of turbulent fields by gas flows generates _ incoherent anisotropic random _ fields , which reverse direction frequently within the telescope beam , so that faraday rotation is small while the degree of polarization can still be high .",

    "<S> total magnetic fields in spiral galaxies , as observed through their total synchrotron emission , are strongest ( up to @xmath0 g ) in the spiral arms . </S>",

    "<S> either many dynamo modes are superimposed and can not be resolved by present - day telescopes , or most of the apparently regular field is in fact _ anisotropic random _ , with frequent reversals , due to shearing and compressing gas flows . in galaxies with massive bars , </S>",
    "<S> the polarization pattern follows the gas flow . </S>",
    "<S> however , around strong shocks in bars , the compression of the regular field is much lower than that of the gas ; the regular field decouples from the cold gas and is strong enough to affect the flow of the diffuse warm gas .  the average strength of the total magnetic field in the _ milky way _ is @xmath2 g near the sun and increases to 2040  @xmath3 g in the galactic center region . </S>",
