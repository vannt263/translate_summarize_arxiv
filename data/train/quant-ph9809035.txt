    "<S> this paper develops a method of manipulating the squeezed atom state to generate a few - photon state whose phase or photon - number fluctuations are prescribed at our disposal . </S>",
    "<S> the squeezed atom state is a collective atomic state whose quantum fluctuations in population difference or collective dipole are smaller than those of the coherent atom state . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the squeezed atom state can be generated by the interaction of atoms with a coherent state of the electromagnetic field , and that it can be used as a tunable source of squeezed radiation . </S>",
    "<S> a variety of squeezed states , including the photon - number squeezed state and the phase squeezed state , can be produced by manipulating the atomic state . </S>",
    "<S> this is owing to the fact that quantum - statistical information of the atomic state is faithfully transferred to that of the photon state . </S>",
    "<S> possible experimental situations to implement our theory are discussed . </S>"
