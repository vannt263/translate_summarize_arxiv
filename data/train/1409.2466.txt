    "this paper is concerned with a classical problem of great importance in the manufacture of composite materials ( see @xcite and references therein ) , as well as in many other applications .",
    "it is the determination of the electrical transport properties in two - dimensional media containing a set of embedded inclusions which may be close - to - touching .",
    "it is assumed that there is a uniform background field .",
    "lord rayleigh @xcite was one of the first to consider such issues in the context of a regular periodic array of circular inclusions .",
    "in this paper we focus on the two - dimensional case , and in ways of calculating the field exterior to the inclusions .",
    "this problem becomes very singular as the inclusions become close - to - touching and this circumstance presents formidable computational problems that have been the subject of much research . in cases there the geometry is sufficiently simple , asymptotic methods can be used to get quantitative insight into this case @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "the most successful numerical schemes in two - dimensions are integral equation methods .",
    "these , nevertheless , also encounter difficulties when the inclusions ( or discs ) are close - to - touching .",
    "greengard & moura @xcite employed fast multipole - accelerated integral equation methods whose cost grows linearly in the number of unknowns . since their method does not make any special provision for the singular nature of the problem as the discs get close together ,",
    "these methods quickly become expensive .",
    "helsing @xcite @xcite has developed fast multipole - accelerated iterative schemes for inclusions of arbitrary shape .",
    "more recently , focussing on the case of arrays of close - to - touching discs , cheng & greengard @xcite ( see also @xcite ) have presented a method which marries ideas from the `` method of images '' to various integral equation techniques .",
    "their scheme relies on including multipole expansions , of various orders , about successive generations of reflections ( or `` images '' ) of the centres of the discs .",
    "these additional reflected terms allow even very singular cases to be resolved to essentially arbitrary accuracy .",
    "while the number of multipole expansions involved can become very large , the actual number of unknowns associated with each inclusion is kept small by making use of known reflection operators which allow the coefficients of the expansions about the next - generation images to be inferred analytically from the parent coefficients .",
    "the aim of this paper is to present an apparently new numerical scheme to address the challenge of close - to - touching inclusions .",
    "a key advantage of the method is that it is conceptually simple and very easy to implement .",
    "the central idea is to make use of a strategically chosen over - complete basis set which we refer to as a `` hybrid basis '' . the two cylinder problem is studied in detail . in  [ saleh ] we prove , for the two cylinder problem , that there exists a representation of the solution in terms of a hybrid basis having faster decay rate properties than that obtained through a more traditional non - hybrid method .",
    "this provides a rationalization of the empirical observation of superior performance when the so - called `` hybrid basis scheme '' , to be explained in the next two sections , is used .",
    "suppose we wish to solve the problem for the electrostatic field exterior to @xmath2 circular discs , in an @xmath3-plane , with the field strength in the far - field tends to the value @xmath4 at an angle @xmath5 to the @xmath6-axis .",
    "we will repose the problem using a complex variable formulation .",
    "the problem is mathematically equivalent to finding the function @xmath7 , analytic and single - valued outside a collection of circular discs , with @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 = \\biggl \\lbrace \\begin{array}{ll } 0 , & { \\rm on~ } c_1 , \\\\",

    "this reduces to finding the function @xmath7 , analytic and single - valued outside a collection of circular discs , with @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 = \\biggl \\lbrace \\begin{array}{ll } 0 , & { \\rm on~ } c_1 , \\\\",

    "\\end{array } \\label{eq : eqbc}\\ ] ] in either problem , the set @xmath15 is determined as part of the solution . in",
    "what follows , we consider the two physical problems just stated as essentially the same ; indeed , they are the same once the identification @xmath16 is made .",
    "we will solve the problem of uniform flow past the discs since convenient analytical solutions to this problem are known ( see , for example , crowdy @xcite ) and these will be used for bench - marking purposes .",
    "to illustrate the ideas behind the new method , it is expedient to consider three different numerical schemes for the computation of @xmath7 .",
    "these will be referred to as the @xmath17-scheme , the @xmath18-scheme and the hybrid scheme .",
    "it is the third hybrid scheme which constitutes the new contribution of this paper .",
    "the first scheme , which will be referred to as the `` @xmath17 scheme '' , is a standard scheme commonly used in the numerical computation of fields in multiply connected domains .",
    "prosnak @xcite , for example , makes liberal use of it in the computation of fluid flows in multiply connected geometries .",
    "we describe this method in the context of a two cylinder example .",
    "consider two circular discs , each of radius @xmath19 , centred at @xmath20 where @xmath21 .",
    "there is no loss in generality in setting @xmath22 and @xmath23 since all length and time scales can be non - dimensionalized with respect to @xmath24 and @xmath25 respectively .",
    "a natural approach is to write the following fourier - laurent expansion about the centres of the discs : @xmath26 where the coefficients @xmath27 are to be determined and the first term clearly enforces the far - field condition .",
    "the representation ( [ eq : eqm1 ] ) can be substituted into the boundary conditions ( [ eq : eqbc ] ) and evaluated at a set of collocation points which are most naturally chosen to be a set of equally spaced points around the boundary circles .",
    "the number of collocation points must be taken to be at least as large as the number of unknown coefficients retained in the truncation .",
    "since the boundary conditions are linear in the unknown coefficients , the latter can be found by a straightforward least - squares solution of the over - determined system .",
    "a second numerical scheme makes use of a conformal mapping .",
    "consider the conformal mapping from an annulus @xmath28 to the unbounded region exterior to the two discs in the @xmath17-plane .",
    "it is a simple mbius map given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 ( there is an abuse of notation here  and throughout  in that @xmath17 is used both as a coordinate point and as a conformal mapping function . )",
    "the point @xmath32 has been chosen to map to infinity in the @xmath17-plane .",
    "the inverse function to ( [ eq : eq1 ] ) is @xmath33 in this second method , referred to as the `` @xmath18 scheme '' , we use the modified representation of @xmath7 given by @xmath34^k    + \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty { d_k \\rho^k \\over [ \\zeta(z)]^{k } } ,   \\label{eq : eqm2a}\\ ] ] where the coefficients @xmath35 are now to be determined .",
    "the terms @xmath36^k    + \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty { d_k \\rho^k \\over [ \\zeta(z)]^{k } }    \\label{eq : eqm3}\\ ] ] can be recognized as a laurent series capable of representing any function that is analytic and single - valued in the annulus @xmath37 and hence , under the conformal mapping , in the region exterior to the two discs . as before , the easiest strategy to find the unknown coefficients is to solve an over - determined system by a least - squares method .",
    "the new numerical method will be called the `` hybrid basis scheme '' .",
    "the idea is to make use of the modified representation of @xmath7 given by @xmath38^k    + \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty { d_k \\rho^k \\over [ \\zeta(z)]^{k } } ,   \\label{eq : eqm2}\\ ] ] where the coefficients @xmath35 are now to be determined .",
    "( [ eq : eqm2 ] ) provides a representation of the required function @xmath7 that is uniformly valid everywhere in this annulus and , hence , everywhere in the flow region .",
    "_ in theory _ , the hybrid basis used in ( [ eq : eqm2 ] ) is overcomplete ; _ in practice _",
    ", however , since all the infinite sums must be truncated at some level , it is possible that the hybrid representation ( [ eq : eqm3 ] ) may offer numerical advantages over the @xmath18-scheme or the @xmath17-scheme used separately .",
    "we will now show that this is indeed true and , moreover , that the concomitant advantages are dramatic .",
    "we have found that the method of determination of the unknown coefficients in the hybrid representation requires care , otherwise the potential advantage is easily lost . to determine the unknown coefficients in ( [ eq : eqm2 ] ) , we truncate , at order @xmath39 , each of the four infinite sums in ( [ eq : eqm2 ] ) and solve , by a least squares procedure , an over - determined linear system .",
    "this system is found by substituting ( [ eq : eqm2 ] ) into the boundary conditions ( [ eq : eqbc ] ) and evaluating them at @xmath40 collocation points on the boundary of each of _ four _ discs : @xmath40 points are taken to be equi - spaced on each of the two circles @xmath41 together with @xmath40 points equi - spaced around each of the two circles @xmath42 . in order that the system is overdetermined we clearly need the number @xmath40 of collocation points on each of the four circles to exceed @xmath43 since the boundary conditions on each circle are real and @xmath39 complex coefficients associated with each circle are to be determined ( as well as the single real constant @xmath44 ) ; typically we take @xmath45 , but the method is found to be insensitive to this choice .",
    "the chosen collocation points are illustrated on the left in figure [ fig1aa ] ; to the right the images , under the map ( [ eq : eq1 ] ) and its inverse ( [ eq : eqinv ] ) , of the collocation points in the `` other '' plane are shown .",
    "on the physical disc boundaries , the equi - spaced collocation points on the @xmath18 circles naturally crowd around the area where they are most needed  in the region where the discs are closest together . on the other hand ,",
    "the image of uniformly spaced out points on the @xmath17-circles crowd around the negative real axis in the @xmath18-plane ( recall that @xmath32 is the preimage of the point at infinity in the physical plane ) .",
    "intuitively , then , our choice of hybrid basis scheme has the boundaries of the discs `` well covered '' .",
    "the above choice of collocation points was found to be crucial to the success of the method : the hybrid representation of the solution appears only to be effective provided the collocation points are chosen as described above .     and",
    "the @xmath17 planes ( shown left ) .",
    "the latter are used as collocation points for the hybrid basis scheme .",
    "[ fig1aa ] ]",
    "there is an exact solution , described in @xcite , for the two - disc problem which can be used to test the accuracy of the numerical scheme ; it also forms the basis of our analysis in  [ saleh ] .",
    "this solution is given as follows .",
    "define the two functions @xmath46 then the exact solution for @xmath47 , satisfying the ( arbitrarily chosen ) normalization that @xmath48 , is @xmath49 this exact solution can be computed to arbitrary accuracy by truncating the infinite product ( [ eq : eq4 ] ) at the appropriate level .",
    "it can be shown , directly from its definition ( [ eq : eq4 ] ) , that @xmath50 satisfies the functional relations @xmath51 from these it is then easily deduced that @xmath52 the identities ( [ eq : eqkprop ] ) can be used to directly verify that ( [ eq : eqex ] ) is the required solution .",

    "[ fig11],title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "to compare the performance of the three methods , the upper graph in figure [ fig11 ] shows the logarithm of the maximum absolute error in the numerical solutions compared with the exact solution plotted as a function of the truncation level @xmath39 for the case @xmath54 and @xmath55 so that the separation of the two discs is @xmath56 .",
    "the errors were computed by calculating the difference between @xmath7 as given by the exact solution ( [ eq : eqex ] ) ( evaluated on the boundaries of the two discs ) to the values given by the numerical schemes .",
    "it is clear that , while both the @xmath17-scheme and @xmath18-scheme give comparable accuracy at the same level of truncation , the hybrid scheme offers dramatic increases in accuracy at much smaller levels of truncation .",
    "this feature becomes even more pronounced at smaller separation distances : figure [ fig11 ] also shows results for @xmath53 and @xmath57 so that the separation of the two discs is @xmath58 , an order of magnitude smaller .",
    "the advantages of the hybrid basis scheme are seen even more clearly in figure [ fig10 ] . at each value of the disc separation ( horizontal axis )",
    "the vertical axis shows the number of modes required to attain accuracy of @xmath59 ( as compared with the exact solution ) . while around @xmath60 modes are needed for both the @xmath17-scheme and the @xmath18-schemes in order to attain the required accuracy when the disc separation is of the order of @xmath61 , the hybrid scheme attains the same accuracy with only @xmath62 modes even when the separation is as small as @xmath59 .",
    "for such small separations , both the @xmath17-scheme and the @xmath18-schemes become unfeasible ( requiring extremely large numbers of modes , which is why the results for these methods have been omitted from figure [ fig10 ] ) .",

    "the aim of this section is to demonstrate why a hybrid basis scheme involving series expansions in both the @xmath18 and @xmath17 variables might be expected to perform better than separate expansions in either variable , as the foregoing numerical evidence has shown .",
    "we show the hybrid scheme has better decay properties of its coefficients than a power series in either the @xmath18 or @xmath17 variables separately .",

    "the key feature is that both graphs are close to _ linear _ ( albeit with different slopes ) .",
    "this means that both methods require just a linear increase in the degree of truncation as the order of magnitude of the separation is decreased .",
    "this is a major improvement on previous methods ( e.g. , the original fourier - laurent method ) where the required number of modes appears to increase by an order of magnitude as the separation decreases by an order of magnitude and , therefore , rapidly become unviable for very small separations .     in the 9-disc example ) against the logarithm of the disc separation @xmath357 .",
    "both methods require only a linear increase in the number of modes as the separation decreases by an order of magnitude .",
    "a new `` hybrid basis scheme '' has been presented to compute analytic functions exterior to a collection of close - to - touching discs and satisfying certain boundary conditions of the boundaries of those discs .",
    "the method is conceptually simple and it is easy to implement .",
    "it affords similar advantages to the method of cheng & greengard @xcite in that it requires just a linear increase in the truncation as the disc separation decreases by an order of magnitude .",
    "the new method , however , has the advantage of not requiring analytical knowledge of any `` reflection operators '' to produce the coefficients of multipole expansions about higher generations of reflections .",
    "this will be important for problems involving the computation of functions analytic outside a collection of close - to - touching discs when the boundary value problems determining these functions are such that analogous reflection operators are not known analytically .",
    "it should also be clear that close - to - touching discs having unequal radii are also amenable to the same method .",
    "one motivation for seeking a simple and effective numerical scheme for this problem is our desire to optimize a numerical scheme presented in @xcite for the computation of a special transcendental function known as the schottky - klein prime function @xcite .",
    "this function is very useful @xcite for finding analytical solutions to problems involving multiply connected domains ( indeed the function @xmath50 used to find the exact solution ( [ eq : eqex ] ) is closely related to a special case of a schottky - klein prime function ) .",
    "this function is defined in a multiply connected circular region ",
    "one whose boundaries consist purely of circles  and , in certain applications , those circles draw close together .",
    "the hybrid basis scheme is expected to provide a viable means of accurately computing the schottky - klein prime function in such cases .",
