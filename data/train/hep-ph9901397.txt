    "recently , the long - awaited next - to - leading - logarithmic ( nll ) corrections to the balitsky - fadin - kuraev - lipatov ( bfkl ) equation @xcite-@xcite have been completed @xcite .",
    "the bfkl equation is used to resum the large logarithms in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) of the type @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the center - of - mass energy - squared of the partonic scattering process and @xmath6 is of the order of the momentum transfer in the process .",
    "the most obvious result of this nll calculation is the correction to the `` bfkl pomeron '' intercept @xmath7 , which describes the rise of the total cross section with @xmath5 .",
    "the asymptotic form of the high - energy partonic cross section predicted by the leading - logarithmic ( ll ) bfkl resummation is @xmath8 where @xmath9 with @xmath10 the number of colors . at nll one",
    "obtains the @xmath11 correction to @xmath12 .",
    "unfortunately , the nll correction to this parameter is large and negative @xcite .",
    "in addition the saddle - point approximation , which was used to obtain the asymptotic form of equation ( [ regtraj ] ) at ll , gives a cross section which is no longer strictly positive - definite at nll @xcite .",
    "these and other problems have led some researchers to call into question the reliability of the nll bfkl resummation for phenomenological applications @xcite . at",
    "the very least one would like to know what is the meaning of these large nll corrections .",
    "can one understand them and can one control them ?    on inspection , the nll bfkl equation and solution as presented by fadin and lipatov appear to be free of any arbitrary parameters .",
    "let us compare this with another logarithmic resummation , that of a fixed - order perturbative cross section , using a running coupling in the @xmath13 scheme .",
    "at the born - level one calculates the cross section with the running coupling evaluated to ll accuracy .",
    "this cross section depends on an arbitrary parameter @xmath14 , the scale of the running coupling , which determines the size of the resummed logarithm and is usually chosen to be of the order of some relevant scale in the scattering process . at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in the matrix element calculation , one uses the nll calculation of the running coupling , and the dependence on @xmath14 cancels effectively to one higher order in the perturbation expansion .",
    "thus , if all is well , the dependence on @xmath14 is reduced in the nlo calculation .",
    "in fact , the dependence on this parameter is often interpreted as an estimate of the theoretical uncertainty due to higher order corrections .",
    "this leads one to ponder whether there might be a similar arbitrary - parameter dependence hidden in the bfkl resummation . here",
    "the large logarithms that are being resummed arise from the integration over the rapidities of the real and virtual gluons in the squared amplitude . to ll accuracy ,",
    "the exact range of these rapidity integrations is not precisely defined .",
    "one could reduce the range of integration by a small amount and still be within the validity of the ll approximation .",
    "the excluded rapidity range will then resurface as part of the nll correction , and the dependence on this separation between ll and nll should vanish , up to contributions which are formally next - to - next - to - leading - logarithmic ( nnll ) .    with this in mind",
    "we consider a modification of the bfkl equation , where the integration over gluon rapidities @xmath15 is subject to the constraint that @xmath16 , with the parameter @xmath17 assumed to be much less than the total rapidity interval .",
    "this reduces to the standard bfkl equation for @xmath18 .",
    "there are several reasons why a nonzero value of @xmath0 might be preferable .",
    "first , in the derivation of the ll bfkl equation the assumption of multi - regge kinematics was used in extracting the bfkl amplitudes .",
    "that is , contributions which are formally @xmath19 are neglected in the amplitudes .",
    "thus , the region @xmath20 is precisely the region where this approximation is worst .",
    "it makes sense to shift these regions of integration over rapidity into the nll corrections where the assumption of multi - regge kinematics is relaxed .",
    "second , in certain processes such as dijet production at hadron colliders the bfkl calculations greatly overestimate the cross section due to the lack of energy - longitudinal momentum conservation at ll @xcite . by keeping the gluons away from the ends of the rapidity interval",
    ", one can reduce this effect .",
    "again , at nll these regions of the rapidity integration would be added back in , but with energy - longitudinal momentum conservation preserved for the first gluon in the ladder .",
    "finally , we note that the large negative nll corrections suggest that the ll prediction should be reduced , which naturally occurs for @xmath21 .    in the remainder of this paper",
    "we explore the consequences of this modification of the bfkl equation . in section 2",
    "we solve the bfkl equation with the constraint on the rapidity separation at ll and show how this affects the ll prediction for the bfkl pomeron intercept . in section 3",
    "we show how the constraint on the rapidity separation in the bfkl equation is translated into a modification of the small-@xmath22 resummation of the gluon - gluon splitting functions . in section 4",
    "we consider the constrained bfkl equation at nll .",
    "using the fact that the exact high - energy cross section should have no dependence on the arbitrary parameter @xmath0 , we can obtain the @xmath0-dependence of the nll bfkl kernel .",
    "this result is then combined with the standard nll corrections to obtain the nll prediction for the bfkl pomeron intercept as a function of the parameter @xmath0 .",
    "finally , in section 5 we discuss the phenomenological consequences of our results , and we present our conclusions .",
    "in order to be precise , throughout this paper we use the term rapidity to mean the physical rapidity , defined by @xmath23 thus , in the _ multi - regge kinematics _ , which presumes that the produced gluons are strongly ordered in rapidity and have comparable transverse momenta , @xmath24 in these equations , the @xmath25 are the transverse momenta of the emitted gluons , the @xmath26 are the transverse momenta of the reggeized gluons exchanged in the @xmath27-channel , and @xmath28 .",

    "the @xmath0-dependence in this equation just enforces the constraint @xmath16 for each successive emitted gluon in the ladder . to be consistent ,",

    "it has been suggested that this leads to disastrous consequences such as oscillations in the cross section @xcite . at the very least",
    "it shows that the interpretation of @xmath56 as the pomeron intercept @xmath12 is invalid at @xmath18 .",
    "however , for @xmath2 the coefficient @xmath57 becomes positive again , so the modified solution does have a maximum at @xmath53 , and we can again identify @xmath56 with the bfkl pomeron intercept .",
    "this suggests that a value of the rapidity - separation parameter of @xmath124 is more natural than the standard choice of @xmath18 . on this basis",
    ", we estimate the value of the nll bfkl pomeron intercept to be between 0.22 and 0.25 for @xmath3 .",
    "in this paper we have considered the modification of the bfkl resummation by requiring that the rapidities of successively emitted gluons must satisfy the constraint @xmath1 .",
    "the inclusion of an arbitrary `` renormalization '' constant , such as @xmath0 , in the bfkl resummation is a natural thing to do , because in such a resummation of large logarithms one can always redefine the energy scale in the logarithm .",
    "the particular implementation of this arbitrary constant ( the `` renormalization scheme '' ) as a constraint on the rapidity separations is nice because it has an obvious physical interpretation . using this interpretation ,",
    "we have argued and we have seen through specific calculations that the choice of @xmath18 is not the best choice for performing the resummation .",
    "this is analogous to performing a fixed - order calculation using an inappropriate choice of the ultraviolet renormalization scale @xmath14 .",
    "the next - to - leading corrections are large , not because the perturbative calculation is inherently bad , but because one has simply made a poor choice of scale .",
    "we have shown how to consistently include the rapidity - separation constraint , both at ll and at nll . at ll",
    "we find that the prediction for the bfkl pomeron intercept decreases monotonically as @xmath0 increases , while at nll it increases rapidly from @xmath18 and then becomes quite insensitive to @xmath0 for @xmath125 and @xmath3 .",
    "furthermore , the nll corrections are relatively small compared to the ll prediction for @xmath125 .",
    "we have also seen that the eigenvalue has a maximum at @xmath53 as long as @xmath2 , so that the bad behavior seen in the saddle - point approximation is no longer a problem .",
    "it is interesting to note that our results for large @xmath0 are in reasonable agreement with the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , which addresses the question of the large nll corrections by resumming double logarithms in transverse momenta .",
    "presumably , the same sort of correlation effects are being included by the two very different approaches .    in conclusion , we believe that for a reasonable range of the rapidity - separation parameter @xmath0 the modified bfkl formalism is a theoretically consistent and stable resummation of the perturbation series in @xmath99 at high - enough energies .",
    "however , the phenomenological usefulness of this resummation is still an open question .",
    "if we assume that @xmath126 is required to consistently use the modified - bfkl resummation , then one should not expect to see significant deviations from double - logarithmic scaling at small-@xmath22 in the gluon - gluon splitting functions at least until @xmath88 .",
    "similarly , equation ( [ expom ] ) suggests that in large - rapidity dijet production one needs rapidity intervals of @xmath127 before the bfkl formalism would begin to be applicable s , as suggested by mueller and navelet @xcite , one would need @xmath128 , because the first non - trivial term in the perturbative expansion in @xmath129 vanishes . ] . certainly , more detailed phenomenological study , using the insights gained from the nll corrections , is needed in order to assess the importance of bfkl to experiment .",
    "_ acknowledgments _ we would like to thank vittorio del duca and wu - ki tung for useful comments on this manuscript .",
    "an important requirement of our analysis is that the modification of the real and virtual gluon rapidity phase space is handled identically , so that the cancellation of the soft singularities remains intact .",
    "however , it is still possible to include the virtual corrections using a reggeized gluon , although with a slightly more complicated , @xmath0-dependent form . for the modified bfkl equation ( [ bfklnll ] ) we find that the appropriate prescription for reggeizing a gluon of off - shellness @xmath130 is to replace the gluon propagator by @xmath131 where @xmath132 is related to the usual bfkl regge intercept @xmath133 by solving the equation @xmath134 note that the square root in the equation ( [ regglue ] ) occurs because the rapidity phase space modification is defined at the squared - amplitude level , whereas the reggeization is defined at the amplitude level .",
