    "in this short letter we studied two models of slider bearings with nonparallel plates and two types of viscous fluids between the plates .",
    "one of the plates is fixed and other is moving horizontally with a constant velocity .",
    "the work obtained due to the motion of the top plate on lubricant makes the temperature of the viscous layer change , which yields in the properties of the viscous fluid to be affected .",
    "we found the conditions under which the safe operation of the bearing is ensured .",
    "that is , we found two critical temperatures before the lubricant fails .",
    "the first temperature was based on the simpler case of constant viscosity , while the second case was found from the temperature dependent viscosity .",
    "closed form solutions in terms of weber functions were found for the non - constant case .",
    "these findings can be extended to slider bearings with different geometries @xmath125 , and viscosities that depend on temperature differently from the discussion here .",
