    "nowadays , cosmology is a prospering and rapidly changing field of physics .",
    "one could say that cosmology has entered a _ golden age _ with a wealth of new experimental data available , cf .",
    "the other contributions in this proceedings .",
    "in addition theoretical efforts have led to what we call the _ standard cosmological model _ or _ cosmological concordance model_. within this model we are able to explain most of the observations .",
    "but , maybe as a trade - off for simplicity , we have to introduce concepts like dark matter and dark energy within this picture .",
    "unfortunately , so far there has been _ no _ direct detection of a dark matter particle and there seems to be _ no _ deeper theoretical justification for the large amount of dark energy .",
    "this is clearly an embarrassing situation because we can not tell what over 90% of the universe is really made of .    since cosmology combines concepts of many different fields of physics there",
    "exist several distinct approaches to find a remedy for this unsatisfactory situation .",
    "one of them is to change the spacetime geometry and therewith the underlying gravity theory . in this report",
    "we want to focus on the history of non - riemannian cosmological models , which we track back to the early seventies . for reviews covering non - riemannian gravity theories",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and references therein .",
    "one usually talks about non - riemannian spacetimes as soon as the connection @xmath0 , which plays a fundamental role in the parallel transport of geometrical objects , is no longer given by the metric compatible christoffel connection that one encounters in einstein s theory of general relativity ( gr ) . the idea to consider more general connections and to think of the connection as an independent object , which is not necessarily tied to the metric",
    ", goes back to the works of @xcite and @xcite . without going into detail",
    "we only mention that the advent of local gauge theories in the 1950s led to a renewed interest in the torsion @xmath1 , i.e.  the new antisymmetric piece of the connection introduced by cartan , which may be related to spin . nowadays",
    "nearly all non - riemannian models may be classified within the language of metric - affine gravity ( mag ) , cf .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "mag represents a gauge theoretical formulation of a gravity theory and can be viewed as a generalization of poincar gauge theory ( pgt ) .",
    "in contrast to riemann - cartan spacetime the connection in a metric - affine spacetime is no longer metric compatible , i.e.  the covariant derivative of the metric does not vanish . the field related to this violation of the metricity condition",
    "is called nonmetricity @xmath2 . in figure",
    "[ figure_spacetime_types ] we depict how one arrives at different spacetime types by switching off torsion @xmath1 and nonmetricity @xmath2 . a very general lagrangian for mag , encompassing more than twenty free parameters and",
    "thereby most of the models considered up to this date , has been suggested by @xcite .",
    "( 140,120 ) ( -72,79)@xmath3 ( -39,65)@xmath4 ( -39,3)@xmath5 ( -123,65)@xmath5 ( -123,3)@xmath4 ( -70,23)@xmath5 ( -92,23)@xmath4     +    in this review only the cosmological models which belong to the so - called nonsymmetric gravity theory ( ngt ) , cf .",
    "@xcite , do not fit into the framework of mag since ngt also allows for antisymmetric metrics .",
    "nonsymmetric metrics were already studied by @xcite in their search for a unified theory for gravity and electromagnetism ( see @xcite for a comprehensive review of unified field theories ) . although this unification was not successful the idea to use more general metrics in order to formulate a generalized theory of gravity persisted .    in the following we use the term non - riemannian cosmology ( nrc ) synonymously for all cosmological models which are no longer tied to a riemannian spacetime structure .",
    "in tables [ table_history1][table_history4 ] we collected ( in chronological order ) the works on nrc beginning in the early 1970s . to our knowledge",
    "this is the most extensive compilation of works which is solely devoted to the subject of non - riemannian _ cosmological _ models .",
    "we hope that this ( very ) condensed compendium proves to be useful for cosmologists who want to get a rough idea of what has been achieved in this field .",
    "of course our compilation is not complete , especially several articles which were published in russian journals had to be omitted since they were out of our reach .",
    "most of the early cosmological models were based on einstein - cartan theory .",
    "investigations mainly revolved around the construction of exact solutions and the question of whether or not an initial singularity can be avoided in such models . in the 1980s more general types of lagrangians were considered .",
    "the inclusion of quadratic terms in the lagrangian , leading to dynamical degrees of freedom , was mainly motivated by the framework of pgt and led to new classes of exact solutions .",
    "the advent of the inflationary model led to a flood of works which tried to mimic or justify this new idea within different non - riemannian scenarios . till the end of the 1990s",
    "most of the works in nrc were focused on the description of the early stages of the universe .",
    "this bias can mainly be ascribed to the estimates for the new spin - spin contact interaction encountered in einstein - cartan theory .",
    "this interaction shows up at extremely high energy densities and might therefore play only a crucial role at planck time scale .",
    "this is not to say that the impact of non - riemannian effects is limited to the early universe , since one has to keep in mind that even tiny changes in the expansion history have profound consequences on the outcome of cosmological tests , such as primordial nucleosynthesis or the magnitude - redshift relation . in recent works",
    "some of these tests have been used to constrain the parameters in several non - riemannian scenarios and thereby the presence of non - riemannian quantities in the late stages of the universe .",
    "challenging experimental results , like the ( non ) detection of dark energy and dark matter , are often the precursors of a shifting of scientific paradigms .",
    "non - riemannian gravity theories seem to offer an ideal playground for cosmologists and their search for an explanation of dark matter and dark energy .",
