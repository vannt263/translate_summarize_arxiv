    "the system of autonomous differential equations with constant delays in the production term @xmath4 was considered in @xcite , where @xmath5 are monotone increasing functions .",
    "it can describe a couple of populations , where the growth of each population is stimulated by the size of the other population and is suppressed by its own growth .",
    "systems of differential equations describing different types of species , where the rate of change for each of them is positively influenced by all other populations but itself , are usually called _",
    "cooperative_. this is in contrast , for example , to competitive systems , where this influence is negative , and predator - prey systems , with different types of influences .",
    "these systems can correspond to the cooperative types of species , or to the patch environment , the growth in each patch is suppressed by overpopulation in itself while stimulated by high density in adjacent patched , due , for example , to possible immigration .",
    "another situation is _ hereditary systems _ where each variable describes a different developmental stage of the same species ( e.g. eggs , larvae , juveniles , adult species capable of reproduction ) . in the case of system ,",
    "@xmath6 and @xmath7 can be juvenile and adult counts , respectively .",
    "there is a competition within each group , as well as natural mortality , and the mortality per capita rate is assumed to be population - independent .",
    "all the growth of juveniles is due to reproduction of adults , while maturation of juveniles contributes to adult numbers .",
    "there are delays in both recruitment processes ( maturation delay for juveniles and reproduction time for adults ) . in line with the above description , model ( [ intro1 ] )",
    "includes delay in the reproduction term only , and the mortality is assumed to be proportional to the current population density .    in the present paper ,",
    "we consider systems of two equations where the growth of each of two variables is stimulated by high numbers in the other ( due to cooperation , or inheriting part of it , or influx of offspring of the other population ) , and call them cooperative or hereditary systems .",
    "the delays of a positive impact can describe the time required to translate nutritional benefits into body mass for the cooperation type . for hereditary systems , we have maturation and reproduction delays .    system ( [ intro1 ] ) includes the two - neuron bidirectional associative memory ( bam ) model @xcite @xmath8 a simplified version of the delay system considered in @xcite @xmath9 is also a particular case of ( [ intro1 ] ) .    another autonomous model @xmath10   \\vspace{2 mm } \\\\",

    "some particular non - delay systems of type ( [ intro2 ] ) were studied in @xcite .",

    "the purpose of the present paper is to explore global asymptotic stability of cooperative systems with a distributed delay , which include ( [ intro1 ] ) and ( [ intro2 ] ) as special cases ; in addition to being distributed , the delay can change with time . distributed delays describe a feasible fact that any interval for delay value has some probability , such models include equations with concentrated ( either constant or variable ) delays .",
    "stability of equations and systems with distributed delays attracted recently much attention , see , for example , @xcite for some recent results and their applications , also see references therein .",
    "the summary of the results obtained by the beginning of 1990ies can be found in @xcite .",
    "the methods applied to establish absolute convergence of the system either to the origin , or to the unique positive equilibrium , or to infinity , goes back to @xcite and was applied in @xcite .",
    "in contrast to our earlier papers @xcite , in the present paper we consider a system , not a single equations .",
    "compared to all other previous work , the main differences are outlined below .",
    "* we consider distributed delays of the most general type ; as particular cases , they include systems with variable concentrated delays , integral terms ( in most papers , distributed delay is associated with these integral terms ) , their combination , and some other models ( for example , cantor function as a distribution ) .",
    "moreover , argument deviations can be lebesgue measurable functions , they are not required to be continuous .",
    "thus the methods developed for continuous delays are not applicable in this setting .",
    "* the delay distributions can be non - autonomous .",
    "if we describe these distributions as a probability that a delay takes a greater than a given value , this corresponds to time - dependent delay . in applications",
    ", this allows to consider , for example , seasonal changes in delay distributions . to some extent",
    ", we explore the most general system with a unique positive equilibrium , and justify global stability of this equilibrium , once delays are involved in those terms only which describe cross - influences .",
    "this is a generalization of the result in @xcite for a system of two autonomous equations with constant concentrated delays . to some extent",
    ", we have answered the question when delays do not have any destabilizing effect on a non - autonomous system of two equations .",
    "* on the other hand , many of the previous papers on distributed delay describe much more complicated dynamics than absolute global stability established in the present paper .",
    "for example , delay dependence of stability properties was studied in @xcite , while possible multistability considered in @xcite . however , the study of systems which can be destabilized by large enough delay are not in the framework of the present paper . here",
    "we restrict ourselves to monotone increasing production functions , which can be treated as positive feedback in the delayed term .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ permanence ] contains existence , positivity and permanence results for models with a distributed delay .",
    "section  [ stability ] presents the global stability theorem which is the main result of the present paper .",
    "finally , section  [ summary ] considers applications and involves some discussion .",
