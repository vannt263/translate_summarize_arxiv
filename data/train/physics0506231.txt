    "in recent years , continuous evolution of third generation light sources has allowed dramatic increase of brilliance with respect to older designs , which has triggered a number of new techniques and experiments unthinkable before . among the most exciting properties of today third generation facilities",
    "is the high flux of coherent x - rays provided .",
    "the availability of intense coherent x - ray beams has fostered the development of new coherence - based techniques like fluctuation correlation dynamics , phase imaging , coherent x - ray diffraction ( cxd ) and x - ray holography . in this context , understanding the evolution of transverse coherence properties of synchrotron radiation ( sr ) along the beam line is of fundamental importance .",
    "in general , when dealing with this problem , one should account for the fact that synchrotron radiation is a random statistical process .",
    "therefore , the evolution of transverse coherence properties should be treated in terms of probabilistic statements : the shot noise in the electron beam causes fluctuations of the beam density which are random in time and space . as a result ,",
    "the radiation produced by such a beam has random amplitudes and phases .",
    "statistical optics @xcite affords convenient tools to deal with fluctuating electromagnetic fields in an appropriate way . among the most important quantities needed to describe coherent phenomena in the framework of statistical optics",
    "is the correlation function of the electric field . in any interference experiment",
    "one needs to know the system ( second order ) correlation function of the signal at a certain time and position with the signal at another time and position . alternatively , and equivalently , one can describe the same experiment in frequency domain . in this case one",
    "is interested in the correlation function of the fourier transform of the time domain signal at a certain frequency and position with the fourier transform of the time domain signal at another frequency and position .",
    "the signal one is interested to study is , indeed , the fourier transform of the original signal in time domain . in sr experiments the analysis in frequency domain is much more natural than that in the time domain .",
    "in fact , up - to - date detectors are limited to about @xmath3 ps time resolution and they are by no means able to resolve a single x - ray pulse in time domain .",
    "they work , instead , by counting the number of photons at a certain frequency over an integration time longer than the radiation pulse .",
    "therefore , in this paper we will deal with signals in the frequency domain and we will often refer to the `` fourier transform of the electric field '' simply as `` the field '' .    for some particular experiment",
    "one may be interested in higher order correlation functions ( for instance , in the correlation between the intensities ) which , in general , must be calculated separately . in the particular case",
    "when the field fluctuations can be described as a gaussian process , the field is often said to obey gaussian statistics . in this case , with the help of the moment theorem @xcite one can recover correlation functions of any order from the knowledge of the second order one : this constitutes a great simplification to the task of describing coherence properties of light .",
    "a practical example of a field obeying gaussian statistics is constituted by the case of polarized thermal light .",
    "this is more than a simple example : in fact , statistical optics has largely developed in connection with problems involving optical sources emitting thermal light like the sun , other stars , or incandescent lamps . as a consequence",
    ", gaussian statistics is often taken for granted .",
    "anyway , it is not _ a priori _ clear wether synchrotron radiation fields obey it or not ; our analysis will show that synchrotron radiation is indeed a gaussian random process .",
    "therefore , as is also the case for polarized thermal light and any other signal obeying gaussian statistics , when we deal with synchrotron radiation the basic quantity to consider is the second order correlation function of the field .",
    "moreover , as already discussed , in synchrotron radiation experiments it is natural to work in the space - frequency domain , so that we will focus , in particular , on the second order correlation function in the space - frequency domain .",
    "besides obeying gaussian statistics , polarized thermal light has two other specific properties allowing simplifications of the theory : the first is stationarity and the second is quasi - homogeneity .",
    "exactly as the property of gaussian statistics , also stationarity and quasi - homogeneity of the source are usually taken for granted in statistical optics problems but , unlike it , they do not belong , in general , to synchrotron radiation fields .",
    "in fact , as we will show , synchrotron radiation fields are intrinsically non - stationary and not always quasi - homogeneous .",
    "nevertheless , up to now it has been a widespread practice to assume that undulator sources are completely incoherent ( i.e. homogeneous ) and to apply the well known van cittert - zernike ( vcz ) theorem for calculating the degree of transverse coherence in the far - field approximation @xcite .",
    "using the vcz theorem , the electric field cross - correlation function in the far field is usually calculated ( aside for a geometrical phase factor ) as a fourier transformation of the intensity distribution of the source , customarily located at the exit of the undulator .",
    "although the vcz theorem only deals with completely incoherent sources , there exists an analogous generalized version of it which allows to extend the treat the case of quasi - homogeneous sources as well .",
    "actually there is no unambiguous choice of terminology in literature regarding the scope of the vcz theorem .",
    "for instance , a very well - known textbook @xcite reports of a `` zernike - propagation '' equation dealing with any distance from the source . also ,",
    "sometimes @xcite , the generalized vcz theorem is referred to as schell s theorem ( and also used in some paper @xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we will refer to the vcz theorem and its generalized version only in the limit for a large distance from the source and for , respectively , homogeneous and quasi - homogeneous sources .",
    "however , irrespectively of different denominations , the fundamental fact holds , that once a cross - correlation function is known on a given source plane it can be propagated through the beamline at any distance from the source .",
    "it should be noted that , from this viewpoint , a source simply denotes an initial plane down the beamline from which the cross - correlation function is propagated further .",
    "then , the position of the source down the beamline is suggested only on the ground of opportunity . on the contrary ,",
    "when dealing with the vcz theorem , the source must be ( quasi)-homogeneous which explains the customary location at the exit of the undulator .    in some cases , the vcz theorem or its generalized version may provide a convenient method for calculating the degree of transverse coherence in various parts of the beamline once the transverse coherence properties of the photon beam are specified at the exit of the undulator , that is at the source plane . in most sr applications",
    "though , such treatment is questionable .",
    "first , the source ( even at the exit of the undulator ) may not be quasi - homogeneous .",
    "second , even for specific sets of problem parameters where the quasi - homogeneous model is accurate , the specification of the far - field zone depends not only on the electron beam sizes , but also on the electron beam divergencies ( in both direction ) and on the intrinsic divergence of the radiation connected with the undulator device . at the time being , widespread and a - critical use of the vcz theorem and its generalization shows that there is no understanding of transverse coherence properties of x - ray beams in third generation synchrotron radiation sources .    if , on the one hand , the definition of the far - zone and the possible non quasi - homogeneity of sr sources constitute serious problems in the description of the coherence properties of synchrotron light , on the other hand the intrinsic non - stationarity of the sr process does not play a very important role . in particular , as we will show , assumption of a minimal undulator bandwidth much larger than the characteristic inverse bunch duration ( which is always verified in practice ) allows to separate the correlation function in space - frequency domain in the product of two functions .",
    "the first function is a spectral correlation describing correlation in frequency .",
    "the second function describes correlation in space and is well - known also in the case of stationary processes as the cross - spectral density of the process .",
    "then , the cross - spectral density can be studied independently at any given frequency giving information on the spatial correlation of the field .",
    "subsequently , the knowledge of the spectral correlation function brings back the full expression for the space - frequency correlation .    in this paper",
    "we aim at the development of a theory of transverse coherence capable of providing very specific predictions , relevant to practice , regarding the cross - spectral density of undulator radiation at various positions along the beam - line .",
    "a fully general study of undulator sources is not a trivial one .",
    "difficulties arise when one tries to include simultaneously the effect of intrinsic divergence of the radiation due to the presence of the undulator , of electron beam size and electron beam divergence into the insertion device .",
    "the full problem , including all effects , poses an unsolvable analytical challenge , and numerical calculations are to be preferred .",
    "generally , the cross - spectral density of the undulator radiation is controlled by nine physical parameters which model both the electron beam and the undulator : the horizontal and vertical geometrical emittances of the electron beam @xmath4 , the horizontal and vertical minimal betatron functions @xmath5 , the observation distance down the beamline @xmath6 , the observation frequency @xmath7 , the undulator resonant frequency @xmath8 , the undulator length @xmath9 and the length of the undulator period @xmath10 .",
    "we will make a consistent use of dimensional analysis .",
    "dimensional analysis of any problem , performed prior to analytical or numerical investigations , not only reduces the number of independent terms , but also allows one to classify the grouping of dimensional variables in a way that is most suitable for subsequent study . the algorithm for calculating the cross - spectral density can be formulated as a relation between dimensionless quantities . after appropriate normalization ,",
    "the radiation cross - spectral density from an undulator device is described by six dimensionless quantities : the normalized emittances @xmath11 , the normalized betatron functions @xmath12 , the normalized observation distance @xmath13 and the normalized detuning parameter @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the number of undulator periods .    at some point in this work",
    "we will find it convenient to pose @xmath16 .",
    "in other words we will assume that parameters are tuned at perfect resonance .",
    "it is relevant to note that even under this simplifying assumptions , conditions for the undulator source to be quasi - homogeneous still include four parameters @xmath17 and @xmath18 . for storage rings that are in operation or planned in the @xmath19ngstrom wavelength range , the parameter variation of @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22",
    "are possible : these include many practical situations in which the assumption of quasi - homogeneous sources and , therefore the ( generalized ) vcz theorem , is not accurate .    in this paper we will first deal with the most general case of non - homogeneous sources .",
    "in fact , from a practical viewpoint , it is important to determine the cross - spectral density as a function of @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "once a general expression for the cross - spectral density is found , it can be used as a basis for numerical calculations .",
    "a second goal of this work is to find the region of applicability of the quasi - homogeneous source model ( i.e. of the generalized vcz theorem ) which will arise automatically from the dimensional analysis of the problem .",
    "finally , we will derive analytical expressions for the cross - spectral density at @xmath25 in various parts of the beamline .",
    "results may also be obtained using numerical techniques alone , starting from the lienard - wiechert expressions for the electromagnetic field and applying the definition of the field correlation function without any analytical manipulation . yet",
    ", computer codes can calculate properties for a given set of parameters , but can hardly improve physical understanding , which is particularly important in the stage of planning experiments : understanding of correct approximations and their region of applicability with the help of a consistent use of dimensional analysis can simplify many tasks a lot , including practical and non - trivial ones .",
    "moreover , at the time being , no code capable to deal with transverse coherence problems has been developed at all .",
    "it should be noted that some theoretical attempt to follow this path has been proposed in @xcite . among the results of that paper",
    "is the fact that van cittert - zernike theorem could not be applied unless the electron beam divergence is much smaller than the diffraction angle , which is never verified in practice in the horizontal plane .",
    "we will show that this conclusion is incorrect .",
    "we organize our work as follows .",
    "after this introduction , in section [ sec : theory ] we present a second - order theory of coherence for fields generated by synchrotron radiation sources . in section [ sec : evol ] we give a derivation of the cross - spectral density for undulator - based sources in reduced units .",
    "subsequently , we analyze the evolution of the cross - spectral density function through the beamline in the limit for @xmath25 .",
    "a particular case of quasi - homogeneous sources and its applicability region is treated under several simplifying assumptions in section [ sec : quasi ] .",
    "effects of the vertical emittance on the cross - spectral density are discussed in detail in section [ sec : twod ] , while a treatment of some non quasi - homogeneous source is given in the following section [ sec : nonh ] .",
    "obtained results include approximate design formula capable of describing in very simple terms the evolution of the coherence length along the beamline in many situation of practical interest .",
    "a good physical insight is useful to identify possible applications of given phenomena .",
    "in particular in section [ sec : spot ] we selected one practical application to exploit the power of our approach .",
    "we show that , by means of a simple vertical slit , it is possible to manipulate transverse coherence properties of an x - ray beam to obtain a convenient coherent spot - size on the sample .",
    "this invention was devised almost entirely on the basis of theoretical ideas of rather complex and abstract nature which have been described in this paper .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : concl ] , we come to conclusions .",
    "a great majority of optical sources emits thermal light . such is the case of the sun and the other stars , as well as of incandescent lamps .",
    "this kind of radiation consists of a large number of independent contributions ( radiating atoms ) and is characterized by random amplitudes and phases in space and time .",
    "the electromagnetic fields can be then conveniently described in terms of statistical optics , a branch of physics that has been intensively developed during the last few decades .",
    "today one can take advantage of a lot of existing experience and theoretical basis for the descriptions of fluctuating electromagnetic fields @xcite .",
    "light intensity from an incandescent lamp driven by a constant electric current .",
    "a statistically stationary wave has an average that does not vary with time.,width=529 ]    consider the light emitted by a thermal source passing through a polarization analyzer ( see fig .",
    "[ thermal ] ) .",
    "properties of polarized thermal light are well - known in statistical optics , and are referred to as properties of completely chaotic , polarized light @xcite .",
    "thermal light is a statistical random process and statements about such process are probabilistic statements .",
    "statistical processes are handled using the concept of statistical ensemble , drawn from statistical mechanics , and statistical averages are performed indeed , over many ensembles , or realizations , or outcomes of the statistical process under study .",
    "polarized thermal light is a very particular kind of random process in that it is gaussian , stationary and ergodic .",
    "let us discuss these characteristics in more detail .",
    "the properties of gaussian random processes are well - known in statistical optics .",
    "for instance , the real and imaginary part of the complex amplitudes of the electric field from a polarized thermal source have gaussian distribution , while the instantaneous radiation power fluctuates in accordance with the negative exponential distribution .",
    "gaussian statistics alone , guarantees that higher - order correlation functions can be expressed in terms of second - order correlation functions .",
    "moreover , it can be shown @xcite that a linearly filtered gaussian process is also a gaussian random process . as a result , the presence of a spectral filter ( monochromator ) and a spatial filter as in the system depicted in fig .",
    "[ thermal ] do not change the statistics of the signal , because they simply act as linear filters .",
    "stationarity is a subtle concept .",
    "there are different kinds of stationarity .",
    "strict - stationarity means that all ensemble averages are independent on time .",
    "wide - sense stationarity means that the signal average is independent on time and that the second order correlation function in time depends only on the difference of the observation times .",
    "however , for gaussian processes strict and wide - sense stationarity coincide @xcite . as a consequence of the definition of stationarity , necessary condition for a certain process to be stationary",
    "is that the signal last forever . yet ,",
    "if a signal lasts much longer than its coherence time @xmath26 ( which fixes the short - scale duration of the field fluctuations ) and it is observed for a time much shorter than its duration @xmath27 , but much longer than its coherence time it can be reasonably considered as everlasting and it has a chance to be stationary as well , as in the case of thermal light .",
    "ergodicity is a stronger requirement than stationarity .",
    "qualitatively , we may state that if , for a given random process all ensemble averages can be substituted by time averages , the process under study is said to be ergodic : all the statistical properties of the process can be derived from one single realization .",
    "a process must be strictly stationary in order to be ergodic .",
    "there exist stationary processes which are not ergodic .",
    "one may consider , for instance , the random constant process : this is trivially strictly stationary , but not ergodic because a single ( constant ) realization of the process does not allow one to characterize the process from a statistical viewpoint .",
    "however , this is a pathologic case when both the coherence time @xmath26 and the duration time of the signal @xmath27 are infinite . on the contrary ,",
    "a stationary process like the radiation from an incandescent lamp driven by a constant current has , virtually , infinite duration . in this case",
    "different ensembles are simply different observations , for given time intervals , of the same , statistically identical phenomenon : then , the concept of ensemble average and time average are equivalent and the process is also ergodic .",
    "statistical optics was developed starting with signals characterized by gaussian statistics , stationarity and ergodicity .",
    "let us consider any synchrotron radiation source .",
    "like thermal light , also synchrotron radiation is a random process .",
    "in fact , relativistic electrons in a storage ring emit synchrotron radiation passing through bending magnets or undulators .",
    "the electron beam shot noise causes fluctuations of the beam density which are random in time and space from bunch to bunch . as a result ,",
    "the radiation produced has random amplitudes and phases .",
    "as already declared in the introduction we will demonstrate that the sr field obeys gaussian statistics .",
    "in contrast with thermal light though , synchrotron radiation is intrinsically non - stationary ( and , therefore , non - ergodic ) because even if its short pulse duration can not be resolved by detectors working in the time domain , it can nonetheless be resolved by detectors working in frequency domain .",
    "for this reason , in what follows the averaging brackets @xmath28 will always indicate the ensemble average over bunches .     the intensity of an x - ray beam from a synchrotron radiation source .",
    "a statistically non - stationary wave has a time - varying intensity averaged over an ensemble of bunches.,width=529 ]    in spite of differences with respect to the simpler case of thermal light , as we will see in this paper , also synchrotron radiation fields can be described in terms of statistical optics .",
    "[ sr ] shows the geometry of the experiment under consideration .",
    "the problem is to describe the statistical properties of synchrotron radiation at the detector installed after the spatial and spectral filters .",
    "radiation at the detector consists of a carrier modulation of frequency @xmath7 subjected to random amplitude and phase modulation .",
    "the fourier decomposition of the radiation contains frequencies spread about the monochromator bandwidth @xmath29 : it is not possible , in practice , to resolve the oscillations of the radiation fields which occur at the frequency of the carrier modulation .",
    "it is therefore appropriate , for comparison with experimental results , to average the theoretical results over a cycle of oscillations of the carrier modulation .",
    "reciprocal width relations of fourier transform pairs.,width=529 ]    fig .",
    "[ avecarr ] gives a qualitative illustration of the type of fluctuations that occur in cycle - averaged synchrotron radiation beam intensity . within some characteristic time ,",
    "a given random function appears to be smooth , but when observed at larger scales the same random function exhibits `` rough '' variations .",
    "the time scale of random fluctuations is the coherence time @xmath26 . when @xmath30 the radiation beyond the monochromator is partially coherent .",
    "this case is shown in fig .",
    "[ avecarr ] : there , we can estimate @xmath31 .",
    "if the radiation beyond the monochromator is partially coherent , a spiky spectrum is to be expected .",
    "the nature of the spikes is easily described in terms of fourier transform theory .",
    "we can expect that the typical width of the spectrum envelope should be of order of @xmath32 .",
    "also , the spectrum of the radiation from a bunch with typical duration @xmath27 at the source plane should contain spikes with characteristic width @xmath33 , as a consequence of the reciprocal width relations of fourier transform pairs ( see , again , fig .",
    "[ avecarr ] ) .",
    "we start our discussion in the most generic way possible , considering a fixed polarization component of the fourier transform at frequency @xmath7 of the electric field produced at location @xmath34 , in some cartesian coordinate system , by a given collection of sources",
    ". we will denote it with @xmath35 and it will be linked to the time domain field @xmath36 through the fourier transform    @xmath37    so that @xmath38 this very general collection of sources includes the case of an ultra relativistic electron beam going through a certain magnetic system and in particular an undulator , which is our case of interest . in this case",
    "@xmath6 is simply the observation distance along the optical axis of the system and @xmath39 are the transverse coordinates of the observer on the observation plane .",
    "the contribution of the @xmath40-th electron to the field fourier transform at the observation point depends on the transverse offset @xmath41 and deflection angles @xmath42 that the electron has at the entrance of the system with respect to the optical axis .",
    "moreover , an arrival time @xmath43 at the system entrance has the effect of multiplying the field fourier transform by a phase factor @xmath44 ( that is , in time domain the electric field is retarded by a time @xmath43 ) .",
    "at this point we do not need to specify explicitly the dependence on offset and deflection .",
    "the total field fourier transform can be written as    @xmath45    where @xmath46 and @xmath43 are random variables and @xmath47 is the number of electrons in the beam .",
    "it follows from eq .",
    "( [ total ] ) that the fourier transform of the synchrotron radiation pulse at a fixed frequency and a fixed point in space is a sum of a great many independent contributions , one for each electron , of the form @xmath48 .",
    "for simplicity we make three assumptions about the statistical properties of elementary phasors composing the sum , which are generally satisfied in synchrotron radiation problems of interest .",
    "\\1 ) we assume that for a beam circulating in a storage ring random variables @xmath49 are independent from @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "this is always verified , because the random arrival times of electrons , due to shot noise , do not depend on the electrons offset and deflection with respect to the @xmath52-direction .",
    "( [ total ] ) states that the @xmath40-th elementary contribution to the total @xmath53 can be written as a product of the complex phasors @xmath54 , and @xmath55 that , in its turn , can be written as a product of modulus and phase as @xmath56 . under the assumption of statistical independence of @xmath49 from @xmath50 and",
    "@xmath51 the complex phasors @xmath44 , and @xmath55 are statistically independent of each other and of all the other elementary phasors for different values of @xmath40 .",

    "independence of @xmath49 from @xmath50 and @xmath51 allows us to write    @xmath60    where we also assumed that the distribution in the horizontal and vertical planes are not correlated . since electrons arrival times are completely uncorrelated from transverse coordinates and offsets , the shapes of @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the same for all electrons .",
    "\\2 ) we assume that the random variables @xmath64 ( at fixed frequency @xmath7 ) , are identically distributed for all values of @xmath40 , with a finite mean @xmath65 and a finite second moment @xmath66 .",

    "[ phasor ] . under the three previously discussed assumptions we can use the central limit theorem to conclude that the real and the imaginary part of @xmath71 are distributed in accordance to a gaussian law",

    "therefore , for synchrotron radiation related issues the frequency domain is much more natural a choice than the time domain , and we will deal with signals in the frequency domain throughout this paper .",
    "the knowledge of the second - order field correlation function in frequency domain    @xmath72    is all we need to completely characterize the signal from a statistical viewpoint . for the sake of completeness",
    "it is nonetheless interesting to remark that it is possible ( and often done , in statistical optics ) to give equivalent descriptions of the process in time domain as well .",
    "first , note that the time domain process @xmath73 is linked to @xmath74 by fourier transform , and that a linearly filtered gaussian process is also a gaussian process ( see @xcite 3.6.2 ) . as a result",

    "yet we have seen that , when the electron distribution in angles and offsets are gaussian and @xmath391 and @xmath335 , the vcz theorem holds also in the case @xmath447 , when the source is non quasi - homogeneous in the usual sense .",
    "we have seen that the situation can be equivalently described with the help of a virtual quasi - homogeneous source in the middle of the undulator .",
    "however , such an interpretation is only valid _ a posteriori_. for the case @xmath391 and @xmath448 there is a non quasi - homogeneous wavefront at the undulator exit ;",

    "this means that operation of spatial filtering in the near field region , as proposed by us , will not diminish the number of coherent photons with respect to the usual practice in which spatial filtering to obtain coherent radiation is performed in the far field : its effect will only be that of increasing the horizontal dimension of the coherent spot size .",
    "this possibility to create transversely coherent radiation with large divergence in the horizontal direction is important for many experiments .",
    "the distance of the slit from the exit of the undulator sets a limit to achievable linear dimension of coherence area .",
    "if we build a coherent x - ray beam line , we want to have large linear dimension of coherence area at the specimen position .",
    "therefore , in order to have a largest linear dimension of coherence area at the specimen position @xmath823 we must have a slit aperture of at most of the size @xmath824 installed in the near zone at @xmath825 . in order not to loose coherent photons instead",
    ", the slit aperture must be at least of the size @xmath824 .",
    "the right compromise is thus a slit aperture of the size @xmath826 installed in the near zone at @xmath813 .",
    "before this work , no satisfactory theory describing spatial coherence from undulator radiation sources has been built . in this paper",
    "we developed such a theory of transverse coherence dealing with x - ray beams , with particular attention to third generation light sources .",
    "first we studied synchrotron radiation as a random statistical process using the language of statistical optics .",
    "statistical optics developed around gaussian , stationary processes characterized by quasi - homogeneous sources ; under these assumptions , the characterization of statistical properties of the process are greatly simplified and the van cittert - zernike theorem ( or its generalized version ) can be used in order to describe the x - ray beam partial coherence properties in the far field region . however , for synchrotron radiation , there is no _ a priori _ reason to hold these assumptions satisfied .",
    "we showed that synchrotron radiation is a gaussian random process . as a result",
    ", statistical properties of synchrotron radiation are described satisfactory by second - order field correlation functions .",
    "we used a frequency domain analysis to describe them from a mathematical viewpoint .",
    "this choice is very natural .",
    "in fact , up - to - date detectors are limited to about @xmath3 ps time resolution : therefore , in real - life experiments with third generation light sources , detectors are by no means able to resolve a single x - ray pulse in time domain and work , instead , by counting the number of photons at a certain frequency over an integration time longer than the radiation pulse . as a consequence of the frequency domain analysis we could study the spatial correlation for a given frequency content using the cross - spectral density of the system which",
    ", independently of the spectral correlation function , can be used to extract useful information even if the process is not stationary .",
    "we gave an expression for the process cross - spectral density dependent on six dimensionless parameters .",
    "subsequently we tuned parameters at perfect resonance , thus obtaining a simplified expression .",
    "first we studied the limit of applicability of the quasi - homogeneous model from an analytical viewpoint , within the framework of simplifying assumptions , namely in the limit of small electron beam divergence and fresnel number in the vertical direction , of large electron beam divergence and fresnel number in the horizontal direction , and performing calculations for the cross - spectral density on the horizontal plane only .",
    "this simplified study allowed us to introduce the concept of weakly quasi - homogeneous radiation and virtual quasi - homogeneous source while discussing the applicability region of the vcz theorem .",
    "second , we studied the effect of the vertical emittance on the cross - spectral density .",
    "this study led us to analyze both cases in which the sources are weakly quasi - homogeneous and cases when they are not quasi - homogeneous at all . in the limit for large horizontal beam divergence and fresnel number , which is always satisfied for third generation light sources",
    ", we found that the spectral degree of coherence factorizes in the product of factors depending separately on the horizontal and on the vertical coordinates . in the far field",
    "limit the vertical part of the spectral degree of coherence can be expressed in terms of the product of an exponential function ( which , alone , would simply satisfy the vcz theorem ) and convolutions between the electron beam divergence in the vertical direction and a universal functions , that we introduced in our work .",
    "the universality of such a function implied that even for zero vertical emittance we never have full coherence in the vertical direction .",
    "this unexpected result is due to the influence of the horizontal emittance on the vertical coherence properties of the photon beam . because of this , the degree of coherence changes between zero and unity within the diffraction angle .",
    "we also studied the near field zone .",
    "when one is interested in the evolution of the degree of coherence along the beamline back up to the exit of the undulator the situation becomes much more complicated with respect to the far zone case , as the observation distance is one of the problem parameters .",
    "there are many more asymptotic situations which can be studied , and a large part of our paper is devoted to the calculation of these asymptotic situations .",
    "we provided approximate estimations for the vertical coherence length that are valid from the far zone and back , up to the exit of the undulator in the case when either the vertical fresnel number or the vertical electron beam divergence are much larger than unity .",
    "these can be used at the stage of planning experiments .",
    "it should be noted that , throughout this work , we did not discuss the accuracy of the approximation of small and large parameters . in order to do so",
    ", one needs to develop a perturbation theory for each asymptotic case studied here , which would considerably increase the size of this paper . as a result",
    "we leave this issue for future work .    finally , we selected an application to show the power of our approach .",
    "we discussed how the transverse coherence properties of an x - ray beam can be manipulated to obtain a convenient coherent spot - size on the sample with the help of a simple vertical slit ; this invention was predicted almost entirely on the basis of theoretical ideas of rather complex and abstract nature discussed in the previous parts of the paper .",
    "the field of thermal light can be regarded as a sum of a great many independent contributions .",
    "the complex envelope of polarized thermal light at fixed time and a fixed point in space is a sum of a very large number of complex phasors    @xmath827    where @xmath47 is the number of radiating atoms .",
