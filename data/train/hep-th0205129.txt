    "the thermodynamics of asymptotically anti - de sitter ( ads ) black holes continues to attract a great deal of attention .",
    "this is due to the fact that there is a correspondence between super gravity ( the low energy limit of string theory ) in @xmath0-dimensional asymptotically ads spacetimes and conformal field theory ( cft ) living on an @xmath1-dimensional boundary known as the ads / cft correspondence @xcite .",
    "indeed , one can gain some insight into the thermodynamic properties and phase structures of strong t hooft coupling conformal field theories by studying the thermodynamics of asymptotically ads black holes .",
    "a standard example of the ads / cft correspondence is the interpretation of the hawking - page phase transition from a low - temperature confining to a high - temperature deconfining phase in the dual field theory @xcite .",
    "the ads / cft correspondence is now a fundamental concept which furnish a means for calculating the action and thermodynamical quantities intrinsically without reliance on any reference spacetime @xcite .",
    "this conjecture has been recently extended to the case of asymptotically de sitter spacetimes @xcite .",
    "although the ( a)ds / cft correspondence applies for the case of spacially infinite boundary , it was also employed for the computation of the conserved and thermodynamic quantities in the case of a finite boundary @xcite .",
    "this conjecture has also been used for the case of black objects with nonspherical horizons @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the einstein equation with positive or negative cosmological constant has black hole solutions with horizons being positive , zero , or negative constant curvature hypersurfaces @xcite .",
    "the rotating solutions of the einstein equation with a negative cosmological constant with cylindrical and toroidal horizons have been studied in ref .",
    "the extension to include the maxwell field has been done and the static and rotating electrically charged black string have been considered in ref .",
    "recently , asymptotically anti - de sitter spacetimes generated by static and spinning magnetic string sources in general relativity have been also considered @xcite .",
    "the thermodynamics of asymptotically anti - de sitter spacetimes with nonspherical horizon has been studied by many authors @xcite . in this paper , we want to apply the ads / cft correspondence to the asymptotically anti - de sitter charged rotating black string in four dimensions with cylindrical or toroidal event horizons , and study their thermodynamics in both the canonical and the grand - canonical ensemble .",
    "the stability conditions are investigated and a complete phase diagram is obtained .",
    "we also introduce the asymptotic de sitter charged rotating black strings with cylindrical and toroidal horizon and calculate their conserved quantities and euclidean actions in both the canonical and the grand - canonical ensemble .",

    "the first term is the einstein - hilbert volume term with negative ( ads ) or positive ( ds ) cosmological constant @xmath7 , and the second term is the gibbons - hawking boundary term which is chosen such that the variational principle is well - defined .",

    "( [ actg ] ) are both divergent when evaluated on the solutions , as is the hamiltonian , and other associated conserved quantities . rather than eliminating these divergences by incorporating a reference term in the spacetime @xcite , a new term , @xmath15 , is added to the action which is a functional only of the boundary curvature invariants .",
    "the counterterms for asymptotically ads and ds spacetimes in four dimensions are @xcite : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the ricci scalar of the boundary metric @xmath18 .",
    "the @xmath19 and @xmath20 sign correspond to asymptotically ads and ds spacetimes , respectively .",
    "these counterterms have been used by many authors for a wide variety of the spacetimes , including schwarzschild-(a)ds , topological schwarzschild-(a)ds , kerr-(a)ds , taub - nut ( newmann - unti - tamborino)-ads , taub - bolt - ads , and taub - bolt - kerr - ads @xcite .",
    "the total action can be written as a linear combination of the gravity term ( [ actg ] ) and the counterterms ( [ actct ] ) as @xmath21 in order to obtain the einstein - maxwell field equations by the variation of the volume integral with respect to the fields , one should impose the boundary condition @xmath22 on @xmath23 .",

    "provided the surface @xmath27 contains the orbits of @xmath41 .",
    "these quantities are , respectively , the conserved mass and angular momentum of the system enclosed by the boundary . note that they will both be dependent on the location of the boundary @xmath27 in the spacetime , although each is independent of the particular choice of foliation @xmath42 within the surface @xmath12 .    in the context of the ( a)ds / cft correspondence , the limit in which the boundary @xmath27 becomes infinite ( @xmath43 ) is taken , and the counterterm prescription ensures that the action and conserved charges are finite .",
    "no embedding of the surface @xmath27 into a reference spacetime is required and the quantities which are computed are intrinsic to the spacetimes .",
