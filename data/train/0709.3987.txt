    "about a decade ago , surveys for molecular gas in early - type galaxies began to show significant detection rates ( e.g.  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lees et al.1991 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* wiklind et al .  1995 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* knapp & rupen 1996 ) ) .",
    "the difficulty was that the surveys had very strong selection biases towards galaxies that are bright at 100@xmath1 m , and it was virtually impossible to know how to extrapolate to fir - faint galaxies . in recent years",
    "this limitation has been removed and there are now deeper surveys of less biased samples .",
    "@xcite found a surprisingly high co detection rate of @xmath2 in a volume - limited sample of nearby field lenticular galaxies , and @xcite detected co emission in @xmath3 of a similar sample of field ellipticals .",
    "@xcite also detected co emission in @xmath4 of the early - types in the sauron survey ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* de zeeuw et al .  2002 ) ) , which is not a complete sample in any sense but has the advantage that the gas content can be compared to information on the stellar populations , internal dynamics , and ionized gas . in short , when the samples are not fir - biased there are still a significant number of early - type galaxies showing co emission .",
    "cold gas masses are highly variable however , with @xmath5 in the range @xmath6 to @xmath7 and lower .",
    "the strongest connection between cold gas and galaxy properties is as expected with indicators of recent star formation , including stronger h@xmath8 emission and absorption ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* combes et al.2007 ) ) .",
    "@xcite also discuss the connections between molecular gas , star formation , radio continuum and fir emission , and the co detection rate in early - types is at least superficially consistent with the incidence of star formation derived from galex uv data ( e.g.  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* yi et al .  2007 ) ;",
    "* kaviraj et al.2007 ) ) .",
    "thus , the present gas content of early - type galaxies does clearly reveal the potential for star formation and disk growth .",
    "the morphological changes that can be effected in early - type galaxies by star formation , and the ease with which feedback can disrupt it , will all depend on the distribution of the molecular gas .",
    "a few early - types have now had their co emission mapped by millimeter interferometers , e.g.  @xcite , @xcite , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* young ( 2002 , 2005 ) ) , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . the molecular gas is typically found in regular , kpc - scale rotating disks with masses of a few @xmath9 to a few @xmath10  m@xmath11 of molecular hydrogen .",
    "the disk radii range from a tenth up to a few effective radii of the stellar distribution .",
    "the average surface densities are often @xmath12 m@xmath11  pc@xmath13 and higher , comparable to the molecular surface densities in spirals .    when both molecular maps and two - dimensional optical spectroscopy are available , there is usually good evidence for a young stellar disk coincident with the molecular disk .",
    "the most dramatic example is the virgo cluster lenticular ngc  4526 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : ngc4526 ] ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* young et al .  2008 ) ) , which has embedded in its bulge a dynamically cold kpc - scale stellar disk with a substantially younger mean age than the rest of the bulge ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* emsellem et al.2004 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* kuntschner et al .  2006 ) ) .",
    "the [ o iii]/h@xmath8 line ratios are also suggestive of current star formation activity ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sarzi et al .  2006 ) ) and the ionized gas kinematics follow the molecular kinematics , albeit at somewhat smaller velocity amplitude .",
    "based on the fir flux , the star formation rate in ngc  4526 is roughly @xmath14 m@xmath11  yr@xmath15 , giving a gas depletion timescale of @xmath16 yr .",
    "but the total molecular mass now present in the galaxy is only @xmath17 of the total stellar mass , so that even if there was substantially more molecular gas in the recent past it can not make more than a small frosting of young stars .",
    "the virgo lenticular ngc  4459 is a similar case ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* young et al .  2008 ) ) .",
    "image ( left ) and the stellar velocity field ( right ; greyscale and black contours ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* young et al .",
    "co contours are at @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 of the peak ( @xmath25  jy  beam@xmath15  km  s@xmath15 ) .",
    "velocity contours are from @xmath26 to @xmath27 km  s@xmath15  in intervals of @xmath22 km  s@xmath15.,title=\"fig : \" ] image ( left ) and the stellar velocity field ( right ; greyscale and black contours ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* young et al .",

    "velocity contours are from @xmath26 to @xmath27 km  s@xmath15  in intervals of @xmath22 km  s@xmath15.,title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "for at least 30 years it has been speculated that early - type galaxies should have a substantial cold ism originating in mass loss from their own evolved stars ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* faber & gallagher 1976 ) ) . a modern version of the theory , complete with heating , cooling , a proper cosmological context and the influence of agn can be found in @xcite and references therein .",
    "it is also well known that mergers and the accretion of satellites and/or cold gas can be important mechanisms for galaxy growth .",
    "the relative importance of internal and external gas sources for early - type galaxies is not yet well known , but angular momentum can provide a strong constraint since internally produced gas must have a specific angular momentum consistent with that of the stars in the galaxy .",
    "@xcite have measured the distribution of the misalignment angle between the stellar and ionized - gas kinematic major axes for the sauron sample .",
    "they find evidence for ionized gas from both internal origins ( a large peak of galaxies with no misalignment ) and external origins ( a long tail of misalignments out to @xmath28 , counterrotation ) .",
    "the corresponding data for molecular gas are much more rare , but appear to be consistent with the above picture ( see also ( * ? ? ?",
    "* bureau & chung 2006 ) ) . of the four lenticulars mapped by @xcite , one ( ngc  3032 ) has molecular gas counterrotating with respect to the stars , so this gas must be left over from a major merger or acquired from an external source . in the obvious merger remnant ngc  3656 ,",
    "the gas disk is roughly perpendicular to the stellar kinematic major axis ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* young 2002 ) ) , and in ngc  2768 the gas forms a polar ring ( or disk ) structure ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* crocker et al.2008 ) ) , but much more commonly the gas disks are aligned with the mean stellar rotation and suggest a contribution from internal mass loss .",
    "ngc  4150 harbours a counter - rotating young stellar core , but strangely the co gas is rotating like the galaxy bulk ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* young et al .  2008 ) )",
    ".    the misaligned molecular disks in ngc  3032 and in ngc  3656 are both massive , kpc - scale , and vigorously forming stars .",
    "clearly , even when the molecular gas has an external origin , it does not always descend into the nucleus of the galaxy to feed and/or be destroyed by an active nucleus .",
    "a better global understanding of the influence of the accreted cold gas on early - type galaxies therefore requires an accurate model for the impact parameters of this gas and the size distribution of the resulting gas disks .",
    "we have seen that kpc - scale molecular disks with @xmath29 to @xmath10 m@xmath11 of molecular gas are relatively common in early - type galaxies at @xmath30 , and the incidence of these disks is probably consistent with current star formation rate estimates based on uv data .",
    "environmental effects on the gas content of early - type galaxies have not been properly explored yet , nor have the possible effects of agn activity to clear cold gas .",
    "the observed molecular disks clearly document the process of disk growth within bulges , a process which must have been of greater importance in the past , but the details remain sketchy .    it is not yet known whether the molecular gas always forms stars ( and whether that result is consistent with our theoretical understanding of star formation processes ) .",
    "it has been hypothesized that molecular disks should be stabilized by the galaxies steep gravitational potentials ( e.g.  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* kennicutt 1989 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* okuda et al.2005 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* kawata et al .  2007 ) ) .",
    "clearly our data have shown that the molecular gas is often associated with current star formation , but perhaps this is not always the case . in ngc  2768 the central molecular disk ( only @xmath31 pc )",
    "is located in a prominent drop in the stellar velocity dispersion , just as one would expect if a dynamically cold stellar disk had formed ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* crocker et al .",
    "curiously , however , there is no corresponding h@xmath8 absorption feature which would suggest current or recent star formation .",
    "early - type galaxies may thus present a valuable testing ground for galaxy - scale theoretical models of star formation .",
    "another open question has to do with the role of gas in the formation of early - type galaxies in general , and more specifically in the origin of the kinematically distinct substructures that are so common in early - type galaxies ( e.g.  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* mcdermid et al .  2006 ) ) .",
    "the sauron galaxies contain a large variety of cold stellar disks ( some of them metal - enriched ) and misaligned or counterrotating cores , in many sizes , and surely these are important clues to the galaxy formation processes .",
    "it would be useful to know what fraction of the substructures ( or which kinds ) are formed through dissipationless processes and which required gas .",
    "the answer to this question will likely require studies of more complete samples , such as atlas@xmath32 .",
    "nevertheless , very preliminary indications are that the molecular gas probably originated in a combination of internal stellar mass loss and cold accretion from external sources .",
    "again , the available numbers are still small , and a more quantitative assessment requires a substantial increase in the number of galaxies with both cold gas and stellar kinematic maps .",
