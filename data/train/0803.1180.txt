    "extensions of the standard model , such as supersymmetric , grand - unified , or extradimensional models , also rely on these ideas and give rise to a plethora of new particles that may be discovered soon at the lhc",

    "recently , georgi  @xcite proposed a novel scenario where no new particle states emerge but where scale invariant fields with non - trivial infrared ( ir ) fixed point can be part of physics above the tev scale . if these fields couple to sm operators they can give rise to effective interactions at lower energies that may have impact on particle phenomenology .",
    "he denominated this scale invariant matter coupled to sm fields at lower energies _ unparticle _ , as it is not constrained by a dispersion relation like normal particles .    since then there has been a number of papers in the literature devoted to map the unusual observable consequences of unparticles to experiments .",

    "another striking spin - off of the unparticle idea is the advent of long - range forces operating at macroscopic distances and generally governed by a non - integral power law .",
    "this unique behavior was first pointed out in ref.@xcite , in connection to microscopic spin - dependent interactions between electrons and has also been investigated in connection to deviations of the newtonian gravitational inverse squared law mediated by a tensor - like _ ungravity _ interaction  @xcite .",

    "neutrino oscillations have been shown to be a very powerful tool in constraining new dynamics .",
    "being an interference phenomenon it can be sensitive to very feeble interactions as their effect enters linearly in the neutrino propagation .",
    "furthermore the effect of new fermionic interactions can be enhanced when neutrino travels regions densely populated by those fermions . in this way",
    "it has been shown that neutrino oscillation data can place stringent bounds on long - range forces coupled to lepton flavour numbers  @xcite .",

    "<S> we have investigated the impact of long - range forces induced by unparticle operators of scalar , vector and tensor nature coupled to fermions in the interpretation of solar neutrinos and kamland data . if the unparticle couplings to the neutrinos are mildly non - universal , such long - range forces will not factorize out in the neutrino flavour evolution . as a consequence large deviations from the observed standard matter - induced oscillation pattern for solar neutrinos would be generated . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , severe limits can be set on the infrared fix point scale , @xmath0 , and the new physics scale , @xmath1 , as a function of the ultraviolet ( @xmath2 ) and anomalous ( @xmath3 ) dimension of the unparticle operator . for a scalar unparticle , for instance , assuming the non - universality of the lepton couplings to unparticles to be of the order of a few per mil we find that , for @xmath4 and @xmath5 , @xmath1 is constrained to be @xmath6 tev ( @xmath7 tev ) if @xmath8 1 tev ( 10 tev ) . for given values of @xmath0 and @xmath3 , </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding bounds on @xmath1 for vector ( tensor ) unparticles are @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) times those for the scalar case . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , these results can be translated into severe constraints on universality violation of the fermion couplings to unparticle operators with scales which can be accessible at future colliders . </S>"
