    "the topological preliminaries on surgery and lutz twists are explained in  [",
    "subsec : dehnlutz ] . in ",
    "[ subsec : local ] , we tackle the easiest step in the foliation construction , finding families of holomorphic curves to fill the solid tori that are glued in by surgery .",

    "the technical background of  [ sec : mbvp ] and  [ sec : compactness ] is then applied in  [ subsec : surgery ] to change a given open book decomposition of @xmath200 ( which can also be constructed explicitly ) into a stable morse - bott foliation in the complement of a transverse link neighborhood .",
    "the key is to remove a collection of disks from each page of the open book , obtaining holomorphic curves with boundary , which satisfy a problem of the type considered in  [ sec : mbvp ] , with images avoiding the region inside a set of small tori .",
    "thus we are now free to perform surgery and lutz twists inside these tori without killing the holomorphic curves outside ; the region inside can afterwards be filled in by the explicitly constructed curves from  [ subsec : local ] .    in principle , the curves with boundary filling the region outside the tori can be homotoped as the contact form is twisted , so that in the limit , all boundary components degenerate to punctures , giving rise to finite energy surfaces without boundary .",
    "the actual argument is not quite so simple , because the curves obtained by cutting out disks generally satisfy a boundary condition that is _ totally real _ but not _ lagrangian _ , thus lacking _ a priori _ energy bounds .",
    "this problem does not appear to be solvable for all curves at once , but we can deal with a single curve in the case where each component of @xmath201 is only singly linked with the binding orbit : this makes it possible to construct the totally real surface in @xmath33 so that it is equivalent via a diffeomorphism to a lagrangian surface in the symplectization of @xmath2 with a _ stable hamiltonian structure _",
    ", i.e.  the generalization of a contact form described in @xcite .",
    "we can then homotop this back to contact data but keep the lagrangian boundary condition , and use the implicit function theorem to extend the single curve again to a whole foliation .",
    "the only catch is that this trick requires the restrictive assumption that components of @xmath201 link only once with the binding orbit .",
    "we fix this in  [ subsec : braids ] by viewing the general case as a branched cover : the foliation can then be lifted to the cover using intersection theory .",
    "the result proved here is one step in a program proposed by hofer to study reeb dynamics on arbitrary closed contact @xmath0manifolds via finite energy foliations ; this is joint work in progress by the author with hofer , r.  siefring and j.  fish .",
    "as was shown in @xcite , the existence of finite energy foliations on @xmath202 implies that generic reeb vector fields in that setting admit either two or infinitely many periodic orbits .",
    "the present work does not imply such a result for overtwisted contact manifolds , because we fix a very specific contact form .",
    "the next step would therefore be a homotopy argument in which one shows that a foliation of @xmath17 gives rise to a foliation ( or something similar ) of @xmath203 for generic positive smooth functions @xmath204 and complex multiplications @xmath205 .",
    "one can then try to extend this to tight contact manifolds by the following trick : any @xmath15 can be made overtwisted by taking a connected sum of @xmath15 with @xmath206 for some @xmath207 overtwisted .",
    "one would then like to understand what happens to a sequence of foliations on the overtwisted object as one pinches off the overtwisted part .",
    "it is known that this program _ can not _ in general lead to a stable finite energy foliation for generic @xmath17 , as there are examples of tight contact manifolds where stable foliations do nt exist ( cf .  @xcite ) .",
    "nonetheless , the limits obtained in such spaces from sequences of foliations should be interesting objects , with possible dynamical implications .",
    "a related program is of a more topological nature : the author proposed in @xcite*chapter  6 an equivalence relation for stable finite energy foliations , called _ concordance _ , which is defined by the existence of stable holomorphic foliations on cylindrical symplectic cobordisms .",
    "the goal would then be to classify all foliations for a given @xmath15 up to concordance .",
    "conjecturally , two concordance classes can be distinguished by an invariant @xmath208 , which is a version of _ contact homology _ ( or more generally , symplectic field theory @xcite ) that counts the orbits and rigid surfaces in the foliation . in this framework , the constructions of the present paper show that every overtwisted @xmath15 admits a foliation @xmath80 for which @xmath208 is trivial . as suggested however by an example in @xcite , this is not true for _ all _ foliations on overtwisted contact manifolds .    we should mention the related work of c.  abbas @xcite , which uses the open book decompositions of giroux @xcite to produce ( in the planar case ) open book decompositions with pseudoholomorphic pages . due to etnyre s result that all overtwisted contact structures are planar @xcite , this also produces a finite energy foliation for all overtwisted contact manifolds .",
    "the two constructions are however quite different , e.g.  ours is not an open book decomposition , and the foliations of abbas appear to have nontrivial contact homology in the sense described above , suggesting that they are not equivalent to ours via concordance .      much of the material covered here appeared originally  in more detailed and sometimes more complicated forms  in my ph.d .",
