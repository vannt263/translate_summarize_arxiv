    ", rich phases due to the competition between dipolar forces and short - range forces opposing density variations were found experimentally@xcite and theoretically@xcite .",
    "pattern formation was extensively studied in colloidal systems where the colloid - colloid interaction is characterized by the competition of the hardcore excluded volume interaction , on the one hand , and the polarization of the particles , on the other hand .",
    "the interaction potential can be further controlled by adding other components . as a result ,",
    "rich configurations , such as clusters , repulsive or attractive glassy states , gels , were found numerically @xcite , analytically @xcite and experimentally @xcite in colloidal systems with short range attractive interaction .",
    "the properties of isolated clusters formed by the short - range attractive and long - range repulsive interaction were studied@xcite . by controlling the interaction ,",

    "in particular , several properties ( e.g. , vortex lattice with voids , the nearest - neighbor distribution ) of the observed vortex patterns were explained using a simple model that involved a non - monotonic inter - vortex interaction based on a more general approach to multi - order - parameter condensates  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a model competing interaction potential which is repulsive for short range and attractive for long range .",
    "this form of the interaction potential could be used as a model for different systems with non - monotonic inter - particle interation , e.g. , atoms or molecules ( i.e. , the lennard - jones potential ) , or vortices in two - band superconductors , depending on specific parameters of the potential .",

    "we propose a new approach to characterize the different phases : instead of qualitative characterization of the phases ( e.g. , clusters or labyrinths ) , we introduce a number of quantitative criteria to distinguish these . in particular , different phases are analyzed in terms of the radial distribution function ( rdf ) and additional quantities chracterizing , e.g. , the local density of particles in clusters .    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "[ fig - order_i](a ) , we plot the function @xmath123 for different @xmath39 and @xmath63 for the soft - core interaction with @xmath58 . we see that the function @xmath123 can be used to charaterize the different phases .",
    "thus we found that , for clusters , @xmath123 is always large ( @xmath130 ) since aggregation is strong . for stripes , aggregation is smaller , and thus @xmath123 is smaller ( @xmath131 ) . for labyrinths ,",
    "the regions free of particles are relatively small .",
    "therefore , @xmath123 ranges between @xmath132 to @xmath133 . finally , for the lattice phase , @xmath123 is always @xmath132 .",
    "therefore , the function @xmath123 serves as a measure of the aggregation of particles and allows us to effectively distinguish the different phases .",
    "the function @xmath123 also provides a tool to analyze the stability of patterns with increasing density .",

    "however , the situation changes for @xmath96 : while clusters are formed for low densities up to @xmath134 , for larger density @xmath123 decreases below the value @xmath135 which means that clusters elongate and interconnect giving rise to the onset of the stripe phase . for @xmath97 ,",
    "the particles start to form stripes at even lower density ( n=3500 ) . for higher density ,",
    "the additional particles fill in the empty regions and finally they form the lattice phase . for @xmath136 ,",
    "the island - like clusters formed at low densities are very unstable with respect to an increase in density .",
    "the additional particles rapidly occupy the empty regions , and the patterns change form clusters to stripes and from stipes to lattice with increasing density .    therefore , the phenomenological description of pattern evolution with increasing density we revealed above in sec .",

    "( [ eq - rdf_integral ] ) ) allowed us to unambiguously characterize the different patterns and phases . at the same time",
    ", it is still hard to distinguish , using the above tools , between the labyrinth phase ( or a lattice with voids ) and the lattice phase ( especially in the soft - core regime when the corresponding rdf does not differ much from each other , and both phases are characterised by small values of @xmath123 .",
    "however , these phases can be easily distinguished by employing another simple criterion , namely , the occupation factor which characterizes the fraction of the space occupied by particles to the total space .",
    "let us assume that all the patterns are formed by islands of triangular lattice with the average distance between two nearest neighbor particles @xmath138 , where @xmath139 is the position of the first peak of the rdf .",
    "then the ratio of the area occupied by the particles and the whole simulation area is @xmath140 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - order_ii](a ) , this ratio can be used to distinguish the labyrinth phase and the lattice phase , since for the lattice phase @xmath141 .",
    "we also found that circular clusters in the case of soft - core interaction are very stable with respect to an increase in the density . in this case , the additional particles can not efficiently increase the occupation factor due to the increase in the local density of the core .",
    "however , for the stripe and labyrinth phases , the occupation factor @xmath137 increases with the density ( see fig .  [ fig - order_ii](a ) ) .",
    "these phases are not stable for high density .",
    "thus the large jump in @xmath142 at @xmath78 in curve c in fig .",
    "[ fig - order_ii](a ) shows the phase transition from the stripe phase to the lattice phase .",
    "as one can expect , in the case of hard - core interaction , the occupation factor increases nearly linearly versus the density ( see fig .  [ fig - order_ii](b ) ) .",
    "therefore , the polygon shape and island - like clusters are not stable : with increasing density they evolve to the lattice phase ( the plateau in @xmath142 in fig .",
    "[ fig - order_ii](b ) ) .",
    "in addition , let us introduce another useful quantity which characterizes the degree of `` perfection '' of a lattice .",
    "let us define the particles with the inter - particle distance shorter than @xmath7 as neighboring particles .",
    "then @xmath143 is an average displacement of the inter - distance between two neighbor particles ( measured in units of @xmath22 ) , which is independent of the density .",
    "the function @xmath144 is non - zero for a deformed triangular lattice and @xmath145 for the ideal triangular lattice .",
    "thus , @xmath144 quantitatively measures the degree of perfection of a lattice .",
    "note that @xmath144 is only used for lattices as an auxiliary tool to distinguish ordered lattices from less ordered ones ( see table i ) .",
    "using molecular - dynamics simulations , we analyzed the pattern formation and identified different phases in a system of particles interacting via a non - monotonic potential , with a repulsive short - range part and attractive long - range part .",
    "the form of the interacting potential is generic : it describes , depending on specific parameters , the interparticle interaction in a variety of physical systems ranging from , e.g. , atoms and molecules ( lennard - jones potential ) to colloids and neutron stars .",
    "it can also be used as a model of inter - vortex interaction in low @xmath2 type - ii superconductors and in recently discovered so - called `` type-1.5 '' superconductors .",
    "the obtained different phases were summarized in a phase diagram in the plane `` critical radius @xmath3 @xmath4 density @xmath5 '' ( @xmath3 is the critical radius where the interaction force changes its sign ) .",
    "we also analyzed the influence of the hardness of the `` core '' , i.e. , the strength of the repulsive core part of the interaction potential on the pattern formation .",
    "we developed a set of criteria in order to unambiguously identify the obtained phases using the following approaches : ( i ) the radial distribution function ( rdf ) @xmath104 , ( ii ) the local density function @xmath123 , and ( iii ) the occupation factor @xmath137 .",
