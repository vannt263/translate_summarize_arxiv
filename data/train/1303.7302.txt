    "<S> the principle axes of the modulation are along the direction of the nearest fe - fe bond , which is just what we should expect from our model construction . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature dependence of the susceptibility in the principle axes are shown in fig.[fig3]b . </S>",
    "<S> these predictions are in good agreement with the result of the recent torque magnetometry measurement@xcite . </S>",

    "<S> according to experiments , both the in - plane and the out - of - plane magnetic susceptibility exhibit linear temperature dependence with almost the same slope . </S>",
    "<S> however , the intercept of the in - plane magnetic susceptibility is always much larger than that of the out - of - plane magnetic susceptibility@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior can be easily understood if we decompose the measured magnetic susceptibility into an isotropic component that is linearly temperature dependent and a temperature independent component that is anisotropic , or , @xmath115 it is then quite natural to associate the anisotropic component @xmath116 with the orbital magnetic response , which is essentially temperature independent . </S>",
    "<S> the isotropic component @xmath117 should then be attributed to the spin magnetic response , whose linear temperature dependence is still an unresolved issue in the field.@xcite        in our calculation , we have used a five - band model derived from the band structure of the lafeaso system . </S>",
    "<S> however , the best known susceptibility data on single crystalline sample are all taken from the 122 system . </S>",
    "<S> it is thus better to perform the calculation with a material - specific band structure for the 122 systems . while this is an interesting possibility and </S>",
    "<S> should be pursued in the future , we note that the basic structure of the bands in both the 1111 and the 122 systems are quite similar . since the orbital magnetic response is contributed by the whole band rather than the electronic state near the fermi level only , we expect the 1111 and 122 system to exhibit similar orbital magnetic response . </S>",
    "<S> another way to improve our calculation is to use the matrix element of @xmath56 calculated from first principle code , rather than approximating them with those in the basis spanned by the atomic orbital . </S>",
    "<S> however , since the form the matrix element is largely determined by symmetry , we do not expect such more advanced calculation to change the conclusion of this paper in a qualitative way . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , we find that our results are not sensitive to the small variation of the parameters @xmath118 .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have shown that the orbital angular momentum of the conduction electrons in the iron - based superconductors contributes significantly to the magnetic response of the system . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the theory predicts that the orbital magnetic susceptibility accounts for more than @xmath2 of the observed magnetic susceptibility at 200 k in 122 systems . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the orbital magnetic response is sensitive to symmetry breaking in the orbital space , which makes it a useful probe of the orbital ordering in these multi - orbital systems . </S>",
