    "a symmetry can be seen as an equivalence of different physical situations  @xcite .",
    "such an equivalence in quantum theory entails the invariance of a certain set of observables and can be formalised in terms of commutation relations between these operators and a given hamiltonian .",
    "the existence of good quantum numbers , also those having no classical counterpart , is a direct consequence of symmetries .",
    "it extends the amount of information accessible for researchers studying quantum systems .",
    "it is possible to explain an unusual system s behaviour , its properties and dynamics by means of symmetries .",
    "selection rules or kramers degeneracy  @xcite may serve as a good example here .",
    "symmetries not only deepen our understanding of quantum systems but also can be included to engineer their physical realisation more effectively  @xcite . in general , the more symmetries recognised ( together with related conserved quantities ) the more different approaches to study the system s dynamics are at our disposal .    only in extreme cases ,",
    "one can meet analytically solvable models ( such as harmonic oscillator , jaynes ",
    "cummings model or hydrogen atom ) where symmetries can be found easily . in this paper",
    ", we consider a quantum model consisting of a two  level system ( qubit ) interacting with a single mode bosonic field ( electromagnetic radiation ) with frequency @xmath1 .",
    "the hamiltonian of that system is assumed to be of the following form @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the creation and annihilation operators of the bosonic field .",
    "mathematically , this means that @xmath5=\\mathbb{i}$ ] . for an experimental characterisation of these operators",
    "see  @xcite . @xmath6 and @xmath7 denote the two pauli spin matrices . the term @xmath8 stands for the unperturbed energy of the qubit with possible eigenenergies @xmath9 .",
    "tunnelling between the corresponding energy levels in the absence of the bosonic field ( spontaneous transition ) is described by @xmath10 . finally , the coupling constant @xmath11 reflects the strength of the interaction between the systems .",
    "the above hamiltonian is the well  known rabi model  @xcite  probably the most influential model describing fully quantized interaction between matter and light .",
    "although the model originates from quantum optics  @xcite , its applications range from molecular physics  @xcite , solid state ( see refs . in  @xcite ) to the recent experiments involving cavity and circuit qed  @xcite .",
    "the rabi model can be implemented by means of rich variety of different setups such as josephson junctions  @xcite , trapped ions  @xcite , superconductors  @xcite or semiconductors  @xcite , to name a few .    despite its simplicity",
    ", the hamiltonian of the rabi model can not be diagonalized exactly when @xmath12 .",
    "although some progress has been reported recently  @xcite , exact analytical formulas for the eigenvalues and corresponding eigenfunction of the hamiltonian  ( [ rabi ] ) are still missing .",
    "there is a wide spectrum of available approximation techniques including rotating wave approximation  @xcite ( leading to the famous jaynes  cummings model  @xcite ) which allow the eigenproblem to be approached from many different directions . at this point ,",
    "a question concerning the existence of symmetries in the rabi model ( together with related constants of motion ) arises naturally .",
    "provided that @xmath13 , the hamiltonian  ( [ rabi ] ) remains unchanged when @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( hence @xmath16 ) . the symmetry operator @xmath17 that generates this transformation ( _ e.g. _ fulfills @xmath18=0 $ ] ) reads @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the bosonic parity  @xcite .",
    "this is the well  known result : still being unsolvable , the rabi model possesses a discrete symmetry if @xmath13 .    when @xmath21 , on the other hand , we can still leave @xmath22 unaffected after changing @xmath14 , @xmath15 if we change the sign of @xmath23 as well ( _ i.e. _ @xmath24 ) .",
    "this instantly raises a question : what does the corresponding generator of such transformation , @xmath25 , look like ?",
    "unfortunately , this question has not been answered so far .",
    "moreover , it was quite recently conjectured  @xcite that the rabi model does not possess any symmetry at all ( except the trivial one related to the total energy conservation ) as long as @xmath21 .",
    "if that were true , the only self  adjoint operator @xmath25 such that @xmath26}=0 $ ] would be the hamiltonian @xmath22 itself .    on the basis of the results reported here , we prove that this conjecture is false .",
    "in particular , we show how one can find a self  adjoint involution @xmath25 , that is @xmath27 , such that @xmath28 . also , we discuss the possibility of the exact diagonalization of the rabi hamiltonian  ( [ rabi ] ) . it is worth mentioning that symmetry groups of the time evolution generator ( the hamiltonian @xmath22 in our case ) are larger than those of the corresponding equation of motion ( schrdinger equation : @xmath29 ) .",
    "in particular , we could consider the existence of a symmetry @xmath30 which does not necessarily commute with @xmath22 but still assures the same time evolution for two different states : @xmath31 , @xmath32 .",
    "of course , this is possible if @xmath33 $ ] .",
    "the idea of such dynamical symmetries is interesting by itself , yet it is beyond the scope of our current considerations and wo nt be pursued any further in this work .",
    "let us begin with formal rewriting of the rabi hamiltonian  ( [ rabi ] ) as a matrix with operator entries : @xmath34 customarily , the parameters @xmath35 and @xmath23 denote @xmath36 and @xmath37 respectively .",
    "@xmath38 stands for the identity on the bosonic hilbert space @xmath39 .",
    "the matrix representation of the rabi model given in  ( [ bom ] ) is established via a natural isomorphism @xmath40 .",
    "usually , such an identification is invoked in order to simplify purely algebraic calculations ( see _ e.g. _",
    "this is not the reason why we use this idea here .",
    "instead , we are going to attack the problem in question by using a concept of block operator matrix  @xcite in conjunction with its relation to an operator riccati equation  @xcite .",
    "first however , we would like to clarify some technical aspects concerning the rabi matrix  ( [ bom ] ) ( _ e.g. _ its domain @xmath41 ) .",
    "one should mention that this is not a primary issue in many papers addressing physical aspects of the rabi model .",
    "needless to say , one can not take the advantage of very powerful existential mathematical theorems ( _ e.g. _ the famous banach fixed point theorem  @xcite ) in such cases simply because it is not known whether the premises of these statements are met .    in a first step toward constructing @xmath25 , we define domains @xmath42 on which both operators @xmath43 are self  adjoint . since the off  diagonal elements of @xmath22 are bounded , we have @xmath44 on @xmath45",
    ". as both @xmath3 and @xmath4 are unbounded , the canonical commutation relation holds only on some ( dense ) subspace @xmath46 of @xmath47 .",
    "let us assume that @xmath48 is a dense set on which @xmath3 and @xmath4 are adjoint to each other _ i.e. _ , @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "at this point , it is not obvious that the subspaces having the desired properties exist at all .",
    "an interested reader can find the detailed construction of @xmath51 _",
    "e.g. _ in  @xcite . here , we briefly summarise what was covered therein .",
    "we have    @xmath52    where @xmath53 is the canonical ( orthonormal ) basis in @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "considering the fact that @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath56 ought to produce normalizable states , the above definitions seem natural . having  ( [ dom ] ) in place , we define @xmath57 it follows immediately from  ( [ aa ] ) that @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "interestingly , the latter relations serve as the very definition of the creation and annihilation operators in most textbooks on quantum mechanics .",
    "a definition like this may be well motivated physically , yet it has at least one serious mathematical drawback .",
    "namely , it introduces closeable operators which are not closed .",
    "this leads to a variety of technical difficulties typical for such classes of operators .",
    "one can avoid them by taking the closures  ( [ aa ] ) as proper definitions , instead .",
    "a basic result from operator theory ( see _ e.g. _ , theorem 4.2.7 in  @xcite ) states that if @xmath60 is closed on @xmath61 then @xmath62 is positive , self - adjoint and its domain is a core of @xmath60 ( _ i.e. _ @xmath60 is the closure of its restriction @xmath63 ) .",
    "on @xmath64 , the operators @xmath43 can be written as @xmath65 and as a result , they are both self  adjoint and their common domain @xmath64 is a core of both @xmath3 and @xmath4 . in conclusion , the rabi hamiltonian  ( [ bom ] ) is well defined and self ",
    "adjoint on @xmath66 .",
    "after discussing technical nuances concerning the rabi model , we introduce a quadratic second order operator equation , known as the riccati equation , which has the following form @xmath67 many of the relevant problems related to the rabi model  ( [ rabi ] ) , including its exact diagonalization , can be reduced to the mathematical questions concerning solvability of this equation .",
    "there is more than one notion of a solution when equations with operator coefficients are involved . in hilbert spaces , one can define a solution in terms of the scalar product ( weak solution ) . on the other hand",
    ", one may require for operators to be equal when they produce the same results while acting on the same states .",
    "these kind of solutions , which are of great importance in quantum mechanics , are known as strong ones .",
    "let us briefly clarify these two notions for the riccati equation in question .",
    "a bounded operator @xmath68 acting on a hilbert space @xmath69 is called a weak solution of the riccati equation  ( [ ricc ] ) if @xmath70 a bounded operator @xmath68 acting on @xmath69 such that @xmath71 and @xmath72 is a strong solution of  ( [ ricc ] ) .    of course , a strong solution is also a weak solution .",
    "it is often easier to prove the existence of a weak rather than a strong solution . however ,",
    "strong solutions , especially in quantum mechanics , are those which we are interested in",
    ". fortunately , the two notions are in fact equivalent  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , there is no general method of finding either weak or strong solutions to a particular riccati equation .",
    "for this reason , the following theorem , which provides criteria of solvability , is of great importance to us .",
    "[ mt ] let @xmath43 be ( possibly unbounded ) self  adjoint operators acting on domains @xmath73 in a separable hilbert space @xmath69 .",
    "let us also assume that @xmath74 and @xmath75 are bounded operators on @xmath69 .",
    "if the spectra @xmath76 are disjoint , i.e. , @xmath77 and if @xmath78 , @xmath75 satisfy the ` smallness assumption ' @xmath79 then the riccati equation @xmath80 has a unique weak solution @xmath68 in the ball @xmath81 satisfying an estimate @xmath82 in particular , if @xmath83 then @xmath68 is a strict contraction , that is , @xmath84 .    an elegant and compact proof of this statement , based on the banach fixed point theorem , can be found in  @xcite .",
    "now , let us prove our main result .",
    "first , we show that the existence of a solution of the riccati equation  ( [ ricc ] ) implies the existence of an operator generating a symmetry in the system  ( [ bom ] ) .",
    "second , we argue that under certain conditions imposed on the parameters @xmath35 , @xmath23 , @xmath1 this equation is weakly solvable .",
    "[ symm ] let us assume that there exists a weak ( and hence strong ) solution @xmath68 of the riccati equation  ( [ ricc ] )",
    ". then there also exists a self  adjoint involution @xmath25 such that @xmath85 where @xmath22 is given by  ( [ bom ] ) .",
    "moreover , the generator @xmath25 in terms of @xmath68 reads @xmath86    let @xmath87 be the graph of @xmath68 , that is @xmath88 @xmath68 is a strong solution of  ( [ ricc ] ) thus @xmath89 ( by definition ) and @xmath90 for @xmath91 .",
    "therefore , @xmath92 that is @xmath93 . making use of the same arguments",
    ", one can verify that @xmath94 , which is given by @xmath95 is @xmath96invariant as well .",
    "@xmath68 is bounded and thus its graph forms a closed subspace of @xmath97 and hence the decomposition @xmath98 holds true .",
    "therefore , each state @xmath99 of the composite system can be uniquely decomposed @xmath100 where @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "let @xmath103 be a projection onto @xmath87 .",
    "then it follows that @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "assuming for a moment that @xmath106 , we obtain @xmath107 therefore , @xmath108 for all @xmath109 .    the inverse @xmath110 exists and it is a bounded self  adjoint operator on @xmath39 .",
    "thus , @xmath111 can be expressed as @xmath112 it is a matter of straightforward calculations to see that  ( [ pp ] ) indeed projects onto @xmath87 .    due to the fact that @xmath113 , the only question which we need to address to conclude the proof is whether @xmath114 is again in @xmath41 for @xmath99 . because @xmath68 is a weak ( and hence strong ) solution of  ( [ ricc ] ) , we have @xmath115 .",
    "moreover , the function @xmath116 is continuous on @xmath64 for every @xmath117 .",
    "indeed , it follows from  ( [ weak ] ) that @xmath118 as a result , @xmath119 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath120 and therefore @xmath121 .",
    "@xmath122 is invertible , hence @xmath123 . in summary , @xmath124 which concludes the proof .",
    "let us assume that @xmath23 , @xmath1 , @xmath12 satisfy the following conditions @xmath125 then there exists a unique weak ( hence strong ) solution of the riccati equation  ( [ ricc ] ) such that @xmath84 . as a result , there is a @xmath0 symmetry with respect to which the rabi model is invariant .",
    "the generator of this symmetry is given by  ( [ symm ] ) .",
    "@xmath126 is self ",
    "adjoint for @xmath127 thus the unitary weyl operator @xmath128 is well defined .",
    "moreover , @xmath129 and therefore @xmath130 by virtue of @xmath131 ( keep in mind that @xmath132 ) , we have @xmath133 if @xmath134 is not multiple of @xmath1 then the distance @xmath135 therefore , the spectra @xmath76 are disjoint _",
    "i.e. _ , the condition  ( [ d ] ) holds true .",
    "in addition , both the smallness assumption  ( [ small ] ) and  ( [ cont ] ) imposed on the off  diagonal elements are satisfied as long as @xmath136 . according to lemma  [ mt ] , there is exactly one solution of the riccati equation  ( [ ricc ] ) and it is a strict contraction ( @xmath137 ) .",
    "the second statement of the theorem follows immediately from theorem  [ symm ] .",
    "we begin with the @xmath13 case in which the spectra  ( [ spec ] ) overlap and hence the separability condition  ( [ d ] ) is not satisfied .",
    "therefore , one can not invoke lemma  [ mt ] to establish the existence of a solution to the riccati equation  ( [ ricc ] ) .",
    "however , the spectra @xmath76 in that particular case are identical and @xmath43 can be transformed one into another by the same bosonic parity operator that generates the symmetry @xmath17 . this is not an accidental coincidence as @xmath138 is a solution of the riccati equation  ( [ ricc ] ) .",
    "indeed , @xmath139 from which it follows immediately that @xmath138 is bounded and @xmath140 .",
    "note , if @xmath141 are square ",
    "summable , @xmath142 , so are @xmath143 . in the light of  ( [ aa ] ) , we obtain @xmath144 as well as @xmath145 and finally @xmath146 . and",
    "because @xmath138 is a self  adjoint involution , it solves the riccati equation  ( [ ricc ] ) as stated .    at this point",
    ", we would like to make some remarks .",
    "first and foremost , @xmath138 is not a unique solution of the riccati equation  ( [ ricc ] ) .",
    "for instance , @xmath147 also satisfies this equation .",
    "second , the symmetry generator @xmath148 from theorem  [ symm ] reads @xmath149 when @xmath150 as one may expect .",
    "if the conditions  ( [ ass ] ) are met , in particular for @xmath21 , the spectra @xmath43 are separated and the riccati equation  ( [ ricc ] ) possesses exactly one solution @xmath68 . according to theorem  [ symm ] , this solution corresponds to a symmetry generator @xmath25 .",
    "the only problem is that @xmath68 is unknown .",
    "one can attempt to simplify the problem by putting @xmath151 , where @xmath152 + 2\\beta{\\text{y}}_{\\beta}-\\alpha{\\text{p}}=0,\\ ] ] and @xmath153 is redefined so that it reads  ( [ compact ] ) for @xmath13 .",
    "this equation becomes trivial and its solution reads @xmath154 when @xmath13 . on the other hand , as long as @xmath155 , under  ( [ ass ] ) , the premises of lemma  [ mt ] are satisfied . hence , a unique @xmath156 exists and @xmath157 .",
    "moreover , if the inverse @xmath158 exists as well then @xmath159 + 2(-\\beta){\\text{y}}_{\\beta}^{-1}-\\alpha{\\text{p}}=0,\\ ] ] and therefore @xmath160 .",
    "although we can not solve  ( [ nricc ] ) either , the latter equality indicates the class which @xmath156 belongs to .",
    "one can also verify that the operator @xmath156 is not self  adjoint provided it is a function of @xmath153 and it can not be anti  self",
    " adjoint ( @xmath161 )    indeed , if @xmath153 such that @xmath162 exists ,  ( [ nricc ] ) would imply the following separation into a self  adjoint and anti  self  adjoin part @xmath163=0.\\ ] ] both these equations can be solved separately , but the solutions do not agree with each other unless @xmath13 .",
    "similar arguments show that the condition @xmath161 is necessary for @xmath164 .",
    "this contradicts  ( [ nricc ] ) even when @xmath13 .",
    "solutions of the riccati equation  ( [ ricc ] ) can also be used to obtain the eigenfunctions and corresponding eigenvalues of the rabi hamiltonian .",
    "let us briefly discuss the idea .    both @xmath87 and @xmath94 are @xmath22invariant .",
    "thus , if @xmath165 is an energy eigenstate then either @xmath166 or @xmath167 .",
    "actually , we can say more than that .",
    "let @xmath168 and @xmath169 be defined on @xmath64 .",
    "together with  ( [ include ] ) , this gives @xmath170 provided @xmath171 is in @xmath87 .",
    "also , one can verify that all eigenstates from @xmath94 are of the form : @xmath172 it can be proven that @xmath173 are self ",
    "adjoint on hilbert spaces @xmath174 and @xmath175 , respectively  @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xmath176 and the following similarity relation holds @xmath177 the above block diagonal form of @xmath22 extends the notion of the parity chains introduced in  @xcite .",
    "we have recognised a symmetry of the rabi hamiltonian and constructed its generator @xmath148 .",
    "although this symmetry is nonlocal ( unlike _ e.g. _ @xmath178 ) , it is a self  adjoint involution . therefore , it can be considered as a generalised parity of the rabi model . invoking physical nomenclature ,",
    "the rabi model is invariant with respect to this parity or it has an _ unbroken _ @xmath0 symmetry . in literature",
    ", the latter terminology is often used in a different ( local ) context where it is stated that the @xmath21 case corresponds to a broken @xmath0 symmetry ( because @xmath179\\not=0 $ ] ) .",
    "our aim was to generalise the local parity combined by the parity operators of the individual subsystems : @xmath7 and @xmath180 to the nonlocal one for @xmath21 .",
    "our results are not of purely existential character . by means of a solution to an operator",
    "riccati type equation , we have derived an explicit formula for the generator @xmath25 and formulated conditions ( range of parameters  ( [ ass ] ) ) guaranteeing its existence .",
    "the question whether the generator @xmath25 can exist under conditions other than  ( [ ass ] ) remains open .",
    "this problem is a subject of our current intensive investigation .    at this point",
    "one should mention that usually the existence of a discrete symmetry in a quantum system is not enough by itself to fully understand its dynamics .",
    "also , there is no obvious and direct guideline suggesting usefulness of symmetries given by discrete operators , especially nonlocal ones , in construction of solutions to the equations of motion of composite systems .",
    "however , discrete symmetries , local or not , allow the decomposition of the system hilbert space into two subspaces with states having certain properties .",
    "one can then seek for the solution to the equation of motion in the individual subspaces ( and then try to combine the results to obtain a full solution ) .",
    "for the rabi model , in the case of local parity , this idea can be realised in terms of so called parity chains  @xcite .",
    "the generalisation to the nonlocal case can by accomplished by means of block diagonalization according to  ( [ pch ] ) .",
    "the latter formula may also serve as a good starting point for developing new analytical approximations or numerical treatment of the eigenproblem  @xcite .    moreover",
    ", nonlocal discrete symmetries can help in classification and grouping of known solutions  @xcite .",
    "they can also be used in constructing new solutions from the ones which are already known such as juddian solutions  @xcite or so called quasi  exact solutions  @xcite .",
    "symmetries of the type presented here can also serve as a tool helping to verify certain conjectures concerning solutions of the rabi model such as the celebrated reik conjecture  @xcite .",
    "we would like to emphasise that there is always a physical context ( beyond mathematics ) of studying symmetries ( both local and nonlocal ) in physics .",
    "for instance , there is a connection between symmetries of a quantum system and good quantum numbers in that system  @xcite .",
    "any measurement confirming conservation of such numbers confirms , at least partially , correctness of the model ( _ i.e. _ , whether a given choice of the hamiltonian properly describes the system ) .",
    "as ` quantum phenomena do not occur in a hilbert space , they occur in a laboratory '  @xcite , the more symmetries to our disposal the more tests can be performed .",
    "this ultimately verifies our understanding of quantum systems and their behaviour .",
    "it seems that an inability to solve the riccati equation when @xmath21 is the core reason why the symmetry  ( [ j ] ) hasnt been recognised earlier .",
    "although the solution of this equation exists as we have proved , it may not be expressible by standard ( well  known ) operators . in that case",
    ", it is very unlikely to find the explicit form of @xmath148 also by means of different methods regardless of their nature . on the other hand ,",
    "the riccati equation can easily be solved in terms of the well - known bosonic parity when @xmath13 .",
    "as one may expect , the corresponding generator @xmath181 has been known all along .",
    "the solvability problem of the riccati equation can also be related to the question regarding diagonalization of the rabi model . in this paper",
    ", we have investigated the possibility of finding the eigenvalues and eigenvector of the rabi hamiltonian .",
    "we have not offered full resolution , yet compact and exact expressions have been derived that , to some extent , simplify the problem . although our analysis was mainly focused on the rabi model , the presented scheme of diagonalization can be extended to general qubit  environment models .",
