    "these properties were thought to be mutually exclusive , but in almost all real networks , having a small average distance does not greatly interfere with the presence of a large clustering coefficient , as shown in @xcite . despite the considerable amount of literature in the area of complex networks , there has been no study exploring the properties of a graph required in order for it to have both large average clustering and small average distance . in this article",
    ", we will find the architecture of the networks with the largest average clustering , and show that at the same time their average distance is smaller or equal to the average distance of any other graph .",

    "a complete graph is a graph in which each vertex is connected to every other ( with one edge between each pair of vertices ) .",
    "the edge density of the graph is defined as @xmath8 , representing the number of present edges , as a fraction of the number of edges of a complete graph .",
    "a clique in a graph is a subset of its vertices such that every two vertices in the subset are connected by an edge .",
    "a clique that consists of three vertices ( and three edges ) is called a triangle .",
    "the degree of a vertex is the number of edges that connect to it .",

    ", we need to make sure that we connect @xmath9 to those vertices of the clique with the largest degree ( which may have additional connections outside the clique ) .",
    "also , the size of the clique is an important factor",

    "[ merginglemma ]    the number of missing triangles stays the same regardless of the specific vertices of the clique that @xmath68 and @xmath69 are connected to .",

    "the reasoning behind the last equation is that if we pick any vertex from the graph , it should be `` optimally '' connected to a smaller graph that is itself optimal .",
    "this means that we need to make sure that the chosen vertex has the largest possible clustering coefficient with regard to the vertices it is connected to , the rest of the graph needs to have the largest clustering coefficient , and the potential decrease of the clustering coefficient of the vertices after connecting the last one should be minimal .",

    "the graph with @xmath5 vertices and @xmath6 edges will be found by connecting a new vertex of degree @xmath53 to an optimal graph of order @xmath38 and size @xmath82 .",
    "the resulting graph will have the maximum possible clustering of the new vertex ( equal to @xmath23 ) , the maximum clustering of the rest of the graph it is attached to , and the minimal possible decrease in clustering for the vertices it is connected to .",
    "if @xmath53 is larger than the order of the largest subgraph in @xmath176 , then it will be connected to at least two smaller complete or almost complete subgraphs .",
    "now consider the subgraph that consists of these subgraphs plus the added vertex of degree @xmath53 .",
    "it has @xmath177 vertices and @xmath178 edges .",
    "in addition , it has a cut vertex , which connects its two or more components .",
    "this is a subgraph whose form is _ not _ optimal , according to the induction hypothesis , meaning that there is a smaller degree @xmath53 for the vertex @xmath9 , for which equation ( [ recursiveformula ] ) gave a larger clustering coefficient for order @xmath95 and size @xmath179 .",
    "so we only need to consider vertices with degree @xmath53 less than the size of the largest `` module '' if @xmath176 is already connected .",
    "moreover , we only need to try to connect it to one clique .",
    "the rest of the cliques will not change , so we focus on the clique where the new vertex with the new edges is added , and prove that it will still have the same form .",
    "if it is a complete graph , then after adding the new vertex @xmath9 , it will have one peripheral vertex , which makes the claim hold ( the complete graph will now be a type ii almost complete graph ) .",
    "if it is a type i almost complete subgraph , after the addition of the new vertex , it will become a type ii almost complete subgraph , as shown above .",
    "if the subgraph is a type ii almost complete subgraph , then connecting @xmath9 to it can not yield an optimal subgraph , since by increasing the degree of @xmath9 to the size of this subgraph , we can make a graph with larger clustering , as shown in the lemma about the optimal form of type ii almost complete graphs . in any case",
    ", the new graph will have the form described in the claim .",
    "the arguments above just prove the form that the optimal graph needs to have , and not the exact arrangement of edges among its vertices .",
    "using equation ( [ recursiveformula ] ) , we can find the optimal graph in polynomial time , and as shown above , we only need to consider a small range of different degrees for the added vertex .",
    "according to the above analysis , the graph @xmath7 with the largest possible clustering coefficient has one of the following forms , depending on its size @xmath6 :    * @xmath172 : disconnected graph , consisting of complete components with @xmath47 or @xmath52 vertices each .",
    "* @xmath180 : complete or almost complete subgraphs that share one vertex . *",
    "@xmath181 : type ii almost complete graph . *",
    "@xmath182 : type i almost complete graph .",
    "* @xmath183 : complete graph , with average clustering @xmath184 .",
    "the form of the optimal graphs is recursive . every combination of clusters ( modules ) that are connected through a cut vertex themselves form an optimal graph of the respective order and size .",
    "this suggests an alternative way to generate an optimal graph , where it can be found as a combination of smaller complete or almost - complete subgraphs . we can find the optimal form recursively with this procedure , too .",
    "since there is always a cut vertex , we can break the network in two smaller parts , that do not affect each other s average clustering coefficient , and optimize them independently .",
    "when a new vertex is attached to a graph with the process described above , it is _ always _ attached to vertices that are members of the same clique . this property can make computation easier , since we only need to consider cliques of size equal or greater to the degree of the candidate additional vertex , according to equation ( [ recursiveformula ] ) .",
    "no graph with the largest average clustering has any chordless cycles .",
    "no graph with the largest average clustering has any induced bipartite subgraphs .",
    "every cut set is a complete graph of size @xmath23 or more .",
    "in addition , if there exists a cut vertex , it also belongs to all larger cut sets .",
    "6 .   for all connected optimal graphs ,",
    "there is at least one vertex that is connected to every other vertex in the graph .",
    "if the graph is not almost complete , then the central vertex is unique . otherwise , we may have more than one such vertex . 7",
    ".   the networks with the largest clustering coefficient also have the smallest possible average distance among the various vertices . for every pair of vertices that are not connected , there is a path of length @xmath47 that connects them .",
    "these networks are classified as `` small world '' , because they have both high average clustering and small average shortest paths , as mentioned previously .",
    "8 .   from a computational standpoint",
    ", in order to find the optimal graph @xmath7 , we first need to find the optimal graphs of order @xmath38 , for all sizes , which in turn means that we need to compute _ all _ such graphs of _ all orders up to _ @xmath38 .",
    "the complexity of this procedure is polynomial , @xmath185 , since we need to find the optimal graphs for all graphs of order up to @xmath5 , each of which has @xmath186 edges , and each time we need to add one vertex , trying various degrees @xmath187 , to all appropriate @xmath188 cliques . in order to avoid computing recursively the same optimal graphs",
    ", we need to start from the smallest possible optimal graph ( for @xmath189 ) , and build our way to the desired @xmath5 , and storing all the optimal graphs to memory .",
    "if we had to perform an exhaustive search , the complexity would be prohibitively large , @xmath190 .",
    "from the previous sections , it is now known that the form of the graphs with the smallest distance and largest clustering take the form of complete or almost complete subgraphs that are connected through one vertex . in order to generate very large networks that have this form",
    ", we can resort to a much simpler algorithm that has almost constant complexity , and can generate networks with arbitrarily many vertices , with the minimal average distance and very close to optimal clustering coefficient .",
    "given the order and size of the graph , we find the largest complete subgraph , which leaves enough edges for the rest of the network to be connected . then we subtract the number of vertices and edges used , and repeat the process until all the vertices and edges have been used . if at any point during the process , it is found that we can not form a subgraph with the number of vertices and edges , we backtrack and reduce the cluster in the previous step ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we have numerically computed the sensitivity of the network clustering under edge rewiring . in figure",
    "[ clusteringsensitivity ] , we show the evolution of the average clustering coefficient after rewiring a percentage of the edges , for a typical large network .",
    "if we rewire a small number of edges , this has no notable effect on the average clustering coefficient , since most of the vertices have only a small amount of neighbors that are not in their previous clique .",
    "this is a similar situation as in @xcite , with the only difference that the distance is very small from the start , and quite robust to rewirings , increasing less than @xmath191 even after we rewire a number of edges equal to the size of the network .     .",
    "at every step one edge is rewired and the new average clustering coefficient is measured .",
    "we repeat the process for a number of steps equal to the number of edges in the graph .",
    "the rate of decrease in clustering is very small at first , but increases as we introduce more randomness in network architecture .",
    "larger networks are more robust to rewiring a fixed number of edges . ]",
    "the small - world networks studied here are very robust to edge removal .",
    "since almost every vertex is part of a complete graph , we need to remove at least as many edges as the order of the smallest clique it belongs to in order to render the network disconnected . even in that case , the number of vertices disconnected is at most equal to the number of edges deleted .",
    "the situation is different for vertex removal . we immediately note that unless we have enough edges to build an almost complete graph , the network becomes disconnected if we remove the central vertex , and the number of disconnected components is the number of modules in the initial network .",
    "real world networks on the other hand , rarely have an articulation point .",
    "the robustness of a network to vertex failure is determined by its smallest cut set , and in this type of network , it consists of a single vertex ( the central vertex ) , removal of which will render it disconnected .",
    "depending on the application , we may be able to add new edges , which will increase the network s robustness to vertex failure .",
    "there are many ways to add the new edges , all of which result in reduced clustering .",
    "one of them is to distribute the new edges among vertices of the various modules , as shown in figure [ distributedadditionaledges ] .",
    "this method ensures that if the central vertex is removed , there are still communication channels among the different subsystems of the network .",
    "another way is shown in figure [ centraladditionaledges ] , where one or more of the vertices forms new connections with the vertices of all the other subgraphs , which in essence increases the number of central vertices . rewiring or adding new edges will have the least effect when they connect vertices with a large degree .",
    "a common alternative convention for the vertices with degree @xmath23 is to define their clustering coefficient as equal to @xmath192 .",
    "the process of finding the graphs with the largest clustering under this new convention is very similar to the previous case .",
    "the biggest difference is the form of graphs with a small number of edges , when they consist of at least one subgraph that is a tree . for @xmath193 ,",
    "the graph is disconnected , and the optimal form consists of a group of disconnected triangles .",
    "when @xmath194 , the only form a connected graph can take is a tree , in which case , any arrangement of the vertices will yield a clustering coefficient of zero , since there can be no triangles .",
    "as @xmath6 increases , we are able to form the first triangles , and the vertices that have nonzero clustering are part of a triangle , and have one more edge to the rest of the graph , keeping their degree low . as the number of edges increases further , and every edge is part of at least one triangle , the form of the optimal graphs resembles the form under the previous case , with only one difference , and after which point , no vertex has degree @xmath23 . some graphs , instead of having a unique cut vertex , have two cut vertices that are connected instead through one bridge edge , as shown in figure [ definitionfigure4a ] .",
    "( under the initial convention , the same graph would consist of the same two modules , plus one vertex with degree @xmath23 , connected to the single cut vertex ) .",
    "the last difference is that the definition of the almost complete graphs has to be changed so that the peripheral vertices have a degree of at least @xmath47 ( figures [ definitionfigure4b ] and [ definitionfigure4c ] .",
    "the process of finding the optimal graphs remains otherwise the same ( see @xcite ) , and an example for a graph of order @xmath195 is shown in figure [ all10conventional ] .",
    "comparing figures [ all10new ] and [ all10conventional ] , we immediately see the similarity of the optimal graphs in both cases .",
