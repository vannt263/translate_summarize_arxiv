    "a homeomorphism @xmath0 on a compact metric space @xmath1 is said to be _ expansive _ if there exists a positive constant @xmath2 , called an _ expansivity constant for @xmath0 _ , such that @xmath3 for all @xmath4 in @xmath5 .",
    "this class of homeomorphisms includes , among other examples , subshifts of finite type , pseudo - anosov homeomorphisms on surfaces and anosov diffeomorphisms .",
    "expansiveness is invariant under topological conjugation .",
    "one may easily construct trivial examples of expansive dynamics , such as the restriction of the north pole - south pole diffeomorphism to the closure of a single ( non trivial ) orbit .",
    "however , the presence of some topological properties on the space @xmath5 imposes severe restrictions to the behavior of an expansive homeomorphism @xmath0 , and viceversa .",
    "for instance , if @xmath6 is an @xmath7-dimensional orientable compact closed manifold , then the fact that @xmath0 is expansive on @xmath8 implies :    1 .",

    "@xmath8 can not be simply connected @xcite .",
    "results in @xcite make strong use of the fact that such homeomorphisms admit no stable points and that , furthermore , there are non - trivial , uniformly sized , connected pieces within both the local stable and unstable sets of each point ( definitions are in next paragraph ) .    on @xcite , a weaker notion of expansiveness is introduced , which is the following : a homeomorphism @xmath17 is said to be _ continuum - wise expansive ( cw - expansive ) _ if there exists a constant @xmath2 such that each non trivial continuum @xmath18 satisfies @xmath19 .",
    "this class contains the class of expansive homeomorphisms , but it is strictly larger , as may be seen in the following example :    considering @xmath20 as the quotient space of the projection map @xmath21 defined for each @xmath22 by @xmath23 , and providing @xmath20 with the metric @xmath24 ; it is not difficult to show that @xmath25 for any continuum @xmath26 such that @xmath27 . now ,",

    "the previous comment implies that @xmath29 is a cw - expansive homeomorphism on @xmath20 which can not be expansive due to @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to provide self contained proofs of the presence of non trivial connected pieces within the local stable and unstable sets of each point for cw - expansive homeomorphisms acting on locally connected compact metric spaces .",
    "the same result was obtained in @xcite for expansive homeomorphisms , though we use less sophisticated machinery . as a particular case",
    ", it follows that there are no stable points for this kind of dynamics , a property which is also known in the literature as _ sensitive dependence on the initial conditions_. the incidence of different forms of connectedness in these results is studied , obtaining counterexamples in some cases .",
