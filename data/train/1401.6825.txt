    "statistics of stellar multiple systems is important for several reasons , the major one being probably star formation . why some stars are born with stellar companions and",
    "some are not ? what is the relation between multiplicity , debris disks , and planetary systems ?",
    "are stellar mergers in multiple systems frequent and how they affect the initial mass function ? compared to binaries , hierarchical multiples with three or more components contain additional information such as period ratios , mass ratios , and relative orbit orientation . extracting and deciphering this information will help to understand star formation and , eventually , to predict statistics of stellar systems .",
    "stellar hierarchies matter because they evolve differently from simple binaries , helping to form close binaries @xcite and more exotic objects like blue stragglers @xcite .",
    "hieracrhical systems cause false positives in the search of exo - planets @xcite .",
    "the goal of this work is to establish unbiased statistics of hierarchical stellar systems ( triples , quadruples , etc ) .",
    "previous studies focused mostly on binaries and considered multiples only in passing . while reaching completeness for binaries is difficult , it becomes even more problematic for hierarchies . as",
    "hierarchical systems are less frequent than binaries , their study requires larger samples .",
    "for example , the 25-pc volume surveyed by @xcite contains only 454 targets , 56 of which ( 12% ) are triple or higher - order multiples  too few to grasp the statistics of hierarchies .",
    "we extend the horizon of previous multiplicity studies to the distance of 67pc , with 10@xmath3 more objects .",
    "solar - type dwarfs are chosen as primary targets , and a well defined volume - limited sample is constructed from the _ hipparcos _ catalog @xcite .",
    "solar - type dwarfs are traditionally selected for multiplicity study because stars of lower mass are faint , while more massive stars are rare and distant .",
    "although the knowledge of multiplicity in different mass regimes and environments is needed , nearby dwarfs are the first and easiest step towards this goal",
    ".    our task is simplified by the existence of extensive data on nearby stars .",
    "many targets are being monitored for exo - planets in radial velocity ( rv ) , providing at the same time strong constraints on stellar companions .",
    "collection of published data ( data - mining ) is the cornerstone of this study .",
    "it is complemented by small surveys designed to fill the lacking information . instead of attempting to observe all @xmath25000 stars with complementary techniques required to detect companions over the full range of periods and mass ratios , we explore specific areas of the parameter space .",
    "particular attention is directed to binaries , trying to convert them into triples and to constrain the frequency of sub - systems .",
    "detection limits of various techniques are quantified and used to correct the remaining incompleteness .",
    "many stars in this sample host known exo - planets , more planets will be discovered in the future .",
    "here we focus on _ stellar _ companions and mention exo - hosts only in the notes .",
    "study of planets in stellar multiple systems is an interesting research topic @xcite , it will be advanced by this data collection .    in the accompanying paper ii",
    "we present the statistical analysis of stellar hierarchies and place it in the context of prior work , while this first part ( paper i ) contains the data .",
    "it begins by the definition of the sample in  [ sec : sample ] , followed by the review of data sources and methods in  [ sec : data ] .",
    "evaluation of detection completeness is covered in  [ sec : det ] .",
    "tables containing information on individual components and systems are presented in  [ sec : tables ] .",
    "the paper concludes by the overview of this data collection in  [ sec : overview ] .",
    "targets for this survey are selected from the _ hipparcos-2",
    "_ catalog ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter hip2 ) by the following criteria .",
    "1 .   trigonometric parallax @xmath4mas ( within 67pc of the sun , distance modulus @xmath5 ) .",
    "targets with parallax error @xmath6mas are excluded .",
    "color @xmath7 ( this corresponds approximately to spectral types from f5v to g6v , masses from 0.85 to 1.5 @xmath8 ) .",
    "unevolved , satisfying the condition @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the absolute magnitude in the _ hipparcos _ band calculated with @xmath11 .",
    "subgiants are included in the sample .",
    "figure  [ fig : cmd ] shows the @xmath12 color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of _ hipparcos _ stars .",
    "the upper cutoff in absolute magnitude is set at about @xmath13 above the main sequence to avoid discrimination against multiple stars . the hyades cluster in included in the sample .",
    "the criteria formulated above select 5040 stars from hip2 .",
    "however , components of wide binaries with two individual hip entries must be counted only once ( their secondaries are removed from the target list , even though they fulfill the sample criteria ) .",
    "we also removed targets that have wide companions more massive than 1.5@xmath14 .",
    "about 50 other targets ( 1% ) are removed for various other reasons , e.g. stars located far below the main sequence ( see figure  [ fig : cmd ] ) and stars with erroneous @xmath15 colors in hip2 ( checked against photometry in other bands and/or spectral type ) .",
    "cleaning reduces the original selection by 4% , leaving 4847 targets ( primary components ) .",
    "the selection criteria are blurred by observational errors in colors ( the vertical lines in figure  [ fig : cmd ] are not sharp ) and distances .",
    "the actual errors of _ hipparcos _ parallaxes sometimes exceed their formal errors , especially for binaries .",
    "we do not reject targets near the 15mas cutoff if they appear to be further away based on photometry .",
    "some solar - mass stars within 67pc are missed in the fg-67 sample because they were not included in the _ hipparcos _ catalog , for example the nearby multiple systems @xmath16  cnc and @xmath17  uma .",
    "the masses of primary components in the fg-67 sample are larger than in the 25-pc sample of raghavan et al . ; the lower cutoff in mass is dictated here by the completeness of the _ hipparcos _ catalog .",
    "for this reason , the size of the fg-67 sample is less than the size of the 25-pc sample scaled as cube of the distance limit .",
    "completeness of the fg-67 sample is illustrated in figure  [ fig : checkdist ] .",
    "the number of targets within distance @xmath18 is proportional to @xmath19 , so their spatial density is nearly constant , dropping only by 10% at 67pc .",
    "a drop of 8% is expected if the vertical scale of the galactic disk is 300pc , so the completeness of the present sample is above 90% .",
    "the density of 1769 non - single targets declines with distance slightly faster , indicating progressively increasing incompleteness of the binary census .",
    "the observed multiplicity fraction is therefore @xmath20 , to be compared to the true @xmath21 derived by @xcite and confirmed in paper ii .",
    "the overall completeness of companion detection is reasonably high , about 80% .",
    "all data on a given system are linked by the _ hipparcos _ number of its primary component , hip0 .",
    "four tables , presented in detail in  [ sec : tables ] , contain information on the individual components ( comp ) , binary pairings ( sys ) , detection limits ( det ) , and notes ( notes ) , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : dat ] .",
    "custom software written in idl helps to maintain this database : browse and edit the data , evaluate system parameters and companion detection probability , query some catalogs .",
    "components can be placed on the @xmath22 or @xmath23 cmds to check the consistency of their parallax .",
    "colors in various pass - bands are checked for consistency with colors of main - sequence dwarfs .",
    "each binary system has two important attributes .",
    "the first , component designation , describes the hierarchy by a the comma - separated list of three components , ( primary , secondary , parent ) .",
    "for example , the visual binary hip  518 has components a , b , * ( asterisk in place of the parent denotes the _ root _ of the hierarchy , i.e. the outer - most pair ) .",
    "the spectroscopic sub - system in the secondary component is ba , bb , b .",
    "this designation is explained in @xcite and is now used in the multiple star catalog @xcite .",
    "the second attribute is the _ type _ of the system , meaning discovery techniques such as spectroscopic binaries ( type s ) , visual binaries ( type v ) , etc .",
    ", as detailed further in this section . the type determines the sense of system parameters such as separation and period ; they are either derived from the orbital solutions or estimated (   [ sec : syspar ] ) .",

    "many wide companions listed in the wds are chance projections ( optical ) , denoted as type x. this can be revealed by their fast relative motion incompatible with a keplerian orbit , or by companion s magnitude and color that do not match the values expected for a main sequence dwarf at the same distance as the primary , or by the difference in rv .",
