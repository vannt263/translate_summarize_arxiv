    "the identification of the higgs boson(s ) is one of the main goals of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) being constructed at cern . according to current theoretical prejudice",
    "it is likely that a higgs boson will exist in the mass range @xmath8  gev . in the standard model description of electroweak data ,",
    "the virtual effects favour a higgs with mass at , or just above , the lep bound of 114  gev .",
    "moreover , in the minimal supersymmetric model a scalar standard - model - like higgs boson with mass below 135  gev should exist .",
    "however , the experimental detection of such a ` light ' higgs boson at the lhc will be challenging .",
    "there is no obvious perfect detection process .",
    "rather there is a range of complementary possibilities , as illustrated in table  1 .",
    "the table shows the number of identified higgs events and the number of background events , for a standard model higgs boson of mass @xmath9  gev for the integrated luminosity of 30  fb@xmath10 planned for the first two or three years of lhc running , for each of the various proposed detection channels .",
    "a glance at the table shows that , _ either _ large signals are accompanied by a huge background , _ or _ the processes have comparable signal and background rates for which the number of higgs events is rather small .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the number of signal and background events for various methods of higgs detection at the lhc .",
    "the significance of the signal is also given .",
    "the mass of the higgs boson is taken to be 120  gev and the integrated luminosity is taken to be 30 fb@xmath10 .",
    "the notation @xmath11 is to indicate that the gluons originate within overall colour - singlet ( hard pomeron ) @xmath12-channel exchanges ; see , for example , fig .  1 .",
    "the entries for the various processes are taken , or scaled from the results for 100 fb@xmath10 luminosity , from references ( a ) @xcite , ( b ) @xcite , ( d ) @xcite , ( e ) @xcite , ( g , h ) @xcite and ( i ) @xcite , where the @xmath13 factors have been omitted .",
    "processes ( c ) and ( f ) are discussed in detail in sections  2 and 3 , respectively , of this paper .",
    "a detailed study of the nlo contributions to the irreducible background to the @xmath14 signal shows the @xmath13 factor is 0.65  that of the signal @xcite .",
    "taking these @xmath13 factors into account the authors find that the significance of the @xmath14 signal may increase to @xmath15",
    ".    besides containing the conventional processes for the detection of a light higgs boson , the table also lists processes ( c , d , f ) with a rapidity gap on either side of the boson , which provide a clean environment for its production .",
    "these processes are often overlooked , but they have special advantages . here",
    "we shall study two of these processes in detail .",
    "first , in section  2 , we discuss the exclusive process @xmath16 , where the + sign indicates the presence of a rapidity gap .",
    "we show that it is possible to tag the outgoing protons such that the higgs may be identified , and its mass measured to an accuracy of about 1  gev , using the ` missing mass ' method .",
    "that is using tagged protons we have @xmath17 with @xmath18 .",
    "importantly , the process allows an independent measurement of the higgs mass via the @xmath0 decay , @xmath19 , although now the resolution is much poorer with @xmath20 .",
    "the existence of matching peaks , centred about @xmath21 , is a unique feature of the exclusive diffractive higgs signal spectrum , see process  ( a ) of table  1 . ] . besides its obvious value in identifying the higgs and in sharpening the determination of its mass",
    ", we will see that the mass equality also plays a key role in reducing background contributions .",
    "another advantage of the @xmath22 signal is that , at leading order , the @xmath23 background process is suppressed by a @xmath24 selection rule , see section  2.3 @xcite .",
    "of course , we have to pay a price for the survival of the rapidity gaps , so the event rate is low .",
    "nevertheless the process has the advantage that the signal exceeds the background .",
    "the absolute value of the @xmath25 cross section has been calculated in refs .",
    "the derivation is outlined in section  2.1 .",
    "moreover the predicted value can be checked experimentally by measuring the rate of the double - diffractive production of dijets ( of comparable mass ) .",
    "the uncertainties of the calculation of the @xmath26 cross section are discussed in section  2.2 .",
    "equally important to the calculation of the exclusive double - diffractive @xmath27 signal , is the estimation of the @xmath1 background .",
    "the background processes are found to be suppressed by their spin and colour structure , and are interesting in their own right .",
    "the various sources of the background are discussed in sections  2.3 and 2.4 .",
    "first , in section  2.3 , we summarize the sources , together with their sizes relative to the higgs signal , and then , in section  2.4 , we give the detailed justification of the results .",
    "section  2.5 is devoted to a study of production by soft pomeron - pomeron collisions .",
    "we find that it gives a negligible contribution both to the exclusive @xmath0 signal and to the background . in section  2.6",
    ", we turn to a discussion of the experimental issues connected with the exclusive diffractive signal .",
    "we study the experimental efficiencies , the choice of cuts , the accurate determination of the ` missing mass ' via the measurement of the forward protons and , finally , the problems connected with the ` pile - up ' of multiple interactions in each beam crossing .",
    "the second process that we study is the central production of a higgs boson via @xmath28 fusion @xmath29 see section  3 .",
    "we may suppress the background to this process by exploiting the fact that the cross section is rather flat as a function of the transverse momentum , @xmath30 , of the higgs boson , on account of the large @xmath31 boson mass .",
    "moreover , since this process is mediated by @xmath12 channel @xmath31 exchange , which is a point - like colourless object , there is no corresponding bremsstrahlung in the central region @xcite and hence no sudakov suppression of the rapidity gaps .",
    "in this section we make a detailed study of the third process of table  1 , namely @xcite @xmath32 where the higgs decays via the @xmath1 mode .",
    "we assume that the outgoing protons and the @xmath33 and @xmath34 jets can be identified and measured , and that there are no other particles in the final state .",
    "we quantify both the signal and the background for this exclusive process and , moreover , discuss the relevant experimental issues .      the basic mechanism for the process is shown in fig .  1 .",
    "it turns out that the typical values of the transverse momentum @xmath36 of the gluon , which screens the colour , are much smaller than @xmath37 , but are yet sufficiently large for perturbative qcd to be applicable .",
    "the amplitude is @xcite @xmath38 where the @xmath39 s are the skewed unintegrated gluon densities of the proton , and where the @xmath40 vertex factor is @xmath41 with the nlo @xmath13 factor @xmath42 .",
    "the longitudinal momentum fractions carried by the gluons satisfy @xmath43 where , for the lhc , @xmath44  tev . in this domain",
    "the skewed unintegrated densities are given in terms of the conventional ( integrated ) densities @xmath45 .",
    "to single log accuracy , we have @xcite @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the survival probability that the gluon remains untouched in the evolution up to the hard scale @xmath48 .",
    "this sudakov factor @xmath49 is the result of resumming the virtual contributions in the dglap evolution .",
    "it is given by @xmath50dz\\right ) .",
    "\\label{eq : t}\\ ] ]    the square root of @xmath49 arises in ( [ eq : fsubg ] ) because the survival probability is only relevant to the hard gluon .",
    "note that the gluon with @xmath51 is almost ` at rest ' and so there is no possibility of qcd radiation @xcite .",
    "the multiplicative factor @xmath52 is the ratio of the skewed @xmath53 integrated distribution to the conventional diagonal density . for @xmath54",
    "the factor is completely determined @xcite .",
    "we find @xmath55 at the energy of the lhc .",
    "the radiation associated with the @xmath40 hard subprocess is not the only means to populate and to destroy the rapidity gaps .",
    "there is also the possibility of soft rescattering in which particles from the underlying event populate the gaps .",
    "the probability , @xmath56 , that the gaps survive the soft @xmath57 rescattering was calculated using a two - channel eikonal model , which incorporates high mass diffraction @xcite .",
    "the parameters of the model were obtained from a global analysis of all available soft @xmath57 ( and @xmath58 ) scattering data . in this way",
    ", we find @xmath59 for the process @xmath35 at the lhc . including this factor ,",
    "the cross section is predicted to be @xcite @xmath60 for the production of a standard model higgs of mass 120  gev at the lhc .    in section  2.2",
    "we estimate a factor of two uncertainty in the cross section prediction given in ( [ eq : sigma ] ) . on the other hand it is frequently quoted that the predictions of the cross section for diffractive higgs production cover many orders of magnitude , and for this reason the many authors choose not to consider this higgs signal .",
    "this is unfortunate .",
    "sometimes the rates of different diffractive mechanisms are compared .",
    "sometimes models are used to predict the exclusive signal which are not valid .",
    "indeed , care must be taken when comparing the theoretical predictions for the exclusive @xmath25 process with the results of monte carlo simulations .",
    "for example , when implementing the soft colour interaction ( sci ) prescription @xcite in pythia @xcite , it was found @xcite that hard production in single diffractive processes observed at the tevatron could be described reasonably well , but that the generator hardly ever produces any ` double - pomeron - exchange ' events .",
    "finally , an extremely low limit was claimed @xcite for the exclusive @xmath25 cross section .",
    "the fact that such a generator yields an extremely low probability for exclusive processes is not surprising .",
    "the generator was created to simulate _",
    "inelastic _ processes .",
    "it operates by starting from the hard subprocess and generates the parton showers by backward evolution .",
    "the generator never accounts for the important coherence between different parton showers , nor for the colourless nature of the initial particles .",
    "the incoming protons are just considered as a system of coloured partons . as a consequence , the probability not to emit additional secondary jets ( and so to reproduce an exclusive process ) turns out to be negligibly small . in particular , such a generator is unable to reproduce the elastic cross section .",
    "such generators create many secondary minijets at the parton shower stage and the probability to screen all these minijets by colour interchange is extremely low .",
    "such generators were not constructed to reproduce exclusive processes , where the colour coherence effects and colourless nature of the incoming hadrons are important .",
    "note that , in principle , ( [ eq : sigma ] ) is an absolute prediction for @xmath61 .",
    "of course , the various inputs are subject to uncertainty .",
    "let us discuss these in turn .",
    "first we have the large suppression from the probability @xmath62 that the rapidity gaps survive soft @xmath57 rescattering . from the analysis @xcite of all soft @xmath57 data we estimate the accuracy of the prediction for @xmath56 is @xmath63 .",
    "one check of the eikonal model calculations of @xmath56 is the estimate of the diffractive dijet production rate measured by the cdf collaboration @xcite at the tevatron .",
    "the rate , when calculated using factorization and the diffractive structure functions obtained from hera data , lies about a factor of 10 above the cdf data .",
    "however , when rescattering corrections are included , and the survival probabilities computed , remarkably good agreement with the cdf measurements is obtained @xcite .",
    "there is , perhaps , a small tendency that an even stronger suppression is required , so the true survival probabilities @xmath56 may be a bit smaller than our predictions .",
    "second , although , on account of the sudakov form factor , the @xmath36 integral in ( [ eq : amplitudem ] ) is infrared safe , the cross section may have some contribution from the non - perturbative region .",
    "again , we expect an accuracy of @xmath63 , but in this case the + sign looks more realistic .",
    "the uncertainties in the gluon densities @xmath39 in the integrand are estimated at @xmath64 , leading to a @xmath65 error on the cross section .",
    "this estimate takes into account the accuracy of the value of @xmath52 and the uncertainty on the integrated gluon density @xmath66 , at @xmath67 relevant to the lhc .",
    "finally , we have nlo contributions to the sudakov @xmath49 factor ( @xmath68 ) and nnlo corrections to the @xmath69 vertex factor ( @xmath68 ) . adding these errors in quadrature",
    "gives a _ factor two _ uncertainty in ( [ eq : sigma ] ) .",
    "we stress that the predicted value of the cross section can be checked experimentally .",
    "all the ingredients , except for the nlo correction to the @xmath40 vertex , are the same for our signal as for exclusive double - diffractive dijet production , @xmath70 , where the dijet system is chosen in the same kinematic domain as the higgs boson , that is @xmath71 @xcite .",
    "therefore by observing the larger dijet production rate , we can confirm , or correct , the estimate of the exclusive higgs signal .",
    "of course , so far our discussion has been within the confines of the standard model .",
    "we should not overlook the possibility that the exclusive higgs signal may reveal new physics .",
    "for example , the higgs cross section will be 4 ( or even 9 ) times larger if there were to exist a fourth doublet containing one ( or two ) quarks heavier than the higgs .",
    "for a light higgs boson the dominant decay channel is @xmath0 .",
    "however , it is impossible to observe this decay in an inclusive process at the lhc , since it is overwhelmed by a huge qcd @xmath1 background .",
    "the advantage of exclusive double - diffractive higgs production with forward going protons is that there exists a @xmath24 , parity even , selection rule , which strongly suppresses the leading order @xmath73 background subprocess .",
    "the @xmath74 superscript is to indicate that each gluon comes from a colour - singlet @xmath12 channel state .",
    "one way to see the @xmath24 selection rule is to note that , in the equivalent gluon approach ( or in a planar gauge ) , the polarisation vectors of the @xmath12 channel gluons in fig .",
    "1 are aligned along the transverse component of the loop momentum @xmath75 @xcite . integrating over @xmath75 leads to the amplitude @xmath76 of the @xmath11 fusion subprocess being formed from the average over the two transverse polarisations @xmath77 of the incoming gluons @xmath78 the delta symbol",
    "reflects the @xmath24 , parity even , character of the di - gluon @xmath11 incoming state . for _ colour - singlet _ @xmath1 production the born - level contributions of figs .",
    "2(a ) and 2(b ) cancel each other , in the massless @xmath79 limit , due to summation ( [ eq : matrixelementsm ] ) .",
    "more generally , as a consequence of helicity conservation , and @xmath80 and @xmath49 invariance , for the real parts of the @xmath81  @xmath73 amplitudes @xcite , the corresponding contributions to the cross section vanish with decreasing quark mass as @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the transverse energy of the @xmath33 or @xmath34 jet .",
    "it is convenient , first , to list the possible sources of the @xmath1 background to the exclusive @xmath84 higgs signal and to state the size of each background in terms of the signal .",
    "the justification for the numerical values is given in the next subsection ,  2.4 .",
    "we quote the @xmath85 using the anticipated missing mass resolution , @xmath86 , expected from employing taggers for the outgoing protons .    at leading order ( lo )",
    "there are @xmath87``@xmath88 '' background contributions , despite the @xmath24 selection rule , which we summarize below .",
    "* the prolific @xmath89 subprocess may mimic @xmath1 production since we may misidentify the outgoing gluons as @xmath33 and @xmath34 jets .",
    "assuming the expected 1% probability of misidentification and applying @xmath90 jet cut , we estimate @xmath91 .",
    "* there is an admixture of @xmath92 production , arising from non - forward going protons @xcite .",
    "it gives @xmath93 .",
    "* for a massive quark there is a contribution to the @xmath24 lo cross section of order @xmath82 , leading to @xmath91 .    at next - to - leading order(nlo ) , we have the possibility of @xmath94 background contributions .",
    "* the extra gluon may go unobserved in the direction of a forward proton .",
    "this background may be effectively eliminated by requiring the approximate equality @xmath21 . *",
    "the extra gluon is collinear with either the @xmath33 or @xmath34 jet .",
    "we will show that this is suppressed for soft radiation by the specific spin structure of the process selection rule suppression to soft radiation is true for soft radiation at any angle . ] , and leaves a background coming from three jet @xmath95 production with @xmath91 .",
    "we also consider nnlo @xmath96 background contributions .",
    "* there is a nnlo @xmath1 contribution , which comes from the diagram formed by the product of the nlo amplitudes , which is negligibly small . *",
    "another source of this background may be called central inelastic production @xcite , where the @xmath0 signal or qcd @xmath1 background is accompanied by central soft gluon radiation .",
    "we will show that it causes a 12% high mass tail to the ` missing mass ' higgs signal , and again gives a negligible contribution to the background .",
    "finally , we consider the effects from the collisions of two soft pomerons . after imposing the missing mass equality , we find that production by pomeron - pomeron fusion gives a negligible contribution to both the @xmath0 signal and the @xmath1 background .",
    "pomeron - pomeron fusion is discussed separately in section  2.5 .    in summary",
    ", taking all these sources of background into account , we would expect a signal / background ratio of about four .",
    "the reliability of this signal - to - background estimate , @xmath97 , with respect to the theoretical uncertainties , is much better than the factor of two uncertainty in the signal itself .",
    "this is because the gap survival probability , @xmath56 , the unintegrated gluon distributions , @xmath39 , the nlo @xmath49-factor and even the contribution from the low @xmath36 non - perturbative domain are common admixture which has a different structure in the @xmath36 loop integral for the signal and the background . ] to both the signal , @xmath98 , and the background , @xmath99 .",
    "thus the main theoretical uncertainties cancel in the ratio .",
    "however , there is another source of uncertainty due to the higher - order virtual corrections to the background processes .",
    "we call these , at present unknown , contributions the background @xmath13  factor .",
    "since we have included the @xmath13 factor for the higgs signal in ( [ eq : asquared ] ) , we conservatively take the same @xmath13 factor for the background .",
    "the effect is to reduce @xmath100 to about 3 .    of course ,",
    "the experimental uncertainties depend on the values of the mass resolutions , @xmath101 and @xmath102 , the probability to misidentify a gluon as a @xmath33-jet , the @xmath33-jet tagging efficiency and on the appropriate choice of the jet cone size @xmath103 ; see section  2.6 . here we have taken values which should be attainable , but clearly , in practice , these have to be optimized with reference to the detector , and further gains are possible .      here",
    "we quantify each of the potential backgrounds listed above .",
    "as a reference point we start with the largest exclusive signal , that is one in which we have no @xmath33 jet identification . in other words , we have the central production of a pair of high @xmath104 jets together with tagged outgoing protons .",
    "for this situation the ratio of the background to the higgs signal factor is included for the @xmath40 vertex , ( [ eq : asquared ] ) , but in ( [ eq : btos ] ) we omit the virtual nlo corrections to the background . for presentation purposes",
    ", the denominator in ( [ eq : btos ] ) actually refers to only the @xmath0 component and does not include the @xmath105 decays ; for @xmath9  gev , including the @xmath105 mode would enlarge the denominator by about 10% . ]",
    "is @xmath106 where we have normalised the ratio to the expected experimental missing mass resolution , @xmath107 . for clarity , we omit this factor in brackets from now on in this subsection . in ( [ eq : btos ] ) , the qcd background has been suppressed by imposing the polar angle acceptance cut , @xmath108 , in the jet - jet centre - of - mass frame .",
    "the cut removes half of the @xmath1 higgs signal , but more importantly removes the @xmath89 infrared singularity .    using ( [ eq : btos ] ) as a reference point",
    ", we now estimate the background / signal for the exclusive process for each of the sources of background listed in section  2.3 .",
    "we divide them into background contributions at lo , nlo and nnlo .      * clearly , for the exclusive double - diffractive higgs signal to be of value , we must reduce @xmath85 of ( [ eq : btos ] ) . we therefore need to tag both the @xmath33 and @xmath34 jets .",
    "even so , there is a chance that the gluons are misidentified as @xmath33 and @xmath34 jets .",
    "the expected probability of misidentification is about 1% .",
    "therefore by observing the @xmath33 and @xmath34 jets we reduce the background by @xmath109 , and hence @xmath110 * of course , there is a background from qcd @xmath1 production itself .",
    "we have emphasized that at lo this vanishes in the massless quark limit , @xmath79 , due to the @xmath24 selection rule .",
    "however , there is an admixture of @xmath92 caused by the transverse momenta @xmath111 of the outgoing protons . in the exact forward direction ,",
    "the @xmath24 selection rule is simply a consequence of angular momentum conservation and the absence of spin - spin correlations between particles separated by a large rapidity gap , which , in comparison with the unpolarised structure function , is suppressed by a power of @xmath112 .",
    "that is the correlation is suppressed exponentially by the size of the rapidity gap . ] .",
    "however , violation of the rule can come from orbital angular momenta , @xmath113 . for our process ,",
    "the distance @xmath114 is controlled , not by the size of the proton , but by the effective size of the @xmath12-channel @xmath115 state . hence @xmath116 .",
    "therefore the admixture of @xmath92 states is strongly suppressed by the ratio @xmath117 .",
    "it was estimated in @xcite that the mean @xmath92 admixture is less than 1.5% .",
    "in addition , @xmath1 production ( even for @xmath92 ) is suppressed in comparison to @xmath115 production by a factor @xmath118 due to the colour and spin @xmath119 character of the quark .",
    "the factor represents the exact ratio of the subprocess cross sections at @xmath120 ( see equations ( 49 ) and ( 52 ) of @xcite ) .",
    "thus we have @xmath121 where @xmath122 would have been the @xmath73 background if the @xmath24 selection rule had not existed , that is if we had averaged over the incoming gluon helicities in the usual way ( as for inclusive production ) , rather than as in ( [ eq : matrixelementsm ] ) . *",
    "a second way to avoid the @xmath24 prohibition of the lo background process , @xmath73 , is to allow for the @xmath33 quark mass . at lo",
    "the cross section is suppressed by a factor @xmath82 in comparison to @xmath1 production @xmath122 in the absence of the @xmath24 selection .",
    "it is even smaller if we account for the non - sudakov double - logarithmic suppression @xcite . for the acceptance cut",
    "@xmath108 the jet transverse energy @xmath123 , and thus @xmath124      the nlo subprocess @xmath125 also generates a background for our exclusive double - diffractive higgs signal .",
    "first recall that the virtual nlo @xmath126 correction has already been included in the @xmath40 vertex , ( [ eq : asquared ] ) .",
    "of course , the extra gluon jet may be observed experimentally in the central detector and so these background events can be readily eliminated .",
    "the exceptions are the emission of the gluon , first , in one of the beam directions and , second , at large angles , either with small energy @xmath127 or in the @xmath33 or @xmath34 jet direction .    * extra gluon radiation in either of the beam directions",
    "can not be observed directly . on the other hand",
    "we know it must be energetic .",
    "the size of the initial colour - singlet system is @xmath128 .",
    "therefore the transverse momentum of the emitted gluon should be greater than 1  gev . if the gluon is to go unobserved outside the calorimeter , that is to have @xmath129 , then the gluon energy @xmath130  gev .",
    "this considerably violates the required equality @xmath131 for a higgs signal , and so this background can be eliminated .",
    "* now we come to the background associated with large angle gluon emission .",
    "first we note that soft gluon emission from the @xmath33 and @xmath34 quark jets themselves is not a problem , since for this case we retain the cancellation between the graphs of fig .",
    "next we note that emission from the virtual @xmath33 quark line is suppressed by at least a factor of @xmath132 in the amplitude ( and maybe an even higher power cross section shows a @xmath133 suppression , see for example @xcite .",
    "this is a consequence of the low - burnett - kroll theorem @xcite , see @xcite . ] of @xmath132 ) , where @xmath134 and @xmath135 are , respectively , the energies of a gluon and outgoing @xmath33 quark in the @xmath73 centre - of - mass frame .",
    "formally , the factor arises from the large virtuality of the extra @xmath33 quark propagator , and reflects the fact that the @xmath136 formation time of the extra soft gluon is much larger than the lifetime of the virtual @xmath12 channel @xmath33 quark .",
    "+ the potential danger is emission from one of the incoming @xmath12 channel gluons . at first sight",
    "it appears to be a rather large contribution of order @xmath137 , where the large log comes from the @xmath138 integration embracing soft gluon emission . on the other hand , to accuracy @xmath132",
    ", we deal with pure classical emission which does not change the spin structure of the amplitude .",
    "therefore we might expect the same cancellation between the graphs of fig .",
    "3(a ) and 3(b ) as was obtained in fig .  2 .",
    "but now the @xmath1 system is in a _ colour octet _ state and the commutator @xmath139 = if_{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma}t_\\gamma \\label{eq : commutator}\\ ] ] spoils the cancellation . here",
    "@xmath140 are the colour matrices of the quark - gluon vertices .",
    "all is not lost , however , since now we have a third diagram , fig .",
    "3(c ) , which has precisely the colour and spin structure to restore the cancellation .",
    "thus soft gluon emissions from the initial colour - singlet @xmath11 state factorize ( see , for example , @xcite ) and , due to the overriding @xmath24 selection rule , qcd @xmath1 production is still suppressed . in this way",
    "the @xmath141 contribution is neutralised and we are left with @xmath142 large angle hard gluon emission .",
    "such three jet @xmath95 production can be observed and excluded experimentally , except for hard gluon radiation along the @xmath33 and @xmath34 jet directions .",
    "if we denote the cone angle needed to separate the @xmath143 jet from the @xmath33 ( or @xmath34 ) jet by @xmath103 , then the expected background from unresolved three jet events is of about subprocess is given ) .",
    "] @xmath144 for @xmath145 , where @xmath146 . in ( [ eq : expectedbackground ] ) we sum the contributions from gluon emission in the directions of both @xmath33 and @xmath34 jets .",
    "recall that @xmath122 is the @xmath73 rate in the absence of the @xmath24 selection rule . noting ( [ eq : btos ] ) and ( [ eq : bbartos ] ) , we thus see that we have a background - to - signal ratio of @xmath147 this source of background",
    "may be further suppressed by choosing smaller size @xmath33 and @xmath34 jet cones , @xmath103 .",
    "the price is the presence of an extra sudakov form factor which accounts for the absence of bremsstrahlung outside the more confined cone , that is radiation which would normally be allowed in the jet hadronisation . as we need to exclude only hard gluon radiation , this is a single , not double , logarithmic form factor .",
    "it is present in both the signal and the background , and so does not change the @xmath100 ratio .",
    "however , it reduces the number of selected events .",
    "the form factor is estimated to be @xmath148 .",
    "on the other hand it is possible that if we take a smaller @xmath149 then we will improve the efficiency of the @xmath33 and @xmath34 identification . in this way , the sudakov suppression arising from a smaller @xmath103 could be partly compensated . of course , in practice , we should choose the jet cone size @xmath103 to optimize the significance of the signal .",
    "* there is a contribution to the @xmath1 qcd background cross section at nnlo , which comes from the ` square ' of nlo amplitudes , in which the @xmath24 amplitude for the @xmath73 subprocess does not vanish , even in the massless quark limit .",
    "note that , for the imaginary part of the one - loop box diagram , the arguments based on @xmath49 invariance are redundant  @xcite .",
    "however , numerically , this @xmath1 background contribution appears to be very small ( see  @xcite for an explicit calculation in the case of @xmath150 , and also @xcite ) .",
    "this is because it is suppressed by the two - loop factor @xmath151 , where @xmath126 is taken at a large scale of the order of @xmath152 .",
    "therefore the corresponding ratio @xmath85 does not exceed 0.01 , and can be safely neglected .",
    "* finally , there is a background to @xmath153 due to central inelastic production , where the @xmath1 pair ( or higgs boson ) is accompanied by soft qcd radiation in the central region , see fig .",
    "hard radiation is excluded by requiring the mass equality @xmath21 , as noted above .",
    "moreover , recall that soft radiation from the final @xmath33 or @xmath34 quark lines is already included in the jet finding algorithm .",
    "so we are left with central soft radiation from the @xmath12 channel lines .",
    "due to factorization of soft gluon radiation from the colour - singlet @xmath11 state ( see , for example , @xcite ) , this emission does not alter the signal - to - background ratio .",
    "however , it could blur out the sharp missing - mass peak of the higgs signal .",
    "fortunately , the phase space for such radiation is strongly limited by requiring the @xmath21 mass balance .",
    "consider the emission of two extra soft gluons , that is the nnlo subprocess @xmath154 .",
    "( one extra gluon can not be produced together with the higgs boson from the colour - singlet @xmath11 state , and the @xmath95 qcd background has already been considered in ( iv ) above . ) using factorization , the probability of the emission of the extra two gluons is @xmath155 ^ 2 , \\label{eq : probability}\\ ] ] where the first factor reflects colour - singlet production , @xmath156 accounts for the identity of the two gluons , the factor @xmath157 allows for emission from both incoming gluons and the familiar double - log accounts for emission with gluon energies @xmath158 , as discussed before . the energy @xmath134 may be bounded by experimentally requiring @xmath21 . if we assume an experimental resolution @xmath159 and take @xmath160 at the low @xmath161 scale , then the probability ( [ eq : probability ] ) is about 12% .",
    "this @xmath162 background does not affect the significance of the exclusive higgs signal , but produces a small tail on the high side of the missing mass peak .",
    "due to the factorization of soft gluon emission , which we discussed in ( v ) , the direct qcd @xmath96 production is additionally suppressed by the @xmath24 selection rule , and is hence negligible .",
    "in addition to the central inelastic production , fig .",
    "4(a ) , studied above , there exists another class of diagrams , figs .",
    "4(b  or  c ) , in which the colour flow is screened in a different way .",
    "these diagrams describe production by soft pomeron - pomeron inelastic collisions , as compared to diagram  4(a ) .",
    "of course the coupling is taken at a low scale , but nevertheless we should not be surprised when we find the contribution of 4(c ) is less than that of 4(a ) . ] . within this approach",
    ", one may use the factorizable , a la ingelman - schlein @xcite , model in which the higgs ( or @xmath1 pair ) is created by a @xmath40 ( or @xmath163 ) subprocess that is driven by the ` gluon structure functions ' of the pomerons themselves @xcite .    here",
    "we check the size of the background to the exclusive higgs signal which comes from soft pomeron - pomeron collisions .",
    "we use the donnachie - landshoff parameterization @xcite to calculate the pomeron flux and take the gluon structure function of the pomeron to be @xmath164 , which is consistent with the h1 analysis @xcite . besides the relatively low values of the pomeron flux and of @xmath165 , the main suppression comes from the requirement that the pomeron - pomeron mass ( @xmath166 ) measured by the tagged protons , should lie within the @xmath167 mass interval .",
    "this mass balance requires that the gluon in the pomeron has momentum fraction @xmath168 close to 1 , where the structure function @xmath169 becomes small . to allow for uncertainties in the h1 analysis",
    "we conservatively take @xmath170 , even in this large @xmath168 domain .",
    "then the cross section for the pomeron - pomeron fusion subprocess is , see ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath171 we mentioned that the phenomenological flux of the soft pomeron is relatively small .",
    "indeed , for @xmath172 the effective pomeron - pomeron luminosity is a factor two smaller than the corresponding luminosity for the exclusive process , which was calculated in terms of the unintegrated gluon distributions ( compare the curves denoted by ` soft @xmath173 ' and ` excl ' in fig .",
    "2(c ) of ref .",
    "so , finally , the suppression factor in going from the exclusive process to fig .",
    "4(b ) is @xmath174 if we take @xmath175  gev . even though the @xmath24 selection rule is absent for pomeron - pomeron production",
    ", it gives a background which is much less than the background caused by the @xmath92 admixture of ( ii ) .",
    "if we consider pomeron - pomeron production of the @xmath0 signal , then there is an additional suppression coming from a factor @xmath176 , since the gluons producing the higgs must have the same helicity and colour . in practice",
    "such a soft pomeron - pomeron source of the signal appears to be very small , even for @xmath177 .",
    "our estimates of the inclusive double - diffractive background @xmath1 production , when translated to tevatron energies , agree reasonably well with the monte carlo simulation of ref .",
    "of course , in ref .",
    "@xcite only the contribution of fig .",
    "4(b ) was considered , but the result was normalized to the cdf data @xcite and in this way the major contribution coming from fig .",
    "4(a ) type of diagrams was accounted for . on the other hand",
    ", we do not reproduce the results of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the most prominent characteristic feature of diffractive higgs production is the formation of rapidity gaps between the higgs decay products and the scattered protons .",
    "the gaps will be however of limited use at the lhc collider , when the machine is operated at medium ( @xmath178 ) and high ( @xmath179 ) luminosity , due to pile - up , as discussed in section  3.2 . to select these events in the experiment it is important to tag the scattered protons .",
    "this has furthermore the crucial advantage that the mass of the higgs particle can be precisely reconstructed from the missing mass to the protons , as detailed below . due to the relatively low mass of the central ( higgs ) system ,",
    "the scattered protons have small @xmath180 values , in the range of @xmath181@xmath182 , where @xmath180 is the momentum fraction lost by the proton in the interaction .",
    "a classical technique to detect scattered protons at small @xmath12 and with small relative momentum loss , is by using so - called roman pot detectors . recently",
    "a new type of detectors , called microstations  @xcite , has been proposed for this purpose .",
    "studies of the lhc beam optics  @xcite reveal that , in order to access these small @xmath180 values , the roman pot detectors or microstations need to be installed at about 425  m from the interaction region .",
    "these detectors can have an acceptance in @xmath180 down to 12@xmath183 , and a parametrization of the acceptance was included in the event estimates in this paper .    in order to efficiently record and measure the diffractively scattered protons in roman pot detectors or microstations",
    ", they have to be sufficiently separated from the beam particles .",
    "the detectors , which are located at 420  m and 430  m from the interaction point , could then be used to define the proton momenta by measuring , with respect to the beam axis , the difference in horizontal displacement at the two locations as a function of the average proton deflection .",
    "we observe that a variation of @xmath184 produces a @xmath185 difference in the horizontal displacement of a diffractively scattered proton . with state - of - the - art silicon microstrip detectors this difference",
    "can be measured with a precision of the order of 5@xmath186 m .",
    "the expected momentum spread of the beam protons is @xmath187 . for a symmetric event configuration ( @xmath188 )",
    ", we then expect in the most optimistic case a mass resolution of the order of @xmath189 better than 1%  @xcite .",
    "this leads to the value @xmath190  gev , which is used in table  1 .",
    "the acceptance of diffractively scattered protons is limited by the minimum measurable deflection and , on the other hand , by the aperture of the last dipole magnet ( b11 ) of the lhc lattice , i.e. , 30 mm , and leads to a range of observable missing masses of @xmath191 .",
    "a similar reason restricts the observable rapidity interval of the central produced ( higgs ) system . since we do not measure @xmath180 smaller than 12@xmath192 , we are unable to select events with higgs rapidity @xmath1931.21.6 . as a result ,",
    "the efficiency of proton tagging is 60% for @xmath9  gev . in calculating acceptances , the detector edge effects ( guard ring , shielding , possible insulation layer , etc . )",
    "play a significant role and can be further minimised .",
    "effects due to detector alignment accuracy have still to be assessed carefully .    for selecting the central diffractive events , a sufficient suppression of the huge non - diffractive event rates has to be provided .",
    "an event selection strategy could consist of the following three steps :    * at the first trigger level , select events with a pair of jets in the central detector ( @xmath194 ) each with @xmath195  gev and with the difference between their azimuthal angles @xmath196 ( within a given cell size of @xmath197 ) .",
    "furthermore , one can make use of the absence of significant additional central activity in these events . * at a later stage of data collection , or in off - line analysis , use the forward - backward proton measurement to calculate the missing mass , and * analyse the events of interest by using the central detector data .    with condition  ( i ) , a relative suppression of background to central diffractive events of the order of @xmath109 is obtained .",
    "therefore , a well recordable first level trigger rate may be achieved  @xcite .",
    "pile - up events will also be important for the roman pot detectors .",
    "the pythia  @xcite monte carlo program was used to estimate the probability to have an additional proton accepted on one side of the interaction region from single soft diffraction for the different luminosities , and amounts to 8% ( medium luminosity ) , 40% ( high luminosity ) and 200% ( slhc . ] ) .",
    "hence at the slhc special care is needed to control the combinatorics generated by background from pile - up events .",
    "since by then the mass of the higgs to some accuracy will be known , an appropriate mass window can be chosen to select genuine scattered protons that belong to the diffractive higgs event .",
    "the next issue is the efficiency @xmath198 of tagging a @xmath33 jet .",
    "the value is correlated with the probability @xmath199 to misidentify a gluon as a @xmath33 jet . as we have seen in ( i ) of section  2.4.1 ,",
    "we require @xmath200 to reduce the @xmath115 background to an acceptable level .",
    "for this value of @xmath199 , the present estimate of the efficiency of @xmath33 and @xmath34 tagging is @xmath201 , but it is not inconceivable that this could be improved to a larger value , perhaps as large as @xmath202 . if it turns out that this is impossible for @xmath203 , then it is better to accept a worse misidentification probability @xmath199 in order to obtain a higher value of @xmath204 .",
    "this will raise the background , but will result only in a relatively small reduction in the significance of the signal . for this reason we use @xmath205 in our estimates .",
    "therefore the event rate in ( c ) of table  1 includes a factor 0.6 for the efficiency associated with proton tagging and 0.6 for @xmath33 and @xmath34 tagging . besides this",
    "the signal has been multiplied by 0.5 for the jet polar angle cut and 0.67 for the @xmath0 branching fraction .",
    "hence the original @xmath206 events is reduced to an observable signal of 11 events , as shown in table  1 .",
    "we have seen in section  2 that the selection of events with large rapidity gaps is an effective way of suppressing the qcd background . recall that rapidity gaps appear naturally in weak boson fusion ( wbf ) @xcite .",
    "one can thus exploit this property to suppress the qcd background and to observe a light higgs boson produced by wbf via its main @xmath0 decay mode , in addition to the rather rare decay modes , @xmath207 , @xmath208 , etc .",
    "usually proposed for wbf , see table  1 and refs .",
    "another special feature of higgs production by wbf is the high momentum transfer , @xmath209 .",
    "the hard subprocess may be written as @xmath210 where again a + sign denotes a rapidity gap .",
    "the process is sketched in fig .",
    "two alternative signatures of the wbf @xmath0 events exist .",
    "first , we may select events with large @xmath211 ( quark ) jets in the forward and backward directions , separated from the @xmath0 decay by rapidity gaps .",
    "alternatively we may select events with a high @xmath30 higgs ( or @xmath1 system ) , with rapidity gaps on either side .    in practice",
    "the @xmath0 decay should be observed in the central detector .",
    "we choose the rapidity @xmath212 , and impose the polar angular cut @xmath108 on the @xmath33 and @xmath34 jets ( as discussed in section  2.4 ) .",
    "the accompanying quark jets are observed in the forward and backward calorimeters . for these",
    "we take then we would increase the cross section by only 3% , leaving the signal - to - background ratio essentially unaltered . ]",
    "the results presented in the upper entry of ( f ) in table  1 correspond to the selection of events with @xmath214  gev ( quark ) jets in the forward and backward directions , which are separated from @xmath0 by rapidity gaps . for the alternative signature , shown by the lower entry of ( f ) in table  1",
    ", we impose the cut @xmath215  gev on the @xmath0 system .",
    "the detailed kinematics are described in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the leading order qcd background for process  ( [ eq : qq ] ) , with @xmath0 , is rather large , even after imposing the presence of rapidity gaps and the high @xmath211 ( or @xmath30 ) cuts .",
    "there is , therefore , no need for a detailed discussion of the higher - order background contributions in this case .",
    "although @xmath100 is relatively small , the cross section is considerably larger than for the exclusive process and so the significance of the signal looks good .",
    "in fact in some respects , this signal is similar to the search for the decay @xmath14 in an inclusive process ; compare entries  ( a ) and ( f ) of table  1 .",
    "the main problem is that it is hard to identify rapidity gaps in inclusive reactions at high luminosity , where pile - up becomes significant .",
    "the possibility to identify the vertex of higgs production , and to separate off the particles associated with other interactions , is discussed in section  3.2 .",
    "the survival probability @xmath56 of the rapidity gaps to soft rescattering is an ingredient in the calculation of both the signal and the background of these @xmath216 events .",
    "it is informative to discuss the values of @xmath56 that are obtained .",
    "recall that the survival of the gaps , at the hadronic level , are computed using a two - channel eikonal model for soft rescattering @xcite . for wbf the probability",
    "@xmath56 depends more sensitively on the model than the previous calculation of @xmath56 for @xmath217 of section  2 .",
    "the incoming partons which participate in the wbf subprocess @xmath218 are rather hard .",
    "they have large @xmath112 and a larger scale .",
    "thus in a multi - channel eikonal approach , it is probable that such partons belong to the component with the lower absorptive cross section .",
    "hence the survival probability @xmath56 is larger .",
    "clearly the results will depend on how the partons ( of the global analysis ) are distributed between the different diffractive eigenstates , that is different channels of the eikonal .",
    "here we have used model  ii of ref .",
    "@xcite , which looks the most realistic and which provides a good description of the cdf data for the diffractive production of a pair of high @xmath104 jets .",
    "for the first wbf signature ( upper entry of ( f ) in table  1 ) , the corresponding values of @xmath56 are 0.30 and 0.25 for the signal and background respectively ; whereas for the higgs @xmath215  gev signature ( lower entry ) the values of @xmath56 are 0.26 and 0.21 for the signal and background respectively .    in model",
    "i of ref .",
    "@xcite , which may be regarded as an extreme case , it is assumed that all the valence quarks are concentrated in the eikonal component with the smaller absorption cross section and the gluons in that with the larger cross section . in this case the qcd @xmath1 background , which originates mainly from gluons , has gaps with a smaller survival probability ( @xmath219 for both signatures ( f ) of table  1 ) and the significance of wbf higgs signal would be increased to about @xmath220 .",
    "both the atlas and cms experiments at the lhc prepare to measure jets and energy flows as far out as @xmath221 , matching the cuts in section  3.1 .",
    "hence the forward jets can be tagged and measured . for the trigger",
    "typically four jet final states need to be selected , supplemented with topological requirements , if one wants to go down in jet @xmath104 threshold as much as 30  gev .",
    "when the lhc collider operates at medium and high luminosity , the recorded events will be plagued by overlap interactions in the same bunch crossing . at medium luminosity",
    "( i.e. , @xmath222 ) on average 2.3 inelastic events are expected to be produced in each bunch crossing .",
    "hence the rapidity gaps will often be destroyed by these additional pile - up events .",
    "in particular , for the high luminosity operation ( @xmath223 ) , on average 22 additional events are overlaid on top of the signal event , which will essentially always destroy the gap .",
    "it is , however , possible to use the detector information to try to reconstruct the gap in the hard scattering events .",
    "the vertices of the individual collisions will be ( non - uniformly ) distributed along the beam axis in the interaction region over a distance of 1020  cm .",
    "the precise tracking subdetectors of the experiments will , however , allow the reconstruction of vertex positions with a precision of a few tens of microns , and even soft tracks can be associated to their corresponding vertex with a precision of a fraction of a millimeter .",
    "thus one can imagine an event selection that checks for rapidity gaps based on the charged particles associated with the proper vertex .",
    "furthermore , the transverse energy of particles from the soft overlap events is generally low and , for example , considering only particles with an @xmath104 value larger than of order 12  gev will often reveal the underlying rapidity gap of the hard scattering event .",
    "all rapidity gaps in the events should be detectable by vertex and/or soft energy cuts particularly for the data taken at medium luminosity , and probably also for high luminosity data samples .",
    "however , it is unlikely that these techniques can be used for the slhc type of luminosity of @xmath224 .",
    "as emphasized in the introduction there is no single obvious best discovery channel for a light higgs boson at the lhc .",
    "rather the search should employ all possibilities .",
    "the comparability of channels has some advantages in the measurement of higgs couplings .",
    "the double - diffractive higgs production processes ( entries ( c ) and ( d ) of table  1 ) are mediated by the subprocess @xmath225 , and are thus proportional to the @xmath226@xmath227 coupling ( squared ) . the same is true for production processes ( a ) and ( b ) . for process ( a )",
    "the @xmath14 decay is mainly controlled by the @xmath226@xmath28 coupling , while processes ( b ) and ( c ) are proportional to the @xmath226@xmath1 coupling ( squared ) . from table  1",
    "we note the relatively large significance of the wbf processes , ( e ) and ( f ) , in which the higgs signal is separated from forward and backward high @xmath211 jets by rapidity gaps .",
    "these wbf processes are , of course , driven by the @xmath226@xmath28 coupling .",
    "if the @xmath228 decay process is observed , then we can study the higgs - lepton coupling .",
    "the estimates presented in table  1 for this @xmath229 process are taken from ref .",
    "the values agree reasonably well with the results results in table  1 of @xcite included a 10% efficiency to identify the two @xmath230 leptons .",
    "] shown in table  1 of ref .",
    "thus by measuring combinations of the above processes it is possible to determine the higgs coupling to @xmath33 and @xmath12 quarks , @xmath31 bosons and the @xmath230 lepton .",
    "this paper has concentrated on the production of a light higgs boson accompanied by rapidity gaps . in section  2",
    "we discussed exclusive double - diffractive ( cp - even ) higgs production @xmath231 and in section  3 , weak boson fusion via the subprocess @xmath232 in both cases we estimated the cross section for the @xmath22 signal and for the qcd @xmath1 background , at the lhc .",
    "the results obtained are summarised in entries ( c ) and ( f ) of table  1 .    provided that appropriate proton taggers are installed ( see section  2.6 ) , process ( [ eq : pp ] ) has the special advantage that the higgs can be identified by a sharp peak in the protons ` missing mass ' spectrum and , simultaneously , as a peak in the @xmath1 mass spectrum .",
    "the required equality @xmath131 , allowing for resolution , is of great value , not only to establish the signal , but also to suppress the @xmath233 background .",
    "in addition , the existence of a @xmath24 selection rule automatically greatly suppresses the leading order ( lo ) qcd @xmath1 background .",
    "we estimated the lo , nlo and nnlo contributions to the @xmath233 background .",
    "it turned out that , for production from a colour - singlet two - gluon system , the special colour and helicity structure of the subprocess is such that even the higher order ( nlo , ... ) contributions to the background are suppressed . in summary , we find factor ) as the signal . ]",
    "@xmath234 for the exclusive double - diffractive production of a light higgs boson , decaying via @xmath1 , at the lhc .",
    "the favourable signal - to - background ratio is offset by a low event rate , caused by the necessity to preserve the rapidity gaps so as to ensure an exclusive signal .",
    "nevertheless , entry  ( c ) of table  1 shows that the signal has comparable significance signal and background are included , the significance of this signal is increased to about @xmath15 for 30  fb@xmath10 lhc luminosity and higgs mass @xmath235  @xcite . ] to the standard @xmath14 and @xmath236 search modes ( entries  ( a ) and ( b ) ) .",
    "the cross section for the production of a 120  gev higgs boson at the lhc , via the exclusive @xmath25 process , was calculated to be 3  fb ( see section  2.1 ) , but after including the @xmath0 branching fraction , and the acceptance and efficiency cuts , we arrive at only 12% of the signal",
    ". the breakdown of the depletion of the signal is summarized at the end of section  2.6 .",
    "thus for an integrated luminosity of 30  fb@xmath10 ( 300  fb@xmath10 ) we would register 11 ( 110 ) events .",
    "noting the @xmath85 ratio of ( [ eq : stob4 ] ) , we see that these signals have a significance of about @xmath237 and @xmath238 respectively .",
    "we estimate a factor of two uncertainty in the cross section for this exclusive higgs signal ( see section  2.2 ) , but a much better reliability for the signal - to - background prediction , ( [ eq : stob4 ] ) , since the main theoretical uncertainties cancel in the ratio ( see section  2.3 ) .    the weak boson fusion signal , ( [ eq : qqconclusion ] ) , does not need the installation of proton taggers , and has a favourable significance ; see section  3 and table  1 . as discussed in section  3.2 ,",
    "the main problem is to identify these rapidity gap events from the additional pile - up events , that is from overlap interactions in the same bunch crossing .",
    "there is good reason to believe that , at the medium luminosity of @xmath222 of the lhc , the problem can be overcome , and that we can go a considerable way to achieving the numbers quoted in entry  ( f ) of table  1 .    in conclusion ,",
