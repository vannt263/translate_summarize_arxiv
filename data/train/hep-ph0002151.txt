    "after the recent discovery of neutrino oscillations by the superkamiokande experiment  @xcite , supersymmetric ( susy ) models with left - right symmetric gauge groups have attracted a great deal of attention .",
    "these models provide a natural framework for implementing the seesaw mechanism  @xcite which explains the existence of the small neutrino masses .",
    "the implications of these models have been considered in ref.@xcite , in the case of the gauge group @xmath15 , and in ref.@xcite for the susy pati - salam ( ps )  @xcite model based on the gauge group @xmath16 .",
    "it was shown that they lead to a constraint version of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "0.25 cm recently , it was demonstrated  @xcite that the n=1 susy ps model can emerge as the effective four dimensional limit of brane models from type i string theory .",
    "this result provides further motivation for considering the phenomenological and cosmological implications of this model . also , it is know  @xcite that the gauge symmetry @xmath1 can arise from the weakly coupled heterotic string as well .",
    "0.25 cm hybrid inflation  @xcite has been extensively studied  @xcite in the case of the susy model based on the gauge group @xmath17 .",
    "however , in trying to extend this scheme to @xmath1 , we encounter the following difficulty .",
    "the spontaneous symmetry breaking of @xmath1 to the standard model gauge group @xmath18 leads to the existence of topologically stable magnetic monopole solutions .",
    "this is due to the fact that the second homotopy group of the vacuum manifold @xmath19 is non - trivial and equal to the set of integers @xmath20 .",
    "these monopoles carry two units of dirac magnetic charge  @xcite .",
    "inflation is terminated abruptly when the system reaches a critical point ( instability ) on the inflationary trajectory and is followed by a ` waterfall ' regime during which the spontaneous breaking of @xmath1 occurs .",
    "the appropriate higgs fields develop their non - zero vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) starting from zero and they can end up at any point of the vacuum manifold with equal probability . as a consequence ,",
    "magnetic monopoles are copiously produced  @xcite by the kibble mechanism  @xcite leading to a cosmological disaster .",
    "0.25 cm in this paper , we propose a specific susy model based on @xmath1 which avoids this cosmological catastrophe .",
    "this is achieved by including a non - renormalizable term in the part of the superpotential involving the inflaton system and causing the breaking of @xmath1 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that an analogous non - renormalizable term was also used in ref.@xcite for the same purpose . in that case , however , the leading renormalizable term was eliminated by imposing a discrete symmetry .",
    "here , we keep this leading term along with the non - renormalizable contribution .",
    "the picture that emerges turns out to be considerably different .",
    "in particular , there exists a non - trivial ( classically ) flat direction along which @xmath1 is spontaneously broken with the appropriate higgs fields acquiring constant values .",
    "this direction can be used as inflationary trajectory with the necessary inclination obtained from one - loop radiative corrections  @xcite in contrast to the model of ref.@xcite , where a classical inclination was present .",
    "another difference is that here the termination of inflation is abrupt ( as in the original hybrid inflationary scenario ) and not smooth as in ref.@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , no magnetic monopoles are formed in this transition since @xmath1 is already broken during inflation .",
    "0.25 cm    we show that , for a certain range of parameters , the system always passes from the above mentioned inflationary trajectory before falling into the susy vacuum .",
    "thus , the magnetic monopole problem is solved for all initial conditions .",
    "it is interesting to note that the idea of breaking the gauge symmetry before ( or during ) inflation in order to avoid monopoles was also employed in ref.@xcite .",
    "however , the monopole problem was solved only for a certain ( wide ) class of initial values of the fields .",
    "0.25 cm    the constraints on the quadrupole anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background radiation from the cosmic background explorer ( cobe )  @xcite measurements can be easily met with natural values ( of order @xmath2 ) of the relevant coupling constant and a grand unification theory ( gut ) scale @xmath21 close to ( or somewhat smaller than ) the susy gut scale . note that the mass scale in the model of ref.@xcite , which uses only renormalizable couplings in the inflationary superpotential , is considerably smaller .",
    "our model possesses a number of other interesting features too .",
    "the @xmath5-problem of mssm is solved  @xcite via a peccei - quinn ( pq ) symmetry which also solves the strong cp problem .",
    "although the baryon ( @xmath22 ) and lepton ( @xmath23 ) numbers are explicitly violated , the proton life time is considerably higher than the present experimental limits .",
    "light neutrinos acquire masses by the seesaw mechanism and the baryon asymmetry of the universe can be generated through a primordial leptogenesis  @xcite .",
    "the gravitino constraint  @xcite on the reheat temperature , the low deuterium abundance limits  @xcite on the baryon asymmetry of the universe and the requirement of almost maximal @xmath6 mixing from superkamiokande  @xcite can be met for @xmath5- and @xmath24-neutrino masses restricted by superkamiokande and the large angle msw solution of the solar neutrino puzzle respectively .",
    "the required values of the relevant coupling constants are more or less natural .",
    "0.25 cm the plan of the paper is as follows . in sec.2",
    ", we introduce our susy model which is based on the gauge group @xmath1 and motivate the inclusion of a non - renormalizable coupling in the inflaton sector of the theory .",
    "the full superpotential and its global symmetries are then discussed together with the solution of the @xmath5-problem via the pq symmetry of the model . in sec.3 ,",
    "the hybrid inflationary scenario is studied in detail in this model .",
    "the structure of the potential is carefully analyzed .",
    "we calculate the one - loop radiative corrections along the inflationary trajectory by first deriving ( see appendix ) the mass spectrum of the theory during inflation .",
    "the parameters of the model are then restricted by employing cobe results . in sec.4",
    ", we discuss the reheating process following inflation , neutrino masses and mixing and baryogenesis via leptogenesis .",
    "we show that all the relevant constraints can be satisfied with natural values of the coupling constants .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in sec.5 .",
    "in the susy ps model , the left - handed quark and lepton superfields are accommodated in the following representations : @xmath26 where the subscript @xmath27 denotes the family index  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 gauge symmetry can be spontaneously broken to @xmath18 by a pair of higgs superfields @xmath28 acquiring non - vanishing vevs in the right - handed neutrino direction , @xmath29 , @xmath30 . 0.25 cm    the two low energy higgs doublets of the mssm are contained in the following representation : @xmath31 after @xmath1 breaking , the bidoublet higgs field @xmath32 splits into two higgs doublets @xmath33 , @xmath34 , whose neutral components subsequently develop weak vevs @xmath35 and @xmath36 with @xmath37",
    ". 0.25 cm    the breaking of @xmath1 can be achieved by introducing a gauge singlet superfield @xmath38 , which has a trilinear ( renormalizable ) coupling to @xmath39 , @xmath40 .",
    "the resulting scalar potential automatically possesses an in - built ( classically ) flat direction along which inflation can take place  @xcite with the system driven by an inclination from one - loop radiative corrections  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 gauge symmetry is restored along this trajectory and breaks spontaneously only at the end of inflation when the system falls towards the susy vacua .",
    "this transition leads to a cosmologically unacceptable copious production of doubly charged magnetic monopoles  @xcite .",
    "one way to resolve this problem is to use , for inflation , another flat direction in which @xmath1 is already broken .",
    "such a trajectory naturally appears if we include the next order non - renormalizable superpotential coupling of @xmath38 to @xmath39 , @xmath40 too .",
    "we find that , together with the usual flat direction with unbroken @xmath1 , an extra flat trajectory along which @xmath1 is spontaneously broken to @xmath18 emerges .",
    "the termination of inflation can then take place with @xmath1 already broken and no monopoles being produced .",
    "0.25 cm    an important issue is the generation of the @xmath5-term of mssm .",
    "this could be easily achieved  @xcite by coupling @xmath38 to the electroweak higgs superfields and using the fact that @xmath38 , after gravity - mediated susy breaking , develops a vev . however , this is not totally satisfactory since the inflaton decays into electroweak higgs superfields via an unsuppressed ( renormalizable ) coupling . as a consequence , the gravitino constraint  @xcite on the reheat temperature implies  @xcite unnaturally small values for the relevant coupling constants ( of order @xmath41 or so ) .",
    "we thus prefer to follow here ref.@xcite and impose a pq symmetry on the superpotential by introducing a pair of gauge singlet superfields @xmath42 , @xmath43 .",
    "the pq breaking occurs at an intermediate scale by the vevs of @xmath42 , @xmath43 and the @xmath5-term is generated via a non - renormalizable coupling of @xmath42 and @xmath32 .",
    "the inflaton can be made to decay into right - handed neutrinos by introducing into the scheme quartic ( non - renormalizable ) superpotential couplings of @xmath40 to @xmath44 and the gravitino constraint can be satisfied with more natural values of the parameters .",
    "it should be noted that the presence of these quartic terms is anyway necessary for generating intermediate scale masses for the right - handed neutrinos and , thus , masses for the light neutrinos via the seesaw mechanism .",
    "finally , in order to give superheavy masses to @xmath45 and @xmath46 , we introduce  @xcite an @xmath9 6-plet superfield @xmath47 which , under @xmath18 , splits into @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "0.25 cm    the superpotential of the model , which incorporates all the above couplings , is @xmath50 where @xmath51 gev is a superheavy string scale .",
    "also , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 can be made positive by field redefinitions , while @xmath58 is chosen positive for simplicity ( it could be genuinely complex ) . here , we are in the basis where @xmath59 s are diagonal .",
    "0.25 cm    note that the existence of the third ( non - renormalizable ) coupling in the right hand side of eq.([eq : superpot ] ) is an automatic consequence of the first two couplings which constitute the standard superpotential for hybrid inflation .",
    "indeed , the operator @xmath60 is neutral under all the r and non - r symmetries of this standard superpotential and , thus , the above coupling , which is crucial for our inflationary scheme , can not be forbidden .",
    "our only assumption is then that the dimensionless coefficient @xmath58 of this non - renormalizable coupling is of order unity so that it can be comparable to the trilinear coupling in the standard superpotential whose coefficient @xmath53 is typically relatively small ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "this non - renormalizable coupling can then play an important role in the inflationary scenario .",
    "the non - renormalizable couplings @xmath62 with @xmath63 are also allowed .",
    "they are , however , subdominant to the leading non - renormalizable coupling ( with @xmath64 ) in the relevant region of the field space even if their coefficients are of order one . the r symmetry ( see below ) of the standard superpotential , extended to higher orders , is needed for avoiding terms non - linear in @xmath38 which can destroy inflation .",
    "the couplings , then , permitted between @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 are the ones already mentioned modulo arbitrary multiplications by @xmath65 , @xmath66 .",
    "the new couplings do not affect the potential for inflation .",
    "0.25 cm    in addition to @xmath1 , the superpotential in eq.([eq : superpot ] ) possesses two global anomalous symmetries , a r symmetry @xmath67 and a pq symmetry @xmath68 .",
    "the r and pq charges of the superfields are assigned as follows : @xmath69 to avoid undesirable mixing of @xmath70 and @xmath32 or @xmath71 and @xmath39 , we also impose a discrete @xmath72 symmetry ( know as ` matter parity ' ) , under which @xmath70 and @xmath71 change sign",
    ". 0.25 cm    additional superpotential terms allowed by the symmetries of the model are @xmath73 modulo arbitrary multiplications by non - negative powers of the combinations @xmath74 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 ( this applies to the terms in eq.([eq : superpot ] ) too ) .",
    "note that the @xmath9 indices in all couplings except the last three in eq.([terms ] ) and the combinations @xmath65 , @xmath66 are contracted between @xmath75 s and @xmath76 s , while in these terms and combinations the four @xmath9 indices of the @xmath75 s or @xmath76 s are contracted with an @xmath77 .",
    "the soft susy breaking and instanton effects explicitly break @xmath67 to @xmath78 , under which @xmath79 , and @xmath68 to @xmath80 .",
    "these two discrete symmetries are spontaneously broken by the vevs of @xmath81 and would create a domain wall problem if the pq transition took place after inflation . when @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 acquire non - vanishing vevs , the symmetry which is left unbroken is @xmath82 .",
    "0.25 cm    we can assign baryon number @xmath83 to all color triplets ( antitriplets ) . recall that there are ( anti)triplets not only in @xmath84 but also in @xmath85 .",
    "lepton number is then defined via @xmath86 .",
    "@xmath22 ( and @xmath23 ) violation comes from the last three terms in eq.([terms ] ) ( and the combinations @xmath65 , @xmath66 ) which give couplings like @xmath87 ,  @xmath88 with appropriate coefficients . also , the terms @xmath89 and @xmath90 give rise to the @xmath22 ( and @xmath23 ) violating couplings @xmath91 ,  @xmath92 .",
    "all other combinations are @xmath22 ( and @xmath23 ) conserving since @xmath75 s are contracted with @xmath76 s .",
    "0.25 cm    the dominant contribution to proton decay comes from effective dimension five operators generated by one - loop diagrams with two of the @xmath93 , @xmath45 or one of the @xmath93 , @xmath45 and one of the @xmath94 , @xmath95 circulating in the loop .",
    "the amplitudes corresponding to these operators are estimated to be at most of order @xmath96 ( @xmath97 is the gravitino mass ) .",
    "this makes the proton practically stable .",
    "furthermore , the dominant contribution to the majorana mass term of light neutrinos comes from @xmath98 and is utterly small .",
    "so the seesaw mechanism is the only source of light neutrino masses .",
    "0.25 cm    the @xmath5-term is generated , as mentioned , by a non - renormalizable superpotential coupling which contains the electroweak higgs and the @xmath42 superfield after the breaking of @xmath68 by @xmath99 , @xmath100 .",
    "the relevant part of the scalar potential for the pq breaking is given by  @xcite @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the dimensionless coefficient of the soft susy breaking term corresponding to the @xmath103 term in eq.([eq : superpot ] ) . here , the phases @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 of @xmath102 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are taken to satisfy the relation @xmath107 and @xmath108 , @xmath109 are assumed equal which minimizes the potential . for @xmath110 ,",
    "the absolute minimum of this potential is given by  @xcite @xmath111 hence the pq symmetry breaking scale is of order @xmath112 gev and the @xmath5-term of the mssm is @xmath113 as desired .",
    "0.25 cm    note that the zero temperature pq potential ( in eq.([potn0 ] ) ) , shown in fig.1 , possesses two local minima , the trivial one at @xmath114 and the pq minimum which , for @xmath115 , is the absolute minimum .",
    "these minima are separated by a sizable potential barrier which prevents a successful transition from the trivial to the pq vacuum .",
    "taking the one - loop temperature corrections  @xcite to the potential into account , one can show that the pq vacuum remains the absolute minimum at least for temperatures below the reheat temperature @xmath116 gev .",
    "the trivial vacuum is still protected by a potential barrier .",
    "we , thus , conclude that if , after inflation , the system emerges in the trivial vacuum the completion of the pq transition will be practically impossible .",
    "we are obliged to assume that the pq symmetry is already broken before or during inflation .",
    "the pq vacuum then remains stable after inflation and reheating .",
    "there is yet another reason which disfavors a pq transition after inflation .",
    "the vevs of @xmath42 , @xmath117 break spontaneously the @xmath78 symmetry ( @xmath79 ) and the @xmath80 subgroup of @xmath68 which is left unbroken by instantons .",

    "0.25 cm    in concluding this section , we emphasize that the extra couplings which we incorporated into our basic inflationary superpotential ( see eq.([eq : superpot ] ) ) are simple , quite general , and well - motivated . in particular , the couplings @xmath118 , @xmath119 were included in order to solve the @xmath5-problem .",
    "however , they also provide a solution to the strong cp problem .",
    "moreover , the presence of @xmath120 is necessary for the generation of the right - handed neutrino masses .",
    "it is an extra benefit , though , that , via these same couplings , the inflaton decays to right - handed neutrinos , thereby leading to a successful and ` natural ' ( no tiny couplings ) reheating of the universe with the observed baryon asymmetry generated via leptogenesis ( see below ) .",
    "finally , @xmath89 , @xmath121 were added for merely giving superheavy masses to @xmath45 , @xmath46 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the emerging theory is ` natural ' in the sense that all couplings which are consistent with a simple and general set of global symmetries ( @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath72 ) can be allowed without jeopardizing our inflationary scenario or leading into trouble with other requirements such as proton stability .",
    "the part of the superpotential in eq.([eq : superpot ] ) which is relevant for inflation is given by @xmath122 where @xmath52 is a superheavy mass scale close to the gut scale .",
    "note that the rest of the superpotential in eq.([eq : superpot ] ) does not affect the inflationary dynamics . the scalar potential obtained from @xmath123 is given by @xmath124 where the scalar components of the superfields are denoted by the same symbols as the corresponding superfields .",

    "( recall that this correction is naturally present as we explained . )",
    "it is , thus , interesting to study in some detail the structure of this potential and the new inflationary possibilities which typically emerge .",

    "the potential at @xmath140 is @xmath147 , while at @xmath138 is @xmath148 .",

    "note , however , that @xmath155 does not necessarily guarantee the presence of these extrema .",
    "this requires that , in addition , the right hand side of eq.([y3 ] ) is non - negative .",

    "it is interesting to point out that , at @xmath170 , above which the extremum at @xmath140 turns into a local minimum , @xmath171 coincides with @xmath140 .",

    "( the peak of this barrier coincides with the maximum at @xmath171 . ) as a consequence , the rate per unit volume and time of forming bubbles of the @xmath174 minimum ceases to be exponentially suppressed .",
    "an order of magnitude estimate then shows that the decay of the false vacuum at @xmath140 to the minimum at @xmath174 is completed within a fraction of one e - folding .",
    "this happens before the appearance of the minimum at @xmath171 , i.e. , before the system reaches the critical point at @xmath200 ( but very close to this point ) .",
    "moreover , in the last stages of inflation , the above barrier is small enough to be overcome by the inflationary density perturbations .",
    "this can also accelerate the completion of this transition .",
    "0.25 cm    to avoid confusion we should mention here that @xmath201 is not an extra free parameter .",
    "it depends on the coupling @xmath53 and the superheavy mass scale @xmath52 ( we put @xmath202 ) .",
    "the values of @xmath53 and @xmath52 will be related by calculating the quadrupole anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background radiation @xmath203 as a function of the number of e - foldings of our present horizon @xmath204 and compare it with the measurements of cobe  @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath201 then becomes a function of the basic coupling constant of the scheme @xmath53 .",
    "so , searching for solutions with @xmath201 in the desirable range and also satisfying all the other requirements which we will discuss below is a highly non - trivial task .",

    "it should be pointed out that , for this success of our model , no extra structure was needed to be added to it .",
    "actually , the possibility of accounting for these requirements is more or less automatic in this inflationary scheme and can , in principle , remain in gauge groups other than @xmath1 too .",
    "we have constructed a susy gut model based on the @xmath1 gauge symmetry group .",
    "this model is consistent with all particle physics and cosmological requirements .",
    "the @xmath5-problem is solved by introducing a global anomalous pq symmetry @xmath68 , which also solves the strong cp problem .",

    "the superpotential involves only renormalizable couplings of the gut higgs superfields and a gauge singlet .",
    "we have modified this picture by including the next order non - renormalizable coupling too .",
    "in contrast to the usual case , inflation now takes place along a classically flat direction where the gauge symmetry ( @xmath1 ) is spontaneously broken to @xmath18 . as a consequence , after inflation ends , there is absolutely no production of doubly charged magnetic monopoles , which are associated with the breaking of @xmath1 .",
    "thus , the cosmological catastrophe one would encounter by employing the usual inflationary scheme in the susy ps theory is avoided .",
    "our mechanism is crucial for the viability of any model containing cosmologically disastrous topological defects such as magnetic monopoles or domain walls and leads to complete absence of such objects .",
    "it is interesting to point out that , although the usual trajectory with unbroken @xmath1 also exists , there is a range of parameters for which the system finally inflates along the non - trivial path before falling into the susy vacua .",

    "the measurements of cobe can be easily reproduced with natural values ( of order @xmath2 ) of the relevant coupling constant .",
    "the gut mass scale comes out equal to ( or somewhat smaller than ) the susy gut scale and can certainly be much closer to it than in the standard susy inflationary scheme .",

    "we require that the so obtained baryon asymmetry of the universe is consistent with the low deuterium abundance constraint .",
    "we also take almost maximal @xmath6 mixing as indicated by superkamiokande . the @xmath5- and @xmath24-neutrino masses",

    "we find that all these requirements can be met with natural values ( of order @xmath2 ) of the relevant coupling constant .",
    "note that the second heaviest dirac neutrino mass turns out to be of order @xmath179 gev and masses of @xmath314 consistent with the large rather than the small angle msw mechanism are favored . 0.25 cm    finally , we would like to point out that , although we restricted our discussion to the ps gauge group , this new susy hybrid inflationary scenario is of much wider applicability .",
    "the reason for choosing this particular framework for our presentation is that @xmath1 is one of the simplest gauge groups with magnetic monopoles .",
    "the scenario can be readily extended to other semi - simple gauge groups such as the trinification group @xmath315 which emerges from string theory .",
    "of course , the superfields @xmath39 and @xmath40 should be replaced by the appropriate pair of superfields @xmath316 and @xmath317 from the @xmath318 @xmath319-plet and @xmath320-plet which cause the breaking of the trinification group to @xmath17 . further breaking of @xmath17 to @xmath18",

    "<S> we show how hybrid inflation can be successfully realized in a supersymmetric model with gauge group @xmath0 . by including a non - renormalizable superpotential term , we generate an inflationary valley along which @xmath1 is broken to the standard model gauge group . </S>",
    "<S> thus , catastrophic production of the doubly charged magnetic monopoles , which are predicted by the model , can not occur at the end of inflation . </S>",
    "<S> the results of the cosmic background explorer can be reproduced with natural values ( of order @xmath2 ) of the relevant coupling constant , and symmetry breaking scale of @xmath1 of the order of @xmath3 gev . </S>",
