    "the bosonic hubbard model ( bhm ) has continued to attract interest since its introduction by fisher _",
    "this interest stems from its use to understand many physical phenomena such as the effect of disorder on superfluids and the appearance of the compressible bose glass phase  @xcite , quantum phase transitions between strongly correlated exotic phases _",
    "etc_. interest in the bhm intensified with the experimental realization of bose - einstein condensates and the ability to load them in optical lattices  @xcite . under experimentally realizable conditions ,",
    "these systems are described by the bhm and its extensions  @xcite with highly tunable parameters and in one , two and three dimensions which makes them ideal for studying quantum phase transitions and exotic phases in strongly correlated systems .    increasingly , over the last several years , the physics of strongly correlated quantum systems has focused on the existence and properties of unconventional phases and phase transitions .",
    "in addition to well studied mott insulating behavior caused by strong on - site repulsion at commensurate filling , extensive quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations have shown that a strong enough near neighbor repulsion can lead to insulating incompressible density wave order ( cdw ) at integer and half odd integer fillings .",
    "topological phases , such as the haldane insulator which is a gapped phase characterized by a non - local ( string ) order parameter  @xcite can be also found in the extended bhm  @xcite in one dimension . finally , doping these phases can lead to phase separation or to supersolid ( ss ) phases  @xcite .",
    "even though the phase diagram of the extended bhm is now well understood , the excitation spectra of the various ground states have been less studied  @xcite , essentially because the numerical methods providing the ground state properties , such as exact diagonalization or qmc , become limited in the dynamical domain .",
    "more recently , for quasi-1d systems , the extension of the density matrix renormalization group method ( dmrg ) to the time domain or , equivalently , the time evolving density matrix method ( tebd ) have proved to be extremely successful in probing the dynamical properties of the system , thereby providing reliable excitation spectrum  @xcite . in this paper , we extend our work in  @xcite to study the excitation spectrum of the one dimensional extended bhm in different phases , namely the mott insulating phase ( mi ) , the haldane insulating phase ( hi ) , the charge density wave phase ( cdw ) and the supersolid phase ( ss ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : model ]",
    "we present the model and the various methods to compute the ground state properties and excitation spectrum . in section  [ sec : mihicdw ] , we present the dependence of the dynamical structure factor on the near neighbor repulsion , @xmath1 , at fixed filling , @xmath4 , and fixed value of the contact repulsion , @xmath0 and hopping , @xmath5 . in section  [ sec : supersolid ] , we study the dynamical structure factor in the ss phase for different fillings and explain its main properties using a mapping of the extended bhm to the heisenberg model for a spin 1/2 chain in a finite magnetic field . in addition , we describe the evolution of the spectrum across the ss - sf transition . in section  [ sec : undercdw ] , we discuss the qualitative differences found in the dynamical structure factor in the phase which is obtained by underdoping the half - filled cdw and in the ss phase .",
    "a summary of results and conclusions is in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the one dimensional extended bhm we shall study is described by the hamiltonian , @xmath6 the sum over @xmath7 extends over the @xmath8 sites of the lattice , periodic boundary conditions were used in the qmc simulations  @xcite and open conditions in the dmrg and the tebd simulations .",
    "the onsite repulsive interaction energy , @xmath0 , is put equal to unity and sets the energy scale .",
    "the time scale being given by @xmath9 , it is also put equal to unity . the operator @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) destroys ( creates ) a boson on site @xmath7 , @xmath12 is the number operator on site @xmath7 , @xmath5 is the hopping amplitude and @xmath1 is the near neighbor repulsive interaction parameter .",
    "since we will typically study the system in the canonical ensemble , we did not include a chemical potential term in @xmath13 .",
    "the charge gap is given by , @xmath14 where the chemical potential is given by @xmath15 and @xmath16 is the ground state energy of the system with @xmath17 particles and is obtained both with qmc and dmrg .",
    "the neutral gap , @xmath18 , is obtained using dmrg by targeting the lowest excitation with the same number of bosons . for the cdw and hi phases ,",
    "the chemical potentials at both ends are set to ( opposite ) large enough values , when using dmrg , such that the ground state degeneracy and the low energy edge excitations are lifted  @xcite .    for a bosonic filling @xmath19 close to unity ,",
    "the bose - hubbard model can be reasonably approximated by the af spin-1 heisenberg model : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the axial anisotropy and @xmath22 the ion anisotropy .",
    "one has the following mapping between the parameters  @xcite : @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "as mentioned above , the excitation spectra are obtained using the tebd , first in imaginary time to obtain the ground state , then in real time to compute the density - density correlation function . in each case , we have used a number preserving algorithm .",
    "we have checked that the ground state properties ( energy , site density , double occupancy ... ) obtained with the tebd exactly match the properties of the ground state obtained from the dmrg , using the alps library  @xcite .",
    "the space and time correlation functions @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the ground state average and where @xmath28 is the time evolution of the operator @xmath29 in the heisenberg picture , have been obtained by writing , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the ground state energy .",
    "therefore , computing the correlation function can be done as follows :    * from the matrix product state ( mps ) representation of the ground state , @xmath32 , one computes the mps of the initial state @xmath33 . * the state @xmath34 is evolved using the real time tebd , providing the mps of @xmath35 , and thereby allowing the computation of the correlation function as @xmath36 .    in",
    "what follows , we focus on the density - density correlation , i.e. @xmath37 , more precisely , the initial state consists of creating a density excitation in the middle of the chain : @xmath38 with @xmath39 .",
    "we then compute @xmath26 for all sites and times @xmath40 up to @xmath41 , with a time step equal to @xmath42 ( a smaller timestep was actually used for the propagation ) .",
    "finally , the dynamical structure factor @xmath43 is computed from the fourier transform of the density - density correlation with respect to @xmath44 and @xmath40 . in order to smooth out oscillations caused by the finite time window",
    ", we actually compute the fourier transform of @xmath45 .",
    "the qualitative description of the different phases is based on the heisenberg model eq .. more precisely , the phases are characterized by the values of the string order parameters : @xmath46 characterizing a loose antiferromagnetic order along the different axes @xmath47 .",
    "they are associated with an underlying non - local discrete @xmath48 symmetry of the heisenberg model , eq .",
    "@xcite . in the large-@xmath22 phase ( the mi state for bosons ) , the @xmath49 vanish . in the haldane phase ,",
    "the two discrete @xmath50 symmetries are broken , resulting in nonvanishing string order @xmath49 . finally , in the ising phase ( the cdw for bosons )",
    ", only the @xmath50 symmetry along the @xmath51-axis is broken such that only the string order @xmath52 is non - vanishing .",
    "note that in that phase , the string order and the antiferromagnetic order ( the cdw order for bosons ) are equivalent  @xcite .",
    "the lowest elementary excitations from the ground state ( @xmath53 , @xmath54 ) are part of a triplet , one neutral @xmath55 ( @xmath56 , ) , two charge ones @xmath57 ( @xmath58 )  @xcite , where @xmath59 corresponds to change in the total number of bosons . in each sector",
    ", one defines a gap which corresponds to the minimum of the elementary excitations over all @xmath3 values : @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "the minima are located either at @xmath53 or @xmath62 . from linear response theory",
    ", the structure factor reads @xmath63 where @xmath64 denotes the different excited states of @xmath13 for a given momentum @xmath3 , and @xmath65 the corresponding energy . for single excitations ,",
    "one simply has @xmath66 .",
    "doubly excited states for fixed @xmath3 are made of two single excitations : @xmath67 , corresponding to an energy @xmath68 .    by definition ,",
    "the charge gap of the system is @xmath69 , i.e. the minimum energy for adding a particle plus the minimum energy for removing a particle ( increasing or decreasing @xmath70 , in the heisenberg model ) .",
    "the neutral gap corresponds to the minimum of either the elementary neutral excitations , i.e. @xmath60 , or of @xmath71 , i.e. , a combination of two charge excitations . since",
    ", the minimum of both the elementary charge excitation @xmath72 is attained at either @xmath73 or @xmath74 , the minimum of the two - particle excitation necessarily takes place at @xmath2 and has the value @xmath75 , and corresponds then to the lower bound of a two - particle continuum . in short , the neutral gap value is given by the minimum of @xmath60 and @xmath75 .",
    "mott - haldane - cdw transitions at fixed @xmath76 . around @xmath77 , the neutral and charge gaps start to differ , indicating that @xmath78 : the gap for the single particle neutral excitations is smaller than the gap for the two particle excitations .",
    "the fact that only the neutral gap vanishes at the hi - cdw transition is a signature that the string order @xmath52 along the @xmath51-axis remains finite , where @xmath79 and @xmath80 orders vanish . , width=302 ]    it is well - known that in the haldane phase , the neutral gap changes from one type to the other  @xcite and is emphasized in fig .",
    "[ mhc ] , where around @xmath77 , the neutral and the charge gaps start having different values . for lower @xmath1 values , one has @xmath81 , whereas for larger @xmath1 values , one has @xmath82 .",
    "this results from the fact that , in the haldane phase , the elementary excitations are all gapped , with a minimum occuring at @xmath62  @xcite . for a fixed value of @xmath0 , corresponding to a fixed value of the ion anisotropy , @xmath22 , in the corresponding spin hamiltonian , @xmath61 increases with increasing @xmath1 ( i.e. @xmath21 ) , whereas @xmath60 decreases . this can be understood by starting at the heisenberg point , ( @xmath83 , @xmath84 ) , where , due to @xmath85 invariance of the spin hamiltonian , all single particle excitation energies are the same , so that @xmath86 . increasing the ion anisotropy , @xmath22 , i.e. going toward the mott phase ( or decreasing @xmath21 ) gives rise to a smaller in - plane gap ( i.e. the elementary charge gap ) @xmath87 .",
    "this evolution of the neutral and charge gaps can be seen in the behavior of the structure factor @xmath43 .",
    "we emphasize that even though the structure factor @xmath43 is a neutral excitation , i.e. conserves the total number of bosons , it also couples to the two - particle continuum composed of elementary charge excitations @xmath71 .",
    "as explained above , in the limit @xmath88 , the minimum energy corresponds to the charge gap @xmath89 , such that even if we expect @xmath43 to vanish at @xmath53 , the value for @xmath90 can be obtained by extrapolating the behavior of @xmath43 around @xmath53 .    in the mott phase , top fig .",
    "[ mi ] , one can clearly see that the gap at @xmath62 is much larger than the gap at @xmath53 .",
