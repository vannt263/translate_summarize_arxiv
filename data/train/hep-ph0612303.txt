    "chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath2pt ) provides a systematic field - theoretic framework for the description of the low - energy strong interaction .",
    "the fundamental degrees of freedom in @xmath2pt are therefore the low - energy hadron excitations , such as the goldstone bosons ( gbs ) of chiral symmetry breaking , nucleons and a few others .",
    "the corresponding hadron fields appear in the effective lagrangian which can be organized in powers of derivatives of the gb fields , or schematically as : ( , n ,  )",
    "= _ n l^(n)= _",
    "n o_n(c_i ) where @xmath3 are some field operators which may contain gb fields but not their derivatives .",
    "the all - possible field operators , constrained by chiral and other symmetries , appear with the free parameters , @xmath4 , the so - called low energy constants ( lecs ) .",
    "the mass scale @xmath5 is the heavy scale which sets the upper limit of applicability of @xmath2pt and is believed to be of order of @xmath6 gev  the scale of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking that led to the appearance of the gbs .",
    "this expansion of the lagrangian translates into a low - energy expansion of the @xmath7-matrix , schematically : s = _",
    "n a_n ( c_i ) where @xmath8 s are amplitudes which depend on lecs , and @xmath9 denotes the momentum of the gbs .",
    "the anzatz@xcite is that the same expansion can ( one day ) be obtained directly from qcd , provided the lecs are matched onto the qcd parameter : @xmath10 . in the absence of the correspondent calculation in qcd , the best one can do is to match ( or , fit ) the lecs to experimental data , making sure that they take reasonable ( or , natural ) values such that the above expansion is convergent .    one case where the convergence of the @xmath2pt expansion is immediately questioned is the case of hadronic bound states and resonances . in the presence of a bound state or a resonance the low - energy expansion of the @xmath7-matrix goes as s ~_n a_n ( ) ^n , where @xmath11 is the excitation ( binding ) energy of the resonance ( bound state ) .",
    "thus , the limit of applicability of @xmath2pt is limited not by @xmath12 gev but by the characteristic energy scale @xmath13 of the closest bound or excited state .",
    "furthermore , in the vicinity of a bound state or a resonance the @xmath7-matrix has a pole , which can not be reproduced in a purely perturbative expansion in energy that is utilized in @xmath2pt .",
    "this problem arises in various contexts , ranging from pion - pion scattering@xcite to halo nuclei@xcite .",
    "some are being discussed at this meeting ( e.g. , resonances in the @xmath14 system@xcite , or bound states and resonances in the few - nucleon system@xcite ) . in this contribution",
    "i focus on the @xmath15 system where the first resonance is the @xmath16 .",
    "the @xmath17 resonance is an ideal study case for the problem of resonances in @xmath2pt .",
    "it is relatively light , with the excitation energy of @xmath18 mev , elastic , and well separated from the other nucleon resonances .",
    "it is also a very prominent resonance and plays an important role in many processes , including astrophysical ones .",
    "it is , for instance , responsible for the damping of the high - energy cosmic rays by the cosmic microwave background , the so - called gzk cutoff .",
    "let us therefore look at the description of this resonance in the framework of chiral effective - field theory ( @xmath2eft ) .",
    "imagine the compton scattering on the nucleon .",
    "the total cross - section of this process , as the function of photon energy @xmath19 , is shown in . in this case",
    "we are able to examine the entire energy range , starting with @xmath20 , through the pion production threshold @xmath21 and into the resonance region @xmath22 .    at energies up to around the pion production threshold",
    "the cross section shows a smooth behavior which can reproduced by a low energy expansion .",
    "in this region the @xmath17-resonance can be `` integrated out '' , as its tail contribution can be mimicked by the terms already present in the @xmath2pt lagrangian with nucleons only@xcite .",
    "higher in energy , however , the rapid energy variation induced by the resonance pole is not reproducible by a naive low - energy expansion . obviously , to describe this behavior it is necessary to introduce the @xmath17 as an explicit degree of freedom@xcite , hence include a corresponding field in the effective chiral lagrangian .",
    "the details of how this is done have recently been reviewed in@xcite .",
    "once the @xmath17 appears in the lagrangian the question is how to power - count its contributions . in @xmath2eft with pions and nucleons alone the power - counting index of a graph with @xmath23 loops , @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) internal pion ( nucleon ) lines , and @xmath26 vertices from @xmath27th - order lagrangian",
    "is found as n _",
    "= 4 l - 2 n_- n_n + _ k k v_k . what about the graphs with the @xmath17 , such as those depicted in ?",
    "their power counting turns out to be dependent on how one weighs the excitation energy @xmath28 in comparison with the other mass scales of the theory . in this case",
    "we have the soft momentum @xmath9 ( or , @xmath19 ) , the pion mass @xmath29 , and heavy scales which we collectively denote @xmath5 .",
    "the small scale expansion@xcite ( sse ) counts all light scales equally : @xmath30 .",
    "the small parameter is then : = \\ { , , } .",
    "an unsatisfactory feature of such a democratic counting ( @xmath31-expansion ) is that the @xmath17-resonance contributions are always estimated to be of the same size as the nucleon contributions .",
    "as we have seen from , in reality the resonance contributions are suppressed at low energies while being dominant in the resonance region .",
    "therefore the power counting _ overestimates _ the @xmath17-contributions at lower energies and _ underestimates _ them at the resonance energies . despite this flaw ,",
    "the sse has been widely and quite successfully used to account the @xmath17 contributions below the resonance@xcite .",
    "no applications of this scheme to calculation of observables in the resonance region have been reported yet .",
    "a more adequate power counting is achieved by separating out the resonance energy , e.g. , by maintaining the following scale hierarchy @xmath32 in the power - counting scheme@xcite . in the",
    "so - called _",
    "`` @xmath33 expansion''_@xcite this is done by introducing a small parameter @xmath34 , and then counting @xmath35 as @xmath36 .",
    "the power 2 is chosen here because it is the closest integer representing the ratio of these scales in the real world .",
    ".the counting of momenta in the three different @xmath2eft expansions . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we conclude this discussion by giving the general formula for the power - counting index in the @xmath33-expansion .",
    "the power - counting index , @xmath37 , of a given graph simply tells us that the graph is of the size of @xmath38 . for a graph with @xmath23 loops , @xmath26 vertices of dimension @xmath27 , @xmath24 pion propagators , @xmath25 nucleon propagators , @xmath39 delta propagators , @xmath40 odr propagators and @xmath41 odi propagators ( such that @xmath42 ) the index is n = \\ {    cc 2 n",
    "_ - n _ , & p~m _ ; + n _ - 3n_odr - n_odi , & p~ ,    . where @xmath43 , given by , is the index of the graph in @xmath2pt with no @xmath17 s . in the following",
    "i show a few applications of the @xmath33 expansion to the calculation of processes in the @xmath17 resonance region .",
    "the pion - nucleon ( @xmath15 ) scattering amplitude at leading order in the @xmath33-expansion in the resonance region , is given by the graph @xmath44 in .",
    "this is an example of an odr graph and thus the @xmath17-propagator counts as @xmath45 .",
    "the leading - order vertices are from @xmath46 and since @xmath47 , the whole graph is @xmath48 .",
    "= 7.5 cm    at the nlo , the graphs labeled @xmath49 begin to contribute .",
    "the @xmath50 vertices denoted by dots stand for the @xmath51 coupling from @xmath46 and the circles for the @xmath52 @xmath50 coupling@xcite from @xmath53 .",
    "the nlo graphs are thus @xmath54 .",
    "the graphs containing the loop correction to the vertex , as well as the nucleon - exchange graphs , begin to contribute at n@xmath55lo @xmath56 $ ] .",
    "the odr graphs at nlo contribute only to the @xmath57 partial wave and this contribution can conveniently be written in terms of the following partial - wave ` @xmath58-matrix ' : k_p33=- , where @xmath59 is the total energy and @xmath60 is an energy - dependent width , which arises from the @xmath17 self - energy . at this stage",
    "it is already taken into account that the real part of the self - energy will lead to the mass and field renormalization and otherwise are of n@xmath55lo .",
    "thus , only the imaginary part of the self - energy affects the nlo calculation .    in the odr graphs of",
    ", the @xmath17-propagator is dressed by the self - energy given to nlo by the graphs in , which give rise to the energy - dependent width : ( w ) = -2 .",
    "therefore the expression for the k - matrix becomes k_p33 = + (m _ )  .",
    "the @xmath15 scattering phase - shift is related to the partial - wave k - matrix simply as _",
    "l = k_l , where @xmath61 stands for the conserved quantum numbers : spin ( @xmath62 ) , isospin ( @xmath63 ) and parity ( @xmath64 ) . the @xmath57 phase ( corresponding to @xmath65 , @xmath66 ) is the only nonvanishing one at nlo in the resonance region .",
    "one can then fix the lecs @xmath51 and @xmath52 by fitting the result to the well - established empirical information about this phase - shift . in the red solid curve",
    "shows the nlo description of the empirical @xmath57 phase - shift represented by the data points .",
    "the blue dashed line in shows the lo result , obtained by neglecting @xmath67 and @xmath52 .",
    "this corresponds with the so - called `` constant width approximation '' . at both lo and nlo",
    ", the resonance width takes the value @xmath68 mev .",
    "one can conclude that the resonant phase - shift is remarkably well reproduced at nlo in the @xmath33 expansion .",
    "the comparison of the lo and nlo shows a very good convergence of this expansion in the broad energy window around the resonance position .",
    "the pion electroproduction on the proton in the @xmath17-resonance region has been under an intense study at many electron beam facilities , most notably at mit - bates , mami , and jefferson lab .",
    "the primary goal of these recent experiments is to map out the three electromagnetic @xmath69 transition form factors . on the theory side ,",
    "these form factors have been studied in both the sse@xcite and the @xmath33-expansion@xcite .",
    "they both have been reviewed very recently@xcite and i will therefore skip to the next topic .",
    "the radiative pion photoproduction ( @xmath70 ) in the @xmath17-resonance region is used to access the @xmath71 magnetic dipole moment ( mdm)@xcite . the pioneering experiment@xcite was carried out at mami in 2002 and a series of dedicated experiments were run in 2005 by the crystal ball collaboration with preliminary results announced this year@xcite .    the first , and thusfar the only , study of this process within @xmath2eft had been performed using the @xmath33 expansion@xcite .",
    "this case is particularly interesting from the viewpoint of @xmath33 expansion , because the kinematics is such ( for the optimal sensitivity to the mdm ) that the incident photon energy @xmath19 is in the vicinity of @xmath28 , while the outgoing photon energy @xmath72 is of order of @xmath29 . in this case",
    "the @xmath73 amplitude to nlo in the @xmath33-expansion is given by the diagrams ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) , where the shaded blobs , in addition to the couplings from the chiral lagrangian , contain the one - loop corrections shown in ( e ) , ( f ) .    figure  [ chiral ] shows the pion - mass dependence of real and imaginary parts of the @xmath74 and @xmath75 mdms , according to the calculation of ref .",
    "each of the two solid curves has a free parameter , a counterterm @xmath76 from @xmath77 , adjusted to agree with the lattice data at larger values of @xmath29 . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ chiral ] , the @xmath1 mdm develops an imaginary part when @xmath78 , whereas the real part has a pronounced cusp at @xmath79 .     and @xmath80 mdms [ in nuclear magnetons ] .",
    "dashed - dotted curve is the result for the proton magnetic moment from ref .",
    "the experimental data points for @xmath81 and @xmath71 ( circles ) are the values quoted by the pdg . quenched lattice data are from refs .",

    "width=302 ]    the dashed - dotted curve in fig .",
    "[ chiral ] shows the result  @xcite for the magnetic moment of the proton .",
    "one can see that @xmath82 and @xmath83 , while having very distinct behavior for small @xmath29 , are approximately equal for larger values of @xmath29 .",
    "the nlo calculation , completely fixes the imaginary part of the @xmath84 vertex .",
    "( for an alternative recent calculation of the imaginary part of the @xmath17 mdm see ref.@xcite ) .    the expansion for the real part of the @xmath84 begins with lecs from @xmath53 which represent the isoscalar and isovector mdm couplings@xcite : @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "a linear combination of these parameters , @xmath87(e/2m_\\de)$ ] , is to be extracted from the @xmath73 observables . for further discussion of how this is done i , for the reason of space ,",
    "have to refer to the original paper@xcite .",
    "the original formulation of chiral perturbation theory with nucleons is done in the manifestly lorentz - invariant fashion@xcite .",
    "however , essentially because of the use of the @xmath88 renormalization scheme , it was found violate the chiral power counting . the heavy - baryon chiral perturbation theory ( hb@xmath2pt ) , which treats nucleons semi - relativistically ,",
    "was developed to cure the power - counting problem  @xcite .",
    "the heavy - baryon formalism was extensively used in the previous decade and is still used sometimes .",
    "more recently , becher and leutwyler  @xcite proposed a manifestly lorentz - invariant formulation supplemented with so - called `` infrared regularization '' ( ir ) of loops in which the chiral power - counting is manifest .",
    "the ir , however , alters the analytic structure of the loop amplitude  a very undesirable feature . at about the same time it was realized@xcite that power - counting can be maintained in a manifestly covariant formalism without the ir or the heavy - baryon expansions .",
    "the original formulation@xcite satisfies the power - counting provided the appropriate renormalizations of available low - energy constants are performed , such that the renormalization scale is set at the nucleon mass scale .",
    "it since has been argued that the manifestly covariant calculations have , at least in some cases , better convergence than their heavy - baryon counterparts .",
    "this means that the convergence is improved by a resummation of terms which are required by analyticity , but are formally higher - order relativistic corrections to the non - analytic terms .    in the @xmath17-resonance region calculations , reviewed here",
    ", the use of the manifestly covariant formalism has been seen to be of utmost importance from the viewpoint of convergence and naturalness of the theory .",
    "the same statement can be for the studies of the chiral behavior for larger than physical values of pion mass.@xcite",
    "in the single - nucleon sector the limit of applicability of chiral perturbation theory is set by the excitation energy of the first nucleon resonance  the @xmath17(1232 ) .",
    "inclusion of the @xmath17 in the chiral lagrangian extends the limit of applicability into the resonance energy region .",
    "the power counting of the @xmath17 contribution depends crucially on how the @xmath89 , weighted in comparison to the other mass scales in the problem , in this case the pion mass @xmath29 and the scale of chiral symmetry breaking @xmath5 .",
    "two different schemes exist in the literature . in the small scale expansion @xmath90 , while in the `` @xmath33-expansion '' @xmath91 .",
    "i have argued that the hierarchy of scales used in the @xmath33 expansion provides a more adequate power - counting of the @xmath17-resonance contributions .",
    "it provides a justification for `` integrating out '' the resonance contribution at very low energies , as well as for resummation and dominance of resonant contributions in the resonance region .",
    "the @xmath33 expansion has already been successfully applied ( at nlo ) to the calculation of observables for processes such as pion - nucleon and compton scattering , pion electroproduction and radiative pion photoproduction in the @xmath17-resonance region .",
    "this applications show good convergence properties of this chiral eft expansion .",
    "the use of the manifestly lorentz - invariant formalism is seen to play an important role in naturalness of the theory .",
    "i have also given the examples of how the chiral eft plays here a dual role in that it allows for an extraction of resonance properties from observables _ and _ predicts their pion - mass dependence . in this way it may provide a crucial connection of present lattice qcd results to the experiment .",
