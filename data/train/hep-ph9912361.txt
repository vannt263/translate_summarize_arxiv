    "it has long been observed that in high energy hadron - nucleus collisions , the transverse momentum spectra of produced particles differ significantly from that in hadron - nucleon collisions @xcite .",

    "although it is believed that the cronin effect is a result of parton multiple scattering inside nuclear medium , systematic calculations in qcd for such anomalous nuclear dependence only exist for the large transverse momentum ( @xmath2 ) region @xcite , but not for the small @xmath2 region due to technical difficulties in handling multi - scale calculations in qcd perturbation theory . in this paper ,",
    "we derive the nuclear dependence in transverse momentum distributions for the drell - yan and j/@xmath3 production in the small @xmath2 region by combining constraints from perturbatively calculable quantities in the large @xmath2 region and the available information from independently measured physical observables @xcite .    in high energy nuclear collisions , in addition to short - distance single scattering , parton multiple scattering becomes very important . according to qcd factorization theorem @xcite",

    "contributions to physical observables from parton multiple scattering are directly proportional to multiparton correlation functions .",
    "these correlation functions are as fundamental as the parton distributions , and they provide complementary information on nonperturbative qcd dynamics @xcite . since single hard scattering is localized in position space , it is the multiple scattering that is sensitive to the size of nuclear medium , and is therefore responsible for the anomalous nuclear dependence . measurements of such anomalous nuclear dependence provide a window of opportunities to explore the dynamics of parton correlations , which have important implications for the physics in relativistic heavy ion collisions .    the nuclear dependence of the transverse momentum spectrum is often presented in terms of the ratio of cross sections @xmath8 or the nuclear dependence coefficient @xmath9 .",
    "for example , for the drell - yan pair production , the @xmath8 and @xmath9 are defined by @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath2 are the drell - yan pair s total invariant mass and transverse momentum , respectively , and @xmath7 is the atomic weight of the nuclear target . in eq .

    "the physically observed scales : @xmath11 and @xmath2 are both large enough , and in principle , qcd perturbation theory can be used to calculate the short - distance partonic scattering and the drell - yan cross section can be factorized into the following form @xcite @xmath44 where @xmath45 sum over all parton flavors @xmath5 and @xmath6 , the @xmath46 represents both the renormalization and factorization scales , the @xmath47 s and @xmath48 s represent the parton distributions and the convolution over incoming partons momentum fractions , respectively . in eq .",

    "these large logarithms are due to the gluon radiation off the incoming partons before the hard collision takes place to produce a drell - yan lepton pair @xcite . because of the infrared and collinear singularities associated with the massless gluons , we can have two powers of the large logarithms for every power of the strong coupling constant @xmath54 in the perturbatively calculated @xmath49 . clearly , the logarithms , @xmath55 , can be larger than the unity if the @xmath11 is much larger than the @xmath2 .",
    "for example , for @xmath56 production at the tevatron energies , the ratio @xmath57 can be as large as @xmath58 for @xmath59  gev and @xmath60  gev .",
