    "the 20th century has seen considerable advances and efforts in triangulating the distances of nearby stars through measurements of their annual parallax . by 1995",
    ", over 8,000 stars had been monitored using ground - based telescopes and their distances compiled in the yale catalog of trigonometric parallaxes @xcite .",
    "the hipparcos mission has further increased this sample by over an order of magnitudes , obtaining space - based astrometric parallaxes of over 110,000 stars @xcite .",
    "these efforts have been fundamental to modern astronomy , providing reliable absolute magnitudes for most classes of stars , defining the first rung of the cosmic distance ladder , constraining models of stellar structure and evolution , and drawing a 3-d map of star systems in the vicinity of the sun .",
    "however , the map of the solar neighborhood remains fragmentary to this day .",
    "the hipparcos catalog lists 150 stars within 10 parsecs , and 1123 stars within 25 parsecs .",
    "however , the catalog is complete only to about magnitude @xmath2 , and reaches down only to about @xmath3 .",
    "the local stellar field is dominated by low - luminosity red dwarfs ( main sequence m dwarfs ) , which fall beyond the magnitude limit of the hipparcos catalog . as a comparison the yale catalog lists 256 stars within 10 parsecs of the sun , and 2059 stars within 25 parsecs , with most of the additional stars consisting of low - luminosity red dwarfs and white dwarfs .",
    "apart from the low - luminosity companions of hipparcos stars , identified through common proper motion @xcite , astrometric distances of low - luminosity objects , including brown dwarfs and most red dwarfs and white dwarfs , are still largely dependent on ground - based measurements .",

    "the survey includes several hundred targets observable from ctio , most of them high - proper motion stars with photometric and spectroscopic distances placing them within 20 parsecs of the sun , with an emphasis on very nearby ( d@xmath410 pc ) objects @xcite . in the northern hemisphere ,",
    "a smaller parallax program has been carried on at the allegheny observatory , and parallaxes of 21 nearby stars have recently been reported @xcite .",
    "the united states naval observatory has also been supporting a parallax program in the past decades , from observations made at the usno flagstaff station @xcite ; the program has notably contributed parallaxes for the first representative sample of brown dwarfs @xcite .",
    "the torino observatory parallax program has also recently contributed data on six white dwarf candidates @xcite and 22 suspected nearby red dwarfs @xcite .",
    "finally , parallaxes of selected nearby objects have also been reported in recent years by various authors @xcite , including parallaxes for 10 nearby t dwarfs @xcite .",
    "overall , it is a fair assessment that these parallax programs are too modest in scope to keep up with the large numbers of objects which have been identified as probable nearby stars .",
    "as of august 2008 , the nstars database has parallax confirmation for 234 systems within 10 parsecs containing 325 individual stars , and for 2027 systems within 25 parsecs totaling 2629 stars .",
    "however , the census remains incomplete to this date .",
    "catalogs of stars with large proper motion still contain thousands of stars which are suspected to be within the solar neighborhood but for which there is no parallax data .",
    "the large catalogs assembled by w.j .",
    "luyten through the 1970s , the lhs and nltt catalogs @xcite are still being mined for nearby star candidates .",
    "recent all - sky proper motion surveys have also added to the bounty , identifying thousands more high proper motion stars that had been overlook in earlier surveys @xcite .",
    "the difficulty in selecting nearby stars from proper motion catalogs is to separate the stars whose large proper motion is due to their proximity , from the stars whose large proper motion reflects a large transverse velocity .",
    "for this , reliable photometric and/or spectroscopic distances must first be obtained .",
    "a host of recent spectroscopic follow - up observations have identified significant numbers of candidate nearby stars @xcite .",
    "but the main break in extracting large samples of nearby stars from proper motion catalogs has come from the availability of accurate infrared photometry , from which reliable photometric distances can be obtained from the optical - to - infrared color term @xcite . as a result ,",
    "there are now thousands of stars suspected to be within 25pc of the sun but for which there is no parallax distance confirmation . _",
    "the need for an accurate map of the solar vicinity thus justifies maintaining existing nearby - star parallax programs , as well as the development of new ones . _    recently , @xcite has demonstrated the use of the 2.4 m hiltner telescope at mdm observatory to obtain reliable parallaxes at the 1 - 2 mas accuracy .",
    "mdm parallaxes of 6 known nearby stars were found to be similar to usno parallaxes of the same objects .",
    "parallaxes of 27 relatively distant cataclysmic variables have so far been successfully obtained from mdm @xcite . based on this demonstrated success of using the hiltner telescope for accurate astrometry , we have initiated an program to measure the parallaxes of selected nearby star candidates from the list generated by @xcite .    in this paper , we present the first results of our program , which yield the first parallax determinations for 18 stars predicted to be within 15 parsecs of the sun .",
    "our astrometric observations are described in  2 .",
    "we analyze the results in  3 , where we also test the accuracy of the photometric distance estimates for low - mass stars .",
    "conclusions follow in  4 .",
    "we have observed a subsample of sixteen suspected nearby main sequence m dwarfs , selected from our own list of candidates from the lspm - north proper motion catalog @xcite .",
    "the stars all have photometric distances placing them within 15 parsecs of the sun @xcite .",
    "several of them have been proposed to be nearby stars in recent years , based on photometric / spectroscopic distance estimates from various authors ( see  2.6 ) .",
    "we have also selected from the lspm - north two new candidate white dwarfs , both suspected to be within 12 parsecs of the sun based on photometry alone .",
    "their presumed status as white dwarfs is strongly suggested by their location in the reduced proper diagram , where they show up as blue stars of low luminosity .",
    "astrometric imaging was carried out from the 2.4-meter hiltner telescope at mdm observatory , located on the southwest ridge of kitt peak , arizona .",
    "observations were scheduled in blocks of 4 - 6 nights , separated by 1 - 3 months over a period of 3 years .",
    "the general program included observations of several classes of targets , including cataclysmic variables , low - mass halo subdwarfs , and our test sample of 18 suspected very nearby stars .",
    "observations were made with the mdm @xmath5 ccd camera ( dubbed `` echelle '' ) . a typical pointing consisted in a series of 5 - 12",
    "short , 30 - 60 seconds exposures using either of the i band filter or a @xmath6  narrowband filter , which was used for targets bright enough to saturate the camera in a 30s i - band exposure .",
    "an additional exposure in the v band was typically obtained in each visit .",
    "stars were observed within 1 hour of the meridian whenever possible , but sometimes as far as 2 hours .",
    "a journal of observations for the 18 nearby star candidates is provided in table 1 for reference .",
    "astrometric solutions were determined following the method described and documented in detail in @xcite , including the setup of reference objects in the field , corrections for field scale and orientation , and a correction for differential atmospheric refraction .",
    "a typical astrometric solution for one of the stars ( lspm j0011 + 5908 ) is displayed in figure 1 .",
    "the vector root - mean - square centroiding accuracy for well - exposed stars was typically 5 to 7 mas per exposure , as judged from the scatter around the best fits ; these residuals are shown in figure 1 for lspm j0011 + 5908 .",
    "we estimated the parallax errors both from the formal fit errors and from the scatter of the fitted parallaxes of the reference stars .",
    "from our extended sets of ccd images , we also calculated apparent magnitudes in the v and i bands .",
    "photometry was calibrated from observations of a set of photometric standards @xcite .",
    "most of our fields have photometry from three or more observing runs , with independently derived calibrations .",
    "comparisons between runs indicate that the zero points for the quoted magnitudes and colors should be accurate to @xmath7 mag .",
    "although we observed standard stars that spanned a wide range of color ( 0.0@xmath4v - i@xmath42.0 ) , most of the program stars are so red ( v - i@xmath83 ) that they required some extrapolation of the color transformation .",
    "this can lead to systematic effects that are difficult to estimate reliably , but the good run - to - run reproducibility suggests that the @xmath9 colors of the reddest objects are determined to better than 0.2 mag . fortunately , 2mass infrared magnitudes are available for our program objects ; the @xmath10 colors are relatively insensitive to small errors in @xmath11 , and the latter were used to estimate the photometric distance .",
    "table 2 present our final reduced astrometric and photometric results .",

    "this is important for evaluating whether more extensive lists of candidate nearby stars can be efficiently assembled out of our proper motion catalogs .",
    "current photometric distances for stars in the lspm - north catalog are based on the [ m@xmath30,v@xmath31j ] color magnitude relationship , calibrated by @xcite using nearby stars with trigonometric parallaxes .",

    "figure 3 compares our photometric distance estimates to the measured parallax distances .",
    "filled squares plot the relative errors in the distance moduli for @xmath34 based on the photographic magnitudes @xmath35 .",
    "there is a clear trend for the more distant stars ( d@xmath814pc ) to have @xmath34 underestimating their distances , while the nearer objects ( d@xmath414pc ) have their distances slightly overestimated by the photometry .",
    "this can be explained by selection effects : our target sample was largely assembled out of stars with @xmath36 parsecs ( this selection selection limit is shown as a dashed line in fig.3 ) .",
    "overall , photographic distance moduli have a root mean square ( rms ) error of 0.546 over the parallax distance moduli .",
    "these are largely comparable with the rms for nearby stars with existing parallax measurements @xcite which show a 1-@xmath37 dispersion about the mean of 0.65 .",
    "to verify how much the errors @xmath34 are due to statistical / systematic errors on the photographic magnitudes @xmath35 , we also plot in fig.3 the errors on @xmath34 when calculated using the photometric ( ccd ) magnitudes from our astrometric sequences ( open circles ) .",
    "we find that the ccd magnitudes do improve the accuracy of @xmath34 for two of the more distant stars ( around 19pc ) , replacing them in line with @xmath38 .",
    "however , the ccd magnitudes appear to systematically overestimate the distances for the nearest stars .",
    "furthermore , three of the more distant objects stubbornly remain with significantly underestimated distances .",
    "overall , the ccd photographic distance moduli have an rms error of 0.588 , from which we conclude that the ccd photometry does not significantly improve the photographic distance estimates .",
    "it is clear that significant errors remain which must be explained by intrinsic uncertainties .",
    "possible sources of bias on the photometric distances include : ( 1 ) systematic or random errors in the photometry , ( 2 ) unresolved binaries or multiples , which tends to underestimate the distance of the pair , and ( 3 ) intrinsic scatter in the local [ m@xmath39,v@xmath31j ] color - magnitude relationship due to the dependence of the color and absolute magnitude on age and metallicity .",
    "these biases introduce uncertainties on the photometric distances of _ individual _ stars , no matter how well defined the mean color - magnitude relationship is . the multiplicity fraction in m dwarfs , in particular , is known to be @xmath40 @xcite , so significant numbers of doubles / multiple systems are expected to contaminate lists of candidate nearby stars .",
    "we use our parallax measurements and improved photometry to construct a color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) for the stars on our program .",
    "the cmd is shown in figure 4 .",
    "most m dwarfs fall neatly along the main sequence , while the two white dwarfs lie close to their expected locus .",
    "we find that three of our program m dwarfs hover more than 0.8 magnitudes above the mean main sequence .",
    "one of them is the known pair lspm j0405 + 7116e - ab , which we resolved in our astrometric images ; in fig.4 the unresolved pair is plotted as an asterisk .",
    "the other two objects , which both hover more than 1 mag above the mean main sequence , are the stars lspm j1314 + 1320 and lspm j1757 + 7042 , which we now suspect to be unresolved doubles ; these are plotted as stars in fig.4 .",
    "this suggest a possible @xmath41 contamination of the nearby star sample from distant unresolved doubles . the other known unresolved pair ,",
    "lspm j0711 + 4329 ( = lhs 1901 ) , also plotted as an asterisk in fig.4 , only falls marginally above the mean color - magnitude relationship , which shows that not all unresolved pairs should appear as significantly over - luminous .",
    "the mean main sequence and white dwarf sequence , shown by the dashed lines in fig.4 are the relationships we used to estimate the photometric distances .",
    "the bottom panel in fig.4 shows the residuals between the photometric and astrometric distance moduli , as a function of color .",
    "there does not appear to be any significant correlation between the color and residuals .",
    "figure 5 again shows the errors on the photometric distances @xmath34 , calculated from the ccd magnitudes , similar to the bottom panel in fig.4 but now plotted as a function of distance .",
    "different symbols again are used for the known and suspected doubles , and also for the more chromospherically active stars . again",
    "no significant difference is noted between the inactive and more active objects , but there is a clear correlation between the residuals and the parallax distances .",
    "this trend was already observed in fig.3 , and appears to be related to selection effects .",
    "it is clear that the more distant stars make it into the sample only if their distances are underestimated by photometry . on the other hand ,",
    "it remains unclear why the more nearby stars should have their photometric distances systematically overestimated .",
    "one possibility is that this is due to selection effects from _ earlier _ parallax programs .",
    "if these programs have been biased in favor of stars with very short photometric distances , it is possible that the only nearby stars left are those with overestimated photometric distances .",
    "we have obtained reliable parallax distances for 18 high proper motion stars identified in recent years to be probable nearby stars based on photometric and spectroscopic distance estimates .",
    "our parallax measurements confirm that the stars are within the solar neighborhood , with distances in the 9 - 22 parsecs range .",
    "spectra are presented for most of the stars , which confirms the white dwarf nature of two of the targets .",
    "three of the stars are found to have absolute parallaxes placing them within 10 parsecs of the sun : pm j0011 + 5908 is an m6.5 dwarf at 9.2 parsecs ; pm j0330 + 5413 is an active m4.5e dwarf at a distance of 9.6 parsecs ; pm j0510 + 2714 is just within the 10 pc horizon , and is an ultra - cool dwarf with subtype m8.0e .",
    "all three stars add to the current census of @xmath42 stars confirmed to be within 10 parsecs of the sun .",
    "the other 15 stars add to the tally of @xmath43 confirmed systems with @xmath44pc .",
    "our sample illustrates some of the systematic and random errors that plague photometric distance estimates .",
    "even with accurate photometric ccd measurements , several stars have photometric distance estimates which significantly over- or underestimate their true distances .",
    "one should thus expect some level of incompleteness and contamination in photometrically selected samples of nearby stars , which indicates that only systematic parallax measurements will produce reliable distances of the now several thousand stars suspected to be in the 15pc-33pc range @xcite , and for which no geometric parallax measurement exists to this date .",
    "our parallax measurements yield only a modest ( @xmath45 ) increment in the census of confirmed nearby stars .",
