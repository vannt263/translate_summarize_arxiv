    "the large mass difference between the pseudoscalar flavor singlet and nonsinglet mesons , such as @xmath26 and @xmath27 , which have the same quark content , reflects the quantum breaking of the @xmath4 symmetry .    at finite temperature",
    ", a phase transition occurs at a critical temperature @xmath5 , @xmath28 mev for @xmath12 . above @xmath5 ,",
    "chiral symmetry is restored and the quark condensate vanishes .",
    "therefore , the symmetry - breaking pattern at the chiral transition is expected to be @xmath22/\\mathbb{z}(n_f)_v \\rightarrow   { \\rm su}(n_f)_v/\\mathbb{z}(n_f)_v , \\label{sym1}\\ ] ] with a matrix - like order parameter given by the expectation value of the quark bilinear @xmath29 . in the case of two flavors ,",
    "i.e. @xmath12 , the symmetry - breaking pattern ( [ sym1 ] ) is equivalent to that of the o(4 ) vector model , i.e. , to o(4)@xmath30o(3 ) @xcite .",
    "thus , in the case of a continuous transition , the critical behavior of the model with two massless flavors is expected to belong to the three - dimensional ( 3d ) o(4 ) universality class .",
    "the symmetry - breaking pattern at the transition significantly changes if also the @xmath4 symmetry is restored .",
    "the anomaly effects breaking the @xmath4 symmetry are related to the topological properties of qcd .",
    "semiclassical instanton calculations predict a substantial suppression of the instanton density for @xmath31 , where the dilute instanton gas ( dig ) model is expected to provide a reliable approximation  @xcite .",
    "for example , in qcd with @xmath11 light flavors of mass @xmath32 , the topological susceptibility @xmath33 is expected to decay asymptotically as  @xcite @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the number of colors . for @xmath36 and @xmath12 we have @xmath37 .",
    "although @xmath33 vanishes in the massless limit , the dirac zero modes associated with the instantons induce a residual contribution to the @xmath4 symmetry breaking , giving rise to a difference between the susceptibilities of the so - called @xmath38 and @xmath39 channels at high @xmath8 @xcite , which behaves as @xmath40 in the chiral massless limit .",
    "the breaking of the @xmath4 symmetry at finite @xmath8 , and its role at the chiral transition , has been much investigated  .",
    "monte carlo ( mc ) simulations of lattice qcd   find a substantial suppression of the @xmath4 anomaly effects at large @xmath8 , as predicted by the dig model .",
    "these results are supported by numerical investigations of pure @xmath41 gauge theories , which show that the topological susceptibility is rapidly suppressed above the deconfinement transition , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein , and that the dig regime sets in quite early for @xmath42  @xcite .",
    "there are also some claims of an exact restoration of the @xmath4 symmetry at the chiral transition  @xcite .",
    "it is thus worth investigating the nature of the finite-@xmath8 chiral transition in the case the @xmath4 symmetry is effectively restored , and the relevant symmetry - breaking pattern is @xmath43/{\\rm u}(1)_v \\rightarrow   { \\rm u}(n_f)_v/{\\rm u}(1)_v ,   \\label{sym2}\\ ] ] instead of that reported in eq .",
    "( [ sym1 ] ) .    up to now",
    "we have discussed the case of the model with @xmath11 massless flavors . however , in nature quarks have a finite mass . since @xmath9 and @xmath10 quarks",
    "are very light , one expects that the correct physical behavior can be obtained by considering their masses as a perturbation in the theory with @xmath12 . according to renormalization - group ( rg ) theory ,",
    "if the transition is continuous in the chiral massless limit , then an analytic crossover is expected for nonzero values of the quark masses @xmath44 , because the quark masses act as external fields coupled to the order parameter .",
    "still , the presence of a close continuous transition gives rise to scaling relations depending on the fermion mass @xmath45 and on the reduced temperature @xmath46 .",
    "for instance , the fermion condensate is expected to scale as @xmath47 where @xmath39 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 are appropriate critical exponents determined by the universality class of the transition , see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite , and @xmath50 is an universal scaling function ( apart from trivial normalizations ) . on the other hand ,",
    "a first - order transition is generally robust against perturbations .",
    "therefore , if the massless theory undergoes a first - order transition , we expect a first - order transition also for small nonvanishing values of the masses , up to an endpoint @xmath51 , around which a 3d ising critical behavior is expected . for larger fermion masses",
    "the phase transition disappears and we have an analytic crossover as well .    to make contact with experiments , it is also necessary to take into account the massive strange quark @xmath52 , whose mass ( @xmath53 mev ) is comparable with @xmath5 . since the transition is expected to be of first order for @xmath54 light degenerate quarks , we also expect a first - order transition when increasing @xmath55 ( keeping @xmath56 ) , at least for sufficiently small values of @xmath55 . for larger values of @xmath55",
    "there are two possibilities , depending on the nature of the transition for @xmath12 degenerate quarks , corresponding to the limit @xmath57 . in one case",
    "we may have a first - order transition line which extends for all values of @xmath55 .",
    "alternatively , the first - order transition line extends up to a finite @xmath58 , then the transition becomes continuous for @xmath59 , and in particular in the limit @xmath60 ; @xmath58 is a tricritical point , separating the first - order transition line from the critical line , which implies that the critical behavior for @xmath61 should be described by mean - field theory , with logarithmic corrections .",
    "the nature of the chiral transition has been extensively studied . in spite of several mc studies of different lattice qcd formulations with two light quarks  ,",
    "the nature of the chiral transition is still controversial .",
    "some mc results favor a continuous transition , but are not sufficiently accurate to clearly identify the corresponding universality class .",
    "other mc studies report instead evidence of a first - order transition .",
    "for quark masses close to their physical values , the results of mc simulations   support a crossover scenario : the low-@xmath8 and high-@xmath8 regimes are not separated by a phase transition , but rather by a crossover region in which the thermodynamic quantities change rapidly , but continuously , in a relatively narrow temperature interval .",
    "the universal features of the chiral transition can be investigated within the rg framework  @xcite .",
    "they are determined by a few global properties , such as the space dimensionality @xmath10 ( @xmath62 for the finite-@xmath8 qcd transition ) , the nature and the symmetry of the order parameter ( a complex matrix related to the bilinear quark operators @xmath63 ) , and the symmetry - breaking pattern ( which is given by eqs .",

    "for this purpose one considers the rg flow in the space of lagrangians which satisfy the above - reported general properties and determines the fixed points ( fps ) of the flow . in the absence of a stable fp , only first - order transitions between the disordered and ordered phases are possible . on the other hand ,",
    "if a stable fp exists , the transition may be continuous , and the usual critical exponents @xmath64 , @xmath26 , etc ... are related to the eigenvalues of the linearized flow around the fp .",
    "however , it is important to stress that , even in the presence of a stable fp , some systems may still undergo a first - order transition .",
    "from the rg point of view , this occurs in systems which are not in the attraction domain of the stable fp .    to determine the rg behavior of the model",
    ", one can use standard perturbative field - theoretical approaches @xcite .",
    "the first rg study of the effective model with symmetry - breaking pattern ( [ sym2 ] ) was presented by pisarski and wilczek @xcite , who performed a one - loop calculation within the @xmath65 expansion , @xmath66 , finding no stable fp close to @xmath67 .",
    "this result suggests a first - order transition for the model with symmetry - breaking pattern ( [ sym2 ] ) .",
    "however , subsequent analyses of the rg flow directly in three dimensions , based on high - order perturbative expansions ( up to six loops ) , have provided the evidence of a stable 3d fp  @xcite .",
    "thus , the transition may also be continuous if the @xmath4 symmetry is effectively restored at @xmath5 .",
    "however , its universality class differs from the 3d @xmath68 universality class .",

    "we consider two different 3d perturbative schemes : the massive zero - momentum ( mzm ) scheme @xcite and the 3d minimal subtraction scheme @xmath71 without @xmath65 expansion @xcite .",
    "the resummation of the perturbative expansions of the @xmath48 functions ( known to six and five loops in the mzm and @xmath71 scheme , respectively ) allows us to compute the rg trajectories starting from the unstable gaussian fp of the free theory .",

    "we review them , focussing on the finite-@xmath8 transition in qcd with two light flavors .",
    "let us first assume that the phase transition at @xmath5 is continuous for vanishing quark masses . in this case",
    "the length scale of the critical modes diverges approaching @xmath5 , becoming eventually much larger than @xmath72 , which is the size of the euclidean `` temporal '' dimension at @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , the asymptotic critical behavior is associated with a 3d universality class with the same symmetry breaking pattern and the order parameter is an @xmath73 complex - matrix field @xmath74 , related to the bilinear quark operators @xmath63 .",
    "nonvanishing quark masses can be accounted for by an external field coupled to the order parameter .    to determine the critical behavior we consider the most general landau - ginzburg - wilson ( lgw ) @xmath3 theory compatible with the given symmetry breaking . if eq .",

    "the existence of a stable fp with @xmath152 implies that the finite-@xmath8 chiral transition of two - flavor qcd can be continuous also if the @xmath4 symmetry is effectively restored at @xmath5 .",
    "although the critical behavior differs from that expected in the case of a substantial @xmath4 symmetry breaking around @xmath5 , which is the 3d @xmath6 vector universality class , we note that differences are small .",
    "for instance , the critical exponents of the @xmath6 universality class  @xcite , @xmath153 , @xmath154 , @xmath155 , @xmath156 , @xmath157 and @xmath158 are close to those we have obtained for model ( [ lun ] ) . in the mzm scheme",

    "we obtain instead @xmath165 , @xmath166 , @xmath167 , @xmath168 , @xmath169 , and @xmath170 .",
    "thus , only very accurate estimates of the critical exponents can distinguish the two different critical behaviors .",
    "we stress that the existence of a universality class does not exclude that some systems with the same order parameter and symmetry - breaking pattern undergo a first - order transition .",
    "this occurs when the system is outside the attraction domain of the stable fp , i.e. , when the system at the transition is effectively described by the lagrangian ( [ lun ] ) with quartic parameters @xmath93 and @xmath92 belonging to the large region @xmath171 . the nature ( first - order or continuous ) of the transition is nonuniversal , since it depends on the details of the model and not only on the global features that characterize the universality class .",
    "for example , the model considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , which corresponds to two - flavor lattice qed with the same symmetry breaking @xmath1 , shows a first - order transition .",
    "this result can not be extended to all transitions with the same symmetry breaking , because it is indeed possible that this model corresponds to a run - away rg trajectory , while the case relevant to qcd may belong to the attraction domain of the stable fp , thus undergoing a continuous transition .",

    "thick black lines indicate first - order transitions .",
    "the endpoints of the first - order transition lines correspond to mean - field transitions with logarithmic corrections . ]",
    "the results for model ( [ lun ] ) are also of interest if chiral symmetry is not exactly restored at @xmath5 , but u(1)@xmath0 breaking effects are small . in this case",
    "we can parametrize the effective lagrangian as @xmath174 , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we added all terms up to dimension four which contain the determinant of the @xmath175 order parameter field and leave a residual su(2)@xmath88su(2 ) symmetry . in the context of two - flavor qcd",
    ", we may assume that @xmath176 where @xmath172 parametrizes the effective breaking of the u(1)@xmath0 symmetry . in the @xmath8-@xmath172 plane ,",
    "the u(2)@xmath177@xmath88u(2)@xmath178 transition point becomes a multicritical point @xcite , as lagrangian ( [ lsu2 ] ) contains two quadratic terms . in fig .",
    "[ pd ] we show two possible phase diagrams , depending on the nature of the transition at @xmath173 . in the first case ( left panel of fig .",
    "[ pd ] ) , the transition is always continuous for @xmath179 along the critical line @xmath180 .",
    "but if @xmath181 is small , we may observe a crossover behavior controlled by the u(2)@xmath88u(2 ) multicritical point at @xmath173 : the free energy should behave as @xmath182 , where @xmath183 , @xmath184 , and @xmath185  @xcite .",
    "in practice , if @xmath172 is small , one might observe two different behaviors depending on the distance of @xmath8 from the critical line @xmath180 .",
    "for @xmath186 not too small , the rg flow is influenced by the u(2)@xmath88u(2 ) multicritical point , hence one would observe an effective critical behavior analogous to that for @xmath173 .",
    "as @xmath8 approaches @xmath180 , this crossover behavior disappears and the o(4 ) behavior is eventually observed . in the other case , shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ pd ] , we expect first - order transitions to occur also for @xmath181 small , up to an endpoint @xmath187 where mean - field behavior with logarithmic corrections should be observed ; then the continuous transition for larger @xmath188 ( note that @xmath187 does not need to be small ) is expected to belong to the o(4 ) universality class .",
    "the available numerical mc results for qcd with two light flavors do not yet allow us to distinguish between the above scenarios .",
    "finally , we would like to discuss the possible scenarios for the finite-@xmath8 transitions of the qcd - like theory with a large number @xmath35 of colors , widening the parameter space to get further hints for the relevant @xmath36 case .",
    "we first note that the universality arguments based on the global flavor symmetries do not depend on the number of colors , thus they hold for any @xmath189 ( keeping @xmath11 fixed ) as well , including @xmath190 . at large @xmath35 , keeping the number @xmath11 of flavors fixed , we expect a first - order transition corresponding to the deconfinement transition of pure @xmath191 gauge theories for a large number of colors , thus at  @xcite @xmath192 where @xmath193 is the string tension .",
    "the presence of @xmath12 fermion flavors , which contribute to @xmath194 according to standard large-@xmath35 scaling arguments  @xcite , can not smooth out this transition whose latent heat is @xmath195  @xcite .",
    "this opens the road to other possible scenarios with respect to the standard three - color qcd .",
    "indeed , the chiral symmetry of the fermions may be restored at the same transition point , or we may have another transition at a larger temperature  @xcite , like the case of qcd with adjoint fermions  @xcite , where the deconfinement and chiral transitions occur at different temperatures . moreover , since the @xmath4 anomaly is suppressed by @xmath196 in the large-@xmath35 limit  @xcite , the @xmath4 symmetry breaking is further suppressed at large @xmath35 , as also shown by the behavior @xmath40 , where the exponent @xmath197 , cf .",
    "( [ chisup ] ) . therefore , with increasing @xmath35 , the effective symmetry breaking at the chiral transition with two light flavors should be better and better described by @xmath198 , rather than @xmath199 .",
