    "recently , a progress to go beyond dmft through cluster extensionsclusterdmft , clusterdmft1,clusterdmft2,clusterdmft3,clusterdmft4 was achieved .",
    "these correlations are however necessarily short - range in nature due to numerical limitations of the cluster size@xcite .",

    "indeed , @xmath2 operates with one - particle irreducible ( 1pi ) vertices , and neglects six - point and higher order 1pi local vertices .",
