    "experiments were performed @xcite to study interaction of molecular motors and microtubules in isolation from other biophysical processes simultaneously occurring _ in vivo_. at large enough concentration of molecular motors and microtubules , the latter organize in _ asters _ and _ vortices _ depending on the type and concentration of molecular motors .    , b - integration regions @xmath0 for eq.([master]).,width=316 ]    in the above experiments the elementary interaction processes were identified .",
    "after molecular motor binds to a microtubule at a random position , it marches along it in a fixed direction until it unbinds without appreciable displacement of microtubules ( since the mass of a molecular motor is small in comparison with that of the microtubule ) .",
    "however , if a molecular motor binds to _ two _ microtubules ( most molecular motors have at least two binding sites ) , it can change their mutual position and orientation significantly . in small - scale simulations @xcite , the interaction of rod - like filaments via motor binding has been studied , and patterns resembling experimental ones were observed . in @xcite a phenomenological model for the molecular motor density and the microtubule orientation has been proposed .",
    "the model included transport of molecular motors along microtubules and alignment of microtubules mediated by molecular motors .",
    "simulations showed that vortices and asters indeed form in this model , however , only one large vortex formed in case of high density of motors . ref .",
    "@xcite generalized this model by including separate densities of free and bound molecular motors , as well as the density of microtubules .",
    "this model exhibited a transition from asters to vortices as the density of molecular motors is increased , in apparent disagreement with experimental evidence @xcite that asters give way to vortices with _ decreasing _ the molecular motors concentration .",
    "somewhat similar approach was employed more recently by sankararaman et al .",
    "@xcite , again with the same apparent disagreement with the experiment as in refs .",
    "a phenomenological flux - force relation for active gels was introduced in @xcite .",
    "while vortex and aster solutions were obtained in a certain limit , an analysis of that model is difficult because of the large number of unknown parameters and fields .    in ref .",
    "@xcite a set of equations for microtubules density and orientation was derived from conservation laws for microtubules probability distribution function .",
    "these conservation laws were based on the phenomenological expressions for the probability fluxes due to diffusion and motor - mediated interactions .",
    "the latter , however , assumed that tubules are only displaced and rotated infinitesimally in individual interactions , which may not be the case in experiments .",
    "the model does not produce onset of spontaneous orientation for any density of microtubules .",
    "the authors argue that asters and vortices may be created as a result of the `` bundling instability '' @xcite .",
    "however , this model demonstrated the bundling instability at small densities of tubules , and oscillatory orientational instability at large densities contrary to observations in which the orientational ordering is observed at smaller densities and is not oscillatory . in subsequent publication @xcite , a derivation of the probability conservation equations from microscopic mean - field model of forces between tubules and motors was presented , however the assumptions made in the course of derivation ( i.e. infinitely stiff molecular motors ) lead to a surprising conclusion that filaments do not change their orientation during interaction .    in this paper",
    "we present an alternative calculation of the microscopic motion of two filaments connected by a moving motor in a viscous fluid and show that filaments do change orientation as a result of the interaction . in our short publication",
    "@xcite we derived a continuum model for the collective spatio - temporal dynamics of microtubules starting with a stochastic microscopic master equation for interacting inelastic polar rods , assuming that the density of molecular motors is homogeneous in space .",
    "our model differed from the transport equations @xcite in that it treated the interaction between two tubules as an instantaneous inelastic `` collision '' that can change the orientation of the filaments significantly .",

    "we derive the interaction kernel from microscopic rules and relate the kernel characteristics with the properties of the motors .",
    "we further extend our analysis : we lift the assumption of the homogeneous distribution of molecular motors and include an additional equation for the evolution of the molecular motor density .",
