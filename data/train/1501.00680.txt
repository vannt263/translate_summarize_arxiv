    "it was previously shown how a new method , the square wave method ( swm ) , for the analysis of signals depending on one variable @xcite can be presented in the frequency domain by using a mathematical tool called square wave transform ( swt ) @xcite @xcite .",
    "the swm was then generalized quite naturally and directly for image analysis @xcite .",
    "the objectives of this paper are the following :    1 .   to provide a brief review of the use of the swm for the analysis of signals and specify the relations existing between a ) the sampling frequency @xmath0 , with which the successive values of recordings of biomedical signals ( such as those of an electrocardiogram , electromyogram or electroencephalogram ) are measured , and b ) the frequencies @xmath1 , corresponding respectively to the different trains of square waves @xmath2 obtained using the swm ; 2 .   to indicate how it also is possible to present in the frequency domain using the swt , the results of the analysis of images obtained with the swm .",
    "the application of the swm in the field of signal and image analysis is exemplified with the results of an analysis of a ) a sequence of samples ( that is , measured values from an electromyographic recording ) ; and b ) the classic image of lenna , using the swt @xcite .",
    "consider a function of time ( @xmath3 ) , in the interval @xmath4 , satisfying the conditions of dirichlet @xcite : @xmath5    suppose that the time interval in which the function characterized in equation   will be analyzed ( @xmath6 ) has been divided into 18 equal sub - intervals . in this case , it will be seen that function ( 1 ) can be approximated in @xmath4 , using the sum of the parts corresponding to @xmath4 of 18 trains of square waves .",
    "these trains of square waves will be called @xmath7 ; the `` @xmath8 '' being based on the word `` square '' in the expression `` train of square waves '' .",
    "if @xmath4 has been divided into 100 equal sub - intervals , the approximation to the function   in interval @xmath4 will be carried out by adding the parts corresponding to @xmath4 of 100 trains of square waves : @xmath9 . in general ,",
    "if @xmath4 is divided into any natural number @xmath10 of equal sub - intervals , the approximation in @xmath4 to function   will be obtained by adding the parts corresponding to @xmath4 of @xmath10 trains of square waves : @xmath11 . the square wave method ( swm ) described in this section",
    "makes it possible to determine those trains of square waves unambiguously .",
    "therefore , each @xmath12 ( where @xmath13 ) of those trains of square waves will be characterized by a specific frequency @xmath14 ( i.e. , consideration is given to the number of waves in the train of square waves , which is contained in the unit of time 1 s ) and a particular coefficient @xmath15 , whose absolute value is the amplitude of the corresponding train .",
