    "coxeter in his book @xcite , considered the following theorem of _ affine _ geometry ;    [ routh th]if the sides @xmath0 of a triangle @xmath1 are divided at @xmath2 @xmath3 in the respective ratios @xmath4",
    "@xmath5 @xmath6 the cevians @xmath7 form a triangle whose area is @xmath8    times that of @xmath9    he emphasized that this result was discovered by steiner , but simultaneously cited two references the first was  steiner s work @xcite and the second was routh s work : @xcite . later in his book he referred to the result as `` routh s theorem '' @xcite admitting to the contribution of both scientists in revealing the theorem .",
    "coxeter gave a general proof of this result using _ barycentric _ coordinates attributed to mbius__. _ _ these are _ homogeneous _ coordinates @xmath10 , where @xmath11 are masses at the vertices of a triangle of reference @xmath12 .",
    "in particular @xmath13 is @xmath14 @xmath15 is @xmath16 , @xmath17 is @xmath18 and @xmath19 corresponds to a point @xmath20 such that the areas of the triangles @xmath21 are proportional to the barycentric coordinates @xmath11 of @xmath20 , respectively ( see fig .",
    "[ triangle - fig ] ) .",
    "if @xmath22 then the normalized barycentric coordinates @xmath10 are called _ areal _ coordinates . in this case",
    "the areas of the triangles @xmath23 are @xmath11 times the area of the whole triangle @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "recently , a. bnyi and b. urgus @xcite , proved a version of theorem [ routh th ] and got a unification of the theorems of ceva and menelaus .",
    "in fact they unified two expressions of routh on area ratios into one from which they derived both theorems of ceva and menelaus as special cases .",
    "putting aside the search after `` nice expressions '' , theorem [ routh th ] implies the following general property :    [ general division of triangle ] if the sides of a triangle @xmath24 are divided at @xmath25 in the respective ratios @xmath26 then the ratio of the area of any sub polygon to the area of the whole triangle depends only on @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 ( see fig . triangular - network  for the case @xmath30    a sub polygon of the triangle is defined as a polygon whose vertices are points of intersections of the cevians @xmath31 .    to prove the theorem we compute first",
    "the barycentric coordinates for each vertex of the sub polygon ; these are points of intersections of the barycentric equations of the cevians @xmath31 .",
    "next we divide the sub polygon into non - overlapping triangles ( in fig .",
    "[ triangular - network ] the polygon @xmath32 is divided into @xmath33 triangles ) . then we use the method which coxeter gave in his book @xcite for proving theorem [ routh th ] ( which will be illustrated in the next section ) to conclude that the ratio of the area of each triangle to the area of the whole triangle depends only on @xmath34 and the result follows .",
    "the search after nice expressions of area ratios succeeds in `` symmetric '' divisions .",
    "in particular we have the following theorem :    [ 1-lampda-1-th]suppose the sides of a triangle @xmath35 are divided at @xmath36 in the respective ratios @xmath37 ( see fig . [ 1-lampda-1 ] ) .",
    "let @xmath38 be the points of intersection of the corresponding cevians as shown in the table:@xmath39    then the ratio of the area of the hexagon @xmath40 to the area of the triangle @xmath35 is @xmath41    at first note that such a hexagon exists in any triangle since it exists in an equilateral triangle , by symmetry of the division ratios , and every other triangle is affine equivalent to an equilateral triangle .",
    "let @xmath42 be the centre of gravity of @xmath43 since the barycentric coordinates of @xmath44 are @xmath45 respectively , the barycentric coordinates of @xmath42 are @xmath46 by symmetry , the area of the hexagon @xmath40 is @xmath47 times the area of the triangle @xmath48 therefore , it is sufficient to compute the barycentric coordinates of @xmath49 and @xmath50    in order to find the barycentric equations of the corresponding cevians , we exhibit the barycentric coordinates of some of the division points .",

    "if @xmath82 then the ratio of the area of the hexagon to the area of the triangle is @xmath83 this special case is referred to as marion walter s theorem @xcite which states the following : _ if the trisection points of the sides of any triangle are connected to the opposite vertices , the resulting hexagon has one - tenth the area of the original triangle . _ 2 .",
    "if @xmath84 is odd , @xmath85 then taking @xmath86 implies that the ratio of the area of the hexagon to the area of the triangle is @xmath87this special case is referred to as morgan s theorem @xcite , which was proved by t. watanabe , r. hanson and f. d. nowosielski @xcite using routh - steiner theorem several times .",

    "we can generalize the routh - steiner theorem to parallelograms in the following manner :        if the barycentric coordinates of @xmath99 are @xmath100 respectively , then the barycentric coordinates of @xmath101 are @xmath102 this is true since the diagonals in the parallelogram bisect each other and the barycentric coordinates of the midpoint of @xmath103 are @xmath104 ( see fig .",

    ". he did not provide any proof but pointed out the following :  `` since a square is affinely equivalent to a parallelogram , the easiest way to derive and prove this formula is to consider the special case of a square '' .",
    "finally , the fascinating theorem of routh - steiner attracted the interest of mathematics education researchers , probably because of the use of a dynamic geometry software to rediscover the theorem , but it still attracts the interest of mathematics researchers as well ."
