    "the field of cold ( @xmath6 k ) and ultracold ( @xmath7 1 mk ) molecules has attracted great interest in the last few years .",
    "the production of such ( ultra)cold species may find important applications in condensed matter physics @xcite , high precision spectroscopy @xcite , physical chemistry @xcite , and quantum computing @xcite .",
    "there are , in principle , two different strategies for producing molecular samples at ( ultra)low temperatures . in indirect methods ,",
    "cold molecules are formed by pairing up atoms that are already cooled down to the ultracold regime .",
    "examples of such methods include photoassociation @xcite and feshbach association @xcite .",
    "conversely , direct methods such as stark deceleration @xcite and buffer gas cooling @xcite employ a scheme in which pre - existing molecules are cooled down from higher temperatures .",
    "one of the most promising candidates for direct - cooling experiments is the nh radical .",
    "nh(@xmath8 ) has a relatively large magnetic moment of 2 @xmath9 , making it suitable for buffer gas cooling and magnetic trapping experiments @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the metastable @xmath10 state of nh , which exhibits a linear stark effect , can be efficiently stark decelerated and trapped in an electrostatic field .",
    "subsequent excitation of the @xmath11 transition followed by spontaneous emission to the ground state yields cold nh(@xmath8 ) molecules , which in turn may be trapped in a magnetic field @xcite .",
    "this scheme also allows for reloading of the magnetic trap , thus providing a means to increase phase - space density .    at present , direct - cooling methods for nh",
    "are limited to temperatures of a few hundred mk .",
    "if the density of trapped molecules is sufficiently high , it may be possible to reach the ultracold regime by means of evaporative cooling .",
    "this process relies on elastic nh + nh collisions as the trap depth is gradually reduced .",
    "inelastic spin - changing collisions between trapped nh molecules will lead to immediate trap loss and are therefore unfavorable .",
    "it is generally accepted that , in order for evaporative cooling to be successful , elastic collisions should be a few orders of magnitude more efficient than inelastic transitions @xcite . in the case of nh(@xmath8 ) , the only magnetically trappable state is the low - field seeking @xmath12 state , with @xmath13 denoting the spin projection quantum number .",
    "a collision complex of two such molecules is in the @xmath14 level of the nh ",
    "nh high - spin quintet ( @xmath15 ) state .",
    "inelastic collisions between nh molecules may either change the @xmath13 quantum number of the quintet state , or change the total spin @xmath16 to produce singlet or triplet complexes .",
    "the @xmath17 and 1 dimer states are chemically reactive @xcite and , although unfavorable for evaporative cooling , could be of interest in the context of cold controlled chemistry @xcite .",
    "a recent theoretical study by kajita @xcite , in which only the electric dipole - induced dipole and magnetic dipole - dipole interactions were considered , showed that evaporative cooling of nh is likely to be feasible . a more rigorous quantum calculation of elastic and inelastic cross sections , however , requires knowledge of the full nh ",
    "nh interaction potentials for all three spin states .",
    "in particular the long - range potential , which governs the dynamics at ( ultra)low temperatures , should be described very accurately . for nh  nh the dominant long - range term is the electrostatic dipole - dipole interaction , which scales with the intermolecular distance @xmath18 as @xmath19 .",
    "if , however , the molecules are freely rotating , all multipole - multipole terms average out to zero and the isotropic ( @xmath20 ) dispersion and induction interactions become important .",

    "@xcite have recently constructed four - dimensional _ ab initio _ potential energy surfaces for nh ",
    "nh which , in principle , contain all relevant long range contributions .",
    "they employed the partially spin - restricted coupled - cluster method with single and double excitations and a perturbative treatment of triples [ rccsd(t ) ] @xcite to obtain the surface for the nh ",
    "nh quintet state .",
    "we found , however , that this surface exhibits erroneous behavior in the long range due to a lack of size consistency in the open - shell rccsd(t ) method . in the present paper ,",
    "we report more accurate _",
    "ab initio _ calculations that are corrected for this undesirable feature , and which allow for an analytical fit of the long - range potential .",
    "the fit of the short - range potentials is also improved .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ subsec : elecstruc_rccsd(t ) ] , we first address the rccsd(t ) size - consistency problem and present new rccsd(t ) calculations for the long range of the nh  nh potential .",
    "long - range perturbation theory calculations are discussed in section [ subsec : elecstruc_pt ] , and new caspt@xmath1 ( @xmath21 ) calculations for the short range of the singlet and triplet potentials are presented in section [ subsec : elecstruc_casptn ] .",
    "the fit of the different potentials is described in section [ sec : analytical_repr ] , followed by a discussion of the results in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "finally , conclusive remarks are given in section [ sec : concl ] .",
    "the coupled - cluster ( cc ) approach is one of the most accurate _ ab initio _ methods available for calculating potential energy surfaces .",
    "this method requires a single slater determinant function as the reference state , which in the case of nh  nh implies that only the high - spin quintet state is suitable for coupled - cluster calculations . at large intermolecular distances however , the energy splittings between the three different spin states become negligible , and thus the cc potential also applies to the singlet and triplet states at long range . in this section , we will show that the previously reported nh  nh rccsd(t ) potential @xcite contains a size - consistency error that becomes apparent at large @xmath18 .",
    "we also present new _",
    "ab initio _ calculations that are corrected for this defect .",
    "the coordinates used to describe the nh  nh potential energy surfaces are the four intermolecular jacobi coordinates ( @xmath18 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 ) .",
    "the coordinate @xmath18 is the length of the intermolecular vector @xmath25 that connects the centers of mass of monomers @xmath26 and @xmath27 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the polar angles of the nh monomer axes relative to @xmath25 , and @xmath24 is the dihedral angle between the planes through @xmath25 and the monomer axes ( see also fig .  1 of ref .",
    "all interaction potentials are computed using the supermolecule approach with the counterpoise correction method of boys and bernardi @xcite .",
    "it is well established that coupled - cluster theory for closed - shell systems is rigorously size - consistent . for open - shell species , however , where the problem of nonzero spin arises , this issue is not straightforward .",
    "it was demonstrated in 2006 by heckert _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite that several spin - adapted ccsd schemes applied to the triplet f(@xmath28 ) ",
    "f(@xmath28 ) system exhibit size - consistency errors on the order of 10@xmath29",
    " 10@xmath30 @xmath5 .",
    "the reason for this is still unclear , but it has been suggested that the problem lies in the truncation of the cluster operator @xcite .",
    "although the errors are very small , the effect becomes apparent when considering interactions at low temperatures , where the total energy of the system may be of a similar order of magnitude ( 10@xmath29 @xmath5 @xmath31 0.03 k ) .",
    "hence , a lack of size consistency imposes a significant limitation on the accuracy of calculations in the ( ultra)cold regime .    when evaluating the nh(@xmath0 ) ",
    "nh(@xmath0 ) quintet potential of ref .",
    "@xcite in more detail , we indeed found that the interaction energy does not tend to zero at large intermolecular distances . at @xmath18",
    "= 30@xmath32000 @xmath33 , the size - consistency error is @xmath34 @xmath5 calculated at the rccsd level of theory with the augmented correlation - consistent polarized valence triple - zeta ( aug - cc - pvtz ) basis set @xcite , and @xmath35 @xmath5 at the rccsd(t)/aug - cc - pvtz level of theory . it should be noted that these errors are independent of the relative orientation of the monomers , i.e. , the lack of size consistency affects only the isotropic part of the potential . the results for other basis sets are given in table [ tab : sizecon ] .",
    "it can be seen that the error is largest at the rccsd level and increases with the size of the basis set .",
    "the inclusion of triple excitations reduces the error by approximately one order of magnitude and , for most basis sets , also changes its sign .",
    "although the problem has not been solved yet , we found that the nh ",
    "nh rccsd(t ) potential can be easily corrected for the lack of size consistency by simply subtracting the error , calculated at 30000 @xmath33 , from all _ ab initio _ points .",
    "we compared these corrected energies with the results obtained from a spin - unrestricted ccsd(t ) [ uccsd(t ) ] calculation , of which the energies do converge to zero at long range [ i.e.  uccsd(t ) is size - consistent ] . at @xmath18",
    "= 30.0 @xmath33 , the root - mean - square ( rms ) difference between the uccsd(t ) and corrected rccsd(t ) data was calculated to be 9.1@xmath36 @xmath5 ( 0.08% of the mean absolute value of the potential ) for a grid of 126 _ ab initio _ points . without the size - consistency correction",
    "this difference would be 5.1@xmath37 @xmath5 ( 4.4% ) .",
    "thus , the error subtraction at the rccsd(t ) level leads to significantly better agreement with the size - consistent uccsd(t ) method .",
    "similar results were obtained at an intermolecular distance of 15.0 @xmath33 , where the rms difference between the corrected rccsd(t ) and uccsd(t ) data is 7.0@xmath38 @xmath5 ( 0.07% of the mean absolute energy ) , as opposed to 5.4@xmath37 @xmath5 ( 0.54% ) without the correction . at even smaller distances , the size - consistency error will become increasingly negligible compared to the total interaction energy , thus the correction will leave the short - range potential essentially unaffected . based on these findings , we conclude that subtracting the error from all rccsd(t ) points does not significantly alter the accuracy of the potential , but does give the desired asymptotic behavior at long range .",
    "although the size - consistency correction already constitutes an important refinement to the rccsd(t ) potential of ref .",
    "@xcite , we chose to improve the long range even further by performing new _ ab initio _ calculations .",
    "this is motivated by our aim to study collisions in the limit of zero temperature , for which it is desirable to have the long range in analytical form .",
    "in order to perform an accurate analytical fit , however , we found that the long - range _ ab initio _",
    "energies should be converged to less than 10@xmath39 @xmath5 , while the data presented in ref .",
    "@xcite have been converged to only 10@xmath30 @xmath5 .",
    "we therefore recalculated the points at large @xmath18 with much tighter convergence thresholds , as low as 10@xmath40 @xmath5 , to ensure that the fit will not be affected by numerical noise .",
    "the radial grid consisted of 8 points , approximately logarithmically spaced at 8.3 , 10.0 , 12.0 , 14.4 , 17.3 , 20.8 , 25.0 , and 30.0 @xmath33 . for the angular grid , we chose an 11-point gauss - legendre quadrature grid in ( @xmath41 ) and an 11-point gauss - chebyshev grid in @xmath24 .",
    "these are known to be the most accurate quadratures on their respective domains @xcite . due to the symmetry of the complex , only points with @xmath42 and @xmath43 were required in the calculations @xcite .",
    "the monomers were treated as rigid rotors , with the nh bond length fixed to the experimental equilibrium value of 1.0362   @xcite .",
    "the rccsd(t ) energies were computed using the aug - cc - pvtz basis set , with additional bond functions located at the midpoint of the intermolecular vector @xmath25 ( exponents @xmath44 : 0.9 , 0.3 , and 0.1 ; @xmath45 : 0.6 and 0.2 ; @xmath46 : 0.3 ) .",
    "all calculations were performed with the molpro package @xcite .",
    "as explained above , the size - consistency error of 0.51290@xmath47 @xmath5 was subtracted from all rccsd(t ) points to ensure that the long range converges to zero .      as an additional test for the accuracy of the rccsd(t ) long - range potential",

    "the permanent multipole moments were obtained from finite field calculations at the rccsd(t)/aug - cc - pvtz level of theory and from density functional theory ( dft ) , yielding two different sets of first - order coefficients .",

    "for the electrostatic terms , we have @xmath70 and @xmath71 , with @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "the minimum value of 1 comes from the fact that the lowest nonvanishing permanent multipole moment of nh is the dipole . in the case of induction and",

    "we then fitted the size - consistency corrected rccsd(t ) data to the expansion of eq.([eq : lll ] ) , and subsequently fitted each @xmath87 expansion coefficient in terms of @xmath86 functions [ eq .  ( [ eq : vlr ] ) ] .",
    "note that the fit of eq .",
    "( [ eq : lll ] ) is mathematically equivalent to evaluating the overlap integral between the angular functions and @xmath88 by gauss - legendre quadrature .",

    "the main fit results for the ( size - consistency corrected ) rccsd(t ) long - range potential are presented in table [ tab : cn ] .",
    "a total number of 588 @xmath85 coefficients was included in the long - range fit ( @xmath140 and @xmath141 ) , but here we list only the most important terms .",
    "table [ tab : cn ] also shows the results obtained from first and second - order perturbation theory ( pt ) .",
    "it can be seen that the fitted electrostatic terms agree very well with the pt coefficients , in particular with the data calculated at the pt ",
    "rccsd(t ) level of theory . for the induction and dispersion terms",
    "we find some significant discrepancies , but the most important second - order fit coefficients ( those with @xmath142 ) show satisfactory agreement with pt  dft .",
    "it should be noted that , for the fitted coefficients , no distinction can be made between induction and dispersion contributions . for the isotropic @xmath143 term ,",
    "the pt - dft calculations give a dispersion coefficient of 39.86 a.u .  and an induction term of 6.99 a.u .    as an indication of the relative importance of the different @xmath85 coefficients ,",
    "we explicitly give their contributions to the potential at @xmath18 = 30 @xmath33 ( see table [ tab : cn ] ) .",
    "these contributions , @xmath144 , were calculated as follows : @xmath145 where @xmath146 = @xmath147^{1/2}$ ] is the norm of the angular @xmath55 functions .",
    "it is clear that the @xmath148 dipole - dipole interaction dominates the potential by at least one order of magnitude , followed by the electrostatic dipole - quadrupole term .",
    "the main second order term is the isotropic @xmath142 interaction , which , at 30 @xmath33 , is still larger than the electrostatic @xmath149 terms .",
    "the fact that the fitted @xmath150 and @xmath143 coefficients give the largest contributions in first and second order , respectively , indicates that the fit is not only numerical , but also physically meaningful .",
    "thus , we may safely extrapolate the potential from 30 @xmath33 to larger @xmath18 values .",
    "figure [ fig : vfitlr ] shows the @xmath18-dependence of the fitted rccsd(t ) potential for two specific orientations ( @xmath151 ) . for the linear geometry , with @xmath152 = @xmath153 , the leading dipole - dipole interaction is maximally attractive , while for @xmath154 = @xmath155 the dipole - dipole term is zero .",
    "it can be seen that the @xmath150 coefficient dominates the long - range potential beyond @xmath156 @xmath33 .",
    "figure [ fig : vfitlr ] also compares the total long - range expansion with the _ ab initio _ data , illustrating the region of validity of eq .",
    "( [ eq : vlr ] ) .",
    "it should be noted that , on the scale of the figure , the short - range expansion of eq .",
    "( [ eq : lll ] ) is indistinguishable from the total fitted potential of eq .",
    "( [ eq : vtot ] ) , and thus the short - range expansion is not explicitly shown . the long - range fit is very accurate for intermolecular distances larger than 8 @xmath33 , which suggests that short - range ( exchange and charge penetration ) effects are only significant for @xmath157 @xmath33 .",
    "this also justifies our choice of switching the potential from the short - range to the long - range expansion between 8 and 12 @xmath33 .",
    "although the @xmath137 , 1 , and 2 potentials obtained in this work are very similar to those reported by dhont _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , there are some notable differences at very short intermolecular distances .",
    "the differences are most pronounced at @xmath18 = 4.0 @xmath33 , where the potentials exhibit the highest anisotropy .",
    "figure [ fig : vfit_q4a0 ] compares the two fit results for the quintet state as a function of @xmath22 and @xmath23 , with @xmath18 = 4.0 @xmath33 and @xmath158 .",
    "note that both surfaces were obtained from the same set of _ ab initio _ data .",
    "the fit of ref.@xcite shows more oscillatory behavior than our present result , in particular near ( @xmath41 ) = ( @xmath159 ) and ( @xmath160 ) .",
    "furthermore , the potential of dhont _ _ et al.__has a local maximum around ( @xmath161 ) that is clearly unphysical in nature .",
    "similar patterns are found for the triplet and singlet states , as can be seen in figs .",

    "the @xmath137 and 1 potentials of ref .",
    "@xcite exhibit more pronounced oscillations and local maxima , indicating more unphysical behavior .",
    "we therefore conclude that , in addition to the more accurate long - range potential , the fit of the short - range nh ",
    "nh potentials is also improved in the present work .",
    "we have constructed four - dimensional potential energy surfaces for the singlet , triplet , and quintet states of nh(@xmath0 ) ",
    "nh(@xmath0 ) based on high - level _ ab initio _ calculations .",
    "all potentials were fitted in terms of coupled spherical harmonics in the angular coordinates , and the long range was further expanded as a power series in @xmath3 . prior to fitting , the _ ab initio _ data were corrected for a size - consistency error of @xmath4 @xmath5 occurring at the rccsd(t ) level of theory .",
    "the fitted long - range coefficients were found to be in good agreement with the results obtained from first and second - order perturbation theory .",
    "future work is planned to study the evaporative cooling process of nh , which requires knowledge of elastic and inelastic cross sections at ( ultra)low temperatures .",
    "rate constants and cross sections for ( cold ) reactive nh + nh collisions will also be calculated .",
