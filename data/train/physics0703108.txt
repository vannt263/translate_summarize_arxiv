    "this year is the centenary of the 1905 einstein _ agnus mirabilis _  @xcite . in that year",
    "he published five important papers for the future of the physics .",
    "one of them  @xcite was about the photoelectric effect , and for it einstein won the 1921 nobel prize in physics ; two of them  @xcite were about statistic mechanics , and the others two on what was later known as the special theory of relativity .",
    "the first of those papers  @xcite , _ on the electrodynamic of moving bodies _ , was published on june 30 , and contains the basic theory of special relativity . in that paper",
    "he proved the relativistic formula of addition of velocities .",
    "this formula shows _",
    "`` that the velocity of the light @xmath1 can not be altered by addition with a velocity less than the light '' _ ( see  @xcite , p.51 ) , and therefore he solved the problem motivated by the fact _ `` that light is always propagated in empty space with a definite velocity @xmath1 which is independent of the state of motion of the emitting body '' _ ( see  @xcite , p.38 ) .",
    "three months later he published : _",
    "`` does the inertia of a body depend upon its energy - content ? ''",
    "_  @xcite . in that paper",
    "he concluded that _",
    "`` the mass of a body is a measure of its energy content''_. this led to the famous formula @xmath0 . in this paper",
    "we reverse in some sense the logic of the expository order of those papers .",
    "our basic physical assumptions are :    \\(i ) the mass - energy equivalence relation , ( ii ) the energy conservation law , ( iii ) the momentum conservation law , ( iv ) the special relativity principle . from these assumptions",
    "we show how can be deduced the relativistic formula of addition of velocities , and then the _ lorentz transformations_(lt ) .",
    "to simplify our exposition we choose the _ standard _ coordinates @xmath2 and @xmath3 in two arbitrary _ inertial frames_(if ) @xmath4 and @xmath5 , in the _ standard configuration _ , that is , the @xmath5 origin moves with velocity * v * along the @xmath6-axis of @xmath4 , the @xmath7-axis coincides with the @xmath6-axis , while the @xmath8- and @xmath9-axes remain parallel , as do the @xmath10- and @xmath11-axes ; and all clocks are set to zero when the two origins meet ( see  @xcite , p. 43 ) .",
    "we have assumed the _ special relativity principle_(srp ) , and it is well known that from the srp follows the homogeneity and isotropy of all the if , but as it is noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , p. 40",
    ", it is perhaps less well known that , conversely , the homogeneity and isotropy of all the if imply the srp .",
    "now @xmath12 and @xmath13 follow by assuming that the transformation between if is linear and the srp holds .",
    "in fact , linearity follows from newton s first law and temporal and spatial homogeneity ( see ref .",
    "@xcite , p. 43 ) .",
    "our starting point will be the equivalence between mass and energy , that is , @xmath0 , where @xmath14 is the energy content of one _ particle _",
    ", @xmath1 is the vacuum velocity of the light , and @xmath15 is the _ inertial mass _ of the particle , which is given by @xmath16 , where @xmath17 in an if of reference in which the particle moves with velocity @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) , and @xmath20 is the rest mass of the particle",
    ". the relativistic momentum is given by @xmath21 .",
    "consider a massless box , which contains two particles , 1 and 2 , with equal rest mass @xmath20 , moving along a straight line with speeds @xmath22 and @xmath18 respectively , in the if @xmath4 in which the box is at rest , so @xmath4 is the _ zero - momentum frame _ (  @xcite , p.117 ) .",
    "we will calculate now the total energy and the total momentum of the system of the two particles in the frame @xmath5 by two different ways : one by considering the system as a unique _ box - particle _ @xmath23 , whose rest mass @xmath24 is a measure of the energy content of the box , and the other by considering the system as two separated particles .    in the first case",
    "the total energy of @xmath23 in the frame @xmath5 is given by @xmath25 , and by use of the einstein s assumption that @xmath24 is a measure of the energy content of the box @xmath23 , @xmath26 , so @xmath27 .",
    "in the same way the momentum of @xmath23 in @xmath5 is given by @xmath28 .",
    "in the second case @xmath29 , and @xmath30 , where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are respectively the velocities of the particles 1 and 2 in the frame @xmath5 . comparing the energy @xmath14 and the momentum @xmath33 calculated by the two ways we obtain : @xmath34     of the _",
    "box - particle _ @xmath23 is the sum of the energy of the two particles 1 and 2 . to find the addition of the parallel velocities @xmath18 and",
    "@xmath35 , we calculate the total energy and the total momentum in @xmath5 by two ways : as one unique particle @xmath23 and as two separated particles 1 and 2 . ]    [ criadofig1 ]    we will find now the formula of addition of the velocities @xmath18 and @xmath35 for the cases in which they are parallel or perpendicular . in the following it is assumed that coordinate transformations between if include all rigid motions in the 3-space , in particular rotations and space - reflections which are the transformations used in this paper .",
    "consider that the particles 1 and 2 of the massless box move along the @xmath6-axis ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "this configuration is invariant under rotations about @xmath6-axis in @xmath4 , and then from the srp this configuration must be invariant under rotations about @xmath7-axis in @xmath5 too .",
    "that follows from the fact that the rotations about @xmath6-axis commute with the transformation between the if @xmath4 and @xmath5 , because in the _ standard configuration _ the @xmath7-axis coincides with the @xmath6-axis . from",
    "that it follows that @xmath31 and @xmath32 have both the direction of the @xmath7-axis and so we can denote them by @xmath36 and @xmath37  .",
    "moreover , if we take @xmath38 and use as new variables the rapidities @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 defined by @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 , the eqs .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) become : @xmath47 @xmath48    dividing member by member eq .",
    "[ eq:3 ] by eq .",
    "[ eq:2 ] , we get @xmath49 , and then @xmath50 .",
    "comparing with eq .",
    "[ eq:2 ] we get @xmath51 , and then @xmath52",
    ". therefore , @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "finally we obtain the following expression for the velocity of particle 1 : @xmath55 and , similarly , for particle 2 : @xmath56    these last equations are precisely the formulas of addition of velocities when @xmath18 and @xmath35 are parallel .       and @xmath35 .",
    "]    [ criadofig2 ]    we shall now study the case of @xmath18 being perpendicular to @xmath35 . in this case",
    "we consider that the particles 1 and 2 of the massless box move along the @xmath8-axis ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "in this configuration both particles have coordinate @xmath57 for any time @xmath58 in @xmath4 . then @xmath59 ( because @xmath13 ) for both particles and for any time @xmath60 in @xmath5 .",
    "this implies that @xmath31 and @xmath32 must be in the plane @xmath61 .",
    "since the configuration is invariant under the reflection @xmath62 in @xmath4 , and this reflection commute with the transformation between the if @xmath4 and @xmath5 , then the configuration in @xmath5 must be invariant under the reflection @xmath63 .",
    "this implies that @xmath31 and @xmath32 must be in the plane @xmath61 . on the other hand",
    ", the invariance under @xmath63 implies that @xmath64 and the angle between @xmath31 and the @xmath7-axis , @xmath65 , is the opposite to the angle between @xmath32 and the @xmath7-axis .",
    "then @xmath66 , @xmath67 .",
    "now from eqs .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) we get : @xmath68 therefore @xmath69 , and from the first equation of  ( [ eq:1 ] ) it follows that @xmath70 .",
    "this last formula in velocity parameters is @xmath71 . using the expression of @xmath72 obtained from this formula",
    "we finally obtain : @xmath73 and @xmath74 these equations correspond to the formulas of addition of the perpendicular velocities @xmath18 and @xmath35 .",
    "[ criadofig2 ]    we will now get the general formulas for the transformation of the components of the velocities in a change of reference frame . to this end , consider the collision of two particles 1 and 2 , with the same rest mass @xmath75 , and with orthogonal velocities @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "let @xmath78 be the rest mass of the particle 3 resulting from the collision , and @xmath79 its velocity in an if @xmath4 ( see fig .  3 ) .",
    "we also denote by @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 the corresponding velocities in the frame @xmath5 that moves with velocity @xmath35 along the direction of @xmath76 . using the conservation of the energy and the momentum we get : @xmath83 @xmath84 from this we get : @xmath85 , and",
    "a similar expression follows for @xmath82 .    from the results of sections  [",
    "sec : level3 ] and  [ sec : level4 ] , it follows that @xmath86 , and @xmath87 .",
    "finally , an easy calculation using the well - known relations @xmath88 and @xmath89 ( see  @xcite , p. 69 ) gives the expected formulas : @xmath90 @xmath91 observe that , equivalently , the above calculation can be done considering the movement of the center of mass of the system .",
    "the lorentz transformations can be obtained from the transformation of velocities if we assume the srp . to see this , choose as above the _ standard _ coordinates @xmath2 and @xmath3 in two arbitrary if @xmath4 and @xmath5 , in the _ standard configuration_. consider a particle moving with uniform velocity from the spacial origin for time zero to the point @xmath92 for time @xmath58 in the frame @xmath4 , so its velocity in @xmath4 is given by : @xmath93 .",
    "let @xmath3 the the associated coordinates to @xmath94 in @xmath5 .",
    "as it has been noted in the first paragraph of section  [ sec : level2 ] , from the srp , it follows that @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the velocity in @xmath5 is given by @xmath95 .",
    "if we now use the formulas  ( [ eq11 ] ) and  ( [ eq12 ] ) of transformation of velocities we get : @xmath96 @xmath97 now , since @xmath12 and @xmath98 , we get : @xmath99 the homogeneity and isotropy of all the if implies that these transformations are valid for the coordinates @xmath2 associated to any _ event _ in @xmath4 .",
    "thus we have found _ the standard lorentz transformation equations_.",
    "we have proved that the law of addition of velocities can be obtained from @xmath0 , the conservation of energy and momentum , and the srp . moreover , the lorentz transformations are obtained immediately from the law of addition of velocities and the srp .",
    "thus , taking @xmath0 and the conservation of energy and momentum , together with the srp as the starting principles of special relativity , is a possible option .",
    "in fact , the relation between energy and inertial mass was pointed out in some particular cases 24 years before einstein s fundamental paper  .",
    "moreover , @xmath0 can be considered as an extension of the first principle of the thermodynamic , and as such , a good principle for the foundation of any theory .",
    "however we have to accept that although the derivation of the lt in this paper is logically interesting , it presupposes ad hoc the strongly counterintuitive assumptions of the mass - energy and mass - velocity relations .",
    "therefore , it makes little sense as a means to conceive the lt ( in other words , the premises from which the lt follows are conceptually equally complicated with their consequence , namely the lt ) .",
    "consequently , it is didactically of limited interest .",
    "we also note that if we take the terms in @xmath100 and @xmath101 in the power - series expansion of the total energy , @xmath27 , of the compound particle b , we get the newtonian total energy of b. then , the same reasoning of this paper leads , as it is expected , to the galileo transformations via the galileo addition of velocities  .",
