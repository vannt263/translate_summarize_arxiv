    "one of the great problems in modern biology is to understand how the intrinsic diversity of cellular behaviors is shaped by factors outside of the genome .",
    "the causes of this heterogeneity are spread across multiple scales , from noise in biochemical reaction networks through epigenetic mechanisms like dna methylation and histone modification  @xcite .",
    "it might be natural to expect heterogeneity at the cellular level because of the bewildering array of time and length scales associated with the molecules of life that govern cell function .",
    "surprisingly , even at the level of individual biomolecules , diversity in functional properties like rates of enzymatic catalysis  @xcite or receptor - ligand binding  @xcite can occur .",
    "this diversity arises from the presence of many distinct functional states in the free energy landscape , which correspond to long - lived active conformations of the biomolecule .",
    "though the reigning paradigm in proteins and nucleic acids has been a single , folded native structure , well separated in free energy from any other conformations , possibilities about rugged landscapes with multiple native states have been explored for a long time  @xcite . yet only with the revolutionary advances in single molecule experimental techniques in recent years have we been able to gather direct evidence of functional heterogeneity , in systems ranging from protein enzymes  @xcite and nucleic acids  @xcite , to molecular motors  @xcite and cell adhesion complexes  @xcite . as research inevitably moves toward larger macromolecular systems , the examples of functional heterogeneity will only multiply .",
    "we thus need to develop theories that can deduce aspects of the hidden kinetic network of states underlying the single molecule experimental data  @xcite , allowing us to quantify the nature and extent of the heterogeneity .",
    "the focus in this study is single molecule force spectroscopy , conducted either by afm or optical tweezers , which constitutes an extensive experimental literature over the last two decades .",
    "our contention is that evidence of heterogeneity is widespread in this literature , but has gone largely unnoticed , since researchers ( with a few exceptions , discussed below  @xcite ) did not recognize the markers in their data that indicated heterogeneous behavior .",
    "to remedy this situation , we introduce a universal approach to analyzing distributions of rupture / unfolding forces collected in pulling experiments , which yields a single non - dimensional parameter @xmath1 .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath2 characterizes the extent of the disorder in the underlying ensemble , the ruggedness of the free energy landscape .",
    "moreover , our method provides a way of estimating bounds on key timescales , describing both the fast local equilibration in each well ( distinct system state ) of our rugged landscape , and the slow interconversion between the various wells .",
    "after verifying the validity of our approach using synthetic data generated from a heterogeneous model system , we survey ten experimental datasets , comprising a diverse set of biomolecular systems from simple dna oligomers to large complexes of proteins and nucleic acids .",
    "the largest values of @xmath2 in our survey , indicating the strongest heterogeneity , come from systems involving nucleic acids alone or protein / nucleic acid interactions , supporting the hypothesis that nucleic acid free energy landscapes are generally more rugged than those involving only proteins  @xcite .",
    "our theory thus provides a powerful new analytical tool , for the first time allowing a broad comparison of functional heterogeneity among different biomolecules through a common experimental protocol .",
    ", there is a instantaneous rupture rate @xmath3 describing transitions between n and the unfolded / unbound ensemble u. b ) schematic free energy landscape of a heterogeneous system with multiple functional states .",
    "each functional ensemble @xmath4 will have a state - dependent adiabatic rupture rate @xmath5 . assuming the states are roughly equally probable in equilibrium",
    ", there will be a single overall rate @xmath6 for interconversion between the various states . ]    _ force spectroscopy for a pure , adiabatic system : _ as a starting point , consider a generic free energy landscape for a biomolecular system with a single functional state ( fig .",
    "1a ) subject to an increasing time - dependent external force @xmath7 . for a molecular complex ,",
    "the functional basin of attraction in the landscape would correspond to an ensemble of bound conformations with similar energies , which we label n. for the case of single molecule folding , this would be the unique native ensemble .",
    "the force is applied through an experimental apparatus like an afm or optical tweezer , typically connected to the biomolecule through protein or nucleic acid linkers of known stiffness .",
    "the apparatus is pulled at a constant velocity @xmath8 , leading to a force ramp with slope @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the effective stiffness of the setup ( linkers plus the afm cantilever or optical trap ) .",
    "this @xmath10 may in general depend on the force , particularly for the afm setup , where the cantilever stiffness is often comparable to or greater than that of the molecular construct .",
    "so we also define a characteristic stiffness @xmath11 which we set to the mean @xmath10 over the range of forces probed in the experiment ( though the precise value of @xmath11 is not important ) .",
    "this allows us to introduce a characteristic force loading rate @xmath12 proportional to the velocity , @xmath13 .",
    "if at time @xmath14 the system starts in n , the force ramp tilts the landscape along the extension coordinate .",
    "if we model the conformational dynamics of the system as diffusion within this landscape , the tilting eventually leads to a transition out of n , associated with unbinding of the complex or unfolding of the molecule ( an ensemble of states we call u ) .",
    "we let @xmath15 be the survival probability for loading rate @xmath12 , in other words the probability that the transition to u has not occurred by time @xmath16 .",
    "the distribution of first rupture times is then @xmath17 , and the mean rupture rate @xmath18 is just the inverse of the average rupture time , @xmath19^{-1 } = \\left[\\int_0^\\infty dt\\,\\sigma_r(t)\\right]^{-1},\\ ] ] where we have used integration by parts and assumed that rupture always occurs if we wait long enough , @xmath20 .",
    "the behavior of @xmath15 at different @xmath12 depends on how @xmath18 compares to two other intrinsic rates .",
    "the first is the equilibration rate @xmath21 in the n well , or how quickly the system samples the configurations of the functional ensemble . for a single , smooth well with mean curvature @xmath22 and a diffusion constant @xmath23 , this rate is on the order of @xmath24 , where @xmath25 .",
    "the second is a critical rate @xmath26 , which describes how quickly the force reaches a critical force scale for rupture @xmath27 . here @xmath28 is the energy scale of the barrier that needs to be overcome for the n to u transition at zero force , and @xmath29 the extension difference between the n well minimum and the transition state . for @xmath30 the landscape is tilted sufficiently that the barrier becomes insignificant , and rupture occurs quickly ( on a diffusion - limited time scale ) . if @xmath31 , the system is in the adiabatic regime .",
    "the force ramp is sufficiently slow that rupture occurs before the critical force is reached , and equilibration is fast enough that the system can reach quasi - equilibrium at the instantaneous value of the force @xmath7 at all times @xmath16 before the rupture .",
    "if the adiabatic condition is satisfied , the survival probability @xmath15 obeys the kinetic equation @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the rupture rate at constant force @xmath34 . since @xmath7 is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath16 , we can change variables from @xmath16 to @xmath7  @xcite , and solve for @xmath35 , the probability that the system does not rupture before the force value @xmath34 is reached : @xmath36 interestingly , the integral inside the exponential is independent of the loading rate @xmath12 .",
    "hence for a system pulled from a single native ensemble , we can calculate the following quantity from experimental trajectories at different @xmath12 , @xmath37 and the results should collapse onto a single master curve for all @xmath12 in the adiabatic regime .",
    "when @xmath12 is sufficiently large that @xmath38 or @xmath39 , the assumption of quasi - equilibrium on a slowly changing energy landscape breaks down , and eq .",
    "no longer holds . for this fast ,",
    "non - adiabatic case  @xcite we should find that @xmath40 varies with @xmath12 , as we will explore later in more detail .",
    "_ force spectroscopy for a heterogeneous , adiabatic system : _ in a pioneering series of studies , raible and collaborators analyzed force ramp experiments for the regulatory protein expg unbinding from a dna fragment  @xcite .",
    "plotting @xmath40 ( the data reproduced in fig .",
    "6d ) , they did not find any collapse , as might be surmised from eq .",
    "this was not an artifact due to non - adiabaticity ( violation of the inequality @xmath31 ) , since the absence of collapse becomes even more pronounced at small loading rates , further into the adiabatic territory where collapse should be observed .",
    "they correctly surmised that the cause of this divergence is heterogeneity in the ensemble of states in the protein - dna complex .    to understand the behavior of @xmath40 in a heterogeneous system , let us consider the effects of a force ramp on a biomolecular free energy landscape with multiple functional states ( fig .",
    "our goal is to use @xmath40 , derived from experimental pulling trajectories , to quantify the extent of the heterogeneity and extract information about the underlying conformational dynamics .",
    "the functional states are distinct basins of attraction in the landscape , corresponding to distinct functional ensembles which we label n@xmath41 for state @xmath42 .",
    "we assume the minimum energy in each well and their overall dimensions are comparable , so that the equilibrium probabilities @xmath43 of the various states are of the same order . in this case if @xmath44 , the transition rates @xmath45 and @xmath46 are also similar from detailed balance , @xmath47 .",
    "hence we can introduce an overall scale for the interconversion rate between the different states , @xmath6 , such that @xmath48 for any @xmath44 .",
    "thus we now have two intrinsic time scales : @xmath21 for equilibration within a single n@xmath41 , and @xmath6 for transitions between distinct n@xmath41 s , where typically @xmath49 .",
    "the experimental setup is the same as above , with a loading rate @xmath12 , and a corresponding mean rupture rate @xmath18 for reaching the u ensemble .",
    "we can identify three dynamical regimes , based on the magnitude of @xmath6 . in the first regime , interconversion is slow , with @xmath50 .",
    "in the second regime , @xmath6 is comparable to @xmath18 .",
    "in fact , as we will discuss later in more detail , we will be particularly interested in the cross - over scenario where @xmath51 for some subset of the @xmath12 values in the experiment , but @xmath52 for the remainder .",
    "if this second regime is identified in an experiment , it provides a way to estimate the scale of @xmath6 . finally , in the third regime , the barriers between the n@xmath41 basins of attraction are small , such that @xmath53 , and the system can sample all the states before rupture .",
    "qualitatively , this scenario is indistinguishable from the case of a system with a single native basin of attraction , with @xmath6 taking the role of @xmath21 as the rate scale for overall equilibration in the landscape .",
    "since the first regime is simpler to treat mathematically than the second regime , we will initially focus on a theory to describe the first regime and identify its signatures in experimental data .",
    "assessing the validity of this theory in experiments will turn out to be a useful criterion for distinguishing between the first , second , and third regimes , and thus putting bounds on @xmath6 .",
    "this byproduct of our theory is of considerable importance because it is _ a priori _ very difficult to estimate @xmath6 .    to begin , consider adiabatic pulling where @xmath6 is the slowest rate in the system , @xmath54 . on the time scale of pulling and rupture ,",
    "the system is effectively trapped in a heterogeneous array of states : if we start a pulling trajectory in state @xmath42 , the system will remain in that state until rupture .",
    "the rupture rate at constant force , @xmath5 will in general depend on the state , and the ensemble of molecules from which we pull will be characterized by a set of initial state probabilities @xmath55 .",
    "if @xmath6 is extremely small , such that the system can not interconvert even on the macroscopic time scales of experimental preparation , @xmath55 may be different from @xmath43 , since we are not guaranteed to draw from an equilibrium distribution across the entire landscape .",
    "this distinction is not important for the analysis below .",
    "in fact , our approach also works when @xmath56 , corresponding to the quenched disorder limit , as seen for example in an ensemble of molecules with covalent chemical differences .    the analogue of eq .",
    "[ e2 ] for the survival probability @xmath35 during adiabatic pulling in a heterogeneous system with small @xmath6 is @xmath57 where the brackets denote an average over the initial ensemble of states , @xmath58 for any quantity @xmath59 .",
    "the associated @xmath40 from eq .   can be expressed through a cumulant expansion in terms of the integrand @xmath60 as follows : @xmath61 the first two cumulants are @xmath62 and @xmath63 . in the absence of heterogeneity , all cumulants @xmath64 with @xmath65 are exactly zero . for a small degree of heterogeneity , or equivalently for sufficiently fast loading rates",
    "@xmath12 , the main contribution to the expansion is from the @xmath66 and @xmath67 terms . for the case of fast @xmath12",

    "up to order @xmath67 , and also has the nice property that it satisfies the inequality @xmath74 , just like the exact form .",
    "the latter inequality follows from the definition of @xmath35 in eq .   and jensen s inequality , @xmath75 .    _ implementing the model on experimental data : _ so far the discussion has been completely general , but to fit eq .   to experimental data we need specific forms for @xmath76 and @xmath77 . the minimal physically sensible approximation , with the smallest number of unknown parameters , supplements eq .   with the assumptions ,",
    "@xmath78 the constants @xmath2 , @xmath79 , and @xmath29 are fitting parameters .",
    "this presumes that @xmath76 changes little over the range of forces in the data , and @xmath77 has the same mathematical form as in a pure bell model with an escape rate @xmath80 and @xmath81 , where @xmath79 is the escape rate at zero force and @xmath29 the distance to the transition state . for a heterogeneous system , the parameters @xmath79 and @xmath29 no longer have this simple interpretation , but we can still treat them as effective bell values , averaged over the ensemble , with @xmath2 measuring the overall scale of the heterogeneity .",
    "eq .  , together with the three - parameter approximation of eq",
    ".  , provides remarkably accurate fits to all the heterogeneous experimental data sets we have encountered in the literature . as will be seen below",
    ", it is capable of simultaneously fitting @xmath40 data for loading rates @xmath12 spanning nearly two orders of magnitude .",
    "though we focus on @xmath40 as the main experimental quantity of interest , eqs .  - can also be used to derive a closed form expression for the probability distribution of rupture forces , @xmath82 , at loading rate @xmath12 : @xmath83 in the limit of no heterogeneity , @xmath84 , this distribution reduces to the one predicted for a bell model under a constant loading rate  @xcite .",
    "the theoretical form for @xmath85 also allows us to carry out a relative likelihood analysis on the experimental data , to verify that @xmath2 is indeed a robust indicator of heterogeneity . as detailed in si sec .",
    "6 , we found that experimental distributions @xmath85 corresponding to systems with nonzero @xmath2 were far more likely to be described by the heterogeneous theory in eq .   than a pure model with the same number of parameters .",
    "we surmise that if analysis of experimental data using our theory indicates that @xmath86 then it is highly probable that any single state model is insufficient to describe the system , and a multiple state description is needed .    to verify that our analysis and conclusions would not change substantially if the assumptions of the minimal model were relaxed , we have also tested two generalized versions of the model : one using the dudko - hummer - szabo  @xcite instead of the bell form for the escape rate in @xmath77 , and the other allowing @xmath76 to vary linearly with @xmath34 across the force range .",
    "both extensions have four instead of three fitting parameters , but the heterogeneity results for the experimental systems we analyzed are completely consistent with those obtained using the minimal model ( see supplementary information ( si ) sec .  1 for details ) .",
    "these results demonstrate that if the need arises in future experimental contexts , the theory leading to eq .",
    "is quite general , and can be tailored by choosing suitable expressions for @xmath77 and @xmath76 that go beyond the minimal model of eq .  .",
    "the theory described up to now applies only to the first dynamical regime , where @xmath50 .",
    "however the cases where @xmath6 is larger than some or all of the @xmath18 , and the theory partially or completely fails , turn out to be very informative as well .",

    "can the theory in eqs .  - fit a pure system over a range of non - adiabatic @xmath12 , and yield a non - zero fitted value of @xmath2 that would incorrectly indicate the presence of heterogeneity ?",
    "to rule out the possibility of such a false positive , we simulated the fbl model system above , without any heterogeneity ( @xmath152 ) , over a much larger range of loading rates @xmath12 , and plotted the results of @xmath40 in fig .  4 on a logarithmic scale for @xmath153 pn / s .",

    "is originally gathered as time traces of the applied force .",
    "the rupture or unfolding event in each trace is identified as a large drop in the force when using afm ( or a large increase in the end - to - end distance using optical tweezers ) , a signature easily detected due to its high signal - to - noise ratio . the value of the force immediately before the drop is then recorded . from hundreds of such traces , the experimentalists",

    "the largest value of @xmath18 among all the @xmath12 for a given experiment is shown in the bar chart of fig .  5f .",
    "as mentioned above in discussing the tc scenario , the maximum observed value of @xmath18 provides a lower bound for both @xmath21 and @xmath6 .",
    "the local equilibration rate @xmath21 defines an intrinsic time scale whether or not the system is heterogeneous , but the slower interconversion rate @xmath6 exists as a distinct time scale only when there is a heterogeneous ensemble of states with sufficiently large energy barriers between them . observing collapse of @xmath40 over a range of @xmath12 does not absolutely rule out heterogeneity , but it does constrain the possible values of @xmath6 .",
    "the two systems in fig .",
    "5 with the strongest constraints on @xmath6 ( the largest lower bounds ) are a and c , where any @xmath6 ( or @xmath21 ) must be @xmath168 .",
    "this is not surprising , since a is a single , compact protein domain , and c is a tight antibody complex . for these systems , where specificity of the interactions stabilizing the functional state is of a prime importance ,",
    "significant heterogeneity is unlikely , since it would require at least two conformational states involving substantially different sets of interactions . for the more general category of enzyme - substrate or receptor - ligand complexes ( which encompasses systems b and d in fig .  5 and all but one of the systems in fig .  6 ) , specificity may not always be the most important factor .",
    "conformational heterogeneity among bound complexes could play crucial biological roles , as a part of enzymatic regulation or signaling .",
    "system d of fig .",
    "5 presents an intriguing case , since force ramp experiments on the a1-gpib@xmath42 complex show evidence of two bound conformational states : a weaker bound state , from which the system is more likely to rupture at small forces ( @xmath169 pn ) , and a more strongly bound state , predominating at larger forces  @xcite .",
    "the interconversion rates between the states could not be measured , but based on fitting the ramp data to a two - state model are estimated to be on the order of @xmath170 .",
    "however the four experimental pulling velocities are so slow that the mean rupture rate at the highest velocity ( @xmath171 nm / s ) is only 0.16 s@xmath0 .",
    "hence , if the two states do exist , they get averaged out over the timescale of rupture , leading to a set of @xmath40 curves that are collapsed .",
    "we can thus make a prediction for this particular system  assuming the two - state picture is reasonable and that both states are populated in the ensemble of complexes at the start of the force ramp .",
    "if the measurements were extended to velocities significantly above 40 nm / s , where rupture could occur on average before interconversion , the expanded data set should exhibit pc of the @xmath40 curves . as in the middle panel of fig .",

    "3b , with the corresponding @xmath2 for the full data indicated as horizontal dashed lines . as is expected for the nc regime , the @xmath124 do not vary significantly with rupture rate , and are consistent with @xmath2 in each case .",
    "the three largest values of @xmath2 ( fig .",
    "6c - e ) correspond to bonds composed of nucleic acid base - pairing or protein / nucleic acid interactions .",
    "this significant heterogeneity may reflect the tendency for free energy landscapes involving nucleic acids to be more intrinsically rugged .",
    "however it is not necessarily the case that all nucleic acid systems are heterogeneous ( the _ bso_bi - dna complex of fig .",
    "5b and the rna hairpin of fig .",

    "6 was collected using afm pulling experiments , in contrast to fig .  5 , where panels b , d , and e were optical trap results ( the rest being afm ) .",
    "it is thus worthwhile to wonder whether aspects of the afm experimental setup could affect the heterogeneity analysis . in si sec .",
    "5 we have analyzed possible errors from several sources : the finite force resolution of afm cantilever , the non - negligible hydrodynamic drag on the cantilever at large pulling speeds ( > 1 @xmath175 m/s )  @xcite , uncertainties arising from finite sampling of the rupture force distributions , and the apparatus response time . based on this error analysis",
    ", we conclude that the estimation of the heterogeneity parameter @xmath2 from the experimental data is reliable in all the systems of fig .",
    "the observed heterogeneity must therefore be an intrinsic aspect to the biomolecules , rather than an artifact of the afm experiment .",
    "the fidelity of the theoretical fits to the data in fig .  6 ( with no signs of pc ) means all the experiments were in the heterogeneous , adiabatic regime .",
    "thus the range of observed @xmath18 allows us to place upper bounds on @xmath6 and lower bounds on @xmath21 , which are plotted in the bar chart of fig .",
    "there is a clear separation of time scales , with all the upper bounds on @xmath176 s@xmath0 , and the lower bounds on @xmath177 s@xmath0 .",
    "the slow interconversion rates @xmath6 in these systems are remarkable , particularly the dna oligomer in fig .",

    "the rupture force distributions for the dna unzipping were earlier fit to a specific model of dynamic disorder in ref .",
    "@xcite , where force - dependent rates of conformational fluctuations were extracted .",
    "the range of these estimated rates ( @xmath178 s@xmath0 ) are consistent with the upper bound derived from the current analysis , @xmath179 s@xmath0 .",
    "however , we must keep in mind that  unless pc is observed , pinpointing the scale of @xmath6our analysis can not distinguish between a heterogeneous system characterized by dynamic disorder with slow @xmath6 and one with quenched disorder ( @xmath180 ) caused by covalent chemical differences among the experimental samples .    the ran - imp@xmath172 system in fig .",
    "6b provides an interesting counterpart to the a1-gpib@xmath42 complex discussed earlier . as in that example ,",
    "the system is believed to exhibit two bound conformations with different adhesion strengths  @xcite .",
    "this is also supported by evidence of conformational variability in the crystal structure of a truncated imp@xmath172 bound to ran - gppnhp , where two versions of the molecular complex were observed , characterized by substantially different sets of interactions  @xcite .",
    "the bound conformations are expected to dynamically interconvert , but the timescale has not been measured .",
    "our analysis of the existing data provides an upper bound on the rate , @xmath181 s@xmath0 .",
    "we predict that further experiments could fix the rate more precisely : for example , by going to pulling velocities slower than @xmath182 nm / s ( the slowest @xmath8 in the current dataset ) , we may be able to observe pc , like in the middle panel in fig .  2d , establishing the scale of @xmath6 .",
    "this is opposite of the prescription we gave above for the a1-gpib@xmath42 complex , where the existing experiments have been too slow rather than too fast .",
    "our theory thus provides a guide for experimentalists to fine - tune their parameters to extract the most information possible from the system under study .",
    "we envision that our approach will become one part of a larger , comprehensive experimental toolbox for investigating heterogeneity in biomolecules : it can test for and quantify heterogeneity based on the rupture force distributions , but these distributions do not contain all the information we would like to know about a system .",
    "a large @xmath2 parameter indicates that there are multiple states in the intact / folded part of the free energy landscape , and that these states must interconvert on timescales slower than the mean rupture time . to extract additional details , like the precise number of functional states , requires using other experimental / analytical techniques , like single - molecule fret",
    "one recent example where this was demonstrated was the @xmath183-means clustering algorithm applied by hyeon",
    "_ et al . _",
    "@xcite to estimate the number of interconverting states from single - molecule fret trajectories of a simple nucleic acid construct , the holliday junction . in principle",
    ", this approach could be extended to folding trajectories obtained in constant force experiments , which in conjunction with the distribution of rupture forces could be used to extract the number of distinct functional states .",
    "our work introduces a generic method for characterizing heterogeneity in biomolecules using rupture force distributions from force spectroscopy experiments .",
    "the central result is a single non - dimensional parameter @xmath1 .",
    "a system with no measurable heterogeneity on the timescale of the pulling experiment has @xmath184 . when @xmath185 , its magnitude characterizes the degree of the disorder . both in the presence and absence of heterogeneity , the method yields bounds on the local equilibration rate @xmath21 within a system state , and ( if heterogeneity is present ) the rate of interconversion @xmath6 between states .",
    "the practical value of our approach is demonstrated by analyzing nine previous experiments , allowing us to classify a broad range of biomolecular systems .",
    "the five cases where heterogeneity was observed are all the more striking given the persistence of their conformational states , with upper bounds on @xmath176 s@xmath0 .",
    "our theory leads to a proposal for future experimental studies : searching for a range of pulling speeds where the data exhibits the property of partial collapse , allowing for a more accurate determination of @xmath6 .",
    "this pc scenario did not occur among the data sets we considered , though in two cases ( the protein complexes a1-gpib@xmath42 and ran - imp@xmath172 ) we predict that extending the range of pulling velocities would very likely result in pc .",
    "the global energy landscapes of multi - domain protein and nucleic acid systems are essential guides to their biological function , but are quite difficult to map out in the laboratory .",
    "this is particularly true for systems where the ruggedness of the landscape creates a host of long - lived , functional states .",
    "the theory described here suggests new ways in which single molecule pulling experiments can be used to obtain information about internal dynamics of systems with functionally heterogeneous states .",
