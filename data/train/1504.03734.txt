    "the saffman - taylor or viscous fingering ( vf ) instability , which occurs when a less viscous fluid is injected into a more viscous fluid , is a classical hydrodynamic instability phenomena @xcite .",

    "vf has also been used as an effective mechanism to enhance the mixing of two fluids in a micro channel @xcite .",

    "the main mathematical challenge arises in the linear stability analysis ( lsa ) of miscible vf due to the unsteady base state .",
    "thus , to analyze its lsa one needs to solve a non - autonomous system of the linearized differential operators . for the time - periodic problems one can invoke the floquet - theory @xcite . but in an arbitrary time - dependent problem , farrell and",
    "ioannou @xcite observed that the disturbances can no longer be set proportional to @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the growth rate . as a result",
    ", the linear stability theory of the non - autonomous system prohibits to use normal mode analyses .",
    "the following two approaches are common in practice for analyzing the linear stability of miscible vf to find the onset of fingering : @xmath3 quasi - steady - state approximation ( qssa ) and @xmath4 initial value problem ( ivp ) . in qssa ,",
    "one reduces to an autonomous system by freezing the base state at some specific time and apply modal analysis , while in ivp approach one can find the full solution of the non - autonomous linearized problem for some representative initial conditions .",
    "tan and homsy @xcite reported that the qssa is poorly agreeing with ivp and non - linear simulations .",
    "although the ivp approach predicts the early time behavior better than qssa , there are two major challenges in this method .",
    "the first one being how large the disturbances must grow before they become observable , and the other one is the choice of representative initial condition",
    ". the chosen random initial condition may not necessarily correspond to the one that gives optimum growth of the perturbation .",
    "also , there is much disagreement on how to determine the growth of the perturbations from ivp analysis .",
    "moreover , the random initial conditions , which are supposed to be localized within the diffusive layer , perturb the system over the entire computational domain .",
    "ben _ et al . _",
    "@xcite performed an lsa for vf using a spectral analysis method in a self - similar coordinate without invoking qssa .",
    "recently , kim @xcite analyzed vf in a miscible slice and compared the predicted growth rates from qssa with those obtained using the spectral analysis .",
    "he found that the spectral analysis predicts the system to be initially unconditionally stable and becomes unstable at later times , while in contrary , qssa @xcite prediction reveals an initially unstable situation .",
    "as time progresses the predicted growth rates of the two methods get closer .",
    "a similar approach was also adopted by pramanik and mishra @xcite to study the effect of the korteweg stresses on miscible vf using a self - similar qssa ( ss - qssa ) .",
    "however , the eigenmodes obtained from both ss - qssa and qssa are non - orthogonal , which indicates the possibility for transient growth of the disturbances @xcite .",
    "it is a well - known fact that modal analysis does not address the phenomenon of transient growth in time @xcite . in particular",
    ", it depends on the spectral properties of the underlying linear operator . for a non - normal operator ( i.e. , the operator that does not commute with its adjoint ) an initial perturbation can grow in time by large factors before decaying , even if all the eigenmodes of the operator are damping .",
    "earlier observations of transient growth due to the non - normality of the linearized operators were reported in the studies of instability in parallel shear flows @xcite , many atmospheric and laboratory flows @xcite .",
