    "there is a limited but crucial number of cosmological evidences which does not fit in the scheme constituted by general relativity ( gr ) and the standard model of particle physics . on the one hand",
    ", it seems that the amount of baryonic matter in galaxies and galaxy clusters is not sufficient to cause the observed behaviour of the gravitational field on those scales . on the other hand , recent data on the sneia hubble diagram",
    "provide evidences for an accelerated expansion , also confirmed by several other independent cosmological observations @xcite .",
    "such a large dataset can be very well reproduced by the concordance @xmath1cdm model made out of cold dark matter ( cdm ) and cosmological constant @xmath1 . notwithstanding",
    "this remarkable success , the @xmath1cdm scenario is theoretically unappealing since it comprises two exotic matter sources , namely dark energy and dark matter , and is moreover plagued by several well known shortcomings .",
    "a different constructive point of view is to address these problems introducing modifications of gr over large distances in order to possibly explain our ignorance about the 95% of the energy and matter content of the universe . in this",
    "setting , a massive deformation of gr is a plausible modified theory of gravity that is both phenomenologically and theoretically intriguing .    from the theoretical point of view ,",
    "a small nonvanishing graviton mass is an open issue .",
    "the idea was originally introduced in the work of fierz and pauli @xcite , who constructed a massive theory of gravity in a flat background that is ghost - free at the linearized level . since then , a great effort has been put in extending the result at the nonlinear level and constructing a consistent theory . as a somewhat unanticipated result , we nowadays recognize that such models can be relevant for cosmology too as possible alternative candidates to drive the accelerated expansion without the need of any exotic component .    here",
    "we study cosmological solutions in the framework of a covariant massive gravity model , recently proposed in @xcite . at the linearized order ,",
    "the mass term breaks the gauge invariance of gr .",
    "moreover , in order to construct a consistent theory , nonlinear terms should be tuned to remove order by order the negative energy state in the spectrum @xcite .",
    "the theoretical model under investigation follows from a procedure originally outlined in @xcite and has been found not to show ghosts at least up to quartic order in the nonlinearities @xcite .",
    "we focus on cosmological equations of such theory , considering a spatially flat robertson - walker ( rw ) model in presence of both matter and radiation . due to the potential term ,",
    "four new terms are present in the friedmann equations mimicking dust , cosmological constant , quintessence and stiff matter . the presence of the cosmological constant and quintessence - like terms easily suggest the possibility to achieve an accelerated expansion , while the stiff matter one can guarantee the halting of the cosmic speed up in the intermediate redshift regime thus recovering the standard decelerating matter dominated epoch . in order to check whether this is indeed the case",
    ", we contrast the model predictions with a wide dataset thus also being able to constrain its parameters . as a side effect",
    ", this will also allow us to narrow down the range for the graviton mass .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "sect.ii presents the basics of the theory and put down the modified friedmann equations describing the background cosmic evolution .",
    "the data we use and some subtleties specific to the massive gravity framework are discussed in sect.iii , while the results of the likelihood analysis and the constraints on the massive gravity coupling quantities are given in sect.iv .",
    "we finally summarize and highlight some important issues in the concluding sect.v .",
    "let us consider a four dimensional manifold equipped with both a dynamical metric @xmath2 and a non - dynamical flat metric @xmath3 .",
    "in order to determine the dynamics on this structure , the starting point is to consider the following action . ]",
    "@xcite    @xmath4    where @xmath5 is the newton coupling constant , @xmath6 the ricci scalar for @xmath7 , @xmath8 the potential , and @xmath9 describes ordinary matter which is supposed to directly interact only with @xmath7 .",
    "the potential term , coupled through the graviton mass @xmath10 , is given by    @xmath11    with @xmath12 the levi - civita symbol , while the field @xmath13 is related to the flat metric @xmath3 through    @xmath14    and we have defined @xmath15 the theory is fully assigned by the graviton mass @xmath16 and the two coupling parameters @xmath17 .    in order to derive the cosmological equations , one has to insert the rw metric into the field equations obtained by the usual variational approach to the action ( [ totaction ] ) and impose the constraints dictated by the bianchi identities @xcite . for generic values of the @xmath17 couplings and a spatially flat universe consistent with cmbr data @xcite ,",
    "the expansion rate turns out to be @xcite    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is the scale factor , @xmath20 the usual hubble parameter ( with the dot denoting derivative with respect to cosmic time ) , @xmath21 and we have assumed a source term made out by dust ( @xmath22 ) and radiation ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "since matter is assumed to be minimally coupled to gravity only , its conservation equation will be the usual    @xmath24    with @xmath25 ( @xmath26 for @xmath27 @xmath28 .",
    "introducing the redshift @xmath29 , we can therefore conveniently rewrite eq.([eq : mgfried ] ) as    @xmath30    with @xmath31 ( the label @xmath32 denoting present day values ) , @xmath33 the standard present day density parameter for the component @xmath34 , while we have defined the effective density parameters for the massive gravity terms as    @xmath35    with @xmath36 and @xmath37 the present day critical density , it has the dimension of @xmath38 so that @xmath39 is dimensionless . ] .",
    "note that the @xmath40 parameters entering eq.([eq : mgfried ] ) are all dimensionless .",
    "a look at eq.([eq : hubbleend ] ) shows that a massive graviton has a double effect on the hubble rate .",
    "first , as is somewhat expected , it changes the matter content shifting the dust density parameter from the usual @xmath41 value to the effective one @xmath42 .",
    "it is , however , worth stressing that , since the sign of @xmath43 is not set from the theory , it is also possible that the effective matter content is smaller than the actual one . actually , the most interesting feature is the presence of the three further terms @xmath44 mimicking a cosmological constant , a quintessence - like field and stiff matter , respectively . depending on the values of @xmath17 and the graviton mass ,",
    "it is therefore possible to reproduce the expected series of radiation domination , matter era and accelerating expansion ( driven by both @xmath45 and @xmath46 ) with only a small contribute from the unusual stiff matter term .",
    "it is this particular feature that makes massive gravity so appealing from a cosmological point of view motivating the present analysis .    in order to constrain the model parameters ,",
    "it is actually more convenient to replace the effective density parameters with @xmath47 and @xmath48 with @xmath49 the equation of state ( eos ) of the effective dark energy model having the same hubble parameter than the massive gravity one .",
    "this quantity is defined as    @xmath50 \\nonumber \\\\ ~ & \\times & \\left [ 1 - \\frac{\\omega_m^{eff } ( 1 + z)^3}{e^2(z ) } - \\frac{\\omega_{r } ( 1 + z)^4}{e^2(z ) } \\right ] ^{-1 } \\label{eq : weff}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    so that , by using eq.([eq : hubbleend ] ) , we get    @xmath51 \\right \\}^{-1 } \\nonumber \\\\ ~ & \\times & \\left [ 3 \\omega_{\\lambda}^{eff } + 2 \\omega_q^{eff } ( 1 + z ) \\right . \\nonumber \\\\ ~ & + & \\left . \\omega_s^{eff } ( 1 + z)^2 - \\omega_{r } ( 1 + z)^4 \\right ] \\ .",
    "\\label{eq : weffmg}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    imposing now @xmath52 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , it is only a matter of algebra to get    @xmath53    @xmath54    @xmath55    using these relations , we can conveniently parameterize the model in terms of the effective matter density parameter @xmath42 and the present day values of the effective eos and its derivative @xmath56 .",
    "it is worth stressing that , depending on @xmath57 combinations , it is possible that some of the @xmath44 parameters take a negative value .",
    "this is , however , not a problem since @xmath44 refer to effective fluids , not actual ones .",
    "this can also be seen from eqs.([eq : omgeff ] ) which show that negative @xmath58 can indeed be obtained depending on the values of the massive gravity couplings @xmath17 .",
    "eq.([eq : weffmg ] ) shows that the massive gravity introduces an effective dark energy fluid whose eos has the right behaviour to drive cosmic acceleration .",
    "indeed , should the @xmath45 term be the dominant at low @xmath59 , we get @xmath60 so that a @xmath1cdm - like expansion is obtained in the late universe .",
    "as @xmath59 increases , we can still have an accelerated expansion as far as @xmath46 dominates leading to @xmath61 in the intermediate redshift regime , while the transition to a decelerating epoch is guaranteed by the stiff matter term @xmath62 .",
    "these encouraging features have to substantiated by the comparison with the available data which can both validate the model and constrain its parameters .",
    "although the dataset we are going to use is a typical one , there are some subtleties specific of the massive gravity framework which require some caution .",
    "we therefore prefer to spend some words to describe how we compare the model to the each kind of dataset .",
    "a first step in testing any proposed model is the comparison with the hubble diagram , i.e. the distance modulus @xmath63 as a function of the redshift @xmath59 .",
    "this is related to the hubble parameter @xmath64 as    @xmath65    with    @xmath66    the luminosity distance and    @xmath67    the comoving distance .",
    "note that we have collectively denoted with @xmath68 the set of model parameters .",
    "a classical tracer of the hubble diagram is represented by sneia so that we use the union2 dataset @xcite comprising @xmath69 objects tracing the hubble diagram over the redshift range @xmath70 .",

    "this is provided by grbs so that we rely on their hubble diagram as derived in @xcite based on a model independent calibration of five different scaling relations and the catalog given in @xcite .",
    "note that we cut the sample only using @xmath79 objects probing the range @xmath80 in order to avoid any residual correlations with the sneia sample ( which is used to calibrate the grbs scaling relations ) .",

    "we will marginalize over @xmath85 so that we will not give any constraint on this quantity .",
    "being a probe of the integrated hubble parameter , the sneia+grb hubble diagram smooths out the deviations from the ( unknown ) best fit model provided these are not too extreme .",
    "it is therefore desirable to add a second dataset which directly probes the @xmath64 which is indeed possible resorting to the differential age method @xcite .",
    "such a technique is motivated by noting that , from the relation @xmath86 , a measurement of @xmath87 at different @xmath59 gives , in principle , the hubble parameter .",
    "good results can be obtained by using fair samples of passively evolving galaxies with similar metallicity and low star formation rate so that they can be taken to be the oldest objects at a given @xmath59 .",
    "stern et al .",
    "@xcite have then used red envelope galaxies as cosmic chronometers determining their ages from high quality keck spectra and applied the differential age method to estimate @xmath0 over the redshift range @xmath88 @xcite .",

    "an alternative and very promising method to trace the distance - redshift relation relies on the measurement of baryon acoustic oscillations ( baos ) in the large scale clustering pattern of galaxies @xcite .",
    "baos correspond to a preferred length scale imprinted in the distribution of photons and baryons by the propagation of sound waves in the relativistic plasma of the early universe .",
    "this length scale , corresponding to the sound horizon @xmath93 at the baryon drag epoch , manifests itself in the clustering pattern of galaxies as a small preference for pairs of galaxies to be separated by @xmath93 , causing a distinctive peak in the 2-point galaxy correlation function .",
    "since the fourier transform of a @xmath94-function is a @xmath95 , this signature will look like a series of decaying oscillations in the galaxy power spectrum thus motivating the bao name .",
    "the small amplitude of the peak and the large size of the relevant scales imply that large volumes @xmath96 and a high number of galaxies @xmath97 must be observed in order to ensure a robust detection .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that the first reliable determination @xcite has to await for the third data release of the sdss survey with other determinations @xcite all relying on similarly large ( both spectroscopic and photometric ) galaxy surveys .    in order to include baos as constraint",

    "indeed , both @xmath112 and @xmath116 are related to the clustering properties of the matter so that one should investigate how clustering takes place in massive gravity to understand if it depends on the amount of either effective or actual matter . in order to be conservative ,",
    "we have decided to set @xmath121 when computing both @xmath112 and @xmath116 since the standard dust matter is the only one which surely clusters .",
    "actually , since the graviton mass is expected to be very small , we can anticipate that @xmath41 and @xmath42 will not be very different so that , should our choice be the incorrect one , the estimated @xmath112 and @xmath116 values will be biased low by a very small amount .      combining the data described above , we are able to trace the background expansion of the late and intermediate @xmath59 universe . cmbr data , on the contrary ,",

    "as shown in @xcite , rather than fitting the full cmbr anisotropy spectrum , one can get reliable and almost equivalent constraints by considering the so called distance priors , namely the redshift @xmath124 of the last scattering surface , the acoustic scale @xmath125 and the shift parameter @xmath126 @xcite    @xmath127    the cmbr likelihood function is then defined as    @xmath128 } \\nonumber \\ , \\label{eq : deflikecmbr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the @xmath129-dimensional vector @xmath130 contains the difference among observed and theoretically predicted values of @xmath131 .",

    "we stress that we set here @xmath121 , but use @xmath42 in the @xmath126 estimate .",
    "this latter choice has been motivated by the consideration that the shift parameter actually turns out by neglecting terms other than the @xmath133 in the evaluation of the distance to the last scattering surface . since the importance of this term is determined by the @xmath42 parameter , it is this quantity which must enter the @xmath126 definition .",
    "since the single datasets are independent on each other , combining all of them in a single fit is straightforward .",
    "one has only to define a full likelihood as    @xmath134    where the last term is a gaussian",
    "prior on @xmath110 given by the shoes collaboration @xcite which have determined @xmath135 from the local distance ladder .",
    "according to the above review of the data , @xmath136 will depend on the massive gravity parameters @xmath137 , the present day hubble constant @xmath110 and the physical density parameters @xmath138 of baryons , matter and radiation . in order to reduce the parameter space",
    ", we will set @xmath139 in agreement with @xcite and set the radiation density parameter as    @xmath140    with @xmath141 the effective neutrino number .",

    "it is interesting to look in detail to how the best fit model compares to the observed data to guess some hint on pro and cons of the massive gravity framework . indeed , while the low reduced @xmath163 values make us forecast that the agreement will be very good , it is nevertheless worth checking what happens for each single probe to see whether the likelihood is dominated by a single term only because of the larger uncertainties on this dataset .",

    ", we therefore solve for the @xmath143 and give the inferred constraints in table[tab : mgtab ] where we report the graviton mass @xmath164 instead of @xmath165 since the former is more interesting from a theoretical point of view .",
    "a caveat is in order here .",
    "solving for @xmath143 as function of the fitted parameters can give rise to large values of the @xmath17 couplings for particular combinations of the input quantities .",

    "these are the values reported in table[tab : mgtab ] which can be considered as a compromise between what data tell us and what is actually reasonable .",
    "it is worth stressing that the above cut has only a minor effect on the constraints on the graviton mass .",
    "until not long ago , it was thought to be impossible to construct a consistent theory of massive gravity compatible with current observations @xcite . only in 2010 ,",
    "de rham and gabadadze @xcite presented a good candidate for a ghost - free completion of the fierz - pauli theory by choosing interactions with no more than two time derivatives of the scalar degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "the cosmological sector of this theory have been recently worked out in @xcite thus setting the necessary framework to compare the model predictions with the observed universe .",
    "we have then been able to constrain the model parameters using a large dataset comprising the sneia+grb hubble diagram , @xmath0 measurements from cosmic chronometers , baos data and the cmbr distance priors .",

    ", one can only indirectly check which are the conditions they have to fulfil in order the theory be consistent . to this end , we stress that our constraints are consistent with the conditions @xmath172 and @xmath173 , but the case @xmath174 is still allowed . in both cases , the constrained parameter space refers to models which have the right properties to recover gr in the low energy limit as demonstrated by @xcite through the study of spherically symmetric solutions .",
    "we therefore end up with a massive gravity theory able to reproduce the cosmological data without altering the success of the standard general relativity on the solar system scales .    as a further relevant result ,",
    "the comparison of the theory with the cosmological data has allowed us to set a limit on the graviton mass . although an explicit derivation is needed , we can assume that , in the low energy limit , the gravitational potential will be boosted by a yukawa - like correction modulated by the length scale @xmath175 .",
    "one can then compare our results with the upper limit @xmath176 from the dynamics in the solar system @xcite and the more stringent limit , @xmath177 , derived by requiring the derived dynamical properties of a galactic disk to be consistent with observations @xcite .",
    "our @xmath156 upper limit is six orders of magnitude smaller than the latter one .",
    "we can therefore conclude that the agreement with the cosmological data leads to a massive gravity theory which has no impact on the dynamics of sytems in the low energy regime thus avoiding any difficulty in matching different scales .    finally ,",

    "<S> a covariant formulation of a theory with a massive graviton and no negative energy state has been recently proposed as an alternative to the usual general relativity framework . for a spatially flat homogenous and isotropic universe , </S>",
    "<S> the theory introduces modified friedmann equations where the standard matter term is supplemented by four effective fluids mimicking dust , cosmological constant , quintessence and stiff matter , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we test the viability of this massive gravity formulation by contrasting its theoretical prediction to the hubble diagram as traced by type ia supernovae ( sneia ) and gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) , the @xmath0 measurements from passively evolving galaxies , baryon acoustic oscillations ( baos ) from galaxy surveys and the distance priors from the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) anisotropy spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that the model is indeed able to very well fit this large dataset thus offering a viable alternative to the usual dark energy framework . </S>",
    "<S> we finally set stringent constraints on its parameters also narrowing down the allowed range for the graviton mass . </S>"
