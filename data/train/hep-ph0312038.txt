    "present evidence for neutrino masses and mixings can be summarized as : 1 ) the atmospheric @xmath11 is associated with a mixing @xmath12 close to maximal @xcite ; 2 ) the solar @xmath13 prefers the lma - msw solution @xcite ; 3 ) chooz reactor data @xcite give severe limits for @xmath14 .",
    "here , we discuss that contrary to a wide spread belief , earth effects on the propagation of atmospheric neutrinos can become observable , in detectors with lepton charge - discrimination @xcite and in water - erenkov ones @xcite , even if @xmath15 is small , yet non - vanishing .",
    "this fact could allow to determine the sign of @xmath16 and obtain more stringent constraints on the values of @xmath17 and @xmath12 .",
    "getting more precise information about the value of these mixing angles and determining the type of the neutrino mass spectrum ( with normal or inverted hierarchy ) with a higher precision is of fundamental importance for the progress in the studies of neutrino mixing .",
    "we study here the possibilities to obtain this type of information using the atmospheric neutrino data that can be provided by present and future water - erenkov detectors . for baselines",
    "@xmath18 smaller than the earth diameter , appropiate for atmospheric neutrinos , @xmath19 , so that we will neglect the ( 1,2)-oscillating phase in vacuum against the ( 2,3)-one .",
    "this is a very good aproximation for the presently best favored lma - i solution to the solar neutrino problem @xcite .",
    "the earth matter effects , which can resonantly enhance the @xmath20 and @xmath21 transitions , lead to the reduction of the rate of the multi - gev @xmath7like events and to the increase of the rate of the multi - gev @xmath8like events in a water - erenkov detector with respect to the case of absence of these transitions ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "correspondingly , as observables which are sensitive to the earth matter effects , we consider the nadir - angle distribution of the ratio @xmath22 , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the multi - gev @xmath7like and @xmath25-like numbers of events , respectively .",
    "if @xmath26 is the effective neutrino potential , in going from @xmath27 to @xmath28 , there are matter - induced cp- and cpt- odd effects associated with the change @xmath29 .",
    "the effects here discussed depend on the interference between the different flavors and on the relative sign between @xmath30 and @xmath31 . for atmospheric neutrinos , an appreciable interference will be present if and only if there are appreciable matter effects , i.e. , the `` connecting '' mixing @xmath32 between the @xmath0-flavor and the @xmath33 mass eigenstate does not vanish .    for @xmath34 ,",
    "matter effects lead to a breaking of the ( 1,2)-degeneracy such that @xmath35 coincides with @xmath0 .",
    "the net effect is that @xmath36 and @xmath37 lead to the atmospheric @xmath38 indicated by sk , likewise in vacuum the ( 2,3)-mixing does .",
    "the @xmath0-flavor decouples in matter , even if there was a large mixing in the ( 1,2)-system .",
    "no matter effects would then be expected when starting with @xmath39 , i.e. , there would be no chances to distinguish the type of mass hierarchy by these means .",
    "however , for small @xmath40 , even if the effects on the spectrum are expected to be small , there could be a substantial mixing of @xmath0 with @xmath37 .",
    "this would lead to a resonant msw behaviour in the case of neutrinos crossing only the earth mantle and to new resonant effects ( nolr ) @xcite in the case of neutrinos crossing also the earth core .",
    "but still @xmath41 .",
    "this vanishing mixing in matter is responsible for the absence of fundamental cp - violating effects , even if there are three non - degenerate mass eigenstates in matter . in vacuum ,",
    "the absence of genuine cp - odd probabilities was due to the degeneracy @xmath42 .",
    "the fluxes of atmospheric @xmath43 of energy @xmath44 , which reach the detector after crossing the earth along a given trajectory specified by the value of @xmath45 , @xmath46 , are given by the following expressions in the case of the three - neutrino oscillations under discussion @xcite :    @xmath47~p_{2\\nu}\\right ) \\label{phie}\\ ] ]    @xmath48~p_{2\\nu } \\right .",
    "\\nonumber \\\\     & & \\left .",
    "- 2c^2_{23}s^2_{23}~\\left [ 1 - re~ ( e^{-i\\kappa }    a_{2\\nu } ) \\right ] \\right )    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath49 is the probability of two - neutrino oscillations in the earth , @xmath50 and @xmath51 are known phase and two - neutrino transition probability amplitude , @xmath52 is the @xmath53 flux in the absence of neutrino oscillations and    @xmath54    the predicted ratio @xcite for atmospheric sub - gev neutrinos is @xmath55 , whereas @xmath56 for multi - gev atmospheric neutrinos . if @xmath57 , the possible effects of the @xmath58 and @xmath59 transitions on the sub - gev @xmath8like events would be strongly suppressed even if these transitions were maximally enhanced by the earth matter effects . on the other hand , @xmath60 for the multi - gev sample , and matter effects can show up .",
    "thus , in the case under study , the effects of the @xmath58 and @xmath61 oscillations , increase with the increase of @xmath62 , are considerably larger in the multi - gev samples of events than in the sub - gev ones and in the multi - gev case , they lead to an increase of the rate of @xmath8like events and to a slight decrease of the @xmath7like event rate .",
    "this discussion suggests that the quantity most sensitive to the effects of the oscillations of interest should be the ratio of the @xmath7like and @xmath8like multi - gev events , @xmath22 .    if @xmath63 , the earth matter effects can resonantly enhance @xmath64 for @xmath65 and @xmath66 if @xmath67 @xcite . due to the difference of cross sections for neutrinos and antineutrinos ,",
    "approximately 2/3 of the total rate of the @xmath7like and @xmath8like multi - gev atmospheric neutrino events in a water - erenkov detector , i.e. , @xmath68 and @xmath69 , are due to neutrinos @xmath39 and @xmath0 , respectively , while the remaining @xmath70 of the multi - gev event rates , i.e. , @xmath71 and @xmath72 , are produced by antineutrinos @xmath73 and @xmath1 .",
    "this implies that the earth matter effects in the multi - gev samples of @xmath7like and @xmath8like events will be larger if @xmath65 ( normal hierarchy ) , than if @xmath74 ( inverted hierarchy ) .",
    "thus , the ratio @xmath6 of the multi - gev @xmath7like and @xmath8like event rates measured in water - erenkov detectors is sensitive , in principle , to the type of the neutrino mass spectrum @xcite .",
    "in fig . 1 we show the predicted dependences on @xmath75 of the ratios of the multi - gev @xmath7 and @xmath8 like events , integrated over the neutrino energy from the interval @xmath76 gev , for different cases ( see figure ) .    for @xmath77 and @xmath78 , the oscillations of the atmospheric @xmath0 and @xmath1 with energies in the multi - gev range @xmath79 gev , are suppressed . if @xmath65 , for instance , the earth matter effects suppress the antineutrino    = 8.5 cm     figure 1 .",

    "the results shown are for @xmath84 , @xmath85 ( lower panels ) , and @xmath86 ( left panels ) ; @xmath87 .",
    "oscillation probability @xmath66 , but can enhance the neutrino mixing in matter .",
    "however , since the neutrino path in the earth mantle is relatively short , @xmath88 .    at @xmath89",
    ", the earth matter effects in the oscillations of the atmospheric @xmath39 and @xmath0 can generate noticeable differences between @xmath80 ( or @xmath81 ) and @xmath90 , as well as between @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "we have studied the possibility to obtain evidences for earth matter enhanced atmospheric neutrino oscillations involving , in particular , the @xmath0 , from the analysis of the @xmath7like and @xmath8like multi - gev event data that can be provided by present and future water - erenkov detectors .",
    "we have seen that such evidences could give also important quantitative information on the values of @xmath9 and @xmath10 and on the sign of @xmath91 .",
