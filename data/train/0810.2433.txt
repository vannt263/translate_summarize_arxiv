    "in recent years a significant amount of research has been dedicated to strongly - correlated materials with reduced dimensionality since they exhibit a large variety of fascinating dimension - related properties .",
    "an example is the layered quantum spin system tiocl , where bilayers of ti - o are separated by cl@xmath1 ions .",
    "this system was originally thought to be a possible candidate for a rvb superconductor upon doping@xcite because of its frustrated triangular lattice geometry .",
    "later on , various experimental measurements@xcite revealed that tiocl shows in fact an anomalous spin - peierls behavior with two consecutive phase transitions .",
    "magnetic susceptibility was initially described in terms of a one - dimensional spin-1/2 heisenberg model with a large intra - chain coupling constant @xmath2k.@xcite .",
    "it is though well known that susceptibility is not very sensitive to different models and recent _ ab initio _",
    "dft studies@xcite showed that the underlying interactions for this system can be understood in terms of a spin-1/2 heisenberg model with strong intrachain antiferromagnetic interactions @xmath3 and weaker interchain ferromagnetic interactions @xmath4 , @xmath5 .",
    "this model reproduces the magnetic susceptibility measurements and sets a framework for understanding the puzzling spin - peierls phase transitions in this compound .",
    "only recently , research has also focused on high - pressure studies@xcite as a possible way to drive the system metallic .    at room temperature and ambient pressure ,",
    "the system is a mott insulator with a charge gap of about 2ev.@xcite the electronic structure in this high - temperature phase has been examined by angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes).@xcite in agreement with previous experimental evidence , the results show a strong anisotropy of the correlated band structure , with significant dispersion of the ti @xmath6 bands along the chains ( crystallographic @xmath7-direction ) , and almost flat bands perpendicular to the chains .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "the electronic properties of tiocl have been studied by means of _ ab initio _ dft calculations within the local density approximation ( lda ) , the lda+u @xcite , b3lyp @xcite and also in combination with the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft),@xcite which is a modern method for dealing with strong correlations",
    ". it was shown that a proper treatment of non - local correlations is crucial for a reasonable description of the single - particle gap.@xcite    however , the momentum dependence of the spectral function @xmath8 seen in arpes is still puzzling .",
    "it has been shown that an _ ab initio _ calculation without proper treatment of correlations is insufficient.@xcite on the other hand , describing the compound by a simplified one - dimensional strongly correlated model was not successful either.@xcite furthermore , lda+dmft could so far only produce the momentum integrated local density of states ( dos ) without any information on the momentum dependence of the spectra.@xcite this situation , having no calculation for the momentum - resolved spectral function @xmath9 at hand , is partly due to the fact that there are only few methods that can deal with all the requirements of such calculations .",
    "this work is intended to fill this gap and investigates the influence of the true two - dimensional band - structure on the momentum - resolved @xmath9 in the presence of strong correlations .",
    "a successful technique for this purpose is the variational cluster approach ( vca)@xcite .    in what follows",
    "we apply a two - step procedure to study the spectral function , as has been proposed by chioncel _",
    "et al._.@xcite first , dft calculations within the lda are carried out , and localized wannier functions are constructed by the n - th order muffin - tin - orbital ( nmto)@xcite downfolding technique . using the lda hamiltonian expressed in these wannier functions as the non - interacting part , and adding coulomb and hund interaction terms , we arrive at the correlated low - energy model . by applying vca to this model hamiltonian , we show that the inclusion of the inter - chain processes leads to a significant redistribution of spectral weight from higher to lower binding energies . since these processes enhance the asymmetry of the strongly - correlated band structure , they are crucial for the reproduction of the asymmetric bands seen in arpes measurements .",
    "our calculations show that the hubbard - model description is appropriate for tiocl if effects beyond the one - dimensional description are included",
    ". moreover these results should be valid for a large variety of correlated low - dimensional coupled - chain systems .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sect .",
    "[ sec : theory ] we discuss the construction of the low - energy hamiltonian , as well as the vca , which is subsequently used for the calculation of the correlated spectral function .",
    "[ sec : results ] contains our results of the multi - band as well as of the single - band hubbard model and in sect .",
    "[ sec : discuss ] we present our discussions and conclusions .",
    "in many transition metal oxides electronic correlation effects are very important for a proper description of the physical properties .",
    "however , it is a known fact that first - principle calculations suffer from an insufficient treatment of these effects . in order to take the strong correlations into account in our calculation for tiocl",
    ", we apply a two - step procedure ( _ lda+vca _ ) that has first been introduced by l.  chioncel _ et al._.@xcite it consists of the construction of the correlated low - energy hamiltonian based on density - functional theory on the one hand , and the solution of the resulting low - energy hamiltonian using the vca on the other hand . in ref .  , the authors study the non - quasiparticle states in the half - metallic compound cro@xmath10 and find good agreement with experiments .",
    "moreover , a comparison with lda+dmft calculations showed the applicability of the lda+vca approach .",
    "recently , it has also been used to explain the pseudogap in tin , where also the momentum - resolved spectral function has been calculated.@xcite      for a complete description of the electronic structure of a given material it is in principle necessary to consider all electronic degrees of freedom of the underlying constituents .",
    "calculations within dft can to some extent fulfill this requirement",
    ". however , it is clear that only certain states and orbitals contribute to the low - energy physics .",
    "for this reason one is interested in finding an effective model that describes the low - energy physics on the one hand sufficiently accurate and has , on the other hand , not too many degrees of freedom .    in the present case of tiocl , dft calculations within the lda approximation have shown that the relevant orbitals at low energies are the ti 3d orbitals , which are split into @xmath11  and @xmath12 manifolds due to the octahedral crystal field provided by the ligands .",
    "since the ti@xmath13 ion is in a 3d@xmath14 configuration , the relevant states closest to the fermi energy are of predominantly @xmath11  character .    for the construction of the low - energy hamiltonian , we performed dft calculations within the lda using the linearized muffin - tin - orbitals ( lmto ) basis set .",
    "the localized orbitals , which are the basis of the interacting model , are constructed using the nmto method . by using the downfolding technique@xcite , the hybridization of the ti-@xmath11  orbitals with the ligand orbitals ( o-@xmath15 and cl-@xmath15 )",
    "are taken into account , yielding an effective set of @xmath11  orbitals .",
    "these orbitals represent the lda band structure with great accuracy , and are used as the non - interacting part of the many - body hamiltonian .",
    "the matrix elements of the nmto hamiltonian @xmath16 in the basis set of localized nmto wannier functions give the transfer integrals @xmath17 , and the non - interacting hamiltonian can be written as @xmath18 the indices label the lattice sites by @xmath19 ,  @xmath20 , as well as the @xmath11  orbitals by @xmath21 ,  @xmath22 , and @xmath23 denotes the spin .    to include correlation effects into the low - energy description ,",
    "we add interaction terms to the hamiltonian , @xmath24 for convenience , we introduced the chemical potential @xmath25 in the hamiltonian .",
    "we will refer to this hamiltonian as @xmath11  model , and give all energies throughout the paper in units of electron volt ( ev ) .",
    "the full low - energy model eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham ] ) consists of the single - particle terms ( @xmath26 and @xmath25 ) , the diagonal ( density - density ) interactions ( @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 ) , and the non - diagonal ( spin - flip ) term ( @xmath30 , third line ) . in this study",
    "we consider only the case @xmath31 .",
    "@xmath32 is the orbital occupation operator , and @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 are the components of the spin-@xmath36 operator on site @xmath19 in orbital @xmath21 .",
    "the interaction parameters @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath30 are not independent , but fulfill the relation @xmath37 . at this point",
    "it is important to note that we can include a full @xmath38 symmetric exchange term .",
    "since the method we consider is not affected by any sign problem , it has no restriction on the type of couplings that can be included.@xcite for the interaction parameters @xmath27 and @xmath30 one can find several values in the literature , ranging from @xmath39ev to @xmath40ev and @xmath41ev to @xmath42ev.@xcite since we want to study also the influence of these parameters on the single - particle properties , we have performed calculations with different values , and indicate the actual value at the corresponding location in the paper .    in this work , we also address the question whether the orbital degrees of freedom are important for the low - energy physics or not . since tiocl does not crystallize in a perfect cubic symmetry , the threefold degeneracy of the @xmath11  manifold is lifted .",
    "lda+u@xcite and also lda+dmft@xcite calculations have shown that the ground state shows predominantly d@xmath43 character ( the local reference frame is @xmath44 , and @xmath45 and @xmath46 axes rotated by 45@xmath47 with respect to @xmath7 and @xmath48 ) , with only very small admixture of the other orbital degrees of freedom , a picture that we will also find in our following calculations .",
    "this is in contrast to ipt - dmft calculations,@xcite where a sizable admixture of the other orbital degrees of freedom is found .    in order to investigate the effective one - band model that consists of the d@xmath43 orbital",
    "only , we performed a nmto downfolding procedure integrating out all other degrees of freedom , and keeping only the d@xmath43 channel . in this one - band model ,",
    "the only interaction terms are the ones proportional to the hubbard onsite @xmath27 , and the low - energy one - band hamiltonian finally reads @xmath49 where the hubbard interaction @xmath27 is the same as for the @xmath11  -model .",
    "the effective hopping parameters @xmath50 are again the matrix elements of @xmath16 in the wannier basis set .",
    "triangular lattice structure and two possible clusters tiling the lattice .",
    "i ) 4-site cluster including inter - chain self - energies .",
    "ii ) 1d clusters neglecting inter - chain self - energies . full circles and solid lines",
    "mark sites and bonds inside a clusters .",
    "next - next - nearest neighbor hopping @xmath51 is only drawn once for clarity . in the case of the @xmath11  manifold each lattice site consists of three orbitals . ]    after having constructed the low - energy hamiltonian using _ ab initio _ techniques , we use the vca@xcite in order to calculate the spectral function of this model .",
    "since we deal with an effective low - energy hamiltonian that involves no other uncorrelated ligand states ( o-@xmath15 , cl-@xmath15 ) , but only the correlated ti-@xmath11  orbitals , the application of vca is straightforward , and is from a technical point of view exactly equivalent to standard multi - orbital calculations for hubbard - model hamiltonians .",
    "the only difference is that the non - interacting part is determined by the procedure discussed in the previous subsection .",
    "furthermore , since there are no explicit ligand states in the hamiltonian , there is no need for a double - counting correction .",
    "it gives just a constant shift in energy which can be absorbed in the chemical potential .    as mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "the vca is a quantum cluster method capable of treating strong short - ranged correlations .",
    "the main idea is to approximate the self - energy of the original model , which is defined on an infinite lattice , by the self - energy of a finite cluster , the reference system .",
    "the variational principle states that the optimal solution is given by the stationary points of the grand potential @xmath52 $ ] as a function of the self - energy @xmath53 . parametrizing the self - energy by the single - particle parameters @xmath54 of the reference system ,",
    "we can write the grand potential as @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are respectively the grand canonical potential and the green s function of the reference system and @xmath58 is the non - interacting green s function of the physical ( lattice ) system .",
    "the stationary condition reads @xmath59    it is important to note that the interaction parameters are not variational parameters , since , by construction of the vca , the interaction terms of the reference system and the original lattice model must not differ . in this study , we restrict ourselves to local interactions only since the vca in its strict sense can not be used for models with non - local interactions without further approximations .    in its spirit , the vca is closely related to the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) , where in the latter case the self - energy is obtained from an impurity problem .",
    "the actual vca calculation is done in the following steps .",
    "first , we determine the ground state of the reference system , i.e. a cluster of finite size as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : cluster ] . the interacting green s function is calculated , and since the non - interacting green s function of the reference system is known , the self - energy can readily be obtained using dyson s equation . using the grand potential @xmath56 of the reference system , the green s function @xmath57 , and the self - energy @xmath60 , eq .",
    "[ eq : ocalc ] is evaluated using the technique of @xmath61-matrices.@xcite note that the green s functions @xmath58 , @xmath57 and the self - energy @xmath62 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ocalc ] ) are matrices not only in site and spin indices , but also carry an orbital index .",
    "in fact , this is the only difference of the application of vca in the present case compared to the numerous previous applications to the single - band hubbard model .    as a reference system solver",
    ", we use the band - lanczos exact diagonalization technique at zero temperature , which means that for the full @xmath11  manifold , we can easily consider clusters with at most 4 sites , yielding a 12-orbital green s function @xmath57 . for the single - band model ,",
    "we consider clusters up to 12 sites .",
    "we exploit particle number and spin conservation , therefore the sizes of the largest hilbert spaces that we have to consider are @xmath63 states in the 4-site multi - orbital case , and @xmath64 states in the 12-site single - orbital case , respectively . since we are considering an exact diagonalization method for solving the cluster problem , all interactions in the hamiltonians eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham1b ] ) are treated exactly and on the same footing .",
    "this is a clear advantage compared to , e.g. , using the hirsch - fye quantum monte - carlo method as impurity solver , since in the latter case approximations to the interaction terms of the hamiltonian have to be done.@xcite    the vca approach has been tested thoroughly and used successfully for many investigations in recent years .",
    "several studies on the cuprate - based high - temperature superconductors have shown that this approach can reproduce salient features of these materials , such as the ground - state phase diagram,@xcite or the opening of the pseudogap at low hole doping , accompanied with the occurrence of fermi arcs,@xcite in very good agreement with experiments and results obtained by the cellular dynamical mean - field theory ( cdmft ) ( see , e.g , refs .  ) .",
    "recently , the vca could also reproduce the pairing symmetry of the iron - based superconductors.@xcite    the vca has also been used for multi - orbital systems , which is relevant for the combination with _ ab - initio _ methods . on the pure methodological level ,",
    "the metal - insulator transition in infinite dimensions was studied@xcite , and very good agreement with dynamical mean - field calculations was found .",
    "an application to real materials was done in refs .  , where the compounds nio , coo , and mno have been studied and very good agreement with experimental photo - emission data has been found .",
    "details on the practical implementation of the vca , including tests and benchmarking , can be found in refs .  .    in general ,",
    "all the single - particle parameters @xmath54 are variational parameters of the vca . in practice",
    ", one chooses a physically motivated subset in order to keep the numerical calculations feasible . here",
    "we make the following choice . for a thermodynamically consistent description of the densities ,",
    "it is crucial to consider the onsite energies , i.e. the local terms of the single - particle hamiltonian @xmath65 , as variational parameters.@xcite we define the average @xmath66 and the crystal - field splitting @xmath67 , which are then used as the variational parameters of the vca .",
    "note that in the single - band case , eq .  ( [ eq : ham1b ] ) , one has to deal with @xmath68 only .",
    "one has to be aware that the variational parameter @xmath69 _ does not _ impose an artificial orbital polarization of the system , since it is a parameter in the variational procedure and no physical external field .",
    "hence , using @xmath68 and @xmath69 , the orbital occupancies are determined in a fully self - consistent way .",
    "the main property investigated in this work is the single - particle spectral function which we define as @xmath70 since we broke the translational invariance of the system by introducing the cluster tiling , a proper periodization of the lattice quantities is needed in order to restore translational symmetry , an issue also important in cluster dmft calculations.@xcite here , we choose to use the periodization of the green s function since the periodization of the self - energy gives unphysical results in the insulating phase.@xcite in other words , starting from the green s function that depends on two momenta , @xmath71 , one restores the fully translationally invariant green s function @xmath72 , by neglecting the off - diagonal elements , and taking @xmath73 only .",
    "it has been shown that this is a well justified approximation to calculating the momentum - dependent spectral function.@xcite the green s function @xmath74 is in general a matrix in orbital indices and @xmath75 is given by the trace over the orbital degrees of freedom .",

    "ab initio _ calculations to determine the full single - particle hamiltonian of the system .",
    "since ti@xmath13 is in a @xmath82 configuration , the @xmath12 orbitals are unoccupied and can be projected out , and the full kinetic hamiltonian is downfolded to the threefold degenerate @xmath11  manifold .",

    "[ fig : cluster ] , almost one order of magnitude larger than the other transfer integrals .",

    "note that for the orbital designation we consider the same local reference frame as in ref .  .",
    "the crystal - field splitting between the ground state and the first excited state obtained from lda is about 0.42ev .",
    "this theoretical value is in reasonable agreement with experimental results.@xcite despite this splitting , the orbital sector is not fully polarized in the lda calculations , and the occupation of @xmath83 is about 0.49 , with 0.51 electrons in the other two orbitals .    in order to perform our lda+vca calculations , we take the downfolded hamiltonian of the _ ab initio _ calculations , and add the interaction and exchange terms according to eq .",

    "the behavior of the @xmath83 orbital is strikingly different .",
    "it splits into two bands that can be identified with the lower and upper hubbard band , located roughly around @xmath86ev and 2.5ev , respectively . by inspecting the terms of the hamiltonian related to the crystal - field splitting ,",
    "i.e. @xmath87 , we can calculate the orbital polarization @xmath88 .",
    "we find a value of @xmath89 , meaning that the system is almost perfectly polarized into the @xmath83 orbital , which is in agreement with recent lda+cdmft calculations.@xcite interestingly , this polarization is found without any sizable increase of the crystal - field splitting in the variational procedure , i.e. , @xmath90 , but it is only due to the inclusion of strong local interactions .",
    "this result gives rise to the question , to which extent a single - band hubbard model can describe the occupied states relevant for comparison with arpes .",
    "we took parameters from a full downfolding to the ti @xmath83 orbital only , cf .",

    "[ fig : comp_ak0 ] it is clear that the inclusion of inter - chain processes enhances the asymmetry of the @xmath115-resolved spectra .",
    "the low - lying excitation near the @xmath0 point is strongly enhanced , whereas there is no spectral weight transfer to lower binding energies visible around @xmath116 .",
    "note that we define the spectrum to be symmetric if the main excitations at @xmath117-vector @xmath107 and @xmath116 are located at the same binding energy .",
    "one may ask if it is possible to get a similar spectral weight distribution by using only the purely one - dimensional hubbard model , but including longer - ranged intra - chain hopping processes as given by the _ ab initio _ calculations .",
    "in fact , the next - nearest - neighbor hopping term along the chain , @xmath118 , is of similar size of the inter - chain hoppings.@xcite the result for the spectral function at the @xmath0 point in this pure 1d case is shown in the lower left panel ( c ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : comp_ak0 ] . from this result",
    "it is obvious that one can not get an excitation at binding energies of roughly @xmath119ev , as seen in experiments . on the contrary ,",
    "the spectral weight of the excitation at the higher binding energy of about @xmath120ev is even enhanced in the one - dimensional treatment when longer - ranged hopping processes are included .",
    "( color online ) comparison of the theoretical spectral function ( left ) with the experimental arpes spectra ( right ) . only the @xmath7-direction is shown .",
    "lorentzian broadening of @xmath79ev was used . the vertical dashed line marks momentum @xmath121 , and the band widths @xmath122 and @xmath123 are indicated .",
    "dark areas mark large spectral weight , the color scale is normalized in each plot separately . ]",
    "our results support the description of tiocl as a layered two - dimensional compound with strong anisotropy , also on the level of correlations .",
    "there is finite dispersion also perpendicular to the chains , but a backfolding of the bands can only be seen along the chains , where correlations are dominant .",
    "let us now comment on the relation of our results to arpes data .",
    "experiments show@xcite that the dispersion in tiocl shows a strong asymmetric behavior along the crystallographic @xmath7 direction , see also the right plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : comp_exp ] .",
    "the binding energy of the lowest - lying band around @xmath124 is about @xmath125ev , whereas around @xmath126 it is about @xmath127ev .",
    "first attempts to describe the dispersions within _ ab initio _ calculations were not successful .",
    "standard lda calculations do not produce the backfolding of the bands induced by short - range spin fluctuations , and spin - polarized lsda+u calculations can not account for the asymmetry of the spectra .",
    "also the spectra of the one - dimensional hubbard model calculated within the dynamical density - matrix renormalization group ( ddmrg ) do not reproduce the experimental spectral weight distribution.@xcite however , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : comp_exp ] , our new results show that the hubbard model _ can indeed _ give a good description of the asymmetry , since the inter - chain processes give rise to a spectral weight transfer from the holon to the spinon band around the @xmath0 point , and therefore make the band structure more asymmetric .    in order to compare our results more quantitatively , we extract the following numbers related to the band widths of the spectra . the first one , @xmath122 , is the difference of the binding energies at @xmath121 and @xmath116 and is a measure for the overall band width . the second one , @xmath123 ,",
    "is defined to be the difference in binding energies between @xmath121 and @xmath107 .",
    "the larger the difference between these two quantities , the larger is the asymmetry of the spectra .",
    "from experiments@xcite we extract @xmath128ev and @xmath129ev , and for the calculated spectra we get @xmath130ev and @xmath131ev . comparing theory and experiment , we see that the overall band width @xmath122 is well reproduced by the calculation , but the asymmetry is even a bit more pronounced in the theoretical spectra , resulting in a smaller value of @xmath123 .",
    "this result may be improved by including more longer - ranged hopping processes .",
    "although they decrease rapidly with distance , they can change the band widths within a few percent .    by inspecting fig .",
    "[ fig : comp_exp ] it is obvious that the width of the spectra is much larger in the arpes data than in the calculated spectra . the most important reason for that is that our calculations are done at @xmath132 , using exact diagonalization techniques .",
    "therefore there are no life - time effects due to finite temperatures included in our calculations . moreover",
    ", additional coupling to lattice degrees of freedom could also lead to a smaller life time , and hence broader excitations .    in summary ,",
    "our results imply that it is important to include the inter - chain couplings at least on a single - particle non - interacting level into the effective model , in order to improve the description of the experimental spectra , although the strong correlations are constricted mainly to the chains .    with our work we could fill the gap left by previous theoretical studies regarding the momentum - resolved single - particle spectral function of tiocl .",
    "there are , though , still some open questions .",
    "for example , we do see clear signatures of spin - charge separation in our calculated spectra , which have not been found experimentally . also the so - called shadow band , dispersing at around @xmath133ev",
    "has not been seen in the arpes spectra .",
    "a reason for this can be a very small relative spectral weight of the high - energy band that can not be resolved in experiment . in our calculation we also did not include the lattice degrees of freedom , which are supposed to be very important in tiocl@xcite , driving the spin - peierls phase transition . these phonons can also lead to a smearing of the peak structure of @xmath9 .    finally , we want to comment also on the differences between the arpes spectra of tiocl and tiobr .",
    "experiments , supplemented with band structure calculations , have shown@xcite that in the latter compound the intra - chain couplings are weaker and the inter - chain couplings stronger compared to tiocl,@xcite e.g. , @xmath134 decreases from @xmath135ev to @xmath136ev , whereas @xmath51 increases from @xmath137ev to @xmath138ev . by inspecting the self - energies in a similar manner as we did in fig .",
    "[ fig : selfenergy ] , we found that also for these parameter values the correlations are predominantly one - dimensional .",
    "there are only changes in the overall bandwidths , but no qualitative changes .",
    "for instance , the band width in @xmath100-direction is enhanced , but there are no signatures of strong inter - chain correlations resulting in a backfolding of the bands .    at this point",
    "we want to remark that , in particular for tiobr , one should be very careful with the use of the spinon / holon terminology .",
    "although there are no qualitative changes due to the enhanced couplings , they do change the band widths .",
    "hence , quantitative analysis have to be done including these inter - chain couplings .",
    "by combining _",
    "ab initio _ calculations ( lda ) and the variational cluster approximation , we could study for the first time the momentum - resolved spectral function including a realistic band structure _ and _ strong - correlation effects . in agreement with previous theoretical studies and experimental results , our calculations showed an almost complete polarization in the orbital sector , with 99% of the electrons occupying the ti @xmath83 orbital .",
    "since the orbital degree of freedom is quenched , we could use an effective single - band model for the investigation of the spectral properties .",
    "the most striking result of our study is that the inclusion of inter - chain hopping processes leads to a significant spectral weight redistribution around the @xmath0 point from higher to lower binding energies .",
    "this effect , which makes the spectrum more asymmetric with respect to the points @xmath107 and @xmath116 , can not be reproduced using only the hopping processes along the chains .",
    "this result suggests that the frustrated inter - chain coupling@xcite is one of the main reasons for the strong asymmetry that has been found in experimental arpes measurements .",
    "moreover the calculated spectral features may be extended to a more general class of correlated coupled - chains systems .    an open question in tiocl is still the role of phonons .",
    "because of the vicinity of the system to a spin - peierls instability , the phonons are supposed to be important in the system . including these degrees of freedom ,",
    "although theoretically very demanding , could further improve the results with respect to lineshapes and lifetimes of the excitations .",
