    "after the discovery of a signal with a mass of about 125  gev in the higgs searches at the lhc  @xcite , the prime goal is now to identify the underlying nature of the new state and to determine the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking . while the properties of the observed state are compatible with the ones predicted for the higgs boson of the standard model ( sm ) at the current level of precision , also a wide range of alternative interpretations could be possible , corresponding to very different underlying physics .",
    "in particular , in models with an extended higgs sector the observed state would be accompanied by several other higgs bosons , in contrast to the minimal formulation of the sm where a single @xmath0-doublet is responsible for electroweak - symmetry breaking .",
    "supersymmetry ( susy )  @xcite is commonly regarded as the most appealing extension of the sm , since it provides a solution for stabilising the huge hierarchy between the planck scale and the weak scale  @xcite and offers further attractive features such as unification of the gauge couplings and a natural candidate for cold dark matter in the universe .",
    "a crucial prediction of supersymmetric extensions of the sm are their extended higgs sectors : the holomorphicity of the superpotential ( as well as the cancellation of gauge anomalies ) implies that at least two @xmath0 doublets with opposite hypercharge have to be present , so as to generate mass terms for both up- and down - quarks ( in a type ii 2-higgs - doublet - model fashion ) .",
    "the minimal supersymmetric extension of the sm ( mssm )  @xcite is based on the minimal higgs sector of this kind comprising two higgs doublets , whereas the higgs sector of the next - to - minimal supersymmetric extension of the sm ( nmssm )  @xcite contains an additional ( complex ) gauge - singlet .",
    "it has long been recognised that the nmssm provides an elegant solution  @xcite to the `` @xmath1-problem ''  @xcite of the mssm . in the context of the relatively high mass value of about 125  gev of the observed state ,",
    "this model has received particular attention lately since the mass of the light doublet - like state receives an additional contribution at lowest order as compared to the mssm , which dominates at low values of @xmath2 ( the ratio of the vacuum expectation values , v.e.v.s , of the two higgs doublets ) . in this case",
    "significantly smaller higher - order corrections are required to obtain a higgs - boson mass in the appropriate range  @xcite as compared to the mssm , where the lowest - order prediction for the mass of the light cp - even higgs boson is bounded from above by the mass of the z  boson , @xmath3 .",
    "furthermore , also the singlet  doublet mixing can give rise to an uplift of the mass of the doublet state , provided that the cp - even singlet state is lighter than the doublet state .",
    "it has been argued in this context that the relaxed requirement on the size of the higher - order corrections as compared to the mssm makes it possible to obtain a higgs - mass prediction of about 125  gev in a `` more natural '' way  @xcite .    in the following",
    "we will focus on the nmssm as a theoretically well - motivated alternative to the sm with a potentially rich phenomenology in the higgs sector . for simplicity",
    ", we will restrict to the cp - conserving case , for which the spectrum of physical higgs states of the nmssm consists of three cp - even , two cp - odd and a pair of charged higgs states ( while we do not explicitly consider cp - violating effects giving rise to a mixture between the five neutral states , it should be noted that cases where a cp - even and a cp - odd state are nearly mass - degenerate essentially mimick a scenario where a single state is an admixture of cp - even and cp - odd components ) .",
    "furthermore , while several versions of the nmssm can be formulated , depending on the form of the singlet and singlet - doublet interaction terms in the superpotential , we will focus on the @xmath4-conserving version only , where the solution to the `` @xmath1-problem '' is more immediate ( on the other hand , this simple model could lead to a domain wall problem @xcite but we will not address this question here ) .",
    "the higgs sector of this version of the nmssm is characterised by six parameters ( at tree - level ) , in contrast to the two parameters of the mssm .",
    "while we shall borrow most of our notations from @xcite , we recall the higgs terms entering the superpotential of the model : @xmath5 where @xmath6 denotes the singlet ( super)field , @xmath7 and @xmath8 the doublets , while @xmath9 stands for the @xmath10 product .    when confronting the predictions of an extended higgs sector with the observed signal and the limits from the higgs searches at lep , the tevatron and the lhc , the most obvious interpretation of the signal at about 125  gev is to associate it with the lightest cp - even higgs boson of the considered model .",
    "the case where all other higgs ( as well as all new physics ) states of a supersymmetric extension of the sm ( and the same is true for various other extended higgs sectors ) are significantly heavier corresponds to the `` decoupling region '' of the model under consideration , where the couplings of the light higgs boson to gauge bosons and sm fermions are very close to the ones of the sm . revealing deviations of those couplings from their sm counterparts in such a case will require high - precision measurements , where in many cases the expected deviations do not exceed the level of a few per cent .",
    "an additional source of possible deviations from the sm could be decays of the sm - like state into new - physics particles .",
    "such a decay could in particular occur into a pair of dark matter particles , if the mass of the latter is less than half of the mass of the higgs state , i.e.  below about 60  gev .",
    "this would give rise to an invisible decay mode of the observed state , providing a strong motivation for searches of decays of the observed signal into invisible final states .",
    "besides the interpretation of the observed state as the lightest cp - even higgs boson of an extended higgs sector , it is also possible , at least in principle , to identify the observed signal with the second - lightest state of an extended higgs sector .",
    "this interpretation would have the immediate consequence that there should be an ( or more generally at least one ) additional higgs state _ below _",
    "the one observed at about 125  gev .",
    "the phenomenology of such a scenario is very different from the case of the decoupling limit discussed above , because of the presence of at least one more light state in the spectrum . within the mssm",
    "this interpretation is in principle possible  @xcite , but gives rise to a rather exotic higgs sector where in fact all additional higgs bosons are light , i.e.in the vicinity of the state at about 125  gev or below .",
    "it is remarkable that a global fit within the mssm within this interpretation has resulted in an acceptable fit probability  @xcite , but lately this interpretation , which implies in particular a light charged higgs boson below the mass of the top quark ( see in particular ref .",
    "@xcite ) , has come under increased pressure from the limits obtained in the charged higgs searches by atlas  @xcite and , more recently , cms  @xcite .",
    "the nmssm provides a well - suited and theoretically well motivated framework for investigating to what extent interpretations that go beyond the obvious case of a single light state in the decoupling limit are compatible with the latest experimental results both with respect to the properties of the observed state and to the limits obtained from higgs searches ( as well as other existing constraints ) .",
    "it is the purpose of the present paper to perform such an analysis .",
    "it is obvious that compatibility with the observed signal requires much more than just a higgs state ( or possibly more than one ) in the spectrum with a mass of about 125  gev . in order to properly take into account the latest experimental results from higgs search limits and from measurements of the properties of the observed state , we make use of the public tools higgsbounds  @xcite and higgssignals  @xcite , which incorporate a comprehensive set of results from atlas  @xcite , cms  @xcite and the tevatron  @xcite .",
    "we do not explicitly impose limits from the direct searches for susy particles at the lhc .",
    "while some of the scenarios discussed in this paper could be affected by constraints from susy particle searches , we have checked that the qualitative features of the higgs phenomenology of those scenarios are maintained also for somewhat heavier susy particle spectra .",
    "note however that most of the susy spectra that we employ ( especially for coloured particles ) are beyond the mass - range tested in the run - i of the lhc .",
    "as mentioned above , already since the very early hints of a signal at about 125  gev the higgs sector of the nmssm has found a lot of attention in this context . besides the mass prediction in comparison with the mssm case  @xcite ,",
    "the possibility of modified rates has been discussed , particularly in the diphoton channel  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the case of universal ( or semi - universal ) susy - breaking conditions at the gut scale  @xcite , gauge - mediation  @xcite and other related scenarios  @xcite have been considered in this context .",
    "the cp - violating version of the nmssm also received some attention @xcite .",
    "@xcite analysed the fine - tuning in a @xmath4-violating version of the nmssm and variants .",
    "other groups confronted the presence of a higgs state at this mass with direct searches for susy particles at the lhc or dark - matter constraints  @xcite .",
    "scenarios with a light singlet - like state around @xmath11  gev have found considerable interest  @xcite .",
    "another possibility involves a singlet and a doublet that are almost mass - degenerate at about 125  gev and may mix with each other , see ref .",
    "@xcite ( and the last reference of @xcite ) .",
    "several studies also suggested to exploit pair production processes at the lhc in order to distinguish the sm from the nmssm and/or to look for a light singlet in this fashion  @xcite .",
    "scenarios with a very light cp - odd ( or cp - even ) higgs boson were addressed with several search proposals in direct production , unconventional light charged - higgs decays , or cascade decays from sm - like / light singlet states ; large higgs - to - higgs decays were also considered from the point of view of the sm - compatible nature of the observed state  @xcite .",
    "recent studies of the properties of a light pseudoscalar in the nmssm  @xcite have emphasized the relevance of indirect production modes for the investigation of this scenario at the lhc . in a different direction ,",
    "the authors of @xcite focussed on nmssm higgs scenarios with a low - scale doublet sector .",
    "furthermore , @xcite , and more recently @xcite , studied the discovery prospects of nmssm higgs states in the lhc run at @xmath12  tev . in our analysis",
    "we go beyond the previous work in several respects : while many of the afore - mentioned analyses discussed scenarios which are compatible with existing limits , our inclusion of a fitting tool allows us to highlight the quality of the various scenarios in view of the available data .",
    "furthermore , we aim at a comprehensive discussion from the point of view of the nmssm higgs phenomenology , hence do not confine to a specific scenario ( within our assumptions on the model , perturbativity constraints and choices of simplicity with regards to the susy spectrum ) .",
    "we also focus on higgs physics and thus try , without spoiling the physical content , to avoid emphasis on questions of secondary importance with respect to this topic ( e.g.  the details of the supersymmetric spectrum ) .",
    "finally , much experimental data has become available in the last few years , narrowing the possibilities in the higgs sector , and most of the recent developments are included within the tools on which our discussion is based .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in sect .",
    "2 we describe the framework that we use for the analyses in this paper , in particular the statistical approach used in our fits , the treatment of external constraints and the tools that we apply . as a first step of our analysis , in sect .  3",
    "we briefly consider the sm case and the corresponding decoupling limits of the mssm and the nmssm .",
    "the sm result is used for comparison with @xmath13 analyses in different nmssm scenarios , which we perform in sects .",
    "[ lsing][ldoub ] . in sect .",
    "[ fp ] , we focus on specific points of the nmssm parameter space and discuss in more details the higgs phenomenology and the consequences for future searches , should the corresponding spectrum be realised in nature . in sect .  [ gs ] a more global scan is carried out , and the features observed in the global scan are discussed in view of the results obtained for the specific nmssm scenarios that we have considered before .",
    "[ conc ] contains our conclusions .",
    "the nmssm parameter space is explored with the help of the spectrum generator ` nmssmtools_4.4.0 ` @xcite , computing the higgs masses up to leading two - loop double - log order ( we will be using the default mode only ) , in an effective potential approach .",
    "this code considers a certain number of phenomenological limits , several among which are kept within our analysis .",
    "the first class of such tests are consistency requirements and are ( necessarily ) included as hard cuts :    * stability of the ewsb - vacuum : positivity of the scalar squared - masses , absence of deeper minimum ; * absence of landau poles below the gut scale : while this requirement is sometimes omitted in order to probe effects associated with large values of the parameter @xmath14 and under the assumption that new - physics or specific properties of the non - perturbative regime would smoothen the theoretical difficulty of the landau poles , we choose to keep this theoretical limit ; * requirement for higgs soft squared - masses at the tev scale : the potential - minimization procedure in nmssmtools trades these masses for the higgs v.e.v.s , so that the naturalness requirement that soft masses intervene at the tev scale must be checked explicitly ; * requirement for a neutralino lsp ( the impact of which , however , is of secondary importance in our discussion ) .",
    "* @xmath15 decay ( @xmath16 ) * mass lower limits on squarks ( @xmath17  gev , @xmath18  gev ) , gluino ( @xmath19  gev ) , sleptons ( @xmath20  gev ) , charginos ( @xmath21  gev ) ; * limits on @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",
    "we remind the reader that lhc limits on susy searches are not considered in our analysis",
    ". however , the susy spectra that we employ are typically beyond the mass - range of the searches in the run - i . in this context",
    ", the inclusion of lep limits as mentioned above has only a minor impact .      * limits from the bottomonium sector : non - observation of a signal in @xmath25 , excessive contribution to the @xmath26 mixing @xcite . only light cp - odd higgs below @xmath27  gev",

    "we combine them in a @xmath13 function relying on the central value and error bars computed in nmssmtools : @xmath35 the corresponding experimental central values @xmath36 and standard deviation @xmath37 are summarized in table  [ expblim ] .",
    "the theoretical error estimate is the result of an involved calculation : errors relative to sm - like contributions are taken from the corresponding sm estimate ; the uncertainty on new - physics contributions is estimated to @xmath38 ( if only leading - order effects are included ) / @xmath39 ( if next - to - leading @xmath40 corrections are present ) of the total corresponding contributions and are added linearly to the sm error ; additional error sources are mostly ckm matrix elements ( taken from tree - level measurements exclusively ) and hadronic parameters ( decay constants , taken from lattice calculations ) ; to obtain the final theoretical uncertainty range , both higher - order and parametric uncertainties are varied within these previously - discussed limits .",
    "* @xmath41 @xcite : similarly to @xmath29-observables , we add a contribution to the @xmath13 with experimental - sm input shown in table  [ expblim ] , where the errors have been added in quadrature . the theoretical uncertainty associated to new - physics contributions and higher orders",
    "is calculated as the sum of a fixed error @xmath42 , a @xmath43 error estimate on 1-loop contributions ( which do not involve coloured particles ) and a @xmath38 error estimate on 2-loop effects ( involving coloured particles ) .",

    "* dark matter searches : relic - density ( via micromegas ) , xenon 100 @xcite .",
    "the reasons for not taking such limits into account come from the observation that they are strongly dependent on the susy spectrum , while we want to focus on the higgs sector : confining to collider constraints allows us to handle simple supersymmetric spectra , which play a secondary part in our analysis , while these would likely have to be finely adjusted if one were to include , e.g. , the relic - density bounds .",

    "<S> while the properties of the signal that was discovered in the higgs searches at the lhc are consistent so far with the higgs boson of the standard model ( sm ) , it is crucial to investigate to what extent other interpretations that may correspond to very different underlying physics are compatible with the current results . </S>",
    "<S> we use the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) as a well - motivated theoretical framework with a sufficiently rich higgs phenomenology to address this question , making use of the public tools ` higgsbounds ` and ` higgssignals ` in order to take into account comprehensive experimental information on both the observed signal and on the existing limits from higgs searches at lep , the tevatron and the lhc . </S>",
    "<S> we find that besides the decoupling limit resulting in a single light state with sm - like properties , several other configurations involving states lighter or quasi - degenerate with the one at about 125  gev turn out to give a competitive fit to the higgs data and other existing constraints . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the phenomenology and possible future experimental tests of those scenarios , and compare the features of specific scenarios chosen as examples with those arising from a more global fit . </S>"
