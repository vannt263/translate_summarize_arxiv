    "photonia has imported a single electron from qedland , and physicists are studying its interaction with soft photons ( both real and virtual ) which they can produce and detect so well . the aim is to construct a theory describing states with a single electron plus soft photon fields .    the ground state ( `` vacuum '' ) of the theory is the electron at rest ( and no photons ) .",
    "it is natural to define its energy to be @xmath0 . when the electron has momentum @xmath1 , its energy is @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the electron mass ( in the on - shell renormalization scheme ) , our large mass scale .",
    "the electron velocity is @xmath4    at the leading ( @xmath0-th ) order in @xmath5 , the mass shell of the free electron is @xmath6 at this order , the electron velocity is @xmath7 the electron does not move ; it always stays in the point where it has been put initially .",
    "the lagrangian @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the 2-component spinor electron field , leads to the equation of motion @xmath10 this means that the energy of an on - shell electron is @xmath11 .",
    "thus the lagrangian  ( [ photonia : l0 ] ) reproduces the mass shell  ( [ photonia : mshell ] ) , and can be used to describe the free electron at the leading order in @xmath5 .",
    "the electron has charge @xmath12 .",
    "therefore , when placed in an external electromagnetic field , it has energy @xmath13 instead of  ( [ photonia : mshell ] ) . therefore , the equation of motion is @xmath14 instead of  ( [ photonia : eom0 ] ) , where @xmath15 is the covariant derivative .",
    "it can be obtained from the heet lagrangian  @xcite @xmath16 this lagrangian is not lorentz - invariant .",
    "it is invariant with respect to the gauge transformation @xmath17    of course , the full lagrangian is the sum of  ( [ photonia : l ] ) and the lagrangian of the photon field .",
    "this gives the equation of motion for the electromagnetic field @xmath18 where the current @xmath19 has only @xmath0-th component @xmath20 ( the interaction term in the lagrangian  ( [ photonia : l ] ) is @xmath21 ) .",
    "the electron produces the coulomb field .    at the leading order in @xmath5 ,",
    "the electron spin does not interact with electromagnetic field .",
    "we can rotate it without affecting physics .",
    "speaking more formally , the lagrangian  ( [ photonia : l ] ) has , in addition to the @xmath22 symmetry @xmath23 , also the @xmath24 spin symmetry  @xcite : it is invariant with respect to transformations @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a @xmath24 matrix ( @xmath27 ) .    in fact , the electron has magnetic moment @xmath28 proportional to its spin @xmath29 , and this magnetic moment interacts with magnetic field : the interaction hamiltonian is @xmath30 .",

    "namely , @xmath32 ( up to small radiative corrections ) , where @xmath33 is the bohr magneton .",
    "the lagrangian thus has an additional term describing this magnetic interaction , @xmath34 this term violates the @xmath24 spin symmetry at the @xmath5 level .",
    "if we assume that there are @xmath35 flavours of heavy fermions , @xmath36 then the lagrangian has @xmath37 symmetry ( even when the masses @xmath38 are different )",
    ". the spin - flavour symmetry is broken at the @xmath39 level by both the kinetic - energy term and the magnetic - interaction term .    at the leading order in @xmath5 , not only the spin direction but",
    "also its magnitude is irrelevant .",
    "we can , for example , switch the electron spin off : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is a scalar field ( with charge @xmath12 ) .",
    "this is the most convenient form of the lagrangian in all cases when we are not interested in @xmath5 corrections .",

    "the superflavour @xmath44 symmetry contains , in addition to @xmath24 spin transformations  ( [ photonia : su2 ] ) and phase rotations @xmath45 , @xmath46 , also transformations which mix spin-0 and spin-@xmath47 fields . in the infinitesimal form , @xmath48 where @xmath49 is an infinitesimal spinor parameter .",
    "so , this @xmath44 is a supersymmetry group .",
    "if we want , we can consider , e.g. , spins @xmath47 and 1 ; the corresponding lagrangian has @xmath50 superflavour symmetry .",

    "therefore , there are no pair creation and annihilation ( even virtual ) . in other words , there are no loops formed by propagators of the static electron",
    ". the electron propagates only forward in time  ( [ feyn : sx ] ) ; the product of @xmath64 functions along a loop vanishes .",
    "we can also see this in momentum space : all poles of the propagators  ( [ feyn : sp ] ) in such a loop are in the lower @xmath54 half - plane , and closing the integration contour upwards , we get 0 .",

    "the same formula can be used when the electromagnetic field is quantum ( operator @xmath72 ) , but the exponent  ( [ feyn : w ] ) has to be path - ordered : operators referring to earlier points ( along the path ) are placed to the right from those for later points .",
    "this is usually denoted by @xmath73 ; when the path is directed to the future , @xmath74-ordering coincides with @xmath75-ordering .",

    "many results now considered classics of hqet were derived in the course of these studies before hqet was invented in 1990 . in particular , the hqet lagrangian  ( [ photonia : spin0 ] ) has been introduced  @xcite as a technical device for investigation of wilson lines .",
    "if we choose the gauge @xmath77 , then the field @xmath78 in  ( [ feyn : l ] ) does not interact with the electromagnetic field ( and thus becomes free ) . however , this gauge is rather pathological .",
    "the static electron creates the coulomb electric field @xmath79 ( because is has the charge density  ( [ photonia : j ] ) ) . in the @xmath80 gauge",
    ", @xmath81 has to depend on @xmath82 linearly in order to reproduce this electric field .",
    "imagine trying to solve the hydrogen atom problem in this gauge : the hamiltonian is time - dependent , there are no stationary states , etc .",
