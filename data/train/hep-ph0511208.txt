    "conversely , if @xmath70 has stationary point , the possibility of having finite energy soliton solutions is not excluded .",

    "unfortunately , under these boundary conditions we could not find soliton solutions in eq.([fsn_eq2 ] ) for any value of @xmath65 .",
    "recently , forkel studied the soft mode action of the yang - mills theory and investigated the solitonic , saddle point solution with hegdehog symmetry @xcite .",
    "his work is quite encouraging to find the class of solutions in the infrared part of the yang - mills action .",
    "but , the solutions the author obtained are solitons with non - zero topological charge and , in the case of the hopf solitons which possess zero topological charge , the situation is a little more complicated .    from the identity @xmath83 = \\int d^4x(\\partial^2 \\bm{n}\\times\\bm{n})^2\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "one easily finds that the static energy obtained from the last two terms in eq.([fsn_ac2 ] ) @xmath84 gives the positive contribution .",
    "the total static energy is stationary at @xmath85 and hence the possibility of existence of soliton solutions is not excluded . and also , the positivity of eq.([energy2 ] ) does not spoil the lower bound ( [ lowerbound ] ) of original sfn and the possibility still remains .",
    "therefore , we suspect that the failure of finding the stable soliton is caused by the fact that _ higher derivative theory has no lower bound_. we shall investigate the lower bound in the higher derivative theory in detail in the next section .",
    "in this section , we address the basic problems in the higher derivative theory  @xcite which essentially falls into two categories .",
    "the first problem concerns the increase in the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "for example , if the theory contains second derivative terms , the equation of motion becomes up to the order in the fourth derivative .",
    "thus , four parameters are required for the initial conditions .",
    "if one considers more higher order terms , the situation gets worse .",
    "however , this is not serious problem for our study because our concern is the existence of static soliton solutions .",
    "the second problem is that the actions of the theory are not bounded from below .",
    "this feature makes the higher derivative theories unstable .",
    "the lagrangian and the hamiltonian formalism with higher derivative was firstly developed by ostrogradski  @xcite .",

    "the solutions of the equations of motion that are ill behaved in the limit @xmath109 are excluded from the very beginning  @xcite .",
    "we assume that the solution of eq.([eq_quanta ] ) can be written as @xmath110 substituting eq.([q ] ) into eq.([eq_quanta ] ) and taking time derivatives of these equations , we obtain the constraints for higher derivative terms @xmath111 combining these results , we find the perturbative equation of motion up to @xmath112 @xmath113 which is the equation for harmonic oscillator .",

    "then the topological lower bound including second derivative terms becomes @xmath145 with @xmath146 .",
    "though this formula is not based on any theory , it contains interesting information about the spectra of soliton .",
    "that is , ( [ lowerbound2 ] ) has the minima at @xmath147 for given @xmath65 .",
    "the energy bound is thus @xmath148 .",
    "let us summarize the numerical results presented in this section .",

    "interestingly , though at first glance our lower bound formula ( [ lowerbound2 ] ) has no 3/4-scaling behavior like ( [ lowerbound ] ) essential to knotted solitons @xcite , the energy at local minima recovers this scaling law .",
    "unfortunately , such minima can not be observed at present within our numerical framework . because , from the condition ( [ extermum2 ] ) , the value of @xmath65 should be almost twice of @xmath36 for @xmath37 , and four times for @xmath38 .",
    "otherwise , we need to take into account the higher order perturbation terms to employ totally different formalism to achieve these values .",
    "in this paper we have studied the skyrme - faddeev - niemi model and its extensions by introducing the reduction scheme of the su(2 ) yang - mills theory to the corresponding low - energy effective model . to simplify the matter , we proposed an ansatz for @xmath1 .",
    "that extensively reduced the computational time and did not affect to the property of the soliton solution .",
    "the requirement of consistency between the low - energy effective actions of the ym and the sfn type model leads us to take into account second derivative terms in the action .",
    "however , we found that such an action including the second derivative terms does not have stable soliton solutions .",
    "this is due to the absence of the energy bound in higher derivative theories .",
    "this fact inspired us to employ the perturbative analysis to our effective action . within the perturbative analysis",
    ", we were able to obtain soliton solutions .",
    "it should be noted that our solutions do not much differ from the solution of original sfn model , at least in the perturbative regime .",
    "we suspect that an appropriate truncation ( for instance `` extra fourth order term + second derivative term '' ) can supply stable solutions that are close to the original sfn model .",
    "thus we conclude that the topological soliton model consisting of the `` kinetic term + a special fourth order term '' like sfn model is a good approximation .",
    "our analysis is based on perturbation and the coupling constant @xmath65 is assumed to be small .",
    "however , wilsonian renormalization analysis of ym theory  @xcite suggests that the coupling constants @xmath149 ( and the mass scale parameter @xmath5 ) depend on the renormalization group time @xmath150 ( @xmath151 are infrared , ultraviolet cutoff parameter ) and they are almost comparable . to improve the analysis , we could perform the next order of perturbation , but it is tedious and spoils the simplicity of the sfn model unfortunately .",
    "we found numerically that the energy of the extended soliton solutions is linear in the coupling constant @xmath65 and then extracted a new mass formula for the soliton solutions including second derivative term .",
    "we expect that the global minima for the coupling constant @xmath65 exists and the corresponding energy becomes twice the value of the naive sfn action .",
    "of course , this statement is not based on any theory and we have to wait for its theoretical confirmation . since our mass formula was obtained from numerical study in the perturbative approach , it is uncertain whether such linear behavior is kept for larger coupling constant @xmath65 ( _ like _ twice of @xmath36 for @xmath37 and four times for @xmath38 ) . to confirm that , we should proceed to investigate next order perturbation , or ,",
    "otherwise , find some analytical evidence of this formula .",
    "we point out that the perturbative treatment is only used for excluding the ill behavior of the second derivative field theory .",
    "we believe that applying this prescription should not alter the essential feature of the soliton solutions , _",
    "e.g. _ , existence of the solutions , linear behavior of the mass spectra , _",
    "et.al._.    finally , let us mention the application of the soliton solutions to the glueball .",
    "obviously this is one of the main interest to study the model and , many authors have given discussions about this @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the possibility of the magnetic condensation of the qcd vacuum within the cho - faddeev - niemi - shabanov decomposed yang - mills theory have been studied by kondo@xcite .",
    "the author claims the existence of the nonzero off diagonal gluon mass @xmath152 , which is induced in terms of the condensation of the magnetic potential part of the decomposition @xmath153 , as @xmath154 throughout our calculation , we set the overall coupling constant @xmath6 in the action ( [ fsn_ac ] ) but , in this sense , it should reflect the information of such gluon mass , or the condensation property of the vacuum .",
    "after a careful examination of the value of the property of @xmath5 , we will be able to accomplish the detailed predictions for the glueball mass .",

    "<S> the skyrme - faddeev - niemi ( sfn ) model which is an o(3 ) @xmath0 model in three dimensional space up to fourth - order in the first derivative is regarded as a low - energy effective theory of su(2 ) yang - mills theory . </S>",
    "<S> one can show from the wilsonian renormalization group argument that the effective action of yang - mills theory recovers the sfn in the infrared region . </S>",
    "<S> however , the theory contains another fourth - order term which destabilizes the soliton solution . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we derive an extended action including second derivative terms and obtain soliton solutions numerically . </S>",
    "<S> a new topological lower bound formula is infered for the extended action . </S>"
