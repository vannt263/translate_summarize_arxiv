    ", we discuss the impact on the berry curvature of the interactions between bosons loaded in the honeycomb lattice with site energy imbalance , i.e. when the site energies of the two sub - lattices are different . in that case , the phase diagram depicts mott - insulating phases at half - integer filling , a feature that is shared with the energy imbalanced square lattice . on the other hand ,",

    "the displacements that move a @xmath2 site to a neighboring @xmath3 site are parameterized by bond vectors @xmath7     are represented by dark ( blue ) points in the figure , whereas @xmath3 sites are represented by light grey ( green ) points .",
    "the hopping amplitudes are all equal in ( a ) while in ( b ) the hopping term @xmath8 along links @xmath9 is different from the other three near neighbor hopping terms . ]",
    "atoms trapped in the lattice can hop from one site to the neighboring sites with amplitudes @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) corresponding to the four bond vectors . in the absence of interactions ,",
    "the hamiltonian in real space reads @xmath12 where @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the operator annihilating one particle on lattice site @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the atom number operator , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are chemical potentials for sublattice @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively . when all hopping amplitudes @xmath10 are the same , eq .   describes a standard square lattice .",
    "if @xmath19 , the lattice becomes the brick wall lattice which is topologically equivalent to the honeycomb lattice .",
    "using fourier transform , we obtain the hamiltonian in momentum space @xmath20 where @xmath0 is the bloch wave vector , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 is the total number of particles , and @xmath24 .",
    "the hamiltonian has the eigenvalues @xmath25 and eigenfunctions @xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 . for @xmath29 ,",
    "the gap between the two energy bands closes at @xmath30 , and exhibit the so - called dirac cone . to open a gap , one needs to imbalance the chemical potential between the @xmath2 and @xmath3 sites . in the following ,",
    "we always consider the gapped case , i.e. @xmath31 .    the berry curvature for each band of the hamiltonian   can be calculated as @xcite @xmath32 expanding the bloch wave vector @xmath0 over the reciprocal primitive vectors , @xmath33 , we find the berry curvature can be written as follows @xmath34\\sin(2\\pi\\alpha_2)-\\left[t_1 t_2 - t_3 t_4\\right]\\sin\\left(2\\pi\\alpha_1    \\right)\\bigg\\ } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have assumed real values for the hopping amplitudes . for the square lattice ( @xmath35 ) ,",
    "the berry curvature is always zero , reflecting the presence of both the inversion and the time - reversal symmetry in the system .",

    "when the interaction on a site is taken into account , the system can be described by the bose - hubbard hamiltonian @xmath54 where @xmath55 is given by , and @xmath56 is the on - site interaction strength .",
    "this is the hamiltonian we shall investigate in this study using two complementary methods that are described below .      the ground state of hamiltonian can be studied using the stochastic series expansion ( sse ) quantum monte carlo method with operator - loop updates @xcite .",
    "the sse is a finite - temperature qmc algorithm based on importance sampling of the diagonal matrix elements of the density matrix @xmath57 .",
    "there are no approximations beyond statistical errors . using the `` operator - loop '' cluster update , the autocorrelation time for the system sizes we consider here is at most a few monte carlo sweeps for the entire range of parameter space explored .",
    "the simulations are carried out on finite lattices with @xmath58 sites for @xmath59 up to 32 at temperatures sufficiently low in order to resolve ground - state properties of this finite system @xcite .",
    "estimates of physical observables in the thermodynamic limit are obtained from simultaneous finite - size and finite - temperature extrapolation to the @xmath60 limit .",
    "we consider here the soft - core boson case which allows multiple occupation to occur ( up to @xmath61 bosons per lattice site are allowed in the present study ) .",
    "periodic boundary conditions along the @xmath62 and @xmath63 axis have been used .      a well known mean - field method",
    "to solve the bose - hubbard model is the gutzwiller ansatz  @xcite , where the ground state wavefunction is assumed to be a tensor product of on - site wavefunctions : @xmath64 where @xmath65 represents the fock state of @xmath66 atoms occupying the site @xmath67 , @xmath68 is a cutoff in the maximum number of atoms per site , and @xmath69 is the probability amplitude of having the site @xmath67 occupied by @xmath66 atoms .",
    "minimizing the mean - field energy @xmath70 over the amplitudes @xmath69 allows us to determine the mean - field ground state properties as functions of the different parameters @xmath71 .",
    "for instance , the superfluid phase corresponds to a non - vanishing value of the order parameter @xmath72 , whereas the mott phase corresponds to a vanishing order parameter and the @xmath73 are pure fock states .",
    "in addition , the preceding ansatz   can be extended to the time domain giving us access not only to the bogoliubov excitations above the ground state , but also to the full mean - field evolution of the interacting wavefunction .",
    "more precisely , the time evolution is obtained by solving the following set of equations : @xmath74    the bogoliubov excitations are obtained by expanding the amplitudes @xmath75 around their ground state values @xmath76 , namely : @xmath77",

    "as we have observed ( see below ) , the mean - field ground state does not break the translation invariance , such that the values @xmath76 are the same for all _ equivalent _ sites , namely @xmath90 for all @xmath91sites and @xmath92 for all @xmath93sites . because of translation invariance , the bogoliubov eqs .",
    "can be diagonalized in momentum space , taking into account the bipartite nature of the lattice : @xmath94 for @xmath2 sites and @xmath3 sites respectively , leading to the following eigensystem @xmath95 where @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "@xmath98 has the same structure as @xmath83 , which leads to the usual property : if @xmath99 is an eigenstate for the energy @xmath100 , then @xmath101 is an eigenstate for the energy @xmath102 .",

    "one way to get a larger ( measurable ) effect consists of shifting abruptly the center of the trap at @xmath142 along the @xmath63-axis , such that the wavepacket experiences a net force in that direction . figure  [ fig : wp_st ] shows the evolution of the expectation value of the center of the wavepacket , i.e. , @xmath149 , after a shift of the trap center by 20 lattice spacings in the @xmath63 direction",
    ". as one can see , not only does the wavepacket evolve along the shifted center , but , at the same time , it moves along the transverse direction , i.e. the @xmath62-axis .",
    "similarly to the bloch oscillations , one has the following results : ( i ) nothing happens on the square lattice ; ( ii ) nothing happens when the shift is along the @xmath62-axis where the berry curvature always vanishes ; ( iii ) the displacement along @xmath62 is in the _ same _ direction whether the trap center is shifted towards the @xmath150 or the @xmath151 direction .",

    "in summary , we have shown that for bosons in the honeycomb lattice with energy imbalance , the berry curvature originally seen in the band structure , i.e. for the non - interacting system , is also present in the excitations above the ground state of the interacting system , in both the mott - insulating phase and the superfluid phase .",
