    ", we adopt an observations - based approach towards modelling the binary smbh population , in order to predict the range of gw signals in the pta frequency band . a similar study by @xcite , hereafter s13 , combined a plethora of observational estimates of the merger rate of massive galaxies , the gsmf and local smbh - galaxy relations to derive a range of possible gwb amplitudes .",

    "furthermore , some relevant uncertainties , such as in the possible redshift evolution of the smbh - galaxy relations , were not accounted for by s13 , and no predictions for individual gw sources were made . besides addressing these issues , this paper builds on previous studies in the following ways :    * we quantify the impacts of different observational uncertainties on the amplitude of the gwb generated by binary smbhs .",

    "we assume that the smbh - smbh coalescence rate is equivalent to the galaxy merger rate .",
    "this is justified because massive galaxy mergers are typically completed within a few galaxy dynamical times , whereas the timescales for two smbhs to form a gravitationally - bound binary and then coalesce through losses of energy and angular momentum to their environments and gws are much shorter ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "we write the total gsmf as a sum of the gsmfs of early- ( @xmath49 ) and late - type ( @xmath50 ) galaxies : @xmath51 we relate @xmath36 to @xmath11 for early- and late - type galaxies using a scheme described in  2.1.3 .",
    "to convert between @xmath11 and the central smbh masses ( @xmath8 ) we use the widely - known @xmath52 relation @xcite .",
    "in contrast to s13 , we express this relation as @xmath53 where @xmath54 denotes a normal probability density function with centre @xmath55 and variance @xmath56 and @xmath57 , @xmath58 and the intrinsic scatter , @xmath59 , are observationally - determined constants .",
    "it is important to account for intrinsic scatter in the @xmath52 relation when inferring the smbh mass function from the bulge mass function ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , because to not do so would lead to the smbh mass function being underestimated .",
    "observational estimates of @xmath60 require knowledge of the fraction of galaxies , @xmath61 , within a mass - complete sample at a given redshift that are undergoing mergers , and the proper time @xmath62 during which merger events can be observationally identified ( for a review , see * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite used a mock galaxy catalogue from a semi - analytic model implemented within the millennium simulation @xcite to estimate @xmath62 for galaxies with different masses at different stages of merging assuming circular galaxy orbits and angular momentum loss through dynamical friction .",
    "however , a suite of hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy mergers conducted by @xcite and @xcite , hereafter collectively l08 , resulted in significantly shorter merger timescales .",
    "while some authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) argue that these estimates are incorrect , at least for major mergers ( see footnote 15 of * ? ? ?",
    "analyses of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations combining dark matter and baryonic components suggest that the merger timescales assumed in semi - analytic models of galaxy formation and used by @xcite are overestimated for major mergers @xcite . furthermore , l08 presented estimates of @xmath62 specifically calibrated to the cas technique of @xcite using mock galaxy images . here , as a fiducial case",
    ", we only use the estimates of @xmath62 from l08 , specific to estimates of @xmath61 from both galaxy pair counts and cas analyses .",
    "these merger timescales were averaged over both field and cluster environments , and hence account for environmental dependencies . however , the simulation suite of l08 was not large enough to reveal significant mass- or redshift - dependence of @xmath62 .",
    "hence , we consider it possible that the weak dependencies on these quantities identified by @xcite may be present .",
    "we therefore have the three following estimates of the times between galaxy mergers : @xmath78 based on the work of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite respectively . while we consider each of equations [ eq : c7e7]@xmath4[eq : c7e9 ] to be equally possible , we choose equation  [ eq : c7e7 ] @xcite as a fiducial prescription . the possible mass- and redshift - dependence of @xmath60 is given by the factor @xmath79 @xcite ; we further consider it equally likely that this factor is present or absent , while choosing its absence as fiducial .",
    "together , there are then six different possibilities for @xmath60 that we consider , each with observational uncertainties .",
    "we also demonstrate the effects on the gw signal from binary smbhs of using systematically larger values of @xmath62 that are consistent with @xcite .",
    "the fitting formulae in equations [ eq : c7e7]@xmath4[eq : c7e9 ] are consistent with results at higher redshifts @xcite .",

    "uncertainties in @xmath60 for @xmath82 do not significantly affect our predictions for gw signals from binary smbhs , because , as we demonstrate , it appears that these signals are dominated by contributions from binary smbhs at lower redshifts .",

    "utilising uv to mid - ir galaxy photometry , with improved sensitivity and sky - coverage over previous compilations , these authors provide the most accurate determinations of the early- and late - type gsmfs currently available .",

    "stellar mass measurements are dominated by how the stellar populations are modelled ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "systematic errors in stellar mass measurements can lead to errors in the gsmf of greater than 0.6dex @xcite .",
    "@xcite present five separate determinations of the gsmfs of early- and late - type galaxies using different choices for the stellar population synthesis model and star formation history , as well as expanded possibilities for galaxy metallicities and dust attenuation laws .",
    "we assume that each of these five gsmf determinations , for which schechter function fits are given in table  3 of @xcite , are equally likely to be correct , but choose the default gsmf of @xcite , given in their table  1 , as fiducial .",
    "the method of colour selection used to identify early- and late - type galaxies adds further systematic uncertainty to the gsmf estimates .",
    "for example , @xcite showed that edge - on dusty spiral galaxies are in fact the reddest among the galaxy population , and that more than a third of a red - sequence sample of galaxies could be actively star - forming objects . while @xcite suggest further simple morphological selections based on galaxy light concentrations to mitigate these effects , these data were not available in the cosmos / ultravista catalogue .",
    "instead , we use a crude estimation of the uncertainty range of the gsmf caused by the colour selection from @xcite , who presented gsmfs determined for significantly different colour cuts to their fiducial scheme ( their table  4 ) .",
    "we consider this entire range of variability in the gsmf to be possible .",
    "we also demonstrate the effects on the resulting gw signal of possible contamination of colour - selected early - type galaxy samples with late - type galaxies in an extreme scenario by also performing our calculations with the early - type gsmf reduced by @xmath84 .",
    "the scheme we use to relate @xmath36 to @xmath11 for different types of galaxies is summarised as follows .",

    "these fractions change to 55% and 45% respectively for larger stellar masses .    while these results are quite approximate , and only derived for a low - redshift ( @xmath89 ) galaxy sample , we adopt them as a fiducial scheme for relating @xmath36 to @xmath11 for @xmath80 .",
    "this scheme is roughly consistent with that used by s13 .    in the same way as accounting for scatter in the @xmath52 relation raises the inferred smbh mass function ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the bulge mass function inferred from the gsmf will be raised given scatter in relating @xmath36 to @xmath11 .",

    "the galaxy mass ranges correspond to the values of @xmath36 of the larger galaxies in mergers .",

    "hence , within our model , the gwb is likely to be dominated by galaxy mergers involving only early - type galaxies ( s0s and ellipticals ) .      in the process of evaluating equation  [ eq : c7e18 ] , we also calculated the numbers of individual binary smbhs that produce monochromatic ( cw ) gw signals , along with the numbers of gw memory bursts emitted during smbh - smbh coalescence events .",

    "the characteristic amplitude of the sinusoidal toa variations induced by a binary smbh with strain amplitude @xmath115 at @xmath114 , over a 10yr observation , is @xmath161ns .",
    "scaling these cw source counts to other gw frequencies is non - trivial .",

    "then , the number of binaries per unit frequency emitting gws at or above a strain amplitude of @xmath115 , at a frequency @xmath17 , may be written as @xmath165 .",

    "( _ iii _ ) the most massive galaxies are typically found in cluster environments , where times between galaxy mergers may be shorter ( cf .",
    "* ) , implying a higher merger rate for these galaxies and hence a higher gw signal .",
    "however , we do not expect the inclusion of these factors to significantly affect our predicted gwb amplitudes .",
    "we reiterate that the effects of interactions between binary smbhs and their environments are unlikely to affect the predictions for the gwb amplitude at frequencies @xmath180hz @xcite , such as at @xmath20 .",
    "this is because the orbital evolution of binary smbhs radiating gws at these frequencies is expected to be predominantly gw - driven , which further leads to the circularisation of the orbits .    of all sources of uncertainty we consider in predicting the gwb amplitude given relevant observational quantities , the choice of galaxy merger timescale dominates the range of possible gwb amplitudes .",
    "furthermore , the merger timescale may be even more uncertain than the range spanned by the predictions we consider ( l08 ; * ? ? ?",
    "the simulations of l08 were conducted only for mergers between gas - rich disk galaxies , some of which contained small bulges , whereas we find that the gwb is likely dominated by binary smbhs formed in mergers solely between early - type galaxies .",
    "further theoretical studies of galaxy merger timescales for early - type systems are clearly required in order to better predict the gwb amplitude .",
    "the dominance of low - redshift ( @xmath196 ) early - type major galaxy mergers of massive ( @xmath156 ) galaxies in determining the gwb amplitude is a further important consequence of our work for both theoretical and observational studies of galaxy mergers aimed at informing pta research .",
    "the other significant source of uncertainty in our predictions is in the @xmath52 relation , both in its local form and in its possible redshift - evolution .",
    "in contrast to uncertainty in the galaxy merger timescale , it is likely that this uncertainty will only be resolved through further observations which significantly expand the sample of known smbh masses .",
    "promisingly , @xcite report that hundreds of smbh mass measurements may be possible with the atacama large millimetre array ( alma ) .",
    "under what circumstances could the gwb amplitude lie outside the range we predict given all uncertainties that we consider ?",
    "the predicted range of gwb amplitudes , @xmath0 , encompasses all purely observational uncertainties , as well as uncertainty ranges that we set for other quantities for which observational constraints are poor , such as the galaxy merger timescale .",
    "it may be possible that these latter ranges are incorrect .",
    "furthermore , not all galaxies may host a central smbh , as we have assumed .",
    "the interaction between a binary smbh and a third smbh would likely cause the least massive smbh to be ejected ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , lowering the number of coalescing smbhs .",
    "if not every massive galaxy at @xmath197 formed with a central smbh , the gwb amplitude would again be lowered . it may also be possible that binary smbhs do not always coalesce on timescales less than the times between galaxy mergers .",
    "the presence of a few strong gw emitters among the binary smbh population implies that some excess , non - gaussian scatter will be present in the gw signals produced by this population .",
    "the magnitude of this excess scatter in @xmath19 depends on exactly how many binary smbh systems contribute significantly to the gwb . using a semi - analytic galaxy formation model implemented in the millennium simulation @xcite , @xcite suggested that the statistics of toa variations induced by gws from binary smbhs are mildly non - gaussian for frequencies @xmath198 because of appreciable contributions to the squared characteristic strain spectrum , @xmath199 , from individual binaries at every gw frequency .",
    "figure  5 shows the number of binary smbhs in our fiducial model corresponding to galaxy mergers with primary stellar masses greater than or equal to a given @xmath36 ( top ) , as well as the fractions of @xmath200 contributed by these binaries ( bottom ) .",
    "we show in particular binaries radiating at a gw frequency of @xmath20 in a frequency bin of width @xmath142 .",
    "our fiducial model suggests that the contributions of individual gw sources to @xmath199 are lower than estimated by @xcite .",
    "for example , the modelling in @xcite found that one source contributed @xmath201 of @xmath199 at a frequency of @xmath202 in a frequency bin of width @xmath203 ( their figure  2 ) .",
    "in contrast , our empirical modelling in this paper suggests that the strongest @xmath204 sources in such a frequency bin contribute @xmath201 of @xmath205 .",
    "this work and @xcite clearly predict different numbers of the most massive binary smbhs .",
    "while this discrepancy will only be resolved with gw observations , we point out that the schechter functions for the gsmfs that we use under - predict observed galaxy counts at the highest masses and the lowest redshifts @xcite .",
    "hence , it is possible that our model under - represents the contributions of the most massive binary smbhs to the total gw signal .",
    "differing typical galaxy merger mass ratios in cluster and field environments ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are a further complicating factor .",
    "in this paper , we predicted the strength of the gwb from binary smbhs and the occurrence of individual binary smbh gw sources .",
    "our approach was to use a selection of recent observational estimates for the average times between major mergers for galaxies with @xmath12 and @xmath80 and for the gsmfs of early- and late - type galaxies in this mass and redshift range .",
    "we combined these quantities with empirical relations between galaxy and bulge stellar masses and between bulge and smbh masses .",
    "we find that while current ptas are unlikely to be sensitive to individual binary smbhs , a pta consisting of @xmath166100 pulsars timed with @xmath166100ns precision for 5yr will be sensitive to up to @xmath106 binary smbhs .",
    "such a pta may be achievable with the ska @xcite , but is possibly beyond the capabilities of fast @xcite .",
    "even such a pta will , however , have a less than 0.1% chance of detecting a gw memory burst from a coalescing binary smbh .",
    "thus , we conclude that while individual binary smbhs may be detectable with a pta based on next - generation radio telescopes , memory bursts from coalescing smbhs are not likely to be detectable with any envisaged pta .",
    "we predict that the characteristic strain amplitude of the gwb lies in the range @xmath0 with 95% confidence , accounting for a variety of uncertainties .",
    "the upper end of the predicted amplitude range is equivalent to the best published 95% confidence upper limit on the gwb amplitude @xcite .",
    "this reinforces the conclusion of @xcite that some models for the binary smbh population that are consistent with current electromagnetic observations are already inconsistent with pta constraints on the gwb .    the dominant uncertainty in predicting the gwb amplitude appears to be caused by differences in theoretical predictions for the major merger timescale of massive galaxies .",
    "higher values within our predicted range for @xmath19 correspond to the more commonly preferred choice of galaxy merger timescale ( l08 ) ; gwb amplitudes @xmath206 are within the sensitivity ranges of current and future ptas .",
    "we strongly urge further work on quantifying the galaxy merger timescale , in particular for the mergers between massive early - type galaxies at redshifts @xmath207 which are likely to host the dominant contributors to the gwb .",
