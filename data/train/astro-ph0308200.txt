    "the basic stellar components of the milky way are the thin disk , thick disk , stellar halo and central bulge , albeit that the inter - relationships and distinction amongst different components remains subject to some debate ( e.g.  norris & ryan 1991 ) . quantifying the properties of the stellar components of the milky way galaxy is of wide importance , since the multi - variate stellar distribution function is a product of galaxy formation and evolution and in turn constrains those processes that are important during and after the formation of the stars . the thick disk of the milky way galaxy was introduced by gilmore & reid ( 1983 ) based on their deep star counts towards the south galactic pole that were best fit by including a component with a scale - height some 34 times that of the old thin disk ; this component has the characteristics of ` intermediate population ii ' ( oort 1958 ) and is clearly seen in earlier star counts ( elvius 1965 ; weistrop 1972 ; yoshii 1982 ) . that the stellar population of the thick disk is distinct from that of the halo is seen clearly in colour magnitude diagrams derived from star count surveys ( e.g.  fig .  2 of gilmore , wyse & kuijken 1989 ;",
    "chen et al .  2001 ; fig .  4 here ) , and",
    "many derivations of the field kinematics and metallicity distributions have established its existence definitively .    however , even the structural parameters of these major stellar components of the galaxy are less well - established , and deep wide - area star counts are important in their determination .",
    "the flattening of the stellar halo , when combined with metallicity and kinematic information , can distinguish between models in which the halo formed with a little , or with a lot , of gaseous dissipation , and constrains the flattening of the dark matter halo ( e.g.  white 1985 ) .",
    "substructure in phase space is expected in hierarchical clustering theories of galaxy formation , and while the signature in kinematics may be more obvious and long - lived ( e.g.  helmi & white 1999 ; helmi et al .",
    "1999 ) , late accretion and merging may produce observable over - densities in coordinate space ( e.g.  johnston , hernquist & bolte 1996 ; zhang et al .",

    "the basic star catalogue is thus based on @xmath18-band magnitudes .",

    "we then exploit the overlap with the sdss early data release to isolate f - stars , thus targeting the turn - off of the stellar halo .",
    "the star count model we use is that developed by gilmore ( 1984 ; see also gilmore , reid & hewett 1985 and wyse & gilmore 1989 ) and includes a double - exponential thin disk , a double - exponential thick disk , and a de  vaucouleurs stellar halo .",

    "gilmore , wyse & jones 1995 ) .",
    "indeed the colour - magnitude relation of 47  tuc is adopted for the thick disk .",
    "the colour - magnitude relation of the metal - poor globular cluster m5 is adopted for the stellar halo .    to facilitate our determination of the flattening of the stellar halo we held all the structural parameters of this model fixed , with the exception of the stellar halo axial ratio .",
    "we adopted a solar galactocentric distance of 8  kpc , an old thin disk scale - height of 325  pc , a thin ( and thick ) disk scale length of 3.5  kpc , a thick disk scale - height of 1300  pc and thick - disk normalisation in the mid - plane , relative to the thin disk , of 2 per cent .",
    "the major - axis de  vaucouleurs radius for the stellar halo was fixed at 2700  pc .",
    "we made predictions for models with oblate stellar halos , with axial ratio @xmath32 in the range 0.45 - 0.80 , at a resolution of 0.01 , and all with a local normalisation of the stellar halo relative to the thin disk of 0.125 per cent ( cf .",

    "also shown are the predicted counts from the model with a range of flattening of the stellar halo ( the value of the axial ratio , @xmath32 , is given in parentheses in the fig .  2 , upper left ) .",
    "we quantified the fits of the models to the data as given in table  [ alldata ] and fig  [ fig3 ] , assuming that the errors on the counts are poisson errors plus a maximum 3 per cent systematic error to be added in quadrature , derived from our estimates ( see section  4 below ) of the reliability of our stellar classification . in the range",

    "@xmath38 ) .",
    "the rise for brighter magnitudes , where there are only @xmath39  stars in each field , is significant at only the @xmath40 level .",
    "the rise at fainter magnitudes may reflect real changes in the axial ratio with increasing galactocentric radius ( cf .",
    "hartwick 1987 ) although the signal would have to be produced by intrinsically bright ( and hence distant ) tracers .",
    "additionally , the presence of halo substructure could bias the result ( see below , section 4.3 ) .",
    "colour data for our star catalogue would allow us to identify particular spectral types of stars .",
    "the main sequence turn - off of the stellar halo is in the f - star region , and isolation of these stars maximizes the signal from the stellar halo , allowing a more sensitive testing of the flattening of the halo .",
    "further , we can derive statistical measures of substructure in the stellar halo from analysis of the f - star distribution alone .    as noted above , the area covered by the mgc overlaps with part of the sdss - edr ,",
    "specifically the sdss run  756 , stripe  10 .",
    "we identified all the objects in the sdss - edr stellar database that lay within the mgc strip .",

    "the final concentration , at @xmath56 , is due to thin disk stars , and reflects the insensitivity of the b and v bands to cool stars on the main sequence ( see gilmore & wyse 1987 for a comparison of the cmd in different band - passes ) .",

    "it is clear from the morphology of the cmd that one can not neglect the thick disk .",

    "these should be distributed isotropically across the sky and so while increasing the background somewhat , should not contribute a false clustering or flattening signal .",
    "hierarchical clustering scenarios of galaxy formation , such as in a cold - dark - matter - dominated universe , predict that the milky way formed from the merging of many smaller progenitors ( see e.g.  reviews of silk & wyse 1993 and white 1996 ) .",
    "the satellite galaxies of the milky way may be surviving examples of the earlier systems .",
    "it has been suggested that a significant part of the _ outer _ halo could be the result of accretion and merging of substructure ( cf .",

    "indeed there may be a ` ring ' around the milky way ( yanny et al .",
    "2003 ; ibata et al .",
    "2003 ) . these identified over - densities in the sdss data are at faint magnitudes , @xmath63 , corresponding to @xmath64 , or heliocentric distances of @xmath65kpc for metal - poor f - stars .",
    "most of the mass of the stellar halo lies interior to these distances and is sampled by the brighter stars .",
    "quantification of the level of substructure in these brighter stars ( the inner halo ) has heretofore been lacking in analyses of star counts .",
    "our present sample is ideal to quantify the clustering in the inner stellar halo , which contains the bulk of the steellar mass .",
    "this quantification of clustering has two applications , the first to constrain recent accretion , the second to estimate the possible effect of small - scale non - uniformities on our derivation of the larger - scale structure of the stellar halo .",
    "simulations ( e.g. johnston et al .",
    "1996 ) have shown that over - densities in coordinate space can survive for several orbital periods , albeit the alignment is dependent on the shape of the galactic potential ( longest for spherical potentials ) and on the time dependence of the potential ( e.g.  zhao et al .",
    "the present analysis may be expected to constrain accretion into the inner halo over the last few gyr , that being several orbital periods within several kpc of the sun s location . while the uniform old age of the bulk of the halo , seen again here in the location of the well - defined main sequence turn - off in fig .",
    "[ colmag ] , argues against the accretion of systems containing intermediate - age populations , such as the typical satellite galaxies , in the last @xmath66  gyr being important in general ( unavane et al .",
    "1996 ) , the accretion of systems with stellar populations similar to the old , metal - poor halo is better constrained by signatures in kinematics and coordinate space .      a first impression of the clustering of the stars can be seen by a simple analysis of counts - in - cells .",
    "the contour and surface plots that results from counts in cells of size 0.1  degree in dec and 5  degree in ra of the full mgc stellar distribution ( irrespective of colour , and with limiting magnitude @xmath67 ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ posplot ] ( note that there are around 10@xmath68 stars per square degree at these magnitudes , with fields at high latitude and intermediate longitude , corresponding to the counts per cell here being around 500 , and increasing towards the galactic center ) .",
    "the large scale gradient in the stellar distribution towards the direction of the galactic center is clearly seen .",
    "we removed this gradient by fitting a smooth quadratic to the stellar distribution in ra for each dec bin , and then dividing the actual number of stars in each cell by the `` model '' number of stars for that cell . in this way",
    "the large scale stellar distribution is taken out and only fluctuations due to random noise and/or stellar clustering are left , as shown in fig .",
    "[ posplot_ff ] .",
    "some fluctuations are seen in this plot , but all are at less than 1@xmath69 ( @xmath700.058 ) away from the mean @xmath71 .    utilising colour information from the sdss - edr and isolating just the selected f - stars provides the contour and surface plots shown in fig .  [ posplot_f ] ; note that by restricting the colour range the number of stars per field has reduced to several tens rather than the several hundreds for all stars .",
    "again fluctuations are seen , superimposed on the large scale gradient , but again at only low level of significance , at typical level of 1.27@xmath69 away from the mean .",
    "the colour selection to narrow the spectral type also allows us to use apparent magnitude as an approximate distance modulus , since the selected f - stars should have a fairly narrow range in absolute magnitude .",
    "one can then look for clustering along the line - of - sight .",

    "the rise in fig .",
    "[ magposplot ] shows the combination of the large scale stellar gradient and the stellar number count gradient , _ i.e. , _ more stars exist at fainter apparent magnitudes .",
    "the strongest signal seen in our sample is again at the faintest magnitudes , b@xmath72 , and at larger ra@xmath73 ; it is difficult to quantify the amplitude of the fluctuation due to the underlying increase in the star counts in both ra and apparent magnitude .",
    "as we will also see below , these values are close to the coordinates and apparent magnitude range of the detection of the tidal arm from the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy in a - stars , at distances of @xmath74  kpc ; this structure was identified in f - stars by newberg et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , at apparent magnitudes of @xmath75 . that tidal feature represents material lost in the most pericentre passage of the sagittarius dwarf , but tidal streams that were removed 12",
    "pericentre passages ago are predicted in some models of the evolution of the sagittarius dwarf ( e.g.  johnston et al .",
    "1999 ) to be seen in this direction at only 510  kpc from the sun .",
    "the predictions are illustrated in figure 4 of kundu et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , who made a preliminary detection of this structure in bright k giant stars .",
    "the analysis of the 2mass star counts by majewski et al .",
    "( 2003 ) also provides evidence of tidal debris from the sagittarius dwarf in this location .",
    "while it is almost inevitable that there will be some contamination of the f - star data by stars of other spectral types , this should be relatively small since our colour cuts were conservatively chosen to minimise any contamination , and thus only random errors in colour should contribute .",
    "thus we tentatively identify the apparent upwards fluctuation in counts with a tidal feature from the sagittarius dwarf .",
    "further evidence of this feature s reality comes from fig .",
    "[ posplot_rat ] , which compares the projected spatial distributions of the f - stars and the full stellar samples , by taking the ratio of the star counts . towards the end of the mgc strip",
    "there are bins in which the f - stars are more clustered . in other words ,",
    "the surface plot in the lower panel of fig  [ posplot_rat ] is not flat , which is what one might have expected if the f - stars were distributed in the same manner as the total stellar population .",
    "we now investigate other ways of quantifying this implied f - star clustering .",
    "an alternative means of quantifying clustering on the sky is through the well - known angular correlation function , @xmath76(@xmath77 ) .",

    "( 1985 ) derived the two - point correlation function of their large sample of faint , @xmath78 , galactic stars , derived from photographic plates covering @xmath79  square degrees at high galactic latitude , and showed that it was flat , consistent with a ` complete absence of clustering ' .",
    "these authors used this to argue that their star - galaxy separation was robust , and that patchy reddening was not important .",
    "they did not quantify what ` complete absence ' meant in terms of limiting the existence of substructure .",

    "they did not consider the clustering properties of more general field stars .",
    "here we want to quantify the ( absence of ? ) features seen in the stellar angular correlation function . of the different methods devised for measuring @xmath76(@xmath77 ) we adopt the method used in shanks et al .",

    "we follow the same methodology as doinidis & beers ( 1989 ) . in",
    "what follows , @xmath85 will be derived from the mean random number of pairs calculated from 200 simulations .",

    "the angular correlation functions are essentially flat , with zero mean angular correlation function , fully consistent with a random distribution and no excess clustering at greater than the 3-@xmath69 level of significance . in fig  [ wtf ]",
    "@xmath90 has both a mean and standard deviation of less than 0.005 .",
    "the fluctuations detected may reflect simply statistics , as indicated by the variation seen in simulated random distributions , or may be in part attributable to patchy reddening / extinction ( see hewett 1983 ) .",
    "to illustrate , the spatial distribution of stellar colour in bins of size 0.2@xmath91 by 0.1@xmath88 is shown in fig .",
    "[ cpp ] ( limited to the first two degrees of the survey ) ; although there is a mean of only 10 stars in each ra - dec bin , the standard deviation in colour ( @xmath92=0.2 ) is significantly smaller than the mean standard deviation of colour across all bins ( @xmath93=0.6 ) .",
    "this uniformity of the colour indicates that the observed fluctuations are not due to random errors alone but that patchy reddening may contribute to the fluctuations on scales less than a degree .",
    "thus the angular two - point correlation function shows only barely significant clustering .",
    "the angular correlation function contains only low - level suggestion of any clustering , indeed limiting substructure to very low amplitude .",
    "the counts - in - cells did reveal substructure , but again at low significance . when examining just the f - stars and the f - star - all star ratio ( see figs  [ posplot_f ] &  [ magposplot ] and [ posplot_rat ] ) we have found that there are some small overdensities of faint stars towards the end of the mgc strip , which if real could be associated with tidal debris from previous pericentre passages of th sagittarius dwarf .",
    "we now turn to more innovative tests for clustering , to see if they can either place more stringent limitations , or indeed reveal low - level clustering with more significance .    the lee 2d statistic ( lee 1979 ) has been used previously mostly in studies of substructure in clusters of galaxies , and indeed has been found to be the more sensitive test to the presence of structure ( rhee , van haarlem & katgert 1991 ) when compared to the angular separation test of west , oemler & dekel ( 1998 ; formally similar to the angular correlation function ) .",
    "a detailed discussion of the lee statistic can be found in fitchett ( 1988 ) .",
    "the lee 2d statistic is essentially a likelihood ratio , with the statistical analysis analogous to looking for the maximum likelihood split of a two - dimensional data set into two similar clumps .",
    "the lee statistic is calculated by projecting the data perpendicularly on to a line . at each point along this line a measure of the clumpiness of the data is found and a maximum determined , l(@xmath77 ) .",
    "the clumpiness is determined at each point / partition along the line by measuring the deviation away from the mean ( or gaussian distribution ) of all the points to the left and right of the partition .",
    "this is then compared to the deviation away from the mean of the total data set . in this way",
    "any underling large - scale structure gradient is `` flat fielded '' out as part of the analysis process .",
    "the line is then rotated by some small amount , @xmath94 @xmath77 , and the process is repeated . from this we can plot l(@xmath77 ) against @xmath77 , the maximum of which , l(@xmath77)@xmath95 , indicates the position angle of a line partitioning the data into two clumps . the lee 2d statistic has been used to look for substructure within galaxies , clusters of galaxies ( fitchett & webster 1987 ; rhee et al .",
    "1991 ) and in simulations of clusters ( crone , evrard & richstone 1996 ) .",
    "we now apply it to our high - latitude stellar data set .",
    "we first apply this test to the ( projected ) angular distribution on the sky of the entire mgc - sdss matched stellar data set .",
    "the data are shown in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ lee2d ] and the values of the lee statistic l(@xmath77 ) for this sample are shown in the upper panel .",
    "the position angle , @xmath96 , of the maximum of the lee statistic is indicated in the lower panel .",
    "the l(@xmath77 ) curve shows a rather broad peak , indicating only a low - significance detection of an over - density ; a stronger detection would result in a more obvious peak .",
    "the value of the angle at which the lee statistic has its maximum , @xmath97 , indicates that the overdensity is located towards the top right of the lower plot , again at high values of ra ( as in the earlier statistical tests ) .",
    "the significance of this detection can be quantified by the analysis of randomly distributed datasets .",
    "thus we fill the mgc survey area with the same number of stars as found in the high latitude sample , but randomly distributed ( remember that any large - scale gradient is removed by the analysis technique ) .",
    "[ lee2d_sim ] shows the simulated dataset , as well as the corresponding l(@xmath77 ) plot .",
    "the angle at which l(@xmath77)@xmath95 occurs is now 90.7@xmath88 , the slight offset from the perpendicular being understandable as due to the uneven distribution of mgc exclusion regions .",
    "we note that for the simulated data the @xmath98 statistic is higher , indicating a more significant detection ( of the mgc holes ) , than in the real data .",
    "this can be explained by noting that in the simulations there was no minimum star - star separation used .",
    "therefore the simulated stellar distribution will be slightly smoother than the real data , making the effects of the mgc holes more apparent in the simulation .",
    "this implies that any result from the lee 2d test will provide only a rough estimate on the size of the clustering signal .",
    "the lack of a minimum star - star separation in the simulated data should not have affected the @xmath99 test as it is only dependent on the number of stars at a given radius and not their distribution about a partition .",
    "taking the ratio of l(@xmath77)@xmath100 @xmath101 for the simulated and real data we find that the over - density seen in the mgc region is detected at 8 per cent @xmath102 above a smooth stellar distribution .    to summarise the lee 2d scheme , a line at some angle , @xmath77 , is drawn dividing the data in half .",
    "every star is then projected onto that line , defining a partition point for each star .",
    "the clumpiness / asymmetry parameter l@xmath103 is then calculated for all stars / partitions along the line and the largest value of l@xmath103 is found for that line / angle .",
    "the mgc ra and dec coordinates of the star whose partition gave that value of l@xmath103 is then used as the coordinates of the over - density . by doing this for the entire stellar sample from the mgc , we find a weak clustering signal at ra=@xmath104 and dec=@xmath105 , consistent with visual inspection of the distribution of the stars .",
    "this is consistent with the counts - in - cells analysis , and again if real can be a combination of a - stars from the distant , most recent , tidal debris from the sagittarius dwarf ( cf .",
    "yanny et al .",
    "2000 ; vivas et al .",
    "2001 ; ibata et al .",
    "2001 ) , and f - stars from an older , more nearby , tidal stream .    having shown that the lee 2d statistic is sensitive to substructure , we now investigate the signal for the inner halo by using only the brighter f - stars , in the magnitude range @xmath106 . figs .",
    "[ lee2d_f ] and [ lee2d_simf ] show the results of the lee 2d test for the real and simulated ( random distribution ) f - star population .",
    "we find a slightly stronger clustering signal by isolating f - stars , with an amplitude of 14 per cent deviation from a random distribution , with the clustering now placed at ra=@xmath107 and dec=@xmath105 .",
    "again this places it within the 2-d coordinate space covered by a sagittarius dwarf tidal stream , with the inferred distances ( if f - stars and not a - star contamination ) pointing to debris from an older pericentre passage ( johnston et al .",
    "we find no other evidence of clustering .",
    "although there is no strong detection of structure within the galactic halo sampled , we decided , to be conservative , to re - fit the star - count models to a restricted sub - sample .",
    "we now fit to star count data at @xmath108 and for data in the range @xmath108 and @xmath109 ( see tables  [ data1 ] & [ data2 ] ) .",
    "this was done to minimize the contributions from the thin / thick disks and the thin / thick disks and bulge respectively .",
    "note that this longitude cut also serves to remove any effects of the sagittarius dwarf tidal stream .",
    "[ chisqu ] shows the effect of removing the low latitude and high longitude fields from the @xmath110 fitting ; a stellar halo with an axial ratio of @xmath111=0.52@xmath360.05 now provides the best fit to the data .",
    "the sample is dominated by stars within @xmath4  kpc of the sun , and this axial ratio thus applies to the inner halo .",
    "a further refined sample contains only mgc - sdss matched stars with @xmath112 .",
    "although there are 2418 fewer stars in this subsample than in the full stellar sample 1021 of the rejected stars having @xmath113 , this sub - sample should now be free from any spurious effect that may have been induced by the possible inclusion of qsos ( previously identified as the fuzzy patch in fig .",
    "[ colcol ] ) .",
    "table  [ data3 ] shows the best fit halo axial ratio in each magnitude bin for the sample with galactic latitude and longitude cuts , and fig .",
    "[ chisqu2 ] compares the results from this reduced sample to the original one .",
    "in fact the @xmath110 values and overall shape of the `` axial - profile '' remain more or less the same .",
    "it is only the value of the halo axial - ratio that has changed , with the reduced sample preferring a slightly more flattened halo , with @xmath114 .",
    "note that as the models are only generated within the range @xmath115 , any ` best - fit ' model with an axial ratio less than 0.45 is spurious and simply represents a lack of stars within the magnitude bin and @xmath116 and @xmath117 range being tested .",
    "the star - count models are then fitted to the full mgc stellar sample , to the mgc - sdss sample ( i.e. no colour cuts ) and to the f - star sample in the magnitude range @xmath118 , both with and without the @xmath116 and @xmath117 cuts . in doing this",
    "we find that the best fit comes from the full mgc stellar sample with both the @xmath116 and @xmath117 cuts and gives an axial ratio of ( c / a)=0.61 @xmath360.02 .",
    "however , the axial ratio with the smallest error is given by the f - star sample , again with both the @xmath116 and @xmath117 cuts , ( c / a)=0.56@xmath360.01 .",
    "this is again sampling the inner halo .    in comparing our results with previous work",
    "we find that our final value is in very good agreement with the pioneering work of kinman , wirtanen & janes ( 1965 ) who reported ( c / a ) = 0.6 for the stellar halo interior to the sun , based on a small ( less than 100 ) sample of bright rr lyrae stars .",
    "indeed most star - count analyses of the inner halo give a flattening of this order ( e.g.  hartwick 1987 ; wyse & gilmore 1989 ; larsen & humphreys 1994 , 2003 ; siegel et al .",
    "2002 ) , consistent with anisotropic velocity dispersions ( wyse & gilmore 1989 ; chiba & beers 2000 )",
    ". the outer stellar halo may be rounder ( e.g.  hartwick 1987 ; preston , shectman & beers 1991 ) , perhaps reflecting a differing importance of dissipation during formation of the inner and outer halo ( cf .",
    "norris 1994 ; chiba & beers 2001 ) .",
    "a detailed investigation of the variation of flattening with distance is beyond the scope of the limited data given here , but well within the scope of the final sdss dataset .",
    "however we do note that our more local f - star analysis yields a marginally significantly lower ( c / a ) than the full stellar population .",
    "furthermore we note that within our analysis we see a marginal increase in ( c / a ) with magnitude ( distance ) , ( fig .  3 , 20 , & 21 ) , however this",
    "could also be explained by contamination from the qso and/or galaxy population at the star - galaxy separation limit .",
    "we have used a sample of 42457 stars from the mgc - bright photometric catalogue , most of which ( @xmath119 per cent ) have sdss - edr counterparts , to investigate the structure of the stellar halo of the milky way .",
    "the mgc - sdss matched objects were used to define colour selection limits allowing us to isolate a sample of f - stars .",
    "our major results are the first quantification of the clustering in coordinate space in the inner halo , plus a new estimate of the large - scale flattening of the inner halo .",
    "we conclude that the stellar halo of the milky way is significantly flattened , with an axial ratio of ( c / a)=0.56@xmath360.01 ( within @xmath120 kpc ) . while this result is in line with previous determinations , it is more robust , having been derived from samples cleaned of substructure and with contamination from quasars and other stellar components minimised .",
    "we find weak evidence for substructure in the brighter f - stars , tentatively identified with tidal debris from the sagittarius dwarf .",
    "we find no other substructure .",
    "this essentially null result implies that recent accretion of stellar systems is not important in the bulk of the stellar halo .",
    "quantification of limits on the disruption rate of putative satellites needs to be investigated , but is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "however these firm limits of observable clustering need to be included in future hierarchical clustering models .",
