    "both cosmic star formation rate and active galactic nucleus ( agn ) density have been found to reach their peaks at @xmath32 @xcite . in the local universe , a supermassive black hole ( smbh )",
    "generically exists in the center of early - type galaxies with the black hole mass tightly correlating with that of the galaxy s stellar bulge @xcite .",
    "the connection and co - evolution between the central smbh and host galaxy have therefore been suggested @xcite . in one of the most popular co - evolution scenarios ,",
    "galaxy mergers have been proposed to funnel gas into the center of galaxies , leading to a central starburst and rapid growth of a smbh @xcite .    one promising approach to investigate the merger - driven co - evolution scenario is to study the merger features in agn host galaxies .",
    "however , previous studies have produced mixed results .",
    "on one side , the most moderate - luminosity x - ray selected agn hosts ( @xmath4erg  s@xmath5 ) have similar disk - dominated morphologies as those of non - active galaxies , showing no significant difference in the distortion fraction , both at @xmath6 @xcite and at @xmath7 @xcite . on the other side ,",
    "the high merger fraction ( @xmath8 ) has been found in a subsample of the bright ( @xmath9erg  s@xmath5 ) , dust - reddened quasars @xcite .",
    "this may lead to an explanation that merger fraction is dependent on agn bolometric luminosity @xcite .",
    "there are also theoretical studies suggesting that galaxy mergers only trigger luminous agn activity while other internal mechanisms may be responsible in less luminous agns @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is crucial to examine the connection between the most luminous agns and merger fractions .",
    "however , host morphological studies of the most luminous agns ( @xmath9erg  s@xmath5 ) at @xmath7 are rare in the literature . for the luminous blue agns ,",
    "such studies have been challenged by the bright point source , even with the careful treatment of point source substraction @xcite .",
    "the present sampling in deep and narrow surveys has biased against the luminous x - ray selected agns .",
    "nasa s _ wide - field infrared survey explorer _",
    "( _ wise _ ; wright et al . 2010 ) all - sky survey provides an opportunity to search the most luminous galaxies at mid - infrared wavelengths . @xcite and @xcite discovered a new population of hyperluminous , hot dust - obscured galaxies ( thereafter hot dogs ) using a so - called `` w1w2 dropout '' selection criteria .",
    "follow - up studies have revealed several key aspects of this population : ( 1 ) spectroscopic follow - up studies show that they are mostly high - redshift objects , with redshift range from 1 to 4 @xcite .",
    "( 2 ) most of hot dogs are extremely luminous with @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "( 3 ) using x - ray observations @xcite and spectral energy distribution ( sed ) analysis ( assef et al . 2015a ; fan et al .",
    "2016a ) , clear evidence has been shown that their luminous mid - ir emission is powered by a highly dust - obscured , possibly compton - thick agn .",
    "thanks to the heavy obscuration of circumnuclear dust , the host morphology of this population is easily observable .",
    "thus hot dogs are ideal objects for us to investigate the merger fraction in the most luminous agns .    in this letter",
    ", we examine the host morphology of 18 hot dogs , which have _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ wide - field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) near - ir high - resolution imaging . our target is to provide some knowledge about the merger fraction in the most luminous agns . throughout this work",
    "we assume a flat @xmath11cdm cosmology with @xmath12 km  s@xmath5 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 .",
    "the hot dogs studied here are selected from the _ wise _   all - sky source catalog @xcite . in order to investigate the host morphology of hot dogs , we select a subsample of 18 objects ( table 1 ) with available _ hst _ wfc3 imaging .",
    "we also require that they have known spectroscopic redshift in the literature @xcite for calculating their bolometric luminosities .",
    "to investigate the host morphology of hot dogs , we use the high resolution _ hst _ wfc3 near - ir imaging .",
    "we search our targets and retrieve the calibrated images from mast .",
    "observations are from four different hst proposals with i d 12488 ( pi : m. negrello ) , 12585 ( pi : s. petty ) , 12481 and 12930 ( pi : c. bridge ) .",
    "we list hst proposal i d for each object in table 1 .",
    "all but one ( w0831 + 0140 ) use the _ f160w _ ( @xmath15-band ) imaging . only w0831 + 0140 use the _ f110w _ imaging .",
    "the wfc3 imaging has a pixel scale of 0.13 arcsec / pixel .",
    ".the sample of hot dogs[tbl - sample ] [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "we find a high merger fraction ( @xmath1 ) in the hot dog sample , using the visual classification described in section 3 . given the high agn bolometric luminosity ( @xmath16 ) in the hot dog sample , this finding provides a clear evidence that the most luminous agns have likely been related to galaxy mergers . in order to investigate the dependence of merger fraction on agn bolometric luminosity , we compile the data in the literature and plot them in figure 2 .",
    "gray diamonds are taken from the compilation of @xcite .",
    "red and purple symbols , which represent the samples at intermediate redshift @xmath6 and at @xmath7 , respectively , are taken from the recent works @xcite .",
    "our result for the hot dog sample has been shown as red asterisk . among all available data ,",
    "our sample is the second brightest , which has the bolometric luminosity only lower than that of the dust - reddened qso sample in @xcite .",
    "an obvious trend can be found in figure 2 that the merger fraction increases with agn bolometric luminosity at high luminosity , while the merger fraction shows a weak dependence on agn bolometric luminosity for the less luminous agns .",
    "we compare the observed trend with the variability - driven model of @xcite ( red and blue lines in figure 2 ) .",
    "red and blue lines show the predictions of @xcite model at @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "the merger fraction in our sample agrees well with the model prediction at @xmath7 .",
    "in other samples at @xmath7 of mid - ir luminous qsos ( red square , del moro et al .",
    "2016 ) , compton - thick agns ( red triangle , lanzuisi et al . 2015 ) and dust - reddened qsos ( red point , glikman et al .",
    "2015 ) , the merger fractions also show a good agreement with the model prediction .",
    "as suggested by @xcite , galaxy merger , especially major merger , may play the most significant role in triggering the most luminous agns at @xmath7 .    in figure 3",
    ", we show the distribution of srsic  indices in our hot dog sample .",
    "the distribution peaks at @xmath19 , ranging from disk - dominated ( @xmath20 ) , disk with a prominent bulge component ( 1.5@xmath21n@xmath213.0 ) to bulge - dominated ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "the fractions of disk - dominated , intermediate and bulge - dominated morphologies are 22.2% , 61.1% and 16.7% , respectively , in our hot dog sample .",
    "we remind the reader that a single srsic  model wo nt provide a good fitting for several heavily distorted hot dogs .",
    "for instance ,",
    "both w0851 + 3148 and w2207 + 1939 have significantly morphological distortions ( see figure 1 ) and the results of a single srsic  model fitting have a large value of the reduced @xmath23 ( > 5 ) .",
    "however , for most of our hot dogs , the single srsic  model still provides a reasonable fitting . conservatively speaking ,",
    "the srsic  profile with @xmath24 can describe the distribution of most stars in hot dogs .",
    "our result suggests that most of our hot dogs have an intermediate morphology ( disk with a prominent bulge component ) .",
    "the intermediate morphology of hot dogs has been expected in the merger - driven scenario if hot dogs lie at the transient stage when major mergers with gas - rich disks are building galaxy bulge .",
    "automatically morphological classification provides an independent check on the reliability of our visual classification .",
    "the @xmath25 and @xmath26 values of our hot dogs range from 0.47 to 0.79 with a median value 0.70 , and from @xmath27 to @xmath28 with a median value of @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "we employ the @xmath30 parameters to locate major mergers using the merger criteria of lotz et al .",
    "13 out of 18 hot dogs fulfill the relation @xmath31 , indicating them as mergers .",
    "the high merger fraction ( @xmath3272% ) derived here is well consistent with the result of our visual classification .",
    "in this letter , we use the high resolution _ hst _ wfc3 near - ir imaging to derive the merger fraction in a subsample of 18 hot dogs by visual classification .",
    "we find that the merger fraction is high ( @xmath1 ) for our hot dog sample .",
    "the high merger fraction in these most luminous , heavily - obscured agns are consistent with the predictions of hydrodynamical simulations @xcite and the variability - based model @xcite .",
    "we also derive the agn bolometric luminosity by using ir seds decomposition .",
    "the heavily obscured agns in hot dogs are among the most luminous agns in the universe ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the cold dust emissions in hot dogs are also significant ( see table 2 ) , indicating that there resides intense starburst in the hosts .",
    "both intense agn and starburst activities are likely triggered by mergers as suggested by the high merger fraction .",
    "however , the lack of a comparison sample may weaken the merger - driven explanation of hot dogs . unfortunately , it is hard to select a suitable comparison sample , as both the stellar masses and black hole masses of hot dogs are not well known .",
    "the stellar mass upper bounds of hot dogs derived from sed modeling by @xcite are about @xmath33 .",
    "massive and inactive galaxies at @xmath34 show a relatively low fraction of strong distortion morphologies .",
    "for instance , only @xmath35 galaxies in an inactive galaxy sample with the median stellar mass @xmath36 show major merger features @xcite .",
    "this indirect evidence suggests that the high merger fraction in our hot dog sample is likely responsible for triggering the intense agn activities .",
    "according to fitting the surface brightness profiles , we find that the distribution of srsic  indices of hot dogs peaks around 2 , which suggests that most of hot dogs have intermediate morphologies . from the point of view of morphology , this work confirms our previous result ( fan et al .",
    "2016a ) , which suggests that hot dogs may represent a transit phase during the evolution of massive galaxies , transforming from the dusty starburst dominated phase to the optically bright qso phase .",
    "we can find that all samples with high merger fraction are dust - reddened @xcite and/or ir - luminous ( this work ) in figure 2 . while for the blue , luminous qsos , no high merger fraction or no enhancing merging feature has been found .",
    "for instance , @xcite recently studied an uv / optical - selected @xmath37 qso sample with high super - massive black hole masses ( @xmath38 ) , which are comparable to the estimated smbh masses of hot dogs @xcite .",
    "they found that the strong distortion fraction for qso hosts is low and comparable to that of inactive galaxies .",
    "they therefore concluded that major mergers are not the primary triggering mechanism for agn activity .",
    "the results between us look contradictory .",
    "however , the problem can be solved if considering that uv / optical - selected qsos and ir - selected obscured qsos represent distinct phases in the merger - driven evolutionary sequence @xcite . in the merger - driven evolutionary model , gas - rich galaxy mergers fuel an intense starburst and a phase of obscured bh growth , followed by an unobscured phase after the gas is consumed or expelled from the galaxy by qso feedback .",
    "dusty starburst like smgs and bump dogs may represent the early stage of the mergers .",
    "they are expected to have a high merger fraction , which has already been observed ( e.g. , bussmann et al .",
    "ir - luminous agns are in an intermediate stage of the mergers .",
    "thus the strong merger features still present in their host galaxies . as a result",
    ", a high merger fraction will be derived according to morphological classification . while for unobscured qsos whose hosts are found to be largely elliptical galaxies , they are in a late stage of mergers , just before the host galaxies settling into passive elliptical galaxies .",
    "we suggest that both high luminosity and obscuration should be essential for observing the high merger fraction in agn hosts .",
    "we emphasize that this conclusion is only valid for radio - quiet agns while it may be another story for radio - loud agns @xcite .",
    "a similar evolutionary sequence has also been proposed by @xcite involving x - ray selected agn , infrared selected obscured agn , dust - reddened quasars and unobscured agn ( see their figure 10 ) .",
