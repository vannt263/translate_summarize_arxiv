    "hot subdwarf b stars ( hereafter : sdb ) are horizontal branch stars that consist of helium - rich cores surrounded by thin hydrogen envelopes .",
    "the helium core in each sdb star sustains nuclear burning of helium into carbon and oxygen , though in some cases the core may have exhausted helium at the center .",
    "their progenitors are low - mass , main sequence stars , and each is likely to have undergone a core helium flash ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "once hydrogen in the core is exhausted , it evolves towards the tip of the red giant branch , where an sdb progenitor retains less than 0.01@xmath5 of hydrogen during ( or prior to ) the helium flash .",
    "those red giant stars lie on the high @xmath6 ( @xmath730000k ) end of the horizontal branch .",
    "this small fraction of hydrogen has an influence on the future evolution of sdb stars .",
    "since hydrogen - shell burning can not be sustained by a thin hydrogen envelope , the stars will move directly to the white dwarf cooling track instead of going through the asymptotic giant branch phase .",
    "several mechanisms for producing this small residual hydrogen envelope involving single - star or binary evolution have been proposed ; _",
    "@xcite ; @xcite .",
    "the sdb stars have effective temperatures and surface gravities near 30000k and @xmath85.5 , respectively .",
    "it has been more than 14 years since the discovery of the first pulsating sdb star ( hereafter sdbv , * ? ? ?",
    "this star and several other stars discovered later were dominated by short period oscillations , which were identified as pressure ( p - modes ) modes by @xcite .",
    "they are driven in the envelopes and have allowed us to use asteroseismology to study the interiors of sdb stars .",
    "several years later , @xcite reported the discovery of another kind of variation in sdb stars .",
    "these brightness changes were smaller in amplitude and longer in period . according to the work done by @xcite , the new ,",
    "longer period variations were assigned to gravity modes ( g - modes ) which dominate cooler , lower - gravity sdb stars .",
    "the g - modes in sdb stars probe deeper than p - modes and should allow us to study different parts of sdb stars .",
    "recently , @xcite used g - mode period spacings for mode identifications in sdb stars .",
    "it was found that @xmath9=1 period spacings were roughly 250sec while @xmath9=2 spacings were approximately 150sec .",
    "there are sdb stars pulsating in both p- and g - modes at the same time .",
    "these stars are the most favorable , since they allow us to probe larger parts of those stars . at first ,",
    "only p - mode dominated , hybrid sdbv stars were detected from the ground , but the _ kepler _ spacecraft has discovered several hybrid stars where the g - modes dominate across the entire amplitude spectrum @xcite .",
    "nonradial pulsations can be described using spherical harmonics with quantized indices @xmath10 , @xmath9 , and @xmath11 , where @xmath10 corresponds to the radial order of the mode , @xmath9 is the number of nodal lines on the surface , and @xmath11 is the number of those lines passing through the poles . following the formalism given in @xcite , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the shifted frequency and @xmath14 is the ( degenerate ) frequency without rotation .",
    "if the ledoux constant @xmath15 is estimated and the multiplet splittings @xmath16 are measured , we can derive the rotation frequency @xmath17 .",
    "it should be remembered that this equation is valid for slow , solid - body rotators with pulsation periods much shorter than the rotation period . in the absence of rotation ,",
    "all modes of the same degree but with differing @xmath11 values are present in pulsating stars , but they are degenerate in frequency , though they differ in angular eigenfunctions . in this case , we only see the @xmath14 frequency",
    ". however , rotation lifts the degeneracy in @xmath11 , resulting in @xmath18 periodicities with different frequencies .",
    "periodicities with positive and negative @xmath11 are shifted in the opposite direction of @xmath14 .",
    "the @xmath11=0 frequency remains unaffected by rotation .",
    "it is generally accepted that p - modes detected in sdb stars are of low order and of low degree .",
    "the ledoux constant for such modes is typically close to zero .",
    "however , for the fundamental and first overtone @xmath9=2,3 modes , @xmath15 may have values up to 0.3 @xcite .",
    "this increase in the ledoux constant creates a decrease in the frequency splittings . in the case of high - order g - modes ,",
    "the ledoux constant depends on the @xmath9 parameter according to the following equation : c@xmath19 .",
    "it is around 0.5 for @xmath9=1 and close to 0.16 for @xmath9=2 .",
    "if we assume a star rotates as a solid body , the ratio of the ledoux constants between the p- and g - mode regions can be used to constrain the degree of the g - modes",
    ". a p / g splitting ratio of 0.55 indicates @xmath9=1 g - modes and a ratio of 0.81 indicates @xmath9=2 g - modes .",
    "observations of long period sdbv stars , including detection of new pulsators , are not easy from the ground .",
    "relatively long period photometric variations ( with only a few cycles per night ) can be affected by variable sky transparency .",
    "to make a definitive determination of the pulsation frequencies requires extended photometric campaigns , preferably at several sites widely spaced in longitude to reduce day / night aliasing .",
    "however , _ kepler _ provides long - duration , continuous , homogenous , evenly spaced time - series photometry , making it an ideal instrument for asteroseismology .",
    "the _ kepler _ science goals , mission design , and overall performance are reviewed by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this is currently the state - of - the - art way to observe variable stars . with this instrument",
    ", we can reach down to 19mag and still achieve better signal - to - noise ( s / n ) observations than from the ground .",
    ".details on kic10139564 .",
    "the last row reports the number of dates used in our analysis . starting and ending points",
    "are given in bjd and are shifted to 2455000.0 epoch . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     if quarterly data did not provide a solution for a given region , we examined them using shorter data sets . we calculated amplitude spectra for sets of data spanning 50 , 60 and 70 days , avoiding the gap between days 270 and 290 .",
    "the top panels of figure[figmessy ] and table[mults ] show our solution for the region near 6001@xmath20hz .",
    "there appears to be some frequency wandering , but from these subsets of data , we estimate frequencies lie near 6001.10 , 6001.47 and 6001.88@xmath20hz , which give an overall separation of 0.39@xmath20hz , roughly the established rotational multiplet splitting",
    ". most likely , this region contains a triplet with a separation of the spin period .",
    "the situation near 6173@xmath20hz is more complex ( figure[figmessy ] ) , largely because the amplitudes become very low between days 130 to 220 and after day 330 .",
    "additionally , there are more frequencies involved in this region which covers @xmath21hz .",
    "it appears there is a triplet near 6170.83 , 6171.17 and 6171.66@xmath20hz , which switches power from the right pair to the center frequency to the outside pair prior to day 150 .",
    "then another triplet , which is modest at the beginning , gets even weaker in the middle but comes back at the end of the run .",
    "these frequencies are near 6172.39 , 6172.83 and 6173.32@xmath20hz , which would be another triplet . however , these can not both be @xmath9=1 triplets , since they are too close together , so one of them is likely a part of an @xmath9=2 multiplet .",
    "this region , which is shown in the bottom panels of figure[figmessy ] , is very complex , and we can only roughly estimate the frequencies of table[mults ] .",
    "any interpretations are fairly speculative .",
    "we estimate that this region contains two distinct triplets with splittings of the rotation period , but we certainly can not rule out a single multiplet .    the last region we discuss is near 6235@xmath20hz ( figure[fig6235 ] ) . in this region , there is a high amplitude peak in the overall amplitude spectrum with two sidelobes , none of which prewhiten well . breaking the data into 60-day subsets to resolve the frequencies",
    "clarifies what is occurring . in this case the main frequency f@xmath22 at 6234.7 is frequency and phase stable with an amplitude that diminishes after day @xmath780 .",
    "there are two other periodicities , both with frequencies and amplitudes that vary during the observations . the higher frequency ( f@xmath23 ) drifts from 6235.07 to 6235.02@xmath20hz and back again during the run , while the lower frequency drifts from 6234.4 to 6234.2@xmath20hz prior to day 180 , after which it is no longer detectable .",
    "this is shown in figure[fig6235 ] where the original amplitude spectra are shown in the top panels , the amplitude spectra prewhitened by f@xmath22 in the middle panels and the amplitudes and phases in the bottom panels . clearly",
    "the amplitudes of all frequencies are variable .",
    "the amplitudes for f@xmath24 are only significant for the fits centered at days 90 and 150 while the amplitude for f@xmath25 continually declines until by day 380 it is no longer significant .",
    "we also attempted to disentangle the region near 6314@xmath20hz using these techniques , but we were not able to establish reasonably stable frequencies .",
    "the estimated frequencies for these regions appear in table[mults ] .",
    "kic10139564 is the only p - mode dominated sdbv star observed by _",
    "kepler_. it was discovered during the survey phase of the mission and has been observed continuously in sc mode since the start of the second year .",
    "the sc mode allows us to study short period pulsations that would be unobservable with lc sampling .",
    "kic 101539564 contains frequencies higher than the nyquist frequency associated with the sc sampling interval , but thanks to the long duration of these observations the barycentric correction induces frequency modulations that resolves the ambiguity of modes reflected across the nyquist frequency into the subnyquist region .        .",
    "[ fig6235 ]    the amplitude spectrum calculated from 15months of nearly continuous data shows more than 50 periodicities in a pulsation zoo , which includes both anticipated and exotic species .",
    "we detected the anticipated p - modes , found several g - modes and two periodicities between the p- and g - mode regions .",
    "these possibly mixed modes have been observed in some other sdbv stars @xcite , and are particularly abundant in the complex pulsator 2m1938 + 4603 @xcite .",
    "the highest amplitude is around 8ppt , and only a few other frequencies are of comparable height .",
    "most of the signal is below 0.5ppt , which would be difficult to detect from the ground .",
    "almost all periodicities are split into frequency multiplets .",
    "we interpret this splitting as caused by rotation and derive an average rotation period of 25.6@xmath01.8days .",
    "the observed splittings vary by a small amount , leading to an uncertainty in the rotation period .",
    "this is most likely caused by small differences in the ledoux constant as has been observed in models calculated by @xcite .",
    "the scale of variation in the ledoux constant matches the variation in frequency spacings .",
    "the exact rotation rate can be established once the order _",
    "n _ and degree @xmath9 are identified to better constrain the ledoux constant .",
    "most gravity modes appear as triplets , and their frequency differences are consistent with identifying them as @xmath9=1 modes .",
    "they also show nearly equal period spacings , which we interpret as asymptotic overtones of a single degree .",
    "multiplets indicate they are @xmath9=1 modes , but the period spacings are too large to be of consecutive overtones .",
    "they are more likely 207 or 310s which is dissimilar to the 250s observed for the other _",
    "kepler_-observed pulsating sdb stars @xcite .",
    "however , those other stars are all g - mode dominated and so are cooler than kic10139564 .",
    "the only other sdb star that is a p - mode dominated hybrid is bal09 .",
    "ground - based observations detected 20g - mode periodicities yet there is no indication of consistent period spacings between them .",
    "so at this time bal09 is the only pulsating sdb star with rich g - mode spectrum which does not show asymptotic g - mode period spacings .",
    "it is also both cooler and more evolved ( lower @xmath3 ) than kic10139564 and so may not be any more suitable for comparison than the other g - mode pulsators .",
    "theoretical works in progress ( by vvg ) are seeking to explain this discrepancy .",
    "several of the multiplets show signal excesses at the frequencies of likely missed components and are indicated in the figures with vertical dash - dotted lines .",
    "we included them in our list as the s / n=4 threshold is adopted to separate intrinsic peaks from random noise .",
    "when there is good reason to anticipate pulsation frequencies , in this case multiplet splitting , the significance threshold does not necessarily apply .",
    "we do not claim that any of these frequencies are intrinsic to the star , yet we include this speculation to compel future investigation with additional data .",
    "recent spectroscopic measurements indicate kic10139564 is not a radial velocity variable and allowed us to refine its temperature and gravity , placing it well away from the typical hybrid pulsator region ( see fig.2 of * ? ? ?",
    "this raises the possibility that low - amplitude , g - mode pulsations are common place in v361hya class stars , but an instrument with _",
    "kepler s _ accuracy is required to observe them .",
    "a re - examination of pulsation driving models would seem necessary as the most recent g - mode driving publications @xcite can not drive pulsations to the temperature of kic10139564 . improvements for diffusion of iron - group elements ( in progress by hh ) seems likely to solve this issue .    among the p - modes at high frequencies , we have noticed several regions to be unresolved in frequencies , and our first guess led us towards stochastic oscillations as a possible explanation .",
    "detailed analysis showed , however , that they are likely not stochastic in nature , but rather require multiple explanations .",
    "the regions all appear as multiplets and frequency splittings are consistent with our derived rotation period .",
    "two regions are caused by reflections across the nyquist frequency of combination frequencies , which are smeared by the difference in spacecraft and barycentric reference frames .",
    "others are caused by highly variable amplitudes , and some appear to be changing their frequencies slightly . in the combined data",
    "set , this leads to multiple - peaked or even transient periodicities with amplitudes that are greatly reduced .    as a result of the abundant multiplets",
    ", we were able to associate most frequencies with modes , which is a very rare result for sdbv stars .",
    "also of interest are the probable detections of @xmath9=3 or greater modes . in many other sdbv stars ,",
    "frequency density has strongly suggested that higher @xmath9 modes are excited @xcite , yet because of geometric cancellation , there has been some debate whether we would most likely observe @xmath9=3 or 4 modes .",
    "mode density in this star also creates a new problem because current models ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ) can not produce as many modes as are observed . from a sample of representative models , the overtone spacings for @xmath9=0 to 4 averaged from 904 to 939@xmath20hz .",
    "near the fundamental order , this could be reduced to about 700@xmath20hz . for the better - established sequences , we detect overtone separations of 237 , 124 , 176 , 241 and 234@xmath20hz .",
    "such a dense spectrum is clearly challenging for current models yet could go a long way to explain the high - density observed in several sdbv stars .",
    "kic10139564 seems well placed to solve these issues , and the many multiplets ( especially those of higher degree ) should provide constraints on the rotation axis as well .",
    "only one high - amplitude p - mode is detected to be a single peak .",
    "its amplitude is almost 4ppt .",
    "we used this peak to match amplitudes between months to reduce residual signal as much as possible .",
    "this helped to diminish residuals for most of the peaks , which could mean either the change of intrinsic amplitudes of those periodicities is consistent or they are stable and any difference in amplitude between quarters is caused by systematics .",
    "fifteen months of continuous data coverage opened a way to study phase stability of detected periodicities to search for possible companions to kic101039564 .",
    "although we have detected more than 50 periodicities , we could not use most of them for checking phase stability .",
    "close neighbouring peaks or residuals , which indicate amplitude / phase variation , cause a beating pattern in both amplitude and phase .",
    "we found only one well - suited frequency around 5472@xmath20hz , which we used to look for phase stability .",
    "it is still affected by some nearby low - amplitude , complex signals . however , the beating between the peak and that complex signal is about 10days , so the beat period is shorter than the period from rotational splitting . as a result of our phase analysis",
    ", we have not noticed any periodic variation in phase that could be interpreted as a companion to kic10139564 .",
    "there seems to be a real deviation in phase between day 420 and 520 , but we are not yet able to interpret this variation .",
    "the results we presented in this paper clearly show kic10139564 to be very interesting and allowed us to detect features not accessible from ground - based data .",
    "as most frequency regions contained multiplets , mode identifications could be determined for most of the peaks we detected .",
    "the identified modes should pose strong constraints on stellar models and should , obviously , allow the exclusion of non - unique solutions , making the theoretical study of this object easier .",
    "in fact , this is the only sdbv star with so many modes identified . as a natural implication of the pulsation variety and all the remarkable results we obtained from only 15months of data",
    ", we definitely should continue monitoring this star to confirm several features as well as to uncover more properties still hidden in the data .",
