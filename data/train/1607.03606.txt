    "stanley @xcite showed algebraically that the number of reduced words of @xmath4 is equal to the number of standard staircase young tableaux of shape @xmath5 . in @xcite , edelman and greene introduced the notion of balanced young tableaux , and showed that the number of balanced staircase young tableaux of shape @xmath5 is equal to the number of reduced words of @xmath4 .",
    "furthermore , they constructed a bijection between the set of standard young tableaux and the set of balanced young tableaux of any shape , which proved the result of stanley combinatorially .",
    "notice that the rothe diagram of a dominant permutation , i.e. , 132-avoiding , is a young diagram , see , for example , @xcite .",
    "it is natural to generalize the results of @xcite to the rothe tableaux of a permutation . in @xcite , fomin , greene , reiner and shimozono",
    "introduced the notion of balanced rothe tableaux of any permutation @xmath0 , and constructed a simple bijection between the set of reduced words of @xmath0 and the set of balanced rothe tableaux of @xmath0 .    in this paper , we introduce the notion of standard rothe tableaux of @xmath0 , which are tableaux obtained by labelling the cells of the rothe diagram of @xmath0 with consecutive integers @xmath6 such that each row and each column is increasing .",
    "the result of edelman and greene @xcite can be viewed as a bijection between standard rothe tableaux and balanced rothe tableaux for dominant permutations . for a general permutation @xmath0",
    ", we show that the number of standard rothe tableaux of @xmath0 is smaller than or equal to the number of balanced rothe tableaux of @xmath0 , with equality if and only if @xmath0 avoids the four patterns 2413 , 2431 , 3142 and 4132 .",
    "moreover , when the equality holds , we provide an explicit formula for such number of standard rothe tableaux .",
    "let @xmath7 denote the set of standard rothe tableaux of @xmath0 . if @xmath0 avoids the four patterns 2413 , 2431 , 3142 and 4132 , we show that each connected component of the rothe diagram of @xmath0 is a young diagram , and any two young diagrams are nonintersecting , i.e. , have no cells in the same row or column .",
    "thus @xmath8 can be expressed as the product of the numbers of some standard young tableaux . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath0 contains one of these four patterns , the main steps of our proof are to first establish an injection @xmath9 , called the lifting operation , from @xmath7 to @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is a dominant permutation . then by using the lifting operation @xmath9",
    ", we show that there is an injective but not surjective map from @xmath7 to the set of reduced words of @xmath0 .",

    "let @xmath16 be a permutation , @xmath0 can be expressed as a product of generators @xmath17 . when the number of generators needed is the smallest , such a word is called reduced , and this number is called the length of @xmath0 , denoted by @xmath18 .",

    "in this case , we also say that @xmath0 is a dominant permutation , or @xmath0 is 132-avoiding .",
    "we can define other pattern avoiding permutations similarly .",
    "recall that the rothe diagram @xmath23 of a permutation @xmath20 is a diagram characterization of the inversions of @xmath0 .",
    "consider an @xmath24 square grid , where we use @xmath25 to denote the cell in row @xmath14 and column @xmath26 .",
    "we put a dot in the cell @xmath27 for @xmath28 .",
    "then the rothe diagram @xmath23 is the collection of cells @xmath29 such that there is a dot to the right of @xmath29 and there is a dot below @xmath29 .",

    "a labelling of the cells of @xmath23 is called balanced , if for each hook @xmath32 , after rearranging the labels in @xmath32 increasingly from right to left and from top to bottom , the label of the cell @xmath25 remains unchanged .",
