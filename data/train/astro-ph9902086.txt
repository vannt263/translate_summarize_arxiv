    "in the last two years , new important sets of data have allowed for the first time to connect the epoch of formation of local fossil remnants with evidences from the remote universe :    * the global history of star formation is now beginning to be reconstructed , mainly thanks to data provided by the canada - france redshift survey ( lilly et al .",
    "1996 ) and the hubble deep field ( hdf : madau et al . 1996",
    "; madau , pozzetti & dickinson 1998 ) .",
    "although quite large uncertainties still exists , mainly related to the role of dust , these data robustly locate the bulk of cosmic star formation at @xmath13 ; for spheroidal systems , it is at @xmath14 ( franceschini et al .",
    "* two independent , broad impact surveys of moderately high redshift type ia sne ( schmidt et al .",

    "1998 ) coupled to constraints from cosmic microwave background ( garnavich et al . 1998 ; lasenby 1998 ) have yielded very precise values for @xmath15  and @xmath16 .",
    "note that these small error bars are obtained assuming a flat universe .",
    "if confirmed , this very exciting result will allow a much better definition of the universe geometry than possible insofar * the esa hipparcos satellite has provided new , much more accurate values for the trigonometric parallaxes of @xmath17  nearby stars , including a rather large number of cepheids , horizontal branch stars , and subdwarfs .",
    "this has allowed reliable estimates of distances and ages for the lmc and the globular clusters ( gc : feast & catchpole 1997 ; reid 1997 , 1998 ; gratton et al .",

    "2000 ) have allowed to clarify critical issues like the rle of reddening in distance derivations to this very important galaxy    the combined impact of these works is enormous , since first it allows to reconcile the ages of gcs with the present and past expansion rate of the universe , and second opens new perspectives on galactic evolution studies . in the present paper we re -",
    "examine the current status of knowledge about distances and ages for gcs and discuss their impact on the cosmic distance scale .",
    "finally , we sketch the present evidences about the epoch of formation of galactic gcs ( assumed to be tracers of the earliest epoch of star formation in our own galaxy ) , comparing it with the current knowledge about the cosmic star formation history .",
    "the status of the research on the absolute age of gcs , and its impact on the choice of a cosmological model for the universe , is summarized in figure  1 , adapted and updated from turner ( 1997 ) .",
    "as well known , the main problem in the derivation of ages for gcs is the unambiguous definition of a reliable distance scale for population ii stars ( renzini , 1991 ) , since a marked dichotomy exists insofar between a * long distance scale * and a * short distance scale * ( see vandenberg , bolte & stetson 1996 ) .",
    "indeed , once the distance is fixed , absolute ages for the gcs can be derived from the absolute magnitude of their turn off , @xmath18 , which is the evolutionary `` clock '' .",
    "depending on which distance scale is adopted , a rather striking impact follows on the cosmological framework .",
    "in fact , if the short distance scale is adopted , the hb luminosity would be @xmath19 at [ fe / h]@xmath20 , gc absolute ages would be @xmath21 gyr gyr ] , and a distance modulus of @xmath22 would be derived for the lmc .",
    "this value is 0.25 mag smaller than that adopted in extragalactic distance scales ( e.g. the hst key project on extragalactic cepheids ) , and implies a value for @xmath23 roughly in the range 6585  km  s@xmath24mpc@xmath24 ( this residual range being mainly due to ambiguities in the location of spiral galaxies within the virgo cluster : tammann 1998 ) . on the other side ,",
    "if the long distance scale is adopted , the hb luminosity would be @xmath25 at [ fe / h]@xmath26 , gc s ages would be @xmath27 gyr , and the distance modulus to the lmc would be @xmath28 , consistent with @xmath23  roughly in the range 5575  km  s@xmath24mpc@xmath24 .",
    "for this reason , figure  1 is divided in two panels . in panel _ a _ we compared the age of gc derived before data from the hipparcos mission became available ( bolte & hogan 1995 , chaboyer et al . 1996 ; vandenberg et al . 1996 ) , with the age of a ( flat ) universe provided by different values of h@xmath29 , for different values of @xmath30 , and within the range indicated by the recent type ia sne data ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "the shaded region is the permitted area , obtained adopting values of @xmath23  consistent with the distance moduli used to derive the ages for the gcs .",
    "while the rather large error bars indeed allow some region of overlap , strong constraints are required for the epoch of formation of the gcs .",
    "the advent of hipparcos parallaxes has allowed to greatly improve one of the most powerful ( but up to now uncertain due to the lack of a proper data base ) method to derive distances : the gc subdwarf fitting technique .",
    "it will be shown that once questions related to a correct handling of the data sample are properly addressed , this method favours the `` long distance scale '' , and the derivation of younger ages for gcs . as shown in panel _",
    "b _ of figure  1 , the derived ages are now comfortably smaller than the age of the universe .    while the distance scale provided by the subdwarf fitting method agrees with the most accurate and up - to - now robust distance indicator : the cepheids , it must be emphasized that , so far , other recent results did not easily fit into this reassuring and consistent picture . in fact , a number of distance scale determinations still support the short distance scale . for instance , hipparcos proper motions for the field rr lyraes have confirmed the results obtained by ground - based statistical parallaxes .",
    "however , in the following we will show that once reddenings for the rr lyraes in the lmc are assumed consistently with those used for the lmc cepheids , this dichotomy is solved .",
    "this result is new and will be discussed in some depth in the next section .",
    "globular clusters , as well as most of the population ii objects , are too far to allow a direct measure of their trigonometric parallaxes with the presently available instrumental tools .",
    "therefore , several _ indirect _ techniques have been devised , in order to measure their distances .",
    "some of them exploit the classical _ standard candles _ existing among pop .",
    "ii objects ( red giant branch - rgb - stars , horizontal branch - hb - stars , rr lyrae variables , main sequence - ms - subdwarfs , white dwarfs - wd ) , others follow alternative approaches . in this section , we will consider several of these distance indicators , both from population ii and ( for comparison ) from population i objects .",
    "we will postpone a thorough discussion of distances obtained via main sequence fitting to the next section . also , we will not consider distances derived from calibration of luminosities entirely based on models ( like e.g. stellar or pulsational models ) .",
    "while most of the results we find here agree with the model predictions , we prefer to keep results mainly based on observations clearly separated from results entirely based on model calculations . in this way ,",
    "first , the results will not critically dependent on the model assumptions , and , second , they may be used to test the model predictions ( see e.g. gratton , 1998c ; castellani , 1999 ) . on the other hand , ages for clusters can not be derived without reference to models : however , the adopted calibrator - the ms turn - off luminosity - is a very robust theoretical prediction .",
    "the various distance indicators will be discussed through the comparison of the values for the ( true ) distance modulus of the lmc , @xmath31 , they lead to . when considering distances to the lmc derived from population ii objects the following two issues should be reminded :    * distances to the lmc",
    "are finally founded on the rr lyrae variables .",
    "the absolute magnitude of rr lyrae is known to depend on metallicity , but there is no general agreement about the correct slope @xmath32[fe / h ] of the absolute magnitude - metallicity relation . in the following , we will assume a value of @xmath32[fe / h]=@xmath33 , which is supported by most theoretical models ( chieffi , straniero & limongi , 1998 , caloi , dantona & mazzitelli 1997 , cassisi et al .",
    "1997 , vandenberg , 1997 ) , and baade - wesselink absolute magnitudes ( fernley et al .",
    "1998b ) , and it is only slightly larger than derived from the gcs in m31 ( fusi pecci et al .",
    "1996 ) . both models and observations",
    "suggests that the relation is probably steeper at metallicity [ fe / h]@xmath34  ( however , this range is not relevant for the present discussion ) .",
    "anyway , the impact of this source of uncertainty ( @xmath35 mag / dex ) on our discussion is small .",
    "in fact , our choice was to refer our absolute magnitude estimates to a metallicity of [ fe / h]@xmath361.5 , that is a typical average value for most of the population ii distance indicators : for instance , the average for our nine globular clusters is [ fe / h]@xmath361.42 , that for hb stars with hipparcos parallaxes considered by gratton ( 1998b , see below ) is @xmath371.41 , and that for the rr lyrae used in the statistical parallaxes ranges from @xmath371.53 to @xmath371.61 , depending on the adopted sample .",
    "we argue that also rr lyrae in the bar of the lmc have on average a similar metallicity , albeit evidence is admittedly not as strong as desired .",
    "however , on the whole we think that uncertainties related to these transformations are _ on average _ @xmath38 0.02 mag , and can not explain significant parts of the discrepancy between the short and long distance scale , while of course they may be important for individual clusters at the extremes of the metallicity range like m92 or 47 tuc ( in these cases , uncertainties in the distances may be as large as @xmath39 mag , corresponding to @xmath40 gyr ) * clementini et al .",
    "1999 have recently derived an average magnitude of @xmath41  for 75 rr lyraes in two fields of the bar of the lmc .",
    "they compare this value , which is assumed to correspond to an average metal abundance [ fe / h]=@xmath371.5 dex ( from the @xmath42s analysis of a sample of double - mode pulsators in the lmc ) , with walker ( 1992 ) average dereddened magnitude of the cluster rr lyraes : @xmath43  mag ( at an average metallicity of [ fe / h]@xmath44  and for an average reddening e(b@xmath37v ) @xmath450.09 mag ) . on the assumption of a reddening value e(b@xmath37v)=0.10 mag for the lmc bar ( bessel , 1991 )",
    "they conclude that ( i ) the two @xmath46 estimates are in very good agreement once the 0.4 dex difference in metal abundance is accounted for ( with a slope of 0.18 for the metallicity - luminosity relation for hb stars ) , and that ( ii ) no evindence is found for a difference in luminosity between field and cluster rr lyraes in the lmc . when combined with the faint absolute magnitudes given by e.g. statistical parallaxes , these @xmath46 values for the rr lyrae s in lmc produce the so called _ short distance scale_. + in a separate paper , ( clementini et al .",
    "2000 , in preparation ) , we present a detailed description of this new lmc rr lyrae data set and discuss several determinations of reddening towards the bar of the lmc . the ( average ) value consistent with the analysis of the cepheids ( caldwell & coulson 1985 , laney & stobie 1993 , gieren , fouqu & gomez 1998 ) is @xmath47 ; while a slightly larger value of @xmath48  would give colors of the edges of the instability strip consistent with those found for the lmc gcs ( walker 1992 ) . finally , an even larger value : @xmath49  is given by the reddening maps of schlegel , finkbeiner & davis ( 1998 ) , oestreicher , gochermann & schmidt - kaler ( 1995 ) and oestreicher & schmidt - kaler ( 1996 ) .",
    "this range in the reddening value obtained for the same locations within the lmc is large , and may explain most of the scatter in the recent determinations of the distance modulus of the lmc .",
    "in fact , the reddening value used by walker ( 1992 ) , as well as bessel s ( 1991 ) , are on average @xmath450.02 - 0.03 mag larger than values consistent with the cepheids analysis . once corrected for this effect ,",
    "gc rr lyraes are on average @xmath50  mag brighter than the field rr lyraes , a difference entirely due to a single cluster ( ngc 1841 ) , that is likely to be @xmath51  mag closer tu us than the lmc ( walker 1992 ) . + hereinafter , we will adopt the reddening scale given by cepheids ( 0.07 mag ) which is also supported by a comparison of the colors of the edges of the instability strip for the field lmc rr lyraes with those defined by variables in the globular cluster m3 ( clementini et al .",

    "large , corrections must be applied to transform these smaller parallaxes into distance moduli that are very similar to the older values obtained from larger parallaxes      since the whole hipparcos catalogue is now a public resource , it is possible to exploit its entire database in order to improve the subdwarf fitting analysis .",
    "two different routes may be followed : i ) to use an _ a priori _ sample where stars are selected according to criteria not based on hipparcos parallaxes ( as in r97 , r98 and paper i ) , ii ) to use an _ a posteriori _",
    "sample extracted from the whole hipparcos color magnitude diagram ( as in c98 , and , in part , in pmtv ) .",
    "the main difference between these two approaches is the number and relevance of the statistical biases associated to intervening selection effects .",
    "in fact , while in a _ a priori _ selected sample , selection criteria ( and corresponding biases ) are known as they are defined by the investigators themselves , any _ a posteriori _ selected hipparcos sample is hampered by the poor knowledge of the selection criteria originally applied to form the hipparcos catalogue itself , and by the increasing incompleteness of the catalogue towards faint magnitudes ( @xmath119 ) .",
    "in particular , the metallicity of an _ a posteriori _ selected sample of subdwarfs , as well as the rate and distribution of secondary components of the contaminating binaries , are rather poorly defined , thus rendering very uncertain the correction of the corresponding systematic effects .    in the following sections , we discuss these two approaches in details . according to the procedure outlined in paper i",
    ", preference is given to the _ a priori _ sample approach , while the _ a posteriori _ sample is used to show how uncertainties , or different assumption about reddening , metallicity scale and binary corrections , can affect the analysis , and to test the completeness achieved by the _ a priori _ selected sample .",

    "thus , as far as the metal - poor dwarfs are concerned , the hipparcos catalogue seems to be almost complete , or at least adequately representative , down to @xmath126 .",
    "the introduction of a selection criterion based on the parallax accuracy changes dramatically the situation , because the median errors of hipparcos parallaxes increase with apparent magnitude ( they are less than 1 mas for @xmath127 , around 1.3 mas @xmath128 , and @xmath129 mas for @xmath130 ) . if , following paper i , we cut the sample to stars with @xmath118 ,  does not provide additional useful informations ] we are left with only 56 objects , all brighter than @xmath131 .",

    "this _ a posteriori _ approach is similar to the procedure used by pmtv to form their second sub - sample of 216 stars , and to the procedure followed by c98 . from the available database we first extracted all stars with positive parallax and @xmath118 in the magnitude range @xmath147  mag ( 4342 stars ; this magnitude range should include mainly unevolved ms stars ) .",
    "metal - poor candidates were then identified by inferring the metallicity from the b@xmath37v color given in the catalogue .    by shifting the location of an unevolved star in the color - magnitude diagram parallel to the main sequence ( see section 3 of paper i ) , it is possible to derive its @xmath146  at an absolute magnitude of @xmath148 , @xmath149 . in the range of interest , this color is predicted by theoretical models to be an approximately quadratic function of metallicity , decreasing the metal abundance giving bluer mss ( see equation 4 in paper i ) .",
    "this relation was used to extract the _ metal - poor _ subdwarf candidates from the whole _ a posteriori _ selected unevolved stars with @xmath118 .",
    "we found that the number of metal - poor stars below the ms is very small : there are only 52 stars ( 1.2@xmath0 ) with ( b@xmath37v)@xmath150 ( i.e. [ fe / h]@xmath151 ) and @xmath145",
    ". we caution , however , that metallicities deduced from colors may be overestimated ( and , correspondingly , the number of metal - poor stars underestimated ) since stars can be made redder by the interstellar reddening or by the presence of binary companions .",
    "these effects are balanced only in part by the lutz - kelker bias ( stars that for erroneous measurements are below their true position have higher probability of being selected thus making the derived sequence bluer ) .",
    "the problem is further complicated since the metallicity distribution of the stars in the solar neighbourhood is strongly skewed toward solar values . as a consequence , symmetrically distributed random color errors shift more stars in the lower metallicity bin than in the high metallicity one .",
    "an additional complication is the non - gaussian distribution of errors in the color data sets ; e.g. in the tycho catalogue there is a small but not negligible number of stars ( @xmath40% ) with color errors that may be as large as several tenths of a magnitude . given these large errors , solar metallicity stars may be sometime erroneously interpreted as extremely metal - poor objects .",
    "the fraction of stars with large random color errors [ @xmath152 mag ] in the tycho catalogue is comparable to ( actually larger than ) the fraction of metal - poor stars ( with [ fe / h]@xmath151 ) in the hipparcos catalogue . a large contamination of spurious objects",
    "is then expected for the bluest bins in @xmath149 .",
    "this _ metallicity bias _ has a large impact on the _ a posteriori _ sample , where metallicities are derived from colors , while does not affect stars in the _ a priori _ sample , whose metallicities are known independently of colors .",
    "this is an important difference and a reason to definitely prefer the _ a priori _ approach .      _ a priori _ and _ a posteriori _ samples are both affected by a number of biases that must be taken into account in order to derive statistically corrected distances ( and ages ) of gcs .",
    "they are briefly discussed below .",
    "lutz - kelker effect and malmquist bias _",
    "+ average luminosities for sample of stars selected according to their absolute magnitudes ( i.e. parallaxes ) are affected by the lutz - kelker ( 1973 ) effect .",
    "this bias arises from the combination of measurement errors in the parallaxes ( which are symmetric ) and the strongly skewed distribution of true parallaxes .",
    "the net effect is a trend to include , and with more weight , stars with parallaxes measured too high , rather than stars with parallaxes measured too low .",
    "if not corrected , this bias leads to underestimate the average distance of the sample .",
    "furthermore , due to classical malmquist bias , the sample will likely contain more stars whose magnitudes are erroneously measured too bright vs stars with magnitude measured too faint .",
    "the corresponding average magnitude will thus be systematically overestimated .",
    "given the small range in m@xmath153 of the subdwarf sample , this effect is small in g97 , c98 , and the present paper , while should be accounted for in r97 , 98 and pmtv who used also turn - off stars in their fittings .",
    "the lutz - kelker bias affects both the _ a priori _ and the _ a posteriori _ samples .",
    "_ 2 . interstellar reddening _",
    "+ the interstellar reddening absorbs light coming from a star , thus weakening its magnitude , and reddens its color , thus simulating a higher metallicity for the stars in the _ a posteriori _ sample .",
    "although we have restricted the samples to stars with very accurate parallaxes ( i.e. generally nearby objects ) , significant reddening corrections may still be required in a few cases .",
    "_ 3 . contamination by binaries _",
    "+ a binary ms companion may brighten and redden the intrinsic @xmath149 color of the star under consideration , the amount of reddening actually depending on the magnitude difference between the two components .",
    "if the unresolved binary system is formed by stars with similar masses ( and then luminosity ) , the primary component brightness can be spuriously enhanced of up to 0.75 mag ( corresponding to the case of strictly equal masses ) .",
    "in turn , such star will more likely be included in the sample due to malmquist bias .",
    "_ 4 . metallicity bias _ +",
    "as described in section 4.2 this bias arises from the metallicity distribution of the stars in the hipparcos catalogue .",
    "this bias requires large corrections ; however it only affects the _ a posteriori _ selected",

    "the validity of the adopted interpolating relation between metallicity and ms color was checked using stars much more metal - rich than this limit ] .    in order to properly take into account and correct for all the above biases , one should in principle have an exact knowledge of ( i ) spatial and metallicity distributions of the calibrating stars , ( ii ) distribution of measuring errors , ( iii ) distribution in mass of the secondary components in binary systems etc . since all these quantities",
    "are generally poorly known , the safest approach is to restrict the analysis to ( a ) only stars with very accurate parallaxes ; ( b ) very low reddenings ; ( c ) discard binaries ; and ( d ) use the _ a priori _ sample approach since this sample is not affected by the _ metallicity bias_.    the _ a posteriori _ sample may however be used to check the completeness achieved by the _ a priori _ sample .",
    "there are 54 candidate metal - poor ( i.e. @xmath155 , corresponding to [ fe / h]@xmath156 using eq . 4 in paper i ) , unevolved ( @xmath135 ) stars with good parallaxes ( i.e. @xmath145 ) , in the _ a posteriori _ sample . 22 of these stars have large errors associated with their @xmath157 colors ( @xmath152 mag ) and should be discarded .",
    "most of these objects are known visual binaries not separated by the hipparcos beam ; colors for these stars can not be trusted .",
    "if we eliminate all stars with such large color errors , we are left with 32 stars .",
    "reliable metal abundances exist in the literature for 26 of them ( but only 11 are from high dispersion spectroscopy ) .",
    "according to these determinations 6 of these stars have metallicity [ fe / h]@xmath138 , thus falling outside the range defining the metal - poor stars .",
    "it is also interesting to note that while all the 9 objects having [ fe / h]@xmath140 are included in the _ a priori _ sample ; @xmath158 , 9 stars of the _ a priori _ sample with metallicity [ fe / h]@xmath156 ( from high resolution spectroscopy ) are @xmath159 included in the _ a posteriori _ sample , since their too red measured colors lead to derive metal abundances [ fe / h]@xmath160    in summary , the _ a posteriori _ sample contains only 6 new good candidate metal - poor stars ( i.e. with [ fe / h]@xmath156 ) ; 3 of them have @xmath161 ( corresponding to [ fe / h]@xmath162 ) and only one star has a color appropriate for [ fe / h]@xmath140 .",
    "noteworthy , even in this sample there is no star with [ fe / h]@xmath163 .    according to these numbers , in the _ a priori _ sample there are 20 stars with @xmath164 and [ fe / h]@xmath156 over a total number of good candidates found in the _ a posteriori _ sample ranging from 20 to 26 ( adding the 6 new good candidates ) .",
    "we can then estimate that the _ a priori _ sample is from 77 to 100% complete , the exact percentage depending on the fraction of the metal - poor candidates that actually are metal - poor stars .",
    "taking into account the strong asymmetry in the metallicity distribution of the stars in the solar neighborhood , we estimate that the _ a priori _ sample is @xmath165% complete .",
    "we conclude that the _ a priori _ approach yields a quite complete sample .",
    "furthermore , the cleaner definition of the intervening biases and corresponding corrections , makes it more reliable than the _ a posteriori _ based analysis , where the noticeable contamination of the sample forces the application of large and uncertain corrections . in the following section ,",
    "we describe the use of the extended list of unevolved stars with accurate parallaxes and reliable abundance determinations in the _ a priori _ sample , as fiducial calibrators to derive new distances for the 9 clusters studied in paper i. the comparison with specific points of other studies will be also discussed , where needed .",
    "basic data for the new calibrating subdwarfs are described in section 4.1 and shown in table  [ t : tab2 ] . since stars used in the analysis come from a larger original population ( all stars with [ fe / h]@xmath151 , @xmath166 , and with parallax measured by hipparcos with accuracy @xmath118 ) , and since a weight proportional to @xmath167 is associated to individual values , it is necessary to apply lutz - kelker corrections .",
    "these must be derived from the properties of the original sample .      following the procedure by hanson ( 1979 )",
    ", we used the proper motions in the hipparcos catalogue to derive lutz - kelker corrections of the parallaxes ( i.e. absolute magnitudes ) of our calibrators .",
    "the proper motion distribution of the stars in the _ a priori _ sample is shown in figure  2 .",
    "this follows very well a power law described by the relation @xmath168 , where @xmath169 is related to the corresponding parallax distribution ( @xmath170 ) . for values of @xmath171  arcsec / yr ( see figure  2 ) , @xmath172 . since about the 80@xmath0 of the original sample ( i.e. the 246 stars from which the _ a priori _ sample was drawn )",
    "is included in this limit of @xmath173 and since stars with @xmath118 form only @xmath174% of this original sample , it seems appropriate to assume that parallaxes around this threshold are distributed as @xmath175 .",
    "this exponent of the parallax distribution is very close to the value ( @xmath176 ) expected for a uniform distribution .",
    "this implies that the adopted magnitude cut ( @xmath177 ) is not too much severe ( for a comparison , r97 finds @xmath178 ) .",
    "according to this value of _ n _ , the absolute magnitudes of our calibrators were corrected using the relation : @xmath179 we note anyway that given the severe limit in the parallax error , the lutz - kelker corrections for our sample are however rather small , the maximum value being @xmath180  mag ( the average being 0.02  mag ) .      among the 56 stars in the _ a priori _ sample having good parallax ( @xmath145 ) , 19 ( i.e. @xmath181% ) are known or suspected binaries . this binary fraction is smaller than in paper i ( @xmath182% : 16 out of 34 stars ) , but we believe this is simply due to the lack of accurate observations for most of the additional stars in this more extended sample .",
    "therefore , a larger fraction of unknown binaries is expected to contaminate the candidate _",
    "bona fide _ single stars of the present sample .",
    "we have compared the residual distribution with respect to the @xmath109[fe / h ] relationship ( eq .",
    "4 of paper i ) of both known binaries and _ bona fide _ single stars ( in the range @xmath135 ) in the extended sample , in order to estimate the systematic correction required to properly take into account the binary contamination .",
    "according to the procedure devised in paper i ( see section 5.1 of that paper ) , we write this correction as the product of the probability of a star to be a binary and of the average correction for each binary . using the present sample",
    ", we derived a probability of @xmath183 for _ bona fide _ single stars to actually be binaries ( as expected , this figure is larger than found in paper i ) , and an average correction ( derived from the average offset of the known binaries with respect to the @xmath109[fe / h ] relation ) of @xmath184  mag .",
    "therefore , the appropriate binary correction to apply to _ bona fide _ single stars in the present _ a priori _ sample is @xmath185  mag .    although a larger number of binaries are expected in the field than among cluster stars , where wide , primordial binaries are likely to be destroyed by interactions with other cluster stars , some contamination by undetected binaries may still affect the ms loci of the clusters in our sample .",
    "moreover , blending of stars in the crowded field of gcs may mimic the physical binarity .",
    "a search for binaries in the outer regions of some gcs has led to a binary occurrence of @xmath186% ( pryor et al .",

    "the use of modal instead of mean values to identify the ms mean loci of gcs ( e.g. sandquist et al . 1996 ) may help reducing this effect . however , we used a monte carlo simulation and estimate that a residual `` reddening '' of about @xmath187  mag ( with an uncertainty of about 50% ) might be present in the c - m diagrams used in our analysis . in turn",
    ", distance moduli could be corrected by @xmath188  mag , in the sense to increase distances .",
    "however , given its large uncertainty we did not apply this correction .",
    "the goodness of the @xmath109[fe / h ] derived in paper i ( equation 4 ) was checked using the enlarged sample of subdwarfs of the present _ a priori _ sample .",
    "only stars with @xmath135 mag were used to perform this test ( 30 out of 56 objects in the sample ) .",
    "results are illustrated in figure  3 , where filled symbols indicate _ bona fide _ single stars and open symbols are used for known or suspected binaries .",
    "plotted over the data are the theoretical relations of straniero & chieffi ( 1991 ) rather than [ fe / h ] , in order to include the 0.3 dex enhancement due to the @xmath189elements , since this was not taken explicitly into account in these models ] .    on average , the _ bona fide _ single stars are @xmath190 mag ( @xmath191 mag ) redder than the adopted relation with no clear trend with metallicity .",
    "this small ( not very significant ) difference could be due to undetected binaries which contaminate the sample .",
    "we explicitly note that the observed @xmath109[fe / h ] relation must be extrapolated , when considering the most metal - poor clusters ( e.g. m92 ) , since there are no unevolved stars with good parallax and [ fe / h]@xmath163 , in the _ a priori _ sample .",
    "this is not an intrinsic limit of our sample though , since the comparison with the _ a posteriori _ sample assures that the lack of subdwarfs with very good parallaxes and metallicities lower than @xmath1922 dex is indeed an intrinsic limitation of the hipparcos catalogue .",
    "the new dataset of field subdwarfs selected _ a priori _ was used to re - derive distances and ages for the 9 gcs already studied in paper i. the same data for the clusters ( photometry , reddening , etc . ) , and the same general criteria and procedures defined in paper i were adopted in the present analysis , with two main differences : i ) we used all the stars with @xmath135 mag ; cd@xmath193 and hd121004 were discarded though , since they yield very discrepant results ( in opposite directions ; we suspect colors or metal abundances for these two stars to be wrong ) , and ii ) we considered only stars whose metal abundances were within 0.5 dex from that of the analyzed cluster .",

    "figure  4 shows the best fittings of the cluster mean loci to the fiducial sequences defined by the local calibrators .",

    "this set of model isochrones uses a value of @xmath194 mag , as recommended by hayes ( 1985 ) , and provides ages which fall in the middle of those obtained using other isochrone sets",
    ". indeed , almost any of the most recent models result into very similar ages , once , as discussed in paper i , the same luminosity - to - magnitude transformation is used .",
    "the new determinations compare very well with the results of paper i. on average , the new distance moduli are 0.04 mag shorter , and the corresponding ages 0.5 gyr larger , than in paper i. in turn , there is again overall agreement between the present paper , r98 and c98 . in this respect , thanks to r98 adoption of gcc metallicity scale , the difference in the distance moduli is decreased from @xmath195 mag , @xmath196 mag ( 6 clusters ) of [ paper i @xmath37 r97 ] , to @xmath197 mag , @xmath198 mag ( 5 clusters ) of [ the present paper @xmath37 r98 ] .",
    "the gc m92 deserves a deeper discussion since it is often considered the prototype of an old gc , and because its distance modulus , as derived by independent ms fitting analyses , spans a range of about 0.30 mag ( table  [ t : tab1 ] ) .",
    "the distance modulus we derive here for m92 , without binary correction [ @xmath199 mag ] , is identical to the value obtained by pmtv , again without binary correction .",
    "however this coincidence is totally fortuitous since ( i ) a different ( lower ) metallicity , ( ii ) a different ( higher ) reddening , and ( iii ) a much larger binary correction is assumed by pmtv for the subdwarf calibrators used to fit the m92 ms .",
    "indeed , a number of arguments makes the application of the subdwarf fitting technique to m92 difficult and , the corresponding estimated distance and age uncertain :    \\a ) the zero - point of m92 photometry is still uncertain .",
    "there is a 0.03 mag difference in the color of the m92 ms , between the photometries of heasley & christian ( 1986 ) and stetson & harris ( 1988 ) , the latter being bluer ( thus yielding a longer modulus and a younger age ) .",
    "while stetson & harris photometry seems very reliable , a small zero - point error of @xmath200 mag may still be present in the colors ( stetson & harris 1988 ) . a similar error may be present in the reddening estimate .",
    "the effect of errors in metal abundances may also be as large as @xmath201 dex , implying an uncertainty of @xmath202 dex in the distance .",
    "combining these facts , the internal uncertainty on the age for this single cluster amounts to about 2 - 2.5 gyr , that is equal to the difference between the age we derive for m92 ( 14.8 gyr ) and the average value for all  old \" clusters ( 12.3 gyr ) .",
    "\\b ) according to gcc and cg there are no subdwarfs with metallicity comparable to m92 ( i.e. [ fe / h]@xmath163 ) and with reliable parallax in the hipparcos catalogue . as mentioned above , this is an intrinsic limitation of the catalogue itself , and not of our sample .",
    "indeed , r98 did not re - examine m92 and the other most metal - poor clusters , since hipparcos measured only two very metal - poor subdwarf candidates .",
    "the claimed presence of stars with good hipparcos parallaxes , unevolved and with [ fe / h]@xmath163 , in pmtv and r97 , is simply due to their adoption of carney et al .",
    "( 1994 ) metal abundances for the field subdwarfs . however , as found by cgcs , carney et al .",
    "abundances are too low ( by about 0.36 dex ) for the most metal - poor stars .",
    "pmtv distance to m92 is similar to that derived in the present paper only because they use larger reddenings for the field subdwarfs ( from arenou , grenon & gomez 1992 ) , and this fortuitously offsets the difference due to metallicity .    in view of all the uncertainties still involved in the m92 analysis , the distance to this cluster",
    "has a large error bar , and care should be exerted before drawing any conclusion on the age of the _ oldest _ gcs from the analysis of just m92 .",
    "due to the strong sensitivity of the subdwarf fitting method to metal abundance ( @xmath203<1 $ ] , the exact figure depending on [ fe / h ] , see paper i for a detailed discussion of this point ) the use of a strictly homogenous metallicity scale for cluster and field stars may still be not enough to assure derivation of correct cluster distances and ages . indeed ,",
    "although we have used gcc / cg metallicity scale for all stars involved in the fittings , systematic errors may still be present because :    \\1 ) cluster abundances are usually derived from giants while field calibrators are dwarfs .",
    "our abundances are derived using model atmospheres extracted from kurucz ( 1993 ) grid .",
    "however , these models may better reproduce real atmospheres of dwarfs than of giants ( see gratton , 1998a , and cgcs99 ) .",
    "thus , residual systematic differences could possibly exist between abundances derived for these two types of stars .",
    "we estimate that these differences may be as large as 0.1 dex .",

    "carney et al . ( 1997 ) derived [ mg / fe]=@xmath206 for bd@xmath207 ( [ fe / h]=@xmath208 ) , and king ( 1997 ) found [ mg / fe]=@xmath209 for the common proper motion pair hd134439/134440 ( [ fe / h]=@xmath210 ) . since distance determinations depend on the [ @xmath107/fe ] ratio ( being @xmath211<0.7 $ ] , from straniero & chieffi 1991 ) , the problem is to establish how large is the fraction of @xmath189underabundant , metal - poor stars .",
    "the underabundance in field stars could possibly be correlated with kinematics , as suggested by the large apogalactic distance of hd134439/134440 .",

    "we found that only a small minority of the metal - poor stars have @xmath189underabundance , with no clear correlation with kinematics .",

    "changes are very small : on average , distance moduli are decreased by @xmath212  mag , with no corrections larger than 0.02  mag .",
    "such changes will be neglected hereinafter .",
    "the applicability of the subdwarf fitting technique rests on the assumption that the metal - poor field subdwarfs in the solar neighborhood are the local counterpart of the gc ms stars . since",
    "a direct measure of the trigonometrical parallax of gc stars is not in the reach of present day instrumental capabilities [ but will became feasible with the accomplishment of the gaia ( lindgren & perryman , 1996 ) mission ] we must rely on this assumption .",

    "presently , the largest sources of uncertainty reside with ( i ) colors and photometric calibrations , ( ii ) reddening , and ( iii ) metal abundances and metallicity scale , for both the subdwarf calibrators and the gc ms stars .",
    "due to the steepness of the ms , small errors in the photometry may cause large errors in the derived distance moduli .",
    "furthermore , at present , the only color suited for the subdwarf fitting is the @xmath146 , since reliable @xmath214  and @xmath215colors are lacking for many of the field subdwarfs ( see cgcs99 ) and near - infrared deep color magnitude diagrams are not available for most clusters .    to avoid systematic effects , field calibrators and cluster stars should be observed with the same instrumental configuration and in the same photometric system .",
    "however , given the large difference in luminosity between the two samples ( about 10 mag ) this is not feasible .",
    "photomultipliers and filters for the johnson - cousins system are generally used for the field calibrators , while ccd s are used for the gcs .",
    "magnitudes for the latter are then transformed to johnson - cousins by observation of landolt s standards ( landolt 1983 , 1992 ) .",

    "we estimate a total photometric uncertainty of @xmath45 0.04 mag ( distance modulus ) as the average over the 9 clusters considered here .    a consistent reddening scale should be used for cluster and dwarf stars . up to now",
    ", a direct comparison of the excitation temperatures of field subdwarfs and gc ms stars has not been feasible ( important progresses are expected from uves at vlt2 ) ; however some constraints can be derived by comparing the reddenings adopted for gcs and template subdwarfs with a cosecant law .",

    "while the former value is in the middle of current determinations of the galactic dust scale - height ( 50 - 150 pc : lynga 1982 , pandey & mahra 1987 , scheffler & elssser 1987 , spitzer 1978 , salomon et al .",

    "finally , differences in the adopted metallicities of subdwarfs and clusters stars may still be present even if a homogeneous metallicity scale was adopted , since abundance for clusters are derived from giants instead of ms stars . for this reason systematic differences ( of @xmath450.1 dex ) may exist between the metallicity of the template subdwarfs and the gc stars .",

    "once the same reddening scales are adopted for cepheids and rr lyrae , the short and long distance scale agree within their nominal error bar . * the only result which is clearly discrepant at present is that from the eclipsing binary hv2274 by guinan et al . ; if we accept its internal error as a realistic estimate of the true error bar , this result is more than 3  @xmath231 from the average of all other determinations .",
    "this might indicate that some problem still exists on the distance to the lmc ; however , we ( aribratirily ) prefer to wait more data on eclipsing binaries in the lmc before assigning weight to this method .",
    "if the distance to hv2274 is neglected , the ( weighted average ) distance modulus of the lmc is : @xmath232 where the first error bar is simply the 1  @xmath231  error bar due to scatter in the individual determinations , while the second one derives from an ( arbitrarily ) assumed uncertainty of @xmath233  mag in the reddening scale .",
    "the main implications of this result are :    1 .",
    "the cosmic distance scale is @xmath234% longer than previously assumed , and the value of the hubble constant correspondingly smaller .",
    "the change with respect to the value usually assumed in extragalactic studies is small and may be reasonably neglected for most purposes .",
    "2 .   the @xmath222[fe / h ] relations implied by this distance scale are : @xmath219}+1.5 ) + ( 0.54\\pm 0.07)\\ ] ] @xmath220}+1.5 ) + ( 0.63\\pm 0.07)\\ ] ] @xmath221}+1.5 ) + ( 0.57\\pm 0.07)\\ ] ] 3 .",
    "the ages of the gcs derived assuming this distance scale ( which is 1  @xmath231  shorter than given by the subdwarf fitting method ) are 1.4 gyr older than found in section 5 , well within the quoted error bar .",
    "the average age of the gc would then be : @xmath235 ( 95% confidence range ) .",
    "the milky way provides basic data to study the cosmic evolution of galaxies .",
    "however , up to a few years ago , the discrepancy existing between the age estimated for the galactic gcs and for the present and past expansion rate of the universe hampered the use of this template .",
    "in particular , it was impossible to compare the epoch of formation of our own galaxy with evidences from high redshift objects .    while large uncertainties still exist , the situation has now changed thanks to ( i ) the very recent results about the universe de - acceleration parameters obtained by type ia sne studies ( schmidt et al .",
    "1998 ; pearlmutter et al .",
    "1998 ; garnavich et al .",
    "1998 ) , and to ( ii ) the revised estimates of the age of the ( old ) galactic gcs now possible thanks to hipparcos . in figure  6 , we have plotted the redshift of the formation of gcs against various possible values for the hubble constant .",
    "the three panels show the results obtained for three different values of @xmath236  ( 0.2 , 0.3 , and 0.4 ) , within a flat universe ( @xmath237 ) .",
    "the solid line shows the favourite age of gcs according to the present paper ( 12.9  gyr ) , and the dashed lines represent the limits of our 95% level of confidence .",
    "while the admitted area is still large , it is possible to locate at quite high confidence the epoch of formation of galactic gcs ( that we identify with the first major episode of star formation in our galaxy , corresponding to the bulk of the halo , the thick disk , and perhaps the bulge ) at @xmath238   the preferred value being at @xmath12 .",
    "this value for the epoch of formation of gcs compares well with evidences from high redshift galaxies , as given by analysis of the hdf , which locates the bulk of cosmic star formation at @xmath239  ( madau et al .",
    "an older star formation ( at @xmath240 ) was obtained by franceschini et al .",
    "( 1998 ) for elliptical galaxies in the hdf ( assuming @xmath241 , roughly corresponding to @xmath10 ) .",
    "this comparison is perhaps more relevant here , since our age estimate does not include the thin disk of the milky way , whose formation likely occurred later ( see e.g. discussion in gratton et al .",
    "the literature of the last year has seen the flourishing of a number of new techniques to measure distances as well as a re - newed interest in the classical methods which have been revised in light of hipparcos data ( see section 3 ) .",
    "a lively debate is taking place among authors who favour one method to the other and , in turn , one distance scale to the other . by significantly increasing the number of local subdwarfs with accurate parallaxes",
    ", hipparcos has allowed to definitely improve the subdwarf ms fitting technique .",
    "work still remains to be done , though .",
    "in fact , while waiting for the benefits of the next generation astrometric missions ( gaia , sim see http://sim.jpl.nasa.gov/sim/ ) , all the efforts should be devoted to cutting down the 0.12 mag residual uncertainty still affecting the msf distances to gcs .",
    "new , deep , and precisely absolute - calibrated photometric data should be collected for gcs ( m92 in particular ) , reddening determinations should be improved , and abundance analysis of cluster ms stars should be performed .    based on our detailed analysis , the ms fitting method favours the _ long _ distance scale and provides a distance modulus for the lmc of : @xmath242 $ ] , ( based on @xmath52  for the rr lyraes in the bar of the lmc ) , and an average age for the 9 analyzed clusters of @xmath243 .",
    "our subdwarf fitting modulus for the lmc is 1 @xmath231 larger than provided by other techniques .",
    "however , whithin their error bars all methods lead to the same distance to the lmc once the same reddening scale is adopted for cepheid and rr lyrae variables .",

    "<S> emphasis is given in the paper to the discussion of distances and ages of gcs derived using hipparcos parallaxes of local subdwarfs . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the selection criteria adopted to choose the local subdwarfs , as well as the size of the corrections applied to existing systematic biases , are the main culprit for the differences found among the various independent studies that first used hipparcos parallaxes and the subdwarf fitting technique . </S>",
    "<S> we also caution that the absolute age of m92 ( usually considered one of the oldest clusters ) still remains uncertain due to the lack of subdwarfs of comparable metallicity with accurate parallaxes .    </S>",
    "<S> distances and ages for the 9 clusters discussed in paper i are re - derived using an enlarged sample of local subdwarfs , which includes about 90@xmath0 of the metal - poor dwarfs with accurate parallaxes ( @xmath1 ) in the whole hipparcos catalogue . on average , </S>",
