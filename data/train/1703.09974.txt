    "understanding atomistic phenomena at contacting surfaces is fundamental to the improvement of many modern applications , ranging from experimental methods like atomic or friction force microscopy ( afm / ffm )  @xcite or nanoindentation  @xcite to nanotechnologies employed , for example , in nano-/microelectromechanical - systems ( nems / mems )  @xcite .",
    "particularly , the lifetime , performance , and reliability of such systems depend sensitively on the interfacial processes between contacting materials .",
    "furthermore , detailed studies of such interfaces allow for gaining valuable insights necessary for the description of tribological processes , like nanoscale wear  @xcite , which is not yet understood comprehensively because of its highly complex nature  @xcite .",
    "interfaces between metals and counterparts like ceramics  @xcite or diamond  @xcite are of high technological as well as fundamental interest because they possess benefits of both types of the involved material classes , such as high thermal stability , degradation resistance , and interesting mechanical properties  @xcite .",
    "such interfaces are used for various applications ranging from protective coatings to communication devices and nanoelectronics  @xcite . in this paper ,",
    "two distinct material pairings are investigated , namely the metal - ceramic al / tin interface and the metal - insulator cu / diamond ( c@xmath0 ) interface .",
    "these interfaces are conceived as contacts between hard and soft materials .    in reality , however , surfaces are usually not pristine .",
    "for example , when aluminum is exposed to air a thin oxide film is formed at the al surface .",
    "this passivation prevents further oxidation and results in an excellent corrosion resistance of the material  @xcite .",
    "the typical thickness of such a film is up to . as an initial step towards such exceedingly complex interfaces , the effect of a monolayer of oxygen and hydrogen covering al and c@xmath0 surfaces ,",
    "respectively , will be discussed in this work .",
    "beginning in the 1980s , classical molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations have become a commonly applied tool to investigate nanotribological phenomena and they are a part of the standard computational methods in this field nowadays , see , e.g. , refs .  . during the last decade ,",
    "additionally , the use of density functional theory ( dft ) calculations has been introduced in nanotribology , see , e.g. , refs .  , and should be seen as an extension to the more common computational tools in tribology .",
    "advantages of dft include that it is independent of empirical potentials , i.e. , dft allows for parameter - free calculations via an accurate quantum - mechanical description of systems . on the other hand , dft calculations",
    "are currently limited to relatively small systems of typically a few hundred atoms because of computational challenges .",
    "since dft calculations yield very reliable results for the investigated class of systems  @xcite , this method is employed here to analyze the electronic and atomic structure of the investigated interfaces , e.g. , to determine adhesion energies .",
    "results obtained with dft , such as potential - energy curves , can be used as a starting point for a multi - scale approach in which data is handed over to , e.g. , large - scale classical md simulations  @xcite . in the last years also quantum - classical embedding techniques have been developed and improved allowing to treat crucial parts of a system with high accuracy methods such as dft , while most of the system is evaluated using less expensive methods .",
    "@xcite such joint approaches combined with the continuously increasing available computer power and advances in software tools promise the possibility to study even larger and more realistic systems in the near future .",
    "investigations on al / tin interfaces have been conducted by various researches using experimental  @xcite as well as theoretical  @xcite methods .",
    "the role of interfacial species at al / tin interfaces is , however , less studied .",
    "liu et al .",
    "@xcite and zhang et al .",
    "@xcite investigated the effects of hydrogen and zn as well as mg , respectively , on al / tin interfaces .",
    "both computational studies concluded that the interfacial adhesion is reduced by the additional species at the interface . here",
    ", the emphasis lies on the role of oxygen , since aluminum is usually covered by an oxide layer under ambient conditions .",
    "@xcite further information on oxide layers on aluminum surfaces can be found , e.g. , in refs .  .",
    "as a first step towards a more detailed description of al / tin interfaces , the al slab is terminated by one layer of oxygen in the current work , which focuses on the possibility of material transfer and its ab - initio simulation .",
    "insights on copper / diamond interfaces with and without interfacial species have been presented by various researchers  @xcite .",
    "cu / c@xmath0 will be used as an abbreviation below .",
    "a better understanding necessarily includes detailed work on the structure of clean and hydrogen terminated diamond surfaces . for cu / c@xmath0 interfaces ,",
    "guo et al .",
    "@xcite studied the fracture behaviour by comparing the work of separation and the work of decohesion .",
    "the structure and work of separation for such interfaces including h terminated diamond was examined computationally by wang and smith  @xcite .",
    "they found a strong decrease in the adhesion energy and thus the work of separation of cu / c@xmath0 interfaces upon the introduction of interfacial hydrogen , but they did not investigate material transfer explicitly .",
    "their results are in agreement with experiments performed by pepper  @xcite on the frictional properties of these interfaces . furthermore , in a recent study involving md simulations of nanoscratching zhu et al .",
    "@xcite observed that the minimum depth of material transfer at cu surfaces can be as thin as only one atomic layer of cu depending on the machining conditions . in this work , as for the al / tin interfaces , the emphasis is put on material transfer and its ab - initio simulation .",
    "to investigate the properties of al / tin interfaces and cu / c@xmath0 interfaces terminated with oxygen and hydrogen , respectively , we performed calculations of the approach and subsequent separation of two slabs forming one of the aforementioned interfaces .",
    "the focus of this paper is put on al / tin interfaces , while results on contacting cu and diamond slabs are given for comparison , validation of the method as well as a more general view of the subject .",
    "all results were calculated within the framework of dft using the vienna ab initio simulation package ( vasp )  @xcite .",
    "vasp uses periodic boundary conditions and a plane - wave basis set within the projector augmented - wave ( paw ) formalism  @xcite .",
    "the interaction between the ionic core and the valence electrons is mediated by the corresponding paw pseudopotentials .",
    "the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) in the perdew , burke , and ernzerhof ( pbe ) parametrization  @xcite was used to describe the exchange and correlation ( xc ) functional , unless explicitly mentioned otherwise .",
    "while ggas often underestimate binding and adhesion energies  @xcite , the local - density approximation ( lda )  @xcite usually overestimates these quantities  @xcite .",
    "further examples but also deviations from this trend for the behaviour of different xc functionals are presented in ref .  . here",
    ", calculations employing the lda were performed for comparison and validation .",
    "for the same reason the van der waals ( vdw ) density functional ( df ) optb86b  @xcite was employed , which incorporates a nonlocal correlation term approximating vdw interactions . the `` opt ''",
    "vdw - dfs were applied to diverse materials , e.g. , see refs .  , and proved to be of good accuracy .",
    "accurate total energies are guaranteed by a careful choice of the calculation parameters .",
    "k_-space integrations were performed using a @xmath1-centered @xmath2 monkhorst - pack mesh  @xcite .",
    "the energy cutoff for the plane - wave basis was set to .",
    "both settings allow for total energies accurate to .",
    "while atomic relaxations were performed employing the method of methfessel and paxton  @xcite to first - order with a smearing of , the tetrahedron method with blchl corrections  @xcite was used for all static calculations . since the method of methfessel and paxton",
    "should only be used for metallic systems , gaussian smearing of was chosen for relaxations of the cu / c@xmath0 interfaces . a damped molecular dynamics ( md ) algorithm was selected in order to relax the atomic structures until an energy convergence criterion of was fulfilled .",
    "each converged relaxation was followed up by a static calculation to obtain more accurate total energies . for electronic self - consistency cycles",
    "a convergence criterion of was used .",
    "all simulations were performed at .",
    "the damped md relaxation scheme was chosen instead of the widely used conjugate - gradient or quasi - newton algorithms , because these two algorithms caused convergence problems and the tendency to remain stuck in local minima .",
    "the simulation model is described here for the case of an al / tin interface , using the methodology presented by the authors in an earlier publication  @xcite .",
    "the same route is followed in the case of cu / c@xmath0 interfaces .    to model our al / tin systems we constructed simulation cells from a fcc ( 111 ) al slab at the bottom and a rock salt ( 111 ) tin slab above ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : al - tin - side ] ) .",
    "the gap between the two slabs is called the `` interface distance '' which is measured from the top layer of the lower slab to the bottom layer of the upper slab , regardless of termination . in the following the term `` slab height '' refers to the vertical distance between the bottom al and top tin layers , which is the sum of the interface distance and the heights of the two slabs . to investigate the effect of oxygenation",
    ", an al slab was terminated by oxygen at the interface ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : al - o - tin - side ] ) . in this",
    "work 1@xmath31 surface cells were used , which represent infinitely extended surfaces because of the periodic boundary conditions . the tin slab consisted of a minimum of six ti and six n layers , while the al slab are built of seven layers .",
    "these geometric parameters are consistent with previous investigations .  @xcite .",
    "0.25     0.25     in the [ 111 ] direction tin is built from alternating layers of pure ti or n ; therefore , the ( 111 ) surface of a tin slab is either terminated by a layer of ti or n. the termination depends on the chemical potential of nitrogen . in an earlier publication  @xcite it was shown that both cases are found in reasonable nitrogen concentration ranges by performing a thermodynamic analysis  @xcite to calculate the surface gibbs free energy for the off - stoichiometric slabs  @xcite .",
    "the presented results are in agreement with the refs .  .",
    "in this work the main focus is put on n terminated slabs , since this termination is favorable at small deviations of the nitrogen chemical potential from its molecular reference , i.e. at ambient conditions . over a wide range of the nitrogen chemical potential",
    "the ( 001 ) tin surface is actually the most stable orientation ; however , al / tin interfaces between ( 001 ) slabs do not show any material transfer .",
    "@xcite thus , results for interfaces between ( 111 ) surfaces , which show a similar stability at certain values of the chemical potential and allow for material transfer at least between pristine surfaces , are presented in this work .",
    "dipole corrections  @xcite perpendicular to the interface ( z direction ) were found to be negligible . to decouple the periodically repeated simulation cells in the z direction , a vacuum spacing of at least",
    "was included in the simulation cell . performing bulk calculations the lattice parameters of the single materials , and for al and tin , respectively , were obtained .",
    "the experimental lattice constants  @xcite of al and tin are and , respectively , confirming our calculation to be accurate within 0.5% relative error . for the simulation cells combining al and tin slabs , an intermediate lattice parameter of",
    "was used for the lateral xy lattice vectors to equalize the relative error of about 2.6% for both materials .",
    "the consequences of such distortions were investigated in detail in an earlier publication  @xcite , where no influence of the chosen lattice parameter on the occurrence of material transfer was observed . for the z direction",
    "the material - specific values for the layer distances were used assuming a pseudomorphic interface .",
    "it has to be noted that in reality such a simple mutual adjustment of thick slabs by a combination of stretching and compression does not usually occur , since dislocations at the interface or an incommensurate contact are more plausible .",
    "thus , some of the atoms would not be aligned perfectly according to the stacking of their respective original slabs as well as across the interface , but rather sample slightly different local environments . for computational reasons ,",
    "these different local arrangements across the interface are assessed by considering various configurations at the interface which constitute limiting cases .",
    "the simulation of the approach and separation of the slabs follows the method described in ref .  .",
    "for convenience the main points are repeated here .",
    "the approach and subsequent separation of the two slabs were simulated by moving the upper slab in discrete steps along the z direction and allowing for electronic and atomic relaxations after each step .",
    "for the atomic relaxations the bottom three al as well as the top tin ( three ti and three n ) layers were kept rigid at bulk - like distances , while the intermediate `` free '' ones were allowed to fully relax .",
    "this is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : al - tin - initial ] for the n - terminated case . for the approach and separation step sizes of and ,",
    "respectively , were used . for the observation of material transfer",
    "the separation is more critical ; therefore , a smaller step size was used , which allows for higher accuracy but causes increased computational costs . the approach and separation of the slabs",
    "were initiated from equilibrium structures , i.e. , separately relaxed slabs and the structure with the lowest energy determined during the approach , respectively . to simulate a realistic separation process only the topmost",
    ", rigid tin layers were moved in discrete steps in the positive z direction , again allowing for electronic and atomic relaxations after each step , i.e. , a separation of the slabs at the initial interface was not promoted by the enforced step - wise motion .    to study the effects of different local environments at the interface , several alignments of the slabs were investigated by placing the upper slab laterally on various sites with respect to the surface of the lower slab .",
    "as mentioned above these different configurations represent limiting scenarios for more complex realistic interfaces .",
    "the definitions of the alignments are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bond - sites ] by marking the high - symmetry points on the n - terminated ( 111 ) tin surface where the next al or o atom can be placed .",
    "the alignments are named according to the stacking of the bottom tin layer with respect to the al slab , the position of interfacial species is not taken into account in this naming convention .",
    "the different configurations are compared via the interaction energy @xmath4 , which is defined as the difference of the total energy of the interacting slabs @xmath5 at slab height @xmath6 and the reference energies of the two independent slabs , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , @xmath9    1 surface cell of a n - terminated ( 111 ) tin surface .",
    "filled circles indicate atoms in the top surface layer for each species ( ti and n are given by large purple and small cyan circles , respectively ) , while empty circles label atoms below the top surface layer . to obtain a ti - terminated ( 111 ) tin surface the ti and n atoms of the shown n - terminated surface have to be exchanged .",
    "high - symmetry points ( top , hcp , fcc ) are highlighted . ]",
    "the fcc adsorption site is favored by a single oxygen atom on a 1@xmath31 ( 111 ) al surface cell . the oxygen is strongly bound to the al surface exhibiting a rather small binding distance of about with an adsorption energy of about with respect to molecular , gas - phase oxygen .",
    "@xcite the hcp site is slightly less favorable by about , while the interaction on the top site is much weaker and not favorable considering molecular oxygen as the reference . additionally , the placement of two o atoms on each 1@xmath31 al surface cell was tested .",
    "the two atoms were located initially above the fcc and hcp sites of the al surface . during a subsequent relaxation the fcc o atom moved beneath the top al layer , while the hcp o atom stayed above the al surface .",
    "the distance between the top o - al compound and the remaining o terminated al slab grew to about .",
    "this large distance combined with a very weak adhesion ( ) of this compound on the surface shows that the termination with one o atom per surface cell is preferential on a 1@xmath31 al surface cell .",
    "the possibility of an al@xmath10o@xmath11-like surface oxide  @xcite is not considered here .",
    "since material transfer at interfaces is of interest , the energy necessary to remove layers from a material is an important quantity . for this work ,",
    "additionally the question arises whether this removal energy is affected by an oxygen layer .",
    "the removal of the layers was simulated by placing the layers at a large distance from the remaining slab , which does not allow for interactions between the slab and layers .",
    "results for pristine al slab including the effect of compressive and tensile stress were presented in an earlier publication  @xcite . here",
    ", only the values necessary for comparison are repeated in table  [ tab : removal ] .",
    "typically , it is energetically unfavorable to remove just one al layer compared to at least two layers .",
    "moreover , the removal energies are not changing significantly for two or more layers ; therefore , the removal of two al layers is used as a reference here . as mentioned above ,",
    "oxygen is strongly bound to the al slab .",
    "thus , it is unlikely that only the oxygen is removed and so the more plausible case of and the removal of the oxygen layer together with al layers is investigated here .",
    "the data in table  [ tab : removal ] shows that an oxygen layer hardly influences the removal energies which indicates that the bond breaking between the al layers is the determining factor .",
    "nevertheless , oxygen may still passivate a surface by suppressing interactions , i.e. weakening the interfacial adhesion , across an interface with another material such as tin .",
    ".[tab : removal ] energy costs to remove the top two al layers , with or without an additional oxygen layer , from a pristine and a oxygenated al slab , respectively , using pbe and lda .",
    "the removal energies are given in per 1@xmath31 surface cell . [ cols=\"<,^,^ \" , ]     0.15     0.15     0.15     0.15      +    0.15     0.15     0.15     0.15     for ti - terminated tin slabs the adhesion energies at the al / tin interfaces are also reduced upon the introduction of oxygen at the interface . for different alignments at the interface the values of the adhesion energies range between to and to for the oxygenated and non - oxygenated  @xcite contact , respectively .",
    "the decrease is less pronounced than for the n - terminated case because of more favorable ti - o interactions .",
    "nevertheless , material transfer becomes again unfavorable because of the interfacial oxygen , since the adhesion energies become smaller than the al - o removal energies of about .",
    "the relevant information is summarized in table  [ tab : loop - data ] .",
    "in addition to the al / tin interfaces , cu / c@xmath0 interfaces were investigated to test the used method for the simulation of material transfer on a different system .",
    "analogous to the studies of al / tin , results on interfaces between the ( 111 ) surfaces of cu / c@xmath0 are discussed in this section . in general , the diamond ( 111 ) surface exhibits a ( 2 @xmath3 1 ) reconstruction ; however , in the case of hydrogen termination as well as at cu / c@xmath0 interfaces no reconstructions are observed and ( 1 @xmath3 1 ) configurations are found  @xcite .",
    "thus , in this work only ( 1 @xmath3 1 ) structures are considered . at the diamond ( 111 )",
    "surface two terminations are possible .",
    "here , the single dangling bond configuration is assumed , because it is more stable for reasonable hydrogen chemical potentials than the triple dangling bond terminations  @xcite .",
    "particularly , the former configuration is more favourable at interfaces with copper  @xcite .",
    "the energy necessary to remove material from an ( 111 ) cu slab is about , which will be compared to the adhesion energies for several alignments at cu / c@xmath0 interfaces in the following . of the examined high symmetry contact configurations , which are defined in the same way as for the al / tin interfaces , the top and fcc alignments result in the strongest and weakest interfaces , respectively .",
    "the adhesion energy for the top configuration is about , while for the fcc case it amounts to about .",
    "since these adhesion energies are larger than the cost to remove material from the cu slab , material transfer is expected to occur for all configurations .",
    "employing the method of approach and subsequent separation of the two slabs described above leads indeed to the material transfer of one layer of cu towards the c@xmath0 slab for all tested contact scenarios , which are considered to be the limiting cases .",
    "figures showing the corresponding interaction - energy curves are included in the supplementary material .",
    "@xcite these results support the dft - based work of guo et al .",
    "@xcite who predicted the occurrence of fracture at cu / c@xmath0 interface between the first two metallic layers or the 2nd and the 3rd layers , because of a bond weakening resulting from the contact with the c@xmath0 counterbody .",
    "as for the al / tin interfaces , the effect of additional interfacial species was studied at the contact of cu and c. since the dangling bonds at diamond surfaces are often saturated by hydrogen atoms , this species was chosen for our investigation . at the c@xmath0 ( 111 ) surface the h atoms prefer to sit at top sites in a distance of just above each c atom forming a p(1 @xmath3 1 ) pattern .",
    "this is in good agreement with literature , e.g. in ref .  .",
    "the adhesion energies for all studied contact configurations of the cu / c@xmath0 interfaces are extremely reduced to about for hydrogen terminated c@xmath0 surfaces in a similar fashion as for the oxygenated al surfaces at the al / tin interfaces .",
    "since these adhesion energies are much lower than the cu removal energies of about , no material transfer is expected .",
    "this predicted behavior is verified by the method of approach and separation .",
    "figures of the resulting interaction - energy curves are shown in the supplementary material .",
    "@xcite    the same results with respect to material transfer were obtained employing further xc functionals , namely lda and vdw - optb86b . as expected using these functionals the adhesion as well as removal energies for all investigated interfaces",
    "are increased similar to the al / tin interfaces . for the clean surfaces",
    "lda and vdw - optb86b yield very similar adhesion energies within about for each configuration .",
    "these energies are about and for the fcc and top alignment , respectively . as for pbe ,",
    "the adhesion energies are drastically reduced for interfaces involving hydrogenated c@xmath0 surfaces . using lda the adhesion energies are between for the fcc configuration and for the top case , while for vdw - optb86b these energies range between about and for the corresponding alignments .",
    "the energies necessary to remove cu layers from a cu slab are also increased to and for lda and vdw - optb86b , respectively .",
    "these results show that the choice of the investigated xc functionals does not affect the results for material transfer .",
    "the findings presented above agree well with theoretical and experimental results presented in the introduction including the strong effect of interfacial hydrogen on the adhesion energy  @xcite and the possibility of a transfer of only one atomic layer of cu  @xcite . additionally , performing large - scale molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations on the rubbing contact of hydrogenated diamond bodies and tungsten surfaces , stoyanov et al .",
    "@xcite found that material transfer between c@xmath0 and w mainly occurred at regions where the hydrogen had been depleted from the diamond surface because of the rubbing process .",
    "this observation is in qualitative agreement with our study finding material transfer only possible for non - hydrogenated diamond surfaces .",
    "the adhesion energies at al / tin and cu / c@xmath0 interfaces are reduced significantly by the presence of a monolayer of oxygen and hydrogen at al / tin and cu / c@xmath0 interfaces , respectively .",
    "this reduction is investigated by analyzing the densities of states and charge density differences at the aforementioned interfaces which reveal distinct bonding situations .",
    "particularly , the possibility of material transfer at the interfaces is of interest .",
    "the occurrence of material transfer was studied by simulating the approach and subsequent separation of two slabs . for the clean surfaces material transfer of one or two atomic layers",
    "was found to be favorable for both investigated material combinations depending on the local interfacial configuration .",
    "the additional interfacial species o and h passivate the involved surfaces with respect to material transfer because of the strongly reduced adhesion energies for all investigated configurations .",
    "this is in agreement with the observation that metal - ceramic interfaces break at the interface or in bulk areas according to their interfacial adhesion  @xcite .",
    "the results with respect to material transfer were not affected upon the use of different approximations for the exchange - correlation functional .",
    "the investigation of more complex interfacial species such as extended oxides instead of the studied monolayers promises to be very interesting in order to model many systems in a more realistic fashion .",
    "while , in principle , the method employed in this work can be applied to any pair of materials , in practice this can be computationally quite cumbersome .",
    "large simulation cells , which translate into high computational demands , become necessary for complex materials or materials with an unfavorable bulk lattice mismatch because the translational symmetry has to be preserved and the lattice distortions should be as low as possible . on the other hand , larger cells allow to account for additional features such the minimization of lattice mismatches and the possibility to model dislocations or quasi - incommensurate contacts at interfaces .",
    "furthermore , surface roughness can be treated to some extent by using a stepped surface or a regular arrangement of asperities .",

    "<S> the effect of monolayers of oxygen ( o ) and hydrogen ( h ) on the possibility of material transfer at aluminum / titanium nitride ( al / tin ) and copper / diamond ( cu / c@xmath0 ) interfaces , respectively , were investigated within the framework of density functional theory ( dft ) . to this end the approach , contact , and subsequent separation of two atomically flat surfaces consisting of the aforementioned pairs of materials were simulated . </S>",
    "<S> these calculations were performed for the clean as well as oxygenated and hydrogenated al and c@xmath0 surfaces , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> various contact configurations were considered by studying several lateral arrangements of the involved surfaces at the interface . </S>",
    "<S> the consistency of the dft results was evaluated by using different approximations for the exchange - correlation functional . </S>",
    "<S> material transfer is typically possible at interfaces between the investigated clean surfaces ; however , the addition of o to the al and h to the c@xmath0 surfaces was found to hinder material transfer . </S>",
    "<S> this passivation occurs because of a significant reduction of the adhesion energy at the examined interfaces , which can be explained by the distinct bonding situations . </S>"
