    "the theoretical modeling of statistical systems in many areas of physics makes use of random hamiltonians . assuming self - averaging , observable quantities may be evaluated by the logarithmic average of the partition function @xmath0@xmath1@xmath2 over the quenched random variables . in this way",
    ", the technically difficult task of computing @xmath3 for a given realization of the disorder is avoided .",
    "however , the mathematical operation of directly computing @xmath0@xmath1@xmath2 is also difficult , and can be done only using replica trick , which implies the computation of @xmath0@xmath4@xmath2 .    despite its highly successful application to the treatment of some disordered systems (",
    "the most celebrated is the sk model  @xcite , the replica trick encounters serious difficulties when applied to many other models .",
    "the main reason is the unbounded proliferation of replica order parameters , as for example the multi - overlaps in dilute spin glass  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we use a class of replica order parameters firstly introduced by monasson  @xcite , which , in principle can be used for all models .",
    "we preliminarily observe that the computation of @xmath0@xmath4@xmath2 implies the sum over all the realizations of the spin variables @xmath5 , any of them may take @xmath6 values .",
    "assume that @xmath7 is the number of vectors @xmath8 which equal the given vector @xmath9 = ( @xmath10 ) , then , @xmath0@xmath4@xmath2 can be re - expressed in terms of a sum over the possible positive values of the @xmath6 magnetization densities @xmath11 , with the constraint @xmath12 . in practice , this is equivalent to maximize with respect to these order parameters .",
    "the strategy proposed here will be illustrated , considering the sk model , in next section , where we will also show the complete equivalence with the standard approach .",
    "nevertheless , all models can be described in terms of the @xmath6 order parameters @xmath11 .",
    "we will tackle the dilute ferromagnetic ising model in section 3 and in section 4 we will compute exactly the ground state energy and entropy .",
    "the results coincide with those found in @xcite where the approach is not based on replicas . in section 5",
    "we extend the scope by considering the same model in presence of a magnetic field with random locations , and , finally , in section 6 we are able to compute the ground state energy and entropy also in this case .",
    "conclusions and outlook are in the final section .",
    "in this section we try to illustrate our approach considering the sk model .",
    "we do not have new results concerning sk , but we just show the complete equivalence with the standard replica approach .    the partition function is    @xmath13    where the sum @xmath14 goes over the @xmath15 realizations of the @xmath16 , the sum @xmath17 goes over all @xmath18 pairs @xmath19 and the @xmath20 are independent random variables with 0 mean and variance 1 .",
    "then , by replica approach , neglecting terms which vanish in the thermodynamic limit , we have    @xmath21    where the sum @xmath14 goes over the @xmath22 realizations of the @xmath23 and the sum @xmath24 goes over all @xmath25 possible values of @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "assume that @xmath28 is the number of vectors ( @xmath29 ) which equal the given vector @xmath9 = ( @xmath30 ) , then , according to  @xcite , we can write    @xmath31    where @xmath32 goes over the @xmath33 possible values of the variables @xmath9 and @xmath34 and where @xmath35 is the scalar product @xmath36",

    "the constraint can be accounted by adding the lagrangian multiplier @xmath44 to expression ( [ skphin ] ) , then the maximum is given by    @xmath45    where @xmath46 has to be chosen in order to have @xmath43 . from this equation",
    "we get that the maximum is realized for the set of the @xmath6 order parameters @xmath11 which satisfy    @xmath47    where the sum @xmath48 goes over the @xmath6 possible values of the variable @xmath34 and where @xmath49 is    @xmath50    and where @xmath38 is the sum over the @xmath6 possible values of the variable @xmath9 .",
    "the explicit solution could be found , in principle , by a proper choice of the parametrization of the @xmath11 , but it can be easily seen that this solution coincides with the standard solution of the sk model .",
    "in fact , if one defines the symmetric matrix @xmath51 as    @xmath52    one gets    @xmath53    where    @xmath54    the sum @xmath55 goes over all @xmath56 pairs @xmath57 and the diagonal therms of the matrix @xmath51 disappeared since they cancel out in the expressions ( [ skx ] ) , ( [ ska ] ) .",

    "in this section , we show how our approach works for the dilute ferromagnetic system .",
    "this model is much less studied than sk , and many informations about its phenomenology are still missing .",
    "the partition function is    @xmath63    where @xmath64 are quenched variables which take the value @xmath65 with probability @xmath66 and @xmath67 otherwise .",
    "the dilution coefficient @xmath68 may take any positive value and the number of bonds is about @xmath69 .",
    "this model has been recently studied in a recent paper  @xcite , while models with lesser dilution   @xcite ( number of bonds of order @xmath70 with @xmath71 ) have been also considered .",

    "let us consider the simpler case of vanishing temperature",

    ". we can write :    @xmath91    which obviously satisfy the constraint @xmath43 . inserting the above expression in ( [ gtpott ] )",
    "we obtain    @xmath92 \\label{ft}\\ ] ]    with    @xmath93    if we expand to the first order in @xmath94 the above expression , we obtain    @xmath95 \\label{fgt}\\ ] ]    then , if we take into account ( [ fpsi ] ) and we also take into account that for large @xmath96 one has @xmath97 , we have that the energy at 0 temperature equals    @xmath98    while the entropy @xmath61 is @xmath99 . therefore :    @xmath100    where @xmath101 is given by the equation    @xmath102    this equation has a single solution @xmath103 if @xmath104 and one more non trivial solution if @xmath105 which corresponds to the maximum .",
    "therefore , at 0 temperature , for @xmath106 the system is in a paramagnetic phase while for @xmath107 is in a disordered ferromagnetic phase .",
    "the transition corresponds to the percolation transition generated by the ferromagnetic links .",

    ", if the correct maximum is found we get @xmath120",

    "we are able to compute exactly the ground state energy and entropy .",
    "when temperature is not vanishing , we only write down the formal solution , while the effective one asks for a correct parametrization of the magnetization densities @xmath11 . in this case in fact , the problem is not mapped into a simple potts model .",

    "the method can be straightforwardly applied to the dilute spin glass , where we hope to find analogous results . since , in principle",
