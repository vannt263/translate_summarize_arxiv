    "over the last thirty years , the dglap @xcite approach to parton dynamics has demonstrated itself as the most adequate tool for the description of the energy scale dependence of a variety of lepton - nucleon , and nucleon - nucleon processes over a wide kinematical range .",
    "surprisingly , not just this approximation , but the lowest order in perturbation theory within this approach ( lo ) gives fairly accurate estimates for paradigmatic processes such as inclusive deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) , provided an energy or momentum scale of a few gev characterizes them .",
    "the following order ( nlo ) often represents small corrections , required for precise comparisons , but not for the broad picture .    in the few last years high precision dis experiments , with a wide kinematical coverage , and the ability to measure less inclusive processes , such as those performed by the zeus and h1 collaborations at hera ,",
    "have extended the tests on the dynamics of partons to the limits of their kinematical reach , looking for signatures of dynamics complementary to that described by the dglap approach .",
    "illustrative examples of these tests are the measurements of final state hadrons @xcite and jets @xcite produced in dis processes in the forward region , for which the lo dglap description fail to reproduce the data by an order of magnitude , and even nlo estimates fall short .    in a recent analysis @xcite , it has been shown that the striking failure of the lo description in the case of forward hadrons by no means implies the breakdown of the dglap dynamics , but just the inadequacy of the lo picture , which simply does not include the dominant contribution to the measured cross section : the process in which an initial state gluon is knocked out from the nucleon , and also a gluon fragments into the detected final state hadron .",
    "indeed , the nlo approximation , which takes into account these contributions , reproduce nicely the data @xcite .    in the case of forward jets , the situation seems to be more compromised , because not only the lo estimates fail , but also nlo estimates fall short by a factor of two of the data @xcite . in reference",
    "@xcite this feature together with the large scale dependence of nlo calculations , has been taken as indicative of the importance of higher order corrections . in order to improve the understanding of this situation , in the present paper we compute the order @xmath0 corrections to the single inclusive jet cross section in lepton - nucleon deep inelastic scattering .",
    "we perform the full calculation analytically , factoring out explicitly the remnant initial state singularities into the definition of parton densities , and dealing with those of final states in the small cone approximation , which assumes that the cone of the jet is narrow @xcite .",
    "this approximation allows us to translate straightforwardly previous results on hadroproduction @xcite to the case of jets , avoiding a rather cumbersome calculation and delicate numerical treatments for dealing with the collinear singularities . in section",
    "i we outline the technical framework required for the small cone approximation ( sca ) in the case of dis .",
    "the small cone technique approximates the full result obtained by nlo monte carlo generators , providing fairly good estimates for the cross sections with differences typically smaller than the theoretical uncertainties of the nlo estimate in the relevant kinematical range .",
    "we investigate in section ii the range of validity of the small cone approximation against the full monte carlo nlo parton generators .",
    "the finite cross sections obtained within the small cone approximation can be implemented in fast and stable codes , and simple to use . exploiting the flexibility of them , in section iii",
    "we perform a detailed study of the different underlying partonic reactions and their main features : the size of the corrections they get at nlo accuracy , their relative weight , and the residual scale uncertainty they leave in the full cross section depending on the kinematical region explored .",
    "our main conclusion is that , as in the case of hadroproduction , the dominant partonic process in the most forward jet region accessed yet is the one with a gluon in the initial state and also a gluon as the main seed of the jet .",
    "this process starts at order @xmath0 , and makes the nlo effectively a lowest order estimate , with the consequent large factorization scale uncertainty , and the likelihood of non - negligible corrections at the subsequent order in perturbation .",
    "in this section we outline the calculation of the single - jet - inclusive dis cross section within the small cone approximation .",
    "this technique has been proposed @xcite and used in computations of unpolarized single inclusive cross sections @xcite , and more recently has been extended and validated for polarized proton - proton collisions @xcite .",
    "the sca can be thought as an expansion of the partonic cross section in terms of the half aperture @xmath1 of the cone over which the radiation around a given final state parton is integrated .",
    "this cone defines the jet at partonic level and the integration over it regularizes all final state collinear singularities .",
    "keeping the most significant terms in this expansion , which is given by @xmath2 and neglecting @xmath3 and higher contributions , the expansion approximates surprisingly well the full results of the cone algorithm for cone radius up to @xmath4 in applications for proton - proton collisions @xcite .",
    "the main advantage of the approach in the present case is that it is possible to relate analytical results on one - particle - inclusive cross sections calculated previously @xcite , where all collinear divergences have already been canceled or factorized into parton densities and fragmentation functions , to the single - jet - inclusive cross section , for which the sca gives an analytical expression as a function of the cone aperture . as in reference @xcite , we restrict the discussion to the case of non - vanishing transverse momentum .",
    "the limit of vanishing transverse momentum requires a more involved treatment of collinear singularities @xcite .",
    "schematically , we start with the finite one - particle - inclusive cross section , we undo the factorization of final state collinear singularities into fragmentation functions , which of course is not pertinent in the case of jet cross sections .",
    "then , we add contributions that are not accounted for in the one - particle - inclusive fragmentation scheme , i.e. jets formed by two partons .",
    "the result is completely finite and for phenomenological applications can be convoluted with parton densities just as in the case of the one particle inclusive cross section . in practice ,",
    "the approach is equivalent to having defined effective jet fragmentation functions that factorize the final state singularities .      in order to implement the approach in the case of dis , we start defining the total cross section for the partonic process @xmath5 with @xmath6 partons in the final state : @xmath7\\ , \\left[\\frac{d^{3}p_{{\\mbox{\\tiny jet}}}}{2\\,e_{{\\mbox{\\tiny jet}}}}\\right]\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath8 defines the jet momentum in terms of the momenta of the @xmath6 partons , @xmath9 is the momentum fraction of the parent hadron carried by parton @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the squared energy of the collision in the lepton - proton center of mass , and @xmath12 the usual bjorken variable .",
    "the index @xmath13 stands for metric and longitudinal contributions respectively .",
    "@xmath14 is a symmetry factor that account for identical partons in the final state .",
    "since the last two factors between square brackets in equation are lorentz invariant , we can evaluate the latter in the hadronic center of mass while the former in partonic center of mass .",
    "these frames are defined by @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively , with @xmath17 and @xmath18 the momenta of the initial state proton and parton respectively . in the hadronic center of mass frame , it is convenient to use the transverse energy , @xmath19 , and pseudo - rapidity @xmath20 , while in the partonic frame , we use the same variables as for the one - particle - inclusive case @xcite : @xmath21 with @xmath22 replacing the jet phase space in eq .",
    "we find @xmath23 where we have introduced @xmath24\\ , \\left[\\pi\\,\\frac{s}{2}\\,(1-y)\\right]\\,.\\ ] ] and @xmath25 .",
    "we omit from now on the index @xmath26 , since all the results that follow are valid for both metric and longitudinal components .",
    "notice that equation is valid in @xmath27 dimensions . convolving the partonic cross section with appropriate parton densities @xmath28 ,",
    "the hadronic cross section can be written as @xmath29 at variance with the one - particle - inclusive case , the variable @xmath30 is completely determined by @xmath19 and @xmath20 , @xmath31 while @xmath32 is not fixed .",
    "equation ( [ eq : hadcsfinal ] ) coincides with equation ( 13 ) in @xcite when @xmath33 .",
    "in addition to the jet analog of the one - particle - inclusive contribution , where the detected final state jet is originated from the fragmentation of just one final state parton , while the other partons play as spectators and are integrated over , we have to consider additional contributions in the full jet cross section .",
    "the former will be denoted as @xmath34 , with initial state parton @xmath10 and fragmenting parton @xmath26 .",
    "the latter include , on the one hand , contributions accounting for the situations in which the jet is formed by two partons which are denoted as @xmath35 . on the other hand",
    ", we have to subtract configurations in which the cone that defines the jet contains two of the final state partons , that in the one particle inclusive case were nevertheless classified as @xmath34 .",

    "notice that cross sections with identical partons in the final state get a symmetry factor , so we have to add them to the corresponding matrix elements , before factorization .",
    "for instance , all the matrix elements involved in the first and third reaction have to be multiplied by @xmath46 due to the presence of two gluons or two identical quarks in the final state .",
    "in the small cone approximation it is customary to neglect @xmath3 contributions in the cross section , which means we can approximate the matrix elements associated to two partons forming a jet with the corresponding collinear limit .",
    "this simplifies drastically the calculation because in this limit the @xmath37 @xmath47 matrix elements factorize into @xmath48 @xmath49 matrix elements times lo splitting functions . in the list above ,",
    "we have skipped terms that vanish in this approximation .",

    "the double poles cancel with terms coming from @xmath79 , whereas the remaining @xmath80 poles cancel terms generated when the fragmentation function factorization of the one - particle - inclusive cross section is undone .",

    "is simply to add to the already finite one - particle - inclusive cross section the terms we customary factorize into fragmentation functions , with the opposite sign .",
    "this provides a check of the whole calculation , as the simple poles still appearing in the correction terms have to cancel when we add these contributions .",

    "this is also the case for dis and the rates show a very mild dependence in the kinematical variables .",
    "certainly , the accuracy of sca is the better for smaller cone radius , however the error introduced by the approximation with @xmath103 , which is of the order of a 10 % , always underestimating the cross section and with a very mild dependence on the relevant variables , is comparable or smaller than the theoretical uncertainty coming from the particular choice of the factorization and renormalization scales , characteristic of the nlo corrections in this kinematical region . as we show in the following section , this means that we can safely use the sca results as an estimate of the size and behavior of the nlo corrections . for comparison , in the figure [ fig : codis ] ,",
    "we also plot as a band the uncertainty resulting from varying the factorization and renormalization scale by a factor of two in the full monte carlo result .",
    "having established our level of confidence in the sca results , we proceed analyzing the distinctive features of the nlo corrections in the forward region .",
    "we do the analysis in the typical kinematic region tested by desy experiments , where large higher order effects have been observed .     for different rapidity regions.,width=548 ]    the most striking of these features is the size of the nlo corrections as the rapidity of the jets increases . in figure",
    "[ fig : h1k ] we show both lo an nlo partonic level expectations coming from the sca approach in three different regions of rapidity for @xmath117 and @xmath118 as a function of transverse jet momentum .",
    "clearly , nlo corrections , which are moderate for central rapidities , become significantly large in the forward region .",
    "this feature is due to a suppression of the lo contributions rather than to an increase in rapidity of the cross sections .",
    "k - factors can exceed an order of magnitude there , invalidating the lowest order approximation .",

    "another interesting feature of nlo corrections to be taken into account is the rather large uncertainty these corrections show associated with the choice for the factorization and renormalization scales . in figure",
    "[ fig : h1k ] we adopted @xmath119 for the factorization and renormalization scale .",
    "the choice for these scales is in principle arbitrary ; the differences found in any perturbative estimate coming from some particular choice for the scale or other , become smaller as more terms in the perturbation series are included .",

    "with such a large scale uncertainty , any particular choice will probably lead to miss the data at some point .",
    "one possible choice in these cases is to take the average between them , which leads to an intermediate estimate within the band .",
    "again we can see that in the most forward bin , the uncertainty associated to the choice of the scale becomes more prominent and may be as large as a factor of two .     for different rapidity regions.,width=529 ]    in order to understand the correlation between higher order corrections and rapidity , it is useful to discriminate the different partonic contributions , classifying them as in the one particle inclusive case in terms of the initial state parton , @xmath26 , and the one taken as the seed for the jet , @xmath53 , as in @xmath121 .",

    "the cross section is dominated by the @xmath123 contributions ( an initial state gluon with a quark originating the jet ) , which are already present at lo , while in the latter the dominants are @xmath122 , which are pure nlo , shown in figure [ fig : diag ] .",
    "these contributions start at order @xmath0 so the nlo result is its lowest order estimate .",
    "the reason for their dominance over the lo is just the kinematical region chosen which suppress lo configurations .",
    "the dominance of the @xmath122 over @xmath123 nlo contributions can be traced back to the negative plus contributions which are proportional @xmath125 in the case of the former and to @xmath126 for the latter .",

    "the first order corrections for other partonic processes in this kinematic region rise typically to 50% effects , so it would not be surprising that the nlo estimate falls short of the data , specially if a more stringent kinematic range is explored .",
    "this is precisely what zeus has reported in preliminary analyses of measurements in the very forward region @xcite .    in figure",

    "one can expect the first order corrections to these processes , starting at nnlo , to be significant .",
    "in fact , it is there where the nlo estimate can be more distant to the data with a particular choice for the scale , as can be seen when comparing with the preliminary data in ref .",

    "we have computed the single jet inclusive deep inelastic scattering cross section at @xmath37 in the small cone approximation .",
    "we found that this approach approximates the full nlo monte carlo results within a 10% accuracy , error which is fairly moderate compared to the main source of theoretical uncertainty , the scale dependence .",
    "as in the case of hadroproduction in deep inelastic scattering , we have found that the dominant partonic processes in very forward jet production start at order @xmath0 , being effectively a lowest order estimate . as in any lowest order calculation",
    ", there is a large factorization scale uncertainty which can not be neglected , and it is likely that there will be large corrections at the subsequent order in perturbation .",
    "although taking into account this large dependence on the choice for the scale , one can bring agreement between data and nlo estimates , the difference between them for a particular choice is maximal precisely where the partonic contributions computed for the first time are dominant .",

    "<S> we analyze the order @xmath0 corrections to the single inclusive jet cross section in lepton - nucleon deep inelastic scattering . </S>",
    "<S> the full calculation is done analytically , in the small cone approximation , obtaining finite nlo partonic level cross sections for these processes . </S>",
    "<S> a detailed study of the different underlying partonic reactions is presented focusing in the size of the corrections they get at nlo accuracy , their relative weight , and the residual scale uncertainty they leave in the full cross section depending on the kinematical region explored . </S>",
    "<S> the dominant partonic process in very forward jet production is found to start at order @xmath0 , being effectively a lowest order estimate , with the consequent large factorization scale uncertainty , and the likelihood of non - negligible corrections at the subsequent order in perturbation theory .    </S>",
