    "we first distribute randomly a number @xmath8 of potential activity centers uniformly in the unit circle .",

    "we then connect the worker with the center maximizing the cost function , and add one to the value of the traffic corresponding to this center .",
    "we repeat this procedure until all workers are connected to a center .",

    "people who are not commuting to this specific center , but who have to travel close to it when commuting to their working place , might add to the traffic in the surroundings of this center .",
    "therefore , we should consider the traffic @xmath74 in the area around the center @xmath1 , that is to say the number of people whose commute path crosses the area of size @xmath73 around this center . for the sake of simplicity and clarity ,",

    "therefore , as the traffic increases , new centers are going to appear in the decreasing order of attractivity . in the distance - driven regime , however , individuals tend to connect to the closest center , and thus the centers should appear in a random order .",
    "+ more specifically , the attractivity - driven regime appears when the term @xmath75 $ ] is negligible compared to the attractivity @xmath24 at small values of traffic .",
    "then , maximising the value of @xmath72 amounts to maximising the attractivity of the center @xmath1",
    ". this will typically be the case when :      on the other hand , when @xmath77 , the attractivity of the centers becomes irrelevant and maximising @xmath72 amounts to connecting the closest center @xmath1 to @xmath0 .",
    "an important consequence is that the assumptions used to derive eq . 6 and eq .",
    "10 in the main text are not valid in the distance - driven regime .",
    "in fact , there can not be any stable monocentric state in the distance - driven regime and we start from the beginning ( after a few iterations ) with a polycentric state .",
    "therefore , the difference between attractivity - driven and distance - driven polycentric regime draws the distinction between a system which grows from a single center , and a system where several centers appear from the beginning .",
    "this may be interpreted as the emergence of a single city when people can afford to travel a longer distance than the extension of the system ( attractivity - driven ) , and of a system of cities when they can not ( distance - driven regime ) .",
    "+ in between these two regime lies an intermediate regime , which is neither completely driven by space , not completely driven by the attractivity .",
    "this interplay between space and attractivity makes this intermediate regime difficult to explore analytically , we thus limit ourselves in this letter to the two extreme regimes .",
    "we now show that if the parameters are such that there exists a monocentric state , then the system necessary evolves to an attractivity - driven polycentric structure .",
    "let us assume that the system is in a monocentric state : @xmath26 individuals commute to the center @xmath78 characterised by the attractivity @xmath25 .",

    "we are then led to eq .",
    "6 of the main text ( see further in the supplementary material for a derivation ) @xmath84 the second possibility is for the individual to choose the closest center , characterized by @xmath24 .",

    "this result indicates that if a monocentric state exists , the transition is always towards an attractivity - driven polycentric structure . or conversely , that there can not be any stable monocentric state in the distance - driven regime .        in order to verify the ordering in the apparition of secondary centers",
    "and therefore the existence of two distinct regimes , we increase the population in a certain configuration until all the the centers are populated . each time a new center is populated , we note its attractivity . at the end , we compare the list obtained with the list of all the attractivities of the centers in decreasing order and compute kendall s @xmath89 function defined by :      where @xmath91 is the number of centers , @xmath8 the number of concordant pairs and @xmath92 the number of discordant pairs .",

    "the transition is relatively slow , meaning the system keeps a spatial coherence for a reasonable range of @xmath102.[fig : coherence_length],scaledwidth=45.0% ]        in this section , we explicit the details of the calculation of the population @xmath36 for which a first secondary center appears in a city within our model .",

    "when @xmath133 we find that a secondary center appears when the population @xmath26 of the city is such that :          in order to check the validity of our assumptions and thus of the previous formula , we numerically generate a lot of systems for different values of @xmath21 , @xmath82 , @xmath8 and @xmath17 and determine the population @xmath36 at which a secondary center appears .",
    "we then plot the average of @xmath36 as a function of @xmath135 ( fig .",

    "therefore , we witness a transition from a monocentric to a polycentric regime only if the parameters are such that @xmath139 and @xmath140        in the derivation of @xmath141 in the main text , we assume that the traffic @xmath44 of the @xmath142 existing centers is rougly the same : @xmath143 .",
    "a simple argument supports this assertion : in order for the @xmath37 center to appear , eq . 7 in the main text",

    "second , @xmath153 from the maximum of the difference @xmath154 , which obviously depends on the distribution of @xmath22 .",
    "nevertheless , we can reasonably expect @xmath155 where @xmath156 is an increasing function of @xmath41 and decreasing function of @xmath8 .",
    "if we only consider the evolution of @xmath156 with @xmath41 , the function can be approximated around the current value of @xmath41 as :          which is still sublinear .",
    "the value of @xmath160 might change with @xmath41 depending on the distribution , but it will always be positive .",
    "thus , the dependence of @xmath41 with @xmath26 might not be a power - law , but it will definitely be sublinear .",
    "we assume that the random variables possess a probability density function @xmath163 defined on @xmath164 , and a cumulative distribution function @xmath165 defined on the same interval .",

    "<S> in this regime , the value of @xmath22 prevails and the monocentric state evolves to an attractivity - driven polycentric structure as the population increases ( if @xmath21 is too small , the monocentric regime does not exist see the supplementary material  @xcite for more details on these points ) . starting from a small city with a monocentric organisation , </S>",

    "<S> when the number @xmath26 of households increases , the traffic will also increase and some initially less attractive centers ( with smaller values of @xmath22 ) might become more attractive , leading to the appearance of new subcenters characterized by a nonzero number of commuters . more precisely , a new subcenter @xmath1 will appear when for an individual @xmath0 , we have @xmath27 . </S>",

    "<S> the new subcenter will thus be such that @xmath32 is minimum implying that it will have the second largest value denoted by @xmath33 . for a uniform distribution ( details of the calculation </S>",
    "<S> can be found in the supplementary material  @xcite , section 2 ) , on average @xmath34 leading to a critical value for the population @xmath35 whatever the system considered , there will therefore _ always _ be a critical value of the population above which the city becomes polycentric ( which can be smaller than one , in which case there is no monocentric regime at all , see the supplementary material  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the monocentric regime is therefore fundamentally unstable with regards to population increase , which is in agreement with the fact that no major city in the world exhibits a monocentric structure . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the smaller the value of @xmath17 ( or the larger the value of the capacity @xmath16 ) , the larger the critical population value @xmath36 which means that cities with good road systems are capable of absorbing large traffic show a monocentric structure for a longer period of time .    </S>",
    "<S> having established that cities will eventually adopt a polycentric structure , we can wonder how the number of subcenters varies with the population . </S>",
    "<S> we compute the value of the population at which the @xmath37 center appears . </S>",
    "<S> we still assume that we are in the attractivity - driven regime and that , so far , @xmath38 centers have emerged with @xmath39  @xcite , with a number of commuters @xmath40 , respectively . </S>",

    "<S> we also assume that the distance between the workers households and the activity centers is typically @xmath46 . </S>",

    "<S> if the @xmath24 are uniformly distributed , we have on average @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> it follows from these assumptions that ( 1 ) the @xmath37 center to appear is the @xmath37 most attractive one ( 2 ) the average value of the population @xmath50 at which the @xmath37 center appears is given by : @xmath51 conversely , the number @xmath41 of subcenters scales sublinearly with population as @xmath52 it is interesting to note that this result is robust : the dependence is sublinear , _ whatever the distribution _ of the random variable @xmath22 ( see the supplementary material  @xcite for a discussion on this point ) . </S>",
    "<S> we can therefore conclude that , probably very generally and under mild assumptions , the number of activity subcenters in urban areas scales sublinearly with their population where the prefactor and the exponent depend on the properties of the transportation network of the city under consideration .    </S>",

    "<S> we can discuss this result within the framework of our model in the following way . </S>",

    "<S> our model is thus consistent with the fact that the total traveled miles scales with population with a non - trivial exponent comprised in @xmath59 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> +        we now test the prediction given by eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : prediction ] ) . for that purpose , we collected data for the number of employees per zip code in the united states that were collected over a span of 16 years , between 1994 and 2010  @xcite , as well as the population of all cities in the us between 1994 and 2010  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate the number of subcenters by constructing the rank plot of the employment density @xmath60 ( number of employees per @xmath61 ) for each zip code of a given urban area  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these plots display a decay as fast as an exponential ( fig .  [ fig : rank_plots ] ) which implies that there exists a natural scale for the rank , that we interpret here as the typical number of activity centers . </S>",
    "<S> it also implies that any reasonable method should give an estimate of the number of subcenters of the same order of magnitude ( which would not be the case for slowly decaying functions such as power laws for example ) . </S>",
    "<S> we first note that for some cities typically large ones with stable populations ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : rank_plots ] , left) the employment spatial statistics remained stable over the period of study . </S>",
    "<S> for other cities , we observe large variation of the number of subcenters ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : rank_plots ] , right ) . </S>",
    "<S> we then plot ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : data ] ) the population @xmath26 of cities ( with population @xmath62 ) versus the estimated number of subcenters @xmath41 ( the dispersion in the scatter plot probably results from the fact that different cities have different resilience levels to congestion ) . on average , </S>",
    "<S> we observe a power law dependence with exponent @xmath63 ( the result is robust with regards to the estimate of @xmath41 , see the supplementary material  @xcite for more details ) . </S>",
    "<S> inverting this relation gives us the number of subcenters as a function of the population @xmath64 with @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> this result is strikingly in agreement with the prediction given by our model : the number of subcenters in a city scales sublinearly with its population . +     ( @xmath66 ) . </S>",
    "<S> see the supplementary material  @xcite for more details on the computation of @xmath41 and the robustness of the results . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : data],scaledwidth=50.0% ]    using the measured value of @xmath67 and eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : beta ] ) we can estimate the exponent of the scaling of @xmath68 with the population and find @xmath69 which agrees very well with the value @xmath70 measured in  @xcite directly on the data of the daily total miles driven in more than @xmath71 cities in the us . </S>",
    "<S> + while agglomeration economies seem to be the basic process explaining the existence of cities and their spectacular resilience , this study brings evidence that congestion is the driving force that tears them apart . </S>",
    "<S> the nontrivial spatial patterns observed in large cities can thus be understood as a result of the interplay between these competing processes . </S>",
    "<S> we believe that the present model represents an important step towards a quantitative , predictive science of cities . </S>",
    "<S> more generally , this microscopic approach is an interesting example of an out - of - equilibrium model : it is governed by local optimization with saturation effects , leads to different regimes , and is characterized by nontrivial dynamical exponents . in this respect , </S>",
    "<S> we believe that this discrete approach might be of use in the study of pattern formation in biology which has been so far explored from a global optimisation perspective  @xcite or used as a coarse - grained approach to reaction - diffusion equations with a density - dependent diffusion coefficient  @xcite to compute quantities that are out of reach within the current methods .    </S>",
