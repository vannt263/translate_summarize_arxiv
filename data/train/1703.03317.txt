    "<S> since phonon absorption is proportional to the bose distribution @xmath47 with the phonon mode @xmath48 and momentum @xmath49 , this feature is less pronounced than the emission peaks that are proportional to @xmath50 . note that the energetic position of these peaks does not exactly correspond to the phonon energy , since exciton thermalization sets in even before the exciton formation has been finalized . as a result , excitons relax to lower kinetic energies and scatter from there with phonons . </S>",
    "<S> the features characterizing the spectral distribution of the k - k exciton occupation can be explained in an analogous way .    </S>",
    "<S> after the characteristic phonon - induced formation time of approximately , thermalization of incoherent exciton occupations takes over and determines the dynamics of excitons . </S>",
    "<S> the generated hot k - k , k-@xmath1 , and k - k excitons scatter towards the energetically lowest states . </S>",

    "<S> remarkably , the reached steady state occupation of k - k excitons is negligibly small . in contrast </S>",
    "<S> , the k-@xmath1 excitons show the largest density followed by k - k excitons , where @xmath54 is more than three times larger than @xmath55 . at first sight , this is surprising , since the energy separation between the k - k and the k-@xmath1 excitons is only about @xmath56{mev}$ ] ( fig . </S>",

    "<S> however , it can be traced back to the fact that the @xmath1 point occurs three times in the brillouin zone , while there is only one @xmath2 point . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the k - k exciton occupation is interestingly not mainly driven by the decay of the coherent exciton occupation @xmath39 , but is rather formed indirectly through the exciton - phonon scattering with k@xmath1 excitons ( dashed line in fig . </S>",

    "<S> our calculations reveal that at room temperature , the same qualitative behavior can be observed , cf . appendix . at the elevated temperature </S>",
    "<S> , the higher occupation of @xmath3 and zone edge phonons leads to several additional features : first , the region for the formation of incoherent k - k excitons is larger reflecting the broader spectral width of the coherent exciton states . </S>",
    "<S> second , the relaxation to lower energetic states , driven mainly by phonon emission , becomes faster due to the @xmath58 dependence of the emission rates , which increase at enhanced phonon occupations . </S>",
    "<S> third , the thermalized exciton distribution becomes broader , which is consistent to expectations from a simple free bose gas , where the width of the bose distribution is given by the thermal energy @xmath59 .    </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the exciton dynamics in mose@xmath9 turns out to be qualitatively different , cf . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ valleys ] ( b ) ( and the appendix for the time- and energy - dependent dynamics of exciton occupations ) . here </S>",

    "<S> the steady state density of k-@xmath1 excitons is rather small , since these exciton states are only accessible with multiple phonon scattering events . </S>",

    "<S> the reason lies in the radiative decay of the coherent excitons that takes part at the same time as the formation of incoherent excitons and is therefore in direct competition with this process . at lower temperatures , </S>",
    "<S> the radiative recombination becomes the dominant channel drastically reducing the efficiency of the formation of incoherent excitons .     </S>",
    "<S> and ( b ) mose@xmath9 consists of a coherent ( dashed blue ) and an incoherent part ( dashed yellow ) . </S>",

    "<S> this is in line with the calculated exciton densities in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ valleys ] . </S>",
    "<S> the coherent part of the luminescence decays rapidly on a timescale of a few tens of femtoseconds . </S>",
    "<S> this excitonic coherence lifetime @xmath63 is determined by the radiative decay and phonon - induced dephasing of the excitonic polarization.@xcite it is reduced from approximately at to at . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to a stronger exciton - phonon scattering at higher temperatures.@xcite for comparison , fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ figpl ] ( b ) shows the luminescence in mose@xmath9 . here , we find a dominant coherent emission up to . </S>",
    "<S> the coherence lifetime is approximately at and decreases to at room temperature . </S>",
    "<S> this very short lifetime can be ascribed to the very efficient formation of incoherent k - k excitons via emission and absorption of acoustic and optical @xmath3 phonons.@xcite    the incoherent part of the photoluminescence decays on a much slower timescale of a few tens of nanoseconds and corresponds to the exciton lifetime @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> the reason for this slow decay is the complex interplay between radiative recombination and exciton - phonon scattering , cf . </S>",
    "<S> eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 4 ) in the appendix : first , phonon - driven thermalization of the incoherent exciton occupation @xmath38 takes place and is then followed by a radiative decay of incoherent excitons within the light cone @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> since now the incoherent excitons are not thermalized any more , exciton - phonon scattering again refills the empty states within the light cone . following this mechanism on longer timescales </S>",

    "<S> ]    now , we investigate the temperature dependence of the exciton lifetime @xmath64 and the photoluminescence yield for wse@xmath9 in direct comparison with mose@xmath9 , cf . </S>",

    "<S> [ figqy ] . </S>",
    "<S> we find an opposite temperature behavior for the two considered tmds : for mose@xmath9 ( wse@xmath9 ) , the @xmath64 time increases ( decreases ) with temperature ranging from ( ) at to ( ) at , cf . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ figqy](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the increased @xmath64 in mose@xmath9 can be traced back to the reduced exciton density within the light cone at elevated temperatures resulting in a less efficient radiative decay and thus a longer exciton lifetime . in the case of wse@xmath9 , </S>",
    "<S> the situation is different , since the energetically lowest states are dark . </S>",
    "<S> thus , higher temperatures are favorable for filling up the bright states within the light cone resulting in a faster radiative coupling and a shorter @xmath64 time . </S>",
    "<S> note that we focus here on intrinsic exciton properties in the low excitation regime neglecting non - radiative relaxation or defect - assisted exciton recombination channels . in many experimentally accessible situations </S>",
    "<S> , the relaxation of the exciton occupation will be much faster than the radiative recombination rates,@xcite and therefore the predicted intrinsic @xmath64 time has not been measured yet .    </S>",
    "<S> the yield of the luminescence is defined as the ratio of the time - integrated luminescence intensity to the amount of optically created excitons . </S>",
    "<S> assuming comparable non - radiative recombination channels for all excitons , we estimate the luminescence yield by the ratio between the density of bright excitons @xmath65 and all generated excitons @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> our calculations reveal that interestingly the yield in wse@xmath9 increases with temperature fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ figqy ] - in contrast to the behavior of conventional semiconductors . </S>",
    "<S> this can be directly attributed to the existence of energetically lower lying dark excitonic states in tungsten - based tmds.@xcite while at low temperatures , most excitons are located at the k-@xmath1 states ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ valleys](a ) ) , at enhanced temperatures more and more excitons are occupying the bright states within the light cone increasing the efficiency for photoemission . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , in mose@xmath9 , where bright states are the energetically lowest , the luminescence yield exhibits the temperature dependence expected from conventional materials , i.e. a decreased luminescence yield at higher temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> since the exciton distribution generally becomes broader at elevated temperatures , the occupation of the bright states becomes smaller reducing the luminescence yield . </S>",
    "<S> our findings are in excellent agreement with recent experimental studies.@xcite the observed opposite behavior of wse@xmath9 and mose@xmath9 is the remarkable consequence of an extraordinary exciton landscape in tmd materials .    in conclusion , we have presented a microscopic study revealing time- and energy - resolved formation and thermalization of bright and dark excitons in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides . exploiting the gained insights , we shed light on many - particle processes behind the photoluminescence in two representative tmd materials . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we demonstrate the presence of dark intervalley excitonic states that are located below optically accessible bright excitons in tungsten - based tmds . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to conventional semiconductors , these materials show an enhanced luminescence quantum yield and a reduced exciton lifetime at elevated temperatures . </S>"
