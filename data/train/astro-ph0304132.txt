    "faster - than - light or `` superluminal '' motion was originally predicted by @xcite and first observed by @xcite and @xcite in the powerful radio quasar 3c279 ( 1253@xmath7055 ; @xmath8 ) .",
    "the illusion of superluminal speed results from highly relativistic motion directed toward the observer , with the moving material chasing the radiation it emits , creating a compression in the time sequence of events as seen by the observer . in radio quasars , like 3c279 , a pair of highly collimated , relativistic plasma jets stream outward from the nucleus or core , and if one of these jets points within a small angle , @xmath9 , of our line of sight , then pattern motion with some intrinsic speed , @xmath10 , will appear to move across the sky with an apparent speed given by :    @xmath11    which can greatly exceed unity .",
    "the radio jet in 3c279 is a particularly interesting example with components moving along multiple position angles and apparent speeds .",
    "the motion of the original superluminal feature , as summarized by @xcite , who analyzed the six available epochs spanning the period 19701972 , was along a position angle of @xmath12 at @xmath13 mas / yr . for a modern cosmology of @xmath14kms@xmath15mpc@xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 ,",
    "this corresponds to @xmath18 .",
    "the vla observations of @xcite showed that knot c at @xmath2 had a position angle of @xmath19 in a nearly direct line with the superluminal motion detected on length scales fifty times smaller .",
    "the observational picture became less clear during the 1980s when @xcite tracked another superluminal component from 3c279 which they called `` c3 '' .",
    "component c3 was found to move along a different position angle of @xmath20 with a much smaller speed of only @xmath21 mas / yr corresponding to @xmath22 .    at the very end of 1984 , @xcite note the emergence of a new component they call c4 .",
    "component c4 is an extremely strong and compact feature which has been tracked up to the present by a number of programs .",
    "the most detailed and complete results to date were presented by @xcite .",
    "they followed c4 from 1991 to the end of 1997 with 22 ghz observations and from 1995 to 1997 at 43 ghz .",
    "they found the component to be moving along a position angle of @xmath23 with a speed of @xmath24 mas / yr which corresponds to @xmath25 times the speed of light in our choice of cosmology .",
    "they extrapolate an origin epoch for the component of @xmath26 , consistent with the first observation of c4 by @xcite .",
    "@xcite discuss a dip in speed of c4 around 1994 which coincides with small changes ( a few degrees ) of the trajectory on the sky . whether this small change in the motion is related to the large changes reported here",
    "is unclear ; however , the component had resumed its previous motion and trajectory by the end of 1995 .    here",
    "we present results from the very long baseline array ( vlba ) 2 cm survey ( * ? ? ?",
    "* http://www.cv.nrao.edu/2cmsurvey ) showing that after 1998 , the trajectory of c4 changes in both apparent speed and direction .",
    "the new trajectory for c4 is on an essentially parallel track to the 1970s superluminal component with essentially the same speed as originally observed for that component .",
    "our observations of 3c279 from the vlba 2 cm survey consist of 12 epochs spanning the interval from 1995.5 to 2002.9 ( for an animation see our project website referenced above ) .",
    "we have also incorporated 2 cm vlba results from the brandeis university parsec - scale jet monitoring project ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ojha et al . in prep . ) which adds six closely spaced epochs during 1996 and a seventh epoch at the end of 1997 .",
    "we measured component positions both in the image plane , by fitting point sources at the peak locations of the core and c4 , and in the @xmath27-plane by fitting 2 or 3 point components to the core region and a single elliptical gaussian to c4 .",
    "we have averaged the values obtained by these two approaches , and have plotted the mean position in figures [ f : pos ] and [ f : motion ] .",
    "the core is assumed to be stationary , and the positions of c4 are taken relative to the core .",
    "figure [ f : pos ] shows an image of 3c279 from our march 1997 observations .",
    "superimposed on this image is the position of component c4 from each of the 19 epochs we compiled .",
    "we have also plotted 22/43 ghz data from @xcite up to 1995.5 and 11 ghz data from @xcite to illustrate the trajectory of c4 from 1988 to the present .",
    "approximate positions for the 1970s superluminal component and the component c3 are included on the figure for comparison .",
    "proper motions were computed from the 2 cm @xmath28 compo-    nent positions in both the image and @xmath27 planes independently .",
    "the motions were computed over two different intervals , one prior to the change in trajectory and one after .",
    "we were unable to decide whether epoch 1998.2 should be classified with the motion prior to the change or after the change , but we found that it made little difference which choice we made .",
    "the average motions we found across all of these approaches were the following : _ prior to @xmath291998.2 _ : @xmath30 mas / yr ( @xmath31 @xmath32 ) along a position angle of @xmath33 , and _ after @xmath291998.2 _ : @xmath34 mas / yr ( @xmath35 @xmath32 ) along pa@xmath36 .",
    "these proper motions are plotted against the data in figure [ f : motion ] .",
    "we estimate our typical positional uncertainty for the centroid of c4 to be @xmath37 mas in both dimensions .",
    "figure [ f : flux ] depicts the change in component flux density ( panel ( a ) ) and size along the @xmath23 position angle ( panel ( b ) ) as a function of epoch .",
    "prior to the sharp change in motion sometime in 1998 , the component increases in flux density by @xmath38%    and decreases in size along the direction of motion by a factor of two .",
    "these events seem to come before the change in motion , suggesting the component is already undergoing changes , likely caused by interactions with its environment , while it is still propagating along the original direction of motion .",
    "@xcite report a change in the polarization position angle of c4 which occurred sometime between 1998.6 @xcite and 2000.1 .",
    "the polarization angle change reflects a change in magnetic field order , as faraday rotation is small in this feature @xcite , and provides further evidence that the change in trajectory is tied to internal changes in component structure .",
    "here we make a simple `` billiard - ball '' analysis of the component s trajectory .",
    "we note that more complicated models are possible , perhaps involving very different pattern and flow speeds , and such models may allow a wider range of allowed @xmath39 and @xmath9 .",
    "the apparent speed of this component has increased by more than @xmath38% and the trajectory on the sky has changed by @xmath4 . according to equation 1 ,",
    "the apparent speed can increase either due to an increase in the intrinsic speed , @xmath40 , or by a change in angle to the line of sight .",
    "we observe a large change in projected angle on the sky , therefore it is reasonable to assume that the angle to the line of sight has also changed .",
    "we can not rule out an increase in beta ; however , the simplest assumption consistent with our observations is that the speed of the component is constant along a bent path , and we make that assumption here .",
    "figure [ f : doppler ] plots the doppler factor , @xmath41 where    @xmath42 , versus the apparent motion , @xmath43 .",
    "lines of constant speed ( lorentz factor , @xmath39 ) and lines of constant angle are shown on the figure .",
    "@xmath44 is clearly too small and can not accommodate speeds greater than @xmath45 .",
    "the lines for @xmath46 or @xmath47 are more reasonable , and the change in apparent speed from @xmath48 to @xmath49 can be accommodated by either a small increase , @xmath50 , or a larger decrease , @xmath51 , in the angle of the motion with respect to the line of sight .    to decide between the two possibilities of increasing or decreasing @xmath9",
    ", we must look at the corresponding change in doppler factor which will scale the flux density of the jet component like @xmath52 , appropriate for a simple discrete component with a spectral index of @xmath53 . for a decreasing @xmath9 ( i.e. a trajectory bent towards the line of sight ) , the doppler factor more than doubles between @xmath48 and @xmath49 along the @xmath46 curve .",
    "this would predict an increase in flux density of the component of more than an order of magnitude ; however , from figure [ f : flux]a , it is clear that the flux density of the component changes by no more than a factor of two , and after 1998 the flux density only decreases .",
    "note that the observed compression in component size prior to the bend would be likely only to further increase the flux density , and therefore with some confidence we reject a decreasing angle to the line of sight . for increasing @xmath9 ( i.e.",
    "a trajectory bent away from the line of sight ) the situation is much better as the doppler factor decreases by approximately @xmath54% along the @xmath46 curve .",
    "this corresponds to a decrease in component flux density of a factor of two , somewhat more than we actually observe but not unreasonably so .    considering the complex nature of the light curve which",
    "is influenced not only by doppler beaming but also by the observed compression of the component prior to the bend and expansion after the bend , we do nt place strict limits here on how the doppler factor has decreased after the bend . while the @xmath46 curve seems to provide a reasonable lower bound on c4 s lorentz factor",
    ", we note that the lorentz factor could be much larger and still be consistent with our observations .    from this analysis assuming fixed component speed",
    ", we estimate @xmath0 with an initial angle to the line of sight of @xmath55 increasing at the bend to become @xmath56 .",
    "the bend in the plane of the sky appears to be @xmath4 ; however , deprojected , this bend is only @xmath57 , consistent with the required bend along the line of sight .",
    "in the above analysis , we have taken a very simple `` billiard - ball '' model of the motion of component c4 , where c4 undergoes a sudden change in trajectory sometime during 1998 . with a major axis size ( fwhm ) of @xmath58 ly ( 0.5 mas ) and a doppler factor @xmath59 , it is not unreasonable that c4 could have changed its trajectory in less than a year in our frame , and while this simple model fits our data quite well , a more detailed analysis of the trajectory is desirable",
    ". unfortunately we are limited in this by a lack of good sampling in the period 19982000 .",
    "an additional problem for more detailed analysis of the trajectory is that c4 is an extended region , and we are only tracking its centroid . in reality",
    ", c4 may be a complex shocked region with a strong leading edge and trailing shocks , and small changes in its centroid may not reflect true kinematical changes . in this light , we believe our simple approach is a conservative one that leads to a consistent picture of the jet kinematics .      from the angles and lorentz factors estimated above",
    ", we can derive approximate limits on the doppler beaming factor of this jet feature before and after the bend .",
    "we find @xmath5 prior to the change in trajectory and @xmath6 after the change .",
    "these values are consistent with @xcite , who use an inverse - compton calculation to estimate an average lower limit for the doppler factor of c4 , @xmath60 , prior to the change in direction .",
    "it is interesting to compare our values to the completely independent estimate of the doppler factor made by @xcite assuming equipartition between the radiating particles and magnetic field .",
    "they observed a spectral turnover at @xmath61 ghz for c4 in epoch 1997.94 , just before the change in trajectory described here .",
    "they used the spectrum and resolved angular size of c4 to calculate the doppler factor : @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the ratio of energy in the magnetic field to energy in the radiating particles : @xmath64 , and where @xmath65 is the fraction of the volume filled with radiating plasma . ] .",
    "agreement between these two independent determinations of the doppler factor of component c4 requires @xmath66 , implying that the energy in the radiating particles can not greatly exceed the energy in the magnetic field unless the volume filling factor is very much less than unity .",
    "we argue above that c4 was interacting with its environment prior to the change in trajectory , resulting in decreased angular size along the @xmath23 position angle and increased flux density .",
    "it seems likely , therefore , that c4 has been deflected onto its new trajectory .",
    "a random collision would be unlikely to deflect c4 in just the right fashion to have essentially the same speed _ and _ direction on the sky as the superluminal component detected in 1971 .",
    "it is important to stress that while the trajectory of c4 is _ parallel _ to that of the older component , c4 is not following the actual path of that component ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "the new trajectory for c4 not only has a very similar speed and direction as the 1970s superluminal feature , but it is also in the direction of the larger scale structure as seen in the 1.6 ghz vlba maps made by @xcite .",
    "we suggest that the change in trajectory is a collimation event resulting from the interaction of c4 with the boundary between the jet outflow and the interstellar medium .",
    "the exact nature of this boundary and interaction is unclear ; however , it is interesting to note that ( a ) the apparent collimation event occurred at a deprojected distance from the nucleus of @xmath3 kpc , and ( b ) the jet is still highly relativistic , with @xmath0 , on these scales .",
    "@xcite discuss a precessing jet model for 3c279 to explain the different apparent speeds and position angles of the vlbi components appearing prior to 1990 .",
    "@xcite confirm the presence of different apparent speeds and position angles in the jet , even in newer components originating after c4 , although their measurements do not agree with the extrapolated predictions of the abraham and carrara model .",
    "the concordance of the new speed for c4 with that of the 1970s component adds weight to the idea that jet components may all have intrinsically similar lorentz factors but slightly different angles of ejection . if some sort of precession model is used to interpret the data , wehrle et al .",
    "comment that it is difficult to understand how the range of ejection angles from @xmath23 to @xmath67 can be consistent with the narrow range of angles observed in the larger scale vlba and vla structure .",
    "perhaps we have seen the answer here in the form of jet collimation that occurs at @xmath68 kpc or more .",
    "we thank r. ojha , d. roberts , and j. wardle for sharing their monitoring data .",
    "j.  a.  z. was supported for this research through a max - planck research award .",
    "this research has made use of data from the university of michigan radio astronomy observatory , which is supported by the national science foundation and by funds from the university of michigan ."
