    "toric geometry is considered as a nice tool to study complex varieties used in physics including string theory and related models@xcite .",
    "the key point of this method is that the geometric properties of such manifolds are encoded in toric data placed on a polytope consisting of vertices linked by edges .",
    "the vertices satisfy toric constraint equations which have been explored to solve many string theory problems such as the absence of non abelian gauge symmetries in ten dimensional type ii superstring spectrums@xcite .",
    "moreover , toric geometry has been also used to build mirror manifolds providing an excellent way to understand the extension of t - duality in the presence of d - branes moving near toric calabi - yau singularities using combinatorial calculations @xcite .",
    "in particular , these manifolds have been used in the context of @xmath3 four dimensional quantum field theories in order to obtain exact results using local mirror symmetry@xcite .",
    "besides such applications , toric geometry has been also explored to understand a class of black hole solutions obtained from type ii superstrings on local calabi - yau manifolds @xcite .",
    "recently , the black hole physics has found a place in quantum information theory using qubit building blocks .",
    "more precisely , many connections have been established including the link with stu black holes as proposed in @xcite .    more recently , an extension to extremal black branes derived from the @xmath4 toroidal compactification of type iia superstring have been proposed in @xcite .",
    "concretely , it has been shown that the corresponding physics can be related to @xmath5 qubit systems via the real hodge diagram of such compact manifolds .",
    "the analysis has been adopted to @xmath6 supermanifolds by supplementing fermionic coordinates associated with the superqubit formalism and its relation to supersymmetric models .",
    "the aim of this paper is to contribute to this program by introducing colored toric geometry and its relation to adinkra graph theory to approach qubit information systems .",
    "an objective here is to connect three different subjects namely toric geometry , adinkras and quantum information theory .",
    "this link could be explored to deal with qubit systems using geometry considered as a powerful tool to understand modern physics . as an illustration , we examine lower dimensional qubit systems . in particular",
    ", we consider in some details the cases of one , two and three qubits , we find that they are linked with @xmath0 , @xmath7 and @xmath2 toric varieties respectively .",
    "using a geometric procedure referred to as colored toric geometry , we show that the qubit physics can be converted into a scenario working with toric data of such manifolds by help of adinkra graph theory .    the present paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 provides materials on how colored toric geometry may be used to discuss qubit information systems .",
    "the connection with adinkra graph theory is investigated in section 3 where focus is on an one to one correspondence between adinkras , colored toric geometry and qubit systems .",
    "operations on toric graphs are employed in section 4 when studying universal quantum gates .",
    "section 5 is devoted to some concluding remarks .",
    "before giving a colored toric realization of qubit systems , we present an overview on ordinary toric geometry .",
    "it has been realized that such a geometry is considered as a powerful tool to deal with complex calabi - yau manifolds used in the string theory compactification and related subjects@xcite .",
    "many examples have been elaborated in recent years producing non trivial geometries .    roughly speaking , @xmath5-complex dimensional toric manifold , which we denote as @xmath8 is obtained by considering the @xmath9-dimensional complex spaces @xmath10 parameterized by homogeneous coordinates @xmath11 and @xmath12 toric transformations @xmath13 acting on the @xmath14 s as follows @xmath15 here , @xmath16 s are @xmath12 non vanishing complex parameters .",
    "for each @xmath17 , @xmath18 are integers which called mori vectors encoding many geometrical information on the manifold and its applications to string theory physics .",
    "in fact , these toric manifolds can be identified with the coset space @xmath19 . in this way ,",
    "the nice feature is the toric graphic realization .",
    "concretely , this realization is generally represented by an integral polytope @xmath20 , namely a toric diagram , spanned by @xmath9 vertices @xmath21 of the standard lattice @xmath22 . the toric data @xmath23 should satisfy the following @xmath24 relations @xmath25 thus , these equations encode geometric data of @xmath26 . in connection with lower dimensional field theory ,",
    "it is worth noting that the @xmath18 integers are interpreted , in the @xmath27 gauged linear sigma model language , as the @xmath28 gauge charges of @xmath27 chiral multiples .",
    "moreover , they have also a nice geometric interpretation in terms of the intersections of complex curves @xmath29 and divisors @xmath30 of @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "this remarkable link has been explored in many places in physics . in particular , it has been used to build type iia local geometry .",
    "the simplest example in toric geometry , playing a primordial role in the building block of higher dimensional toric varieties , is @xmath32 .",
    "it is defined by @xmath33 and the mori vector charge takes the values @xmath34 .",
    "this geometry has an u(1 ) toric action @xmath0 acting as follows @xmath35 where @xmath36 , with two fixed points @xmath37 and @xmath38 placed on the real line .",
    "the latters describing the north and south poles respectively of such a geometry , considered as the ( real ) two - sphere @xmath39 , satisfy the following constraint toric equation @xmath40 in toric geometry language , @xmath0 is represented by a toric graph identified with an interval @xmath41 $ ] with a circle on top .",
    "the latter vanishes at the end points @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "this toric representation can be easily extended to the @xmath5-dimensional case using different ways .",
    "the natural one is the projective space @xmath42 . in this way",
    ", the @xmath43 circle fibration , of @xmath0 , will be replaced by @xmath44 fibration over an @xmath5-dimensional simplex ( regular polytope ) .",
    "in fact , the @xmath44 collapses to a @xmath45 on each of the @xmath5 faces of the simplex , and to a @xmath46 on each of the @xmath47-dimensional intersections of these faces , etc .",
    "the second way is to consider a class of toric varieties that we are interested in here given by a trivial product of one dimensional projective spaces @xmath0 s admitting a similar description .",
    "we will show later on that this class can be used to elaborate a graphic representation of quantum information systems using ideas inspired by adinkra graph theory and related issues [ 12 - 18 ] .",
    "for simplicity reason , we deal with the case of @xmath48 for higher dimensional geometries @xmath49 and their blow ups , the toric descriptions can be obtained using a similar way . in fact , they are @xmath5 dimensional toric manifolds exhibiting @xmath50 toric actions .",
    "a close inspection shows that there is a similarity between toric graphs of such manifolds and qubit systems using a link with adinkra graph theory . to make contact with quantum systems",
    ", we reconsider the study of toric geometry by implementing a new toric data associated with the color , producing a colored toric geometry . in this scenario ,",
    "the toric data @xmath23 will be replaced by @xmath51 where @xmath52 indicates the color of the edges linking the vertices .",
    "roughly speaking , the connection that we are after requires that the toric graph should consist of @xmath53 vertices and @xmath5 colors .",
    "in fact , consider a special class of toric manifolds associated with @xmath54 with @xmath50 toric actions exhibiting @xmath55 fixed points @xmath56 .",
    "in toric geometry langauge , the manifolds are represented by @xmath55 vertices @xmath56 belonging to the @xmath57 lattice satisfying @xmath5 toric equations .",
    "it is observed that these graphs share a strong resemblance with a particular class of adinkras formed by @xmath55 nodes connected with @xmath5 colored edges @xcite .",
    "these types of graphs are called regular ones which can be used to present graphically the @xmath5-qubit systems . at first sight ,",
    "the connection is not obvious .",
    "however , our main argument is based on the betti number calculations . in fact",
    ", these numbers @xmath58 appear in adinkras and the corresponding toric graphs . for @xmath59 ,",
    "it is easy to calculate such numbers .",
    "they are given by @xmath60 indeed , these numbers can be identified with @xmath61 data used in the @xmath62 classification of adinkras .",
    "inspired by combinatorial computations in quantum physics , we explore colored toric geometry to deal with qubit information systems [ 19 - 29 ] .",
    "concretely , we elaborate a toric description in terms of a trivial fibration of one dimensional projective space @xmath0 s . to start , it is recalled that the qubit is a two state system which can be realized , for instance , by a @xmath63 spin atom . the superposition state of a single qubit is generally given by the following dirac notation @xmath64 where @xmath65 are complex numbers satisfying the normalization condition @xmath66 it is remarked that this constraint can be interpreted geometrically in terms of the so called bloch sphere , identified with @xmath67 quotient lie group @xcite .",
    "the analysis can be extended to more than one qubit which has been used to discuss entangled states .",
    "in fact , the two qubits are four quantum level systems . using the usual notation @xmath68 ,",
    "the corresponding state superposition can be expressed as follows @xmath69 are complex numbers verifying the normalization condition @xmath70 describing the @xmath71 projective space . for @xmath5 qubits ,",
    "the general state has the following form @xmath72 where @xmath73 satisfy the normalization condition @xmath74 this condition defines the @xmath75 projective space generalizing the bloch sphere associated with @xmath76 .",
    "+ roughly , the qubit systems can be represented by colored toric diagrams having a strong resemblance with a particular class of bosonic adinkras , introduced in the study of supersymmetric representation theory , by gates and its group@xcite .",
    "in fact , there are many kinds of such graphs .",
    "however , we consider a particular class called regular one consisting of @xmath55 vertices linked by @xmath5 colored edges as will be shown latter on .",
    "an inspection , in graph theory of adinkras and toric varieties , shows that we can propose the following correspondence connecting three different subjects    .this table presents an one to one correspondence between colored toric geometry , adinkras and qubit systems . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab2 ]    to see how this works in practice , we first change the usual toric geometry notation . inspired by combinatorial formalism used in quantum information theory , the previous toric data can be rewritten as follows @xmath77 where the vertex subscripts indicate the corresponding quantum states . to illustrate this notation , we present a model associated with @xmath7 toric variety .",
    "this model is related to @xmath62 adinkras with ( 1,2,1 ) data as listed in the classification . in this case",
    ", the combinatorial mori vectors can take the following form @xmath78 the manifold corresponds to the toric equations @xmath79    in colored toric geometry langauge , it is represented by @xmath80 vertices @xmath81 , belonging to @xmath82 , linked by four edges with two different colors @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "the toric data require the following vertices @xmath85 with two colors .",
    "these data can be encoded in a toric graph describing two qubits and it is illustrated in figure 1 .     qubits . ]     +",
    "having examined the qubit object , we move now to build the quantum gates using colored toric geometry and adinkra graph theory .",
    "the general study is beyond of the scope of this paper .",
    "we consider , however , lower dimensional cases .",
    "to do so , it is recalled that the classical gates can be obtained by combining boolean operations as and , or , xor , not and nand .",
    "in fact , these operations act on input classical bits , taking two values 0 and 1 , to produce new bits as output results . in quantum computation , gates are unitary operators in a @xmath55 dimensional hilbert space . in connection with representation theory , they can be represented by @xmath86 matrix , belonging to @xmath87 lie group , satisfying the following properties @xmath88 as in the classical case , there is an universal notation for the gates depending on the input qubit number .",
    "the latters are considered as building blocks for constructing circuits and transistors . for 1-qubit computation , the usual one",
    "is called not acting on the basis state as follows latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned }    geometry language , this operation corresponds to permuting the two toric vertices of @xmath0 @xmath90 this operation can be represented by the following matrix @xmath91 which can be identified with @xmath92 defining the not quantum gate . in this case",
    ", it is worth noting that the corresponding color operation is trivial since we have only one .",
    "+ for 2-qubits , there are many universal gates . as mentioned previously , this system is associated with the toric geometry of @xmath93 unlike the 1-qubit case corresponding to @xmath7 , the quantum systems involve two different data namely the vertices and colors . based on this observation , such data will produce two kinds of operations :    1 .",
    "color actions 2 .",
    "vertex actions .",
    "in fact , these operations can produce cnot and swap gates . to get such gates",
    ", we fix the color action according to adinkra orders used in the corresponding notation . following the colored toric realization of the 2-qubits ,",
    "the color actions can be formulated as follows @xmath94 in this color language , the cnot gate @xmath95 can be obtained by using the following actions @xmath96 a close inspection shows that the swap gate @xmath97 can be derived from the following permutation action @xmath98 we expect that this analysis can be adopted to higher dimensional toric manifolds . for simplicity reason , we consider the geometry associated with toffoli gate being an universal gate acting on a 3-qubit .",
    "it is remarked that geometry can be identified with the blow up of @xmath99 toric manifold . in colored toric geometry language ,",
    "this manifold is described by the following equations @xmath100 where @xmath101 vertices @xmath102 belong to @xmath103 .",
    "they are connected by three different colors @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath104 .",
    "these combinatorial equations can be solved by the following mori vectors @xmath105 thus , the corresponding vertices @xmath102 are given by @xmath106 and they are connected with three colors .",
