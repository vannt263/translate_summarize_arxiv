    "the hierarchy problem between weak and planck scales could be explained by introducing the extra dimensions .",
    "one of the possibility is to pull down the planck scale to tev range by considering the compactified extra dimensions of large size @xcite .",
    "the assumption that the extra dimensions are at the order of submilimeter distance , for two extra dimensions , the hierarchy problem in the fundamental scales could be solved and the true scale of quantum gravity would be no more the planck scale but it is of the order of electroweak ( ew ) scale .",
    "this is the case that the gravity spreads over all the volume including the extra dimensions , however , the matter fields are restricted in four dimensions , so called four dimensional ( 4d ) brane .",
    "another possibility , which is based on the non - factorizable geometry , is introduced by randall and sundrum @xcite ( the rs1 model ) and , in this scenario , the extra dimension is compactified to @xmath6 orbifold with two 4d brane boundaries . here , the gravity is localized in one of the boundary , so called the planck ( hidden ) brane , which is away from another boundary , the tev ( visible ) brane where we live .",
    "the size of extra dimension is related to the vacuum expectation of a scalar field and its fluctuation over the expectation value is called the radion field ( see section 2 for details ) .",
    "the radion in the rs1 model has been studied in several works in the literature @xcite-@xcite ( see @xcite for extensive discussion ) .    in the present work",
    ", we study the possible lepton flavor violating ( lfv ) decays of the radion field @xmath7 .",
    "the lfv interactions exist at least in one loop level in the extended standard model ( sm ) , so called @xmath8sm , which is constructed by taking neutrinos massive and by permitting the lepton mixing mechanism @xcite .",
    "their negligibly small branching ratios ( brs ) stimulate one to go beyond and they are worthwhile to examine since they open a window to test new models and to ensure considerable information about the restrictions of the free parameters , with the help of the possible accurate measurements .",
    "the lfv interactions are carried by the flavor changing neutral currents ( fcncs ) and in the sm with extended higgs sector ( the multi higgs doublet model ) they can exist at tree level . among multi higgs doublet models ,",
    "the two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) is a candidate for the lepton flavor violation . in this model ,",
    "the lepton flavor violation is driven by the new scalar higgs bosons @xmath9 , scalar @xmath10 and pseudo scalar @xmath11 , and it is controlled by the yukawa couplings appearing in lepton - lepton - s vertices .    here , we predict the brs of the lfv @xmath7 decays in the 2hdm , in the framework of the rs1 scenario .",
    "the br reaches to the numerical values of the order of @xmath12 for the small values of the radion mass , @xmath13 . in the case of light flavor output",
    "@xmath14 the numerical value of the br is of the order of @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) for @xmath13 ( see @xcite for the explicit expressions of these decay widths ) . ]",
    "the brs of these processes are sensitive to the new yukawa couplings arising with the addition of the new higgs doublet and they enhance with the increasing values of the these couplings .",
    "therefore , besides their important role in the construction of the fcnc in the tree level and the existence of the lfv interactions , these yukawa couplings play a crucial role in the enhancement of the theoretical values of the brs . in our calculations , we observe that the brs of the processes we study are at most of the order of @xmath3 , for the small values of radion mass @xmath4 and for the large values of the yukawa couplings , and , their sensitivities to @xmath4 decrease with the increasing values of @xmath4 . among the lfv decays we study , the @xmath5 decay would be the most suitable one to measure its br .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we present the effective vertex and the brs of lfv @xmath7 decays in the 2hdm , by respecting the rs1 scenario .",
    "section 3 is devoted to a discussion and to our conclusions . in the appendix",

    "the sm fields are assumed to live on one of the brane , so called the tev brane . on the other hand , the gravity peaks near the other brane , so called the planck brane and extends into the bulk with varying strength . here , 5d cosmological constant is non vanishing and both branes have equal and opposite tensions so that the low energy effective theory has flat 4d spacetime .",

    "furthermore , the strengths of the couplings of kk mode leptons and new higgs bosons are regulated by the locations of the lepton fields . in the second possibility , the flavor violation is carried by the new yukawa couplings in four dimensions by assuming that the localization effects are embedded into the definition of new yukawa couplings and , with the additional effects coming from the kk mode leptons , the role of extra dimension becomes the enhancement in the physical quantities . in both scenarios ,",
