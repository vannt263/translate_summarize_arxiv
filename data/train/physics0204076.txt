    "a violation of the combined symmetry of charge conjugation ( c ) and parity ( p ) has been discovered in the decay of the @xmath3 meson about 40 years ago @xcite .",
    "the exact origin of this symmetry violation remains an enigma , although the standard model of electroweak interactions can describe these processes phenomenologically .",
    "it has also been proposed by sakharov @xcite that the matter - antimatter asymmetry observed in our universe could have arisen from a cp - violating interaction active at an early stage of the big bang .",
    "the cp - violation implies a time - reversal ( t ) asymmetry and hence violation of the combined tp - symmetry , because there are strong reasons to believe that the combined cpt - symmetry should not be violated @xcite .",
    "an electric dipole moment ( edm ) of a system in a stationary quantum state indicates a violation of the tp - symmetry ; this is why searches for edms of elementary particles , atoms and molecules are a very important approach to the studies of violations of fundamental symmetries @xcite . in the present work we concentrate on the edm of the electron @xmath4 .    at present",
    "the best limitation on @xmath4 comes from the berkeley experiment with an atomic thallium beam @xcite , @xmath5 .",
    "there are some ideas for improving the sensitivity .",
    "one way of improvement is an experiment with metastable levels of pbo molecules @xcite .",
    "a breakthrough could be achieved in solid state experiments .",
    "this idea was suggested by shapiro in 1968 @xcite .",
    "the application of strong electric fields to electrons bound within a solid would align the electric dipole moments of these electrons .",
    "this should lead to a simultaneous alignment of the electron spins ; the magnetic field arising from this alignment could be detected experimentally .",
    "an experiment of this kind has been performed with nickel - zinc ferrite @xcite . however , due to experimental limitations , the result was not very impressive .",
    "interest to the approach has been renewed recently due to suggestions of lamoreaux @xcite and hunter @xcite to perform similar experiments with gadolinium gallium garnet , gd@xmath6ga@xmath7o@xmath8 , and gadolinium iron garnet , gd@xmath6fe@xmath7o@xmath8 , employing new experimental techniques .",
    "first estimates of sensitivity promise to improve the current upper limit on the electron edm by at least three orders of magnitude , depending on the experimental setup .",
    "a thorough analysis of the problem requires the calculation of the enhancement coefficient for the electron edm in the gd@xmath0 ion .",
    "we perform this calculation in the present work .",
    "the gd@xmath0 ion has a nucleus with charge @xmath9 and 61 electrons .",
    "the 7 electrons in the outer shell occupy the @xmath10 orbitals .",
    "so the shell is half filled , and hence the total orbital angular momentum is zero , @xmath11 , and total spin @xmath12 .",
    "let us consider the state with maximum z - projection of the spin . in the representation of second quantization",
    "the ground state wave function is of the form @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the creation operator for a @xmath10 electron with spin @xmath15 and z - projection of orbital angular momentum @xmath16 .",
    "the tp - odd interaction of the electron edm with the electric field @xmath17 is of the form , see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are dirac @xmath21-matrices .",
    "because of schiff s theorem @xcite it is crucially important to account for very complex many - body screening effects , when working with the hamiltonian ( [ vd ] ) ; technically this means that the many - body perturbation theory practically is not convergent .",
    "the standard way @xcite to avoid this complication is to split the hamiltonian into two terms : @xmath22 .",
    "then due to schiff s theorem @xcite the contribution of the first term to the edm of the ion is identically zero , so one can reduce the interaction @xmath23 perturbation theory with this operator is reasonably convergent .    in leading order of single particle perturbation theory the edm of the ion @xmath24",
    "is given by diagrams shown in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "the corresponding formula reads @xmath25 where the edm enhancement coefficient is given by @xmath26 here @xmath27 is the electron charge and @xmath28 is the bohr radius .",
    "we first consider @xmath29 and @xmath30 intermediate states , as the contribution of other states is much less .",
    "the e1 matrix elements are of the form @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the e1-transition radial integral expressed in atomic units ( bohr radius ) , @xmath33 @xmath34 is the radial wave function of the corresponding orbital , @xmath35 .    the matrix element of @xmath36 has been calculated earlier , see e.g. ref.@xcite . in jj coupling scheme , and using a semiclassical approximation , it reads @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the fine structure constant , @xmath39 , @xmath40 is the atomic energy unit , @xmath41 is the effective charge for electron motion at large distances , and finally the effective principal quantum numbers @xmath42 and @xmath43 are defined by the electron energy with respect to the ionization limit , @xmath44 .",
    "our numerical calculations in hartree - fock approximation agree with the semiclassical result ( [ vv ] ) within ten per cent .",
    "the ground state wave function ( [ 0 ] ) is given in ls coupling scheme , therefore we have to rewrite the operator @xmath36 in this representation .",
    "a simple calculation gives @xmath45 combining equations ( [ k]),([e1]),([vv ] ) , and ( [ ls ] ) and performing the summation over @xmath46 , we find the following expression for the single particle contribution to the enhancement coefficient @xmath47 note that from here on we skip the atomic energy unit @xmath48 in all equations , assuming that all energies are expressed in units of @xmath48 . to find values of the parameters that appear in this equation , we have performed a hartree - fock calculation for the gd@xmath0 ion . it is known that a hartree - fock calculation for an open shell is not a uniquely defined procedure . in our calculation we used the following averaging : we assumed that the shell is fully occupied , but the occupation number of each single particle @xmath49-orbital is 1/2 .",
    "this is a crude approximation , it gives reasonable values of energy levels and radial integrals , but one can not rely on this calculation as far as energy splittings are concerned . as a result of the calculation we obtained the following values of energies and radial integrals : @xmath50 where available , experimental data should be used , but unfortunately the experimental data on this particular ion is scarce .",
    "only the value of the @xmath10 energy level ( ionization limit ) is known , see ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath51 it agrees well with ( [ hf ] ) . from ( [ exp ] ) and ( [ hf ] ) one finds @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 .    the most important is the @xmath55 energy splitting . the accuracy of the present hartree - fock calculation is not sufficient to determine this splitting .",
    "there is reliable experimental data for the energy levels of gd@xmath56 , gd@xmath57 , and eu@xmath56 , see ref.@xcite .",
    "naive extrapolation of the splitting from these ions gives @xmath58 on the other hand there is experimental data for gd@xmath0 @xcite that indicates @xmath59 unfortunately ref.@xcite does not contain identifications of all the possible levels , therefore we can not quite rely on the data . for this reason we will present two estimates of @xmath1 : one for the case ( a ) , see",
    "( [ a ] ) , and another for the case ( b ) , see ( [ b ] )",
    ". experimental and/or theoretical determination of the @xmath60 splitting would be the most important to improve the accuracy of the calculation of the enhancement coefficient @xmath1 .    substituting values of the parameters listed above into eq .",
    "( [ ksp ] ) we find the contribution of the @xmath29 intermediate state to the edm enhancement coefficient : @xmath61 the contribution of the @xmath30 intermediate state is very small .",
    "we also estimate the contribution of the higher @xmath62-levels ( mainly the continuous spectrum ) as @xmath63 altogether this gives the following value of the single particle contribution to the edm enhancement coefficient @xmath64",
    "in the situation with cesium or any other atom with valent @xmath65- or @xmath66-electrons @xcite the single particle estimate is satisfactory .",
    "however here we have @xmath49-electrons that have a very small wave function in the vicinity of the nucleus . as a result",
    "the single particle contribution is strongly suppressed .",
    "technically this suppression is reflected in eq .",
    "( [ vv ] ) ; the matrix element is proportional to @xmath67 , and for @xmath68-electrons @xmath69 , while for @xmath70- or @xmath71-electrons @xmath72 .",
    "therefore it is very important to estimate the many - body corrections .",
    "the leading many - body corrections to the edm enhancement coefficient @xmath73 are shown in diagrams fig.[fig2 ] , where the wavy line denotes residual coulomb interaction @xmath74 we only account for diagrams with momentum of the coulomb quantum @xmath75 not higher than 2 .",
    "the contribution of each diagram from fig.[fig2 ] must be doubled , because an opposite order of operators is also possible .",
    "the formula for the many - body contribution to the enhancement coefficient due to the diagrams in fig.[fig2 ] reads @xmath76 we have only included @xmath77 matrix elements of @xmath36 and only the intermediate states involving @xmath29 electrons which give the main contribution .",
    "all the diagrams in fig.[fig2 ] are exchange ones , this is why the sign in eq.([kmb ] ) is negative .",
    "matrix elements of the coulomb interactions are of the form @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the usual coulomb radial integral , @xmath80 expressed in atomic units .    using matrix elements",
    "( [ e1 ] ) , ( [ vv ] ) and ( [ e2 ] ) , and performing the summation over @xmath46 in ( [ kmb ] ) , we obtain the following expression for the leading many - body correction to the enhancement coefficient @xmath81 like the parameters presented in ( [ hf ] ) the energy levels and radial integrals in this formula have been calculated using a hartree - fock method @xmath82 the corresponding effective principal quantum numbers are @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 . using the @xmath87 energy splitting given in ( [ a ] ) and ( [ b ] ) and substituting all the parameters into eq .",
    "( [ kmb1 ] ) , we find the many - body correction due to the @xmath88- , @xmath89- , and @xmath29- intermediate states , see fig.2 @xmath90 one should also perform the summation over higher @xmath65- , @xmath66- , and @xmath62- intermediate states .",
    "we estimate this contribution as @xmath91 combining ( [ kmb2 ] ) and ( [ kmb3 ] ) one finds the leading many - body correction to the enhancement coefficient @xmath92 it is substantially smaller than the single particle contribution ( [ ksp3 ] ) , so the many - body perturbation theory is convergent .",
    "the final result for the electron edm enhancement coefficient , @xmath93 , reads @xmath94 we recall that the case a corresponds to the energy splitting ( [ a ] ) , and the case b corresponds to ( [ b ] ) .",
    "we have calculated the electron edm enhancement coefficient in the gd@xmath0 ion . the single particle contribution as well as the leading many - body corrections",
    "have been taken into account .",
    "the result is @xmath95 .",
    "the main reason for such a large uncertainty lies in the unknown energy splitting @xmath55 .",
    "experimental and/or theoretical determination of the splitting in gd@xmath0 would be the most important step for improving the accuracy of the enhancement coefficient calculation .",
