    "quantum compass models are spin models in which the nearest - neighbour exchange coupling has the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 depends on the direction of the particular link or bond .",
    "this then implies a coupling between the spin space and the physical space of the lattice .",
    "such models were first introduced , and have been regularly employed , to describe orbital ordering in various transition metal compounds ( @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "such models also have applicability to models of @xmath2 superconducting arrays @xcite and it has been argued @xcite that such arrays can provide fault - tolerant qubits for quantum information systems .",
    "compass models can be defined in various ways , depending on the underlying lattice .",
    "exact solutions have been obtained for a 1-dimensional alternating ( xx),(zz ) model @xcite and for a 2-leg ladder @xcite .",
    "a remarkable solution has also been found for the honeycomb lattice with ( xx ) , ( yy ) and ( zz ) couplings along the three independent lattice directions @xcite . as far as we are aware , no other exact solutions exist .    in the present paper",
    "we consider the spin-1/2 quantum compass model on the simple cubic lattice , with hamiltonian @xmath3 where the @xmath4 are pauli operators , and the sums are , respectively , over lattice bonds along the x , y , z directions .",
    "we will also consider the square lattice version , where the last term in ( [ eq1 ] ) is omitted .",
    "as is well known @xcite , this model possesses a number of unusual gauge - like symmetries . as a consequence each energy state has a macroscopic degeneracy and , consequently , there is no conventionally ordered magnetic phase at any temperature .",
    "however it has been pointed out that a state of orientational or ` nematic ' order is possible , in which the nearest neighbour bonds of lowest energy lie predominantly along a specific lattice direction . in the isotropic case of equal interactions",
    "@xmath5 this represents a spontaneous symmetry breaking . consequently there may be a critical point at a temperature @xmath6 , above which the system is disordered , with no preferred direction",
    "recent quantum monte carlo studies of the isotropic 2-dimensional model @xcite have found strong evidence for a finite temperature critical point with @xmath7 ( in our units ) with a critical exponent @xmath8 , consistent with 2d ising behaviour .",
    "the same authors @xcite also identified a transition in the corresponding classical model , but we do not consider the classical case in the present work . as far as we are aware ,",
    "no investigation of the occurrence of such a critical point , or its value , has been reported in the 3-dimensional case .",
    "the goal of the present work is to attempt to answer this question .",
    "we employ the method of high - temperature series expansions , which has proven successful in the past @xcite in obtaining accurate values for critical temperatures and exponents in a wide variety of classical and quantum models .",
    "the basic idea is to expand the boltzmann factor @xmath9 in the partition function in powers of @xmath10 @xmath11 the coefficients in this series can be evaluated in a number of ( related ) ways .",
    "we use a linked cluster approach @xcite in which @xmath12 is evaluated , as a series in @xmath13 , on a sequence of finite connected clusters of increasing size , and the cluster contributions are combined appropriately to give the bulk free energy in the form @xmath14 with the @xmath15 being multinomial expressions of degree @xmath16 in the j s . from this one can immediately obtain a corresponding series for the specific heat",
    ".    however the specific heat has , in most cases , only a weak singularity and is not well suited to estimation of critical properties .",
    "including an external field which couples to the order parameter @xmath17 , @xmath18 where we now write the original hamiltonian ( [ eq1 ] ) as @xmath19 , allows calculation of a high temperature series for a generalized ` susceptibility ' @xmath20 the order parameter @xmath17 was introduced @xcite for the 2-dimensional model as @xmath21 i.e. the difference between the energy of the @xmath22 and @xmath23 bonds .",
    "we generalize this for the 3-dimensional model to @xmath24    normally the calculation of the susceptibility would be somewhat involved , since @xmath19 and @xmath17 do not commute .",
    "however , in the present model , we can simply combine the two terms into a hamiltonian of the original form ( [ eq1 ] ) , with @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and use the expression in ( [ eq3 ] ) to obtain @xmath28 where the @xmath29 are again multinomials of degree @xmath16 in the j s .",
    "the susceptibility series is expected to show a strong divergence at the critical point and hence should be more amenable to analysis .",
    "another quantity which is expected to show a strong divergence is the fluctuation in the order parameter @xmath30 for the classical model this quantity is identical to @xmath31 , but this is not the case for the quantum model .    in the following sections we will present the series and our analysis for the 2-d case ( section [ sec2 ] ) and 3-d case ( section [ sec3 ] ) .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in section [ sec4 ] .",
    "to test the effectiveness of the high - temperature series approach for the present model , we first investigate the square lattice case , where previous results exist @xcite .",
    "we use a linked cluster method @xcite based on connected clusters ( ` graphs ' ) , to obtain a series for @xmath32 correct to order @xmath33 , as we have done , requires the enumeration of clusters with up to 12 bonds .",
    "it is a special feature of this model that each bond must be used an even number of times to give a nonzero trace .",
    "there are 4423 topologically distinct clusters with 12 or fewer bonds , embeddable on the square lattice .",
    "this gives rise to 751663 distinct graphs with 2 bond types ( @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) .",
    "however the vast majority of these do not contribute , and the final irreducible list of contributing graphs numbers 60127 .",
    "we give below the leading terms in the partition function series    @xmath34    where @xmath35 .",
    "note that only even powers of @xmath13 occur .",
    "this is a feature of all series for this model .    from this result",
    "we can obtain the susceptibility @xmath36    .series coefficients for the isotropic 2d compass model [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab3 ]    as for the 2d case , the series are dominated by singularities on the negative @xmath37 axis .",
    "however , in contrast to the 2d case , euler transformations yield no indication of any singularity for real positive @xmath37 , and thus no indication of a physical critical point .    to test this",
    "further we have employed the same strategy as in the previous section , by evaluating @xmath31 itself at high temperatures , where pad ' e approximants to the series are well converged , and plotting @xmath38 versus @xmath39 .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "( circles ) and @xmath38 ( squares ) as functions of temperature @xmath39 for the 3d quantum compass model ( j=1 ) . ]",
    "we note that the @xmath40 points are monotonically increasing , unlike the results for the 2d case - figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "this indicates that @xmath31 is increasing less rapidly than @xmath41 .",
    "the @xmath42 values do not indicate a transition at any finite @xmath39 but , within the numerical uncertainties , are consistent with a transition at @xmath43 .",
    "the question of the existence of a thermodynamic phase transition in the quantum compass model on various lattices is of fundamental importance .",
    "the series indicate that the analytic structure of thermodynamic functions for these models is dominated by singularities on the imaginary @xmath13 axis ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "this is perhaps a reflection of the peculiar ` 1-dimensional ' nature of the couplings in the model .",
    "our results for the square lattice are consistent with , albeit less precise than , recent monte carlo results @xcite .",
    "this demonstrates that the high - t series method does in fact work .",
    "however for the cubic lattice we find no signature of a critical point at finite @xmath39 , and conjecture that there is no such critical point . at first glance",
    "this appears surprising , since the normal expectation is that the ordered phase will be more robust , and hence @xmath6 will increase , with increasing dimension . in the case of a simple antiferromagnet ,",
    "for instance , the bond interactions in different directions can be satisfied simultaneously , and reinforce each other , so that the tendency to order increases with higher dimension . in the present case ,",
    "however , the bond interactions in different directions pull different ways , and compete with each other , so that the tendency to order decreases with higher dimensions . in one dimension ,",
    "the nematic order parameter is non - zero at all finite temperatures ; in two dimensions @xmath45 is only non - zero at low temperatures ; and in three dimensions it appears that @xmath46 is actually zero at all finite temperatures .",
    "it has also been pointed out @xcite that in this model thermal fluctuations in fact become larger with increasing dimension .    the series have proved difficult to analyze , because of the complex singularities , and gave rather poor estimates of the critical parameters in two dimensions .",
    "a closer investigation of the nature of these singularities may lead to more precise estimates of the critical parameters ; or else higher - order series coefficients might be necessary .",
    "it is worth noting that the model has also proved difficult to analyze using finite- size scaling and monte carlo methods .",
    "an early monte carlo calculation @xcite on lattices of up to 20 x 20 sites with periodic boundary conditions also gave a critical point about 36% too high .",
    "@xcite showed that the use of special ` screw periodic ' boundary conditions on lattices up to 42 x 42 was required to produce the estimates quoted earlier .",
