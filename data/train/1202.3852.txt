    "we find that this perturbing mass has to be @xmath102 ( 68% cl ) . getting _",
    "imaging data would significantly improve the accuracy of the decomposition and the constraints on @xmath103 .",
    "the einstein radius estimate is robust with respect to the inclusion ( or not ) of the perturbing potential .",
    "* sl2sj221326@xmath42000946 is an edge - on disk galaxy in which both the potential and the light distribution are highly elongated : @xmath104 and @xmath105 with a small @xmath106 misalignment .",
    "* sl2sj221407@xmath42180712 does not exhibit any counterimage nor a strong curvature of the main outer image .",
    "this implies that the model can not be constrained well and we can only place upper limits on the einstein radius @xmath107 .",
    "the results on the potential elongation and orientation are thus very loose and we do not consider this system in the statistical analysis of section  [ sec : defstat ] . note that the small upper limit on @xmath50 is consistent with other mass constraints in paper ii .",
    "* sl2sj221606@xmath42175131 has a relatively symmetric configuration .",
    "its similarity to a classic quad configuration lead us to include it in the lens candidate sample .",
    "however , we could not find any sensible lens model able to reproduce in detail the image configuration .",
    "therefore we can not conclude that this system is a lens , or more precisely , that the blue features about 1@xmath108 from the center of the etg originate from a unique background source .",
    "we speculate that it could be due to low surface brightness star formation at the etg s redshift .",
    "we thus exclude this system from the statistical analysis below , although better imaging data would be useful to revisit this system by constructing more complex models of the source and potential .",
    "* sl2sj221929@xmath42001743 does not have _ hst _ imaging and the cfht data do not allow us to constraint tightly the potential parameters as we can not identify unambiguously a counterimage .",
    "in addition , the arc does not display a strong curvature at the resolution of ground - based imaging .",
    "we thus get weaker constraints on the einstein radius @xmath109 than for other systems .",
    "_ hst _ imaging would significantly improve the mass model .",
    "given the redshift of the source @xmath110 , we infer a source half - light radius @xmath111 and a @xmath7 band intrinsic magnitude @xmath112 .",
    "the top panel of figure  [ fig : dpa ] compares the ellipticity of the stellar component to that of the mass model . for the vast majority of the objects",
    "the ellipticities are tightly correlated .",
    "this is expected since stellar mass makes up a significant fraction of the total mass within the einstein radius .",
    "however , there are few interesting outliers .",
    "the flattened light distribution of sl2sj022648@xmath42040610 is consistent with a disky galaxy living in significantly rounder halo .",
    "perhaps more surprising are the cases of sl2sj021411@xmath42040502 and sl2sj220629 + 005728 , where the stars are almost round , while the potential is significantly flattened . in both cases",
    "the source of the ellipticity of the mass distribution seems to be external shear , associated with a satellite . in general , the relation between light and mass ellipticity seems to have significantly more scatter than that found for the slacs sample , @xmath113 with scatter 0.48 , as opposed to 0.99 with scatter 0.11 @xcite .",
    "as we discuss in the next paragraph this is probably due to a much more significant role played by external shear .",
    "top panel : correlation between axis ratio of the light and of the mass distribution .",
    "bottom panel : angular offset between the major axis of the mass distribution and that of the light as a function of axis ratio of the mass distribution .",
    "sl2sj021737@xmath42051329 is not included because this system was modeled including external shear . ]",
    "the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : dpa ] shows the angular offset between light and mass p.a . as a function of mass ellipticity . even neglecting the points with @xmath114 , where clearly the position angle is not very well measured since the potential is so circular ,",
    "there is considerable scatter around zero . for the entire sample",
    "the rms scatter is 25 deg , while if we limit ourselves to @xmath115 the scatter is still 18 deg .",
    "again this is considerable higher than the 10 deg found for the slacs sample @xcite in general , and closer to the values found for the subset of slacs lenses that reside in overdense environments @xcite .",
    "a simple calculation , based on equation  ( 22 ) in the paper by @xcite and assuming that the direction of external shear is randomly distributed with respect to that of the mass of the galaxies shows that this is consistent with a relatively large average external shear .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig : gext ] where we show the expected rms fluctuation of the position angles as a function of average external shear .",
    "regardless of whether the rounder objects are included or not , it seems that external shear @xmath116 is required on average .",
    "the mean and error on this quantity are estimated by propagating the sampling variance associated with the measurement of the @xmath9 rms dispersion in the light - mass misalignment angle .",
    "the small sample size prevents us from further estimations like the scatter about this mean value which , in turn , will be addressed in a forthcoming paper ( sonnenfeld et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "this level of external shear is fairly common among galaxy - scale gravitational lenses ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and it is likely due to the environment of the lenses @xcite , since massive etgs typically reside at the centers of groups",
    ". the lower level of external shear in the slacs sample , @xmath117 @xcite , is most likely due to the smaller size of their einstein radius relative to the characteristic scale of the galaxy ( half effective radius typically ) , and therefore the more relevant role played by stellar mass in defining the potential within the critical curve .",
    "it is also possible that part of the observed misalignments between the light and the gravitational potential might arising from intrinsic misalignments between the galaxy and its halo .",
    "this is also expected to be a larger effect in sl2s than in slacs , owing to the larger size of the einstein radius relative to the effective radius .",
    "we will explore this issue further in future papers of this series with a larger sample and better data .",
    "finally , we also note that , despite the likely greater influence of the environment relative to slacs , the sl2s lenses do not require as large a quadrupolar term as class radio source or quasars @xcite",
    ". this might be due to the fact that extended sources are not as sensitive to the magnification bias that would boost the fraction of highly magnified quads . in turn , the only unambiguous quad systems here are j141137 + 565119 and j021737@xmath42051329 .",
    "two out of 16 lenses ( excluding j221606@xmath42175131 ) are quads .",
    "the curves represent the expected rms fluctuations of the offset in p.a . as a function of average external shear .",
    "the horizontal lines represent the values measured for the sl2s sample .",
    "the solid lines refer to the whole sample , while the dashed lines refer to the subsample with mass axis ratio @xmath118 . ]",
    "in this paper we presented gravitational lens models of a pilot sample of 16 galaxy - scale lenses identified as part of the sl2s survey .",
    "_ hst _ imaging is available for 10/16 systems , while for the others the modeling is based on ground - based cfhtls imaging . after removing the light from the foreground deflector we used the surface brightness distribution of the background source to constrain mass models of the deflector galaxy . for each system we derived einstein radius , position angle , and ellipticity of the mass distribution described as a sie .",
    "these parameters are used in paper ii in combination with spectroscopic information to study the relative distribution of stellar and dark matter in etgs and its evolution with cosmic time . in this paper we focused on the relative orientation and ellipticity of the luminous and total mass distribution , which does not require spectroscopic information .",
    "we found that the ellipticity of mass and light are correlated except for three outliers . in one case",
    "the presence of a disk makes the light distribution significantly flatter than the overall mass distribution . in two cases ,",
    "the presence of a nearby galaxy introduces significant external shear in the overall mass distribution .",
    "in addition , we found that the position angle of mass and light is on average aligned , albeit with rms scatter of 18 - 25 deg , significantly larger than what is found for the lower redshift slac sample .",
    "we interpreted this scatter as most likely due to substantial external shear , on average @xmath119 , resulting from the environment ( physically related to the main deflector galaxy or along the line of sight ) .",
    "the physical scale of the sl2s einstein radii is greater that for slacs : @xmath120 versus 0.5 for slacs @xcite . in addition",
    ", we found only two quad lenses in this pilot sample , suggesting that magnification bias is less effective in boosting the statistics of extended lensed sources as compared with samples comprising point sources .    in paper",
    "ii we combine our lensing information with stellar kinematics to infer the cosmic evolution of the mass density profile of massive galaxies . given the sample size in these first two papers of the series , the role of environment and external shear can not be explored further , neither in terms of astrophysical signal , nor in terms of systematic uncertainty on the mass density slope .",
    "however , the follow - up imaging and spectroscopy of sl2s candidates are still ongoing and we plan to investigate these issues with a much larger sample in future papers of this series",
