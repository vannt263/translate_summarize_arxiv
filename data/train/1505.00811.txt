    "an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) is defined here as a galaxy containing a massive ( @xmath1 ) accreting black hole ( bh ) with eddington ratio exceeding the ( somewhat arbitrary ) limit of l_agn / l_edd @xmath2@xmath3 , where  is the bolometric luminosity and l@xmath4/  erg  s@xmath5is the eddington luminosity for a solar composition gas .",
    "this definition excludes the milky way galaxy but includes a large number of low ionization nuclear emission - line regions ( liners ) and low ionization radio galaxies .",
    "most agns include several of the following components :    * a sub - pc rotational dominated accretion flow that is usually refers to as an accretion disk .",
    "optically thick disks can be geometrically thin ( `` thin '' accretion disk ) or thick ( `` slim '' or `` thick '' accretion disk ) .",
    "optically thin accretion disks or flows that are occasionally advection dominated .",
    "such structures are referred to as radiation inefficient accretion flow ( riaf ) , or advection dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) @xcite . *",
    "high density , dust - free gas clouds moving at roughly keplerian velocities at a luminosity dependent distance of 0.01 - 1 pc from the bh ( the broad line region , blr ) * an axisymmetric dusty structure with luminosity dependent dimensions of 0.110 pc ( the central `` torus '' ) .",
    "* lower density , lower velocity ionized gas ( narrow line region , nlr ) extending from just outside the torus to hundreds and even thousand of parsecs along the general direction of the opening in the torus ( `` ionization cones '' ) .",
    "most of this gas contains dust except for very close in , in a region referred to as `` the coronal line region '' . * a very thin molecular maser disk with size similar to that of the torus . * a central radio jet occasionally associated with @xmath6-ray emission ..    these components have been discussed , extensively , in numerous books and review articles @xcite and the reader is referred to these references for more information .",
    "`` agn unification '' is the idea that the large diversity of observed agn properties can be explained by a small number of physical parameters .",
    "the old unification scheme @xcite is a courageous attempt to combine the ever increasing number of sub - groups into a general picture with two parameters : the torus inclination to the line of sight ( los ) and the source luminosity ( `` unification by inclination '' ) .",
    "this scheme is perhaps the simplest possible way to characterize the known fact that the nuclear continuum and emission line radiation of agns can suffer wavelength dependent scattering , absorption and reflection on the way out .",
    "this can take place in the torus , in the disk of the host galaxy , in stellar and nuclear outflows , and inside the blr itself .",
    "recently it was suggested that agns can be separated in a different way into two major groups : `` radiative mode '' and `` jet mode '' agns @xcite .",
    "most of the energy output in radiative - mode agns is in the form of electromagnetic radiation , and is a direct result of matter accretion through a central optically thick accretion disk .",
    "this group is referred to in the literature as seyfert galaxies or qsos .",
    "about 10% of the sources in this group are radio - loud , showing a highly collimated , relativistic radio jet and , occasionally , a @xmath6-ray jet .",
    "radiative mode agns are very efficient accretors with l_agn / l_edd @xmath2@xmath7 .",
    "an alternative name , based on the level of ionization of the nlr gas , is `` high ionization agns '' ( referred to also as `` high excitation agns '' ) .",
    "the prime energy output of jet - mode agns is bulk kinetic energy transported in two - sided jets .",
    "their typical eddington ratio is much smaller and the jets are most likely powered via a riaf .",
    "the members of this group are low luminosity radio galaxies and liners , and an alternative spectroscopic definition is `` low ionization '' agns . in the local universe",
    "the mean bh mass of objects in the second group is larger .",
    "this review concerns mostly radiative mode agns and the reader is referred to @xcite and @xcite for more information about radio mode sources .",
    "the exception are some liners with total electromagnetic radiation that equals and even exceeds , the jet kinetic energy .",
    "i will not discuss radio - loud , radiative mode agns although most of their properties are indistinguishable from those of the radio - quiet sources .",
    "this excludes about 10% of radiative mode agns .",
    "the main sub - groups addressed in this review are : + * type - i agns : * sources showing broad ( @xmath8 km  sec@xmath5 ) permitted and semi - forbidden emission lines and a bright , non - stellar , central point source visible at all wavelengths that are not contaminated by stellar light .",
    "almost all low to intermediate luminosity type - i agns show strong , high ionization narrow emission lines many of which are forbidden lines .",
    "most papers refer to these sources as seyfert 1 galaxies , or qsos .",
    "narrow emission lines are missing from the spectrum of many high luminosity type - i agns .",
    "many papers make a distinction between several sub - groups of type - i agns like type 1.5 , type 1.8 or type 1.9 .",
    "this refers to the relative intensity of the broad and narrow components of the balmer lines , type 1.9 being the ones with the stronger narrow component . here",
    "i refer to all such objects as type - ii where `` i '' stands for intermediate ( in some papers `` i '' refers to broad paschen lines ) .",
    "this has been a source of much confusion since part of the spectroscopic characteristics have little to do with the conditions near the bh ( e.g. reddening in the host galaxy ) and weak broad lines can also be the result of line and continuum variations .",
    "* type - ii agns : * sources containing strong narrow ( @xmath9 km  sec@xmath5 ) nir - optical - uv emission lines that are somewhat broader than what is observed in emission line galaxies of similar types .",
    "the lines show clear indications of photoionization by a non - stellar source .",
    "the strongest lines are 5007 @xmath10 , 6584 @xmath11 , 3727 @xmath12 , 25.9 m @xmath13 , 3426 @xmath14 , iv1549 civ@xmath15  and the hydrogen balmer and lyman lines .",
    "like type - i agns , they also show a point x - ray source .",
    "advances in mid - ir ( mir ) spectroscopy resulted in attempts to identify type - ii agns by the equivalent width ( ew ) of the silicate 9.7@xmath16  absorption feature in their spectrum .",
    "such methods are not in very good agreement with optical classification .",
    "type - ii agns are further divided into two subgroups .",
    "the first contains hidden type - i sources with broad emission lines seen in polarized light .",
    "the second group is less accurately defined and is occasionally referred to as `` real type - ii '' or `` true type - ii '' agns .",
    "they show similar width and excitation narrow lines but no detectable broad lines and little x - ray absorption .",
    "their mean luminosity is below the luminosity of the type - ii objects with hidden broad lines . in the local universe ,",
    "such objects represent about 30% of all type - ii objects @xcite .",
    "* liners : * agns that are characterised by their low ionization , narrow emission lines from gas which is ionized by a non - stellar source .",
    "typical strong emission lines in this group are 6584 @xmath11 , 6584 @xmath11  and 6731 @xmath17 , and the balmer lines .",
    "i will only address liners with ew(h@xmath18)@xmath19  to avoid the confusion with gas ionized by post - agb stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "liners can be divided into type - i ( broad emission lines ) and type - ii ( only narrow emission lines ) liners . some but not all liners show point - like x - ray and uv sources and uv and x - ray variations @xcite",
    ". detailed reviews of liners are given in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "* lineless agns : * this subgroup consists of agns with extremely weak , sometimes completely undetected emission lines .",
    "they are recognized by the presence of a non - stellar central source and , occasionally , continuum variability .",
    "this general group includes two distinct sub - groups : low luminosity sources ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and very high luminosity sources ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "classifying type - i agns is relatively easy except for cases where the blr is heavily reddened by foreground dust .",
    "identifying and classifying narrow line agns is more challenging , especially when no hard x - ray data are available , partly because pure star forming ( sf ) galaxies ( also referred to as hii galaxies ) , that are more numerous than agns , also show the same strong narrow emission lines .",
    "an efficient way to separate the groups is to make use of `` diagnostic diagrams '' ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that compare various line ratios that differ according to the nature of the ionizing continuum ( stellar or non - stellar ) .",
    "the most useful line ratios are 5007 @xmath10/h@xmath20 , 6584 @xmath11/h@xmath18 , and 6300 @xmath21 /h@xmath18 .",
    "diagnostic diagrams show several well defined regions , one including high ionization agns , one including mostly liners , and one occupied by sf galaxies .",
    "the region between the pure sf systems and agns is occupied by `` composite sources '' , with intermediate spectral properties .",
    "most agns known to date were found in large surveys , like the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , through spectroscopic observations with relatively large apertures ( e.g. 3 arc - sec in the sdss ) .",
    "the host galaxies of most agns are sf galaxies @xcite .",
    "we can estimate the total emitted sf luminosity , , and distinguish `` agn dominated '' ( @xmath22 ) from `` sf dominated '' ( @xmath22 ) systems .",
    "for example , in the spectroscopic 3 arc - sec sdss sample , such an comparison shows that many composite sources are sf dominated galaxies .",
    "difficulties in identifying agns in composite sources can affect the census of local type - ii agns , their luminosity and mass functions ( lfs , mfs ) .",
    "the census of type - i agns is based on other methods and is not subjected to such uncertainties beyond a redshift of about 0.1 .",
    ".the fraction of strong emission line sources , at two redshift intervals , as derived from diagnostic diagrams of sdss objects from the data release 7 of the catalog .",
    "the total number of sources in the 0.050.1 redshift interval is 108,353 and the number in the 0.150.2 interval , 17,572 .",
    "the selection includes all emission line objects where the lines that were used for the classification have signal - to - noise ratio larger than 3 .",
    "this introduces a large bias against sources at higher redshifts , especially weak line liners ( courtesy of david rosario ) . [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]        the original unification scheme ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) included a central axisymmetric dusty structure with a column density which is large enough to completely obscure the central source in some directions .",
    "this is usually referred to as the central `` torus '' ; a somewhat ambiguous name which will , nevertheless , be retained here .",
    "the simplest torus is made of a smooth matter distribution .",
    "more elaborated structures , made of clumps and inter - clump material , are preferred by today s observations .",
    "the gas at the inner radius of the torus is ionized by the central source .",
    "deeper in , the torus contains dusty molecular gas .",
    "it is interesting to study the observational consequences of placing such a simple geometrical structure around the central bh and accretion disk .",
    "the first prediction is a dependence of the obscuring column on inclination to the los , where inclination is measured relative to the @xmath23 axis of the system ( the direction perpendicular to the central disk ) .",
    "small inclinations , close to face - on , allow a clear view of the central source and high inclinations result in large obscuration at uv - optical wavelengths .",
    "the second prediction is based on the fact that electromagnetic radiation reflected off dust grains and free electrons is polarized , with angle and percentage polarization which depend on geometry and wavelength .",
    "the seminal work of @xcite is among the first of many papers showing how to detect hidden broad emission lines using spectropolarimetry and how to infer the blr kinematics and overall geometry from such observations . later and deeper polarimetry ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) show a large fraction of type - iis with no hint for polarized broad lines .",
    "this led to the suggestion that objects lacking polarized broad lines are unobscured but void of blr gas , like the real type - ii agns (   [ sec : classification ] ) that show no detectable broad lines even when not obscured ..      the next unavoidable consequence is a column density dependent x - ray absorption .",
    "the assumption used here is of an isotropically emitting central x - ray source , possibly a hot corona over the central part of the accretion disk . for a compton thin torus , with @xmath24 @xmath25 ,",
    "the obscuring column density can be measured by modeling the observed spectrum provided the intrinsic spectral energy distribution ( sed ) and the gas metallicity are known ( for solar metallicity gas , most of the x - ray absorption beyond 0.3 kev is due to metals ) .",
    "there are several x - ray spectral features that can help diagnose the torus properties .",
    "the first is the `` compton hump '' , an excess radiation at around 20 kev due to the down scattering of hard x - ray photons .",
    "almost all type - i agns show compton humps in their spectra ( the terms `` scattering '' and `` reflection '' are used quite loosely in the literature , all referring to compton scattering followed by absorption , see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the second feature is due to reflection off electrons in highly ionized gas . here",
    "the reflected radiation is a mirror image of the intrinsic continuum with intensity that , for all practical purposes , depends only on the geometrical covering factor ( = @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the solid angle subtended by the torus ) .",
    "this fraction hardly ever exceeds a few percent .",
    "the third spectral feature is the k@xmath28 iron line .",
    "this emission feature is a collection of fluorescence ( auger ) k@xmath28 transitions and recombination of h - like and he - like iron at energies between 6.4 and 7 kev , depending on the specific ion .",
    "the lines are broad and of high ionization if originating from the surface of the central accretion disk , or narrow and occasionally of low ionization if due to x - ray illumination of the cold gas in the torus . in case where the x - ray continuum is unobscured , the ew of the narrow k@xmath18  line depends on the number of absorbed e@xmath29 kev photons .",
    "for a typical x - ray sed and solar metallicity gas , this is estimated to be : ew(k@xmath18)@xmath30@xmath31 ev , where complications like multiple scattering have been ignored ( note that @xmath32 is not necessarily the los absorbing column , see  3.3 ) for a torus with a covering factor of 0.5 and column density of @xmath33 @xmath25 , ew(k@xmath18)@xmath34 ev .",
    "indeed , many type - i agns show narrow k@xmath18  lines with this ew ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein )",
    ". an even clearer signature of a central torus is the very large ew(k@xmath18 ) in compton thick sources . in this case ,",
    "much of the k@xmath18  line reaches the observer without being absorbed but most of the central continuum radiation is blocked by the torus .",
    "the observer can only see the much weaker reflected continuum which raises the observed ew dramatically and it can reach 12 kev .      the unobscured ionizing radiation of the central source reaches the gas in the galaxy causing heating and ionization .",
    "this results in the emission of various narrow lines .",
    "a torus like geometry will result in two `` ionization cones '' ( or bicone ) depending on the geometry and inclination to the line of sight , one of the cones may not be observed .",
    "the dust sublimation temperature , @xmath35 , is the maximum temperature attained by a dust grain before it evaporates .",
    "this depends on grain size and composition and the local flux . for ism type graphite grains ,",
    "the maximum sublimation temperature is @xmath36k and for silicate grains , @xmath37k .",
    "these numbers can be used to derive a _",
    "mean sublimation radius _ , @xmath38 , which is the minimum radius where a grain of a certain size can survive the local radiation field .",
    "averaging over ism - type grain sizes , one obtains the following mean sublimation distances for graphite ( c ) and silicate ( si ) grains ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath39^{2.6 } f(\\theta ) \\,\\ , { \\rm pc}\\ , ;    \\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\ , \\langle r_{\\rm sub , si } \\rangle \\simeq 1.3 l_{46}^{1/2 } \\left [ \\frac{1500}{t_{\\rm sub } } \\right ] ^{2.6 } f(\\theta ) \\,\\ , { \\rm pc } \\",
    ", ,   \\label{eq : r_sub}\\ ] ] where @xmath40/@xmath41 erg  s@xmath5  and @xmath42 is an angular dependent term that allows for anisotropy of the central source radiation @xcite . for an isotropic source @xmath43 and for a thin disk with electron scattering atmosphere , @xmath44^{1/2}$ ] @xcite .",
    "the above numbers are computed for a mean grain size of @xmath45@xmath16  and the distance depends roughly on @xmath46 .",
    "dust can compete effectively with the ionization of the gas because of its large absorption cross sections at all wavelengths longer than about @xmath47 m . for highly ionized gas , @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the ionization parameter defined over the hydrogen lyman continuum @xcite . at high levels of ionization , the dust absorbs a larger fraction of the photons capable of ionizing hydrogen and helium .",
    "this reduces the size of the ionized part of the cloud and lowers the intensity of most emission lines .",
    "emission line photons produced far from the surface of an ionized , dusty gas cloud , suffer additional attenuation on their way out due to absorption by the dust .",
    "this is most noticeable in lines with high optical depth where the large number of scatterings of the line photons increase considerably the path length .",
    "thus , a clear prediction of the torus scenario is that the high velocity gas near the bh will be divided into two distinct regions , dust - free gas with strong line emission and dusty gas with weak line emission @xcite .",
    "a clear prediction of any torus model is a broad ir sed with a total luminosity that depends almost entirely on the fraction of the central source radiation absorbed by dust in the torus ( a combination of optical depth and covering factor ) .",
    "the radiation may be emitted isotropically , or anisotropically , depending on the optical depth and exact geometry .",
    "the sed is predicted to show several silicate features centered around 9.7 and 18@xmath16 , either in absorption or emission , depending on the exact geometry and los optical depth .",
    "the emitted radiation of basically all agns is varying in time .",
    "this will result in a time - dependent incident flux on the inner torus walls , and time dependent nir and mir emission by the dust .",
    "the term `` unification scheme '' refers usually to two different categories : ir - optical - uv - x - ray unification , and radio unification .",
    "the first involves a central dusty torus and can explain the major differences between type - i and type - ii agns with a surprisingly small number of assumptions .",
    "this was first suggested in the late 1980s .",
    "the second combines the torus with a relativistic jet observed in some 10% of all high ionization agns .",
    "the jet is launched in the vicinity of the bh and is aligned with the symmetry axis of the system .",
    "this can be used to make specific predictions about the observed properties of compact and extended radio - loud agns .",
    "radio unification is not covered in this review and the reader is referred to @xcite and @xcite for references on this topic .",
    "it is also worth noting that liners were not included in the first unification schemes .",
    "recent observations of large agn samples , and more detailed information about specific sources , lead to the conclusion that the old unification scheme requires three major modifications .",
    "the first is related to the physics and structure of the central obscurer .",
    "the second is the realization that there are real differences between various sub - groups , beyond the dependence on luminosity and torus inclination .",
    "this can be due to the nature of the central power - house ( e.g. a riaf instead of high efficiency accretion flow ) , and the fact that some agns lack one or more of the main components , e.g. a blr or a nlr .",
    "the third is related to bh and galaxy evolution .",
    "the present review focuses on these modifications .",
    "understanding the cosmological evolution of super - massive bhs is key to the understanding of galaxy evolution this requires reliable luminosity and mass functions which depend on agn classification . while large surveys like sdss contain hundreds of thousands of agns up to @xmath50 , this survey , and basically all others , are hindered by various selection effects . since the topic of this review is agn unification , i will only mention here selection effects that can bias agn classification .",
    "the use of diagnostic diagrams in spectroscopic surveys , like sdss , to obtain complete agn samples is limited to low redshift .",
    "beyond @xmath51 , type - ii agns with weaker emission lines drop from the sample because of poor signal to noise ( s / n ) and contamination by stellar absorption lines ( weak line liners are already missing from such samples at redshift as small as 0.1 ) . at @xmath52 , the h@xmath18  line , which is crucial for the classification , is shifted beyond the observable range . an alternative method to detect luminous type - ii agns up to @xmath53",
    "is to search for strong  lines relative to h@xmath20which is required _ not to show _ a broad component .",
    "unfortunately , large ir spectroscopic surveys are not yet available , and alternative diagnostics , based on emission lines at shorter wavelengths , are not as reliable .",
    "broad line agns are detected by their continuum shape and their broad emission lines . at @xmath54 , the least luminous type",
    "- is drop from such samples due to strong stellar continuum and large amplitude continuum variations .",
    "reddening and obscuration is another reason for losing sources from large samples . at small redshift , this affects type - iis more than type - is .",
    "ir - selected samples are less prone to reddening but are biased towards sources with larger covering factor and against large inclination angles ( see  [ sec : torus_models ] ) .",
    "they are also contaminated by emission from sf regions in the galaxy .",
    "mid - ir photometric surveys , like those based on _ spitzer _",
    "@xcite are very efficient in differentiating agns from non - active galaxies . however , as will be shown later , the ir - sed is not uniform enough to unambiguously differentiate between agn types and type - ii classification is most problematic .",
    "host galaxy contamination affects the measuring of low luminosity agns over the entire rest - frame range of 0.32 @xmath16 .",
    "selecting and classifying agns by their hard x - ray continuum is , arguably , the most reliable way at almost all redshifts .",
    "the completeness of this method depends on the energy and flux limit of the specific sample and various sophisticated methods have been developed to allow for such biases .",
    "a major difficulty is to detect highly obscured , large column density x - ray sources at high redshift .",
    "a comprehensive comparison of the efficiency of various methods to discover agns is given in @xcite . according to this work ( see their figure 16 and related explanation ) , the missing fractions of agns in various samples depend on the bolometric luminosity and are roughly : optical ( b - band )",

    " 8 is a short summary of the main points of this review .",
    "how large and how massive is the central structure",
    "? how is it connected to the blr and accretion disk on its inner side , and to the ism of the host galaxy on the outer side ?",
    "is it a torus , a disk , or some other shape ?",
    "is such a structure typical of all large bulge galaxies or is bh accretion essential to form and maintain it ? and most important , how is this structure formed in active galaxies ?",
    "the global theoretical framework is presented in this section and the observational consequences in  3 .",
    "the terminology used in this area of research requires some clarification since the terms `` central disk '' , `` central torus '' and `` central accretion disk '' have been used quite loosely . in this review , the term inner accretion disk refers to the accretion flow inside the sublimation radius , where the accreted gas is losing angular momentum through molecular , magnetic or other sources of viscosity .",
    "many agns must contain a much larger disk - like structure , 1 - 100 pc in size , that connects the inner disk to the host galaxy . the inner part of this structure can have a thick geometry in which case it becomes the inner torus . the entire structure , that can extend beyond the torus ,",
    "is referred to here as the `` central disk '' or the `` @xmath57 disk '' ( after the toomre stability parameter @xmath57 , see below ) .",
    "it contains a large amount of molecular gas that , given a large enough column density , undergoes sf associated with super - novae ( sn ) explosions , the growth of a nuclear star cluster , etc .",
    "some of these processes result in local effective viscosity that can make this entire structure a large accretion disk , where gas loses its angular momentum and drifts into the center .",
    "the angular momentum of the large disk is not necessarily aligned with the angular momentum of the inner disk .",
    "there is also no known reason why such a large disk will maintain its properties throughout the accretion episode .",
    "two general types of central disks and central tori have been considered .",
    "the first are theoretical models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that were developed to explore specific aspects like the formation , stability , shape and evolution of the central structure .",
    "the models attempt to answer two fundamental questions : what is the mechanism that removes angular momentum from galactic infalling gas thus allowing the feeding of the central bh , and what are the ways to maintain a thick gaseous structure for a long period of time .",
    "important processes considered in this context include blob motions along magnetic field lines , colliding magnetic clumps , radiation pressure supported dusty clumps , sf driven turbulence , sn explosions , agn and stellar feedback via radiation pressure and winds , and more .",
    "several analytic and semi - analytic models have been proposed but the hydrodynamical simulations seem to provide more realistic ways to model this complex situation .",
    "the second type is phenomenological , ad - hoc models that make assumptions about the size , composition and geometry of the torus in an attempt to explain the observations , mostly the spatially resolved images and the nir - mir sed ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "most such models neglect the connection between the torus and its surrounding .    a natural way to describe the accretion problem is to start from the inner disk , assumed in most models to be geometrically thin and optically thick , where the local viscosity allows radial drift of material all the way to the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) .",
    "a natural outer boundary of the accretion disk is its self gravity radius , @xmath58 : the location where local gravity exceeds the vertical component of the central bh gravity and the disk becomes unstable ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "this radius is given by : @xmath60^{4/9 } [ \\eta/0.1]^{-4/9 }   r_g \\ , ,   \\label{eq : r_sg}\\ ] ] where @xmath61=m_bh @xmath62/@xmath63 , @xmath64 is the viscosity parameter which is of order 0.01 - 0.1 , @xmath65 is the mass - to - radiation conversion efficiency , and @xmath66 is , again , the gravitational radius @xcite . for a stationary @xmath67 bh and a thin accretion disks radiating at l_agn / l_edd @xmath2@xmath68 , @xmath69pc .    in the absence of additional local heating sources",
    ", @xmath57 drops below unity beyond the self - gravity radius , and the disk is fragmented into clouds that move in the same general plane .",
    "the gap that is formed prevents the inflow of additional , more distant material to the center .",
    "according to some models @xcite , a marginally stable situation with @xmath70 can be maintained over a large distance beyond @xmath58 due to collisions between clouds , and sf and sn explosions that produce turbulence and local viscosity .",
    "this allows accretion from much larger radii . for very massive bhs",
    ", such a marginally unstable disk can extend to @xmath71 pc and beyond .",
    "a challenge of models of this type is to combine all these processes into a coherent sf history which allows to follow the evolution of the nuclear star cluster .",
    "another comprehensive semi - analytic model by @xcite , considers gas infall from the galaxy which results in the formation of a clumpy central disk .",

    "this raises the possibility that a long accretion episode of @xmath86 yr is broken into several shorter episodes during which the inner disk is disconnected from the outer flow .",

    "sf activity and sn explosions take place inside the torus walls and the duration of one accretion episode is estimated to be @xmath85 yr .",
    "this would result in @xmath87 stars that may eventually settle into a central star cluster .",
    "phenomenological torus models is the name chosen here for ad hoc models that are constructed to enable a more accurate treatment of the radiative transfer , and better modeling of the emitted sed and the images of the torus at different wavelengths .",
    "there are three generic types of phenomenological torus models : continuous ( or smooth ) gas distribution models , ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "all phenomenological models are axisymmetric and the torus inner walls are assumed to be at the dust sublimation radius .",
    "unfortunately , the definition of this radius can differ between models because of the different types of grains , and the exact way used to estimate the bolometric luminosity of the central sources .",
    "some of the models , e.g. @xcite , take into account the anisotropy of the central source radiation .",
    "this adds an angular term to the torus equations ( @xmath42 in eqn .",

    ", the torus equatorial plane reaches all the way to the outer boundary of the central accretion disk .",
    "the effect is more noticeable in the case of slim disks , where the angular dependence of the central source radiation is more noticeable @xcite .",
    "the important parameters of the continuous phenomenological models are the inner and outer radii of the torus , the density profile and the opening angle .",
    "additional parameters of clumpy tori models are the column density of individual clumps , the radial distribution of the clumps ( this replaces the run of gas density in the smooth model ) , the filling factor and density distribution of the clumps .",
    "present day phenomenological models do not yet include different types of grains in different parts of the torus although this has been considered in simpler ( from the point of view of radiative transfer ) models like @xcite .",
    "radiative transfer is relatively easy to handle in continuous dusty tori but this is not the case in clumpy tori .",

    "this is predicted to be most noticeable in type - ii sources that are seen at large inclination angles ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "there are two fundamental reasons for the different seds of clumpy torus models .",
    "first , the illuminated and back sides of individual clumps radiate at very different temperatures .",
    "this allows a certain location in the torus to have a large range of temperatures rather than the single temperature typical of continuous models .",
    "second , and more important , gaps between the clumps allow a free , un - attenuated line of sight from the center to deep inside the torus",
    ". a clump at several @xmath89 can emit at the local , distant dependent dust temperature spreading the high temperature regions over larger parts of the torus .",
    "there are two important consequences : the strength of the 9.7@xmath16  absorption feature is much below its predicted strength in continuous distribution cases , and the anisotropy of the emitted radiation is smaller .",
    "an obvious limitation is the assumption of empty space between the clouds in a system where cloud collision and evaporation are unavoidable .",
    "the third type of composite models is , perhaps , the most realistic . in this case",
    ", the volume between clumps is filled with diluted dusty gas which absorbs part of the incident optical - uv radiation and part of the locally emitted nir and mir radiation .",

    "[ sec : additional_obscurers ] and the second in  [ sec : torus_observations ]      each of the models discussed above has its own effective covering factor . for smooth torus models ,",
    "this is simply a matter of geometry and the wavelength dependent optical depths . for clumpy models ,",
    "it depends on the number of clouds and their 3d distribution . in the straw person model of @xcite , the covering factor",
    "is assumed to be the same for all sources of a given luminosity .",
    "the implication to large samples is translated to a simple expression : = n(type - ii)/n(type - i ) .",
    "the realization of a significant spread in  at a given luminosity , suggests that the covering factor is a second unification parameter @xcite . in this case",
    ", the relative number of type - i and type - ii sources still defines the mean but a source is more likely to be classified as type - ii if its covering factor is larger than the mean and as type - i if it is smaller than the mean .",
    "thus the high covering factor tail of the  distribution contains more type - ii agns , and the mean covering factor of type - is is smaller than the mean of type - iis if objects are selected by their optical properties .",
    "more quantitatively , if we define the covering factor probability distribution of sources with luminosity @xmath90 as @xmath91(,@xmath90 ) , and the probability for a type - i source from this population to have a covering factor , @xmath92(,@xmath90 ) , we can write : @xmath93 because of the finite probability of seeing the central source at _ any inclination _ through a clumpy medium ( assuming no dusty inter - clump material ) , some sources classified spectroscopically as type - i agns , have high inclination angles .",
    "similarly , an obscuration by a single large cloud can result in the appearance of a type - ii spectrum .",
    "this interesting possibility can be tested by observations .",
    "for example , the angle of polarization of hidden broad emission lines in face - on tori , is predicted to be very different from edge - on tori .",
    "the presence of a lower density , dusty intercloud medium @xcite changes this simple estimation but the overall dependence on the angular distribution of the clumps is still an important feature of all clumpy torus models .",
    "anisotropy is a second characteristic of all torus models .",
    "this is most noticeable in continuous gas distribution tori where the smallest - distance dust , which is directly heated by the central source , can only be seen from small inclination angles . in clumpy tori",
    ", there are always gaps in the distribution and hot clumps can be seen at larger inclination angles .",
    "this reduces the anisotropy .",
    "inspection of several of the @xcite and @xcite models designed to fit observed seds , suggests that for wavelengths that are optically thick to the torus emitted radiation , the anisotropy is roughly proportional to @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is the inclination to the los .",
    "this is similar to the expected anisotropy of the central accretion disk . at longer wavelengths , where the dust optical depth is smaller , the emission is more isotropic and at fir wavelengths the torus emits more like a sphere .",
    "a general , somewhat simplistic approach which does not take into account wavelength dependences is , nevertheless , useful for improving the estimated geometrical covering factor for type - i agns .",
    "this approach requires an isotropy parameter @xmath96 that varies from 1 ( complete isotropy ) to 0 ( maximum anisotropy ) , and a general dust anisotropy function , @xmath97 .",
    "assume a case where the ( unknown ) torus covering factor is  and the total agn bolometric luminosity , , is completely isotropic and seen , unattenuated , through the opening in the torus , i.e. ( 1- )  escapes the system .",
    "the total dust emission is @xmath98  and the emission through the opening is = ( @xmath99 . recall that flux measurements refer to luminosity per unit solid angle ( i.e. divide the agn and dust emission through the opening by ( 1- ) ) , we can define an observed ratio , @xmath100=/  and relate it to the covering factor by requiring @xmath101 , where the anisotropy function is : @xmath102 this gives @xmath103 for complete isotropy ( @xmath104 ) and @xmath105 for maximum anisotropy ( @xmath106 ) , as required .",
    "for example , in a case where = 0.7 , complete isotropy of dust emission gives @xmath107 , maximum anisotropy gives @xmath108 , and an intermediate case with @xmath109 gives @xmath110 .    finally , in optically thick tori , the covering factor may also be related to the narrow line intensities since the smaller the covering factor is , the larger is the opening and more nlr gas is exposed to the central source radiation . as shown in   [ sec : ionization_cones ] below , this is a somewhat simplistic approach since the nlr gas does not necessarily fill the entire cone and since absorption by dusty inter - clump material close to the edges of the torus can not be neglected .",
    "moreover , the intensity of the narrow emission lines relative to the bolometric luminosity , , increase with decreasing source luminosity in a way which seems to be completely unrelated to the torus covering factor .",
    "the large number of successful ir space missions of the last 20 years , the on going successful x - ray missions , and the significant improvements in ground - based interferometry , revolutionized the study of agn tori .",
    "they provide huge data sets that can be used to obtain reliable ir seds , allow multi - wavelength studies of many thousands of agns , and enabled to probe regions that are 1 pc in size near the bh .",

    "clumpy torus models provide adequate fits to many observed seds but seem to be degenerate with respect to their basic parameters . because of this , models with different geometry , dust distribution and even inclination , can produce equally good fits to the same data .",
    "the inner region of the torus which contains pure graphite dust is clearly required by the observations but is missing from todays models . given all this ,",
    "it is not yet clear that current phenomenological models resemble , well , real agn tori .      as explained in  2.3.2 , dust emission from optically thick tori",

    "they show that the hot - dust covering factor varies over a larger range with some sources missing this component all together ( `` hot - dust poor agns '' , see @xcite ) .",
    "the fraction of such sources among luminous agns is about 15% . in general ( hot - dust)@xmath30(warm dust ) but the separation of the two is model dependent .",
    "a big disadvantage of this method as applied to ir - selected samples is the bias against low covering factor sources .",
    "the torus covering factor can be obtained directly from modeling the observed x - ray continuum ( see  [ sec : the_agn_family ] ) .",
    "this has been demonstrated by @xcite and by @xcite who made a careful comparison of the scattered and transmitted x - ray flux of a large number of type - ii agns .",
    "they claimed to be able to measure scattered radiation which is as low as 12% and thus identify `` buried '' active bhs that are completely surrounded by geometrically thick tori with @xmath129 .",
    "the work suggests that some 20% of high redshift sources in several deep x - ray fields are completely buried agns .",
    "an additional way to estimate  is based on the observed intensity of the narrow fe  k@xmath18  line (  [ sec : central_obscurer ] ) .",
    "studies of large x - ray samples show that ew(k@xmath18 ) decreases with increasing x - ray luminosity , roughly like @xmath130 , but not with redshift ( the `` x - ray baldwin effect '' ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as explained , ew(k@xmath18 ) depends on the combination of the torus column density , covering factor and metallicity @xcite .",
    "the advantage of this method is that the selection of sources by their x - ray flux is independent of the measured quantity , ew(k@xmath18 ) .",
    "the possible complications are extra emission from k@xmath18  produced in broad line clouds and the fact that ew(k@xmath18 ) depends also on the column density .",
    "moreover , the measured los x - ray column , and the mean column density of the torus , are not necessarily the same ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "finally , a complementary approach to find a population mean covering factor is to measure the los obscuring column and associate small columns with type - i sources and large columns with type - ii sources .",
    "the mean  is then obtained from the ratio n(type - ii)/n(type - i ) , where n stands for the number of objects .",
    "this method is discussed in  [ sec : unification_or_evolution ] .",
    "it is interesting to examine the covering factor of the most luminous agns .",
    "an example is the work of @xcite who compared the  ( rest - frame 7.8@xmath16 ) and sdss ( rest - frame wavelength of 1350 ) luminosities of the most mir luminous type - i agns at redshift 1.55 .",
    "the study assumed /l(7.8@xmath16)@xmath131 and found extremely high values of , @xmath132erg  s@xmath5 , and @xmath133 for many sources .",
    "the problem with this and several other studies is the neglect of known selection effects and necessary correction factors . like the anisotropy correction term of eqn .",
    "[ eq : covering_anisotropy ] and the possible anisotropy of the accretion disk radiation . moreover , these objects are probably unique among type - i agns in terms of their covering factor because they were selected to be the most ir luminous .",
    "indeed the agreement between the luminosity distributions at 7.8@xmath16  and at 1350 , is very poor .",
    "finally , a large fraction of the sources may be reddened , because of the large dust covering factor , a possibility that was acknowledged by the authors .",
    "taken together , it seems that the mean torus covering factor for the most luminous type - i agns is @xmath134 .    an important way to evaluate _",
    "the combined effect _ of anisotropy and covering factor is to compare the x - ray and mir luminosities , l(mir)/l(210 kev ) .",
    "the comparison made at 6 and @xmath135@xmath16  shows an almost identical mean ratio for the two agn types , over four orders of magnitude in luminosity , with a typical scatter of about 0.3 dex @xcite .",
    "this is a somewhat surprising result given the covering factor and anisotropy discussed earlier .",
    "naive expectations suggest that the larger covering factor of type - ii sources will increase l(mir)/l(210 kev ) relative to type - is . on the other hand , anisotropy of the mir emission",
    "would tend to decrease this ratio in type - ii agns that are typically seen at higher inclination angles .",
    "emission by nlr dust will affect large aperture observations and will contribute equally to the two types .",
    "this can not be a significant source of confusion at 6@xmath16 , where the nlr dust contribution is small , or when using small aperture observation that exclude most of the nlr emission .",
    "is it possible that all these effects conspire to smear out the differences between type - i and type - ii agns ?",
    "there were several attempts to blame the unexpected constant ratio of l(mir)/l(210 kev ) on the method used to estimate l(210 kev ) @xcite and to obtain absorption - corrected x - ray luminosities that take into account more complex clumpy tori , including partial covering in some directions .",
    "however , it is difficult to see how all this can explain the above luminosity ratio ..      perhaps the most important development regarding agn unification is the significant improvements in long baseline interferometry and the ability to resolve the central structure on a milli - arcsecond scale .",
    "the most significant results were obtained by three instruments : 1 .",
    "mid - infrared interferometric instrument ( midi ) : the eso interferometer working in the 8 - 13@xmath16  atmospheric window with projected baselines ranging from about 30 to 130 m ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the eso astronomical multi - beam combiner ( amber * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "interferometric measurements allow to measure and model the size and shape of the ir emitting components on a very small spatial scale of less than 1 pc .",
    "the attainable resolution depends on the flux distribution in the source , the wavelength and baseline of the experiment , the redshift and the source coordinates ( which determine the coverage of the uv - plane ) .",
    "the results are often quoted in units of @xmath136 , which is the wavelength dependent radius containing half of the emitted flux .",
    "the midi latest results , summarized in @xcite and illustrated in figure [ fig : leonard_midi ] , include 23 sources with 813@xmath16  dimensions of 1 - 100 pc .",
    "the ki and amber samples are smaller but they provide valuable information about shorter wavelengths and hotter dust .",
    "the large scatter in the measured @xmath136 at mir wavelengths is very different from the very tight correlation between size and luminosity indicated by dust rm that probes regions closer to the inner torus boundary .",
    "part of this must be related to the fact that in many cases , there are two distinct components in the resolved n - band interferometry .",
    "translating this to a specific size is obviously model dependent and subjected to large uncertainties .",
    "this indicates a rather complex relationship between radius and dust temperature in the torus .",
    "another surprise is the very similar size of type - i and type - ii objects of the same luminosity ( simple tori predict that type - ii tori will look larger ) .",
    "also , the measured k - band @xmath136 is larger , by 0.20.4 dex , than the measured k - band rm size @xcite .",
    "this is likely related to the different definitions of the two radii since @xmath136 is a flux weighted radius and @xmath137 ( or @xmath138 ) a response weighted radius .    in a very small number of well observed nearby sources ,",
    "the interferometry allows to obtain `` model images '' that reveal the rough structure , elongation , and inclination of the central dusty structure . as of 2014 , there are four sources with this kind of information : ngc1068 ( type - ii ) , circinus ( type - ii ) , ngc424 ( type - i ) and ngc3783 ( type - i ) .",
    "of the four , the spatial information obtained for the circinus galaxy , a type - ii agn with a graphite sublimation radius of about 0.01 pc , is perhaps the best .",
    "the emissivity maps of this source , in three mir bands , were modeled by @xcite and their combination is shown in figure [ fig : circinus_midi ] .",
    "the figure shows also the boundaries of the ionization cone based on hst imaging of the 5007 @xmath10  line .",

    "the second is a much larger and thicker elongated structure , roughly perpendicular to the first component .",

    "the combined model - image indicates different elongations of the k and n - band isophotes .",
    "the most likely elongation of the k - band model - image ( which is still somewhat uncertain ) is in a direction parallel to the expected plane of the torus .",
    "the n - band model - image is of much larger dimensions and is elongated almost perpendicular to the k - band model - image , along the expected polar axis .",
    "this geometry was interpreted by @xcite as a combination of an inner small torus , where the dust is very hot , and a dusty polar outflow which , because of its distance , contains cooler dust .",
    "this is somewhat similar to the circinus model mentioned earlier ( where k - band information is not available ) .",
    "interestingly , earlier ground - based ao - assisted observations pointed out polar emission in a different source ( ngc1068 , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    while complicated radiative transfer effects may result in the unusual model - images presented here ( see *",
    "* ) , the interferometric results for circinus and ngc3783 , and indications for similar structure in two other sources , suggest a possible change of paradigm . a central equatorial , small covering factor torus , may still be needed in order to explain the hot dust emission , but much of the cooler @xmath141 k dust may well reside in an additional component which has different geometry , size and optical depth and , perhaps , different dynamics ( i , e , a wind component ) . a realistic model for this new structure must combine several different elements and take into account the fact that the hotter inner torus must also emit some of the observed mir flux ( e.g. 20% in the case of circinus ) .",
    "it should also answer several outstanding questions about the clear pass to the ionization cone , indicated by strong unreddened narrow lines , if the flow is optically thick , or the lack of silicate emission in the circinus spectrum if it is optically thin .",
    "one must also dismiss covering factor estimates that apply only to simple axisymmetric tori .",
    "in particular , the assumption of ( total)=(hot dust)+(warm dust ) may not work in this type of geometry .",
    "finally , it is interesting to note that several hydrodynamics models suggest dusty polar outflows @xcite which may go part of the way towards in explaining the observations .",
    "galaxy scale obscuration is common in many agns and numerous individual cases studied by hst and ground based observations have been documented since the 1980s ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "high spatial resolution observations of such objects reveal kpc scale dusty filaments that seem to be connected with much smaller dusty features close to the nucleus .",

    "agns in face - on galaxies show little 9.7@xmath16   silicate absorption , as predicted by clumpy torus models , and agns in nearly edge - on galaxies , or in mergers , show much stronger silicate absorption indicating dust in the galaxy .",
    "this adds to previous similar results obtained for compton thin type - ii agns @xcite . in some cases ,",
    "galactic extinction is so large that it can completely obscure the central agn at optical wavelengths @xcite .",
    "the connection , if any , to the heavily reddened agns mentioned earlier , is not yet clear .    supplementing the detailed investigation of individual sources , are lower spatial resolution studies of many thousands of agns like @xcite .",
    "this study finds that spiral and elliptical type - i hosts are strongly skewed towards face - on galaxies , while type - ii hosts are skewed towards edge - on orientations .",
    "the paper also shows that galactic dust absorption by itself can not explain the absence of broad emission lines in type - ii sources .",
    "the inclination of the host galaxy strengthens the idea that the angular momentum of the material which feeds the black hole retains a memory of its origin in the galaxy , i.e. , statistically speaking , galaxy disks , central tori and inner accretion disks , are generally aligned .",
    "this issue , that was investigated in numerous papers , is still unresolved .",
    "for example , @xcite used information from radio jet position angles and claimed to find no correlation between jet direction ( i.e. inner accretion disk orientation ) and the disk of the host galaxy .",
    "the simple idea of a single torus - like obscurer suffers from various limitations , especially when it comes to very large column densities .",
    "for example , the observed optical reddening is much smaller than the value obtained by translating the measured x - ray column to foreground extinction assuming galactic dust - to - gas ratio ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "there are also x - ray variations that indicate large changes in the obscuring column on very short time scales ( a few days or less ) , which is not consistent with the idea that the obscuring material is outside the sublimation radius .",
    "this raises the possibility that obscuration by dust - free gas inside the blr affects the x - ray absorption and hence also the agn classification .",
    "the typical dimensions of blr clouds are estimated to be @xmath142 cm and their typical column density is of order @xmath143 @xmath25 .",
    "this is roughly the size of the central x - ray source in low - to - intermediate luminosity agns ( a few @xmath66 ) . for an x - ray continuum source @xmath144 cm across , and a cloud velocity of order 3000 ^-1 kms@xmath5 ,",
    "the occultation time is of order 4 days .",
    "can such clouds occult the central source giving the impression of a variable x - ray source ?",
    "recent observations and modeling suggest that this is indeed the case in almost every object where the observations are of long enough duration to discover such `` eclipses '' .",
    "there is now evidence from very detailed studies of a small number of type - i and type - ii agns , for eclipses by large column density blobs @xcite . in the",
    "best studied case , ngc1365 , the x - ray source underwent a total eclipse in less than 48 hours and then emerged within the same time @xcite .",
    "detailed modeling of this and similar events , by @xcite , provided information about the likely location , velocity and size of the occulting gas , all consistent with being part of the blr and inside the sublimation radius .",
    "@xcite speculated that the occulting clouds might have developed cometary tails , which are manifested as a gradual decrease in the column density as clouds emerged from the eclipse .",
    "different time dependent x - ray absorption events from inside the sublimation radius are described in @xcite .",
    "there are more studies that are not as detailed but include a larger number of agns and occultation events .",

    "these objects were monitored continuously by the rossi x - rat timing explorer ( rxte ) and the total duration is of order 10 years . given the known bh mass in these sources , one can work out the expected crossing time of dusty and dust - free blobs of certain properties at different locations .",
    "the results suggest that many of the clumps are , indeed , inside the sublimation radius with properties that are consistent with being blr clouds .",
    "other blobs are larger and move slower with locations that are consistent with being inside the dusty torus .",
    "interestingly , in several of the cases the clump location , assuming keplerian orbits , seems to be close to the maximum allowed dimension of such tori .",
    "@xcite presented also an analysis of the non - variable x - ray absorbing columns and claim they are in conflict with the predicted dimensions , column density and number of clumps in clumpy torus models .",
    "an additional study , by @xcite , includes more sources but shorter duration monitoring sensitive to events that last a few days at most .",
    "it presents numerous events associated with changing in hardness ratio of the x - ray continuum , all consistent with being caused by transiting blobs inside the blr .",
    "the observations are not detailed enough to allow a robust determination of the column density of the absorbers .",
    "the x - ray observations provide a beautiful illustration of the connection between dust - free and dusty clumps in one general region that contains the blr , closer in , and the torus , further away from the central bh .",
    "the earlier apparent disagreement between optical reddening and x - ray column density disappears when taking into account the combination of inner dust - free and outer dusty absorbers .",
    "the observations also help to explain the nature of some of the largest obscuring columns found in agns .",
    "is an axisymmetric torus - like structure the only type of a central obscurer that can explain the various aspects of agn unification ? can other structures help to resolve several of the known disagreements between simple torus models and observations ?",
    "an interesting scenario is based on the idea that a central disk can replace the torus @xcite .",
    "this ad - hoc phenomenological model is based on the idea that the angular momentum of the external inflowing gas is initially mis - aligned with the axis of the central accretion disk .",
    "the mis - alignment is kept down to very small distances , of order one pc , and the inflow takes the form of an inclined , large dusty geometrically thin disk , which may also be warped ( see @xcite for general mechanisms resulting in warped disks ) .",
    "the large disk presents a wide solid angle to the inner disk and part of the uv - optical radiation is absorbed and re - emitted in the ir .",
    "this simple geometry was used by @xcite to predict the covering factor distribution which was later studied by @xcite using  data of a large type - i sample .",
    "there seem to be a reasonable agreement between model and observations but the predicted is similar to a normal distribution , which is expected also in other scenarios .",
    "the main virtue of the tilted disk idea is the assumed mis - alignment between different accretion episodes onto the bh .",
    "this is expected in accretion events whose final stage take place in a region which is 23 orders of magnitude smaller than the region where the flow originates .",
    "unfortunately , the exact geometry has not been shown to be consistent with realistic hydrodynamical simulations , the location of the sublimation surface has not been calculated and compared with rm results , and there is no comparison with ir interferometry , ir sed and high quality polarization measurements .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "another is based on counting the number of broad and narrow emission line agns in optical and ir selected samples .",
    "ideally , all methods should agree but this is certainly not the case ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "the reasons range from the poorly understood physics of the torus , to various selection effects , uncertainties in estimating , intrinsic reddening , and more . for example",
    ", the /  method is based on dust emission from the torus and has little to do with blr properties .",
    "however , x - ray absorption by gas in the blr can increase the total measured x - ray column thus decreasing  since the ionizing radiation absorbed by the dust - free gas never interacts with the dusty torus . here",
    "i focus on the large sample approach , in particular on x - ray based studies .    the hard x - ray ( e@xmath154 kev ) spectrum of most agns can be described by a simple power - law , @xmath155 , where @xmath156 is the number of emitted photons per unit energy and time .",

    "some of the results obtained so far are hampered by selection effects .",
    "in particular , type - ii sources are more likely to drop below the flux limit of the samples because of the increased absorption .",
    "this is less noticeable , but still present , in samples selected by their very high energy flux @xcite .",
    "the hardness ratio method can fail , sometimes dramatically , if the absorption is due to two or more los components , such as a combination of blr clouds and a dusty torus gas (  4.2 )    a very detailed study of x - ray obscuration is @xcite .",

    "the complete redshift information is based on spectroscopy and photometry and is of crucial importance since it allows to use a simple k - correction and thus circumvent the well known bias of flux limited samples that tend to pick up more obscured sources at higher redshifts .",
    "a potential complication is a large number of compton thick sources that are unaccounted for .",
    "this number is still uncertain and depends on the survey , energy range used , and the spectroscopic analysis .",

    "a major one is , again , the confusion between host galaxy and torus obscuration which is related to the large group of type - ii sources .",
    "what is the redshift evolution of obscured and unobscured agn ?",

    "this finding is supported by several studies of agns in the  deep field south ( cdfs ) @xcite .",
    "there were several attempts to explain the dependence of covering factor on source luminosity based on the torus geometry .",
    "the idea of a `` receding torus '' , first suggested by @xcite , involves a very simple torus whose height , @xmath167 , is independent of the inner radius @xmath137 . since @xmath168@xmath169 , the covering factor",

    "the differences between the two lfs were explained to be due to changes in the torus covering factor with luminosity and were claimed to be removed if @xmath171 .",
    "unfortunately , the work does not take into account the fact that the conversion between l(5007 @xmath10 ) and  is luminosity dependent @xcite , a fact which was not known at the time .",
    "@xcite used the observed ew(k@xmath18 ) to suggest a somewhat different dependence .",
    "these attempts , and others , are highly simplified and should not be viewed as more than fits of simple analytic functions to the observations .",
    "the increased inner radius with luminosity is , indeed , a solid and confirmed prediction of all torus models .",
    "however , other parameters , like  and @xmath167 , are not well defined and there is no simple theoretical reason to prefer a certain geometry over others .    the idea of a luminosity dependent sublimation radius has also been used to argue that below a certain , the torus is likely to change its properties , and even disappear .",

    "@xcite followed the ideas developed in @xcite and considered the clumpy dust - free blr , and the clumpy dusty torus , as one entity made of clouds lifted along magnetic field lines from the surface of the disk . a limiting radial column density of @xmath180 @xmath25 ,",
    "was assumed to be a requirement for producing observable broad emission lines from the clumps .",
    "the work shows that at low mass accretion rate , corresponding to @xmath181 , blr clouds , and large dusty clumps , no longer exist .",
    "this luminosity , which varies with the black - hole mass , and the corresponding l_agn / l_edd @xmath2 , are in the right ball park for many liners but is several orders of magnitude smaller than the typical luminosity of many real type - ii agns @xcite .",
    "despite the discrepancy , the general idea can perhaps be extended to include more luminous sources with no detectable broad emission lines .",
    "detailed morphological studies of host galaxies of agns , up to redshift @xmath182 , reveal that about @xmath183% of them do not show signs of interaction ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "such studies depend on signal - to - noise , spatial resolution , and most importantly redshift .",
    "they should be interpreted as strong evidence against major mergers and perhaps not so strong evidence regarding the final stages of a minor merger where the mass ratio of the two hosts is large .",
    "the finding , which contradicts earlier claims about the association of most agn activity with galaxy mergers , is evidence for the importance of secular processes in transporting cold gas from the disk to the vicinity of the bh .",
    "the studies show also that a large fraction of the most luminous agns at high redshift are associated with mergers .",
    "indeed , merger induced nuclear activity is likely to be more common at very high redshift , when the density of the universe was higher and much of cold gas was not yet converted to stars .",
    "can simple unification based on relatively simple shaped tori , and well ordered motion of cold gas , be applied to the complex geometry of such mergers ? how early in the history of an agn triggered by a major merger can such an ordered central structure form ? can merger driven agns be classified like the secularly evolving systems if their blr is obscured by galactic scale dust ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and what are the implications to the nir - mir seds of such systems ?    major mergers of gas rich systems in the early universe have been suggested to result in powerful dusty sf systems ( dust - obscured galaxies , dogs ) surrounding a buried agn whose power is increasing with time ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . as the agn power increases , the surrounding gas is blown away and an unobscured agn is revealed .",
    "the most luminous agns during the era of peak agn activity , at z=23 , have been suggested to be objects of this type .",
    "the geometry of the obscuring dust in this case must be very different from the simple tori assumed in non - merging galaxies .",
    "unfortunately , numerical merger simulations do not yet have sufficient resolution to model the geometry of such structures and high resolution imaging is limited to nearby systems ( see however @xcite ) .",
    "thus , sed observations and model fitting are the best tools to investigate these scenarios , in particular in objects where both optical and ir information is available ( e.g. sdss and wise  see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "an empirical way to study such scenarios is to examine objects with very large /  and check whether this is caused by uv luminosity which is unusually low ( uv extinction in a dog ) or mir luminosity which is unusually high ( large covering factor and a clear los to the center ) .",
    "the work of @xcite suggests that the latter is correct and shows that the objects with the smallest /  are those with the largest l(uv ) .",
    "such studies show no evidence of the dog - related scenario in z=23 agns ( see however @xcite for evidence to the contrary ) .",
    "there are more detailed studies of merging systems at low and intermediate redshifts , especially ultra luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) hosting active bhs .",
    "a low redshift sample of this type is the quest ( quasar / ulirg evolutionary study ) sample ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "some of the sources in the sample contain low luminosity agns , including liners , and are clearly sf dominated systems .",
    "others contain high luminosity agns , mostly pg quasars ..",
    "hst imaging of quest sources indicate that the type of agn depends on the evolutionary stage of the host , and the bh activity is most likely triggered by the merger .",
    "in particular , there is evidence that a merger progresses from type - ii at the earlier stages , to type - i closer to its end .",
    "i agns become more and more common among fully - coalesced merger remnants with elliptical - like hosts @xcite .",
    "they also become more common with increasing . this may or may not be related to the general trend of decreasing obscuration with increasing l(210 kev ) discussed for non - merging systems .",
    "many of the quest sources have been observed , spectroscopically , by _",
    "spitzer_. interestingly , their comparison with sources that show no indication of mergers @xcite shows very similar seds and a similar trend of decreasing covering factor with .",
    "can major mergers at high redshift produce galactic - scale obscuration that results in torus like sed and absorption ? can heating by the agn result in cold ( 3050 k ) dust emission that mimics sf regions",
    "? there are no clear observational answers to these questions but recent calculations by @xcite are already giving some clues .",
    "a complex geometry that can give rise to both mir and fir emission , is a `` torus within a torus '' or `` an obscurer within an obscurer '' . in this scenario , a large covering factor obscurer , just outside the dust sublimation radius , results in intense nir - mir emission .",
    "this obscurer is clumpy and has a simple axisymmetric geometry .",
    "part of the agn radiation escapes through its ionization cones and part leaks out through the clumps .",
    "a much larger obscurer , with an undefined geometry that does not block the central dust - free cone , is present at a distance of a few kpc .",
    "the covering factor of the inner obscurer is ( in ) and the one of the outer obscurer ( out ) .",
    "it is easy to think of several scenarios that result in different relative l(fir)/l(mir)/ , depending on how much radiation of the central source leaks through the small obscurer near the center .",
    "it is also possible that some of the mir radiation of the central obscurer is absorbed by the further dust , if its optical depth is large enough .",
    "a certain variant of this complex geometry was modeled by @xcite who found that such a geometry with ( in)@xmath184 , gives a reasonable fit to the observed sed of a specific z=6.4 agn . in that particular model ,",
    "about half of the fir luminosity is agn - related and half sf - related .",
    "an obvious observational test would be to obtain polarimetry maps of such systems since this is a most effective way to check whether the distribution of the position angles is centrosymmetric ( i.e. scattering from a central point ) or not ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in summary , it is hard to imagine that major mergers , especially in the early universe , can lead to the highly ordered geometry , and the torus - like structure , suggested to explain the observations of lower luminosity , secularly evolving systems .",
    "detailed sed studies of high redshift mergers can help to resolve this issue .",
    "the unification scheme presented in this review is different in some ways , and similar in others , to the scheme presented in the late 1980 that had three fundamental pillars : orientation , covering factor and luminosity .",
    "the field is driven by courageous attempts to construct simple models for complex situations , and attempts to understand sever selection effects typical of large samples .",
    "the most important developments of the last decade or so can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "most agn tori are probably axisymmetric and clumpy .",
    "unfortunately , todays phenomenological clumpy torus models leave much to be desired and their parameters are hard to constrain .",
    "hydrodynamical calculations that follow the inflow of gas from the galaxy , are more promising .",
    "they naturally produce a clumpy thick central structure and demonstrate the importance of sn explosions , and radiation pressure feedback by the central agn .",
    "the simulations do not yet include all relevant processes and are generally limited to agns with small bhs .",
    "2 .   disk - wind models of different types seem to be able to explain several fundamental properties of the central obscurer , like the formation of dust - free and dusty clumps at roughly the desired locations .",
    "so far , there is no clear preference for magnetic or radiation pressure driven winds and there is a general problem , in all models , to form and maintain large column density clumps .",
    "the central issues of torus covering factor and anisotropy are not yet fully understood .",
    "the general trend of decreasing  with increasing  is confirmed but its details not well understood .",
    "there are substantial disagreements between the various methods used to study this relationship , like the ones based on / , on ew(k@xmath18 ) , or the division of the population into groups based on x - ray absorbing columns .",
    "the suggestion of a receding torus is the only idea driving this field .",
    "however , the idea is neither physically sound nor well understood .",
    "4 .   study of ionization cones and ir interferometry are two major developments in this field .",
    "bicone observations provide the most reliable way to define the torus boundaries and link the emission line properties to the kinematic properties of the nlr gas .",
    "long baseline interferometry is the way of the future .",
    "it has already provided global intriguing results , like an unexpected run of dust temperature with radius and model - images that indicate deviations from a simple torus - shaped obscurer .",
    "they also stress the need to reconsider the role of mir emitting polar outflows .",
    "future phase information will likely provide real images of central agn tori .",
    "part of the confusion in the present unification scheme is the presence of several sub - groups that may not belong in it in the first place . in particular , `` real type - ii agns '' , that are not really understood , confuse several issues like the fraction of obscured and unobscured low luminosity agns .",
    "another group that shows a mixed bag of properties are type - ii agns .",
    "some of these sources are heavily extinguished by dust in the host galaxy , others are type - is `` caught '' during a time of minimum agn activity .",
    "unification does not seem to stand the test of bh evolution .",
    "in particular , merging systems likely behave in a different way from agns in secularly evolving hosts .",
    "based on todays observations , there is no reason to believe that accreting bhs in major mergers , or merger remnants , partake in the simple , old unification scheme .    returning to the central theme of unification",
    ", it is clear that the old scheme requires several major revisions .",
    "the more important ones are the recognition that for a given luminosity there is a large range of covering factors , the realization that x - ray absorption can be caused by two and possibly more components , and the identification of several sub - groups of agns that do not belong in this scheme in the first place .",
    "a revised scheme would require better ways to isolate and remove cases where obscuration has nothing to do with the nucleus , and improved x - ray techniques to clarify the importance of x - ray absorption by dust - free gas .",
    "perhaps the most crucial aspect , which is observationally challenging , is the separation of torus absorption from the presence of broad emission lines . putting the absorption of the non - stellar continuum in the center of the scheme , and minimizing the use of broad emission lines as a major characteristics , are good ways to proceed .",
    "the author is not aware of any affiliations , memberships , funding , or financial holdings that might be perceived as affecting the objectivity of this review .",
    "this review benefitted from comments and suggestions by colleagues and friends who shared with me their broad knowledge and deep understanding of this field .",
