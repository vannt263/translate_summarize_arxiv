    "the existence of neutrino masses and leptonic mixing has been firmly established by neutrino oscillation experiments  @xcite .",
    "however there is no convincing theory to explain their origin and several questions remain to be answered  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "neutrinos can be dirac or majorana particles , and the cp symmetry can be violated in the lepton sector .",
    "furthermore , the absolute neutrino mass scale and type of mass spectrum ( normal or inverted hierarchy ) are still unknown .",
    "a common approach towards the solution of the flavor puzzle consists on requiring some of the elements in the leptonic mass matrices to vanish , leading to the so - called texture zeros .",
    "it is well known that such zeros can be enforced in arbitrary entries of the fermion mass matrices by means of abelian symmetries  @xcite . moreover , combining the canonical and smith normal form methods  @xcite , it is possible to construct viable patterns in a minimal framework , i.e. with the smallest discrete abelian group and a minimal number of higgs scalars .",
    "for instance , these two methods have been successfully employed to construct the minimal abelian symmetry realizations of the well - known frampton - glashow - marfatia two - zero neutrino textures  @xcite and to study their implementation in extensions of the standard model ( sm ) based on the seesaw mechanism for the neutrino masses  @xcite .",
    "recently , a complete survey of texture zeros in the lepton mass matrices has been performed  @xcite . admitting all possible combinations of patterns with zeros , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite concluded that several classes of texture zeros in the charged - lepton and neutrino mass matrices are compatible with current neutrino oscillation data at @xmath1 confidence level ( cl ) . in this paper , we reconsider this problem with the aim of identifying the maximally restrictive pairs of leptonic mass matrices with zero entries that are not only compatible with observations but also realizable in terms of abelian symmetries . in this context , by maximally restrictive we mean that no additional zero can be placed into one of the two lepton mass matrices while keeping compatibility with the observed lepton masses and mixing data .",
    "since none of the textures can be implemented through such symmetries in the sm , we shall consider one of its simplest extensions , namely the two - higgs - doublet model ( 2hdm )  @xcite .",
    "we also assume that neutrinos are majorana particles .",
    "the ultraviolet ( uv ) completion of these models is then implemented in the framework of the seesaw mechanism for neutrino masses .",
    "a detailed analysis of texture zeros in the charged - lepton mass matrix @xmath2 and the effective majorana neutrino mass matrix @xmath3 has been carried out in ref .",
    "in particular , it has been shown that , without imposing any correlation among the mass matrix elements , at least eight physical parameters are required to explain the eight experimentally known observables ( three charged - lepton masses , two neutrino mass - squared differences and three mixing angles ) . moreover ,",
    "several combinations of texture zeros in the pairs of mass matrices @xmath4 were found viable at @xmath1 cl  ( see  @xcite for further details ) .    in this section , we shall look for @xmath4 pairs that contain maximally restrictive texture zeros and , simultaneously , are compatible with observations at @xmath0 cl . we shall perform a @xmath5-analysis using the standard function @xmath6 where @xmath7 denotes the physical input parameters ( i.e. the matrix elements of @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) , @xmath8 are the predictions of the model for the observables @xmath9 , @xmath10 are the best - fit values of @xmath9 , and @xmath11 their corresponding @xmath12 errors .",
    "we use the current global fit of neutrino oscillation data at @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "we also impose the recent cosmological constraint on the sum of the neutrino masses , namely @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) at 95% cl  @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    in our search for a viable charged - lepton mass matrix @xmath2",
    ", we require that the eigenvalues of the input matrix correctly reproduce the central values of the charged - lepton masses  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath5-function is then minimized with respect to the five neutrino observables ( two neutrino mass - squared differences and three mixing angles ) using minuit  @xcite and the numerical strategy presented in ref .",
    "since current neutrino data does not constrain the dirac cp - violating phase @xmath15 at @xmath0 ( i.e. @xmath15 is allowed to vary between 0 and @xmath16 ) , we do not fit it in our analysis . if the deviation of each neutrino observable from its experimental value is at most @xmath0 at the minimum of @xmath5 for a given @xmath4-pair , the corresponding leptonic textures are said to be compatible with data .    from our @xmath5-analysis , several charged - lepton and majorana neutrino mass matrices resulted in pairs of maximally restrictive textures ( i.e. with 8 physical parameters ) compatible with data at @xmath0 cl .",
    "these patterns are presented in tables  [ table1 ] and [ table2 ] .",
    "note that we have kept the notation of ref .",
    "@xcite for the labeling of the textures .",
    "the corresponding minimum of @xmath5 for the viable pairs of leptonic textures is given in table  [ table3 ] .",
    "there are 19 pairs of leptonic matrices that can successfully accommodate the data .",
    "the lowest value of @xmath5 was attained for the matrix combinations @xmath17 and @xmath18 . in all cases ,",
    "the neutrino mass spectrum has an inverted ordering , i.e. @xmath19 . moreover , the six viable four - zero neutrino textures , @xmath20 , contain a null row and a null column , thus leading to a massless neutrino ( @xmath21 ) .",

    "the analysis performed so far assumes the existence of the weinberg operator defined in eq .  .",
    "the dynamics behind this operator has not been specified . as long as the uv completion of the maximally restrictive leptonic textures does not break the effective symmetry ,",
    "our conclusions remain unchanged . in order to make this statement more definite ,",
    "we shall present two possible uv completions in the context of type - i and type - ii seesaw models .",
    "we shall start with the easiest uv completion of these models , i.e. through the type - ii seesaw mechanism . in this framework ,",
    "several @xmath53 triplet scalars @xmath54 with hypercharge @xmath55 are added to the theory , @xmath56 the relevant lagrangian terms read @xmath57 where the sum over latin indexes is implicitly assumed .",
    "once the heavy states with masses @xmath58 are decoupled , the effective coupling matrix reads @xmath59 the presence of the trilinear couplings @xmath60 is fundamental in the type - ii seesaw , as can be seen in the above formula . for such couplings to be present , @xmath61 has to transform under the flavor symmetry as @xmath62 .",
    "therefore , if we take as an example the scenario @xmath63 , we must have @xmath64 the same procedure can be applied for any effective implementation , making the type - ii seesaw a trivial path for the uv completion of these models .",
    "we can also envisage an uv completion within the framework of the type - i seesaw mechanism .",
    "however , due to the non - trivial correlation between the uv couplings and the effective neutrino mass matrix , such an implementation may not be viable for all the effective models studied .",
    "let us consider , for instance , the effective model @xmath65 with the symmetry transformations given in eqs .   and  .",
    "we can implement this model in a type - i seesaw framework adding 3 right - handed neutrinos @xmath66 ( @xmath14 ) , which transform appropriately under the flavor symmetry .",
    "the requirement that these new fields decouple at low energies implies that the heavy majorana neutrino mass matrix @xmath67 is non - singular .",
    "together with the constraints at the effective level coming from the @xmath3 texture , this leads to the following symmetry transformation : @xmath68 the lagrangian for the neutrino sector can be written as @xmath69 where the dirac neutrino yukawa couplings are given by @xmath70 and the heavy neutrino mass matrix is @xmath71 after the decoupling of the heavy neutrinos , we recover the effective lagrangian in eq .  ,",
    "with the coupling @xmath72 predicted by the underlying dynamics , @xmath73 from the above textures we can easily verify that @xmath74 is the null texture , while @xmath75 and @xmath76 correspond to the two @xmath77 textures found in eq .",
    ", respectively .",
    "we now turn our attention to the quarks .",
    "our aim is to implement the same abelian symmetries in the quark sector without introducing new higgs scalars . depending on the charge assignments ,",
    "different models can emerge , as shown in table  [ table5 ] .",
    "notice that in the commonly used classification all right - handed fermions of a given charge couple to a single higgs doublet .",
    "our convention slightly differs from the standard one , since in the models studied here the lepton fields must couple to both higgs doublets . for the quark fields we choose natural flavor conserving scenarios , i.e. only a single higgs doublet couples to each quark sector .",
    "in particular , models labeled type ia and type iia in the table have the same implementation in the quark sector as in the standard type - i and type - ii models , respectively .",
    "thus , for such scenarios we can use the current experimental constraints in order to study their viability .",
    "cccccc + model & @xmath78 & @xmath79 & @xmath80 & @xmath81 & textures +   + type ia&@xmath82 & @xmath82 & @xmath83 & & + type iia & @xmath82 & @xmath84 & @xmath83 & & + type ib & @xmath84 & @xmath84 & @xmath83 & & + type iib & @xmath84 & @xmath82 & @xmath83 & & +    from table  [ table5 ] , we conclude that the symmetry implementation in a type - ia or type - iia 2hdm framework requires a large @xmath81 to guarantee the perturbativity of the top - quark yukawa coupling . in both cases ,",
    "the solutions @xmath85 could be allowed . however , in the type - iia case the down - quark sector couples only to @xmath86 and recent bounds on the weak radiative decay @xmath87 imply @xmath88  gev at 95% cl  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the four solutions are excluded in type - iia scenarios ( cf . figs .  [ fig1]-[fig3 ] ) .    despite the above restrictions",
    ", the abelian symmetry can be easily implemented in a type - ia 2hdm framework . in this case , the bound on @xmath89 is weaker than the lep one ( @xmath90  gev ) for values of @xmath91  .",
    "the quark yukawa lagrangian reads @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the @xmath53 quark doublet .",
    "the yukawa matrix couplings @xmath94 and @xmath95 , associated with the down- and up - quark sectors , respectively , are general @xmath96 complex matrices .",
    "this implementation simply corresponds to a sm - like yukawa sector for quarks and , therefore , it is protected from the presence of any fcnc .",
    "the symmetry implementation is now quite trivial ; we only need to request that @xmath97 transforms with the opposite charge of @xmath98 and @xmath99 with the same charge of @xmath98 .",
    "thus , once the maximally restrictive textures of the leptonic sector are implemented , the lagrangian terms in eq .",
    "can be constructed imposing the quark field transformations    @xmath100    for each viable texture pair .",
    "in this paper , we have considered the problem of implementing maximally restrictive texture zeros in the leptonic sector in the context of two - higgs - doublet models with majorana neutrinos .",
    "we have analyzed all maximally restrictive pairs of leptonic mass matrices with zero entries and concluded that only four pairs of charged - lepton and neutrino mass matrices , namely , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 , are compatible with observations at @xmath0 and can be simultaneously implemented through an abelian symmetry with only two higgs doublets .",
    "we have also investigated whether the viable textures are in agreement with current bounds on lepton - flavor - violating processes .",
    "in particular , we have considered the universality in @xmath105 lepton decays mediated by the charged higgs scalar at tree level , the lepton - flavor - violating decays @xmath106 mediated by the neutral higgs scalars at tree level , and the decay processes @xmath107 mediated by both neutral and charged higgs scalars at the one - loop level .",
    "the conclusions are summarized in figures  [ fig1]-[fig4 ] .",
    "our results turn out to be quite restrictive and predictive . out of the 19 pairs of maximally",
    "restrictive leptonic matrices with 8 physical parameters , only 4 pairs ( 6 combinations ) can be implemented through an abelian symmetry within the two - higgs - doublet model .",
    "the feasible textures lead to an inverted hierarchical spectrum for the light neutrinos and definite predictions for the dirac cp - violating observable phase and the effective majorana mass in @xmath108 decay , as shown in fig .  [ fig5 ] .    by enlarging the number of higgs doublets we could open the possibility for constructing new pairs of leptonic mass matrices .",
    "nevertheless , we have shown that , in a minimal setup , there are already a few viable scenarios .",
    "the latter can be easily completed at the ultraviolet level in the context of the well - known seesaw mechanism through the addition of right - handed singlet neutrinos or the introduction of scalar triplets .",
    "the models presented here stem from symmetries and , therefore , they contain a reduced number of free parameters .",
    "once the current experimental constraints are imposed , these models typically lead to definite predictions .",
    "finally , we recall once more that the possibility of implementing each set of maximally restrictive textures in the context of 2hdm is a consequence of the existence of an effective abelian symmetry .",
    "any uv completion respecting this symmetry will clearly lead to the same type of predictions .",
