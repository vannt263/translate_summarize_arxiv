    "mathematical modelling of infectious diseases is an interdisciplinary area of increasing interest . since the pioneering work of kermack and mckendrick @xcite , mathematical modelling has shown to be a powerful tool to understand infectious disease transmission @xcite .",
    "the fact that the simple deterministic sir model , where the population is divided into susceptible ( s ) , infective ( i ) and immune or recovered ( r ) individuals , is able to predict quite well the outbreak periods for a large series of infectious diseases in many countries around the world suggests that it captures the essentials of transmission dynamics @xcite .",
    "lately , models gained an increasing level of complexity , including age structure and particular features of the given disease , with the aim of being more realistic and predictive @xcite . due to the complexities of these models , stochastic effects and the network structure of contacts",
    "are rarely considered . however , when considered ( in much more simple models ) stochastic effects have shown to play an important role in understanding the data of reported cases of measles and pertussis @xcite .",
    "more recently , the effect of the network structure of contacts on the disease transmission has been considered in several publications , always in models with very few epidemiological classes @xcite . in particular , in refs .",
    "@xcite the authors studied the spatial correlations and stochastic fluctuations using sir and seir models on two - dimensional watts - strogatz - type dynamical networks .",
    "@xcite focussed on the power spectrum of the fraction of infective time series and performed an extensive study of parameter space for the sir model .",
    "they found that spatial correlations and the deterministic recovery of infection increase the amplitude and coherence of the resonant stochastic fluctuations and studied the dependence of such changes on model parameters .    in the present work ,",
    "we use the sir stochastic model on two - dimesional watts - strogatz - type dynamical networks and perform an intensive study of the model for parameters corresponding to pertussis disease ( whooping cough ) in the pre - vaccine era .",
    "we carry out simulations for different parameters characterizing the network properties and study their influence on the behaviour of the quasi - stationary state of the system corresponding to the endemic disease with periodic outbreaks .",
    "the purpose of our work is twofold . on the one hand",
    ", we assume the disease is propagating in a place with a well - mixed population , and then , for some reason , the network of contacts changes and becomes more local .",
    "we analyzed the consequences of this change in disease transmission .",
    "on the other hand , we focus on a methodological point .",
    "suppose the disease is propagating in a city where local contacts are important , but a sir stochastical model disregarding network structure is used .",
    "how bad is the description of the problem in this case if you parametrize the model to available epidemiological data ?",
    "we consider a stochastic sir model on watts - strogatz dynamic - type networks as the ones studied by verdasca _",
    "_ @xcite and simes _ et al .",
    "our setup of the model is summarized below .",
    "first , we describe the underlying sir deterministic model with births and deaths .      in this model it is assumed that individuals are in one of the following three epidemiological classes : susceptible , infected or recovered .",
    "individuals are born in a susceptible class at a rate @xmath0 and they remain there until they become infected by contact with an infected individual . infected individuals recover from infection entering the recovered class at a rate @xmath1 .",
    "the dynamic variables of the model are the fractions of the population in each epidemiological class , and they obey the following set of non - linear coupled differential equations :    & = -s i + - s + [ eqsdeterm ] & = s i - i - i + & = i - r    where @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the fractions of people in susceptible , infected and recovered classes respectively . in this model",
    "the term @xmath5 represents the incidence per individual of the disease ( the rate at which susceptible individuals become infected ) and contains the key approximation of the model : uniform mixing .",
    "parameter @xmath6 is the rate of infective contacts ( which are the contacts such that if one individual is infected and the other susceptible , the latter will become infected ) .",
    "so , in the uniform mixing approximation it is assumed that all susceptible individuals become infected at the same rate : @xmath7 . in this model",
    "the death rate is assumed equal for people in the three epidemiological classes and also equal to the birth rate , @xmath0 , in order to keep the population constant .",
    "the set of differential equations [ eqsdeterm ] determines the dynamic evolution of the system . for any initial conditions different from i=0 ( when the system goes towards the fixed point : @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) , the system asymptotically reaches the stationary state : @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 .",
    "we consider n individuals on a squared lattice ( lxl = n ) with periodic boundary conditions . at each site",
    "there is an individual that may be in one of the 3 epidemiological states : s ( suscepible ) , i ( infected ) or r ( recovered ) .",
    "the state of an individual at site @xmath14 is a stochastic variable of the model , @xmath15 , that may change through the following processes :    & infection : & s i & & & & & & & + & recovering : & i r & & & & & & & + & death  and  birth : & s s & & & & & & & + & & i s & & & & & & & + & & r s & & & & & & &    we assume that when an individual dies at a site , another individual is born at the same time at this site in order to keep every site with one individual during the simulation . as we suppose markovian processes , the dynamics of the system",
    "is controlled by the knowledge of probability transition rates at each time .",
    "deaths and births are independent of the individual state and occur at the same probability rate @xmath0 . to account for infections we consider a dynamic type of watts - strogatz network @xcite .",
    "we assume that , at a given time , an individual at site @xmath14 has contact with a randomly chosen individual in the network with probability rate @xmath16 , and with one of their @xmath17 nearest neighbours with probability rate @xmath18 .",
    "if the individual at site @xmath14 is susceptible , and the contacted individual is infected , then the individual at site @xmath14 will become infected .",
    "local contacts of an individual represent the contacts with known people ( in the circle of their stable relations ) while global random contacts represent people met by chance ( for example , on a bus , shopping , etc ) . actually , here",
    "the word `` contact '' is restricted to `` infective contacts '' , in the sense discussed above for the sir model .",
    "the model used in the present work allows changing the degree of  locality \" of the network by changing the value of parameter @xmath19 .",
    "in particular , for @xmath20 an individual only has contacts with their @xmath17 nearest neighbours while for @xmath21 an individual may contact any other individual in the lattice with the same probability as in the classical stochastic sir model ( uniform mixing ) .",
    "this is an important difference with the standard ( static ) watts - strogatz setting @xcite where the case @xmath21 corresponds to a random network where an individual has a fixed number @xmath17 ( @xmath22n ) of random contacts .",
    "recovery from infection is the same in every site and occurs at a probability rate @xmath1 .",

    "the process and the time when it takes place are generated from simple rules and two random numbers ( see ref .",

    "nevertheless , for n large enough , the system may fluctuate for a long time around a quasi - stationary state ( qss ) before extinction .",
    "the definition and properties of such a state have been addressed in other contexts from a mathematical point of view @xcite or with empirical approaches @xcite . in the present work",

    "moreover , the size of the fluctuations ( and thereby the probability of extinctions ) as well as @xmath32 , depend on the parameters that define network properties : @xmath19 and @xmath17 .",
    "then , the time window where a qss of the system could be defined has to be determined with some care .    _ estimation of extinction times _",

    "our study of the sir model on a watts - strogatz - type network , for parameters corresponding to pertussis in the pre - vaccine era , shows that network structure strongly influences the disease dynamics .",
    "the increasing locality of the network ( obtained by lowering @xmath19 ) decreases the disease transmission .",
    "this effect has already been observed by other authors @xcite who attributed it to the clustering of infected individuals produced by local correlations . in the present work we quantified this concept obtaining an explicit relation between the effective transmission rate , @xmath97 , and correlation coefficients between s and i individuals ( eqs . [ beffcorr ] and [ coefcorr ] ) .",
    "an increase in locality also drastically increases fluctuations and the period between outbreaks , which have been analyzed characterizing the probability density functions of fraction of infected individuals , @xmath108 , and the power spectrum of the @xmath3-time series , @xmath123 .",
    "we analyzed whether the network plays another role in the behaviour of the system at the quasi - stationary state _ besides _ the change in the effective transmission rate of the disease .",
    "our findings are summarized below :    * the average fractions of susceptible , infected and recovered individuals at the qss have the same values as in the sir deterministic model if @xmath6 parameter is replaced by @xmath97  of the corresponding network .",
    "therefore , for @xmath91  and @xmath65 , the network structure may be ignored if a single parameter is changed properly . * concerning fluctuations and the time - correlated behaviour of the system , the situation is highly dependent on the sir - model parameters taken .",
    "in particular , if we consider different networks taking the appropiate value for @xmath6 in order to obtain @xmath97=0.8 , fluctuations in the fraction of infected individuals and their time correlations are very similar as those of the stochastic sir model ( @xmath21 ) for all the networks considered ( fig .",
    "[ figpi]d and fig .",
    "[ figpw]b ) .",
    "however , network effects are not completely absorbed by @xmath97  in this case .    from these remarks",
    "we are able to answer the question we raised in the introduction : if we want to describe pertussis transmission in the pre - vaccine era , what is lost if we use a sir stochastic model with homogenous mixing instead of a sir stochastic model on the network with determined values of @xmath17 , @xmath19 and @xmath6 ?",
    "the answer is : very little . in order to parametrize both models , what can be taken from epidemiological data",
    "is the basic reproductive ratio @xmath126 that , for pertussis in the prevaccine era , is between 16 and 18 @xcite and may be obtained from the average fraction of susceptibles , @xmath91 , through the relation : @xmath126=1/@xmath91  @xcite . as for the studied systems @xmath91=@xmath97/@xmath127 , epidemiological data fixes",
    "@xmath97  ( not @xmath6 ) around 0.8 .",
    "if the sir stochastic model ( @xmath19=1 ) is used , the frequency of outbreaks would be a bit underestimated with respect to the prediction of a network with @xmath30 ( fig .",
    "[ figpw]b ) .",
    "but it would be very difficult to infer the proper @xmath128 combination from measurable quantities .",
    "for example , it is very unlikely that with a power spectrum constructed from a time series of 20 or 30 years it will be possible to choose among one of the curves of fig .",
    "[ figpw]b .",
    "in fact , given the high heterogeneity in the time series obtained as output of the model ( fig . [ figit ] ) care should be taken when analyzing real data . if the sir stochastic model is proposed to describe the dynamics of pertussis in the pre - vaccine era and in cities of the size considered in the present work , the differences observed in the incidence time series in different countries might be due to the heterogeneity of the time profile itself and not to differences in the epidemiological conditions at each place @xcite .",
    "it would be of great interest to know whether these conclusions may be extended to more complicated and realistic models .",
    "in particular , epidemiological and laboratory studies suggest that immunity acquired by pertussis infection is not lifelong ( see ref . @xcite and references therein ) and more realistic models of pertussis transmission include compartments that account for waning immunity @xcite .",
    "we find it appropriate to emphasize that the results and conclusions obtained in this work hold : a ) for the sir stochastic model in the dynamical networks with local and global contacts as described in section 2.2 , b ) for the set of parameters used that corresponds to pertussis disease in the pre - vaccine era and c ) for the quasi - stationary state of the system , as empirically defined in section 3.1 .",
    "extrapolations to other problems that share _ only some _ features with the ones treated in the present work are not straightforward and require caution .",
    "we expect relations ( 14 ) , ( 16 ) and ( 18 ) concerning stationary values to hold independently of the parameters used provided that the quasi - stationary state has been established .",
    "but concerning fluctuations we have not obtained general relations and we do not expect that conclusions from the results presented here will be valid for systems with parameters representing other infectious diseases .",
    "there are several open questions related to the present work that could be addressed in future research .",
    "in particular , it would be interesting to know whether our description of the system at the quasi - stationary state with a beta - rescaled stochastic sir model could be extended to other model parameters . moreover",
    ", it would be interesting to study whether our description also holds in the approach to the steady state .",
    "the problem of constructing mean field approximations to describe the approach and behavior of epidemic systems in the steady state has been studied for the sirs model on static two - dimensional watts strogatz networks by roy _",
    "et al_. @xcite . concerning the comparison between static and dynamical networks , in ref .",
    "@xcite zanette studied the dynamics of rumor propagation with an sir - type model ( without mortality ) in standard ( 1d ) watts strogatz network and in its dynamical version defined as in the present work .",
    "they found that the qualitative behavior of propagation is the same in both networks but that the effectiveness of propagation is considerably higher in the dynamical one .",
    "this sort of comparison would be interesting for infectious disease transmission modeling because both effects of the @xmath19-parameter ( randomness and globality ) could be analyzed separately . while in static networks @xmath19 defines the average fraction of fixed random contacts , in dynamical networks @xmath19 also measures the degree of globality of social contacts ( contacts with any individual in the population ) .",
    "finally , it has to be mentioned , that our definition of @xmath97  ( eq . [ defbeff ] ) differs from that of refs . @xcite and @xcite where @xmath97= @xmath129 . in any case",
    ", both definitions throw very similar results for all the networks considered in this work ( the relative difference is always below 0.3% ) .",
