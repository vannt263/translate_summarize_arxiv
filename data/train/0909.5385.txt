    "for the majority of galaxies in the universe , the analysis of the stellar content is restricted to the integrated light of their stellar populations , where a small percentage of luminous stars can change the spectra dramatically and bias the final results . a way to overcome",
    "this bias is to use a multiwavelength approach , since the fractional contribution from different stars varies along the spectral range .",
    "however , most of the observational effort has focused on the optical range , mainly due to the scarcity of appropriate instrumentation in other spectral regions .",
    "especially interesting is the study of the near - infrared ( near - ir ) window , where red supergiants in young populations ( @xmath1  gyr ) , asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars in intermediate - age populations ( @xmath2  gyr ) , and the tip of the red giant branch ( rgb ) stars in the near - ir are the main contributors , as opposed to turn - off dwarfs and stars at the lower part of the rgb in the optical .",
    "thus , near - ir spectroscopy may allow a breaking of the degeneracy between multiple stellar populations that plagues optical absorption - line strength studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , the near - ir wavelength range is less affected by line blanketing effects than other spectral intervals .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter mq08 ) presented a detailed study of the co band at 2.3  @xmath3 m as a function of the basic stellar atmospheric parameters ( effective temperature , surface gravity and metallicity ) using a a new spectral library of stars in the k band .",
    "this work confirmed that this co absorption band is sensitive to metallicity and it also shows good evidence for increased co absorption strength in agb stars compared to non - agb stars ( see figure  14 in mq08 and figure  [ fig1 ] in this letter ) .",
    "these results confirm the suitability of the co index for stellar population studies .",
    "furthemore , in this spectral range there is a prominent absorption feature at 2.2  @xmath3 m mainly due to sodium and scandium @xcite .",
    "this feature is very sensitive to effective temperature of the stars .",
    "once that parameter is fixed , agb and rgb stars show very similar values ( see figure  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the study of galaxies in different environments is a powerfull tool to understand their evolution and star formation history ( e.g. , snchez - blzquez et al .",

    ", we investigate possible differences in their stellar populations comparing the more prominent absorption features in the k - band .",
    "only a few detailed studies have been presented in this spectral range after the pioneering photometric work by @xcite and @xcite in early - type galaxies . the first detailed spectroscopic analysis in the k - band of these galaxies depending on their environmnet",
    "was presented by @xcite , who used the strength of the first co band at 2.3  @xmath3 m as an indicator of the presence of agb stars and , therefore , of an intermediate - age population in elliptical galaxies .",
    "they explored the influence of environment finding , initially , a systematic difference between field and cluster galaxies that was later contradicted in @xcite , when the authors enlarged their sample .",
    "they also studied the co strength in coma cluster galaxies @xcite finding variations in the strength of this feature as a function of cluster - centric distance , with more distant galaxies showing deeper co absorption .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter s08 ) observed a sample of 11 early - type galaxies ( see table  [ table ] ) in the fornax cluster , and analyzed several line - strength indices ( nai , cai , @xmath4 and co ) in the k band .",
    "for those galaxies showing no trace of young or intermediate - age populations , they found a strong correlation between nai and co with velocity dispersion ( @xmath5 ) , as well as between those indices and the optical metallicity indicator [ mgfe]@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "however , the galaxies with young populations in their sample separate from the global trends .",
    "more recently , @xcite obtained low resolution espectra for 14 early - type galaxies and confirmed the relation between the near - ir and the optical features .    to unravel possible differences in the stellar content of galaxies in different environments ,",
    "we analyze a sample of elliptical galaxies located in low density environments ( hereafter _ field _ galaxies ) in comparison with the fornax galaxy sample presented by s08 .",
    "this letter presents the first results of this spectroscopic study , focusing on the nai and the co indices .",
    "the rest of the indices , as well as a detailed description of the data reduction , will be presented in a forthcoming paper ( mrmol - queralt et al . , 2009 , in preparation ) . in   2 we describe the data used in this study , while the results and discussion are presented in   3 and   4 , respectively",
    "finally , in   5 we present the main conclusions derived from this work .",
    "long - slit spectra for 12 early - type field galaxies ( see table  [ table ] ) from the samples of @xcite and @xcite plus 2 fornax galaxies from s08 ( for comparison purposes ) were obtained with the isaac near - ir imaging spectrometer mounted at 8.2  m ut1/antu telescope at cerro de paranal ( chile ) with exactly the same instrumental configuration employed by s08 .",
    "thus , both samples can be readily compared .",
    "the field galaxy sample was chosen to cover a range in @xmath5 similar to that spanned by s08 s fornax sample .",
    "the spectrometer was used in medium - resolution mode ( sws1  mr ) , providing a resolution of 7.1   at @xmath7 m ( fwhm ) with a reciprocal dispersion of 1.21   / pixel for a @xmath8 slit .",
    "the central wavelength was chosen for each galaxy to include both nai features and the first co band ( @xmath9 m and @xmath10 m at restframe , respectively ) . for each object ,",
    "several exposures along the slit ( a and b positions ) were taken for sky substraction , as is the usual practice for infrared observations .",
    "the slit was oriented along the minor axis of the galaxies when possible .",
    "after each galaxy set , a nearby a - type star was observed for relative flux calibration and telluric correction . finally , halogen lamps ( on and off ) and arc lamps were observed for flat - fielding , and c - distortion correction and wavelength calibration , respectively .",
    "we carried out a standard data reduction in the infrared using @xcite .",
    "the details of the process will be presented in a forthcoming paper .",
    "galaxy spectra were extracted within a radius corresponding to @xmath11 at the observed position angle for each galaxy , where @xmath12 is the effective radius .",
    "we measured the nai index @xcite and the d@xmath0  index ( mq08 ) .",
    "the nai measurements were corrected for broadening effects using the @xmath5-correction computed by s08 , while the d@xmath0  index is almost insensitive to this effect ( see mq08 ) . in table  [ table ] we list these measurements for all the galaxies , together with the central velocity dispersion ( @xmath5 ) computed for each galaxy from these infrared spectra .",
    "previous optical work is available for all galaxies .",
    "the optical lick / ids indices mgb , c4668 and h@xmath13  were measured on the spectra extracted within a radius corresponding to @xmath11 in the original data by @xcite ( see also * ? ? ? * ) for the field galaxies . for fornax",
    "cluster galaxies , mgb and h@xmath13  were taken from s08 ( measured on the spectra extracted within @xmath11 ) and c4668 from @xcite ( original data ) .",
    "all these optical indices have also been included in table  [ table ] .",
    "since there are no reliable stellar population models available describing the behaviour of the near - ir indices used in this study , we will interpret the measured features by comparing them with other , better understood , indices . due to the very strong correlation between metallicity and @xmath5 for fornax elliptical galaxies @xcite",
    ", we use @xmath5 as a `` proxy '' for global metallicity in these galaxies . as a `` proxy '' for the mean age",
    ", we will use the h@xmath13  index , which is an indicator of the temperature of the turn - off and , therefore , mainly sensitive to the presence of young stellar populations ( between @xmath14 and @xmath15 yr ",
    "e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows the behaviour of different indices against @xmath5 ( left column ) and h@xmath13  ( right column ) .",
    "we note that the number of galaxies analyzed here is small and , therefore , our results might not necessarily apply to all early - type galaxies    there is a clear correlation between the indices mgb , c4668 , nai , d@xmath0 , and @xmath5 for the fornax galaxies ( already shown by @xcite for the optical indices and s08 for the near - ir features ) . for the field sample",
    ", the indices mgb , c4668 and nai are also correlated with @xmath5 , and these relations exhibit a larger scatter than the ones obtained for the fornax sample ( see a quantitative statistical analysis of all these diagrams in table  [ statis ] ) .",
    "we do not find differences in the mgb measurements between both galaxy samples , while field galaxies exhibit higher c4668 , nai and d@xmath0  indices than fornax galaxies at , with the largest differences for the co feature .",
    "this behaviour indicates that there are differences in the star formation history and the metal enrichment between both galaxy samples .",
    "as we will discuss below , we are likely seeing the effect of more metal rich intermediate - age stellar populations in these field galaxies , which are not present in most of their fornax counterparts ( s08 ) . for galaxies with higher @xmath5 ,",
    "both samples seem to follow the same trend .    in the right column of figure  [ fig2 ]",
    "we compare different indices with h@xmath13 .",
    "we do not find any correlation .",
    "two of the galaxies marked in all the plots with filled symbols show very high h@xmath13  indices .",
    "these galaxies deviate from all the relations defined by the indices and other parameters .",
    "in addition , there are several galaxies with @xmath16   , while the bulk of the galaxies have lower h@xmath13  indices .",
    "s08 already showed the presence of a small amount of intermediate - age population in the three fornax galaxies with h@xmath13  @xmath17   .",
    "since we find differences in c4668 , nai and d@xmath0  between galaxies in low density environment and in fornax cluster , we explore possible dependences among these indices in figure  [ fig3 ] .",
    "the most interesting result is the extremely tight correlation between nai and c4668 indices in figure  [ fig3]a .",
    "this is remarkable given the fact that the indices have been measured on completely independent spectra processed by different authors in distinct spectral ranges .",
    "interestingly , the two galaxies with highest h@xmath13  separate from the global trend . finally , there are also correlations between d@xmath0  and the indices c4668 and nai ( figs .",
    "[ fig3]b and  [ fig3]c ) ( see table  [ statis ] ) .",
    "the main two results of this work are ( 1 ) the excellent correlation between the nai and c4668 indices , and ( 2 ) the higher d@xmath0  and nai values in the low - sigma field galaxies compared with their fornax counterparts",
    ". how can we interpret these results in terms of physical parameters ? to answer this question , we need to take into account the known dependences of the indices to several parameters .",
    "we have to warn the reader that this section is rather speculative , because of the lack of stellar population models in this wavelength region .",
    "we should also note that a simple discussion in terms of ssps ( _ simple stellar populations _ ) is inadequate here , since , as we will discuss , the measured indices in fornax and field galaxies are very likely indicating differences in their star formation history .",
    "first we describe the qualitative behaviour of the indices . for an old ssp we deduce , from the work by mq08 , that d@xmath0  increases as a function of metallicity . for younger stellar populations , d@xmath0  increases due to the presence of agb stars .",
    "the nai index increases with metallicity for old stellar populations ( see s08 ) . in s08",
    "it was also shown that nai increases when a young population is present in the galaxy ( see figure 16 in that paper ) .",
    "mgb and c4668 , like the rest of the non - balmer indices in the lick system , are weaker in younger stellar populations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these indices are also sensitive to metallicity , with higher values for more metal - rich populations .    how to explain the behaviour of the line indices shown in figure  [ fig2 ] ? following previous studies analyzing galaxies in different environments ( e.g. , sb03 * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) we start with the assumption that the differences between the field and fornax samples could be due to distinct star formation histories . as @xcite showed for the fornax cluster , elliptical galaxies and lenticulars of high @xmath5 form an almost coeval family of galaxies , and they exhibit a wide range in metallicity which explains the good correlation of all the indices with @xmath5 . on the other hand ,",
    "previous works have suggested an extended star formation history in field galaxies ( e.g.,sb03 * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if this is the case , we would expect two effects : i ) the chemical enrichment of the interstellar medium produced by previous generations of stars . as a result",
    ", the new generation of stars will be more metal rich than the previous ones .",
    "ii ) the presence of agb stars from the intermediate - age population of recent star formation episodes .",
    "the higher d@xmath0  values for field galaxies with can be explained by a late stage star formation in these galaxies , which is reflected in a more metal rich population and the presence of agb stars . since this index has a positive response to both effects , the differences between field and fornax galaxies are more prominent here than in other indices . in addition , the more metal rich population in field galaxies would be responsible for the high values of nai and c4668 in these objects ( see figure  [ fig2]b - c and figure  [ fig3]a - c ) , since both indices are very sensitive to metallicity .",
    "actually , the excellent correlation between nai and c4668 shown in figure  [ fig3]a might be indicating that the effect of an intermediate - age population in these two indices is less important , and , therefore , they are both excellent metallicity indicators for old and intermediate ages . however , the two galaxies with the highest h@xmath13  separate from the global trend , as expected due to the sensitivity of these indices to the presence of very young and more metal rich stars , as explained above .",
    "the larger scatter in d@xmath0  vs.  c4668 diagram ( figure  [ fig3]b ) can be explained by considering that d@xmath0  is sensitive to the presence of agb stars , contrary to the optical c4668 index .",
    "last , both galaxy samples exhibit a similar mgb index .",
    "this is explained by the age - metallicy degeneracy described in previous works ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this work has shown the crucial role that the near - ir line - strength indices can play in the understanding of the star formation histories of early - type galaxies .",
    "although interpreting these near - ir indices is difficult without models and the analyzed galaxy samples are still small , we have demonstrated that the measurement of line - strength indices in the near - ir is a useful tool to constrain the star formation histories of these galaxies . in particular ,",
    "the nai index has been shown to be a metallicity indicator as good as c4668 in the optical range , while the d@xmath0  index can be used as tracer of intermediate - age stellar populations .",
    "the differences in c4668 , nai , and d@xmath0 , when studying low - mass galaxies in fornax cluster and in low density environments , can be interpreted as field galaxies having undergone later stellar formation episodes than fornax galaxies .",
    "once synthesis stellar population models in the near - ir range are available , more detailed and quantitative predictions will be made using this interesting wavelength region .",
