    "landau s theories of the continuous phase transition have been successful and provided a paradigm in the condensed matter physics . the spontaneous symmetry breaking plays a central role in landau s theories . in zero temperature",
    "however , it is possible that the change of fermi - surface topology or the quantum fluctuation induce new kind of phase transitions @xcite beyond landau s paradigm .",
    "the different phases in these phase transitions are not classified by different symmetries , instead , they are characterized by different topology of fermi surface @xcite , different quantum numbers @xcite or nonlocal topological order parameters @xcite etc .",
    "this kind of phase transition , known as topological quantum phase transition(tqpt ) , has attracted considerable attention in recent years because they are closely related with the field of topological quantum computation @xcite . despite of great efforts ,",
    "many properties of the topological phase and tqpt , such as its order and universality classes , the effect of temperature and interaction and its stability , are still far from being completely understood .",
    "for example , since there is no spontaneous symmetry breaking in the tqpt , the mermin - wagner theorem@xcite could not be applied to preclude the possibility of a finite temperature phase transition in 2d system . in this paper , we have partly answered above questions .",
    "in this paper , we present a theoretical analysis of a class of tqpt .",
    "our starting point is the haldane model@xcite , which was proposed to study the realization of  parity anomaly  in graphene - like condensed matter system and is the first work of anomalous hall effect .",
    "the phase transition in this model , essentially , is the transition between two phases with different parity , or in another word , different chern numbers , which is induced by adjusting parameter to change the sign of the effective mass of the  relativistic  electrons .",
    "we show that this tqpt is a third order quantum phase transition , while most other conventional continuous quantum phase transitions are second order .",
    "we also analyze the effect of finite temperature on this tqpt , we find that there is no phase transition at @xmath0 , in another word , there is no finite temperature phase transition for the anomalous hall effect(ahe ) .",
    "the temperature drives the tqpt to be a crossover .",
    "the critical behavior as well as the properties of correlation function in the finite temperature have also been analyzed , then an experiment is proposed to detect these unconventional properties .",
    "when there exists short range interaction , we deal with this problem by the method of mean field and show that this tqpt is robust against the weak short range interaction for either the repulsive or attractive case .",
    "this is very different from the regular fermi liquid .",
    "strong interaction would change the pictures : strong enough repulsive interaction would lead to a charge density wave ( cdw ) state@xcite , while strong attractive interaction would result in a superconductor @xcite . to make our above results applicable to the orginal haldane model",
    ", we investigate the effect of the on - site energy , which shifts the degeneracy of the two fermi points .",
    "furthermore , we point out the difference between this kind of tqpt and the disorder - induced localization - delocalization transition in the conventional quantum hall systems@xcite , as well as in the quantum spin hall effect@xcite .",
    "finally , we show that though the haldane model could not be realized in the present experiment , our results can be applied to a large class of tqpt which could be realized in experiment .",
    "first , we briefly review the haldane model@xcite and focus on the phase transition in it .",
    "haldane considered a ( 2 + 1)-dimensional ( ( 2 + 1)-d ) model in which spinless fermions hop on a half - filling honeycomb lattice and couple with a periodic external magnetic field .",
    "there is no  net  magnetic flux through a unit cell and thus there is no landau quantization .",
    "however , a next nearest - neighbor hopping term with a phase @xmath1 is introduced in the honeycomb lattice , which is a time - reversal breaking term and leads to a  chiral  fermions without the fermion doubling effect .",
    "this system provides a condensed - matter analog of ( 2 + 1)-dimensional electrodynamics@xcite due to its linear energy spectrum around the fermi point .    in the honeycomb lattice ,",
    "noninteracting fermions behave as a semimetal with the fermi surface shrunk into to two inequivalent points in one unit cell as shown in fig .",
    "the general action of ( 2 + 1)-d noninteracting fermions in a uniform or periodic potential is given by @xmath2 for the haldane model , it is convenient to represent @xmath3 in a basis of spinors @xmath4 with a and b representing the different sublattice of the honeycomb lattice",
    ". therefore we have    , two sublattice are connected by @xmath5 .",
    "( b ) the brillouin zone , @xmath6 are basis vector in reciprocal - lattice .",
    "@xmath7 are two distinct fermi point in one brillouin zone , width=326 ]    @xmath8+% \\mathbf{d\\cdot \\sigma } , \\ ] ]    where @xmath9 with @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and the pauli matrices @xmath13 . here",
    "we set the on - site energy @xmath14 in the original haldane model to be zero for convenience , we would discuss the effect of @xmath14 in section v. @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the tunnelling amplitudes between the nearest and the next - nearest neighboring sites .",
    "the parameters @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the displacement from one site to its nearest neighborhoods and @xmath19 , @xmath20 , etc",
    ". we could calculate the chern number ( hall conductance ) for this model using the standard representation@xcite @xmath21\\ ] ] with @xmath22 . finally , we could obtain @xmath23 the chern number is the topological quantum number@xcite .",
    "it was first introduced into the condensed matter physics in the integer quantum hall effect to explain the stability of the hall conductance to weak pertubations@xcite .",
    "the physical meaning of the chern number is the quantum hall conductance in our case .",
    "different chern numbers characterize different topological phase and we focus on the phase transition between them .",
    "this phase transition could be interpreted in a traditional way by calculating the singularly of the ground state energy .. the energy spectrum for ( 2 ) is : @xmath24 where @xmath25 have been defined above , and @xmath26 . in the ground state , the lower band is filled completely so the ground state energy @xmath27        to find the singularity of @xmath28 in the phase transition point @xmath29=0 , we calculate @xmath28 and its derivative , the numerical result is shown in fig.2 .",
    "we can see that the second deviative is continuous while the third one is not in the phase transition point , which means that this quantum phase transition is the third order quantum phase transition .",
    "this result could be explained in a heuristic way when we consider the behavior around the two distinct independent fermi points .",
    "these two independent effective hamiltonians @xmath30 ( @xmath31 represent different dirac fermi points ) are given by    @xmath32    where @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 .",
    "the parameter @xmath36 is the  light velocity  in the relativistic hamiltonian and below we set @xmath37 for simplicity .",
    "the total hamiltonian is@xcite : @xmath38 @xmath39 represent fermions around different fermi points .",
    "when we adjust the parameter @xmath40 from negative to positive , the mass of both dirac fermions change sign and the phase transition occurs .    because the two dirac fermi points are independent with each other , below we only focus on one of them .",
    "from the hamiltonian ( 7 ) , we can easily calculate the energy spectrum @xmath41 with @xmath42 for the  conduction  band and @xmath43 for the  valence  band .",
    "the energy of the ground state could be estimate as @xmath44 @xmath45 is the physical cutoff of the integral and is obviously analytic in the phase transition point @xmath46 , because we only concern about the singularity of @xmath28 at the critical point @xmath46 , @xmath45 is unimportant . from ( 9 )",
    "we find that the third order derivative of @xmath28 to @xmath29 is discontinuous in the point @xmath46 , so this tqpt is a third order phase transition .",
    "the analysis above implies that hamiltonian ( 8) provides a effective approximation of the actual hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( 1 ) if we only concern the behavior around the fermi point .",
    "below we use eq.(8 ) to analyze the properties of the phase transition for simplicity .",
    "a typical example of finite temperature effect on the quantum phase transition is the transverse ising model@xcite , which is fermionized by the jordon - wigner transformation .",
    "the finite temperature drive the quantum phase transition into a crossover .",
    "it is shown that there is a similar behavior in our case .",
    "when the temperature is not too high , the model could be expressed in terms of a continuum canonical fermion field @xmath47 .",
    "its partition function is @xmath48 with @xmath49 here @xmath50 is the imaginary time . from ( 10 ) and ( 11 ) , we perform the standard scaling transformation by rescaling lengths , times , as well as the field etc .",
    "we define @xmath51 with @xmath52 being the dimensional rescaling factor . to make sure the new @xmath53 having the same form in terms of @xmath54 , we find that @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "so we have @xmath57=1 $ ] and the critical exponent @xmath58 .        at finite temperature @xmath59 , the free energy @xmath60 is given by @xmath61 to find out whether there is a finite temperature phase transition",
    ", we should calculate the derivative of the free energy .",
    "numerical results are shown in fig.3 .",
    "( because we only consider the singularities around the phase transition point , we set a physical cutoff of the integral and it would not effect the singularities of ( 12 ) . )",
    "we can see that the free energy is analytic there is no singularity in ( 12 ) at @xmath62 , thus no phase transition occurs .",
    "however , there is a crossover just like in the transverse ising model at finite temperature .",
    "the phase diagram is shown in fig.2 .",
    "there are two regions in the phase diagram : the low - t massive chiral - liquid and the continuum high - t region ( quantum critical region )",
    ". however , the temperature could not be too high that the continuum action @xmath53 in ( 11 ) fails to provide a good approximation of the real system .",
    "below we analyze the properties in both regions by calculating the fermion green s function : @xmath63 in the quantum field theory , the green s function for the massive dirac fermions at finite temperature is : @xmath64 @xmath65 we use the 2d representation of @xmath66 matrix ( @xmath67=0,1,2 ) rather than the ordinary 4d representation .",
    "@xmath68 is the spin of the dirac electron .",
    "@xmath69 denotes the real time .    in our case ,",
    "there are two kinds of dirac fermions(@xmath70 and @xmath71 ) and both of them contribute to the green function , the green function is sightly different from the standard formula ( 13 ) , as we will show below .     of the dirac fermion and the temperature t , width=326 ]    _ low - t massive dirac - liquid , @xmath72 _ : in this region , the temperature is very low and thus the physics is controlled primarily by the critical line @xmath73 .",
    "first we analyze @xmath73 equal - time correlations given by    @xmath74    we could approximately estimate the asymptotic behavior when @xmath75 plane . for large @xmath76 , those poles closest to the real axis provide the dominant contribution to the integral .",
    "the leading result is @xmath77 ) , and thus the equal - time correlation exponentially decays in the spacial dimension with a correlation length @xmath78 .",
    "then we calculate the equal - space correlation . for @xmath73 , we have @xmath79 doing this integration directly , we get @xmath80 so we find : @xmath81 we notice that the term @xmath29 in ( 13 ) does nt appear in ( 18 ) , because the @xmath29 in different fermi points have opposite sign and cancel each other so @xmath82 is independent of the sign of @xmath29 , which is reasonable in physics .",
    "so @xmath83 decays with a power law and oscillatory with a frequency @xmath84 .",
    "the correlation length in the real time axis ( coherent time ) is infinite when @xmath73 .",
    "we can see that though there is a gap , quantum systems at @xmath73 indeed have a long - range phase correlation in time which could not be seen when we map the d - dimensional quantum system to the d+1 dimensional classic system @xcite .",
    "when the temperature is very low , the density of the quasiparticles is small , so the life of a quasiparticle ( coherent time ) holds for a long time in this region .",
    "now we discuss the observable effect of @xmath83 in this region .",
    "we use the tunnelling effect in a bilayer haldane model .",
    "there is a voltage @xmath85 between the bilayer . by calculating the i - v curve in the our system",
    ", we can find that it is totally different from the ordinary electron systems@xcite .",
    "notice that we only consider the long - term behavior of @xmath83 in experiment , that is @xmath86 ( actually it is @xmath87 , we set @xmath88 in our case ) .",
    "so @xmath89 , the term @xmath90 is neglectable in ( 18 ) , so @xmath91 .",
    "the correlation of the tunneling operator @xmath92 is : @xmath93 where 1 , 2 denote the different layer and a , b are different sublattices in each layer . using the linear response formation , it is easy to find that the tunneling current @xmath94 , which is different from the massless case @xmath95 .",
    "_ continuum high t region , @xmath96 _ : this region is also known as the  quantum - critical region  , which plays an important role in condensed matter physics because its potential relation with the heavy fermion systems@xcite and the high - tc superconductivity@xcite .",
    "the de broglie wavelength of the excitation in this region is the same order as their mean spacing , so quantum and thermal effect entangle and both of them play an equally important role .",
    "we mainly focus on the line @xmath46 , and calculate the equal - space correlation to see how the effect of temperature change the behavior ( 13 ) . from    @xmath97",
    "this integral could be done by the contour integration . in the experimental condition : @xmath98 ( we set @xmath99 in our case ) , it is easy to find that @xmath100 we can see that ( 21 ) is totally different from ( 18 ) .",
    "the equal - space correlation decays exponentially and the phase coherent time is proportional to @xmath101 in this region .",
    "for fermions , the interaction and interaction - induced quantum phase transition play a central role in condensed matter physics@xcite .",
    "we will show that our tqpt is stable against both the weak repulsive and attractive interaction , while strong enough repulsive / attractive interaction would lead to the cdw / superconductor state .",
    "first we consider the condition in the critical point of the tqpt @xmath102 .",
    "the hamiltonian for the spinless fermions in the honeycomb lattice with nearest - neighbor interaction @xmath85 is given by @xmath103,\\ ] ] where @xmath104 is the displacement from one site to its nearest neighbor site .",
    "for the repulsive interaction , we use the standard mean - field to deal with the interaction .",
    "assuming @xmath105 with @xmath106for @xmath107 and @xmath108 for @xmath109 , we get @xmath110.\\ ] ] following the standard procedure@xcite , we calculate the energy of the ground state .",
    "minimize it with respect to @xmath111 , we obtain the self - consistent equation @xmath112 with @xmath113 at the critical point ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "when we deviate from the critical point , there is a mass term in @xmath114 , and it is estimated that @xmath115    by solving this equation , we find that there is a sm - cdw transition at a finite value @xmath116 . the numerical result is shown in fig.6 . for the weak interaction @xmath117 , @xmath118 , and",
    "the tqpt is stable .",
    "it is consistent with previous study of the chiral symmetry breaking induced by coulomb interaction in layered graphite@xcite . for attractive interaction , a mean field similar to the bcs theory",
    "could be done .",
    "the sm - superconductor phase transition in the honeycomb lattice has been analyzed@xcite .",
    "these works support the result that , for the half - filling fermions , there exist a sm - superconductor phase transition in @xmath119 and when @xmath120 , the sm is stable .",
    "this result is also correct when @xmath29 deviates from 0 slightly , so our tqpt is stable for the weak attractive interaction .",
    "in addition , it is interesting to study the effect of the temperature in the global phase diagram in fig.6 : in the cdw phase , it is known that there is a finite - temperature phase transition for the 2d cdw system . when the temperature is high enough ,",
    "the cdw order is destroyed . however , for the topological phase , as analyzed above , there is no thermodynamic phase transition at finite temperature , this result has shown a critical difference between the topological phase and non - topological phase .    , the solid line is the phase boundary between the cdw and topolqiogical phases , and the dot line is the phase boundary of our tqpt , width=326 ]",
    "up to now , we assume the on - site energy in the original haldane model @xmath121 , as a consequence , the two kind of dirac fermions @xmath122 and @xmath71 degenerate , the effective mass of them : @xmath123 . at the phase transition point ,",
    "the mass of both kinds of fermions change sign simultaneously thus the chern number of the whole systme changes from @xmath124 to @xmath125 .",
    "when the on - site energy m is included , as in the original haldane model , the condition is different .",
    "now the effective mass of the two kind of dirac fermions @xmath126 , thus the energy of them no longer degenerate .",
    "the phase diagram with @xmath14 has been demonstrated by haldane ( fig.7 ) .",
    "we assume @xmath127 , as shown in fig.7 , the original critical point @xmath128 is split into two different phase transition point @xmath129 , @xmath130 . at the point of @xmath131 , for instance , only the mass of one kind of @xmath71 change sign , while the other is not , thus the chern number of the whole system is changed from @xmath125 to @xmath132 , different from the condition when we set @xmath121 . at this phase transition point",
    ", we will find that only one kind of dirac fermions experience the same singularity as shown in fig.2 , while the energy of the other one is analytic in this transition point .",
    "however , if we only focus on the properties of the phase transition point , the analytic part is not important , so all the results in above sections can be applied to this kind of phase transition , that the it is a third order quantum phase transition , the temperature would drive it to be a crossover and the weak interaction ca nt change the tqpt .     shifts",
    "the degeneracy between the two fermi points and splits our original tqpt into two tqpts ( + , @xmath43),width=336 ]",
    "now we discuss the important difference between our tqpt and one of the most typical tqpt , i.e. , the disorder - induced localization - delocalization transition between different hall plateaus in the quantum hall effect@xcite .",
    "this kind of phase transition is controlled by the impurity and it is , in nature , a kind of percolation phase transition with a critical exponent @xmath133 . in our tqpt , however , there are no impurities and the phase transition is controlled by the mass of dirac fermions . from the analysis above , we can get that @xmath58 .",
    "so our tqpt is totally different from the phase transition in@xcite .",
    "it is also different from the localization - delocalization transitions in the quantum spin hall effect@xcite with @xmath134 .",
    "since the haldane model is an artificial model which could not be realized easily in experiments , we would turn to other physical systems in order to find this tqpt experimentally . in a recent work about quantum spin hall effect@xcite",
    ", an experiment in hgte quantum well is proposed to realize this tqpt .",
    "this simplified model is based on the @xmath135 perturbation theory . for each kind of electrons with spin @xmath136 or @xmath137",
    ", there is a dirac - type subband due to the special structure of the quantum well .",
    "when the thickness of quantum well is adjusted to a certain point , the effective mass of two kinds of dirac electrons would change its sign and a tqpt occurs .",
    "the system does not break the time - reversal invariance , thus there is no hall conductance , instead , there exists a quantum jump of the spin hall conductance @xmath138 .",
    "however , there is a difference between this tqpt and our case .",
    "the mass term in @xcite is @xmath139 dependent : @xmath140 , which makes their hamiltonian different from the standard dirac fermion .",
    "this difference results that the phase transition is no longer between two symmetric phase with the topological number @xmath141 , but between a spin hall insulator ( @xmath142 ) and a spin hall conductance ( @xmath143 ) .",
    "however , if we only focus on the phase transition , simple scaling analysis implies that the term @xmath144 is relevant in the phase transition point , so our results in this paper could be applied to this tqpt .",
    "it is natural to ask what happens if the interaction is long range ( coulomb interaction ) , which corresponds to the more physical situation .",
    "since the weak short - range interaction is irrelevant in the critical point ( @xmath46 ) , simple scale analysis would imply that the tqpt is still stable for the weak long range interaction .",
    "however , when the interaction is strong enough , the situation is complex and whether there is a phase transition driven by the interaction is still controversial@xcite . to answer this question ,",
    "it is necessary to do the renormalization group analysis of the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional massive qed coupling with the gauge field .",
