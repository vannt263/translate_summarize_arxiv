    "an important figure of merit that is used to quantitatively characterize all the phonon dissipation mechanisms , including the decay of vibrations into the support as well as intrinsic damping mechanism within the nanotube , e.g. due to scattering from surface defects , is the mechanical quality factor @xmath76 , defined as the ratio of the resonant frequency over the linewidth .",
    "it is interesting to estimate a sort of coherence length for the nanoresonator mode .",
    "to do so one can think of the fundamental bending mode as a traveling wave , which is reflected at the ends of the nanotube .",
    "thus , the coherence length can be estimated as the effective mean phonon free path @xmath187 @xcite , where @xmath188 is the effective speed of sound , and @xmath189 is the relaxation time ( mechanical damping rate @xmath190 )",

    "it can extend over distances on the order of several centimeters , much larger than the distance between two nv spins .",
    "therefore , for a high - q mechanical resonator , phonons can coherently propagate inside it back and forth for quite a long distance before they finally dissipate .",
    "this phenomenon has a direct analogy to photons bound in a high - q micro - cavity .",
    "thus , in this scheme , we can safely ignore the harmful effect of phonon scattering inside solid state materials , provided that the mechanical resonator possesses a very high quality factor at low temperature .",
    "we need to emphasize that the recent fabrication of carbon nanotube resonators can possess a quality factor exceeding @xmath78 @xcite , which ensures that phonon losses do not severely limit our scheme .",
    "the minimum requirement of this work is that the length scale of the phonon mediated nv spin coupling is on the order of the tube s length , which would allow us to coherently control the nv spin interactions , and facilitate potential applications of this hybrid device .      to implement this protocol , we need a microwave to drive the transition between the qubit state @xmath102 and the bright state @xmath103 in each qubit with rabi frequency @xmath104 and frequency detuning @xmath105 .",

    "<S> our main task is to realize a swap gate and quantum information transfer between two qubits . </S>",
    "<S> to implement this protocol , we need a microwave to drive the transition between the qubit state @xmath102 and the bright state @xmath103 in each qubit with rabi frequency @xmath104 and frequency detuning @xmath105 . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics of the entire system is described by @xmath106+\\hat{\\mathcal{h}}_\\text{s - s}. $ ] the spin - spin interaction can be diagonalized with the states @xmath107 $ ] .    , and @xmath108 . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) same as in ( a ) but for the second nv center . </S>",
    "<S> in both cases , the initial state is chosen as @xmath109 . </S>",
    "<S> ( c ) and ( d ) : time evolution of the probabilities for the two nv spins in the states @xmath110 , and @xmath111 respectively . the relevant parameters here are @xmath112 , and @xmath113 . ]    </S>",
    "<S> it is easy to show that in the subspace defined by @xmath114 , the system hamiltonian has the form @xcite @xmath115 with @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 . </S>",
    "<S> thus we can find that if the two qubits are initially prepared in the state @xmath119 or @xmath109 , then the dynamics of the system will be confined in the subspace governed by the hamiltonian ( [ h3 ] ) . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 5 we present detailed numerical simulations for the dynamics of the coupled system . </S>",
    "<S> it can be found that at the moment @xmath120 , the system evolves from the state @xmath121 to the state @xmath122 via the intermediate states @xmath123 through microwave driving , and vice versa . </S>",
    "<S> the state @xmath124 remains unchanged during this process , while the system will be brought from the state @xmath125 to the state @xmath126 or @xmath127 , and back again at the moment @xmath128 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , in the language of quantum information theory , this operation corresponds to a swap gate . this gate can be exploited to realize quantum state transfer between two nv spins , i.e. , @xmath129    the gate fidelity is limited by the following factors : ( i ) spin decoherence induced by phonon excitations with an effective decay rate @xmath130 ; ( ii ) single spin dephasing due to low - frequency noise with a dephasing rate @xmath131 , which is assumed to be markovian for simplicity . </S>",
    "<S> recent work has shown that by coupling a single nv spin to another two - level system and encoding quantum information in the dark - states @xmath132 and @xmath133 , the coherent time @xmath86 can be prolonged @xcite . for isotopically purified diamond , we can safely choose @xmath134 ms . taking these factors together , </S>",
    "<S> we find the gate fidelity can be estimated as @xmath135 for the given parameters , with an operating time @xmath136 @xmath137 .    _ </S>",
    "<S> conclusions. _ we have proposed a spin - nanomechanical hybrid device where a single nv center spin in diamond is coupled to the vibrational mode of a suspended current - carrying carbon nanotube . </S>",
    "<S> it makes the strong spin - mechanical coupling at a single quantum level feasible , and allows fast mechanical control of spin qubits and efficient phonon cooling by an nv center . </S>",
    "<S> such a device can find applications in phonon - mediated quantum information processing with nv spin qubits , and could serve as novel nanoscale sensors for detecting tiny pressure , temperature , electric and magnetic field changes .    </S>",
