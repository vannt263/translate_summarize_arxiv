    "over the last few years , observational progress in discovering the faint universe at ultraviolet ( uv)/optical and infrared wavelength via the groundbased redshift surveys , hubble space telescope ( hst ) multi - color images and the infrared satellites such as iras ( infrared astronomical satellite ) , iso ( infrared space observatory ) and cobe ( cosmic background explorer ) , challenges and renews our present understanding of cosmological structure formation and the evolution of luminous galaxies , which are usually based on two competing scenarios `` traditional monolithic collapsing '' versus `` hierarchical clustering theories '' .",
    "the main difference between these two kinds of models is the formation mechanism and the first epoch of the formation of massive galaxies .",
    "more recently it has been shown that the emission history ( e.g. madau plot ) derived from uv / optical detections agrees quite well with the star formation history indicated by hierarchical clustering theories ( madau 1997 , madau et al .",
    "1996 , 1998 , ellis et al .",
    "1996 ) . since the fir / submm unveiled a dust - shrouded early active phase and the recent detection of high redshift evolving galaxies by deep nicmos / vlt images ( lilly et al .",
    "1998 , benitez et al . 1998 ) , the discussion of the structure formation and the scheme of galaxy evolution is going to require more subtlety and sophistication . for a clear picture of the star formation history and the galaxy evolution , we probably need more information at high redshift , especially from fir / submm deep surveys .    a successful interpretation of the excess of faint blue galaxies within the merger - trigger starburst scenario in a hierarchical clustering universe has been presented by cavaliere & menci ( 1997 ) using binary aggregation dynamics .",
    "the binary aggregation dynamical approach for the galaxy evolution presented by cavaliere & menci ( 1993 , 1997 ) , which includes more dynamics to describe a further step in galaxy - galaxy interactions within the scheme of direct hierarchical clustering ( dhcs ) , probably can help to alleviate some intrinsic problems in the dhc scenario , such as the overproduction of small objects and the difficulty of a reconciliation between the excess faint counts and the flat local luminosity function . while , on the other hand , binary merging which plays a different and complementary role in structure formation , can actually continue to flatten the mass distribution function @xmath3 and hence the luminosity function @xmath4 till even moderate redshift @xmath5 .",
    "although there are many other possible evolutionary scenarios which could interpret the present observations in this or that way , the reason that we are encouraged to explore here a merger - driven galaxy evolution picture with the binary aggregation dynamics , is simply because the iras database does show that most of the luminous infrared sources are actually interacting / merging systems ( kleinmann & keel 1987 , sanders & mirabel 1996 , hutchings & neff 1987 , vader & simon 1987a , b ) , and many merger events can even occur till moderate redshift ( @xmath5 ) .    in this paper , starting from the basic picture that galaxy evolution is driven by the galaxy - galaxy interaction complementary to the standard hierarchical clustering scenario ( dhcs ) , we investigate a simple model with the basic concepts : 1 ) galaxy - galaxy interaction can even occur till quite moderate redshifts ( @xmath5 ) within large scale structures that could offer the best combination of volume and density contrast , and it could erase the dwarf part of the mass distribution and produce the massive tail , thus flatten the luminosity functions ; 2 ) starburst / agn activities may be triggered by the merger events during the structure formation and evolution .",
    "this is actually the point different from other models where only the starburst is considered as the consequence of merger events ( cavaliere & menci 1997 , somerville & primack 1998 , somerville et al .",
    "1998 ) ; 3 ) the gas rich merger events at high redshift may trigger drastic starburst and agn activities in the central region of the merging galaxies and thus enhance dramatically the fir luminosity because of the accumulating of dust grains from their progenitor galaxies as well as the dust newly formed in the star forming regions .",
    "this fir luminosity burst phase is usually called ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( uligs ) ; 4 ) in our model , we assume a redshift dependent infrared burst phase for the gas rich merger events at high redshift and the gas poor mergers at low redshift , which means the enhancement of the infrared luminosities by the high redshift gas rich mergers is much higher than those of low redshift gas poor mergers .",
    "the motivation for this kind of thinking is : 1 ) direct observation of enhanced starburst - agn activities in interacting galaxies , especially the uligs .",
    "this extremely infrared bright burst phase is believed due to the starburst merger events with far infrared luminosity @xmath6 enhanced both by the accumulation of the dust mass @xmath7 and the increase of dust temperation @xmath8 as the relation @xmath9 .",
    "this burst phase could increase the infrared luminosity by a factor of about 20 over that of normal starburst galaxies .",
    "( ashby et al . 1992 , terlevich & melnick 1985 , heckman 1997 , perry & williams 1993 , taniguchi & ohyama 1998 ) ; 2 ) numerical simulation of the starburst / agn evolutions by galaxy mergers , especially for their correlation and the burst phase ( wang & biermann 1998 , 1999 , wang 1999 ) ; 3 ) the successful interpretation of the excess faint blue counts by galaxy merging and the consequential starburst activities ( rocca - volmerange & guiderdoni 1990 , cavaliere & menci 1997 , carlberg 1992 , calberg & charlot 1992 ) ; 4 ) the pair production absorption of high energy @xmath10 rays by intergalactic low energy photons is expected to produce a high energy cutoff in extragalactic @xmath10 ray spectra .",
    "the new data of mkn501 appear to show an extension of the tev @xmath10 ray spectrum till about 24 tev , which sets an upper limit for the intergalactic infrared emission history during the structure formation ( aharonian et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "since the dust - shrouded geometry could strongly affect the agn spectrum and cause significant radiation at infrared wavelength in the framework of a unification scheme , we thus add the statistics of nuclear activity in galaxies as one additional constraint in the context of the various models already in the literature .",
    "we know that nuclear activity is detected to very high redshift and provides a strong constraint on the cosmological evolution models .",
    "therefore we are less conservative than malkan & stecker ( 1998 ) , but use more constraints than , e.g. , somerville & primack ( 1998 ) .",
    "obviously , any such modelling depends on the basic concepts used , and thus our results provide a strong lower limit to the far - infrared background .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : 1 ) in sect .",
    "[ dyn ] , we introduce the binary aggregation dynamics , and the models of the interaction kernel ; 2 ) we discuss the prescriptions of mass - to - light ratio in our model for the luminous infrared galaxies which is enhanced by the starburst and agn activities in sect .",

    "[ num ] , we discuss the numerical simulations and compare the monte carlo results with the iras @xmath11 source counts from three major infrared sources ( starburst galaxies , seyferts and spirals ) .",
    "we check also the redshift distribution of these infrared sources which are brighter than @xmath12 , calculate the integrated background level at wavelength of @xmath11 , and make an extrapolation to @xmath13 and @xmath14 based on the model spectrum and souce counts .",
    "finally , we give our conclusions .",
    "the classical approach to aggregation phenomena is based on the smoluchowski(1916 ) equation .",
    "we start with the continuous form :    @xmath15    where @xmath16 is the mass distribution function in `` comoving '' form , which describes the number density of galaxies within the mass range ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) at cosmic time @xmath19 .",
    "the mass @xmath20 is normalized in terms of @xmath21 , which is the mass corresponding locally to the standard characteristic luminosity @xmath22 ( see peebles 1993 ) . @xmath23 and @xmath24 represent the lower and upper limits on the masses of galaxies .",
    "usually we can set @xmath25 in case when @xmath23 is actually much smaller than the total mass of considered system .",
    "the kernel @xmath26 reflects the interaction rate for each pair of masses @xmath27 , and depends on the mechanism and environment of such aggregations .",
    "@xmath28 is the density of galaxies , it scales on average with the expansion of universe as @xmath29 ; @xmath30 is the relative velocity of the interacting pairs , and @xmath31 is the cross section .",
    "the average of them runs over the galaxy velocity distribution .    in aggregation dynamics , the interaction kernel @xmath32 is the key point for driving the whole evolutionary process , which depends strongly on the environment structures .    in this context , we discuss simply the case when the colliding galaxies are in certain structures , thus the cross section could be assumed to be the hyperbolic encounter prescription by saslaw ( 1985 ) , cavaliere et al .",
    "( 1991 , 1992 ) , which is in the form :    @xmath33\\ ] ]    with @xmath34 , where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the velocity dispersion and the dark halo radius of the present @xmath21 galaxy .",
    "the function @xmath37 describes the decreasing efficiency of the aggregations with an increasing relative velocities , which could be determined by the n - body simulations ( see , richstone & malumuth 1983 ) .    because of the uncertainty and the complexity of the components in the interaction kernel , such as the average density of galaxies in the environment @xmath38 , the relative velocity distribution of the aggregation pairs @xmath30 and the interaction cross section @xmath31 , the exact prescription of the interaction kernel is still poorly known .",
    "we will thus adopt in our simulation a simplified formula for the aggregation kernel @xmath39 with separated time evolution term and the cross section term .",
    "we give the interaction kernel @xmath39 as :    @xmath40\\ ] ]    where @xmath41 is the cosmic time evolution term .",
    "the free parameter @xmath42 depends on the specific structures like clusters , filaments or sheets ; @xmath43 is a free parameter in our model , which describes the relative importance of two kinds of encountering ( geometric collisions and focused interactions ) in the cross section .",
    "the aggregation time scale is @xmath44 , and thus the aggregation rate is @xmath45 , which is proportional to the interaction kernel @xmath39 as @xmath46 .",
    "the binary aggregation dynamics and monte carlo simulations give us information about the evolution of the galaxy mass distribution function @xmath16 .",
    "what we can actually observe and use to constrain the galaxy evolution model is : 1 ) the luminosity functions of galaxies in general or with certain morphologies ; 2 ) the source counts , redshift distributions and the background intensity from various hubble deep field surveys and the background measurements .    in this section , we will discuss the conversion of the mass distribution function @xmath16 by monte carlo simulation of a merger - driven galaxy evolution scenario to the observable luminosity function @xmath47 .    in this case",
    ", we need to know i ) a simple prescription of mass - to - light ratio for starburst galaxies and agns ; and ii ) the bolometric correction for certain spectral characteristics , especially at infrared wavelengths .    a simple discussion of the mass - to - light ratio for the starburst galaxies is given by cavaliere & menci ( 1997 ) for the faint blue galaxies who estimate the luminosity of starburst galaxies by the gaseous mass of the galaxies and the dynamical time scales .",
    "the mass to light relation of those blue starburst galaxies is given as :    @xmath48    where @xmath49 ; @xmath50 is the bolometric luminosity and @xmath51 is the mass of the galaxy ; @xmath22 is the local standard characteristic luminosity , with the corresponding mass @xmath21 ( peebles 1993 ) .",
    "@xmath52 represents a cosmological redshift dimming . considering the large scale structure , cavaliere et al .",
    "( 1997 ) gave a prescription of @xmath53 being a function of dimensionality @xmath54 of the large scale structure as @xmath55 .",
    "studies of the origin of ultraluminous infrared galaxies such as arp220 , ngc1614 , ngc3256 and iras18293 - 3413 , show that the infrared luminosity of this kind of galaxies is about a factor of 20 higher than that of normal starburst galaxies , with a statistical relation of @xmath56 ( taniguchi & ohyama 1998 ) .",
    "the increase in both the dust mass @xmath7 and the dust temperature @xmath8 by starburst merger events could enhance the far infrared luminosities of starburst merging galaxies dramatically ; we thus call them ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( uligs ) .",
    "because of the uncertainties of the gas / dust ratio and the complexity of the consequential heating of the dust grains , the mass - infrared luminosity correlation for the ultraluminous infrared galaxies is still unclear . in our calculation",
    ", we thus simply adopt the power law relation for the mass - to - infrared luminosity similar to that of starburst galaxies by cavaliere & menci ( 1997 ) , with the exponent @xmath57 increased by a factor of about two to simulate the situation of an enhancement of their infrared luminosity by about a factor of near 20 for a typical uligs of mass @xmath58 .    in our model",
    ", we basically assume that starburst and agn activities which are triggered by the merger events at high redshift are more drastic than those of low redshift , simply because the mergers are usually between gas rich systems at high redshift and the progenitors of the low redshift mergers are already poor in cold gas . in this case , we assume in our model a redshift depenent infrared burst phase , which means the enhancement of infrared radiation from gas rich mergers at high redshift is much higher than that of low redshift .",
    "we simulate this effect with a power law suppression of the infrared burst luminosity simply as @xmath59 below a transition redshift @xmath60 , besides a normal redshift dimming defined in eq .",
    "( [ ml ] ) .",
    "this power law suppression means that the infrared luminous galaxies at the bright tail of the luminosity function become gas poor faster than the less luminous ones . on the other hand ,",
    "choosing redshift @xmath61 as a redshift transition for the gas rich mergers at high redshift and gas poor mergers at low redshift is based on the consideration that the cosmic time scale of @xmath61 is about @xmath62 years , which is approximately the time scale for the disk evolution ( lin & pringle 1987 ) , it probably indicates a stage when galaxies are becoming gas poor .    while the basic concept is clearly correct , the details of these assumptions are a bit crude and arbitrary , especially the assumptions for the transition redshift @xmath61 and the consequential power law suppression of the infrared burst phase .",
    "but it seems that they are the important effects for the fitting of iras source counts in our simulation , especially the strong evolution at flux range @xmath63 .",
    "varying any of the model parameters could influence more or less the evolution of the luminosity functions and the source counts finally .",
    "while all of the model parameters combine to influence the luminosity functions together , the impact from variation of one of the parameters such as @xmath64 or @xmath57 , probably still could be compensated by varying again other related parameters . as for the assumptions of transition redshift and the differential burst phase , there seems to be not much room left for the variation of these particular values .",
    "we checked the case when the transition redshift and the enhancement of the infrared burst phase @xmath57 are both twice and half of the values in our model .",
    "although we adjusted other parameters in order to approximately fit the observed local luminosity functions for the infrared luminous sources , it seems that they are far from giving an acceptable fit to the iras deep surveys ( see fig.[db ] ) . in this case , what we show here is only one of the most possible , realistic set of model parameters which could give the best fitting of available observations .",
    "since our model is still too crude , we need probably further information about the evolution of infrared bright sources at high redshift , or the redshift distributions to high redshift , to give more robust model constraints .",
    "we will discuss this point again later .",
    "we use a monte carlo inverse - cascading process to simulate the binary aggregation evolution of galaxies which is described by eq .",
    "( [ von ] ) . in our simulation",
    ", we consider the initial galaxy mass distribution as a @xmath65-function starting from redshift @xmath66 and of mass @xmath67 as an approximation .",
    "since binary aggregation dynamics does not strongly depend on the initial condition , the memory of the initial condition will disappear after the transients and the mass distribution is independent of initial details with self - similar evolution .",
    "the specific discussion of this process was presented by cavaliere et al .",
    "( 1991 , 1992 ) analytically and numerically .",
    "[ fcount ]    in this case , evolution of the dwarf galaxies with mass less than @xmath68 is not relevant to our results . even for those dwarf galaxies of mass @xmath69",
    ", we could see that their influence is not very important since our results only strongly depend on the evolution of infrared - luminous galaxies .",
    "the large scale structures ( lsss ) , which have the advantage of a larger density and lower velocity dispersions compared with the field and the virialized clusters , present an ideal environment for galaxy - galaxy interactions to take place in .",
    "however , they are still quantitatively less understood both from the observational and theoretical point of view . in the paper about the evolution of faint blue galaxies , cavaliere & menci ( 1997 ) simply discussed the relation of the evolution of merger rate which is represented by the term @xmath41 in eq . ( [ kmk ] ) with different environments , such as the homogeneous `` field '' , the virialized clusters or groups and the large scale structures ( sheets and filaments ) .",

    "<S> this merger - driven evolution not only influences the galaxy mass distribution function , but may drive the main galactic activity cycles , such as starbursts and the activity in the nuclei ( agns ) . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we use galaxy aggregation dynamics together with a possible merger - driven starburst and agn phenomena , to study the effects of evolution of these consequential activities for the faint iras source counts and the infra - red background . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the strong evolution of iras 60@xmath0 source count at flux range of @xmath1 is difficult to be explained only by the merger rate decrease with cosmic time . </S>",
    "<S> we need to assume a redshift dependent infrared burst phase of ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( uligs ) from the gas rich mergers at high redshift and the gas poor mergers at low redshift . </S>",
    "<S> the background intensity at 60@xmath0 which we get from this aggregation evolution is a lower limit of only @xmath2 , about half of those estimated by some previous models , but close to the lower end of the range derived by malkan & stecker ( 1998 ) . </S>"
