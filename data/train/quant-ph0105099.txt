    "quantum entanglement plays an important role in such areas of quantum information processing as quantum teleportation @xcite , superdense coding @xcite , quantum key distribution @xcite and telecloning @xcite .",
    "recently , entangled nonorthogonal states have attracted much attention in quantum cryptography @xcite .",
    "bosonic entangled coherent states @xcite and @xmath0 and @xmath1 entangled coherent states @xcite are typical examples of entangled nonorthogonal states . for general bipartite nonorthogonal states some conditions",
    "have been found for maximal entanglement @xcite .",
    "in this letter we address the problem of finding necessary and sufficient conditions for the maximal entanglement of bipartite nonorthogonal pure states @xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 are two complex numbers , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are linearly independent normalized states of the systems 1 , and @xmath6 and @xmath7 are linearly independent normalized states of the system 2 . here",
    "we are interested in the nonorthogonal case in which the overlaps @xmath8 and @xmath9 are non - vanishing .",
    "note that the normalization constant is not @xmath10 , but @xmath11^{-1/2}.\\ ] ] we first give a classification of maximal entanglement for the state ( [ nstate ] ) .",
    "a necessary and sufficient condition for maximal entanglement is found .",
    "we then apply the condition to coherent states and find a simple condition for maximally entangled coherent states in terms of the coherence parameters .",
    "some new classes of maximally entangled coherent states , with relative phase different from the previously - noted @xmath12 , are explicited constructed . in the limit",
    ", these states give rise to maximally entangled bell - like states .",
    "the entanglement of a quantum system can be measured by the _ entanglement of formation _ , or simply _ entanglement _ , which is defined as the entropy of either one of the two subsystems 1 or 2 @xcite .",
    "it has been pointed out that the entanglement of a two - qubit state @xmath13 can be expressed as a function of the _ concurrence _",
    "@xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the _ spin - flip _ operator and @xmath16 is the complex conjugate of @xmath13 .",
    "concurrence itself can also be regarded as a measure of entanglement which ranges from 0 to 1 @xcite .",
    "one may readily obtain the concurrence for the state ( [ nstate ] ) by introducing an orthogonal normalized basis in the subspace spanned by @xmath4 and @xmath5 and by @xmath6 and @xmath7 ; it has the value @xcite @xmath17 the state ( [ nstate ] ) is referred to as a _ maximally entangled state _ ( mes ) when @xmath18 .",
    "we now give a necessary and sufficient condition for maximal entanglement ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "let @xmath20 , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 be real parameters with @xmath23 .",
    "noting that @xmath24 and @xmath25 , we write @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are all real parameters and @xmath29",
    ". then we may rewrite the condition @xmath19 as @xmath30 where @xmath31 .",
    "we consider two different cases .",
    "* case 1 : * @xmath32 . in this case",
    "we have @xmath33 namely @xmath34 , or @xmath35 , @xmath36 . inserting @xmath36 into relation ( [ kprime1 ] )",
    "we also have @xmath37 , namely @xmath38 ( @xmath39 an integer ) . then from eq.([condition2 ] ) we have @xmath40 namely @xmath41 .",
    "so in this case the mes condition is obtained as @xmath42    * case 2 : * @xmath43 . in this case",
    "the second term in ( [ condition2 ] ) is always non - negative and thus @xmath44 which leads to @xmath35 and @xmath36 as in case 1 .",
    "then the relation ( [ kprime2 ] ) is valid only when @xmath45 so the mes condition in this case is @xmath46 which is clearly the orthogonal case .    in summary",
    "we obtain the following theorem    the states ( [ nstate ] ) are mes if and only if one of the following conditions is satisfied    1 .",
    "@xmath47 and @xmath48 ( @xmath22 is a real parameter ) for the nonorthogonal case ; 2 .",
    "@xmath49 for the orthogonal case @xmath50 .    the necessity can be verified directly .    before closing this section",
    "we remark that the state ( [ nstate ] ) is disentangled ( @xmath51 ) if and only if one of the following is true : ( 1 ) @xmath52 ; ( 2 ) @xmath53 ; ( 3 ) @xmath54 ; ( 4 ) @xmath55 .",
    "now we turn to the explicit construction of mes .",
    "it is easy to see that condition ( [ mescon ] ) is satisfied when @xmath56 is an arbitrary phase . in this case , the normalized mes is obtained as @xmath57 does not enter the anti - symmetric state .",
    "it is natural to ask if there exist mes other than the antisymmetric mes .",
    "the answer is positive .",
    "let us consider entangled coherent states ; namely , all four states in ( [ nstate ] ) are coherent states @xmath58 where @xmath59 is an arbitrary complex number .",
    "the overlap between two coherent states @xmath4 and @xmath5 is @xmath60.\\ ] ] then the mes condition ( [ mescon ] ) simplifies to @xmath61 and both sides of eq.([cohcon ] ) have the same _ real _ part latexmath:[\\[|\\alpha^2 + |\\gamma|^2 - 2\\rm{re}(\\alpha^ * \\gamma ) =     their imaginary parts gives rise to a relative phase @xmath22 @xmath63    as an example we can choose @xmath59 and @xmath64 such that they have the same phase , as do @xmath65 and @xmath64",
    ". in this case @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "then the mes condition is obtained as @xmath69 where @xmath70 is a _",
    "parameter , and the corresponding mes are @xmath71 if we further choose @xmath72 and @xmath73 , we obtain the well - known mes @xmath74 and a new mes @xmath75 both states ( [ wellknown ] ) and ( [ statewith3 ] ) have the same normalization constant @xmath76^{-\\frac{1}{2}}$ ] .",
    "we now give an example in which the relative phase is not @xmath12 .",
    "suppose that @xmath59 and @xmath77 have a phase difference of @xmath78 , as therefore do @xmath65 and @xmath77 , namely ; @xmath79 then @xmath80 and @xmath81 are pure imaginary @xmath82 so the mes conditions in this case are @xmath83 and the mes is obtained as @xmath84 in the case @xmath85 , the mes states further simplify to @xmath86 in particular , when @xmath87 , we obtain some new types of mes @xmath88 these all have the same normalization constant @xmath89 it is interesting that the last two states ( [ 4states3 ] ) and ( [ 4states4 ] ) can be obtained from the first two states ( [ 4states1 ] ) and ( [ 4states2 ] ) , respectively , by the local transformation @xmath90 , where @xmath91 and @xmath92 are creation and annihilation operators of the second harmonic oscillator system respectively .",
    "note that the property of maximal entanglement of the above states is independent of the value of @xmath59 .",
    "let us consider the state ( [ 4states1 ] ) .",
    "we expand it in fock space as @xmath93|m\\rangle\\otimes |n\\rangle,\\ ] ] in which only terms with @xmath94 survive in the limit @xmath95 ( there is _ no _ term @xmath96 ) .",
    "the limiting state is readily obtained as @xmath97 which is clearly a bell - like mes .",
    "we may similarly show that the states ( [ 4states2 ] - [ 4states4 ] ) degenerate to the following orthogonal bell - like mes in the limit @xmath95 @xmath98 ) and eq.([statewith3 ] ) degenerate to ( [ 323 ] ) .",
    "in this letter we gave necessary and sufficient conditions for the maximal entanglement of bipartite nonorthogonal pure states ( [ nstate ] ) . we then applied these conditions to entangled coherent states and explicitly constructed some new types of maximally entangled coherent states .",
    "apart from the antisymmetric example ( [ wellknown ] ) , these maximally entangled coherent states are novel in that they have relative phases other than @xmath12 . in the limit when the coherence parameter tends to zero ,",
    "these maximally entangled coherent states give rise to maximally entangled bell - like states .",
    "we intend to generalize this formalism to the case of mixed states and consider possible applications in the area of quantum information .",
