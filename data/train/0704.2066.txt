    "@xcite , the ancilla for bob need have dimension no larger than @xmath89 , so there exists a state that achieves the supremum . in the following we take @xmath90 .",

    "note that if it were possible to show @xmath124 , that would imply @xmath125 .",
    "this is because , if one allows larger dimensions of @xmath34 and @xmath35 for a given @xmath3 , @xmath115 is unchanged , but @xmath40 ( as discussed in sec .",

    "a counterexample to @xmath125 was given by ref .",

    "this capacity is related to the entanglement assisted capacity of the channel @xmath135 .",
    "in particular , @xmath136 so @xmath137 it is clear from the definition of the capacity @xmath138 that it is less restrictive than @xmath130 , but it is more restrictive than @xmath66 . thus @xmath139 .    we can also obtain the result using the standard formula for the entanglement assisted channel capacity . recall that the channel capacity is given by @xcite @xmath140 where @xmath43 is a pure state with @xmath141 as the reduced density operator .",

    "let @xmath141 be the maximally mixed state in @xmath34 , and let @xmath43 be a maximally entangled state between @xmath34 and @xmath142 . then @xmath143 the entropy @xmath144 is the entropy of the subsystem @xmath34 after applying @xmath3 , and can not exceed @xmath108 .",
    "thus we find that , for this choice of @xmath127 , @xmath145 . because we also have eq .",
    ", this implies that @xmath146 .",
    "this method of proof is closely related to the more explicit scheme given in the preceding section .",
    "the proof of the capacity formula yields an ensemble equivalent to what we have given above .",
    "we may also use the same reasoning for communication from bob to alice , to obtain the inequality @xmath147",
    "with these results , we have the set of inequalities between the entangling and holevo capacities summarised in table [ table ] . the inequality @xmath148 was shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , and the inequality @xmath149 was shown conditionally upon numerical results in ref .",
    "the two - qudit inequalities that we have proven here are weaker than those for the two - qubit case , and it is natural to ask if the two - qubit inequalities may be extended to the two - qudit case . ref .",

    "thus , the inequality can also be violated for two - qudit unitaries .",
    "part of the significance of the results in ref .",
    "@xcite is that there is an exponential separation between the entanglement capacity and communication ( or holevo ) capacity .",
    "this demonstrates that the close numerical relationship observed for two - qubit operations @xcite does not hold in higher dimensions .",
    "however , for the new entanglement capacities that have been defined here , exponential separations are not obtained in many cases . for @xmath3",
    "equal to the operation @xmath215 of ref .",
    "@xcite , it is easily seen that @xmath222 .",
    "in addition , because @xmath223 there is no exponential separation between @xmath224 and @xmath67 .",
    "similarly , we have @xmath225 .",
    "we find exponential separation between @xmath55 and @xmath226 , and between @xmath227 and @xmath228 . in each case , the entangling capacity is polynomial in @xmath229 , whereas the holevo capacity is @xmath230 .",
    "we also have exponential separation between @xmath231 and @xmath69 provided we allow expanded dimensions for @xmath34 and @xmath35 ( so @xmath232 ) .",
    "if we do not allow expanded dimensions , we do nt have sufficient information to determine if there is exponential separation .",
    "( solid line ) and @xmath224 ( dotted line ) for the unitary given in ref .",
    "@xcite and various subsystem dimensions @xmath233 ( in @xcite @xmath234).,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    another interesting aspect of these results is that there is exponential separation between @xmath25 and @xmath8 .",
    "in fact , numerical calculations indicate that @xmath25 does not exceed 2 for these states ( see fig .",
    "[ entang ] ) , whereas @xmath235 .",
    "recall that the state @xmath23 in the definition of @xmath25 may be used to implement the unitary @xmath3 given the correct results for local bell measurements . if this method for implementing @xmath3 is applied to the correct initial state , then entanglement of @xmath230 will be obtained , despite the entangled resource state having low entanglement .",
    "we may also use the results of ref .",
    "@xcite to deduce results for bipartite unitaries with maximum entanglement capability . from ref .",
    "@xcite , if a unitary on subsystems of dimensions @xmath92 and @xmath89 produces entanglement of @xmath158 ( for @xmath236 ) , then this entanglement may be produced for an initial state of the form @xmath88 .",
    "thus @xmath237 . from the results given above",
    ", we also have @xmath238 .",
    "similarly , for @xmath239 , if @xmath240 then @xmath241 .",
    "in the case of two - qubit unitaries , it is known that the inequalities between entanglement capacity and holevo capacity @xmath148 and @xmath149 hold @xcite . the methods used to prove these inequalities use results that are specific to the case of qubits , and can not be generalised to the case of qudits ( except for restricted classes of unitaries ) .",
    "in addition , ref .",
    "@xcite shows that these inequalities can be violated for two - qudit unitaries .",
    "here we have shown that if alternative definitions of the entangling capacities based on the jamiokowski isomorphism @xcite are used , then we can obtain analogous inequalities for all two - qudit unitaries .",
    "in addition , we have shown that there is a close connection between these inequalities and the theory of entanglement assisted channel capacities .",
    "these results complement those of ref .",
    "@xcite , where inequalities between a restricted form of the holevo capacity and the entangling capacity were proven .",
    "together with the results shown here , we obtain the set of inequalities @xmath242 these inequalities do not give an ordering between @xmath243 and @xmath9 or between @xmath244 and @xmath8 .",
    "this is not possible , because there are examples of cases where @xmath245 and @xmath246 @xcite , and examples where @xmath247 and @xmath248 @xcite .",
    "these results demonstrate that we can not generalise the method of proof used here to show the corresponding inequalities for @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "however , we have given conditions on the unitary such that the inequalities @xmath214 or @xmath196 are satisfied .",
    "although the conditions in the two cases are not identical , they are very similar .",
    "this approach gives a more elegant method of showing @xmath214 in the two - qubit case than that used in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "although exponential separations between entanglement and communication capacities were demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite , for the example in ref .",
    "@xcite there are not exponential separations between @xmath249 and @xmath244 .",
    "whether there are cases of unitaries for which there is exponential separation between these capacities is an interesting topic for future study .",
