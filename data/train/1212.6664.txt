    "the dramatic increase in the number of known gamma - ray pulsars since the launch of the _ fermi gamma - ray space telescope _ offers the first opportunity to study a sizeable population of these high - energy sources .",
    "the _ fermi _ large area telescope ( lat , @xcite ) has discovered pulsed @xmath0-ray signals from more than 100 objects @xcite , revolutionizing our view of them and marking the birth of new high - energy pulsar sub - families , such as millisecond @xcite and radio - quiet @xmath0-ray pulsars @xcite , that are as numerous as the classical one .",
    "the wealth of detections confirms the importance of the @xmath0-ray channel in the overall energy budget of rotation - powered pulsars and points to emission models in which the @xmath0-ray production occurs in the outer magnetosphere along open - field lines ( outer gap / slot gap , @xcite ) and paves the way for our understanding of the three - dimensional structure and electrodynamics of neutron star magnetospheres .    in a sense ,",
    "the most important objects to constrain pulsar models are the `` extreme '' ones , accounting for the tails of the population distribution in energetics , age and magnetic field . in this respect ,",

    "fermi_-lat pulsars ( p=444 ms ) , was discovered in a blind search during the first three months of _ fermi_-lat scanning @xcite .",
    "it is located off the galactic plane , at a latitude of b@xmath5 - 16@xmath4 . while morla is not the oldest rotation - powered pulsar ( @xmath6=5.4 @xmath7 10@xmath8 yr ) - with an age similar to the well - known `` three musketeers '' @xcite",
    "- it is the slowest rotator among _ fermi _ pulsars .",
    "its spin - down luminosity , as low as @xmath9 = 5.9 @xmath7 10@xmath10 erg s@xmath2 , makes it one of the non - recycled @xmath0-ray pulsars with the smallest rotational energy loss detected so far .",
    "this suggests that psr j0357 + 3205 is quite nearby : by scaling its @xmath0-ray flux using the `` pseudo - distance '' relation from @xcite , we obtain a distance of @xmath1500 pc , making morla a natural target for x - ray observations .    exploiting a joint _ chandra _ and _ noao _ program",
    ", @xcite found the x - ray counterpart of the @xmath0-ray pulsar to be located at r.a.(j2000 ) = 03@xmath1157@xmath1252@xmath13.32 , dec.(j2000 ) = + 32@xmath40520.6 `` ( 0.25 '' error radius , 68% confidence level ) .",
    "the pulsar x - ray emission was found to be consistent with a purely magnetospheric , non - thermal origin leading to a value of the @xmath0-to - x flux ratio of @xmath11000 , well below the mean for radio - quiet pulsars ( @xmath19000 , @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , the poor statistics precluded a clear detection of a thermal component in the neutron star spectrum as well as a full characterization of its column density and distance . nevertheless , the _ chandra _ data unveiled the presence of an extended structure protruding from the pulsar and extending @xmath39 in length , which would correspond to @xmath11.3 pc for a pulsar distance of 500 pc , and @xmath11.5 in width .",

    "_ noao _ optical images , taken in v and k bands , show no hints of correlated , diffuse emission .",
    "no extended source was detected either in public radio or infrared surveys .",
    "the lack of any h@xmath14 emission around the pulsar @xcite points to a full ionized , likely hot ( @xmath15 k ) , ism .",
    "+ recently , using a new _ chandra _ observation , @xcite detected the pulsar s proper motionof 165@xmath1630 mas yr@xmath2 , in the direction away from the tail and parallel to the galactic plane . assuming a pulsar distance of 500 pc , this results in a lower limit velocity of 390 km s@xmath2 , making it a relatively high - velocity pulsar @xcite .",
    "many extended tails of x - ray emission have been discovered , associated with a number of rotation powered pulsars ( e.g. @xcite ) within the framework of a ram - pressure dominated pulsar wind nebula ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "however , the unusual phenomenology of the feature we observed is barely consistent with such a picture .",
    "there is no hint of diffuse emission in the pulsar surroundings , where bright emission from the wind termination shock should be seen ( as observed in other known cases ) .",
    "moreover , the asymmetric brightness profile of the tail , with its sharp north - eastern edge and its broad maximum at large distance from the pulsar is remarkably different from any other observed structure ( with the possible exception of the peculiar feature associated with psr b2224 + 65 , powering the guitar nebula - see @xcite ) .",
    "the mere existence of the tail is also problematic for a pulsar with such a low @xmath9 as j0357 + 3205 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    in order to assess the nature of the tail and its relationship with the pulsar , as well as to better constrain the pulsar emission properties and physics",

    "a complete study of the timing behavior of morla in x - rays was carried out as well .",
    "finally , we studied the properties of the tail , in order to characterize the mechanisms responsible for its emission .",

    "we applied a gaussian filter with a kernel radius of 5 \" .",
    "the image clearly shows the straylight effect , probably due to the bright source x persei that dominates the x - ray sky @xmath170 to the southwest of morla , with a flux of @xmath110@xmath18 erg @xmath19 s@xmath2 .",
    "x - ray straylight in epic is produced by photons which experience single reflection by the mirror hyperbolae and which reach the sensitive area of the camera and produce near - annular structures in the image . in order to study the background sources in the _ xmm - newton _ observation , we evaluated the spectrum of our straylight annuli .",
    "this is consistent , at low energies , with the x persei spectrum found by @xcite , thus we added and froze these components in the spectral model of sources affected by this phenomenon .",

    "we propose a thermal bremsstrahlung model as an alternative explanation of the tail emission . in this scenario ,",
    "the emission comes from the shocked ism material heated up to x - ray temperatures .",
    "this model gives full account of the peculiar features of the tail : + - the lack of any detectable spatial evolution in the tail spectrum is due to the long bremsstrahlung cool - down time ; + - the peculiar asymmetries of the brightness profile can be interpreted in terms of small changes in the ism density that strongly affect the brehmsstralung emissivity ; + - most of the energy in the pre - shock flow is carried by the ions , while the electron temperature is responsible for the x - ray emission ; the coulomb heating time of the electrons behind the shock is fully in agreement with the lack of any detected nebular emission near the pulsar ; + - the value of n@xmath21 measured in the tail agrees both with the value obtained for the pulsar and the galactic value .",

    "<S> using a new _ xmm - newton _ observation , we have characterized the x - ray properties of the middle - aged radio - quiet @xmath0-ray pulsar j0357 + 3205 ( named morla ) and its tail . </S>",
    "<S> the x - ray emission from the pulsar is consistent with a magnetospheric non - thermal origin plus a thermal emission from a hot spot ( or hot spots ) . </S>",
    "<S> the lack of a thermal component from the whole surface makes morla the coldest neutron star in its age range . </S>",
    "<S> we found marginal evidence for a double - peaked modulation of the x - ray emission . </S>",
    "<S> the study of the 9-long tail confirmed the lack of extended emission near the pulsar itself . </S>",
    "<S> the tail shows a very asymmetric brightness profile and its spectrum lacks any spatial variation . </S>",
    "<S> we found the nebular emission to be inconsistent with a classical bow - shock , ram - pressure dominated pulsar wind nebula . </S>",
    "<S> we propose thermal bremsstrahlung as an alternative mechanism for morla s tail emission . in this scenario , </S>",
    "<S> the tail emission comes from the shocked interstellar medium ( ism ) material heated up to x - ray temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> this can fully explain the peculiar features of the tail , assuming a hot , moderately dense interstellar medium around the pulsar . for a bremsstrahlung - emitting tail </S>",
    "<S> , we can estimate the pulsar distance to be between 300 and 900 pc . </S>",
    "<S> a pulsar velocity of @xmath11900 km s@xmath2 is required - which would make morla the pulsar with the largest velocity - and high inclination angles ( @xmath370@xmath4 ) are preferred . </S>",
    "<S> we propose morla s nebula as the first example of a new `` turtle s tail '' class of thermally - emitting nebulae associated to high velocity pulsars . </S>"
