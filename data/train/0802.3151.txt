    "for a long time the mechanism of superconductivity of bardeen , cooper and schrieffer @xcite based on the assumption of * *  * * s - wave singlet pairing * *  * * remained sufficient for explanation of * *  * * properties of almost all existing superconductors .",
    "however * * , * * the situation has changed in the last two decades .",
    "it has been established that in high @xmath5 superconductors the d - wave singlet pairing is responsible for the superconductivity @xcite .",
    "a triplet p - wave pairing was suggested to explain properties of materials with heavy fermions mineev .",
    "recent intensive studies of the strontium ruthenate ( sr@xmath6ruo@xmath7 ) showed that superconductivity in this compound was also * *  * * due to the triplet p - wave pairing mechanism @xcite .",
    "the p - wave pairing was considered to be an essential ingredient for forming the triplet cooper pairs because , in contrast to the conventional singlet pairing , it allowed to satisfy the pauli principle .",
    "*  *    a more exotic type of triplet pairing was proposed by berezinskii berez as a possible mechanism of superfluidity of @xmath8 . according to this suggestion",
    "the triplet pairing might have a singlet space symmetry . * *  * * the wave function of the cooper pairs , @xmath9 @xmath10 , suggested by berezinskii was symmetric in both * *  * * momentum and spin space . at the same time * * , * * in order to fulfill the pauli principle , the function @xmath11 taken at equal times must be zero .",
    "the only possibility to satisfy all these requirements is to assume that the wave function in the matsubara representation @xmath12 should be an odd function of @xmath13 so that @xmath14 .",
    "this is exactly what was suggested by berezinskii and one may call such a state odd triplet superconductivity ( superfluidity)*. *    unfortunately , this type of pairing was not more than a hypothesis and no microscopic model leading to the odd triplet superconductivity was suggested in ref .",
    ". moreover , * *  * * it turned out later that in superfluid @xmath8 another type of pairing was responsible for the superfluidity @xcite and the scenario for the odd triplet superconductivity remained justified neither theoretically nor experimentally . *  *    it was discovered only recently @xcite that the odd triplet superconductivity could be realized in a simple system consisting of an ordinary bcs superconductor ( s ) and ferromagnet ( f ) with a nonhomogeneous magnetization @xmath15 ( for details , see also a review @xcite and references therein ) . in case of an sf system ( for example , an sf bilayer ) with a homogeneous magnetization in f ,",
    "two types of the condensate arise in the system - a singlet component with a condensate wave function @xmath16 and a triplet component @xmath17 with the zero projection of the total spin of the cooper pair on the quantization axis ,",
    "@xmath18 @xcite .",
    "both the * *  * * components decay in f over a short length @xmath19 in the diffusive limit ( @xmath20 ) and over the mean free path @xmath21 in the limit @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the diffusion coefficient and @xmath2 is the exchange energy . since the exchange energy @xmath2 is much larger than the temperature @xmath24 , the decay length @xmath25 is much shorter than the depth of the condensate penetration into a nonmagnetic metal n in case of an sn system .    in ref .",
    "@xcite a diffusive sf system with a domain wall ( dw ) at the sf interface was considered .",
    "it was shown that in this case not only the singlet and triplet @xmath18 components but also a triplet @xmath26 component arises in the system .",
    "the triplet component with a nonzero projection of the total spin @xmath27 penetrates the ferromagnet over a length @xmath28 that does not depend on the exchange energy @xmath2 and equals @xmath29 in the diffusive limit , where @xmath30 is the matsubara frequency .",
    "this triplet component was called a long - range triplet component ( lrtc ) .    in order to carry out calculation of physical quantities explicitly * * , * * it was assumed in ref .",
    "@xcite that the width of the domain wall @xmath31 was much larger than the mean free path @xmath32 and that * *  * * the proximity effect was weak due to a non - ideal sf interface ( the reflection coefficient at the interface @xmath33 is close to 1 ) .",
    "the magnetization vector @xmath34 in the domain wall was assumed to rotate linearly with the coordinate @xmath35 normal the the sf interface so that the angle @xmath36 between @xmath34 and @xmath0-axis was equal to @xmath37 in the interval @xmath38 and @xmath39 at @xmath40 . in this case",
    "the condensate functions in f could be * *  * * found exactly from the linearized usadel equation .    as a result , * *  * * the amplitude @xmath41 of the odd triplet @xmath26 component has been obtained in ref .",
    "@xciteexplicitly . using the known value of the function @xmath41 ,",
    "the conductance variation @xmath42 of the ferromagnet as a function of temperature @xmath24 has been determined .",
    "it turned out that , in contrast to the sn system where the conductance variation has a maximum at some temperature ( a reentrant behavior ) avz , gubmar , naz , lamvol , pann , the function @xmath43 in the sf system decreased monotonously with increasing the temperature .    in subsequent works",
    "@xcite the idea about the generation of the odd triplet condensate with the non - zero projection and long range penetration into the ferromagnets was discussed using somewhat different models and approaches . *  *    the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite also considered a model with a dw at the sf interface but , in contrast to ref .",
    "@xcite , * *  * * assumed that the length of the dw was shorter than the mean free path .",
    "although nothing was said in the paper about the type of the sf interface , they considered apparently the limit of the ideal sf interface ( the transmission coefficient did not enter the equations presented in that paper ) .",
    "it was assumed that in the region of the domain wall the superconducting condensate had to be described by an eilenberger equation . at distances exceeding the mean free path one should have the usadel equation and the eilenberger equation",
    "might be used to derive a boundary condition for the usadel equation .",
    "*  *    without presenting a solution of the eilenberger equation the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite displayed in a simple form an effective boundary condition for the linearized usadel equation .",
    "this boundary condition introduced the triplet condensate as a solution of the usadel equation and the latter was used to determine the contribution to the conductivity due to the triplet condensate penetrating the ferromagnet over long distances .",
    "another approach to finding the odd triplet component was suggested in refs.@xcite . in that approach the properties of the sf interface",
    "are characterized by a scattering matrix the elements of which may be considered as phenomenological parameters . in this approach",
    "one does not need knowing the detailed structure of the sf interface and can proceed calculating physical quantities using these parameters . * *  * * the amplitude of the condensate wave functions has been determined in these papers numerically .",
    "analytical results were obtained in the framework of this approach in a recent paper @xcite , where a ballistic sfs system was considered .    however , from the physical point of view this approach is equivalent to introducing a thin domain wall .",
    "if one wants to know details of how the triplet component is generated one has to solve again the microscopic eilenberger equation for a certain configuration of the magnetic moment , which is similar to considering the model of ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we reconsider the problem of the generation of the odd triplet component by a thin domain wall located at the sf interface .",
    "we assume that the size the domain wall exceeds the interatomic distances , which allows us to use the quasiclassical eilenberger equation eilenberger , lo . * *  * * below , we solve the eilenberger equation assuming a weak proximity effect and show that some effective boundary condition for the usadel equation can indeed be written .",
    "however , the results we obtain disagree with those of ref .",
    "it turns out that , in contrast to the formula of ref .",
    "@xcite , the effective boundary condition * *  * * for the usadel equation crucially depends on the relation between the exchange energy @xmath2 , elastic scattering rate @xmath44 and other parameters .",
    "moreover , the absence of the transmission coefficient @xmath45 in formulas of ref.@xcite makes us to suppose that the sf interface was assumed to be ideal .",
    "however , in this case one has to solve non - linearized eilenberger equation and we believe that this can be done only numerically . therefore we suspect that the form of the boundary condition presented in ref . @xcite is not well justified . *  *    by now , several attempts to observe this new type of the condensate - odd triplet component - have been undertaken .",
    "in a recent work @xcite the dc josephson effect has been measured in an sfs josephson junction consisting of two superconductors ( nb ) and  the ferromagnet cro@xmath6 where free electrons have only one direction of spins .",
    "the josephson critical current has been observed in junctions with a separation between s electrodes of about @xmath46 .",
    "obviously , the josephson coupling between the superconductors may only be due to the lrtc . in ref.@xcite",
    "a conductance variation @xmath42 was measured in an al / ho system below the critical temperature of al .",
    "the order of magnitude of the observed change of the conductance can really be explained in terms of the lrtc . in this ferromagnet ,",
    "a magnetic inhomogeneity is natural because ho is a helicoidal ferromagnet such that the magnetization vector rotates in space forming a spiral with the period @xmath47 .",
    "already earlier experiments on sf structures have also brought an evidence in favor of the existence of a condensate penetrating into the ferromagnet over a long distance @xcite .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that in recent experiments on sfs junctions ryaz , kontos , blum , bauer , where the sign - reversal of the critical current ( @xmath48state ) has been detected , the magnetization was not homogeneous , and therefore the triplet component had also to exist and contribute to the critical current .",
    "the problem of the triplet component in multilayered sfs junctions @xcite and in junctions with neel s domain walls @xcite was studied in recent theoretical papers .",
    "it was shown in particular that the lrtc may also lead to a non - monotonous dependence of the critical josephson current in sfs junctions anishchanka06,champel08 . in order to succeed in searching the lrtc in sf structures",
    "it is very important to use materials that might give a large amplitude of the lrtc .",
    "therefore * * , * * it is desirable to have analytical formulas for the amplitude of the lrtc in a wide range of parameters characterizing the system . * *  * * calculation of these amplitudes is the ultimate goal of the present work .",
