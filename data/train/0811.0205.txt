    "in recent years , large - scale diffuse radio sources have been discovered to be associated with the intracluster medium ( icm ) of over 50 clusters of galaxies .",
    "these features are unique probes of the non - thermal particle populations and magnetic fields within the cluster , and are believed to be important tracers of merger / formation dynamics .",
    "the majority of these sources were found by searching the environs of rich galaxy clusters for diffuse radio emission unassociated with active agn @xcite .",
    "but is there also a magnetized , relativistic plasma associated with lower density regions of the cosmic web , such as groups and filaments of galaxies ?",
    "cosmological simulations predict complicated networks of accretion / merger shocks in these low density regions , which could accelerate particles , compress magnetic fields , and illuminate magnetized plasma if it exists ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "unbiased searches for synchrotron signatures of these shocks are needed to confirm these predictions .",
    "one such diffuse source , of ambiguous origin , is 0809 + 39 @xcite , discovered through a blind search for diffuse radio emission in the wenss survey @xcite .",
    "the system showed no obvious associations with an active radio galaxy .",
    "several poor clusters were found in the vicinity , which suggests a similar origin to radio relic and halo sources .",
    "however , lacking any evidence for cluster x - ray emission , its radio luminosity far exceeded the standard radio / x - ray ratios for these classes of sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we present a systematic study of the spectral , polarimetric , morphological and environmental properties of 0809 + 39 using observations taken with the westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ) and the very large array ( vla ) .",
    "we explore the origin of the diffuse radio emission and evaluate where 0809 + 39 falls in the parameter space of known extragalactic radio sources .",
    "we discuss observations and data reduction in @xmath12 , and in @xmath13 we outline image production and analysis , including our application of rotation measure synthesis @xcite . in @xmath14",
    "we present archival optical and x - ray data , and in @xmath15 we discuss the implications of our findings , followed by a summary of our key messages .    for calculations in this paper ,",
    "we assume @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 .",
    "we define the optically thin synchrotron spectrum as @xmath5 throughout .",
    "the diffuse source 0809 + 39 was observed for 13 hours over two nights in p - band ( 350  mhz ) with the westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ) in january of 2006 .",
    "the array was in the maxi - short configuration with the shortest baseline being 36  m. one primary flux and one polarized calibrator ( as a pair ) were observed at the beginning and end of each night . for the primary flux calibrators we observed 3c147 and 3c295 , and for the polarized calibrators we observed da240 and 3c303 .",
    "we used the wsrt wide band correlator to cover a frequency range from 310 - 390  mhz with eight 10  mhz wide bands , each with 64 channels and full stokes parameters .",
    "we applied a hanning taper to the spectral data , and every other channel was selected for analysis yielding an effective spectral resolution of about 0.31  mhz . after removing the end channels in each band and editing for strong rfi , 197 channels remained in the final analysis , for a total bandwidth of 61  mhz .",
    "the vla observations were taken for 2.8 hours in december of 2005 in the d configuration , and the flux calibrators 3c48 and 3c286 were used .",
    "the data were taken using the spectrometer with no cross - had polarizations .",
    "we analyzed only the pseudo - continuum data for this analysis , with a frequency of 1.4649  ghz , a bandwidth of 12.5  mhz , and no polarization information .",
    "the calibration and reduction of the wsrt and vla data was performed using the nrao s astronomical image processing system ( aips ) . for the wsrt data ,",
    "the total intensity in each of the 8 bands was calibrated independently using standard procedures and the fluxes in the vla calibrator manual for 3c147 and 3c295 .",
    "the vla pseudo - continuum data set was calibrated using standard procedures .",
    "we did several iterations of amplitude and phase self - calibration on each data set .      due to the fact that wsrt observes with orthogonal linear feeds ( x and y ) , the polarization calibration in classic aips involved several non - standard steps .",
    "wsrt polarization leakage terms are highly frequency dependent , so after the total intensity calibration , each channel was split into an independent uv - data set and the leakage terms were then solved for using the aips task lpcal .",
    "stokes q values were calculated from ( yy - xx)/2 , while the stokes u values are -(xy+yx)/2 .",
    "an additional correction is needed for stokes u , to remove the instrumental phase offset between the x and y receivers using the polarized calibrators .",
    "faraday rotation causes the stokes q and u amplitudes of the polarized calibrators to oscillate across the band .",
    "the x - y phase offset was found for each channel by forcing the vector averaged stokes @xmath6 visibilities for the polarized calibrators to match ( offset by a quarter wavelength ) the @xmath7 sine wave formed by faraday rotation .",
    "the observed sign of the faraday rotation for 3c303 ( + 13  rad  m@xmath8 , @xcite ) forced stokes u values to be a quarter wavelength _",
    "after _ the stokes q values with increasing wavelength , breaking the final sign ambiguity and finishing the polarization calibration",
    ". however , we note that the intrinsic position angle of the polarization is still highly uncertain due to errors in the rotation measure , as discussed in @xmath13.3 .",
    "after calibration , we created i , q , and u images for each of the 197 wsrt channels .",
    "all images and self - calibrations were done in aips with the tasks imagr and calib respectively .",
    "each channel image was cleaned with imagr with 70,000 clean components and a gain of 0.1 .",
    "the synthesized beam varied from @xmath9@xmath10@xmath11 to @xmath12@xmath10@xmath13 across the band , so all of the images were uv - tapered and restored to a common resolution of @xmath12@xmath10@xmath13 .",
    "typical rms noise levels for the single - channel \\{i , q , u } maps were \\{1.0,0.5,0.5 }  mjy / beam , respectively .",
    "the final wsrt i map is shown in figure [ wsrti ] .",
    "this map is the simple average of all the individual channel i maps ( @xmath12@xmath10@xmath13 beam ) .",
    "the average frequency is 351 mhz and the observed noise is @xmath14188  @xmath15jy / beam . the diffuse emission is seen to have two distinct components which we have labeled n@xmath16 and s@xmath16 . at this resolution ,",
    "n@xmath16 partially blends into the compact sources @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "as shown in @xmath13.2.2 , some of these  compact \" sources also have substructure .",
    "flux and size properties for both diffuse sources are summarized in table 1 .",
    "we describe all the discrete radio sources in the next subsection .",
    "figure [ vlai ] shows our vla i map , which has a noise level of 90  @xmath15jy / beam and a 40@xmath1940@xmath20 restoring beam .",
    "we have labeled the discrete radio sources , and have shown vla first @xcite images of some of the more interesting ones .",
    "the sources f1-f7 are adjacent to or embedded in the diffuse emission .",
    "f2 is a 66 mjy wide - angle tailed ( wat : @xcite ) radio galaxy at z=0.196 ( from sdss : @xcite ) , and f3 and f5 are identified with sdss galaxies with photometric redshifts of z=0.249 and z=0.255 , respectively . in s@xmath16 , the source f6",
    "is marginally detected in first ( not shown ) , and is coincident with a z=0.04 galaxy in sdss .",
    "f7 is a first radio point source ( not shown ) with no optical identification in sdss .",
    "the apparent bridge of emission between n@xmath16 and @xmath17 peaks on a spiral galaxy at z=0.041 ( see figure [ sdssgray ] ) and is most likely diffuse disk emission from that galaxy .      for the spectral analysis we matched the uv - range of the vla and wsrt data before comparison .",
    "the spectral index ( @xmath21 ) map ( figure [ alpha ] ) was created in aips using the task comb .",
    "any pixel that was not at least 10@xmath22 above the noise in either map was blanked .",
    "both sources are steep spectrum , and table 1 lists the integrated @xmath21 obtained from fitting the total flux of each component at 1.4  ghz and 351  mhz to a power law .        with the 197 channels and @xmath23  mhz total bandwidth of our wsrt p - band data , it is possible to simultaneously determine the rotation measure distribution within each beam and remove the effects of bandwidth depolarization .",
    "when searching for polarized synchrotron emission , which is often at very low surface brightness levels , one would like to observe over a large bandwidth ( @xmath24 ) to maximize the signal / noise ratio .",
    "however , this normally results in depolarization from the vectoral cancellation of the stokes q and u signals that have been faraday rotated from one side of the band to the other .",
    "some radio telescopes allow for a large observing bandwidth to be split into many narrow channels ( westerbork being one of them ) , so an obvious solution would be to make an image of the polarized amplitude in each channel and average them together .",
    "unfortunately , polarized galactic foreground emission is ubiquitous ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this is actually above the surface brightness of some diffuse extragalactic regions of interest , so adding the scalar polarization intensity of each channel will cause the galactic emission to add coherently as well .",
    "this increases the background and drowns out the desired diffuse extragalactic source .",
    "@xcite presented a new technique to eliminate the confounding effects of intervening faraday rotation ( bandwidth depolarization and galactic foreground contamination ) by searching  rotation measure space \" for polarized emission .",
    "the technique proceeds as follows : assume a rotation measure for the source , then derotate the polarization vector in each individual channel ( to a reference wavelength @xmath25 ) to correct for this and make a polarization map from the average of the derotated channels .",
    "if the source in fact had the assumed rotation measure , the channels would add coherently , allowing for the full sensitivity of the entire bandwidth .",
    "the resulting map at a given faraday depth , @xmath26 , is approximately given by    @xmath27    where n is the number of maps ( channels ) used and @xmath28 is the complex polarization at channel j. the units of @xmath29 are jy / beam / rmtf , where rmtf stand for the rotation measure transfer function .",
    "the rmtf is the response of a source with emission at a single faraday depth .",
    "if one were able to sample an infinite range of @xmath30 , the rmtf would be a delta function in rm space , but incomplete sampling induces side - lobe structures in a manner similar to side - lobes in the beam pattern of an interferometer due to incomplete sampling of the uv - plane .",
    "the key step is to apply eq .",
    "( 1 ) for a wide range of rotation measures , creating a rotation measure cube ( rm - cube ) , and search for coherent structures within this cube .",
    "we processed the 197 q and u maps in idl utilizing eq .",
    "( 1 ) to create the final rm - cube , with faraday depths running from -200  rad  m@xmath8 to + 200  rad  m@xmath8 in steps of 1  rad  m@xmath8 .",
    "this method has been successfully used to detect very diffuse polarized emission in the region of the perseus cluster @xcite .    near values of @xmath31 , polarized emission from our own galaxy fills the field of view .",
    "this emission has a typical surface brightness of @xmath01  mjy / beam / rtmf , and in the vicinity of 0809 + 39 it peaks at @xmath32 + 6  rad  m@xmath8 .",
    "the polarized emission in n@xmath16 peaks near + 12  rad  m@xmath8 , though there is still a significant amount of galactic emission present at this faraday depth . at values of @xmath33rad",
    "m@xmath8 , very little of the galactic emission remains . as a result",
    ", the rms noise of the images decreases with increasing @xmath34 , to @xmath030  @xmath15jy / beam / rmtf for @xmath35100  rad  m@xmath8 .",
    "some of the emission that @xcite detected in the field of the perseus cluster with rm - synthesis was later found to likely be galactic in origin @xcite . in the case of 0809 + 39 ,",
    "n@xmath16 , while not segregated significantly from the galactic emission in faraday depth , is an order of magnitude stronger in surface brightness , making a galactic origin unlikely .",
    "we can also use this rm - cube to find faraday spectra , which is just @xmath29 from equation 1 for a single pixel or region in the sky .",
    "figure [ fspec ] shows the average spectrum of a @xmath36@xmath10@xmath36 region centered on n@xmath16 , along with the rmtf for our frequency sampling .",
    "the faraday spectrum of n@xmath16 is very close to a  point source \" in faraday space , especially when compared to a typical galactic spectrum also shown in figure [ fspec ] .",
    "the diffuse galactic radiation along the line of sight to 0809 + 39 has emission at multiple faraday depths .",
    "this galactic signal must also be present in our spectrum of n@xmath16 , but is lower than the side - lobe level of n@xmath16 itself .",
    "we used the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss : @xcite ) polarization image of 0809 + 39 , along with our measured rm , to find the absolute position angle @xmath37 of n@xmath16 .",
    "figure [ nvsspol ] shows nvss total intensity contours and magnetic field orientation ( which is @xmath38 ) , corrected for the average @xmath26 of n@xmath16 . due to the difference in resolution between the rm - cube and the nvss , and the fact that the gradient in @xmath26 across the source translates into only a @xmath39 , we did not do a pixel - by - pixel de - rotation .",
    "the magnetic field runs along the long axis of n@xmath16 , and shows evidence of following the curvature in the southern end .",
    "our faraday corrected wsrt magnetic field vectors are plotted in figure [ wsrtpol ] .",
    "we obtained the polarization from the complex rm - cube at @xmath40  rad  m@xmath8 , where n@xmath16 peaks .",
    "given the uncertainties in absolute position angle when derotating from @xmath41=90  cm to @xmath41=0 ( e.g. , @xmath42 when @xmath43  rad  m@xmath8 ) , we globally rotated the vectors so that the magnetic field orientation of n@xmath16 matches that seen in figure [ nvsspol ] .",
    "we placed the polarized intensity cut - off such that some of the diffuse galactic emission can be seen .",
    "one can see the discontinuity in angle between the galactic polarization and the brighter n@xmath16 emission .",
    "the detection of n@xmath16 in the nvss survey allows for examination of the degree of de - polarization . the fractional polarization , m , decreases from @xmath44% at 21 cm ( matched to the wsrt resolution ) to @xmath45% at 92  cm .",
    "assuming for a moment that this depolarization is due only to internal faraday de - polarization @xcite , we calculate the necessary internal faraday rotation to be @xmath46  rad  m@xmath8 .",
    "the upper limit intrinsic width of n@xmath16 is @xmath47  rad  m@xmath8 , so the depolarization could be due to internal faraday de - polarization . at 351  mhz ,",
    "s@xmath16 is not polarized at a 3@xmath22 level of 9% .",
    "we now turn our attention to the optical and x - ray environment of 0809 + 39 . since all radio halo and relic sources found thus far exist in or adjacent to the hot gas of galaxy clusters , we searched for thermal emission from x - ray clusters in the vicinity of 0809 + 39 and investigated the surrounding optical field .",
    "figure [ rosat ] shows the rosat broad ( 0.1 - 2.4 kev ) continuum emission in the region of 0809 + 39 with vla l - band radio contours overlayed . to put the low observed brightness of the x - ray field of 0809 + 39 in context , we have also plotted three x - ray selected clusters at three different redshifts .",
    "the clusters are \\{rxcj2324.3 + 1439 , rxcj1353.0 + 0509 , rxcj2155.6 + 1231 } with redshifts of \\{0.042 , 0.079 , 0.192 } and x - ray luminosities of l@xmath48=\\{0.97 , 1.97 , 5.51}@xmath49  erg  s@xmath50 , respectively @xcite .",
    "the cluster redshifts were selected to mimic the relevant systems we have identified in @xmath14.2 .",
    "it is clear that no diffuse x - ray emission like that present in the x - ray selected clusters is present in the rosat 0809 + 39 field .",

    "peak 3 is offset @xmath53 from a 2mass galaxy at @xmath54 , which is also the first source f1 in figure [ vlai ] .",
    "after subtracting out the four point sources , we found no evidence of excess diffuse emission . using webpimms",

    "this is illustrated by figure [ sdssgray ] , which shows an sdss mosaic r image with vla contours .",
    "to set the scale , the large spiral galaxies in this image are at a redshift of roughly z  =  0.04 .",

    "we also show in figures [ histo0809 ] and [ sdss0809 ] , for comparison , the results from two x - ray selected clusters at similar redshifts ( discussed in @xmath15.1 ) . to assess the relative richness of this group / cluster",
    ", we followed the analysis used in @xcite for estimating the richness of clusters found in the poss - ii survey .",

    "we hereafter assume that both components are of extragalactic origin .",
    "there are many different types of extragalactic large - scale diffuse radio emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but they in general fall within one of two basic classes : 1 ) those directly powered by current agn activity ; 2 ) those associated with processes in the intracluster medium ( icm ) .",
    "we include in the second class emission related to processes in the intergalactic plasma of galaxy filaments @xcite . in the vast majority of cases , determining the identification is straightforward . either the diffuse region",
    "is directly connected ( via jets or filamentary bridges ) to an active radio galaxy , or there is a rich cluster of galaxies nearby whose potential well ( highlighted by @xmath010@xmath62  k , x - ray emitting gas ) provides an obvious energy source for particle acceleration ( via gravitational collapse / accretion @xmath63 shocks / turbulence etc ) .    both sources in 0809 + 39 are unique in that neither of these conditions apply ( see @xcite for two similar sources ) .",
    "there are no cataloged x - ray emitting clusters nearby , only groups and poor clusters of galaxies .",
    "an agn origin for these sources is also not obvious . in this paper",
    "we narrow our analysis to the two most likely ( or least improbable ) sources for the radio emission .      in this section ,",
    "we : 1 ) rule out n@xmath16 being an extended radio lobe directly powered by the wat ; 2 ) give evidence that n@xmath16 is a classical  radio relic \" ; 3 ) compare n@xmath16 with other relics and conclude that it has an anomalously high radio / x - ray luminosity ratio ; 4 ) determine that the x - ray luminosity is appropriate for this optical richness , and is thus not to blame for the abnormal luminosity ratio ; 5 ) examine possible sources of the relativistic electrons such as direct acceleration from the thermal plasma , adiabatic compression ( only ) of fossil wat plasma , and reacceleration of fossil wat plasma .",
    "we conclude that the most likely source is reacceleration of fossil plasma from past wat activity .",
    "we first consider whether n@xmath16 could be lobe emission from an agn .",
    "the nearby wat ( f2 ) is the only reasonable candidate as an agn source .",
    "however , they are spatially well separated , with a peak to peak distance @xmath63500  kpc at z=0.2 .",

    "this corresponds to @xmath02 mpc at z=0.2 , which is a size comparable to that of a giant radio galaxy ( grg ) .",
    "however , its morphology is unlike any other grg known ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we can also consider the lifetime of particles emitting at 1.4  ghz .",
    "the minimum energy magnetic field for n@xmath16 is b@xmath64 0.6  @xmath15 g , which fixes the lorentz factor at @xmath65 and results in inverse compton losses dominating the lifetime . from @xcite    @xmath66    which for n@xmath16 is @xmath67  yr . relaxing the minimum energy requirement for magnetic field strength",
    ", we can calculate the maximum lifetime for any electron radiating at 1.4  ghz following the prescription of @xcite . assuming a redshift of z=0.2 yields a maximum lifetime of t@xmath68  yr , similar to that calculated above using b@xmath69 .",
    "if we assume a 1  kev gas temperature and only hydrogen gas the sound crossing time is t@xmath70  yr . therefore the timescale for 1.4  ghz ic losses will be much shorter than the diffusion / sound - crossing time ( from the wat to n@xmath16 ) .",
    "if the wat was the original source for the n@xmath16 plasma , e.g. from an earlier outburst , then there must have been some re - acceleration or adiabatic enhancement .",
    "this is no surprise because this has been a longstanding result for radio halos and relics .",
    "there are several lines of evidence that point toward n@xmath16 being a radio  relic \" source associated with a poor cluster at z@xmath00.2 : 1 ) both the clumping in redshift and the existence of the wat @xcite indicate the presence of a cluster ; 2 ) wats are also known to be associated with merger dynamics @xcite .",
    "additional supporting evidence for merger activity near n@xmath16 comes from the multiple x - ray peaks seen in figure [ xmmsmall ] , one of which is coincident with a z=0.27 sdss galaxy .",
    "currently all known radio relic or halo sources have been found in / near clusters in a disturbed dynamical state @xcite ; 3 ) the long axis of the diffuse emission is perpendicular to the line connecting n@xmath16 and the wat , typical of relic sources ; 4 ) the diffuse emission is highly polarized , also typical of radio relic sources ( e.g. @xcite ) ; 5 ) the magnetic fields are parallel to the long axis of the emission , suggesting shock compression .    all of these point toward n@xmath16 being either a radio phoenix or radio gischt @xcite , depending on whether the  seed \" plasma came from an extinct radio galaxy lobe or was initially accelerated at a cluster accretion shock , respectively .",
    "the curvature of the wat ( from figure [ vlai ] ) is toward the north , suggesting infall from the south . with a longest linear extent of @xmath02 mpc ,",
    "n@xmath16 is comparable to larger relic sources around rich clusters of galaxies @xcite . for radio relics where the spectral index distribution is known",

    ", we should note that the source is only a little more than a single wsrt beam thick in the transverse direction .",
    "therefore a higher resolution spectral index map is needed to confirm this .",
    "we can now ask how n@xmath16 compares to other observed radio relics .",
    "radio halos , diffuse radio emission centered on some clusters of galaxies , are known to exhibit a good correlation between their radio luminosity and the x - ray luminosity of their associated cluster ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a similar but weaker correlation for radio relics has been claimed by @xcite , who quoted @xmath71 , where k ranged from 0.8 to 2.2 .",
    "we have compiled a relatively complete list of known relics with available 1.4  ghz flux measurements and plotted their radio luminosities vs. x - ray luminosities in figure [ lrvslx ] ( compiled from * ? ? ?",

    "n@xmath16 is at least an order of magnitude too luminous ( under - luminous ) in the radio ( x - ray ) .",
    "we examine several possible explanations as to why the radio or x - ray emission from the relic source n@xmath16 is not what we would expect from the radio / x - ray luminosity relation for rich galaxy clusters . from the observed correlation , n@xmath16 should have an @xmath72 from 0.1 - 2.4  kev , but from xmm observations we measure a 3@xmath22 upper limit of @xmath73  erg  s@xmath50 .",
    "we examine the two quantities in this relation separately , starting with the x - ray luminosity .",
    "it is possible that the grouping of galaxies that n@xmath16 is associated with is massive enough to emit the expected amount of x - rays ( i.e. @xmath74  erg  s@xmath50 at 0.1 - 2.4  kev ) , but for some reason they are not observed .",
    "perhaps the grouping will have the  correct \" x - ray luminosity eventually , but we have caught it in a very early evolutionary state where the thermal gas has not reached the needed density or temperature to emit sufficiently in the x - rays .",
    "the optical properties of the wat group ( @xmath14.2 ) , however , are not representative of massive x - ray emitting clusters ( see , e.g. , @xcite for optical vs. x - ray properties of abell clusters ) . to further show this",
    ", we examined the optical properties of the x - ray selected clusters rxcj1327.0 + 0211 and rxcj2155.6 + 1231 , both of which have a similar redshift \\{0.259 , 0.192 } to the wat and a l@xmath75 = \\{1.67 , 1.12}@xmath76  erg  s@xmath50 , respectively @xcite . for the optical data we again used the sdss photometric galaxy database and performed the same analysis as with the wat system ( @xmath14.2 ) .",
    "figure [ histo0809 ] shows the histograms and figure [ sdss0809 ] the distribution of galaxies with the same contour levels as the wat system .",
    "the x - ray clusters show much stronger clustering than the wat system , both spatially and in redshift . using the same richness analysis that we used for the wat group , rxcj2155.6 + 1231 and rxcj1327.0 + 0211",
    "have richnesses of 42 and 53 , respectively , consistent with large x - ray luminous clusters ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the lack of x - ray emission in the wat group , therefore , is consistent with its poor optical properties , and can not explain the discrepant radio / x - ray luminosity ratio seen in figure [ lrvslx ] .",
    "we now examine the radio luminosity , which is apparently two orders of magnitude too luminous given the observed correlation for radio relics .",
    "we proceed under the assumption that n@xmath16 is related to the presence of a shock , as we argued earlier , and attempt to understand the source of the relativistic electrons that are causing the synchrotron emission .",
    "the two likely possibilities are that the electrons were accelerated directly out of the thermal plasma by diffusive shock acceleration ( dsa ) , or the seed electrons came from fossil plasma from past agn activity and were re - accelerated and/or adiabatically enhanced by the shock .",
    "@xcite performed a cosmological simulation that included only dsa of cosmic rays from the thermal environment and did not include fossil agn plasma .",
    "they report a correlation between 1.4  ghz radio luminosity from primary electrons ( those accelerated at shocks ) and cluster temperature ( see figure 6 of that paper ) that is roughly consistent with the observed correlation for radio relics shown in figure [ lrvslx ] .",
    "the radio / x - ray luminosity ratio of n@xmath16 is therefore inconsistent with the results of @xcite .",
    "we can examine the conditions under which their simulations would have produce the observed p@xmath77/l@xmath48 ratio of n@xmath16 .",
    "using observed l@xmath48 vs. t@xmath78 relations @xcite and theoretical expectations for low - density environments @xcite , we assume a t@xmath78 @xmath60 1 kev .",
    "@xcite would then predict p@xmath77(1.4  ghz ) @xmath79  w  hz@xmath50 , assuming an acceleration efficiency of 10@xmath80 and an electron to proton injection ratio of r@xmath81=0.01 .",
    "therefore , either the acceleration efficiency needs to be @xmath82 or r@xmath831 in order for @xcite to reproduce the p@xmath77/l@xmath48 ratio of n@xmath16 .",
    "it is thus physically possible to use dsa out of the thermal gas to create n@xmath16 , but it is not clear why the efficiency or r@xmath81 should be so anomalous in this region .    the other possible source of seed electrons is fossil or  relic \" plasma from past agn activity , presumably from the nearby wat .",
    "there are two possible mechanisms for reviving old plasma",
    ". the shock can either adiabatically enhance the relativistic particles and magnetic fields of the relic plasma _ only _",
    "( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or the shock can reaccelerate the particles as well .    in the case of pure adiabatic compression ,",
    "let us compare the energy content of the current wat radio lobes and n@xmath16 .",
    "from the first data , the eastern lobe of the wat has a minimum energy magnetic field of b@xmath84 2.7  @xmath15 g and a total energy of e @xmath85  erg .",
    "n@xmath16 has b@xmath84 0.6  @xmath15 g and e @xmath86  erg .",
    "it appears that the energy contained in n@xmath16 can not be explained by adiabatically compressing an extinct radio lobe similar to the current lobes of the wat .",
    "this does not rule out this scenario however , since the current activity of the wat may not be indicative of past activity , and wats in general are known to have energies of the same order as n@xmath16 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the reacceleration of the fossil electrons can further increase the emissivity of the relic plasma @xcite , potentially by an order of magnitude , depending on the pre - shock spectral index and the shock compression ratio r. from the spectral index of n@xmath16 , @xmath87 , we can find the shock compression ratio r = @xmath88 = 3.4 @xcite and mach number m @xmath89 2.1 .",
    "the mach number is a reasonable one for this environment ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in short ,",
    "energetically it is not out of the question that the radio emission n@xmath16 was created by shock compressed fossil plasma from the wat , assuming that the wat s past activity was stronger than it is currently .    given that dsa of electrons from the thermal plasma reproduces the observed radio vs. x - ray luminosity correlation for radio relics , from which n@xmath16 is a clear outlier , we conclude that reacceleration and/or adiabatic compression of fossil plasma from the wat source is a more likely origin for the radio emission in n@xmath16 . due to the fact that current activity of the wat is not energetically comparable to n@xmath16 , we must invoke more powerful activity in the past in order to make the adiabatic compression / reacceleration hypothesis work .",
    "had we associated n@xmath16 with the z@xmath00.07 group of galaxies ( @xmath14.2 , figure [ knownclust ] ) , the p@xmath77/l@xmath48 ratio would still have been two orders of magnitude too large for the observed correlation for radio relics .",
    "our arguments would have proceeded the same way , except we would have needed to invoke past activity from an _ undetected _ agn to explain the discrepant radio luminosity .",
    "many of the same issues that we found with n@xmath16 arise when we consider possible origins for s@xmath16 .",
    "if we consider an agn origin , the morphology of s@xmath16 ( figure [ vlai ] ) is reminiscent of a wat source centered on the first radio source f7 .",
    "f7 , however , does not have an optical counterpart in sdss .",
    "if it is an unidentified wat , its redshift is likely to be z @xmath63 0.5 @xcite , making its total linear extent @xmath633  mpc .",
    "figure [ watpowersize ] shows a plot of 1.4  ghz radio power vs. linear extent for a sample of wat sources from @xcite . if s@xmath16 were indeed at a redshift of z @xmath63 0.5 , it would have a linear size that far exceeds typical wats in this sample .",
    "it is also possible that one of the z=0.04 galaxies that makes up the filament ( figure [ spec_z_0809 ] ) hosts an agn that created the extended emission , but none of the galaxies at this redshift ( with spectra in sdss ) show signs of agn activity .",
    "however , the agn could have been disrupted and disappeared leaving the lobe emission behind ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as long as this happens on a timescale less than the 1.4 ghz electron maximum lifetime of 10@xmath62  yr ( see discussion in @xmath15.1 ) .",
    "assuming s@xmath16 is at a redshift of z=0.04 , its total energy would be e  @xmath90 erg and the minimum energy magnetic field would be b@xmath91 g , not atypical for wat lobe emission ( see @xmath15.1 ) .",
    "s@xmath16 could be caused by icm or igm processes , similar to our claim for n@xmath16 . from figure [ rosat ]",
    "we can see that , like n@xmath16 , there is no cluster x - ray emission detected in either rosat or xmm .",
    "the apparent filament in which s@xmath16 is embedded offers an intriguing origin for the diffuse emission . unlike other diffuse radio sources that have claimed to be part of filamentary large - scale structure @xcite , s@xmath16 is not near _ any _ massive clusters . at 390  kpc long , s@xmath16 is smaller than the @xmath01.5  mpc emission in the coma - abell 1367 supercluster @xcite or the @xmath92  mpc radio regions found by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite detected radio emission coincident with a relatively isolated filament of galaxies ( in the region of the cluster zwcl2341.1 + 0000 ) , similar to s@xmath16 .",
    "unlike s@xmath16 , however , the filament was also detected in x - rays with a l@xmath48(0.1 - 2.4  kev)@xmath93  erg  s@xmath50 . though the linear extent of s@xmath16 is small compared to the overall size of the filament , it is in the densest region .",
    "the radio luminosity of s@xmath16 ( table 2 ) , assuming it is embedded in the z@xmath00.04 filament , is also several orders of magnitude above the radio vs. x - ray luminosity correlation for known relics ( figure [ lrvslx ] ) .",
    "therefore , if s@xmath16 is indeed caused by processes in the icm or igm , the lack of x - ray emission poses the same problem as it does for n@xmath16 .",
    "we do not have an active radio galaxy nearby , however , to offer an explanation for s@xmath16 s increased radio luminosity .",
    "a consequence of attributing n@xmath16 s abnormally high radio luminosity to the presence of relic radio plasma is that _ any _ relic that forms in the presence of preexisting magnetized plasma will show an increased luminosity .",
    "a signature of this scenario might be in the scatter of the currently observed relics , which could be correlated with the availability of relic plasma from current / past agn activity .",
    "however , the coma relic 1253 + 275 , which is a relic that is seemingly being fed magnetized plasma from the nat source ngc 4789 @xcite , is less radio luminous than other relics with similar x - ray luminosity ( figure [ lrvslx ] ) .",
    "this is contrary to our hypothesis that fossil agn plasma increases the radio luminosity of relic sources .",
    "there are , however , many factors that contribute to the presence and strength of synchrotron emission at a structure formation shock . @xcite found scatter of the same order as figure [ lrvslx ] for the 1.4  ghz emission of primary electrons in their simulations .",
    "this is after integrating the radio luminosity over a spherical volume with a radius of 1.3@xmath94  mpc , and without including relic plasma from past agn activity .",
    "since @xcite used a fixed radius for all the clusters , the radio luminosities they found depend on the details of the current dynamical state and the location of shocks within ( or just outside ) each cluster . in practice ,",
    "radio relics represent only a single ( perhaps partially ) illuminated shock front associated with a cluster .",
    "it is thus no surprise that there is such a large scatter in the observational correlation .",
    "what then makes these two sources , n@xmath16 and s@xmath16 , special",
    "? why have radio relics only been found around rich x - ray clusters up until now ?",
    "part of the observational problem is most certainly selection and bias effects .",
    "thus far most searches for relics have focused on rich x - ray emitting clusters , an exception being @xcite , from which 0809 + 39 was found .",
    "even @xcite found only a handful of new candidates , but this could be the tip of a larger distribution that is currently below the nvss and wenss surface - brightness limits . on the theoretical side , most simulations that include synthetic radio observations , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite , do not include pre - existing relativistic plasma from past / current agn .",
    "@xcite simulated the merger of two m  @xmath95 clusters of galaxies in order to track the revival of relic radio plasma .",
    "they found that efficient re - acceleration only occurred in regions where the ratio of magnetic pressure to gas pressure is p@xmath96/p@xmath97 @xmath60 0.01 , which explains why this process is inefficient in the inner regions of clusters where p@xmath98 p@xmath97 .",
    "one property that distinguishes n@xmath16 and s@xmath16 from other known relics is that they reside in poor environments .",
    "perhaps poor clusters and groups do not confine relativistic plasma as well , so that radio lobe plasma from agn can be driven farther ( and faster ) into the low density regions than they would in rich clusters ( we are speaking here about driven jets , not buoyant forces ) .",
    "for adiabatic compression to be most effective , one wants ",
    "younger \" electrons , higher compression factors ( steeper shocks in cooler gas ) , and lower magnetic fields ( i.e. , less radiative losses ; @xcite ) .",
    "the first two of these conditions can be effectively achieved in the above scenario .",
    "simulations focusing on the evolution of relic agn plasma in low - density environments are needed in order to fully assess the plausibility of this idea .",
    "we have presented detailed radio observations of the diffuse source 0809 + 39 in an attempt to discover the origin of the synchrotron emission . to summarize the key messages : + @xmath99 evidence points toward n@xmath16 being a radio relic , i.e. shock excited synchrotron emission , related to a poor z@xmath00.2 group of galaxies .",
    "+ @xmath99 s@xmath16 s origin is ambiguous , though its coincidence with a filament of galaxies at z@xmath00.04 makes it possible that it could be synchrotron emission from filamentary large - scale structure or relic emission from an extinct radio galaxy within the filament .",
