    "the @xmath1cdm currently favored paradigm of structure formation has proven to be a successful model to explain the evolution and large scale structure of the universe .",
    "it is on small scales , however , where the concordance cosmology faces most of its challenges .",
    "one example is the well - known mismatch in the number of observed satellites around systems like the milky way and those found in cosmological @xmath0-body simulations @xcite .",
    "although this can be solved by invoking baryonic effects , a new problem has been reported regarding the abundance of massive satellites ( the so - called  too big to fail problem  , * ? ? ?",
    "pure @xmath0-body simulations in @xmath1cdm also predict self - similar halos that have divergent central densities @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "however , models of the internal kinematics of milky way dsph have so far yielded inconclusive results regarding the inner slopes of the halos hosting these galaxies @xcite .",
    "the fundamental question that these studies have tried to address is whether a cusped dark matter density profile fits the observations better than a cored one .",
    "this is however , very difficult to answer with current data .",
    "for instance , @xcite using non - parametric orbit - based dynamical models showed that , although small values of the logarithmic inner slope of the dark matter density profile are preferred in the case of the sculptor dsph , the inner slope value is strongly degenerate with the scale radius and the uncertainties are large .",
    "a more feasible task is to measure the logarithmic slope at a finite radius , e.g. at @xmath3 , the radius where the logarithmic slope of the _ light _ profile is @xmath4 .",
    "* hereafter bh13 ) have determined the logarithmic slope robustly ( i.e. independently of the assumed profile , be it cored or cusped ) at @xmath3 , for the dsph fornax ( fnx ) and sculptor ( scl ) , and placed strong constraints on the values for sextans ( sxt ) and carina ( car ) .",
    "in addition , bh13 confirmed using schwarzschild modeling , that the mass at this radius can also be tightly constrained @xcite .",
    "this result shifts the discussion to a better posed question , namely : are the logarithmic slope and mass at @xmath3 inferred for these four dwarfs consistent with those found in simulations ?",
    "this phrasing has the additional advantage that measuring these two quantities in simulations of dwarf galaxies is less prone to numerical artifacts . in this letter",
    "we focus on answering this question using the aquarius simulations @xcite .",
    "since these simulations do not include baryons , discrepancies could possibly be attributed to missing physics .",
    "for instance , early adiabatic contraction could make the density distribution of the central parts steeper @xcite . on the other hand , feedback by supernovae ( sne ) may modify the dark matter profile and lead to a shallower inner slope , especially for low mass galaxies @xcite .",
    "finally , dynamical friction of large baryonic clumps has also been shown to modify the logarithmic slope in the same sense @xcite .",
    "this letter is structured as follows . in section [ sec : comparison ]",
    "we compare the observational results from bh13 to the subhalos from the aquarius simulations and highlight the discrepancies . in section [ sec :",
    "transform ] we use analytic arguments to estimate the minimum amount of energy needed to transform the subhalos profiles to a distribution more consistent with the observational constraints following the arguments laid out by @xcite , and derive the required sne feedback efficiencies . finally in section",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] we discuss the broader implications of our results .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     as we have just seen dark matter only simulations in the @xmath1cdm cosmology , predict steeper slopes of the dark matter profiles than those determined for the dsphs .",
    "the most commonly proposed mechanism to transform the shape of the dark matter profile is feedback from sne that affects the baryons and , through gravity , ultimately alters the dark matter mass distribution in these systems @xcite .    to establish whether a given aquarius subhalo can be reshaped into a halo that is compatible with a dsph",
    ", we first need to know how much energy is required to do the transformation .",
    "following @xcite we assume that each dwarf is in virial equilibrium , and we compute the energy needed to transform a subhalo @xmath5 to match the dsph model @xmath6 ( given by eq .   and eq .  ): @xmath7 .",
    "here @xmath8 is the potential energy of the subhalo and @xmath9 is the potential energy of the best fitting model for our dsph : @xmath10 with @xmath11 , i.e. we ignore the baryonic component which is sub - dominant for dsph .",
    "we choose two different values of @xmath12 , namely @xmath13 and @xmath14 , the radii enclosing 50% or 95% of the bound mass of each subhalo .",
    "the potential energy at @xmath14 is more negative than at @xmath13 , and thus the energy required to transform the system inside @xmath13 is smaller than that required for @xmath14 .",
    "( note that these values are larger than those used by @xcite , who took @xmath15 , with @xmath16 the radius where the dark halo profile s logarithmic slope is @xmath17 ) .",
    "we calculate @xmath8 directly using the particles from the dark matter simulations : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the dark matter particle mass , @xmath20 is the sorted radial distance of particle @xmath21 from the center of the subhalo such that @xmath22 is the innermost particle and @xmath23 that farthest away but still within @xmath12 .",
    "[ fig : energies ] shows for each dsph the ratio @xmath24 as a function of absolute magnitude @xmath25 as given by the semi - analytic model .",
    "the blue bands indicate a magnitude range of @xmath26 around the corresponding dsph .",
    "the solid circles are for the ` nfw ` ( red ) and ` core13 ` ( green ) best fit models computed for @xmath14 while the triangles are for @xmath13 .    when the ratio @xmath27 ( all symbols _ below _ the black horizontal line ) objects need energy to transform their halos .",
    "in these cases the binding energy of the resulting object is larger ( less negative ) than that of the original untransformed subhalo .",
    "when @xmath28 ( all symbols _ above _ the black horizontal line ) the binding energy of the resulting object is smaller and such objects would have to lose energy to be transformed into a profile that matches the observations .",
    "regardless of the mechanism , this transformation is energetically possible and we do not discuss it further .    as in @xcite , we estimate the total available energy from sne as @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "if the energy needed to transform a given halo is larger than what can be delivered from sne ( i.e. the sn efficiency is larger than 100% ) , we plot it in fig .  [ fig : energies ] with an open symbol .",
    "note that for fornax only a few open symbols exist .",
    "this means that almost all of the candidate subhalos could be reshaped into fornax given its stellar content and the energy available from sne .    for each dsph , we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : sn_eff ] the ratio of the energy required to transform the system to the sn energy output as estimated above , i.e. @xmath32 is the sn efficiency needed to do the transformation .",
    "we thus only plot the objects which lie below the horizontal lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : energies ] .",
    "this analysis reveals that for each dsph , subhalos with the right luminosities exist which can be reshaped to follow a dark matter profile consistent with the observations .",
    "the required efficiencies range from @xmath33 up to slightly more than 100% , depending somewhat on the extent of the region of the subhalo that would be transformed ( @xmath13 or @xmath14 ) .",
    "furthermore there is always at least one subhalo that requires a sn feedback efficiency @xmath34 .",
    "we have shown that in the two dimensional parameter space defined by the mass and the logarithmic slope of the dark matter density profile at @xmath3 , the milky way s dsph do not match the predictions from dark matter only simulations . while in @xcite we argued that by rescaling the milky way mass to a ( low ) value of @xmath35 we could circumvent the so called `` too big too fail problem '' , we now see that halos with the right mass , do not have the right logarithmic slope at @xmath3 . however , baryons can have a considerable effect on the shape of the dark matter density profile through feedback ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we have shown here that it is energetically possible at redshift of @xmath36 to reshape the simulated halos and make them compatible with the observations .",
    "note that this process would require even less energy at higher redshift , as discussed by @xcite .",
    "hydrodynamical ( cosmological ) simulations of ( isolated ) dwarf galaxies are now available in the literature ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and are more representative of galaxy formation scenarios in @xmath1cdm , since they self consistently include baryonic physics .",
    "@xcite , for instance , predicts the slope in a given radial range to be predominantly dependent of the ratio @xmath37 . in their simulations",
    "an object like fnx ( whose @xmath38 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , is embedded in dark matter halo of virial mass @xmath39 .",
    "such objects are reported to have dark halo profile s logarithmic slopes @xmath40 $ ] for the radial range @xmath41  kpc .",
    "this is inconsistent at a 2@xmath42 level with our measurement of the slope for fnx at @xmath43 kpc as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : m3slopes ] .",
    "such simulations therefore , predict slopes that are too shallow compared to the observationally determined values ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this suggests that the feedback scheme used might be too strong for objects of this mass scale .",
    "it is more difficult to make a detailed and conclusive comparison the other dsph because the simulations suites available in the literature do not contain such faint objects or the ranges in which the slopes are measured are typically larger than the observed @xmath3",
    ".    the steep slopes ( corresponding to high concentration ) of low mass dark halos could be another manifestation of the `` too big to fail '' problem ( however see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although the two issues are not necessarily strictly related , since other solutions to this problem exist @xcite .",
    "for example , @xcite argue that efficient feedback solves it , but the preliminary comparisons made above show that a careful treatment is required .",
    "we hope that our measurements of the logarithmic slopes and masses of dsph can be used to better constrain poorly understood processes such as the interplay between adiabatic contraction and supernova feedback in these small mass systems . + ah and mb are grateful to nova for financial support .",

    "the aquarius simulations have been run by the virgo consortium , and we are very grateful to this collaboration , and particularly indebted to volker springel .",
    "we are especially thankful to else starkenburg for the outputs of the semi - analytic code used in this letter , and also to gabriella de lucia and yang - shyang li for the contributions to its development ."
