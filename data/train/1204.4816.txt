    "lwa1 ( `` long wavelength array station 1 '' ; figure  [ flwa1 ] ) is a new radio telescope operating in the frequency range 1088 mhz , collocated with the very large array ( vla ; @xmath1  w , @xmath2  n ) in central new mexico .",
    "the telescope consists of an array of 258 pairs of dipole - type antennas whose outputs are individually digitized and formed into beams .",
    "the principal technical characteristics of lwa1 are summarized in table  [ tspecs ] .",
    "lwa1 is so - named because it is envisioned to be the first `` station '' of a 53-station long - baseline aperture synthesis imaging array known as the long wavelength array ( lwa ) , described in @xcite .",
    "although the future of the lwa is uncertain , lwa1 was completed in fall 2011 @xcite and is currently operating under the u.s",
    ".  national science foundation s `` university radio observatories '' program .",
    ".[tspecs]lwa1 technical characteristics .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     right ascension ( ra ) and declination ( dec ) are given for the j2000 epoch .",
    "+ azimuth ( az ) and zenith angle ( @xmath3 ) are indicated for the midpoint of the observation .",
    "+ the flux densities are the 73.8  mhz values given in lwa memo 155 @xcite , scaled to 74.03  mhz using spectral indices of @xmath4 and @xmath5 for cyg  a and cas  a respectively , and cas  a is further scaled by @xmath6%/yr @xcite .",
    "this procedure is repeated for every antenna in the array , yielding a set of complex - valued coefficients associated with one direction at one frequency .",
    "one then iterates over frequency .",
    "there is currently no iteration over direction ; that is , only one direction is considered .",
    "different directions give different coefficients , for two reasons : first , because the geometrical delays are different ; however these are easily equalized .",
    "the second reason is because the antenna patterns are made unequal by the effects of mutual coupling .",
    "the effects of mutual coupling on the antenna patterns is difficult to know precisely .",
    "however since our goal is to compute ( broadband ) delays , as opposed to ( narrowband ) phases and magnitudes , calibration in a single direction is sufficient , as will be demonstrated in the next section .",
    "the entire procedure requires on the order of a week , typically observing over the same one - hour lst range at a different frequency each day .",
    "figures  [ fcyga_drift ] and [ fcyga_drift_lf ] show a single transit drift scan of cyg  a ; i.e. , the output of a fixed beam pointed at the location in the sky at which cyg  a achieves upper culmination : @xmath7 , @xmath8 north azimuth .",
    "cyg  a is useful as a test source both because it is the strongest time - invariant and unresolved astronomical source visible from the lwa1 site , and also because it transits close to the zenith .",
    "the origin in both plots corresponds to the time at which cyg  a is expected to peak ; figure  [ fpasi1 ] shows the sky at this time .",
    "the results for a narrow bandwidth at 8 distinct center frequencies ranging from 20.5 through 85.6  mhz are shown .",
    "the large peak in each curve is cyg  a ; the small peak to the right in some curves is the galactic plane passing through the beam a short time later ( apparent only at higher frequencies and unresolved in lower - frequency curves ) .",
    "note that cyg  a is clearly detectable at all frequencies , demonstrating the very wide instantaneous bandwidth of the instrument . also apparent",
    "is the broadening of the beamwidth with decreasing frequency , as expected .",
    "the lowest two frequencies ( 28.80 and 20.50  mhz ) are shown in a separate figure for clarity ; both frequencies are apparently strongly affected by ionospheric scintillation , and 20.05  mhz is strongly affected by rfi .",
    "the drift scans for each frequency in figure  [ fcyga_drift ] and [ fcyga_drift_lf ] are normalized to the same peak value to facilitate comparison of beam width . using the method described in appendix  [ sbeamwidth ] , we find full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) beamwidths of @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 for 85.00 , 74.03 , 62.90 , 52.00 , 37.90 , 28.80 , and 20.50  mhz respectively .",
    "note that these measurements are in planes of constant declination ; i.e. , not planes of constant azimuth nor constant elevation .",
    "the expected zenith fwhm of a uniformly - illuminated circular aperture having the same minimum dimensions as lwa1 is @xmath16 at 74  mhz ; thus the measurements are roughly 2060% larger than predicted by the above model .",
    "this is due in part to the proximity of cyg  a to the galactic plane , and the resulting `` confusion '' of the cyg a emission with diffuse galactic emission filling the beam .",
    "this is evident by comparison with the same measurement performed using the source 3c123 , which lies further from the galactic plane but transits at a similar zenith angle ( @xmath17 ) . for 3c123",
    "we obtain fwhm = @xmath18 at 74.03  mhz , which is quite close to the expected value . due to this limitation in the measurement technique",
    ", the fwhm values reported here should be considered upper bounds as opposed to estimates of the actual values .",
    "we now consider beam sensitivity . because lwa1 is strongly galactic noise - limited",
    ", beam directivity is not a reliable metric of sensitivity .",
    "instead , we consider sensitivity in terms of system equivalent flux density ( sefd ) , which is defined as the strength of an unresolved ( point ) source that doubles the power at the output of the beam relative to the value in the absence of the source . because the flux density of cyg  a is known ( table  [ t1 ] ) , beam sefd can be determined directly from drift scans using the method described in appendix  [ ssefd ] .",
    "this method yields sefd @xmath19  kjy for 74.03  mhz . to obtain the source flux",
    "@xmath20 at some other frequency @xmath21 , we apply the known spectral index @xmath4 for cyg  a @xcite : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a frequency at which the flux is already known . from this",
    "we estimate sefd = 11.0 , 21.5 , 28.8 , 21.5 , 18.2 , and 47.0  kjy for 85.00 , 62.90 , 52.00 , 37.90 , 28.80 , and 20.50  mhz respectively . due to the variables described in section  [ sbackground ] it is difficult to know even within 10 s of percent what values to expect ;",
    "however it is shown in the next section that these results are consistent with the results of simulations in previous work .",
    "it should also be emphasized that the flux density of radio sources ( including cyg a and sources discussed in the next section ) is known only approximately below 74 mhz , and that use of the 74 mhz flux density and spectral index to calculate flux density at lower frequencies is another source of error .",
    "the same procedures described in the previous section have been used to determine sensitivity at lower elevations using cyg  a and the strong sources tau  a , vir  a , 3c123 , and 3c348 .",
    "the results are summarized in figure  [ fsefd ] .",
    "also shown in this figure are predictions originally shown in fig .",
    "8 of @xcite .",
    "note that sefd depends both on pointing with respect to celestial coordinates as well as sidereal time ( for the reasons explained in section  [ sbackground ] ) ; whereas the predictions of @xcite assume a uniformly bright sky .",
    "thus , precise agreement can not be expected .",
    "nevertheless , the levels and trends with @xmath3 and frequency appear to be consistent with the predictions .",
    "we do note however that the agreement for 38  mhz appears to be somewhat worse than the agreement at other frequencies .",
    "we do not currently have an explanation for this .",
    "figure  [ ffwhm ] shows a summary of fwhm measurements from drift scans .",
    "beamwidth is difficult to measure at large @xmath3 because the drift scan peaks become simultaneously broad and weak ; thus the data shown is limited to @xmath24 .",
    "note that cyg  a measurements generally indicate fwhm higher than expected , whereas measurements using other sources are closer to expectations ; again this is due in some part to the inability of the method of appendix  [ sbeamwidth ] to account for the excess emission associated with the nearby galactic plane .",
    "also shown in figure  [ ffwhm ] is an empirical upper bound based on all measurements ( regardless of @xmath3 ) considered to date : @xmath25 we intend to improve on this bound in future measurements by using interferometric methods , as discussed in section  [ sconc ] .",
    "this paper described the design of the lwa1 radio telescope , array calibration technique , and the results of commissioning experiments to confirm beamforming performance .",
    "the `` single point '' delay calibration technique currently in use at lwa1 was described in section  [ scal ] . in this technique , the delays are estimated from phase estimates over a range of frequencies using narrowband `` all - dipoles '' ( tbn ) observations of the sky . this technique uses a fringe rate filtering technique which is robust to the presence of multiple bright sources including both unresolved and spatially - extended sources .",
    "real time delay - and - sum beamforming was demonstrated in section  [ sbeam ] .",
    "sensitivity findings are summarized in figure  [ fsefd ] , and were shown to be consistent with predictions made in @xcite .",
    "beamwidth findings are summarized in figure  [ ffwhm ] . due to the limitations of the drift scan measurement technique employed in this paper ,",
    "we can currently only upper - bound our estimates of beamwidth . in future measurements we intend to cross - correlate",
    "drift scan beams with outrigger dipoles , which is expected to suppress the contribution of diffuse galactic emission and result in more accurate measurement of beamwidth .",
    "the same technique will enable characterization of sidelobes , which is not possible with the drift scan technique .",
    "we also plan to conduct measurements to characterize polarization performance .",
    "the results presented here combined with early science results described in @xcite confirm that lwa1 performance is consistent with expectations and that the instrument is ready for science operations .",
    "the peak - to - baseline ratios achieved in drift scans such as those shown in figures  [ fcyga_drift ] and [ fcyga_drift_lf ] are too low to facilitate calculation of beam fwhm by direct inspection .",
    "however it is possible to estimate fwhm by modeling the drift scan as the sum of a gaussian function representing the power pattern of the main lobe plus a constant noise floor , solving for the coefficient of time in the exponent of the gaussian function , and then calculating the associated width of the gaussian function alone . in this appendix",
    "we first derive the result , and then we justify the use of the gaussian approximation .    the drift scan is modeled as : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the magnitude of the constant noise baseline , @xmath28 is the peak magnitude of the gaussian function modeling the main lobe , and @xmath29 is time . evaluating this expression at the time @xmath30 , taken to be the time at which the peak occurs , and time @xmath31 , a short time later , we have : @xmath32 @xmath33 solving for @xmath34 : @xmath35 fwhm corresponds to the time interval between the half - maximum points of the gaussian function , which is easily found to be @xmath36    we now show that the gaussian model is a reasonable approximation to the exact result for the zenith - pointed beam due to a uniformly - weighted circular aperture .",
    "note the lwa1 aperture is not exactly circular , nor is it exactly uniformly - weighted ( due to variations in antenna responses due to mutual coupling ) ; our purpose here is simply to demonstrate that the gaussian model reasonably represents the kind of beam that we expect to see from this type of antenna system .",
    "the normalized ( i.e. , maximum magnitude @xmath37 ) pattern function of a uniformly - weighted circular aperture lying in the plane of the ground is @xcite : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the radius of the aperture , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 is wavelength . thus the normalized power pattern is @xmath42 .",
    "let us assume that the main lobe of @xmath42 can be modeled as a gaussian function @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the angular rate of drift",
    ". for purposes of demonstration let us assume @xmath45 ( 100  m diameter at 74  mhz ) .",
    "we take @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and then use equation  [ epp ] to find @xmath49 .",
    "figure  [ fml ] compares @xmath42 to the derived model @xmath43 with @xmath34 obtained from equation  [ egaa ] .",
    "note that the model error at the half - maximum point is very small , justifying the use of the gaussian model for this purpose .",
    "finally , we note that the model has not been demonstrated to be appropriate for beam pointings far from the zenith .",
    "however , we note that we do not have a `` true '' model available for this case either , since the patterns of individual antennas combined with mutual coupling make this difficult to know",
    ". this caveat should be considered when evaluating results computed for low - elevation pointings .",
    "when the flux density of the source is known , beam system equivalent flux density ( sefd ) can be estimated from drift scans such as those shown in figures  [ fcyga_drift ] and [ fcyga_drift_lf ] .",
    "a derivation follows .",
    "the power density @xmath50 captured in one polarization of the beam associated with an unpolarized source having flux density @xmath20 is given by @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the effective aperture .",
    "similarly , the power density @xmath53 captured in one polarization of the beam associated with the total available noise is given by @xmath54 where @xmath55 is boltzmann s constant and @xmath56 is the system noise temperature , assuming this to be external noise - dominated .",
    "thus the signal - to - noise ratio at the beam output is @xmath57 in these terms , the sefd for this polarization is defined as the value of @xmath20 which results in @xmath58 ; thus : @xmath59 let @xmath60 be the power density measured at the peak of the drift scan , and let @xmath61 be the power density in the absence of the source . note @xmath62 can be estimated from the approximately - constant noise baseline on either side of the peak . using the above definitions ,",
    "we find @xmath63 solving for sefd : @xmath64 thus , given the source flux density , the sefd can be obtained from @xmath65 and @xmath62 , which themselves can be read from a single - polarization drift scan .",
