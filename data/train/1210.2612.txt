    "bilayer vesicles serve as capsules for delivery of various molecules as part of the biological cell function @xcite and in pharmaceutical and cosmetic applications.@xcite this utility relies on the potential barrier posed by the hydrophobic core of the bilayer for the penetration of water - soluble molecules .",
    "the sensitivity of molecular transport to the barrier height makes the membrane - permeability coefficients of different solutes span many orders of magnitude  from values of order @xmath0 @xmath1 m/s for water down to a mere @xmath2 @xmath1 m/s for potassium ions , for example.@xcite thus , the membrane of a vesicle of micron size or smaller , over time scales longer than about @xmath3 s , behaves as a semi - permeable partition , allowing solvent to be exchanged between the interior and exterior while keeping certain solute molecules either enclosed inside or locked outside .",
    "this , in turn , allows for the buildup of an osmotic pressure difference across the membrane .",
    "we open with a very basic question : what are the thermodynamic constraints imposed in practice on such a vesicular capsule ?",
    "the surrounding solution dictates the temperature @xmath4 , external pressure @xmath5 , and chemical potential @xmath6 of the solvent ( water ) . over the time",
    "scales under consideration the numbers @xmath7 of the encapsulated solute molecules are fixed as well . on the other hand ,",
    "since solvent is exchanged across the membrane , the values of neither the encapsulated volume @xmath8 nor the inner pressure @xmath9 are _ a priori _ set . in addition , there are surface constraints associated with the membrane , such as the number @xmath10 of amphiphilic molecules making the bilayer ( or , alternatively , their chemical potential @xmath11 ) .",
    "these two - dimensional variables raise various subtle issues,@xcite which nonetheless do not concern us here ; we simply represent them all by a single symbol , @xmath12 .",
    "the set of thermodynamic constraints imposed on the capsule , therefore , is @xmath13 .",
    "theoretically , vesicles have been studied over the years under different sets of constraints , such as @xmath14 @xcite or @xmath15.@xcite the former will hold in practice when the solvent does not have sufficient time to be exchanged across the membrane , _",
    "i.e. _ , over sufficiently short time scales ( shorter than @xmath16 s ) .",
    "the latter corresponds , for example , to micropipette aspiration experiments,@xcite where the hydrostatic pressure difference across the membrane is controlled .",
    "the key point that we wish to highlight here is that the behaviors of vesicles under these different sets of thermodynamic constraints are not necessarily equivalent .",
    "this has been demonstrated in a series of recent studies.@xcite we are used to the fact that the distinction between different sets of thermodynamic constraints ( equivalently , different statistical ensembles ) is not important for large systems at equilibrium .",
    "why should it matter much whether a certain pressure difference is externally imposed by a pump or self - attained as an average equilibrium value due to osmosis ?",
    "this broadly valid statement assumes , however , that surface effects and fluctuations are negligible . for",
    "fluid vesicles , which often strongly fluctuate and may introduce strong surface effects , the validity of this assumption is not self - evident . it should be stressed that the distinction between sets of constraints is not merely a theoretical curiosity .",
    "the explicit treatment of the encapsulated solution has in certain cases important and useful implications .",
    "we choose to postpone the discussion of these to the end of this highlight piece and discuss first two much more artificial cases , which nevertheless serve well to demonstrate the point .",
    "arguably the simplest model for a fluctuating closed envelope is a two - dimensional ( 2d ) ring made of a fixed number @xmath10 of freely - jointed segments at temperature @xmath4 .",
    "( such systems are actually realizable experimentally.@xcite ) when we control and increase the 2d pressure difference @xmath17 between the inner and outer regions , the mean volume enclosed by the envelope ( _ i.e. _ , the area of the ring ) increases . for self - intersecting rings",
    "this swelling encounters a criticality  at a critical pressure , @xmath18 , the mean volume either diverges ( if the segments are taken to be extensible harmonic springs ) @xcite or exhibits a second - order transition between crumpled and smooth states ( if the segments are made inextensible).@xcite however , when we let the ring swell due to an increasing number @xmath19 of enclosed particles rather than impose a pressure difference , the criticality disappears and the mean volume increases gradually with @xmath19.@xcite    a similar clear - cut example of a qualitatively different behavior of particle - encapsulating envelopes is found in a discrete model of three - dimensional ( 3d ) fluid vesicles . in this model , due to gompper and kroll,@xcite the vesicle",
    "is represented by a closed triangulated network of @xmath10 self - avoiding nodes whose connectivity is random and variable .",
    "when the pressure difference @xmath17 is controlled and increased , the vesicle undergoes a first - order transition at a certain critical pressure , @xmath20 , between crumpled and smooth states .",
    "however , if the vesicle is inflated instead by an increasing number @xmath19 of enclosed particles , the discontinuous transition disappears and is replaced by gradual swelling with @xmath19.@xcite    the way in which the criticality is removed in these two examples is quite unusual .",
    "when we control @xmath19 , neither @xmath17 nor @xmath8 is fixed .",
    "the large flexibility of those two model capsules allows them to adjust their mean volume such that the mean pressure difference , determined by the mean particle concentration @xmath21 and @xmath4 , never hits @xmath22 for any value of @xmath19 , thus avoiding the transition .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_dp ] . upon decreasing the number of enclosed particles the pressure inside the 3d vesicle",
    "first decreases but eventually stops changing with @xmath19 and never reaches arbitrarily low values .",
    "thus , the two sets of constraints , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , are manifestly not equivalent in these examples  there are macrostates in the former that become inaccessible in the latter .",
    "( for a unified description of the swelling of random manifolds by either imposed pressure or enclosed particles , and the related issue of equivalence , see ref  . )",
    "the two examples given in the preceding section pertain to random envelopes whose size is much larger than their bending persistence length.@xcite actual bilayer vesicles belong to the opposite smooth limit , where the bending persistence length is larger than the vesicle .",
    "when real vesicles swell , they first undergo an `` ironing '' stage , where their volume - to - area ratio increases as they become increasingly more spherical .",
    "this is followed by a stretching stage , in which the membrane area @xmath25 increases while the shape remains essentially spherical .",
    "when the surface strain exceeds a few percent , the membrane ruptures.@xcite in the case of osmotic swelling , the rupture ( osmotic lysis ) may be followed by a sequence of additional swelling ",
    "rupture cycles.@xcite    we focus here on the crossover between the ironing and stretching stages .",
    "we define an order parameter , @xmath26 which measures how far the vesicle is from a sphere .",
    "way before the crossover , when the vesicle is not swollen , @xmath27 is appreciable , whereas well into the stretching stage , when the vesicle is nearly spherical , @xmath27 approaches zero .",
    "it was found out that , in the case of osmotic swelling , this crossover can be represented as a rounded continuous phase transition.@xcite specifically , if a control parameter @xmath28 , dependent on the number of encapsulated particles , is defined as @xmath29 @xmath30 being the relaxed area of the vesicle , one finds the following critical scaling in the vicinity of the transition and beyond it : @xmath31 in eqn ( [ scaling ] ) @xmath32 is the width of the transition , and @xmath33 is a scaling function .",
    "( the expressions given above for @xmath34 and @xmath35 assume that the solution inside the vesicle is ideal ; yet , the results can be generalized to an arbitrary equation of state for the encapsulated solution.@xcite )    in the limit @xmath36 the swelling curve @xmath37 has a singular corner at the point @xmath38 . if membrane stretching is neglected ( the area being fixed at @xmath39 ) ,",
    "then @xmath40_i.e . _",
    ", the rounding of the transition arises , as in any phase transition , from the finite size of the system.@xcite in this approximation there is no stretching stage , and the vesicle approaches its maximum volume @xmath41 , the volume of a sphere of area @xmath30 .",
    "when a finite stretching modulus @xmath42 is included , the rounding of the transition arises from both finite size and finite stretchability ( with @xmath43 if the latter dominates @xcite ) .",
    "the critical properties of the crossover disappear when the swelling is hydrostatic rather than osmotic , _",
    "i.e. _ , when the pressure difference is constrained instead of the number of enclosed solute molecules .",
    "unlike the examples in the preceding section , in this case the same macrostates are encountered when sweeping through the values of either @xmath44 or @xmath19 ; it is the sharpness of the corresponding changes in the order parameter that differs between the two sets of constraints .",
    "when the vesicle swells by osmosis , _ both _ the mean volume and mean pressure behave critically as a function of @xmath19 , and we find @xmath45;@xcite the sharp approach to a spherical shape is accompanied by a similarly sharp increase in pressure difference and surface tension . consequently , once transformed into pressure dependence , the order parameter decreases slowly with increasing pressure , @xmath46 .",
    "the critical scaling has had two beneficial implications .",
    "one is theoretical  eqn ( [ scaling ] ) constitutes a law of corresponding states for the osmotic swelling of vesicles.@xcite it implies that the osmotic swelling curves of various vesicles under various conditions ( _ e.g. _ , due to the permeation of various solutes at various concentrations ) can be collapsed in the vicinity of the transition ( and above it ) onto a single master curve , thus achieving a simple , unified theoretical description .",
    "osmotic swelling has been experimentally studied in detail using dynamic light scattering @xcite or optical tracking,@xcite depending on vesicle size . in a typical procedure vesicles",
    "are formed in a solution of a non - permeating solute , in which they are free of osmotic stress .",
    "subsequently , the exterior is replaced by a solution of equal concentration but containing a permeating solute . as the outer solute permeates inward , the vesicles swell through osmosis .",
    "changes in the shape and size of the vesicle as it progresses from a stress - free state toward a strongly stretched sphere and the ultimate lysis are related to the corresponding decrease in the order parameter @xmath27 , eqn ( [ orderparameter ] ) .",
    "the control parameter @xmath28 , eqn ( [ controlparameter ] ) , is linearly related to the time axis via the membrane permeability coefficient , @xmath47 , of the permeating solute .",
    "thus , high - resolution optical tracking can be used to obtain swelling curves , @xmath37 , and the associated data collapse.@xcite this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_collapse ] .",
    "the other beneficial implication of the critical scaling has been the introduction of a new method to measure membrane - permeability coefficients of various solutes.@xcite data collapse such as the one shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_collapse ] involves two fitting parameters : the transition width @xmath32 , separately fitted for each curve , and the permeability coefficient @xmath47 , globally fitted for all curves and corresponding to a mere scaling of the horizontal ( time ) axis .",
    "this yields a sensitive and reliable measurement of @xmath47 .",
    "for example , from the data shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_collapse ] one finds for the permeation of urea through a popc membrane @xmath48 @xmath1 m/s .",
    "a similar procedure has yielded a significant concentration dependence of @xmath47 for polyols ( glycerol and ethylene glycol ) , which was not recognized before.@xcite",
    "the examples given above demonstrate how useful vesicular capsules may be for investigating fundamental issues of the thermodynamics of small systems , such as strong surface effects , fluctuations , and ensemble equivalence .",
    "the different behavior of osmotically stressed vesicles , as highlighted here , makes it necessary in certain cases to explicitly consider the properties of the encapsulated solution rather than just specify its mean volume or pressure . at the same time",
    "the different behavior allows access to features of the osmotic swelling process that would otherwise be difficult to extract , such as the membrane - permeability coefficients .",
    "one may be able to utilize it further and come up with more detailed predictions  for example , regarding the average time between the onset of osmotic stress and membrane lysis , which may be important for drug delivery and release .",
    "we are grateful to primo peterlin for a fruitful collaboration that led to several of the insights presented here .",
