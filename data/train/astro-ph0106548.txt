    "a spatial scan in the wavelength range between 2275   and 3120   was obtained on 1998 january  9 , april  1 , and september  24 , and on 1999 march  28 .",
    "the chromospheric disk was observed with an aperture size of 25 mas by 100  mas , by stepping in the cross - dispersion direction with the medium - resolution grating .",
    "this provided seven spatially resolved echelle spectra ( @xmath6@xmath230,000 ) in off - sets of 25 mas across the disk , over a single scan axis almost parallel ( within @xmath8 ) with the east - west direction .",
    "the scan axis of 1998 january was tilted by @xmath9@xmath10 from e - w .",
    "note that the stepping direction for the scan of 1998 september is reversed due to the @xmath11 roll in the seasonal orientation of the hst .",
    "the designation of target position ( tp ) from intensity peakup for this scan is therefore spatially reversed for comparison with the other scans .",
    "an overview of the scan axes with respect to the north direction in the plane of the sky is given in sect .",
    "the nuv - mama echelle line spread function and the absolute wavelength calibration for these spectra provide an accuracy within 1 pixel or 5  @xmath3 .",
    "the signal to noise ratios ( s / n ) of the individual spectra vary across the disk because different ( single ) exposure times were applied .",
    "these ratios typically range from 40 at intensity peakup to 25 near the disk edge .",
    "the data of 1998 april were complemented by an additional scan with the high - resolution grating ( @xmath6=114,000 ) in the wavelength range of 2666   to 2942   .",
    "these observations required a bigger slit size of 63 mas by 200 mas , and the aperture center was placed in pointing offsets of 63  mas and 126  mas ( left and right of intensity peakup ) .",
    "the wavelength calibration accuracy within one pixel corresponds to 1.3  @xmath3 .",
    "numerous prominent emission lines from neutral and singly - ionized metals have been identified in the far- and near - uv spectrum .",
    "@xcite identified many blended fe  ii and s  i lines between 1200   and 2000   .",
    "these fe  ii lines also dominate the spectrum from 2200   to 2800   @xcite , resulting from the complex term structure of fe  ii , which produces many blends between these lines , and with those of other elements .",
    "these profiles appear ` double - peaked ' because a central absorption core forms when the transitions become sufficiently optically thick in the chromospheric line formation region .",
    "for instance , fe  ii lines of several subordinate uv - multiplets ( i.e. uv 60@xmath964 ) with large oscillator strength , display strongly intensity saturated self - reversals with central depressions below the intensity level of the line wings and the background continuum . on the other hand ,",
    "the lines with lowest log(@xmath12)-values in these multiplets show single - peaked emission profiles in which self - absorption is hardly discernible with high spectral resolution and s / n [ i.e. @xmath12874.8 ( uv  61 ) , @xmath12716.7 ( uv  62 ) , @xmath12772.7 ( uv  63 ) ] .",
    "central self - reversals form when the line source function is not monotonically decreasing with distance from the base of the chromosphere , provided that the column density for the transition is sufficiently high ( due to line opacity resulting from the chromospheric extension and thermodynamic conditions ) .",
    "this scattering core of optically thick emission lines removes photons , produced in the deeper chromosphere , from the line of sight in the upper layers where the source function decreases .",
    "the frequency dependent contribution functions to the relative emission intensity in the line profile are therefore strongly depth dependent and determined by the detailed velocity structure in the line formation region .",
    "these complex profiles can be computed with radiative transfer through a well - constrained thermodynamic model of @xmath0  ori s extended chromosphere . a mean photospheric / chromospheric model of radial kinetic gas temperature , electron density , and microturbulence has been presented by @xcite , based on an elaborate fit procedure to the disk - integrated h@xmath0 profile , the ca  ii k line , and the relative intensities and widths of the mg  ii uv resonance doublet .",
    "this model reproduces the remarkable asymmetry observed for the latter lines .",
    "the intensity of the blue @xmath13 emission component is partly reduced by a deep and narrow scattering core of the mn  i blend at 2794.8   .",
    "the frequency dependent contribution functions show how the line wings form below the central scattering core ( see their fig .",
    "the relative contribution to the core flux increases in higher chromospheric layers with respect to the wings , which form deeper and closer to the chromospheric temperature rise .",
    "the emergent emission line profile is therefore dependent on the velocity structure in the formation region of this scattering core .",
    "photons moving toward the observer in a collapsing chromosphere encounter a larger opacity at the long - wavelength side of the line than the short - wavelength , and hence the blue wing appears stronger and the red wing fainter @xcite . a simple ( parameterized )",
    "modeling of such asymmetric emission profiles of @xmath0  ori was carried out by @xcite , based on fe  ii lines with stronger blue components , observed around 3200   in 1970@xmath975 .",
    "the component maxima of these double - peaked metal emission lines are observed to reverse over time .",
    "@xcite observed reversals in fe  ii @xmath12391.5 ( uv  35 ) , suggesting chromospheric inflow for 1988 march and outflow in 1989 january .",
    "inflow was again observed in 1991 january ( iue ) , whereas both components had equal intensity in 1992 september ( ghrs ) .",
    "the latter spectrum was analyzed by @xcite who inferred a correlation between the radial velocity of fe  ii central reversals and computed line opacities .",
    "they detected an acceleration of the mean chromospheric velocity structure from rest to @xmath2@xmath97  @xmath3 .",
    "the present stis monitoring also reveals how these cores displace over time ( by 4 to 8 @xmath3 ) , which correlates with the strengthening of the red emission component when this core displaced bluewards between 1998 april and 1999 march ( see fig . 7 of * ? ? ?",
    "these observations point to recurrent upflows in the stellar chromosphere which may be linked with the 400@xmath9420 day variability period found by @xcite from @xmath14-band photometry and mg  ii fluxes , and by @xcite from photospheric radial velocity variations .",
    "a short review of chromospheric variability based on earlier spectral data is also given in @xcite .",
    "figure 1 shows the stis raster scans obtained with the medium - resolution grating for our monitoring program .",
    "the profile changes observed in fe  ii @xmath12868.874 ( uv  61 ) ( _ dash - dotted lines _ ) , si  i @xmath12516.12 ( uv  1 ) ( _ solid lines _ ) , and fe  ii @xmath12402.6 ( uv  36 ) ( _ dotted lines _ ) are shown in off - sets of 25 mas from intensity peakup ( tp 0.0 ) on the chromospheric disk .",
    "note that the fe  ii @xmath12868.9 line intensity has been scaled up by a factor of 3 for comparison with the si  i profiles .",
    "these lines are investigated because their self - absorption cores are not intensity saturated .",
    "intensity saturation is observed in @xmath0  ori for the stronger lines of these uv multiplets .",
    "it distorts the wing profiles of the reversals , thereby masking small changes in the doppler position of this core .",
    "this is for instance observed in the wings of the wide and zero - flux self - absorption cores of mg  ii @xmath15 & @xmath13 , which remain static between 1998 january and 1999 march .    in general , the scans of 1998 in fig",
    ".  1 display stronger blue than red emission components , indicating downflow across the entire chromosphere .",
    "a closer inspection reveals that the component intensities are however not identical when scanning left and right of peakup position .",
    "for instance , in 1998 april the blue component exceeded the red much more at negative scan positions than for positive off - sets .",
    "the component ratio for both lines is noticeably larger at tp @xmath16 than at @xmath17 .",
    "this difference results from the minimum in the fe  ii self - reversal at tp @xmath17 , which occurs @xmath25  @xmath3 blue - shifted with respect to tp @xmath16 . but the fwhm for the central core at tp @xmath17 is also larger , which lowers the resulting intensity of its adjacent emission maxima .",
    "although a similar asymmetry of component ratios is observed for the si  i line , clear differences in core position and width remain undetectable , which results from the deeper central core of this resonance line , which dips about 10  @xmath3 bluewards of the fe  ii centroid .    when scanning further off the disk in 1998 april we observe how the self - reversal of the fe  ii @xmath12868 line becomes very weak at tp @xmath18 .",
    "a single - peaked emission profile appears , whereas the profile at tp @xmath19 remains double - peaked . to test the influence of instrumental broadening we compare the profiles with the high - resolution scan .",
    "this raster scan was obtained immediately after the medium - resolution scan , but with a 63  mas by 200  mas aperture .",
    "the high - dispersion profiles of fe  ii @xmath12868 are shown in fig .  1 by the dashed drawn ( noisily ) lines .",
    "they correspond with the aperture placed off - limb at 0  mas ( intensity peakup ) , @xmath20  mas , and @xmath21  mas . for comparison purposes we overplot these profiles at tps @xmath22 and @xmath23 , but recall that they sample a larger disk area and a wider spatial range .",
    "the absolute intensities are also scaled down for an effective comparison with the medium - resolution profiles .",
    "the component ratios in the high - resolution scan closely match ( to within a few percent ) the ratios of the medium - resolution scan .",
    "notice also the component asymmetry at @xmath20  mas , and the same shape difference of a single emission line at @xmath24  mas ( shown at tp @xmath18 ) , but which is double - peaked at @xmath25  mas ( tp @xmath19 ) .",
    "this comparison reveals that the component ratios in the medium - resolution scans can be used to infer reliably the spatial structure of the chromospheric velocity field , because these emission lines are intrinsically sufficiently broad .",
    "the separation of both components exceeds 40  @xmath3 ( or at least 4 times @xmath26@xmath1@xmath270.09   ) , so that the difference between @xmath6@xmath230,000 and @xmath6=114,000 has no appreciable effect on the observed line shapes .",
    "the medium - resolution scan of 1998 september in fig .",
    "1 reveals that the asymmetry of component ratios at opposite sides of the chromospheric disk increases further .",
    "the blue component of the si  i line ( _ solid lines _ ) at tp @xmath17 diminishes to below the intensity of its red emission component .",
    "this reversal is observed for both the si  i and fe  ii lines , and extends farther out to tp @xmath19 .",
    "it suggests a reversal of the mean flow direction in the formation region of the self - absorption core , causing slight doppler shifts of this core which strongly alter the emission maxima . in the next section we model these spatial reversals with small differences in the mean chromospheric velocity structure of the exposed disk area",
    "this expanding trend , first detected at positive scan positions ( west of peakup ) , is further observed in the raster scan of 1999 march .",
    "for this epoch the intensity maximum of the red component of the iron lines strongly exceeds the blue one for all positive scan positions , including tp 0.0 . in the meantime",
    ", the intensity excess in the blue components has strongly decreased at the negative scan positions .",
    "this variability points to ongoing changes in the local chromospheric kinematics , extending further eastwards across the chromospheric disk .",
    "similar temporal and spatial evolutions are observed in fig .  2 for other emission lines of fe",
    "ii @xmath12917.416 ( uv  61 ) ( _ dotted lines _ ) and al  ii ] @xmath12669.166 ( uv  1 ) ( _ solid lines _ ) .",
    "the latter semiforbidden line also shows the spatial reversal of the component maxima when scanning from tp 0.0 to @xmath17 in 1998 september . in 1999",
    "march both lines display a strengthening of the red peak over the blue maximum at tp 0.0 . however , component variations of lines that belong to the same multiplet are not necessarily identical .",
    "for example , fe  ii @xmath12880.756 ( _ long dash - dotted lines _ ) is a transition with large oscillator strength of the same @xmath28 uv multiplet .",
    "this line permanently displays a stronger blue emission maximum ( but is also blended with cr  ii @xmath12880.863 which could distort its shape ) .",
    "differences in profile changes are also observed among other lines with high and low log(@xmath12)-values that belong to the same multiplet . in general , the leading lines of a multiplet have deep and broad self - reversals , and display stronger blue emission maxima during our monitoring period . on the other hand ,",
    "the unsaturated lines display a systematic evolution , which comprises spatial and temporal intensity reversals of their component maxima .",
    "such lines are useful to track the detailed chromospheric kinematics .",
    "the component separation of core - saturated ( i.e. strongly opacity broadened ) lines of many fe  ii multiplets typically exceeds 60  @xmath3 , whereas the maxima of lines with unsaturated cores can be separated by less than 40  @xmath3 ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "we note however that unblended lines with central absorption intensities above the level of the background continuum are rather scarce in the very crowded near - uv spectrum of @xmath0  ori .",
    "two other examples are fe  ii @xmath12759.336 ( uv  32 ) and fe  ii @xmath12449.739 ( uv  34 ) .",
    "these lines display morphologic changes very similar to the profiles shown in fig .  1 , including the sudden reduction of their component ratios from tp 0.0 to @xmath17 in 1998 september .",
    "similar behavior is observed in fig .  2 for the somewhat stronger fe  ii @xmath12984.831 line of uv  78 ( _ short dash - dotted lines _ ) .",
    "note that this line displays a stronger red component in 1999 march , which is also observed at tp  0.0 for fe  ii @xmath12917 ( _ dotted lines _ ) and for the al  ii line ( _ solid lines _ ) .",
    "the weakly intensity saturated fe  ii @xmath12402 line in fig .  1 ( _ dotted lines _ )",
    ", with higher optical depth , also displays the spatial component reversal of 1998 september , which is observed for the two unsaturated lines in this figure , and for the al  ii line of fig .  2 .    in fig",
    "3 we show the reversals between tps 0.0 and @xmath290.025 for these four lines . the al  ii line ( _ solid lines in upper panels _ )",
    "is drawn for two overlapping echelle orders .",
    "the close agreement confirms that instrumental noise remains small .",
    "current stis performance monitoring indicates that the e230 m and e230h gratings are only affected by scattered light to 4% at 2500   @xcite .",
    "errorbars on the line intensities are also plotted for the fe  ii @xmath12869 line ( _ dash - dotted lines in upper panels _ ) , and the weaker si  i line ( _ solid lines in lower panels _ ) .",
    "the errorbars are provided by the stis calibration pipeline and are mainly determined by the accuracy of the absolute sensitivity calibration of the e230 m grating and of the aperture throughput , and by the bias and background subtractions in case of low intensities .",
    "we observe these reversals however near disk center for which the spectra have good s / n@xmath240 , with global count rates @xmath22000  @xmath30 .",
    "the spatial intensity changes in the emission components exceed these errorbars , which indicates that the systematic differences result from changes in the line formation conditions across the chromospheric disk .    in summary ,",
    "we observe systematic profile changes in weak emission lines of various species , that are formed in betelgeuse s chromosphere .",
    "the line shapes are characterized by asymmetries which vary with the chromospheric kinematics .",
    "spatially resolved observations of selected ( unblended and unsaturated ) lines reveal that complex chromospheric velocity structures are present during these variability phases .",
    "the upper panel of fig .",
    "4 shows a portion of betelgeuse s near - uv spectrum ( _ thick solid lines _ ) , observed between 2735   and 2750   .",
    "this medium - resolution spectrum was obtained at intensity peakup ( tp 0.0 ) in 1998 september .",
    "the region between 2736   and 2745   is obtained from two overlapping echelle orders , for which the emergent fluxes closely match .",
    "this region is typical for the star s uv spectrum which displays a forest of emission peaks , crossed by broad zero - flux absorption troughs that are seen against an apparent mean level of the uv background .",
    "these zero - flux cores have been identified in @xcite , and result from prominent self - reversals of many blended fe  ii lines , mostly of uv - multiplets 62 and 63 .",
    "the synthetic spectrum for this region is shown by the thin drawn solid line .",
    "for this computation we apply the mean thermodynamic model atmosphere of @xcite .",
    "this model has been determined from nlte fits to the h@xmath0 profile , observed in 1993 february .",
    "the normalized core depth of h@xmath0 was equal to within 5% of the depth observed in 1998 october .",
    "the spectrum in fig .",
    "4 is however computed for lte conditions in plane - parallel geometry .",
    "this is because a detailed nlte synthesis would require much more elaborate computations that solve the radiative transfer and rate equations for the very complex fe  ii atom .",
    "this is outside the scope of our present study which merely tries to identify the strongest spectral features from these approximate fits .",
    "we find that an lte synthesis already meets this goal very closely .",
    "this spectral region is well - matched by only considering fe  i  - and fe  ii - lines in the synthesis , shown by the dotted line ( _ upper panel _ ) .",
    "the positions of the strongest fe  ii lines are marked in the stellar rest frame .",
    "the lower energy levels of these lines do not exceed @xmath23  ev , with log(@xmath12)-values typically above @xmath91 .",
    "the iron spectrum fits the majority of the observed strong spectral features .",
    "the synthetic spectrum computed with all atomic species is shown by the thin solid line .",
    "differences with the iron spectrum remain limited , although some weaker absorption cores in the observed spectrum are also identified as cr  ii lines at the indicated wavelengths . the line list and",
    "the atomic line data are available from kurucz website ( 1998 ) .",
    "note that the current atomic data produces unobserved strong iron emission lines , for example fe  i @xmath12737.633 and fe  ii @xmath12744.897 .",
    "the log(@xmath12)-values of the transitions at @xmath12737 and at @xmath12745 are computed to be too strong ( respectively @xmath91.801 and @xmath91.727 ) .",
    "note however that the small log(@xmath12)-value of @xmath90.939 , given in @xcite for the fe  ii @xmath12741.394 line , produces an emission line intensity which matches the observations .    on the other hand",
    ", our spectral synthesis correctly reproduces the strong self - absorption cores observed in the leading lines of subordinate iron multiplets ( i.e. fe  ii @xmath12739.548 with log(@xmath12)=0.233 ) , which suggests that these @xmath31-values are appropriate .",
    "the broad overlapping line wings occasionally match the observed near - uv background fluxes ( i.e. near 2748   ) .",
    "note that @xcite confirmed with ghrs spectra that this background , first detected with iue , is a true continuum which is not due to scattering inside the spectrograph .",
    "they also argued that it appears to originate in the chromosphere at temperatures ranging from 3000@xmath95000  k , in agreement with our semi - empirical chromospheric model .",
    "it is of note that the near - uv fluxes of betelgeuse also vary slightly over different regions of the inner chromospheric disk .",
    "@xcite found excess emission in the radial intensity distribution observed in the near - uv in 1995 march .",
    "this resulted from a brighter feature seen in the sw disk quadrant .",
    "this ` spot ' was observed within 25  mas of the disk center .",
    "similar , but not identical , patterns in the uv - continuum brightness are also observed within @xmath230  mas of intensity maximum , in dithered foc images that are simultaneously monitored with the stis spectra @xcite .",
    "we conjecture that these uv - continuum patterns are related to the asymmetric brightness distributions observed by @xcite with optical interferometry .",
    "they suggest that the dominant tio opacity in the optical is very sensitive to small differences in local thermodynamic conditions across the photosphere , because no brightness asymmetries have been measured in the near - ir where tio opacity is almost absent ( r. kurucz , 2000 , private communication ) .",
    "probably , a similar temperature / density dependence for the chromospheric continuum level can alter the emergent near - uv fluxes that are observed across the chromospheric disk .",
    "the lte spectral synthesis is performed through the stellar chromosphere to check for possible blends in the profile of the lines we discussed in the previous section .",
    "the lower panels of fig .  4 show the computed lte spectrum near the si  i @xmath12516 line ( _ panel left _ ) and the al  ii ] @xmath12669 line ( _ panel right _ ) .",
    "the observed profiles of 1998 september are boldly drawn .",
    "they are shown for tp 0.0 ( _ solid lines _ ) and tp @xmath290.025 ( _ dashed lines _ ) , and display the remarkable spatial reversal of their component maxima .",
    "two al  ii profiles are drawn for each pointing position , obtained from two overlapping echelle orders .",
    "the computed profiles are shown by the thin dash - dotted lines .",
    "the si  i resonance line becomes strongly self - absorbed because of its high log(@xmath12)-value ( 0.241 ) and very small lower energy level .",
    "the al  ii is a zero electron - volt semiforbidden transition with a weaker self - reversal due to its smaller optical thickness and low log(@xmath12)-value of @xmath94.69 . after broadening the computed si",
    "i profile with the instrumental resolution , and with a total value for @xmath32sin@xmath33 and macroturbulence of 9@xmath341  @xmath3 , we find that the shape of the self - absorption core ( _ thin drawn solid line _ ) closely matches the observed core profiles .",
    "the width of this scattering core is strongly dependent on the microturbulence velocity profile in the chromosphere , which ranges up to 19  @xmath3 in our model .",
    "the component maxima of the computed profiles assume equal intensities because a hydrostatic model chromosphere is applied .",
    "this reveals that both lines are not blended with other strong chromospheric emission lines .",
    "however , the spectral synthesis yields weak emission lines of fe  ii @xmath12516.407 and of fe  i @xmath12516.571 .",
    "both iron lines appear unobserved when comparing the computed ( and broadened ) profile with the long - wavelength wing of the observed profiles .",
    "their log(@xmath12)-values are predicted to be too high , similar to the iron lines in the upper panel of this figure .",
    "this is also found for the predicted cr  ii line at @xmath12668.707 with high log(@xmath12)=@xmath90.524 .",
    "the strong emission components are not observed , but its deep self - reversal can be identified with a broad absorption core which is observed at the short - wavelength side of the al  ii line .",
    "@xcite measured highly supersonic average chromospheric turbulent velocities in the range of 31@xmath935  @xmath3 from the doppler fwhm of intercombination lines of c  ii and si  ii , and from fluorescent co  ii and fe  ii lines .",
    "these values are however based on the assumption that these emission lines can be considered as optically thin , and that the broadening is controlled by turbulence rather than opacity effects .",
    "our spectral synthesis and detailed radiative transfer modeling reveals however that macroturbulence is not the main broadening mechanism and that chromospheric emission lines in @xmath0  ori are considerably opacity broadened .",
    "their high macrobroadening values are therefore strongly overestimated since the line widths are determined by various other broadening mechanisms .",
    "it is to be remembered that the fwhm of a spectral line is determined by the thermal motions of the gas _ and _ the ( projected ) _ micro_turbulence velocity when radiative transfer effects are important .",
    "next to these effects , the lines shape can broaden further by _ macro_broadening .",
    "the latter conserves the total line flux , and can result from large - scale mass movements , stellar rotation ( @xmath32sin@xmath33 ) , and the instrumental dispersion . in the lower panel of fig . 4 ( _ right _ )",
    "we compute that about half of the observed fwhm of the al  ii @xmath12669 intercombination line ( _ bold lines _ ) results by radiative transport in the chromospheric formation region ( _ thin dash - dotted line _ ) , whereas the remainder of the line width can be ascribed to macrobroadening .",
    "since the rotational broadening for betelgeuse and the instrumental broadening are small we compute a value of 9  @xmath3 for the large - scale ( macroturbulent ) velocity for convolution with the predicted spectrum to obtain an overall best match with the observed near - uv spectrum ( _ upper panel _ ) .",
    "although the c  ii ] lines do not display self - absorbed central cores as the al  ii ] line , it has been pointed out that these lines should _ not _ be considered as optically thin transitions .",
    "@xcite presented a discussion about effects of radiative transfer on the c  ii intercombination lines .",
    "they assumed that these lines are ` effectively ' optically thin , and applied the ` mean escape probability approximation ' to determine the electron density in the mean formation region .",
    "they derive @xmath35@xmath27@xmath36 @xmath37 , which is about a factor of ten larger than in our semi - empirical model @xcite , which is based on detailed radiative transfer modeling of h@xmath0 , mg  ii @xmath15 & @xmath13 , and tio bandheads .",
    "however , @xcite also conclude that the optical depth inferred from their line ratio estimates are high enough in the chromosphere to influence these ratios , and thereby `` render all conclusions based upon the assumption of optically thin line formation invalid for these lines '' .",
    "it has been known for some time that this assumption yields very different values for the chromospheric electron density .",
    "for example , @xcite measure @xmath22@xmath38@xmath39 , @xmath25@xmath38@xmath40 , and @xmath21@xmath38@xmath40 @xmath37 , for the three line ratios , assuming a temperature of @xmath41  k in the line formation region .",
    "comparative studies by @xcite demonstrated that the relative intensities of the c  ii ] lines are variable between exposures with iue .",
    "they noted that electron densities derived from different line ratios were incompatible , and reported evidence of variation in the line profile from one exposure to another .",
    "this variability points to line broadening mechanisms determined by important radiative transport effects in these transitions .",
    "the profile of the si  i @xmath12516 line also shows strong temporal changes besides the spatial variations discussed above .",
    "for instance , in 1992 the ghrs disk - integrated self - absorption core revealed a blue - shift by @xmath210  @xmath3 , compared with the 1998 - 99 stis scans .",
    "its red component maximum strongly exceeded the blue one , while the former became much weaker in 1998 - 99 .",

    "but the spatial reversal observed at tp @xmath290.025 in 1998 september ( see fig .  3 ) indicates the local alteration of this downflow into upflow .",
    "we infer the corresponding kinematic structure in the chromosphere from a refined nlte modeling of these variable component ratios , based on the thermodynamic model of @xcite .",
    "we utilize the smulti code @xcite .",
    "it computes emergent line profiles in moving media and accounts for their formation in spherical geometry and non - lte conditions .",
    "the equation of state considers the ionization stages of hydrogen and helium ( for solar abundance values ) , and the electron pressure .",
    "the statistical equilibrium and rate equations are solved for two adjacent ionization stages of the species ( with a user defined abundance ) for which we model the spectral line shape with detailed radiative transport calculations .",
    "the code outputs the line flux , the ionization fraction for the considered element , together with its departure coefficients from lte for the ionization and excitation fractions per model layer and atomic energy level .",
    "the non - lte equilibria are very sensitive to the kinetic temperature and the local electron density ( @xmath35 ) adopted in the model atmosphere .",
    "the model is obtained by semi - empirically varying both structures with height , until the ` best match ' is obtained with the observed line flux and shape .",
    "the computation of emission lines formed in the chromosphere with spherical geometry is critically dependent on @xmath35 , because the chromosphere is predominantly cooled by mechanisms which depend linearly on @xmath35 per gram ( electron collisional excitation of neutral and singly ionized species and @xmath42 recombination ; see * ? ? ?",
    "the modeling method is based on the mass conservation technique ( eq .",

    "this could explain why the latter line appears so strongly in emission , whereas the line at @xmath12519 , with otherwise comparable oscillator strength and transition probability ( @xmath51 ) , does not",
    ". the present modeling procedure does not readily account for changes in the branching ratios due to pumping , or by photon conversions due to this fe  ii blend .",
    "such changes by extra photo - excitation on the emergent intensity ratios of these lines , sharing the same upper level , are however not relevant to fit _ relative _ intensities of the component maxima in the si  i @xmath12516 line .",
    "fluorescence in this transition enhances both components equally , which can be accounted for by scaling up the predicted profile .",
    "the upper left panel of fig .  5 shows the best fit ( _ thin solid line _ ) to the si  i line observed at tp 0.0 in 1998 september ( _ bold solid line _ ) .",
    "the computed profiles in this figure are spatially resolved by summing the intensity contributions from light rays that propagate parallel to the line of sight , and cross the projected surface area within the field of view , for each aperture position on the chromospheric disk .",
    "this integration is performed along the width ( 25  mas ) and height ( 100  mas ) of the slit , placed in off - sets of 25  mas from the center of our model atmosphere .",
    "these fluxes are multiplied by the geometric weighting factors to account for the spherical curvature of the atmosphere ( or the path length for every ray within the sector of the chromospheric model included in the stis aperture ) , to yield the emergent spatial line intensities . for these computations the photospheric core radius of 27.5  mas",
    "is set to @xmath52=700  @xmath53 , where @xmath54=1 .",
    "there are 21 model layers below this point ( where @xmath55@xmath27@xmath56 ) , with the deepest layer located at 8.6@xmath38@xmath57  cm ( @xmath212  @xmath53 or 0.017  @xmath52 ) below the formation region of the photospheric continuum .",
    "the radiative transport is solved for 5 rays intersecting this core , whereas light rays that graze the photospheric core are computed throughout the outer 50 layers above the core radius . in these chromospheric layers the kinetic temperature @xmath55 increases from a minimum of 2769  k to a maximum of 5443  k",
    ", then decreases outwards to @xmath23000  k at a height of 9.3  @xmath52 .",
    "for the _ hipparcos _",

    "therefore , light rays that _ start _ from layers above 87.5  mas ( outside the field of view ) do not contribute to the intensity integration .",
    "these layers of course do contribute farther out to passing rays that start deeper , inside the projected slit area . note that the pointing jitter for these observations in the hst fine - lock mode remains typically below 3.5  mas , which is sufficiently small with respect to the slit size to enable an effective comparison of the emergent line intensities with scan position .    the computed profile of si  i @xmath12516 at tp 0.0 in fig .",
    "5 matches the observed line shape with a downfalling mean velocity structure , shown in the upper right - hand panel ( _ solid line _ ) .",
    "we compute that a radial acceleration of this inflow , from rest to 1.4  @xmath3 at 1.85  @xmath52 above the photospheric radius , produces the observed intensity ratio of the line components within their errorbars at central intensity .",
    "an increase of the downflow velocity by 1.6  @xmath3 ( _ dotted line _ for a terminal inflow velocity of 3  @xmath3 ) increases this ratio by @xmath225  % , which indicates that the detailed si  i line shape serves as an accurate velocity indicator in the chromosphere .",
    "note that there is slight movement of the central core depending on the terminal velocity , but the line asymmetry is more pronounced and more easily measured .",
    "a velocity structure for which the inflow accelerates slowly ( _ long dash - dotted line _ ) to 1.4  @xmath3 produces a blue emission component that is @xmath220% too weak compared to a velocity structure which steeply accelerates in the deeper chromospheric layers .",
    "the latter mean velocity structure provides the best match with the profile observed at tp  0.0 .",
    "the contribution from the photospheric continuum becomes largest with respect to the line flux because the slit width mainly samples light rays that start inside the photospheric core .",
    "the rays that contribute along the slit height also include grazing rays out to 50  mas . on the other hand ,",
    "the off - star scan positions chiefly integrate rays that graze the inner core .",
    "this adds little or no photospheric background continuum , which is shown in the lower panels of fig .  5 by the thin drawn solid lines .",
    "note that we compute this background with the uppsala opacity package in spherical geometry as well .",
    "the photospheric background flux is dominated by @xmath58-opacity of h and @xmath42 , whereas in the chromosphere the continua of al and mg are important ( i.e. the strong bound - free opacity edge of mg  i at 2513   ) , besides the electron opacity . for a gas of solar abundance",
    "we compute that hydrogen is partially ionized up to 35  % near the temperature maximum .",
    "our detailed modeling procedure requires a redshift for the synthetic profiles of @xmath2918.3  @xmath3 to provide a best global fit to the line shape observed at tp 0.0 .",
    "the profiles are computed in the stellar rest frame , and have to be corrected for the stellar radial velocity in the heliocentric frame . the computed profiles in fig .",
    "5 are plotted with a redshift of @xmath2918.3  @xmath3 , for all the scan positions .",
    "it is of note however that this value does not equal the center - of - mass velocity of @xmath0  ori . between 1998",
    "january and september we detect redshifts of @xmath2@xmath298  @xmath3 in the scattering cores of fe  ii @xmath12392 and si  i @xmath12516 , which are typical for most emission lines in the near - uv spectrum ( * ? ?",
    "* see sect .",
    "this results from mean chromospheric mass movements .",
    "for example ,",
    "in 1992 september the central core of si  i @xmath12516 strongly blueshifted during a phase of global chromospheric expansion , and which enhanced its long wavelength emission component .",
    "chromospheric emission lines exhibit temporal variations of radial velocity that are comparable to the amplitude of the photospheric radial velocity curve .",
    "an overview of optical radial velocity studies for @xmath0  ori is given in @xcite .",
    "these raster scans further reveal that the intensity of the background emission near 2500   reduces almost linearly from tp  @xmath290.025 to tp  @xmath290.075 , about halving at each subsequent scan position .",
    "this dimming is smaller in bright emission lines ( or in their components ) observed for this wavelength region .",
    "it results in brighter line emission maxima ( i.e. they show limb - brightening ) with respect to the background level when scanning off the disk . for the si  i line of fig .  5 this ratio changes from @xmath24 at tp  0.0 to @xmath27 at tps  @xmath340.075 . this distribution of emergent line intensities is well matched with our mean thermodynamic model atmosphere .",
    "the model also reproduces the gradual weakening observed in the depth of self - absorption cores with respect to the off - star background levels .",
    "this spatial behavior is for instance clearly noticeable in the unsaturated core of the fe  ii line at 2868   of fig .",
    "it results from the decrease in column density of the scattering material in the upper chromosphere with larger viewing angles .",
    "this effect is reproduced in fig .  5 with our spatially resolved radiative transfer calculations .",
    "another important effect in modeling betelgeuse s chromospheric kinematics is the geometric projection of its ( complex ) wind structure when scanning towards the limb .",
    "for the ideal case of a radially expanding ( contracting ) wind , which sustains a single velocity with distance , the doppler position of the self - reversal is displaced from shorter ( longer ) wavelengths towards the rest - frequency of the line near the limb . near the disk edge the central core forms in flow directions that are nearly perpendicular to the line of sight , whereas at disk center its formation chiefly samples the wind flow parallel with this line .",
    "through this projection effect , emergent line profiles become more symmetric when scanning closer to the limb .",
    "the profile at peakup position ( at or near the disk center ) probes the radial component of the outflow ( inflow ) velocity because this self - absorption core mainly forms in front of the disk , suppressing the resulting blue ( red ) emission component according the magnitude and direction of the mean flow velocity .    in reality",
    "this ideal scenario is severely complicated in several ways .",
    "the size of the aperture still covers about a quarter of the uv - disk area , so that towards opposite ends of the slit , light rays are integrated that emerge from radial outflow ( or inflow ) with reversed directions , perpendicular to the line of sight on either side of the chromospheric front hemisphere .",
    "although the intensity contribution from these rays is smaller than for rays collected near the middle of the aperture , they reduce the asymmetry of the integrated line profile . this effect diminishes when scanning off the disk where the field of view samples a more uniform ( tangential ) flow direction , but where the line intensity ( and s / n ) diminishes as well .",
    "further complications arise from probable velocity variations along the radial wind profile in the star s extended chromosphere .",
    "the detailed wind structure may accelerate and/or decelerate with distance above the photosphere . the higher inflow velocity at larger distance in fig .",
    "5 causes the strong component asymmetry computed for tp  0.0 ( _ thin solid line _ ) , which is observed in 1998 april ( _ bold dash - dotted line _ ) and 1998 september ( _ bold solid line _ ) . for",
    "tps  @xmath22 and @xmath23 the asymmetry in the computed profiles reduces noticeably due to the geometric projection .",
    "this effect is observed at the negative scan positions , in agreement with our spatially resolved modeling .",
    "but the profiles observed at positive scan positions clearly do not match this model with downflow .",
    "these off - star component maxima in 1998 september reverse with respect to tp  0.0 .",
    "the emission maxima at the positive scan positions are best fit ( _ thin dash - dotted lines _ ) with an outflowing ( mean ) velocity of 0.5  @xmath3 , shown by the dash - dotted line in the upper right - hand panel . note that it closely fits the relative and absolute component intensities at tps @xmath290.025 and @xmath290.075 .",
    "however , the absolute intensity of the profile predicted for tp @xmath59 is somewhat too strong .",
    "this can result from the mean thermodynamic model we apply for all scan positions .",
    "small spatial differences across the chromosphere in the local kinetic temperature or electron density may account for small differences in the absolute intensity distribution of the line .",
    "this is not unexpected , since images of betelgeuse display chromospheric surface features . on the other hand ,",
    "the relative intensity distribution in the line components chiefly depends on the detailed chromospheric velocity structure , which is reproduced with this spatially resolved modeling .",
    "further simulations reveal that the systematic and prominent component reversal from tp @xmath60 to tp @xmath17 can not be modeled with complex non - monotonic radial velocity structures that collapse and expand with depth .",
    "the reversals occur too close to the inner ( photospheric ) disk radius , because these profiles mainly sample chromospheric mass movements parallel to our line of sight .",
    "this excludes the possibility that reversals can result from a combination of the projection effect and a _ unique _ but non - monotonic radial velocity structure . in principle",
    ", such combination can produce component reversals for the outer scan positions , which sample a more uni - directional flow in the field - of - view .",
    "however , for the inner scan positions appreciable contributions occur from light rays crossing opposite flow directions on either side of the front hemisphere , when a unique ( but complex ) radial velocity structure is assumed .",
    "such contributions render the integrated profiles more symmetric , contrary to what is observed at tps 0.0 and @xmath290.025 .",
    "our modeling shows that the reversals , observed at these inner scan positions , can only be caused by an inversion in the mean radial flow direction between these scan positions .",
    "this implies that the chromosphere assumes an inherently non - radial velocity structure in september 1998 .",
    "figure  6 shows a three - dimensional schematic representation of the chromospheric velocity structure , inferred from the spatially resolved observations and the detailed line profile modeling .",
    "the dashed lines mark the aperture positions with respect to the photospheric hemisphere , drawn by the dotted circles which contour surface areas of @xmath61 latitude and longitude .",
    "the size and direction of the arrows indicate the radial speed and flow direction above a surface area for the chromospheric fluid in the front hemisphere . this radial velocity structure",
    "is represented at four depths in the chromosphere .",
    "it clearly illustrates the projection effect for grazing light rays that cross the chromosphere at different locations within the aperture , and for different scan positions of the latter on the chromospheric disk . the chromospheric velocity pattern of 1998 january shows a decelerating mean downflow since the blue component maxima of unsaturated lines are stronger across the disk .",
    "this observed line asymmetry slightly enhances for negative scan positions in 1998 april , which is represented by a somewhat stronger downflow on the eastern ( left - hand ) hemisphere .",
    "the reversals discussed above in the component maxima of unsaturated lines , observed from tp 0.0 to @xmath17 in 1998 september , are represented by outflow in the deeper chromospheric layers on the western ( right - hand ) hemisphere ( lower left graph ) .",
    "this local upflow occurs inside a larger collapsing chromospheric envelope .",
    "the mean downflow in this outer envelope is observed through the stronger blue components of many lines with saturated scattering cores ( like fe  ii @xmath12881 and fe  ii @xmath12985 in fig .",
    "2 ) that sample a bigger and more extended chromospheric volume in the line of sight , with higher optical depths than the cores of the unsaturated lines .",
    "this global chromospheric inflow strongly decelerates or begins to reverse in 1999 march when much more symmetric line profiles are observed .",
    "the reduction of the line asymmetry extends further towards the negative scan positions , and is represented by outflow from deeper layers , extending higher up in the chromosphere towards the eastern hemisphere ( lower right - hand graph ) .",
    "this systematic evolution indicates a stratified flow that is not strictly radial in betelgeuse s extended chromosphere , and which reverses from a global contraction into expansion during this 15 months monitoring period .",
    "the difference we determine for 1998 september of mean inflow of 1.4  @xmath3 at tp 0.0 and mean outflow of 0.5  @xmath3 at tp @xmath17 is small , since it does not exceed the isothermal sound speed of @xmath27  @xmath3 in the chromosphere . however , the doppler position of the si  i self - absorption core samples the depth - integrated fluid velocity .",
    "local flow velocities in the chromosphere can be much higher on a length scale smaller than the mean formation region for this scattering core , but which become averaged out by this depth integral .",
    "this is illustrated by the small distance of only 0.015  @xmath52 a ` mean ' upflow with 0.5  @xmath3 would travel between 1998 september and 1999 march .",
    "it is therefore relevant to compare these average fluid velocities with the large value for the macrobroadening of 9@xmath341  @xmath3 , required to derive the correct line width from the predicted ( nlte ) profile , after correcting for the instrumental spectral resolution .",
    "this value is also well - constrained because higher values would produce self - reversals that are too broad and too shallow for the detailed fits of fig .",
    "@xcite also determined that the observed profile shapes rule out large - scale non - thermal motion of more than 10  @xmath3 . since the @xmath32sin@xmath33-value for this evolved supergiant",
    "is expected not to exceed @xmath25  @xmath3 , this large macrobroadening - value can in part result from actual large - scale turbulent movements in the chromosphere .",
    "strong large - scale up- and downflow in betelgeuse s chromosphere can not be ruled out because @xcite determined a value of 12@xmath340.5  @xmath3 for the photospheric macrobroadening from single and unblended absorption lines observed with very high spectral resolution around 10800   .",
    "these metal lines also provided an accurate value of 2@xmath341  @xmath3 for the projected microturbulence velocity in the photosphere .",
    "the large difference between the photospheric microturbulence of @xmath22  @xmath3 and a macroturbulence velocity of 16@xmath349  @xmath3 , has also been observed for the m1.5 iab supergiant @xmath0  sco by @xcite .",
    "the variable brightness patterns observed by @xcite in the near - uv of betelgeuse can result from large - scale convective movements in the deeper photosphere which penetrate the lower chromosphere .",
    "convection plumes that occasionally overshoot the chromospheric temperature minimum will cause small differences in the local kinetic temperature and produce the observed flux variations .",
    "most importantly , our best fits to the line width observed near the disk center and near the limb in fig .  5",
    "require a constant value for the velocity of this ` chromospheric macroturbulence ' , projected in the line of sight .",
    "for every scan position we convolve with the same gaussian macrobroadening profile .",
    "it indicates that these large - scale turbulent motions remain isotropic or angle independent across the chromosphere . this constant value for macrobroadening",
    "is also measured in the scan of 1998 january ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , when the scan axis was tilted by @xmath9@xmath62 with respect to the east - west direction .",
    "a clear change of the total line width caused by the different slit orientation is not apparent , which indicates that the observed macrobroadening is not determined by high projected rotation velocities ( @xmath32sin@xmath33-values ) in this line .",
    "the spatial invariance for this broadening , observed in these optically thick emission lines , appears to be linked with an isotropic and uniform large - scale velocity field in the star s extended chromosphere .",
    "the limited ( subsonic ) changes we observe in the average fluid velocity across the chromosphere , and this invariable macro - turbulence field could indicate that these small velocities are interdependent or originate from the same type of velocity field .",
    "in other words , subsonic non - radial oscillations of the entire chromosphere may produce uniform ( macroturbulent ) eddies with similar or higher velocities on smaller length scales ( e.g. like shaking a ` snowglobe ' ) .",
    "the latter are clearly not resolved with the 25 mas by 100 mas aperture since the observed line broadening remains constant across the disk .",
    "this observation strongly suggests that macro - turbulence in betelgeuse s _ chromosphere _ can not be interpreted as due to the spatial inhomogeneity of a large - scale granular velocity field that consists of a few convection cells .",
    "energy cascading from large - scale eddies onto smaller length - scales with higher velocities , under gravitational confinement , is also consistent with the highly supersonic microturbulence velocities in our chromospheric model .",
    "these velocities are required to match the shape and width of the self - absorption core , or the separation of the emission line components ( see figs .",
    "the core forms on average higher in the chromosphere than the emission line wings , where this small - scale velocity field also increases in our model .",
    "it is of note that @xcite have shown that the supersonic photospheric microturbulence observed for the hotter and more luminous supergiant @xmath63  cas ( f2@xmath9 g @xmath64 ) can be mimicked with hot and thin sheet - like layers , produced by the wakes of outward propagating shock wave trains .",
    "the hydrodynamic motions in these shocked layers are small ( with machnumbers close to unity ) , but their high temperatures account for the observed extra thermal line broadening that mimics a strong micro-`turbulence ' .    for @xmath0  sco a @xcite computed that these shock waves have average wavelengths of about twice the local density scale height , which is much longer than the correlation length for the small - scale density / temperature fluctuations affecting the population densities in the radiative transfer ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . a microturbulent ` filter function ' provides the fraction of kinetic energy of the large - scale motion field at a given wavelength which contributes to the microturbulent broadening of a spectral line @xcite .",
    "based on the line formation function , and the field of temperature fluctuations produced in the wakes of these shock trains , an integral function is obtained from which the atmospheric _ quasi - microturbulence _ can be computed .",
    "it is of note that in ( limited ) 3d simulations of compressible turbulence @xcite demonstrated that shock waves develop from an initially uniform state which has been perturbed by randomly oriented , isentropic , sinusoidal sound waves .",
    "many shock surfaces develop in the flow and intersect along lines from which slip surfaces , or sheets of vorticity emanate .",
    "since a field of outward propagating sound waves is expected to be generated by the deeper convection zones in cool massive stars , these 3d shock wave collisions can develop into a large number of vortex tubes in higher layers .",
    "possibly they can produce the high microturbulence velocities we observe in betelgeuse s chromosphere ?",
    "chromospheric alvn wave heating in @xmath0  ori was discussed by @xcite .",
    "@xcite recently discussed the results of 2.5 mhd modeling work and concluded that a high mass - loss rate of @xmath65  @xmath66 can be explained if the magnetic field is several hundred gauss in the lower chromosphere .",
    "however , observational indications for such large magnetic field strengths have presently not been demonstrated .",
    "different types of detailed non - magnetic hydrodynamic calculations have been presented with respect to heating and dynamics of low - gravity atmospheres .",
    "@xcite assumes the ( stochastic ) generation of acoustic waves by the subphotospheric convection zone that propagate into the chromosphere .",
    "it is unclear how acoustic waves alone can create the global downfall for the very extended chromosphere of betelgeuse ( more than seven times @xmath52 ) , as we observe in our stis spectra of 1998 .",
    "@xcite computed the development of large - scale mass motions in circumstellar environments which result from photospheric pulsations ( or piston action ) in agb stars .",
    "these models do not propagate into a hotter chromosphere ( as exists for betelgeuse ) , and rely on radiation pressure on dust grains to accelerate the circumstellar gas .",
    "betelgeuse s chromosphere is too hot for dust nucleation @xcite .",
    "we suggest that further hydrodynamic modeling should combine a cyclic acceleration of the deeper atmosphere by photospheric pulsations which strongly enhance the atmospheric density scale height , with the generation of gravity waves that can produce sound waves and dissipating shocks at large distance from the surface .",
    "we think that the opportunity exists to compute such models for the very extended and dynamic chromosphere of betelgeuse , but that has not yet been accomplished .    whether @xmath0  ori s extended chromosphere results from heating by viscous dissipation of turbulent energy , small - scale pressure waves and/or periodic photospheric accelerations , linked with the non - radial chromospheric movements we presently detect , can only be addressed when the source of these large - scale vibrations has been identified .",
    "semi - regular pulsation of stellar photospheres is traditionally attributed to intermode beating of different radial pulsation frequencies , producing a long ` quasi'-periodicity , observed in betelgeuse ( src ) .",
    "however , attempts by @xcite to fit its radial velocity ( rv ) curve with single- and double - mode sinusoids did not provide any satisfactory explanation ( for a discussion see their fig .",
    "the long quasi - periodicity of light- and rv - curve of betelgeuse is observed in other cool pulsating massive ( ia and iab ) supergiants as well .",
    "for example , for the yellow hypergiant @xmath63  cas ( @xmath64 ) , with @xmath52@xmath27400@xmath34100  @xmath53 , @xcite demonstrated from an improved baade - wesselink pulsation test that photospheric _ radial _ pulsations must be discarded to combine @xmath56-changes with the co - eval rv- and light - curve , observed over a complete variability period . though the opacity , energetics , and atmospheric structure of @xmath63  cas is likely quite different than @xmath0  ori due to differences in the effective temperatures and evolutionary state of these two stars .",
    "@xcite noted the absence of a one - to - one correlation between short - term radial velocity and visual brightness variations in betelgeuse , which makes it apparent that these changes are not global in nature .",
    "velocities associated with non - radial oscillation are expected to have a horizontal component as well .",
    "for adiabatic boundary conditions , the ratio of horizontal to vertical displacements is equal to 1 over the dimensionless pulsation frequency squared @xcite . for red supergiants",
    "this number is very small , suggesting that the component of vertical motions is very small .",
    "this is particularly true for gravity modes .",
    "the small radial velocities we measure from the emission line asymmetries across the chromospheric disk ( not in excess of 2  @xmath3 between simultaneous up- and downflows ) , compared to the horizontal velocity required to extend the upflow in the lower chromosphere from the western towards the eastern hemisphere ( thus at least over one stellar radius ) between 1998 september and 1999 march , appears to support the g - mode hypothesis .",
    "hayes ( 1980 , 1981 , 1984 ) provided other observational indications for local non - radial pulsation of betelgeuse s atmosphere .",
    "long - term monitoring of linear polarization changes reveals the presence of surface features which likely result from the waxing and waning of large - scale convective cells .",
    "gravity modes with @xmath67=0 ( radial motion ) or @xmath67=1 ( dipole motion ) do not distort the star s spherical shape and can therefore be discounted to explain the changes of net polarization which occur over intervals of about one year .",
    "he also found that the changes of the @xmath68 and @xmath14 stokes parameters are not conform with polarization changes expected for a single _ global _ pulsation mode .",
    "however , _ local _ non - radial pulsations provide a means of producing the requisite asymmetry .",
    "the ordered changes of polarization position angle can be explained by the changes in the orientation of a few large - scale surface elements ( i.e. convection cells ) which grow and fade over time , while migrating randomly across the stellar disk .",
    "preliminary hydrodynamic 3d - simulations of giant granules in the photosphere of an entire red supergiant are presented in @xcite .",
    "very high @xmath67-modes are not expected for supergiant pulsation because the wavelength of internal gravity waves propagating in these extended atmospheres should exceed the cut - off wavelength .",
    "the latter results from their radiative damping and the atmospheric curvature . based on the diagnostic ( @xmath69",
    ", @xmath70)-diagram @xcite pointed out that in the highest atmospheric levels of these stars only the very low - mode ( long wavelength ) gravity waves are possible . in deeper layers",
    "the damping cut - off wavelength becomes gradually shorter and higher gravity waves become possible .",
    "the more extended the atmosphere the lower the mode - number of gravity waves that may develop . in very cool stars , like betelgeuse ,",
    "for which the atmospheric pressure scale height is an appreciable fraction of the photospheric radius ( @xmath210% of @xmath52 ) , the convection region is well - developed and can extend up to optical depths as small as 0.3 .",
    "however , it is known that gravity waves can not propagate inside convectively stable regions where their minimum period ( the brunt - visl period ) becomes real ( and non - zero ) .",
    "gravity waves may arise above the convective layers by penetrative ( or overshoot ) convective motions .",
    "they could be triggered in the very upper photospheric layers and propagate randomly into the lower chromosphere , causing the upflow motions we presently detect .",
    "@xcite computed that a 440 day pulsation period for betelgeuse can be interpreted as the period @xmath70 of photospheric internal gravity waves with a wavelength @xmath69 between @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "these low - order gravity waves propagate nearly horizontally through the photosphere .",
    "non - radial pulsations of the deeper photosphere are a possible source for g - modes that cause similar oscillations of the chromosphere , because the amplitude of the radial velocity curve measured in the optical at oak ridge observatory @xcite indicates a redshift by 4 to 5 @xmath3 during the monitoring period with stis .",
    "an average collapse of the photosphere in the line of sight during this period is consistent with the mean downflow we observe for the larger chromospheric envelope .",
    "localized subsonic upflow in the deeper chromospheric layers can result from photospheric gravity waves that drive the complex chromospheric kinematics , because the total velocity amplitude of @xmath22  @xmath3 we measure at the inner disk in 1998 september remains within the velocity range of @xmath73 to 4.3  @xmath3 , predicted for these waves .",
    "but note that this phase - velocity equals the velocity amplitude only for strictly horizontally propagating planar waves .",
    "in reality the wavevector of a gravity wave has a radial component as well , and the velocity amplitude will differ from the ( group-)velocity of energy propagation .",
    "@xcite also noted that for betelgeuse a period of @xmath211 years , reported by @xcite , can result from gravity waves with a wavelength equal to the stellar circumference , or -what is the same- to photospheric non - radial pulsations with @xmath67=1 .",
    "it is interesting to note that recent time - dependent 3d hydrodynamic simulations by @xcite of a complete red giant star show highly non - symmetric global dipolar flows within the convective layer , as well as distinct radial pulsations driven by non - linear interactions of acoustic waves with convective motions .",
    "spherical harmonics of the radial velocity are dominated by the dipolar ( @xmath67=1 ) mode followed , at higher @xmath67-values , by a spectrum of modes similar to that of a kolmogorov turbulence spectrum .",
    "they note that the simulated oscillations can be induced by the large - scale convective motions .",
    "a more definitive answer requires detailed hydrodynamic modeling and a stability analysis of our model chromosphere against time - dependent mechanical perturbations .",
    "the placement of further constraints on the temporal properties of betelgeuse s chromospheric dynamics , based on semi - empirical modeling , would greatly benefit from observing near - uv chromospheric emission lines and unblended near - ir absorption lines that form deep in the photosphere , to track the velocity amplitudes and the detailed phase correlation of both atmospheric regions with sufficiently high temporal and spectral resolution , over at least a complete pulsation cycle .",
    "future spectral studies should also comprise spatially resolved high - dispersion observations of the na  i or k  i resonance lines to infer the velocity structure of the gas component in the ( asymmetric ) circumstellar dust shell , to test for possible correlations with the chromospheric kinematics of this supergiant star .",
    "@xmath33 . spatially resolved high - resolution spectra of selected emission lines in betelgeuse s near - uv spectrum reveal self - absorbed optically thick emission lines that display reversals in their component maxima when scanning across the chromospheric disk .",
    "we identify four unsaturated emission lines , si  i @xmath12516.1 , fe  ii @xmath12402.6 , fe  ii @xmath12868.9 , and al  ii ] @xmath12669.2 , that display a very similar evolution of their component maxima and of line morphology during this monitoring period of 15 months . a prominent reversal is observed for these lines in 1998 september at two subsequent scan positions near the disk center .",
    "we model with radiative transport calculations in nlte and spherical geometry the detailed shape of the si  i @xmath12516 resonance line for different scan positions .",
    "the spatially resolved modeling of this component reversal reveals a mean velocity for the chromospheric fluid with opposite flow directions and a difference of velocity amplitude of @xmath22  @xmath3 .",
    "this detailed modeling precludes a strictly radial mean velocity structure for the chromospheric kinematics .",
    "the temporal behavior observed in many other emission lines during this monitoring period indicates a chromospheric oscillation phase with global downflow between 1998 january and 1998 september .",
    "for the latter observation date local upflow commenced in deeper chromospheric layers of the western hemisphere , which extended further towards the eastern hemisphere in march 1999 .",
    "this global downflow is consistent with a redshift by 4 to 5 @xmath3 in the disk - integrated photospheric radial velocity curve observed in the optical .",
    "the detailed modeling of these spatially resolved si  i profiles requires a constant value for macro - broadening of 9@xmath341  @xmath3 at all scan positions .",
    "this implies a strongly isotropic and uniform large - scale velocity field across the stellar chromosphere , but which remains spatially unresolved with the 25  mas by 100  mas field of view .",
    "the modeling of the line profiles requires highly supersonic microturbulence velocities in the chromosphere .",
    "@xmath32 . in general",
    ", we observe and measure with elaborate radiative transport calculations an increase of hydrodynamic velocities with a decrease of their length scales in the chromosphere of betelgeuse .",
    "the very large - scale global chromospheric oscillation is non - radial and subsonic .",
    "the large - scale macroturbulence is isotropic with a velocity around the isothermal sound speed in the chromosphere .",
    "the small - scale microturbulent velocities are subsonic in the stellar photosphere and become highly supersonic in the chromosphere .",
