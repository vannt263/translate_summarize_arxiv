    "the first generation of large - scale laser - interferometric gravitational wave detectors @xcite is now in operation and collects data of impressive sensitivity and bandwidth .",
    "the optical configurations of these kilometer long gravitational wave observatories are based on a michelson interferometer",
    ". moreover , the standard configuration , implemented in the three ligo interferometers as well as in virgo and tama300 , employs cavities in the arms of the interferometer and power - recycling to increase the storage time of the light inside the interferometer . in order to get an optimal power increase inside the arm cavities ,",
    "these are kept to be resonant for the carrier light .",
    "however , as we show in this article , detuning these arm cavities by a few hundred hz has the advantage of a larger signal gain in a certain frequency band and might therefore be favorable .",
    "in section [ sec : principle ] we give a brief and intuitive description of the principle of an optical configuration employing detuned arm cavities . using a idealized interferometer as an example we show in section [ sec : simulation ]",
    "that with detuned arm cavities the shot noise limited sensitivity can , in a certain frequency range , be increased using the same optical power circulating in the arm cavities as in the case of tuned arm cavities . in section [ sec : rse ] we compare the interferometer response with detuned arm cavities to a configuration using in addition the advanced technology of resonant sideband extraction ( rse ) .",
    "the potential benefit of using detuned arm cavities for ligo is evaluated by simulations described in section [ sec : real_ligo ] .",
    "finally we give a summary and an outlook in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "figure [ layouts ] a ) shows a simplified schematic of the initial ligo optical layout .",
    "the red and the dark blue lines indicate in which part of the interferometer carrier light ( red ) and gravitational wave signal sidebands ( dark blue ) are present .",
    "the carrier light enters the interferometer through the power recycling mirror ( prm ) and is split by the beam splitter ( bs ) in equal shares into the x and y arm . the arms consist of an arm cavity each , formed by two mirrors separated by 4 km ( itx and etx , ity and ety ) .",
    "these arm cavities are chosen to be resonant for the carrier light resulting in a larger power enhancement inside .",
    "the small michelson interferometer formed by bs , ity and itx is kept on a dark fringe , thus no carrier light is leaving the interferometer towards the output port , but all light is going back to the input port so that it becomes further resonantly enhanced by prm .",
    "the presence of a gravitational wave produces phase modulation sidebands around the carrier light . because the signal sidebands in the two perpendicular arms have opposite phase they can interfere constructively at the bs to leave the interferometer at the output port . with the arm cavities being set on resonance for the carrier light , the signal sidebands of interest ( @xmath0hz ) experience less enhancement than the carrier light .",
    "a new concept that turns this principle around is to use detuned arm cavities as shown in figure [ layouts ] c ) .",
    "in contrast to the conventional initial ligo scheme the length of the arm cavities was chosen to be resonant for a specific single - sided signal sideband frequency , i.e. the cavities are detuned from the carrier frequency .",
    "this detuning can easiest be realized by shifting ety and etx in common mode either to shorten or to lengthen the arm cavities , corresponding to making them resonant for the upper and the lower signal sideband , respectively .",
    "the operating points of the other main mirrors ( itx , ity , and bs ) do not need to be changed",
    ". the obvious drawback of this scheme , in the following referred to as _ detuned arm cavities _ , is the lower optical power inside the arms , compared to arm cavities resonant for the carrier light .",
    "however , the achievable circulating power in current detectors is not limited by the available laser power nor the finesse of the arm cavities .",
    "instead technical problems , like , for example , thermal lensing or parametric instabilities , become limiting factors when the circulating light power is increased @xcite",
    ". therefore we belief it useful to compare the concept of detuned arm cavities to resonant arm cavities with identical stored optical power .",
    "in order to evaluate the benefit from detuning the arm cavities and resonantly enhancing the gravitational wave signal sideband we performed numerical simulations of the shot noise limited sensitivity using the finesse software @xcite . as an example we have chosen an idealized and simplified michelson interferometer with power - recycling employing tuned and detuned arm cavities of 4 km length . to simplify the simulation of shot noise ,",
    "a dc - readout scheme was used .",
    "table [ ligo_tab ] gives a summary of the simulation : with an input power of 4w a circulating light power of 10kw is achieved in each arm cavity .",
    "the corresponding shot noise limited displacement sensitivity of such a configuration with arm cavities resonant for the carrier light is shown in figure [ initial ] ( green solid trace ) .",
    ".simulation of an ideal michelson interferometer with dc - readout .",

    "we have introduced a new concept that uses detuned arm cavities combined with a moderately increased power - recycling gain to increase the shot noise limited sensitivity of initial ligo for frequencies between 125 and 400hz , without increasing the light power inside the arm cavities .",
    "this concept is found to give a sensitivity similar to that of a conventional rse configuration with a srm of moderate reflectivity .",
    "the implementation of detuned arm cavities might require less new hardware than rse .",
    "this is a considerable advantage , however , further investigations and simulations should be performed to evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme with respect to noise couplings .",
    "we have chosen to validate the concept using the initial ligo configuration because the real parameters and performance of the running interferometers are well known . nevertheless , the same concept is applicable to these interferometers after the next upgrade : enhanced ligo .",
    "further investigations are required , however , to understand the technical limits to the circulating power in the arm cavities and the small michelson in a realistic enhanced ligo scenario ."
