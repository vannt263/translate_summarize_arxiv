    "monolithic active pixel based on soi technology has been proposed as an ultimate monolithic sensor approach for tracking detectors due to the fact that the sensor and front - end readout electronics with different requirements on silicon parameters can be integrated into a single chip @xcite .",
    "such a technology offers fabrication of devices with a large number of readout channels with fine segmentation at a small cost .",
    "the first prototypes of an soi - based maps were implemented with a fd - soi technology @xcite , in which the whole body under the transistor gate is completely depleted .",
    "unfortunately , the fd - soi process by principle suffers significantly from total ionizing dose ( tid ) effects @xcite .",
    "several ways have been investigated to mitigate this problem , such as extra isolating implants in the handling wafer , or the use of double soi wafers@xcite .",
    "a new commercial hv - soi process @xcite , that mitigates the back gate effect problem , is being investigated .",
    "this process offers n- and p - well structures for active layers , which creates an additional isolation layer between box and the active circuitry making transistor parameters insensitive to radiation effects in the box .    0.4     0.4     to evaluate the process , we designed the prototype chip `` xtb01 '' , which includes simple diode and readout electronics . in this article , the concept and measurement results of the prototype chip implemented with this technology are presented .",

    "the inactive layer underneath box ( handling wafer ) can be used as a depleted sensor layer .",
    "the main difference of thick - film soi technology is that the active ( transistor ) layer is thick ( few  @xmath0 m ) compared to tens of nm in case of fd - soi .",
    "multiple biased well structures give the possibility to isolate the transistor from any influence of charge build - up in the box .",
    "both technologies allow access to the handling wafer to create a charge collecting diode and bias .",
    "a standard cmos circuit can be realized in the active layer .",
