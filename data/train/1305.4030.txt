    "in studying the nonlinear dynamics of delayed reaction - diffusion systems , one of the important topics is the existence of traveling wave solutions because of their significant roles in biological invasion and epidemic spreading , we refer to ai @xcite , gourley and ruan @xcite , fang and wu @xcite , faria et al .",

    "it has been shown that delay may induce some differences of traveling wave solutions between the delayed and undelayed systems , for example , the minimal wave speed ( see schaaf @xcite , zou @xcite ) and the monotonicity of traveling wave solutions in scalar equations ( see an example in faria and trofimchuk @xcite )",
    ". in particular , the asymptotic behavior of traveling wave solutions , which is often formulated by the asymptotic boundary conditions , plays a very crucial role since it describes the propagation processes in different natural environments .",
    "for example , with proper asymptotic boundary value conditions , the traveling wave solutions of two species diffusive competition systems may reflect the coinvasion - coexistence of two invaders ( see ahmad and lazer @xcite , li et al .",
    "@xcite , lin et al .",
    "@xcite , tang and fife @xcite ) , or exclusion between an invader and a resident ( see gourley and ruan @xcite , huang @xcite ) . therefore , understanding the asymptotic behavior is a fundamental issue in the study of traveling wave solutions .",
    "moreover , very detailed asymptotic behavior of traveling wave solutions has also been studied due to the development in mathematical theory of delayed reaction - diffusion systems , such as in the asymptotic stability and uniqueness of traveling wave solutions ( see mei et al .",
    "@xcite , volpert et al .",
    "@xcite , wang et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    to obtain the asymptotic behavior of traveling wave solutions in delayed reaction - diffusion systems ,",
    "there are several methods .",
    "the first is based on the monotonicity of traveling wave solutions , which is often considered under the assumption of quasimonotonicity in the sense of proper ordering ( huang and zou @xcite , ma @xcite , wang et al .",
    "@xcite , wu and zou @xcite ) .",
    "the second is to construct proper auxiliary functions , such as the upper and lower solutions ( li et al .",
    "@xcite , lin et al .",
    "when these methods fail , a fluctuation technique is utilized to study the asymptotic behavior of traveling wave solutions if the system satisfies the locally quasimonotone condition near the unstable steady state ( ma @xcite , wang @xcite ) .",
    "some other results have also been presented for ( fast ) traveling wave solutions of scalar equations ( faria and trofimchuk @xcite , kwong and ou @xcite ) .",
    "of course , before considering the asymptotic behavior of traveling wave solutions of delayed systems , we must establish the existence of nontrivial traveling wave solutions . to obtain the existence of traveling wave solutions of delayed systems , wu and",
    "zou @xcite used a monotone iteration scheme if a delayed system is cooperative in the sense of proper ordering , see also ma @xcite .",
    "@xcite further considered the existence of traveling wave solutions in competition systems by a cross iteration technique . very recently , ma @xcite studied the traveling wave solutions of a locally monotone delayed equation by constructing auxiliary monotone equations , see also wang @xcite , yi et al .",
    "moreover , by regarding the time delay as a parameter , the existence of traveling wave solutions was also studied by the perturbation method or banach fixed point theorem , see gourley and ruan @xcite , ou and wu @xcite .    in this paper , we first study the existence and asymptotic behavior of traveling wave solutions in the following delayed reaction - diffusion system @xmath0 where @xmath1 @xmath2 are positive constants , @xmath3 $ ] and @xmath4 is the time delay , therefore , @xmath5 , \\mathbb{r}^n)\\to \\mathbb{r},$ ] here @xmath6 , \\mathbb{r}^n)$ ] is the space of continuous functions defined on @xmath7 $ ] and valued in @xmath8 which is a banach space equipped with the supremum norm .    to overcome the difficulty arising from the deficiency of comparison principle",
    ", we introduce the definition of generalized upper and lower solutions of the corresponding wave system of delayed system . by using schauder s fixed point theorem ,",
    "the existence of traveling wave solutions is reduced to the existence of generalized upper and lower solutions .",
    "motivated by the idea of contracting rectangles in evolutionary systems , we establish an abstract conclusion on the asymptotic behavior of positive traveling wave solutions in general partial functional differential equations .",
    "subsequently , we consider two scalar delayed equations with diffusion in population dynamics ( see ma @xcite and zou @xcite ) , which implies that our methods can also be applied to some well studied models .    in population dynamics , the following lotka - volterra reaction - diffusion system with distributed delay has been widely studied @xmath9 ,   \\label{1}\\ ] ] in which @xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath12 @xmath13 denotes the density of the @xmath14th competitor at time @xmath15 and in location @xmath16 @xmath17 and @xmath18 are constants for @xmath19 we also suppose that @xmath20 \\text { and } \\overline{\\eta } _ { ij}(0)-\\overline{\\eta } _ { ij}(-\\tau)=1,\\ ] ] which will be imposed throughout the paper .",

    "the dynamics of has been studied by several authors , for example , gourley and ruan @xcite , fang and wu @xcite , li et al .",
    "@xcite , lin et al .",
    "@xcite , martin and smith @xcite and ruan and wu @xcite .",
    "more precisely , when @xmath24 is a bounded domain and is equipped with the neumann boundary condition , martin and smith @xcite proved that if the initial values of are positive and @xmath25 then the unique mild solution to satisfies @xmath26 hereafter @xmath27 is the unique spatially homogeneous positive steady state of , of which the existence can be obtained by .",
    "it is well known that @xmath28 implies the existence of time delay in intra - specific competition , which often leads to some significant differences between the dynamics of delayed and undelayed models if the time delay is large .",
    "for example , the following logistic and hutchinson equations @xmath29 exhibit dramatically different dynamics , we refer to ruan @xcite for detailed analysis on these two equations and hale and verduyn lunel @xcite and wu @xcite for fundamental theories on delayed equations .",
    "however , does not depend on the size of delays and the distribution of @xmath30 for @xmath31 .",
    "similar phenomena can be founded in the corresponding functional differential equations , see smith ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 5.7 ) .    in particular , li et al . @xcite and lin et al .",
    "@xcite have established the existence of traveling wave solutions to , which models the invasion - coexistence scenario of multiple competitors .",
    "however , these results only hold if there exists @xmath32 $ ] small enough satisfying @xmath33 which ensures the so - called exponentially monotone condition such that the upper and lower solutions are admissible .",
    "if @xmath34 is large , then we can not apply these techniques and results to study the existence and asymptotic behavior of traveling wave solutions of . in this paper",

    "using the results on the existence and asymptotic behavior of traveling wave solutions in system , model with @xmath36 is studied by presenting the existence , nonexistence and asymptotic behavior of positive traveling wave solutions . in particular ,",
    "due to less requirements for auxiliary functions , we obtain some sufficient conditions on the existence of nonmonotone traveling wave solutions of with @xmath37 . note that these conclusions remain true if @xmath38 we thus confirm the conjecture about the existence of nonmonotone traveling wave solutions of competitive systems , which was proposed by tang and fife ( * ? ? ?",

    "the investigation of traveling wave solutions of delayed systems is also more difficult than that of the corresponding undelayed systems , at least the phase plane method which is powerful in studying undelayed systems meets some difficulties in the study of delayed systems .    of course",

    "if the system is not quasimonotone , then the study becomes harder and some new phenomena can occur , e.g. , the existence of nonmonotone traveling wave solutions in scalar equations , see faria and trofimchuk @xcite .",

    "@xcite , and wu and zou @xcite .    however , if the delay is large , these techniques can not deal with the traveling wave solutions of delayed systems including and . in this paper , we applied generalized upper and lower solutions to seek after the positive traveling wave solutions .",

    "our results imply that if there exists instantaneous self - limitation effect , then the _ large delays _ appearing in the intra - specific competition terms may not affect the persistence of traveling wave solutions .",
