    "stimulated by the experimental developments in the fields of ultracold gases and of nanosystems like quantum dots , non - equilibrium phenomena in interacting many - particle systems are a fascinating field of current research . in the theoretical treatment , a number of conceptual and methodological problems arise .",
    "some are related to the facts that many interesting phenomena are not perturbatively accessible even in equilibrium , and that moreover the limit of a perturbation being small does not necessarily commute with the long - time limit .",
    "consequently , the majority of works on non - equilibrium physics in interacting systems rely on numerical methods . however ,",
    "those come with their own complications , and analytically tractable test cases are desirable .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to provide one such test case : we shall study the non - equilibrium spin dynamics in the ferromagnetic kondo model , described by the hamiltonian @xmath0 \\label{h1}\\ ] ] in standard notation , with @xmath1 and @xmath2 being the components of the impurity spin and the conduction electron spin density at the impurity site , and @xmath3 , @xmath4 the exchange couplings , with @xmath5 .",
    "this model has the advantage that its equilibrium physics is well understood and can be accessed by perturbative methods , although bare perturbation theory needs to be re - summed using renormalization group ( rg ) techniques .",
    "here we shall be interested in the decay of a spin prepared in a pure state , say @xmath6 , after the coupling to the bath is switched on at a time @xmath7 . to make controlled calculations , we shall focus on the case of small kondo couplings @xmath8 , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the conduction - electron bandwidth . while the equilibrium physics of eq .",
    "is that of an asymptotically free spin , the non - equilibrium problem is far from trivial .",
    "in particular , it is not obvious whether the expectation value @xmath11 relaxes to zero : the equilibrium flow of the spin - flip coupling towards zero is slow ( i.e. logarithmic ) , which suggests that spin - flip events occur even at long times . in case the spin relaxes to a non - zero value , the follow - up question is whether this value is identical to the equilibrium expectation value @xmath12 obtained in the presence of an infinitesimal magnetic field .    in order to tackle this problem",
    ", we shall employ a non - equilibrium extension of the flow - equation method , originally developed by wegner @xcite and independently  in the field of high energy physics  by gazek and wilson . @xcite for equilibrium settings , this method utilizes continuous unitary transformations to successively eliminate off - diagonal terms in the hamiltonian , starting from the highest energies . although somewhat similar in spirit to rg techniques , the flow - equation method has the advantage of diagonalizing , instead of eliminating , the high - energy part of the hamiltonian , such that the entire system is described at any stage of the transformation .",
    "the flow - equation method can be efficiently employed to describe the non - equilibrium time evolution of observables:@xcite the hamiltonian is unitarily transformed into a diagonal form , together with the observables of interest . in this representation , the time evolution can be determined exactly . finally , the result is transformed back using the inverse of the flow - equation transformation . in this way , the accumulation of errors in the long - time limit is prohibited , and secular terms do not occur . in refs .",
    ", this method was applied to dissipative quantum impurity models , namely the dissipative harmonic oscillator and the ohmic spin - boson model , and excellent agreement with available analytical and numerical results was obtained .      in the following ,",
    "we summarize our main results obtained in the limit of weak coupling , distinguishing the cases of isotropic and anisotropic kondo couplings .",
    "most importantly , in both cases the relaxation of @xmath13 as @xmath14 is neither to zero nor to the equilibrium value @xmath12 . instead",
    ", the asymptotic value is given by @xmath15 , i.e. , the spin polarization is reduced twice as much compared to the equilibrium case .",
    "the initial ( short - time ) decay of @xmath13 is set by @xmath4 ( independent of @xmath16 ) , @xmath17$].@xcite in the isotropic case , the long - time decay towards the asymptotic value is logarithmic , @xmath18 .",
    "in contrast , for anisotropic couplings with @xmath19 the logarithms in the long - time limit are replaced by power laws , @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the dimensionless fixed - point value of @xmath22 .",
    "these results do not come unexpected , considerung the equilibrium rg flow for the ferromagnetic kondo problem , which is characterized by logarithmic ( power - law ) flow in the isotropic ( anisotropic ) case .",
    "below , we shall give explicit expressions for @xmath13 for all times , eqs .   and  , and discuss in detail their evaluation in both the short - time and long - time limits .",
    "our work adresses both recent methodological developments and fundamental theoretical questions .",
    "applications of the flow - equation approach to interaction quenches in quantum many - body systems have been applied in several recent works studying dissipative quantum systems @xcite and interaction quenches in the hubbard model.@xcite these works relied on either numerical implementations or analytical approximations restricted to finite time scales .",
    "previous numerical results exist for the real - time dynamics of the _ antiferromagnetic _ kondo model , which has also been treated with the flow equation method @xcite .",
    "the ferromagnetic kondo model has been discussed numerically with the time - dependent numerical renormalization group ( td - nrg ) method @xcite at finite temperatures @xcite or in the context of the underscreened kondo effect.@xcite these works did not identify the asymptotic long - time behaviour of this problem at @xmath23 .",
    "this behaviour has been adressed by a comparison of the flow equation approach and the td - nrg in a recent letter.@xcite the asymptotic long - time tails have been clarified by the analytical asymptotics of the flow - equation approach , to be described in more detail in the present paper , and the numerical implementation of the td - nrg .",
    "relaxation of an impurity spin in a host model was already discussed by langreth and wilkins,@xcite who developed a theory of spin resonance in dilute magnetic alloys . based on the kadanoff - baym approach",
    ", these authors derived bloch - like equations for the paramagnetic resonance , which predict a relaxation of the disturbed magnetizations to the instantaneous local equilibrium magnetization .",
    "our work differs in predicting a relaxation towards a local non - equilibrium magnetization under slightly different conditions than considered by langreth and wilkins .",
    "a perturbative expansion of kadanoff - baym equations as used by langreth and wilkins would fail to reproduce our result , since bare perturbation theory can not reproduce our asymptotic long - time relaxation laws .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",

    "a brief account of our results has been published in ref .  , together with a comparison to numerical data obtained by the td - nrg method .",
    "several interesting features of the non - equilibrium processes governed by the ferromagnetic kondo model can be captured by a simple exactly solvable toy model consisting of two fermion levels coupled to a spin @xmath24 impurity spin @xmath25 through an @xmath26-symmetric exchange coupling : @xmath27 due to the finite hilbert space the real time evolution problem for an arbitrary initial state becomes exactly solvable .",
    "specifically we look at @xmath28 , where @xmath29 denotes an unoccupied c - electron level state @xmath30 , a doubly occupied d - electron level state @xmath31 and the spin - up state @xmath32 of the impurity spin .",
    "notice that @xmath33 is the ground state of @xmath34 , where @xmath35 shall cause an infinitesimal zeeman splitting .",
    "later we will generalize the initial state to be a product state of a fermi sea with the impurity spin - up state for the dynamics generated by the actual ferromagnetic kondo model .",
    "in our toy model we now investigate how the spin expectation value deviates from its initial value at time @xmath36 due to the dynamics generated by ( [ toy ] ) , that is we study the observable @xmath37 let us denote the exact eigenstates of @xmath38 with eigenenergies @xmath39 by @xmath40 .",
    "their explicit construction is shown in appendix  [ toyalgebra ] , in fact one just needs to diagonalize a @xmath41-matrix .",
    "since the initial state @xmath33 is not an exact eigenstate , the expectation value of @xmath42 acquires a time dependence given by @xmath43 where we have used the decomposition @xmath44 . for an examplary case @xmath45",

    "[ toyratio ] is the universal value  2 in the weak - coupling limit .",
    "the universality of this result is guaranteed by a theorem proven in ref .",

    "let @xmath59 be the ground state of @xmath60 and @xmath61 be the ground state of  @xmath38 .",
    "let @xmath42 be an observable that commutes with @xmath60 and which annihilates @xmath59 . then @xmath62 one can easily verify that the conditions of this theorem are met in our toy model if we take @xmath63 with infinitesimal @xmath35 . in appendix  [ toyalgebra ]",
    "we show explicitly how this theorem comes about in our simple toy model .",
    "again we will find that this universal factor  2 between the time - averaged expectation value in the time - evolved initial state and the equilibrium ground state also holds in the weak - coupling limit of the ferromagnetic kondo model .",
    "in this section , we summarize the equilibrium properties of the ferromagnetic kondo model which are relevant for the subsequent discussion .",
    "we then explain in some detail the flow - equation treatment of the model , which shall be used in secs .",
    "[ realtime ] and [ analytical ] to calculate the non - equilibrium magnetization .",
    "the kondo hamiltonian , eq .",
    ", can be re - written as @xmath64 here , @xmath65 , and the conduction electron spin density is given by @xmath66 where @xmath67 derive from the pauli matrices . the anisotropic exchange couplings @xmath68 and @xmath69 usually describe scattering on an isotropic fermi surface , and their momentum dependence can then be safely neglected . in physical results ,",
    "they enter proportional to the density of states at the fermi surface ( @xmath70 ) , thus we define the dimensionless couplings @xmath71 and @xmath72 .      the important difference between the ferromagnetic and the antiferromagnetic regime of the kondo model can be understood from anderson s poor man s scaling analysis.@xcite in this approach , the band width of the conduction electrons is progressively reduced by a flowing cutoff energy @xmath73 and the renormalized interactions due to the elimination of virtual excitations to the band edges are calculated perturbatively .",
    "as shown by anderson , this procedure leads to the scaling equations @xmath74 where the scaling trajectory for ferromagnetic couplings with @xmath75 is given by the conserved quantity @xmath76 .    for antiferromagnetic couplings ,",
    "more precisely for @xmath77 or @xmath78 , the rg flow is driven to strong coupling , i.e. , @xmath79 and @xmath80 , and the scaling equations have no low - energy fixed point at finite coupling . on the level of perturbation theory ,",
    "logarithmic divergencies @xmath81 occur at low temperatures .",
    "in contrast , in the ferromagnetic kondo model with @xmath5 , the perturbative renormalization of the coupling constant remains controlled in the limit @xmath82 since the coupling monotonously renormalizes to a finite value @xmath83 in the limit @xmath84 . at @xmath23 and for anisotropic couplings ,",
    "the longitudinal coupling remains finite and the transverse coupling renormalizes to zero according to the power - law @xmath85 . in the isotropic case ,",
    "both couplings logarithmically renormalize to zero following @xmath86 , and the impurity becomes asymptotically free at low energies .",
    "this important property makes it possible to use the flow equation renormalization scheme in a perturbatively controlled manner in the following .",
    "let us briefly review the basic ideas of the flow - equation approach ( for more details see ref . ) .",

    "general conditions the choice of the canonical generator leads to an increasingly energy - diagonal hamiltonian @xmath93 , where interaction matrix elements with energy transfer  @xmath94 decay like @xmath95 . for @xmath96",
    "the hamiltonian will be energy - diagonal and we denote parameters and operators in this basis by  @xmath97 , e.g. @xmath98 .",
    "the key problem of the flow equation approach is generically the generation of higher order interaction terms in eq .",
    "( [ eqdhdb ] ) , which makes it necessary to truncate the scheme in some order of a suitable systematic expansion parameter ( usually the running coupling constant ) .",
    "still , the differential nature of the approach makes it possible to deal with a continuum of energy scales and to describe non - perturbative effects .",
    "this has led to numerous applications of the flow - equation method where one utilizes the fact that the hilbert space is not truncated as opposed to conventional scaling methods .",
    "the forward - backward transformation scheme induces a non - perturbative solution of the heisenberg equations of motion for an operator .",
    "@xmath99 denotes the full unitary transformation that relates the @xmath100 to the @xmath101 basis.@xcite , width=120 ]    in refs .",
    ", these features have been utilized to treat the real - time evolution of observables under non - equilibrium conditions .",
    "the general setup is described by the diagram in fig .",
    "[ figrealtimefeq ] , where @xmath102 is some non - thermal initial state whose time evolution one is interested in . however , instead of following its full time evolution it is more convenient to study the real time evolution of a given observable @xmath103 that one is interested in .",
    "this is done by transforming the observable into the diagonal basis in fig .",
    "[ figrealtimefeq ] ( forward transformation ) : @xmath104 \\label{observable}\\ ] ] with the initial condition @xmath105 .",
    "the central observation is that one can now solve the real time evolution with respect to the energy - diagonal @xmath106 exactly , thereby avoiding any errors that grow proportional to time ( i.e. , secular terms ) : this yields @xmath107 .",
    "now since the initial quantum state is given in the @xmath108 basis , one undoes the basis change by integrating eq .",
    "( [ observable ] ) from @xmath96 to @xmath108 ( backward transformation ) with the initial condition @xmath109 .",
    "one therefore effectively generates a new non - perturbative scheme for solving the heisenberg equations of motion for an operator , @xmath110 .",
    "it is a straightforward calculation to apply the flow equation technique in the outlined manner to the ferromagnetic kondo hamiltonian.@xcite for the sake of simplicity , we consider the case of @xmath111 here and give a generalization to arbitrary spin @xmath112 in appendix  [ highs ] . to start with",

    "this sum rule can be easily proven by differentiating it with respect to @xmath149 and inserting the flow equations ( [ feqsz ] ) .",
    "since a ferromagnetically coupled kondo spin is asymptotically free at low energies , its equilibrium properties are only perturbatively renormalized in comparison to a free spin . in the case of isotropic couplings , it has been shown by abrikosov and migdal  @xcite by diagrammatic means that for general spin quantum number @xmath112 the equilibrium magnetization of the impurity ( @xmath158 ) in a magnetic field @xmath149 , caused by the zeeman term @xmath159 is renormalized to one - loop order as @xmath160 here , we introduced @xmath161 with the fermi energy @xmath162 , the gyromagnetic ratio @xmath163 of the impurity and the bohr magneton @xmath164 .",
    "spin - flip scattering effectively reduces the magnetization but is not able to screen the spin completely .",
