    "bilayer quantum hall systems at total landau level filling factor @xmath0 , i.e.  @xmath6 in each layer @xcite , allow for novel interlayer coherent phases .",
    "these phases have attracted a great deal of theoretical and experimental attention @xcite over the last sixteen years , dating back to a seminal paper by halperin @xcite , in which the multicomponent generalization of the laughlin wavefunction was first considered in a rather general context . in particular , there is strong experimental evidence @xcite and compelling theoretical basis @xcite to believe that a spin - polarized bilayer @xmath7 quantum hall system would have a novel spontaneous interlayer coherent incompressible phase for small values of the interlayer separation @xmath3 , even in the absence of interlayer tunneling .",
    "( we consider only the situation without any interlayer tunneling in this paper  our considerations also apply to the physical situation with weak interlayer tunneling .",
    "the situation with strong interlayer tunneling is trivial by virtue of the tunneling - induced symmetric - antisymmetric single - particle tunneling gap which leads to the usual @xmath0 quantum hall state in the symmetric band . ) in the limit @xmath8 , however , one expects two decoupled layers , each with @xmath7 , and hence no quantized hall state .",
    "the phase diagram for this compressible to incompressible quantum phase transition in @xmath7 bilayer systems has been studied extensively in the literature @xcite , but we still do not have a complete qualitative understanding of the detailed nature of this transition .",
    "in particular , one does not know how different kinds of incompressible ( and compressible ) phases compete as system parameters ( e.g. @xmath3 ) are tuned , and how to distinguish among possible competing incompressible phases . in this paper",
    ", we revisit this issue by arguing that , in principle , there are several interesting and nontrivial quantum hall phases in the @xmath0 bilayer system which could be systematically probed via interlayer drag experiments carried out at various values of the interlayer separation @xmath3 .",
    "one goal of our paper is to describe and discuss the rich @xmath0 bilayer quantum hall phase diagram using the chern - simons landau - ginzburg approach @xcite .    among the more interesting quantum hall phases are the so - called paired hall states , which have been extensively studied theoretically @xcite . in these states ,",
    "the composite fermions form a superconducting paired state in which two composite fermions bind into effective cooper pairs which condense into a ground state analogous to the bcs state .",
    "the well - studied moore - read pfaffian state @xcite is a spin - polarized version of such a paired hall state for a single layer system .",
    "bilayer paired hall states have been discussed earlier in the literature in the context of @xmath7 ( and @xmath9 systems ) , but no definitive idea has emerged regarding their experimental observability or their relation to the more intensively studied ( and robust ) @xmath5 state @xcite .",
    "the main purpose of the current paper is to critically discuss the possible existence of paired @xmath7 bilayer hall states which , we argue , are distinguishable from the better - studied @xmath5 incompressible state ( as well as from compressible states ) through interlayer drag experiments .",
    "the transitions between these states are described by a variety of landau - ginzburg theories . given the great current interest @xcite in the physics of @xmath7 bilayer systems , we believe that the results presented in this paper could shed considerable light on the nature of the possible quantum phase transitions in bilayer systems .    in sections ii , iii , and iv of this paper , we consider the possible bilayer @xmath7 quantum hall phases in the parameter regimes @xmath10 ( section ii ) , @xmath11 ( section iii ) , and @xmath12 ( section iv ) , where @xmath13 is the magnetic length , which sets the scale for intralayer correlations .",
    "we argue that the likely ground states in these three regimes are , respectively , compressible ( fermi - liquid - like ) states ( @xmath10 ) , paired hall states ( @xmath11 ) , and @xmath5 states ( @xmath14 ) . in section v , we discuss the transition between the @xmath11 and @xmath12 limits , and introduce yet another state , a hierarchical descendent of the ( 3,3,-1 ) state with interlayer coherence .",
    "we conclude in section vi with a critical discussion of the various drag resistivities which we argue can , in principle , distinguish among these phases and could be used to study bilayer quantum phase transitions experimentally .",
    "let us consider a bilayer system in which each layer has filling factor @xmath6 in the limit that the layer separation @xmath3 is much larger than the typical interparticle spacing , which is of the order of the magnetic length @xmath16 . as a starting point , we will model the system by two almost independent fermi - liquid - like compressible states , one in each layer .",
    "there are two alternative and complementary descriptions of compressible states at even - denominator filling fractions .",
    "we will briefly recapitulate some features of both , as they will inform the following discussion of paired states .",
    "one description of a fermi - liquid - like compressible state at @xmath6 is based on the lowest landau level wavefunction @xcite : @xmath17 where @xmath18 has the matrix elements @xmath19 . here , @xmath20 is the position of electron @xmath21 .",
    "the @xmath22s are parameters which are chosen so that the total energy of the system is minimized",
    ". we will discuss their interpretation below .",
    "@xmath23 projects states into the lowest landau level ; it has the following action @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 are the guiding center coordinates of the electrons .",
    "the corresponding wavefunction of the double - layer system at @xmath0 can be written as @xmath26 where @xmath27 label the two layers .",
    "the lowest landau level constraint and fermi statistics displace the electrons from the correlation holes ",
    "i.e. zeroes of the wavefunction or , equivalently , vortices represented by the @xmath28 factor in the wavefunction .",
    "the @xmath29 factor is necessary to ensure fermi statistics ; it is a displacement operator @xcite because @xmath30 acts as @xmath31 in the lowest landau level .",
    "thus the composite fermion made of an electron and two correlation holes has a dipolar structure .",
    "using these ideas , the system can be described as a collection of dipolar ` composite fermions ' in which each dipolar fermion consists of an electron and the corresponding correlation holes @xcite . to each composite fermion",
    "we assign a @xmath22 which is equal in magnitude ( in units of @xmath16 ) and perpendicular to the displacement between the electron and its correlation holes . by fermi statistics ,",
    "the @xmath22s must be distinct .",
    "the structure of a dipolar composite fermion is given schematically in fig.1 .",
    "the energy of a composite fermion increases with @xmath22 , so the ground state is a filled fermi sea in @xmath32-space . in the long wavelength limit",
    ", the total energy of these dipolar composite fermions can be approximately written as @xmath33 with effective mass @xmath34 which is determined by the interaction potential @xcite .",
    "an alternative formulation arises from the observation that an electron may be represented by a ` composite fermion ' together with a chern - simons gauge field which attaches two fictitious flux quanta to each fermion @xcite .",
    "this representation is mathematically equivalent to the original one , but it naturally suggests another approximation .",
    "the composite fermions see zero average magnetic field due to the cancellation between the external magnetic field and the average fictitious magnetic field coming from the fictitious flux quanta .",
    "consequently , the system can be described as an almost free ( composite ) fermion system in zero effective magnetic field . in this approach ,",
    "the fictitious flux quanta are introduced to represent the phase winding of the electron wavefunction around correlation holes associated with the positions of other electrons .",
    "the @xmath35 $ ] factor in ( [ eqn : rr_wavefcn ] ) can be interpreted as the wavefunction of the almost free composite fermion system .",
    "@xcite then @xmath22s can be regarded as the `` kinetic momenta '' of the composite fermions . in the long - wavelength , low - frequency limit ,",
    "the two formulations are equivalent .",
    "= 1.2 in    note that in addition to the fermi - liquid - like @xmath6 compressible state in each layer one could have , in principle , other compressible states ( e.g.  cdw or wigner crystal ) in the @xmath10 limit depending on the details of interaction and landau - level coupling . in addition , strong disorder will lead to localized insulating states .",
    "we do not consider these possibilities in this paper .",
    "we will now implement the latter formulation in a double - layer system , and show that the compressible state has a strong pairing instability @xcite .",

    ", we see that @xmath52 and @xmath53 have the same gauge `` charges '' for @xmath54 , but opposite gauge `` charges '' for @xmath55 . as a result",
    ", there will be an attractive interaction between the composite fermions in different layers via @xmath56 and a repulsive interaction via @xmath57 .",
    "composite fermions in the same layer have repulsive interactions . as a result of coulomb intractions ,",
    "the attractive interaction mediated by the @xmath58 gauge field dominates in the low energy limit and there exists a pairing instability between the composite fermions in different layers .",
    "this result can be understood in physical terms as follows .",
    "the @xmath56 and @xmath57 fields represent antisymmetric and symmetric density fluctuations . in the presence of coulomb interactions , symmetric density fluctuations",
    "are highly suppressed , but antisymmetric density fluctuations can still be large . as a result , the dynamic density fluctuations in the antisymmetric channel becomes more important in the low energy limit and lead to a pairing instability .",
    "this pairing instability has a natural explanation in the dipolar composite fermion picture @xcite .",
    "let us take a dipolar composite fermion in layer @xmath59 with wavevector @xmath60 and a dipolar composite fermion in layer @xmath61 with wavevector @xmath62 . as seen in fig .  2 , this configuration can lower the interlayer coulomb energy because the electron in layer @xmath59 and the vortex in layer @xmath61 can sit on top of each other and vice versa .",
    "= 1.4 in    this analysis predicts that , at least in principle , the fermi - liquid - like compressible state is always unstable to pairing . in practice , the pairing gap will be small in the limit @xmath63 and easily destroyed by disorder . as a result , we expect the pairing instability discussed above to be relevant for @xmath64 not too small .",
    "when @xmath64 become small , on the other hand , the starting point of two decoupled compressible states is no longer sensible , and we take a different starting point , as described in later sections .    the wavefunction of the paired quantum hall state constructed in this way can be written as @xmath65 where @xmath66 \\cr & \\equiv & { \\cal a } [ f(z_1 , z_2 ; \\uparrow , \\downarrow ) f(z_3 , z_4 ; \\uparrow , \\downarrow ) \\cdots ] \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath67 is the pair wavefunction which depends on the symmetry of the pairing order parameter . @xmath68 $ ] denotes the pfaffian , which is defined in the second line , with @xmath69 $ ] denoting the antisymmetrized product .",
    "notice that @xmath70 can be regarded as the product of the wavefunction of the paired composite fermions and that of the ( 2,2,0 ) bosonic laughlin quantum hall state .",
    "it is not immediately clear what choice of @xmath71 is most favorable energetically . in the chern - simons theory of @xcite ,",
    "there is a pairing instability in all angular momentum channels @xcite . in a modified chern - simons theory ,",
    "it was claimed that the leading instability occurs in the @xmath72-wave channel @xcite .",
    "these approximate calculations do not necessarily capture the detailed energetics which determines the pairing symmetry .",
    "hence , we will not enter into a discussion of energetics , but limit ourselves to a discussion of the simplest ( and , therefore , likeliest ) possibilities .",

    "the two different choices of sp wavefunctions ( with @xmath72- and @xmath85-wave pairs , respectively ) in ( [ eqn : strong - pairing ] ) can be continuously connected without crossing a phase transition .",

    "= 1.4 in    however , this line of thinking appears to conflict with the conventional wisdom that a bilayer quantum hall system at @xmath94 is described by the @xmath5 state for @xmath95 @xcite .",

    "in other words , @xmath98 is the correct choice for @xmath95 .",
    "notice that this form of @xmath99 corresponds to the ( pseudo-)spin triplet @xmath73 pairing order parameter for the `` interlayer '' composite fermions . from this point of view , it is natural to have the same pairing symmetry ( [ eqn:(3,3,-1 ) ] ) for @xmath100 but for `` intralayer '' rather than `` interlayer '' composite fermions .",
    "in this section , we consider these states within the framework of chern - simons effective field theories @xcite , consider the nature of the transitions between them , and also find an additional state which is a hierarchical descendent of the ( 3,3,-1 ) state , described by a @xmath101 k - matrix .    the lagrangian of the @xmath5 state is : @xmath102 here @xmath103 and @xmath104 describe composite bosons and electromagnetic fields in the two layers , and the statistical gauge fields @xmath105 ensure the agreement between this lagrangian and the @xmath5 wavefunction . in the absence of interlayer tunneling ,",
    "the number of electrons in each layer is conserved , so we can use the dual description @xcite of the @xmath5 state : @xmath106 here @xmath107 describe vortices in the fields @xmath108 , with indices @xmath109 and @xmath110 labeling the layers @xmath59 and @xmath61 , the dual gauge fields @xmath111 describe the conserved currents , the latin indices @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 include space and time components , and the gram ( or k-)matrix @xcite is @xmath115    it is also convenient to define the charge and spin gauge fields @xmath116 , @xmath117 with charge and spin vectors @xmath118 and @xmath119 , and @xmath120 , @xmath121 . here and henceforth , we use the term ` spin ' to refer to the charge difference between the two layers , not the physical spin of the electrons , which is assumed to be fully polarized ( i.e.  spin here refers to an pseudospin associated with the layers ) .    a generic quasiparticle",
    "may now be constructed by taking a composite of @xmath122 vortices of type @xmath123 and @xmath124 vortices of type @xmath125 .",
    "@xmath126 creates such a quasiparticle , which has charge @xmath127 and spin @xmath121 @xmath128 if the @xmath129-matrix has vanishing determinant , as it does in ( [ eqn : k-(1,1,1 ) ] ) , then equation ( [ eqn : charge , spin ] ) will have to be modified .",
    "when this occurs , the zero eigenvalue corresponds to the goldstone modes associated with some broken continuous symmetry .",
    "hence , if we are to use the k - matrix formalism to calculate the quasiparticle properties and the degeneracy of the ground states on a torus ( usually the degeneracy is @xmath130 @xcite ) , some sort of reduced k - matrix will be required .",
    "we will now describe how this can be done in general .",
    "it is helpful to think in terms of the vectors in the condensate lattice @xcite ; the k - matrix is the gram matrix of the lattice , that is the matrix of inner products of a basis of vectors in the lattice .",
    "the inner product of two vectors @xmath131 , @xmath132 in the lattice , represented as column vectors of integers [ not to be confused with the similar vectors @xmath133 , which lie instead in the dual ( excitation ) lattice ] , is then given by @xmath134 .",
    "the vanishing determinant of @xmath129 implies that we can find a lattice vector @xmath132 such that @xmath135 .",
    "then the inner product of @xmath132 with _ any _ other vector , including itself , is zero ; we call @xmath132 a _ null vector_. we choose @xmath132 to be _ primitive _ , that is , not divisible by any integer larger than @xmath136 .",
    "two vectors that differ by an integer multiple of @xmath132 have the same inner product with any other vector , because @xmath132 is null .",
    "hence , we can obtain a reduced lattice , in which we identify vectors that differ by integer multiples of @xmath132 , and the inner product remains well - defined .",
    "the reduced lattice is the quotient of the previous one by @xmath137 . in terms of matrices ,",
    "the reduced k - matrix is obtained by changing basis @xcite , taking @xmath132 as one of the basis vectors .",
    "then in the resulting k - matrix , the entries in the row and column corresponding to @xmath132 are all zero .",
    "the reduced k - matrix , @xmath138 is obtained by deleting this row and column .",
    "the process can be repeated until either a nonzero determinant is obtained , or the lattice has dimension zero ; in our examples , a single reduction is sufficient .    in the case of the @xmath5 state",
    "above , the null vector is @xmath139 , and the reduced k - matrix is @xmath140 , the same as in the polarized or single - layer @xmath141 state .",
    "the physical meaning of the procedure is that the @xmath5 state is obtained by condensing composite bosons with pseudospin , or by taking a pseudospin - polarized state and tilting the pseudospins into the xy plane .",
    "this does not affect the quantum hall properties of the state , which remain those of the single layer @xmath141 state .",
    "the procedure above correctly accounts for disregarding the direction of the pseudospin , and implies that there is a single ground state on the torus , up to low - lying states associated with the broken symmetry .",
    "the use of the reduced k - matrix gives the quasiparticle properties ; the quasiparticles carry charge @xmath142 and are fermions .",
    "we see that the merons ( vortices in the pseudospin order parameter that carry charge @xmath143 and ill - defined statistics ) are not obtained from @xmath144 , but they are confined by the logarithmic potential between them , and can not be separated to infinity with finite energy .",
    "usually , the different degenerate ground states can be obtained from each other by creating a quasiparticle - quasihole pair , transporting one of them around the torus , and subsequently annihilating them .",
    "the nontrivial statistics ( abelian , in all cases in this paper ) of the quasiparticles then require degenerate ground states .",
    "since the merons are confined , they do not contribute to the count of ground states , and indeed , dragging one around the torus produces a helical texture in the ground state , increasing the energy by order width / length ; we do not regard such a state as a ground state .",
    "in general , the ground - state degeneracy is divisible by the denominator of the filling factor @xmath145 ( equal to @xmath136 here ) ; any ground - state degeneracy beyond that is not exact in a finite size system , but the energy splitting @xmath146 on a torus of size @xmath147 , where @xmath148 is a constant .",

    "the pseudospin sector is different from that of either of the other states : it is gapped  unlike @xmath5  and exhibits a pseudospin hall effect ( which is manifested in the hall drag resistance , as we discuss later ) , unlike @xmath5 and sp .",
    "the condensation of the neutral semion @xmath176 in ( [ ld - c - s-(3,3,-1 ) ] ) eliminates the peudospin gauge field @xmath152 by the anderson - higgs effect , thereby leading to the sp state .",
    "this is analogous to the situation at @xmath177 , where it was shown in @xcite that the transition between the @xmath178 and strong - pairing states is a second - order transition at which a dirac fermion becomes massless .",

    "however , similar arguments in the absence of a chern - simons term were not conclusive . that transition was argued to be first - order in @xmath181 dimensions @xcite , but @xmath182 duality @xcite implies that the transition is in the inverted @xmath170 universality class and , therefore , second order .",
    "therefore , the possibility that the transition in the presence of the chern - simons term is second order appears to be still open . in the presence of disorder , at any rate , the transition will be second order .",
    "we believe , therefore , that the @xmath183 bilayer quantum phase transition between the @xmath1 paired state and the sp state is a continuous phase transition .",
    "we may , on the other hand , consider the condensation of the boson @xmath184 upon the attachment of @xmath185 flux quanta : @xmath186 when @xmath187 condenses , the resulting meissner effect enforces the condition @xmath188 ( up to gauge transformations ) .",
    "hence , the following quantum hall state results : @xmath189 or , @xmath190 where @xmath191 , @xmath192 , @xmath193 , @xmath194 , and @xmath195 this state is a hierarchical descendent of the @xmath1 state ( though the construction differs from the usual hierarchy by condensing neutral quasiparticles , which does not change the filling factor ) . a wavefunction for it can be constructed along the lines of ref .",
    "when the number of flux quanta on the sphere is @xmath196 ( as in the @xmath1 state ) , it contains two merons and two anti - merons , which are bound in pairs to form two charge @xmath197 excitations , so the natural ground state has @xmath198 . also , it can occur for @xmath179 odd as well as for @xmath179 even , like the @xmath5 state , and unlike the @xmath1 state .",
    "the state is distinct from the @xmath5 state , despite the fact that it breaks pseudospin symmetry ( since @xmath199 carries pseudospin , the same value as the electron ) and has a gapless goldstone mode .",
    "the @xmath101 k - matrix has determinant zero , and hence a reduced k - matrix is required .",
    "this can be obtained most easily by first making the basis change for the condensate lattice to basis vectors @xmath200 , @xmath201 , and @xmath202 ( relative to the previous basis ) .",
    "the resulting k - matrix is @xmath203",
    "since this contains the @xmath5 state k - matrix as a block , it is clear that the reduced k - matrix is @xmath204 hence , the ground state degeneracy on the torus is @xmath185 .",
    "incidentally , the block containing only @xmath205 represents a `` hidden su(@xmath185 ) '' in this state ; the corresponding edge theory is an su(@xmath185 ) current algebra at level @xmath136 , even though this will presumably not be a symmetry of the hamiltonian .",
    "we can complete the circle and return to our starting point , the @xmath5 state , if the quasiparticle @xmath206 ( where the vortices are relative to the original basis ) condenses in the state ( [ eqn : descendent ] ) , thereby eliminating one of the neutral gauge fields by the anderson - higgs effect .",
    "the proliferation of these vortices leaves intact only those condensates ( composite boson fields ) which do not wind on going around these vortices .",
    "these condensates lie on a sublattice ( of the unreduced lattice ) , which is the same as that of the @xmath5 state ; in fact in the basis used for @xmath207 in eq .",
    "( [ k_3new ] ) , or for @xmath208 in eq .",
    "( [ krednew ] ) , the transition has destroyed the condensate described by the @xmath209 block at the lower right , leaving the @xmath5 state",
    ". this transition could be first - order or second order in the absence of disorder , according to the conflicting conventional wisdom discussed above .    a more useful form for the critical theory for the transition between @xmath1 and its interlayer coherent descendent , along the lines of eq .",
    "( [ ( 1,1,1)-sp ] ) , may be derived from eq.([eqn:(2,-2 ) ] ) by making the change of variables @xmath210 and integrating out @xmath211 .",
    "the lagrangian takes the form @xmath212 the gauge field @xmath213 only appears linearly in the lagrangian , so we may integrate it out , thereby resulting in the constraint that @xmath214 up to a gauge transformation .",
    "the final lagrangian is then @xmath215 hence , the transition between the @xmath1 state and its interlayer coherent hierarchical descendent is also in the xy universality class .    = 2.3 in    these states and transitions are depicted in the phase diagram of figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "the two states in the upper portion of the phase diagram  sp and @xmath1  are not interlayer coherent while the three states in the lower portion [ sp / f , @xmath5 , and the interlayer coherent descendent of @xmath1 ( identified by its @xmath129-matrix ) ] are interlayer coherent ( i.e. they spontaneously break pseudospin @xmath155 symmetry ) . the development of interlayer coherence may be probed by interlayer tunneling experiments @xcite .",
    "the states on the right in figure [ fig4 ] are expected for @xmath10 while those on the left are expected for @xmath14 . as we discuss in the next section , these may be distinguished by their hall drag resistivities .",
    "this phase diagram suggests that the transition between the @xmath1 and @xmath5 states may occur via an intermediate state which is either the sp state or the interlayer coherent hierarchical descendent of the @xmath1 state .",
    "we caution the reader that first - order transitions between any of these states are possible , even those that are not adjacent in the figure",
    ". however , the @xmath170 transitions _ can _ be second order .",
    "it is important to discuss experiments which can distinguish the @xmath216 state , the @xmath82 , its interlayer coherent descendent , and the sp state . here",
    ", we propose coulomb drag experiments in which the longitudinal , @xmath217 and hall , @xmath218 , drag resistivities are used to distinguish the different phases . these may be calculated in chern - simons theory from @xmath219 where @xmath220 , @xmath221 , @xmath222 is the antisymmetric tensor , and @xmath223 in the compressible and @xmath1 states ( `` intralayer '' composite fermions ) while @xmath224 in the @xmath5 state ( `` interlayer '' composite fermions ) .",
    "first , consider the longitudinal drag resistivity . in the compressible state , if we neglect gauge field fluctuations , @xmath225 , so @xmath226 . including these fluctuations",
    ", it vanishes as @xmath227 at low temperatures @xcite . in @xmath216 and @xmath82 ( as well as its interlayer coherent descendent ) ,",
    "@xmath228 and , hence , @xmath229 vanish at zero temperature and are activated at low temperatures @xcite .",
    "now , let us consider the hall drag resistivity . in the compressible state ,",
    "both terms on the right - hand - side of ( [ eqn : drag ] ) vanish , so the hall drag resistivity vanishes . in the @xmath1 state , @xmath230 is that of a @xmath231 superconductor , which has vanishing charge resistivity ( since it is a superconductor ) but quantized spin hall resistivity @xcite . in other words , @xmath232 , @xmath233 , @xmath234 .",
    "consequently , @xmath235 , and @xmath236 .    in the @xmath5 state ,",
    "@xmath230 is identical , but @xmath237 is different , so @xmath238 , and @xmath239 , in agreement with @xcite .",
    "the same result can be deduced more physically by noting that interlayer coherence requires that the voltage be the same in both layers .",
    "if we run a current in one layer alone , then this condition can only be satisfied if @xmath240 .",
    "on the other hand , the total hall resistance of the system is @xmath241 . since this must equal @xmath136 , we obtain the previously stated result .",
    "note that the same logic applies to the interlayer coherent descendent of the @xmath1 state which must , therefore , have @xmath242 . in other words , the full resistivity tensor of the @xmath5 state is identical to that of the interlayer coherent descendent of the @xmath1 state .",
    "note that the interlayer coherent descendent of the @xmath1 state discussed in the previous section is a _ pseudospin hall superconductor_. from ( [ eqn : hall_s ] ) , we see that the pseudospin conductivity tensor is of the form @xmath243 where @xmath244 is a constant .",
    "hence , there is non - vanishing spin hall conductivity .",
    "however , upon inverting this tensor , we see that the spin hall resistivity vanishes , as it must in order to satisfy @xmath242 .",
    "the @xmath5 state , on the other hand , has vanishing spin hall conductivity .",
    "the distinction between a _",
    "pseudospin hall superconductor _ and an ` ordinary ' pseudospin superconductor is reminiscent of the difference between a hall insulator and an ordinary insulator ( but inverted ) .    thus far , we have focused on the situation in which the layers are perfectly balanced .",
    "if they are unbalanced due to the presence of an external bias field , for example , this is analogous to introducing a pseudospin zeeman field along the @xmath245-direction .",
    "this will have a pair - breaking effect on the paired states and will be expected to weaken the quantum hall effect .",
    "this should , as a consequence , increase the longitudinal drag ( along with the total longitudinal resistance ) .",
    "the presence of external bias can , thus , be used to distinguish the paired state from other incompressible states .",
    "we conclude by summarizing our results .",
    "we have shown that the @xmath7 ( @xmath0 ) bilayer quantum hall system ( in the absence of interlayer tunneling ) is likely to have as its ground state a novel paired hall state ( possibly of @xmath72-wave symmetry ) for intermediate layer separations @xmath246 , which gives way to the usual @xmath5 state for smaller layer separations ( @xmath12 ) , and to compressible fermi - liquid - type states ( two decoupled halperin - lee - read @xcite @xmath7 layers ) for large layer separations ( @xmath247 ) .",
    "we argue that the quantum phase transitions separating the paired states from the @xmath5 and bilayer halperin - lee - read states can be experimentally studied via the measurement of various components of interlayer drag resistivities .",
    "we also argue that the transition between the @xmath1 and @xmath5 states may occur via an intermediate state which is either the sp state or the interlayer coherent hierarchical descendent of the @xmath1 state , and in either case one of the two transitions will be in the xy universality class .",
