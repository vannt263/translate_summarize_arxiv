    "the kibble - zurek ( kz ) mechanism , the mechanism for defect formations when a system is driven ( or quenched in the context ) through a continuous phase transition into an ordered state , has received a lot of attentions for many years . this mechanism was first proposed by kibble in cosmology .",
    "it predicts that topological defects can be formed with cosmological significance as the universe expands and cools through a continuous phase transition in a spontaneously broken gauge theory  @xcite .",
    "later zurek applied the critical scalings of the relaxation time and correlation length in the transition to compute the nonequilibrium scaling of defect density in condensed - matter physics  @xcite .",
    "this predication agrees with many numerical simulations and experiments  @xcite except in superfluid @xmath1he  @xcite .",
    "the kz mechanism has also been applied successfully to quantum phase transitions at least through a single quantum critical point either linearly or nonlinearly  @xcite .",
    "see ref .",
    "[ ] for reviews .",
    "recently , the kz mechanism has been applied back to classical critical phenomena to determine nonequilibirum scaling at the critical point by liu , polkovnikov , and sandvik ( lps )  @xcite .",
    "they proposed two scaling functions governing dynamic scalings in the so - called adiabatic and diabatic regimes .",
    "both functions cross over into the same universal power law in a universal scaling regime .",
    "these dynamic scalings were demonstrated beautifully by a dynamic finite - size scaling ( fss ) using different types of stochastic dynamics on ising models .",
    "a new estimate of the dynamic critical exponent @xmath0 for the two - dimensional ( 2d ) ising model was also obtained .",
    "on the other hand , we have applied a linearly varying external field  @xcite and temperature  @xcite to study scaling in classical first - order phase transitions  @xcite , classical continuous phase transitions  @xcite , and recently quantum phase transitions  @xcite following similar studies using internal frictions  @xcite .",
    "renormalization - group theories both for a field driving and a temperature driving have also been developed to derive the scaling with the rate of the sweeping  @xcite .",
    "a theory of finite - time scaling ( fts ) has also been proposed and confirmed numerically  @xcite and crossover from fts to fss has been considered theoretically but not yet been tested numerically  @xcite .",
    "however , these fts forms are different from the scaling proposed by lps in ref .",
    "[ ] . accordingly",
    ", a detailed comparison is desirable .    here",
    ", we shall first show that fts provides a detailed improved understanding of the kz mechanism .",
    "in particular , the finite time scale , which is introduced by the external driving ( or quenching ) and results in the concept of fts , is the origin of the division of the adiabatic regimes from the impulse regime in the kz mechanism .",
    "the origin of the kz scaling for the defect density generated during the driving is not that the correlation length ceases growing in the nonadiabatic impulse regime , but rather , is that it is taken over by the effective finite length scale corresponding to the finite time scale .",
    "in fact , the impulse regime is just the critical region in which scaling originates and is just the fts regime .",
    "so , the kz scaling just marks the crossover of the fts regime to the equilibrium regimes , which is the adiabatic regimes of the kz mechanism .    we shall then show that fts can not only well account for the scaling proposed by lps , which incorporates the kz mechanism with fss , but also improves it by making up its missing subleading contributions .",
    "thus , first , the lps adiabatic regime is just the usual fss regime in which the lattice size is the controlling length scale . as a result , it is also universal .",
    "second , the lps universal scaling regime is just the fts regime in which the externally imposed time scale is the controlling time scale . in this fts regime ,",
    "the dynamics is nonadiabatic or diabatic and the system falls out of equilibrium similar to the lps diabatic regime .",
    "third , the lps scaling function for the diabatic regime is a different representation of the fts form .",
    "further , we find that the lps universal scaling is applicable only to some observables in cooling but not to heating as there exist restrictions to fluctuations that render cooling and heating different . even in cooling ,",
    "this scaling is invalid either when the system is subjected to a small external field which , if large enough , can also remove these restrictions .",
    "however , for not sufficiently large applied fields , the lps scaling may appear in an intermediate regime between the fss and the standard fts regimes .",
    "for differentiation , we thus call it as a finite - time - finite - size scaling regime .",
    "in addition , as the lps universal scaling regime is essentially the impulse regime , applying the finite - size kz mechanism to explain the scaling at the critical point that lies deep in the impulse regime is essentially inconsistent , since the impulse regime is assumed in the kz mechanism as evolutionless .",
    "we shall finally study in detail fts and fss and their crossover for several observables in both fts and fss forms and unambiguously confirm them numerically .",
    "the influence of the lps finite - time - finite - size scaling on the application of fts will be demonstrated .",
    "the dynamic critical exponent @xmath0 will be estimated for the 2d and 3d ising models with the usual metropolis dynamics using fts and fss and their crossover .",
    "these estimated values give rise to better data collapses than the extant values do in most cases but take on different values in heating and cooling in both 2d and 3d .",
    "corrections to scaling are found to be prominent in heating for the extant values .    in the following ,",
    "we first review the kz mechanism and the scaling proposed by lps in sec .",
    "[ kz ] and fts in sec .",
    "[ fts ] , which allow us to reveal their relationship in sec .",
    "[ relation ] .",
    "we then summarize the characteristics of the fss and fts graphs for several observables in sec .",
    "[ chara ] and test them with monte carlo simulations from 2d and 3d classical ising models in sec .  [ results ] .",
    "various estimates of the dynamic critical exponents are presented there . finally , conclusions are given in sec .",
    "the kz mechanism facilitates finding the density of defects formed when a system is driven by varying a parameter through its critical value . for comparison with lps  @xcite , consider cooling a system from an initial temperature @xmath2 through the critical temperature @xmath3 with a constant rate @xmath4 ( @xmath5 in lps ) . in the vicinity of @xmath3 ,",
    "the system is characterized by a large correlation length @xmath6 and a correlation or relaxation time @xmath7 , both of which diverge at the critical point as @xmath8 respectively , where the reduced temperature @xmath9 and @xmath10 is the correlation - length critical exponent  @xcite .",
    "so , no matter how small the cooling rate @xmath4 is , there exists a frozen instant @xmath11 at which the system can not follow the cooling adiabatically and falls out of equilibrium , because the relaxation time of the system is longer than the time when the temperature is changed . to find @xmath11 , note that @xmath12 because the time origin can always be chosen in a way such that at @xmath13 , @xmath14 , independent of @xmath2 for a linear cooling",
    "so , at @xmath11 , `` the remaining time until the transition ''  @xcite , the corresponding frozen reduced temperature @xmath15 satisfies @xmath16 , i.e. , @xmath17 this leads back to @xmath18 the kz mechanism thus assumes that @xmath19 will not grow further once @xmath11 is reached , which may result from the assumed evolutionless of the state of the system in the quantum context  @xcite .",
    "so regions of about @xmath20 , with @xmath21 apart can mimic the causality - independent region in cosmology and topological defects can be found if the homotopy group of the order parameter is nontrivial  @xcite .",
    "accordingly , the generated defect density @xmath22 is proportional to @xmath23 , or , @xmath24 which is the kz scaling .",
    "the system is frozen until @xmath25 at which ( quasi-)adiabatic evolution reassumes , but the correlation length then decreases and the defects survive .",
    "one sees therefore that the kz mechanism divides the evolution of the system during the cooling into three regimes separated by @xmath26 .",
    "two adiabatic regimes at both ends are separated by an impulse regime that embraces the critical point and is assumed to be dark as the system is assumed to cease evolving there .",
    "the kz scaling , ( [ dd ] ) , is just a characteristic of the borders of the impulse regime .",
    "in addition , the kz division of different regimes has methodological implications . in the adiabatic regimes ,",
    "perturbation expansions work , while in the impulse regime , non - perturbative methods have to be employed .    in order to combine the kz mechanism with the standard fss , note first that eq .",
    "( [ hattau ] ) can be reversed and defines a general ( not specific to @xmath15 ) kz rate @xmath27 as @xmath28 for @xmath4 larger than @xmath27 , the system will fall out of equilibrium at @xmath29 . at @xmath14 or @xmath30 , @xmath31 .",
    "one sees therefore that the system can not remain adiabatic all the way down to @xmath3 for any finite rate @xmath4 as expected .",
    "however , this is possible for a finite - size system . reversing eq .",
    "( [ hatxi ] ) and replacing @xmath20 with the largest length scale of a finite system , its length @xmath32 , one defines a size - dependent kz rate @xmath33 as  @xcite @xmath34 note that this is the rate at which the correlation length @xmath20 at the frozen reduced temperature @xmath15 is of the order of the system size @xmath32 . consequently , for @xmath4 smaller than @xmath33 , the system remains adiabatic all the way down to @xmath3 and perturbative treatments are possible , as the correlation length has already larger than the system size . on the other hand , for @xmath4 larger than @xmath33 , the system will be frozen before it reaches @xmath15 and so adiabaticity breaks down .",
    "lps  @xcite considered the cooling of ising models to their critical points and studied the scaling behavior of the averaged squared magnetization @xmath35 , where the angle brackets stand for ensemble averages over different random - number sequences . using the techniques of the standard fss  @xcite",
    ", they assumed that the argument @xmath36 should enter the scaling for a linear driving in addition to the equilibrium argument @xmath37 and wrote a scaling ansatz for @xmath35 as  @xcite @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a scaling function . for simplification",
    ", they measured @xmath35 at @xmath14 .",
    "consequently , the first argument of @xmath39 vanishes and so @xmath40 where @xmath41 , a rule which will be followed throughout .",
    "more detailed scaling behavior can then be found from the scaling ansatz  ( [ m2scaling1 ] ) along with other plausible arguments .",
    "for small @xmath4 , the standard fss , @xmath42 must recover , while for sufficiently large @xmath4 , @xmath43 and depends on @xmath2 since the initial state hardly evolves for large @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "this then prompts lps to demand that @xmath44 must reduce to a pure power law of its argument with an exponent , @xmath45 such that @xmath46 in an intermediate universal scaling regime  @xcite , where @xmath47 is the critical exponent associated with the averaged magnetization @xmath48 . as the scaling  ( [ m2vx ] ) is obviously not consistent with the large rate limit for fixed @xmath32 , ( [ md ] ) , lps proposed to replace @xmath39 by two scaling functions , introduced further a size - independent upper limit @xmath49 beyond which the power - law behavior ( [ m2vx ] ) breaks down , and wrote @xmath50 where @xmath51 is a short - range length scale , which is of the order of one lattice spacing , and is mainly for dimension reasons .",
    "both scaling functions @xmath52 and @xmath53 cross over to the power law  ( [ m2vx ] ) in the intermediate universal scaling regime @xmath54 .",
    "lps numerical results show that @xmath52 characterizes well the scaling in the quasi - adiabatic and universal scaling regimes , whereas @xmath53 describes only the universal scaling regime but not the large - rate diabatic regime  @xcite .",
    "we shall show in the following that the power - law behavior  ( [ m2vx ] ) is only true for some observables in cooling and under no or a small applied external field .",
    "we shall also improve it by completing its full scaling form .",
    "fts is a temporal analogue of the fss .",
    "fss is a method to circumvent the embarrassment that the size @xmath32 of a system can even fall behind the correlation length @xmath6 inevitably in the neighborhood of a critical point .",
    "but the same nuisance happens in the time domain because of eq .",
    "( [ zeta ] ) and is the notorious critical slowing down .",
    "fts adopts the tactics of fss by devising a variable time scale that is readily controllable like @xmath32  @xcite .    to see this ,",
    "consider the dynamic scale transformation of the susceptibility defined as @xmath55 where we have neglected a temperature factor as we shall always work at the critical point . near a critical point and in the thermodynamic limit @xmath56  @xcite , @xmath57 where @xmath58 is a scale factor and @xmath59 the critical exponent for @xmath60 .",
    "for a _ constant _ @xmath61 , eq .",
    "( [ chit ] ) is well established within the renormalization - group theory for critical dynamics  @xcite . choosing @xmath58 on such a scale that @xmath62 is of order unity , one finds from the second argument of eq .",
    "( [ chit ] ) the correlation time @xmath7 in eq .",
    "( [ zeta ] ) .",
    "@xmath7 is finite for a finite @xmath61 and one could then estimate critical properties by finding @xmath60 for sufficiently long time .",
    "however , a more useful strategy is to change @xmath61 with time . if eq .",
    "( [ chit ] ) is valid for a _ time - dependent _ @xmath61 in the linear protocol  ( [ trt ] ) , the similar procedure gives rise to another time scale @xmath63 which is constant for a constant @xmath4 in contrast to the varying @xmath7 with @xmath61 , where @xmath64 is the renormalization - group eigenvalue of @xmath4 defined as @xmath65 upon rescaling .",
    "equation  ( [ tr ] ) can be derived by replacing the first argument of @xmath60 on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ chit ] ) with @xmath66 and choosing @xmath58 on the scale of @xmath67 .",
    "the reason of the replacement is that @xmath68 and so only two out of the trio are independent . from the rescaling of eq .",
    "( [ trt ] ) , viz .",
    "@xmath69 ( this can be considered to be a definition of @xmath66 ) , with @xmath70 and @xmath71 from eq .",
    "( [ chit ] ) , one finds @xmath72 not to be confused with the nonlinear exponent used by lps  @xcite .",
    "in fact , for nonlinear protocols of @xmath73 with a constant @xmath22 , the above method yields simply  @xcite @xmath74 in agreement with lps  @xcite .",
    "therefore , one sees that varying linearly @xmath61 does give rise to a new constant time scale @xmath75 .",
    "it is readily controllable simply by using , say , different cooling rates .    a renormalization - group theory using the technique of composite operator insertions  @xcite has been developed to justify the validity of eq .",
    "( [ chit ] ) for a time - dependent @xmath61  @xcite . within the framework of field - theoretical renormalization - group theory  @xcite",
    ", no genuine new exponents have to be introduced in the nonequilibrium driving process across the critical point , as the linear driving introduces no intrinsic new divergences to the original theory .    with the controllable finite time scale ,",
    "fts then follows . replacing the last argument on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ chit ] ) by @xmath76 , for example , and choosing @xmath58 on the scale of @xmath67 , one finds an fts form @xmath77 with a scaling function @xmath78 .",
    "the similarity to fss can be clearly seen here .",
    "the fts regime shows up for @xmath79 , which is just @xmath80 as expected . on the other hand ,",
    "equilibrium behavior @xmath81 follows in the other equilibrium regime .",
    "this is just the logic of fss  @xcite .    if the size of the system is finite , eq .",
    "( [ chit ] ) can be extended to @xmath82 as is usually done in fss .",
    "then choosing suitable scale factors leads to an fts form  @xcite @xmath83 or an fss form @xmath84 where @xmath85 and @xmath86 are scaling functions and are analytic when their arguments are small .",
    "note that both scaling forms can describe both the fts regime and the fss regime similar to @xmath52 in eq .",
    "( [ 2scaling_functions ] ) , which can describe both the adiabatic and the universal scaling regimes .",
    "in fact , one can check that @xmath87 besides the usual conditions that in the fts regime , @xmath88 and in the fss regime , @xmath89 , eqs .",
    "( [ chiftsl ] ) and ( [ chifssr ] ) also require roughly that in the former regime , @xmath90 and in the latter , @xmath91 by using eqs .",
    "( [ rkzl ] ) and ( [ r ] ) , i.e. , high rates for the fts and lower rates for the fss . using eq .",
    "( [ hatxi ] ) , which , in fact , defines an effective length scale associated with the driving , we can express these conditions in terms of length scales .",
    "thus , from eq .",
    "( [ chiftsl ] ) , the fts regime has @xmath92 and @xmath93 , which mean reasonably that the effective length scale is the shortest among @xmath20 , @xmath32 , and @xmath6 ; while in the fss , @xmath32 is the shortest .",
    "in this section , we summarize several relations between fts and the kz mechanism from the foregoing review .    from fts , ( a )",
    "the reason that the frozen instant @xmath11 , at which the remaining time until the transition equals the correlation time @xmath7  @xcite , is the division of the adiabatic and the impulse regime becomes clear .",
    "note that eqs .",
    "( [ tr ] ) and ( [ r ] ) is just the frozen instant @xmath11 in eq .",
    "( [ hatt ] ) .",
    "so , the instant at @xmath11 just equals the externally imposed time scale @xmath75 and thus at this instant @xmath94 . as a result , within the impulse regime",
    ", @xmath75 remains constant but @xmath7 increases and thus the external time scale is shorter than the relaxation time and the system falls out of equilibrium .",
    "therefore , by identifying the finite time scale , the kz division of different regimes is manifest .",
    "accordingly , ( b ) it is clear that the impulse regime is just the regime of fts and thus the system does not cease evolving . a similar conclusion has been reached in quantum phase transitions  @xcite .",
    "the situation here is similar to the fss regime in which the size of the system @xmath32 gets shorter than the correlation length @xmath6 . in this case , although the intrinsic correlation length may be still growing according to eq .",
    "( [ xi ] ) , the system can only feel the correlation length to the extent of its size @xmath32 .",
    "therefore , ( c ) although the defect density is still determined by @xmath20 , this is not because the intrinsic correlation length @xmath6 does not grow or does not subject to substantially grow , but because it is taken over by the driving : the constant driving time scale @xmath75 corresponds to a constant length scale @xmath20 , which is smaller than @xmath6 .",
    "in fact , ( d ) in comparison with the kz mechanism , it is the evolution of system within the fts regime that leads to the scaling , because this is the critical regime that embraces the critical point that in turn is the origin of the scaling .",
    "so , ( e ) the kz scaling only marks the crossover from the fts regime to the equilibrium regime . indeed , from eq .",
    "( [ chifts ] ) , the crossover occurs at @xmath95 , which just results in eq .",
    "( [ hattau ] ) .",
    "we study the relation between fts and the lps scaling  @xcite in this section .    first , similar to the conclusion ( d ) in sec .",
    "[ fk ] , @xmath33 in eq .",
    "( [ rkzl ] ) just marks the border or crossover between the adiabatic fss regime and the impulse fts regimes of a finite - size system . indeed , as mentioned , from eqs .",
    "( [ chiftsl ] ) and ( [ chifssr ] ) , the crossover takes place in a region at which the last arguments on the right hand sides of eqs .",
    "( [ chiftsl ] ) and ( [ chifssr ] ) are of order unity , viz . , @xmath96 .",
    "from sec .",
    "[ fts ] , we know that in the fss regime , @xmath97 and @xmath32 is shorter than the driving length scale @xmath20 .",
    "so , only in this regime can the system remain adiabatic all the way down to @xmath3 . in the fts regime ,",
    "@xmath98 or @xmath99 and the system falls out of equilibrium inevitably .",
    "therefore , although eq .",
    "( [ m2scaling ] ) , which is just eq .",
    "( [ chifssr ] ) for another observable , may be regarded as bridging between the adiabatic and impulse regimes , its inherent kz mechanism nature implies an inconsistency in applying the kz scaling at the border to @xmath3 deep in the impulse regime .",
    "next , lps peculiar scaling form  @xcite is just the leading contribution of fts . at @xmath30 , eqs .",
    "( [ chifssr ] ) and ( [ chiftsl ] ) becomes @xmath100 respectively .",
    "note that @xmath101 from the scaling laws  @xcite @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the specific - heat critical exponent .",
    "so , @xmath104 combining eq .",
    "( [ dn ] ) with eqs .",
    "( [ chi ] ) ( note that @xmath105 in principle but see below for details ) and ( [ r ] ) , one can convince oneself that the first line of eq .",
    "( [ ftsrl ] ) is just the corresponding one in eq .",
    "( [ 2scaling_functions ] ) and describes the fss regime , while the second line is the complete form of eq .",
    "( [ m2vx ] ) and describes the fts regime .",
    "therefore , we have obtained the lps scaling from fts and shown that it is just a form of fts , because just in this regime in which @xmath60 exhibits the standard fts form , @xmath35 shows the lps scaling .",
    "this will become clearer in the following .",
    "we see that the @xmath106 factor in the definition of @xmath60 automatically gives rise to the size factor of the scaling  ( [ m2vx ] ) in fts , though no new factor is produced in fss .",
    "moreover , we have improved the lps scaling by including the subleading contribution from @xmath107 in the fts regime in the second line of eq .",
    "( [ ftsrl ] ) . as a consequence of this subleading contribution , the first line of eq .",
    "( [ ftsrl ] ) is now not a pure power law in lps universal scaling regime as exhibited in eqs .",
    "( [ m2scaling1 ] ) to ( [ m2vx ] ) , but is given by eq .",
    "( [ f12 ] ) .",
    "we have utilized @xmath60 to derive and complete the lps scaling .",
    "we can of course do the same thing from the squared magnetization itself .",
    "we shall see that this provides both a physical explanation for and the limitations of the lps scaling .",
    "to this end , we first write the averaged magnetization and its squared themselves in the fts forms .",
    "they are  @xcite @xmath108 respectively .",
    "one can readily confirm that the scaling functions @xmath109 and @xmath110 are related to their fss counterparts of @xmath111 and eq .",
    "( [ m2scaling ] ) by @xmath112 respectively , similar to eq .",
    "( [ f12 ] ) .",
    "crossovers in @xmath48 and @xmath113 similar to eq .",
    "( [ ftsrl ] ) for @xmath60 would then result from eqs .",
    "( [ m2scaling ] ) and ( [ mftsr ] ) to ( [ f3 ] ) .    however , we need a new ingredient",
    ". there is an important difference between heating and cooling . during cooling , because of the absence of a symmetry breaking direction , the average magnetization and its squared must be vanished in the thermodynamic limit , though their appropriate difference , @xmath60 , does not near @xmath3 . in fss ,",
    "the volume factor for the average just leads to the proper power of the size factor as has been seen above . in fts , on the other hand , the effective length scale due to the driving  which is shorter than the system size  divides ,",
    "as may be envisioned , the system into dynamically fluctuating regions of correlation .",
    "the average of the magnetization and its squared of these regions ought to be vanished in the thermodynamic limit owing to the central limit theorem . in heating , however , there exist finite averaged magnetization and its squared .",
    "these then imply that for cooling in the fts regime , the scaling function @xmath114 behaves for small @xmath115 as @xmath116 with the caret indicating an associated regular scaling function for finite @xmath4 .",
    "so does @xmath117 for cooling .",
    "equation  ( [ sing ] ) reflects the restriction to the fluctuations in cooling , since the expansion of @xmath114 for small @xmath115 must now start from order @xmath118 instead of @xmath119 .",
    "accordingly , for cooling , the fts and fss forms and their crossover are @xmath120 while for heating , @xmath121 where we have used eq .",
    "( [ dn ] ) to combine the two exponents of @xmath4 into one .",
    "one sees therefore that the second line of eq .",
    "( [ m2ftsrlc ] ) is just the complete form of eq .",
    "( [ m2vx ] ) , the lps scaling , which leads to a vanishing @xmath113 in the thermodynamic limit as expected .",
    "this is to be compared with the heating case where @xmath113 remains finite in the fts regime @xmath90 in the same limit .",
    "owing to this difference , opposite signs of the powers of the leading dependences on @xmath4 for cooling and heating occur .",
    "therefore , we have derived directly the lps scaling .    moreover , from the derivation , we see that the lps scaling  ( [ m2vx ] ) is a consequence of the fts and the central limit theorem . it may thus be regarded as an interplay of fts and fss and be termed _",
    "finite - time - finite - size scaling _ , though a trivial form of fss in the sense that only the dimension of the space matters .",
    "however , from eqs .",
    "( [ mftsrlc ] ) to ( [ m2ftsrlh ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ ftsrl ] ) , one sees , on the other hand , that this lps scaling is only true for some observables in cooling . for heating and for @xmath60 in cooling for example , no @xmath106-like factor appears as the finite magnetization removes the restriction .",
    "in addition , one sees from eqs .",
    "( [ mftsrlc ] ) to ( [ m2ftsrlh ] ) that although the fts forms are different in heating and cooling , the fss forms are identical .",
    "because of eqs .",
    "( [ chi ] ) and ( [ dn ] ) , the relations among the magnetization and its squared and the susceptibility , there must exist relationship between the three sets of scaling functions @xmath85 , @xmath110 , and @xmath109 . indeed , eqs .",
    "( [ mftsrlc ] ) and ( [ m2ftsrlc ] ) along with eqs .",

    "( [ mftsrlh ] ) and ( [ m2ftsrlh ] ) .",
    "this is the reason why both the _ standard _ ( without the @xmath128 factor ) fts forms of @xmath113 or @xmath48 and @xmath60 are correct in heating , whereas only the standard fts form of @xmath60 is correct in cooling in the fts regime .    in order to further show the limitation of the lps scaling",
    ", we apply a small external field @xmath129 to the system in cooling .",
    "the fts form for @xmath113 becomes  @xcite @xmath130 where @xmath131 is another critical exponent .",
    "this small applied field results in a finite magnetization if it is sufficiently large . in this case , the scaling function @xmath132 at @xmath30 ought to be regular and the cooling @xmath113 now behaves as in heating for fixed @xmath133 .",
    "similar results apply to @xmath48 too .",
    "in addition , we have clearly seen that lps adiabatic and universal scaling regimes are just the fss and fts regimes , respectively .",

    "finally , we consider the scaling function @xmath53 for large @xmath4 in eq .",
    "( [ 2scaling_functions ] ) . as pointed out in sec .",
    "[ kz ] , this scaling function can not in fact describe the data for large @xmath4 since they all deviate from the scaling function as can be seen from fig .  4 for @xmath134 versus @xmath135 in ref .",

    "this description can be understood from eq .",

    "indeed , the leading contribution to @xmath136 or @xmath60 from @xmath135 is an exponent @xmath137 , which is just @xmath138 from eq .",
    "( [ xgamma ] ) in agreement with the results in ref .  [ ] . however , we find ( not shown ) that even presented in @xmath136 or @xmath139 versus @xmath140 for fts , the data for large @xmath4 do not collapse onto a single curve .",
    "this means that even higher - order expansion of @xmath140 can not account for the deviations . as @xmath4 is rather large and the state of the system",
    "is hardly changed during the cooling , these data of large @xmath4 are far away from the critical point .",
    "either they may exhibit no scaling at all or at least corrections to scaling  @xcite have to be considered . in our simulations",
    "below , we choose relatively small rates as our results will show and shall not consider them further .",
    "in this section , we summarize the main characteristics of graphs for @xmath48 , @xmath113 , and @xmath60 when presented in the forms of fss and fts for ease of comparison with numerical results . by the form of fss ( fts )",

    "the results are summarized in table  [ tablez ] .",
    "each entry of @xmath0 so obtained is given to the third decimal place as the interval of its variation in the fitting is @xmath162 .",
    "as has been pointed out above , the results from @xmath60 fluctuate a lot and we do not list them , possibly because of the deficiency of the numbers of the samples used .",
    "we have also listed the averages of all results from the fss form ( column 5 ) and fts form ( column 10 ) and both ( column 11 ) in table  [ tablez ] . in figs .",

    "[ chil^ ] and [ chir^ ] , respectively .",
    "we see from table  [ tablez ] that the results are quite consistent in that they are independent of both whether the fss or the fts forms and which variables are used to estimate them .",
    "this is also reflected in the high precisions of the averaged values in column 11 .",
    "however , it can also be seen from table  [ tablez ] that the values of @xmath0 estimated from heating is different from those from cooling .",
    "opposite trends are observed in 2d and 3d . for the former ,",
    "the heating data are smaller than the cooling ones , while , for the latter , the heating data are larger than the cooling ones .",
    "if we accept the extant values of @xmath0 , we see that the heating data are smaller than the extant one while the cooling data are larger in 2d , whereas both the heating and cooling @xmath0 are larger than the extant value in 3d .",
    "as @xmath0 is different in heating and cooling , the averaged values between heating and cooling listed in the last column in table  [ tablez ] can only serve as a reference .    to check whether these results are specific to the two - side method",
    ", we have also utilized the one - side method .",
    "we found however that this only affects the third decimal place of each @xmath0 value .",
    "we have also varied the range of @xmath4 in the one - side method . in this case , the @xmath0 values obtained vary a lot , from about @xmath163 to @xmath164 in both 2d and 3d , but without any appreciable systematic trends .",
    "this variation is understandable as a small fluctuation in one datum may change the fitting result .",
    "however , upon unbiased averages , averages that delete only large deviations beyond three standard deviations , the resultant @xmath0 values again agree with their corresponding ones listed in table  [ tablez ] , with the averaged values themselves differing only about 1 in the second decimal place in 2d and in the first decimal place for heating and less than 2 in the second decimal place for cooling in 3d . nevertheless , the trends with respect to the extant values remain .",

    "[ 3ddownrz ] for cooling , one sees that the differences between the curves are only slight if any , in consistence with the small difference between the present values of @xmath0 and the extant ones .",
    "it may be seen that , in 2d , from the data of the large sizes , which appear on the left side of fig .  [ 3ddownrz](a ) , the present results appear slightly better , whereas , in 3d , the extant results seem slightly better . although larger sample sizes may be needed to confirm these differences , fig .",
    "[ 3ddownrz ] already gives support to our results and their quality in cooling .",
    "for heating , on the other hand , from fig .",
    "[ 3duprz ] , it is clear that the present estimated values give rise to much better data collapses , especially in 3d .",
    "therefore , if the quality of data collapses is the sole deciding factor , a point which seems to be supported by the results shown in fig .",
    "[ 3ddownrz ] for cooling to the extent of the present statistics , the present values of @xmath0 describe much better the numerical results in heating . but",
    "this then results in the different values of @xmath0 in heating and cooling .    a possible reason for the difference between the present results and the extant ones may arise from the correction to scaling  @xcite which has not been taking into account . from fig .  [ 3duprz ]",
    ", it can be clearly seen that the data of different @xmath4 and @xmath32 do not collapse onto a single curve for the extant @xmath0 values .",
    "this indicates that the scaling functions are still @xmath32 and/or @xmath4 dependent if the extant @xmath0 values are true in heating .",
    "although fig .",
    "[ chir^](c ) and possibly fig .",
    "[ chil^](c ) show that the present 3d @xmath0 in heating may also contain correction to scaling , the collapses in @xmath113 and @xmath48 appear quite good with little correction . on the other hand , fig .",
    "[ 3ddownrz ] shows that correction to scaling may be negligible in cooling both for the present @xmath0 values and the extant ones to the extent of the present statistics .",
    "so , it is not clear whether the present results underestimate the correction to scaling or there is indeed a difference in @xmath0 between heating and cooling as observed in the scaling behavior .",
    "we leave such questions for future studies .",
    "we have studied in detail the relations between fts and the kz mechanism , lps scaling , and fss . in particular , we have found that fts and its essence , the controllable finite time scale , provides a detailed improved understanding of the kz mechanism .",
    "we have also shown that fts not only accounts well for , but also improves , the scaling proposed by lps , which incorporates the kz mechanism with fss .",
    "further , we have found that the lps universal scaling is applicable not to heating but only to to some observables in cooling under no or a small applied external field . in the latter case ,",
    "the lps scaling appears in an intermediate regime between the standard fts and the fss regimes .",
    "we have demonstrated clearly the leading fts regime and its crossover to the leading fss regime for both heating and cooling and in both the fts and the fss forms .",
    "detailed characteristics for this crossover behavior have been presented for several variables and confirmed unambiguously by numerical results for both heating and cooling .",
    "the dynamic critical exponent @xmath0 has accordingly been estimated for the 2d and 3d ising models with the usual metropolis dynamics .",
    "it gives rise to better data collapses than the extant values do at least in heating but takes on different values in heating and cooling in both 2d and 3d .",
    "corrections to scaling are a possible origin for these differences .    in comparison with fss , fts exhibits subtlety and richer behaviors such as the lps finite - time - finite - size scaling and its crossovers to fss and standard fts even for a single critical point of the ising type .",
    "consequently , caution should be excised in application of fts to estimate the critical exponents .",
