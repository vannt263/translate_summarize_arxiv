    "the study of scalar mesons and the interpretation of the experimental results is , despite a long lasting effort , still an active field of research with controversies on experimental results and the theoretical interpretation .",
    "the lightest scalar mesons have been interpreted as conventional @xmath6 , but also as tetra - quark or molecular states .",
    "in addition , there is the definitive expectation within qcd of the existence of scalar glueballs which can mix with the nearby states with quark constituents . depending on the mass of the glueballs ,",
    "this affects strongly the interpretation of the spectrum and leads to different scenarios .",
    "the phenomenological analysis attempts to group the spectrum of observed states into appropriate @xmath6 or @xmath7 multiplets : left over states are possible candidates for glueballs . also one expects the production of such states to be enhanced in `` gluon rich processes '' , while they should be suppressed in @xmath1 reactions and corresponding rules hold for decays as well .    the existence of glueballs has been predicted long ago in the early time of qcd as consequence of the self - interaction of gluons and first scenarios have been developed already in 1975 @xcite .",
    "today there is agreement on the existence of such states and the lightest state to be a scalar meson .",
    "quantitative results are available from lattice qcd and from qcd sum rules ( qssr ) .",
    "the theoretical results , recalled below , suggest a light scalar glueball with mass around 1 gev or below .    among the light particles",
    "the @xmath8 meson could be such a gluonic resonance .",
    "recent analyses of the @xmath9 processes have extracted the width of @xmath10 as : @xmath11 kev @xcite , @xmath12 or @xmath13 kev @xcite to @xmath14 kev @xcite , while the one from nucleon electromagnetic polarizabilities has given @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "such results have been interpreted in @xcite as disfavouring a gluonic nature which is expected to have a small coupling to @xmath1 @xcite .    in our recent paper",
    "@xcite a resolution of this conflict has been suggested . from the analysis of the @xmath9 processes in the low energy region below 700 mev",
    "we conclude that they are dominated by the coupling of the photons to charged pions and their rescattering , which therefore can hide any direct coupling of the photons to the scalar mesons .",
    "some first results from this study have been presented elsewhere @xcite .",
    "there are several results suggesting a light scalar glueball :    _ lattice qcd_. calculations in the simplified world without quark pair creation ( quenched approximation ) find the lightest state at a mass around 1600 mev ( recent review in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . these findings lead to the construction of models where the lightest glueball / gluonium mixes with other mesons in the nearby mass range of around 1300 - 1800 mev .",
    "however , recent results beyond this quenched approximation @xcite indicate the lightest state with a large gluonic component to fall into the region around 1 gev , and therefore , a scheme based on the mixing of meson states with all masses higher than 1300 mev could be insufficient to represent the gluonic degrees of freedom in the meson spectrum .",
    "further studies concerning the dependence on lattice spacings and the quark mass appear important .",
    "_ qcd spectral sum rules ( qssr ) and low - energy theorems ( let)_. these approaches have given quantitative estimates for the mass and decay properties of the gluonic bound states .",
    "in particular , in a combined analysis of subtracted and unsubtracted sum rules a low mass for the bare unmixed gluonium state is obtained @xcite : m__b(0.95~1.10 )  gev  , [ eq : msigmab ] besides the heavier state around @xmath17 .",
    "these masses are similar to the unquenched and quenched lattice results respectively , quoted above . the hadronic width in this approach",
    "is obtained rather large : _",
    "_ b^+^-0.7   gev  , [ eq : scalarwidth ] whereas the radiative decay width is found small : _ _ b ( 0.2~0.6 )  kev  .",
    "[ eq : radwidth ] indeed , this width is considerably smaller than the value of about 5 kev , which is expected for a state @xmath18 with mass of 1 gev @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", qssr predicts , for a four - quark state having the same mass of 1 gev , a @xmath1 width of about 0.4 ev @xcite .",
    "_ phenomenological studies_. a full understanding of the scalar meson spectrum is required if the glueball is to be found as a left over state after the identification of flavour multiplets .",
    "several schemes exist , motivated by the quenched lattice result , where the extra gluonic state is assumed to mix into the three isoscalars @xmath19 and @xmath20 @xcite . in an alternative approach @xcite , the lightest @xmath6 multiplet is formed from @xmath21 and @xmath22 , and the glueball",
    "is identified as the broad object at smaller mass represented by @xmath23 ; it dominates @xmath0 scattering near 1 gev but extends from threshold up to @xmath24 mev ( see also ref .",
    "the appearence of this broad object in most gluon rich processes was considered in support of this hypothesis . in this analysis of the spectrum ,",
    "results from elastic and inelastic @xmath0 scattering as well as from @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 decays have been considered @xcite .",
    "the amplitudes for the reactions @xmath9 are largely determined by elastic @xmath0 scattering and likewise in the case of multi - channel processes . first , there are the extended unitarity relations corresponding to the watson theorem for the single channel ; secondly , there are dispersion relations where the necessary subtraction terms generate polynomial ambiguities @xcite",
    ". this general formalism has been applied by mennessier @xcite , to obtain the electromagnetic processes @xmath28 , given the strong processes @xmath29 .",
    "the latter ones are represented by a k matrix model which represents the amplitudes by a set of resonance poles . in that case , the dispersion relations in the multi - channel case can be solved explicitly , which is not possible otherwise .",
    "this model can be reproduced by a set of feynman diagrams , including resonance ( bare ) couplings to @xmath0 and @xmath30 , and 4-point @xmath0 and @xmath30 interaction vertices .",
    "a subclass of bubble pion loop diagrams including resonance poles in the s - channel are resummed ( unitarized born ) .",
    "the radiative width of the resonances can not be predicted due to the polynomial ambiguity , which can be taken into account by introducing as free parameters the `` direct couplings '' of the resonances to @xmath1 in an effective interaction vertex . in the present analysis",
    "we have extended the model by the introduction of a _ shape function _ which takes explicitly into account left - handed cut singularities for the strong interaction amplitude .",
    "this allows a more flexible parametrisation of the @xmath31 data at low energies and improves the high energy behaviour .",
    "the model shows different characteristics at low and high energies : _ low energy limit : rescattering_. a striking feature of the low energy @xmath9 scattering is the dominance of the charged over the neutral @xmath0 cross section by an order of magnitude which can be explained by the contribution of the pion - exchange born term in @xmath32 . in the process @xmath33 , the photons can not couple `` directly '' to @xmath34 but through intermediate charged pions and subsequent rescattering with charge exchange .",
    "this feature is realized in the analytic model considered here @xcite which has it in common with the chiral perturbation theory @xcite . _",
    "high energy limit : direct production_. on the other hand , at high energies the photon can resolve the constituents of the hadrons .",
    "an example is the production of @xmath35 in @xmath9 .",
    "the analytic model @xcite predicts a decreasing cross section for this process with pion exchange reaching @xmath36 of the observed cross section at the peak of the @xmath37 .",
    "these considerations require the need of a `` direct coupling '' of @xmath38 .",
    "indeed , it is well known that the radiative decays of the tensor mesons @xmath39 are well described by a model with direct coupling to the @xmath6 constituents according to the @xmath40 structure of the nonet with nearly ideal mixing ( see e.g. ref .",
    "we therefore interpret the direct terms in the @xmath1 processes as originating from the coupling of the photon to the partonic constituents of the resonances ( such as @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath41,@xmath42 ) .",
    "in the application of this model @xcite , we first obtain a suitable k - matrix parametrisation of the @xmath0 scattering data , and then determine the direct coupling by comparing the model with the @xmath1 results . in the present analysis ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to the low mass region below 700 mev where we neglect vector and axial - vector exchanges @xcite , inelastic channels and d - waves .",
    "furthermore , we assume a pointlike pion - photon coupling , which is expected to be a good approximation in the region where we are working .",
    "we apply the analytic model @xcite , but we introduce a _ shape function _",
    "@xmath43 which multiplies the @xmath44 coupling .",
    "the real analytic function @xmath43 is regular for @xmath45 and has a left cut for @xmath46 . for our low energy approach , a convenient approximation , which allows for a zero at @xmath47 and a pole at @xmath48 simulating the left hand cut ,",
    "is : f_0(s)= [ formfactor ]  . for simplicity , we do nt include the 4-point coupling term .",
    "the unitary @xmath0 amplitude @xmath49 for the isospin @xmath50 s - wave is written as : t_0^(0)(s ) = =  , [ tpipi ] where @xmath51 is the bare coupling squared .",
    "unitarity determines the imaginary part , while a dispersion relation subtracted at @xmath52 determines the form of @xmath53 @xcite . using the s wave amplitude in eq .",
    "( [ tpipi ] ) we derive the amplitude @xmath54 for the electromagnetic process for isospin @xmath50 as : t_^(0 ) = ( f_0^b + g  ) +  .",
    "[ elmamp ] the first contribution comes from the born term for @xmath55 , the second one from the @xmath0 rescattering and the third one represents the polynomial contribution @xmath56 which reflects the ambiguity from the dispersion relations and represents the direct coupling of the resonance to @xmath1 .",
    "the residues at the pole @xmath57 of the rescattering and direct contributions to @xmath58 in eq .",
    "( [ elmamp ] ) determine the respective branching ratios .",
    "similarly , we construct the @xmath59 @xmath60-wave amplitude @xmath61 and @xmath62 as well as the cross sections for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 scattering processes @xcite .",

    "we first determine the parameters of the model for @xmath0 scattering below 700 mev from the best approximation of our formula to the phase shifts @xmath70 and @xmath71 obtained in the roy equation analysis in @xcite .",

    "given the @xmath0 amplitude , we can predict the cross sections for @xmath72 where the only free parameter @xmath73 is related to the strength of the direct coupling @xmath74 .",

    "then the fit in the charged channel deviates from the data at high - mass ; the large systematic errors and the absence of data points in the region 0.40 to 0.55 gev do not permit a good understanding of this channel .",

    "these analyses , however , do nt separate the direct term .",
    "the results from qssr / let are obtained in the physical region and can better be compared with experiment by using the corresponding results for the `` visible meson '' on the real axis instead of the results at the complex pole : this can be , either the breit - wigner mass and width ( see @xcite ) or the `` on shell '' mass and width ( see e.g. @xcite ) , which are obtained for the mass @xmath79 where the real part of the propagator vanishes @xmath80 .",
