    "in the area of model - checking , the search for efficient techniques for verifying infinite - state systems has been an ongoing research effort .",
    "much work has been devoted to investigating various restricted models of infinite - state systems that are amenable to automatic verification for some classes of temporal properties , e.g. , safety and liveness .",
    "a timed automaton is one such model .",
    "a timed automaton @xcite is a finite automaton ( over finitely many control states ) augmented with dense clocks .",
    "the clocks can be reset or progress at the same rate , and can be tested against clock constraints in the form of clock regions ( i.e. , comparisons of a clock or the difference of two clocks against an integer constant , e.g. , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are clocks . ) .",
    "the most important result in the theory of timed automata is that region reachability for timed automata is decidable @xcite .",
    "this result has been used in defining various real - time logics , model checking algorithms and tools @xcite for verifying real - time systems .    however , region reachability is not strong enough to verify many complex timing requirements not in the form of clock regions ( e.g. , ",
    "@xmath4 is always true \" ) for timed automata .",
    "recently , decidable binary reachability ( i.e. , the set of all pairs of configurations such that one can reach the other ) characterizations for timed automata and their generalizations were obtained @xcite .",
    "the characterizations opened the door for automatic verification of various real - time models against complex timing requirements .",
    "for instance , a flattening technique was used by comon and jurski @xcite to establish that the binary reachability of timed automata is definable in the additive theory of the reals and integers .",
    "a timed automaton can be augmented with other unbounded discrete data structures such as a free counter and reversal - bounded counters .",
    "a ( free ) counter is an integer variable that can be incremented by 1 , decremented by 1 , and tested against 0 .",
    "a counter is reversal - bounded if the number of times it alternates between nondecreasing and nonincreasing mode and vice - versa is bounded by some fixed number independent of the computation @xcite .",
    "a pattern technique was proposed by dang @xcite to obtain a decidable binary reachability characterization on some  storage - augmented \" timed automata .",
    "for instance , suppose that @xmath5 is a timed automaton ( with dense clocks @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) augmented with two reversal - bounded counters @xmath8 and @xmath9 , and a free counter @xmath10 .",
    "the result of dang @xcite implies that the binary reachability of @xmath5 is definable in the additive theory of the reals and integers .",

    "we first prove the main theorem that the existence of an @xmath0-chain for @xmath15 is decidable when @xmath15 is transitive . this proof is done by eliminating quantifiers from @xmath15 using a recent result of @xcite and expressing @xmath15 into mixed linear constraints .",

    "the system is designed to be non - terminating and some fairness constraints are expected .",
    "we use @xmath308 ( resp .",
    "@xmath309 ) to denote the total time that process 1 ( resp .",
    "process 2 ) takes the cpu so far .",
    "one such constraint could be as follows .",
    "there is no infinite execution of the system on which the difference @xmath310 is unbounded .",
    "this constraint can be automatically verified due to theorem [ bound ] and the fact , from theorem [ cj1 ] , that the system , a discrete timed automaton augmented with two monotonic ( and hence reversal - bounded ) counters @xmath308 and @xmath309 , is a mixed linear counter system .",
    "there has been much interesting work on various verification problems for pushdown systems @xcite .",
    "studying pushdown systems is important , since they are directly related to recursive programs and processes . in this subsection",
    ", we will study pushdown systems with discrete clocks and reversal - bounded counters .",
    "safety verification for these systems is discussed in @xcite . here",
    ", we investigate the mixed linear liveness problem ( since now we have only discrete variables , we call the problem as the presburger liveness problem ) .",
    "as we mentioned before , a timed automaton can be augmented with reversal - bounded counters .",
    "here we only consider discrete clocks that take integer values .",
    "the discrete timed automaton can be further augmented with a pushdown stack .",
    "the resulting machine @xmath5 is called a discrete pushdown timed automaton with reversal - bounded counters . in addition to counter operations and clock operations , @xmath5 can push a symbol on the top of the stack , pop the top symbol from the stack , and test whether the top symbol of the stack equals some symbol .",
    "a configuration of @xmath5 is a tuple of a control state , discrete clock values , counter values , and a stack word .",
    "the binary reachability @xmath260 is the set of configurations pairs such that one can reach the other in @xmath5 .",
    "each stack word @xmath311 corresponds to an integer tuple @xmath312 , where @xmath313 is the stack alphabet and each count @xmath314 stands for the number of symbol @xmath315 in @xmath311 .",
    "the tuple @xmath316 is also called the _ stack word counts _ for @xmath311 . in this way",
    ", a set @xmath317 of configurations corresponds to a predicate on states , clock values , counter values , and stack word counts .",
    "@xmath317 is presburger if the predicate is definable by a presburger formula .",
    "@xmath317 is _ commutative _ if , for any configurations @xmath28 and @xmath318 satisfying that @xmath28 and @xmath318 are the same except that the stack word in @xmath28 is a permutation of the stack word in @xmath318 , @xmath319 iff @xmath320 . in this case",
    ", the predicate exactly characterizes the set @xmath317 .",
    "let @xmath262 and @xmath263 be two presburger subsets of configurations .",
    "we say @xmath5 is _ @xmath263-live from @xmath262 _ if there is an infinite sequence @xmath321 such that ( 1 ) .",
    "@xmath322 , ( 2 ) . for all @xmath67 , @xmath323 , and ( 3 ) .",
    "@xmath324 for infinitely many @xmath206 .",
    "the presburger liveness problem for @xmath5 is whether @xmath5 is _ @xmath263-live from @xmath262 _ , given @xmath262 and @xmath263 two presburger subsets of configurations .",
    "[ pio ] the presburger liveness problem for discrete pushdown timed automata with reversal - bounded counters is decidable .",
    "we are not able to extend the result of theorem [ pio ] to dense clocks .",
    "the pattern technique @xcite that abstracts a dense clock into a discrete clock and a pattern does not apply here .",
    "this is because the abstraction maintains the exact binary reachability of dense clocks , but does not maintain the exact dense clock values between the binary reachability .",
    "timed pushdown systems with reversal - bounded counters dealt in theorem [ pio ] also have a lot of applications .",
    "for instance , it can be used to model some real - time recursive concurrent programs .",
    "the reversal - bounded counters can also be used to count the number of external events  these counts can be later used to specify some fairness constraints on the environment .",
    "in this paper , we showed that it is decidable whether a transitive mixed linear relation has an @xmath0-chain . using this main theorem",
    ", we were able to establish , within a unified framework , a number of liveness verification results on generalized timed automata .",
    "more precisely , we proved that ( 1 ) the mixed linear liveness problem for timed automata with dense clocks , reversal - bounded counters , and a free counter is decidable , and ( 2 ) the presburger liveness problem for timed automata with discrete clocks , reversal - bounded counters , and a pushdown stack is decidable .",
    "the results can be used to analyze some fairness constraints ( e.g. , livelock - free and starvation - free ) for infinite - state concurrent systems .",
    "our results are useful in formulating a decidable subset of linear temporal logic ( ltl ) for a class of timed automata augmented with counters .",
    "let @xmath5 be a timed automaton with dense clocks , reversal - bounded counters , and a free counter .",
    "the set of linear temporal logic formulas @xmath325 with respect to @xmath5 is defined by the following grammar : @xmath326 where @xmath263 is a set of configurations of @xmath5 definable by a mixed formula ( on control states , dense clocks , reversal - bounded counters , and the free counter ) .",
    "@xmath327 denotes  next \" , and @xmath328 denotes  until \" .",
    "formulas in @xmath325 are interpreted on infinite execution sequences @xmath74 of configurations of @xmath5 in the usual way .",
    "this logic is very similar to the presburger ltl for timed automata with discrete clocks @xcite except that @xmath263 is a mixed formula instead of a presburger formula .",
    "the _ satisfiability - checking problem _ is to check , given @xmath5 and @xmath329 , whether there exists an infinite execution @xmath74 of @xmath5 with @xmath330 . from corollary",
    "[ b12 ] , the satisfiability - checking problems are decidable for the following ltl formulas :        some work needs to be done in the future in formulating an exact decidable subset ( broader than the subset in comon and cortier @xcite ) of @xmath325 for satisfiability - checking . notice that the entire @xmath325 is undecidable for satisfiability - checking / model - checking , even when the next operator is dropped from the logic .",
    "this is because the satisfiability - checking problem for @xmath334 is undecidable , when @xmath5 is a discrete timed automaton , as shown in @xcite .",
    "a similar decidable subset of ltl formulas @xmath325 could be formulated for discrete timed pushdown systems , by combining theorem [ pio ] , the results in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "another issue is on the complexity analysis of the decision procedures presented in theorem [ basic11 ] and theorem [ pio ] .",
    "however , this issue is related to the complexity for the emptiness problem of npcms , which is still unknown , though it is believed that it can be derived along gurari and ibarra @xcite .",
