    "a small collaboration within the na62 experiment is conducting a feasibility study for measuring the very rare decay @xmath0 . with a br(@xmath3  @xcite predicted by the standard model ( sm ) , no experiment has yet been capable of observing the decay . the goal of the `` klever '' experiment is to observe tens of these decays while keeping the signal to background ratio at 1:1 .",
    "the collaboration has published their initial findings in an na62 technical note  @xcite , including the findings of this study .    to accomplish this goal , long - lived ,",
    "neutral kaons @xmath1 will be created by colliding 400 gev / c protons accelerated by cern s sps with a beryllium target .",
    "the most common charged decays from the @xmath1 , the signal decay , and their applicable br s are shown in table  [ table ] .",
    "the signal is two photons from the @xmath4 detected by the liquid krypton electromagnetic calorimeter ( lkr ) and no other particles detected elsewhere .",
    "any difference between the experimental measurement and the sm branching ratio may point to new physics.@xcite",
    "a 10:1 signal to charged background ratio is necessary for the experiment .",
    "the rate of charged background and the reduction required to achieve the signal to background ratio were studied . the overall 1:1 signal to background ratio includes the neutral decays , with contributions primarily from @xmath5 , but is not discussed here .",
    "additional details can be found in  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the lkr ( @xmath6 m from the target ) , there are 26 large angle vetoes ( lav ) upstream of the lkr , and a small angle calorimeter ( sac ) and inner ring calorimeter ( irc ) behind the lkr .",
    "their purpose is to detect photons and charged particles missed by the lkr .",
    "charged decays of the kaon were simulated with geant4  @xcite@xcite .",
    "a list of selection criteria was sequentially applied to each event in the resulting root  @xcite file .",
    "events were eliminated if any of the following were true : a charged particle or photon was detected by the lavs , irc , or sac ; fewer than two energy clusters were detected by the lkr ( clusters closer than 6 cm were merged ) ; the reconstructed @xmath4 decayed outside of the fiducial region ( @xmath7 m ) ; an lkr cluster was closer than 35 cm to the beamline center ; or the transverse momentum of the reconstructed @xmath4 was less than 0.12 gev / c . designed primarily to eliminate background from the most problematic neutral decays , these criteria also significantly reduce charged background .",
    "some charged decays passed all of the selection criteria and were accepted as signal events because they were indistinguishable from the signal ( e.g. a pion and electron reconstructed as two photons from a @xmath4 ) [ see table  [ table ] ] .    *",
