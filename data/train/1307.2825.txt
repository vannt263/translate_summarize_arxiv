    "distributions unintegrated over the parton transverse momentum , @xmath7 , are known to be an effective way to describe hard processes in which the transverse momentum of final particle ( prompt photon@xcite , @xmath8 boson or drell - yan lepton pair@xcite , heavy quark@xcite , etc . ) is measured .",
    "for the interaction with a heavy nucleus the momentum distribution of secondaries is affected both by the ` final state ' rescattering of the secondary particle inside the nuclear medium and by the nuclear modification of the incoming parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) .    in @xcite",
    "a prescription was proposed which allows the unintegrated pdf ( updf ) to be obtained from the conventional integrated pdf with nlo accuracy .",
    "this opens up the possibility to study the nuclear modifications of updfs based on the existing parton distributions in nucleus . here",
    "the unintegrated distributions are calculated using the eps09@xcite nuclear parton integrated distribution functions for the case of @xmath9 , lead .",
    "different approaches have been used to determine the unintegrated nuclear distributions  @xcite . in the earlier work",
    "@xcite , the nuclear effects in the gluon distribution were studied in the small @xmath1 domain based on the analytical asymptotic solution of the balitsky ",
    "kovchegov equation  @xcite .",
    "the bk equation is a non - linear evolution equation in the variable @xmath1 and includes effects from saturation  @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , a monte carlo was developed to determine the nuclear unintegrated gluon distribution , in which , in impact parameter space , nucleons of finite radius are placed at random in positions inside the nucleus . when the nucleus is probed at an impact parameter that is contained by only one nucleon",
    ", the unintegrated gluon distribution from free proton is used , derived from the numerical solution of the running coupling bk equation  @xcite starting from some initial saturation scale @xmath10 .",
    "if the nucleus is probed at an impact parameter domain where @xmath11 nucleons overlap , then the initial saturation scale is multiplied @xmath11 , i.e. , @xmath12 .",
    "in contrast with the previous studies , the present work covers the whole region of @xmath1 up to @xmath13 and , besides the screening corrections , accounts for the fermi motion , emc effect and the antishadowing at not too low @xmath1 . also , all species of unintegrated partons are obtained , including unintegrated quark distributions .",
    "this work is based in dokshitzer ",
    "gribov  lipatov  altarelli ",
    "parisi evolution  @xcite in which @xmath14 terms are properly taken into account at each order , and the unintegrated distributions are functions of three variables , @xmath1 , @xmath7 , and @xmath15 , instead of just the first two . dglap provides a linear evolution and saturation effects are absent , except in the parametrization of the distributions at the starting scale .",
    "in addition , our approach includes the suppression of unintegrated distributions at small @xmath7 caused by the sudakov factor .",
    "recall that a parton distribution in a nucleus ( pdf@xmath16 ) is not equal to the sum of the pdfs in the component nucleons ( @xmath17pdf@xmath18 )  pdf@xmath18 but @xmath19 .",
    "however this does not matter since below we consider the flavour singlet parton distributions only . ] .",
    "there are different physical effects depending on the value of @xmath1 .",
    "we summarize here in terms of ratio r^a as follows :    * at very small @xmath1 the parton density is smaller ( than the simple sum ) due to absorptive ( shadowing ) effects . * at larger @xmath1 , @xmath20 , the value of pdf@xmath16 exceeds the sum , @xmath17pdf@xmath18 .",
    "this antishadowing is just due to momentum conservation .",
    "after the fusion of two parton cascades ( originating from two different nucleons ) into the one branch of the parton cascade we get a lower number of low @xmath1 partons but the momentum fraction , @xmath1 , carried by each parton becomes larger just near the fusion position .",
    "* next , for @xmath21 there is an emc effect@xcite and the ratio @xmath22 becomes less than 1 . * finally ,",
    "at very large @xmath23 , we have an enhancement @xmath24 due to fermi motion .",
    "the unintegrated parton distributions are obtained from @xcite : @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 is the integrated parton distribution , for example , @xmath28 .",
    "the cutoff @xmath29 in @xmath30 integration is specified below , see ( [ eq : delta1 ] ) .",
    "the sudakov factor @xmath31 resums the virtual dglap contributions during the evolution from @xmath32 to @xmath33 .",
    "it is given by : @xmath34 the tilde splitting functions are given by the usual @xmath35 expansion @xmath36 and they are defined from the unregulated dglap splitting kernels . for non - diagonal elements , one has @xmath37 , while for diagonal elements : @xmath38 with @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 also , @xmath42    the cutoff in @xmath30 , @xmath29 , accounts for the coherence of gluon radiation amplitudes which leads to the angular ordering of emitted gluons .",
    "it is function of transverse momentum and the scale @xmath43 .",
    "in ( [ eq : updf ] ) it reads @xmath44 while in ( [ eq : sud ] ) , being written in terms of virtuality , @xmath45 we use nlo kinematics throughout .    at first sight , the unintegrated parton distributions",
    ", @xmath46 should have the same behaviour as the parent integrated parton @xmath47 in ( [ eq : updf ] ) .",
    "however , the integral ( [ eq : updf ] ) samples the parton density at a larger @xmath48 and at a somewhat different scale @xmath26 . therefore the updfs become shifted to the left , that is to a smaller values of both @xmath1 ( @xmath49 ) and @xmath7 ( @xmath50 )",
    "this leads to the distortion of the nuclear modification effects .",
    "depending on the particular kinematics in some regions , say @xmath51 , we may get @xmath52 ( shadowing ) at low @xmath7 and antishadowing , @xmath24 at larger @xmath7 .",

    "we consider both the lo and the nlo prescriptions to calculate the updf . in both cases",
    "we account for the kinematical factor @xmath56 which limits the available value of @xmath57 in the unintegrated distributions with the fixed hard scale @xmath43 . for a large @xmath7 , relatively close to the value of @xmath43",
    ", these kinematics lead to a vanishing of the nucleon updf already at @xmath58 .",
    "indeed , due to angular ordering in gluon emission we have an upper limit @xmath59 in the diagonal tilde splitting functions @xmath60 and in the integration in @xmath30 there is a kinematical upper limit @xmath61 enforced by the @xmath62 function in ( [ eq : updf ] ) . on the other hand , in([eq : updf ] ) @xmath63 ; that is , even starting with a @xmath64 integrated distribution , for @xmath65 we get a zero updf for @xmath66 .",
    "actually the nucleon pdfs decrease sharply as @xmath67 . for a heavy nucleus this distribution",
    "is washed out by fermi motion , leading to a large ratio r^a=>1 at @xmath1 close to 1 .",
    "since the unintegrated distribution is shifted by the kinematical inequality @xmath68 and starts to decrease at a lower @xmath1 , the increase of the ratio @xmath22 takes place earlier .",

    "[ fig : ug ] and [ fig : uq ] it looks like a singularity of @xmath22 , with an @xmath1-position which moves to smaller @xmath1 when @xmath7 becomes closer to @xmath43 . + at very small @xmath1 , absorption affects the updf@xmath16 less than the integrated pdf@xmath16 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the integrated distribution , @xmath69 ( or @xmath70 ) ) includes all partons with transverse momenta @xmath71 , while in updf we deal with partons of momentum @xmath7 only . at lower @xmath72",
    "the absorptive cross section , @xmath73 , is larger , leading to stronger shadowing of the integrated distributions   we have a weaker shadowing in figs .",
    "[ fig : ug ] and [ fig : uq ] ] .",

    "the nuclear modification effects observed for the updf@xmath16 , obtained under the lo and the nlo prescriptions , are qualitatively the same .",
    "however in the nlo case , which samples some contributions beyond strong @xmath7 ordering , the difference between the shadowing of the updf and the integrated pdf is smaller .    in figs .  3 and 4 we present the ratios @xmath22 calculated at a larger scale @xmath75 gev . in the low @xmath1 region",
    "the nuclear modification is controlled by the value of @xmath7 and practically is independent of @xmath43 ; see , for example , the comparison of results in figs .",

    "[ fig : uq ] and [ fig : uq40 ] ) . in ( [ eq : updf ] ) the value of @xmath43 affects only the sudakov factor @xmath77 which is almost exactly canceled in the ratio @xmath22 . on the other hand , for large @xmath1 it becomes crucial that the scale @xmath43 determines the limits of the @xmath30 integration and therefore the shift between the @xmath22 curves for integrated and unintegrated distribution depends on the ratio @xmath78 .",
    "indeed , we observe practically the same shift in @xmath1 for the cases of \\{@xmath75 gev , @xmath79 gev } and \\{@xmath80 gev , @xmath81 gev}.",
    "the unintegrated quark and gluon @xmath1-distributions for a lead nucleus were calculated for different values of transverse momenta @xmath7 based on the integrated pdfs for the nucleus  @xcite using both the lo and the nlo prescriptions  @xcite .",
    "we present the ratios of the parton distributions for a lead nucleus to that for the sum of the free constituent nucleons .",
    "we discuss the role of the kinematical effects which ( a ) shift the unintegrated distribution to a smaller @xmath1 values , ( b ) wash out the distribution , and ( c ) lead to a weaker absorption in the updf@xmath16 case .",
    "we show that the absorptive effects depend mainly on the value of @xmath7 , while the shift of the @xmath22 curve in @xmath1 is controlled by the @xmath78 ratio .",
