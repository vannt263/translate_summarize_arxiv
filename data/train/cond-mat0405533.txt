    "<S> it is not difficult to show that the diffuse field - field correlator may be also constructed by superposing an equipartitioned set of uncorrelated incident plane or incoming or standing waves together with their coherent reflections and scatterings . </S>",

    "<S> the sole anomaly in the data is the best - fit value of the relative variance at zero separation : @xmath57 , an anomaly with only small statistical significance . </S>",
    "<S> such a value can not be explained with the current theory ; indeed the basic assumption of gaussian statistics demands that this quantity be @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> however , if the quantity @xmath58 is understood as the ratio between the relative variance at zero separation and at the first minimum , then the current theory can explain the anomaly , by calling for @xmath59 .    </S>",
    "<S> the data s precision does not support any more detailed comparisons . </S>",
    "<S> this is also the case with the in - plane modes . </S>",
    "<S> modes which have even up / down parity consist of an equipartitioned diffuse mixture of longitudinal waves with wavenumber @xmath60 ( which have both in - plane and , due to poisson effect , out - of - plane components of displacement ) , and in - plane horizontally polarized shear waves with wavenumber @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> these waves mode convert to one and other at the plate boundaries . </S>",
    "<S> thus the relevant green s tensor has two wavenumbers , and one anticipates structures like those seen in figs . 4 and 5 of schaadt _ </S>",
    "<S> et al_. however , as in the flexural case , one does not expect to see simple bessel functions @xmath14 , but rather also terms in @xmath62 and @xmath63 . </S>",

    "<S> an attempt to fit their data to the present theory is probably unwarranted at this time . </S>",
    "<S> a revisit to structures like theirs , but with a well characterized detector of known polarization , may be indicated .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have advanced a modification of berry conjecture , appropriate for the eigenmode statistics of wave - bearing systems . </S>",
    "<S> it is expected to be relevant , not only for elastic waves in homogeneous plates , but in general statistical physics of waves in heterogeneous and mode - converting systems as well .    </S>",
