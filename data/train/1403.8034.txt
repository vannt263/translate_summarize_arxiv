    "despite the vast potential for communication through social media such as facebook , users tend to interact mostly with their closest friends  @xcite .",
    "friends tend to come from similar socio - demographic backgrounds , share common interests and information .",
    "this presents evidence of homophily , or the long - standing social truth that  similarity begets friendship \"  @xcite .",
    "while it has interesting implications in social networks in terms of link prediction  @xcite , resilience  @xcite , and preferential attachment  @xcite , homophily also leads to the localization of information and resources into socio - demographic space  @xcite .",
    "conversely , diversity in social contacts has been shown to be of great importance for social and economic wellbeing , both at individual and community levels  @xcite .",
    "access to diverse information and resources in social networks can result in easier access to jobs and opportunities .",
    "much of the diversity in information that we experience both offline and online come from weak ties  @xcite .",
    "social media sites like facebook have had a profound effect on the way we maintain close and distant social relationships , on their number and their diversity , and the cultivation of our social capital  @xcite . with more weak ties",
    "online we have access to more diverse news , opinions and information in general .",
    "it increasingly appears that while homophily is strongly present in traditional social networks offline  @xcite , there is an emergence of  heterophily \" online , where people are exposed to and engage with information mainly from others who are dissimilar  @xcite . _ while in light of social diversity this is a sought effect , no comparison between online and offline social circles has confirmed this until now . _    in this work we introduce a new multiplex measure of social tie strength and apply it to uncover the presence of homophily within a community of 74 students , with respect to political orientation , music preferences , health habits , and situational factors .",
    "we then measure whether students can potentially be exposed to more diversity in these categories through their offline or online ( facebook ) social circles .",
    "our methodology is inspired by fischer s early work on homophily  @xcite , where it was observed that the more types of relations that exist between two people ( e.g. , friends , kin , neighbor ) , the stronger their bond , and the stronger the effects of homophily ( similarity ) between them .",
    "although very different from kinship relations , the same principle of tie strength and depth was found in media multiplexity with regards to various types of media in the organizational environment  @xcite , where stronger ties interact through more types of media than weaker ones . in this work",
    ", we use this concept in student interactions and apply the resulting multiplex social tie measure to homophily , all the while considering both online and offline relationships in the community .",
    "the contributions made in this work can be summarized as follows :    * we propose a novel methodology for studying online and offline interactions based on communication multiplexity .",
    "we apply it to the multi - channel communication of a group of 74 mit co - resident students , taking into account phone calls , text message , and co - location data .",
    "we show that the greater number of channels utilized between two individuals ( multiplexity ) , the higher the probability of a strong social tie such as close friendship . *",
    "considering the pairwise similarity of user profiles based on political orientation , music preference , health indicators , and situational factors such as residential sector and year in college , we show that there is a significant positive relationship between communication multiplexity and profile similarity .",
    "* we distinguish between the effects of homogeneity and homophily on a multiplex network level , across categories .",
    "we observe that while the political and health similarity between students can be credited to the overall homogeneity within the community , there is distinct evidence of homophily based on music and situational factors .",
    "* finally , by observing the difference in composite similarity between one s offline and online social circles , we find that _ online interactions are more diverse _ in terms of exposure to more varied musical preferences and political opinions .",
    "however , diversity online is relative to situational factors offline such as commonality in residence and year in college and these appear to be driving factors for facebook friendship .",
    "the remainder of this work is structured as follows : we first present a review of the literature on multiplexity , offline and online homophily and social capital , followed by a description of our research hypotheses , methodology and data .",
    "we then present a quantitative evaluation of our hypotheses followed by a discussion of the implications of the relative diversity found online , and the role of social media such as facebook in diversifying human interactions .",

    ", we can distinguish between the top graphs ( [ fig : hom1 ] and [ fig : hom2 ] ) as having consistently high probability of high similarity over distance , and the bottom graphs ( [ fig : hom3 ] and [ fig : hom4 ] ) as having a diagonal distribution of high probability , with high similarity probability decreasing over distance .",
    "the first two figures show an overall homogeneity in terms of political and health factors . at a distance of 1 ( non - connected nodes ) , the probability of high similarity is still high , indicating that two nodes with high multiplexity and high similarity in these categories could be connected at random .",
    "high homogeneity can be expected in the study , given that students are co - residing and share the same context .    on the other hand",
    ", homophily exists where there is non - random similarity between individuals with shorter multiplex distance .",
    "this is most evident in subfigure  [ fig : hom3 ] - music preferences , where there is a clear shift in high probability from top left to low right as distance increases .",
    "this means that those pairs at a short distance in the network , are also highly likely to have a similar taste in music ( @xmath33 , where @xmath34 ) , whereas those pairs who are further from each other in the network have a lower similarity in music taste . for unconnected pairs ,",
    "the similarity is especially low ( near 0 ) , indicating that edges in the network with respect to music are non - random and highly dependent on musical preferences .",
    "[ fig : hom4 ] on the other hand shows an interesting divide between low and high similarities .",
    "most pairs are grouped into very high or very low similarity , and appear at the top row and bottom row of the graph .",
    "therefore , students tend to be either in the same year and floor or in different years and different floors , which may be as a result of room allocation according to year .",
    "there is a high chance ( @xmath35 ) that those who live and study together ( @xmath36 ) , also have a highly multiplex tie , represented by the distinguishable top left tile at position ( 0,1 ) , and less so for those who live further apart and/or are in a different year .",
    "despite the community being highly homogeneous in political and health aspects , we find that _ the shorter the distance in the multiplex network , the greater the similarity between two nodes _ ( h3 ) in the music and situational categories , which is indicative of homophily .",
    "the decrease in diversity of resources such as information is a potentially harmful effect of homophily and homogeneity alike .",
    "we therefore conclude our analysis by exploring the role of online and offline social circles in diversifying information in the student community in the following section .",
    "+      so far , we have identified homogeneity and homophily within the student community . especially during the formative university years",
    ", it is important to maintain diverse information and resources . in this section , we assess the value of social media such as facebook in introducing diversity across the categories taken into consideration in this work by comparing students offline social circles with their online ones .    we define diversity as the opposite of homogeneity , and measure the @xmath37 difference ( change ) in similarity between the online and offline neighborhoods of each node .",
    "the online neighborhood of a node includes all nodes to which it is connected where there is any declared social relationship , since we know that all relationships are a subset of facebook ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "the offline neighborhood includes all other connections to nodes in the graph , where there is no stated social relationship in the surveys . to obtain the @xmath37 change between the online and offline similarity",
    ", we subtract the average online similarity of an ego from the average offline similarity . formally :    @xmath39    where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the similarity values between the offline and online contacts of a given student , and @xmath42 and @xmath43 are his offline and online neighborhoods .        in fig .",
    "[ fig : diff ] , values above 0 indicate that there is greater online diversity than offline , whereas values below zero indicate that there is a lower diversity online than offline .",
    "the boxplot can be read as the distribution of @xmath44 , where the values are divided into quartiles .",
    "the top and bottom continuous lines ( or whiskers ) represent the top and bottom quartiles , whereas the values inside the box , below and above the thick line representing the median , are the upper and lower mid - quartiles .",
    "we can see immediately that the situational ( year / floor ) category online is largely less diverse than offline .",
    "in other words , students are more often facebook friends with other students in their year and residential sector but may meet offline with students from other residential sectors and/or years .",
    "interestingly , we find that in terms of political orientation , facebook friendship between students tends to be more varied than offline , with more than 50% of values above zero . in terms of music preference and health , we have a 50/50 distribution , where half of online relationships are more varied than offline and vice versa .",
    "however , the music distribution is more wide spread , meaning that there is a big disparity between offline and online neighborhoods . on the other hand ,",
    "health indicators are more clustered around the median , indicating small disparities between online and offline neighborhood diversity .    from this analysis , the situational ( year / floor )",
    "category appears to be the most important factor for facebook friendship , however , we observe that _ greater diversity is possible online in terms of politics and music_. music exhibits the most observable homophily in fig .  [",
    "fig : sims ] , yet some students have more musically diverse facebook friends than offline contacts .",
    "this is due to the steep decline in similarity in fig .",
    "[ fig : hom3 ] , after a distance of 0 , which means that although one is very likely to have music in common with their close friends , the people they socialize with or have just as facebook friends can be highly diverse .",

    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    this work makes several contributions to the study of human interactions online and offline .",
    "we firstly describe a generalizable model for defining multiplex tie strength through different media .",
    "this model is grounded on previous work on multiplexity  @xcite , and attempts to fill a gap in homophily research , identified in  @xcite by advancing the understanding of multiplex social ties , social distance , and applying it to the online and offline context as required by the two - dimensional nature of human relations nowadays .",
    "we additionally show in the context of our study that in social circles such as those formed in a college campus , strong ties with high multiplexity bear greater similarity , and highly ranked nodes have many connections with high similarity .",
    "we find more similar nodes are at a shorter distance in the network in situational and music aspects , as evidence of homophily , while political and health factors indicate high homogeneity in the community .",
    "we also find that for three frequently shared categories of information online - politics , music , and health , users were part of more or equally diverse social circles online , however their online connectivity is highly dependent on situational factors such as year in college and residential sector .",
    "the academic environment has been a rich source of sociological studies , and education itself is a strong factor in homophily  @xcite .",
    "studying homophily in the college context is relevant to the socio - demographic background in the institution , and as we have observed in the present work , consists of a highly homogeneous group of people .",
    "unfortunately , parallel online and offline data is rarely available and similar studies would benefit in the future from wider - context at a larger scale .",
    "nevertheless , it is precisely in such homogeneous communities that diversity of information is most needed , especially in the formative university years .    despite the potential for exposure to greater information diversity online , we are not able to conclude as to the usage patterns and content of the students newsfeeds on facebook .",
    "there are many additional constraints to receiving diverse information such as time and attention spent on facebook , aggregation of posts , and blocking of content by the user - not considered in the present work . nevertheless , we are able to observe a satisfactory measurement of multiplex tie strength , and present a novel model generalizable to all communication interactions .",
    "our work reflects the role of social media in maintaining diverse social circles , highlighting a challenge for the design of such services - allowing for diversity while maintaining relevance in an increasingly populated online information stream .",
    "this has become of recent public concern , as the term _ filter bubble _ emerged to describe the personalization of services such as facebook and google as an  echo chamber \" of censorship in search and information aggregation  @xcite .",
    "the concern is that receiving only agreeable and relevant information may obscure objectivity and limit access to potentially useful and diverse resources .",
    "recent work , however , has demonstrated that facebook users are more likely to share diverse content from weaker ties than from stronger , more similar ties as a result of generally having more weak than strong ties online  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "diversity online is relative to diversity offline - we tend to associate ourselves online with people we meet offline or who share similar interests and likely come from a similar background . in this work",
    ", student ties at the same educational institution were strongly affected by residential sector and year in college but exhibited diversity in other aspects online .",
    "it is evident that online social circles are maintained at a lower time cost and social media such as facebook have become an important component of human communication .",
    "facebook not only helps decrease tie decay over distance and time  @xcite but can also enhance tie strength through online interaction  @xcite and instill a sense of closeness and stability to geographically distant and communication - restricted ties  @xcite .",
    "facebook serves ties of varying strength , as reflected in the present work , and allows us to stay engaged with a large subset of the people we meet offline , stretching the boundaries of our social circles .",
    "increases in audience size and diversity on facebook are associated with an increase in the amount of broadcasted information online  @xcite .",
    "the passive consumption of broadcasted information from friends on facebook can also lead to an increase in tie strength  @xcite , and therefore diverse and large audiences on facebook contribute to the overall increase of social capital , as is also implied by the present work .",
    "these technology effects have much more profound implications outside the geographically constrained college environment , nevertheless , even small increments in the diversity of homogeneous social circles can be of great benefit and may also be encouraged by design .    when it comes to the depth of human relations , it is difficult to reduce them to any single value .",
    "our work goes one step in the direction of applying more dimensionality to social ties , a direction which will hopefully bring greater understanding to the online and offline aspects of human social life and their interdependence .",
