    "protoclusters , the high  redshift ancestors of local galaxy clusters , are powerful laboratories both for tracing the emergence of large scale structure and for studying the evolution of galaxies in dense environments .",
    "observations of these structures over a range of wavelengths can map both the star forming and evolved galaxy populations , facilitating studies of the build - up of galaxies and clusters during a crucial epoch of their evolution .",
    "luminous high - redshift radio galaxies ( hzrgs ) are among the most massive galaxies in the early universe , and likely progenitors of brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) ; for a review see @xcite .",
    "they are often embedded in overdense structures of galaxies with sizes @xmath103 mpc and present  day masses in the range 10@xmath1110@xmath12m@xmath13 , comparable to local rich clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "targeting them has therefore proven to be an efficient technique for identifying these overdense structures in the early universe .",
    "the statistics of radio galaxy environment luminosity functions are consistent with every brightest cluster galaxy having gone through a ` hzrg ' evolutionary phase , with radio - selected protoclusters being typical ancestors of local galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "as protoclusters evolve into today s massive clusters , galaxies and gas are fed into the central regions from the surrounding environment .",
    "therefore to study the large - scale structure whose collapse gives rise to local virialized clusters , scales extending well beyond the protocluster cores at @xmath14 must be mapped .",
    "a typical galaxy , travelling at 500 kms@xmath4 , will cross @xmath05 mpc in the time between @xmath15 and the present day .",
    "so the material that ends up within 5 mpc of the cluster core will be spread across @xmath020 comoving mpc at z @xmath03 .",
    "@xcite studied lyman - break galaxies in the 15 mpc environment around a @xmath16 protocluster , and found that the central protocluster concentration was surrounded by several interconnected galaxy concentrations , similar to the predictions of cosmological simulations .",
    "similarly @xcite studied h@xmath17 emitters surrounding a @xmath18 protocluster and found that they lie in 3 distinct clumps , spread over @xmath08 comoving mpc .",
    "far - infrared observations provide a unique opportunity to find and characterise distant star - forming cluster members .",
    "cluster ellipticals are an important and enigmatic population ; one of the major outstanding mysteries of galaxy formation is how these massive , ` red and dead ' galaxies grow quickly enough to be fully - formed by @xmath19 . a key unknown ingredient is the amount of dust - obscured star formation that occurs at @xmath20 , when these galaxies build - up most of their stellar mass .",
    "this is impossible to determine without far - infrared data to break the degeneracy between age and dust content when modelling the uv to infrared spectral energy distribution ( sed ) .",
    "previous detections of far  infrared / sub  millimetre galaxy overdensities with ground  based instruments such as scuba @xcite and mambo @xcite have shown that this wavelength regime is promising for protocluster searches .",
    "historically the normal field of view of most infra  red or optical imagers is comparable , or even smaller than the predicted angular size of protoclusters ( @xmath020 ) , which has severely hampered their study .",
    "this situation has improved with the advent of the _ herschel _ space observatory @xcite , with its combination of sensitivity and fast mapping speed .",
    "far  infrared protocluster candidates are beginning to be discovered within the surveys carried out with _",
    "@xcite spectroscopically identified a cluster of star  bursting proto ",
    "elliptical galaxies at @xmath21 in the _ herschel_atlas survey @xcite . a similar detection of an overdensity of hyper  luminous infrared galaxies at @xmath22 ( clements et al . in prep ) was made by cross  matching the atlas catalogue with the planck early release compact source catalogue @xcite , while a similar cross identification with hermes sources reveals four lower redshift cluster candidates ( clements et al .",
    ", 2013 , mnras submitted ) .",
    "however , protoclusters are rare structures so these surveys are not likely to contain many .",
    "the need for a large  area , targeted , survey of hzrg fields has motivated the development of the search for protoclusters with _ herschel _ ( spher ) , a far - infrared survey of 26 hzrg fields .",
    "this takes advantage of the combination of sensitivity and fast mapping speed of the spectral and photometric imaging reciever ( spire ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on  board _ herschel _ to map the entire protocluster and its environment .",
    "this first paper uses the spire data from the 26 fields to investigate the far - infrared environments around the hzrgs .",
    "future papers will address the multiwavelength properties of these fields .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows : sections [ spher ] and [ dr ] describe the spher survey , observations and data reduction ; section [ cat ] outlines the creation of the corresponding source catalogues and section [ env ] analyses the central far  infrared environments of each field .",
    "finally sections [ discuss ] and [ conclude ] discus the results . throughout this paper",
    "a concordance cosmology is assumed , with values for the cosmological parameters of h@xmath23  km  s@xmath4mpc@xmath4 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "this gives a physical scale at @xmath26 of 8.475 kpc@xmath27and 7.083 kpc@xmath27at @xmath28 .",
    "these correspond to @xmath01.5 comoving mpc@xmath27and @xmath02.1 comoving mpc@xmath27respectively .",
    "the aim of the spher survey was to use the far - infrared spire instrument to construct a statistical sample of hzrg fields hosting the most massive black holes known at @xmath20 , across an area large enough to encompass the entire potential protocluster and its environment .",
    "this means that sufficient numbers of these objects are needed at each epoch to ensure against bias by atypical targets , and provide statistically robust results .",
    "the compendium of @xcite was used to select 26 of the most powerful hzrgs ( @xmath3 w hz@xmath4 ) , evenly spaced across this redshift range , with a minimum of 2 sources per redshift bin , @xmath29 .",
    "eight of these targets are already confirmed as rich protoclusters ( via ly@xmath17 or h@xmath17 observations ) , and possess a large amount of supporting data spanning 0.3 to 24 , though this generally covers the inner ( @xmath30 ) region only .",
    "the spher far - infrared observations were carried out as part of the first ( ot1 ) and second ( ot2 ) open time _",
    "herschel _ programmes .",
    "the initial ot1 proposal mapped 30@xmath31 30regions , centred on the central hzrg , in 7 of the confirmed protoclusters , and one protocluster candidate ; the remaining 18 fields were targeted in the ot2 period over a smaller area of 20@xmath31 20to reduce the observing time requirements . table [",
    "obs_table ] lists the full set of hzrg targets , together with their redshifts , radio powers and the _ herschel _ observing programme within which they fall .    [ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      the two fields with the strongest overdensities are detected at the 3.9 and 4.3@xmath32 level respectively ( table [ dens_table ] ) .",
    "the overall significance of these results is the probability of finding 2 @xmath33 overdensities such as these by chance , given that 19 fields were observed . to calculate it , the probability density function for each field",
    "is randomly sampled 10,000 times , and the frequency of overdensities as strong as this is counted in each iteration .",
    "this gives a final probability of @xmath5 and suggests that the results are inconsistent with being due to random background fluctuations .",
    "the two fields that show a significant overdensity in the mc500 catalogues can be used to measure the radial extent of the average far  infrared protocluster candidate .",
    "this is done by counting the cumulative number of galaxies within increasing comoving radii from the hzrg positions , and subtracting the expected number of galaxies ( measured from the reference field ) .",
    "the radial extent is the point at which the variation in this galaxy excess with radius flattens .",
    "this calculation shows that the average galaxy overdensity here is contained within @xmath06 comoving mpc , with an excess of @xmath34 galaxies ( figure [ rad_extent ] ) .",
    "this is in agreement with the radial extent determined by @xcite for near  infrared selected overdensities .",
    "they also find that the majority of the excess galaxies are found in the central region ( @xmath35 comoving mpc ) .",
    "this is not replicated here as only @xmath36 lie within this radius .",
    "the galaxy overdensities seen here can be characterised by comparing them to predictions from cosmological simulations .",
    "@xcite , for example , used hydrodynamical simulations to show that the known protocluster mrc 1138 - 262 is consistent with being the high  redshift progenitor of a rich galaxy cluster at @xmath37 .    @xcite follow the evolution of @xmath0 3000 clusters in the millennium simulation @xcite from the highest redshifts to @xmath37 , and",
    "can therefore match the properties of a local massive cluster to the high  redshift protocluster it grew from . a cluster , in the context of their work ,",
    "is defined as a gravitationally bound dark matter halo of mass @xmath8m@xmath9h@xmath4 ; a protocluster is the high  redshift progenitor of such a @xmath37 object .    the @xcite semi - analytic galaxy model ( sam ) used in the cluster simulations investigated by chiang et al . , as well as many other sams ,",
    "have been known to under - predict the number of galaxies with extremely large star  formation rates ( sfr ) at high redshifts .",
    "however , the _ herschel _ results can still be compared with the simulations assuming that the simulated galaxy population with the highest rank of sfr at a given redshift is a reasonable tracer of the population of heavily star - forming _ herschel_detected galaxies at those redshifts .",
    "because of the fixed flux density limit of our herschel survey , the number density of _ herschel _ smgs that is detected is a strong function of the redshift , which translates into a limiting sfr threshold that increases with redshift .    in order to ensure that the approximate shape of this redshift - selection function is also present in the simulation , a redshift - dependent selection on sfr",
    "is applied that mimics that in the real data .",
    "this is accomplished by requiring that @xmath38 m@xmath9 yr@xmath4 .",
    "the @xmath39 dependence of this cut accounts for the increase in the sfr detection limit with redshift ( e.g. see yun et al .",
    "the normalisation constant , @xmath40 , is adjusted such that the mean surface density of simulated sources matches that observed in the reference field .",
    "the analysis is carried out for protoclusters located at @xmath41 , halfway between the redshifts of the two hzrg fields with the strongest overdensities , for which a value of @xmath42 is appropriate .",
    "the redshift range searched is the same as that expected for the colour selection applied to the real data : @xmath43 .",
    "it should be noted that the degree of fore- and background contamination and the size of the simulated overdensities produced using this selection do not depend strongly on the form of the sfr selection function .",
    "however , the results are sensitive to the uncertainties in the redshift range and source surface density associated with the _ herschel _ colour selection , which are assumed here to be correct in the absence of more accurate data .",
    "the most massive ( @xmath44m@xmath9 ) simulated protoclusters are also generally larger in radial extent and contain more galaxies than their low  mass counterparts .",
    "figure [ size_plot ] illustrates this trend for three separate bins in cluster mass defined at @xmath37 . also shown",
    "are the positions of the average _ herschel _ @xmath33 galaxy overdensities , taken from the radial extent calculation in section [ rad_extent_sec ] .",
    "these imply an enclosed mass for these structures of @xmath45 m@xmath9 , which is consistent with that determined previously for hzrg  selected protoclusters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* )    this is a convincing picture , but the large redshift range searched means that the galaxies contributing to the overdensity may lie a long way from the hzrg in redshift space . investigating this with the simulations implies that overdensities of similar strength to those seen here ( e.g. @xmath46 ) typically consist of between 1 and 4 protocluster structures along the line of sight , within the volume defined by the search radius and redshift uncertainty .",
    "of these , the largest protocluster in the region contributes @xmath03 galaxies on average to the overall source numbers . whilst this is consistent with the @xmath05 excess _",
    "galaxies , it is clear that the redshift uncertainty must be reduced to confirm the nature of the galaxy excesses seen here .      of the 26 hzrg fields targeted with _",
    "herschel _ 8 have previously been identified as containing a rich protocluster ( references given in table [ obs_table ] ) .",
    "a further 3 have significant overdensities of either spitzer  selected galaxies ( pks 0529 - 549 & 4c23.56 , both cirrus  contaminated here ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or near  infrared selected galaxies ( mg 2308 + 0336 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for comparison , the 2 fields found here to contain @xmath47 far  infrared overdensities of galaxies ( mp j1758 - 6738 and nvss j111921 - 363139 ) also show overdensities of spitzer  selected galaxies of 2.6 and 3@xmath32 respectively @xcite .",
    "one field , pks 1338 - 1942 , has previously been found to have an overdensity at 1.2 mm , through a combination of sub  millimetre , radio and optical imaging @xcite .",
    "this result is interesting as none of the spectroscopically confirmed ly@xmath17 emitters used to originally identify it as a rich protocluster @xcite were detected at 1.2 mm , suggesting that there is no overlap between them and the dusty galaxy population .",
    "this is consistent with the lack of significant overdensities in the known protoclusters considered here .",
    "it should be noted that the majority of the sources contributing to the overdensity are detected in the spire data , but the low resolution means that many are blended .",
    "in addition the photometric redshift constraints at 1.2 mm are weak which , combined with the uncertainty in the far  infrared colour redshift selection used here , means that no corresponding overdensity is seen at these wavelengths .",
    "the hzrg sample used here , and that used for the linked spitzer studies of @xcite ( 3.6 and 4.5 ) and @xcite ( 24 ) have 10 of the low ",
    "cirrus hzrg fields in common ( 16 in total ) .",
    "six of these overlaps are known , spectroscopically confirmed , protoclusters , 4 of which do not show galaxy overdensities in either the spitzer or the _ herschel _ data .",
    "in total only 25% of the overlapping fields are overdense at 3.6 , 4.5 or 24 .",
    "eight fields also overlap with the carla survey @xcite , which searches for galaxy overdensities in deeper spitzer 3.6 and 4.5data than that used by @xcite . of these ,",
    "only one is a known protocluster , and it is not significantly overdense in either sample . in total 50% of the overlapping , low ",
    "cirrus , fields show @xmath47 spitzer overdensities .",
    "a potential issue here is the assumption that any protocluster overdensity present is centred on the hzrg position .",
    "@xcite studied the distribution of @xmath48 emitters in the vicinity of a protocluster , and found they lay in three distinct clumps , one of which surrounded a hzrg .",
    "visual inspection of the spatial distribution of colour  selected galaxies ( figure [ radecfig ] ) suggests that this may be the case for the mrc 0052 - 241 field , which contains a clump of sources located just outside the edge of the search radius .",
    "this paper has analysed the far  infrared environments surrounding 19 hzrgs , after excluding an additional 7 fields for post  background subtraction cirrus  contamination , which can manifest as a spurious protocluster signal .",
    "simple source counting finds that , on average , at 500 , the fields have a higher galaxy surface density than the background within the central 6 comoving mpc .",
    "improved statistical constraints on this result are obtained by restricting the analysis to potential protocluster members only ( selected using a far  infrared colour cut ) ; this reveals significant overdensities in 2 fields .",
    "comparison with simulated protoclusters drawn from the millennium simulation shows that these overdensities are consistent with protoclusters of mass @xmath45 m@xmath9 , but that it is also possible that the excess galaxies come from several low ",
    "mass protocluster structures located within the volume searched .    the generally low observed surface density of these objects at these wavelengths , which must in part be ascribed to the large spire beam , makes overdensities particularly hard to identify here .",
    "these results demonstrate that it is possible to identify potential protocluster candidates in _ herschel _ data , but the inefficiency of the process , and the failure to detect the known rich protoclusters in the sample makes it clear that targeting hzrgs is a less successful technique here than it has proved at other wavelengths .",
    "it seems likely that spire is probing different structures than those identified using the classical narrow  band or mid  infrared imaging techniques .",
    "this conclusion is reinforced by the growing number of serendipitous discoveries , in far  infrared surveys , of protoclusters with no central hzrg ( e.g. clements et al .",
    "2013 , mnras submitted , and the spectroscopically confirmed cluster of starburst galaxies presented in ivison et al .",
    "further work is needed to understand the different populations this implies .",
    "future work will combine these spire data with forthcoming radio , optical and near  infrared data to improve the selection of protocluster member galaxies , and expand the search for associated structures across the whole area of the fields .",
