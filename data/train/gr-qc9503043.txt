    "early universe scenarios tend to be based on the evolution of scalar fields , either through their rle as inflaton fields or as topological defect forming fields .",
    "a detailed understanding of the quantum evolution of these fields is important in order to fully describe their behaviour during a phase transition .",
    "this has recently been the focus of a great deal of attention .",
    "its study relies on analysing the quantum dynamics in real time .",
    "guth and pi @xcite in one of the land mark papers in the field of inflation investigate the quantum mechanics of the scalar field in the new inflationary universe , looking in detail at the `` slow rollover '' transition .",
    "the idea of a `` slow rollover '' arises because the transition involves a scalar field @xmath0 which evolves slowly down its potential starting from some initial position where it is described by a well defined wave function .",
    "the phase transition can be thought of one where at very high temperatures the potential has a minimum at @xmath1 , which becomes unstable as the temperature decreases , with the stable minima moving to a new larger value of @xmath2 say .",
    "as the universe cools the field remains close to @xmath3 , slowly evolving towards its true vacuum value .",
    "the beginning of the phase transition is quantum mechanical in nature , yet the late time evolution of the scalar field being described by classical equations of motion .",
    "this assertion needs to be justified , as first addressed in @xcite .",
    "analysing an exactly soluble linearised model , both in one - dimensional quantum mechanics and in quantum field theory of a single scalar field , it was discovered that the large - time behaviour of the field in an unstable upside down harmonic oscillator potential is ` accurately described by `` classical physics . ' '' in the one - dimensional quantum - mechanical model the evolution of the wave function describing the particle in the potential is determined by the exactly solvable schrdinger equation .",
    "the solution for the wave function is not surprisingly that of a gaussian .",
    "the harmonic oscillator potential maintains the form of the initial gaussian wave function .",
    "in @xcite the time  dependent variational method developed by jackiw and kerman @xcite is used in the investigation of the behaviour of a particle moving in a one dimensional quantum mechanical with more realistic potentials ( i.e. a double well potential ) , which have analogues both in the inflationary universe scenario and in models for the formation of topological defects . the important point that needs to be raised , and",
    "the motivation for this paper , is that in that work , and most subsequent work , the analysis is performed using a gaussian trial wavefunction .",
    "the resultant equations of motion obtained through the variation of the effective action are the time - dependent hartree - fock ( hf ) equations . in @xcite",
    "the authors argue that by comparison with the exact ( numerical ) solution the variational hf approximation accurately describes the process , and that the late time behaviour of the evolution is approximately classical if described in terms of a suitably chosen small dimensionless coupling constant .",
    "we argue in this paper , that it is straightforward to go beyond this gaussian ansatz by expanding the wavefunction in a complete set of hermite polynomials .",
    "in particular we find that just keeping the first and second order terms in the expansion leads to a dramatic improvement in the accuracy of the variational approach , and argue that such a technique can easily be adapted to the field theory @xcite case where presently the hartree- fock approximation is generally adopted in variational calculations applied to the early universe @xcite .",
    "there are many reasons why it would be advantageous to go beyond the gaussian approximation .",
    "if we have a potential which has degenerate minima , then it is impossible for a gaussian wavepacket to accurately describe the evolution of a scalar field during a phase transition .",
    "this is particularly relevant for calculations involving the formation of topological defects .",
    "for example imagine we wish to understand the circumstances under which defects can be said to have formed and their distribution at formation@xcite .",
    "recently in the context of @xmath4he vortices , there has been considerable attention paid to understanding the evolution of the scalar field responsible for their formation just after the quench transition @xcite .",
    "one of the limitations of this interesting calculation is that it can not accurately probe the non  linear regions of the potential , hence is only strictly valid just after the quench . in order to fully describe the formation process it is important to be able to probe the true vacuum of the potential .    in the context of our simple one dimensional quantum mechanical system",
    "we hope to demonstrate that by extending the ansatz of the wavefunction to include the hermite polynomials , then at little extra cost in complexity we can probe the non  linear region of the potential in far greater detail than has previously been possible ; an advantage that will be carried over to the field ",
    "theoretic treatment .",
    "another area where the non  linearities of the theory need to be probed , is in the reheating calculations associated with inflation .",
    "as the inflaton field evolves down its potential , eventually it moves out of the `` slow roll '' regime as it descends into the true minima of the potential .",
    "the traditional picture is that in this region as the field oscillates about this minima then it decays through coherent oscillations and reheats the universe , restoring the radiation dominated universe .",
    "recently though , this picture has been questioned @xcite . in order to fully probe this region of the potential ,",
    "it is important that the ansatz adopted for the scalar field is valid in this region .",
    "it is our belief that the usual hartree - fock approximations are not sufficient here and need to be improved .",
    "the method we outline in the rest of this paper is one possible way of improving the situation .",
    "use of the time ",
    "dependent variational principle of quantum mechanics is becoming more widespread .",
    "the method , first given by dirac , involves the construction of an ` effective action ' = dt i_t- , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 is the hamiltonian operator .",
    "@xmath7 is then made stationary @xmath8 against variations of the state @xmath9 subject to the constraint @xmath10 .",
    "approximate dynamics are obtained by positing a variational ansatz for the wavefunction which is a function of a small number of variables .",
    "central to the approach is the assumption that the ansatz for the variational wavefunction is ` close ' to the exact one ,  there are sufficient degrees of freedom for the wavefunction to accurately track the evolution of the system .    to date",
    "investigations have been restricted to the use of gaussian ansatzes since these are calculationally easy to handle .",
    "however we shall argue that the gaussian approach is of limited applicability and that results gained from it have a limited range of reliability .",
    "in order to elucidate our later calculations it is useful to consider this construction in generality . consider the variational effective action = dt i_t-= dt ( _ t- ( _ t ) ) -",
    "let us suppose the variational state to be a function of @xmath11 real parameters @xmath12 = dt ( - ) _ i- .",
    "when the action is made stationary with respect to variation of these parameters we obtain the induced equations of motion i_i -=0 .",
    "[ eoms ] schematically , this expression is of the form a_ij_j - b_i=0 implying that in order that we are able to extract the equations of motion for the parameter @xmath13 , the matrix @xmath14 must be non  singular throughout the evolution of the system .",
    "obviously thus far we have simply expressed the process one performs in arriving at the approximate equations of motion .",
    "however , given in this form , the equations of motion are simple to extract and the origin of possible singularities is highlighted .",
    "before we give the expression for the improved wavefunction let us make the definition u_n(x ) : =( ) ^h_n(x ) e^-^2 x^2/2 = ( 2g)^- . where @xmath15 is real and @xmath16 is the @xmath11th hermite polynomial .",
    "we see that the @xmath17 are a one parameter set of orthonormalized functions u_n(x )",
    "u_m(x ) dx = _ nm independent of the value of @xmath18 .",
    "we may thus use the @xmath17 as a basis for our variational wavefunction : ( x , t)=n e^ix^2_n=0^a_n u_n(x , t ) . here the @xmath19 are time dependent complex numbers , the other real variational parameters being @xmath20 and @xmath18 which implicitly appear in the definition of the @xmath17 .",
    "normalization is achieved by the inclusion of a time dependent @xmath21 .",
    "as it stands this represents no simplification .",
    "our plan of action is therefore to truncate the expansion at some finite order and work consistently to that order .",
    "the zeroth order approximation is simply the gaussian , hartree  fock approximation .    as a test bed for our method we will consider the case of a particle moving in the potential considered by cooper et al .",
    "@xcite , as this illustrates well the shortfalls of the gaussian approach . in a later paper",
    "the method will be applied to a wider range of systems .",
    "the potential we consider is of a double well , v(x)=(x^2-a^2)^2 with gaussian initial conditions @xmath22 , and @xmath23 is the symmetry breaking value for @xmath24 .    to demonstration of the power of the method",
    "we will only include the first non  trivial term in the expansion .",
    "since the potential and initial conditions are symmetric , the first non  trivial term involves @xmath25 = n e^ix^2(u_0(x , t)+a_2 u_2(x , t ) ) . even to this order we shall see that the improvement in the results over those of the gaussian approach is impressive .",
    "we shall compare the results obtained using the improved equations of motion with the exact results obtained via numerical simulation .",
    "working with a polar representation of @xmath26 , the equations of motion one obtains from are & = & 4 g - + & = & -2 ^ 2 + - - + & = & s g^2 + & = & - - where @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the increase in complexity of the result over that of the gaussian approach is more than compensated for by the increase in the accuracy of the results .",
    "we notice that the improved equations of motion have within them terms familiar from the gaussian approach",
    ". however , the hf equations of motion are not obtainable as a simple limit @xmath29 as the improved equations are singular in this limit .",
    "the origin of this singularity is as was outlined in section .    to assess the use of method we shall focus on the evolution of the quantity ^2 =",
    "it is clear that the equations of motion are singular for the gaussian initial conditions considered ; since our aim is a comparison of the results of the improved method with those of cooper et al , we shall adopt the same initial conditions .",
    "this apparent problem is easily circumvented .",
    "the rationale is to start the evolution of the system some short time after @xmath30 .",
    "we solve the exact schrdinger equation to first order and may then extract the values of @xmath31 and @xmath32 , using these as the initial conditions in the variational equations of motion . in actuality",
    "the subsequent evolution of the system is rather insensitive to the initial conditions .",
    "following @xcite , we take as the initial conditions _ 0(x)=(2g_0)^-e^-x^2/4g_0 where @xmath33    after a short time @xmath34 this evolves into ( x , t)=_0(x)-it _ 0(x ) which is the state we match onto .",
    "this procedure leads us to take r_0= _ 0=.",
    "the results of the above calculation are presented in figures [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] . plotted",
    "are the exact evolution of @xmath35 , found by numerical simulation , against the improved and gaussian results for the two values @xmath36 .",
    "it is clear that the improved method furnishes us with a result considerably closer to the exact evolution than does the gaussian .",
    "also we see that the improved method samples regions of the potential much closer to the minima than does the hf , the so  called spinodal regions , suggesting that more information about the potential is being taken into account .",
    "the gaussian wavefunction leads to a turning point of @xmath37 at @xmath38 @xcite , which provides an indication of where the ansatz breaks down . with the improved ansatz we find the turning point occurs typically at @xmath39 , demonstrating the significant increase in accuracy",
    "moreover , this approximate solution clearly probes the non - linear region of the potential .    behind this success",
    "is the crucial observation that the improved wavefunctions are capable of becoming bimodal in nature , something not open to the gaussian ansatz .",
    "this means that we have a method of investigating the field evolution during a defect forming transition and a first order transition .",
    "these cases are currently being analysed .",
    "perhaps the most promising aspect of this work is the possible extension to the field theoretic case .",
    "we may identify the hermite polynomials as the eigen  solutions of the harmonic oscillator . in field theory",
    "the analogous system is the massive free  field .",
    "the eigensolutions for this system are easily calculable and may then be used as a basis , as above .",
    "this work is on  going .",
