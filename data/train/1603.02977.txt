    "the power grid is designed to operate optimally at its nominal frequency ; furthermore , deviations from the nominal system frequency adversely affects the components of the power grid  @xcite , such as compensators and loads , resulting in harmful operating conditions that can propagate throughout the network .",
    "thus , making frequency stability as one of the most important factors in the assessment of power quality  @xcite .",
    "in addition , future envisioned smart grid technologies will incorporate distributed power generation based on renewable energy sources , where the wide - area grid can be divided into a number of smaller self - contained sections named micro - grids , with some micro - grids disconnecting from the wide - area grid for prolonged lengths of time , referred to as islanding  @xcite . therefore",
    ", monitoring the frequency information of the grid in real - time is an essential part of power distribution network control and management applications .",
    "the importance of frequency estimation in power grids has motivated the development of a variety of algorithms dedicated to this cause  @xcite-@xcite , where approaches based on kalman filtering have been shown to be advantageous due to their underlying state space assumption  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "however , these algorithms act as frequency measurement techniques and do not reveal any information about the dynamics of the system frequency which holds essential information about the power grid .",
    "for example , a rising system frequency indicates that power generation has surpassed power consumption and a falling system frequency is indicative that power consumption has exceeded power generation  @xcite,@xcite .",
    "although the voltage measurements from the three phases can be mapped onto the complex domain using the clarke transform , which allows for the use of well established complex - valued signal processing techniques , complex numbers lack the dimensionality necessary to model three - phase systems leading to partial loss of information specially under unbalanced operating conditions which negatively effects the performance complex - valued frequency estimators  @xcite .",
    "quaternions provide a natural presentation for three and four - dimensional signals and have gained popularity in an increasing number of engineering applications  @xcite-@xcite . in addition , the recent introduction of the @xmath0-calculus  @xcite and augmented quaternion statistics  @xcite-@xcite have led a resurgence in quaternion - valued signal processing and have inspired a number of quaternion - valued signal processing algorithms including a class of quaternion kalman filters  @xcite .    in this work",
    ", a novel two stage kalman filtering algorithm is developed for adaptive estimation of frequency and its rate of change in three - phase power systems .",
    "the first stage is consisted of a strictly linear quaternion extended kalman filter ( qekf ) that allows for the incorporation of the voltage measurements from all phases and estimates the instantaneous phase increment of the three - phase voltages .",
    "the instantaneous phase increment estimates from the first stage are then used as observations of a real - valued extended kalman filter ( ekf ) in the second stage that estimates the system frequency and its rate of change .",
    "moreover , a framework for accounting for the presence of harmonics in the power system is presented .",
    "the concept is verified through simulations on both synthetic data mirroring practical power grid scenarios and real - world data recordings .",
    "quaternions are a non - commutative division algebra denoted by @xmath1 .",
    "a quaternion variable @xmath2 consists of a real part @xmath3 and a three - dimensional imaginary part or pure quaternion , @xmath4 , which comprises three imaginary components @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 ; therefore , @xmath8 can be expressed as @xmath9 , where @xmath10 , while @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 are imaginary units obeying the product rules @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 .",
    "alternatively a quaternion @xmath2 can be expressed by the polar presentation given by @xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 moreover , it is straightforward to prove that the @xmath20 and @xmath21 functions can be expressed as @xmath22 where @xmath23 .",
    "the involution of @xmath24 around @xmath25 is defined as @xmath26  @xcite and can be used to express the real - valued components of a quaternion number , @xmath2 , as @xcite-@xcite,@xcite @xmath27 @xmath28 the quaternion conjugate is a special case of quaternion involutions and is defined as @xmath29 while the norm of @xmath2 is given by @xmath30 the expressions in ( [ eq : real - valued components ] ) establish a relation between the augmented quaternion variable , @xmath31^{t } \\in \\mathbb{h}^{4}$ ] , and the real - valued vector @xmath32^{t } \\in \\mathbb{r}^{4}$ ] .",
    "this duality between the real and quaternion domains forms the basis of the quaternion augmented statistics  @xcite-@xcite and the @xmath0-calculus  @xcite .",
    "the augmented quaternion statistics in conjunction with the @xmath0-calculus have led to the development of a class of quaternion kalman filters including the strictly linear qekf  @xcite that operates akin to its complex - valued counterpart , with the difference that the jacobian of the state evolution function is calculated by the @xmath0-calculus .",
    "for instance , @xmath33 , which is a consequence of ( [ eq : quaternion conjugate ] ) and is in contrast with the results in the complex domain .",
    "the instantaneous voltages of each phase in a three - phase power system are given by @xmath34 where @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 are the instantaneous amplitudes , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 represent the instantaneous phases , and @xmath41 is the sampling interval with @xmath42 denoting the sampling frequency , while @xmath43 denotes the system frequency at time instant @xmath44 .",
    "considering that the dynamic changes in system frequency can be modeled as a time varying function given by @xmath45 ; then , taking the taylor series expansion yields @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the rate of change of the system frequency , while the higher order terms are denoted by @xmath48 and are assumed to be sufficiently small for the system frequency to be approximated by the first order regression ) if further information about the dynamics of the system frequency is required . ]",
    "@xmath49 taking into account the linear regressions in ( [ eq : freq - rec ] ) a state space model for the system frequency that can be implemented using the real - valued ekf is proposed in algorithm  [ al : f - ss ] , where @xmath50 and @xmath51 denote the state evolution and observation noise .",
    "state evolution equation : @xmath52 + observation equation : @xmath53 [ al : f - ss ]    the three phase voltages in ( [ eq : phase voltages ] ) are now combined together to generate the pure quaternion signal @xmath54 since all three phases have the same frequency , analytical geometry dictates that @xmath55 will trace an ellipse in a subspace ( one plane ) of the three - dimensional imaginary subspace of  @xmath1  @xcite . in order to simplify our analysis",
    "we consider the the set of imaginary bases @xmath56 such that @xmath57 and the imaginary units @xmath58 are designed to reside in the same plane as @xmath55 , resulting in @xmath59 being normal to this plane . in our previous work we show that an arbitrary ellipse in the @xmath60 plane can then be divided into two counter rotating circular components @xmath61 and @xmath62 , which can be expressed by the corresponding fist order quaternion linear regressions  @xcite @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the phase increment of @xmath61 and @xmath62 between time instances @xmath44 and @xmath65 .",
    "taking into account the linear regressions in ( [ eq : quaternion regressive ] ) , a state space model for @xmath55 is proposed in algorithm  [ al : q - ss ] , where @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the state evolution and observation noise .",
    "note that algorithm  [ al : q - ss ] can be implemented using the strictly linear qekf presented in  @xcite .",
    "state evolution equation : @xmath69 + observation equation : @xmath70 + estimate of phase increment : @xmath71 + [ al : q - ss ]    since the kalman filter is an unbiased estimator , it is straightforward to show @xmath72 is an unbiased estimate of the phase increment ; furthermore , assuming that @xmath67 and @xmath51 are gaussian variables , makes it possible to model the estimate of the phase increment as @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is real - valued white gaussian noise .",
    "therefore , the relation between the phase increment , estimated in algorithm  [ al : q - ss ] and the observation equation in algorithm  [ al : f - ss ] given by @xmath75 allows the system frequency and its rate of change to be estimated simultaneously through the use of algorithm  [ al : f - ss ] in series with algorithm  [ al : q - ss ] in the fashion shown in figure  [ fig : schematic1 ] .",
    "harmonic contamination is a major cause of error in power system frequency estimators and therefore it is crucial to present a framework for accounting for the presence of the main harmonic components . in this setting ,",
    "the estimate of the system frequency is used as feedback in order to estimate the signal component at @xmath76-times the main frequency .",
    "this is achieved through the use of multiple qekf connected in parallel as shown in figure  [ fig : schematic2 ] , where each qekf is implementing the state space model in algorithm  [ al : q - ss ] .",
    "the process is summarized in algorithm  [ al : qfe ] , where @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 are the _ a priori _ state estimate , _ a posteriori _ state estimate , the jacobian of the state evolution equation , and the covariance matrix of the state evolution noise at time instant @xmath44 for the qekf estimating the @xmath81 harmonic component , while @xmath80 is covariance matrix of the observation noise , with @xmath82 $ ] denoting the observation function .",

    "+ update the phase incrementing element : @xmath89 [ al : qfe ]",
    "the performance of the newly developed algorithm was validated in different experiments , where the sampling frequency was @xmath90 and the voltage measurements were considered to be corrupted by white gaussian noise with signal to noise ratio of @xmath91db .    in the first experiment ,",
    "the three - phase system was considered to be operating under balanced conditions , at its nominal frequency of @xmath92 , and free of harmonics ; then suffered a voltage sag characterized by an @xmath93% fall in the amplitude of @xmath94 and @xmath95 degree phase shifts in @xmath96 and @xmath97 ; furthermore , the voltage sag resulted in the introduction of a balanced @xmath98% third harmonic component and a @xmath99hz fall in system frequency .",
    "the estimates of the system frequency obtained at the first and second stages of the developed algorithm are shown in figure  [ fig : jump ] .",
    "notice that the developed algorithm accurately estimated the system frequency under both balanced and unbalanced conditions regardless of the presence of the third harmonic .    in the second experiment , a three - phase system operating under the same unbalanced condition and harmonic contamination as the previous experiment , experienced a rising ( _ cf_. falling ) frequency at the rate of @xmath100 due to mismatch between power generation and consumption @xmath101 seconds after simulation started .",
