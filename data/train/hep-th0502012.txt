    "the study of field theories in noncommutative space has attracted a great deal of attention ( see for example , the review @xcite ) after it was revealed that low - energy description of string theory in the presence of a constant ns - ns @xmath0-field background gives rise to a certain class of field theory on noncommutative space @xcite with commutation relations @xmath1 = i \\th^{\\m\\n}$ ] .",
    "one of the important problems in the study of noncommutative field theories is to understand how to define observable quantities , see for example @xcite for discussions about the construction of the energy - momentum tensor , and @xcite for the construction of gauge invariant observable in noncommutative gauge theory . in noncommutative space , locality is broken and it is not clear whether one can define local physical quantities in general .    in commutative field theories , microcausality enables us to define local observables . also , microcausality is one of the basic assumptions leading to the notion of s - matrix .",
    "the study of microcausality will help us understand better the notion of locality in noncommutative field theory .",
    "in noncommutative space , translational invariance is intact .",
    "however lorentz symmetry is broken down to a smaller sub - group .",
    "this fact leads the authors of @xcite to argue that the notion of a light cone is generally modified to that of a light wedge .",
    "a modified microcausality condition was proposed which state that @xmath2_\\pm = 0 , \\mbox{if $ ( x^0)^2 - ( \\vx_c)^2 < 0$},\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is for fermionic ( or bosonic ) fields and @xmath4 includes only the commutative space direction . the relation between violation of causality and unitarity was studied in @xcite .",
    "another version where the commutator is replaced by a star - commutator has also been proposed in @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite where microcausality condition for composite operators has been studied .",
    "several properties of noncommutative field theories such as cpt theorem @xcite , spectral relations and dispersion relations of the s - matrix @xcite have been studied with a modified microcausality condition adapted for a light wedge .",
    "attempts to study noncommutative field theories from an axiomatic approach have also been made @xcite .",
    "although the argument based on the spacetime symmetry generally allows the causal region to be enlarged to the light wedge , it is still necessary to study the causal structure in concrete models and see if and how the light cone is modified .",
    "for example , we may consider a commutative theory in @xmath5 @xmath6 if we consider the case in which only @xmath7 , then the lorentz symmetry is broken to @xmath8 .",
    "one may expect that the light wedge will arise too due to the general analysis of @xcite .",
    "however as will be clear from our analysis below , microcausality condition is still given by the usual light cone for the theory ( [ lor ] ) .",
    "the crucial difference between a noncommutative theory and a generic lorentz symmetry broken theory lies in the _ nonlocality _ of noncommutative interaction .",
    "this important aspect was missing in the general argument of @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we study the microcausality in a concrete model , the noncommutative @xmath9 theory . in section 2",
    ", we show that due to the phase factor characteristic of the nonplanar diagram , the light cone is modified to the light wedge in perturbative computation .",
    "also it will be clear from our computation that this modification is generic and holds for general noncommutative field theory . in section 3",
    "we study the energy conditions in noncommutative field theories and show that their usual form is violated .",
    "this is consistent with our result in section 2 .",
    "discussion and conclusions are made in section 4 .",
    "for a vector @xmath10 , we use the notation @xmath11 to denote its spatial part .",

    "it can also be verified that there is no pole enclosed when the integration path is rotated .",
    "thus we can rotate the contours of the integration to the imaginary axes as follows without getting any extra contribution : [ contour - rot ] & & q_i^+ i q_i^+ , + & & q_i^+ -i q_i^+ . and",

    "therefore @xmath35 vanishes if the first term of ( [ comm ] ) is finite , i.e. , @xmath66 as we showed above , @xmath42 grows at most polynomially with @xmath51 , thus the integral converges at large @xmath51 if @xmath59 . for small @xmath51 , we have the damping factor ( @xmath67 since the theory is not tachyonic ) in the exponent , thus the integral converges also at @xmath68 .",
    "therefore we obtain the result that , up to order @xmath69 , the light cone is not modified by interaction .",
    "we remark that at the tree level , the matrix element takes a similar form .",
    "see ( [ com - tree ] ) .",
    "in fact the form ( [ m2-b ] ) and ( [ g ] ) is quite general and universal .",

    "can be applied and one arrives at the same light cone .",
    "the generalization to theory with more couplings and masses is straightforward .",
    "[ higher - order ]      we now turn to the noncommutative case .",
    "since theory with noncommutativity in time has problem with unitarity @xcite , see also @xcite , we will consider spatial noncommutativity we can choose the light cone direction to be commutative .",

    "the planar parts give exactly the same terms ( apart from numerical coefficient ) as the commutative case .",

    "thus for large @xmath51 , the integral factor @xmath82 contributes @xmath110 for each subspace of @xmath111 with non - zero noncommutativity .",
    "this is in contrast to the commutative case where the dependence on @xmath51 is subdominant compared to that of @xmath54 .",
    "because of ( [ hnc ] ) , the large @xmath51 behaviour of @xmath112 will be modified .",

    "now we can repeat the same argument as in the commutative case : @xmath117 thus we see that the light cone ( @xmath118 ) is modified to light wedge ( @xmath119 ) in order for the commutator to be zero .",
    "[ uni ]    a couple of remarks are in order .",
    "* in the above , we have done the computation using a normal ordered vertex .",
    "however this point is inessential .",
    "if we use a vertex without normal ordering , then we will get additional terms as shown in figure 3 .",
    "these diagrams arise from the self - contractions of the vertex and will give additional contributions to @xmath35 .",
    "however it is easy to see that there will not be any noncommutative phase factor involved for these terms .",
    "because of this , they will not modify the microcausality condition . the modification to the microcausality condition arises solely from the nonplanar diagrams in figure 1 . *",
    "another effect of nonlocality in noncommutative field theory is the emergence of ir singularity from integrating out uv degree of freedoms .",
    "this mixing of scales is called ir / uv mixing phenomena @xcite .",
    "ir / uv mixing implies a breakdown of the standard wilsonian effective description .",
    "ir / uv mixing may also results in instability of the perturbative vacuum .",
    "this happens for example for the case of noncommutative qed @xcite and for the @xmath9 theory @xcite we considered .",
    "theory suffers also from the usual instability that it does not has a stable vacuum .",
    "however this is a separate issue . ]",
    "since the vacuum is unstable , in principle our perturbative analysis is not valid .",
    "however our analysis can be straightforwardly extended to other theory where this is not a problem , for example @xmath120 in 4-dimension .",
    "it is clear from our analysis above that the modification of the light cone to light wedge is due to the inclusion of the noncommutative phase factor @xmath121 which appears in ( [ hnp ] ) for the nonplanar diagram . for the @xmath120 theory",
    ", there will be a different @xmath53 .",
    "however the precise form of @xmath53 is unimportant for our argument . our analysis above go through .",
    "therefore we conclude that the modification from light cone to light wedge is quite general and is valid even if there is ir / uv mixing so long as the ir / uv mixing effect does not result in instability of the vacuum . *",
    "obviously supersymmetrizing the theory will not change our result . again having more particles circulating in the loop",
    "will only modify the form of the function @xmath53 , which is not important for our argument . * using the equations ( [ m - gen ] ) and ( [ g - gen ] ) , our analysis can be readily generalized to higher order .",
    "in general a noncommutative phase factor will appear for the nonplanar diagrams .",
    "for those nonplanar diagrams which has a phase factor which intertwines the momenta in the set @xmath73 in ( [ g - gen ] ) , our analysis can be applied straightforwardly and the light wedge is obtained .",
    "for example for the planar contribution in figure 2 , we have the noncommutative counterpart in figure 4 which give rise to the light wedge due to the phase factor @xmath122 associated with the diagram .",
    "* theory with lightlike noncommutativity is unitary perturbatively @xcite and presents another interesting case . for the case",
    "say @xmath123 , one quantize the theory using the light cone time @xmath124 as the time coordinate .",
    "since @xmath125 , the theory is local in the light cone time and the operator formalism is well defined .",
    "our analysis can be applied directly and we find @xmath126 this implies that the commutator vanishes only for @xmath127 .",
    "this agrees precisely with the galilean spacetime symmetry which is in residual in the presence of @xmath128 .",
    "[ higher - order - np ]    in conclusion , our analysis and result is applicable to general noncommutative theories , so long as the theory admits nonplanar diagrams and the perturbative vacuum is not instabilized by the ir / uv mixing effect .",
    "another way to study the causality issue is to consider energy condition . for review ,",
    "see @xcite , also @xcite . for applications in string theory , see for example @xcite .",
    "let us first consider the dominant energy condition in details .",
    "the discussion for the other energy conditions is similar .",
    "an energy - momentum tensor @xmath129 is said to satisfy the dominant energy condition if for every future directed time like vector @xmath130 , @xmath131 is future directed , time like or null .",
    "one can show that when it is satisfied , the velocity of the energy - flow can not exceed the speed of light .    to warm up ,",
    "let us first consider an example in commutative theory @xmath132 with @xmath133 .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor is given by @xmath134 we now show that the dominant energy condition is satisfied if @xmath135 .",
    "let @xmath130 be timelike : @xmath136 and future directed : @xmath137",
    ". then @xmath138 and @xmath139 thus @xmath140 if @xmath141 .",
    "for example , if @xmath142 and @xmath143 . as for @xmath144",
    ", we have @xmath145   t^0 + \\del_0 \\phi \\del_i t^i .\\ ] ] @xmath146 future directed and timelike implies @xmath147 . if @xmath135 also , then @xmath148   + \\del_0 \\phi \\del_i t^i >",
    "|\\del_0 \\phi| \\biggl [ |\\bt| |\\del_i \\phi| \\pm t^i \\del_i \\phi   \\biggr ] \\geq 0\\ ] ] is future directed .",
    "now consider the noncommutative @xmath120 theory @xmath149 alternatively , we can also consider the lagrangian which gives the same action @xmath150 first , we need to construct the symmetric and conserved energy - momentum tensor .",
    "this problem has been considered in @xcite and the authors found that they can not be satisfied simultaneously . here",
    "we show that one can construct such an energy - momentum tensor if one allow it to be path - dependent .",
    "this is also the case in noncommutative yang - mills theory @xcite .",
    "we define the energy momentum tensor @xmath151.\\label{em1}\\ ] ] here the integration is carried out along an arbitrary path @xmath152 connecting from a reference point @xmath153 to @xmath154 .",
    "obviously , @xmath155 and also @xmath156 is real . using equation of motion , it is easy to verify that @xmath157 for the alternative choice of the lagrangian ( [ action2 ] ) , we can consider the path - dependent energy - momentum tensor @xmath158.\\label{em2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] again , it is easy to show that @xmath156 is real , symmetric and conserved .",
    "let us now check the dominant energy condition in the noncommutative case .",
    "note that ( [ em1 ] ) is of the same form as ( [ tmn ] ) .",
    "thus we arrive at ( [ uu1 ] ) and ( [ uu2 ] ) again .",
    "however now the analogy of @xmath159 is given by the path - dependent terms in ( [ em1 ] ) and ( [ em2 ] ) and they are not positive definite for non - zero noncommutativity .",
    "one can also show that ( [ em2 ] ) does not satisfy the dominant energy condition .",
    "it is straightforward to generalize the argument for other noncommutative field theories .",
    "therefore we conclude that the dominant energy condition is generally violated in noncommutative theory .",
    "it is also easy to verify that none of the standard form of energy condition ( e.g. null , strong , weak ) are satisfied . on the other hand ,",
    "if we naively integrating out the whole noncommutative subspace , then energy conditions are satisfied .",
    "this is reminiscent of the averaged energy condition @xcite .    given that the causal structure of the noncommutative theory is modified , it is not surprising that the usual form of energy condition is violated .",
    "the real challenge and really interesting problem is to derive the appropriate generalization of the energy condition for noncommutative spacetime .",
    "in this paper , we have shown that the causality condition in noncommutative field theory is generally modified from a light cone to a light wedge .",
    "the phase factor @xmath160 in ( [ j ] ) , which arises due to the nonlocal nature of the noncommutative interaction , is crucial to modify the large @xmath51 behaviour of the kernel @xmath82 and hence the modified causality condition .",
    "in contrast , a local lorentz symmetry breaking interaction will generally not modify the light cone .",
    "nonlocality of interaction plays the key role .",
    "see also @xcite for other considerations on how noncommutative geometry may modify the causality condition .    based on the modified dispersion relation in the noncommutative theory at nonzero temperature , the authors of @xcite show that the low momenta modes have superluminous group velocity .",
    "the authors of @xcite constructed and studied the classical dynamics of solitons in noncommutative gauge theories .",
    "they found that these solitons can travel with speed faster than light ( with no upper bound in the noncommutative direction ) .",
    "however as these authors argued , since one can not send information backward in time , so this does not violate causality .",
    "one may also deduce the light wedge in this setting .",
    "our result of having the light cone changed to the light wedge is consistent with their result .",
    "however the analysis and result here is more general since it applies without the need of specific modified dispersion relation nor of the existence and the construction of solitons with specific properties .    in @xcite , a new form of wightman functions , which are defined as vacuum expectation value of star - product of fields ,",
    "have been considered .",
    "the motivation was that the new form of wightman functions contain the noncommutativity explicitly .",
    "on the other hand , as the authors argued , on applying the reconstruction theorem the usual wightman functions will lead to commutative field theory ( which are invariant under the smaller lorentz group ) , but not to noncommutative field theory since there is no trace of the noncommutativity parameter @xmath161 in the usual wightman function .",
    "we remark that this is not the case .",
    "the wightman functions can depend on @xmath161 just as they depends on the coupling constants .",
    "this can be easily demonstrated in perturbation theory , as is clear from our calculations .",
    "also the authors proposed another form of microcausality condition where the star - commutator of fields vanishes at separation which is spacelike with respect to the light wedge .",
    "we note that , due to momentum conservation , it is @xmath162{|\\b \\rangle } =   { \\langle \\a| } [ \\phi(x_1),\\phi(x_2)]_*{|\\b \\rangle},\\ ] ] for states @xmath163 with the same momentum .",
    "thus as far as matrix elements of the above type are of concern , there is no difference in considering the standard commutator or the star - commutator .",
    "the usual commutator is smart enough to know about the modified causality condition in noncommutative geometry .",
    "as we explained , the emergence of the modified causality condition is characteristic of noncommutative geometry and is generic and independent of the details of the type of noncommutative interaction .",
    "one can expect that this drastic change of the notion of causality to be a rather clear phenomenological signal for noncommutative geometry .",
    "see for example @xcite for some discussions of the phenomenological aspect of noncommutative field theory . if the universe was noncommutative at the early stage , region that one would traditionally taken to be not in causal contact ( outside the light cone ) may indeed be causally related according to the light wedge .",
    "this may offer an alternative scenario to inflation for explaining the horizon problem of the universe .",
    "for other applications of noncommutative geometry to cosmology , see for example @xcite .    in this paper , we have seen that nonlocality of noncommutative geometry leads to a modification of the light cone .",
    "string theory is another nonlocal theory .",
    "the effect of interaction on the string light cone @xcite has been studied in @xcite for the case of flat string theory and @xcite for the pp - wave string theory .",
    "the result is that the light cone is modified in the flat case , but not in the pp - wave case @xcite .",
    "this is related to the fact that the pp - wave 3-string interaction is more localized compared to the flat space 3-string interaction .",
    "it is important to identify and understand better the nonlocal effects in string theory .",
    "this should help us to understand better the nature of the theory of quantum gravity , which is believed to be nonlocal also .",
    "the modification of the light cone in noncommutative field theory is intriguing .",
    "as far as causality is of concern , no trace of the noncommutative coordinates enter .",
    "our result suggests that a reformulation of the noncommutative theory in terms of one living in lower dimensional spacetime maybe able to capture the causal aspects of the physics more accurately .",
    "this possibility of formulation in terms of lower dimensional degree of freedom reminds us of the holographic property of quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "the dynamical reduction of spacetime dimensions at short distance scale is also seen in the very interesting recent works @xcite . since quantum gravity effects",
    "is believed to quantize the spacetime and make it noncommutative , noncommutativity geometry may play a key role in explaining holography .",

    "<S> we analyse the causality condition in noncommutative field theory and show that the nonlocality of noncommutative interaction leads to a modification of the light cone to the light wedge . </S>",
    "<S> this effect is generic for noncommutative geometry . </S>",
    "<S> we also check that the usual form of energy condition is violated and propose that a new form is needed in noncommutative spacetime . on reduction from light cone to light wedge , it looks like the noncommutative dimensions are effectively washed out and suggests a reformulation of noncommutative field theory in terms of lower dimensional degree of freedom . this reduction of dimensions due to noncommutative geometry could play a key role in explaining the holographic property of quantum gravity . </S>"
