    "<S> we present a detailed study of the coupling - constant - averaged exchange - correlation hole density at a jellium surface , which we obtain in the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) of many - body theory . </S>",
    "<S> we report contour plots of the exchange - only and exchange - correlation hole densities , the integration of the exchange - correlation hole density over the surface plane , the on - top correlation hole , and the energy density . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the on - top correlation hole is accurately described by local and semilocal density - functional approximations . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that for electrons that are localized far outside the surface the main part of the corresponding exchange - correlation hole is localized at the image plane . </S>"
