    "quasars , the most luminous active galactic nuclei ( agns erg s@xmath2 , we refer to them as quasars ( qsos ) . ] ) , have been linked to galaxies with active star formation ( sf ) ever since the discovery of their observational connection to ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs , galaxies more luminous than @xmath3 , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "one well - studied scenario for massive galaxy evolution posits that gas - rich galaxy major mergers trigger both rapid supermassive black hole ( smbh ) accretion and intense sf . this scenario associates the dust - enshrouded starburst with strong nuclear obscuration that is later expelled by the powerful agn , implying an evolutionary link between unobscured ( type 1 ) and obscured ( type 2 ) quasars ( e.g. *",

    "on the other hand , the `` unification model '' of agn ascribes obscuration of agns to different lines of sight through a dusty `` torus '' surrounding the smbh ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "this model predicts no difference in host galaxy properties between obscured and unobscured agns . to date , it is still a matter of debate whether the obscuration in luminous quasars can be explained solely by the orientation - based unification model or if it is also enhanced due to dust on larger scales throughout the host galaxy .",
    "several studies have shown results supporting a scenario departing from the unification model , such as the enhanced sf activity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) and the more disturbed structure ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) of the host galaxies of dust - obscured quasars when compared to unobscured quasars .",
    "clustering of different types of agns have also shown that obscured agns are more strongly clustered than unobscured agns ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , other studies have found no significant difference between obscured and unobscured agn populations in their morphological and sf properties ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "nonetheless , the measurements of sf properties for quasar host galaxies still suffer from selection biases that are often different among various quasar populations .",
    "in particular , optical and x - ray selected quasar samples might have different completeness in obscured and unobscured sources due to the attenuation of optical and x - ray radiation by dust and gas .",
    "in fact , some studies have suggested that optical surveys might miss @xmath4 of the agn population due to both the obscuration and host galaxy contamination in low - luminosity agns ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . while current x - ray observations probing photons with energy at @xmath5 kev are believed to be less affected by moderate levels of obscuring materials ( @xmath6@xmath7 ) , a significant fraction of x - ray agns ( @xmath8 , e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "although very hard x - ray photons can penetrate compton - thick obscuration , the previous high energy x - ray surveys are limited to local sources due to the shallow flux limits ( e.g. _ swift / bat _ , @xcite and _ integral _ , @xcite ) . while the _ nustar _ @xcite mission opened a new window of high energy x - ray up to 80 kev , the recent studies that used _",
    "nustar _ to observe heavily obscured agns have found that obscuration is still a non - negligible effect even for x - ray photons at such high energy @xcite .",
    "in contrast , mid - ir observations of the reprocessed emission from the obscuring dust can detect heavily obscured agns .",
    "a number of studies have shown that large populations of agns can be selected using the power - law sed shape of agns at mid - ir wavelengths ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) or agns with complicated silicate features in their mid - ir sed @xcite , they are effective in selecting both obscured and unobscured agns with similar completeness in mid - ir wavelengths .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which can easily be explained by the different level of extinction in the optical emission from the nucleus ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "* h07 hereafter ) .",
    "therefore , a direct comparison of the host galaxy sf properties of obscured and unobscured sources in a mid - ir selected quasar sample can provide insights to the origin of obscurations in rapidly accreting smbhs .    in this work , we adopt the mid - ir selected quasar sample from ( * ? ? ?",

    "we also take advantage of this sample to study the correlation between star formation and agn accretion for the mid - ir qsos . in galaxy evolution models which suggest that the concurrent growth of agn and host galaxy occurs during the dust enshrouded galaxy merger phase ,",
    "different types of quasars represent different stages of galaxy evolution . to date",

    "the difference between observed correlations could be driven by various limitations and observational constraints such as sample size @xcite or agn intrinsic variability ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "in addition , it is also important to note that agns selected with different criteria are hosted by very different host galaxy populations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) in which the galaxy and smbh might follow different evolutionary paths .",
    "the sample in this work consists of a large number of luminous qsos including both the unobscured and heavily obscured populations , thus biases due to small number statistics and the exclusion of dust - enshrouded agns are small .",
    "the bias in the observed sfr - agn accretion rate relation in agn host galaxies due to short - term agn accretion rate stochasticity may also be less significant in luminous quasars @xcite .",
    "therefore , the sfr - agn accretion rate correlation for the mid - ir selected quasar populations may shed light on the origin of the concurrent growth of smbh and galaxy .",

    "the agns in this work is drawn from the quasar sample of h11 , which is a subset of quasars from the h07 mid - ir agn sample .",
    "the h07 agns were identified based on the irac color - color selection criterion of @xcite . for the redshift range of the h07 sample ( @xmath40 ) , the irac filters probe wavelengths at which the characteristic power - law continuum from the reprocessed agn radiation starts to dominate . at these wavelengths , the light from old stellar populations",
    "is characterized by a rayleigh - jeans tail of a blackbody radiation with temperature higher than 2500k , which peaks at wavelengths different than both the agn accretion disk and the reprocessed agn emission .",
    "in addition , dust emission at near - sublimation temperature heated by the agn is significantly stronger than that heated by massive stars , thus agns can be easily identified with their mid - ir color ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "these reprocessed photons at mid - ir wavelengths are less affected by obscuration than the optical and the x - ray photons due to their much smaller absorption cross section .",
    "therefore , even heavily obscured agns can be identified using mid - ir selection criteria .",
    "an important feature of the h07 catalog is that the agns were selected from the irac shallow survey ( iss , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which has shallower flux limits than the later sdwfs survey . while the @xcite agn selection can be contaminated by sf galaxies in deep mid - ir surveys ( e.g. *",

    "h07 also showed that the distribution of the optical ( _ r _ ) band to mid - ir ( @xmath41 ) colors is bimodal for the luminous mid - ir quasars .",
    "this bimodality can be easily explained by the difference between the seds of unobscured and obscured quasars . for mid - ir selected quasars",
    ", the agn dominates the mid - ir wavelengths , while for obscured quasars , the nuclear emission at optical wavelengths is heavily absorbed .",
    "thus the sed in the _ r _ band for obscured quasars is similar to those of normal galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "this empirical classification based on the quasar mid - ir to optical color has been shown to be broadly consistent with both the spectroscopically classified sources @xcite and x - ray hardness ratio ( defined as @xmath48 where h and s are the photon counts in the @xmath49 kev band and 0.52 kev band , respectively ) classification criteria @xcite .",
    "since we lack spectroscopic confirmation for the majority of the qso2s , it is possible that the qso2s are different than the optical type 2 quasars .",
    "recently , @xcite have also studied the optical and near - ir spectroscopy of mid - ir agns selected using the @xcite irac color criteria , and found that a significant fraction ( @xmath50 ) of the agns with evident mid - ir power - law continuum have no significant emission lines consistent with the optical emission line diagnostics ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , suggesting that these mid - ir obscured agns are more deeply obscured than the optically selected type 2 agns .",
    "this has also been suggested by the recent study of @xcite .      to minimize the uncertainty in the measurements of quasar and host galaxy properties due to the scattering in the _ photo - z_s , we focus on the h11 quasar sample , which is a subsample from h07 .",

    "since the purpose of this work is to compare the star formation properties of qso1s and qso2s , it is important to make sure that any difference in sf properties is not driven by the presence of starburst galaxy interlopers .",
    "also , even for bright mid - ir quasars the starburst contribution in the mir may be non - negligible .",

    "we do not exclude the sources outside of the updated agn selection wedge , since these sources might still have a non - negligible agn component which can be identified by the sed fits . however , we note the exclusion of this small fraction of sources has little effect on the average properties of the qsos .",

    "individually x - ray detected sources with the average @xmath175 for the non - detected sources from stacking , we obtain the average x - ray luminosities in table 2 .",
    "these x - ray luminosities are the observed values and are not corrected for absorption .",
    "we also list the median extinction @xmath179 of the agn template at optical wavelengths from the sed fitting results ( see  4 ) . for heavily obscured agns , the sed at optical wavelengths can be dominated by the host galaxy , and the average @xmath179 may be a lower limit .",
    "however , we do find a much larger value of @xmath179 for far - ir detected qso1s than that for far - ir non - detected qso1s , which implies that the presence of star - forming dust attenuates both the optical and x - ray agn emission .",
    "we can also use the total numbers of stacked hard - band ( @xmath49 kev ) and soft - band ( 0.52 kev ) photons to obtain the hardness ratio for different qso subsamples .",
    "we find that for qso1s , the hr remains a constant @xmath180 for both the far - ir detected and far - ir non - detected subsamples . while for qso2s , the hr for both the far - ir detected and far - ir non - detected subsamples are also very similar ( @xmath181 ) . the large difference in the hr between qso1s and qso2s is consistent with the typical hr values for type i and type ii x - ray agns , which has been demonstrated in h07 .",
    "however , we here point out that the average hardness ratio is insensitive to the presence of far - ir emitting dust .",
    "the uniform hrs for far - ir detected and far - ir non - detected qso2s might simply be due to the wide redshift distribution from which the stacked sources are drawn from , since the uncertainties of the measured hrs corresponds to more than 0.3 dex in @xmath182 ( @xmath183 @xmath7 , e.g. fig .",
    "15 in h07 ) for the redshift range of our sample .",
    "however , the hardness ratios for the far - ir detected and far - ir non - detected qso1s are both consistent with little or no neutral gas absorption , which can not explain the large @xmath175 difference between far - ir qso1s and far - ir non - detected qso1s .",
    "therefore , the constant hr regardless of the presence of strong far - ir emissions might imply that the lower average @xmath184 and the higher @xmath179 in far - ir detected subsamples are due to gas of large column density that obscures x - ray photons in both hard - band and soft - band .",
    "we note that large columns of ionized gas residing within 10pc of the vicinity of the x - ray emitting corona might also absorb both the hard - band and soft - band photons without altering the observed hr . as demonstrated in various studies of x - ray spectral models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the observed hardness ratio is a much weaker function of the column density of the ionized warm absorber when compared to a neutral , cold absorber .",
    "this specific type of absorption has been observed in qsos hosted by extremely luminous submillimeter galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , similar to the luminous sf galaxies hosting qso2s in this work .",
    "however , whether the same type of warm absorber exists in our far - ir detected qsos can not be confirmed without high - resolution x - ray spectroscopy .",

    "[ fig : lxl6um ] , where we show the ratio between @xmath185 and @xmath186 for different subsamples of qsos .",
    "since @xmath175 and @xmath187 are both excellent tracers of smbh accretion and @xmath187 is relatively insensitive to obscuration , the @xmath184 to @xmath187 ratio has been used to track down the elusive population of compton - thick agns and to study the intrinsic agn accretion rate ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "[ fig : lxl6um ] , we show that for both qso1s and qso2s , the existence of a far - ir detection is connected with smaller @xmath188 ratios by at least 0.2 dex when compared to the far - ir non - detected subsamples .",
    "this indirectly supports a link between far - ir emitting dust and the absorption of x - ray photons .",

    "the x - ray hardness ratio of the qso1 sample is consistent with little or no x - ray absorption , suggesting that the different @xmath188 ratios for qsos and the x - ray selected agns @xcite observed are not simply due to the difference in gas absorption .",

    "we find that the @xmath188 of our far - ir detected qso2s is consistent with the @xcite relation derived from attenuating the x - ray luminosities for the @xmath188 relation of local agns @xcite with compton - thick material .",
    "however , recent observations have also discovered several luminous agns with extremely weak x - ray emissions even in the ultra - hard energy bands probed by nustar @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is still unclear whether the low @xmath188 ratio for the qso2s is due to compton - thick obscuration or intrinsic x - ray weakness . nonetheless , the low @xmath188 for far - ir detected qso2s is another line of evidence indicating that x - ray agn selection methods can miss heavily obscured mid - ir qsos hosted by galaxies with active sf activity .",
    "we caution that all agn selection criteria suffer from various different selection biases , especially the incompleteness due to obscuration and the contamination from sf galaxy interlopers .",
    "we reiterate that sf galaxy contamination with our mid - ir color selection criteria is relatively mild for the shallow mid - ir flux limits of our sample .",
    "our result demonstrates the advantage of mid - ir agn selection criteria in detecting deeply obscured quasars hosted by powerful sf galaxies .",
    "in  5 and  6 we have shown that mid - ir selected qso2s reside in galaxies with more active sf and that their agns are more obscured at both optical and x - ray wavelengths . while these results support the connection between agn obscuration and star formation in the qso host galaxies , we next directly test the connection between quasar obscuration and galaxy sf with the measurement of the `` obscured fraction '' as a function of @xmath74 .",
    "we show this result in fig .",
    "[ fig : obsfrac ] . for the far - ir detected qsos , where @xmath74 can be more accurately estimated , we separate the sources into two bins of @xmath74 with equal number of sources in each bin . for",
    "the qsos with @xmath74 estimated from stacked far - ir fluxes , the @xmath74 suffer from larger uncertainties .",
    "therefore , we do not group these qsos based on their @xmath74 but only evaluate obscured fractions for the entire populations .",
    "we find that the obscured fraction of the far - ir detected qsos is much higher than that of the rest of qsos , and the obscured fraction increases monotonically with respect to @xmath144 as @xmath192 .",
    "this agrees with a scenario which connects the obscuration in powerful quasars to the host galaxy star formation , as the agn unification model do not predict an increased obscured fraction for qsos hosted by galaxies with higher @xmath193 .",
    "in this work , we have demonstrated that the star formation properties of qso1s and qso2s are different , which implies a link between star - forming dust and agn obscuration in quasars . to verify the observed difference between qso1s and qso2",
    "is not driven by the uncertainty of photometric redshifts of qso2s and the presence of starburst contaminations , we perform several tests on the qso1 sample and use the spectroscopically confirmed agns as a benchmark of how the various uncertainties might affect the observed properties of qso2s .",
    "we reiterate that the sources with a dominating starburst component have been removed from the final sample studied in this analysis based on the sed fits discussed in  3 .",
    "therefore , the higher far - ir detection fraction for qso2s is not due to the inclusion of starburst interlopers in the mid - ir agn sample .",
    "another possible issue that can drive the higher far - ir detection fraction for the qso2s is the _ photo - z _  uncertainties .",
    "we here examine this issue by testing the null hypothesis that qso1s and qso2s have exactly the same far - ir detection fraction and redshift distribution .    from the ages catalog ,",
    "we select all of the sources with broad emission lines ( the blagns ) . in the ages catalog",
    "there are a total of 1619 blagns of which 181 of them have a spire @xmath10 flux greater than 20 mjy .",
    "this far - ir detection fraction is similar to that for the qso1 sample . to test",
    "if the uncertainties in photometric redshifts can boost the far - ir detection fraction , we randomly scatter the redshifts for all blagns with the conservative uncertainty of @xmath38 ( discussed in  2.1 ) . in each random realization , we select the sources with a randomly assigned redshift within @xmath51 and calculate their far - ir detection fraction .",
    "we repeat this process 100 times and found that on average , the random sample would have a far - ir detection fraction of only @xmath53 .",
    "this means that the uncertainty in the photometric redshift would actually _ decrease _ the observed far - ir detection fraction if the far - ir luminosity function and the redshift distribution are the same for qso1s and qso2s .",
    "this is likely due to the negative _ k_-correction at @xmath10 for galaxies with typical cold dust seds ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the starburst cold dust emission peaks at rest - frame @xmath194 which correspond to the spire @xmath10 for an object at @xmath195 .",
    "therefore , the starburst galaxies at lower redshifts are not brighter than our far - ir detected qsos at observed - frame @xmath10 due to the negative _ k_-correction .",
    "high - redshift starbursts are also not likely to be included in our far - ir detected sample as the @xmath10 filter probes the rapidly dropping rayleigh - jeans tail of the cold dust emission for objects beyond the redshift range of our sample .",
    "considering the significant difference of @xmath196 between the far - ir detection fractions of qso1s and qso2s , we confirm that the qso2s are indeed more likely to be hosted by galaxies with strong far - ir emission than qso1s .",
    "since the majority of qso2s have only _ photo - z_s  and luminosity measurements are redshift dependent , it is of extreme importance to confirm that the @xmath197 dex average @xmath198 difference between qso1s and qso2s is not driven by solely by the uncertainty of _ photo - z_s  .",
    "similar to the previous subsection , we estimate the effect of the _ photo - z _  uncertainty by testing the null - hypothesis that the qso2s have the same @xmath199 distribution as the qso1s .",
    "we again randomly assign redshifts to the ages blagns based on their _ spec - z_s and the uncertainty upper limit @xmath200 .",
    "for the sources with a randomly assigned redshift within the @xmath51 range , we perform the sed analysis ( described in  3 ) using the assigned redshift to calculate their average @xmath199 .",
    "we repeat this process 100 times and found that the average @xmath199 difference between the random samples and the original qso1 sample is @xmath201 dex , which is much smaller in comparison to the observed @xmath197 dex difference between qso1s and qso2s .",
    "we also note that the @xmath200 is a very conservative upper limit so the effects of photometric redshift uncertainty are almost certainly smaller . the @xmath202 difference between qso1s and qso2s is not driven by the _ photo - z _  uncertainty .",
    "recently , a number of studies of x - ray selected agns have found that star formation does not distinguish between agns with and without obscuration for agns classified based on either the presence of broad emission lines @xcite or the observed gas column density ( @xmath203 , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these conclusions are in direct contrast with our result in fig .",
    "[ fig : lagn ] showing a significant ( @xmath204 dex ) difference in @xmath74 between the qso1s and the qso2s .    to explain this apparent contradiction",
    ", we point out a fundamental difference between these studies and the present work .",
    "@xcite classifies the x - ray selected agn into `` type 1 '' and `` type 2 '' sources based sed fitting or the detection of broad emission lines . in our @xmath42 $ ] classification ,",
    "all of the qso1s are spectroscopically selected type 1 quasars , but it is not clear how many of our qso2s would have spectra with narrow emission lines similar to that of the optical type 2 quasars ; since the large amount of dust which blocks most of the agn optical continuum might very well block the emission lines from the narrow line region essential to optical agn classifications . also ,",
    "while deep x - ray and optical observations have proven to be efficient at detecting both obscured and unobscured agns , it is still challenging to include agns obscured by material with column density reaching @xmath205 @xmath7 ( i.e. compton thick ) in optical or x - ray selected samples .",
    "recent works on synthetic models of the cosmic x - ray backgrounds ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggest that a significant fraction of smbh growth might occur in a heavily obscured , rapidly accreting agn phase . as we have shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lxl6um ] , the far - ir detected qso2s have a @xmath188 ratio consistent with agns that have heavily absorbed or intrinsically weak x - ray emission .",
    "therefore , the different results might simply be due to mid - ir selected quasars representing different agn populations than the optically and x - ray selected agns .",
    "indeed , mid - ir selection criteria have been shown to be capable of picking up sources with their nuclei obscured by compton - thick material ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and moderate - luminosity mid - ir agns have been found to preferentially populate the higher - end of agn eddington ratio distributions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and to reside in more blue , star - forming host galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in conjunction with the higher @xmath206 and obscuration in our mid - ir quasars",
    ", we argue that part of the enhancement in @xmath74 of our sample when compared to x - ray or optical quasars is due to having different agn populations based on different selection criteria and the heavy obscuration which possibly takes place on the scale of the host galaxy .    in summary ,",
    "we have studied mid - ir luminous quasars at @xmath51 and demonstrated a connection between obscuration in mid - ir selected qsos and star formation of their host galaxies .",
    "this connection is supported by the higher agn obscured fraction in qso host galaxies with larger @xmath74 and the large differences in the average far - ir luminosities between qso1s and qso2s .",
    "we have also shown that both the agn obscuration at optical wavelengths and the agn absorption at x - ray wavelengths can be connected to the presence of far - ir emitting dust .",
    "these results suggest that the large scale gas and dust are also obscuring the central agns in addition to orientation - based small - scale obscuration , which is consistent with the scenario in which the rapidly growing smbhs are connected to dust - enshrouded starburst galaxies .",
