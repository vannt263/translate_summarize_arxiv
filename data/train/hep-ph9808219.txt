    "there are two complementary approaches in exploration of frontiers of particle physics .",
    "one is based on experiments carried out at high energies on accelerators and storage rings . at present , various programmes of gaining on high energies are successfully realizing and even more powerful accelerators are being constructed .",
    "however , it is obvious that the traditional accelerators will not make it possible in the future to sustain the present rate of advance in experimental research towards higher energies .",
    "that is why it is important to develop another approach based on research of those elementary particle characteristics that can be measured in relatively low - energy experiments and calculated theoretically with high accuracy .",
    "a comparison of results of such experimental and high - precision theoretical studies establishes a non - accelerative method of getting information on properties of elementary particles and their interactions .    a unique example of such particle characteristics is provided by the anomalous magnetic moments of charged leptons , of the electron and the muon in particular .",
    "the anomalous magnetic moment of a charged lepton is proportional to the deviation of the so - called @xmath13-factor of the particle , that is the measure of the size of the magnetic dipole moment compared to its intrinsic angular momentum , from the value @xmath14 .",
    "let me recall here the analogy with the classical motion of a charged particle .",
    "classically the magnetic dipole moment @xmath15 can arise when a charged particle is orbiting on the circular trajectory with radius @xmath16 . in this case",
    "the magnetic moment is associated with the kinetic orbital momentum @xmath17 and given by @xmath18 .",
    "consequently , the @xmath19-factor for this classical motion is equal to @xmath20 . alternatively , for the point - like dirac particle",
    "the relation between the magnetic dipole moment and the intrinsic spin moment takes the form    @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the magnetic moment operator , @xmath23 is the spin operator , @xmath24 are the pauli matrices , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the charge and mass of the particle . as it follows , the @xmath19-factor for this case is equal to    @xmath27    this value for the @xmath19-factor corresponds to the particular case when the wave function of the particle obeys the dirac equation and interaction with external electromagnetic field is introduced via the minimal coupling by extension of the derivative : @xmath28 .",
    "this not trivial result of the dirac theory can be also received in the frame of the non - relativistic approach based on the pauli wave equation .",
    "note that the value @xmath29 represents a fundamental propriety of the particle in respect to the electromagnetic interaction .",
    "if the particle participate in any other interaction which endow it with an internal structure then this departure from the point - likeness will be reflected on the value of @xmath13-factor .",
    "for example , for the proton @xmath30-factor is equal to 5.59 because of its internal structure .",
    "it must be also mentioned that if the interaction with electromagnetic field @xmath31 is introduced in non - minimal way and the charged lepton wave function obeys the equation @xmath32\\ \\psi=0,\\ \\",
    "\\sigma^{\\mu\\nu}={i\\over 2}(\\gamma^\\mu \\gamma^{\\nu}-\\gamma^{\\nu}\\gamma^{\\mu } ) , \\eqno(3)\\ ] ] then the @xmath19-factor will be modified and equal to @xmath33 .    however , even in the case of point - like dirac particle as it was shown first in @xcite the quantum nature of minimal electromagnetic interaction shifts the value of the @xmath13-factor .",
    "that is why it is convenient to represent the charged lepton @xmath13-factor in the form    @xmath34 where @xmath35 is equal to the so - called anomalous magnetic moment measured in units of the bohr magneton @xmath36    @xmath37    the most accurate experimental values for the electron amm was obtained by the washington university group @xcite and the experimental value for the muon amm was obtained in cern @xcite .",
    "if one compares the observed value of the electron amm with the theoretical predictions one shall conclude that the main contribution is due to quantum electrodynamical processes , while in the case of the muon amm the contributions of the strong and weak interactions are also substantial .",
    "the latter still remain outside the limits of experimental accuracy . however , with expected more than factor of 20 improvement in forthcoming results of the e821 brookhaven national laboratory measurement @xcite of the muon amm it will become possible to detect the contributions of the weak interactions . within the achieved accuracy the theoretical and experimental values of the electron and muon amm are in good agreement with the predictions of the standard glashow- weinberg - salam model .",
    "this provides both a sensitive verification to several orders in perturbation expansion of the qed and standard @xmath38 model as well as put constraints on new physics beyond the standard model @xcite .",
    "the expected improvements in accuracy of measurements of the leptons amm @xcite would either allow for the new physics effects to be visible , or if no any extra contributions to the leptons amm are seen , more severe bounds on alternative models will be received .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section 2 a brief review of the experimental values of the electron and muon amm are given . in sections 3 and 4",
    "the present status of the theoretical values of the leptons amm is discussed and the new theoretical value for the muon amm is derived . in section 5",
    "we consider the present discrepancy between the experimental and theoretical values for the muon amm and the one that could be achieved in the near future .",
    "the one - loop contributions of various types of bosons to the charged lepton amm are considered in section 6 on the base of calculation of the subsequent contributions to the lepton mass operator in external electromagnetic field . in section 6",
    "we also examine the dependence of these contributions to the lepton amm on masses of involved particles . in conclusion",
    "we derive constraints on couplings of the muon to hypothetical bosons and on masses of bosons .",
    "the permanently increasing accuracy of theoretical evaluations of charged leptons amm is stimulated by the tremendous accuracy that is achieved in measurements of the electron and muon amm .",
    "the latest experimental results @xcite of the washington university group for the electron and positron amm are @xcite @xmath40 in these measurements a single electron and positron are confined within a penning trap which constrains the position of a particle in a uniform magnetic field that is imposed by means of a hyperboloid cavity .",
    "the experimental uncertainties are dominated by a cavity shift effects of @xmath41 , which arises from a lack of control over the resonant interaction of a particle with the electromagnetic modes of the surrounding microwave cavity of the penning trap @xcite .",
    "there are also attempts to reduce this uncertainty @xcite .",
    "the latest cern storage ring measurements of the muon @xmath42 and @xmath43 amm give the results @xcite @xmath44 which together provide the current experimental average for the muon amm @xcite , @xmath45 the dominant error here is the statistical counting error of @xmath46 in the determination of the @xmath47 precession frequency which is the difference between the spin precession frequency and the cyclotron frequency of the muon in the magnetic field of the ring .",
    "it should be possible to reduce this error @xcite by at least a factor of 30 in the e821 bnl experiment because the intensity of the primary proton beam will be a factor of about 100 greater and the storage ring magnetic field a factor about of 3 greater than those used in the cern experiment .",
    "the reduction of the systematic error somewhat below the expected level of the statistical error will be provided by the improvement of the homogeneity of the magnetic field and diminishing of deviations of muons orbits from the ideal reference orbit .",
    "thus the present precision the measurement of @xmath7 at the level of @xmath48 is expected to be improved to the level of @xmath49 or even less ( @xmath50 ) @xcite .",
    "in the quantum electrodynamics the amm of an electron ( as well as of the other charged leptons @xmath51 ) can be expressed as a perturbation series expansion in the fine structure constant @xmath52 :    @xmath53 the coefficients @xmath54 are independent of the lepton mass , thus the first summ in ( 9 ) is identical for all charged leptons .",
    "the coefficients @xmath55 are functions of ratios of the mass of the external lepton @xmath51 to those of leptons @xmath56 in the vacuum polarization loops .    in the case of the electron",
    "the mass independent terms has been evaluated to order @xmath57 : @xmath58 where @xmath59 @xmath60 the coefficients of the leading term @xmath61 corresponds to the schwinger value of the lepton amm @xcite .",
    "the coefficients @xmath62 and @xmath63 has been evaluated both in numerical @xcite and analytical @xcite-@xcite technique , whereas @xmath64 has been evaluated only in numerical calculations @xcite .",
    "three most important mass dependent terms in ( 9 ) for the electron amm are known analytically @xcite @xmath65 @xmath66 @xmath67 other qed contributions to the electron amm are too small to be accounted at present .    to get the theoretical value for the electron amm",
    ", one must add also contributions of the lowest - order @xmath68 and of the order @xmath69 hadronic vacuum polarization and electroweak interaction @xcite : @xmath70    it has been shown that the two - loop electroweak contributions to a charged lepton amm are rather important .",
    "the recent evaluation of the two - loop elecrtoweak contributions to the electron amm @xcite amounts to @xmath71 of the one - loop term @xcite .    finally , from eqs .",
    "( 10)-(13 ) it is possible to obtain the theoretical value for the electron amm @xcite @xmath72 where the value of @xmath52 based on the latest measurements of the quantum hall effect @xcite is used : @xmath73 the theoretical ( 14 ) and experimental ( 6 ) values for the electron amm are in agreement within the @xmath74 standard deviations level .",
    "note that the intrinsic theoretical uncertainty @xmath75 of @xmath76 is much less than the uncertainty @xmath77 from the measurements of @xmath78 .",
    "it follows , that comparison of the theoretical and experimental values of @xmath79 gives a more precise value of the fine structure constant @xmath52 than one used for the derivation of @xmath76 .",
    "the value of @xmath52 determined from these arguments with the use of the average of @xmath80 and @xmath81 is @xcite @xmath82 where the most of the error comes from the experimental uncertainty in the measurements of @xmath83 .",

    "employing the value of the fine structure constant @xmath94 determined from the electron amm @xcite gives the new value@xmath95 for the qed contribution to the muon amm .",
    "this value is @xmath96 less than one used previously ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "the muon amm is more sensitive to processes at smaller distances than the electron amm because of the large mass scale @xmath97 .",
    "that is why the effects of strong and electroweak interactions are much more important in the value of @xmath7 than in one of @xmath79 .",
    "the hadronic contributions to the lepton amm arises from two effects : hadronic vacuum - polarization and hadronic light - by - light scattering .",
    "the hadronic vacuum - polarization contributions to @xmath7 can be evaluated within the dispersion theory using the experimental data on the total hadronic cross - section for the annihilation of electrons and positrons , @xmath98 , and perturbative qcd for the very high energies .",

    "@xcite that is @xmath104 the combination of ( 21 ) and ( 22 ) yields the final result for the hadronic contribution to the muon amm @xmath105 note that the principal contribution as well as the error come from the hadronic vacuum polarization effects from the low energy region and the improvement in @xmath106 data near the @xmath107 meson resonance energy @xmath108 could significantly reduce the uncertainty .",

    "the uncertainties in the qed ( 20 ) and electroweak ( 25 ) terms , @xmath132 and @xmath133 , contribute on the level of a few percent that of hadronic term , @xmath134 , : @xmath135    remarkably , within the recently achieved improvement in computation of the hadronic contribution @xmath136 the overall error in @xmath129 becomes about 2.3 times less than the contribution of the electroweak interaction @xmath123 .",
    "together with the anticipated precision of the e821 experiment the further reduction of errors in @xmath136 by a factor of about 2 will allow a direct detection of the electroweak contribution to @xmath7 and also will provide a test of new physics at the multi - tev scale .    in the difference of the experimental ( 8) and theoretical ( 26 ) values",
    "@xmath137 the dominated uncertainty is due to the experimental error . from ( 28 )",
    "we can derive the 95 @xmath138 confidence level limits on @xmath12 : @xmath139    let us suppose ( see also ref.@xcite ) that after the expected a factor of about 20 increase of accuracy in the e821 experiment and the further improvement in the calculation of the hadronic contribution the total uncertainty in @xmath12 will be again due to the experimental error . then in the case when the central value for the deviation @xmath12 will be also shifted down by a factor of 20 ( i.e. , it is supposed that the deviations from the standard model will not be visible on the new level of accuracy ) we can obtain the new limits @xmath140 at the 95 % confidence level .",

    "if the mass ratio squared , @xmath259 , becomes small ( @xmath260 ) the functions @xmath253 reduce to ( here we again suppose that @xmath261 for the scalar and pseudoscalar bosons contributions )    @xmath262 in the limit of large @xmath259 ( @xmath228 ) the functions @xmath253 go to zero like @xmath263 @xmath264 @xmath265 the expressions for the functions @xmath266 and their limiting values correct mistakes that exist in papers of other authors ( the detailed discussion on this item see in refs.@xcite ) . as it follows from eqs.(54 ) the scalar , pseudoscalar , and neutral vector bosons contributions remain finite in the limit of massless bosons .",
    "note that in this limit the vector boson contribution gives the lowest - order qed result for the lepton amm : @xmath267 where @xmath268 .",
    "on the contrary , the absolute values of the neutral axial vector and charged vector and axial vector bosons contributions increase to infinity in this limit .",
    "it is worth to note that in the limit of heavy bosons the scalar and pseudoscalar bosons contributions contain in addition to the term @xmath269 ( which is common for all of the contributions @xmath242 ) an extra factor of @xmath270 that can enlarge to some extent these two contributions to @xmath271 .",
    "substituting of the specific values for the coupling constants @xmath272 and masses of the bosons @xmath145 to the expressions ( 47)-(53 ) one can get the contributions to the amm of the charged lepton of mass @xmath192 that could arise in various theories .",
    "thus , with the combination of formulas ( 48 ) , ( 49 ) , ( 51)-(53 ) for the @xmath273 @xmath274 @xmath275 @xmath276 and @xmath277 bosons contributions we can find the vacuum contributions of the @xmath278 and @xmath208 bosons of the standard model ( see ref.@xcite and references therein ) .    formulas ( 47)-(53 ) for the one - loop bosons contributions to the amm of a charged lepton that exactly account for the masses of virtual particles can be used for getting constraints on parameters of theoretical models .",
    "let us discuss bounds from the muon amm data on the existence of hypothetical forces which would couple to the muon .",
    "here we reexamine constraints of ref.@xcite and predict new limits on @xmath279 and masses @xmath222 of hypothetical bosons @xmath280 , and @xmath281 that could be imposed by the improved measurements of the muon amm at the bnl .",
    "the contributions of different bosons are considered separately . to get constrains we demand",
    "that each of the new effects could remove the discrepancy : @xmath282 for @xmath12 we use the value of eq.(30 ) .",
    "the results as the exclusion plotts are presented in figures 2 - 5 that show the constraints on @xmath283 and @xmath222 in the decimal logarithmic scale .",
    "the regions above curves are excluded .",
    "the curves on fig.2 and 4 set the limits in the cases of bosons @xmath200 and @xmath284 , respectively , and are governed by the equation ( see limits ( 30 ) on @xmath12 ) @xmath285 the curves on fig.3 and 5 corresponds to the cases of bosons @xmath201 and @xmath281 and are governed by the equation @xmath286    comparing the curves in figs.2 , 3 , and 4 for the scalar , pseudoscalar , and axial vector neutral bosons contributions with the similar curves on figures of ref.@xcite we can see that the constraints on @xmath287 for the fixed values of @xmath222 obtained here with use of the new bounds ( 30 ) are about one order of magnitude as strong as those of ref.@xcite .",
    "the combined use of the @xmath200 and @xmath201 bosons contributions enables us to get @xcite the slepton - photino and wino - sneutrino contributions to the lepton amm in supersymmetric models .",
    "the appropriate combination of the @xmath200 and @xmath201 bosons contributions gives also contributions to the lepton amm in various models with the horizontal symmetry @xcite .",
    "however , for these two cases we need to know the vacuum contributions of the scalar and pseudoscalar bosons in general form for arbitrary values of the mass parameter @xmath288 .",
    "this can be done with the help of formulas ( 38 ) , ( 39 ) and data of the first two lines of table 1 . for the functions @xmath289 and @xmath290 ( here @xmath291 ) we get : @xmath292\\ ] ] @xmath293,\\eqno(59)\\ ] ] where @xmath294    this two parametric ( @xmath295 , @xmath296 ) analytic expression can be used to derive the value the scalar and pseudoscalar bosons contributions to the charged lepton amm in different theoretical models in which such spinless bosons are predicted .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank yury chernyakov , andrey egorov and rudolf faustov for discussions and assistance .",
