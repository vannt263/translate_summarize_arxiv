    "for more than 35 years the spectroscopic research of bulgarian astronomers has been mainly based on data obtained with the high - quality coude spectrograph , specifically designed for the 2 meter telescope of the national astronomical observatory rozhen ( nao ) .",
    "description of the basic characteristics of the coude spectrograph can be found in kolev ( 2008 ) and at the nao webpage .",
    "the spectrograph was designed in the 1970s when the common standard detectors were the photoplates .",
    "based on the data obtained with the coude spectrograph , a great number of original results have been published in different fields of research , during the era of photoplates .",
    "it is not possible to mention all of them , but it is worthed to cite at least several papers , mainly in order to illustrate the process of transition from the era of photoplates to ccds .",
    "properties of the stellar wind have been analysed by markova ( 1986 ) , tomov et al .",
    "( 1990 ) explained the strange behaviour of the unique star mwc 560 , peculiar profiles of hydrogen lines were found in the spectra of several @xmath1 bootis stars , investigated by iliev and barzova ( 1993 ) , stateva ( 1995 ) explained the helium distribution on the surface of the cp4 star hd 21699 . immediately after changing from photoplates to ccds , it was clear that we need an echelle spectrograph to continue doing good science with the 2-m telescope .",
    "markov ( 2011 ) made a summary of the scientific motivation and a review of possible solutions for an echelle spectrograph for the 2-meter telescope of nao .",
    "the ccds were introduced in the coude spectrograph in 1993 and today an 1kx1k photometrics camera is used .",
    "the ccd highly improved the spectrograph light efficiency and the spectral quality ( signal - to - noise ratio ) at the cost of the reduced spectral range available with a single exposure .",
    "originally designed to cover a spectral window of  1000 and  1500  on a photographic plate ( using respective gratings ) the ccd image nowadays covers spectral ranges of 200 and 100  with a resolving power ( r ) of 15000 and 30000 respectively . evidently , with a medium - sized ccd detector the coude spectrograph offers about an order of magnitude smaller spectral range .",
    "but most of the science cases require acquisition of the entire spectral range , simultaneously , from the uv to the near ir.one more disadvantage of coude spectrographs concerning their design is that these instruments are hosted in a large room which ensures large inter - components distances needed to achieve high spectral resolution . the large room control of working parameters ( temperature , humidity etc",
    "is a big challenge .",
    "a relevant solution for high - resolution spectral investigations challenges are fiber - fed echelle spectrographs .",
    "the efficiency of these instruments is twofold .",
    "first , their 2-d spectrum image is well suited to use effectively the full area of a 2-d ccd , thus offering the potential for the entire visible spectral range to be covered with a single exposure . and",
    "second , their design highly reduces the hosting space , thus improving spectrograph environment control .",
    "the first design of an echelle spectrograph for the 2-m telescope was a white pupil instrument , similar to feros ( kaufer et al .",
    ", 1999 ) or to elodie ( baranne et al .",
    "due to strong reduction of the preliminary planned budget for the spectrograph , we were pressed to develop a new design , different from the initial one , and based on commercial , off - the - shelf products , for all components where this was possible . finally , our echelle spectrograph got a design similar to musicos ( baudrand and bohm , 1992 ) or to the university of poznan spectrograph ( kamiski et al . , 2014 ) .",
    "espero is designed to be fiber - fed from the ritchey - chretien ( rc ) focus of the 2-m telescope .",
    "figure [ fig : dome ] shows the overall schema of the spectrograph design .",
    "a fiber injection and guiding unit ( figu ) is mounted at the rc - focus .",
    "the calibration unit , containing the calibration lamps ( led , tungsten and thar ) is placed in the control room at the level of the telescope .",
    "the spectrograph itself is in a separate , thermally isolated room , one level below the telescope , next to the coude spectrograph room .",
    "[ fig : dome ]      the light is transmitted from the rc focus to the spectrograph via an optical silica / silica multi - mode fiber with 50 @xmath2 m core , 30 m length , and numerical aperture ( n.a . ) = 0.22 .",
    "the entrance of the fiber is mounted on the fiber injection and guiding unit ( figu ) , produced by shelyak instruments .",
    "detailed description of figu can be found on the website of shelyak instruments .",
    "the main function of figu is to inject the focused light of the observed object into the object fiber . but this versatile unit is used , also , to transfer light from the calibration unit ( for flat fielding ( tungsten lamp and led ) and for wavelength calibration ( thar lamp ) ) to the object fiber , and as well to transfer some amount of the object s light to a guiding ccd camera",
    ". the light beam from a star is focused by the telescope on a hole in the center of an inclined mirror .",
    "the central part of the image is transmitted through the hole , and the wings are reflected to the guiding camera .",
    "the calibration unit , comprising of the thar lamp for wavelength reference and the tungsten and led for flat fieldig , is placed in a separate room at the level of the telescope .",
    "the calibration unit was also purchased from shelyak .    in order to achieve best match between the telescope focal ratio and the image scale ( f/8 and 77.5 @xmath2m/ , respectively ) with that of the figu",
    ", we purchased the f/9 version , with a 75 @xmath2 m hole in the mirror .",
    "an optical system below the mirror , having transfer ratio 1.5:1 , refocusses the 75 @xmath2 m hole onto the tip of the 50 @xmath2 m object fiber , and the focal ratio is changed from f/8 to f/5.3 , which corresponds to a n.a .",
    "= 0.09 , far below that of the fiber .",
    "the light beam from the calibration unit is transferred to the figu via a 200 @xmath2 m fiber .",
    "an automatically controlled moving flat mirror reflects the beam into the hole of the mirror , and from there on the light follows the same optical path to the spectrograph as the beam from the object .",
    "the autoguiding is performed with an atik titan camera , which comprises of a ccd chip with 659 x 494 quadratic pixels of size 7.4 @xmath2 m .",
    "detailed description of the camera can be found on the vendor s webpage . before reaching the ccd , the reflected image of the object passes through a transfer optics with 1.5x magnification .",
    "thus , on the guiding ccd , 1@xmath3 corresponds to 120 @xmath2 m , the scale is 0.06@xmath4 m , and the fov = 40@xmath3 x 30@xmath3 .",
    "a dedicated mechanical mounting was manufactured to hold all the components in the rc - focus , with special attention to the stable fixation of both fibers , eliminating the mechanical load on their connectors at different positions of the telescope .",
    "figure [ fig : ontable ] shows the instrument in the spectrograph room .",
    "the fiber feeding of the spectrograph is marked with number 1 .",
    "the exit of the fiber is mounted in the housing of an optical adapter ( label 2 in fig .",
    "[ fig : ontable ] , which serves for adjustment of the output beam to the f/15 beam of the collimator .",
    "this adaptation optics is just behind the slit ( number 3 in fig .",
    "[ fig : ontable ] ) .",
    "the output end of the object fiber with its optical adapter and the slit holder are firmly fixed on an originally designed and manufactured in nao table with five orders of freedom .",
    "this mechanical device is aimed to ensure proper adjustment of incoming light beam onto the collimator focal plane .",
    "the components 4,5,6,7 , and 8 are the off - axis collimator ( oap ) , the echelle grating , the cross - dispersing prism , the camera lens , and the detector , respectively .",
    "the oap is an off - the - shelf part purchased from optical surfaces ltd .",
    "it has a focal length of 1508.2 mm , an off - axis distance 103.9 mm , and a free aperture of 140 mm .",
    "our optimized optical scheme is based on a parallel beam of 100 mm , thus we are working far from the edges of the mirror with an effective focal ratio of f/15 .    the r2 echelle grating has 37.5 lines / mm , its dimensions are 240x120x30 mm , and the blaze angle is 63.5@xmath5 .",
    "it works in a nearly littrow regime , with an angle of 12@xmath5 between the plane of dispersion and the directon to the crossdispersing prism .",
    "the crossdisperser is a prism made of glass f108 , having characteristics similar to the f7 glass of schott .",
    "the apex angle of the prism is 53.7@xmath5 and the dimensions of its entrance surface are 187x190 mm .",
    "the imaging camera is a commercial canon ef 400 mm f/2.8l is usm lens .",
    "this objective lens has a diagonal fov of 6@xmath510@xmath6 , which is well adapted to the size of the detector ( see next subsection ) .",
    "the detector is an ikon - l ccd camera , manufactured by andor .",
    "it uses a thermoelectric cooled , back - illuminated , scientific - grade e2v ccd42 - 40 chip , comprising 2048x2048 quadratic pixels of size 13.5 @xmath2 m .",
    "the camera is characterized by low readout noise , high sensitivity and high dynamic range .",
    "when reading with 50 khz the gain is 1 e@xmath7/adu , and the ron is 3.4 electrons .",
    "the digitization is performed by a 16-bit analogue to digital converter , and the saturation level is over 88000 electrons .",
    "all components of the spectrograph are mounted on a honeycomb optical table with dimensions 2400 x 1200 mm , delivered by standa .",
    "the table itself stays on 4 pneumatic vibration isolators , which keep the level of the table and damp resonances caused by ambient vibrations .",
    "the vibration isolators are permanently connected to a cylinder of pressurized nitrogen .    for better thermal isolation and stability and in order to keep the spectrograph free of dust and other possible contaminants ,",
    "it is enclosed in a non - hermetic box .",
    "all components of the spectrograph , except the ccd , are in the enclosure .",
    "this way any effect of the detector ventilation on the other parts of the spectrograph is avoided . to let the ccd outside ,",
    "the box was manufactured with one hole between the end of the camera lens and the opening of the ccd .",
    "the ccd detector is operated by an industrial pc running solis , proprietary software supplied by andor together with the camera .",
    "because of the cable length limits of the usb connection , the pc is located relatively close to the camera , in the spectrograph room .",
    "three additional single board computers ( sbcs ) operate ( 1 ) the setting of the slit width , ( 2 ) the monitoring of the temperature inside of the enclosure and in the spectrograph room environment , and ( 3 ) the autoguiding of the telescope during exposures .",
    "the slit width is controlled by an arduino uno board located in the spectrograph room .",
    "this board is connected via rs-232 interface to the pc that operates the ccd camera , this way the slit width can be controlled remotely over the local area network ( lan ) with a simple software tool developed for the purpose .",
    "the temperature and humidity monitoring is done by a raspberry pi b sbc , which reads , records the sensor readings and provides web interface to the stored data .",
    "there are five sensors connected : three located in the spectrograph enclosure ( on the ccd camera , on the collimator and on the grating ) and two in the spectrograph room ( on the ceiling and at the optical table ) .",
    "the monitoring of the temperature over several months in 2016 gives a mean temperature of 17.8@xmath80.9@xmath5c .",
    "the relative humidity shows larger fluctuations , between 30% and 50% .",
    "these values resulted from a very preliminary analysis of the monitoring data , and they give enough information about the future needs of better stabilisation of the spectrograph environment , especially of the humidity .    for the autoguiding another sbc",
    "is used , raspberry pi b2 , which runs lin_guider .",
    "lin_guider is a free software originally developed for amateur telescope guiding , but extended with new features which made it a professional - grade software .",
    "it is being actively developed and extended with new features to make it more suitable for guiding on the residual stellar image as the majority of the light goes into the object optical fibre and the guiding is performed only based on the tiny percentage of the side lobe light .",
    "lin_guider currently uses centroid algorithm , but tests are being performed with two new algorithms which will be part of the next major release .",
    "both of them can be used for full frame guiding and all three have a subpixel precision .",
    "however each of them offers different benefits .",
    "one of them : donuts ( mccormac et al.,2013 ) is suitabe for guiding on defocussed stellar image , useful for high precision photometry . and the second is specially designed for guiding using the side lobes of the stellar image , which is basically a stellar image with a moving hole in it , hence its name holes",
    ". the holes algorithm will be descibed in detail in a separate paper .    the guiding camera , atik titan , is equipped with standard st4 guiding port .",
    "for that purpose a special adapter is created to make it possible to control the 2_meter telescope via the st4 port .",
    "this approach has another benefit - any of the wide range of cameras , supported by lin_guider , that is equipped with guiding port , can be used instead .    the detector pc and the three sbcs are controlled remotely over the lan .",
    "thus , entering the spectrograph room is necessary only on exceptional occasions .",

    "this dependence is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : o_c ] .",
    "the relative values of these differences are almost constant over the entire spectral range .",
    "the role of high quality flat fields is very important in the process of extraction of orders .",
    "the flat field must not only correct for the pixel - to - pixel sensitivity , but it has also to compensate the blaze of the echelle grating and remove the fringing in the red spectral region . in order to fulfil all these functions at the same time it is necessary to have sufficient signal over the entire spectral range .",
    "it is hard to meet this requirement , especially for the blue orders where the signal of the flat field is very low .",
    "this situation is well illustrated on fig .",
    "[ fig : tung - led ] , where a profile of a flat field , taken in the cross - dispersion direction , is shown .",
    "the blue end is at the right , and it is seen that the intensity of the led drops very fast in that direction .",
    "the decreasing quantum efficiency of the ccd in the blue spectral region additionally contributes for lower signal in that region . in order to obtain sufficient signal in the last blue orders it is necessary to make flat fields with longer exposures , and subsequently to combine the flats with different exposures into an usable superflat .",
    "another feature of the led and tungsten lamp is that their spectra , considered in a given single order , are inconsistent . probably , the reason is the different color temperature of the tungsten and the led .",
    "up to date it is not clear which of the lamps better removes the echelle blaze function , therefore we recommend to expose the tungsten and led lamps separately , and find empirically which lamp gives better results for every particular order .    as mentioned above the extraction of orders",
    "depends on high - quality flat fields .",
    "this dependence is especially critical in the red spectral region , where fringe patterns start to appear close to h@xmath12 and are getting stronger with increasing wavelength . for wavelengths greater than 7000 ",
    "the fringing is so strong that it can compromise the scientific information contained in the spectra , if they are not processed correctly with suitable flat fields .",
    "an example of removal of fringes in the range 8380  - 8530  is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : fringes ] .",
    "the final result , presented in the lower panel of that figure , shows that after the division by the flat field the fringe patterns are excellently removed , and the blaze function of the grating and the influence of the pixel - to - pixel sensitivity are eliminated simultaneously .",
    "one example of the derived resolving power of the spectrograph ( r = @xmath1/@xmath18 ) is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : noslit_resolution ] .",
    "the full width at half maximum ( fwhm = @xmath18 ) of more than thousand lines distributed over all orders were measured by fitting the lines with gaussian function . some of the lines , especially in the blue region , appear in adjacent orders .",
    "these lines are measured twice , but the contribution of every measurement has the same weight , as in these cases the measurements are independent .    .",
    "[ fig : noslit_resolution ]    there is a possibility to obtain spectra with higher resolutions by decreasing the width of the slit , placed in the oap collimator focal plane .",
    "of course , going to smaller widths , after a given value , a decrease of the signal will be experienced . in order to estimate the expected losses ,",
    "the fwhm of calibration lines , selected within five randomly distributed orders , were measured .",

    "[ fig : slit - fwhm ] . here",
    ", the upper abscissa shows the width at which the slit is set , and the lower one is its projection on the chip .",
    "the projection is calculated by the relation describing the transfer through the spectrograph optics ( @xmath19 ) , where _ w _ is the slit width in microns , @xmath20 is the ccd pixel size(@xmath21 ) , and _",
    "k _ is the spectrograph transmission factor ( @xmath22 , where _ gm _ is the grating magnification factor , _ fcol _ and _ fcam _ are the oap and canon focal lengths , respectively ) .",

    "the snr measurements of the nights with seeing 1 - 1.5were transformed to the results from the night with 2seeing using least square method .",
    "stars of different magnitudes were observed with different exposures , but for the final set of data they were all transformed to exposure of 1800 s. the straight line presents linear regression taken from the snr measurements of the three nights .",
    "spectra taken at airmass @xmath28 2 were not used .",
    "stellar magnitudes of the objects were reduced to unity airmass using extinction coefficient of 0.2 , a value commonly accepted at nao rozhen .",
    "the dashed lines in fig . [ fig : snr - mag ] , above and below the empirically derived dependence , show the expected signal - to - noise ratio in case of seeing 1and 3 , respectively .",
    "these estimations were made with a 2d gaussian function , calculated for different seeing sizes , and measuring the portion of the flux proportional to the cross - section of the entrance tip of the object fiber . from the data summarized in fig .",

    "in order to determine the zero point of the radial velocities ( rv ) derived from espero spectra observations of appropriate standard stars were obtained every observing night .",
    "stars were selected mainly from the gaia catalog of rv standard stars ( soubiran et al . , 2013 ) .",
    "sixty nine spectra of twenty three standard stars were obtained in the period june 2015 - september 2016 .",
    "rvs were obtained by crosscorrelating the spectrum of the studied object with a template spectrum ( template ) .",
    "templates were generated using spectrum , a stellar spectral synthesis program written by gray and corbally ( 1994 ) , and pollux , a stellar spectra database offering access to theoretical data ( palacios et al . , 2010 ) .",
    "every rv is derived as a mean value of measurements obtained from many orders .",
    "orders with a low signal - to - noise ratio as well as strong telluric absorption features were omitted .",

    "the annual monitoring of this difference shows slight systematic deviation of measured velocities with a mean value of -0.18 km s@xmath30 with a standard deviation of the mean 0.07 km s@xmath30 .",
    "more thorough analysis of the radial velocity accuracy derived from espero and its dependence on spectrograph working conditions will be discussed in a forthcoming paper .",
