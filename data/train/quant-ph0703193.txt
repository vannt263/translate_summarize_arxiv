    "a fruitful approach to protect quantum systems from decoherence introduced by uncontrolled interactions with the environment is to use symmetries exhibited by those interactions . when elementary quantum systems in an ensemble are coupled to the environment in an identical way , it is possible to identify certain collective degrees of freedom that turn out to be completely decoupled from the interaction , thus preserving quantum coherence .",
    "this approach is the basic idea behind decoherence - free subspaces and subsystems ( dfss ) @xcite ( for a review see @xcite ) , which can be implemented in a number of physical scenarios including quantum dots @xcite , atoms in a cavity @xcite , ion traps @xcite or photons transmitted through a birefringent fiber @xcite .",
    "the existence of dfss allows one to encode or communicate reliably both classical and quantum information , which has been demonstrated in first proof - of - principle experiments @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to go beyond the standard theory of dfss and to analyze a scenario when the interactions of elementary systems with the environment are not necessarily identical .",
    "specifically , we will consider a sequence of qubits affected by random unitary transformations .",
    "in the standard dfss model all unitaries are the same , enabling one to apply the standard decomposition into multiplicity subspaces based on angular - momentum algebra . in this paper",
    ", we will assume that correlations between unitaries affecting consecutive qubits are characterized by a probability distribution describing isotropic diffusion on the su(2 ) group .",
    "such a distribution has a number of invariant properties that result in the existence of a single real parameter which defines the strength of correlations .",
    "this will enable us to investigate the continuous transition between the extreme regimes of perfect correlations and independent transformations of consecutive qubits .",
    "the model introduced in this paper is a certain channel acting on a sequence of @xmath0 qubits .",
    "we derive its detailed description using angular momentum algebra , and analyze quantitatively the case of @xmath2 qubits . in particular we present numerical results concerning the classical capacity and present the optimal ensemble of states attaining it . surprisingly , for imperfect correlations the optimal ensemble contains nonorthogonal states .",
    "the fact that the use of nonorthogonal states may be necessary for the optimal classical communication has been known @xcite , yet it is rather surprising that this effect appears in a channel constructed in such a natural way .",
    "we compare the optimal capacity with the one that can be achieved when one is restricted to the use of orthogonal states and indicate orthogonal states which perform almost optimal .",
    "we calculate and analyze the optimal coherent information , which provides certain information about the quantum capacity of the channel .",
    "results presented in this paper can be applied to different physical systems used for quantum communication , e.g.  spins traveling in fluctuating external magnetic field , and photons traveling in a fiber with randomly varying birefringence .",
    "the model generalizes the standard dfs theory whenever the time separation between qubits sent through the channel is not negligible in comparison with the characteristic time of environment fluctuations .",
    "one can easily imagine such a situation in the case of spins traveling relatively slowly in randomly varying magnetic field .",
    "when it comes to photons , however , in most of present experiments the standard dfs approach seems satisfactory .",
    "the time separation of photons is typically several orders of magnitude smaller than the fluctuation time of birefringence , whose variations are caused by mechanical and thermal factors and hence by their nature are relatively slow",
    ". nevertheless , our model might be relevant also in this setting , when large temporal separations between photons need to be introduced , or sequences of photons are long enough to reach the time scale of birefringence fluctuations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we describe the model of imperfect correlations in sec .",

    "the standard model for collective depolarization of @xmath0 qubits described by a joint density matrix @xmath3 is given by the following map : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is an @xmath6 matrix describing the rotation of a bloch vector of a single qubit state and @xmath7 is the haar measure on the @xmath6 group .",
    "this operation inflicts a rotation which is completely random and identical for all qubits . in other words",
    "we may say that noise experienced by a given qubit is perfectly correlated with the noise experienced by all other qubits .",
    "we will refer to this map as _ the twirling map_. let us now extend the above model in order to describe the situation where correlation of noise acting on different qubits is not perfect .",
    "we will assume that the density matrix @xmath3 of the qubits undergoes a unitary transformation given by a tensor product @xmath8 averaged with a certain probability distribution @xmath9 .",
    "we will treat the sequence of @xmath10 as a discrete - time stochastic process with the markov property , i.e.  as a markov chain @xcite .",
    "consequently the probability distribution for @xmath10 will only depend on @xmath11 .",
    "additionally , we will impose the stationarity condition on our process which means that the conditional probability distribution is described by the same function irrespectively of the index @xmath12 .",
    "thus the joint probability distribution is given by a product @xmath13 we will consider an isotropic process , i.e. one that does not distinguish any element of the @xmath6 group , which is equivalent to the physical assumption that the fluctuations do not favor any particular form of depolarization .",
    "the isotropy condition requires that the conditional probability distribution @xmath14 , for every @xmath15 .",
    "this implies that @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a certain probability distribution defined on the group su(2 ) , which fully characterizes our decoherence model .    as the explicit model for the distribution @xmath17",
    "we will take the solution to the diffusion equation on the group su(2 ) .",
    "this solution can be conveniently parameterized with a non - negative dimensionless time @xmath18 characterizing the diffusion strength .",
    "the explicit expression for the distribution @xmath19 on the @xmath1 group at time @xmath18 reads @xcite : @xmath20 where @xmath21 are rotation matrices of the @xmath6 group @xcite .",
    "the function @xmath19 is invariant with respect to unitary transformations of its argument , i.e.  @xmath22 for any @xmath23 .",
    "it depends only on the eigenvalues of @xmath5 which can be parameterized with a single angle @xmath24 as @xmath25 and @xmath26 . then the sum over @xmath27 in eq .",

    ", operations @xmath38 commute with each other , i.e. @xmath39 , and furthermore they commute with @xmath40 .",
    "this implies that @xmath41 , which together with the fact that @xmath42 leads us to the conclusion that @xmath43 .",
    "this means that the output state is invariant under the twirling map .",
    "we will say that it has a _ twirled structure_.    the action of the twirling map in eq .",
    "allows us to restrict our considerations to input states having a twirled structure .",
    "let us now describe the states @xmath44 .",
    "for this purpose we use the following standard decomposition of the space of @xmath0 qubits : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is a representation subspace in which the @xmath47-dimensional irreducible representation of @xmath1 acts , and @xmath48 is the multiplicity subspace which is not affected by the action of @xmath49 .",
    "the above decomposition allows us to use a basis , where @xmath28 is the total angular momentum , @xmath27 is projection of angular momentum on the @xmath50 axis , and @xmath51 labels representation subspaces that are equivalent , i.e.  have identical @xmath28 .",
    "there are different ways of obtaining a given angular momentum by adding elementary @xmath52-spins of single qubits . if a given angular momentum is obtained by always adding the @xmath12-th spin-@xmath52 to the previously obtained total angular momentum of @xmath53 spins , these different ways correspond to different paths in the van vleck diagram @xcite , shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : vanvleck ] . therefore @xmath51 can be regarded as an index labelling different paths leading to equivalent representation subspaces .",
    "there are , however , alternative ways of specifying @xmath51 which depend on the order of adding elementary @xmath52 spins . in the following calculations",
    ", it will be helpful to use different conventions for labelling equivalent representations , distinguished with a subscript @xmath54 .",

    "the value of @xmath55 is thus fully specified by a sequence @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the total angular momentum after adding together spins from the number @xmath12 to @xmath56 .",
    "of course , a single particle spin is equal to @xmath62 for any @xmath12 . naturally , all the conventions for numbering equivalent subspaces , corresponding to a different choice of the @xmath56 , are legitimate , yet the ability to switch between alternative conventions will make it possible to derive a compact formula for the action of the channel",

    "an exemplary path @xmath65 is marked with bold ( red ) line.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    using the decomposition given in eq .",
    "we can write any twirled state @xmath66 in the following way : @xmath67 denoting by @xmath68 a projection onto @xmath69 we find the relations @xmath70 because the action of @xmath38 preserves the twirled structure , we may write the output state of the channel in an analogous form : @xmath71 therefore , the full description of the action of the channel amounts to writing @xmath72 as a function of @xmath73 .",
    "equivalently we may characterize the channel by its action on operators : @xmath74 since any twirled state can be written as their linear combination . as discussed before , we have freedom in choosing the convention for labels @xmath51 .",
    "the simplest expression is obtained if we specify how the channel acts on @xmath75 , and express the output in terms of the operators @xmath76 .",

( [ eq : evolvefinal ] ) only to ease the understanding of the formula structure .",
    "the formula ( [ eq : evolvefinal ] ) , despite its lengthy appearance , enables an efficient calculation of the channel action even for a large number of qubits , which would be infeasible by inserting directly the formula for @xmath19 into eq .   and performing the integration .",
    "the case @xmath86 of one qubit is trivial .",
    "the channel acts as completely depolarizing channel , hence its capacity both classical and quantum is zero .",

    "our general model predicts the same behavior , with the shrinking factor given explicitly by @xmath91 .",
    "notice also that quantum capacity of this channel is zero since all multiplicity subspaces are one dimensional .",
    "we will now investigate the action of the channel for three qubits , which is the lowest number with non - trivial equivalent representation subspaces .",
    "adding three spins @xmath52 gives one subspace with @xmath92 , which is the fully symmetric subspace , and two subspaces with @xmath93 .",
    "the two - fold multiplicity of subspaces corresponding to @xmath93 enables one to preserve quantum superpositions . in the case of perfect correlations",
    "@xmath94 the channel acts as the identity in the multiplicity subspace @xcite , which therefore forms a decoherence - free subsystem , making it possible to encode one qubit with the fidelity equal to one .",
    "the classical capacity of such a channel is equal to @xmath95 , since we have three completely distinguishable output states : two orthogonal states of a qubit from the multiplicity subspace and one state from the fully symmetric subspace . when correlations between operations acting on consecutive qubits are not perfect the fidelity of the transmission as well as classical and quantum capacity will decrease .",
    "in this section we will derive analytical formulas for the fidelity of transmission through the channel as well as numerical and approximate analytical results for quantum and classical capacities of the channel .    for three qubits a general twirled state",
