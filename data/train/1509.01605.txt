    "irreversible markovian dynamics on two - dimensional dimers or interlaced particle configurations ( see figure [ fig : corrispondenza ] ) are closely related to driven interacting particle systems as well as random surface growth models in @xmath1-dimensions . it is a challenge to find local irreversible dynamics whose invariant measures ( on the torus or on the infinite lattice ) are likewise local and explicit .",
    "knowledge of a dynamic s invariant measures can be useful in establishing its hydrodynamic / fluctuation theory and in understanding general properties ( i.e. universality classes ) of two - dimensional driven systems .",
    "the state space for the gibbs measures / dynamics we consider is that of interlacing particles on a discrete torus .",
    "each particle interlaces with two particles above it , two particle below it , and has two neighbors at the same row ( see figure [ fig : particelle ] ) . for a particle",
    "@xmath3 we let @xmath4 denote the absolute value of the horizontal distances between the particle and its neighbors starting with the right neighbor on the same row and going clockwise ( actually , the values of @xmath5 are this distance minus 1  see section [ sec : particelle ] for precise definitions ) . in continuous time , each particle @xmath3 jumps to the right by one lattice space according to an exponential clock of rate @xmath6 where @xmath7 .",
    "this dynamic is local and irreversible .",
    "moreover , it preserves the interlacing of particles ",
    "particle @xmath3 can not jump past the particle below and to its right since the factor @xmath8 in that scenario ; and if a particle @xmath3 jumps so as to pass its upper - right neighbor , then that neighbor is immediately pushed right by one space since the denominator for that neighbor s jump rate is zero , hence it jumps right at an infinite rate .",
    "the main result of this paper , theorem [ th : invarianza ] , provides an explicit two - parameter family of translation invariant gibbs measures on the torus which are invariant for this dynamic .",
    "one parameter represents the number of particles per row , and the other is topological , related to how much the particles rotate right between rows ( in terms of dimers , the parameters relate to the slopes of the height function ) .",
    "the gibbs measures are local and proportional to @xmath9 where the product is over all particles @xmath3 and where @xmath10 is the @xmath0-pochhammer symbol .",
    "these dynamics are irreversible ( i.e. driven ) ; the proof of the invariance of the gibbs measure involves unexpected cancelations of contributions from every particle . for @xmath2 , the dynamic reduces to the one introduced by a. borodin and p. l. ferrari @xcite and the gibbs measures reduce to uniform measures over the configurations of interlacing particles .",
    "their stationarity on the torus was proved in @xcite and the argument is simpler than in the @xmath11 case .",
    "in general , there is no hope of computing explicitly the stationary measures of a driven particle system . in the lucky cases when it is possible ,",
    "often the invariant measures turn out to be of product type .",
    "this is the case , for instance , for the asep on @xmath12 and certain modifications thereof @xcite , zero range processes @xcite , mass transport models @xcite , and certain discretizations of the one - dimensional kpz equation including directed polymer models @xcite . in contrast , our stationary measures @xmath13 are far from being product : for instance , for @xmath2 it is known that they show power - law decaying spatial correlations and the same presumably holds for @xmath14 .",
    "the dynamics and gibbs measures we study in this work were initially considered in the study of macdonald processes ( in fact , @xmath0-whittaker processes ) ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 3 ) , though our results do not rely at all on this technology .",
    "still , let us briefly explain the origins .",
    "the @xmath0-whittaker process is a measure on interlacing triangular arrays with @xmath15 particle on the first ( bottom ) row , @xmath16 on the second , up to @xmath17 on the top ( @xmath18 ) row .",
    "given the configuration of particles on the top row , the @xmath0-whittaker process enjoys the property that the measure on the remaining @xmath19 lower rows is given by the above described gibbs measure .",
    "the dynamics we described were also introduced in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 3 ) and play nice with such measures on triangular arrays . in particular ,",
    "if one starts with an interlacing triangular array satisfying the gibbs property , then after running the dynamics for a fixed time , the resulting triangular array also enjoys the same gibbs property",
    "( of course , the top row will have moved to the right ) .",
    "this fact follows from results in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 2.3 ) .",
    "while our main result does not follow from the results of @xcite , it was partially inspired by it .",
    "after all , if the gibbs property is preserved on these triangular arrays , it would seem reasonable that it should also be preserved on the periodized version of the model . in @xcite a more general class of dynamics and gibbs measures",
    "are discussed which are inhomogeneous with row - dependent parameters @xmath20 .",
    "our approach applies equally well in that more general context and so we state and prove our main theorem for general @xmath21 ( it reduces to the case described above when all @xmath22 ) .",
    "there actually exist many types of continuous time markov dynamics on triangular arrays which preserve the gibbs property @xcite , however the other known dynamics do not easily admit periodic versions ( i.e. they are not translation invariant ) .",
    "there is also a discrete time version of the above introduced dynamic described in @xcite , however it is not as simple and we do not pursue studying its periodized version .",
    "the other inspiration for our result is the recent work @xcite regarding the @xmath2 case of this model ( that work was inspired by the schur process work of @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath2 case of the dynamics is known to lie in the @xmath1-dimensional anisotropic kardar - parisi - zhang universality class @xcite .",
    "based on the approach developed in @xcite , the results of the present paper can be seen as a step towards extending this universality to @xmath23 . in the @xmath2 case , the next step in @xcite is to extend the invariance of gibbs measures from the finite torus to infinite volume .",
    "a crucial ingredient used in this extension was the fact that , for @xmath2 , the infinite - volume gibbs states are known and have an explicit determinantal structure and gff - like height fluctuations @xcite .",
    "all of this is missing in the @xmath24 case , so at present , the extension of our result to the infinite lattice and the proof of its kpz class behavior is an open problem .",
    "recently , borodin - bufetov @xcite considered another deformation of the borodin - ferrari particle system ( @xmath2 case of our dynamics ) and they showed that the invariant measures are given by 6-vertex gibbs measures .",
    "this deformation is different from the one we consider here ( ours originates from @xmath0-whittaker processes @xcite and the other from vertex models @xcite ) .",
    "let us also mention that another example of @xmath1-dimensional growth model with explicit ( non - product form ) stationary measure is the gates - westcott model @xcite .      in section [ sec.model ]",
    "we introduce the state space for our markov dynamics ( in terms of dimers as well as interlacing particle configurations ) and describe the class of gibbs measures we will work with .",
    "section [ sec.dynamics ] introduces the periodized @xmath0-whittaker dynamics .",
    "section [ sec.invariance ] contains the proof that the gibbs measures are invariant for the @xmath0-whittaker dynamics .",
    "the dynamics we study can be described as a driven interacting particle system , or as dynamics of a dimer model on the ( periodized ) hexagonal lattice .",
    "while the former description may be more natural , the latter allows to get more directly certain statements , notably ergodicity of the markov chain .",
    "we start by introducing the state spaces for our dynamics .",
    "the particle process lives on the @xmath25 discrete torus @xmath26 .",
    "the horizontal size is @xmath27 and the vertical size is @xmath17 .",
    "the particle configuration space will be denoted @xmath28 , and depends on two integers @xmath29 and @xmath30 such that @xmath31 at each site @xmath32 there is at most one particle . on each row",

    "we exclude @xmath34 and @xmath35 to avoid trivialities .",

    "given any @xmath3 ( say on row @xmath38 ) , we let @xmath39 denote its right / left neighbor on the same row ( note that if @xmath40 then @xmath41 ) .",
    "then , we require that in row @xmath42 there is exactly one particle , denoted @xmath43 , whose position satisfies @xmath44 and exactly one particle , denoted @xmath45 , satisfying @xmath46 see figure [ fig : particelle ] .",

    "another well - known fact is that the knowledge of which vertical edges are occupied uniquely determine the whole dimer configuration .",
    "a last observation is that the horizontal ( i.e. @xmath83 ) coordinates of vertical dimers are interlaced : given two vertical edges @xmath99 and @xmath100 such that there is a dimer at @xmath101 and no dimer at @xmath102 , then there is exactly one value @xmath103 and one value @xmath104 such that there is a dimer at @xmath105 and at @xmath106 .",
