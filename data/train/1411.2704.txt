    "we first generated a blank template image without any background noise , with the same size as that of the hubble heritage data set .",
    "then , we used the mkobj task in iraf to generate 500 artificial sources with @xmath27 pixels ( representing ` point ' sources ) , which we added to @xmath28 pixel@xmath25 sections of the blank template at random @xmath29 coordinates , ranging from 0 to 500 pixels in both dimensions .",

    "we repeated this procedure to cover the entire template region , thus allowing us to gain a sense of the variability of the completeness levels across the full observational area .    finally , we ` discovered ' the number of artificial sources in both the template and science images , using the same approach for both .",
    "( we similarly applied our source discovery routine to the science images to find the real clusters in section 2.2 . )",
    "since the template image contained no background noise , we can recover most input artificial sources , although some artificial sources may have disappeared into the physical noise of the science images , depending on the combinations of their integrated magnitudes and extent , as well as on the real background variations .",
    "in addition , saturated sources and blending may cause failures to recover the artificial sources . the template image hence became a perfect comparison sample to check how many sources should be recovered under ideal conditions .",
    "we counted the number of recovered artificial sources ( from the science image ) and the number of recovered artificial sources ( from the template ) to estimate the completeness , i.e. @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the number of artificial objects we recovered and @xmath32 is the number of input objects ; @xmath33 was simultaneously corrected for the effects of blending and saturation , as well as background noise .",
    "we show the results for the full science observations , as a function of magnitude , in figure [ f2 ] .",
    "we found that , for the observational data set as a whole , at approximately 21.5 mag in the f336w band , 23 mag in f555w , and 23.5 mag in the f110w band , the completeness fraction drops to below 50% .",
    "this indicates that at those magnitudes , the background noise starts to dominate the image quality . in the remainder of this paper",
    ", we will only consider objects above their respective 50% completeness limits and correct the relevant numbers for sampling incompleteness .",
    "note that , strictly speaking , this relates to the cluster subsample representing point sources , which thus implies that the completeness levels derived here are upper limits to the complement of more extended cluster candidates .",
    "however , in practice the completeness levels derived here differ only marginally ( and firmly within the photometric uncertainties ) from those for objects with @xmath34 $ ] pixels ; only @xmath35% of m82 cluster candidates are more extended .",
    "in section [ reduction.sec ] we obtained the observed ( broad - band ) spectral - energy distributions ( seds ) . a small fraction of our sample ( 231 clusters )",
    "were covered in all of the @xmath36 , and near - ir bands , whereas a larger cluster sample of 846 objects was found only in the @xmath13 bands .",
    "we used the galev evolutionary synthesis models ( kotulla et al .",
    "2009 , and references therein ; http://www.galev.org ) to determine the best - fitting values for the ages , masses , extinction values , and metallicities for all clusters by comparing the set of model seds with our observed seds .",
    "our statistical comparison was based on application of the analysed tool , which has been tested extensively both internally ( de grijs et al .",
    "2003a , b ; anders et al .",
    "2004b ) and externally ( de grijs et al .",
    "2005 ) , using both theoretical and observed young to intermediate - age ( @xmath37 yr - old ) star cluster seds .",
    "the relative ages and masses within a given cluster system can be determined to very high accuracy , provided that a combination of at least four passbands is used as input parameters ( anders et al .",
    "we first applied the analysed approach to our smaller set of broad - band @xmath38 cluster seds to determine the best - fitting overall metallicity , which yielded @xmath39 ( solar metallicity ) .",
    "based on abundance measurements of hii regions and young clusters in m82 ( smith et al .",
    "2006 ; lanon et al .",
    "2008 ) , solar metallicity for the star clusters seems indeed reasonable .",
    "we thus decided to fix the model cluster metallicities to the solar value , leaving both the cluster ages and extinction values as free parameters .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that this leaves us with one fewer free parameter to determine , which in turn renders our resulting age , mass , and extinction estimates more robust .",
    "the shape of the broad - band seds constrains the ages and extinction values , whereas the absolute flux levels result in the corresponding cluster masses . despite the sometimes significant photometric uncertainties ( see fig .",
    "[ f7 ] ) , generally caused by the highly variable background , our sed - matching approach successfully converged to a reasonably well - determined set of ages ( cf .",
    "table [ large.tab ] ) .",
    "the f336w band is the filter limiting our completeness analysis ; it reaches the 50% detection limit at a magnitude of 21.5 .",
    "although the m82 starburst regions are pervaded by high - extinction filaments , the outermost parts of the starburst core have lower extinction and can be studied with optical telescopes .",
    "however , the use of optical wavelengths , and in particular the need for a sufficiently high signal - to - noise ratio in the f336w filter , effectively limits our sampling of the m82 starbursts to their surface regions . using the galev model suite ,",
    "we draw the 50% completeness limit ( for ` point ' sources ) defined by the f336w band in the log(age)log(mass ) diagram of fig .",
    "[ f3 ] ( top ) .",
    "formally , 691 of our 846 clusters are located above the f336w 50% completeness limit . in essence ,",
    "our cluster sample therefore represents a ` @xmath0-band selected ' sample . with this caveat in mind , two clear `` gaps '' in the clusters galaxy - wide age distribution become apparent , which implies a bursty cluster - formation history across the face of the galaxy .",
    "the corresponding histogram ( see fig .",
    "[ f3 ] , bottom ) shows that the gap at the youngest age is located at @xmath40 , while the second gap is located at approximately @xmath41 .",

    "the youngest sample thus encompasses the time of the most recent starburst in the galaxy s nucleus , 46 myr ago ( e.g. , barker et al . 2008 ) , while the intermediate - age sample may be associated with the burst of cluster formation induced by the last m81/m82 flyby ( e.g. , de grijs et al . 2001 ; smith et al .",

    "the distribution of the most massive clusters@xmath99 , red triangles  in the intermediate - age sample compared with that of their counterparts in the old sample , is significantly different ; the former are dispersed around the whole galaxy .",
    "the 30 most massive clusters in the old sample are more centrally concentrated , covering a range of approximately @xmath100 ( right ascension @xmath101 declination ) ; the remaining eight clusters are found throughout the galaxy s disk .",
    "are indicated by red triangles ; the background colors represent the number density distribution of all detected sources .",
    "( middle and bottom ) same as the top panel , but for the intermediate - age and old samples , respectively . ]",
    "the old sample represents the potential field of the oldest galactic components .",
    "this sample contributes most clusters among all detected sources ( 55% ; 378 of the total of 691 clusters above the prevailing completeness threshold adopted ) , and hence their distribution is strongly associated with the high background number - density region .",
    "we propose the following evolutionary scenario .",
    "the oldest clusters likely formed at the time when the galaxy itself was in the process of formation , so the gravitational background experienced by this first cluster population at the time of their formation must have been very different from that in which subsequent cluster populations formed . when these latter populations formed , they found themselves inside a well - developed , centrally peaked gravitational potential , which would have strongly affected the evolution of these subsequently formed cluster populations . in the number - density color figure ,",
    "the highest - density region was likely the preferential nursery of the descendants of both the intermediate - age and old clusters ( i.e. , a nursery of both the young and intermediate - age star clusters , respectively ) , but in the mean time , the strong tidal field in the highest - density region will also have tidally truncated and stripped off the outer layers of the largest clusters , thus only leaving the more compact clusters as survivors .    in order to test if this proposed scenario is viable , we explored the size distribution of the surviving , most massive young clusters .",
    "if those young massive star clusters really have been affected by tidal disruption , they should be significantly smaller than their counterparts that are located far beyond the immediate influence of the central tidal field .",
    "we used the ishape software package ( larsen 1999 ) to determine the cluster sizes .",
    "this package is used to estimate the intrinsic shape parameters of extended objects given the observational point - spread function .",
    "it attempts to fit the radial profiles of extended sources with simple analytical functions . here ,",
    "we are mainly concerned with the observed clusters empirical sizes .",
    "the derived effective radii are not very sensitive to the choice of model ( larsen 1999 ) .",
    "a related result was obtained by kundu & whitmore ( 1998 ) , who found that effective radii derived from fits to a king ( 1962 ) model were also quite insensitive to the adopted concentration parameter @xmath102 , where @xmath103 is the tidal radius and @xmath104 the king radius .",
    "we adopted a king model with @xmath105 to fit the clusters radial profiles .",
    "finally , we determined the clusters half - light radii ( @xmath106 ) as an appropriate representation of their sizes , in units of pixels . to decrease as a star cluster evolves .",
    "at the same time , their half-_mass _ radii will increase , so that for relatively old sample clusters , we may overestimate their average densities . ]",
    "figure [ f6 ] ( top ) displays the @xmath107 versus @xmath106 diagram for all young star clusters .",
    "the dashed line indicates the critical mass we adopted for the most massive clusters in the young sample .",
    "an apparent mean smaller size for these most massive clusters , @xmath108 pc , is found , as well as a smaller size spread : the less massive clusters have a mean half - light radius of @xmath109 pc .",
    "we also calculated the clusters average density , @xmath110 ( see the background colors ) , where we simply assumed that the clusters half - light radii are roughly equal to their half - mass radii ( @xmath111 ) .",
    "it thus appears that the most massive young clusters are also the highest - density , most compact objects .",
    "note that despite the relatively small sample size of eight objects above the critical mass limit , these eight sources are the brightest clusters in the young subsample . in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] , they are found well above our galaxy - wide selection limit . if the young sample had included additional , more extended objects of similar masses , our procedures would , without a doubt , have detected such objects .",
    "this is supported by the fact that the young sample _ does _ include more extended objects below the critical mass limit , which are less luminous ( by definition , given their very similar ages ) than the higher - mass objects we would have missed . as such , we conclude that there is indeed a tantalizing hint that the most massive young clusters are systematically smaller than their lower - mass counterparts .",
    "( of course , this argument hinges on the basic underlying assumption that the clusters radial profiles do not differ significantly among the sample objects . )    in fig .",
    "[ f6 ] ( middle and bottom ) , we show the same distributions as in fig .",
    "[ f6 ] ( top ) , but for the intermediate - age and old samples .",
    "this time , however , we do not observe any clearly smaller mean size for the most massive clusters : for the intermediate - age clusters , the mean half - light radii for the low- and high - mass subsamples are @xmath112 pc and @xmath113 pc , respectively .",
    "the equivalent sizes for the the old sample are 4.1 pc and 4.3 pc , respectively .",
    "this may indicate that the remaining massive star clusters in the intermediate - age and old samples are not as strongly affected by the prevailing tidal field , in part because of their more extended distributions , i.e. , away from the peak of the tidal field s distribution .",
    "this is a reasonable conclusion , since the first generation of star clusters ( the old sample ) likely formed when the galaxy itself was still forming , so that ( i ) a strong tidal field may not yet have been established , and ( ii ) the remaining old clusters have proved robust with respect to the effects of the prevailing tidal field .",
    "we are thus likely observing an old cluster population that has survived the potentially devastating effects of tidal stripping .",
    "note , however , that although the intermediate - age , most massive clusters are more dispersed than their counterparts in the young sample , which should not yet have been affected strongly by the tidal field , some may already have been disrupted .    alternatively , the reason why the massive old clusters may still be confined to a relatively small volume in and near the galactic center region might be found in the complex structure of the m82 disk .",
    "it is well - known that the inner @xmath114 kpc of m82 is dominated by a stellar bar ( e.g. , wills et al .",
    "2000 ) in solid - body rotation .",
    "the phase mixing might be slow enough for the bar to retain its identity over a sufficient time so as to remain self - constrained ( j. s. gallagher , private communication ) .",
    "in addition , since the density in the region is high , simple calculations imply that the area s self - gravity is non - negligible compared with the rotational shear , therefore also prohibiting a rapid dispersion of the central starburst region .",
    "finally , we note that the old clusters survived the recent tidal encounter with m81 , which may have occurred between approximately 150 myr and 1 gyr ago ( e.g. , brouillet et al .",
    "1991 ; yun et al . 1994 ; de grijs et al .",
    "2001 , 2003c ; smith et al . 2007 ) .",
    "although this might appear curious at first sight , we point out that our old cluster sample only includes objects that are more massive than a few @xmath115 , while disruption  both owing to internal relaxation and caused by external perturbations ",
    "predominantly affects the lower - mass clusters in a given sample .",
    "however , because of the age - dependent selection limit , we can not make any definite statements about whether or not the last tidal encounter with m82 may have led to significantly enhanced cluster disruption among the lower - mass clusters in the oldest subsample ( but , for a similar scenario in the context of the interacting galaxy m51 , see lamers et al .",
    "2005a ) .     versus @xmath106 diagram for the young star clusters .",
    "the vertical dashed line indicates the critical mass adopted for the most massive clusters , i.e. , @xmath116 , while the background colors and contours indicate the cluster population s density distribution .",
    "( middle and bottom ) same as the top panel , but for our intermediate - age and oldest samples , respectively . ]",
    "using high - resolution _ hst _ images based on multiple - passband observations , we selected a complete sample of 846 star clusters in the disk of m82 , for which we determined the respective magnitudes , as well as their age , mass , and size information .",
    "we aimed at characterizing the effects of cluster disruption based on a detailed analysis of the clusters age and mass distributions .",
    "our primary results can be summarized as follows .    1 .",
    "the young sample@xmath117displays a steep - to - shallow cmf slope change when going from low to high cluster masses , with a characteristic break near @xmath118 , while both the intermediate - age@xmath119$]and old samples@xmath120display a shallow - to - steep slope change in the same direction .",
    "this distinct difference with respect to the less massive clusters cmf in the young cluster sample may indicate a mass - specific disruption law : clusters that are less massive than a critical mass are preferentially disrupted on a typical , mass - dependent timescale ( @xmath121 myr ) .",
    "2 .   compared with the total young cluster sample ,",
    "the most massive young clusters are all located within a very compact spatial region .",
    "the distribution of the most massive clusters in the intermediate - age sample@xmath122compared with that of their counterparts in the young sample , is markedly different ; the latter are dispersed around the whole galaxy .",
    "the 30 most massive clusters in the old sample are significantly more centrally concentrated .",
    "it is clear that the most massive young clusters are also the highest - density , most compact objects .",
    "this result hence strongly suggests that the properties of the most massive young clusters are affected by the galaxy s tidal field . for the intermediate - age and old samples",
    ", we do not observe any clearly smaller size for the most massive clusters .",
    "this may indicate that we are observing a different subset of the initial cluster population for each of the age ranges ( i.e. , differently affected by tidal effects and evolution ) , and that the remaining , surviving massive star clusters in the intermediate - age and old samples are  on the whole  more robust with respect to changes due to the prevailing tidal field .",
