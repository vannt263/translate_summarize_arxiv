    "as semiconducting quantum dots ( qds ) display standard atomic physics properties , they may be thought as giant artificial atoms , with adjustable quantized energy spectra through their sizes and shapes .",
    "they are of interest in a wide range of research areas @xcite . in such structures , quantum size effects ( qse )",
    "are characterized by a blue - shift in the semiconductor optical spectrum , due to the increase of the charge carrier confinement energy .",
    "results on qse in low - dimensional semiconductor structures and modern approaches to this problem are discussed in @xcite . in this paper ,",
    "the qd problem is dealt within a modified effective mass approximation ( ema ) model , to which a pseudo - potential is added ( _ cf .",
    "_ section * [ sec_2 ] * ) .",
    "this partially removes the over - estimation of the electron - hole pair confinement energy for small qds , and allows the analytic determination of the kayanuma function @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the physics of qds , particularly in regard to the qd interaction with an external field , is very attractive .",
    "it gives rise to quantum - confinement stark effects ( qcse ) @xcite , which manifest themselves through a red - shift of exciton photoluminescence @xcite . in section * [ sec_3 ] * , we use the ema model to obtain analytic criterions on the qd radius and the applied electric field amplitude , as a result of the interplay between electron - hole coulomb interaction and an additional polarization energy @xcite . when the electromagnetic field is quantized , an energy level lamb shift occurs @xcite .",
    "while it is a continual subject of research @xcite , it seems to be unknown for qds . in section * [ sec_4 ] * , we use the ema framework to uncover an observable negative lamb shift for the electron - hole pair ground state , in judiciously chosen qds . in section * [ sec_5 ] * , the purcell effect , a test bed for many applications @xcite , is studied for qds . a condition for its occurrence , despite the action of unfavorable rabi oscillations , is derived .",
    "this opens the way for a visible light qd - laser , driven by a purcell effect .",
    "in a standard ema model , an electron and a hole , of effective masses @xmath1 , behave as free particles in a spherical infinite potential well @xmath2 .",
    "their coulomb interaction @xmath3 is treated by a variational procedure . to handle the interplay between confinement energy ( scaling as @xmath4 ) , and",
    "coulomb potential ( scaling as @xmath5 ) , two regimes are singled out by the values of the ratio of the qd radius @xmath6 to the bulk mott - wannier exciton bohr radius @xmath7 @xcite . here , as far as stark , lamb or purcell effects are concerned , the so - called weak field limit , by which the charge carriers can not overstep the real confining potential by tunneling ,",
    "is assumed .    in a strong confinement regime , where @xmath8 , the electron - hole relative motion is affected by the infinite potential well , such that the electron - hole pair stays quasi - uncorrelated . to exhibit the excitonic behavior of the electron - hole pair , both electron and hole , individually confined and being in their ground state , the following trial function @xmath9 , of parameter @xmath10 , is to be used . the electron - hole pair ground state energy @xmath11 , given in @xcite ,",
    "is retrieved up to @xmath12 order , @xmath13 being the electron - hole pair reduced mass , @xmath14 its ground state confinement energy , and @xmath15 the excitonic rydberg energy .    in the weak confinement regime , where @xmath16 , the exciton behaves as a quasi - particle of mass @xmath17 .",
    "then , the leading contribution to its ground state energy is @xmath18 , while its total translational motion is @xmath19 . to improve the accuracy of the exciton ground state energy @xmath20 , a phenomenological function @xmath0 of the mass ratio @xmath21 was introduced in @xcite .",
    "the exciton is thought as a rigid sphere of radius @xmath22 , and its center - of - mass can not reach the infinite potential well boundary unless the electron - hole relative motion undergoes a strong deformation @xcite .",
    "thus , adding a ground state plane wave in the center - of - mass coordinates to the trial function @xmath23 , we obtain , up to @xmath24 order , @xmath25 , where @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath0 satisfies the electron - hole exchange symmetry , and table [ table_1 ] shows good agreement with computational results .    -.2 cm    .[table_1]comparison of @xmath0 values from computational results of @xcite and theoretical results given by equation @xmath26 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     -.7 cm    assuming that the decay @xmath27 , of relaxation rate @xmath28 , is faster than the decay @xmath29 of relaxation rate @xmath30 : the intermediate state is metastable and @xmath31 . in a stationary regime with weak pumping @xmath32 ,",
    "the population inversion holds only for @xmath33 .",
    "this implies that @xmath31 , which means that the excited state is almost empty , and the intermediate state is the most populated . as @xmath34mhz and @xmath35khz , the assumptions for having a red - light three - level laser are met , if @xmath36 , _",
    "i.e. _ if @xmath37 , and if @xmath38 is of the order of @xmath39mhz .",
    "in particular , the condition for obtaining the purcell effect is met @xmath40 .",
    "table [ table ] suggests that spontaneous emission rates are of the same order of magnitude than those of the @xmath41-@xmath42 laser .",
    "so , the purcell effect coupled to the qds artificially tailored spectrum leads to the possibility of producing visible light laser emission .",
    "however , even in the strong confinement regime , this result is to be considered with care since electron - hole coulomb interaction is not yet included .",
    "in this paper , a novel approach to some interesting properties of spherical semiconducting qds is presented .",
    "it is based on an improved ema classical model with an added effective pseudo - potential .",
    "this allows extensive analytic calculations of physical quantities yielding considerably better agreement with numerical or / and measured data for quantum size effects and quantum confinement stark effects . using this model , the lamb shift in spherical semiconductor qds is computed .",
    "it turns out to be negative and in principle observable , at least in the strong confinement regime .",
    "finally our study also demonstrates the utility of the purcell effect , predicted for atoms , for qd - laser emission in the visible .",
    "these wide ranging theoretical results are encouraging for further investigation of qds structure , based on this improved ema model ."
