    "the study of catalytic oxidation processes on @xmath2 surfaces is of considerable interest since the apparently simple kinetics of this reaction can give rise to different types of behavior as a result of competing surface processes , substrate phase transformations and global coupling effects .",
    "extensive investigations have been carried out in the last decade including both experiment and theory@xcite .",
    "experiments have demonstrated the existence of a variety of non - linear phenonena such as nucleation - induced front propagation , spiral wave dynamics , faceting structures and kinetic oscillations.@xcite    in this article we re - examine some aspects of the global oscillations observed in the oxidation of @xmath0 on @xmath1 surfaces.@xcite by  global \" we mean oscillations in concentrations of adsorbed species or @xmath2 substrate states averaged over the entire crystal surface or , in experiments , some macroscopic region of the surface .",
    "the principal features that give rise to such oscillations , which involve coupling between surface phase transformations and the oxidation kinetics , were elucidated in earlier studies @xcite and are as follows : the surface - catalysed @xmath0 oxidation occurs by a langmuir - hinshelwood mechanism @xcite : @xmath3 where the @xmath4 indicates an empty adsorption site .",
    "the first three steps ( [ step1]-[step3 ] ) constitute the langmuir - hinshelwood mechanism .",
    "the fourth step ( [ step4 ] ) is included to prevent poisoning of the @xmath2 surface by adsorbed oxygen , which is not observed in experiment .",
    "it involves the direct reaction of an adsorbed oxygen atom with @xmath0 from the gas phase to produce @xmath5 in the gas phase plus an empty surface site .",
    "the actual mechanism of @xmath0 oxidation on @xmath1 involves a coupling between the reconstruction of the @xmath2 surface and the adsorption and reaction kinetics@xcite .",
    "the structure of the topmost layer of clean @xmath1 differs from that in the bulk ( @xmath6 ) and is reconstructed to form a @xmath7 structure.@xcite when the @xmath0 coverage exceeds a critical value this reconstruction is lifted and the surface reverts to the @xmath6 form . in general the reaction rates may be different for the two surface phases and we have accounted for this possibility by appending the superscript @xmath8 or @xmath7 to the rate constants in the langmuir - hinshelwood mechanism .",
    "phase transformations between these two surface forms are triggered by and , in turn , influence the characteristics of diffusion and reaction kinetics .",
    "it is the switch between two surface forms with high and low reactivities that is responsible for the existence of global kinetic oscillations .",
    "apart from these general observations on the origin of the kinetic oscillations , it is known that for @xmath1 @xcitethe spatial coupling of different parts of the surface is caused by the propagation of chemical fronts of oxidation across the crystal surface .",
    "@xcite the nature of the wave propagation processes depends on both the type of global oscillation and the diffusion coefficient of adsorbed @xmath0 , @xmath9 .",
    "we investigate the spatial structure that underlies the global oscillations .",
    "the most extensive theoretical descriptions of wave propagation processes associated with @xmath0 oxidation on various @xmath2 surfaces have been based on reaction - diffusion equation descriptions of the spatiotemporal dynamics @xcite , but lattice - gas cellular automaton models @xcite have also been employed in such studies .",
    "these lattice - gas automata are probabilistic cellular automata that employ a particle description of the dynamics and should be distinguished from other cellular automata that are designed to simulate reaction - diffusion equation dynamics.@xcite while most of the phenomena of interest occur on sufficiently long space and time scales that a continuum description using reaction - diffusion equations is appropriate , the cellular automaton models have the advantage that they naturally incorporate fluctuations that are responsible for the nucleation events that play a role in the process and , as well , can be extended to smaller scales where continuum models are no longer appropriate .",
    "cellular automaton models allow one to describe the system at a mesoscopic level which incorporates the essential mechanistic features of the reaction dynamics .",
    "several such models for surface catalysed @xmath0 oxidation employing simple langmuir - hinshelwood kinetics have been developed in the past years@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we use a cellular automaton model for catalytic oxidation of @xmath0 on @xmath1 which accounts for the coupling among the local reaction kinetics , substrate phase transformations and diffusion of adsorbed species .",

    "from the description given above we see that any model of this surface catalysed reaction must account for the coupling among phase transformations , diffusion and reaction . the cellular automaton model we employ",
    "has features that are like those of the monte carlo models@xcite in that asynchronous site updating rules are used , but there are also features in the model that are adopted from reactive lattice - gas automata @xcite and , for the surface phase transformation process , rules similar to those of traditional cellular automata are used.@xcite the dynamics is described by the following rules :    the cellular automaton dynamics is assumed to take place on a set of regular two - dimensional lattices @xmath10 .",

    "these partial pressures are incorporated in the @xmath74 and @xmath75 rate coefficients .",
    "we have confirmed that our model reproduces this structure in the ( @xmath76 ) parameter plane and , furthermore , have examined how this bifurcation diagram @xcite changes as @xmath9 varies .",

    "an understanding of these  phase \" diagrams requires an examination of the spatial structure that gives rise to the global dynamics .",
    "we now characterize the global oscillations and then discuss the underlying spatial structure .",
    "it is difficult to precisely classify the nature of the bifurcations that are responsible for oscillatory behavior since our cellular automaton model is a high - dimensional , particle - like model and we have no recourse to a simple description based on ordinary differential equations ( ode ) .",
    "nevertheless , some general features of the bifurcation structure are consistent with those for the global oscillations on @xmath80 described in ref.@xcite where a two - variable ode model that did not include the details of the spatial structure was studied .",

    "this figure shows the phase space trajectory for these globally averaged fields for fixed @xmath88 and varying @xmath89 , moving from low to high values of this parameter .",
    "the results suggest that the oscillations arise by a supercritical hopf bifurcation on the leftmost boundary of the oscillatory region since the ( noisy ) global limit cycle is harmonic in character and its amplitude grows as one moves away from the boundary towards higher @xmath89 ( cf",

    "there are distinctly identifiable slow and fast portions to the cycle .",

    "these two values lie near the two bifurcation boundaries which showed harmonic and relaxation oscillations for large @xmath9 .",
    "the global oscillations are highly irregular and much less well resolved , regardless of the location within the oscillatory regime .",
    "we have chosen to plot only the time variation of a single variable rather than a phase plane plot since the irregular character of the oscillations leads to a complex phase space trajectory where the oscillatory structure is obscured . as a result",
    "the bifurcation boundaries shown in fig .  [ pdiag](b ) are subject to large uncertainties .",
    "we now consider the spatial structure that underlies these global oscillations .",
    "while it has been established that chemical waves propagating across the surface are responsible for the existence of the oscillations , we shall show that the character of these surface structures varies considerably depending on the region of parameter space within the oscillatory domain of the bifurcation diagram and the magnitude of @xmath9 .",
    "the most regular global oscillations are found for large @xmath9 in the oscillatory region of the bifurcation diagram corresponding to high @xmath89 where one observes relaxation oscillations .",

    "the upper panels in each time group ( labeled @xmath91 ) show the @xmath2 surface phases while the lower set of panels in each time group ( labeled @xmath92 ) shows the state of the adsorbed phase .",
    "the @xmath2 surface exhibits well defined propagating fronts that correspond to conversion of the @xmath2 surface between the @xmath7 and @xmath6 phases . at the begining of the cycle shown ( upper left )",
    "most of the surface is in the @xmath7 phase ( black ) and there are islands of the @xmath6 phase ( white ) .",
    "since the @xmath0 coverage is high the more stable surface state is the @xmath6 phase and the @xmath6 islands quickly grow and consume the @xmath7 phase until the entire surface is @xmath6 with a few very small islands barely discernible in the top right panel of the figure . with the surface in the @xmath6 phase ,",
    "@xmath12 adsorption is high , @xmath0 is consumed and its coverage falls .",
    "the @xmath7 islands now grow and consume the @xmath6 phase until the surface reverts to a nearly complete @xmath7 structure with a few small @xmath93 islands .",
    "if one observes the spatiotemporal dynamics over many global oscillation periods one sees a constantly changing pattern of waves of phase transformation sweeping over the surface but the dynamics is sufficiently well synchronized that the cycling time between the  @xmath7-rich \" and  @xmath6-rich \" phases is nearly constant .    in the model the adsorbed @xmath12 atoms do not diffuse but @xmath0 does . apart from some small scale fluctuations the adsorbed species are uniformly distributed and do not exhibit chemical waves ( cf .",
    "@xmath92 panels in fig .",
    "[ spatd10r ] ) . in this case",
    "@xmath9 is sufficiently large ( @xmath77 ) that @xmath0 diffusion is able to maintain homogeneity over the finite simulation domain .",
    "a rough estimate of the diffusion length is @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is the oscillation period . for the conditions of the simulation described above we have @xmath96 ,",
    "@xmath97 and @xmath98 so that the ratio of the diffusion length to the system size is @xmath99 and one expects diffusion to homogenize the @xmath0 concentration gradients , as is indeed observed .",
    "the adsorbed species concentrations oscillate but there is almost no pattern formation in the adsorbed layer .",
    "when @xmath9 is smaller ( @xmath78 ) there are time episodes where the waves of phase transformation that sweep the surface are no longer synchronized .",
    "this desynchronization is evident in the plots of @xmath85 versus @xmath90 shown in fig .",
    "[ gosc.5 ] where one observes trajectory segments with large amplitude and others with small amplitude . in the time segments where the global concentrations have small amplitude",
    "the spatial structure is highly disorganized .",
    "figure  [ spatd.5r ] shows the spatial structure during such a small - amplitude episode where one sees that the irregular time variation of the global trajectory arises from the irregular surface structure : while waves of phase transformation still sweep across the @xmath2 surface , the nucleation and growth events have a highly random character .",
    "the surface does not revert to a nearly pure @xmath6 or @xmath7 form since new nucleation and growth events occur before others are completed . for the system parameters in this case we have @xmath100 and @xmath101 which is much smaller than the system length , @xmath102 . in this circumstance @xmath0 diffusion",
    "will no longer be able to maintain spatial homogeneity in the concentration across the surface .",
    "this is evident in the lower panels ( @xmath92 ) in fig .",
    "[ spatd.5r ] which show the local concentrations of the adsorbed species : there are now significant spatial variations in the adsorbed species concentrations .    of course , the general structure of these results is to be anticipated on physical grounds . a fixed value of the diffusion coefficient and kinetic parameters implies a fixed diffusion length @xmath103 .",
    "as the system size increases it will be impossible for diffusion to maintain a synchronized dynamics across the entire surface and one should observe phase turbulence .",
    "@xcite if the results for small diffusion are viewed on smaller length scales , small compared to the diffusion length , then synchronized dynamics will again be observed .",
    "the domain over which the global concentrations are computed in experiment is related to the area of the surface probed by the various measuring techniques .",
    "this point has been discussed in refs .",
    "apart from these rather general observations it is interesting to recall that in the present model only @xmath0 diffuses and it is the @xmath2 substrate state that exhibits the most well defined surface structure .",
    "this structure is best organized when there is no spatial pattern in the adsorbed phase . in this sense",
    "the standard arguments leading to phase turbulence take a somewhat different character that makes the results presented here less obvious .",
    "next , we consider the behavior near the bifurcation boundary where the oscillations are harmonic in character and appear to arise from a hopf bifurcation . here",
    "the situation is quite different , even for the large diffusion case where the global oscillations are well defined . in view of the fact that the global oscillations grow in amplitude and are small just within the bifurcation boundary , we need to examine how it is possible for such small - amplitude oscillations to arise in the spatially distributed medium",
    "this can be understood from a study of fig .",
    "[ shopf ] which shows the state of the @xmath2 surface during one global oscillation period .",
    "the open squares on the curve showing @xmath85 versus @xmath90 in lower panel of this figure indicate the times in the global oscillation cycle corresponding to the @xmath2 surface structure in the upper panels .",
    "in contrast to the rapidly growing waves of phase transformation that sweep across the surface in the relaxation oscillation regime , here one observes that large portions of the @xmath2 surface remain in the @xmath7 phase throughout the global oscillation cycle .",
    "the growth of @xmath7 now largely occurs by repeated nucleation events which tend to  fill in \" the @xmath6 seas .",
    "the @xmath7 islands do , of course , grow and shrink to some extent but one does not observe the well - defined waves of phase transformation as in the global relaxation oscillation case .",
    "one sees that some @xmath7 islands persist throughout the global oscillation cycle and their shape changes slowly over several cycles .",
    "consequently , a different spatial mechanism underlies these harmonic oscillations .",
    "the automaton described in this paper incorporates the reactive processes in the adsorbed layer as well as phase transformations in the substrate .",
    "we have demonstrated that it is able to capture the essential of the features of catalytic @xmath0 oxidation oscillations on @xmath1 .",
    "the main emphasis of this study was the exploration of the spatial structure that underlies the global oscillatory dynamics .",
    "the nature of the global oscillations was found to depend sensitively on the coupling between the substrate phase transformations and the dynamics of the species in the adsorbed layer .",
    "this is evident from the variations in the oscillatory structure that occur when the diffusion coefficient of adsorbed @xmath0 is varied .",
    "the oscillations are regular in character when @xmath9 is large , or irregular , and eventually destroyed , when @xmath9 is small .",
    "this behaviour is connected with the formation and synchronization of @xmath7 and @xmath6 islands on the substrate . in the case of large diffusion the @xmath7 and @xmath6 islands are large but",
    "the adsorbed layer is disordered .",
    "when @xmath0 diffusion is small the islands are smaller in size but exist in the substrate and adsorbed layers .",
    "the dynamics in these two layers are strongly synchronized in this case .",
    "the form of the spatial structure in the @xmath2 surface also depends on the harmonic or relaxational character of the global oscillations , which can be tuned by varying @xmath79 , the partial pressure of @xmath0 . in the relaxation oscillation regime",
    "well defined waves of phase transformation sweep over the surface .",
    "one wave passes before new nucleation events begin another cycle the phase transformaion process .",
    "consequently one sees very regular global oscillations . in the harmonic region , close to the bifurcation boundary ,",
    "the global oscillations have small amplitude . as a result not",
    "all the surface is converted to the @xmath6 or @xmath7 phases .",
    "there are no well defined waves of phase transformation , instead certain islands remain locked in one surface phase over several global cycles and nucleation events fill the  seas \" between the islands .",
    "a rich surface structure underlies the global temporal evolution .",
    "this automaton is a promising tool for study more complex surface catalytic oxidation reactions .",
    "both the adsorbed layer kinetics and the nature of the surface reconstruction can be modified from that considered here .",
    "in particular , detailed studies of pattern formation at the mesoscopic level@xcite should be possible using such a model and the influence of fluctuations and the possible breakdown of deterministic descriptions can be considered .",
