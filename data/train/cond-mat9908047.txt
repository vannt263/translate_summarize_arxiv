    "it was early recognized that some of the infrared active c - axis phonon modes of the high - t@xmath5 cuprate superconductors ( htsc ) exhibit rather strong changes ( so - called ` phonon anomalies ' ) in the vicinity of the superconducting transition @xcite .",
    "the most pronounced phonon anomalies have been observed for those compounds which contain two ( or three ) closely spaced cuo@xmath0 layers per unit cell , like the bilayer compounds yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 ( y-123 ) @xcite , yba@xmath0cu@xmath8o@xmath9 ( y-124 ) @xcite and pb@xmath0sr@xmath0cacu@xmath10o@xmath9 @xcite , or the trilayer system tl@xmath0ba@xmath0ca@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath11 @xcite . in y-123 and y-124",
    "the most pronounced renormalization occurs for the so - called oxygen bond - bending mode at 320 @xmath12 which involves the in - phase vibration of the o(2 ) and o(3 ) oxygen ions of the cuo@xmath0 planes against the y - ion which is located in the center of the bilayer and against the ions of the cuo chains @xcite .",
    "the renormalization of the 320 @xmath3 mode is accompanied by the formation of an additional broad absorption peak in the frequency range between 400 to 500 @xmath3 at low temperature .",
    "the effects are most spectacular for strongly underdoped yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath13 with t@xmath1450 - 60 k. here the phonon mode at 320 @xmath3 softens by almost 20 @xmath3 and loses most of its spectral weight which is transferred to the additional broad peak . as the hole doping of the cuo@xmath0 planes increases , the anomaly of the 320 @xmath3 phonon mode becomes less pronounced .",
    "simultaneously , the additional peak shifts towards higher frequencies and becomes considerably weaker .",
    "evidently , there exists an intimate relationship between the strong anomaly of the oxygen bond - bending mode at 320 @xmath3 and the formation of the additional absorption peak .",
    "the underlying mechanism , however , is yet unknown and the subject of an ongoing discussion @xcite .",
    "recently van der marel and coworkers have proposed a very interesting explanation for the additional absorption peak @xcite .",
    "they assumed that the cuo@xmath0 planes of underdoped htsc are not coherently coupled , not even the closely spaced planes of the bilayers .",
    "from this point of view a bilayer superconductor like y-123 can be treated as a stack of two - dimensional superconducting layers which forms a superlattice of intra- and inter - bilayer josephson - junctions .",
    "the dielectric response of such a superlattice of josephson junctions exhibits two zero - crossings corresponding to two longitudinal josephson - plasmons : the inter - bilayer and the intra - bilayer one . in addition",
    ", it has a pole corresponding to the so called ` transverse optical josephson plasmon ' @xcite .",
    "van der marel have suggested that the additional absorption peak discussed above may correspond to this transversal resonance .",
    "very recently they have confirmed their suggestion by more quantitative considerations regarding the doping dependence of the peak position @xcite .",
    "some of us have shown that this model can be extended to account not only for the presence of the additional peak but also for the related phonon anomalies @xcite .",
    "the essential idea consists in including the local electrical fields acting on the ions that participate in the phonon modes .",
    "in particular , the model has allowed us to explain the details of the anomaly of the 320 @xmath3 phonon mode in y-123 .",
    "this has been shown to arise from a dramatic change of the local electrical field acting on the in - plane o(2)- and o(3)-ions caused by the onset of inter- and intra - bilayer josephson effects .",
    "the verification of the existence of intra - bilayer josephson plasmons , may have rather far reaching consequences .",
    "the finding that even the closely - spaced cuo@xmath0 layers are only weakly ( i.e. josephson ) coupled along the c - axis would favor models which predict that the electronic ground state of the cuo@xmath0 planes is unconventional , involving charge confinement to the planes and incoherent coupling between the planes in the normal state @xcite .",
    "so far , the existence of the josephson plasma resonance has been firmly established only for the case of cuo@xmath0 planes ( or pairs of planes ) that are separated by insulating layers much wider than the in - plane lattice constant .",
    "such examples are the studies of the c - axis transport @xcite , the microwave absorption @xcite or the fir c - axis conductivity @xcite .",
    "even two different longitudinal plasma modes have been recently observed in the t * phase smla@xmath15sr@xmath16cuo@xmath8 which has two kinds of blocking layers : the fluorite type sm@xmath0o@xmath0 layers and the rocksalt - type ( la , sr)@xmath0o@xmath0 layers @xcite .     in order to establish the above interpretation of the anomalies in the c - axis conductivity of underdoped y-123 , two points have to be clarified which have not been discussed in our previous communication @xcite .",
    "firstly , according to the model of the superlattice of inter- and intra - bilayer josephson junctions ( lets call it a josephson - superlattice - model ) the phonon anomalies should become very pronounced only below t@xmath5 , while they can appear somewhat above t@xmath5 for the strongly underdoped and most anisotropic samples as a result of pairing fluctuations within the bilayers . from the previous experimental results it was not clear whether this is the case .",
    "reflectance measurements performed on strongly underdoped y-123 single crystals rather seemed to indicate that the anomaly of the 320 @xmath3 phonon sets in well above t@xmath17 at a temperature t*t@xmath5 and proceeds without any noticeable change at t@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the temperature dependence of the phonon anomaly rather seemed to resemble @xcite that of the spin - lattice relaxation rate ( t@xmath18t)@xmath19 or the knight shift observed in nmr  experiments , both of which are determined by the to the so - called ` spin - gap phenomenon ' , i.e. , by a gradual and incomplete depletion of the low energy spin excitations .",
    "these speculations are supported by  zn substitution experiments : the zn substitution is known to suppress the spin - gap effect @xcite and it has also been shown to remove the anomaly of the 320 @xmath3 phonon mode and the additional absorption peak @xcite .",
    "second , the model predicts that the additional peak should acquire a considerable part of its spectral weight ( sw ) from the electronic background , to be more specific from the superconducting condensate @xcite .",
    "this prediction is not consistent with ref .",
    "@xcite where it has been suggested that the sw of the additional peak is fully accounted for by the spectral - weight loss ( @xmath20sw ) of the phonon modes at 320 and 560 @xmath3 .    in the following we report an ellipsometric study of the far - infrared ( fir ) c - axis dielectric response of two underdoped yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 single crystal : one strongly underdoped ( @xmath210.5 , t@xmath5=52 k ) , the other moderately underdoped ( @xmath210.25 , t@xmath5=80 k ) .",
    "in particular , we present a detailed analysis of the anomaly of the oxygen bond - bending mode at 320 @xmath3 and of the additional absorption peak . in case of the strongly underdoped crystal our ellipsometric measurements establish that the temperature - evolution of the phonon anomaly and the additional absorption peak exhibits a two - step behavior with a smooth onset at t*@xmath6150kt@xmath5=52 k followed by a sudden and steep change right at t@xmath5=52 k. for the moderately underdoped crystal the onset of the anomaly occurs in the vicinity of t@xmath5 . for both crystals our data establish that the absorption peak obtains only some part of its spectral weight from the phonon system while a substantial part ( at least 40 - 50% ) arises from the electronic background .",
    "the yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 single crystals with typical dimensions of 2x2x(0.5 - 1 ) mm@xmath22 have been grown in y - stabilized zr@xmath0o crucibles @xcite . for the ellipsometric measurements we used only crystals with a smooth and shiny as - grown surface containing the c - axis .",
    "a strongly oxygen deficient crystal has been prepared by sealing it in an evacuated quartz tube together with a large amount of y-123 powder whose oxygen content has been previously adjusted to @xmath210.5 ( by annealing in 0.1% o@xmath10 in ar at 530@xmath23{0xb0}}% % beginexpansion { { } ^\\circ}% % endexpansion $ ] c and subsequently quenching into liquid nitrogen ) .",

    "the critical temperature t@xmath5 and the transition width @xmath20t@xmath5 ( 10 to 90% of the diamagnetic shielding ) have been determined by dc - magnetization measurement in zero - field - cooled ( zfc ) and field - cooled ( fc ) mode ( h@xmath24=5 oe ) using a commercial squid magnetometer .",
    "figure 1 shows the temperature - dependent volume suszeptibility , @xmath25 , for the yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath4 crystal with t@xmath5=52 k and @xmath20t@xmath5=3 k ( open circles ) and the yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath7 crystal with t@xmath5=80 k and @xmath20t@xmath5=4 k ( solid squares ) .",
    "the quantity measured in ellipsometry @xcite is the complex reflectance ratio    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is the angle of incidence ( in our experiment 80@xmath23{0xb0}}% % beginexpansion { { } ^\\circ}% % endexpansion $ ] with a beam divergence of @xmath281.7@xmath23{0xb0}}% % beginexpansion { { } ^\\circ}% % endexpansion $ ] ) and @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the complex fresnel reflection coefficients for light which is polarized parallel ( @xmath31 ) and perpendicular ( @xmath32 ) to the plane of incidence , respectively .",

    "in general , different elements of the dielectric tensor can contribute to @xmath35 the formal inversion according to eq .",
    "( 2 ) then yields only a so - called pseudodielectric function @xcite . for the case of yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 , which is an almost uniaxial and strongly anisotropic material with metallic behavior of @xmath36 and insulating behavior of @xmath37 , it was previously shown that the pseudodielectric function represents a very good approximation for @xmath38 when the measurement is performed with the @xmath39-axis in the plane of incidence @xcite .",
    "the technique of ellipsometry provides significant advantages over conventional reflection methods : i ) it does not require the determination of the absolute intensity of the reflected light ( no reference problem ) and ii ) the complex dielectric function @xmath40 is obtained directly , no kramers- kronig transformation and thus no extrapolation of the reflectivity towards zero and infinite frequency is needed @xcite .",
    "the ellipsometric measurements have been performed at the u4ir beamline of the national synchrotron light source ( nsls ) at brookhaven national laboratory ( bnl ) , using a home - built setup attached to a nicolet fast - fourier spectrometer @xcite .",
    "the high brilliance of the synchrotron light source enables us to perform very accurate ellipsometric measurements in the far - infrared range even on samples with comparably small ac - faces of 0.5@xmath411 mm@xmath42 .",
    "since only relative intensities are required , the ellipsometric measurements are very reproducible and the data taken at a given temperature before and after thermal cycling or several days of measurement coincide to within the noise level .",
    "figure 2 shows the real part of the far - infrared ( fir ) c - axis conductivity @xmath44(@xmath45,t ) of the strongly underdoped yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath46 crystal with t@xmath5=52 k for ( a ) t=300 , 200 , and 150 k and ( b ) t=150 , 110 , 60 , 45 , 35 and 4 k. at room temperature the six infrared - active phonon modes at 155 , 190 , 280 , 320 , 560 and 630 @xmath3 are superimposed on a weak and almost featureless electronic background . as the temperature is lowered below room - temperature , the electronic background decreases continuously and develops the so - called normal - state gap ( ns gap ) or pseudogap which is a well known feature of the underdoped cuprate superconductors @xcite .",
    "evidently , this ns - gap starts to develop at some rather high temperature , t@xmath47 300 k. its characteristic frequency scale @xmath48 is fairly large and it even exceeds the measured spectral range , i.e. , @xmath49700 @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "figure 2 shows that the gradual onset of the renormalization of the oxygen bond - bending mode at 320 @xmath3 and the additional broad peak at 410 @xmath3 occurs around t * @xmath6150 k , i.e. , well below t@xmath50300 k but also well above t@xmath5=52 k. however , the most important feature that is evident in fig .",
    "2b is that both , the anomaly of the 320 @xmath3 phonon mode and the formation of the additional absorption peak at 410 @xmath51 exhibit very pronounced and steep changes right at t@xmath5=52 k. this finding implies that both effects are related to the superconducting transition rather than to the ns - gap or to the spin - gap phenomenon as has been previously suggested @xcite .",
    "the gradual onset of the anomalies at t * @xmath52t@xmath5 may be due to superconducting pairing fluctuations ( especially within the bilayers ) which become particularly pronounced for strongly underdoped and thus very anisotropic samples .",
    "we do not attempt here to comment on the rather controversial question of whether the ns - gap and/or the spin gap are also somehow related to the superconducting pairing fluctuations .",
    "we have performed a more quantitative data analysis by fitting to the complex dielectric function in the spectral range 250@xmath45700 @xmath3 a sum of modified lorentzian functions @xmath53 which represent the contributions of the phonon modes at 280 , 320 , 560 and 630 @xmath3 @xmath54 this modified lorentzian function which is obtained by mixing the real- and the imaginary parts of the usual lorentzian function ( it basically corresponds to a fano - like function ) allows one to perform kramers - kronig consistent fits of asymmetric phonon lineshapes @xcite . in agreement with previous reports @xcite , we find that only the phonon modes at 560 and 630 @xmath3 are very asymmetric and that the asymmetry q of these modes increases with decreasing temperature . in order to describe the flat electronic background and the additional broad absorption peak in a kramers - kronig consistent way we have also included a sum of seven broad lorentzian oscillators which have been located between 250 and 700 @xmath3 and whose half - widths  have been limited to values between 150 and 500 @xmath3 .    in our opinion",
    "this fitting procedure does not allow one to obtain an appropriate description of the phonon contribution since it assumes that all the ions participating in the phonon modes experience the same ( average ) electric field . instead , as motivated in ref .",
    "@xcite , we suggested that the local electric fields acting on the ions exhibit significant deviations from the average field as a result of the extremely weak electronic coupling between the individual cuo@xmath0 planes of underdoped cuprates .",
    "we have shown that the spectacular anomaly of the 320 @xmath3 phonon mode , and also the asymmetry and the sw changes of the phonon modes at 560 and 630 @xmath51 can be explained by such local field effects , in particular , by the changes of the local electrical fields caused by the onset of josephson - effects within the intra- and inter - bilayer junctions @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we nevertheless apply the simpler fitting procedure using modified lorentzian functions in order to obtain the temperature dependence of the parameters of the phonon modes which can be readily compared with previous results .",
    "figure 3 shows the temperature dependence of ( a ) the oscillator strength s , ( b ) the eigenfrequency @xmath55 and ( c ) the half - width @xmath56 of the oxygen bond - bending mode at 320 @xmath3 .",

    "we find that the half - width @xmath56 of the 320 @xmath3 mode starts to decrease only below t@xmath5=52 k @xcite .",
    "for t*tt@xmath5 it even tends to increase , but this small increase may be an artifact of our fitting procedure .",
    "figure 4 displays the electronic background including the additional peak around 400 @xmath3 which has been obtained by subtracting the contributions of the phonon modes at 280 , 320 , 560 @xmath3 and 630 @xmath3 .",
    "the formation of the additional peak show in fig .",
    "4 follows a similar temperature dependence like the anomaly of the 320 @xmath3 phonon mode .",
    "the broad peak gradually develops below t*@xmath6150 k and suddenly increases in magnitude below t@xmath5=52 k. evidently , the peak position does not change much as a function of temperature .",
    "below t@xmath58 the peak is very pronounced and therefore hardly affected by the subtraction of the phononic contribution .",
    "the frequency of the maximum decreases slightly from 410 @xmath3 at 5 k to 395 @xmath3 at 45 k. above t@xmath5 the peak becomes rather weak as compared to the phonon mode at 320 @xmath3 .",
    "we therefore can not reliably determine its position .",
    "nevertheless it is evident that it remains close to 400 @xmath3 .",
    "note that within the josephson - superlattice - model the peak position is expected to decrease only by about 30 @xmath3 as the temperature is increased above t@xmath5 .",
    "the position of the transverse plasmon is determined mainly by the intra - bilayer josephson - frequency which for strongly underdoped samples has been suggested @xcite not to exhibit any pronounced changes at t@xmath5 since the pairing fluctuations within the individual bilayers persist far above the macroscopic critical temperature t@xmath5 .",

    "5 illustrates how we have estimated the spectral weight of the additional peak sw@xmath59 ( shaded area ) by integrating the conductivity between 220 and 680 @xmath3 ( open circles ) and subtracting the contribution of a linear electronic background ( solid line ) .",
    "note that our assumption of a linear electronic background conductivity is supported by the high temperature data for tt*=150 k ( see fig .",
    "4a ) and by the data for less strongly underdoped samples where the additional peak is comparably weak and appears only below t@xmath5 ( see  ref .",
    "@xcite and discussion below ) .",
    "it is evident from fig .",
    "5 that the spectral weight losses of the phonon modes at 320 and 560 @xmath3 account only for some fraction of the spectral weight of the additional absorption peak at 410 @xmath3 .",
    "we estimate that at least 40 - 50 % of the spectral weight of the additional absorption peak does not arise from the phonon subsystem but instead seems to arise from the electronic continuum .",
    "such a redistribution of the electronic spectral weight towards the additional absorption peak is predicted by the josephson - superlattice - model where the transverse josephson plasmon acquires a sizeable fraction of the spectral weight of the sc condensate @xcite .",
    "this means that some fraction of the spectral weight removed in the fir - regime does not appear in the delta - function at zero frequency which describes the inductive response of the superfluid condensate but is instead shifted to the additional absorption peak representing the transversal josephson plasmon .",
    "in fact , our choice of the linear electronic background ( solid line ) is rather conservative .",
    "also shown in the inset is a fit with a lorentzian plus a linear electronic background conductivity ( dashed lines ) which gives a somewhat larger value of sw@xmath64 16.000 @xmath65@xmath66 at t=5 k. the result of this fit agrees surprisingly well with the prediction of the josephson - superlattice model that the sw of the bare transverse josephson - plasmon ( neglecting the interaction with the phonons and the consequent redistribution of the spectral weight of the 320 @xmath3 phonon mode , @xmath20sw@xmath67 @xmath65@xmath66 )  should be around 10.000 @xmath65@xmath66 @xcite .",
    "it has been reported previously that the spectral weight of the additional absorption peak can be fully accounted for by the spectral weight loss of the phonon modes at 320 and 560 @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "we note that this discrepancy between the conclusions of @xcite and ours does not arise from any significant differences in the experimental data but rather originates from the difference in the estimate of the electronic background .",
    "it seems that homes et al . obtained a lower spectral weight of the additional absorption peak by introducing an electronic background which develops a gap - like feature around 280 @xmath3",
    "( see for example fig .",
    "10 of ref .",
    "they argued that this gap feature is related to the ns gap .",
    "our recent ellipsometric data , however , do not support such an interpretation because they show that the onset frequency of the ns gap , @xmath68 , is significantly larger : it increases from @xmath69650 @xmath3 for slightly underdoped samples to @xmath70 @xmath3 for strongly underdoped samples . we have also shown that the temperature at which the signatures of the normal state ns - gap start to appear increases rather rapidly on the underdoped side and even exceeds room temperature for strongly underdoped samples  @xcite ( see also fig.2 ) .",
    "note that recent arpes- and tunneling experiments yield a similar temperature- and doping dependence of the ns - gap ( even the absolute values of the gap size agree reasonably well ) @xcite .",
    "this fact allows us to conclude that the characteristic energy- and temperature scales of the additional absorption peak and the ns - gap ( and also their doping dependence ) are very different which makes it rather unlikely that both have a common origin .",
