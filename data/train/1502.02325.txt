    "these positions are slightly different from those used by @xcite and @xcite , and were chosen to take advantage of horsehead whisper line survey .",
    "for the first two positions , we used the single - dish deep integrations obtained in the line survey and included beam dilution factors obtained from the higher - angular resolution pdbi observations when available .",
    "as no line survey has been made at the pah position , we derived the abundances directly from the pdbi observations . for @xmath1",
    ", we assumed the same spatial distribution of @xmath6-@xmath2 .",
    "we used the non - lte radiative transfer code radex @xcite for those species with known collisional rates , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath0 and @xmath6-@xmath2 ( ortho and para ) , taken from @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "the gas density was fixed to @xmath8 in the pdr , @xmath9 in the dense core @xcite and @xmath10 in the pah position .",
    "the kinetic temperature was left as a free parameter , the best fits being consistent with previous estimates of @xmath11  k and @xmath12  k in the pdr and dense core , respectively . for @xmath1 and @xmath3-@xmath2",
    "we constructed rotational diagrams .",
    "we note that @xmath0 and @xmath3-@xmath4 are not detected at the core position in the pdbi maps .",
    "we thus consider their derived abundances as upper limits .",
    "the inferred column densities and abundances with respect to total hydrogen nuclei are summarized in table  2 .",
    "the errors in the abundances take into account a 50% uncertainty in the assumed @xmath13 , which are inferred from the 1.2  mm dust continuum emission .",
    "@xcite derived the @xmath3-@xmath4 abundance at the pdr position using single - dish observations at @xmath14 angular resolution , and computing a beam filling factors by assuming that the @xmath3-@xmath4 emission filled a gaussian filament of @xmath15 width in the @xmath16 direction .",
    "this assumption was based on the morphology of the hco line emission , which shows a filament of roughly this width .",
    "the new pdbi observations at 6@xmath17 angular resolution show that the @xmath3-@xmath4 emission indeed arises from a @xmath15 filament , where the @xmath3-@xmath4  @xmath18 line is @xmath19 times brighter than what was observed with the 30 m .      in order to test our current knowledge of the gas - phase chemistry of hydrocarbons ,",
    "we have used an updated version of the one - dimensional , steady - state photochemical code from @xcite .",
    "the same model was used in @xcite , except we have now introduced the formation and destruction ( by @xmath20 ) rates of @xmath4 measured by @xcite , which have an inverse temperature dependence . for the physical conditions in the horsehead ( @xmath21 , @xmath22  k ) , this results in higher abundances of @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the model includes grain surface reactions for the formation of @xmath20 and other species , such as h@xmath23co and ch@xmath24oh , but only gas - phase reactions for the formation of hydrocarbons ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a detailed description of the model ) .    in high uv - flux pdrs ( @xmath25  k ) ,",
    "the formation of hydrocarbons starts with the formation of ch@xmath26 @xcite through the very endothermic reaction @xmath27 ch@xmath28 h @xcite . in the horsehead pdr , on the other hand , we find that the hydrocarbon gas - phase chemistry is initiated by reactions of @xmath29 with ch leading to c@xmath30 .",
    "further reactions with @xmath20 lead to the formation of c@xmath23h@xmath26 , c@xmath23h@xmath30 and c@xmath23h@xmath31 .",
    "the last two species recombine with electrons to form @xmath0 and c@xmath23h@xmath23 , respectively .",
    "c@xmath23h@xmath23 can react with @xmath29 to form @xmath4 , but in fact the dominant formation route of @xmath4 at the edge of the cloud involves reactions between @xmath0 and @xmath29 leading to c@xmath32 , followed by reactions with @xmath20 in the model . once @xmath4 is produced , it reacts with @xmath20 to form the c@xmath24h@xmath30 and c@xmath24h@xmath31 ions which then recombine with electrons to form @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",

    "the same conclusion can be drawn from the abundance ratios , where the match between observations and model is better at the pdr than at the pah position .",

    "the observed profiles are overlaid with error bars .",
    "the modeled line intensity profiles of @xmath0 and @xmath6-@xmath2 were computed by including the pdr model outputs ( @xmath20 density , @xmath44 and column density ) into the non - lte radiative transfer code radex . in order to investigate excitation effects on the position of the emission peak , we included two transitions with different upper level energies for each species : the @xmath6-@xmath2  @xmath45 ( @xmath46  k ) and @xmath0  @xmath47 ( @xmath48  k ) ( solid lines ) , and the @xmath6-@xmath2  @xmath49 ( @xmath50  k ) and @xmath51 ( @xmath52  k ) ( dashed lines ) .",
    "these lines were chosen because their upper level energies are closer to that of the @xmath3-@xmath4 @xmath18 line ( @xmath43  k ) .",
    "because there are no available collisional coefficients for @xmath3-@xmath4 , we assumed a constant excitation temperature along the cloud to compute its line intensity profile . in the model",
    "all hydrocarbons peak at the same position ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "however , our observations show that the @xmath3-@xmath4 emission peak is shifted compared to that of the other hydrocarbons .",
    "we note that the emission peak of @xmath0 and @xmath6-@xmath2 does not change significantly between the lower and higher energy transitions .",
    "we have checked that including a constant excitation temperature for @xmath0 and @xmath6-@xmath1 gives similar results .",
    "this suggests that the excitation temperature gradient in the horsehead takes place at very small spatial scales , and that the observed shift in the @xmath3-@xmath4 emission peak compared to the other hydrocarbons is not due to an excitation effect but reveals a real difference in the spatial distribution of their column densities that is not predicted by the current pure gas - phase chemical models .    in general ,",
    "the observed integrated intensity profile of all species is much broader than what the model predicts . in particular",
    ", the model underpredicts the @xmath3-@xmath4 emission in the first pdr layers ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "we run models with constant densities ( @xmath55 ) to explore the effect of the density profile on the @xmath3-@xmath4 intensity in the surface layers .",
    "we find that a higher density would slightly improve the agreement between model and observations , but it would not reproduce the observations of many other tracers ( e.g. , hco , @xmath20 , and dust continuum emission ) . therefore , an additional formation mechanisms such as pah photodestruction contributes to the formation of @xmath3-@xmath4 in these surface layers . indeed , it has been suggested that c@xmath23h@xmath23 , which would enhance the @xmath4 abundance through reactions with @xmath29 , could be a product of photochemistry of pahs @xcite .",
    "we have presented high - angular resolution ( @xmath5 ) observations of the hydrocarbon ion @xmath3-@xmath4 in the horsehead photo - dissociation region .",
    "the @xmath3-@xmath4 emission is concentrated toward the surface edge of the nebula , close to where other hydrocarbon chains , such as @xmath0 and @xmath6-@xmath2 , and the 7.7  @xmath7 m pah emission peak .",
    "however , in contrast to @xmath0 and @xmath6-@xmath2 , @xmath3-@xmath4 is only abundant in the first pdr layers with almost no emission deeper inside the cloud .",
    "@xmath3-@xmath4 is thus a good tracer of hydrocarbon photo - chemistry .",
    "moreover , @xmath3-@xmath4 peaks @xmath56 further outside the pdr than @xmath0 and @xmath6-@xmath2 , which can not be explained by an excitation effect .",
    "this is in contrast to what current gas - phase chemical models predict for the horsehead physical conditions , that is , that all the hydrocarbons should peak approximately at the same position as their chemistry is closely linked .",
    "the inferred @xmath3-@xmath4 abundance at the pdr from the new high - resolution observations is consistent with that derived by @xcite .",
    "in addition , we have computed the abundances of @xmath0 , @xmath2 and @xmath3-@xmath4 at three characteristic positions in the cloud .",
    "we find that a gas - phase chemical model can reproduce the hydrocarbon abundances , including the @xmath3-@xmath4 abundance , at the pdr but it underpredicts the @xmath0 , @xmath6-@xmath2 and @xmath3-@xmath4 abundances at the pah position , _",
    "i.e. _ , at the edge of the cloud or the first pdr layers . the fact that the disagreement between model and observations occurs at the edge of the cloud , where the pahs emission peaks , is consistent with a top - down hydrocarbon chemistry , where pahs and small carbonaceus grains are photo - eroded by the radiation field releasing small hydrocarbons into the gas - phase .",
    "the horsehead pdr is a clear case where this mechanism is efficient .",
    "laboratory experiments are , however , needed to quantify the amount of hydrocarbons and the specific products that can be produced from this mechanism , and how this affects the hydrocarbon chemistry .",
