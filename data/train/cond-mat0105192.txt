    "in spite of the large number of theoretical@xcite and experimental@xcite works published in recent years on the subject of charged excitons in quantum wells , only a very small number of them deals with positively charged excitons@xcite .",
    "different authors@xcite used the diffusion monte carlo technique to calculate the dependence of the binding energy of the positively charged exciton on the well width at zero magnetic field .",
    "stb and moradi@xcite reported low magnetic field results for the positively charged exciton spin - singlet state , which was calculated using a deterministic variational technique . to our knowledge , this is the only theoretical calculation on the magnetic field dependence of the @xmath1 energy . in the present paper",
    "we go beyond the small magnetic field limit and present results for the whole magnetic field range not only for the singlet but also for the triplet state .",
    "experimental evidence of the positive trion ( @xmath1 ) in gaas / algaas quantum wells was found by different groups@xcite .",
    "these results confirm the existence of both the spin - singlet state and the spin - triplet state at non zero magnetic field as was also found for the @xmath2 .",
    "the magnetic field dependence of the binding energy , on the other hand , can be rather different for the @xmath1 as compared to the @xmath2 .",
    "we extended our numerical technique , see ref .  , which we used for negatively charged excitons , to describe positively charged excitons in quantum wells under the influence of a magnetic field parallel to the quantum well axis .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ first - p ] we present the hamiltonian of the problem .",
    "the dependence of the binding energy on the well width is discussed in sec .",
    "[ first - pp ] . in sec .",
    "[ first - ppp ] the magnetic field dependence is investigated and we discuss the dependence of the average distance between different pairs of particles in the system as a function of the magnetic field .",
    "we point out the differences and similarities between the @xmath1 and the @xmath2 .",
    "the behaviour of the pair correlation functions is also studied for different magnetic fields . in sec .",
    "[ second - p ] we compare our results with the experimentally measured transition and binding energies . finally , in sec .",
    "[ third - p ] we summarize our results and present our conclusions .",
    "in the effective mass approximation the hamiltonian describing a positively charged exciton , i.e. x@xmath3 , in an uniform magnetic field b is : @xmath4 where @xmath5 ; @xmath6 are the masses and charges of the interacting particles and @xmath7 is the dielectric constant of the medium the particles are moving in and is taken the same for the well and barrier material .",
    "the confining potential is @xmath8 where w is the quantum well width , and the reference system is taken such that the origin of the coordinate system is at the center of the quantum well . for a gaas",
    "/ al@xmath9ga@xmath10as quantum well the heights of the square well confinement potentials are @xmath11 ev for the electrons and @xmath12 ev for the hole . if we consider the case when the magnetic field is applied along the growth axis of the well , i.e. @xmath13 , the hamiltonian becomes : @xmath14 is the component along the @xmath15-axis of the orbital momentum of the @xmath16th particle .",
    "the same considerations made in ref .   for the @xmath2 hold also in this case and the same functional form for the trial wave function which consists of a linear combination of deformed correlated wave functions is used to solve the hamiltonian . however , here the variational parameters @xmath17 which enter in the definition of the deformed gaussian functions can assume also negative values . for our numerical calculation",
    "we focus on a gaas / al@xmath18ga@xmath10as quantum well with @xmath19 . the parameters used are @xmath20 , @xmath21 @xmath22 and @xmath23 , which result in @xmath24 mev and @xmath25   .",
    "first , we study the binding energy of the positively charged exciton which is defined as @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are respectively , the total energy of an exciton and of a positively charged exciton in the quantum well and @xmath29 is the energy of a free hole in the quantum well of width w in the presence of a magnetic field b directed along the confinement direction . the dependence of the binding energy of the positively charged exciton spin - singlet state on the well width is shown in fig .",
    "[ xp - width ] ( solid curve ) in the absence of a magnetic field .",
    "our results are also compared with the monte carlo calculations of ref .",
    "( dotted curve ) .",
    "the results from the two theories differ by about 0.1 mev at @xmath30   .",
    "one reason for this difference could be attributed to the different choice for the value of the static dielectric constant ; we took it equal to 12.58 while in ref .",
    "it was taken equal to 12.5 . notice that while the binding energy is decreasing with increasing well width according to both theories our calculation shows a faster decrease of the positively charged exciton binding energy with increasing well width , this behaviour is particularly strong for the @xmath1 system .",
    "the symbols in fig .",
    "[ xp - width ] represent the experimentally measured values for the spin - singlet state binding energy of the @xmath1 for different quantum well width and different experiments.@xcite notice that these results are in good agreement with the theory of ref .",
    ", and agree with ours in the nominal error of the theory , i.e. @xmath31 . this error is estimated considering the digit to which we round off our result for the total energies , however due to the very good convergence of the calculation we expect the `` real error '' to be smaller than the estimated one . in general we would expect that the experimental energies are larger than the theoretical calculated ones because : 1 ) a non zero density of holes leads to a non zero fermi energy @xmath32 and it has been shown that the experimentally determined binding energy is in fact @xmath33 ; and 2 ) quantum well width fluctuations will localize the trion .",
    "both effects lead to a larger binding energy with respect to the one calculated theoretically for a free translational invariant trion .    in fig .",
    "[ xp - width ] , we also report the dependence of the negatively charged exciton binding energy on the well width ( dashed curve ) . notice that the @xmath1 binding energy is larger ( about @xmath34 ) as compared to the @xmath2 binding energy , both for our theory and for the one of ref .  .",
    "moreover this result is also in agreement with the experimental results which showed that the energy of the @xmath1 is larger@xcite or equal@xcite to the one of @xmath2 .",
    "stb and moradi@xcite found , on the other hand , that for a 300   wide  quantum well the binding energy of @xmath1 is lower than the one of @xmath2 which is opposite to our conclusion and to those of ref .  .",
    "it should be stressed that the theoretical value for the trion binding energy depends not only on the obtained value for the trion energy but also on the exciton energy . in out theory , the latter are both upper bounds to the exact result and consequently the trion binding energy is neither an upper nor a lower bound to the exact value .",
    "for example , an overestimation of the exciton energy will lead to an overestimation of the trion binding energy .",
    "next , we compare the dependence of the binding energy of the positively charged exciton on the magnetic field with the one of the negatively charged exciton , for a quantum well of width 100   ( see fig .  [ 100aa ] ) . notice that while for @xmath35  t we obtain @xmath36 , which is in agreement with the @xmath37  t behaviour as shown in fig .  [ xp - width ] . for @xmath38",
    "t the relation between the two energies is reversed and the negatively charged exciton becomes more strongly bound .",
    "moreover while the @xmath2 singlet binding energy quickly increases up to about 2.5 mev for @xmath39 t after which it saturates , the @xmath1 binding energy increases slowly from about 1.2  mev at @xmath37 up to about 1.5 mev for @xmath40 t , where it starts to decrease slowly .",
    "we found a similar behaviour for the binding energy in the case of a quantum well of width 200  ( see fig .",
    "[ 200-bin ] ) . for the latter quantum well width we also calculated the spin - triplet state with @xmath41 ( dashed - dotted line in fig .",
    "[ 200-bin ] ) .",
    "the triplet state is unbound at low magnetic field and becomes bound around 1 t. we also find that the binding energy of this state increases rather fast with increasing magnetic field and eventually we observe a crossing around @xmath42 t. this behaviour is consistent with the one found for the negatively charged exciton where we found that when the hole mass was much larger than the electron one no spin - singlet spin - triplet transition was observed . however , when the hole mass was decreased considerably such singlet - triplet transition occurred . in that case",
    "the hole mass was always larger than the electron one , however it is reasonable to assume that decreasing further the hole mass the singlet - triplet transition would still be observed . here",
    "the roles of the hole and the electron are switched and the electron mass is much smaller than the hole one . as a consequence",
    "this is then consistent with the fact that we now find a singlet - triplet transition .    the average distance between pairs of particles of the trion in the plane orthogonal to the quantum well axis , i.e. @xmath43 , is shown in fig  [ average - chapter4 ] as function of the magnetic field for quantum well of width 200  .",
    "notice that for @xmath37 the average distance between the positively charged exciton pairs , i.e.  hole - hole and electron - hole ones , are smaller than the correspondent one for the negatively charged exciton . in particular",
    "the difference is more pronounced for the pair of particles with the same charge ( i.e.  hole - hole in case of @xmath1 versus electron - electron in @xmath2 ) .",
    "since the attractive and the repulsive contribution to the potential are inversely proportional to the average interparticle distance , the behaviour at @xmath37 explains the fact that we find a lower binding energy for the @xmath2 than for the @xmath1 at @xmath37 .",
    "notice that around 1  t the average distance of the electron - hole pair in @xmath2 crosses the one of @xmath1 , this is the same magnetic field at which the @xmath2 binding energy becomes larger than the @xmath1 binding energy .",
    "for increasing magnetic field the ratio between the average distance between the electron - electron and electron - hole pair in @xmath2 is rather constant .",
    "looking at the corresponding pairs in @xmath1 we see that the distance between the electron and hole diminishes with increasing magnetic field but less than the one between the two holes .",
    "this could explain the slow increase and then the decrease already at low magnetic fields of the @xmath1 binding energy against the fast increase and saturation of the @xmath2 binding energy .",
    "we calculated also the pair correlation function for the positive trion in the confinement direction , @xmath44 , and in the orthogonal plane , @xmath45 , both at @xmath37 and at @xmath46 t ( see fig .",
    "[ corr - xp ] ) .",
    "notice that along the @xmath15-axis , fig .",
    "[ corr - xp](a ) , both the hole - hole and the electron - hole pair correlation function have a peak around the center of the quantum well , which is in agreement with the fact that the coulomb interaction plays a minor role as compared to the confinement due to the presence of the quantum well .",
    "notice also that , as expected , the presence of a magnetic field has only a very small influence on the correlation function in the @xmath15-direction . in the @xmath47-plane ,",
    "[ corr - xp](b ) , we observe that the electron - hole pair correlation is peaked around zero , i.e. the electron and the hole maximize their interaction by staying as close as possible to each other .",
    "the hole - hole pair correlation function has instead a peak around the average pair inter - particle distance .",
    "when a magnetic field is applied the peak of the hole - hole pair correlation function is shifted towards lower @xmath47 .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the average pair inter - particle distance decreases with increasing magnetic field .",
    "in fig .  [ 200-bin ] , we compare the binding energy of the @xmath1 and of the @xmath2 singlet state for a 200   wide quantum well with the experimental results obtained by glasberg _",
    "_ @xcite and the very recent results yusa _ et al._@xcite ( open triangles ) . when comparing the experimental results with our theoretical results we notice that for @xmath37 the experimental and theoretical result for the negatively charged exciton binding energy differ by about 0.3 mev , which may be due to a non - zero density effect and/or to localization induced by quantum well width fluctuation . in the range",
    "@xmath48 t@xmath49 t there is very good agreement between theory and experiment . for @xmath50 t the experimental binding energy saturates , while this occurs at higher fields for our theoretical results .",
    "the agreement of the @xmath2 singlet energy with the very recent experimental results of the same group@xcite is on the other hand remarkable .",
    "not only theoretical but also experimental results improve with time .    for the @xmath1 spin - singlet state binding energy , the agreement is rather good over the whole magnetic field range at which experimental results are available .",
    "however at low magnetic fields the theoretical binding energy underestimates the experimental value . it has been argued that this effect can be attributed to localization effects due to quantum well width fluctuations .",
    "notice that localization effects are less important on the positively charged exciton than on the negatively charged exciton , which is consistent with the larger mass of the holes and which leads to a less extended trion ( see fig .",
    "[ average - chapter4 ] ) . for the @xmath1 spin - triplet state a comparison with the experimental data by glasberg _",
    "et al._@xcite shows a good agreement for magnetic fields up to about 3 t. beyond 3 t the experimental energy saturates while the theory still predicts an increasing binding energy with increasing magnetic field .",
    "the present work is the first theoretical work in which a detailed comparison is made between experimental and theoretical singlet and triplet binding energies of the positively charged exciton .",
    "the theoretical results explain the different magnetic field dependence of the @xmath2 and @xmath1 ground state binding energy , which was observed experimentally .",
    "namely the @xmath1 singlet has a very weak magnetic field dependence while the @xmath2 singlet binding energy increases rapidly in the low magnetic field region and saturates at higher fields .",
    "we find good qualitative and quantitative agreement with the available experimental results .",
    "the @xmath1 triplet binding energy on the other hand increases with magnetic field and we predict for a quantum well of width 200   a singlet - triplet crossing at @xmath51 t. the experiments of ref .",
    "show a saturated triplet binding energy for @xmath52 t , which we do not find in our theoretical results .",
