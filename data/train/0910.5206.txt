    "some physicists have claimed that it is possible to roughly classify its science branches in physics of small , big and finally complex systems .",
    "although such classification may appear simple , it suits very well for the present work .",
    "complex systems are known as entities composed of a large number of agents sharing a rich set of simple and non linear interactions . in such systems ,",
    "different behaviors can be achieved if the interaction change , even if the interacting agent remains the same .",
    "these systems are well modeled by using network concepts , where the agents are called nodes , and interactions appear as links .",
    "since the release of the barabsi and albert paper @xcite about growing networks , a lot of knowledge has been achieved regarding the topology and properties of such objects @xcite . in addition , it was found that these types of networks can be found in a variety of fields like social relation , voting , disease spreading , the www , neural and regulatory networks @xcite .",
    "the interaction among nodes of a network can be modeled in very different ways . in the most simple models",
    ", it is assumed that ( i ) nodes can only have two states @xmath3 ( _ off _ ) or @xmath2 ( _ on _ ) , and that ( b ) the dynamics is done via boolean functions .",
    "these models , very suitable for simulations _ in silico _ , can be be very useful to study agents that interact using _ on / off _ states as happens in gene expression / repression @xcite and protein activation / inhibition @xcite .",
    "models involving boolean dynamics are called random boolean networks ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "the first @xmath5 model was introduced by stuart kauffman , and it is known as @xmath6 model since it was composed by @xmath7 nodes , each one with its own random @xmath8 inputs , and with the boolean functions randomly chosen @xcite .    in general ,",
    "all @xmath4 share some common features .",
    "they are directed networks with @xmath7 nodes , and a node @xmath9 has @xmath10 inputs that regulate its next state via some random boolean function @xmath11 .",
    "the topology of the interactions can be expressed by using a proper connectivity distribution of inputs @xmath12 and the type of the boolean functions can be changed in order to adequate the restrictions imposed by the problem .",
    "the boolean functions can be chosen basically in two different ways : ( a ) all functions are chosen _ a priori _ , and they are kept constant during time evolution - the so - called _ quenched _ models ; and ( b ) the functions change during the dynamics , meaning that for each time step , each node have a new function - the so - called _ annealed _ models .",
    "another important dynamical feature is the update of the nodes . in the synchronous or parallel mode ,",
    "all nodes are updated simultaneously in each time step . on the other hand , in the asynchronous or serial mode",
    ", first we randomly choose a node that is updated immediately ; then this procedure is repeated until we have updated @xmath7 nodes in a single time step .",
    "recently scale - free distributions came up in the arena of @xmath4 in order to match biological network scenarios .",
    "the first works have only used computer simulations @xcite .",
    "later , some authors have focused on analytical approaches @xcite giving a more detailed insight of the problem . in this work",
    "we study random boolean dynamics in scale - free networks . in our model",
    "we have nodes with boolean variables @xmath13 .",
    "the connections among nodes obey the topological structure of scale - free networks and the relation among nodes variables is performed via randomly chosen boolean functions .",
    "we suppose that the dynamics is driven only by xor and and functions , which appear for each node with probabilities @xmath1 and @xmath0 , respectively .",
    "we chose the and and xor logical functions in order to simplify the model , avoiding the necessity of defining @xmath14 different boolean relations for each node .",
    "note that any boolean function can be written as a linear combination of and , xor and or .",
    "the chosen functions are examples of extreme cases .",
    "when the and function is applied to a set with @xmath8 boolean variables , we will obtain 1 only if _ all _ variables are 1 s . on the other hand , when the xor function is applied to the same set , we will obtain 1 if the number of 1 s of the set is odd .",
    "these observations imply that and represents a very selective dynamical rule , only one configuration of the @xmath15 possible ones furnishes 1 as output , while xor is related to a non - selective dynamical one because half of the set configurations give 1 as output .",
    "moreover , it is known from previous works that the and function leads to an ordered regime with two fixed points , where all variables are 0 s or 1 s , and that the dynamical behavior generated by the xor function is more complex . since this kind of functions are the boolean counterparts of real reactions in cell regulatory system @xcite , they are important to the study of biologic networks .",
    "we choose the parallel mode as updated method . in order to compare with another models , and for technical reasons",
    ", we also study such dynamics in networks without a scale - free topology .",
    "the kauffman nk model is briefly discussed as well .",
    "we performed two distinct types of dynamics . in the first case the node that will be updated is regulated only by the nodes which are connected to it .",
    "rarely the node is connected to itself .",
    "it means that its state is defined by the state of its neighbors , and its own state is almost never taken into account . in the second case",
    "we explore self - regulation , which means that the new state of the updating node is defined by its neighbors and always for its own state .",
    "we choose to study such case because self - regulation is a well know feature of genetic regulatory networks @xcite . in section",
    "ii we introduce the scale - free networks and the boolean dynamics used in this work .",
    "the numerical simulations of the scale - free networks are discussed in section iii . in section",
    "iv we present a mean - field ( annealed ) approximation for these dynamics , leading to an analytical way to calculate the average density of @xmath16 and the hamming distance .",
    "we apply the annealed approximation to networks without a scale - free topology , to the kauffman nk model and to scale - free networks .",
    "the comparison between the numerical results and those of the annealed approximation is presented in section v. we summarize our results in the last section .",
    "we have generated two classes of distinct networks , classified by the smallest number of links that a node can have , in other words , by the smallest possible connectivity @xmath17 of the network .",
    "these networks were grown by the _ growing network with re - direction _",
    "algorithm @xcite and can be classified as    * @xmath18  a node of the network , called old node , is selected with uniform probability ; then a new node is linked to it with probability @xmath19 or it is redirected to the ancestor of the old node with probability @xmath20 ; * @xmath21  a new node has two links ; the first link with an old node , selected with uniform probability , is established with probability @xmath19 or it is redirected to one of the two ancestors of the old node with probability @xmath20 ; the same procedure is repeated for the second link .    for @xmath18 ,",
    "initially we have three nodes cyclically connected ( the ancestors of nodes 1 , 2 and 3 are 3 , 1 and 2 respectively ) .",
    "a new node is randomly connected to an old node ( one of the three initial nodes ) .",
    "then , this new link can be redirected to the ancestor of the old node with probability @xmath20 .",
    "this growing algorithm is repeated until we have @xmath7 nodes in the network . when @xmath21 , each one of the initial three nodes has the other two nodes as ancestors .",
    "now , a new node is randomly connected to two old nodes , and each new link can be redirected to the ancestor with probability @xmath20 .",
    "we repeat this procedure until we have a network with @xmath7 nodes .",
    "these algorithms create scale - free networks characterized by a connectivity distribution @xmath22 with @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "when @xmath24 , the nodes are linked in a entirely random fashion and for @xmath25 , all nodes are connected to one of the three initial nodes ( super - hubs ) .",
    "the linear preferential attachment model of barabsi and albert is obtained for @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) . in this work ,",
    "we consider three typical values of @xmath20 : @xmath26 ( the barabsi and albert model ) , @xmath28 , representing models with large hubs and @xmath29 , representing models with small hubs .    a logical variable @xmath30 is assigned to each node @xmath9 and the state of the network at time @xmath31",
    "is represented by a set of boolean variables @xmath32 . each variable @xmath30 is controlled by @xmath10 elements of the network @xmath33 . if @xmath21 , @xmath10 is the connectivity of @xmath9-th node and the control elements are the nodes connected to it .",
    "when @xmath18 , we have nodes with only one link . since we need two inputs to apply the boolean functions , it is natural to assume that the node itself must always participate of the dynamics .",
    "now , the control elements are the @xmath9-th node itself and nodes connected to it .",
    "it means that each node has an extra link to itself ( self - regulation ) . in this case , @xmath10 is the connectivity plus 1 .",
    "the dynamics is given by @xmath34 where @xmath11 is the random function @xmath35 that is assigned to each node @xmath9 . here",
    "@xmath1 is an external parameter that controls how the logical functions and and xor are distributed in the network .",
    "an initial state @xmath36 is created by assigning randomly 0 s and 1 s to all nodes .",
    "a damaged copy @xmath37 of the initial state is also created by changing the value of only one randomly chosen node . since the hamming distance of two configurations is the number of nodes that have different values in these configurations , the hamming distance between @xmath36 and @xmath37 is 1 . both the initial state and its copy evolve under the control of equation ( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "once the new state of all nodes is calculated the entire network is updated ( synchronous update ) and the system goes to the next monte carlo time step ( mcs ) .",
    "we characterize the dynamical behavior by the average density of 1 s @xmath38 and by the average of the hamming distance @xmath39 here , @xmath40 is an average over the initial states ( @xmath36 , @xmath37 ) , and over sets of links of a grown network with a specific @xmath41 and with the same @xmath1 .    after a transient time",
    "these quantities reach the stationary values @xmath42 and @xmath43 that can be defined as @xmath44 @xmath45",
    "in order to consider finite size effects , we grew networks with @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 nodes .",
    "the averages were performed with a number of samples varying from @xmath49 ( large @xmath1 and large @xmath7 ) up to @xmath50 ( small @xmath1 and small @xmath7 ) .",
    "the probability @xmath1 was taken in the interval @xmath51 $ ] for the three values of @xmath20 ( @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 ) . since for @xmath55 the averages quantities",
    "were very small , we decided that a good lower limit was @xmath56 .",
    "the upper limit @xmath57 was chosen because the values of the average quantities were similar , in a log - log scale .",
    "the stationary values , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , were reached after a very short transient time ( @xmath58 mcs ) .",
    "estimations of @xmath42 and @xmath43 , which are defined in eqs .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) and ( [ eq6 ] ) , were performed by considering @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "these stationary values remain basically the same if we increase both @xmath31 and @xmath61 .",
    "we can see from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] that @xmath42 behaves as a power function of type @xmath62 for the entire range of @xmath1 . by comparing the behavior of the smallest network ( @xmath46 ) with the largest one ( @xmath48 ) we can see that finite size effects are small for @xmath42 .",
    "moreover , it seems that the exponent @xmath63 does not depend on @xmath20 . in order to evaluate the exponent @xmath63",
    "we coalesce all different sets ( @xmath7 varying from @xmath64 up to @xmath65 and @xmath20 from 0.35 up to 0.8 ) and we do a best fit .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "we obtain that @xmath66 with @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "note that we have evaluated the exponent by considering approximately 2 orders of magnitude in the @xmath1 variable and that the fit is very good .",

    "plots of @xmath43 versus @xmath1 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] for @xmath26 and networks with different sizes .",

    ", @xmath43 grows exponentially . by comparing the behavior of networks with different sizes",
    ", we observe that finite size effects are now important .",
    "it turns out that all results can be well fitted by @xmath72 with @xmath73 and @xmath74 depending on the size of the network and on the parameter @xmath20 .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "when @xmath75 , we have that @xmath76 .",
    "the simulation for the networks with @xmath21 were realized in the same way that for @xmath18 , and the probability @xmath1 was taken in the interval @xmath77 $ ] for @xmath78 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the range of @xmath1 is rather narrow in this case , since the dynamics for @xmath21 is more sensible to @xmath1 values , leading to @xmath79 and @xmath80 when @xmath81 .",
    "this behavior perhaps is related to the one found for rbn with only part of the canalyzing functions as update functions , @xmath82 , and small @xmath83 , where @xmath83 is the probability that a connection be excitatory @xcite .",
    "[ fig7 ] is similar to fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , where all sets of @xmath20 and @xmath7 are coalesced in one plot .",

    "[ fig8 ] , the hamming distance @xmath43 follows a linear dependence with @xmath1 for large values of @xmath1 ( the plot shows @xmath87 ) . in this region",

    "however , the behavior of @xmath43 for @xmath92 does not provide any suitable fit since for low values of @xmath1 we have a high concentration of and function and a low concentration of xor function , leading most of nodes to the @xmath3 state .    note that results discussed in this section are valid for other values of @xmath20 .",
    "we discuss only the cases @xmath26 ( linear preferential attachment ) , one case with @xmath93 ( @xmath29 or @xmath78 ) and one case with @xmath94 ( @xmath28 or @xmath95 ) because they represent typical behaviors .",
    "we have simulated other cases , with less samples , and the results are similar .",
    "although we present @xmath96 for the initial condition @xmath97 , we have also simulated cases with @xmath98 .",
    "we find similar results , probably because this new initial condition is a later state of the initial condition with the smallest hamming distance . in the next section",
    "we will develop a mean - field approach in order to see if its results agree with the numerical ones just obtained .",
    "in this section we present a mean - field approach ( mf ) .",
    "it is based on a work of derrida and pomeau @xcite , in which an annealed approximation was done for the kauffman @xmath6 model .",

    "although the model is defined by quenched disorder , i.e , the boolean function @xmath11 and the @xmath8 nodes connected to each node @xmath99 are only randomly chosen at the initial time , in the derrida and pomeau approximation it is assumed an annealed disorder .",
    "it means that the boolean function and the @xmath8 nodes are randomly chosen at each time step .",
    "moreover , in such approximation the effect of the boolean functions on a node is described by probabilities that the output be 0 and 1 .",
    "the approximation to our problems is similar to that of derrida and pomeau .",

    "instead of using a probabilistic description for the effect of the boolean functions , we determine the effect of applying the xor and and operators in each configuration .",
