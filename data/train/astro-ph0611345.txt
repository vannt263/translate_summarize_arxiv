    "super - massive black holes are predicted to be surrounded by clusters of compact stellar remnants , i.e. , stellar mass black holes and neutron stars",
    ". dynamical friction @xcite on less massive background stars transfers these remnants closer to the smbh @xcite . for the case of our galactic centre",
    ", stellar mass black holes can be collected into the central parsec from a sphere with radius about 4 parsec @xcite .",
    "@xcite updated and quantified @xcite estimates and showed that black holes will force most of low mass stars out of the central region with size @xmath0 parsec around sgr  a@xmath1 . in their model , black holes form a central cluster of this size and number about @xmath2 .",
    "the total mass of these black holes is around @xmath3 of sgr  a@xmath1 s mass @xcite . @xcite",
    "have recently modelled the dynamical mass segregation in the central few parsec of our galaxy with state of the art monte carlo methods , largely confirming results of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in addition , it was shown that the central parsec contains neutron stars in numbers comparable to that of the black holes .",
    "recent observations of young massive stars near sgr  a@xmath1  suggest that these stars may also be born in situ with an unusually top - heavy mass function @xcite .",
    "the remnants of the young stars born in situ will contribute to the cusp of black holes and neutron stars formed by the dynamical friction .",
    "@xcite discussed the possibility that compact remnants will be accreting gas from molecular clouds that may be unusually dense near our gc . in this paper we set out to explore this idea in more detail and",
    "also speculate on the implications for observations of agn in general .",
    "our model includes a realistic form for the radiative efficiency of these sources motivated by the observations of radiatively inefficient accretion flows in x - ray binaries .",
    "we integrate over the black hole velocity distribution to obtain a time - average estimate of total x - ray luminosity of the cluster as a function of the mass of the embedded gaseous accretion disc .",
    "we find that at low disc masses , most of the stellar remnants accrete at highly sub - eddington radiatively inefficient rates , and are quite dim . however , there are always few that almost co - move with the gas in the disc .",
    "these objects achieve relatively large accretion rates .",
    "since the smbh itself becomes radiatively inefficient at low disc masses , our model predicts that clusters of stellar remnants may actually outshine the smbh in this low luminosity agn ( llagn ) regime . at the high luminosity , high disc mass regime",
    ", the super - massive black hole should dominate bolometrically .",
    "stellar remnants may however be important in certain wavelengths .",
    "we shall first make order of magnitude estimates to motivate a more detailed treatment .",
    "a stellar mass black hole of mass @xmath4 , ploughing through a gas cloud , is capturing gas at the @xcite accretion rate : @xmath5 where @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the ambient gas density , sound speed and the relative velocity between the black hole and the gas , respectively .",
    "consider first the situation in the central parsec of our galaxy .",
    "stellar velocity dispersion , @xmath9 , is of the order of a few hundred km / sec there .",
    "the number of black holes , @xmath10 , moving with respect to gas with a relative velocity smaller than @xmath8 is of the order of @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the total number of stellar mass black holes , @xmath13 is the escape velocity , and @xmath14 is the volume filling factor of cold gas in the region . for an estimate , take @xmath15 and @xmath16 . in that case ,",
    "@xmath17 for @xmath18 km / sec .",
    "there thus should be few stellar mass black holes travelling through the gas at @xmath19 km / sec . neglecting the gas sound speed in equation 1 , the bondi - hoyle capture rate is @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the gas density in hydrogen atoms per @xmath22",
    ", @xmath23 is mean molecular weight in units of proton mass , and @xmath24 km / sec .",
    "this accretion rate is quite small compared to the eddington limit of @xmath25 year@xmath26 if @xmath27",
    ". however , gas density can be much higher .",
    "the hot x - ray emitting gas in the inner parsec of our galaxy has density of @xmath28 @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "if we assume cool gas clouds to be in pressure equilibrium with the hot gas , then the cool gas density could be as high as @xmath30 @xmath29 .",
    "therefore we could in principle expect several stellar mass black holes accreting gas at rates corresponding to @xmath31 of their eddington rates .",
    "since sgr  a@xmath1  produces only @xmath32 erg / sec in x - rays @xcite , the brighter of the accreting black holes can actually outshine sgr  a@xmath1  in x - rays .    in the case of a reasonably bright quasar or an agn accreting through a parsec scale accretion disc , we can estimate the gas density in the disc in the following way . in order to be stable against self - gravitational collapse ,",
    "the disc s @xcite @xmath33-parameter should be smaller than unity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the gas density in the disc satisfies @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the critical density at which the disk is marginally self - gravitating .",
    "numerically , @xmath36 where @xmath37 , @xmath38 parsec and @xmath39 is proton s mass . for such large gas densities , even black holes with very large differential velocity @xmath8 , e.g. ,",
    "@xmath40 km / s , would accrete at their super - eddington rates : @xmath41 in practice , this implies that _ every _ black hole crossing the agn accretion disc captures the material at or above its eddington accretion rate .",
    "a black hole co - moving with the gas , e.g. with @xmath42 , is predicted to accrete at a very large accretion rate by the equation 1 .",
    "however , in reality gas must be in a keplerian differential rotation about the smbh .",
    "thus , even if gas exactly coincident with the stellar mass black hole has zero relative velocity , the neighbouring regions will have @xmath43 .",
    "in such situation , the sphere of influence of the stellar mass black hole is the hill s radius @xmath44 @xcite , and the maximum accretion rate is of order of @xmath45 we thus require @xmath46\\;.\\ ] ]      as is well known , standard accretion discs have a very high radiative efficiency : @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "however , at low dimensionless accretion rates , @xmath48 , radiative efficiency is predicted to be much smaller since electrons in the flow may be cooler than protons @xcite and since gas outflows may be important @xcite . for definitiveness , we follow the @xcite model , in which @xmath49 for @xmath50 , and @xmath51 .",
    "this model seems to be compatible with x - ray observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "joining the two accretion regimes smoothly , and assuming that roughly 10% of the bolometric luminosity comes out in the x - ray band , we write @xmath52 where @xmath53 . for accreting neutron stars ,",
    "the radiative efficiency is assumed to be always large and equal to @xmath54 due to the presence of hard surface .",
    "black holes in collisionless cusps around smbhs are expected to have the isotropic @xcite space - velocity distribution .",
    "this distribution is a good approximation to the recent detailed monte - carlo simulations @xcite , in which the radial black hole density distribution found to follow the law @xmath55 . to keep our analysis analytically simple , we approximate this law to @xmath56 , in which case the black hole space and velocity distribution is particularly simple ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath57 where we also assume @xmath58 , the radius of the black hole cluster around the smbh .",
    "the constant @xmath59 is set by requiring @xmath60 . using this velocity distribution",
    ", we calculate the total accretion rate onto the stellar mass black holes , assuming that gas moves on circular keplerian orbits in a thin disk of half thickness @xmath61 .",
    "@xmath62 note that , except for very high accretion rates , @xmath63 , and hence the expression under the velocity integral does not depend on @xmath64 .",
    "we make one further approximation , writing @xmath65 .",
    "this is justified since most emission arises from the edge of the black hole cluster , i.e. @xmath66 .",
    "this is so because that region contains most of black holes and they also have the smallest @xmath8 , as @xmath67 is smaller than in the inner regions .",
    "we thus have , @xmath68 in this simple model , the total accretion rate onto stellar mass black holes scales linearly with the disc mass .",
    "the total luminosity of the black hole cluster is given by a similar equation to [ mtot ] but with the additional @xmath69 ( equation [ eff ] ) included under the sign of the integral .",
    "a more detailed treatment of this problem is underway ( deegan & nayakshin , in preparation ) . in this monte carlo",
    " like approach , we follow trajectories of accreting objects explicitly , and treat both capture of gas and `` small '' scale disc accretion in a time - dependent manner .",
    "the results are consistent with those obtained in this paper but show a large time - variability , as expected .      in the absence of a reliable theory which would connect accretion disk properties at parsec scales to the inner regions of accretion flows on smbh at both low and high mass accretion rate regimes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we model the accretion onto the smbh in the following way .",
    "we estimate the viscous time scale for accretion through the disk as @xmath70 @xcite .",
    "the accretion rate onto the smbh is then @xmath71 the disc height scale @xmath72 is calculated assuming the hydrostatic balance as long as the disc is non - self - gravitating ( i.e. , relatively low - mass ) .",
    "for simplicity we assume disk temperature is equal to 100 kelvin .",
    "the results depend weakly on this value as @xmath73 in this regime . for more massive self - gravitating disks ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we assume @xmath74 , which translates into @xmath75 . the smbh luminosity is calculated in the same way as for the stellar mass black holes , i.e. @xmath76 , where @xmath69 is given by equation [ eff ] .",
    "with this model we now calculate two examples .",
    "the first one is based on the up to date models of the central parsec of our galaxy ( * ? ? ?",
    "* e.g. , ) , and the second is for the @xmath77 smbh case . for both of these we assumed the total mass of the stellar mass black holes to be 5% of the mass of the central smbh . for the gc , this yields @xmath78 , whereas @xmath79 for the more massive galactic nucleus .",
    "the black hole cluster is assumed to extend to @xmath80 pc for sgr  a@xmath1  case @xcite , and to @xmath81 pc for the other case .",
    "we also calculate the expected x - ray emission from neutron stars in the cluster , taken to be as numerous as the stellar mass black holes @xcite but have the mass of 1.4 @xmath82 .",
    "note that in this paper we consider neutron stars to be magnetic field free .",
    "if their fields are strong enough , the `` propeller effect '' may reduce the x - ray luminosity of neutron stars @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : fig1 ] shows the x - ray luminosities of : the smbh ( dotted ) , the cluster of stellar mass black holes ( solid ) , and the neutron star cluster ( dashed ) as a function of the accretion disc mass .",
    "the left panel shows the gc case , whereas the right panel shows the @xmath83 smbh case .",
    "the main prediction of figure [ fig : fig1 ] is that at high disc masses the black hole cluster emission is negligible compared to that of the smbh , but at smaller disc masses the situation is reversed .",
    "this is understood as following . at the highest disc masses ,",
    "all of the components considered accrete at rates approaching their respective eddington limits .",
    "as the smbh is more massive than the cusps we model , it is brighter than the stellar mass compact remnants . at very low disc masses , on the contrary , the smbh accretes in the radiatively inefficient regime , and it is quite dim . at the same time , the accretion rates onto the stellar mass black holes span a wide range according to a range in the relative velocities @xmath8 . though small in numbers , black holes with small relative velocities",
    "dominate the radiative output of the cluster since the radiative efficiency for them is largest ( see equation [ eff ] ) .",
    "we now discuss the observational implications of our results in greater detail .",
    "it is only in the centre of our own galaxy that we have observational constraints on the distribution of gas and x - ray sources in the inner parsec .",
    "the dominant reservoir of cold gas in the inner parsec of our gc is the so - called minisprial @xcite .",
    "this morphologically complicated feature covers a good fraction of the inner parsec in projection .",
    "it is believed to be mildly geometrically thick , and have temperature and density of order of @xmath84 k and @xmath85 , respectively .",
    "the high temperature is maintained by photo - ionisation via radiation of nearby luminous massive stars .",
    "the mass of the mini - spiral was estimated at @xmath86 @xcite , although observational uncertainties are large , and the real mass could be as high a factor of 10 larger ( t. paumard , private communication ) .    with @xmath87 ,",
    "the left panel of figure 1 predicts that the x - ray luminosity of sgr  a@xmath1  should be @xmath88few@xmath89 erg / s .",
    "this is about a factor of ten larger than actually observed @xcite .",
    "given many approximations and uncertainties that are used in our simple model , the disagreement is not surprising , especially since the fraction of radiation power coming out in x - rays is exceptionally low for sgr  a@xmath1  ( which is not taken into account in our model ) .",
    "figure 1 further shows that the population of 24,000 black holes would emit around @xmath90 erg / s in x - rays .",
    "most of this luminosity comes from a few to a dozen of x - ray sources with x - ray luminosities ranging between @xmath91 to @xmath92 erg / s .",
    "it thus seems possible that some of the _ unusual _ x - ray sources in the inner parsec detected by @xcite are the isolated accreting black holes or neutron stars masquerading themselves as x - ray binaries .",
    "such compact isolated accretors will probably have unusual time - variability properties as their discs may be much larger than the typical discs of x - ray binaries , and indeed they are missing the perturbing influence of the secondary .",
    "on the other hand , accretion disc feeding in these sources will be variable itself , leading to variability on variety of time scales .",
    "illumination of nearby gas clouds by x - rays may also lead to reprocessed infra - red , optical and uv emission .",
    "finally , the sources may leave trails of denser and likely hotter gas behind them as they plough through the gas .",
    "the right panel of figure 1 shows that the emission from the cusp of stellar mass remnants is bolometrically unimportant for a quasar accreting at a good fraction of its eddington limit .",
    "as already discussed , the result is not surprising , as the total mass of the stellar mass black hole cluster is @xmath93% of the smbh mass in this model .",
    "however , the spectrum of stellar mass black holes may be sufficiently different from that of the quasar that the former may still contribute to some wavelength range .",
    "in particular , the accretion disks of stellar mass black holes are systematically hotter than those of much more massive quasar black holes @xcite .",
    "the black hole cusp could then contribute to the soft x - ray band emission of quasars where quasar disks are not expected to radiate much energy ( except from a corona or a jet ) .",
    "low luminosity agn are the systems where the accreting stellar mass black holes may potentially complicate interpretation of the data , as the x - ray luminosities of these systems roughly range from @xmath94 erg / s to @xmath95 .",
    "further , unlike sgr  a@xmath1 , emission of these black holes is spatially unresolvable from that of the llagn .",
    "it is desirable to the broad band spectrum of the black hole cusp in the future work",
    ". this may be non trivial if some of the bright systems are in poorly understood super - eddington accretion rate regime , similar to the famous x - ray binary system ss443 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "a way to distinguish between the smbh and black hole cusp emission is via time - dependent observations .",
    "the emission from a relativistic region of a smbh might vary on time scales of hours to days , as observed in both sgr  a@xmath1@xcite , and in more distant agn ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the emission of a large number of statistically independent black holes and neutron stars should be considerably less variable .",
    "the presence of stellar mass black holes and neutron stars in a cusp around a smbh is a robust theoretical prediction ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the underlying physics  dynamical friction of these stellar remnants on a background stellar population ",
    "is very well understood .",
    "here we attempted to estimate the accretion rates with which these objects would be capturing gas from a massive accretion disc .",
    "we also estimated the x - ray luminosities of these objects .",
    "we found that the total luminosity of stellar mass remnant cusps might be comparable to or larger than the luminosity of the central smbh at low gas densities .",
