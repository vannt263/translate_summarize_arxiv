    "<S> , we conjecture that the energy transport in insulators with perfect crystalline order exhibits anomalous behavior . </S>",
    "<S> the effects of the lattice structure , random impurities , and the natural length in interactions are also examined . </S>",
    "<S> we find that fcc lattices display stronger divergence than simple cubic lattices . when impurity sites of infinitely large mass , which are thus fixed , are randomly distributed , such divergence vanishes . </S>"
