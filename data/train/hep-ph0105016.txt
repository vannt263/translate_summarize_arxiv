    "form factors are important physical quantities in the understanding of the internal structure of hadrons and relate to many other physical quantities . in this paper , we study two types of form factors for the pion : charge and transition ones . on the one hand ,",
    "the former appears in the calculation of elastic electron - pion scattering in which one off - shell photon exchanges between electron and one of the quarks in pion .",
    "this form factor is related to the electromagnetic radius of the charged pion .",
    "the latter , on the other hand , comes from the reactions where the pion is coupled to two photons .",
    "this form factor also interrelates to the decay rates and branching ratios of all the observed decay modes of neutral pion .",
    "it is well known that these form factors must be treated with non - perturbative method .",
    "there are many different candidates for this purpose , such as lattice calculations @xcite , vector meson dominance ( vmd ) @xcite , perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) with some non - perturbative input parameters @xcite , qcd sum rules @xcite , and the light - front quark model ( lfqm ) @xcite .",
    "lfqm is the only relativistic quark model in which a consistent and fully relativistic treatment of quark spins and the center - of - mass motion can be carried out .",
    "thus it has been applied in the past to calculate various form factors @xcite .",
    "this model has many advantages .",
    "for example , the light - front wave function is manifestly invariant under boost as it is expressed in terms of the momentum fraction variables ( in  + \" component ) in an analogy to the parton distributions in the infinite momentum frame .",
    "moreover , hadron spin can also be relativistically constructed by using the so - called melosh rotation .",
    "the kinematic subgroup of the light - front formalism has the maximum number of interaction - free generators including the boost operator which describes the center - of - mass motion of the bound state ( for a review of the light - front dynamics and light - front qcd , see @xcite ) . on the one hand",
    ", we will concentrate on the space - like region @xmath3 ( @xmath4 being the momentum transfer ) for charge form factors . in this region , the so - called z graph contribution @xcite vanishes and only the valence - quark contributes . as for the time - like region @xmath5 for charge form factor",
    ", it concerns with the nonvalence contribution ( z graph ) . a reliable way of estimating this part is still lacking . on the other hand , the space - like and time - like regions , which correspond to the scattering and decay processes , respectively , are both considered for transition form factors .",
    "we make a consistent treatment with lfqm for the decay constants , the charge form factors , and the transition form factors which include the z graph contribution within the time - like region .",
    "it must be emphasized that these derivations could be applied to all of the kinematically allowed region , no matter the momentum transfer is large or small .",
    "we compare these results with some experimental data on the charge form factors @xcite , transition form factors @xcite , and branching ratios of some decay modes @xcite for the pion .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , the basic theoretical formalism is given and the decay constant , the charge and transition form factors are derived for the pion . in sec .",
    "iii , we fix the parameters appearing in the wave functions and calculate the form factors and branching ratios .",
    "finally , a conclusion is given in sec .",
    "in this section , we first write down some relevant matrix elements in the covariant form . after integrating out the minus component of the internal monentum",
    ", we introduce the light - front quark model to formulate the decay constant , charge form factors and transition form factors .",
    "the decay constant of a pion is defined by 0|a^|(p)=i  f _",
    "p^,[decaydef ] where @xmath6 is the axial vector current . assuming a constant vertex function @xmath7 @xcite which is related to the @xmath8 bound state of the pion .",
    "then the quark - meson diagram , depicted in fig.1 ( a ) , yields 0||q_2 ^_5 q_1|(p)=- _ , [ decay1 ] where @xmath9 and @xmath10 is the number of colors . in terms of the lf",
    "coordinates @xmath11 , we obtain 0||q_2 ^_5 q_1|(p)&=&-_(4 p^)m^-1 .",
    "[ decay2 ] comparing ( [ decaydef ] ) with ( [ decay2 ] ) and performing the integration over the lf  energy \" @xmath12 in ( [ decay2 ] ) , we obtain f_&=&2 .",
    "[ decay4 ]      the charge form factor of the pion in the space - like region , as being illustrated in fig.1 ( b ) , is determined by the scattering of one virtual photon and one pion .",
    "this form factor can be defined by the matrix element (p)|j^|(p)= e  f^_(q^2 ) ( p+p)^ , [ fpdef ] where @xmath13 is the vector current , @xmath14 is the charge of quark @xmath4 in unit of @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and the superscript  s \" represents the space - like region . from fig.1 ( b ) , we obtain (p)||q e_q e ^q|(p)&=&-(e_u+e_|d ) e__ , [ charge1 ] using the lf coordinates and taking the trace , we obtain (p)||q e_q e ^q|(p)&=&-e__ \\{i^^-1 } , [ charge2 ] where i^&=&4 .",
    "let us extract @xmath17 from the  + \" component of the vector current @xmath18 .",
    "it does not loss the generality if @xmath19 is set to be zero for the momentum transfer in the space - like region . performing the @xmath12-integration",
    ", we obtain f^_(q^2)&=&-\\{(e_u+e_|d )   + & &  } , where |_q^+=0 ,  p_1 ^ -=m^2+p_1 ^ 2    by contrast , when we consider the process @xmath20 which is illustrated in fig .",
    "1(c ) , the momentum transfer @xmath21 is in the time - like region . in this region , the charge form factor is determined by another matrix element (p)(p)||q e ^q|0 & = & -(e_u+e_|d ) e__ .[timeme ] where @xmath22 .",
    "it is well known that @xmath23 in the lf coordinate , if we firstly assume @xcite the momentum transfer is purely longitudinal , i.e. , @xmath24 , @xmath25 will be ensured . the same results will be obtained if one carries out the integral and then takes @xmath24 . however , the former method will reduce the calculating processes considerably .",
    "thus this form factor is obtained as f^_(q^2)&=&-^p^+_0 dp_1^+_ ( q^m^2+(q - p_1)^2_-m^2+p_1 ^ 2_)^-1 + & &   + & -&^^q+_p^+dp_1^+ _ ( q^m^2+(q - p_1)^2_-m^2+p_1 ^ 2_)^-1 + & &  where the superscript  t \" represents the time - like region , = k^+|_p_1 ^ -=m^2+p_1 ^ 2 ,  = k^+|_(q - p_1)^-=m^2+(q - p_1)_^2 , and k^&=&4 .",
    "there are two types of transition form factors , @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the former comes from a neutral pion which coupled to two photons with one on - shell and the other off - shell , while the latter arises from the @xmath26 vertex , where @xmath27 represent an off - shell photons .",
    "these two form factors are related to many interesting experimental data . in this section",

    "the amplitude can be written as _ & = & -e_q e_|qe^2 _ + & & \\ { + & &  + } . the derivation of @xmath41 is almost the same as that in ( [ tran4],[trant3 ] ) .",
    "but there is one thing needed to be clarified : @xmath42 in ( [ tran4],[trant3 ] ) is the lf energy component of the on - shell photon , while it is the one corresponding to the off - shell photons in @xmath41 .",
    "this difference will become more clear in subsection d.      within the light - front formalism , a meson consisting of a quark @xmath43 and an antiquark @xmath44 with total momentum @xmath45 and spin @xmath46 can be written as @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the on - shell light - front momenta , @xmath50 and @xmath51 in terms of the light - front relative momentum variables @xmath52 defined by @xmath53 the momentum - space wave - function @xmath54 can be expressed as @xmath55 where @xmath56 describes the momentum distribution of the constituents in the bound state , and @xmath57 constructs a state of definite spin ( @xmath58 ) out of light - front helicity ( @xmath59 ) eigenstates .",
    "explicitly , @xmath60 where @xmath61 are the usual pauli spinors , and @xmath62 is the melosh transformation operator : @xmath63 with @xmath64 , a unit vector in the @xmath65-direction , and @xmath66 in practice it is more convenient to use the covariant form for @xmath57 @xcite : @xmath67 where @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 we normalize the meson state as @xmath71 so that @xmath72    after considering the normalization condition , the momentum distribution function @xmath73 , for the pion , is related to the bound state vertex function @xmath7 by @xcite _ ( x , k _ ) .",
    "[ laphi ] now , we can use the definitions of the light - front relative momentum variables @xmath52 ( [ pxk ] ) and the relation between the constant vertex function @xmath7 and the momentum distribution function @xmath73 ( [ laphi ] ) to rewrite the equations of those decay constants and form factors in the subsections a , b , and c. the results are the following . for the decay constant , f_=2_(x ,",

    "one can find that , for the two terms in eq .",
    "( [ emtime ] ) , there remains one bound state vertex function which can not be substitued with the momentum distribution function shown in ( [ laphi ] ) .",

    "we illustrate this situation in fig.1 ( d ) , the process @xmath76 is represented by the empty circle .",
    "another @xmath77 is not applicable for the empty circle because the light - front momentum of the quark is larger than that of the daughter pion ( i.e. @xmath78 ) .",

    "we can easily check that @xmath80 .",
    "we now compare our results for form factors with the experimental data . before doing this",
    ", we need to determine the parameters appearing in the wave function @xmath77 .",
    "of course , it is assumed that this wave function is universal and processes - independent .",
    "one wave function that has been often used in the literature for mesons is the gaussian - type , @xmath81 where @xmath82 and @xmath83 is of the internal momentum @xmath84 , defined through @xmath85 with @xmath86 .",
    "we then have m_0=e_1 + e_2 ,  k_z = xm_02-m_2 ^ 2+k_^2 2 xm_0 , [ kz ] and @xmath87 which is the jacobian of transformation from @xmath52 to @xmath88 .",
    "this wave function has been also used in many other studies of hadronic transitions .",
    "besides this wave function which has the exponential form , we also consider the power - law type one ( x , k_)_n = n(^2)^n .",
    "[ hwcw1 ] where @xmath89 is another parameter .    for the pion case ,",
    "we assume that the constituent mass of the @xmath90 and @xmath91 quarks is the same , i.e. , @xmath92 . thus , there are two parameters @xmath93 and @xmath94 in the gaussian - type wave function and an additional parameter @xmath89 in the power - law type one .",
    "we will use three conditions to fix these parameters .",
    "the first one is the experimental value of the decay constant @xmath95@xcite and ( [ fp ] ) .",
    "the second one is the electromagnetic radius of the charged pion r^2_-6f_(q^2)|_q^2=0 .",
    "where @xmath96 @xcite .",
    "the third one is the decay width @xmath97 @xcite .",

    "here we list the fitted parameters of these two wave functions @xmath101 and @xmath102 in table 1 .",
    "we show the @xmath103-dependent and @xmath104-dependent behaviors of these two types of wave functions in fig.2 and fig.3 , respectively .",
    "note that the location of maxima is quite different for @xmath101 and @xmath102 as shown in fig.2 and that the transverse momentum suppression of the exponential forms @xmath101 is more stronger than that of @xmath102 ( see fig.3 ) .",
    "the time - like region of the charge form factor was considered to be applied to the decay process @xmath105 , the calculation was not finished because that we do not have a reliable estimate of the pair - creation effect .",
    "contrary to the case of charge form factor , the time - like region of the transition form factors were studied completely .",
    "the major reason for this difference is that the pair - creation effect will exist when there are hadrons in the final state . concerning the model - dependent part ,",
    "although the choice of the light - front wave function is arbitrary , it is assumed to be processes - independent .",
    "therefore it is desirable if more data in the low - energy region , where the constituent quark model is more applicable , are fitted .",
    "this is the reason why we use the power - law type wave function .",
    "the major differences between the gaussian type and power - law one are , first , the locations of maxima is quite different for @xmath103 ; second , the transverse momentum suppression of the exponential function is stronger than that of the power - law ( @xmath106 ) function",
