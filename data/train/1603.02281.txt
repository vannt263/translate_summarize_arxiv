    "the era from the birth of the first stars to cosmic reionization is one of the key subjects in astronomy and astrophysics today . while the formation of the first stars is observationally out of reach at present ,",
    "the epoch of reionization is being explored with several different approaches .",
    "the latest measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) by the _ planck _ space mission suggest a reionization optical depth of @xmath8 , which implies that the midpoint of reionization occurred between @xmath9 and 8.8 @xcite .",

    "the main source of the ultraviolet ( uv ) photons that caused the reionization of the universe is still under debate .",
    "it has been argued that star - forming galaxies observed in deep surveys are not able to produce a sufficient number of photons to sustain reionization ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while the revised _",
    "planck _ results with later reionization than previously thought may alleviate this problem ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "if the assembly of an smbh is predominantly via gas accretion onto a seed black hole with mass @xmath13 , then the time needed to grow to the mass @xmath14 is @xmath15 where @xmath16 gyr is the eddington timescale , @xmath17 is the mean molecular weight per electron , @xmath18 is the radiative efficiency , and @xmath19 is the eddington ratio @xcite ; here we assume that @xmath19 is constant in time .",
    "we adopt @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 to derive the second line of the equation .",
    "for example , a seed with @xmath23 will take 0.7 gyr to form a quasar with @xmath24 . because this timescale is comparable to the cosmic time that elapsed between @xmath25 and @xmath26 , the smbh mass function at @xmath27 conveys critical information about the mass distribution of the seed black holes and the mode of subsequent growth , including super - eddington accretion @xcite .",

    "the former magnitude limit corresponds to @xmath63 mag for a typical quasar spectral energy distribution ( sed ) , thus allowing us to explore @xmath572 mag lower luminosity than any previous wide - field survey at @xmath12 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "our filter set is sensitive to quasars with redshifts up to @xmath64 ( i.e. , beyond the current quasar redshift record ) .",
    "however , the detection capability sharply drops at @xmath65 where the gp trough comes into the @xmath45-band , hence the survey is limited to intrinsically very luminous objects at those redshifts .",

    "this paper describes the results from the early hsc survey data taken before 2015 august .",
    "it covers roughly 80 deg@xmath2 in the five broad bands in the wide layer , with a median seeing of 0.6  0.8 .",
    "data reduction was performed with the dedicated pipeline hscpipe ( version 3.8.5 ; j. bosch et al .",
    "2016 , in preparation ) derived from the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ) software pipeline @xcite , for all the standard procedures including bias subtraction , flat fielding with dome flats , stacking , astrometric and photometric calibrations , and source detection and measurements .",
    "the astrometric and photometric calibrations are tied to the pan - starrs1 system @xcite .",
    "we utilize forced photometry , which allows for flux measurements in all the five bands with a consistent aperture defined in a reference band .",
    "the reference band is @xmath35 by default and is switched to @xmath1 ( @xmath45 ) for extremely red sources with no detection in the @xmath35 ( @xmath1 ) and bluer bands .",
    "we use the psf magnitude ( @xmath66 , or simply @xmath67 ) and the cmodel magnitude ( @xmath68 ) , which are measured by fitting the psf models and two - component , psf - convolved galaxy models to the source profile , respectively @xcite .",
    "we measure fluxes and colors of sources with @xmath66 , while the source extendedness is evaluated with @xmath69 .",
    "all the magnitudes are corrected for galactic extinction @xcite .",
    "we performed a rough assessment of the completeness limits achieved in the early wide survey as follows . in each subregion of the sky with an approximate size of 12@xmath53 12 , we select every source whose processing flags indicate clean photometry , and measure the number counts @xmath70 .",

    "these completeness magnitudes are roughly 0.3 mag fainter than the target limiting magnitudes of the survey mentioned above , which is at least partly because of the differences in the adopted magnitudes ( psf magnitudes vs. 2.0-aperture magnitudes ) and in the definitions of the depths ( 50% completeness vs. 5@xmath58 detection ) .",
    "our project also benefits from archival nir data from ukidss and viking .",

    "high-@xmath1 quasars are characterized by extremely red optical colors caused by strong igm absorption blueward of ly@xmath4 .",
    "this is demonstrated in figure [ fig : colordiagram ] , which presents @xmath80 and @xmath81 colors of model quasars and other populations in the hsc passband system .",
    "there are three major sources of astrophysical contamination to the photometric selection of quasars .",
    "the first is galactic brown dwarfs , which have been the most serious contaminants in past surveys because of their very red colors and point - like appearance .",
    "the second is red galaxies at @xmath82 , whose 4000   break leads to red @xmath80 colors , but we expect that the excellent image quality of the hsc will help identify those low-@xmath1 galaxies morphologically .",
    "the third is faint lyman - break galaxies ( lbgs ) at @xmath5 , which are also affected by igm absorption .",
    "figure [ fig : numbercounts ] displays the luminosity functions of high-@xmath1 quasars @xcite and lbgs @xcite . we assume the galaxy uv spectral slope of @xmath83 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to convert the uv magnitudes in the literature to @xmath84 .",
    "although the luminosity functions are still poorly constrained at @xmath85 mag for quasars and at @xmath86 mag for lbgs , it is likely that they intersect at an apparent magnitude of @xmath5724 mag , with lbgs outnumbering quasars at fainter magnitudes .",
    "this is why previous surveys at brighter magnitudes did not suffer from severe lbg contamination .",
    "the lbg contamination in our project could be significant , particularly if the lbg luminosity function has a double power - law form instead of the schechter function with its exponential cut - off at the bright end @xcite .",
    "there are several methods to extract quasar candidates from multiband imaging data .",
    "our sample of candidates is selected based on a bayesian probabilistic approach , as detailed in ",
    "[ subsec : mainsample ] .",
    "it computes the posterior probability for each source being a high-@xmath1 quasar rather than a red star or dwarf , based on photometry in all the available bands as well as sed and surface density models of the populations under consideration .",
    "we use photometry in the hsc optical bands plus the nir bands ( @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 ) where available from ukidss or viking .",
    "while ukidss is too shallow for all but the brightest hsc sources , the viking data are useful to identify and remove brown dwarfs , because the mean colors of l ",
    "t dwarfs ( @xmath87 mag ) match the relative depths of the hsc survey and viking .",
    "the entire flow of the candidate selection from the hsc - ssp database to the final spectroscopic targets is described in ",
    "[ subsec : flow ] .",
    "our selection procedure has efficiently removed contaminants , recovered all the known quasars imaged by the hsc so far (  [ subsec : recovery ] ) , and discovered a number of new objects as described in the following sections .",
    "our quasar candidates are selected with a bayesian probabilistic algorithm , developed following @xcite . here",
    "we assume that galaxies and relatively blue stars with o to early - m spectral types have been removed in advance with color and extendedness cuts ( see  [ subsec : flow ] ) .",
    "although this may not be the case for lbgs at @xmath88 , we do not model this population at present because ( i ) they are hard to distinguish from high-@xmath1 quasars by colors alone and ( ii ) their surface density at @xmath89 mag is still poorly understood ( see figures [ fig : colordiagram ] and [ fig : numbercounts ] ) .    for a detected source with the observed quantities @xmath90 , the bayesian probability @xmath91 of being a quasar is given by : @xmath92 and @xmath93 where the subscripts q and d denote a quasar and a brown dwarf , respectively .",
    "the vector @xmath90 represents the magnitudes in all the available bands in the present case , while @xmath94 represents the intrinsic source properties ( i.e. , luminosity and redshift for a quasar and luminosity and spectral type for a brown dwarf ) .",
    "the functions @xmath95 , @xmath96 , and @xmath97 represent the surface number density , the probability that the source is detected (  det \" ) , and the probability that the source has the observed quantities @xmath90 , respectively , each as a function of @xmath94 .",
    "we compute @xmath95 with the quasar luminosity function of @xcite and the galactic brown dwarf model of @xcite .",
    "the former is well determined at @xmath98 mag , while we extrapolate it to @xmath99 mag as shown in figure [ fig : numbercounts ] in order to match the hsc observations .",
    "the brown dwarf model takes into account the spatial density distributions and luminosities of late - m , l , and t dwarfs , and allows one to compute number counts for each spectral type at a given galactic coordinate . at our quasar selection limit of @xmath100 mag",
    "( see below ) , l ",
    "t dwarfs within @xmath571 kpc of the sun are bright enough to enter our sample .",
    "the validity of these quasar and brown dwarf models will be evaluated with the results of our and other surveys in future work .    since the hsc - ssp survey depth has not been fully analyzed yet (  2 ) , we arbitrarily set @xmath101 for @xmath102 or @xmath103 mag and 0 otherwise .",
    "the sed models required for @xmath97 are created as follows .",
    "the quasar model spectrum at @xmath104 is first created by stacking the sdss spectra of 340 bright quasars at @xmath105 , where the quasar selection is fairly complete @xcite , after correcting for the foreground igm absorption .",
    "the igm opacity data are taken from @xcite .",
    "this spectrum is then placed at various redshifts with the appropriate igm absorption taken into account , and convolved with the filter transmission functions to compute colors .",
    "because the model spectra redshifted to @xmath27 do not extend beyond the @xmath76-band , we take the @xmath106 and @xmath107 colors from @xcite .",
    "the dwarf colors are computed with a set of observed spectra compiled in the spex prism libraryadam / browndwarfs / spexprism . ] and in the cgs4 library.sleggett/ltdata.html . ] because of the discrete sampling of the brown - dwarf templates grouped into individual spectral types , the integration in equation [ eq : bayes2 ] is treated as a summation for spectral types .",
    "finally , the flux errors are taken from the outputs of the hsc image processing pipeline , and are assumed to follow a gaussian probability density distribution in fluxes .",
    "the present work is based on the hsc - ssp wide - layer data included in the s15a internal data release , which happened in 2015 september .",
    "forced photometry ( see  2 ) on the stacked images is used .",
    "we first query the hsc - ssp database for non - blended sources meeting the following criteria : @xmath108 or @xmath109 and without any critical quality flags assigned.- , @xmath1- , and @xmath45-bands . ] throughout this paper @xmath110 , @xmath111 , and @xmath112 refer to psf magnitudes .",

    "the color cuts are used to exclude relatively blue stars with o to early - m spectral types ( see figure [ fig : colordiagram ] ) , while the difference between the psf and cmodel magnitudes is used to exclude extended sources .",
    "after the database query , we further remove low-@xmath1 interlopers with more than @xmath113 detection in the @xmath55- or @xmath56-band .    because we are looking for rare faint objects detected in only one or two bands , we are sensitive to false dropout sources of both astrophysical and non - astrophysical origins . however , we can take advantage of the fact that in the hsc - ssp wide survey , each patch of the sky is visited and imaged several times with different dithering positions",
    ". glitches in the data may become apparent upon comparing the individual per - visit exposures .",
    "for every candidate , we retrieve and perform photometry on all the per - visit images with source extractor , version 2.8.6 @xcite , in the double - image mode , with the stacked image as the detection reference .",
    "if any of the per - visit photometric measurements deviate by more than three times the measurement error from the stacked photometry , the candidate is eliminated .",
    "this procedure is performed in the band in which the source photometry has the highest signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ; typically the @xmath1 -and for @xmath35 dropouts and the @xmath45-band for @xmath1 dropouts ) .",
    "we also reject candidates with profiles that are too compact , diffuse , or elliptical to be celestial point sources with the source extractor measurements on the stacked images .",
    "the eliminated sources are mostly cosmic rays , moving or transient sources , and image artifacts .",
    "the candidates selected above are matched to the ukidss and viking catalogs within 1.0 in the overlapping survey area .",
    "they are then processed through the bayesian probabilistic algorithm , and those with the quasar probability @xmath114 are added to the sample of candidates .",
    "the rather low value of the threshold @xmath115 was chosen to ensure that we would not throw away any possible candidates .",
    "we found that the actual @xmath91 distribution is bimodal , with only a small fraction falling in @xmath116 , so our results are insensitive to the exact value of this cut .",
    "finally , we inspect images of all the candidates by eye and reject additional problematic objects .",
    "hsc stacked and per - visit images are used for this purpose .",
    "the sources rejected at this stage include those close to very bright stars , cosmic rays , and moving objects overlooked in the above automatic procedure .    in the present survey area covering 80 deg@xmath2 , we had roughly 50,000 red and point - like sources meeting the database query conditions ( equations [ eq : query1 ] and [ eq : query2 ] ) and undetected in the @xmath55- and @xmath56-bands",
    "the vast majority of them ( @xmath5797 % ) were eliminated by checking the per - visit photometry and source morphology as described above . from @xmath572000",

    ", we further excluded candidates with bluer colors ( @xmath117 and @xmath118 ; see figure [ fig : colordiagram ] ) , fainter magnitudes ( @xmath119 24.3 mag ) , or with detection only in the @xmath1-band ; we obtained 38 final candidates after visual image inspection .",
    "we are also developing more classical methods of quasar color selection , such as simple color cuts and sed fitting with no bayesian prior , in order to understand completeness and any possible bias in the bayesian algorithm .",
    "a comparison of these selection techniques will be presented in a future paper .",
    "we found that the present sample of 38 candidates passed our current color cut and sed fitting selection criteria as well .",
    "figure [ fig : maghistogram ] presents the magnitude histogram of the sample selected above .",
    "we found 36 @xmath35-band dropouts interpreted as @xmath12 quasar candidates , and two @xmath1-band dropouts as @xmath33 quasar candidates .",
    "the magnitudes of the former objects range from @xmath120 mag to the limiting magnitude of our selection , @xmath100 mag , while the latter objects are fairly bright in the @xmath45-band , 21.7 and 22.6 mag .",
    "five high-@xmath1 quasars in the present survey area were identified prior to our project ; they are summarized in table [ tab : knownquasars ] .",
    "we found that they all successfully pass our selection criteria and end up in the final quasar candidates , as marked by the dark blue cells in figure [ fig : maghistogram ] .",
    "the bayesian quasar probability is @xmath121 in all cases .",
    "the figure implies that the success rate of our quasar selection is quite high at the brightest magnitudes ; for example , three of the four candidates at @xmath122 mag were indeed previously discovered high-@xmath1 quasars .",
    "the five known quasars include cfhqs j0216@xmath370455 with @xmath123 mag , which , as we discussed in  1 , was the faintest high-@xmath1 quasar known before this work .",

    "this problem would be alleviated if the bubble is ionized by a different source in front of j1205@xmath370000 , although the chance of having such a high-@xmath1 foreground source must be small . while the case for the redshift to be @xmath147 is most likely ,",

    "the continuum is very weak even at the wavelengths that are unaffected by igm absorption ( i.e. , redward of the ly@xmath4 line ) , and the observed broad - band flux in this spectral range is mostly contained in the above two lines .",
    "the spectrum is typical of a high-@xmath1 quasar .",
    "the redshift measured with the ly@xmath4 line is @xmath160 , but is quite uncertain , given the asymmetry in the line due to the onset of the ly@xmath4 forest .",

    "the high @xmath165 ( ly@xmath4 ) implies a contribution from agn , as a recent study of a large sample of ly@xmath4 emitters at @xmath166 @xcite suggests that the bright emitters with @xmath167 erg s@xmath50 almost always have a substantial agn contribution , based on their x - ray , uv , and radio properties .",

    "the agn contribution in this object may also be supported by the possible broad - line component seen redward of ly@xmath4 , as well as the relatively large @xmath168 ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "note that the intrinsic line fwhm may be as much as twice the value estimated here , due to the igm absorption .",

    "the interstellar absorption lines of @xmath1481260 , @xmath1481304 , and @xmath1481335 are also clearly visible , which indicate that they are lbgs at @xmath178 and @xmath179 , respectively .",
    "these three absorption lines may also be present in the spectra of j0219@xmath370416 , j0210@xmath370523 , j0210@xmath370559 , and j0848@xmath280045 , although the s / n is lower .",
    "combined with the relatively flat continua and the sharp flux drops in the bluer part of the spectra , they are also likely to be high-@xmath1 galaxies .",
    "their approximate redshifts were estimated from the absorption lines .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the redshift distribution of these galaxies ( @xmath180 ) is systematically different from that of the discovered quasars ( @xmath181 ) .",
    "this is partly because only intrinsically luminous objects can be detected at @xmath182 , where the gp trough comes into the @xmath1-band .",
    "in addition , galaxies are redder than quasars at @xmath183 due to weaker ly@xmath4 lines and redder continua , and so are more difficult to separate from the galactic brown dwarfs ( see figure [ fig : colordiagram ] ) .",
    "the evolution of the luminous end of the galaxy luminosity function around @xmath12 may also be a factor .",
    "another interpretation is that these sources are red galaxies at @xmath82 , whose 4000   break is responsible for their red @xmath80 colors ( see the discussion in  3 ) .",
    "however , we find this to be unlikely .",
    "even with high metallicity ( 2.5 @xmath184 ) and old stellar age ( 5 gyr ) , a large amount of dust reddening ( @xmath185 ) is required for a galaxy at @xmath82 to have @xmath186 @xcite .",
    "such high values of @xmath187 and @xmath188 are rarely found in samples of @xmath82 red galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while our objects have even redder colors ( @xmath189 ) .",
    "in addition , their spectra show absorption lines in most of the cases consistent with @xmath1481260 , @xmath1481304 , and @xmath1481335 at @xmath34 .",
    "the lack of lower-@xmath1 galaxies in our sample demonstrates the power of hsc , whose excellent image quality helps detect faint extended emission of such galaxies and separate them from high-@xmath1 objects morphologically .",
    "finally , j0850@xmath280012 has a relatively smooth red continuum characteristic of a brown dwarf .",
    "indeed this object has a rather low @xmath91 value ( @xmath190 ) and the bayesian algorithm predicts that it is most likely a l0 dwarf , which is consistent with the obtained spectrum .",
    "a follow - up study of this faint dwarf will be presented in a future paper .      in summary",
    ", we obtained spectra of 19 out of the 38 candidates , and identified 15 new high-@xmath1 quasars and galaxies .",
    "the above candidates also include 5 previously known quasars , which were recovered by our selection .",
    "the current status of the spectroscopic identifications is presented in figure [ fig : maghistogram ] .",
    "our selection is quite successful at magnitudes brighter than @xmath191 mag , where seven out of the nine candidates have turned out to be quasars and the remaining two are awaiting spectroscopy .",
    "this implies the following two points : first , the source detection and measurements with the hsc hardware and reduction software are highly reliable without serious systematic effects .",
    "second , our quasar selection algorithms work quite efficiently as long as they are fed with correct photometry information .",
    "interestingly , we have started to find high-@xmath1 galaxies as significant contaminants at @xmath192 mag .",
    "this is not surprising because the luminosity functions of quasars and lbgs are likely to intersect at @xmath5724 mag , with lbgs outnumbering quasars at fainter magnitudes ( see figure [ fig : numbercounts ] and the discussion in  3 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : extendedness ] presents the difference between the psf and cmodel magnitudes , as a measure of source extendedness , for all the identified objects in this work . because the host galaxy contribution is not always negligible for the low - luminosity quasars we are looking for , and the extendedness is a noisy quantity at the faintest magnitudes , no clear cut can be defined to separate quasars and galaxies on this plane .",
    "indeed , the three possible quasars with relatively narrow ly@xmath4 lines ( j2232@xmath280012 , j2228@xmath280128 , j1207@xmath370005 ; see figure [ fig : spectra1 ] ) appear to have larger extendedness than the remaining quasars , suggesting significant light from the host galaxies .    meanwhile , the discovered galaxies are an important probe of the reionization era . for example",
    ", stellar populations in such high-@xmath1 bright galaxies can be studied in detail with high - quality spectra .",
    "measurements of the interstellar absorption lines such as those observed in j0857@xmath280142 and j0215@xmath370555 have the potential to constrain the escape fraction of ionizing photons @xcite . follow - up observations with facilities at other wavelengths ( e.g. , the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ; alma ) , would also be useful to understand the nature of these galaxies in the high-@xmath1 universe .    at the faintest magnitudes of our survey ( @xmath193 mag ) ,",
    "the photometric selection and spectroscopic identification become more challenging . along with the increasing fraction of galaxies , we found a contaminating brown dwarf , which is expected from its low bayesian quasar probability ( @xmath91 = 0.17 ; see  [ subsec : contaminants ] ) .",
    "we were not able to confirm the nature of two candidates due to their low spectral s / n , although we typically spent a few hours per object with subaru .",
    "they seem to have no strong emission lines and so may be galaxies or brown dwarfs , but weak - line quasars such as j2236@xmath280032 are known to exist .",
    "further analysis of these objects , possibly with additional observing time to increase the s / n , will be presented in a future paper .    with the five previously known objects and the nine newly identified objects ( including the possible quasars j2232@xmath280012",
    ", j2228@xmath280128 , and j1207@xmath370005 ) , fourteen high-@xmath1 quasars are now known in the present survey area .",
    "this is roughly half of the expected number with our survey limit in 80 deg@xmath2 ( see  2 ) , although the spectroscopic identification is still not complete . in the last column of table [",
    "tab : properties ] , we report the absolute magnitudes of the discovered quasars as well as galaxies . for quasars",
    ", we measure the flux densities at the rest - frame wavelength @xmath194   ( except for j@xmath195 with the highest redshift , in which case we adopt @xmath196   and assume @xmath197 ) and estimate @xmath198 assuming the power - law continuum slope @xmath199 ( @xmath200 ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for galaxies , we measure @xmath201 at @xmath202   and convert them to @xmath84 by assuming the uv spectral slope of @xmath83 @xcite .",
    "as expected , our survey has succeeded in identifying quasars ( and galaxies ) with luminosities approaching @xmath203 mag ( i.e. , @xmath572 mag lower luminosity than found in most of the previous large surveys ; see  1 ) .",
    "we will continue to develop the shellqs project as the hsc - ssp survey continues .",
    "the present work only partially covers the first 80 deg@xmath2 of the wide layer , which will eventually observe 1400 deg@xmath2 .",
    "our immediate goal is to complete the spectroscopic identification in this 80 deg@xmath2 area and derive our first quasar luminosity function . in the long term",
    ", we will expand the survey area and significantly increase the sample size and luminosity range of known high-@xmath1 quasars .",
    "as described in  1 , the expected numbers of quasars over the whole wide area are @xmath57500 with @xmath61 mag at @xmath12 and @xmath57100 with @xmath62 mag at @xmath33 .",
    "we will also explore even lower luminosities with the deep and ultra - deep layers of the hsc - ssp survey , although follow - up spectroscopy will become more challenging .    at the same time",
    ", it is important to follow up individual quasars in greater detail .",
    "the redshifts of some of the discovered quasars are poorly constrained at the moment , which should be improved .",
    "we are also planning deep optical and nir spectroscopy to measure the near - zone size , smbh mass , and metallicity for those quasars at lower luminosity than previously known at @xmath27 .",
    "these low - luminosity objects are expected to be much more numerous than the brighter ones , and hence possess critical information about the general properties of quasars in the early universe .",
    "they will also provide a useful constraint on the low - mass end of the smbh mass function , and in turn , models of the formation and early evolution of smbhs .",
    "in addition , x - ray observations will play a critical role to estimate the bolometric luminosity , the eddington ratio , and the presence and properties of absorbing material .",
    "we also plan to conduct alma follow - up observations in order to study the gas and dust content , as well as the star formation activity in the host galaxies .",
    "we present initial results from the shellqs project , a survey of low - luminosity quasars and agns at high redshift close to the reionization era .",
    "the project exploits the exquisite imaging data with five optical bands ( @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath35 , @xmath1 , and @xmath45 ) produced by the subaru hsc - ssp survey , supplemented with nir photometry where available from ukidss and viking .",
    "the limiting magnitudes of the quasar search are currently set to @xmath61 mag and @xmath62 mag , but these may change in the future .",
    "the candidates are selected by combining several photometric approaches , including a bayesian probabilistic algorithm , which have turned out to be quite efficient in eliminating astrophysical contaminants such as stars and dwarfs , as well as cosmic rays , moving objects , and transient events . from the early hsc - ssp survey area covering 80 deg@xmath2",
    ", we identified 38 candidate high-@xmath1 quasars , which are the focus of this paper .",
    "we carried out spectroscopic follow - up observations of 19 of these candidates , with gtc / osiris and subaru / focas , in the 2015 fall and 2016 spring semesters .",
    "nine objects were identified as quasars or possible quasars at @xmath181 , based on the sharp continuum breaks characteristic of gp troughs , broad ly@xmath4 and @xmath1481240 lines , and/or blue continuum .",
    "six objects are likely high-@xmath1 galaxies with interstellar absorption lines of @xmath1481260 , @xmath1481304 , and @xmath1481335 , and in some cases narrow ly@xmath4 emission lines .",
    "the remaining objects include a l0 dwarf , a moving or transient object , and two sources whose nature is still uncertain due to the low spectral s / n . in addition to these newly identified objects , five quasars were known prior to our survey among the 38 candidates .",
    "the success rate of our selection is quite high , and most of the objects we took spectra of were identified as high-@xmath1 quasars or galaxies .",
    "the shellqs project will continue as the hsc - ssp survey continues toward its goals of observing 1400 deg@xmath2 in the wide layer , as well as 27 and 3.5 deg@xmath2 in the deep and ultra - deep layer , respectively .",
    "we will soon deliver our first quasar luminosity function reaching down to @xmath204 mag at @xmath12 .",
    "further follow - up observations of the discovered quasars and galaxies are being considered at various wavelengths from sub - millimeter / radio to x - ray .",
    "we thank the referee for his / her useful comments and suggestions to improve this paper .",
    "we are grateful to everyone involved in the hardware development , observations , and data reduction for the hsc - ssp survey .",
    "we had a lot of great help from chien - hsiu lee , takashi hattori , and other subaru staff members for the focas observations .",
