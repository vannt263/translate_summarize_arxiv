    "with the recent advent of the experimental fabrication of a single layer of graphene , the electronic and transport properties of this newly discovered material have been intensively studied both experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite .",
    "whereas electronic structure experiments have revealed detailed subtle many - body effects on the graphene energy spectrum , transport experiments have also revealed some apparently unusual features of graphene transport properties , most noticably , that the conductivity has a non - zero minimum value around zero bias gate voltage . up to now",
    ", the transport experiments performed have been focused only on the longitudinal and hall transport properties ( in both weak and strong magnetic fields , including the quantum hall regime ) and weak localization , where all of these phenomena depend essentially only on the physics of scattering of individual single quasiparticle from impurities with electron - electron many - body interaction effect playing the role of a small quantitative correction . in two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg )",
    "semiconductor bilayer structures ( e.g. modulation - doped gaas / al@xmath7ga@xmath8as double quantum wells ) , electron - electron scattering between the 2deg layers give rise to the effect of coulomb drag where a ` drag ' current is induced purely from the momentum exchanges through interlayer electron - electron scattering events .",
    "one measures the effect of coulomb drag by the drag resistivity @xmath0 , which is defined by the induced drag electric field in the open - circuited passive layer per unit applied current density in the active layer . in high - mobility samples where the disorder is weak , @xmath0 goes as @xmath1 at low temperatures @xmath2 , and as @xmath3 for large bilayer separation @xmath4 ( refs .  ) .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the coulomb drag in graphene `` bilayer '' systems with no interlayer tunneling , considering both the intrinsic ( chemical potential @xmath9 ) and extrinsic ( @xmath10 ) cases .",
    "we emphasize right in the beginning so that there is no semantic confusion what we mean by the terminology ` bilayer ' graphene .",
    "our ` bilayer ' graphene is two isolated parallel 2d graphene monolayers separated by a distance @xmath4 , with _ no _ interlayer tunneling .",
    "the electronic structure of each graphene monolayer is thus unaffected by having the other layer .",
    "each graphene layer is assumed to have its own variable carrier density in the extrinsic case .",
    "our system is thus different from the ordinary bilayer graphene where @xmath11 with strong interlayer tunneling . throughout this paper",
    ", we shall also use the terms `` undoped '' and `` doped '' interchangeably with `` intrinsic '' and `` extrinsic '' respectively ; keeping in mind that in experiments the chemical potential can be changed by both chemical doping and gating with an applied voltage . the coulomb drag in graphene",
    "is interesting not only because it is a novel material with a linear energy spectrum , but also because it only spans a thickness of a single carbon atom , the electrons are much more confined along the perpendicular direction comparing with 2deg in a quantum well , where the finite width thickness has to be taken into account in any quantitative comparison with experiments .",
    "thus , the coulomb drag phenomenon in graphene is expected to be theoretically very well accounted for with two zero - thickness graphene sheets .",
    "in addition , tunneling is only appreciable when the the out - of - plane @xmath12 orbitals from the two graphene sheets start to overlap with each other at an interlayer distance @xmath4 of a few angstroms ( @xmath13 in naturally occuring graphite ) , making it possible to study the effect of coulomb drag for an interlayer separation @xmath4 down to a few tens of angstroms , about an order of magnitude smaller than is possible in the usual double quantum well systems without appreciable tunneling .",
    "graphene has a real - space honeycomb lattice structure with two interpenetrating sublattices , giving a honeycomb reciprocal space structure with the brillouin zone forming a hexagon . at each of these corners where the high symmetry point is denoted as k or k , the energy dispersion is linear and the effective low - energy hamiltonian at the vicinity of these k and k points is given by @xmath14 .",

    "for the case where the graphene layers are undoped @xmath9 , we first state the main result : the drag conductivity between two intrinsic graphene layers , or between one extrinsic and one intrinsic graphene layers , is identically zero .",
    "this is not at first sight a trivial consequence of zero doping if one recalls there is a finite conductivity ( so - called the `` minimum conductivity '' ) at zero doping in graphene . a physical explanation and a general argument for the reason why this is so is in order",
    ". when the fermi level is at the dirac point , the only process for electron - hole pair creation will be interband electron excitation from the valence band to the conduction band by which equal numbers of electrons and holes are created . in the mechanism of coulomb drag",
    ", the applied electric field drives the electrons ( or holes ) in the active layer in the , say , positive ( negative ) direction ; through coulomb scattering , momentum is transferred to the passive layer , which drives the carriers ( regardless of whether these are electrons or holes ) in the same direction as the momentum transfer . in doped systems where there is only one type of carrier ( either electron or hole ) , this gives a finite drag current in the passive layer .",
    "now , in undoped systems where a perfect electron - hole symmetry exists , there are two cases for consideration : ( 1 ) if the active layer is undoped , equal numbers of electrons and holes in the active layer will be driven in the opposite direction by the applied electric field , and the net momentum transfer is thus zero .",
    "there will be no drag regardless of what the passive layer is .",

    "before we proceed to discuss our numerical results , it is instructive to obtain an analytical formula for the drag resistivity under certain approximations . to this end , we first define the standard dimensionless parameter for the excitation energy @xmath93 in the fermi liquid theory , which is the ratio of the phase velocity of the excitation @xmath94 to the quasiparticle velocity @xmath95 . at low temperatures and with large interlayer separation , the dominant contribution to the drag conductivity eq .",

    "there are two types of disorder in substrate - mounted graphene , one being the charged impurities coming from the substrate ; and the other being the neutral impurities intrinsic to the graphene layer itself . in theory , the type of disorder essentially boils down to the expression of the transport time @xmath52 in @xmath111 , which yield different types of functional dependence of the conductivity @xmath111 on the carrier density . in experiments ,",
    "the conductivity is observed to increase linearly with density , a fact alluding to the dominance of the charged impuritity scattering in substrate - mounted graphene samples .",

    "in conclusion , we have formulated the coulomb drag problem for graphene bilayers .",
    "the drag resistivity is zero for intrinsic graphene . for extrinsic graphene",
    ", the interband contribution to the drag due to electron - hole excitations is suppressed at low temperatures , and the coulomb drag is due predominantly to the intraband contribution near the fermi surface in the conduction band . we have obtained exact analytical results at @xmath160 for both intraband and interband contributions to the nonlinear susceptibility , and obtained the drag resistivity numerically .",
    "we have also derived an approximate analytical result for the drag resistivity valid for low temperatures , high density and/or large interlayer separation .",
    "we find both similarities and differences for the graphene drag resistivity compared with that for regular 2deg with quadratic energy spectrum . at low temperatures ,",
    "graphene drag resistivity exhibits the same temperature , bilayer distance and density dependences as regular 2d systems . for low densities @xmath165 , the low temperature regime where the @xmath1 dependence of the drag resisitivity holds extends by an order of magnitude that for regular 2d systems , as the fermi temperature is higher for the same carrier density in graphene than in regular 2d systems .",
    "in contrast to regular 2d bilayer systems , there is no contribution to plasmon - induced enhancement of the drag resistivity due to intraband excitations , and the only contribution to plasmon - induced enhancement comes from interband excitations , which occur at temperatures @xmath166 .",
    "the coupled plasmon modes in graphene bilayer systems can therefore be probed experimentally with drag resistivity measurements at high enough temperatures or at low densities .    finally , we comment on the possible effect of disorder which has been argued @xcite to be important for substrate - mounted graphene monolayers in the low carrier density regime . in particular ,",
    "the low - density graphene monolayers will be dominated @xcite by spatial inhomogeneities associated with electron - hole puddles induced by the charged impurities in the substrate . in the presence of such density inhomogeneity ,",
    "the coulomb drag in the low - density regime may deviate substantially from our theory based on the spatially uniform carrier density ( in each layer ) model .",
    "in particular , there could be large drag fluctuations including even negative drag in this low - density regime .",
