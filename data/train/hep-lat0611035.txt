    ", perturbative methods do not apply , and the only first principles method to investigate these transitions is by means of lattice monte carlo ( mc ) simulation . however , lattice mc simulation is based on importance sampling , which can not be directly applied to the nonzero baryon density case because of the complex fermion determinant@xcite for su(3 ) gauge theory .",
    "enormous efforts have been made to solve this complex action problem .",
    "fodor and katz used a two - dimensional generalization of the glasgow reweighting method@xcite to study the phase diagram of lattice qcd with kogut - susskind ( ks ) fermions@xcite ; allton _ et al._@xcite attempted to improve this method by taylor expansion of the fermionic determinant and observables around @xmath9 .",

    "it is computationally simple and allows control over the systematic error by fitting the nonperturbative data to a taylor series .",
    "furthermore , it is a good testing ground for effective qcd models : analytic results can always be continued to imaginary @xmath6 and be compared with the numerics there .",
