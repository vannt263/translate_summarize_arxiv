    "entanglement is a fundamental property of quantum mechanical states with no counterpart in classical systems .",
    "a widely used measure of entanglement is the von neumann or entanglement entropy defined as @xmath1 from the reduced density matrix @xmath2 of a subsystem @xmath3 , that measures the entanglement of the degrees of freedom in @xmath3 with those in the rest of the system .",
    "this concept has found numerous applications in quantum field theory , black hole thermodynamics , and condensed matter physics . in particular , entanglement entropy exhibits signatures of quantum phase transitions in condensed matter systems @xcite .    despite its wide range of applications , entanglement ( or other types of )",
    "entropy is generally hard to compute even in the simplest models .",
    "there is still an area of active research aiming to compute various entropies for free lattice models and field theories @xcite .",
    "finding entanglement entropy in certain _ critical _ models is facilitated by exploiting the techniques of conformal field theory ( cft ) @xcite , but these applications are often limited to 1 + 1 dimensions .",
    "part of the challenge lies in the fact that entanglement entropy is defined with respect to a part of a larger system , or a domain in space , and thus depends on its various geometrical properties .",
    "this is further complicated if one needs to compute mutual ( tripartite , etc . )",
    "information between two ( three , etc . ) regions , @xmath4 for example , the entanglement entropy of a single interval in a 1 + 1 dimensional cft finds a simple logarithmic dependence on the interval s size with a coefficient that only depends on the central charge of the cft @xcite .",
    "but the mutual information between two disjoint intervals is shown to encode all the information content of the cft @xcite .",
    "powerful geometric representations for entanglement entropy exist in holographic theories , at the expense of a mapping to gravitational models , but nevertheless are limited to cfts or their massive perturbations @xcite .",
    "it is worthwhile to find alternative , simpler geometrical representations that go beyond such limitations .",
    "furthermore , one generally expects that quantum field theories in @xmath5 dimensions can be mapped to classical ones in @xmath6 dimensions .",
    "it is then natural to ask what is the equivalent of entanglement or other types of entropy in one higher dimension .",
    "we shall briefly review the standard methods that make use of functional integrals in the @xmath6-dimensional euclidean space to compute such entropies .",
    "but we show that at least in certain cases the mapping to one higher dimension finds a connection with _",
    "classical entropic effects_.    in this work , we consider rnyi entropy defined as @xmath7 which , for integer @xmath8 , is a simpler alternative to von neumann entropy , and produces the latter in the limit @xmath9 .",
    "we exclusively focus on the rnyi entropy of the order @xmath0 , explicitly defined as @xmath10 and study the vacuum / thermal state of a free scalar field theory , but also discuss to what extent our results extend beyond free field theories .",
    "it is shown that the rnyi entropy @xmath11 of a spatial domain @xmath3 can be mapped to the change of the thermodynamic free energy by introducing the @xmath5-dimensional ` surface ' @xmath3 in @xmath6 dimensions , where @xmath3 imposes conventional boundary conditions for a scalar field theory , namely dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions .",

    "specifically , we compute @xmath13 between two disjoint disk - shaped regions at arbitrary separations , between two parallel half - spaces , and between a half - space and an arbitrary , but small , region .",
    "we also exploit an equivalent formulation of the free energy in terms of closed loops ( phantom polymers ) to show that the rnyi information @xmath13 in @xmath5 dimensions can be understood from entropic effects ( associated with polymer configurations ) in @xmath6 dimensions .",
    "this will allow us to easily examine inequalities such as strong subadditivity property .",

    "@xcite , we first give a brief review of the latter , and compare it with our main results here .",
    "in the above reference , a model of a scalar field theory coupled to ` matter ' degrees of freedom ( mimicking the electromagnetic field in vacuum coupled to a dielectric material ) in @xmath5 dimensions was considered , and the entanglement between field and matter was studied .",
    "it was shown that the mutual information between two material bodies  upon integrating out the scalar field  can be computed from the classical free energy in @xmath6 dimensions where only the scalar field lives in the higher - dimensional space , and is subject to certain ( robin ) boundary conditions on @xmath5-dimensional surfaces of the same shape as the material bodies .",
    "expressing the fluctuating field as a sum over worldlines , or phantom polymers , it was shown that the mutual information finds a geometrical interpretation as a weighted sum over those polymers which intersect the two planar regions in @xmath6 dimensions . in the present work ,",
    "we do not consider any matter degrees of freedom , but only a scalar field in vacuum , and study the quantum information shared between two _ domains _ in space .",
    "for the rnyi information of the order @xmath0 , we find a similar mapping to the free energy in one higher dimension where the @xmath5-dimensional domains impose different ( dirichlet and neumann ) boundary conditions .",
    "again we find a representation in terms of polymers which are weighted differently than those for the coupled field - matter model of ref .",
    "we remark that the mapping to one higher dimension is expected from the quantum - to - classical mapping @xcite , however , the formulation of the rnyi entropy and information as a boundary - value problem subject to the known boundary conditions for the scalar field and the representation of information in terms of a weighted sum over polymers are novel aspects of this work , and allow us to derive a number of quantitative and qualitative results beyond those in the existing literature .",
