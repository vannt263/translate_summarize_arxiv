    "the proof of theorem  [ mainthm ] is based on a combinatorial model that is developed in section  [ sec2 ] . as a consequence , it is sufficient to enumerate a particular graphical object that we call a",
    "_ paired array_. we then give two combinatorial reductions , in sections  [ sec3 ] and  [ sec4 ] , in terms of a simpler class of paired arrays called _ vertical _ paired arrays .",
    "these are explicitly enumerated in section  [ sec5 ] , which allows us to complete the proof of theorem  [ mainthm ] .",
    "one of the combinatorial conditions on paired arrays is that two graphs associated with them must be acyclic .",
    "because of this , a key component of sections  [ sec4 ] and  [ sec5 ] is the enumeration of rooted forests which contain a given forest as a subgraph .",
    "thus in section  [ sec35 ] we give a new bijection for this fundamental combinatorial problem .",
    "however , before we turn to our combinatorial model and subsequent reductions , we consider some consequences of theorem  [ mainthm ] , and give some comparisons to results in the existing literature .    a major reason that harer and zagier s result ( theorem  [ hzthm ] ) is important ( as evidenced by",
    "so many published proofs ) is that it can be restated as an equivalent geometric problem in terms of maps .",
    "map _ is an embedding of a connected graph ( with loops and multiple edges allowed ) in an orientable surface , partitioning the surface into disjoint regions ( called the _ faces _ of the map ) that are homeomorphic to discs ( this is called a two - cell embedding ) .",
    "a _ rooted _ map is a map with a distinguished edge and incident vertex ( so , the map is `` rooted '' at that end of the distinguished edge ) .",
    "the well - known embedding theorem allows us to consider this as equivalent to a pair of permutations and their product ( see , e.g. , tutte  [ [ t ] ] , where the terminology `` rotation system '' is used to describe this triple of permutations ) . from this point of view , the @xmath20th coefficient @xmath18 in the generating series @xmath49 evaluated in theorem  [ hzthm ] is equal to the number of rooted maps with @xmath50 vertex , @xmath3 edges and @xmath20 faces ( where @xmath23 , as in theorem  [ hzthm ] ) . denoting the genus of the surface in which such a map is embedded by @xmath51",
    ", then the euler - poincar theorem implies that @xmath52 , or that @xmath53 .    similarly , theorem  [ mainthm ] has a geometric interpretation .",
    "let @xmath54 be the conjugacy class of @xmath55 in which there are two disjoint cycles , of lengths @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "then the coefficient @xmath35 in the generating series @xmath39 is equal to @xmath56 times the number of rooted maps with @xmath2 vertices ( of degrees @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) , @xmath3 edges ( exactly @xmath57 of which join the two vertices together , plus @xmath58 that are loops at the vertex of degree @xmath6 , plus @xmath59 that are loops at the vertex of degree @xmath7 ) , and @xmath20 faces ( where @xmath42 , as in theorem  [ mainthm ] ) . in this case , if we denote the genus of the surface in which such a map is embedded by @xmath51 , then we obtain @xmath60 .    of course , since genus is a nonnegative integer , we must have @xmath61 , and indeed the coefficient of @xmath62 in the summation for @xmath39 given in theorem  [ mainthm ] is zero , since the summand corresponding to @xmath63 ( which has @xmath64 as a factor ) is itself equal to zero . for the planar case , which corresponds to @xmath65 , the only nonzero summand that contributes to the coefficient of @xmath66 in the summation of theorem  [ mainthm ] corresponds to @xmath67 , and this gives immediately that @xmath68 this checks with the straightforward computation that one can make to determine this value by elementary means  there are @xmath57 edges between the two vertices ; between the ends of these edges at each vertex is an even number of vertices , joined by loops without crossings ( and there is catalan number of such arrangements for each such even interval ) .",
    "this explains the term `` genus '' in the title ; the term `` annular '' is adapted from its usage in mingo and nica  [ [ mn ] ] .",
    "it refers to an equivalent embedding for a map with two vertices , in an annulus .",
    "the ends of the edges incident with one of the vertices ( say the one of degree @xmath6 ) are identified with @xmath6 points arranged around the disc on the exterior of the annulus , and the ends incident with the other vertex are identified with @xmath7 points arranged around the disc on the interior of the annulus .",
    "the points corresponding to the two ends of an edge are joined by an arc in the interior of the annulus .",
    "we have been able to find one relevant enumerative result ( jackson  [ [ j ] ] ) in the literature about such maps , in which the total number of edges is specified , but not the exact number joining the two vertices together . to compare this result to our main result",
    ", we must sum over @xmath69 ( since the underlying graph must be connected , then @xmath57 , the number of edges joining the two vertices together , must be positive ) , and thus define @xmath70 then jackson  [ [ j ] ] has considered the case @xmath71 , and obtained the following result , restated in terms of our notation ( by applying the proportionality constant @xmath72 ) .

[ gsint ] for @xmath76 , with @xmath30 even , and @xmath42 , @xmath77    we have checked computationally , with the help of maple , that theorems  [ jint ] and  [ gsint ] agree with theorem  [ mainthm ] , summed over @xmath69 , for a wide range of values of @xmath4 .",
    "however , we have been unable to prove this for all @xmath4 , since we have not been able to show that the sum over @xmath69 of the result of theorem  [ mainthm ] is equal to the result of theorem  [ gsint ] .",
    "note that the summation in theorem  [ gsint ] can be made symmetrical in @xmath4 ( so the ordering @xmath78 is not required ) by changing the summation variable @xmath20 to @xmath79 .",
    "the method employed in jackson  [ [ j ] ] for theorem  [ jint ] , and in many of the papers listed above that give proofs of theorem  [ hzthm ] , is matrix integration .",
    "however , we do not see how to adapt the matrix integration methodology to prove our main result , theorem  [ mainthm ] , since it does nt seem possible to specify that there are exactly @xmath57 edges joining the two vertices together in the matrix method .",
    "the simplicity of our result seems to suggest that an extended theory of matrix integration to allow a specified number of edges between particular vertices might be possible , and worth investigating .",
    "the simplicity of the result also suggests that there should be a more direct combinatorial proof than the one presented in this paper .",
    "the combinatorial model for our proof of theorem  [ mainthm ] is based on a _ paired surjection _ , which has the following definition .",
    "[ shiftsydef ] for @xmath80 , with @xmath41 of the same odd - even parity , let @xmath81 be the set of ordered pairs @xmath82 , where @xmath83 has @xmath57 mixed pairs , and @xmath84 is a surjection from @xmath8\\cup[q]'$ ] onto @xmath85 $ ] , satisfying the condition @xmath86\\cup[q]'.\\ ] ] such an ordered pair @xmath82 is called a _",

    "indeed , the proof of the following result is identical to the proof of proposition  1.3 in goulden and nica  [ [ gn ] ] , and is hence omitted .

    "now , if @xmath106 , then ( interpreting @xmath50 as @xmath111 ) condition  ( [ muphicond ] ) means that @xmath112 , so we have @xmath113 .",
    "this implies that the functional digraph of @xmath114 ( the directed graph on vertex - set @xmath115 with an arc directed from @xmath116 to @xmath117 for each @xmath118 ) is actually a tree , in which all arcs are directed towards vertex @xmath119 ( which we consider as the root of this tree ) .",
    "we denote this rooted tree by @xmath120 .",
    "similarly , the functional digraph of @xmath121 , on vertex - set @xmath122 , is also a tree , with all arcs directed towards vertex @xmath123 ( which we consider as the root of this tree ) .",
    "we denote this rooted tree by @xmath124 .",
    "one condition that the paired surjection @xmath92 satisfies is that the number of mixed pairs containing an element of @xmath125 is equal to the number of mixed pairs containing an element of @xmath126 for all @xmath127 $ ] .",
    "( for the reason that this necessary condition arises , see the discussion of `` unique label recovery '' in the next section . )",
    "we call this the _ balance _ condition for @xmath92 .",
    "the fact that @xmath84 is a surjection is equivalent to @xmath128 , for @xmath127 $ ] , and we call this the _ nonempty _ condition for @xmath92 .",
    "the fact , established above , that the graphs of @xmath114 and @xmath121 are trees is called the _ tree _ condition for @xmath92 .",
    "now we consider a graphical representation for the paired surjection @xmath92 , called its _ labelled paired array_. this is an array of cells , arranged in @xmath20 columns , indexed @xmath129 from left to right , and two rows . in column @xmath116 of row @xmath50 ,",
    "place an ordered list of @xmath130 vertices , labelled by the elements of @xmath125 from left to right ; in column @xmath116 of row @xmath2 , place an ordered list of @xmath131 vertices , labelled by the elements of @xmath126 from left to right . for each pair of @xmath132",
    "draw an edge between the vertices whose labels are given by the pair .",
    "for example , when @xmath133 , consider @xmath134 , given by @xmath135 @xmath136 @xmath137 , and @xmath138 , @xmath139 , @xmath140 @xmath141 , @xmath142 .",
    "the corresponding labelled paired array is given in figure  [ labarr ] , and the trees @xmath120 and @xmath124 are given in figure  [ trees ] .",
    "now suppose that we mark the cells in column @xmath119 of row @xmath50 and in column @xmath123 of row @xmath2 ( by placing a small box in the top righthand corner of the marked cell in row 1 , and in the bottom righthand corner of the marked cell in row 2 ) , and remove the labels from all vertices  call the resulting object the _ paired array _ of @xmath92 .",
    "the ordered list of vertices in each cell is now to be interpreted as a generic totally ordered set , with the given left to right order , and the pairing @xmath132 now acts on these ordered sets in the obvious way .",
    "for example , the paired array determined from the labelled paired array displayed in figure  [ labarr ] is given in figure  [ arr ] .",
    "what information have we lost when the labels are removed ?",
    "the answer , perhaps surprisingly , is that no information is lost , since we have _ unique label recovery _ by applying condition  ( [ muphicond ] ) iteratively , as follows : for the first row , place label @xmath50 on the leftmost vertex in the marked cell of row @xmath50 ; for each @xmath116 from @xmath2 to @xmath6 , place label @xmath116 on the leftmost unlabelled vertex in column @xmath143 of row @xmath50 .",
    "the same process applied to the second row will place labels @xmath103 to @xmath144 on the vertices in row @xmath2 .",
    "( the reader can apply this to the paired array in figure  [ arr ] , to check that indeed the labelled paired array in figure  [ labarr ] is recovered in this way . )",
    "the proof that this process always works for a paired array satisfying the balance , nonempty and tree conditions ( and the proof that these conditions are necessary for this process to work ) requires only a slight modification of the results in section 3 of  [ [ gn ] ] , and is not given here ( note that neither the functions @xmath114 and @xmath121 , nor the trees @xmath120 and @xmath124 , depend on the labels of the vertices , and the number of mixed pairs incident with the vertices in each cell of the paired array also does not depend on the labels , so the balance , nonempty and tree conditions can be checked on the paired array alone ) .",
    "this motivates us to define a _ paired array _ in the abstract ( and not as obtained by removing the labels from a labelled paired array ) , and in fact to extend it to a more general class of objects , in the following definition .",
