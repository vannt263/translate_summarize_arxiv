    "since the discovery of gravitational arcs in clusters of galaxies by linds & petrosian ( 1986 ) and subsequently by soucail _ et al . _ ( 1987 ) , the observation and study of arcs has developed considerably , and is now becoming an essential tool in astrophysics .",
    "arcs provides a wealth of information about the mass distribution in clusters of galaxies ( see for instance : comerford _ et al .",
    "2006 _ , & broadhurst _ el al . 2006 _ ) . however , the mass distribution of the astrophysical lenses is complex and involves a large parameter space which is difficult to explore .",
    "thus , the derivation of a simplified perturbative theory that is able to re - produce the general features of gravitational arcs is an interesting tool to help understanding complex gravitational lenses .",
    "let s assume that the projected density of the lens @xmath1 is circularly symmetric and centered at the origin .",
    "let s also assume that the lens is dense enough to reach critical density at a given radius @xmath2 . under such hypothesis , the image by the lens of a point source placed at the origin will be a perfect ring .",
    "we are now interested in small perturbations of this perfect ring .",
    "there are two type of perturbations to the point source perfectly aligned in a circularly symmetric potential : first the source may not be perfectly at the center , and second the potential may not be perfectly circular .",
    "let s be more specific , in polar coordinates , the lens equation writes : @xmath3 in the unperturbed case , the equation reads : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a function of @xmath6 only .",
    "let s now perturb this equation by introducing a small displacement of the source from the origin : @xmath7 , and a non - circular perturbation to the potential , @xmath8 .",
    "note that the perturbation on @xmath9 and the perturbation on @xmath10 are assumed to be of the same order .",
    "the perturbation may be described by the following formula : @xmath11 here @xmath12 is a small number : @xmath13 .",
    "given a position @xmath14 for the source , the image positions @xmath15 , can be obtained by solving equation ( [ eq_1 ] ) . however solving",
    "directly may prove impossible in the general case .",

    ", the perturbation will introduce a deviation from the perfect circle that will be of order @xmath12 .",
    "an interesting feature of the un - perturbed solution is that the image of a single point at the origin is a full circle , which covers all range in @xmath0 .",
    "thus whatever the position @xmath0 of the perturbed solution , there is always a point at the same @xmath0 in the un - perturbed solution .",
    "however , the point in the un - perturbed solution will be located at a slightly different radius @xmath6 .",
    "the response to the perturbation on @xmath6 may be written , @xmath16 . for convenience ,",

    "the result is visible in fig .",
    "note that the large tangential arc is well reproduced by the approximation while there is some offset in the position of the inner image .",
    "the problem of the inner image can be corrected using an iterative approach : the perturbative method gives a first guess of the image position , at this initial position one may carry a local taylor expansion of the potential in order to find a better solution , and the procedure may be iterated again .",
    "given a system of arcs or arclets it is possible to re - construct the perturbation field .",
    "let s define the arc system to reconstruct as a set of contours , with one contour per image .",
    "for each contour a radial line of direction @xmath0 intersect the contour in 2 points , @xmath50 and @xmath51 ( provided that @xmath0 is in a suitable range ) .",
    "it is simple to relate these 2 functionals to the fields , @xmath33 and @xmath32 of the perturbative approach , in the case of a source with circular contour ( eq .",

    "note that @xmath54 is unknown , actually there is a fundamental degeneracy in @xmath54 , only @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 may be determined . by using inner of radial image in the iterative approach mentioned in sec .",
    "( 3.3 ) , in some case it might be possible to break the degeneracy on @xmath54 .",
    "it is clear also that instead of circular contours , one could have considered elliptical one , and eq .",
    "( [ ellipse_eq ] ) may have been used . in such case , it is just a matter of where to put the complexity , either in the source or the lens , and obviously the judging criteria should be that as a whole the complexity is minimal .",
    "caustics are singularities , which are defined by the simple property that the determinant of the jacobian matrix @xmath58 is zero on the caustic lines . @xmath59",
