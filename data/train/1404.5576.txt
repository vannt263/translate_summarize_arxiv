    "dirac invented his relativistic equation in order to explain the quantum properties of the electron ( spin @xmath4 ) in the relativistic framework : the equation had to ( _ a _ ) display the formula @xmath5 as the eigenenergy of a particle in free motion ( with @xmath6 ) ; ( _ b _ ) be covariant under a lorentz transformation that links the particle dynamical properties between two inertial frames .",
    "dirac found that the sound equation had to be expressed , necessarily , in terms of @xmath7 matrices .",
    "its more familiar form is @xmath8 , with the hamiltonian being linear in the momentum @xmath9 , @xmath10 and the @xmath7 matrices @xmath11 and @xmath12 , have to satisfy forcefully the relations @xmath13 with @xmath14 for the unit matrix ( in dirac s book @xcite , instead of @xmath15 we find a @xmath7 matrix @xmath16 multiplying the @xmath7 direct product of pauli matrices @xmath17 ) .",
    "an usual approach consists in the introduction of the chiral representation , where the components of the matrix vector , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , are respectively in contravariant and covariant forms , in the same fashion that one has @xmath20 and @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "the state vector solution to the dirac equation can be written as the sum , @xmath22 of left and right chiral spinors @xmath23 and @xmath24 , @xmath25 . from dirac equation plus eq",
    ".  ( [ hamdirac ] ) and ( [ state1 ] ) one constructs two coupled differential equations for the spinors @xmath26 and @xmath27 , @xmath28 whose lagrangian is @xcite ( omitting the explicit dependence on @xmath29 ) , @xmath30    interestingly , the dirac equation allows a different insight when written in terms of direct ( or kronecker ) products of pauli matrices .",
    "so , daring to interpret quantum mechanics as a special kind of information theory for particles and fields @xcite , in the language of quantum information we may say that the relativistic equation of a spin-1/2 fermion has as solution a state of two _ qubits _ ( two degrees of freedom ) carried by a massive particle whose dynamical evolution in space is represented by a continuous variables that may be the position or the linear momentum @xcite .",
    "hereon we will choose the linear momentum representation ( as a c - number ) instead of using the position operator @xmath31 , since we are not introducing a position dependent potential in the hamiltonian .",
    "one can appreciate that fact by writing the matrices @xmath15 and @xmath32 in terms of tensor products of pauli matrices @xmath33 where the upperscripts 1 and 2 refer to qubits 1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "thus we write the dirac hamiltonian ( [ hamdirac ] ) in terms of the direct product of two - qubit operators , @xmath34 , and the two solutions to dirac equation are @xmath35 , \\label{sol1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 and @xmath3 stand respectively for negative and positive energy solutions , @xmath37 , with @xmath38 .",
    "the state @xmath39 is a spinor representing the spatial motion of the free fermion ( @xmath40 in the momentum representation ) coupled to its spin , which describes a structureless magnetic dipole moment .",
    "for qubit 1 the kets , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , are identified as the intrinsic parity eigenstates of the fermion .",
    "the states are orthogonal , @xmath43 . for the inner product we get @xmath44 , with the normalization factor @xmath45 and",
    "we also assume that the local probability distribution for the momenta is normalized , @xmath46 .",
    "thus the spinors and @xmath7 matrices stand for the the direct product of the intrinsic degrees of freedom of a massive spin-1/2 fermion , parametrized by the linear momentum @xmath9 , on free motion in space .",
    "since @xmath47 , one has @xmath48 that leads to einstein s dispersion relation @xmath49 .",
    "as so , the state ( [ sol1 ] ) has no definite intrinsic parity , qubit 1 is in a superposition of both eigenstates .",
    "the total parity operator @xmath50 acts on the kronecker product @xmath51 as @xmath52 ; indeed it is the product of two operators , the intrinsic parity @xmath53 ( having two eigenvalues , @xmath54 ) and the spatial parity @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "thus , @xmath57 applies on @xmath58 , eq .",
    "( [ sol1 ] ) , and it follows that @xmath59 . regarding the spatial parity operator @xmath60 the @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) sign stands for axial ( polar ) vectors .",
    "complementarily , the @xmath63-matrices are @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 .",
    "there is an asymmetry between the two terms within the brackets in the solution ( [ sol1 ] ) : the first one represents the limit for the non - relativistic state of a spin @xmath4 free fermion , namely , the solution to the schrdinger equation , while the second term is responsible for the relativistic effect ( containing the helicity operator @xmath68 ) . due to the correlation between the parity and helicity qubits , a hypothetical measurement that results in qubit @xmath41 would reduces the dirac solution to the non - relativistic schrdinger equation while if the result of the measurement is qubit @xmath69 the solution is reduced to the purely relativistic term",
    ". however , there is no hint that the nature selects one of the two components under any kind of measurement . nevertheless ,",
    "as we are going to see below , for an ensemble of fermions in contact with a thermal reservoir , one intrinsic parity eigenstate will be selected naturally as an effect of cooling .    the helicity eigenvalue equation @xmath70 has orthogonal eigenstates @xmath71 ( @xmath72 , @xmath73 ) where the angles @xmath74 and @xmath75 determine the direction of @xmath76 ( on a spherical surface of radius 1 the tips of the versors @xmath76 and @xmath77 are localized by the angles @xmath78 and @xmath79 ) and the kets @xmath80 , @xmath81 stand for @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "so , the spinor @xmath84 can be written as the superposition @xmath85 ( we omit the subscript @xmath86 ) where @xmath87 is the density distribution of the linear momentum .",
    "the spinor ( [ h ] ) correlates the linear momentum ( a c - number ) to the helicity eigenstates , however , for simplicity , we are going to assume that the linear momentum is not correlated to the helicity , therefore @xmath88 where a mixing angle , @xmath89 } $ ] , and a relative phase , @xmath90 , have been introduced .",
    "the helicity sector of the dirac equation solution will make use of the spinors @xmath91 with @xmath92 that are normalized @xmath93 , however they are orthogonal only for @xmath94 , because @xmath95 .",
    "it is worth noting that doing the changes @xmath96 and @xmath97 we get @xmath98 . for a normalized linear momentum distribution , @xmath99",
    ", one has @xmath100 and @xmath101    the simplified form of the time - independent component of eq .",

    "for an ensemble of free fermions interacting with a thermal environment at temperature @xmath108 , we identify the probability density @xmath109 with a normalized distribution function isotropic in the linear momentum , @xmath110 . integrating eq .",
    "( [ pure ] ) over the linear momentum , the reduced density matrix becomes @xmath111 where we omit the subscripts @xmath3 and @xmath86 in the right - side .",

    "as we admitted that qubit 1 stands for the intrinsic parity of the fermion , we get the correlation density operator for helicity and intrinsic parity as suggested many years ago by t. d. lee and c. n. yang @xcite , in an _ ad - hoc _ procedure . in that case",

    "@xcite ) the density matrix describes a coherent collection of _ spinorial _ particles that exhibit spin and parity as correlated quantum features , through which a suitable interference phenomena between parity doublets is identified .",
    "furthermore , setting @xmath129 the fermi - dirac distribution can be written as @xcite @xmath130 where we have set the boltzmann constant @xmath131 and @xmath132 is a riemann zeta function . the coefficients ( [ m+- ] ) )",
    "can be calculated numerically , @xmath133 with @xmath134 ( temperature per unit mass with @xmath135 ) . in table",
    "i we present the values of the @xmath136 for different temperatures .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] we have drawn the coefficients @xmath137 ( for fermions ) as function of @xmath138 , that contain the amount of correlation between spin and intrinsic parity of a fermi gas embedded in a thermalized environment . now we speculate about the meaning of the results .",
    "focusing our attention on the cosmological scenario , the temperature of the universe is a parameter that , roughly , parallels the evolution in time : after the initial surge of a very hot and compact seed of energy , the radiation dominated universe expands and cools down , still keeping the thermalized blackbody frequency distribution .",
    "the higher ( lower ) the temperature the earlier ( later ) is its age and size , @xmath139 where @xmath140 is the expansion parameter . at quite high temperatures , @xmath141 , or @xmath142 ( for electrons @xmath143 ) , the coefficients @xmath144 , @xmath145 and @xmath146",
    "are close to @xmath147 , while as @xmath148 , @xmath149 and @xmath145 , and @xmath150 go to zero .",
    "thus , at early times , when the universe was quite hot , the fermions ( and also antifermions ) existed with positive and negative intrinsic parity ( @xmath151 @xmath152 ) , whereas the transition amplitudes , from positive to negative parity , and vice versa , were almost the same . as the universe gone",
    "expanding the temperature was reducing , then one parity ( positive ) began to dominate over the other , @xmath153 , @xmath154 ) , and the transition amplitude @xmath155 was reducing too , so the negative parity fermions became scarcer .",
    "as the universe cooled further , say at @xmath156 ( @xmath157 ) for @xmath158 , the fraction of negative to positive parity fermions became @xmath159 , while the inverse comes out for the @xmath36 antifermions . at the present epoch",
    "the positive parity fermions dominate , constituting the building blocks of the observed universe , while those having negative parity are reduced to almost beyond observation .    by its turns if we consider the negative energy solution ( @xmath36 ) , for the antifermions , the inverse occurs , negative parity prevails at low temperature while the positive parity fermions become quite scarce .",
    "so after our calculations the separation between positive parity fermions and negative parity antifermions in the present cold universe finds a plausible explanation .     as a function of the temperature parameter @xmath138.,title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "the charge conjugation operation changes matter into antimatter and it is represented by the operator is @xmath160 , where @xmath161 stands for the complex conjugation operator and @xmath162 .",
    "it transforms a dirac spinor as @xmath163",
    "thus a state is invariant under @xmath164 operation whenever @xmath165 and @xmath166 .",
    "applying @xmath164 on ( [ sol1 ] ) one obtains @xmath167 implying also the change @xmath168 .",
    "now , applying @xmath169 on the right and @xmath164 on the left of state ( [ dens4 ] ) , the coefficients do not change , while @xmath170 and @xmath171 , thus @xmath172 differs from @xmath173 by the following interchanges @xmath174 and @xmath175 , or , fermion ( @xmath176 ) and antifermion ( @xmath177 ) interchange their role .",
    "the parity - helicity density matrix is @xmath178 from which we verify that , under the peres - horodecki criterion @xcite , there is no entanglement between intrinsic parity and helicity since the partially transposed matrix , @xmath179 , coincides with @xmath180 .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath181 are @xmath182 that we shall use bellow .",
    "we have omitted the explicit dependence on @xmath138 .",
    "the reduced normalized state for the intrinsic parity is @xmath183 where the nondiagonal term stands for the transition probabilities @xmath184 , @xmath185 , so the strength of a transition depends on the mixing angle @xmath186 . as the fermi gas cools , @xmath187 , independently of the value of @xmath188 and @xmath189 , so the state decoheres at a lower rate than it takes for the system to reduce the negative ( @xmath190 ) or positive parity ( @xmath191 ) contribution to the mixture . for @xmath192",
    "we find @xmath193 .",
    "the eigenvalues of intrinsic parity state ( [ red1 ] ) are @xmath194    by its turn , the normalized density operator for the helicity is diagonal @xmath195 and the coefficients are @xmath196 and @xmath197    for @xmath198 or @xmath199 , @xmath200 , @xmath201 @xmath202 , therefore , there is no natural preference for any helicity direction , neither a dependence on the temperature . for @xmath203 or @xmath204 , and @xmath158 , the probabilities are unbalanced and show a dependence on the temperature , @xmath205 , since at low temperatures @xmath206 , see table ii . in the present epoch",
    "the helicity does not show any directional preference for the fermions , they are found in positive and negative helicity equally likely , so @xmath207 is the most plausible choice for any value for the mixture angle @xmath189 and temperature @xmath138 .",
    "the von - neumann entropy of a density operator @xmath208 is defined as @xmath209 , where @xmath210 are the eigenvalues , thus we calculate the mutual information between intrinsic parity and helicity as @xmath211 for several values of the mixture angles @xmath189 and the phase @xmath212 , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig02 ] .     as a function of the temperature parameter @xmath138 .",
    "the plots are for several choices of the mixing angle @xmath189 .",
    "different lines represent different phases : @xmath213 ( black ) , @xmath214(red ) , and @xmath215 ( blue ) . for each @xmath186 and for different @xmath216",
    ", the curves show very tiny mutual deviations from each other .",
    "@xmath217 decreases to zero at the non - relativistic ( @xmath218 ) limit and increases to its maximal value at the ultra - relativistic ( @xmath141 ) regime.,title=\"fig : \" ]    the variation of @xmath212 implies into some very tiny mutual deviations from each other at the transition regime ( from ur to nr ) , i.e. , @xmath212 has not any relevant qualitative effect onto the mutual information between parity and helicity , thus reinforcing our previous hint for the choice @xmath204 .",
    "as expected , the mutual information @xmath217 is insignificant at low temperature , @xmath219 , while it is maximal for @xmath141 .",
    "it is common knowledge @xcite that at the very early universe ( @xmath220 ) the photons had enough energy to become electron - positron pairs , so electrons and positrons existed in thermal equilibrium with the radiation . at about 400 000 years after the big bang",
    "there is change , radiation is free to pass through the universe as its expansion changes it from opaque to transparent .",
    "as the universe expanded it cooled , and when the temperature reduced to @xmath221 photons had not enough energy to create @xmath222 pairs , so electrons and positrons were no longer in thermal equilibrium but radiation acquired a thermalized blackbody distribution .",
    "a fundamental question is : why matter ( positive intrinsic parity ) eventually dominated over anti - matter ( negative intrinsic parity ) , which , presumably , were initially in equal footing ?",
    "our calculations and results can not explain the `` disappearance '' of the antifermions that existed in the early universe , however it hints of why at the present epoch the fermions  the quarks and leptons that constitute matter  have positive intrinsic parity ( our estimate is @xmath2 positive for 1 negative parity fermions ) and any produced antifermion has a negative intrinsic parity , although the calculations show that at the early universe fermions and antifermions existed in a superposition of both parities entangled the helicity states . otherwise , on the non - relativistic limit the mutual information is null : any quantum correlation between the particle / antiparticle character and the state spin - polarization vanishes .",
    "it corresponds to an issue that can be reproduced , from the mathematical point of view , by a foldy - wouthuysen unitary transformation @xcite ] .",
    "finally , we point out the essentiality of the present framework @xcite , where it was assumed that the dirac equation and the spinors describe the dynamics and the state of a massive particle carrying two qubits of information , the helicity and the intrinsic parity . that approach permits quantifying the quantum correlation and the entanglement between the particle / antiparticle degrees of freedom . moreover , we believe that it might be relevant discussing the destruction of the `` mirror '' symmetry ( external parity or _ left / right_-handed character ) in particle decays involving electroweak interactions , a point that certainly deserves to be scrutinized in the subsequent investigations .",
