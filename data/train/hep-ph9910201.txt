    "according to recent measurements of direct cp violation in @xmath10 decays , @xmath0 is @xmath11 @xcite . theoretical prediction ranges around @xmath12 .",

    "an interesting possibility is suggested as an explanation for large @xmath13 in the standard model @xcite .",
    "the authors argue that the mechanism which enhances @xmath1 amplitude may also enhance @xmath0 and it naturally leads to the measured values .",
    "the enhancement comes from the feynman diagram which includes the scalar @xmath2 meson as intermediate state .",
    "the mechanism was found in the framework of linear @xmath2 model @xcite .",

    "su(3 ) breaking ratio @xmath17 is also determined by the same input and numerically it is around @xmath18 .",
    "the enhancement factor of a qcd penguin operator is written as @xmath19 these relations and numbers are specific predictions of the linear @xmath2 model . because the dynamical property of the linear @xmath2 model is not same as that of qcd , these relations and numbers may be taken as semi - quantitative @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we study the matrix elements of the qcd and ew penguins with the non - linear @xmath2 model including scalar mesons . the model is built with chiral symmetry as a guide .",
    "it is more general than the linear @xmath2 model and less dependent on dynamical assumption .",
    "the cost is that it has more parameters .",
    "they can be determined with the experimental measured quantities , i.e. , decay width , mass spectrum , etc .",
    "still @xmath2 meson mass is left as a free parameter because the spectroscopy of @xmath2 meson @xmath20 allows wide range for the mass .",

    "we study how qcd and ew penguin matrix elements depend on the mass of @xmath2 meson . here",

    "chpt is a systematic treatment , in the sense of the small momentum expansion , and describes low energy processes involved pions and kaons well .",
    "however higher order terms in chpt are of great importance if threshold of the @xmath2 meson is near to kaon mass .",
    "thus it is very interesting to explore non - linear @xmath2 model with scalar resonances in kaon decays .",
    "correspondence between non - linear @xmath2 model with resonances and chpt was well discussed in refs.@xcite at order of @xmath21 and their results indicate that the resonance contributions dominate the low energy coupling constants in the strong part of @xmath21 chiral lagrangian . in our approach , we compute the full contribution of the @xmath2 meson to the factorizable part of qcd and ew penguins using non - linear @xmath2 model with scalar resonances , so that a certain class of higher order terms of @xmath22 in momentum expansion are included .",

    "we should remark one point about the quark mass .",
    "in large @xmath38 limit , we approximate the matrix elements with @xmath120 operator by the product of matrix elements with scalar quark operator at scale @xmath27 . using pcac relation",

    ", the scale of the strange quark mass should be the same scale @xmath27 .",
    "therefore , when we substitute the mass parameter @xmath26 in our final result , we should run the quark mass to the factorization scale @xmath27=0.8,1.0,1.2 gev .",
    "for example , @xmath26(2gev)= 80 @xmath40 120 mev corresponds to @xmath26(0.8gev)=136 @xmath40 204 mev .",
    "figure [ eta_m ] shows the dependence of @xmath122 from our model on the scalar resonance mass @xmath95 . here , we take @xmath123(2gev)=80,120,180 mev , which cover the recent qcd calculations @xcite , and the scale @xmath27 is chosen to be 0.8 gev .",
    "upper and lower lines correspond to the maximum and minimum values of @xmath124 , respectively .",
    "we find that when @xmath95 is larger than @xmath39 gev in order for @xmath122 to lie within 0.27 - 0.52 , which is favored by other measurements of ckm parameters , @xmath123(2gev ) should take rather small value 0.09 @xmath40 0.12 gev .",

    ".    finally , in figure [ a0 ] , we show the correlation of @xmath125 and @xmath126 by changing the scalar meson mass from 0.6 gev to 1 gev .",
    "we take three different values of @xmath127(2gev ) , which are 80 , 100 and 120 mev .",
    "we take three values for the factorization scale @xmath27 , which are 0.8 , 1.0 and 1.2 gev .",
    "we used the experimental values of @xmath107 for the numerical analysis of @xmath0 .",
    "cp violation parameter is chosen to be 0.3 in the figure .",
    "the shaded region is the experimental data from ktev and na48 for @xmath128 at 2-@xmath2 confidence level .",
    "we find that @xmath126 can be easily explained in our model by a suitable choice of the parameters",
    ". typical value of @xmath95 , and @xmath127(2gev ) is around 0.8 gev and around 80 mev respectively almost independent of the factorization scale @xmath27 .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath129 in our model are smaller than experiment .",
    "we find that it is quite sensitive to the factorization scale @xmath27 , and as @xmath27 gets smaller , @xmath129 becomes larger towards the experimental value . for @xmath27=0.8 gev , @xmath130 is around 0.5 @xmath40 0.6 .",
    "the sensitivity of @xmath34 amplitude on @xmath27 can be understood as follows .",
    "the wilson coefficient @xmath131 vanishes when the gim cancellation between the charm penguin and up penguin loop is exact . in our calculation , since we take the @xmath132 scheme , the cancellation is exact above charm threshold",
    ". therefore , @xmath131 takes nonzero value only when @xmath133 .",
    "since the factorization scale is very close to the charm threshold , the result of @xmath131 changes quite a lot .",
    "in contrast , the wilson coefficient @xmath134 vanishes when the gim cancellation between the top penguin charm penguin loop is exact .",
    "since top decouples already below @xmath135 , this cancellation is completely violated and @xmath134 takes nonzero value from the start and keeps growing all the way down to the factorization scale . since @xmath136 and @xmath137 is almost identical , @xmath134 is not so sensitive to the factorization scale . about @xmath138 ,",
    "our result is about @xmath139 times larger than the experimental value .",
    "in this paper , we study the correlation of @xmath1 amplitude and @xmath0 in the framework of non - linear @xmath2 model including the scalar mesons . we have calculated the matrix elements of the qcd and ew penguins using that model and within the factorization approximation .",
    "we can not find the scalar meson mass region which is compatible with both @xmath0 and @xmath1 amplitude simultaneously .",
    "the reason is follows .",
    "we can read from fig.2 , the maximum allowed value for @xmath140 is about @xmath141 .",
    "the bag - factor @xmath142 required for @xmath0 is at most @xmath143 , which corresponds to @xmath144 gev . in the range of the scalar meson mass , about @xmath145 of @xmath1 amplitude",
    "may be explained .",
    "therefore , if we impose the @xmath0 constraint , we can not explain the whole @xmath1 amplitude .",
    "moreover , @xmath0 is rather stable for the change of the factorization scale .",
    "this suggests that the prediction of @xmath0 may be more reliable .",
    "though there is strong correlation between @xmath1 amplitude and @xmath0 , we conclude the understanding of @xmath1 rule may not be complete .    finally , we argue what kind of effects may remedy the problem . because qcd penguin @xmath46 is born just below @xmath42 , the coefficient is not stable about the change of the factorization scale around 1 gev . in the scheme ,",
    "in which gim cancellation is incomplete above @xmath146 , the leading order results of the wilson coefficient of @xmath46 becomes larger by a factor of 2 @xcite .",
    "this effect was not incorporated in the wilson coefficients of nll approximation employed here .",
    "therefore the same effect may further enhance the wilson coefficient of @xmath46 used in our analysis .",
    "we also note that the real part of the @xmath147 amplitude is larger by a factor of 1.5 than the experimental value .",
    "this may tell us that there is some suppression ( enhancement ) coming from the low energy evolution ( pion loops ) for cp conserving @xmath147 ( @xmath1 ) amplitudes @xcite .",
    "a plausible explanation is that the non - factorizable contributions are very large .",

    "<S> we study the correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath1 rule in the framework of non - linear @xmath2 model including scalar mesons . using this model we estimate the chiral corrections by resumming to all orders in chiral perturbation theory , the contribution of a class of diagrams within the factorization approximation . with these matrix elements and changing the scalar meson mass , we find that there is correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath1 amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is difficult to explain both @xmath0 and @xmath1 amplitude simultaneously . in order to be compatible with @xmath0 , </S>",
