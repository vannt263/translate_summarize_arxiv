    "the existence of pure neutron systems could have far - reaching implication in nuclear physics @xcite .",
    "however the question of multineutron existence is far from being cut - and - dried both theoretically and in experiment , being fed by a long series of controversial predictions and measurements .",
    "recently much attention have been paid to the possible existence of bound tetraneutron ( four - neutron system ) .",
    "this interest has been triggered by the experimental observation of few events in the @xmath0be break - up reaction  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand such a prospect rises serious objections from the point of view of nuclear interaction theory .",
    "it has been shown by several groups  @xcite that realistic nuclear hamiltonians exclude the existence of bound @xmath1 @xmath2 and even larger neutron clusters .",
    "in fact , the most favorable mechanism to construct tetraneutron would be by putting together two virtual ( almost bound ) dineutron pairs .",
    "however , in order to force the binding of virtual dineutrons one has to have very strong neutron - neutron interaction in  _ p _ and/or higher partial waves , which is not compatible with our present comprehension of the nuclear interaction .",
    "nevertheless the possible existence of resonant states in pure neutron systems having observable effects in nuclear reactions , could not be eliminated .",
    "such a scenario is evoked in a recent analysis of @xmath3 reaction : some excess of low energy @xmath4li nuclei has been observed , which can not be explained by phase space analysis involving both four free neutrons and two non - correlated dineutron pairs in the final state  @xcite .",
    "furthermore authors of  @xcite in their very recent study  @xcite agreed that previously observed signals could result from the existence of near - threshold four - neutron resonance , without involving bound tetraneutron .",
    "the aim of this study is to clarify whether or not the existence of resonant tetraneutrons can be tolerated by modern nuclear interaction models and thus if these experimental claims can be supported in a theoretical ground .",
    "this work is a natural extension of our preceding work  @xcite , in which we have demonstrated that realistic nuclear hamiltonians exclude the existence of physically observable three - neutron resonances .",
    "no proper ab - initio calculations of the resonant tetraneutron with realistic nn forces are known to the authors .",
    "some conclusions were drawn in favor of its existence based on calculations of tetraneutron bound in an external well  @xcite ; furthermore it was suggested that these resonances could have rather large widths .",
    "the only rigorous study of tetraneutron resonances was accomplished in ref .",
    "@xcite using the simplistic mt i - iii nn interaction , which contains only _ s_-waves .",
    "unfortunately no observable resonances have been found there and only the existence of some broad subthreshold structures ( s - matrix poles with negative real energy parts ) was pointed out .",
    "the same authors remarked however that the positions of these subthreshold states strongly depend on the details of the nn interaction used .",
    "realistic nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) models contain indeed interactions in higher partial waves and are therefore better suited to accomodate tetraneutron and push its resonant states out of the subthreshold region .",
    "although many of the nuclear excited states are resonances , they are seldom considered in theoretical nuclear structure calculations due to the huge technical difficulties of solving the continuum states in many - body problems .",
    "these states are often treated as being bound , but such a procedure is justified only for very narrow resonances and is not appropriate in our case .",
    "resonant tetraneutron , if existing at all , will probably have a rather large width .",
    "the problem we are dealing with represents therefore a double challenge : first it is a four - particle problem and second , being a continuum state , it has an exponentially diverging wave function .",
    "we will present in what follows the equations allowing to solve the four - particle problem in a mathematically rigorous way and describe the methods that make possible the treatment of resonant states .    in order to solve the four - body problem",
    "we decompose the wave function into a sum of 18 faddeev - yakubovsky ( fy ) components , see fig  [ fig_4b_config ] , and rewrite the schrdinger equation as a set of coupled fy equations  @xcite",
    ". if all four particles are identical , only two of the 18 fy components are independent , which we denote by @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "these components are furthermore related by two integrodifferential equations : @xmath7   \\notag \\\\",
    "\\left ( e - h_{0}-v\\right ) h & = & v\\tilde{p}\\left [ ( 1+q)k+h\\right ]   \\label{fye}\\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are particle permutation operators : @xmath12and @xmath13 is a pauli factor related to the exchange of two identical particles : @xmath14 for two identical fermions . using these notations ,",
    "the four - body wave functions is given by : @xmath15 ( 1+p^{+}+p^{-})k+(1+p^{+}+p^{-})(1+% \\tilde{p})h   \\label{wf_fy}\\ ] ]    each fy component @xmath16 is considered as a function of a proper jacobi coordinate set ( @xmath17 ) , defined respectively by @xmath18the angular , spin and isospin dependence of these components is expanded using tripolar harmonics @xmath19 , i.e : @xmath20the quantities @xmath21 are called regularized fy amplitudes , and the label @xmath22 holds for the set of 10 intermediate quantum numbers describing a @xmath23 state . when describing tetraneutron , the isospin dependence of the fy amplitudes can be omitted , and the set of quantum numbers @xmath24 reduces to 8 elements .",
    "we use the @xmath25 scheme for the intermediate coupling of fy amplitudes , defined as @xmath26 _ { j_{3}}(l_{z}s_{4})_{j_{z}}\\right\\ } _ { j^{\\pi } } \\label{pwd } \\\\ h & \\equiv & \\left\\ { \\left [ \\left ( l_{x}(s_{1}s_{2})_{\\sigma _ { x}}\\right ) _ { j_{x}}\\left ( l_{y}(s_{3}s_{4})_{\\sigma _ { y}}\\right ) _ { j_{y}}\\right ] _ { j_{xy}}l_{z}\\right\\ } _ { j^{\\pi }",
    "} \\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath27 is the spin of the individual particle and @xmath28 the total angular momentum of the four - particle system .",
    "each of the @xmath29 amplitudes in the expansion ( [ kpw ] ) is further conditioned by the antisymmetry properties @xmath30 for @xmath5 and @xmath31 for @xmath6 .",
    "fy components @xmath5 and @xmath6 are regular at the origin , and it can be shown that for bound state problem , they decrease exponentially outside the interaction domain . in this case",
    "one can impose these functions to vanish on the borders of some constrained box : @xmath32 equations ( [ fye]-[bs_bc ] ) are enough to solve the bound state problem .",
    "resonance wave functions are however divergent and can not be described by the boundary conditions ( [ bs_bc ] ) . in order to solve the resonance problem",
    ", we make use of two different methods , successfully applied in  @xcite to treat the three - neutron system .",
    "the implementation of these techniques in the four - body fy equations is analogous to the three - body case .",
    "therefore we only briefly discuss them here and the interested reader can refer to  @xcite for technical aspects .    the method of analytical continuation in the coupling constant ( accc ) , proposed by kukulin et al .",
    "@xcite , is based on the fact that a resonant state arises from a bound one when the interaction between the particles is made less attractive .",
    "the corresponding eigenenergy is considered as an analytical function of a coupling constant @xmath33 , which determines the strength of the attractive part of the potential .",
    "therefore , one can try to analytically continue the energy of the bound state as a function of the strength @xmath33 to the complex plane and obtain this way the width and the position of the resonance .",
    "it can be shown moreover that close to the threshold , where bound state turns into the resonance , the momenta @xmath34 is proportional to @xmath35where @xmath36 is a critical value of the coupling constant and @xmath37 is the threshold energy . if multiparticle system does not possess bound states in its subsystems , as it is a case for multineutron , then @xmath38    it turns out that using an analytical continuation of @xmath39 in terms of a simple polynomial expansion converges slowly and that pad expansion of order [ n , m ] @xmath40is more appropriate .",
    "it is quite simple to put accc method in practice .",
    "one should artificially bind tetraneutron by adding some attractive interaction to the system s hamiltonian @xmath41 then , the critical value of the coupling constant ( @xmath36 ) is determined and several eigenenergies values @xmath42 are calculated for @xmath43 ; they are used to fix the pad expansion  ( [ pade ] ) coefficients",
    ". however , to make this extrapolation efficient , one should provide rather accurate binding energies values @xmath44 and an especially precise @xmath36 as an input . while only few lowest order terms in pad expansion are enough to determine the positions of narrow nearthreshold resonances , the description of deep resonances requires several terms and very accurate input of @xmath45 .",
    "the determination of high order pad expansion terms requires at least five digit accuracy in the binding energies .",
    "the other method we use , namely complex scaling ( cs )  @xcite , can be applied to calculate resonance positions directly .",
    "this method makes use of the similarity transform @xmath46applied to the hamiltonian of the system , i.e : @xmath47such transformation does not affect the eigenvalue @xmath48 spectra . however , if the scaling angle is large enough ",
    "@xmath49  the modified resonance eigenfunctions @xmath50 become square integrable .",
    "evidently , the cs method can be applied to fy equation . by this transformation",
    "all the radial variables @xmath51 in eq.(fye ) are replaced by @xmath52 .",
    "the problem becomes analogous to a bound state one with complex variable and transformed fy amplitudes @xmath53 , which unlike resonance eigenfunctions @xmath54 are in hilbert space .",
    "cs transformation requires the analytical continuation of the potential @xmath55 into the complex plane @xmath56 .",
    "this turns out to be a weak point of this method when applied to nuclear systems , since as discussed in  @xcite , nuclear potentials have mischievous analytical properties : they become strongly oscillating and even divergent already for relatively small transformation angles @xmath57 .",
    "this fact limits the applicability of cs method to narrow resonances , with @xmath58 values .",
    "the numerical solution of fy equations is performed by expanding @xmath59 on a basis of three - dimensional piecewise hermite polynomials and projecting equation ( [ fye ] ) with boundary conditions ( [ bs_bc ] ) onto tripolar harmonics . in this way",
    ", the integro - differential fy equations are converted into a linear algebra problem : @xmath60with @xmath61 and @xmath62 being large square matrices , whereas @xmath63 and @xmath64 are respectively the eigenvalue and the eigenvectors to be determined . the reader interested in a detailed discussion on the formalism and the numerical methods used should refer to  @xcite .",
    "the results presented below have been obtained by using the charge - symetry breaking reid 93 potential to describe the nn interaction .",
    "this choice is dictated by purely practical reasons : as discussed in  @xcite , reid 93 model has better analytical properties to perform the complex scaling operation ( [ cst ] ) than his coordinate - space modern concurrents .",
    "we would like to remark however that other realistic nn interaction  namely av14 , av18 and nijm ii ",
    "provide very similar results for two- and three - neutron systems and exhibit also a similar behavior for the  artificially bound  tetraneutron .",
    "these facts let us believe that no qualitative changes in the four - neutron resonance can emerge from the properties of a particular model .",
    "all the calculations presented in what follows use the value @xmath65 mev@xmath66@xmath67 as an input for the neutron mass .    in a similar way as in the study of three - neutron system @xcite , we introduce an additional attractive four - nucleon ( 4n ) force to analyze the tetraneutron resonance trajectories in a systematic way . we have chosen the form : @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are respectively the strength and range parameters of the potential , and the hyperadius @xmath71 is an invariant quantity with respect to the permutation operators ( [ pp_operator ] ) .",
    "such kind of force is easy to implement in fy equations ( [ fye ] ) . in our previous work @xcite",
    "devoted to the three - neutron system , we have used a 3n force having the standard yukawa form .",
    "however we have found the functional form ( [ yukawa_3nf ] ) more appropriate for studying artificially bound tetraneutron .",
    "this form does not diverge as @xmath72 and thus avoids a rapid shrinking of the bound structures generated .",
    "as it has been already remarked in  @xcite , an extremely strong additional interaction is required to force tetraneutron binding . as a consequence ,",
    "the thus generated bound system is a very compact object making unlikely its physical existence . on the other hand ,",
    "resonances are extended structures . in order to ease the transition from bound to resonant tetraneutron",
    ", we have fixed a rather large value for the range parameter @xmath70 in ( [ yukawa_3nf ] ) and taken @xmath73 fm , a value considerably larger than the one we could expect for a realistic 4n interaction .",
    "our strategy to study 4n - resonances is to vary the strength of the potential @xmath69 and trace the resonance energy - trajectory @xmath74 .",
    "the final resonance positions , which correspond to realistic nuclear interaction , are eventually reached at @xmath75 .    when applying accc method , the parameter @xmath76 given in ( [ accc_ff ] ) is identified to the 4n force strength @xmath77 .",
    "we determine several auxiliary values of @xmath78 in the bound tetraneutron region @xmath79 .",
    "these values are later used as an input to determine the pad expansion coefficients @xmath80 of eq.([pade ] ) .",
    "few calculations are performed in low energy region as well to determine the critical value @xmath81 for which tetraneutron is bound with zero energy @xmath82 .",
    "once @xmath83 and @xmath36 are known , we use equation ( [ pade ] ) to analytically continue @xmath74 curve to the resonance region @xmath84 .    when applying cs method , we perform a series of direct resonance calculations for several decreasing values of @xmath85 , until the calculations become unstable due both to the large size of the resonance widths and to the necessity of using ever increasing scaling parameter @xmath86 .",
    "this method is used in the near threshold region ",
    "@xmath87 and im@xmath88re@xmath89  where it gives very good results to improve the accuracy of @xmath90 used in accc calculations .    .",
    "critical strengths @xmath91 ( mev@xmath92@xmath93 ) of the phenomenological force ( [ yukawa_3nf ] ) required to bind four neutrons in different states .",
    "the range parameter @xmath94 of this force was fixed to 2.5 fm .",
    "@xmath95 are the strength values at which tetraneutron becomes subthreshold , i.e. re@xmath96 . in the last row of the table are given the physical resonances positions ( @xmath97 ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in this region , accc results are still rather well converged ( better than @xmath98% ) with respect to the pad expansion .",
    "however this convergence is getting worst when one departs further and further from the bound state region . the accuracy of pad expansion is 20% near the subthreshold region , where resonance trajectory moves into the third energy quadrant .",
    "the accuracy of the physical resonance positions , when the additional interaction is fully removed ( @xmath97 ) , is at worst of 50% .",
    "these limitations in accc accuracy are due to the increasing size of the pad expansion argument @xmath99 , which forces to take into account higher order terms .",
    "the precise determination of high order pad coefficients fails due to the severe accuracy criteria it imposes to the input . as an example , we have illustrated in figure  [ fig_conver ] , the pad expansion convergence for @xmath100 .",
    "we can see that the shapes for [ n , m]=[3,3 ] and [ 4,4 ] order pad expansion curves are already very close to each other .",
    "however the separation between the energies corresponding to the same w values still exist and it increases when one departs from the bound state region .    the uncertainty in determining the final resonance positions is also manifested in figure  [ fig_2minus ] . in this figure , we compare the resonance trajectories for @xmath101 tetraneutron state obtained with 4nf of eq.([yukawa_3nf ] ) having different values of the range parameter @xmath94 .",
    "for @xmath102 fm we ended with a value @xmath103 mev , while for @xmath104 fm with @xmath105 mev .",
    "as it has been discussed above , tetraneutron negative parity states on one hand and @xmath106 and @xmath107 ones on the other hand , are almost degenerate in energy .",
    "this degeneracy is also reflected in the corresponding resonance trajectories , which superimpose close to the threshold .",
    "notice however that the small difference  not exceeding several kev  in the binding energies , results into an increasing separation of these curves .",
    "this demonstrates the necessity of performing very accurate inputs for the pad extrapolation and the difficulty of obtaining accurate predictions for broad resonances in the accc method .",
    "regardless the convergence problems mentioned above , our results indicate that the final resonance positions will always stay in the third energy quadrant for all tetraneutron states .",
    "an accurate determination of the physical resonance position is not possible with the methods used in the present work .",
    "nevertheless , for all calculations we have performed , they were situated in the third energy quadrant ( re(e)@xmath108,im(e)@xmath1090 ) .",
    "the approximate values for their positions obtained with the accc method and 4nf of equation ( [ yukawa_3nf ] ) are summarized in the last row of table  [ tab_val_w0 ] .",
    "the accuracy of these results is estimated to be of 50% .    in table",
    "[ tab_val_w0 ] we have also displayed the strengths @xmath95 of the 4n force ( [ yukawa_3nf ] ) at which the resonance trajectories crosses the imaginary - energy axis , slipping from fourth into third energy quadrant .",
    "one can argue that these values are pretty small and that a small correction of nuclear interaction ( like the presence of attractive three - nucleon force ) can push tetraneutron states back to the fourth energy quadrant ( with positive real energy parts ) . on this point",
    "we would like to mention that the smallness of @xmath95 is only apparent and entirely due to the unrealistic long range character of the 4nf we have chosen .",
    "@xmath95 value would increase drastically if the range of the potential @xmath110 is reduced to make 4nf more realistic .",
    "this fact is demonstrated in figure  [ fig_2minus ] , where @xmath95 value for @xmath111 tetraneutron state increases from 3.9 to 10.8 mev@xmath92@xmath93 when @xmath94 is reduced from 2.5 to 2 fm .",
    "this result shows that any realistic ( @xmath112 fm ) multineutron force should be very strong to keep a multineutron resonances in the fourth energy quadrant .",
    "the @xmath113 tetraneutron state represents an interesting case , since it shows the largest sensitivity to nn _",
    "p_-waves interaction .",
    "some 3n and 4n scattering observables which are difficult to be reproduced with the existing models indicate a strong nn @xmath114-waves contribution .",
    "it has been suggested that these discrepancies in 3n and 4n scattering observables can be significantly improved by modifying nn _",
    "p_-waves within 20%  @xcite .",
    "we have explored such a possibility and traced in fig .",
    "[ fig_2plus ] the tetraneutron resonance trajectory for reid 93 interaction with nn _ p_waves enhanced by a factor @xmath115=1.2 . by doing so a slightly weaker critical strength of 40.02 mev@xmath92@xmath93",
    "is required to bind tetraneutron , in comparison with 40.38 mev@xmath92@xmath93 of the original reid 93 force .",
    "however , apart from a small shift in the @xmath116 trajectory , such a modification of nn _ p_waves has not changed its qualitative behavior , ending up very close to its original value , always located in the third energy quadrant .",
    "these nn p - waves should be much more strongly enhanced , as much as creating dineutron resonances , to result in sizeable effects in tetraneutron resonance positions .",
    "finally , we would like to remark that even if there was a resonance in the fourth energy quadrant having a small real energy part and a large imaginary one , it would be difficult to identify it experimentally .",
    "resonance should have a rather small width @xmath117 to produce a visible effect in the experimental cross section and a @xmath118 centered breit - wigner shape . at most",
    ", it will give a weak enhancement in the cross section , hardly discernable from the background and not necessary centered around the @xmath118 .",
    "this makes very doubtful the perspective of physically observable tetraneutron resonances .",
    "their eventual existence would imply a too strong modifications in the present nuclear hamiltonians .",
    "our results are in qualitative agreement with the findings of sofianos et al .",
    "@xcite , where authors were able to accurately determine the tetraneutron resonance positions in the third energy quadrant for positive parity states , although using s - wave mt i - iii potential . due to the small influence of _ p _ and higher nn partial waves on tetraneutron states , _",
    "s_-wave models become very appropriate to study this system .",
    "configuration space faddeev - yakubovsky equations have been solved with the aim of determining the positions of the four - neutron resonances in the complex energy plane .",
    "realistic reid 93 nn interaction model has been used . a systematic study of four - neutron resonances",
    "have been accomplished by first adding to the nuclear hamiltonian an attractive four - neutron force to artificially bind tetraneutron .",
    "the trajectory of the energy eigenvalue is then traced as a function of the strength of the additional force until it is fully removed .",
    "the low lying four - neutron resonance trajectories , corresponding to states with quantum numbers @xmath119 , were shown to settle in the third energy quadrant ( re(e)@xmath108 , im(e)@xmath108 ) ) well before the additional 4n force is completely removed .",
    "furthermore , these resonances acquired a rather large imaginary energy @xmath120 mev and should hardly be experimentally observable .",
    "tetraneutron compound  bound or resonant  can be created only in strong external fields and would disintegrate right after such a field is removed .    finally , we have demonstrated that the four - neutron physics is entirely determined by nn _",
    "s_-waves , namely @xmath121 one , which is controlled by the experimentally measurable nn - scattering length .",
    "all realistic nuclear interaction models should thus provide qualitatively identical results for tetraneutron resonances .",
    "this fact is supported by performing similar studies binding artificially tetraneutron states using various nn models  @xcite .",
    "numerical calculations were performed at institut du dveloppement et des ressources en informatique scientifique ( idris ) from cnrs and at centre de calcul recherche et technologie ( ccrt ) from cea bruyres le chtel .",
