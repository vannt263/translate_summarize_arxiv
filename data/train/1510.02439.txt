    "the delafossite structural series of oxides has recently attracted considerable attention because of the remarkable and varied properties of the compounds in the series .",
    "its general formula is abo@xmath1 , in which a is a noble metal ( pt , pd , ag or cu ) and b a transition metal ( e.g. cr , co , fe , al and ni )  [ ] .",
    "the metal atoms are found in layers with triangular lattices , stacked along the perpendicular direction in various sequences , leading to structures similar to the layered rocksalt structure of the well - known ionic conductor licoo@xmath1 and of nacoo@xmath1 , which superconducts when intercalated by water .",
    "interlayer coupling is weak , so the delafossites are quasi - two dimensional .",
    "the low temperature properties across the series vary considerably with a and b combinations .",
    "known materials include candidate magnetoelectric insulators and thermoelectrics  [ , ] , transparent conductors  [ ] and band insulators  [ ] .",
    "there are also intriguing metals such as agnio@xmath1 and pdcro@xmath1 in which the conduction takes place between mott insulating layers with magnetic order  [ ] , and non - magnetic metals with ultra - high conductivity , such as pdcoo@xmath1 .",
    "although they have been less studied than the layered perovskites , the delafossites have considerable potential for new physics and technology ; epitaxial multilayers of delafossites and of delafossite / rocksalt combinations can be imagined .",
    "there is , therefore , a strong motivation to understand the fascinating properties of individual materials in the series .    in pdcoo@xmath1 , cobalt has formal valence of 3 + and the @xmath7 configuration , meaning that the states at the fermi level have dominantly pd character  [ ] , with a single half - filled band crossing the fermi level . at 300",
    "k the resistivity ( @xmath8 ) is 2.6  @xmath2 cm , lower per carrier than that of cu  [ ] . at low temperatures both the shape and",
    "the value of @xmath8 are very unusual .",
    "it is best fitted by @xmath9 ( with @xmath10 a constant and @xmath11  k ) rather than the power law expected for standard phonon scattering . at least as surprising as the form of @xmath8 is its value .",
    "a residual resistivity of only 7.5  n@xmath12 cm has been reported  [ ] .",
    "this corresponds to a mean free path ( @xmath13 ) of 20  @xmath14 m , or @xmath15 lattice spacings , an astonishing value in crystals grown from fluxes in hot crucibles that have not been subject to any post - growth purification .",
    "the high value of @xmath13 in pdcoo@xmath1 has important consequences for a number of physical properties , for example the out of plane magnetoresistance which is huge and varies strongly with field angle  [ ] , behavior consistent with observation of the long sought ` axial anomaly '  [ , ] .",
    "the subject of this paper , ptcoo@xmath1 , offers an opportunity to extend the study of the intriguing metallic delafossite oxides to a @xmath0 system where spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) is considerably stronger .",
    "although crystal growth  [ ] and room temperature resistivity  [ ] were reported over forty years ago , no temperature - dependent transport studies were carried out on those crystals , and further crystal growth proved to be extremely challenging .",
    "here we describe crystal growth using a different method to those previously attempted in ptcoo@xmath1 .",
    "this yields high - quality single crystals large enough for spectroscopic measurements . from angle - resolved photoemission ( arpes ) , combined with density - functional theory calculations and precise transport measurements performed on focused ion beam patterned crystals , we show that ptcoo@xmath1 hosts ultra - high conductivity derived from a single half - filled and nearly - free - electron - like pt @xmath0 band .",

    "however there were many crystals with uniform thickness without any steps .",
    "due to their brittleness and layered nature , the typical size of these crystals varies from in - plane dimensions of a few @xmath14 m to 0.3  mm , with a maximum thickness of @xmath21 m .",

    "one example is shown , along with its dimensions ( length between two voltage contacts 40  @xmath14 m , width 8.4  @xmath14 m and thickness 2.6  @xmath14 m ) , in fig . 1(c ) .    in fig .  [ f2 ]",
    "we show the in - plane resistivity of ptcoo@xmath1 crystals from the growth run described above . in total , approximately ten crystals were studied , and the reproducibility of the temperature dependence was excellent .",

[ f2 ] ( a ) .",
    "the residual resistivity ratio @xmath30 is typically 50 - 60 .",
    "the upturn is observed consistently in both as - grown crystals and those that were microstructured with the focused ion beam , so we are certain that it is not the result of ion - beam induced disorder .",
    "the measured magnetoresistance of ptcoo@xmath1 is positive for all temperatures above 2  k , making it unlikely that the kondo effect is the cause of the upturn",

    "the dots represent the fermi momenta extracted from ( a ) by fitting mdcs radially around the measured fermi surface.,width=14 ]    our arpes measurements ( fig .",
    "[ f3 ] ) directly reveal just such a fermi surface , comprised of a single electron pocket centred at the @xmath35 point of the brillouin zone .",
    "the sharp spectral features are indicative of quasi - two - dimensional electronic states  [ ] .",
    "the near - hexagonal fermi surface , rotated by 30@xmath36 with respect to the brillouin zone , is qualitatively similar to that of the bulk fermi surface of pdcoo@xmath1  [ ] .",
    "we find , however , that the ptcoo@xmath1 fermi surface has sharper corners and slightly concave faces .",
    "this is consistent with previous first - principles calculations  [ ] , as well as our own density - functional theory results ( fig .",

    "( b ) the grey and black dots represent the peak positions of the fits to the mdcs along the @xmath45 and @xmath40 direction , respectively . a linear fit to each data set",

    "this is comparable to arpes measurements of pdcro@xmath1  [ ] , but is slightly smaller than that expected for a half - filled zone derived from a single conduction electron per pt .",
    "in contrast , de haas - van alphen measurements indicate a luttinger count within 2% of half - filling .",
    "we thus ascribe the deviations in our arpes measurements as due to a possible small difference in surface chemistry from the bulk , sample - to - sample stoichiometry variations , or surface charge transfer . nonetheless , we find almost perfect agreement of the shape of our measured fermi surface with our calculations from density - functional theory scaled to have the same area ( fig .",
    "[ f3](b ) ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that our measurements are indicative of the bulk electronic structure of ptcoo@xmath1 .",
    "we note that , at lower photon energies , weak spectral features emerge giving rise to shoulders on the states reported here and residual spectral weight at the zone centre . from comparison to previous surface electronic structure calculations for pdcoo@xmath1  [ ] and arpes measurements of pdcro@xmath1  [ ] , we attribute these to pt - terminated surface states not visible at the higher photon energies shown here due to photoemission cross - section variations  [ ] , although their weak weight precludes an unambiguous assignment between these features .",
    "other cleaves showed stronger surface - derived features but a bulk band in quantitative agreement with the one found here .",
    "[ f5](a ) shows the bulk band dispersion measured along the @xmath40 direction .",
    "consistent with our measured fermi surface , we find a single band in the vicinity of @xmath37 .",
    "it is extremely steep , dispersing by less than 5% of the brillouin zone over the energy range of 0.6  ev below the fermi level shown in fig  [ f5](a ) .",
    "indeed , from fits to mdcs , we find negligible deviations from linearity over a range exceeding 0.25  ev below @xmath37 , together with a high fermi velocity of @xmath52  m / s [ @xmath53  ev/@xmath54 .",
    "this is several times larger than observed in other metallic @xmath0 oxides  [ , ] , and yields an effective mass , @xmath41 , within 10% of the free - electron mass . with no free parameters",
    ", employing this effective mass within a simple parabolic model well reproduces our measured dispersion over an extended energy range ( fig .",
    "[ f5](a ) ) .    the fermi velocity [ @xmath55  m / s ] that we extract along @xmath45 is the same as that along @xmath40 within our experimental resolution ( fig .",
    "[ f5](b ) ) .",
    "this is almost 20% higher than that measured along the @xmath45 direction in pdcoo@xmath1  [ ] . due to the higher @xmath56 along @xmath45 than @xmath40 ,",
    "the effective mass obtained from our measured fermi velocity , @xmath57 , deviates further from the free - electron mass .",
    "the average mass of @xmath58 is in excellent agreement with the value of @xmath59 obtained from quantum oscillations of ptcoo@xmath1  [ ] , and again notably smaller than the values of around @xmath60 obtained for pdcoo@xmath1  [ ] .",
    "the above measurements point to light quasiparticles in this system , in keeping with their extremely high conductivity , with an even wider electronic bandwidth of the state crossing @xmath37 in ptcoo@xmath1 than the pd - derived sister compound . in pdcoo@xmath1 , it has proved controversial whether the high conductivity and low effective masses are mediated by significant pd @xmath61@xmath4 orbital mixing  [ , , , , ] . to specifically address this issue ,",
    "we have performed our density functional calculations using a local - orbital rather than plane - wave basis ( see methods ) , which allows a well - justified assignment of orbital characters .",
    "we find that the density of states at the fermi level originates predominantly from pt states , with almost 90% pt - related character .",
    "approximately 85% of these states belong to the pt  5@xmath4 orbitals with only a small admixture of pt  @xmath62 and pt  6@xmath63 ( fig .",
    "[ figdos](b ) ) . due to the localized nature of the co @xmath64 shell ,",
    "the strong coulomb repulsion for these states was taken into account explicitly ( see fig .",
    "[ figdos ] ( a ) and methods ) .",
    "this suppresses an unphysical hybridization of the co-@xmath64 states with the pt-@xmath0 states near the fermi level which cause a pronounced rounding of alternating fermi surface corners in contrast to the experiment .",
    "this suppression occurs for @xmath65  ev , after which the fermi surface topology and its orbital character are insensitive to the value of @xmath66 used over our investigated range of up to 6  ev .",
    "the pt @xmath4-orbital derived nature of the fermi surface found here is entirely in keeping with its faceted nature that we observe , while the increase of electronic bandwidth compared to pdcoo@xmath1 can naturally be understood from the spatially more extended nature of pt  @xmath0 than pd  @xmath67 orbitals .",
    "remarkably , the effective masses we observe here are a factor of 2 - 3 smaller than even those of the strongly",
    "_ s_-_d_-hybridized electron fermi surface sheets in pt metal  [ ] .    from the bulk fermi surface , we can straightforwardly convert our resistivity measurements shown in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] to a temperature - dependent mean free path , which we find rises from 700   at room temperature to as high as 4  @xmath14 m at 16  k. this is qualitatively consistent with the sharp spectral features we observe in arpes .",
    "we observe narrow line widths of mdcs at the fermi level of better than 0.04  @xmath44 ( fig .",
    "[ f5](a ) ) , very similar to those reported previously for pdcoo@xmath1  [ ] and comparable to our experimental angular resolution .",
    "these remain clearly resolved to high binding energies , with @xmath68  @xmath44 increase in linewidth over the first 350  mev binding energy range .",
    "this indicates a striking resilience of the quasiparticle lifetime away from the fermi level , suggesting weak electron - electron scattering in ptcoo@xmath1 .",
    "this is in contrast to other well - known fermi - liquid oxide metals such as sr@xmath1ruo@xmath69  [ ] and sr@xmath1rho@xmath69  [ ] , which host sharp spectral features at low energy , but rapidly develop substantial broadening away from @xmath37 . additionally , those systems host moderate correlation - induced enhancements of the effective mass .",
    "the lack of both of these features here points to a particularly weak influence of electron - electron interactions on the electronic structure of ptcoo@xmath1 .",
    "this is not the situation in all quasi two - dimensional @xmath0 transition - metal oxides . in the layered iridates , for example ,",
    "electronic correlations are still strong enough to drive a mott - like transition to an insulating state once structural distortions and strong spin - orbit coupling collectively narrow the electronic bandwidth  [ , , ] .",
    "in contrast , itineracy is preserved in ptcoo@xmath1 by the isolated single - band nature of the fermi surface . in the absence of band - folding arising from structural distortions , not present in ptcoo@xmath1",
    ", this band remains relatively unaffected by soc , while large hybridization gaps are only opened away from @xmath37 where band crossings between different orbital character states occur ( see , e.g. , around the t point in fig .  [ figdos](a ) where a @xmath70 degeneracy is lifted by approximately 600  mev ) .",
    "thus the bandwidth of the state crossing @xmath37 in ptcoo@xmath1 remains large , away from the narrow - band @xmath71 limit of the iridates .",
    "this naturally renders the electronic correlations expected of a @xmath0 system insufficient to drive a mott transition . nonetheless , the extremely good metallicity and lack of spectral broadening away from @xmath37 point not only to large bare bandwidths , but also to suppressed electron - electron interactions compared to other wide - band transition - metal oxides .",
    "indeed , the fact that the fermi velocities shown in fig .  [ f5](b ) are so close to the free electron values is itself remarkable , because the highly faceted fermi surface demonstrates the influence of the lattice potential on the states near @xmath37 .",
    "nonetheless , our measurements firmly establish ptcoo@xmath1 as a model half - filled nearly - free - electron oxide metal , with high - quality crystals rendering this system an ideal test - bed for future studies of the nature of electronic correlations and the origins of extremely good metallicity in both pt- and pd - based delafossite oxides .",

    "the mixed powder was then sealed in a quartz tube under a vacuum of @xmath75 torr .",

    "the inset highlights the two regions seen as a function of applied magnetic field , using data taken at 80  k as an example.,width=10 ]    the hall coefficient shown in the inset of fig . 2 of the main text were obtained from field sweeps performed at a number of temperatures are shown in fig .",
    "we assume that the hall effect in non - magnetic ptcoo@xmath1 or pdcoo@xmath1 has no anomalous component  [ 9 ] , and that the signal is dominated by the orbital hall effect .",
    "there is a clear , temperature - dependent separation into low- and high - field regimes with different gradients of the hall resistivity @xmath84 .",
    "below 20  k , the data are dominated by the high - field regime in which the fermi surface volume alone is expected to determine the value of the hall coefficient  [ 29 ] . the value in that region is approximately 2.9@xmath86  m@xmath32/c , close to the value that we measure for pdcoo@xmath1 under the same conditions ( data not shown ) , and within @xmath87 of the expectation for a single band containing one electron per pd . our measured mean - free path ( see main text ) enables us to make a quantitative estimate of @xmath88r@xmath89 = @xmath90@xmath91 at each temperature and field ( here the cyclotron radius @xmath92 = @xmath93@xmath94 , the cyclotron frequency @xmath95= @xmath96 = @xmath97@xmath93@xmath98 and @xmath99 = @xmath100@xmath101 where @xmath101 is the relaxation time ) . in fields of 9 t",
    ", we find @xmath88r@xmath89 @xmath102  5 at 15  k , which drops to @xmath88r@xmath89 = 0.1 at 300  k. this indicates , therefore , that the experiment goes well beyond the weak field regime by 9 t at low temperatures , but that weak - field physics applies at all fields at high temperatures .",
    "accordingly , we observe a cross - over from the low - field to the high - field regime ( @xmath88r@xmath89  @xmath103  1 ) at low temperatures , while at elevated temperatures fields in excess of 9 t are required to observe the high - field limit .",
    "we attribute this crossover between weak- and strong - field physics as the origin of two different gradients at intermediate temperatures ( see for example the inset to fig .  [ sf1 ] ) .",
    "the hall coefficient data shown in inset to fig . 2 of the main paper were obtained by fitting the gradient of @xmath84 between 7 and 9  t. this ensures that below approximately 50  k , r@xmath104 is obtained from data in the high filed limit that is more directly related to fermi surface volume that data from weak or intermediate fields .",
    "we attribute the temperature dependence seen above 50  k to the crossover to those less reliable regimes in which details of _ k_-dependent scattering strongly effect r@xmath104  [ 49 ] .",
    "supplemental fig .  [ sf2 ] shows the dependence of the calculated density of states on the coulomb repulsion @xmath66 in the co 3d shell and the oxygen position within the crystal structure . explicitly taking into account the strong coulomb repulsion @xmath66 suppresses unphysical hybridization of the co-@xmath64 states with the pt-@xmath0 states crossing the fermi level but otherwise has a minor influence on the dos in the vicinity of @xmath37 .",

    "varying the o - position ( 0,0,@xmath38 ) induces a shift of the energy of a hole band whose band top is slightly below @xmath37 , giving rise to a shift of a step in the density of states visible in the inset of fig .",
    "[ sf2](b ) . in the absence of spin - orbit interactions",
    ", this would cause the hole band to move above @xmath37 for pt - o distances at and above their calculated relaxed value ( @xmath105 ; the experimental value is z=0.114 ) causing a second fermi surface to appear .",
