    "<S> electrolysis of water is employed to produce surface nanobubbles on highly orientated pyrolytic graphite ( hopg ) surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> hydrogen ( oxygen ) nanobubbles are formed when the hopg surface acts as negative ( positive ) electrode . </S>",
    "<S> coverage and volume of the nanobubbles enhance with increasing voltage . </S>",
    "<S> the yield of hydrogen nanobubbles is much larger than the yield of oxygen nanobubbles . </S>",
    "<S> the growth of the individual nanobubbles during the electrolysis process is recorded in time with the help of afm measurements and correlated with the total current . </S>",
    "<S> both the size of the individual nanobubbles and the total current saturate after typical 1 minute ; then the nanobubbles are in a dynamic equilibrium , meaning that they do not further grow , in spite of ongoing gas production and nonzero current . </S>",
    "<S> the surface area of nanobubbles shows a good correlation with the nanobubble volume growth rate , suggesting that either the electrolytic gas emerges directly at the nanobubbles surface , or it emerges at the electrode s surface and then diffuses through the nanobubbles surface . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the experiments reveal that the time constants of the current and the aspect ratio of nanobubbles are the same under all conditions . </S>",
    "<S> replacement of pure water by water containing a small amount of sodium chloride ( @xmath0 m ) allows for larger currents , but qualitatively gives the same results .      </S>",
    "<S> _ nanobubbles _ , nanoscopic gas bubbles present at solid - liquid interfaces  @xcite , are in many ways fascinating objects in the field of surface science and nanofluidics . </S>",
    "<S> it has been conjectured that they are relevant for a number of phenomena and technical applications , e.g. , the liquid slippage at walls  @xcite , the stability of colloidal systems  @xcite , and the nanometer - scale attractive force between hydrophobic surfaces in solutions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> studies on various physical aspects of nanobubbles have been increasingly undertaken in the last few years  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the solid surfaces employed in these studies include gold  @xcite , polystyrene  @xcite , mica  @xcite , silane - hydrophobilized silicon wafer  @xcite , and highly orientated pyrolytic graphite ( hopg )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> most studies are done with highly purified water ( milli - q ) , though some experiments have been done with alcohol  @xcite or dilute sulfuric acid solution  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> atomic force microcopy ( afm ) in tapping mode is adopted in most experiments  @xcite , while other techniques such as rapid cryofixation - freeze fracture  @xcite , neutron reflectometry  @xcite , high - energy x - ray reflectivity  @xcite , and internal reflection infrared spectroscopy  @xcite have also been employed . </S>",
    "<S> experimental observations show that nanobubbles are very stable , having an extraordinary shape with remarkably large aspect ratio  @xcite which even further increases with decreasing nanobubble size  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the lifetime of nanobubbles shows a dependence on the gas type  @xcite . besides the surface hydrophobicity , the spatial dimensions of the hydrophobic domains on the surface are crucial for the formation of nanobubbles  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it has also been reported that the formation of nanobubbles is related to surface nanostructures : the majority of nanobubbles prefer to form in the vicinity of nanometer - deep grooves  @xcite or on the upper side of atomic steps  @xcite on the surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , an increase of substrate temperature , water temperature , or gas concentration in water increases the density and size of nanobubbles  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these observations clearly reveal that the formation of nanobubbles is very sensitive to surface and liquid conditions . </S>",
    "<S> yet , is there a simple method that leads to the controlled formation and growth of nanobubbles ?    in electrochemical reactions , </S>",
    "<S> gas molecules are generated at electrode surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> most studies have hitherto focused on mini- or micrometer sized bubbles , which are formed at and subsequently detach from the electrodes ; see  @xcite and references therein . </S>",
    "<S> the interest originates partly from the significant influence of the bubbles on reaction systems . </S>",
    "<S> e.g. , convection caused by the evolution of electrogenerated microbubbles increases electrolyte flow and can enhance production processes  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the interest in electrochemically generated nanobubbles is more recent . </S>",
    "<S> it has been hypothesized that the existence of nanobubbles at electrode surfaces favors the formation of submicrometer - sized vaterite tubes in the electrolysis - induced mineralization  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> zhang et al  @xcite confirmed that electrochemical generation of hydrogen induces the formation of nanobubbles on the electrode surface in sulfuric acid solution .    </S>",
    "<S> the work described in this article is motivated by two issues : ( i ) electrolysis of water is a reliable and controllable way to rapidly produce high local gas concentration at the electrode surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> gas concentration significantly affects the formation of nanobubbles  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> electrolysis of water therefore is an easy method to control the appearance and growth of surface nanobubbles . </S>",
    "<S> this is demonstrated in this article by performing afm measurements of nanobubbles on an hopg surface which acts as electrode . to reduce the effect of any possible impurities in the liquid , since nanobubbles are extremely sensitive to surfactants , ultraclean water ( see below for qualification ) is used as electrolyte . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , to test the reproducibility , an aqueous sodium chloride solution ( @xmath0 m ) is also used . </S>",
    "<S> we study the bubble coverage , volume , size , and aspect ratio at different voltages . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we show the real - time development of individual nanobubbles , before they finally achieve a dynamic equilibrium condition . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , the nanobubble s surface area and its volume growth are highly correlated , suggesting that either the electrolytic gas is produced at the whole surface of the nanobubbles , or it is generated at the electrode s surface and diffuses to the surface of nanobubbles . </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) the second issue of this article is to correlate geometric feature of the nanobubbles with the electric current that flows between the two electrodes . </S>",
    "<S> we find a good correlation between the aspect ratio of the nanobubbles and the current .      </S>",
    "<S> the water is prepared by a milli - q synthesis a10 system ( millipore sas , france ) and then degassed at 1 mbar for 4 hours . </S>",
    "<S> afm measurements are done with a picospm ( molecular imaging , az usa ) operated in tapping mode . </S>",
    "<S> excitation of the tip vibration is done acoustically , using a small piezo - element in the tip holder . </S>",
    "<S> the afm operating parameters in water are as follows : scanning speed @xmath1 ; free amplitude 400 mv ; set - point amplitude 300 mv ; resonance frequency 20 khz . </S>",
    "<S> afm scanning is performed by a hydrophilic @xmath2 ultra - sharp afm tip ( radius of curvature @xmath3 @xmath4 , full tip cone angle @xmath3 @xmath5 , nsc18/albs , mikromasch , france ; rinsed with ethanol and pure water before use ) . an hopg sample ( hopg zyb/@xmath6 , size @xmath7 , mikromasch , france ) with a freshly cleaved surface placed on a copper plate </S>",
    "<S> is used as nanobubble forming surface and at the same time as one of the electrodes . </S>",
    "<S> a platinum wire ( diameter @xmath8 mm ) placed next to the afm cantilever is used as the other electrode . </S>",
    "<S> the copper plate and the platinum wire are connected to an electrometer ( picoammeter / voltage source 6478 , keithley instruments inc . </S>",
    "<S> , oh usa ) . </S>",
    "<S> after a water drop ( volume @xmath9 ml - @xmath10 ml ) is placed on the hopg surface and the desired voltage is imposed , afm scanning process is started immediately . </S>",
    "<S> figure 1 shows a sketch of the setup . </S>",
    "<S> when the hopg sample acts as the negative electrode ( cathode ) , the reduction process of water leads to the formation of hydrogen molecules on the hopg surface , @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> oxygen molecules are produced on the hopg surface when the hopg sample is switched to be the positive electrode ( anode ) and therefore the oxidation process of water on the surface leads to oxygen molecules , @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> the experiments are carried out in a standard lab environment with a temperature between 20 and @xmath13 @xmath14c . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature change of the hopg sample during the measurements is less than @xmath15 k.        previous experimental results show that no nanobubbles are formed on hopg surfaces unless the so - called ethanol - water - exchange step is carried out  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the hydrophilic nature of the surface ( macroscopic contact angle @xmath16 ) that disfavors the attachment of surface bubbles . </S>",
    "<S> electrolysis of water can be a robust method for a sufficient yield of nanobubbles on hopg  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> afm measurements by tapping mode are performed on the hopg surface .    </S>",
    "<S> figure 2 shows the topography images of the hopg surface used as cathode with different applied voltages : ( a ) @xmath17 , ( b ) @xmath18 , ( c ) @xmath19 , ( d ) @xmath20 , ( e ) @xmath21 , ( f ) @xmath22 , ( g ) @xmath23 , ( h ) @xmath24 ; the height range for each image is ( a - b ) @xmath25 , ( c - e ) @xmath26 , ( f ) @xmath27 , and ( g - h ) @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> the images are recorded continuously from ( a ) to ( h ) , with a scanning time of @xmath29 per image . </S>",
    "<S> nanobubbles ( hydrogen ) form with varying density at different voltages . </S>",
    "<S> the atomic steps of hopg are visible when the nanobubble coverage is low and thus act as a good reference position at the nanoscale when conducting afm measurements . </S>",
    "<S> the formation of nanobubbles increases tremendously when increasing the voltage from @xmath30 to @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> figure 2 ( e ) reveals that the nanobubbles remain stable even when the voltage has been switched off from @xmath31 ( d ) . </S>",
    "<S> this demonstrates the robust stability of nanobubbles , which is similar to the previous finding that the heating - water - generated nanobubbles do not disappear when the water is cooled down  @xcite . at the higher voltages , nanobubbles </S>",
    "<S> cover the entire surface with much larger individual sizes , see figure 2 ( f - h ) . </S>",
    "<S> growth and detachment of nanobubbles are observed under the higher electric potentials ; the examples are marked by arrows in the images . </S>",
    "<S> the dependence of nanobubble coverage and volume on the applied voltage is respectively depicted in figure 2 ( i ) and ( j ) ( error bar @xmath32 5% ) . with increasing voltage , </S>",
    "<S> more hydrogen molecules are produced at the cathode ( hopg surface ) , enhancing the local gas concentration . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to an increase in the coverage and volume of the nanobubbles , as revealed by plot ( i ) and ( j ) in figure 2 . at high voltages , i.e. , @xmath33 or 5 v , microbubbles developing at the hopg surface </S>",
    "<S> can already be monitored by an optical camera . </S>",
    "<S> the evolution of these microbubbles ruins the afm scanning process by interfering with the vibrating afm cantilever .    </S>",
    "<S> afm topography images of hopg surface used as anode are shown in figure 3 . </S>",
    "<S> different voltages are applied : ( a ) @xmath17 , ( b ) @xmath18 , ( c ) @xmath19 , ( d ) @xmath20 , ( e ) @xmath34 , ( f ) @xmath23 , ( g ) @xmath24 ( height range : ( a ) @xmath35 , ( b - g ) @xmath36 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the scanning time of each image is @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> the images are taken in succession from ( a ) to ( g ) without any delay . </S>",
    "<S> oxygen nanobubbles form on the surface . </S>",
    "<S> comparing to the hydrogen case in figure 2 , the production of nanobubbles in figure 3 is much smaller . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that this is due to the considerable difference in the solubility of oxygen and hydrogen in water ( at 20 @xmath14c the solubility of oxygen is @xmath37 times higher than that of hydrogen ) , as well as to the different production rate during the electrolysis , @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> the nanobubble coverage and volume are plotted as functions of the applied voltage , respectively , in figure 3 ( h ) and ( i ) ( error bar @xmath32 5% ) . for </S>",
    "<S> both hydrogen and oxygen , the plots in figure 2 ( i - j ) and 3 ( h - i ) reveal a threshold and saturation of the nanobubble formation in dependence of the applied voltage .    </S>",
    "<S> the coverage and volume values presented in figure 2 ( i - j ) and 3 ( h - i ) are calculated by setting an appropriate hight threshold @xmath39 to extract nanobubbles . </S>",
    "<S> this is illustrated by the example in figure 4 . </S>",
    "<S> afm ( tapping mode ) topography images ( height range @xmath40 ) of hydrogen surface nanobubbles are shown with different thresholds @xmath39 applied for the identification of surface nanobubbles : ( a ) @xmath39=0 nm , ( b ) @xmath39=6 nm , ( c ) @xmath39=7 nm , ( d ) @xmath39=8 nm , ( e ) @xmath39=9 nm , ( f ) @xmath39=10 nm , and ( g ) @xmath39=14 nm . the principle is sketched in figure 4 ( h ) . </S>",
    "<S> areas below the threshold are represented as blue , whereas areas above are shown as yellowish depending on the height . </S>",
    "<S> the fraction of the latter area is shown in figure 4 ( i ) as function of the threshold @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> the curve shows a pronounced shape . </S>",
    "<S> we take the value at the end of the straight shape region ( marked by an arrow ) , where @xmath39=9 nm presenting a nanobubble identification as shown in image ( e ) , as estimate for the nanobubble coverage and volume statistics .      during the experiments , </S>",
    "<S> each chosen voltage is continuously applied while performing the afm measurements shown in figure 2 and 3 . </S>",
    "<S> the constant voltage results in continuous charge flux through the system . </S>",
    "<S> under such a condition , one may expect that surface nanobubbles would constantly accumulate on the electrode surfaces . however , our afm images ( figure 2 and 3 ) , taken after a certain transient time , show stationary nanobubbles of certain sizes . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , electrolytically generated nanobubbles experience a saturation in their development .    </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that the nanobubbles are in a _ dynamic equilibrium _ state . </S>",
    "<S> there are gas - flows into and out of the nanobubbles simultaneously , which balance each other allowing for a constant volume . </S>",
    "<S> when the inflow overwhelms the outflow , nanobubbles start to grow . </S>",
    "<S> this happens when the voltage is increased , producing more charges and leading to a larger gas flow into the nanobubbles , thus breaking the previous balance between the inflow and the outflow , and consequently causing the nanobubbles to grow . </S>",
    "<S> as the nanobubbles grow , the outflow starts to increase till it reaches a new equilibrium state with the inflow . </S>",
    "<S> the nanobubbles then again remain in a stable condition .    in order to quantify the growing process of the nanobubbles </S>",
    "<S> , we focus on a number of individual nanobubbles and measure the evolution of various geometric properties such as width , height , aspect ratio , etc . </S>",
    "<S> in addition and in parallel , we measure the global current as function of time ( shown in the following sections ) . </S>",
    "<S> the electric current decays as the nanobubbles grow . </S>",
    "<S> this decrease in current , which reduces the amount of gas produced on the surface , effectively decreases the inflow to the nanobubbles . </S>",
    "<S> this of course helps to reach a new dynamic equilibrium state , but we stress again that the current is nonzero in the saturated state . the data of the current as function of time and the nanobubble development show saturation on the same time scale . </S>",
    "<S> at the saturated state , the nanobubble growth terminates , whereas the saturated current is nonzero . </S>",
    "<S> this observation clearly suggests the existence of a _ dynamic equilibrium _ of the nanobubbles .      </S>",
    "<S> the appearance of nanobubbles can easily be controlled by an increase of the voltage , as revealed in figure 2 and 3 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we can capture the dynamics of the nanobubble growth by operating the afm tip to repeatedly scan along a fixed straight line on the surface over the time of the electrolysis . with this method </S>",
    "<S> we perspicuously quantify the evolution of the nanobubbles at the moment of increasing voltage . </S>",
    "<S> the measurements are shown in figure 5 .    during the experiment </S>",
    "<S> , we first start the afm scan over one line on the hopg surface , and then we apply the desired voltage to generate surface nanobubbles - meanwhile the afm scan is continuously running . </S>",
    "<S> the time when we apply the voltage is taken as 0 . </S>",
    "<S> each afm line - scan takes 1 sec ; the profile of the developing nanobubble is continuously recorded . </S>",
    "<S> figure 5 ( a ) presents the profiles of a nanobubble generated with 1 v and the adjacent substrate surface ( hopg , as cathode ) at different time with interval of 10 sec . </S>",
    "<S> plot ( b ) exhibits the dynamics of another nanobubble generated at 2 v. it is clearly shown that the nanobubbles start to grow continuously immediately after their appearance on the surface ; this is also demonstrated by the nanobubble area @xmath41 time plots in figure 6 and 7 . </S>",
    "<S> note that the growth terminates after 70 sec for plot ( a ) and after 40 sec for plot ( b ) in figure 5 . </S>",
    "<S> the nanobubbles then remain stable , although the voltage is still applied and the current is nonzero . </S>",
    "<S> the stabilized nanobubble in figure 5 ( a ) is approximately 200 nm in width and 5 nm in height . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the measurements show that the nanobubbles grow with a faster rate in height than in width . </S>",
    "<S> the good agreement in the topography among the profiles of the adjacent hopg surface at different times reveals that the afm measuring is not considerably perturbed by the electrolysis process or the emergence of the nanobubbles , the profiles of the nanobubble therefore can be compared .    from the nanobubble profiles recorded by the afm scan </S>",
    "<S> , we extract the width and height values of the nanobubbles at different times . </S>",
    "<S> note that the afm scan does not necessarily cross the center ( the maximum width and height ) of each nanobubble . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the extracted width and height values may be lower than the maximum values . by assuming the shape of nanobubbles as a spherical cap </S>",
    "<S> , we estimate the surface area of a nanobubble as @xmath42@xmath43 using the extracted width @xmath44 . in a corresponding way we estimate the volume growth rate of a nanobubble , which as well as the surface area is then plotted as a function of time , shown in figure 6 ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively . exponential fits ( red lines ) </S>",
    "<S> are applied to both plots and values of the time constant @xmath45 are extracted . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath45 values of the area and volume growth rate are plotted versus voltage in figure 6 ( c ) . </S>",
    "<S> the plot shows that nanobubble area and volume growth rate have a good correlation at all four voltages . </S>",
    "<S> this result suggests that the electrolytically generated gas is produced on the whole surface of the nanobubbles , implying that the whole surface of the nanobubbles is electrically charged . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , the electrolytically generated gas could be produced on the electrode surface ( hopg ) and subsequently diffuse through the surface of the nanobubbles .      </S>",
    "<S> the global current of the electrolysis system is recorded as a function of time with a sampling rate @xmath46 sec and an integration time @xmath47 sec . to test the reproducibility , two hopg samples and three freshly cleaved surfaces on each sample </S>",
    "<S> are analyzed ( as cathode ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus current measurements are done on six different hopg surfaces at each voltage . </S>",
    "<S> all these results show that the current vs. time curves present an exponential decay at voltages below 3 v. at higher voltages , the current fluctuates strongly . </S>",
    "<S> the reason is that more and bigger bubbles are formed at higher voltages . </S>",
    "<S> growth and detachment of the bubbles cause the current to fluctuate . </S>",
    "<S> this is in the agreement with the observations in figure 2 and refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> as described in the previous section , we extract the width and height values of nanobubbles at different times , based on the afm - recorded profiles of the nanobubbles . </S>",
    "<S> we here estimate the nanobubble area and aspect ratio ( width over height ) , which are then plotted as a function of time . in figure 7 </S>",
    "<S> , graphs show the dynamics of current , nanobubble area , and nanobubble aspect ratio within the first 60 sec at ( a ) 1 v , ( b ) @xmath30 v , ( c ) 2 v , and ( d ) @xmath48 v. these three quantities are recorded simultaneously at each voltage . the nanobubble development and the current decay </S>",
    "<S> are strongly correlated . in figure 7 </S>",
    "<S> ( a ) , as an example , the nanobubble expands rapidly in the first 20 sec , from 20 to 50 sec it grows less quickly , thereafter it reaches a stable state , as revealed by the area vs. time plot ( red square ) ; the current decay behaves in a correlated way on the same timescale ( black dot ) . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , along with the current decay , the nanobubble aspect ratio ( green triangle ) decreases too . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that nanobubbles occur initially in an ultrathin - film form with a large aspect ratio , and then accumulate with a higher growth rate in vertical as compared to horizontal direction . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with the observation in figure 5 .    </S>",
    "<S> the gas produced at the electrode surface depends on the electric charge passing from one electrode to the other . </S>",
    "<S> figure 7 shows that the global current reaches an equilibrium state as soon as the nanobubble development terminates . </S>",
    "<S> the amount of the excess electric charge above the equilibrium state within time ( 60 sec ) is estimated for voltage 1 , @xmath30 , 2 , and @xmath48 v , respectively . the amount is plotted against the nanobubble coverage and volume at each voltage , as shown in figure 8 ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the red lines are linear fits . </S>",
    "<S> note that the fits are a guide to eyes , not necessarily suggesting that both coverage and volume of the nanobubbles have a linear relation with the charge . </S>",
    "<S> one can see that the amount of nanobubbles produced increases as the amount of excess electric charge increases , showing the contribution of the gas yielded by electrolysis to the nanobubble formation . </S>",
    "<S> note the offset of the fits : in spite of the nonzero charge there is no nanobubble production ( zero nanobubble coverage and volume ) . </S>",
    "<S> the offset indicates that part of the electrolytically generated gas dissolves , not contributing to the formation of nanobubbles . </S>",
    "<S> this crucial charge may also be needed to build up a dielectric layer at the electrode . </S>",
    "<S> zhang @xmath49 @xmath50 reported similar observation that a formation time for nanobubbles is required and it decreases when the applied voltage increases  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> for further analysis of the time scales of the current and the nanobubble growth , the current , the nanobubble area , and the aspect ratio plots are fitted with an exponential . </S>",
    "<S> examples are shown in figure 9 ( a - c ) . </S>",
    "<S> red curves are the fits to the data ( blue dots ) , from which the time constants @xmath45 are extracted . </S>",
    "<S> the values of @xmath45 are presented as a function of voltage for area ( error @xmath32 17% ) and current ( error @xmath32 13% ) in figure 9 ( d ) , and for aspect ratio ( error @xmath32 16% ) and current in figure 9 ( e ) . </S>",
    "<S> first , we note that the @xmath45 s decrease with increasing voltage , indicating that the development of nanobubbles and the decay of current take place more rapidly at higher voltage . </S>",
    "<S> one can moreover see that the @xmath45 values of area and current : ( i ) agree well at @xmath51 and @xmath48 v when the nanobubble coverage is high ; hence the nanobubble growth leads to a decrease of the current in the system ; ( ii ) deviate at 1 and @xmath30 v , when the nanobubble coverage is rather low . </S>",
    "<S> we stress that the current is a global parameter , whereas the area of individual nanobubbles is a local parameter . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the nanobubble aspect ratio and the current are perfectly correlated , as shown in figures 7 and 9 ( e ) . </S>",
    "<S> we do not have an explanation for this finding . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the aspect ratio presumably exhibits a universal way of nanobubble development . </S>",
    "<S> therefore it might be a global feature .      to study the robustness of our observations , in addition to pure water an aqueous sodium chloride ( nacl ) solution ( @xmath0 m ) </S>",
    "<S> was used as electrolyte . using the same experimental setup </S>",
    "<S> as described in figure 1 , the nacl solution is deposited on the hopg surface acting as the negative electrode ( cathode ) . with no applied voltage , </S>",
    "<S> no nanobubbles are formed . </S>",
    "<S> when the voltage is imposed , the formation of hydrogen nanobubbles starts to become observable . </S>",
    "<S> the voltage is varied as @xmath8 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 v. a small amount of nanobubbles are already formed at @xmath8 v. the nanobubble formation increases tremendously as the voltage is switched from @xmath52 to @xmath53 v. this is similar to the result shown in figure 2 where the formation of nanobubbles jumps from @xmath30 to 2 v. the formation of nanobubbles in nacl solution starts to show a saturation after @xmath53 v. the dependence of nanobubble coverage and volume upon the applied voltage is depicted in figure 10 ( a ) and ( b ) ( error bar @xmath32 5% ) , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> when the voltage is higher than @xmath55 v , afm imaging is disturbed by bigger bubbles developing or detaching from the surface . </S>",
    "<S> the formation of nanobubbles in the nacl solution is similar to that in pure water , except that because of the reduced resistance due to the dissolved salt , the effective voltage is reduced by a factor of about 3 : 2 v for the pure water and @xmath56 v for the nacl solution . </S>",
    "<S> note that the volume and coverage of nanobubbles at the effective voltages in the two cases are comparable .    </S>",
    "<S> the time evolution of nanobubbles at @xmath8 v in the nacl solution is shown in figure 11 . </S>",
    "<S> the nanobubbles continuously develop on the surface till 40 sec and then remain stable , as revealed in figure 11 ( a ) . as in the experiment shown in figure 7 , the global current of the electrolysis system , the nanobubble surface area , and the aspect ratio </S>",
    "<S> are measured simultaneously as a function of time within the first 60 sec , as shown in figure 11 ( b ) . a good correlation between the current decay and the nanobubble development </S>",
    "<S> is found - this is the same observation as with pure water . </S>",
    "<S> the aspect ratio also shows a comparable correlation with the current . </S>",
    "<S> the experiments with the nacl solution reproduce our findings concerning the nanobubbles in dynamic equilibrium . again </S>",
    "<S> , good correlations between global current decay and bubble growth dynamics are found .      </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that the electrolysis of water is a reliable method to produce both hydrogen ( at cathode ) and oxygen ( at anode ) surface nanobubbles . </S>",
    "<S> coverage and volume of the nanobubbles grow substantially with increasing voltage . </S>",
    "<S> the yield of hydrogen nanobubbles is much higher than that of oxygen nanobubbles . </S>",
    "<S> our results of nanobubble evolution have shown that nanobubbles occur initially in an ultrathin - film with a large aspect ratio , and subsequently grow with a higher rate in vertical rather than in horizontal direction . in spite of the continuously applied voltage and a nonzero current , the growth of the nanobubbles terminates after a typical time , showing that electrolytically generated nanobubbles are in a dynamic equilibrium condition . </S>",
    "<S> we note that also the spontaneously forming nanobubbles ( i.e. , without electrolysis ) might be in a dynamics equilibrium , in which the gas outflux through the laplace pressure is compensated by a gas influx at the contact line , as has recently been speculated in reference  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we have found a correlation between the surface area and the volume growth rate of nanobubbles , suggesting possible ways how electrolytic gas emerges on the surface . </S>",
    "<S> the global current as function of time is strongly correlated with the bubble aspect ratio . </S>",
    "<S> the experiments with an aqueous sodium chloride solution ( @xmath0 m ) give similar results .    </S>",
