    "the emergence of collective dynamics in networks of coupled oscillatory units is a fascinating phenomenon observed in science and technology  @xcite .",

    "such dynamical systems with symmetry are equivariant with respect to the action of a group  @xcite , that is , the vector field commutes with the group action on phase space .",
    "equivariance implies that any solution of the system is mapped to another solution by the action of the symmetry group and it typically constrains the dynamics , for example by giving rise to dynamically invariant subspaces .",
    "the solutions themselves may ( but do not have to ) have nontrivial symmetry , that is , there may be nontrivial elements elements of the symmetry group that keep the solution fixed , either pointwise or as a set .",
    "for example , for globally coupled identical oscillators the solution corresponding to full synchrony , where the states of all oscillators are equal , has full symmetry itself .",
    "of course , there may be other solution with less symmetry relative to the symmetries of the system .",
    "recently , the observation `` symmetry breaking '' in symmetrically coupled phase oscillator systems , i.e. , the observation of solutions with localized synchronous dynamics coexisting with localized incoherence , has sparked a lot of interest . such solutions , commonly known as chimera states",
    "see  @xcite for a recent review  were first observed in symmetric rings of coupled phase oscillators  @xcite . in the limit of infinitely many oscillators , they correspond to stationary or periodic patterns of the phase density distribution  @xcite . by contrast , it was not until recently that ashwin and burylko  @xcite gave a testable mathematical definition for chimera states , a _ weak chimera _ , for networks of finitely many phase oscillators",
    "whose phases @xmath0 evolve according to @xmath1 here the  @xmath2 determine the network topology ( respecting a subgroup  @xmath3 of the group  @xmath4 of permutations of  @xmath5 symbols acting transitively on the indices of the oscillators ) and  @xmath6 is the generalized coupling ( or phase interaction ) function .",
    "weak chimeras are defined in terms of partial angular frequency synchronization on trajectories .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath7 is a continuous lift of a solution  @xmath8 of   with initial condition @xmath9 to  @xmath10 define the asymptotic angular frequency of oscillator  @xmath11 as @xmath12 according to  @xcite , a compact , connected , chain - recurrent , and dynamically invariant set  @xmath13 is a weak chimera if there are distinct oscillators @xmath14 such that @xmath15 for all @xmath16 .",

    "that is , @xmath22 is a symmetry of the angular frequency vector  @xmath23 . while weak chimeras have provided a suitable framework to derive for example existence results  @xcite , there are two shortcomings . first ,",
    "while chimera states have also been reported in more general oscillator models  @xcite the definition above applies to phase oscillators only .",
    "second , the symmetries of the angular frequency vector  @xmath24 may be different from the symmetries of the system . as a consequence ,",
    "if  @xmath18 is a weak chimera then  @xmath25 may not be a weak chimera or even a solution of the system at all .",
    "interestingly , while it has been argued that chimera states are relevant due to their nature of solutions with broken symmetry  @xcite , their properties have never been phrased in terms of symmetries of the dynamical system .",
    "the contribution of this paper is twofold : first , we give a definition of a weak chimera in the language of equivariant dynamical systems and , second , we show that symmetries of the solution are not necessary for the occurrence of weak chimeras .",
    "more precisely , we define weak chimeras in terms of the isotropy of the angular frequency vector which can be stated for more general oscillator systems .",
    "we observe that , in a suitable setup , asymptotic angular frequencies are averages of equivariant observables .",
    "therefore , symmetries of solutions translate directly into symmetries of the angular frequencies .",
    "thus , the presence of symmetries of solutions facilitates the emergence of weak chimeras and , in fact , most weak chimeras that have been constructed explicitly  @xcite are solutions with ( instantaneous ) symmetries .",
    "is it possible to explicitly construct weak chimeras without instantaneous or setwise symmetries for which the angular frequencies have symmetries that are not a property of the solution itself ?",
    "this question motivates the second contribution . extending recent persistence results  @xcite",
    "that rely on constructing generalized coupling functions between oscillators , we prove a persistence result for weak chimeras with trivial symmetry in weakly coupled populations of phase oscillators . moreover , we present an explicit example of a @xmath26 coupling function that gives rise to a chaotic weak chimera without instantaneous or setwise symmetries in a nontrivially coupled system .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : prelims ]",
    "we review some terminology on equivariant dynamics that is needed in the subsequent sections . in section  [ sec : weakchimeras ] we then apply these notions to general oscillator systems with symmetry which yields a new definition of a weak chimera in terms of symmetries of the angular frequency vector .",
    "as we show in section  [ sec : weakchimerasphaseosc ] this definition is compatible with previous definitions . in section  [ sec : weakchimnosym ] we prove a persistence result for weak chimeras without instantaneous or average symmetries .",

    "this observation yields a natural reformulation of the notion of a weak chimera in terms of the isotropy of the vector of asymptotic angular frequencies .",
    "our definition is not only compatible with the action of  @xmath3 but also goes beyond coupled phase oscillators in the weak coupling limit : it applies to more general oscillator models where chimera states have been reported  @xcite . with a rigorous definition in place , it would be desirable to prove the existence of weak chimeras in such systems and show that the dynamics observed are persistent phenomena .",
    "these ideas equally apply to more general spaces  @xmath27 with a symmetry group acting on it ; here asymptotic winding numbers of asymptotic cycles describe the rotation of a trajectory with respect to topological properties of  @xmath27  @xcite .",
    "precisifying the notion of a weak chimera for general topological spaces  @xmath27 with symmetry is beyond the scope of the current paper and will be addressed in future work .    using coupling functions that give rise to relative equilibria with trivial symmetry",
    ", we showed that for symmetric phase oscillator systems that there are indeed weak chimeras that have symmetries in the frequencies that are not present in the solutions .",
    "this motivates some further symmetry related questions . for example , what are the possible isotropy groups of the angular frequency vector for a @xmath36-equivariant system that do not arise from the symmetries of the solutions themselves ?",
    "( these are obviously restricted to subgroups of the symmetry group . )",
    "which symmetry increasing bifurcations happen as the inter - population coupling  @xmath334 is increased ( figure  [ fig : lyapscan ] ) ?",
    "while chaotic dynamics do persist up to @xmath396 ( and for other choices of coupling function even up to @xmath397  @xcite ) , chaotic weak chimeras with trivial symmetry only persist for values of  @xmath334 close to zero .",
    "thus , are there chaotic weak chimeras with trivial symmetry for `` strongly coupled '' populations of phase oscillators ? moreover , in general there will be more than one ergodic invariant measure supported on a weak chimera .",
    "for each of these measures we obtain asymptotic angular frequency vectors that potentially have different isotropy . while the set of all measures supported on the invariant set of interest  @xcite yields bounds of the asymptotic angular frequencies ( see also  @xcite ) , a more detailed understanding what the specific isotropy subgroups for the invariant measures are and how they bifurcate would be desirable .",
    "it is also worth noting that asymptotic angular frequencies as averages and their isotropy may still be well be defined if the permutational symmetry of the system is broken due to a ( small ) perturbation .",
    "however , care has to be taken to extend the notion of a weak chimera to nearly symmetric systems since symmetry breaking can have drastic effects on frequency synchronization  @xcite .",
    "`` classical '' chimera states were first observed on rings of nonlocally coupled phase oscillators  @xcite .",
    "a finite - dimensional approximation yields a dynamical system that is equivariant with respect to the action of the dihedral group  @xcite . roughly speaking ,",
    "classical chimeras on finite dimensional rings are trajectories that show characteristic angular frequency synchronization for some finite time as they exhibit pseudo - random drift along the ring before converging to the fully synchronized state  @xcite .",
    "these are not weak chimeras in the sense defined above .",
    "by contrast , initial conditions in the ( dynamically invariant ) fixed point spaces of a reflection symmetry yield symmetric solutions that eventually converge to the fully synchronized state  @xcite , resembling a transient weak chimera .",
    "interestingly , the chaotic weak chimeras constructed here share an important feature with these `` classical '' chimera states : the isotropy of the angular frequency vector may be larger than the symmetry of the solution itself as the oscillators in the `` coherent '' region are never perfectly phase synchronized .",
    "thus , clarifying the relationship between classical chimera states on rings and the symmetry of the system further  also with respect to the symmetries of the system that describes the continuum limit ",
