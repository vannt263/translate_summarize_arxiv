    "within our own galaxy , there are three well defined sources of diffuse cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) foreground continuum emission , namely , synchrotron and free  free emission , which dominate at frequencies below @xmath0  60  ghz , and thermal ( vibrational ) dust emission , which dominates at higher frequencies .",
    "however , there is increasing evidence supporting the existence of a new continuum emission mechanism in the frequency range @xmath0  10    60  ghz  ( * ? ? ?",

    "various theories have been proposed to explain this `` anomalous '' emission , including magnetic dipole emission  @xcite , hard , flat spectrum , synchrotron emission  @xcite and bremsstrahlung from very hot ( t@xmath3  @xmath4  10@xmath5  k ) , shock heated gas  @xcite . however , the currently favoured emission mechanism is that of very small ( n  @xmath6  10@xmath7 atoms ) , rapidly rotating ( @xmath4  1.5x10@xmath8 s@xmath9 ) dust grains , emitting electric dipole radiation , commonly referred to as `` spinning dust ''  @xcite .",
    "fulleranes have also been proposed as the source of anomalous emission  @xcite .",
    "this anomalous emission has been detected on large angular scales across substantial areas of the sky ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and also on small angular scales in specific galactic objects , such as ldn  1622 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , g159.618.5 ( @xcite ) , rcw  175 ( @xcite ) , ldn  1111 ( @xcite ) and a number of lynds dark nebulae ( @xcite ) and is often found to be tightly correlated with the far - infrared ( fir ) emission .",
    "the fir emission is generally interpreted as due to three dust components : big grains ( bgs ) , very small grains ( vsgs ) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) , deduced from iras observations  @xcite .",
    "one of these galactic objects , g159.618.5 , is located within the perseus molecular complex .",
    "observations performed with the cosmosomas experiment  @xcite identified a bright source of dust - correlated emission at  @xmath0  20    30  ghz , with a peaked spectrum , indicative of spinning dust .",
    "this is perhaps the best example of spinning dust emission where the peaked spectrum is well fitted by a  @xcite spinning dust model .",
    "these results prompted further investigations of this region , which were performed with the very small array ( vsa ) , a 14-element interferometric array operating at 33  ghz ;  @xcite give the nominal vsa setup .",
    "in the present paper we present and discuss our results from these new observations . section  [ sec : obs ] describes the region under investigation and presents the vsa observations , while section  [ sec : data ] details the data reduction . section  [ sec : ancillary ] discusses the available ancillary data , which were used to help gain a better understanding of the physical conditions within the region . in section",
    "[ sec : seds ] we produce spectral energy distributions ( seds ) for 5 features in the region . in section  [ sec : discuss ] we analyse these seds , investigate the correlation between the microwave and ir emission , and analyse the relationship between our vsa results and the cosmosomas results  @xcite .",

    "the dust emissivity for the 5 features analysed in this work are consistent with this value . comparing the dust emissivities listed in table  [ table : emiss ]",
    ", we find that the features a2 , a3 , b and c have a dust emissivity similar to the typical value found for high galactic latitudes , while feature a1 , with a much lower dust emissivity , is similar to that for hii regions",
    ".    the lower dust emissivity per unit of 100  @xmath10 m surface brightness in hii regions ( see table  [ table : emiss ] ) may be the result of the relative difference in physical environmental conditions compared with those in the general ism .",
    "for example , the warmer dust resulting from the strong uv radiation field in an hii region will emit more strongly at 100  @xmath10 m , thereby reducing the radio to fir emissivity ratio for a given amount of dust .",
    "also the more energetic radiation field may disassociate the vsgs / pahs responsible for the spinning dust emission .",
    "feature a1 , associated with ic  348 , has an emissivity similar to an hii region although no hii region with a flux density greater than 5  mjy at radio frequencies is seen with the vsa at the position of ic348 .",
    "nevertheless , there is a significant uv radiation field arising from the low mass stars comprising the open cluster in the ic348 reflection nebulosity and there may additionally be some uv illumination from the nearby perseus  ob2 association .",
    "the overall radiation field in ic  348 is 10  ",
    "100 times that of the general ism  @xcite .",
    "the higher dust temperature ( t@xmath11  @xmath0  40  k ) compared with that ( t@xmath11  @xmath0  30  k ) in the cooler features confirms the presence of this higher radiation field in the a1 region .",
    "the lack of a detectable hii region indicates a less intense radiation field or a lower gas density than in a normal hii region .    ignoring feature a1 , with its lower dust emissivity , the mean dust emissivity for features a2 , a3 , b and c  ( 13.8  @xmath12  2.2 ) is consistent with the integrated value calculated for the whole region by  @xcite .",
    "these comparisons of dust emissivity confirm that our detection of excess emission is in agreement with previous observations , and can be explained in terms of spinning dust .",
    "m wavebands ( dash - dot - dot line ) are plotted .",
    "both fits show a significant non zero gradient , at a 2.5@xmath13 and 3.8@xmath13 level respectively , with the correlation increasing as the wavelength decreases .",
    "1@xmath13 errorbars are plotted . ]      a visual comparison of the _ iris _ images overlaid with the vsa contours in fig .",
    "[ fig : iris_image ] suggests a possible correlation between the microwave and ir emission .",
    "a pearson correlation analysis was performed , and fig .",
    "[ fig : correlation ] illustrates how good the overall correlation is  ( @xmath0  0.8 ) , and displays the calculated pearson correlation coefficient as a function of _ iris _ wavelength .",
    "the plotted error bars are  1@xmath13 , and were determined using the fisher z@xmath2 transformation , which converts the non - normal pearson sampling distribution to a normal distribution with standard errors",
    ".    also plotted on fig .",
    "[ fig : correlation ] are 2 fits : one fit applied to all 4 _ iris _ wavelengths  ( 12 , 25 , 60 and 100  @xmath10 m ) , and one fit applied to only 3 of the _ iris _ wavelengths  ( 25 , 60 and 100  @xmath10 m ) . both fits display a non - zero gradient at a 2.5@xmath13 level and a 3.8@xmath13 level respectively .",
    "this implies that the correlation between the microwave and the ir increases as the wavelength decreases .",
    "the shorter ir wavelengths are known to be due to emission from the smallest dust grains ( vsgs and pahs ) , and hence the fact that the correlation is stronger with shorter wavelengths reinforces the hypothesis of this anomalous emission being caused by spinning dust .",
    "this correlation analysis was performed across 4 of the 5 features in the vsa image ( a2 , a3 , b and c ) .",
    "feature a1 was excluded because it has different physical conditions compared to the other 4 features as shown in section  [ sec : emiss ] and table  [ table : emiss ] . when feature a1 is excluded from the correlation analysis , the overall correlation coefficient increases by  @xmath0  4  % .",
    "the 12  @xmath10 m data point in fig .",
    "[ fig : correlation ] appears to be low , however we must remember that although the _ iris _ data are an improved version of the original _ iras _ data , there is still some substantial `` contamination '' from point sources in these images .",
    "these point sources would be expected to dominate at the shorter wavelengths and hence this could explain the apparent decrease in correlation at 12  @xmath10 m .",
    "further investigation using data from the _ spitzer space telescope _ will be performed in a follow - up paper .",
    "this should clear up our understanding of whether the point source contamination is responsible for the apparent peak at 25  @xmath10 m .",
    "g159.618.5 was observed by  @xcite with the cosmosomas experiment on angular scales of  @xmath0  1@xmath14 , and hence could not resolve any of the 5 individual features observed with the vsa in this present work . using both results allow us to investigate how the anomalous emission varies with angular scale .",
    "the total _ wmap _",
    "flux density measured by  @xcite was 40.3  @xmath12  0.4  jy at 33  ghz , and the total flux density in the 5 features in the vsa map was found to be 4.4  @xmath12  0.4  jy  ( table  [ table : flux ] ) .",
    "this implies that the vsa is only observing a small fraction ( @xmath0  10  % ) of the anomalous emission observed by cosmosomas , and that the bulk of the anomalous emission is originating from some large scale structure that is being resolved out by the vsa , due to the short - spacing problem .",
    "this idea also explains why the integrated flux density in the filtered vsa image , 0.96  @xmath12  0.12  jy  ( table  [ table : gb6 ] ) is much lower than the flux density in the unfiltered vsa image .",
    "therefore , the features observed by the vsa must be `` peaks '' of anomalous emission , located on a large scale , diffuse cloud responsible for the  33  ghz emission in__wmap__.",
    "observations of g159.618.5 with the vsa in its super - extended array configuration with a synthesized beam of  @xmath0  7@xmath2 fwhm provide clear evidence for excess emission at 33  ghz in 5 distinct dust - correlated components .",
    "this anomalous emission can not be explained by either free  free or thermal dust emission , and as such produces a peaked spectrum .",
    "after ruling out both uchii regions and gps by observations of ancillary data , and magnetic dipole emission based on previous observations  @xcite , we explained the excess emission by fitting for electric dipole radiation ( spinning dust ) as predicted by  @xcite .    from the fitted seds ,",
    "feature a1 was found to have  t@xmath11  @xmath0  40  k , which was significantly hotter than the other 4 features with  t@xmath11  @xmath0  30  k. the central component of the shell peaks at  @xmath0  60  @xmath10 m , and as such was found to have  t@xmath11  @xmath0  70  k. we suspect this central heating is due to the presence of the central o9.5b0v star , hd  278942",
    ".    the dust emissivity for each of the 5 features were calculated , and found to be in agreement with the values from previous observations where anomalous emission has been detected .",
    "feature a1 was found to have a similar value to that of hii regions , while the other 4 features all agree with the typical value for high galactic latitudes .    by performing a correlation analysis between the vsa and _ iris _ observations , we have shown that the correlation is stronger at shorter wavelengths , suggesting that this anomalous emission is caused by the smallest dust grains such as vsgs or pahs .",
    "it is these dust grains , which current spinning dust models  @xcite predict as the source of the electric - dipole radiation , and hence these correlation results imply that what we are observing is emission from spinning dust grains .",
    "spectroscopic observations  @xcite have provided evidence for the existence of the naphthalene cation  ( a simple pah ) in the g159.618.5 region , which could be responsible for the anomalous emission .    to gain a better understanding of the origin and nature of this anomalous emission , we compared our results with the previous analysis of this region performed by  @xcite .",
    "this comparison revealed that the bulk of this anomalous emission ( @xmath0  90  % ) appears to be originating from some large scale structure , which is being resolved out by the vsa i.e. that the anomalous emission in g159.618.5 is very diffuse and not concentrated in the 5 features observed with the vsa .",
    "future high - resolution observations at microwave wavelengths , combined with the _ spitzer _ ir data , is needed to investigate in more detail the nature of the anomalous emission .",
    "the  _ planck _ and  _ herschel _ satellites will provide data in the microwave , sub - mm and fir regimes which are required to measure the spectrum of anomalous dust in the frequency range  @xmath0  10    100  ghz .",
