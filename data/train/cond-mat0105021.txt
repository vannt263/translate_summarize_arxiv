    "however , there has been no clear evidence of the observation of flat - band ferromagnetism , because it is difficult to form these lattices using these materials since a lattice distortion effect would destabilize the ferromagnetism when the flat - band is half - filled.@xcite  in real materials , the number of valence electrons is determined in such a way that the crystal structure is stable .",

    "the flat subbands are broken down , except for @xmath27 ( from x point to m point ) in the lieb lattice .",

    ", high spin states appear at the half - filling ( @xmath34 ) for the lieb lattice and @xmath35 for the kagome lattice .",
    "this result is consistent with the theorems proved by lieb@xcite for the lieb lattice and mielke@xcite for the kagome lattice .",
    "this result shows that the ferromagnetic state appears in a wide range of electron filling in the kagome lattice , whereas ferromagnetism appears only at the half - filling for the lieb lattice .",
    "high spin states seen in fig .  [ fig : spin ] when the fermi level is not at the flat band ( @xmath36 for the lieb lattice and @xmath37 for the kagome lattice ) are due to an unimportant finite size effect due to additional degeneracy .",

    "this energy difference can be regarded as a qualitative estimate of the transition temperature of ferromagnetic and paramagnetic transition in a macroscopic sample as will be discussed in sec .",
    "first we consider @xmath23 .",
    "as lieb has already pointed out,@xcite  the high spin state in the lieb lattice is caused by the anti - ferromagnetic ordering at the half - filling .",
    "this ordering can be easily understood when @xmath41 . in this limit at the half - filling , there is one localized electron per dot .",
    "due to the second - order process of an electron with up - spin transferring to the neighboring dot having a down - spin electron , the effective exchange energy is given by @xmath42 .",
    "as the numbers of sites in two sublattices are different , the remaining total spin is responsible for the ferromagnetism .",
    "the high spin in the kagome lattice is caused by an effective exchange interaction of the third - order process cycling and exchanging two electrons with the opposite spins within the triangular lattice of three sites.@xcite   when @xmath41 , the energy loss due to this ring exchange is of the order of @xmath1 , whereas there is no energy loss between two electrons with the same spins . actually , from fig .",
    "[ fig : de - u / t ] , one can deduce @xmath43 for the lieb lattice and @xmath44 for the kagome lattice , which is consistent with the above argument .",
    "when @xmath32 is small , the energy difference is proportional to @xmath8 in both cases , i.e. , @xmath45 for the lieb lattice and @xmath46 for the kagome lattice .",
    "this is because the coulomb repulsion raises the energy of the order of @xmath8 when electrons on the flat band have the opposite spins in the lowest spin state , whereas , by the pauli principle , it does not when electrons on the flat band have the same spins in the high spin state .    as @xmath5",
    "is increased , the energy difference becomes smaller or sometimes negative . for small @xmath32 , the ferromagnetic ground state for @xmath23",
    "is easily broken down by very small @xmath5 , because the subband is no longer flat for @xmath26 as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : band - structure ] .",
    "electron are filled in such way as to lower the total spin to gain the single - particle energy of the order of @xmath5 rather than as to align spins to gain the smaller exchange energy of order of @xmath8 .",
    "as @xmath32 is increased , the gain from the effective exchange energy @xmath47 overcomes the loss from the single - particle energy which is of order of @xmath5 , and the ferromagnetic ground state becomes robust against @xmath5 . in the lieb lattice ,",
    "the ground state is always paramagnetic when @xmath48 in the range @xmath49 , whereas , in the kagome lattice , the ferromagnetism disappears for @xmath50 .",
    "this difference in the robustness against @xmath5 comes from the magnitude of the effective exchange energy @xmath47 as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : de - u / t ] .",
    "when @xmath51 , @xmath45 for the lieb lattice is much larger than @xmath46 for the kagome lattice . for @xmath41 ,",
    "the anti - ferromagnetic exchange energy between the next nearest neighbor sites in the lieb lattice slowly increases as @xmath52 because @xmath53 , where as , in the kagome lattice , the ferromagnetic energy due to the ring exchange rapidly decreases as @xmath54 .",

    "the coulomb energy can be analytically integrated , but the transfer integral is evaluated numerically from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : dot - model ] ) and ( [ eq : wavefunction ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : t - u ] shows the calculated transfer and the on - site coulomb energy as a function of the dot - diameter . here , we adapt the effective atomic units @xmath72 . in these units , energy and length",

    "( [ eq : t ] ) , and the transfer energy is determined by the distance between the nearest neighboring dots , i.e. , @xmath78 .",

    "@xmath47 is as high as a few tens of k.",
    "there are several advantages of using semiconductors in making artificial crystals .",
    "first , the lattice structure can be widely chosen .",
    "one can fabricate a lattice structure which does not exist in nature .",
    "second , inter - dot coupling and the electron filling can be separately modified .",
    "this is possible if the inter - dot coupling is modified mainly by the front - gate electrode on top of the two - dimensional electron gas and the electron filling is modified mainly by the back - gate electrode .",
    "the controllability of electron filling enables us to switch ferromagnetism on and off .",
    "it would be better to use the kagome lattice in order to switch the ferromagnetism because the ferromagnetic ground state appears in a wide range of electron filling as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spin](b ) .",
    "the effect of a magnetic field in the kagome lattice is also very interesting because the flat band is destroyed by the threaded magnetic flux .",
    "it has been found that a giant negative magnetoresistance and ferromagnetic - paramagnetic transition induced by a magnetic field occur in the kagome dot lattice .",
    "@xcite   recently , the present authors have proposed an simple way to realize the kagome dot lattice within the present fabrication technology.@xcite  it has been shown that a network of quantum wires effectively acts as a kagome lattice where electrons are well localized at the cross points of two wires .",
    "this kind of kagome network has been already available in quatum wires formed by a selective area growth technique.@xcite  this method of making a kagome dot lattice provides us a chance to observe the flat - band ferromagnetism in experiment .",
    "one may think that there should be no long - range order such as ferromagnetism in two dimensions at finite temperatures according to the mermin - wagner theorem .",
    "@xcite  however , it has been shown that the spin - spin correlation length @xmath90 in the spin @xmath91 heisenberg model on a 2d square lattice exponentially grows like @xmath92 as decreasing temperature although the ( anti - ferromagnetic ) spin - spin correlation decays like @xmath93.@xcite  then , the spin - spin correlation length @xmath90 can be macroscopically large at low temperatures .",
    "for example , at @xmath94 , @xmath90 is @xmath95 times larger than the lattice spacing .",
    "moreover , the the spin - spin correlations in the 2d xy model decay very slowly with distance @xmath96 like @xmath97 below the kosterlitz - thouless - berezinskii ( ktb ) transition temperature,@xcite  and a measurable magnetization is always present in any realizable system having a finite size . actually , below the ktb transition temperature @xmath98 , the thermal - averaged magnetization per site is shown to be @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is the coupling constant and @xmath31 is the number of sites.@xcite  at @xmath101 , @xmath102 for @xmath103 . the effective curie temperature for a finite - size system where the finite magnetization appears is similar to @xmath104.@xcite   these two results suggest that a finite magnetization can be expected even in two - dimensions as long as the sample size is smaller than the spin - spin correlation length . moreover , considering @xmath105 , our estimation of the transition temperature in fig .  [ fig : de - d ] is qualitatively justified .",
    "although a finite magnetization is expected in two dimensions , its value will be quite small in 2d dot arrays , since the lattice constant ( @xmath106 nm ) of dot arrays is about more than a hundred times larger than that of the conventional ferromagnetic materials and the expected magnetization per area will be significantly reduced . to measure the magnetic moment directly , a very sensitive detector such as a squid magnetometer would be required .",
    "a more convenient way to detect the magnetization directly will be to measure the anomalous hall resistivity which is proportional to the magnetization of the sample and is added to the normal hall resistivity proportional to the external magnetic field . on the other hand ,",
    "magnetoresistance measurement is rather an indirect way to detect the magnetization .",
    "when the magnetic field is increased , the insulating ferromagnetic state turns into the metallic paramagnetic one in the kagome lattice at the half - filling.@xcite  the magnitude of the magnetization could not be estimated only from the magnetoresistance measurement , although the ferromagnetic - paramagnetic phase transition could be detected .",
    "the advantage of using semiconductors in realizing ferromagnetism exists not only in making semiconducting permanent magnets . as we mentioned , the controllability of the magnetic property by changing the electron filling and the magnetic field will make dot lattices useful in electronic devices such as memories , sensors , and magnetic heads since only semiconductor materials such as si and gaas are contained .",
    "magnetic devices can be fabricated without using any magnetic elements such as iron and manganese which are incompatible with the conventional lsi fabrication process .    by extending the idea of dot superlattices",
    ", one can think of other interesting possibilities of artificial materials .",
    "thanks to the rapid progress in the semiconductor nano - technology , we can expect that various interesting electric properties which have been observed in conventional materials may be realized also in dot superlattices .",
    "one of the most fascinating examples is high - temperature ( high-@xmath107 ) superconductivity",
    ". high - temperature @xmath108-wave superconductivity in a repulsive hubbard model has been predicted .",
    "@xcite  although the energy scales or the transition temperature is a hundred times smaller than the conventional cuo@xmath109 high-@xmath107 superconductors ( @xmath110  k ) , superconductivity in semiconductor dot arrays might be possible , because the estimated transition temperature using the predicted expression is @xmath111  k for @xmath112 nm gaas dots .",
    "it has been shown that , in other types of lattices , the transition temperature becomes much higher.@xcite  it would be very interesting if superconductivity ( or at least the kbt transition ) could be realized in semiconductors .",
    "other types of lattice structures would also be fascinating , such as a ladder structure realized in copper oxide materials , where various interesting properties have been observed such as the spin gap and superconductivity.@xcite  optical properties of the dot arrays would also be interesting , since the large density of states in the flat band will significantly affect photo - luminescence or laser characteristics .",
