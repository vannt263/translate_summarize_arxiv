    "developing tools to control all degrees of freedom of single quantum particles is one of the fundamental aims of the area of quantum engineering . over the past few decades precision spectroscopy",
    "has made significant strides towards achieving this goal for the internal degrees of freedom of atoms and ions , and more recently electro - magnetic trapping technologies have made similar advances in controlling the external degrees . by today ; magnetic , optical and magneto - optical traps can be designed to trap and control large or small numbers of atoms , and even single particles .",
    "one example of the latter are optical microtraps , in which single atoms can be localised to an area with dimensions smaller than an optical wavelength .",
    "such traps can , for example , be based on highly focussed laser beams or small scale interference patterns , with the most famous example of the latter being optical lattices .",
    "taking advantage of the existence of the so - called mott transition at low temperatures , such lattices allow for the creation of periodically spaced arrays of individually trapped atoms in one , two or three dimensions .",
    "the ability to control the spatial position of single atoms to a high degree of precision is , for example , important in controlling distance dependent interactions .",
    "it is therefore necessary to develop diagnostic tools that can measure the position of a single atom with very high fidelity .",
    "a number of technologies have been developed during recent years and among these are de - convolution algorithms @xcite and atom microscopes @xcite . the latter rely on an advanced optical setup and the ability to position optical elements very close to the atoms . in this work",
    "we suggest another method which makes use of technology developed in the emerging area of sub - wavelength diameter optical fibers by calculating the spatial emission profile of an array of periodically spaced two - level atoms in the presence of such a fiber .",
    "optical nanofibers , which are created by placing industrial grade silica fiber over a hot flame and pulling both ends ( for a review of this technology see  @xcite ) , support only a small number of modes and can therefore be thought of as cavities into which enhanced emission rates can be achieved @xcite .",
    "the emission characteristics of an atom into a nanofiber in general depends on the radius of the fiber , the distance from the atom , the wavelength of the transition and the orientation of the atomic dipole @xcite .",
    "it has recently been shown that a single - mode fiber of radius @xmath6 nm can collect up to 28% of the spontaneous emission of a cesium atom when the atom is sitting at the fiber surface @xcite . in larger fibers , which support higher order modes as well ,",
    "even higher collection rates can be achieved @xcite .    here",
    "we study the coupling between a row of atoms and the guided modes of a perpendicularly aligned optical nanofiber and show that such a setup can resolve the position of single atoms on length scales that are typical for optical lattices .",
    "it can also allow for the detection of empty sites in a mott insulator state or be used in a time - dependent way to identify , for example , edge states @xcite . in the following",
    "we will first briefly introduce the geometry of the setup ( section  [ sec : potentials ] ) , then present the expressions for the collected radiation ( section  [ sec : emissionrates ] ) and finally discuss the obtained results ( section  [ sec : results ] ) .",
    "let us first briefly review the components of the suggested setup .",
    "optical lattices are formed by pairs of counter - propagating lasers which interfere to create spatially periodic arrays of microtraps by employing the dipole force of the standing wave laser light field @xcite .",
    "the simplest case of an optical lattice trapping potential is given by a one - dimensional model , in which two counter - propagating laser beams interfere .",
    "this results in a standing wave for the optical intensity given by @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the free space wave number of the laser light and @xmath9 is the maximum intensity of the laser beam .",
    "the periodicity of the intensity is @xmath10 and the spatially varying ac stark shift then forms a potential for the induced dipole moment , @xmath11 , of the atom given by @xmath12 here @xmath13 is the vacuum permittivity , @xmath14 is the speed of light and @xmath15 is the optical polarizability , which depends on the frequency of the laser field , @xmath16 , see @xcite . by using light which is blue - detuned @xmath17 or red - detuned @xmath18 with respect to the atomic transition @xmath19 , the atoms can be forced to gather at the nodes or anti - nodes of the laser intensity pattern , respectively .",
    "higher dimensional lattices can simply be created by introducing pairs of counter propagating lasers in the other spatial directions @xcite , and different spatial geometries can be achieved by varying the angle between these beams @xcite .",
    "optical lattices typically have lattice constants in the range between @xmath20 nm and @xmath21 nm and throughout this work we assume a lattice spacing of @xmath22 nm . the atom we consider is @xmath23cs , whose ground state has its dominant ( @xmath24 ) line at @xmath25=852 nm .",
    "cold atoms trapped in optical lattices provide an adaptable quantum system in which a variety of matter - wave quantum phenomena can be engineered and observed .",
    "notably , it has been possible to induce a quantum phase transition from a superfluid to a mott insulator state by controlling the tunneling interaction between different sites .",
    "this was first demonstrated experimentally in 2002 @xcite , when a mott insulator state with a well - defined number of atoms per lattice site was achieved using @xmath26rb .",
    "however , until recently it was only possible to demonstrate this phase transition by detecting the loss of coherence using a time - of - flight interferometric measurement , and only the development of so - called atom microscopes has made it possible to resolve single sites inside the lattice @xcite .",
    "the technological difficulty in constructing a device that can resolve single lattice sites lies in overcoming the diffration limit and allowing for sub - wavelength resolution .",
    "the atom microscope does this by using advanced optical elements to focus the light to below the diffraction limit .",
    "a second strategy for going beyond the diffraction limit is to use sensors of subwavelength size and here we study an approach of this kind based on collecting the optical emission using the guided modes of a nanofiber .",
    "recent advances in technology have made it possible to produce tapered fibers with radii as small as a few hundred nanometres @xcite , in which only a very small number of modes can propagate .",
    "these devices can be fully integrated in ultracold atom experiments @xcite and we suggest a geometry in which a fiber is aligned perpendicularly to a row of regularly spaced atoms ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : schematicsidebyside ] ) in order to collect the atomic fluorescence . due to the small radius of the fiber ,",
    "such a setup allows for a good spatial resolution of the atomic distribution .",
    ".4   and the nanofiber waist is on the order of hundreds of nanometers .",
    "the typical length of the tapered region is between 3 and 10 mm , depending on the tapering technique employed  @xcite .",

    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    as already mentioned above , the emission characteristics of an atom into a nanofiber depends on the radius of the fiber , the distance between the atom and the fiber , the wavelength of the transition and the orientation of the atomic dipole  @xcite . in the following",
    "we will investigate the use of single- ( supporting only he@xmath27 ) and multi - mode fibers ( supporting he@xmath27 , he@xmath28 , te@xmath29 , tm@xmath29 ) , as the latter are known to allow for much higher collection rates  @xcite .",
    "we consider a one - dimensional optical lattice in which @xmath23cs atoms are individuallytrapped with a separation distance @xmath30  nm and assume that all dipoles are aligned . for any position of the fiber",
    "we therefore only include a contribution from the component of the dipole along the line connecting the fiber centre and the atom .",
    "the distance between the surface of the fiber and the axis of the row of atoms is given by @xmath31 and the fiber radius by @xmath32 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fiberschematic2 ] ) .",
    "the fiber we consider is made of silica , which for a photon of @xmath33 nm has a refractive index of @xmath0 = 1.4525 @xcite .",
    "following closely the approach of @xcite to calculate the emission rate into the fiber , let us first consider the emission rate into free space , @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the matrix element of the atomic dipole moment , @xmath36 is vacuum permittivity and @xmath37 is the atomic frequency . this emission can excite four guided modes given by the four possible combinations of @xmath38 polarization and @xmath39 propagation direction in the fiber .",
    "normalizing the emission rate into each of these modes with respect to the full emission rate , we arrive at @xmath40 where @xmath41 is made up of the mode functions of the electric parts of the relevant mode outside of the nanofiber .",
    "the parameter @xmath42 is the reciprocal of the group velocity and calculated as @xmath43 , where the propagation constant @xmath44 is determined by ensuring continuity between the field components outside of the nanofiber ( @xmath45 ) with the ones at the surface of the fiber  @xcite .",
    "this leads to an implicit equation that has to be solved numerically as a function of the system parameters .",
    ".numerical values of @xmath44 and @xmath46 for the fundamental he@xmath27 mode for the @xmath47 nm transition in @xmath23cs for a fused silica fiber with @xmath0 = 1.4525 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in slightly larger fibers the presence of three extra modes allows for even higher collection rates and in fig .",
    "[ fig : fourmodes ] we show the emission rates into a fiber of radius @xmath48  nm .",
    "the relevant values for @xmath44 and @xmath42 are given in table [ tab : propconst2 ] .",
    "for @xmath33 nm this fiber can support four guided modes and comparing the rates obtained for @xmath49 nm with the ones for the single - mode fiber ( solid line in figs .",
    "[ fig : changingd ] and  [ fig : changinga ] ) , one can see that the collection rate increases from about 0.06 to 0.07 .",
    "this increase persists at the larger distance of @xmath50 nm ( dashed lines ) , however less dramatically and by @xmath51 nm ( starred line ) it is almost impossible to distinguish the atoms .",
    "while using a larger fiber gives an advantage in terms of radiation collected , fig .",
    "[ fig : fourmodes ] also shows that the visibility goes down faster and therefore the resolution for single lattice sites decreases .        from the above it",
    "is clear that close proximity between the fiber and the atoms ( @xmath52 nm ) is advantageous to obtain clearly distinguishable signals .",
    "however , bringing a room - temperature fiber close to a trapped ultracold atom requires the consideration of the van der waals interaction between the atom and the fiber surface .",
    "this is an attractive interaction that can influence the position of the trapping minimum and therefore the distance between the atom and the fiber .",
    "while this can lead to a different effective the emission rate into the fiber , the more dramatic effect is that the atom can be lost when the attractive potential destabilises the trapping minimum .",
    "the classical van der waals potential felt by an atom near the surface of a dielectric fiber of infinite length was calculated by boustimi _",
    "@xcite , and a detailed analysis of their expression by le kien _ et al . _",
    "@xcite showed that for atoms close to the surface the van der waals potential tends to the same values as that for a flat surface @xmath53 for atoms further away , the expression for a flat surface offers an upper limit on the influence of the van der waals interaction and taking @xmath47 nm gives a van der waals constant for @xmath23cs of @xmath54 j m@xmath55 @xcite .",
    "the combined potentials the atoms sees at two different distances from the fiber ( @xmath50  nm and @xmath51  nm ) are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : vdwdest](a ) and ( b ) , where we have assumed that the atom is transversally trapped in a tight harmonic oscillator trap of frequency of 500 khz .",
    "one can see that at these distances the van der waals interaction does not significantly effect the trapping position and no corrections to the emission rates are necessary .",
    "this , however , is different when the atom comes closer to the surface and for distances around 200 nm , the trapping potential becomes unstable and the atom is lost to the strong attractive potential from the fiber ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : vdwdest](c ) ) . to avoid this and to stabilise the trapping potential",
    ", one can add another repulsive field to the fiber , which is blue - detuned for the atom and its evanescent field partly compensates the van der waals potential .",
    "this is is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : vdwdest](d ) , where a blue - detuned field of wavelength @xmath56 nm and intensity @xmath57 mw is added to the fibre and allows to restore the original trapping location .",
    "however , this compensation mechanism does not work for arbitrarily short distances , due to the different functional forms of the van der waals and the optical force . and",
    "while we have seen that shorter distances give better resolution , the van der waals attraction sets an upper limit to what is achievable .",
    "= 500 khz and the starred line is the van der waals potential .",
    "the dashed line is the combined potential of all individual ones . ( a ) and",
    "( b ) show that for @xmath58  nm the trapping site is stable , whereas it can be seen in ( c ) that for @xmath49  nm the minimum of the joint potential is lost . in",
    "( d ) a blue - detuned field has been added to the fiber to compensate the attractive van der waals force and the circled line shows the combined van der waals and blue - detuned potential .",
    "one can see that this allows for the restoration of the trapping site . ]",
    "to demonstrate the limits of the technique proposed above and to apply it to a relevant dynamical situation , we return to considering a single - mode fiber of radius @xmath59 nm in this section . from the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : changingd ] we have seen that a nanofiber with a radius smaller than half an optical wavelength can resolve the position space of a collection of atoms trapped in an optical lattice .",
    "it is therefore a natural question to ask what the limit of this approach is and if it can be used to resolve more complicated atomic distributions or dynamical processes .    with this in mind",
    ", we show in figs .",
    "[ fig : pcolorasatomspair ] and [ fig : pcolorasatomspair2 ] the results for a situation typical in the process of controlled collisions between neutral atoms @xcite , in which every second atom in a row is brought closer to its neighbour .",
    "we consider a row of ten atoms initially equally spaced and calculate the spatially resolved emission rate as the distance between pairs becomes smaller using a fiber of radius @xmath60  nm , which is @xmath49  nm away from the row of atoms .",
    "one can clearly see that initially the expected well resolved maxima appear , but with decreasing separation between each pair of atoms the respective maxima move closer together and eventually the pairs of atoms become indistinguishable from each other .",
    "a simple geometrical argument based on the dipole emission cones shows that this should happen at when the separation between the pairs is approximately @xmath61 , for a typical fiber radius , which is confirmed by the graph .",
    "however , as the intensity measured in the fiber increases , one can still infer the presence of two atoms .",
    ".38  nm . moving towards the top , every other atom shifts closer to its neighbour on the right .",
    "the emission from two different atoms can be distinguished until the their separation is closer than approximately @xmath62  nm .",
    "( b ) here we show three slices from fig .  [",
    "fig : pcolorasatomspair ] when the pair separation is equal to 640 nm ( starred line ) , 480 nm ( solid line ) and 320 nm ( dashed line ) .",
    "we also indicate the colorbar axis in fig .  [",
    "fig : pcolorasatomspair].,title=\"fig : \" ]    0.62  nm .",
    "moving towards the top , every other atom shifts closer to its neighbour on the right .",

    "we also indicate the colorbar axis in fig .",
    "[ fig : pcolorasatomspair].,title=\"fig : \" ]    let us finally remark that even though our calculations have been done for a one - dimensional setting , one can easily imagine using a fiber to measure states at the edge of a two - dimensional geometry . moving the nanofiber through a two - dimensional lattice , however , would lead to losses due to the finite reach of the van der waals potential and in @xcite it was shown that compensation via a blue - detuned field can compensate well enough to allow the fiber to be moved through a lattice while compromising only the very closest sites to itself .",
    "this still allows , for example , to make measurements on alternate rows .",
    "while the analysis of the emission spectrum would be more difficult as emitters are located in two - dimensional space , one can compare measurements from different positions in order to determine the occupation of single lattice sites or even employ fiber arrays @xcite .",
    "we have shown that subwavelength optical nanofibers can be used to resolve atomic distributions in optical lattices .",
    "this is an alternative approach to the recently developed atom microscope and allows for higher resolution when using smaller fibers .",
    "however , as it requires bringing macroscopic objects very close to single atoms , it is mainly limited to one - dimensional arrays or edges of higher dimensional ones .",
    "nevertheless , it offers a new approach that can be integrated in ultracold atom experiments with current technologies .",
