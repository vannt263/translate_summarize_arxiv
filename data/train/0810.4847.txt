    "foliations with singularities on smooth manifolds appear naturally in many fields of mathematics .",
    "for instance , given a manifold @xmath0 one may : i ) consider a smooth function @xmath1 and look at its level sets ; the critical points of @xmath2 yield singularities of the corresponding foliation ; ii ) consider a lie group action @xmath3 ; the @xmath4-orbits define a foliation with singularities at the points in special orbits ; iii ) if @xmath0 admits a poisson structure , then this structure determines a foliation by symplectic leaves , which is singular at the points where the rank drops .",
    "these are just a few examples of singular foliations , there are many more . and yet , in the setting we envisage here -that of real manifolds- our knowledge of singular foliations is not so big , except in special cases .",
    "no doubt , a reason for this is the high degree of difficulty involved in the study of singular foliations : if non - singular foliation theory is already hard enough , adding singularities can turn it beyond any reasonable scope .",
    "thus one is naturally lead to imposing certain restrictions on the type of singular foliations one studies . here",
    "we look at a class of codimension 1 foliations which is a natural generalization of the morse foliations .",
    "we look at foliations which are locally defined by bott - morse functions .",
    "this class is large enough to be a rich family , including many interesting examples , and yet the conditions we impose do allow certain control , and one may hope to say interesting things .",
    "the concept of foliations with bott - morse singularities on smooth manifolds obviously comes from the landmark work of m. morse in his colloquium publication @xcite , as well as from r. bott s generalization of morse functions in @xcite .",
    "this notion for foliations was introduced in our previous article @xcite , where we focused on the case where all singularities were transversally of center - type .",
    "the presence of saddles obviously makes the theory richer , and this is the situation we now envisage .",
    "this type of foliations fits within the framework of _ generalized foliations",
    "_ introduced by h. j. sussmann in @xcite , and they appear naturally in various contexts .",
    "for instance every singular riemannian foliation in the sense of p. molino @xcite has bott - morse singularities of center - type ; this includes the foliations given by cohomogeneity 1 actions of compact lie groups .",
    "the foliations given by generic singular poisson structures of corank 1 also have bott - morse singularities , and so do the liftings to fiber bundles of morse foliations given on the base .",
    "the philosophy underlying this article is the following .",
    "suppose @xmath5 is a codimension 1 , transversally oriented closed foliation on a closed , oriented and connected @xmath6-manifold @xmath0 , and the singularities of @xmath5 are all of bott - morse type .",
    "one has that the transverse type of the foliation at each component @xmath7 of its singular set is independent of the choice of transversal , and it is therefore determined by its morse index .",
    "centers correspond to the extreme cases of morse index @xmath8 or @xmath9 .",
    "we know from our previous article that if there are only center - type components , then there are exactly two such components , and the foliation is given by the fibers of a smooth bott - morse function @xmath10 $ ] with two critical values at the points @xmath11 , which correspond to the two components of the singular set .",
    "furthermore , in this situation the leaves are all spherical fiber bundles over each component of the singular set .",
    "hence the topology is  well understood \" in these cases .",
    "one may thus think of the general case in the following way .",
    "assume there is a center - type component @xmath12 and look at the leaves around it , which we can describe as above ; this uses a local stability theorem similar to reeb s theorem for compact leaves ( section [ section : basins ] ) .",
    "look at the _ basin _ @xmath13 of @xmath14 ( see definition inside ) ; these are the leaves that  we understand \" .",
    "now we go to the boundary @xmath15 of this set . by construction , if @xmath16 then @xmath17 , there are no saddle singularities of @xmath5 in @xmath0 and we are in the situation previously envisaged in @xcite .",
    "otherwise there must be a saddle component @xmath18 in @xmath15 and no center - components there ; in this case we say that @xmath14 and @xmath18 _ are in pairing _",
    ", a key - concept for this article , inspired by @xcite .",
    "if the morse index of @xmath18 is not @xmath19 nor @xmath20 , then @xmath18 has exactly one separatrix @xmath21 and if we assume that there are no saddle - connections , then the compact set @xmath22 is precisely the boundary @xmath23 . in sections [ section : distinguishedneigh ] and [ sec . partial stability theorem ] we prove a stability theorem ( [ theorem : partialstabilitytheorem ] ) that allows us to determine the topology of @xmath15 and of the leaves in a neighborhood of @xmath15 , but outside the basin , by comparison with the leaves inside the basin .",
    "this is possible thanks to the triviality of the holonomy of codimension one invariant subsets that we prove in section [ section : holonomy - singular - set ] , and the description of _ distinguished neighborhoods _ of saddles in section [ section : distinguishedneigh ] .",
    "the description we give of the topology of @xmath24 and the topology of the leaves beyond the boundary is done by means of  fiberwise milnor - wallace surgery \" ( theorem [ topology of boundary ] ) .",
    "of course this is inspired by ideas of r. thom in @xcite .",
    "when the morse index of @xmath18 is @xmath19 or @xmath25 then the saddle @xmath18 may have one or two separatrices . if it has only one separatrix , then the discussion is exactly as above .",
    "however , if @xmath18 has two distinct separatrices @xmath26 , then @xmath27 has two components that meet at @xmath18 and the topology of the leaves in @xmath28 only determines the topology of one of these components .",
    "we need more information in order to determine the topology of all of @xmath29 .",
    "as we shall see , this is actually equivalent to determining the topology of the leaves  in the other side \" of the invariant set @xmath29 .",
    "the hope would be that there is not  much more \" beyond the boundaries of the basins of center - type components .",
    "however examples show that this is not the case and the possibilities are infinite",
    ". therefore we must impose additional restrictions on the foliations we consider in order to be capable of saying something .",
    "the first natural condition , that we already used above , is that the foliation has no saddle connections ; we call these _ bott - morse foliations _ , see definition [ definition : bott - morse ] .",
    "we also restrict this discussion to closed foliations , which already leaves out one the main features of foliation - theory : the presence of recurrences . yet , for instance , if a 3-manifold admits a heegard splitting of genus @xmath30 , then it admits closed bott - morse foliations with @xmath31 non - isolated center components , @xmath32 isolated saddles and leaves of all genera @xmath33 ( see section [ section : examples ] ) . moreover , if @xmath34 has a heegard splitting of genus @xmath35 then it has heegard splittings of all genera @xmath36 , and therefore bott - morse foliations with leaves of all genera . in higher dimensions",
    "the situation is even wilder .",
    "we thus have that the  zoo \" of bott - morse foliations is rather big .",
    "so in the last sections of this work we restrict ourselves to dimension three , which is already rich enough .",
    "we describe several types of possible pairings one may have in 3-manifolds , completing the study done in @xcite for foliations with isolated morse singularities , and we show that if one imposes the condition of having  sufficiently more \" centers than saddles , then the above mentioned list actually describes all possible pairings .",
    "we then extend to bott - morse foliations a reduction technique introduced in @xcite , that we call _ foliated surgery _ , that allows us to reduce , under appropriate conditions , the number of components of the singular set of a foliation .",
    "this technique is used in @xcite to prove that a closed @xmath6-manifold supporting a _",
    "morse foliation _ with strictly more centers than saddles is homeomorphic to the @xmath6-sphere @xmath37 or to a _ kuiper - eells manifold _ , _",
    "i.e. _ , a closed manifold supporting a morse function with three singular points .",
    "this generalizes the classical  sphere recognition theorem \" of reeb and an analogous result by kuiper - eells .    in this article",
    "we follow the same strategy , which is now somehow harder because the singular set of the foliation may have dimension @xmath38 and components of different dimensions .",
    "the idea is the following .",
    "let @xmath39 be a center type component .",
    "if @xmath5 is not compact then @xmath40 , the boundary of its basin , contains some saddle singularity @xmath12 .",
    "denote by @xmath41 the union of @xmath14 and all separatrices of @xmath14 . since @xmath6 is @xmath42 , there are cases where @xmath43 is not connected",
    ". then the  external leaves \" @xmath44 , those  beyond \" the boundary @xmath45 , are such that @xmath46 has two connected components , where @xmath47 is a distinguished neighborhood of @xmath48 . in this case",
    "our stability theorem  [ theorem : partialstabilitytheorem ] only gives information about the connected component of @xmath49 which is close to the basin @xmath50 .",
    "the topology of the other connected component has to be controlled by some other additional information .",
    "thence we must demand having  sufficiently more \" centers than saddles : @xmath51 . with this hypothesis , the local description of @xmath5 in @xmath47 that we get allows us to describe the topology of @xmath52 .",
    "we can then use theorem [ topology of boundary ] to describe the topology of the external leaves @xmath44 .",
    "this description allows the classification of the pairings that may possibly appear in this process , and we use foliated surgery ( cf .",
    "  [ section : foliatedsurgery ] ) in order to reduce the total number of singularities of @xmath5 but preserving the inequality @xmath53 .",
    "repetition of this process finally shows that @xmath0 can be equipped with a _",
    "bott - morse foliation , so we use @xcite to conclude ( theorem  [ theorem : center - saddledimensionthree ] ) that if @xmath34 is a closed oriented connected @xmath42-manifold that admits a closed bott - morse foliation @xmath5 satisfying @xmath51 , then @xmath0 is the 3-sphere , a product @xmath54 or a lens space @xmath55 .    when the singularities are all of the same dimension , then the hypothesis @xmath56 is enough to get all the information we need in order to carry on with the same strategy , and we arrive to the same conclusion ( theorem [ theorem : center - saddledimensionthreecircles ] ) .",
    "simple examples ( in section  [ section : examples ] ) show that the above bounds ( @xmath51 in general or just @xmath57 if the singular set is  pure dimensional \" ) are sharp in the sense that there are many closed , oriented 3-manifolds that admit closed bott - morse foliations with @xmath58 singular components of mixed dimensions , and also with @xmath59 singular components of the same dimension ( either @xmath8 or @xmath19 , as we please ) .",
