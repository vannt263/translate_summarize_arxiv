    "over the past decade , interest in measuring supermassive black hole ( bh ) masses has intensified , as evidence mounts that bhs play a central role in galaxy evolution ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",

    ". none of these techniques can currently reach beyond a few tens of mpc .",
    "thus , we resort to indirect mass estimates in actively accreting bhs to probe bh and galaxy coevolution at cosmological distances . studies of the bh mass and accretion - rate distributions both locally @xcite and at higher redshifts @xcite , as well as studies of possible evolution in bh - bulge scaling relations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "bh masses derived from agns use the broad - line region ( blr ) gas as the dynamical tracer , based on the assumption that the gas is primarily accelerated by the gravity of the bh . the gas velocity dispersion is derived from the broad - line width , but the bh mass estimate also requires the radius of the emitting region .",
    "the best estimate for its size comes from `` reverberation '' or echo mapping @xcite .",
    "detailed spectroscopic monitoring allows an estimate of the light - travel time through the blr , by measuring the delay between variations in the continuum and line emission ( see the recent compilation by * ? ? ?",

    ". data from our lick agn monitoring project ( lamp ) , the subject of this paper , are consistent with the same assumption ; when multiple balmer lines are considered independently ( e.g. , h@xmath4 , h@xmath0 , h@xmath5 ) , all yield consistent estimates for the so - called virial product , @xmath6 @xcite . on",
    "the other hand , other models , such as disk winds , would predict similar radial dependence ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "despite these major uncertainties , the reverberation - derived bh masses correlate remarkably well with the luminosities and stellar velocity dispersions of their host bulges @xcite .",
    "in addition , the very few existing direct dynamical measures of bh masses have so far turned out to be consistent with the reverberation - mapping virial estimates @xcite .",
    "since reverberation radii are usually not available , a secondary estimate of blr size is often obtained from the empirical correlation ( the `` radius - luminosity '' relation ) between agn luminosity and blr size , @xmath7 @xcite . with just a measurement of the agn luminosity , typically @xmath8 , and a broad - line width , typically @xmath9",
    ", one can roughly estimate a bh mass as @xmath10@xmath11 . here",
    "@xmath12 is a scaling parameter that includes unknown information about the geometry and kinematics of the blr .",
    "these so - called `` single - epoch '' virial bh masses are indirect , and depend on a number of assumptions .",
    "two empirically determined quantities fundamentally limit the accuracy of the derived bh masses .",
    "one is @xmath12 , which is currently determined for ensembles of active galaxies through comparison between agn - based masses and other estimates of @xmath10  such as the @xmath13  relation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , reverberation - mapping campaigns have not yet succeeded in measuring @xmath12 directly for individual objects .",
    "we are getting closer , however , since two - dimensional reverberation mapping is growing more common and the velocity - resolved emission - line response strongly constrains @xmath12 in individual sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the other empirically determined parameter is the slope of the radius - luminosity relation , @xmath0 , which is the subject of this paper .",
    "we are motivated to revisit this question thanks to our recent reverberation - mapping campaign , which has doubled the number of reverberation - mapped agns with @xmath14 light days .",
    "we do not consider the optical agn continuum luminosity because the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) is required to spatially disentangle the agn and galaxy continuum for these low - luminosity sources .",
    "the requisite _ hst _  imaging is underway ( go-11662 , pi bentz ) , and we will present the optical radius - luminosity relation in a future paper . here",
    "we focus on other direct and indirect indicators of the agn luminosity , including the x - ray luminosity and broad and narrow emission - line luminosities .",
    "there are practical reasons to consider other routes to determining blr radii .",
    "for example , alternate relations are useful whenever the optical / uv continuum from the agn is not measurable .",
    "this could occur when the agns are radio loud , so that the optical / uv continuum is contaminated by synchrotron radiation , or when the galaxy rather than the agn dominates the optical continuum ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it has become common practice to use h@xmath4  or h@xmath0  luminosities to calculate @xmath15for high - redshift targets where the continuum is rarely detected ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "finally , remarkably , there is indirect evidence that broad - line widths measured from polarized line emission may provide a reasonable single - epoch virial bh mass ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* c.  y. kuo , in preparation ) . in these cases , hard x - rays or narrow emission lines",
    "are some of the only available proxies for agn continuum luminosity .",
    "if the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) and the density distribution in the blr are independent of luminosity , then we expect that the blr size will scale simply with the square - root of the photoionizing luminosity , @xmath16 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the most recent calibrations of the radius - luminosity relation have all been consistent with this simple relation @xcite .",
    "if the seds were really independent of luminosity , the photoionizing luminosity could be estimated from a measure of the agn continuum at almost any wavelength",
    ". however , there are observational indications of luminosity dependence in seds .",
    "indeed , on theoretical grounds we might also expect smaller and hotter accretion disks around lower - mass bhs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "while the equivalent width of h@xmath0  is constant in high - luminosity active galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , both @xcite and @xcite see evidence for a weak inverse - baldwin effect in h@xmath0  at low luminosity .",
    "furthermore , the increase in @xmath17  with uv luminosity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggests luminosity - dependent changes in the sed . finally , the relative strengths of the `` big blue bump '' and the x - rays depend on eddington ratio , with the latter dominating at lower @xmath18  . for a review of the situation at yet",
    "lower @xmath18  see @xcite .",
    "therefore , in this paper we will consider several observables which may correlate with , and thus be used to estimate , the ionizing luminosity .",
    "specifically , we consider the following proxies for the agn luminosity : hard x - ray luminosity ( @xmath19 ) , h@xmath0luminosity ( @xmath20 ) , narrow [ ] @xmath21    luminosity ( @xmath22}}$ ] ) , and narrow [ ]  @xmath225.8 @xmath23 m luminosity ( @xmath24}}$ ] ) .    throughout",
    "we assume the following cosmological parameters to calculate distances : @xmath25  km  s@xmath26  mpc@xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 .",
    "the new measurements that motivate this work result from lamp , a dedicated monitoring campaign of 13 agns ( including the well - studied seyfert galaxy ngc 5548 ) .",
    "we specifically focused on nearby ( redshift @xmath29 ) seyfert galaxies with low luminosities ( @xmath30  erg  s@xmath26 ) and probable bh masses in the range @xmath31  @xmath32 , since this luminosity and mass regime had not been explored fully in the past .",
    "spectroscopic monitoring was carried out with the lick observatory 3 m shane telescope over a nearly contiguous 64 day period @xcite , while photometric monitoring was performed over a longer period utilizing four smaller telescopes @xcite .",
    "we successfully measured blr radii based on h@xmath0  for nine objects @xcite , reported lags in multiple other balmer transitions @xcite , and succeeded in measuring velocity - resolved lags in at least three sources @xcite .",
    "finally , we revisited the calibration of reverberation - mapped bh masses using the @xmath13  relation @xcite . for the purpose of this paper ,",
    "we focus on blr radii based exclusively on h@xmath0  lag times .",
    "the blr light - crossing times used here are presented by @xcite and @xcite for the previous reverberation - mapped and lamp agns , respectively .",
    "we note that improved lag measurements were more recently reported for a subset of galaxies by @xcite .",
    "we have confirmed that the radius - luminosity relation based on h@xmath0  does not change with the inclusion of their lag values , but continue to use the old measurements for temporal consistency with the x - ray observations .",
    "we follow @xcite and @xcite and remove ic 4329a from the sample due to uncertainties in the measurements . throughout",
    "we will refer to the sample of active galaxies with reverberation mapping , excluding the lamp targets , as the `` non - lamp '' objects .",
    "we describe the origin of the agn luminosities in this section ( table 1 ) .",
    "it is useful to remember that `` blr size '' here actually refers to the time of peak response of the h@xmath0  emitting gas relative to the continuum , multiplied by the speed of light .",
    "had the experiment been done with c iv @xmath21549 , for instance , the sizes would have been smaller , but the widths larger . when calculating effective bh masses , it is important to match the species used to measure velocity dispersion with the radius relation calibrated for the same species .",
    "of all the luminosities we discuss , only the broad h@xmath0  line luminosity ( @xmath20 ) is measured as part of the reverberation - mapping campaign , simultaneously with the radius measurement . it should provide a fairly direct and unbiased probe of the photoionizing continuum . both @xcite and @xcite",
    "tabulate average @xmath20  measured in the same way .",
    "note that we present results based both on the total h@xmath0luminosity ( narrow and broad combined ) and the broad h@xmath0luminosity alone .",
    "the results are basically identical , since the median luminosity difference is less than 5% .",
    "although it would be useful to examine h@xmath4  as well , uniform measurements do not exist for the non - lamp sample , and thus we must await future work .",
    "the [ ]  luminosities for the lamp sample itself are measured from the shane spectra and are presented by @xcite . for the non - lamp targets , we draw from previous reverberation mapping campaigns for the local galaxies . for the more distant and luminous palomar - green quasars @xcite , we combine the equivalent - width measurements of [ ]  from @xcite with the continuum fluxes of @xcite as given by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "table 1 contains all measurements , including relevant references .",
    "note that the [ ]  luminosities have not been corrected for extinction .",
    "the formal errors for the [ ]   measurements are in the range @xmath33 . however , we find a median difference of @xmath34 between different literature values ( relying predominantly on the compilation of * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the values used here , from previous reverberation mapping campaigns , are typically smaller than those compiled by whittle .",
    "thus , in our fitting we adopt an uncertainty of 0.15 dex in the line luminosities , as an estimate of the impact of various systematic effects discussed below .    a large fraction of the non - lamp sources",
    "have [ ]  @xmath225.8 @xmath23 m luminosities available in the literature from the _ spitzer space telescope_. we draw predominantly from the measurements of @xcite , which cover a large fraction of the non - lamp reverberation - mapped sample .",
    "we take the measurements for mrk 766 and mrk 335 from the work of @xcite and that of ngc 3516 from the work of @xcite . with the exception of this last ,",
    "all were taken with the high - resolution grating . a similar comparative exercise as above , this time with the compilations of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ,",
    "yields a lower uncertainty estimate ( @xmath35 ) than for the [ ]  lines .",
    "presumably greater agreement is reached because the data sets were in many cases identical , and so we use a value of @xmath36 as above .",
    "the x - ray luminosities for the non - lamp sources are taken directly from the compilation of @xcite .",
    "they are derived from a variety of literature sources , but generally are based on _ advanced satellite for cosmology and astrophysics _ ( _ asca _ ) data @xcite . while many of these targets have more recent _ xmm - newton _  or _ chandra _",
    "observations available in the archive , the _ asca_measurements are actually closer in time to the reverberation - mapping campaign .",
    "thus , we adopt the x - ray luminosities presented by kaspi et al . in all cases .    the x - ray luminosities for the lamp objects come from a range of sources .",
    "in all cases we adopt the observation closest in time to that of our campaign ( spring 2008 ) .",
    "six objects ( mrk 142 , apr 151 , mrk 766 , mrk 1310 , ngc 5548 , and ngc 4748 ) have x - ray luminosities from _",
    "swift_. all were observed between 2007 and 2009 .",
    "the _ swift _  data were extracted using the _ xselect _ task as part of the heasarc tool - set .",
    "each source was extracted from a circular region with a radius of 20 pixels ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "background rates were negligible in all cases .",
    "count rates were converted to fluxes assuming a power - law spectrum with @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) and no internal absorption . in the few cases with multiple epochs ( e.g. , mrk 766 and ngc 5548 ) ,",
    "we analyze the longest observation where the galaxy center is close to the image center .",
    "the remainder of the lamp agns only have heterogeneous measurements available in the literature . in one case ( ngc 6814 )",
    "we use the _ xmm - newton_slew survey @xcite and in another ( mrk 202 ) we resort to an _ asca _  observation from 1999 @xcite , where aperture photometry yields a count rate that is converted to a flux assuming only galactic extinction and @xmath40 .",
    "the luminosity for ngc 6814 , from the slew survey , was derived in a similar fashion , using the same spectral model .",
    "the only difference is that the flux is reported for 212 kev .",
    "we use webpimms to calculate the 210 kev flux assuming our spectral model .    with many years of comprehensive",
    "monitoring , ngc 5548 is a special case and warrants extra attention .",
    "there are fourteen non - lamp epochs from @xcite and @xcite . in figure",
    "1b we show all fifteen epochs in gray for reference .",
    "currently , ngc 5548 is in a very low luminosity state .",
    "the lamp measurement differs by a factor of @xmath41 from the weighted average of all other epochs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "unfortunately , we have only two epochs of x - ray data for this source , and , given narrow - line region sizes of hundreds of pc , the [ ]  luminosity is presumed constant over timescales of months . for the purposes of fitting , we adopt the weighted average lag , @xmath42 light - days , from @xcite as the non - lamp point .",
    "the early x - ray data are from _ asca _  and were taken in 1993 , when the lag was measured to be @xmath43 light - days @xcite .",
    "if we rather adopt the latter value in our fitting of the x - ray radius - luminosity relation (  4 ) , it makes no difference to our results .",
    "since the blr size of ngc 5548 has been observed to change on timescales short compared to changes in the narrow - line flux , it is also interesting to note that there is a scatter of @xmath44 dex in the logarithm of the ratio of lag to [ ]  luminosity across the fifteen epochs .",
    "each of the luminosities we consider comes with its own complications . in the case of the narrow emission lines",
    ", they have been photoionized by the average continuum luminosity over the past @xmath45 100 years , during which time @xmath15  may vary significantly . on the other hand , the x - ray emission region is more compact than the optical emitting region , and thus varies on shorter timescales than changes in @xmath15occur . with nonsimultaneous observations",
    ", we may introduce significant scatter into the @xmath15@xmath46  relation .",
    "in addition , x - ray variability timescales depend systematically on @xmath10  and luminosity ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "thus , it is at least conceivable that some systematic bias is introduced into the @xmath15@xmath46  relation .",
    "we investigate that possibility here .",
    "we start by considering all multi - epoch data available for reverberation - mapped sources from the tartarus database .",
    "the benefit of tartarus is that the fluxes have been derived from the _ asca _  x - ray spectra in a uniform way .",
    "spectral fits to the hard x - rays ( 210 kev ) are performed , with the region around fe  k@xmath4 masked and including possible internal absorption ( which is small in this spectral region ) .",
    "ten of the non - lamp targets have multiple epochs of observations spanning more than one year in the tartarus database .",
    "they include 3c 120 , fairall 9 , mrk 509 , ngc 3227 , ngc 3516 , ngc 3783 , ngc 4051 , ngc 4151 , ngc 4593 , ngc 5548 , ngc 4269 , and pg 1226 + 023 .",
    "the typical cadence is a few observations per year .    for each object",
    "we calculate a mean and root - mean square ( rms ) flux using the tartarus database .",
    "we find variability amplitudes of 580% ( one standard deviation ) over the 17 yr timescales probed by these observations .",
    "ngc 3516 is the target with the highest variability amplitude ( 80% ) .",
    "the majority of objects do not vary even by a factor of two on these timescales .",
    "the median amplitude of variability is @xmath47 .",
    "thus , the level of intrinsic variability in the x - ray luminosity of most seyferts is usually too small to impact the @xmath15@xmath46  relation . for fitting purposes we thus adopt @xmath48 uncertainties in all x - ray fluxes .",
    "-0 mm    we perform a second check using artificial light curves .",
    "our goal is to investigate whether systematic changes in break time - scale will lead to a bias in our derived @xmath15@xmath49 relation .",
    "we use the prescriptions of @xcite to generate mock light curves with an input power spectrum of variability .",
    "we generate a family of light curves , each of 5 yr duration , and each with a characteristic break in the power spectral density function .",
    "the break timescales range from 0.01 to 30 days , which is similar to the range of 0.005 to 30 days seen in reverberation - mapped sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for simplicity ,",
    "all light curves have a power - law slope of @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) at frequencies above the break frequency and a slope of @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) at frequencies below the break .",
    "each artificial light curve is `` observed '' 2000 times with 10  ks duration .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio is taken to be 100 ( but does not impact the results ) and the assumed variability amplitude is @xmath48 to match the tartarus average above .",
    "we then look at the spread in derived x - ray fluxes as a function of break timescale .",
    "there is no change in the width of the distribution of mean fluxes for breaks ranging from 0.01 to 30 days .",
    "therefore , we do not expect any systematic errors in our x - ray flux estimates as a function of mass or luminosity based on trends between break timescale and mass or eddington ratio @xcite .",
    "it is also worth discussing the primary sources of systematic errors in the fluxes of narrow emission lines .",
    "first , aperture corrections can be significant , since narrow - line regions ( nlrs ) have sizes of hundreds of parsecs and are often spatially resolved ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "objects that are closer are more susceptible to aperture effects .",
    "the lamp targets were observed with a slit of width @xmath54 , while the non - lamp targets generally come from apertures of width 220  ( although most are larger than 4 ) , and the @xcite observations were taken with a @xmath55 slit . between the compilations of @xcite and @xcite , we find nlr sizes for four of the pg quasars , two lamp objects ( ngc 5548 and mrk 766 ) , and five other non - lamp objects ( mrk 590 , ngc 3516 , mrk 79 , ngc 3783 , ngc 4593 ) .",
    "the nlr sizes of these galaxies are 0.12 , with a median size of 03 .",
    "the pg quasars all have nlr sizes @xmath5612 .",
    "nominally , based on the objects with measured nlr sizes , we expect minimal loss of light due to aperture effects .",
    "observing conditions will also lead to some slit losses , in the case of the @xcite observations , but not at a level that is significant compared to internal extinction ( see below ) . to address the rest of the sample",
    ", we estimate nlr sizes using the size - luminosity relation of @xcite .",
    "we find that the typical expected nlr size ( for both lamp and non - lamp sources ) is @xmath57 .",
    "the pg quasars , which were observed with the smallest slit , all have expected sizes in the range @xmath58 .",
    "we are in even less danger with the @xmath24}}$]measurements , given their larger aperture sizes ( 520 ) and compact emission regions @xcite .",
    "the next important concern is internal extinction .",
    "it has been shown many times , particularly for obscured agns , that the [ ]   luminosity can be significantly extinguished by dust ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , @xmath24}}$ ]  is relatively insensitive to extinction , making it a higher fidelity luminosity indicator ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; if the @xmath22}}$ ]  measurements are compromised , we still expect to find reasonable results for @xmath24}}$ ] . finally , there is the possibility of contamination from star formation . in principle",
    "this is possible for @xmath22}}$ ] , but note that the [ ] /h@xmath0  intensity ratio is considerably lower in high - metallicity star - forming galaxies than in active galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "as shown by @xcite , the expected level of @xmath22}}$]contamination from star formation in local obscured active galaxies is low ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "our primary goal is to calibrate the relation between blr size and various indicators of nonstellar ( agn ) luminosity .",
    "we fit to the standard relation ( @xmath60lt - days ) @xmath61 , where @xmath62 here is derived from h@xmath0 , @xmath49 , and narrow emission - line luminosities . for comparison with recent literature ,",
    "we utilize two primary fitting schemes .",
    "the first is a @xmath63minimization technique similar to that presented by @xcite .",
    "the following @xmath63  function is minimized : @xmath64 intrinsic scatter is accounted for by replacing @xmath65 with @xmath66 , where @xmath67 ( the intrinsic scatter ) is chosen such that @xmath68 .",
    "in addition , we use a maximum - likelihood technique adapted from @xcite . for simplicity",
    "we assume that both the measurement errors and the intrinsic scatter have gaussian distributions . for a set of observed points ( @xmath69 ) , we maximize the total likelihood , @xmath70 in the presence of measurement errors , if the likelihood of measuring a blr radius @xmath71 for a true radius @xmath72 is @xmath73 , and the probability to have a true radius @xmath72 given @xmath74 is @xmath75 , then for a given observation the likelihood is @xmath76 we assume that both @xmath77 and @xmath75 have a log - normal form .",
    "uncertainties in the independent variable ( luminosity ) are derived from monte carlo simulations and are always small .",
    "fits using both methods are given in table 2 , with the first line showing the @xmath63method .",
    "in all cases the results of the two fitting methods are indistinguishable .",
    "it is interesting to note that the x - ray and h@xmath0  relations are now consistent with a slope of @xmath16 .",
    "in contrast , @xcite report a slope of 0.7 for the x - ray relation ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "we should note , however , that when they fit an average lag for each object and used only h@xmath0  lags ( the most directly comparable case to what we have done here ) , they find a slope of 0.5 ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "their reported @xmath80 slope is steeper , @xmath81 . with our improved data , we find that both relations are consistent with a slope of 0.5 .",
    "thus , the simplest assumption , that agn seds and blr densities are independent of luminosity , appears to apply , at least for the present sample and to the level of precision that can be tested by our data .",
    "one goal of ongoing reverberation - mapping campaigns should be to investigate whether there are physical regimes ( e.g. , in bh mass or luminosity ) for which this assumption does not hold ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "there is tantalizing evidence , in contrast , that the narrow - line relations may have a steeper slope , although with low significance .",
    "here we explore possible interpretations of this result , should it turn out to be significant .",
    "above we discussed various sources of contamination of the nlr luminosity , including redshift - dependent aperture correction , extinction , and star formation .",
    "aperture effects go in the wrong direction to explain the steeper slope , while extinction seems implausible because it would have to impact the @xmath24}}$]measurements as strongly than the @xmath22}}$ ]  measurements , contrary to normal reddening laws .",
    "star formation could artificially boost the nlr luminosities at the low end .",
    "however , we do not believe the @xmath22}}$ ]  contamination could be more than @xmath35 on average , while the values need to be boosted by factors of 23 to impact the slope on a logarithmic scale .",
    "therefore , the steeper slope , if real , is more likely explained by physical effects rather than measurement errors .",
    "it would most naturally arise from the measured luminosity dependence in the relation between nlr and bolometric luminosity .",
    "we are not the first to report this trend .",
    "for instance , @xcite find that @xmath82 } \\propto l_{\\rm 2 - 10~ kev}^{0.70\\pm0.06}$ ] , while @xcite find @xmath83 } \\propto l_{\\rm   2 - 10~ kev}^{0.7\\pm0.1}$ ] and @xmath82 } \\propto l_{\\rm   [ o~iv]}^{0.9\\pm0.1}$ ] . if @xmath15@xmath84 @xmath46@xmath85 , then based on netzer et al .",
    "we would expect @xmath15@xmath84 @xmath22}}$]@xmath86 , which is consistent with our finding .",
    "the slope we measure in the @xmath15@xmath24}}$ ]  relation is also consistent with the results of @xcite .",
    "thus , the possibility of a steeper slope is plausible .",
    "for some reason , quasars are less efficient at powering an nlr than are the less luminous seyfert nuclei .",
    "there is now compelling evidence that bolometric corrections depend on the eddington ratio @xmath18 , where the eddington luminosity for 1  @xmath32  is taken to be @xmath87  erg  s@xmath26 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is worth seeking correlations between radius - luminosity relation residuals and the eddington ratio .",
    "bh mass measurements are provided by the reverberation - mapping campaigns . in the case of the non - lamp sources ,",
    "we take the eddington ratios from the study of @xcite , who have measured simultaneous seds ranging from the optical to the x - ray using _ xmm - newton_. we do not yet have full seds for the lamp sample , and so we use a single - band observation and a bolometric correction .",
    "we adopt @xmath46  and the bolometric correction from @xcite .",
    "the bolometric correction depends on the eddington ratio and we assume a value of 30 , as appropriate for sources with @xmath18@xmath88 .",
    "the resulting eddington ratios are in the range 0.0011 , but are strongly peaked at @xmath89 .",
    "we seek correlations between the residuals in @xmath15  around the mean @xmath15@xmath62 relations and the eddington ratio .",
    "the nonparametric kendall s @xmath90 is calculated ( within iraf ) for all relations . in no case do we find evidence for a correlation between the @xmath15@xmath62 residuals and @xmath18 .",
    "the probability of no correlation is in the range @xmath91 .",
    "although we do not know its origin , it is interesting to examine the intrinsic scatter for each fit . as expected ,",
    "the intrinsic scatter is lowest when @xmath20  is used , presumably because of both temporal and spatial coincidence .",
    "on the other hand , the relations based on both the x - rays and narrow emission lines have comparable scatter .",
    "one might expect higher scatter in the narrow emission - line relation due to the unquantified role of internal extinction and aperture effects .",
    "furthermore , the narrow - line emission can not respond to changes in accretion luminosity on timescales of a month , while we know that @xmath15  does .",
    "note that ngc 5548 has shown @xmath15  variability at the factor of four level , and yet the overall relations only have an intrinsic scatter of a factor of two .",
    "once the @xmath8  measurements are in hand , it will be interesting to see whether the intrinsic scatter is minimized using the optical continuum luminosity or , indeed , the bolometric luminosity .",
    "we explore radius - luminosity relations based on agn luminosities other than the optical continuum .",
    "the time is right to revisit these relations because of a new sample of low - luminosity , low - mass agns with reverberation mapping from the lamp project @xcite .",
    "we consider x - ray , broad h@xmath0 , narrow [ ] , and narrow [ ]  luminosities .",
    "these relations are designed for use in estimating bh masses when optical continuum luminosities are not available .",
    "relevant situations include local agns with galaxy - dominated spectra , and possibly radio - loud objects , various high - redshift active galaxy populations ( such as submillimeter galaxies ) , and heavily obscured agns with detected broad polarized emission .",
    "furthermore , any differences in slope or intrinsic scatter between relations based on different luminosities may indicate sed differences in agns as a function of luminosity or bh mass .",
    "we find that the @xmath15@xmath46  and @xmath15@xmath20  relations are well fit with a slope of @xmath15@xmath92 .",
    "this is the slope expected if agn seds and blr densities are independent of luminosity . on the other hand ,",
    "the narrow emission lines show tentative evidence for a steeper relation , @xmath15@xmath93 .",
    "intriguingly , these slopes are consistent with previous results showing that @xmath22}}$]/@xmath94and @xmath24}}$]/@xmath94  decreases with increasing luminosity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we find no evidence for a correlation between @xmath15@xmath62 residuals and eddington ratio .",
    "in fact , the intrinsic scatter in all relations is surprisingly small . on the one hand ,",
    "the x - rays are variable on short timescales , but , as we show , that does not translate into significant errors in the @xmath15@xmath46  relation . on the other hand , the narrow emission - line luminosities do not respond at all to state changes on timescales of a year .",
    "thus , we find it surprising that even in these cases the intrinsic scatter is only at the factor of two level .",
    "still , this scatter translates directly into uncertainties in the bh masses ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as the reverberation - mapped samples increase , it should become possible to search for evidence of secondary parameters that might allow one to decrease the total scatter , thereby increasing the fidelity of our bh mass estimates ."
