    "in this paper we define an invariant of graphs embedded in a three - manifold and a partition function for 2-complexes embedded in a triangulated four - manifold .",
    "the invariance under homeomorphisms of the manifold is proved in the case of graphs embedded in a three - manifold .",
    "it is shown how the invariant is determined by the fourier transform of a previously defined invariant , the relativistic spin network invariant , which is defined using the technology derived from the jones polynomial of links .",
    "this provides a proof of the general result announced in @xcite which was only proved there in simple cases . in the case of a 2-complex embedded in a four - manifold ,",
    "we give a formula for the partition function which involves only a regular neighbourhood of the 2-complex .",
    "these formulae enable a simple evaluation in the case where the 2-complex is a surface .",
    "we conjecture that the partition function can be normalised to give a homeomorphism invariant of the 2-complex in the 4-manifold .",
    "this is proved in a particular special case .",
    "the invariants described here are important in the study of quantum gravity .",
    "the 3-manifold invariant describes the partition function for three - dimensional quantum gravity in the presence of the observation of distance or momentum observables @xcite . in four dimensional quantum gravity",
    ", it has been suggested that there should be a perturbative expansion of quantum gravity about a topologically - invariant vacuum @xcite .",
    "each term in the expansion would be determined by the expectation value of some observables in a topologically - invariant partition function .",
    "this idea motivates the definition of the four - dimensional partition function presented here .",
    "let @xmath0 be a triangulated closed 3-manifold and @xmath1 an integer .",
    "then the turaev - viro invariant of @xmath0 is a homeomorphism invariant of @xmath0 defined using a state - sum model on the triangulation of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "each edge in the triangulation is labelled with a half - integer variable @xmath2 , the spin , from the set @xmath3 .",
    "the statistical weights for each simplex are constructed so that after summing over the variable @xmath2 for each edge , the resulting partition function @xmath4 is independent of the triangulation of @xmath0 .",
    "the full details of this definition of the turaev - viro invariant are not given here ; however an alternative description of the invariant in terms of the chain - mail link is given below .",
    "now let @xmath5 be a graph determined by a subset of the set of edges of the triangulation and label each edge in @xmath5 with a spin from @xmath6 .",
    "this labelled graph in @xmath0 is denoted @xmath7 .",
    "define the partition function @xmath8 in the same way as the turaev - viro partition function but not summing over the variables @xmath9 .",
    "we show that this definition is actually a homeomorphism invariant of @xmath10 , that is , does not depend on the triangulation of @xmath0 away from @xmath5 .",
    "in fact the definition can be extended to give a partition function for any labelled graph in @xmath0 , not just those that can be realised as edges of some triangulation .    as a special case",
    "one can recover the refined invariant of turaev and viro @xcite , which depends on a choice of an element of @xmath11 , by taking @xmath5 to be the 1-skeleton of a triangulation and summing over spins on @xmath5 whose parity agrees with a representative cocycle for the element of @xmath11 .",
    "the following is the main result about this partition function .",
    "it relates the partition function to the relativistic spin network invariant @xmath12 of the labelled graph @xmath5 in a connected closed orientable 3-manifold @xmath0 .",
    "this relativistic invariant was previously defined by yokota and yetter for the case @xmath13 @xcite , and was used in 4-dimensional quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "a generalisation to any @xmath0 is defined below by a suitable squaring of the witten - reshetikhin - turaev invariant of a graph embedded in a 3-manifold @xcite .",
    "the result requires a matrix which is the kernel of the fourier transform .",
    "let @xmath14 be the matrix determined by the coloured jones polynomial for the hopf link , and @xmath15 the coloured jones polynomial for the unknot .",
    "explicitly , @xmath16 and @xmath17    [ theoremft]for any triangulation of @xmath0 , @xmath18    in section [ 3dinvariance ] it is shown how to extend these definitions and results to an arbitrary graph embedded in @xmath0 .",
    "now we describe the formula for the corresponding 4-manifold construction .",
    "let @xmath19 be a closed triangulated oriented 4-manifold .",
    "the crane - yetter state - sum invariant of @xmath19 is given by assigning a spin variable to each 2-simplex of the triangulation , and summing over all values of these variables with weights determined by the sums of products of 15-j symbols @xcite .",
    "now suppose @xmath5 is a 2-complex determined by a subset of the 2-simplexes of the triangulation , and label each 2-simplex with a spin from @xmath6 .",
    "the labelled 2-complex is denoted @xmath7 , with @xmath20 the number of 2-simplexes , and again the partition function @xmath21 is determined in the same way as the crane - yetter partition function , but not summing over the variables @xmath9 .",
    "the main result is a formula for this partition function in terms of the witten - reshetikhin - turaev invariant @xmath22 of a labelled link in a 3-manifold .",
    "a regular neighbourhood of @xmath5 , denoted @xmath23 , is a manifold with boundary .",
    "its interior is denoted @xmath24 , and the complement @xmath25 , a compact manifold with boundary . in this boundary",
    "there is a framed link @xmath26 determined by a circumference for each 2-simplex of @xmath5 ( or attaching curve for the corresponding 2-handle ) .",
    "each component of the link @xmath27 is labelled with the corresponding spin @xmath9 .",
    "let @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 the signature ( index ) of @xmath19 and @xmath31 the euler characteristic of @xmath5 .",
    "the result for the partition function is    [ theoremfd ] for any triangulation of @xmath19 , @xmath32    note that the 3-manifold @xmath33 is the same as @xmath34 but with the opposite orientation .",
    "the importance of expressing the observable in this way is that @xmath22 is known to be an invariant of the link @xmath26 in the 3-manifold .",
    "this leads to the easy computation of simple examples .",
    "section [ sectionexamples ] computes some examples which demonstrate the dependence of this definition of the partition function on the triangulations of the 2-complex and of the 4-manifold . in the case in which all the faces are assigned the trivial representation ,",
    "then the result is a homeomorphism invariant of the 2-complex embedded in the 4-manifold .",
    "this invariant is non - trivial in cases of non locally - flat submanifolds .",
    "the precise definitions and the proof of the theorems appear below .",
    "the main technique is the description of the turaev - viro invariant called chain - mail@xcite .",
    "this starts from a handle decomposition of the manifold , rather than a triangulation , and associates a framed link in @xmath35 ( the chain - mail link ) to each handle decomposition .",
    "the turaev - viro partition function can then be evaluated from the coloured jones polynomial of this link .",
    "this is carried out for @xmath36 in @xcite and the description given here is an extension of this technique to the case @xmath37 considered here .",
    "each triangulation of the manifold determines a canonical handle decomposition , so there is no loss of generality .",
    "handle decompositions are considerably more flexible than triangulations and the proofs appear to be easier to construct using handles .",
    "there is the added bonus that the invariant is defined for more general graphs than those that occur as subsets of edges in a triangulation ( see section [ 3dinvariance ] ) .",
    "the 3-manifolds in this section are required to be orientable .",
    "let @xmath0 be a closed compact 3-manifold with a decomposition into handles .",
    "let @xmath38 be the union of the 0-handles and 1-handles , and @xmath39 the union of the 2- and 3-handles .",
    "this gives a heegaard splitting of @xmath0 , a decomposition into two oriented handlebodies .",
    "a generalised heegaard diagram for the handle decomposition of @xmath0 consists of the handlebody @xmath39 together with the set @xmath40 of attaching curves in @xmath41 for the meridianal disks of the 1-handles , and the set @xmath42 of attaching curves in @xmath41 for the 2-handles .",
    "each set consists of a non - intersecting set of simple closed curves , though of course the curves in @xmath40 can intersect the curves in @xmath42 .",
    "given the heegaard splitting and its diagram @xmath43 , the chain - mail link in @xmath35 is defined as follows .",
    "pick an orientation preserving embedding @xmath44 .",
    "the components of the chain - mail link consist of the @xmath45 and the @xmath46 , where the curves @xmath47 are displaced into the interior of @xmath39 in a level surface of a collar neighbourhood of the boundary .",
    "moreover , the link inherits a framing by considering each curve @xmath48 to be a thin strip parallel to the boundary of @xmath39 .",
    "this defines the framed link @xmath49 .",
    "let @xmath50 be a framed link in @xmath35 .",
    "suppose that each component of the link is assigned a spin .",

    "the coloured jones polynomial gives an evaluation of the link @xmath54>\\;\\in{{\\mathbb c}}$ ] for each parameter @xmath55 .",
    "the evaluation is defined by projecting the link to a two - dimensional diagram and using the kauffman bracket evaluation of the link diagram in which the @xmath53-th component of the link is cabled @xmath56 times and the jones - wenzl idempotent corresponding to an irreducible representation of quantum @xmath57 is inserted into the cable .",
    "this evaluation is described in @xcite ; we use the convention that the empty link has evaluation 1 , and kauffman s parameter @xmath58 is given by @xmath59 .",
    "the evaluation does not depend on the choice of the projection .",
    "each 1-handle of the manifold @xmath0 corresponds to exactly one circle @xmath60 of @xmath61 and each 2-handle to exactly one @xmath62 of @xmath61 .",
    "let @xmath63 be the number of 1-handles and @xmath64 the number of 2-handles .",
    "then the chain - mail link @xmath49 has @xmath65 components .",

    "@xmath69 is independent of @xmath70 .",

    "[ lemmaind ] @xmath72 .",
    "the proof of these two lemmas is identical to that given by roberts for the case where @xmath5 is empty .",
    "each circle @xmath62 ` kills ' the spin passing through it .",
    "this means that the embedding of the 1-handles of @xmath39 ( 2-handles of @xmath0 ) can be rearranged . in the second case",
    ", this leaves a product of tetrahedral graph evaluations ( 6@xmath2-symbols ) which defines the turaev - viro partition function for a triangulation .",
    "the following result shows that the partition function with non - trivial @xmath5 does not depend on the triangulation of @xmath0 away from @xmath5 itself .",
    "[ theoreminvt]let @xmath73 be a second triangulated 3-manifold with labelled subset of edges @xmath74 and @xmath75 a homeomorphism such that @xmath76 as labelled graphs .",
    "then @xmath77    this theorem follows immediately from theorem [ theoremft ] , proved below , and the invariance of the relativistic spin network invariant , since the fourier transform is invertible ( see section [ 3dinvariance ] ) .",
    "however we sketch a direct proof in the differentiable category which does not involve the use of theorem [ theoremft ] .    _ proof . _ to establish this , we begin with the corresponding property for @xmath69 . consider two different handle decompositions of @xmath0 which agree on @xmath23 .",
    "a handle decomposition corresponds to a morse function on @xmath0 .",
    "any two morse functions can be deformed one into the other , inducing a set of moves on the corresponding generalised heegaard diagram @xcite . in our case ,",
    "the morse functions can be arranged so that @xmath78 is a level surface , and the values on @xmath23 are less than the values on the remainder of @xmath0 and do not vary when the morse function is deformed .",
    "the consequence of this is that in the moves on the generalised heegaard diagram listed in @xcite , there are no instances of 1-handle curves sliding over the attaching curves for the 1-handles of @xmath23 .",
    "similarly , the attaching curves for the 1-handles of @xmath23 never vanish .",
    "it is easily seen that the partition function @xmath79 is invariant under these moves .    the triangulated manifolds @xmath0 and @xmath73 both have canonical handle decompositions ;",
    "although the map @xmath80 does not necessarily take the 1-handles and their attaching curves corresponding to @xmath5 to those corresponding to @xmath74 , it can be adjusted by an isotopy so that it does .",
    "this follows from the fact that these 1-handles and the 0-handles they are attached to form tubular neighbourhoods of @xmath5 and @xmath74 , and by using standard results on tubular neighbourhoods @xcite .",
    "this completes the proof of theorem [ theoreminvt ] .",
    "in the case of @xmath13 there is another known invariant of embedded graphs with edges labelled by spins , the relativistic spin network invariant . in this section",
    "it is shown by explicit calculation that the two invariants are related by a fourier transform of the spin labels .",
    "the calculation shows a relation to the shadow world presentation of the coloured jones polynomial of kirillov and reshetikhin @xcite .",
    "we start by giving a definition of the relativistic spin network invariant for a graph embedded in @xmath35 in terms of the kauffman bracket evaluation of a diagram of the graph in @xmath81 .",
    "this diagram is obtained by assuming the graph does not meet the north and south poles of @xmath35 ( moving it if necessary ) .",
    "these two points can be removed and the resulting space projected to the equator , @xmath81 .",
    "then we give a process for turning a diagram of the embedded graph into a chain - mail link for @xmath35 .",
    "this is based on a handle decomposition of @xmath35 which includes the original graph in the 0- and 1-handles .",
    "so it is possible to give a description of the partition function for the embedded graph in terms of the evaluation of this chain - mail link .",
    "finally , we show that this chain - mail evaluation is the fourier transform of the relativistic spin network evaluation for the original graph .",
    "the definition of the relativistic spin network invariant is as follows @xcite .",
    "it is convenient to generalise the usual definition of graph ( which has edges which are closed intervals with two ends which lie on vertices ) to allow , in addition , components which are circles with no vertices ( these will not be called edges as they are topologically distinct ) .",
    "a graph is required to have a finite number of edges and circles ; thus it forms a compact 1-dimensional polyhedron .",
    "let @xmath82 be a graph embedded in @xmath35 , with its edges and circles labelled with spins @xmath83 ( in a fixed order ) .",
    "first , the invariant is defined in the case of graphs in which each vertex is trivalent , then this will be generalised to arbitrary vertices . for each vertex of a trivalent graph",
    "there are three spin labels @xmath84 on the three edges meeting the vertex .",
    "put @xmath85 then the relativistic invariant @xmath86 is defined in terms of the kauffman bracket invariant of the diagram given by projecting the graph in @xmath35 to @xmath81 by @xmath87 we note that this definition includes the case of knots and links , for which there are no vertices .",
    "the definition is extended to arbitrary graphs by the relations @xmath88 which defines an @xmath20-valent vertex recursively , for @xmath89 , @xmath90 for 1-valent vertices , and @xmath91 for 2-valent vertices . in these equations ,",
    "only the part of the graph is shown , the remainder being the same on both sides . by using these relations ,",
    "an arbitrary graph is reduced to one in which each component is either a circle , or consists of trivalent vertices with edges which are closed intervals .",
    "it is worth remarking that one can also view this invariant as one determined by a particular subcategory of representations of @xmath92 .",
    "the process for turning an embedded graph diagram in @xmath81 into chain - mail is to construct a handle decomposition of @xmath35 which contains @xmath5 in its 0- and 1-handles .",
    "then the handle decomposition is turned into chain - mail as in section [ secchm ] . for convenience in presenting the proof",
    ", we shall assume that each ( two - dimensional ) region of the diagram is a topological disk .",
    "this implies that the diagram is connected and contains at least one closed circuit .",
    "the proof can be easily extended to other cases by adjusting the normalising factors .",
    "also , we assume that if the diagram is the unknot , then it contains at least one vertex , so that the circle is cut into edges .",
    "the procedure starts by adding extra vertices and edges to the graph @xmath5 to make a new graph @xmath74 for which it is possible to fill in 2- and 3-handles to make @xmath35 in an obvious way . at each crossing in the diagram , add an extra vertex to the graph on both of the edges that cross ( so that both new vertices project onto the crossing point ) , and add a new edge connecting them , vertically with respect to the projection .",
    "the new graph @xmath74 is labelled in the following way . where an edge has been subdivided into two edges by the introduction of one of the new vertices ,",
    "one of the two new edges inherits the same label , while the other new edge is labelled with 0 .",
    "( it does not matter which is which ) .",
    "the labels on the new connecting edges are summed over , weighted with @xmath15 .",
    "let @xmath93 be the number of crossings in the diagram . with this labelling , @xmath94 this resulting graph @xmath74",
    "can now be thickened to provide the 0- and 1-handles for a handle decomposition of @xmath35 .",
    "the 2-handles are now just a thickening of the planar regions in the diagram , which are disks by the assumption above .",
    "the 0- 1- and 2-handles together give a space homeomorphic to @xmath95 $ ] , and so adding two 3-handles , one above and one below the diagram , gives @xmath35 .",
    "this handle decomposition contains the original graph as a subset of the 0- and 1-handles .",
    "the chain mail diagram for this handle decomposition can be obtained very simply from the original diagram for @xmath5 .",
    "make the following replacements @xmath96 @xmath97 @xmath98 with a similar replacement to the last one for an @xmath20-valent vertex , for any @xmath20 . in the first of these replacements it has to be understood that there is just one circle marked with @xmath2 for each complete edge of @xmath5 .",
    "if the edge crosses other edges then the circle is placed on one of the resulting segments between two crossings , and it does not matter which segment is chosen .",
    "_ example .",
    "_ the chain - mail diagram for the labelled graph @xmath99 is @xmath100    in this diagram , the circles corresponding to edges of @xmath74 labelled by @xmath101 are not shown , as they do not affect the evaluation . the complete circle shown in the first two replacements moves are the @xmath60 curves , with the curves resulting from the first replacement move labelled with a spin .",
    "the remaining circles formed from the fragments shown in each replacement form the @xmath62 circles .",
    "the chain - mail diagram is evaluated using definition [ chainmail ] to give the partition function @xmath102 .",
    "the normalisation factor @xmath103 in definition [ chainmail ] reduces to @xmath104 , where @xmath105 is the number of edges in @xmath5 and @xmath93 the number of crossings in the diagram .",
    "this follows from the fact that @xmath106 is the number of 1-handles plus the number of 3-handles , and there are @xmath107 1-handles and two 3-handles .    using this explicit presentation of a formula for the partition function , it is easy to give a proof of theorem [ theoremft ] for the case of @xmath13 , namely    [ theoremftcase ] @xmath108    as stated in @xcite .",
    "examples of such calculations are given in @xcite .",
    "in the rest of this section , we outline the proof .    starting with the evaluation of the chain - mail link using definition [ chainmail ]",
    ", the expression can be transformed using the following identities : @xmath109 @xmath110 @xmath111 @xmath112 in the case of a vertex which is four - valent or more , this can be reduced to the above cases by the identities such as @xmath113 , which follows from the fact that the chain - mail definitions of these two partition functions are the same . finally , the overall normalisation factor is @xmath114    the result of applying the identites systematically in the case of a trivalent graph @xmath5 is the kauffman bracket evaluation of the original labelled graph @xmath5 , with a numerical weight factor which is equal to the kauffman bracket evaluation of @xmath5 with all crossings reversed , multiplied by the inverse of a theta factor for each vertex .",
    "this is best explained by giving the calculation for @xmath5 the graph with two edges given in the example above .",
    "@xmath115 this calculation uses the shadow world evaluation @xcite @xmath116",
    "in this section we give the definition of the graph invariants on manifolds followed by the proof of theorem [ theoremft ] .",
    "the well - known witten - reshetikhin - turaev invariant is used as the basis of the theory . in particular , many proofs are relatively simple because they exploit the known homeomorphism invariance of the witten - reshetikhin - turaev invariant .",

    "this definition is given first , followed by the equivalence with the crane - yetter definition for a triangulation .",
    "a handle decomposition of @xmath19 with one 0-handle gives rise to a kirby diagram , which is a link @xmath50 in @xmath35 with one component corresponding to each 1-handle or 2-handle of @xmath19 @xcite .",

    "we construct a handle decomposition which has one 0-handle .",
    "the triangulation of @xmath19 gives rise to a canonical handle decomposition of @xmath19 ; however this needs to be modified . to give the correct correspondence with the crane - yetter state sum , the dual handle decomposition is used , so that the thickening of a vertex is a 4-handle , the thickening of an edge a 3-handle , etc .",
    "then the number of 0-handles is reduced to one by replacing a simply connected tree containing all the 0-handles , and sufficient 1-handles to connect them , by a single 0-handle .",
    "this is now the correct handle decomposition of @xmath19 .",
    "this is proved simply by applying the relation ( [ fourstrand ] ) to the component of @xmath50 corresponding to each tetrahedron in the triangulation in the definition of the right - hand side .",
    "this gives a sum of products of 15@xmath2-symbols and a normalisation factor of @xmath217 times the crane - yetter definition .",
    "the regular neighbourhood @xmath23 of @xmath5 can be realised as the union of the 2- 3- and 4-handles which correspond to the 2- 1- and 0-simplexes of the 2-complex @xmath5 . as above",

    "firstly , removing each 4-handle adds a new @xmath35 component .",
    "then , removing a 3-handle results in either joining two components together by the connected sum operation , or in forming the connected sum of one of the existing components with @xmath222 .    using the identities ( [ wrtproperties ] ) , this results in the relation @xmath223 finally , comparing these three equations , and using @xmath224 , which follows from the fact that gluing 3- and 4-handles does not affect the signature of a 4-manifold @xcite , results in the statement of the theorem .      according to theorem 2",
    ", the partition function for a 2-complex in a four - manifold @xmath19 depends only on a certain link in the boundary of a regular neighbourhood of the 2-complex .",
    "this involves a choice of a regular neighbourhood .",
    "all of these choices are related by a homeomorphism of @xmath19 , and so the choice of regular neighbourhood does not affect the invariant .",
    "however it is not so easy to prove that the components of the link are well - behaved with respect to these homeomorphisms , and so a direct proof of the homeomorphism invariance of the partition function of a four - manifold with observables is missing .",
    "nevertheless , in some specific cases it is easy to do the computations and see the invariance .",
    "let @xmath225 be a locally flat submanifold of an oriented 4-manifold @xmath19 .",
    "let @xmath226 be a regular neighbourhood of @xmath225 , thus @xmath226 is a @xmath227-bundle over @xmath225 with structure group @xmath228 .",

    "the piecewise linear version is treated in @xcite .",

    "if @xmath225 is orientable , the euler class of this bundle is given by minus the self intersection number of @xmath225 with itself in @xmath19 .",
    "this euler class is called the normal euler number of @xmath225 , and is always zero for oriented surfaces in @xmath230 , since @xmath231 .",
    "however , the same is not true for non - orientable surfaces @xcite .",
    "explicit examples where @xmath225 is a locally flat surface can be computed easily . in the case",

    "that @xmath225 is an @xmath234 , the formula is @xmath235 where as before @xmath233 is the normal euler number of @xmath225 .",
    "the curves labelled with @xmath236 and @xmath237 are the 1-handles whilst the curve labelled by @xmath238 is the attaching curve for the 2-handle of @xmath239 .    from these examples",
    ", it can be seen that @xmath240 depends only on the tensor product of the representations colouring @xmath241 , and it can easily be normalised to give a triangulation - independent quantity . however , the homeomorphism invariant obtained depends only on the euler number of the normal bundle of the surface .",
    "one can use the statement of theorem [ theoremfd ] to extend the definition of @xmath79 to include the case of oriented 4-manifolds with boundary .",
    "for example , without observables this gives @xmath242 this has the property that if the closed three - manifold @xmath243 is a union of components of the boundary of both @xmath244 and @xmath245 , then @xmath246 with @xmath36 being the turaev - viro invariant of @xmath0 .",
    "also , for any closed 3-manifold @xmath0 , @xmath247 this follows from the fact that @xmath248 .",
    "these invariants are in fact obtained from the case of the observables on a 2-complex in a manifold without boundary , by taking all of the labels to be @xmath101 .",
    "this has the effect of removing a regular neighbourhood of the 2-complex .",
    "[ twocx ] let @xmath5 be a 2-dimensional polyhedron .",
    "consider a piecewise linear embedding of @xmath5 into an oriented 4-dimensional manifold @xmath19 .",
    "choose a triangulation of @xmath5 so that this triangulation can be extended to a triangulation of @xmath19 ( this is always possible ) .",

    "thus there is a crane - yetter partition function . with trivial labellings for the two - complex , theorem [ twocx ] gives the homeomorphism invariant of @xmath254 in @xmath230 @xmath255 where @xmath20 is the number of triangles of @xmath254",
