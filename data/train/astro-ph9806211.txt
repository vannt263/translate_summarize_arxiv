    "radioactive @xmath0ti , produced in core collapse supernovae , is an isotope of extraordinary astrophysical significance .",
    "its primary observable effects appear to be three in number and will likely grow in coming years .",
    "the first is that the relatively large abundance of @xmath0ca  it is the second most abundant calcium isotope and the 44th most abundant species overall in solar system material  is overwhelmingly due to its synthesis as @xmath0ti parent ( bodansky , clayton , & fowler 1968 ; woosley , arnett , & clayton 1973 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the second is that resulting gamma rays from young core collapse supernovae are expected to be visible from several galactic remnants ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath0ti decays to @xmath0sc emitting 67.9 kev ( 100% ) and 78.4 kev ( 98% ) lines .",
    "@xmath0sc then decays into @xmath0ca , which emits a 1.157 mev ( 100% ) line .",
    "the search for galactic @xmath0ti gamma - ray lines has been carried out by both the gamma - ray spectroscopy experiments on heao 3 ( @xcite ) , the smm satellite ( @xcite ) , and by cgro surveys with comptel ( @xcite ) . only from the direction of cas",
    "a snr has the 1.157 mev @xmath0ti gamma line flux been detected by comptel ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , with a flux initially reported at ( 7.0@xmath201.7)@xmath210@xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23 s@xmath24 .",
    "subsequently iyudin et al .",
    "( 1997 ) have reported cgro cycle 1 - 5 results from a 2@xmath210@xmath25 s exposure of cas a. the result is a flux of ( 4.8@xmath200.9)@xmath210@xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23 s@xmath24 and significance of detection of 6@xmath26 .",
    "this measurement is reasonably consistent with the cgro / osse three - line flux measurements ( the et al .",
    "1996 ) of ( 1.8@xmath201.5)@xmath210@xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23 s@xmath24 and with the preliminary result of rxte / hexte ao1 & ao2 observations ( @xcite ) of ( 1.3@xmath201.2)@xmath210@xmath21 @xmath27 @xmath23 s@xmath24 , at 4% confidence level with the most probable flux of the combined three instrument measurements being 3.2 @xmath210@xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23 s@xmath24 .",
    "this flux translates into ( 1.3 , 7.8)@xmath210@xmath28 m@xmath29 of @xmath0ti for a @xmath0ti half - life of ( 66.6 , 39.0 ) yrs respectively ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , distance of 3.4 kpc to cas a ( @xcite ) and age of 315 yrs ( @xcite ) . because the @xmath0ti yield probes the dynamics of core collapse supernova nucleosynthesis , and in particular , the location of the mass cut , the pre - supernova composition inside @xmath302 m@xmath29 , and the maximum temperature and density reached during the passage of the shock wave in the ejecta , this detection has generated great enthusiasm for snr distance measurements ( @xcite ) , for @xmath1-ray line observations ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , for new nuclear laboratory experiments to accurately determine the @xmath0ti half - life ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and for theoretical nucleosynthesis calculations in the context of core - collapse supernovae ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the third effect is that @xmath0ca - enriched silicon - carbide particles extracted from meteorites have been identified ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) as presolar particles that condensed within supernova ejecta during their first few years of expansion , while @xmath0ti was still at its initial value ( @xcite ) .",
    "these grains are of enormous value in probing the dynamics and make up of supernova ejecta ( @xcite ) .    in the near future",
    ", we can expect very accurate @xmath0ti line flux measurements , precise distances to several young snrs , and a accurate @xmath0ti half - life ( recent measurements of @xmath0ti lifetime by @xcite and @xcite seem to converge at a value of ( 87.7@xmath201.7 ) y ) .",
    "this reduction of current uncertainties will allow more meaningful comparisons of the @xmath0ti mass in cas a and other young snrs ( in particular , tycho and kepler ) to supernova models . however , a remaining factor limits such comparisons between observations of @xmath0ti mass and supernova models , namely ,",
    "the uncertainty in the nuclear cross sections governing the synthesis of @xmath0ti . a large number of nuclear reactions play a role in @xmath0ti production , and the cross sections for many of these are only estimated from nuclear models . while these estimated cross sections should be fairly accurate in many cases ( @xcite ) , there is no guarantee that they are so , and only laboratory measurements will provide us with confidence in the yield predictions from nucleosynthesis calculations .",
    "cross section values enter linearly into the stellar reaction rate . for this reason , and because of @xmath0ti s astrophysical significance",
    ", we have surveyed the relative importance of the nuclear reaction rates that govern its abundance .",
    "our purpose is to identify for the nuclear physics community those reaction rates that have the greatest astrophysical importance to the @xmath0ti abundance and which , consequently , would be appropriate targets for future cross section measurements . using a nuclear reaction network with 378 isotopes ,",
    "we have systematically varied specific reaction rates and groups of reaction rates in an experimental test for astrophysical significance .",
    "we identify the most important nuclear rates and explain our understanding of the overall rate dependencies we have found .",
    "preliminary results were presented in jin et al .",
    "in the following we will refer to the terms `` cross section '' and `` reaction rate '' somewhat interchangeably .",
    "it should be understood that `` reaction rates '' are calculated from either theoretically predicted and/or experimentally measured cross sections . related to this survey is work done by woosley & hoffman ( 1991 ) in which they varied the peak temperatures , densities , and neutron excesses of explosive silicon burning in alpha - rich freezeout to find the range of @xmath31co and @xmath0ti production with standard reaction rates .",
    "the present work is part of a long - range effort to determine the identity of the nuclear reactions that are of greatest importance to nucleosynthesis in stars .",
    "the goal is to improve the accuracy of nucleosynthesis calculations by encouraging experimental study of key reactions .",
    "although this has always been an important part of the science , as embodied for example in the nobel - prize winning work of w. a. fowler , it has not always been emphasized with useful clarity .",
    "most nucleosynthesis calculations have been concerned with testing the fundamental paradigm : does the evolution and explosion of stars reproduce the known elemental and isotopic abundances ?",
    "most research efforts address more explicitly the astrophysical models than the nuclear data base . that data base is usually taken as a given , and so most calculations have used the tabulated values as given in order to calculate the nuclear production within specific stellar models .",
    "all have been aware in this that the nuclear data base is uncertain , and conclusions have been drawn that respect that uncertainty .",
    "but almost no nucleosynthesis calculations display the dependence of the abundances on the values of the reaction rates used .",
    "the community of laboratory nuclear physicists devoted to this problem has continued the work of improving that data base .",
    "indeed the level of interest in this has been increasing in the past few years , in part because of the construction of several new radioactive - ion - beam facilities ( @xcite ) , each of which has realized that those facilities offer new opportunities to clarify cross sections near the z = n line in the nuclide chart where several important astrophysical processes occur .",
    "what is often missing is a clear idea of the relative importance of specific reactions for the overall problem .",
    "laboratory scientists quite understandably do not wish to pursue all of the large numbers of reactions that naturally occur .",
    "it has always been the demonstrated importance of the exact value for a cross section that has inspired improved measurements of it .",
    "this has usually been rather clear in those basic cycles instrumental for nuclear power in stars , where the identity of the important reactions is visible .",
    "the important reactions during advanced burning processes responsible for many of the intermediate mass nuclei have not been so closely scrutinized , however . during these processes a large number of reactions occur simultaneously , often presenting parallel paths to the same result , so that the significance of the value of each is obscured .",
    "the size of a cross section is no sure guide to the importance of the value attached to it . in certain circumstances during advanced burning a huge reaction rate",
    "is often opposed by a huge and nearly equal flow due to the inverse reaction , nullifying importance for the exact value of that reaction rate for that epoch of that process .",
    "so complex are those networks that unambiguous responsibility for final abundances has been difficult to assign .",
    "this is especially true for nuclear processes taking place in or near equilibrium .",
    "our approach to clarifying this is to explicitly change the value of a specific reaction rate ( or rates ) and to redo the calculation to test the sensitivity of a final answer to its value .",
    "we have developed a logical sequence to do this in a practical manner .      because the goal is to ultimately influence measurements of key cross sections ,",
    "it is useful to list explicitly the four requirements that are , at a minimum , needed for this goal to be achieved :    1 .   an appropriate astrophysical model of events significant for nucleosynthesis ; 2 .",
    "an observable from that process , usually an abundance result that is either known or measurable ; 3 .   dependency of the value of the observable on the value of a nuclear cross section ; 4",
    ".   experimental strategy for measuring that cross section , or at least of using measurable data to better calculate it .",
    "it is important to note in item 1 that the model must be `` appropriate '' , not necessarily `` correct '' .",
    "we know that models of supernovae , for example , are never `` correct '' .",
    "the unknowns from all of physics are many .",
    "but the model may be appropriate for testing the sensitivity of the observable to the value of the cross section in question",
    ". the cross - section dependence may be determinable with more accuracy than the absolute value of the observable , because the absolute value depends upon the model s realism .",
    "indeed , the model s realism will later be tested by the nucleosynthesis results it produces once the important reaction rates are known .",
    "we stress this distinction that has confused many who ask , `` why is it so important to pin down the key cross sections when the astrophysical model introduces more uncertainty than the cross sections do ? ''    the observable will usually be some abundance in the natural world .",
    "it may be the bulk abundance in solar system matter .",
    "it may be the abundance outside a supernova that has just created new nuclei .",
    "it may be an isotopic anomaly within presolar grains having isotopic composition distinct from solar isotopes .",
    "it could be abundances within cosmic rays .",
    "other examples exist .",
    "the point is that the observable should on good independent grounds be believed to measure the process modeled .",
    "combination of 1 and 2 focuses on the cross section dependence of the value of an observable as produced in the process 1 .",
    "it is then a separate question as to whether that cross section has a different importance for another observable , or within a different process .",
    "such distinctions are necessary and valid .",
    "the greater the sensitivity of the observable to the value of a specific reaction rate , the more important that rate s value is .",
    "not every abundance observable depends sensitively on the nuclear reaction rates ; for such cases a cross section does not carry significance ( for that observable and that process ) . when experiments are difficult and costly it would be discouraging to learn afterwards that the effort was without astrophysical significance .",
    "our approach is to explicitly vary the reaction rate to measure the dependence of the final abundance of the observable to the value of that rate . by that procedure",
    "a quantitative measure of its significance can be presented .",
    "item 4 , the strategy for the measurement , will be the issue decided by experimental teams motivated to nuclear research for purposes of nuclear astrophysics .",
    "the sensitivity of @xmath0ti synthesis to variations in unmeasured cross sections must be determined for the process that produces it .",
    "point 1 of  2.2 requires an appropriate model for that process , which is now known to be the alpha - rich freezeout of matter that was initially in nuclear statistical equilibrium or quasi - statistical equilibrium but that freezes out with excess alpha particles ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "although @xmath0ti is also produced during silicon burning ( @xcite ) and within explosive helium burning as it may occur within he caps atop type ia supernovae ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , it is believed that the alpha - rich freezeout is responsible for most of natural @xmath0ca and it is certain that it is responsible for the @xmath0ti gamma lines detectable from young type ii remnants .",
    "we therefore choose in this work to determine the sensitivity of the @xmath0ti yield within that process . it still remains to select an appropriate model for that process .",
    "actual supernova models are both uncertain and complicated . in figure",
    "[ fig : ti44contour ] we show contours of @xmath0ti yields computed with our network code ( described in more detail below ) as functions of initial peak temperature and density in nearly adiabatically expanding matter experiencing an alpha - rich freezeout .",
    "the figure shows that the @xmath0ti yield variation is less than a factor of 10 for quite large ranges of peak temperatures and densities near the reference parameters , which have been suggested by hydrodynamic models .",
    "therefore , to survey the nuclear reaction rate sensitivity it will suffice to evaluate that rate sensitivity within parameterized expansions that are typical of the alpha - rich freezeout history within the type ii core .",
    "we do this by adiabatic expansions of pure @xmath32si matter initially at @xmath33 k = 5.5 and mass density @xmath34 g @xmath5 .",
    "these are the same conditions studied by woosley & hoffman ( 1991 ) for the alpha - rich freezeout ( see their table 1 ) .",
    "such conditions imply a ratio of the number density of photons to that of nucleons of 0.57 , corresponding to a specific entropy s / k @xmath35 , which is suitable for shock decomposed silicon in the type ii ejecta .",
    "we take the initial density to decline exponentially with an e - fold time 0.14 s , a typical hydrodynamical timescale , and we assume that the photon - to - nucleon ratio stays fixed at 0.57 throughout the expansion ; thus , @xmath36 .",
    "this one zone calculation is then allowed to cool until charged particle reactions freeze out ( @xmath370.25 ) .",
    "such a schematic calculation , though inadequate to define the actual @xmath0ti yield from core collapse supernovae , is adequate as the basis for a survey of cross - section sensitivity for that yield .",
    "one additional parameter set by the presupernova evolution is the fractional neutron excess @xmath6 of the matter undergoing the alpha - rich freezeout . roughly speaking its value , which depends upon",
    "how far thermonuclear evolution has progressed when the shock wave strikes , is @xmath380 in the he core , @xmath380.002 ( @xmath39 ) in the co core , and @xmath380.006 in the si core .",
    "we first survey at @xmath6=0 in section 4 .",
    "the reaction network used for the calculations is that described in @xcite and meyer , krishnan , & clayton ( 1996 ) .",
    "table [ tab : tabnet ] shows the nuclides included in the network . within explosive silicon burning",
    "that network includes many experimentally unknown reaction cross sections .",
    "for these reactions , the rates are calculated from the smoker code ( @xcite ) .",
    "figure [ fig : massfr ] shows the evolution of mass fractions of key species in the `` standard '' calculation .",
    "the material begins as pure @xmath32si , but quickly breaks down into light particles which then establish a large quasi - equilibrium ( qse ) cluster ranging from silicon to beyond nickel .",
    "for these particular conditions , the system does not attain complete nuclear statistical equilibrium ( nse ) .",
    "this is due to the slowness of the triple-@xmath7 reaction in maintaining the abundance ( per nucleon ) @xmath40 of heavy nuclei ( @xmath41 ) at the level demanded by nse .",
    "this slowness imposes an extra constraint on the equilibrium , which is thus a qse , not an nse ( @xcite ) . within the qse cluster",
    "the rates of reactions involving @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath7 , and @xmath1 reactions proceed at the same rate as their inverses , just as in nse ; but in qse the total number of nuclei in the cluster is not the number they would have in nse .",
    "as the temperature falls , the @xmath0ti abundance drops .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that the qse cluster shifts upward in mass owing to falling temperature in the face of a deficit of heavy nuclei relative to nse demands ( @xcite )",
    ". @xmath0ti breaks out of the large qse cluster around @xmath44 , and its abundance starts to grow as alpha particles in this alpha - rich freezeout reassemble into @xmath9c .",
    "subsequent alpha captures then carry the newly assembled @xmath9c up to higher - mass nuclei , including @xmath0ti .",
    "the final frozen @xmath0ti mass fraction ends up roughly three orders of magnitude greater than its lowest value at the moment it broke out of the large qse cluster .",
    "mpeg movies illustrating the nuclear dynamics of the `` standard '' calculation are available for viewing on the world - wide web at http://photon.phys.clemson.edu/movies.html",
    "in order to determine the sensitivity of the @xmath0ti yield to specific reaction rates , we carried out a systematic survey .",
    "the central plan of the survey is to increase or decrease a reaction rate or set of reaction rates by a large factor and then to rerun the alpha - rich freezeout calculation described above .",
    "the associated errors in the nuclear cross sections may be either a uniform increase or decrease of their values as a function of energy within the statistical model , or they may be specific energy - dependent contributions to the reaction rate .",
    "we then compared the resulting @xmath0ti yield to that in the `` standard '' calculation in which no reaction rate was changed .",
    "a significant yield difference indicates a sensitivity to the varied rates .",
    "it is important to note that the network code automatically computes reverse reaction rates from the ( largely known ) nuclear masses , forward reaction rates , and detailed balance ; thus , for example , if the rate for the reaction @xmath45 is increased by a factor of 100 , the code automatically increased the rate for the reverse reaction @xmath46 by a factor of 100 .",
    "this is in compliance with detailed balance and is necessary to allow the network to relax to the appropriate equilibrium when relevant .",
    "we began with a survey over element number @xmath47 .",
    "this step multiplies all charge - increasing and mass - increasing reaction rates on all isotopes of a single element @xmath47 by a factor of 0.01 and ran the alpha - rich freezeout .",
    "this set of reaction consists of ( @xmath7,@xmath1 ) , ( @xmath7,p ) , ( @xmath7,n ) , ( p,@xmath1 ) , ( p , n ) , ( n,@xmath1 ) .",
    "elements from carbon ( @xmath48 ) to bromine ( @xmath49 ) are tested in this way .",
    "we then repeated the procedure , but this time using a factor of 100 .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ fig : zsurv ] . from this figure",
    "it is evident that the @xmath0ti yield is sensitive to reaction rates on a number of elements , particularly on ti itself and on v. what is perhaps more striking , however , especially in the lower panel , is the large number of elements to which the @xmath0ti yield is _ not _ sensitive .",
    "for example , the @xmath0ti yield ( the astrophysically relevant observable ) is not sensitive to large ( factor of 100 ) uncertainties in reactions on any isotope of carbon through phosphorus !",
    "such a negative result insofar as rate sensitivity is concerned is as valuable as a positive result because it increases the robustness of calculations of nucleosynthesis in alpha - rich freezeouts .",
    "the uncertainties in these cross sections do not jeopardize the calculated @xmath0ti yields . understanding this prevents incorrect astrophysical motivations for nuclear experiments on reactions irrelevant to the observable .",
    "there is a simple reason for the insensitivity of the @xmath0ti yield to reaction - rate variations on so many elements .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , the @xmath0ti abundance builds up as new heavy nuclei assemble late in the expansion .",
    "a nearly steady nuclear flow , whose magnitude is governed by the triple-@xmath7 rate , carries these new nuclei up to higher mass . by steady flow ,",
    "we mean that the nuclear flow into a nuclear species by capture from lower - mass nuclei equals the capture flow out of that species ; thus , the abundance of the nuclear species in question does not change except over long time . because the flow is given by a rate times an abundance , an increase in the rate is compensated by a decrease in the abundance so that the net nuclear flow upward remains unchanged . by analogy ,",
    "if a smoothly flowing river widens at some point , its depth or its speed decreases in order to keep the same number of gallons per second moving downstream . as a particular nuclear example",
    ", a factor of 100 decrease in the @xmath50ar abundance compensates the factor of 100 increase in the @xmath51 reaction rate in a steady flow .",
    "a large uncertainty in the @xmath52 rate would thus certainly be important for the yield of @xmath50ar , but it is essentially irrelevant for our chosen observable , the @xmath0ti yield .",
    "these considerations illustrate the importance of clearly defining the observable when discussing the importance of particular nuclear reactions .",
    "table [ tab : tabzrank ] ranks by element the @xmath0ti yield variation resulting from the survey over each element .",
    "the percent change is the increase in @xmath0ti yield divided by the reference value , in parts per hundred .",
    "a large variation for a given element means that the final @xmath0ti yield is sensitive to at least one reaction rate on some isotope of that element .",
    "the next task is to identify the key isotope . for each element showing a large @xmath0ti - yield variation , we performed an isotope search by multiplying all reactions on a given isotope of that element @xmath47 by a factor of 0.01 and rerunning the alpha - rich freezeout",
    "this was repeated for each isotope of the element @xmath47 in the network . after completing the isotope survey for element @xmath47",
    ", we surveyed the next important element .",
    "this entire procedure was then repeated but with a factor 100 multiplying the reaction rates .",
    "figure [ fig : asurv ] shows the results for the isotope surveys for ar , ca , ti , and v for both the 0.01 and 100 factors .",
    "it demonstrates that the @xmath0ti yield significantly varies for changes on only one isotope of each of the elements . for the elements shown ,",
    "these are @xmath50ar , @xmath16ca , @xmath0ti , and @xmath11v .",
    "table [ tab : tabasurv ] ranks the particular isotopes for the 0.01 and 100 reaction - rate variation surveys . comparing the first entries of tables [ tab : tabzrank ] and [ tab : tabasurv ] , for example , shows that a 100-fold decrease of the reaction rates for all ti isotopes produces an almost identical increase ( + 373% ) in final @xmath0ti abundance , in comparison to the increase ( + 372% ) for the @xmath0ti reaction rate only .    with the key isotopes",
    "now identified , we next determined which particular nuclear reaction dominated the sensitivity of the @xmath0ti yield .",
    "this step of the survey , similar to that done above , varied a specific reaction on the key isotope .",
    "the first such survey was of the nuclear reactions on @xmath11v .",
    "we multiplied the @xmath53 rate by a factor of 0.01 and reran the alpha - rich freezeout .",
    "we then repeated this for the @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 reactions .",
    "we did this for each isotope listed in table [ tab : tabasurv ] .",
    "we then repeated the procedure with a multiplication factor 100 .",
    "the results for the surveys on @xmath16ca , @xmath0ti , @xmath11ti , and @xmath59fe are shown in figure [ fig : rsurv ] .",
    "its discrete abscissa is the reaction channel for that isotope .",
    "the results clearly show that the @xmath0ti yield is sensitive to variations in the rates of the particular reactions @xmath60ti , @xmath61v , @xmath62cr , @xmath63cr , and @xmath64ni .",
    "table [ tab : rsurvlowhigh ] ranks the particular nuclear reactions according to their influence at @xmath6=0 on the final @xmath0ti yield .",
    "for example , reduction of @xmath65 has almost no effect ( unless of course the @xmath58 branch is also reduced ) , whereas increase of its rate by 100@xmath2 is almost as effective as an increase of the @xmath58 channel .",
    "such conclusions depend on the relative magnitude of proton and gamma widths of the compound nuclear states , and on the factor by which they are altered . owing to its special role in the late assembly of heavy nuclei",
    ", we also surveyed the triple-@xmath7 reaction and include it in table [ tab : rsurvlowhigh ] .",
    "one might have predicted that a number of these reactions would be important , although the magnitude of their effects would not have been as easy to guess .",
    "the @xmath63cr reaction , the one showing the largest effect , however , was not one for which we had anticipated a special role .",
    "this underscores the importance of making a systematic survey when considering the reaction - rate sensitivity of a particular observable .",
    "in fact , not only are systematic surveys important for clearly delineating reaction - rate sensitivities , but they can also clarify nucleosynthesis .",
    "it was only after developing new insights into the nuclear dynamics of an alpha - rich freezeout that we were able to understand the reason for the importance of the @xmath11v(p,@xmath1)@xmath12cr reaction . by the same token",
    "we can understand why its importance vanishes for neutron richness @xmath660.0004 ( see section 6 ) .",
    "we return to this issue in the next section .",
    "the remaining task for the @xmath0ti survey was to determine the form of the sensitivity of each particular important reaction .",
    "figure [ fig : rsurv ] shows that increasing the @xmath67cr reaction by a factor of 100 decreases the resulting @xmath0ti yield by a factor of nearly 50 .",
    "this suggests a nearly linear dependence of the @xmath0ti yield on the rate of this reaction . for a decrease by a factor of 100 on this rate , however , the @xmath0ti yield increases by less than a factor of two , suggesting a non - linear dependence .",
    "the yield dependence on the rate value determines its significance . to quantify the form of the dependence",
    ", the alpha - rich freezeout was repeated many times , each time with a specific important nuclear reaction rate multiplied by a factor between 0.01 and 100 .",
    "this maps out the sensitivity of the @xmath0ti yield to any change by a factor between 0.01 and 100 on the important nuclear reactions .",
    "figures [ fig:45pg ] , [ fig:3alpha ] , [ fig:44ag ] , and [ fig:44ap ] show results of such surveys . in each of these figures ,",
    "a small solid square indicates the result using the `` standard '' value for that particular rate .",
    "these figures illuminate more subtle aspects of the reaction rate sensitivities .",
    "figure [ fig:45pg ] shows that a factor of two increase or decrease in the @xmath63cr rate results in a @xmath68 change in the yield of @xmath0ti . on the other hand , figure [ fig:44ag ] shows that a factor of two change in the @xmath69 reaction rate barely changes the @xmath0ti yield , even though a factor of 100 increase in the rate dramatically drops the yield .",
    "because the reaction rates we use are either experimentally known or among the best theoretical estimates presently available , we expect the true rates in general not to be more than , say , an order of magnitude different . thus , the quantity expressing the @xmath0ti - sensitivity to a particular reaction near its reference value is the slope of the curve for that reaction , in analogy to figure [ fig:45pg ] . in table",
    "[ tab : tabslope ] we present these quantities , in a ranking by magnitude , for the sixteen most important reactions at @xmath6=0 insofar as final @xmath0ti abundance is concerned .",
    "as an example of how to use table [ tab : tabslope ] , consider the case of @xmath63cr .",
    "if it were measured , one would then compare that rate ( especially near @xmath70 for reasons to be discussed in the next section ) to the value used in our surveys , the fits for which we present in table [ tab : ourrates ] .",
    "if the measured rate were a factor of 1.5 greater than the tabulated value for all temperatures , the resulting @xmath0ti yield would change by @xmath71% , that is , it would be 82% of the standard value .",
    "it was only through a large and systematic survey that we were able to determine the relative importance of the reactions listed in table [ tab : tabslope ] .",
    "this was a computationally intensive effort comprising more than 2000 sets of alpha - rich freezeout calculations , each taking @xmath3020 minutes on a 200 mhz dec alpha workstation .",
    "nevertheless , it is only in this way that one can be fully confident of understanding the reaction - rate sensitivity of the @xmath0ti yield .    a final part of the survey applies to neutron - excess @xmath6 greater than zero .",
    "the survey is repeated in summary form in section 6 for @xmath6 = 0.002 and @xmath6 = 0.006 . for these neutron enrichments , @xmath0ti synthesis",
    "was unaffected by the value of the @xmath11v(p,@xmath1)@xmath12cr reaction rate , a result also explained in section 6 . but first we describe the reasons for the importance of the table [ tab : rsurvlowhigh ] reactions at @xmath6 = 0 .",
    "table [ tab : tabslope ] lists the reactions to which the @xmath72 yield is most sensitive in an alpha - rich freezeout . in this section",
    ", we briefly explore the reasons for this sensitivity for three important reactions .",
    "in addition to the immediate interest of understanding the importance of these reactions , this exercise provides new insights into the nuclear dynamics of the alpha - rich freezeout .",
    "any nucleosynthetic system seeks to maximize its entropy and thereby to achieve an equilibrium .",
    "its ability to do this , however , is governed by the rate of certain key reactions . when a particular reaction becomes too slow , the equilibrium breaks .",
    "the system still maximizes the entropy , but the slowness of the particular reaction adds a constraint which restricts the number of accessible states ( @xcite ) . as the system evolves toward lower temperatures , more reactions",
    "become slow , more equilibria break , and more constraints are added to the entropy maximum . in this way",
    ", the system descends the `` hierarchy of statistical equilibria '' ( contribution of meyer in @xcite ) .",
    "several of the reactions in table [ tab : tabslope ] are important because they control the breaking of equilibria and , thus , the descent of the hierarchy .",
    "other reactions are important because they control when the steady ( but non - equilibrium ) flow into @xmath0ti breaks down or because they control the economy of light particles that influence the abundance of @xmath0ti late in the expansion .",
    "we begin with the triple-@xmath7 reaction .",
    "figure [ fig : triple - a ] shows the time history of the @xmath0ti mass fraction during two alpha - rich freezeouts ",
    "one with the standard ( @xcite ) rate ( dashed curve ) and one with the standard rate increased by a factor of 100 ( solid curve ) . for comparison ,",
    "the dotted curve gives the @xmath0ti mass fraction in nse .",
    "this nse is calculated at each timestep in the expansion using the same temperature , density , and neutron richness as in the network .",
    "the dashed and solid curves differ throughout the expansions . in the case with the increased triple-@xmath7 rate ,",
    "the nuclear system achieves and maintains nse for the early part of the expansion . with the standard triple-@xmath7 rate , the system never reaches nse but rather only a qse in which the number of heavy nuclei @xmath40 differs from that in nse .",
    "below @xmath73 the number of heavy nuclei in the standard run qse is less than that in nse , so the heavy nuclei are in the presence of an overabundance ( relative to nse ) of light particles .",
    "this favors nuclei heavier than @xmath0ti ( e.g. @xmath74ni ) , so the @xmath0ti mass fraction is far below that of nse until later in the expansion when the large qse breaks and the @xmath0ti can build back up without being driven upward to @xmath74ni .    the @xmath0ti mass fraction in the standard calculation is less than that in the case with the increased triple-@xmath7 reaction for @xmath75 .",
    "the latter expansion deviates from nse beginning at @xmath76 . at this point",
    "the nuclear system is also in a qse , but this qse has a greater number of heavy nuclei and a smaller number of light particles than the standard case qse .",
    "this yields a greater mass fraction of @xmath0ti within the qse cluster . at the point",
    "@xmath0ti breaks out of the large qse cluster containing @xmath74ni ( the dip in both curves near @xmath77 ) , the @xmath0ti mass fraction in the expansion with the increased triple-@xmath7 rate exceeds that in the standard case by a factor of @xmath30 eight .",
    "more importantly , the expansion with the increased triple-@xmath7 rate has a factor of @xmath78 lower mass fraction of @xmath79he .",
    "remarkably , this factor of 4.6 ( when cubed ) compensates for the increased triple-@xmath7 cross section ; thus , the two expansions create new nuclei at the nearly the same rate at late times .",
    "the crucial aspect for @xmath0ti is that the lower @xmath79he abundance in the expansion with the increased triple-@xmath7 cross section requires larger abundances of nuclei between @xmath9c and @xmath74ni to carry the same flow .",
    "this causes the increase in the final yield of @xmath0ti .",
    "figure [ fig : ti44ap ] shows the @xmath0ti mass fraction in the standard calculation ( dashed curve ) and in an expansion with the @xmath81 rate increased by a factor of 100 . also shown as the dotted curve is the qse mass fraction of @xmath0ti in the standard expansion calculated at each timestep from the same temperature , density , neutron richness , and number of heavy nuclei as in the network .",
    "the evolution of the @xmath0ti mass fraction follows qse in both cases down to @xmath82 . the increased @xmath83 rate",
    ", however , allows the @xmath0ti to remain in qse with @xmath74ni longer ; thus , when the qse finally breaks , the @xmath0ti mass fraction is @xmath84 times lower than the corresponding value in the standard case .",
    "this result illustrates the important role @xmath80 plays in linking the si - ca qse cluster to the ni - centered qse cluster ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "once the two clusters fall out of equilibrium with each other , the @xmath80 reaction governs the rate at which abundance moves from the si - ca - ti cluster to the ni cluster .",
    "a faster rate gives a lower abundance in the si - ca - ti cluster and a lower @xmath0ti yield .",
    "perhaps the biggest surprise in our survey was the importance of the @xmath85 reaction .",
    "figure [ fig : v45pg ] shows the @xmath0ti mass fraction for the standard calculation ( dashed curve ) and for an expansion with the @xmath86 increased by a factor of 100 .",
    "the @xmath0ti evolution is precisely the same in the two expansions down to @xmath87 .",
    "the subsequent deviation between the two cases , however , is dramatic .",
    "while the @xmath0ti mass fraction drops by @xmath88 as @xmath89 falls below 2 in the standard calculation , it plummets by a factor of @xmath90 for the increased @xmath85 rate .",
    "the reason is , as in the previous cases , that this reaction controls the breaking of an equilibrium .",
    "the equilibrium of importance in this case is a @xmath91 equilibrium among the @xmath92 isotones . in such equilibrium ,",
    "the rates ( as opposed to the cross sections ) of ( p,@xmath1 ) reactions proceed at the same rates as the reverse ( @xmath1,p ) reactions ; i.e. @xmath93z + p @xmath94 @xmath95(z+1 ) + @xmath1 , where the reversed arrows indicate equal numbers of reactions per unit time .",
    "we focus on the n = 22 isotones , a = z + 22 .",
    "figure [ fig : pgequil ] shows how this equilibrium breaks for the standard set of cross sections .",
    "it gives for four temperatures the ratio of the network abundance of these isotones to the values they would have in @xmath91 equilibrium . for @xmath96 , all of the isotones for ti through fe are in equilibrium with each other under exchange of protons , but the lower - charge isotones have already broken out of this equilibrium . as the temperature falls to @xmath97 , @xmath10fe strongly falls out of equilibrium with the other four species , but also evident is the fact that the two small equilibrium clusters ( @xmath0ti & @xmath11v ) and ( @xmath12cr & @xmath8mn ) are starting to fall out of equilibrium with each other ; that is , @xmath11v and @xmath12cr are no longer in @xmath91 equilibrium with each other .",
    "this break grows with decreasing temperature . by @xmath98 the two small @xmath91 clusters , ( @xmath0ti & @xmath11v ) and ( @xmath12cr & @xmath8mn ) , are strongly out of equilibrium with each other .",
    "when this occurs , @xmath99 produces net destruction of @xmath11v , and hence of @xmath0ti , with which it is in equilibrium .",
    "the @xmath98 panel of this figure shows that the @xmath0ti-@xmath11v cluster is overabundant and the @xmath12cr-@xmath8mn cluster is underabundant with respect to the overall @xmath91 equilibrium .",
    "this indicates that too few nuclei have moved from the @xmath0ti-@xmath11v cluster up to the @xmath12cr-@xmath8mn cluster because of the slowness of the reaction that links them , namely , @xmath63cr . by increasing the rate of this reaction ,",
    "the two small clusters remain in equilibrium with each other longer , the @xmath92 isotones shift to higher mass , and more @xmath0ti is destroyed .",
    "the dotted curve in figure [ fig : v45pg ] amplifies this point by showing what would happen in the standard case to the @xmath0ti mass fraction if the @xmath91 equilibrium among @xmath92 isotones persisted to low temperature .",
    "the faster @xmath100cr reaction allows the @xmath0ti to remain in the @xmath91 equilibrium to lower temperature . because the @xmath91 equilibrium abundances shift to higher mass with lower temperature , the @xmath0ti mass fraction falls . even with the fast @xmath63cr reaction , however , the equilibrium eventually breaks and the @xmath0ti mass fraction freezes out . in the surveys at greater neutron excess to follow , we demonstrate that the controlling significance of @xmath11v(p,@xmath1)@xmath12cr vanishes for @xmath13 0.0004 .",
    "this will be understood as a consequence of the smaller free proton density with increased @xmath6 .",
    "we repeated the surveys in exactly the same procedure for a nuclear gas containing more neutrons than protons in total .",
    "this initial neutron richness , when the shock wave strikes the overlying matter , is not altered during the subsequent rapid nuclear burning , which occurs too rapidly for significant electron capture to occur .",
    "thus the gas can be described by a constant parameter @xmath101 , where @xmath102 and @xmath103 are the mass fractions of nucleons ( both bound in species @xmath104 and free ) and @xmath105 is the abundance of species @xmath104 with mass fractions @xmath106 and atomic mass number @xmath107 .",
    "the survey shows that although most nuclear reactions retain their importance for @xmath0ti production during alpha - rich freezeouts , the @xmath11v(p,@xmath1)@xmath12cr reaction is very sensitive to the value of @xmath6 . demonstrating and understanding these facts is the main goal of this section .",
    "the range of anticipated values for @xmath6 is set by the presupernova evolution and structure and by the strength of the shock wave .",
    "the latter determines how far radially the shock can propagate with sufficient strength to establish an alpha - rich freezeout , without which the yield of @xmath0ti is too small to contribute substantially to the natural @xmath0ca abundance . within the entire he core of massive stars",
    "the matter is dominated by he , @xmath108n , @xmath15o and @xmath9c , all of which have @xmath109 . but within the co core @xmath6 has been increased by the conversion of @xmath108n to @xmath110o and @xmath111ne , both of which have two excess neutrons . at solar initial metallicity ( @xmath112 )",
    "these comprise about 2% by mass , so that @xmath113 throughout the co core .",
    "supernovae of lower initial metallicity @xmath103 , such as supernova 1987a in the magellanic cloud , will have @xmath6 near @xmath114 in their co cores .",
    "hydrostatic carbon burning does not much increase @xmath6 within the nemg core , but hydrostatic o burning does do so .",
    "the more central core in which o has burned to create a si core has acquired more excess neutrons by electron captures on the products of o burning ( @xcite ) , yielding @xmath6 in the range 0.003 - 0.006 . in the interests of limiting the computational demands , we have performed the full survey at the values @xmath6 = 0.002 and 0.006 .",
    "finer precision mapping in @xmath6 was also done for the @xmath11v(p,@xmath1)@xmath12cr reaction alone , after determining its sensitivity to the neutron excess .",
    "tables [ tab : rsurvlowhigh2 ] and [ tab : rsurvlowhigh6 ] list the effect of reaction rate changes for the ten most important regulators of @xmath0ti production at these two values of @xmath6 . many of the same reactions remain important , such as @xmath0ti(@xmath7,p)@xmath8v , @xmath16ca(@xmath7,@xmath1)@xmath0ti , and @xmath50ar(@xmath7,p)@xmath115k ; but the importance of @xmath11v(p,@xmath1)@xmath12cr disappears and some new important reactions appear ( e.g. @xmath9c(@xmath7,@xmath1)@xmath15o ) .",
    "more complete lists can be read and downloaded from the clemson nuclear astrophysics web site ( http://photon.phys.clemson.edu/tables.html ) .    in the interest of understanding we comment upon two of these dramatic changes . the importance of the @xmath11v(p,@xmath1)@xmath12cr reaction declines precipitously for @xmath13 0.0001 , as shown in figure [ fig : v45pgeta ] .",
    "the cause is the decline of the free - proton abundance @xmath116 at every temperature with increasing @xmath6 .",
    "as @xmath6 increases , protons tend to be more tightly bound in nuclei . although the @xmath0ti-@xmath11v pair remain in @xmath54 equilibrium down to @xmath117 2 for @xmath6 as large as @xmath118 , the @xmath11v abundance is declining with increasing @xmath6 due to the diminishing free proton abundance . as a result",
    "the final proton captures are unable to reduce the abundance of the @xmath0ti-@xmath11v pair during the freezeout .",
    "figure [ fig : v45pgeta ] shows the free proton abundance at @xmath70 , the temperature at which the @xmath54 equilibrium begins its freezeout , for several calculations at different @xmath6 s . in the equilibrium , the abundance ratio @xmath11v/@xmath0ti @xmath119 .",
    "the @xmath11v(p,@xmath1)@xmath12cr reaction rate is also proportional to @xmath116 ; thus , the importance of this reaction rate in modifying the final @xmath0ti yield goes as @xmath120 .",
    "the fact that @xmath116 at @xmath89 = 2 drops off so rapidly for @xmath121 explains why the final @xmath0ti yield sensitivity also declines so quickly .",
    "the consequence is that the @xmath11v(p,@xmath1)@xmath12cr reaction loses considerable importance for observations of @xmath0ti in supernovae , at least unless they have very small initial metallicity , or unless the shock wave is able to reach the he shell , or unless some other process keeps the proton abundance higher than would be expected simply from the alpha - rich freezeout .",
    "it is worth noting that some type ia events create abundant @xmath0ti ( @xcite ) ; but the burning is not literally an alpha - rich freezeout although it does have hot excess alpha particles .",
    "a variety of @xmath6 s might be expected in this scenario depending on the initial composition . for low @xmath6",
    "we will again expect certain proton capture reactions to affect the @xmath0ti yield",
    ". we will study the important cross sections for many observables in this setting in a subsequent work in this series .",
    "the @xmath9c(@xmath7,@xmath1)@xmath15o reaction assumes greater importance for @xmath122 .",
    "the greater neutron richness of the matter causes alpha particles to bind more tightly into nuclei , thereby decreasing the alpha particle abundance throughout most of the expansion . because of the smaller alpha particle abundance , flow of newly assembled nuclei to higher mass freezes out at higher temperature .",
    "when the cross section for alpha particle capture on @xmath9c is decreased , this freezeout occurs even earlier , leading to considerably reduced @xmath0ti production .",
    "we have analyzed the influence of individual reaction rates on @xmath0ti production in alpha - rich freezeouts within type ii supernova events . using direct surveys",
    "we have established that the @xmath0ti production at @xmath6 = 0 is most sensitive to the following reaction rates : @xmath11v(p,@xmath1)@xmath12cr , @xmath7(2@xmath7,@xmath1)@xmath9c , @xmath0ti(@xmath7,p)@xmath8v , @xmath0ti(@xmath7,@xmath1)@xmath10cr , @xmath16ca(@xmath7,@xmath1)@xmath0ti , and @xmath31co(p , n)@xmath31ni . for @xmath13",
    "0 the two proton - induced reactions decline rapidly in importance and some other reactions become crucial : @xmath9c(@xmath7,@xmath1)@xmath15o , @xmath16ca(@xmath7,@xmath1)@xmath0ti , @xmath17al(@xmath7,n)@xmath18p , and @xmath18si(@xmath7,n)@xmath19s .",
    "several good reasons justify this effort at a depth of detail and computational time that exceeds that normally devoted to nuclear studies in astrophysics .",
    "three main reasons are : ( 1 ) to provide guidelines for laboratory measurements ; ( 2 ) to establish better diagnostics of supernova events ; ( 3 ) to gain insight into complicated and nonlinear nuclear reaction networks of importance for nucleosynthesis .",
    "the first reason parallels the large increase in recent activity in laboratory nuclear astrophysics .",
    "in particular , many new radioactive - ion - beam facilities are rapidly establishing the capability to measure reaction cross sections near and on the proton - rich side of the @xmath123 line .",
    "this capability opens to experimental study nucleosynthesis processes that have heretofore had to rely on computed cross sections .",
    "each such experiment will be costly and time consuming , however , so that solid grounds for the importance of any specific reaction are welcome to experimental planners .",
    "the second reason parallels the large increase in recent observations of supernova nucleosynthesis .",
    "although the mass of @xmath0ti within the cas a supernova 310-year - old remnant can not yet be regarded as measured with good precision , the recent detection of it insures that it eventually will be well measured .",
    "when that precision has been achieved , the mass of @xmath0ti will reflect the alpha - rich - freezeout mass that was ejected .",
    "since this mass depends in exciting ways on the physics that underlies the type ii event ( the mass cut and the shock mechanism ) , all manner of exciting issues may hinge upon its production .",
    "the same will be true for the several recent galactic supernovae that will be detected with the improved gamma - ray detector sensitivity that now exists in laboratories .",
    "it is probable that significant variations of the @xmath0ti yield exist between different events .",
    "once that observational goal is achieved , the most accurate cross sections will be wanted so that the scientific uncertainties reflect the uncertainties over the realistic supernova model rather than over the nuclear cross sections .",
    "similar excitement attends the measurement of @xmath0ti/@xmath10ti production ratios in samples of supernova matter as recorded by supernova condensates found in meteorites .",
    "one does not want nuclear cross section uncertainties to stand in the way of quantitative analysis .",
    "the third reason parallels the large recent increase in the sophistication with which nucleosynthesis is viewed .",
    "the present study illuminates this very well . within the complex networks of explosive nucleosynthesis",
    ", one can ideally think of the importance of any specific nuclear reaction in various ways .",
    "it may have almost no significance if that reaction maintains a partial qse throughout the burning .",
    "when qse breaks down or fragments , a reaction may play a rather complicated role in governing the changing relative total numbers within the different qse clusters ; or it may play a role in the density of free light particles ; or it may simply be the specific channel by which an abundance is altered in the freezeout .",
    "the important reactions identified by us for @xmath0ti production in the alpha - rich freezeout reveal each of these aspects .",
    "we have discussed these to some extent in the discussions of the important reactions .",
    "finally we would observe that our study concentrated on one very important nucleus within one nucleosynthesis process .",
    "there are many nucleosynthesis processes producing many different nuclei , so additional studies of the present type are recommended .",
    "this requires judgment as well as computing power .",
    "clearly one does not wish to have huge numbers of irrelevant studies performed .",
    "for this reason , such studies should follow the `` four - requirement '' structure outlined in  2.2 .",
