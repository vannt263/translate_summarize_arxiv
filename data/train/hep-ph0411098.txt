    "the standard model ( sm ) includes three generations of quark doublets . however , our world consists of only @xmath3 and @xmath4 quarks , the lightest flavours of the first generation .",
    "this occurs through quark - generation mixings in charge - changing weak decays .",
    "the quark mixings can not be predicted within the sm and they are matter of experimental investigations and theoretical speculations .    if there exist only three quark generations , then the transition probability , for example , of @xmath5-quark @xmath3 to all @xmath6-quarks @xmath4 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 should be equal to one @xmath9 this unitarity condition can be tested experimentally .    already in the 1990 s",
    "@xcite it was noted that there is a small deviation from unitarity .",
    "therefore , this issue is attracting great interest and lots of experimental efforts were made to understand this problem . at present experimental accuracy of @xmath1 and @xmath10 determination , the third matrix element @xmath11 can be safely neglected in ( [ unitarity ] ) , thanks to its small value , and the problem is reduced to a verification of a simple trigonometrical identity @xmath12 for the cabibbo angle @xmath13 .",
    "therefore , an independent and self - consistent determination of the first two matrix elements is of great importance .    at present , after a first indication from the e865 collaboration  @xcite that the value of @xmath10 could be higher than the pdg value 0.2196(23 )  @xcite , other experiments  @xcite also confirm this result .",
    "reanalysis of the hyperon beta decay  @xcite also leads to a somewhat higher value of @xmath14 , which is in better agreement with the unitarity condition ( [ cabibbo ] ) .",
    "this value surprisingly coincides with the value 0.2238(30 )  @xcite determined from the ratio of experimental kaon and pion decay widths @xmath15 @xmath16  @xcite using the lattice calculations of the pseudoscalar decay constant ratio @xmath17  @xcite and assuming unitarity .",
    "all these facts indicate a higher value of @xmath10 and hence the unitarity problem does not exist .",
    "meanwhile , different experiments have been dedicated to independent determinations of the first matrix element @xmath1 .",
    "the most precise result , @xmath18 , comes from a series of experiments on super - allowed @xmath2 fermi transitions  @xcite .",
    "recently , @xmath19 has been derived , on a comparable precision level , from the polarized neutron decay  @xcite .",
    "a compatible but less precise result @xmath20  @xcite has been achieved by measuring the rare pion beta decay .",
    "although the unitarity problem is certainly solved by now , another problem is probably emerging in connection with a very precise determination of the first matrix element from the super - allowed @xmath2 fermi transitions and from the polarized neutron decay .",
    "the present measurements indicate a 2@xmath21 difference for the extracted @xmath1 . the situation can be clarified in the future with new experiments for measurements of the angular correlation coefficient @xmath22 and the asymmetry parameter @xmath23 in the neutron beta decay at the sub-10@xmath24 level  @xcite .",
    "this paper is dedicated to the prediction of an eventual discrepancy in @xmath1 extracted from the super - allowed @xmath25 fermi transitions and from the polarized neutron decay .",
    "the key difference between these two methods is related to the fact that polarization phenomena are very sensitive to chiral structures other than @xmath26 .",
    "therefore , a possible new tensor interaction , which explains the anomaly in the radiative pion decay  @xcite , can be responsible for this discrepancy .",
    "a determination of the strength of the @xmath27 quark transition with respect to the pure leptonic transition can be made using absolute measurements , _",
    "e.g. _  partial widths or ( and ) lifetime .",
    "since the neutron has only one decay mode , @xmath28 , precise measurements of its mean lifetime are absolutely necessary .",
    "nevertheless , the knowledge of only this parameter can not allow us to determine @xmath1 , because in the sm the neutron lifetime @xmath29 , @xmath30 depends also on the phenomenological parameter @xmath31 , the ratio of the axial coupling constant to the vector coupling constant .",
    "fortunately , in the neutron decay several observables are accessible to experiments , which also depend on the same parameter @xmath31 .",
    "for example , the decay probability for a polarized neutron can be written  @xcite as @xmath32 , \\label{aabd}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is the neutron polarization .",
    "the correlation coefficients @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 in the sm are given by the relations : @xmath36 a non - zero value of the triple correlation coefficient @xmath35 would indicate @xmath37-violation ; however , in the sm its value is predicted to be vanishingly small .",
    "present experiments confirm this statement at the level of about 0.1% .",
    "therefore , in the following we will consider the parameter @xmath31 to be a real constant .",
    "taking into account the current world average value for @xmath38  @xcite we can estimate the sensitivity of the correlation coefficients to this parameter @xmath39 the parameters most sensitive to @xmath31 appear to be the angular correlation coefficient @xmath22 and the asymmetry parameter @xmath23 .",
    "therefore , in the following we will concentrate only on these correlation coefficients .",
    "the recent results of the pibeta experiment on radiative pion decay  @xcite strongly suggest the presence of non-(@xmath26 ) anomalous interaction  @xcite @xmath40 with dimensionless coupling constant @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the momentum transfer between quarks and leptons .",
    "it is obvious that the same interaction will affect all observables of the neutron decay : the lifetime ( [ lifetime ] ) and the decay distribution  ( [ aabd ] ) .    in order to apply this interaction to the neutron decay we estimate the matrix element @xmath43 using the technique of ref .",
    "@xcite with @xmath44 for the current quark masses @xmath45 mev at 1 gev  @xcite .",
    "this leads to a new matrix element in the neutron decay @xmath46 with an effective coupling constant @xmath47 , which is an order of the recoil effects @xmath48 .",
    "it is worth while to note that the matrix element ( [ mt ] ) consists of two different terms with opposite nucleon chiralities @xmath49 the first term ( [ mtl ] ) is the usual local tensor matrix element , which has been used in the literature for testing a possible effect of new interactions . the second term ( [ mtr ] ) is a new non - local tensor matrix element originated from the non - local quark interaction ( [ new ] ) , which has been constructed so as to avoid the constraints from the ordinary pion decay  @xcite .",
    "taking into account the new matrix element ( [ mt ] ) , the differential energy distribution of an unpolarized neutron decay at rest reads @xmath50\\lambda \\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\hspace{-0.2cm}f_t^2\\left\\{2e_e\\left(e_{m}-e_e\\right)-\\frac{q^2+m^2_e}{4 } -\\left[e_{m}\\left(e_{m}-2e_e\\right)-\\frac{m_e^2}{2}\\right]\\frac{m_e^2}{q^2 } -e^2_{m}\\frac{m_e^4}{q^4}\\right\\}\\ ! , \\label{g0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath51 is the maximum electron energy , and the squared momentum transfer @xmath52 is connected to the proton kinetic energy  @xmath37 or to the electron  antineutrino angular correlation @xmath53 .    the first line in the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ g0 ] ) is the sm contribution in the limit of the non - relativistic nucleons .",
    "the second line presents the contribution from an interference between the sm matrix element and the new tensor matrix element ( [ mt ] ) .",
    "as expected this contribution is proportional to @xmath31 , because the tensor interaction interferes only with the gamow ",
    "teller amplitude .",
    "it consists of two terms : the well - known fierz interference term and the new contribution from the tensor interaction with opposite nucleon chiralities ( [ mtr ] ) .",
    "the third line stems from the square of the new matrix element ( [ mt ] ) and can be safely neglected thanks to the second - order contribution of the small parameter @xmath54 .    on the one hand angular correlation measurements have the advantage that it is not necessary to deal with a polarized neutron . on the other hand ,",
    "since the antineutrino is not registered , only indirect methods have been employed through a detection of low - energy recoil protons .",
    "the present accuracy of @xmath22 does not exceed 5% , which corresponds to a worse @xmath31 uncertainty @xmath55 than that extracted from the asymmetry parameter @xmath23  @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , new experiments have been proposed @xcite with an improved accuracy of @xmath22-measurements , using different experimental methods .",
    "the aim of the collaboration  @xcite is to use the neutron decay spectrometer @xmath22spect to improve the precision of @xmath22 by more than an order of magnitude , relying on the method based on measurements of the proton kinetic energy spectrum .",
    "however , even at this precision , it will be impossible to detect the contribution of the new matrix element ( [ mt ] ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that an integration over the electron energy spectrum leads to a zero result for the interference term in the second line in eq .",
    "( [ g0 ] ) , because the two different contributions cancel each other .",
    "therefore , the new tensor interaction ( [ mt ] ) does not distort the recoil proton spectrum and does not contribute to the neutron lifetime .",
    "the results of the experiment should correspond to the sm predictions .",
    "a different situation may occur in the case of direct measurements of @xmath22 by recording the spectrum of electrons emitted into a given range of angles referred to the proton momentum @xcite",
    ". however , the expected 1% accuracy in the value of @xmath22 will probably be insufficient to detect the effect of the new tensor interaction ( [ mt ] ) due to small coupling constant @xmath54 .",
    "the decay of the polarized neutron allows us to extract @xmath31 only from the well - measured electron spectrum @xmath56 where @xmath57\\lambda \\label{ge0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] can be obtained from eq .",
    "( [ g0 ] ) , neglecting the last term and integrating over @xmath58 . here",
    "the functions @xmath59 and @xmath60 are related to the maximum @xmath61 and the minimum @xmath62 of the squared momentum transfer .    the anisotropic distribution in the presence of the new tensor interaction ( [ mt ] )",
    "can be easily calculated :    @xmath63 \\frac{m^2_e}{b}\\ln\\left|\\frac{a+b}{a - b}\\right| \\right . \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\hspace{1.1cm}-\\left.\\left[e_e\\left(e_m+e_e\\right)-\\frac{m^2_e}{2 } -\\left(e^2_m-\\frac{m^2_e}{4}\\right)\\frac{m^2_e}{b}\\ln\\left|\\frac{a+b}{a - b}\\right| \\right]\\lambda\\right\\ } , \\label{ga}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where only the sm contribution and the leading - order term in @xmath54 are shown as well .",
    "this new term stems only from the interference between the sm matrix element and the tensor interaction for the transition of the right - handed neutron to the left - handed proton ( [ mtr ] ) .",
    "it is absent in the usual case of the local tensor matrix element for the transition of the left - handed neutron to the right - handed proton ( [ mtl ] ) .    the new contribution in eq .",
    "( [ ga ] ) is negative over the whole electron spectrum and it leads effectively to a larger absolute value of the asymmetry parameter @xmath23 than in the sm for the same parameter @xmath31 .",
    "therefore , to extract the right value of @xmath31 , the experimental asymmetry should be fitted according to eqs .",
    "( [ ge ] ) , ( [ ge0 ] ) , ( [ ga ] ) , taking into account the contribution of the new tensor interaction .    to estimate the effect of this interaction we plot in fig .  1 the ratio of the asymmetry parameter @xmath64 to its value @xmath65 at @xmath66 for the region of the electron spectrum fitted by the perkeo ii collaboration  @xcite .",
    "it shows in average 0.7% systematic contribution from the tensor interaction , which is the same as the accuracy of the experiment .",
    "therefore , the real value of the measured parameter @xmath67 can be obtained from the experimental value @xmath68 by shifting it down with the value of the experimental accuracy , @xmath69 .",
    "taking into account all effects from the radiative corrections and the phase - space factor , and also the fact that the new tensor interaction does not affect , in the leading order , the neutron lifetime , eq .",
    "( [ lifetime ] ) can be rewritten as  @xcite @xmath70 using @xmath71 and @xmath67 , it leads to the corrected value @xmath72 extracted from the polarized neutron decay , which is in a better agreement with @xmath73 extracted from super - allowed beta decays .",
    "recently strong evidence for a deviation from the sm has been obtained by the pibeta collaboration  @xcite .",
    "namely , the sm fails to describe the energy distribution and the branching ratio of the radiative decays of positive pions at rest in the high-@xmath74/low-@xmath75 kinematic region of the dalitz plot .",
    "the previous experiment , performed by the istra collaboration  @xcite , testing the radiative decays of negative pions in flight in a wide kinematic region , had announced the same effect , although statistically less significant .",
    "the present pibeta result  @xcite indicates a deficit of the branching ratio of the radiative pion decay in the specified kinematic region at the @xmath76 level with respect to the sm prediction , while in the other kinematic regions both the branching ratios and the energy distributions are compatible with the interaction .",
    "the anomaly observed by the istra collaboration has been explained in the framework of an extended theory of the electroweak interactions , with a new type of fundamental particles ",
    "chiral spin-1 bosons  @xcite described by antisymmetric second - rank tensor fields .",
    "an exchange of these particles leads effectively to the phenomenological tensor interaction ( [ new ] ) .",
    "the same interaction should contribute to the neutron decay as well .",
    "however , it has been shown here that with the present experimental accuracy we can not conclude definitely about their presence in the neutron decay .",
    "the only hint of their manifestation is the partial explanation of the about 2@xmath21 discrepancy in @xmath1 extracted from the polarized neutron decay and from the super - allowed beta decays",
    ". probably , new experiments under construction , _ e.g.  _ the unca and the abba , using new spallation neutron source facilities and aiming at high - precision measurements of the neutron decay parameters , could definitely confirm or reject the predicted distortions of the spectrum due to the new tensor interaction .",
    "based on the universality of couplings of the new chiral bosons to leptons and quarks , the extended electroweak model  @xcite predicts an admixture of analogous tensor interactions in pure lepton processes  @xcite .",
    "however , at present it is not easy to detect them in the ordinary muon decay  @xcite as well .",
    "meanwhile , the new tensor interaction ( [ new ] ) , with the same effective coupling constant , allows us to explain  @xcite the painful widely commented discrepancy in the two - pion spectral functions extracted from the @xmath77 annihilation and from the @xmath78-decay .",
    "it is hoped that future experiments will clarify this situation better .",
