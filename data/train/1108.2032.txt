    "the young massive hd97950 star cluster in the giant hii region ngc3603 is located in the sagittarius - carina arm of the milky way .",
    "this cluster is one of the most massive young star clusters in the galaxy ( @xmath13 , harayama et al .",
    "the cluster hosts ten times more ob stars than the orion nebula cluster ( onc ) , including the two most massive binaries currently known in the galaxy ( schnurr et al .",
    "the hd97950 cluster displays pronounced mass segregation ( e.g. , sung & bessell 2004 ; harayama et al .",
    "earlier studies trying to age - date the hd97950 cluster found the massive stars on the upper main sequence ( ms ) to be very young ( e.g. , 1  2  myr according to the spectroscopic study by melena et al.2008 ) , while the pre - main - sequence stars ( pms ) were found to show a larger age spread of 2  3 myr ( e.g. , eisenhauer et al .",
    "1998 ; grebel 2004 , 2005 ; harayama et al . 2008",
    "; pang et al .",
    "the pms stars in the outer cluster regions and in the surroundings of the cluster may , in part , be older , but different authors arrive at different age ranges ( e.g. , 4  5 myr ; sung & bessell 2004 ; rochau et al .",
    "2010 ) or up to 10 myr ( beccari et al .  2010 ) .",
    "also the evolved supergiants around the hd97950 cluster support the idea of a large age spread or alternatively sequential or multiple episodes of star formation ( e.g. , moffat et al .  1983 ; tapia et al .  2001 ; crowther et al .  2008 ; melena et al .",
    "on the other hand , the size of the wind - blown bubble around the cluster suggests an age much lower than 2.5 myr when taking the kinetic energy input of the massive stars into account ( see discussion in drissen et al .",
    "1995 ) . at present ,",
    "the age(s ) and the star formation history of the hd97950 star cluster and its surroundings in ngc3603 are uncertain .",
    "one of the uncertainties in stellar age dating is introduced by the high and variable reddening in ngc3603 .",
    "the hd97950 star cluster lies in a wind - blown cavity north of a large molecular cloud in the giant hii region ngc3603 ( e.g. , clayton 1986 ; melnick 1989 ) .",
    "the gaseous surroundings of the cluster show a complex and variable velocity and density structure ( e.g. , clayton 1990 ; drissen et al .",
    "since the nebular density varies spatially , one would expect that also the dust extinction changes with position across the cluster area as denser clouds can shield dust from stellar radiation better than less dense clouds .",
    "the resulting variable reddening is known as differential reddening and was shown to be present in ngc3603 ( e.g. , sagar et al .",
    "2001 ) . when this effect is not taken properly into account",
    ", it may make stars appear redder and hence older in the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) depending on their spatial position with respect to the line of sight .",
    "this may introduce a considerable uncertainty in the estimation of the stellar ages .",
    "differential reddening could be one of the causes why the age spread among pms stars in the hd97950 star cluster appears to be as large as up to 10 myr .",
    "in fact , as shown by beccari et al .",
    "( 2010 , their figure 7 ) , pms stars are spatially more widely distributed than the ms stars and reside in areas with different reddening . sung & bessel ( 2004 ) find that the color excess of the stars within the hd97950 cluster core ( at radii @xmath14 0.7 pc ; harayama et al .",
    "2008 ) is @xmath15 = 1.25 mag and rapidly increases to 2.1 mag in the outer regions ( @xmath16 12 pc ) .",
    "we take advantage of the publicly available images of the hd97950 cluster taken with the wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) aboard the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ through narrow - band filters centered on the h@xmath1 and pa@xmath2 lines and through broad - band filters sampling the continuum emission , in order to extend the work of sung & bessel ( 2004 ) .",
    "we compute a pixel - to - pixel map of the color excess , @xmath0 , across a @xmath17 ( @xmath18  pc ) field centered on the hd97950 cluster .",
    "since only some of the gas contributing to the reddening is located in front of the majority of the stars , the reddening of the gas that we derive is an upper limit to the true reddening experienced by the stars .",
    "thus the two - dimensional distribution of the color excess associated with the gas is the first step towards correcting individual ms and pms stars for reddening in the wfc3 field of view .",
    "multi - band stellar photometry will be needed in order to establish the conversion between the reddening of the gas and that of the stars .",
    "this will ultimately allow us to constrain more tightly the age spread of pms stars and the recent star formation history of the hd97950 star cluster and of its immediate surroundings ( pang et al .",
    "2011 , in preparation ) .",
    "our present paper focuses on the reddening map .",
    "the data and their reduction are described in section 2 , while the two - dimensional map of the color excess is presented and discussed in section 3 .",
    "conclusions and a summary are presented in section 4 .",
    "multi - wavelength imaging of the hd97950 star cluster was carried out in 2010 with _ hst_/wfc3 ( proposal",
    "i d : 11360 , pi : robert oconnell ) . for our analysis",
    "we use the optical images taken in the _ f555w _ ( @xmath19 _ v _ ) , _ f656n _ ( _ h_@xmath1 ) , and _ f814w _",
    "( @xmath19 _ i _ ) filters with the wfc3 uvis detector ( 0.04 arcsec  pixel@xmath20 ) and near - infrared images in the _",

    "( continuum in _ j _ ) filters obtained with the wfc3 ir detector ( 0.13 arcsec  pixel@xmath20 ) .",
    "the total exposure time in the different filters is summarized in table 1 .",
    "all images were reduced with the wfc3 pipeline and the iraf multidrizzle task .",
    "we note that no narrow - band filter sampling the continuum emission close to the h@xmath1 or pa@xmath2 line was used during the observations .",
    "thus we use the broad - band _ v _ and _ i _ filters to estimate continuum in _ h_@xmath1 and the medium - band _ j_-continuum filters for _ pa_@xmath2 .",
    "radiation emitted at shorter wavelengths is absorbed by dust more effectively than by photons of longer wavelengths .",
    "given that the _ h_@xmath1 line ( restframe wavelength 6563   ) is emitted at a shorter wavelength than _",
    "pa_@xmath2 ( restframe wavelength 12802   ) , the interstellar dust along the line of sight decreases the _",
    "h_@xmath1 flux detected by the observer more than the _",

    "1996 ) illustrates the relation between the color excess , @xmath0 of the interstellar gas , and the observed and theoretical @xmath23/_pa_@xmath2 flux ratios of this same gas ( @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively ) under the assumption of a specific extinction law ( represented by @xmath26=@xmath27 ) :    @xmath28}\\,\\,\\,\\rm{mag}\\ ] ]    in order to apply equation ( 1 ) , we need to derive the @xmath23 and _ pa_@xmath2 emission fluxes per pixel from the available wfc3 images , and for this purpose we make use of iraf standard routines .",
    "we first determine an average point - spread function ( psf ) in each filter for 15  20 stars in common to all images . since the psf is largest in the _",
    "f139 m _ image , we degrade all the other images by convolving them with a gaussian function whose dispersion , @xmath29 , is the difference between the psf @xmath29 of the _",
    "f139 m _ image and that of the image in the filter in question .",
    "we also re - scale the optical images to the same pixel scale of the near - infrared ones , and align all images to the one taken through the _",
    "f139 m _ filter .",
    "we calibrate all images in flux by multiplying them by their respective filter photflam value as given in the wfc3 manual ( dressel et al.2010 ) .",
    "we derive the continuum emission at the @xmath23 ( _ pa_@xmath2 ) wavelength by interpolating the flux in the _ f555w _ and _ f814w _ ( _ f127 m _ and _ f139 m _ ) images pixel by pixel with a simple first - order polynomial . such an interpolation allows us to take into account the slope of the continuum emission of the stars and to better remove the stars from the final , pure line - emission images .    the continuum emission derived by interpolating the flux between _ f555w _ and _ f814w _ ( _ f127 m _ and _ f139 m _ ) is subtracted from the _ f656n _ ( _ f128n ) _ image , and the output",
    "is multiplied by the width of the narrow - band filter . in this way we are able to construct the images of the pure _ h_@xmath1 and _ pa_@xmath2 emission as well as",
    "their observed @xmath24 flux ratio .",
    "we derive @xmath30 from osterbrock ( 1989 ) under the assumption that @xmath31  k and @xmath32  @xmath33 .",
    "we adopt a normal extinction law with a ratio of total to selective extinction of @xmath34 , and derive @xmath35 and @xmath36 from fitzpatrick s ( 1999 ) extinction law . finally , we apply equation ( 1 ) to the image of the observed @xmath24 flux ratio to construct the pixel - to - pixel map of @xmath0 shown in figure 1 . in panel ( a ) of figure 2 we show the histogram of the @xmath0 per pixel , normalized by the total number of pixels in the @xmath24 image .",
    "the total line - of - sight color excess is always larger than the foreground reddening of @xmath37 mag ( pandey et al .  2000 ) . more than 90% of the pixels have @xmath0 between 1.6 and 2.2  mag .      in order to estimate the accuracy of our derived @xmath0 values , we assume that the electron counts in the images follow a poisson distribution .",
    "therefore we start with a poisson error on the electron counts per pixel in the input images , and propagate these errors through the entire computation of the continua , their subtraction from the _ f656n _ and _ f128n _ images , and the computation of the @xmath0 image according to equation ( 1 ) .",
    "we present the histogram of the uncertainties @xmath38 per pixel in panel ( b ) of figure 2 , normalized by the total number of pixels in the @xmath24 image .",
    "the histogram peaks at @xmath39 mag , and the percentage of pixels with @xmath40 mag is less than 10% . in panel ( c ) of figure 2 we plot the average @xmath41 per pixel in bins of @xmath42 per pixel . as can be seen , @xmath41 gradually decreases with increasing @xmath0 from 0.4 mag at @xmath43 mag to 0.1 mag at @xmath44 mag .",
    "in addition to photon noise , there are also some systematic errors because of the following effects :    \\(1 ) broad - band and medium - band filters are contaminated by emission lines .",
    "the pa@xmath2 emission falls in the _",
    "f127 m _ filter . assuming that the flux density of the continuum is the same in both the _",
    "f127 m _ and _ f128n _ filters , we can use the flux ratio _ f127m / f128n _ ( where both filters were multiplied by their respective photflam and band width ) to derive the contribution of the pa@xmath2 line to the flux in _ f127m_. we find this contribution to be about 13% .",
    "no hydrogen lines are found in the wavelength range of the _",
    "f139 m _ filter , only a few faint he emission lines , which should not significantly contribute to the flux in this filter .",
    "the _ f555w _",
    "filter includes four strong emission lines : the h@xmath2 and the [ oiii]@xmath45    line , where the filter response is @xmath46% and the h@xmath1 line at a response of @xmath47% .",
    "the _ f814w _",
    "filter contains the [ siii ] and [ ariii ] emission lines at wavelengths where its response is lower than 10% .",
    "unfortunately , we can not estimate the contribution of these lines to the flux detected in each filter , because the only available spectrum taken of ngc3603 in the range of 3000  10400   by garcia - rojas et al .",
    "( 2006 ) was acquired at a position outside the wfc3 field of view .",
    "if we assume that the line contamination is about 10% in _ f555w _ and _ f814w _ as it is for _ f127 m _ , the color excess would then increase by 0.05 mag on average .",
    "\\(2 ) the adopted extinction law also contributes to the systematic uncertainties . if we replace fitzpatrick s ( 1999 ) extinction law with that of cardelli et al .",
    "( 1989 ) , we obtain an @xmath0 systematically smaller by 0.1 mag ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "when we vary @xmath49 by @xmath500.5 in cardelli et al.s ( 1989 ) extinction law , @xmath0 decreases by @xmath190.3mag ( @xmath51 ) or increases by @xmath190.2mag ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "\\(3 ) the assumed electron temperature and density of the gas may be affected by systematic errors .",
    "grcia - rojas et al.(2006 ) and lebouteiller et al .",
    "( 2008 ) obtained @xmath31  k and @xmath53  @xmath33 for the ngc3603 giant hii region .",
    "since this electron density is not available in osterbrock ( 1989 ) , we calculated @xmath54 for @xmath31  k and @xmath55  @xmath33 and derived a new pixel - to - pixel map of @xmath0 .",
    "a factor of 100 difference in @xmath21 results in an average difference of 0.0025 mag in @xmath0 , which is well within the errors in @xmath0 due to photon noise .",
    "the pixel - to - pixel map of @xmath0 obtained for @xmath56  k and @xmath32  @xmath33 is presented in figure 1 .",
    "the resulting @xmath0 is integrated along the different lines of sight towards ngc3603 and includes the galactic foreground reddening , which amounts to @xmath37  mag according to pandey et al .",
    "the hd97950 cluster core ( @xmath57  pc ) where dozens of ob stars reside is masked out in order to avoid saturated bright stars in the _ f555w _ and _ f814w _ filters .",
    "since the psfs of the different filters may be slightly different even after the convolution procedure to obtain the same psf described in section 2.1 , the subtraction of the continua from the @xmath23 and _ pa_@xmath2 images can produce negative values around the stars in the pure emission images , and thus negative @xmath0 in the color excess map .",
    "this is particularly true for saturated stars and their spikes .",
    "therefore , we smooth the color excess map by replacing the negative @xmath0 at the position of a star with the median value of @xmath0 in an annulus around it .    in figure 1 , @xmath0 is seen to decrease by 0.2  mag when going from the eastern or the western edge of the field of view to the cluster center .",
    "overall , the gas color excess in the east is 0.1  mag larger than in the west .",
    "however , in the north - south direction @xmath0 is systematically larger by 0.4  0.5  mag than in the east - west direction . in general",
    ", the southern region has the largest color excess as may be expected since here we are moving towards the densest regions of the giant molecular cloud in the cluster vicinity ( e.g. , nrnberger et al .",
    "our findings support earlier suggestions that the line - of - sight dust density is uneven across the hd97950 cluster surroundings .    as an alternative way of quantifying the differential reddening around the hd97950 cluster , we show in figure 3 the radial dependence of @xmath0 from the cluster core towards the east , west , north , and south .",
    "we define a series of concentric annuli of the same width ( 0.2  pc ) and with increasing distance from the cluster center , and we measure the median value and the 16 and 84 percentile values of the @xmath0 distribution within each annulus .",
    "the solid lines in figure 3 trace the median @xmath0 as a function of cluster - centric distance , while the long - dashed lines indicate the 84 and 16 percentile values . towards the west , the color excess increases by 0.1  mag from 1  pc to 1.2",
    "pc and stays rather flat at about 1.55  mag over the distance range 1.2  pc @xmath6  pc . in the eastern direction , @xmath0 steadily increases from 1.5  mag at @xmath7  pc to 1.7  mag at @xmath5  pc and then remains nearly constant at 1.7  mag for 2  pc @xmath6  pc .",
    "the most dramatic changes in @xmath0 are seen along the northern and southern directions , where @xmath0 gets larger by 0.3 to 0.5  mag as the distance from the cluster center increases .",
    "specifically , the color excess increases from about 1.7  mag at @xmath7  pc to 2.2  mag at a distance of 2  pc .",
    "the pronounced increase towards the south does not come as a surprise since the overall density of the giant molecular clouds in ngc3603 increases in this direction ( see , e.g. , figure 1 in brandner et al .",
    "1997a ) .    in the two - dimensional map of the color excess ( figure 1 ) ,",
    "some specific sources are associated with a locally higher @xmath42 .",
    "this is the case for two of the `` proplyd''-like ( protoplanetary - disks - like ) objects first detected by brandner et al.(2000 ) .",
    "proplyd 1 is located east of the hd97950 star cluster , while proplyd 3 is in the northwest . both are tadpole - shaped and rim - brightened sources with extended tails pointing away from the cluster core .",
    "mid - infrared observations ( nrnberger & stanke 2003 ) do not reveal any point - like source that might be associated with the proplyds .",
    "these authors suggest that these objects are small dense clumps of gas and dust , which are being photoevaporated by the intense ionizing radiation of the massive stars in the hd97950 cluster instead of being disks around young stars as proposed by brandner et al .",
    "in particular , proplyd 3 shows extended faint emission at 11.9  @xmath58 m , which may be caused by carbon - rich dust grains ( see goebel et al.1995 ) .",
    "assuming that the dust properties are the same for these three proplyds , the higher color excess of proplyd 3 ( 0.3 mag redder than proplyd 1 , see table 2 ) would be consistent with a higher dust content ( if both proplyds are at the same distance ) , and hence with the fact that proplyd 3 is the only proplyd detected at 11.9 @xmath59 ( nrnberger & stanke 2003 ) .    to the north of the hd97950 cluster ,",
    "we find sher 25 , a blue supergiant with a circumstellar ring and an hourglass nebula ( brandner et al .  1997a , 1997b ) .",
    "we have measured the color excess in the bright rims of the northeastern and southwestern lobes of the hourglass nebula ( table 2 ; see also figure 1 ) and found that the hourglass nebula is more strongly extincted in the northeast ( with @xmath60  mag versus @xmath61  mag in the southwest ) .",
    "optical images of ngc3603 show an extended cavity around the hd97950 cluster .",
    "clayton ( 1986 ) estimated the diameter of this shell - like structure to be approximately 2 kpc .",
    "clayton analyzed the doppler shifts of the h@xmath1 emission in the central region of ngc3603 , and found a complex velocity structure in the ionized hydrogen .",
    "he interpreted the main velocity components as indicative of two expanding shells .",
    "one of these is a faint shell in the east - west direction with a mean heliocentric velocity of @xmath62  km  s@xmath20 , an expansion velocity of @xmath63  km  s@xmath20 , and a diameter of @xmath64  pc .",
    "the other one is a brighter shell in the north - south direction and centered on the hd97950 cluster . for this second",
    "shell - like feature clayton ( 1986 ) found @xmath65  km  s@xmath20 and @xmath66 pc as a lower limit for its diameter .",
    "( note that clayton assumed that ngc3603 lies at a distance of 6 kpc from us . ) from clayton s figure 4 , we infer an expansion velocity of @xmath67  km  s@xmath20 for this second shell , which clayton identified with the above mentioned cavity .    in the @xmath0 map ( figure 1 )",
    "we also find a cavity in correspondence with this expanding gas shell and with a radius of about 1.0  pc .",
    "the median color excess within the cavity is @xmath68  mag .",
    "moreover , we find a shell structure corresponding to a local enhancement of color excess with a mean @xmath69  mag about 1.2  pc west of the cluster center ( see figure 4 ) .",
    "this shell structure extends for 1.3  pc along the north - south direction ( figure 1 ) .",
    "judging from its position , it seems to lie along the high ionization front of the gas shell structure found by clayton ( 1986 ) in the north - south direction .",
    "recently , lebouteiller et al .",
    "( 2007 ) observed ngc3603 with spitzer in order to search for pah ( polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ) and [ siv ] emission .",
    "they found that within 1.5  pc from the cluster center , the pah and [ siv ] emission is suppressed , possibly because the strong radiation field of the massive stars in the cluster core ( about 60 ob stars , see melena et al .",
    "2008 ) destroys dust grains , dissociates complex molecules and pushes the gas out .",
    "in doing so , these stars would thus reduce the color excess within the area and produce a cavity with lower @xmath0 in the reddening map .",
    "the western edge of this cavity appears to be delineated by the shell structure seen in the reddening map .      in the southern region of ngc 3603",
    "we can see two prominent pillars to the southwest and southeast of the cluster ( figures 1 and 4 ) .",
    "following nrnberger et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , we refer to them as mm1 and mm2 , respectively .",
    "figure 4 is a composite color image showing the h@xmath1 emission ( in blue ) , the pa@xmath2 emission ( in green ) , and the color excess ( in red ) .",
    "the heads of both mm1 and mm2 stand out because of their strong h@xmath1 and pa@xmath2 emission .",
    "they are gradually being photoevaporated by the cluster s massive ob stars as is also indicated by the shocked and ionized material in their heads ( nrnberger et al .",
    "2002 , 2003 ) .",
    "according to bertoldi ( 1989 ) and bertoldi & mckee ( 1990 ) , in clouds experiencing photoevaporation a velocity gradient will eventually emerge , leading to a configuration where the head of a pillar moves more slowly than its tail . applying this to the eagle nebula ( m16 ) , pound ( 1998 )",
    "points out that the measured radial velocity gradients depend on our viewing angle and provide clues about the three - dimensional structure of the nebular features with respect to the ionizing stars .",
    "the tail of a pillar located in front of the ionizing stars will then have lower radial velocities than the pillar s head , since the tail is being blown toward the observer ( while the opposite radial velocity gradient would be observed across a pillar located behind the ionizing ob stars ) . both nrnberger et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and rllig et al .",
    "( 2010 ) found that the radial velocity in the head of mm1 is larger than that of the tail .",
    "thus in ngc3603 we have a configuration where the pillar is located in front of the stars of the hd97950 cluster as seen from our position , with some tilt with respect to the light of sight .",
    "the rims of mm1 and mm2 have a high @xmath0 of @xmath70  mag , implying a large amount of dust . along the pillar",
    "s main body , though , the color excess is lower than at the rim ( @xmath71mag ) owing to `` limb brightening '' effects .",
    "we explain this phenomenon in a cartoon in figure 5 .",
    "the pillar is represented by a cylinder whose density decreases from the head to the tail ( mackey & lim 2010 ) .",
    "the radiation of the cluster s ob stars ionizes the outer layer of the pillar ( a , b and c in figure 5 ) , while the interior is largely shielded and mostly neutral .",
    "because of the long path traveled by the light emitted in a and b of the ionized layer ( figure 5 ) , the color excess measured in the pillar rims is relatively high , yet a lower limit to the true @xmath0 associated with the main body of the pillar .",
    "the light emitted in c ( i.e. , the front side of the pillar in figure 5 ) travels a shorter path within the ionized layer , and , for this reason , the @xmath0 measured in the front side of the pillar facing the observer is lower than that computed at the pillar rims .",
    "also in the simulations of gritschneder et al .  (",
    "2010 ) the ionizing radiation emitted by a massive star can enhance the initial turbulent density distribution of a nearby molecular cloud and naturally lead to the formation of pillar - like structures within the cloud .",
    "the heads of these pillars may experience gravitational collapse and undergo star formation .",
    "thompson et al .  ( 2002 ) detected two bright stars in the head of the pillar column iii in m16 using near - infrared observations .",
    "we attempt to estimate the column density of atomic hydrogen ( @xmath72 ) per pixel across the wfc3 field of figure 1 by using the empirical relation ( equation 2 ) of seward ( 1999 ) : @xmath73    where @xmath74 is computed from the two - dimensional map of @xmath0 in figure 1 assuming @xmath75 .",
    "the histogram of the pixel @xmath76 distribution is shown in figure 6 .",
    "the majority of the pixels have @xmath76 in the range of approximately 21.9 to 22.1 .",
    "the rims of the pillars in ngc3603 are characterized by @xmath77 .",
    "this value is probably only a lower limit to the true column density of @xmath78 within the pillars .",
    "for example , thompson et al .  (",
    "2002 ) derived @xmath79 inside the dark region of the pillar column iii in m16 .",
    "since the column density of molecular hydrogen ( @xmath80 ) is one half of the @xmath78 value ( thompson et al .",
    "2002 ) , the pillar rims in ngc3603 likely have @xmath81 , which agrees well with the simulation results of mackey & lim ( 2010 ) . with this column density at the rims ,",
    "the central h@xmath10 column density of the pillar , @xmath82 , may be as high as about 22.7 to 23 according to mackey & lim ( 2010 ) , which agrees with the the column density of mm1 and mm2 ( @xmath83 ) as derived by n@xmath84rnberger et al .",
    "( 2002 ) .",
    "this value is consistent with the h@xmath10 column density of bright - rimmed clouds ( brcs ) undergoing star formation .",
    "urquhart et al .  ( 2009 ) studied a number of brcs , which are isolated molecular clouds located on the edges of evolved hii regions .",
    "some brcs show evidence of significant interaction between their molecular gas with the ionizing radiation from their nearby hii regions .",
    "these brcs are thus comparable in their properties to the ionized heads of molecular clouds .",
    "they have been found to host star formation activity , most likely triggered by the ionizing front coming from the nearby hii regions .",
