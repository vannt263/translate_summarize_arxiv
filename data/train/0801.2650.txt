    "<S> for two variable real analytic function germs we compare the blow - analytic equivalence in the sense of kuo to the other natural equivalence relations . </S>",
    "<S> our main theorem states that @xmath0 equivalent germs are blow - analytically equivalent . </S>",
    "<S> this gives a negative answer to a conjecture of kuo . in the proof </S>",
    "<S> we show that the puiseux pairs of real newton - puiseux roots are preserved by the @xmath0 equivalence of function germs . </S>",
    "<S> the proof is achieved , being based on a combinatorial characterisation of blow - analytic equivalence in terms of the real tree model .    </S>",
    "<S> we also give several examples of bi - lipschitz equivalent germs that are not blow - analytically equivalent .    </S>",
    "<S> the natural equivalence relations we first think of are the @xmath1 coordinate changes for @xmath2 , where @xmath3 stands for real analytic . </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath4 , @xmath5 be real analytic function germs . </S>",
    "<S> we say that @xmath4 and @xmath6 are @xmath1 _ ( right ) equivalent _ if there is a local @xmath1 diffeomorphism @xmath7 such that @xmath8 . if @xmath9 is a local bi - lipschitz homeomorphism , resp . </S>",
    "<S> a local homeomorphism , then we say that @xmath4 and @xmath6 are _ bi - lipschitz equivalent _ , resp . @xmath10 _ equivalent_. by definition , we have the following implications : @xmath11 by artin s approximation theorem @xcite , @xmath12 equivalence implies @xmath13 equivalence . </S>",
    "<S> but the other converse implications of do not hold . </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath4 , @xmath14 be polynomial functions defined by @xmath15 for @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> n. kuiper @xcite and f. takens @xcite showed that @xmath4 and @xmath6 are @xmath1 equivalent , but not @xmath17 equivalent .    </S>",
    "<S> in the family of germs @xmath18 the phenomenon of continuous @xmath0 moduli appears : for @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are @xmath0 equivalent if and only if @xmath23 , where @xmath24 $ ] , @xmath25 $ ] or @xmath26 , see example [ c1moduli ] below . on the other hand , t .- c . </S>",
    "<S> kuo proved that this family is @xmath10-trivial over any interval not containing @xmath27 , by a @xmath10 trivialisation obtained by the integration of a vector field , c.f . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . in the homogeneous case , as that of @xmath28 , </S>",
    "<S> the kuo vector field is lipschitz and the trivialisation is bi - lipschitz . </S>",
    "<S> thus kuo s construction gives examples of bi - lipschitz equivalent germs that are not @xmath0 equivalent .    </S>",
    "<S> it is easy to construct examples of @xmath10 equivalent and bi - lipschitz non - equivalent germs . </S>",
    "<S> let us note that , moreover , the bi - lipschitz equivalence also has continuous moduli , c.f . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . for instance </S>",
    "<S> the family @xmath29 is @xmath10 trivial and if @xmath30 is bi - lipschitz equivalent to @xmath31 , @xmath32 , then @xmath33 .      </S>",
    "<S> blow - analytic equivalence was proposed for real analytic function germs by tzee - char kuo @xcite as a counterpart of the topological equivalence of complex analytic germs . </S>",
    "<S> kuo showed in @xcite the local finiteness ( i.e. the absence of continuous moduli ) of blow - analytic types for analytic families of isolated singularities .    </S>",
    "<S> we say that a homeomorphism germ @xmath34 is a _ blow - analytic homeomorphism _ if there exist real modifications @xmath35 , @xmath36 @xmath37 and an analytic isomorphism @xmath38 so that @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> the formal definition of real modification is somewhat technical and , since in this paper we consider only the two variable case , we shall use the following criterion of @xcite : in two variable case @xmath40 is a real modification if and only if it is a finite composition of point blowings - up . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we say that two real analytic function germs @xmath41 and @xmath5 are _ blow - analytically equivalent _ if there exists a blow - analytic homeomorphism @xmath7 such that @xmath8 .    for instance , the family @xmath28 , @xmath42 , becomes real analytically trivial after the blowing - up of the @xmath43axis , cf . </S>",
    "<S> kuo @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus for @xmath44 , or @xmath45 respectively , all @xmath28 are blow - analytically equivalent . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , the family @xmath46 becomes real analytically trivial after a toric blowing - up in @xmath47variables , cf . </S>",
    "<S> fukui - yoshinaga @xcite or fukui - paunescu @xcite , and hence it is blow - analytically trivial . </S>",
    "<S> thus blow - analytic equivalence does not imply neither @xmath1-equivalence , @xmath48 , nor bi - lipschitz equivalence .    </S>",
    "<S> blow - analytic equivalence is a stronger and more natural notion than @xmath10 equivalence . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , @xmath49 , @xmath50 are @xmath10 equivalent , but not blow - analytically equivalent . </S>",
    "<S> the latter fact can be seen using the fukui invariant @xcite , that we recall in section [ bilipschitz ] below , or it follows directly from the following theorem .    </S>",
    "<S> [ allequivalent](cf . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) let @xmath51 and @xmath52 be real analytic function germs </S>",
    "<S> . then the following conditions are equivalent :    1 .   </S>",
    "<S> @xmath4 and @xmath6 are blow - analytically equivalent . </S>",
    "<S> 2 .   @xmath4 and @xmath6 have isomorphic minimal resolutions . </S>",
    "<S> 3 .   </S>",
    "<S> the real tree models of @xmath4 and @xmath6 are isomorphic .    for more on the blow - analytic equivalence in the general case @xmath53-dimensional </S>",
    "<S> we refer the reader to recent surveys @xcite .    what is the relation between blow - analytic equivalence and @xmath1 equivalences , @xmath54 ? </S>",
    "<S> kuo states in @xcite that his modified analytic homeomorphism is independent of @xmath1 diffeomorphisms , @xmath54 , and confirms his belief at the invited address of the annual convention of the mathematical society of japan , autumn 1984 ( @xcite ) , by asserting that blow - analytic equivalence is independent of @xmath1 equivalences . </S>",
    "<S> untill now it was widely believed that this is the case .      </S>",
    "<S> the main result of this paper is the following .    </S>",
    "<S> [ c1givesblow ] let @xmath51 and @xmath52 be real analytic function germs and suppose that there exists a @xmath0 diffeomorphism germ @xmath55 such that @xmath56 </S>",
    "<S> . then @xmath4 and @xmath6 are blow - analytically equivalent .    </S>",
    "<S> if , moreover , @xmath9 preserves orientation , then @xmath4 and @xmath6 are blow - analytically equivalent by an orientation preserving blow - analytic homeomorphism .    </S>",
    "<S> this gives a negative answer to the above conjecture of kuo . </S>",
    "<S> to give the reader some flavour of this unexpected result we propose the following special case that contains most of the difficulty of the proof and does not refer to blow - analytic equivalence . </S>",
    "<S> recall that a newton - puiseux root of @xmath57 is a real analytic arc @xmath58 parameterised by @xmath59 where @xmath60 is a convergent fractional power series @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> we shall always assume that @xmath62 , that is @xmath63 is transverse to the @xmath64-axis . </S>",
    "<S> we shall call @xmath63 real if all @xmath65 are real for @xmath66 , and then we understand @xmath63 as such real demi - branch of an analytic arc , with the parametrisation restricted to @xmath66 .    </S>",
    "<S> ( cf . </S>",
    "<S> proposition [ puiseuxinvariance1 ] below ) + let @xmath67 be a @xmath0 diffeomorphism and let @xmath4 , @xmath14 be real analytic function germs such that @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> suppose that @xmath58 and @xmath68 be newton - puiseux roots of @xmath4 and @xmath6 respectively such that @xmath69 as set germs . </S>",
    "<S> then the puiseux characteristic pairs of @xmath63 and @xmath70 coincide .    </S>",
    "<S> this property has no obvious counterpart in the complex set - up . </S>",
    "<S> the puiseux pairs of plane curve singularities are embedded topological invariants , cf . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we can not dream of any similar statement in the real analytic set - up , all real analytic demi - branches are @xmath0 equivalent to the positive @xmath71axis . in the proof of proposition [ puiseuxinvariance1 </S>",
    "<S> ] we use two basic assumptions , the arcs are roots and @xmath9 conjugates the analytic functions defining the roots : @xmath8 .    </S>",
    "<S> there is another major difference to the complex case . </S>",
    "<S> the topological type of a complex analytic function germ can be combinatorially characterised in terms of the tree model of @xcite , that encodes the contact orders between different newton - puiseux roots , that give , in particular , the puiseux pairs of those roots . </S>",
    "<S> this is no longer true in real words , the puiseux pairs can not be read from these contact orders , see @xcite .    it was speculated for a long time that there is a relation between blow - analytic and bi - lipschitz properties . </S>",
    "<S> it is not difficult to construct examples showing that @xmath72 as the example @xmath46 above . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we construct several examples showing that @xmath73 thus , there is no direct relation between these two notions . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , as shown in @xcite , a blow - analytic homeomorphism that gives blow - analytic equivalence between two 2-variable real analytic function germs , preserves the order of contact between * non*-parameterised real analytic arcs . </S>",
    "<S> note that by the curve selection lemma , a subanalytic homeomorphism is bi - lipschitz if and only if it preserves the order of contact between parameterised real analytic arcs .    for more than two variables </S>",
    "<S> we have another phenomenon . </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath74 , @xmath75 , be the briancon - speder family defined by @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> although @xmath77 and @xmath78 are blow - analytically equivalent , any blow - analytic homeomorphism that gives the blow - analytic equivalence between them does not preserve the order of contact between some analytic arcs contained in @xmath79 , cf . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .      in section [ invariantbi - l ] </S>",
    "<S> we construct new invariants of bi - lipschitz and @xmath0 equivalences . </S>",
    "<S> these invariants can be nicely described in terms of the newton polygon relative to a curve , the notion introduced in @xcite , though the reader can follow an alternative way that uses equivalent notions : the order function and associated polynomials . </S>",
    "<S> shortly speaking , if @xmath80 with @xmath9 bi - lipschitz then the newton boundaries of @xmath4 relative to an arc @xmath63 coincides with the newton boundary of @xmath6 relative to @xmath81 . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath9 is @xmath0 and @xmath82 then , moreover , the corresponding coefficients on the newton boundaries are identical . as a direct corollary we get the @xmath0 invariance of puiseux pairs of the newton - puiseux roots , see proposition [ puiseuxinvariance1 ] .    in section [ @xmath0 ] </S>",
    "<S> we show theorem [ c1givesblow ] . the proof is based on theorem [ allequivalent ] so we recall in this section the construction of real tree model .    in section [ arbitraryc1 ] </S>",
    "<S> we extend the construction of section [ invariantbi - l ] to all @xmath0 diffeomorphisms ( we drop the assumption @xmath82 ) . as a corollary </S>",
    "<S> we give a complete classification of @xmath0 equivalent weighted homogeneous germs of two variables .    </S>",
    "<S> section [ bilipschitz ] contains the construction of examples of bi - lipschitz equivalent and blow - analytically non - equivalent germs . </S>",
    "<S> this is not simple since such a bi - lipschitz equivalence can not be natural . </S>",
    "<S> let us first recall the construction of invariants of bi - lipschitz equivalence of @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> suppose that the generic polar curve of @xmath84 has at least two branches @xmath85 . </S>",
    "<S> fix reasonable parametrisations of these branches , either by a coordonate as @xmath86 or by the distance to the origin , and expand @xmath4 along each such branch . </S>",
    "<S> suppose that the expansions along different branches @xmath87 have the same leading exponent @xmath88 , and that the term @xmath89 is sufficiently big in comparison to the distance between the branches . </S>",
    "<S> then the ratio of the leading coefficients @xmath90 is a bi - lipschitz invariant ( and a continuous modulus ) . </S>",
    "<S> our construction of bi - lipschitz homeomorphism goes along these lines but in the opposite direction . </S>",
    "<S> first we choose carefully @xmath84 , @xmath91 so that such the expansions of @xmath4 , resp . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath6 , along polar branches are compatible , so that we write down explicitly bi - lipschitz equivalences between horn neighbourhoods of polar curves of @xmath4 and @xmath6 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> then we show that , in our examples , these equivalences can be glued together using partition of unity .      </S>",
    "<S> we shall use freely the following widely known facts . in the general @xmath53-variable case , </S>",
    "<S> the multiplicity of an analytic function germ is a bi - lipschitz invariant . for the @xmath0 equivalence the initial homogeneous form , up to linear equivalence , </S>",
    "<S> is an invariant . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , for real analytic functions not identically zero , we have    [ initialform ] let @xmath4 , @xmath5 be analytic function germs of the form    @xmath92 ,    @xmath93 .    </S>",
    "<S> suppose that @xmath4 and @xmath6 are @xmath0-equivalent . then @xmath94 and @xmath95 and @xmath96 are linearly equivalent .    in particular , </S>",
    "<S> if homogeneous polynomial functions are @xmath0-equivalent , then they are linearly equivalent .    since @xmath0-equivalence is a bi - lipschitz equivalence , @xmath97 . </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath98 be a local @xmath0 diffeomorphism such that @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> let us write @xmath99 where @xmath100 , @xmath101 . </S>",
    "<S> set @xmath102 . </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath9 is a local @xmath0 diffeomorphism , @xmath103 is a linear transformation of @xmath104 . </S>",
    "<S> now we have @xmath105 where @xmath106 and @xmath107 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore we have @xmath108 . </S>",
    "<S> namely , @xmath95 and @xmath96 are linearly equivalent .    </S>",
    "<S> [ c1moduli ] let @xmath109 , @xmath75 , be a polynomial function defined by @xmath110 by an elementary calculation , we can see that there are @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 with @xmath115 such that @xmath116 if and only if @xmath23 or @xmath117 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore it follows from lemma [ initialform ] that @xmath118 and @xmath119 , @xmath19 , @xmath120 , are @xmath0-equivalent if and only if @xmath23 or @xmath117 . </S>"
