    "inflation @xcite marks nowadays an inevitable ingredient when studying the very early evolution of the universe .",
    "the reason stems from the fact that it solves most of the puzzles that plague the standard big bang theory , and simultaneously is consistent with the observations @xcite . in other words ,",
    "it not only gives sensible explanations for the horizon , flatness , and relic abundant problems , but also provides us primordial density perturbation as seeds of the formation for a large - scale structure in the universe .",
    "most of the inflationary scenario proposed so far requires the introduction of new degree of freedom , e.g. a higgs field @xcite , a gauge field @xcite , and so on , to successfully drive inflation .",
    "yet there are other well - motivated inflationary models , e.g. a 3-form field inflation @xcite and multi - field inflation @xcite .",
    "however , the underlying nature of theory of inflaton is still an open question . according to the cosmic frontier",
    ", the construction of inflationary models raises a lot of interest .",
    "recent investigations revolutionize the possibility of model building in which the inflaton needs not be an elementary degree of freedom @xcite .    in the standard picture of the early universe",
    ", the universe passes through the period of reheating . at this stage , ( almost )",
    "all elementary particles populating the universe were created .",
    "the instructive idea of mechanism for reheating was proposed , for instance , by the author of @xcite in which reheating occurs due to particle production by the oscillating scalar field . in the simplest version ,",
    "this field is the inflaton that exponentially drives the expansion of the universe .",
    "however , a phenomenological description of the reheating mechanism was first implemented in @xcite .",
    "the authors added various friction terms to the equation of motion of the scalar field in order to imitate energy transfer from the inflaton to matter fields .",
    "however , it can be questioned what kind of terms should be practically added .",
    "the theory of reheating in application to the new inflationary scenario was further developed in refs .",
    "@xcite , in application to r2 inflation in ref .",
    "@xcite , and to non - commutative inflation in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "the treatment was based on perturbative theory where the knowledge of quantum field theory is mandatory .",
    "indeed , it has been recognized that in inflationary models the first stage of reheating occur in a regime of a parametric amplification of scalars field @xcite .",
    "this preceding evolutionary phase is called preheating stage of which particles are explosively produced due to the parametric resonance .",
    "there are many analytical works which examined the preheating mechanism , e.g. @xcite .",
    "for instance , the authors of @xcite have examined the properties of resonance with non - minimally coupled scalar field @xmath3 in preheating phase and have found that effective resonance is possible only by the existence of a non - minimal coupling @xmath4 term with a sizeable range of parameter @xmath5 . moreover , the same authors of @xcite later considered higher - curvature inflation models @xmath6 allowing to study a parametric preheating of a scalar field coupled non - minimally to a spacetime curvature .",
    "another interesting paradigm was proposed by @xcite . in this scenario",
    ", they studied preheating mechanism of which the standard model higgs , strongly non - minimally coupled to gravity , plays the role of the inflaton .",
    "consequently , they discovered that the universe does reheat through which perturbative and non - perturbative effects are mixed .",
    "moreover , the authors of @xcite have investigated the production of particles due to parametric resonances in 3-form field inflation and found that this process is more efficient compared to the result of the standard - scalar - field inflationary scenario , e.g. @xcite , in which the broad resonance tends to disappear more quickly .    in this work",
    ", we study details of preheating , following the work presented in @xcite , in an inflationary scenario in which the inflaton is the lightest composite state , which are expected to be the most important ones for collider phenomenology , stemming from the minimal walking technicolor ( mwt ) theory which includes a new strong sector based on the @xmath7 gauge group with two dirac flavors transforming according to the adjoint representation . for model of composite inflation , the authors of @xcite engaged the mwt effective lagrangian with the standard slow - roll paradigm and we call it here technicolor inflation(ti ) . interestingly , one of the salient features of technicolor inflation is not only to provide a possible resolution to the well - known @xmath8-problem , is proportional to the inflaton mass .",
    "therefore , if the inflaton is a fundamental scalar , this parameter receives quantum corrections . as a result",
    ", such corrections would spoil the slow roll approximation . ]",
    "@xcite of inflationary model - building but also to allow for an inflationary phase in the early universe @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we briefly review our model of inflation in which the inflaton emerges as a composite state coupled non - minimally to a spacetime curvature . adding a scalar field coupled minimally to gravity , in sec.(iii ) , we then introduce an analytical approach to study the preheating for model of composite inflation . in sec.(iv ) , we study parametric resonances of model when a composite inflaton field @xmath0 coupled to another scalar field @xmath1 with the interaction term @xmath2 .",
    "finally , we give our findings in the last section .",
    "the underlying gauge theory for the technicolor - inspired inflation is the su(n ) gauge group with @xmath9 dirac massless fermions .",
    "the two technifermions transform according to the adjoint representation of su(2 ) technicolor ( tc ) gauge group , called @xmath10 . here",
    "we engaged the simplest models of technicolor known as the minimal walking technicolor ( mwt ) theory @xcite with the standard ( slow - roll ) inflationary paradigm as a template for composite inflation and name it , in short , the mci model . in order to examine the symmetry properties of the theory , we arrange them by using the weyl basis into a column vector , and the field contents in this case are @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the left - handed techniup and technidown respectively , and @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the corresponding right - handed particles and the upper index @xmath16 is the tc index indicating the three dimensional adjoint representation . since the @xmath17 is four component ,",
    "the technifermion fields are said to be in the fundamental representation of su(4 ) . with the standard breaking to the maximal diagonal subgroup , the su(4 ) global symmetry spontaneously breaks to so(4 ) .",
    "such a breaking is driven by the formation of the following condensate : @xmath18 where @xmath19 denote the components of the tetraplet of @xmath17 , and @xmath20 indicate the ordinary spin .",

    "the connection between the composite scalar fields and the underlying technifermions can be obtained from the transformation properties of su(4 ) . to this end",

    "the non - minimal coupling is added at the fundamental level showing that the non - minimal coupling is well motivated at the level of the fundamental description . however , an instructive analysis of the generated coupling of a composite scalar field to gravity has been initiated in the nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model @xcite . with this regard , the non - minimal coupling apparently seems rather natural . using the renormalization group equation for the chiral condensate",

    "<S> we investigate the particle production due to parametric resonances in model of inflation where the lightest composite state stemming from the minimal walking technicolor theory plays the role of the inflaton . for model of inflation , the effective theory couples non - minimally to gravity . </S>",
    "<S> regarding the preheating , we study in details a model of a composite inflaton field @xmath0 coupled to another scalar field @xmath1 with the interaction term @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> particularly , in minkowski space , the stage of parametric resonances can be described by the mathieu equation . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , we discover that broad resonances can be typically achieved and potentially efficient in our model causing the number of particle density in this process exponentially increases . </S>"
