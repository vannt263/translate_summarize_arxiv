    "we will refer to this working mode of the system as to _ the closed mode_.",

    "[ fig : tpi_n ] that there are jumps of the value of @xmath134 .",
    "these jumps come from the fact that populations of atomic excited levels oscillate with high frequencies  @xcite .",

    "@xcite , but it employs four - level atoms in the diamond configuration instead of two - level atoms . the main idea of both setups is to couple a high- cavity mode to a low- cavity mode through atoms .",
    "such a device would be very useful , because on the one hand we need a high factor to reach the strong coupling regime  @xcite , in which we can generate a complex non - classical state of light trapped inside optical resonator  @xcite , but on the other hand we need a low factor to extract this state from the resonator into a waveguide before it will be distorted by the cavity damping . the device proposed by tufarelli",

    "it is also worth to note that in the regime @xmath203 eq .",
    "( [ eq : mapping02 ] ) takes the simpler form @xmath103 .       as a function of the cavity length @xmath204 and the transmission coefficient @xmath205 for @xmath206 @xmath0-type four - level atoms.,width=302 ]    , but for @xmath207 atoms.,width=302 ]    let us now investigate the usefulness of the considered device to extract a field state from the @xmath8 mode and the experimental feasibility of the scheme . to this end , we set values of parameters that are achievable using present technology .",
    "we assume that there is only one optical cavity .",
    "this cavity supports two electromagnetic field modes of different frequencies @xmath13 and @xmath3 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : systemeff ] ) .",
    "the first of them is considered as the @xmath8 mode , while the second one as the @xmath11 mode .",
    "each cavity mirror is described by its radius of curvature @xmath208 , transmission coefficients @xmath209 and @xmath210 for the @xmath8 mode and the @xmath11 mode , respectively , and loss coefficient @xmath211 , which is assumed to be the same for both modes .",
    "the @xmath8 mode requires very low values of @xmath209 and @xmath211 for both mirrors . to our knowledge , these parameters take the lowest value for the mirror that has been used in the experiment of  @xcite .",
    "we set these values in our calculations , _ i.e. _ , @xmath212  ppm and @xmath213  ppm , where the subscripts indicate the mirror .",
    "the radius of curvature of both mirrors is 50  mm  @xcite .",
    "now we can vary only the cavity length @xmath204 and the transmission coefficient @xmath205 , and therefore , we want to plot the figure of merit @xmath173 as a function of these two quantities .",
    "first we have to choose a concrete realization of the @xmath0-type atom .",
    "let us choose a @xmath214 atom , as in the mentioned above experiment  @xcite , and its levels @xmath215 , @xmath216 , @xmath217 and @xmath218 to serve as @xmath98 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 , respectively .",
    "this choice determines values of modes frequencies to be @xmath219  thz and @xmath220  thz  @xcite .",
    "the lifetimes of all used here excited levels can be found in ref .",
    "it is important that the lifetime of the level @xmath61 is longer ( @xmath221  ns ) than lifetimes of the other excited levels ( @xmath222  ns for @xmath59 and @xmath223  ns for @xmath60 ) .",
    "so our assumption that spontaneous emissions from the excited level @xmath61 can be neglected in calculations is justified not only by small population of this level , but also by @xmath224 and @xmath225 .",
    "the spontaneous emissions can take the @xmath6 atom from the states @xmath59 and @xmath60 only to state @xmath98 .",
    "hence , it is easy to calculate corresponding spontaneous emission rates : @xmath226  mhz and @xmath227  mhz .    in principle , the scheme presented here works properly even with only one trapped atom . in real experiments , however , this scheme will require a much larger number of atoms to achieve the figure of merit that is close to unity . in order to compare our scheme with the original scheme of tufarelli  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , we set here the same number of atoms as in ref .",
    "@xcite , _ i.e. _ , @xmath228",
    ". trapping @xmath206 rubidium atoms and preparing them in the @xmath215 state is possible using fiber - based fabry - perot cavities  @xcite .",
    "we have chosen the macroscopic cavity in our considerations .",
    "a number of atoms trapped inside macroscopic cavities is typically of the order of @xmath229  @xcite .",
    "trapping @xmath230 atoms also should be possible .",
    "now we can calculate the coupling strength @xmath9 using @xmath231 where @xmath232 is the speed of light and @xmath2 is the cavity mode volume given by @xmath233 in order to calculate the coupling strength @xmath12 we have to replace @xmath13 and @xmath27 by @xmath3 and @xmath28 in  ( [ eq : g ] ) and  ( [ eq : v ] ) .",
    "the cavity damping constants of the considered here scheme can be calculated using formulas @xmath234 where @xmath235 , @xmath236 and @xmath237    finally , we have to fix values of @xmath19 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "it is necessary to choose these values carefully .",
    "on the one hand they should be big enough to make adiabatic elimination justified .",
    "on the other hand they can not be too big , because @xmath199 and @xmath173 decrease with increasing @xmath19 . in our computations we set @xmath238 and @xmath239 , which justifies adiabatic elimination for cavity states with @xmath240 .",
    "then @xmath18 is given by  ( [ eq : mapping02 ] ) .",
    "now we can plot @xmath173 as a function of @xmath204 and @xmath205 .",
    "for the parameters given above the formula  ( [ eq : ffinal ] ) gives only raw approximation of the figure of merit .",
    "therefore , we have calculated @xmath173 numerically using eq .",
    "( [ eq : fig_mer ] ) , and we have obtained in this way results presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : resultsf ] .",
    "as expected , the figure of merit takes the maximum value in the near - concentric regime @xmath241 . for @xmath242  mm and @xmath243",
    "ppm the figure of merit is equal to @xmath244 .",
    "unfortunately , the near - concentric configuration of the macroscopic mirrors is extreme sensitive to misalignment , and therefore , it would be difficult or even impossible to achieve such high value of @xmath173  @xcite .",
    "for the confocal configuration @xmath245 , which is the most stable configuration , the figure of merit can be equal to @xmath246 .",
    "this value is still quite high and it is higher than @xmath173 of the original scheme of tufarelli  _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "of course , we can always increase the figure of merit by increasing @xmath20 .    to show this we plot also the figure of merit for @xmath247 .",
    "it is seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : f_n ] that now @xmath248 even for the confocal configuration .",
    "so far , we have investigated the device working in the open mode .",
    "let us now consider this device working in the closed mode .",
    "the advantage of our scheme over the original scheme  @xcite is the simplicity of switching between the open and the closed mode .",
    "we do not need to remove thousands of atoms from the cavity .",
    "we do not need the time - consuming operation of applying a large detuning to the atoms . in our scheme",
    "fast switching of the effective quality factor is as simple as switching the control lasers .",
    "for the device working in the closed mode both lasers are turned off .",
    "the effective hamiltonian derived with @xmath115 is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : hamiltonian_closed ] ) .",
    "it is seen that there is no interaction between the @xmath8 mode and the @xmath11 mode , and therefore , photons do not leak out of the @xmath8 mode through the @xmath11 mode . the only destructive role played by atoms trapped inside the cavity is the increase of photon losses caused by the spontaneous emission from the atomic excited state @xmath60 .",
    "the decay of the @xmath8 mode associated with the atomic spontaneous emission is described by an effective decay rate @xmath249 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : eff0 ] ) ) .",
    "we have found out that for the parameter values used in the previous section with @xmath250  mm , @xmath251  ppm and @xmath228 this effective decay rate @xmath252  mhz is less than the cavity decay rate associated with the absorption in the mirrors @xmath253  mhz .",
    "knowing @xmath254 , we can take atomic spontaneous emissions into account just by making the replacement @xmath255 .",
    "we have studied a quantum system composed of @xmath0-type atoms and an optical cavity supporting two electromagnetic field modes , in which these atoms are permanently trapped .",
    "we have considered the case , where lower transitions are coupled to the field modes and upper transitions are driven by classical laser fields .",
    "we have shown that this complex quantum system can be described by an effective hamiltonian of simple form if intensities of the lasers fields and the detuning are big enough .",
    "we have also shown that the evolution of this system can be easily controlled just by turning lasers on and off .",
    "we have presented two example applications of the system .",
    "the first application is a state transfer from one quantized mode to another .",
    "we have shown that the time of the transfer is independent of the photon number , and thus , it is possible to map a quantum state of one mode onto the second mode .",
    "the second example application is a device that plays the role of a switchable cavity , which can work on demand as a low- cavity or as a high- cavity .",
    "contrary to the original scheme of tufarelli  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite our device can be easily and fast switched between these two working modes just by switching the lasers on and off . since the device working in the open mode can be modeled by a simple beam - splitter ( or by an amplitude damping channel ) it can be defined by a single parameter @xmath173 .",
    "we have derive a formula for this natural figure of merit for our device .",
    "we have also investigated the experimental feasibility of the scheme and we have found that this device should achieve the figure of merit equal to @xmath246 using present technology .",
    "this value is little higher than that in the original scheme .",
    "finally , we have shown that it is possible to obtain even higher value of the figure of merit by increasing the number of atoms trapped inside the cavity ."
