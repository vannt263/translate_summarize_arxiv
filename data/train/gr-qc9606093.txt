    "gravitational collapse is one of the most interesting phenomena in general relativity .",
    "the dynamics of a spherically - symmetric massless scalar - field coupled to general relativity has two kinds of possible end states . either the scalar field eventually dissipates away leaving spacetime flat or a black - hole forms .",
    "numerical simulations of this model problem @xcite have revealed a very interesting phenomena  a kind of critical behaviour which is a feature of supercritical initial conditions very close to the critical case @xmath3 ( @xmath4 is a parameter which characterizes the strength of the initial configuration , and @xmath5 is the threshold value ) .",
    "more precisely , choptuik found a power - law dependence of the black - hole mass on critical separation @xmath6 of the form : @xmath7    subsequently the same type of critical behaviour has been observed for other collapsing fields : the collapse of axisymmetric gravitational wave packets @xcite , the collapse of spherically symmetric radiative fluids @xcite . in all these model problems the critical exponent @xmath8 turned out to be close to the value originally found by choptuik @xmath9 , suggesting a universal behaviour .",
    "however , maison @xcite has shown that for fluid collapse models with an equation of state given by @xmath10 the critical exponent strongly depends on the parameter @xmath11 .",
    "the second key feature of choptuik s results is the _ universality _ of the precisely critical @xmath12 evolution at the threshold of black - hole formation ",
    "it was found that the critical solution has a discrete self - similar behaviour ( discrete echoing with a period @xmath13 ) .    in this paper",
    "we summarize results from a study of spherically symmetric collapse of a _ charged _ ( complex ) massless scalar field .",
    "the main question we consider is whether it is possible to generalize choptuik s results for the general _ charged _ case @xcite .",
    "this generalization is not trivial since the introduction of charge - conjugation destroys the invariance of the evolution equations under the rescaling @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is an arbitrary positive constant .",
    "this invariance characterizes the system in the special neutral case and is crucial for the self - similarity of the critical evolution .",
    "this lack of invariance hints that charge - conjugation might destroy the phenomena in the general situation .    using a semi - quantitative arguments , which is based upon different behaviour of the mass and charge under the rescaling @xmath16 , we conjecture that the significance and influence of the charge decreases during the evolution and that the critical behaviour appears . following this",
    "we provide a numerical evidence which confirms the generalization of the mass - scaling relation and echoing phenomena for the _ charged _ situation .",
    "so far , the mass - scaling relation of the black - hole , and the influence of perturbations on the critical evolution itself , have been studied in context of internal perturbations in the initial conditions , such as a deviation of the field s amplitude from the critical one .",

    "the algorithm proceeds as follows : first we integrate along @xmath33 for a fixed @xmath34 and find in succession the quantities @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",

    "the numerical approach to the horizon is stopped eventually by an overflow of @xmath72 or underflow of @xmath73 .",

    "the main improvements of our version for the charged case closely resembles that of ref .",
    "@xcite where this method was used to study the critical solution for the special neutral case .",
    "we will now describe shortly the sources of inaccuracy and the methods that we use to overcome them .",
    "the first source of an inaccuracy arises from the fact that the expressions for the quantities @xmath85 and @xmath56 contains an explicit factor of @xmath86 which diverges to the origin .",
    "we overcome this by using a taylor expansion of @xmath38 in @xmath33 : @xmath87 then we expand the quantities @xmath88 and @xmath56 in @xmath33 , where the expansion coefficients are all functions of @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "thus , in order to treat the solution near the origin one needs to find only these coefficients .",
    "this is done by fitting the first three values of @xmath38 to a second - order polynome : i.e. we solve equation ( [ eq27 ] ) for @xmath91 and @xmath92 to obtain @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "we then use these coefficients to evaluate the values of @xmath95 and @xmath96 for the first two values of @xmath33 .",
    "the values of these quantities for other values of @xmath33 is then determined using a three - point simpson method for unequally spaced abscissas .",
    "a second source of inaccuracy arises directly from the behavior of the critical solution itself - as the critical solution evolves each successive echo appears on spatial and temporal scales a factor @xmath97 finer than its predecessor .",
    "this problem is solved as follows : the number of grid points decreases during the evolution .",
    "once a null trajectory arrives at the origin @xmath76 it bounces and disperses along @xmath77 to infinity . the grid point is therefore lost when the light ray hits the origin . as the number of points decrease by half we double the number of grid points and we interpolate the new grid points which are half way in between the old ones .",
    "we chose the outermost grid point in such a way that this ingoing light ray hits the zero - mass singularity of the critical solution itself .",
    "thus the doubling of the grid gives us just the exact logarithmic scaling needed at the origin .",
    "our grid is highly nonuniform in @xmath34 if a horizon forms - as we approach to the horizon the step size @xmath73 decreases rapidly .",
    "furthermore , even if the grid is evenly spaced initially , it will not remain so during the evolution @xcite .",
    "however , when we consider two grids in which one has twice the number of grid points as the other , the coarser grid spacing will remain twice the size of the finer grid , when we consider points at the same physical location .",
    "we will discuss , therefore , our numerical convergence in terms of the initial grid spacing .",
    "we denote the relative size of the initial grid spacing by @xmath98 . from the condition ( [ eq24 ] )",
    "we see that the spacing @xmath73 is proportional to @xmath98 . as we have mentioned , we treat eqs .",
    "( [ eq16 ] ) and ( [ eq17 ] ) as ordinary differential equations in @xmath34 , and we solve these using a fifth - order runge - kutta method @xcite , the error - term is @xmath99 .    the calculation of the quantities @xmath100 and @xmath56 in these equations is nontrivial , and is given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq7 ] ) , ( [ eq8 ] ) , ( [ eq13 ] ) , ( [ eq14 ] ) , ( [ eq9 ] ) and ( [ eq19 ] ) respectively .",
    "the integrals are discretized using three - point simpson method , the error term in the integration is @xmath101 , where @xmath102 is the fourth derivative of the integrand @xmath103 @xcite .    as we go from one grid to a finer one ( i.e. doubling the grid when the number of grid points reach half of the original number ) we have to interpolate to obtain the values at the new grid points .",
    "the error term in the interpolation is @xmath104 .",
    "as was mentioned in @xcite , the main source of error is the boundary conditions @xmath105 and @xmath106 at @xmath48 .",
    "we treat these boundary - conditions by approximating the true value of @xmath107 using an interpolation according to eq .",
    "( [ eq27 ] ) , the error term is @xmath108 .",
    "the situation is even more complicated : the right hand - side of ( [ eq16 ] ) contains an explicit factor of @xmath86 , which in the exact solution is canceled by the boundary conditions .",
    "three reasons lead to the crucial importance of checking the behaviour of the solution near the origin , in order to establish our confidence in the numerical results :    1 .   the risk of numerical instability caused by the explicit factor of @xmath86 .",
    "2 .   the solution at some value of @xmath33 depends only on the solution at @xmath109 , so a numerical error in the quantity @xmath38 near @xmath48 , would cause an error at each @xmath33 , and in all the relevant physical quantities .",
    "the critical solution itself , which is the main issue of this work , appears on ever smaller spatial scales during its evolution , leading to the formation of a zero - mass singularity at @xmath48 , and the importance of our confidence in the numerical solution near the origin is therefore clear .    as we can see , @xmath110 is the basic quantity which influence all the other physical quantities , and at each and every value of @xmath33 .",
    "figure 1 displays the error in @xmath110 . in this figure",
    "the initial data is of family @xmath111 , with amplitude @xmath112 , and @xmath113 ( see v ) for a discussion of initial data ) . for these initial conditions",
    "the gravitational field is strong @xmath114 , and the scalar - field undergo a terminal gravitational collapse into a charged black - hole .    due to the fact that there are no useful analytical solutions available , we use of the numerical solution itself as the reference solution .",
    "the reference solution was taken as the solution with 1600 grid - points , and it was compared with the solutions of 800 , 400 , 200 , 100 and 50 grid - points .",
    "the difference of @xmath110 between a given calculation and the reference calculation was squared , summed ( for different vales of @xmath34 ) and the square root was taken . the top part of fig .",
    "1 establishes visually that the code converges : this graph displays the real part of the scalar field @xmath115 for different relative spacing of the grid - points : 1/1600 , 1/800 , 1/400 , 1/200 , 1/100 and 1/50 .",
    "the numerical errors are so small that the six lines ( for the different grids ) actually overlap .    the bottom part of fig .",
    "1 establishes empirically the stability and convergence of the code when we decrease the grid spacing : the numerical error varies as @xmath116 , where @xmath117 .",
    "the fact that the power is close to 3 at the origin is an indication that this error is caused by our handling of the @xmath48 boundary conditions .",
    "furthermore , we have performed by a similar manner a calculation of the error in @xmath118 . the top part of fig .",
    "2 displays again the fact that the numerical errors are so small that the different lines ( for the different grids ) actually overlap . the bottom part of fig .",
    "2 establishes once again the stability and convergence of the code : the error varies as @xmath116 , where @xmath119 .",
    "this value of the power indicates that in this regime the discretization error due to the interpolation which we use in order to maintain the number of grid - points is dominant .",
    "in this section we present our theoretical predictions and numerical results for the gravitational collapse of a scalar field , for both the uncharged and for the charged cases .",
    "the numerical results that we present arise from a study of several families of solutions , whose initial scalar field @xmath120 profiles are listed in table i :    [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     families ( a ) and ( b ) represent uncharged scalar - field while families ( c ) and ( d ) represent charged ( complex ) scalar - field .",

    "we discuss the critical solution @xmath121 itself , both for the previously studied uncharged case and for the newly studied charged one .",
    "first , we had to find the value of the critical parameter .",
    "this was done by a binary search until we found the value of the critical parameter to the desired accuracy .",

    "the generalization to the charged case is not trivial .",

    "this invariance characterizes the system in the neutral case and it is essential for the appearance of critical , self similar behaviour .",
    "the lack of this invariance raises the interesting question whether critical behaviour will appear in the charged case .    using a semi - qualitative argument , which is based upon different behaviour of the mass and charge under the rescaling @xmath16",
    ", we might be able to answer this question . as the critical solution evolves",
    "its structure appears on ever smaller spatial ( and temporal ) scales .",
    "for the special neutral case we know that each successive echo appears on spatial and temporal scales which are a factor @xmath130 smaller than its predecessor . under the rescaling @xmath16",
    "we have : @xmath131 where @xmath132 are the parts of @xmath72 and @xmath56 which do not depend on @xmath1 , and @xmath133 are the additions in the charged case .",
    "since @xmath134 we learn from eqs .",
    "( [ eq30]-[eq35 ] ) that as the field evolves , the significance and influence of the charge on the evolution near the origin is reduced .    furthermore , as the oscilations proceed the scalar field approaches a real function times a constant phase @xcite .",
    "this leads to an addtional decrease in the charge of the form : @xmath135 where @xmath136 is a positive constant ( see section v.d ) .",
    "when both effects are combined together @xmath137 decreases with each echo , approximately from @xmath138 . looking at the right hand side of equation ( [ eq16 ] )",

    "the black - hole mass is proportional to its radius and either the mass or the radius could be the physical order - parameter . in the charged case the black hole radius equals @xmath182 and in general it is no longer proportional to @xmath56 .",
    "however , as we approach the critical - solution , the significance of the charge decreases with each echo . the quantity @xmath137 becomes smaller as the black - hole mass gets smaller and it is impossible to distinguish between the two possibilities .",
    "so far , the mass - scaling relation of the black - hole , and the influence of perturbations on the critical evolution itself , have been studied in context of internal perturbations in the initial conditions , such as a deviation of the field s amplitude from the critical one .",
    "it is of interest to study the behaviour of the critical solution under _ external _ perturbations . in particular , we have studied the behaviour of the critical evolution under two external perturbations :    1 .",
    "addition of a cosmological - constant @xmath0 to the critical solution itself .",
    "an addition of a charge - conjugation @xmath1 to critical initial - conditions of a complex neutral scalar - field .",
    "adding an external perturbation to the critical solution , which has a self - similar character , is expected to yield dynamical instability  a growing deviation from the critical evolution toward either subcritical dissipation or supercritical black - hole formation .",
    "in the situation where the external perturbation to the critical solution ( which , in the unperturbed case , is expected to form a zero - mass singularity ) leads to a formation of a black - hole , we have studied the question whether or not there is a power - law dependence of the black - hole mass on the _ external _ parameter : @xmath0 or @xmath1 .",
    "the amplitude was first set to its critical value @xmath183 ( for @xmath184 ) .",
    "we then add a cosmological - constant , @xmath0 , and study its influence on the evolution of the critical solution .",
    "@xmath185 led to a dissipation of the critical solution and , on the other hand , @xmath186 was found to give a finite - mass black - hole formation .",
    "we have studied the behaviour of the black - hole mass as a function of the cosmological constant .",
    "this is analogue to the addition of an _ external _ magnetic field to a system of magnetic moments and studying the magnetization dependence on the strength of the external field exactly at the critical temperature @xmath187 ( at @xmath188 the magnetization is zero without an external magnetic field , just as the zero - mass singularity for @xmath189 and @xmath184 ) .",
    "the analogy arises from the fact that in both cases the _ external _ perturbation , magnetic - field or a cosmological - constant , forces the order - parameter to have a non - zero value at @xmath190 or at @xmath191 , correspondingly .    for @xmath192 , the generalization of eq .",

    "evidence for the _ universality _ and the power - law dependence of the black hole mass on the _ external _",
    "parameter @xmath0 is shown in fig . 7 which displays @xmath178 as a function of @xmath195 for critical initial - conditions @xmath196 .",
    "the points are well fit by a straight line , i.e. @xmath197 where @xmath198 .",
    "the amplitude was first set to its critical value @xmath183 for the families ( c ) and ( d ) , with @xmath199 . for @xmath199 ,",
    "the initial conditions represent uncharged complex scalar - field .",
    "we then add a charge - conjugation , @xmath1 , and studied its influence on the evolution of the critical solution .",
    "we have studied the behaviour of the black - hole mass as a function of the charge - conjugation @xmath1 ( keeping the amplitude on its critical value @xmath183 ) .",
    "the numerical results are shown in fig .",
    "8 , which displays @xmath178 as a function of @xmath200 .",
    "the points are well fit by a straight line , i.e. @xmath201 where @xmath202 .    in order to have a more detailed picture of the formation for a charged black - hole near the phase - transition",
    "we have studied the conditions required the formation of a charged black - hole and the dependence of its mass on the critical separation @xmath203 and on the charge - conjugation @xmath1 .",
    "this was done both for subcritical initial - conditions and for supercritical initial conditions as well , which are close to the phase - transition @xmath204 .",
    "9 displays the dependence of the black - hole mass which forms from subcritical initial conditions @xmath205 as a function of @xmath161 and @xmath206 , for family ( c ) .",
    "this provides a numerical evidence for the conjecture that external perturbation such as charge - conjugation can lead to a black - hole formation with subcritical initial - conditions @xmath207 .",
    "charge oppose gravitation but the electromagnetic energy density also contributes to the gravitational binding , and by doing so it permits the formation of a black - hole even from subcritical initial - conditions .",
    "the critical charge - conjugation @xmath208 , needed to obtain large enough deviations from the otherwise evolution , followed by black - hole formation from subcritical initial conditions , is well described by a power - law dependence on critical - separation @xmath209 : @xmath210 where @xmath211 ( see fig .",
    "11 displays the dependence of the black - hole mass formed from supercritical initial conditions @xmath114 as a function of @xmath161 and @xmath206 , for family ( c ) .",
    "we learn that near the phase - transition , the larger the critical separation @xmath6 and the charge - conjugation @xmath1 , the larger is the black - hole mass .",
    "the slope of the right edge of the surface is @xmath8 , which is consistent with eq .",
    "( [ eq45 ] ) .",
    "the slope of the left edge of the surface is @xmath212 , which is consistent with eq .",
    "( [ eq49 ] ) .",
    "it should be emphasized that the tight relation between the various critical - exponents @xmath213 and @xmath214 , which all describe the _ instability _ of the critical evolution under a variety of different _ perturbations _ , is a strong evidence supporting the conjecture that there exists one mechanism which can explain the power - law dependence of the black - hole mass on the various parameters , both for internal perturbations in the initial conditions , and for external perturbations as well .",
    "we have shown in 5.a that the black - hole charge tends to zero faster than its mass for @xmath215 .",
    "we demonstrate now that @xmath216 as a power law with a critical exponent larger than @xmath212 ( see also @xcite for an independent analysis of this problem ) .. define @xmath217 as the charge after @xmath166 echoes . from ( [ eq32 ] and [ eq32a ] )",
    "it follows that @xmath218 substituting ( [ eq41 ] ) into ( [ eq51 ] ) and assuming that @xmath219 does not depend on @xmath6 we obtain @xmath220 where @xmath221 is a family - dependent constant .    from this analytic argument",
    "we deduce two conclusions :    1 .",
    "the black - hole charge is expected to have a power - law dependence on critical separation @xmath6 , where the critical - exponent @xmath222 is closely related to the critical - exponent @xmath8 of the mass according to @xmath223 .",
    "2 .   the black - hole charge tends to zero with @xmath6 more rapidly than its mass .",
    "12 displays @xmath224 as a function of @xmath161 for near - critical black - holes , where @xmath225 is the normalized black - hole charge in units of the initial - charge in the critical - solution .",
    "the points are well fit by a straight line whose slope is @xmath226 .",
    "this is consistent with the relation ( [ eq52 ] ) .",
    "another way to determine the value of @xmath222 is directly from eqs .",
    "( [ eq51 ] and [ eq52 ] ) .",
    "13 displays @xmath227 as a function of @xmath166 , the number of echoes , along the critical solution .",
    "the slope is @xmath228 . using @xmath143 and @xmath9 we find @xmath229 , in agreement with the prediction , @xmath230 , of gundlach and martin - garcia@xcite .",
    "the data shown in figs . 12 and 13 come from the charged family ( c ) . for family ( d )",
    "we have found that in general the charge increases as the critical separation @xmath231 increases although this correlation is not well described by a power - law dependence .",
    "the reason for this situation probably comes from the initial stage of the evolution ( note that the initial data contains layers of both positive and negative charge whose relative magnitude depends on @xmath4 .",
    "consequently , the assumption that @xmath219 does not depend on @xmath6 breaks down for this configuration .    despite of this , our numerical results qualitatively confirm our prediction  the black - hole charge tends to zero with @xmath6 faster than its mass . from here",
    "we conclude black - holes with infinitesimal mass , which , according to this mechanism , can be created from near - critical evolutions , are neutral , or obey the relation @xmath2 .",
    "we have studied the spherical gravitational collapse of a charged ( complex ) scalar - field .",
    "the main issue considered is the generalization of the critical behaviour , originally discovered by choptuik for neutral fields , for the general _ charged _ case .",
    "this generalization is not trivial , since the introduction of a charge - conjugation destroys the invariance of the evolution equations under the rescaling @xmath232 , which characterizes the system in the neutral case and is crucial for the self - similarity of the critical evolution .",
    "this lack of invariance hints that charge - conjugation might destroy the phenomena in the general situation .",
    "however , we have shown that the significance and influence of the charge decreases during the evolution and consequently the critical behaviour appears . as @xmath215",
    "the black - hole charge tends to zero faster than its mass , i.e. @xmath233 .",
    "thus , we conjecture that black - holes of infinitesimal mass , which can be created from near - critical evolutions , are neutral , or obey the relation @xmath2 .",
    "consequently , we find both the mass scaling relations for supercritical solutions and the echoing phenomenon for the critical solution .",
    "the charge of the black hole also depends , as a power law on the separation from criticality .",
    "the critical exponent , is @xmath234 .",
    "we have also studied the response of the critical solution to _ external _ perturbations . in particular , we have studied the behaviour of the critical evolution under an addition of a cosmological - constant @xmath0 , and an addition of charge - conjugation @xmath1 to critical initial - conditions of a complex neutral scalar - field . we have found a power - law dependence of the black - hole mass on _ external _ parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 .    under the influence of these external perturbations it is possible to form black - holes from subcritical @xmath235 initial conditions .",
    "once more , the critical charge - conjugation @xmath208 , which is needed to form black - holes from subcritical initial - conditions , is well described by a power - law dependence on critical separation @xmath236 .",
