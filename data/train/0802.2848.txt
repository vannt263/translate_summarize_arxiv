    "khovanov classified in  @xcite all possible frobenius systems of rank two that give rise to link homologies via his original construction in  @xcite , and showed that there is a universal one corresponding to @xmath1/(x^2 - hx -a),$ ] where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are formal variables . using bar - natan s  @xcite approach to local khovanov homology and khovanov s work in  @xcite , the author showed in  @xcite how to construct a bigraded tangle cohomology theory depending on one parameter , via a setup with webs and foams  singular cobordisms ",
    "modulo a finite set of relations ; see also  @xcite for a longer , more detailed version of  @xcite .",
    "the construction corresponds to a frobenius algebra structure defined on @xmath4[x , a]/(x^2-a),$ ] and for the case of links it is a categorification of the quantum @xmath0-link invariant , thus of the unnormalized jones polynomial of the link . adding the relation @xmath5 or @xmath6 yields an isomorphic version of the @xmath0 khovanov homology  @xcite or lee s theory  @xcite , respectively .",
    "the advantage of working with webs and foams instead of classical @xmath7dimensional cobordisms , and of considering the fourth root of unity @xmath8 in the ground ring is that the construction brings up a theory that satisfies functoriality property in a proper sense , that is , with no sign ambiguity . in particular",
    ", it resolves the sign indeterminacy in the functoriality property of the khovanov homology ( see bar - natan  @xcite , jacobsson  @xcite or khovanov  @xcite for proofs of the functoriality of khovanov s invariant ) .    in the first half of this paper",
    ", we generalize the construction described in  @xcite to obtain the _ universal _ @xmath0-link cohomology  universal in the sense of  @xcite  given by @xmath4[x , a , h]/(x^2 - hx -a),$ ] where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are formal parameters .",
    "the invariant of a tangle is a complex of graded free @xmath4[a , h]$]-modules , up to cochain homotopy , and its cohomology is a bigraded tangle cohomology theory .",
    "the good news is that the generalized theory still satisfies the functoriality property with no sign indeterminacy .    besides generalizing the construction in  @xcite and thus obtaining a better invariant",
    ", we go further in the second half of the paper to show more insights about the new theory . since any surface - link can be regarded as a cobordism between empty links , our construction yields an invariant of such surfaces .",
    "we prove that the invariant of a surface - knot or surface - link depends only on its genus .",
    "we also work over @xmath9 and take @xmath2 and @xmath3 to be complex numbers , instead of formal parameters .",
    "inspired by the work of mackaay and vaz  @xcite , we show that there are two isomorphism classes of the invariant of a link , depending on the number of distinct roots of the polynomial @xmath10    we remark that the universal @xmath0-link cohomology is equivalent to a perturbed khovanov - rozansky cohomology  @xcite for @xmath11 in which the `` potential '' @xmath12 is replaced by @xmath13 the new potential is homogeneous of degree 6 , with @xmath14 and @xmath15 the corresponding perturbed khovanov - rozansky theory was described in  @xcite .",
    "for our purpose , we are interested in working with the @xmath0-link invariant via an approach with _ webs _ , and for this , we consider the oriented state model for the jones polynomial instead of the classical approach .",

    "the two facets on the two sides of a singular arc have opposite orientation , and because of this , the two facets induce the same orientation on the singular arc .",
    "specifically , the orientation of singular arcs is as in figure  [ fig : saddle ] , which shows examples of piecewise oriented saddles .        for each singular arc , there is an ordering of the facets that are incident with it , in the sense that one of the facets is the _ preferred facet _ for the corresponding singular arc .",
    "this ordering is induced by the ordering of edges at bivalent vertices , in the following sense : the preferred facet of a singular arc contains in its boundary the preferred edges of the two bivalent vertices that it connects . in particular ,",
    "a pair of bivalent vertices can be connected by a singular arc only if the above rule is satisfied .",
    "if the preferred facet of a singular arc is at its left ( where the concept of `` left '' and `` right '' is given by the orientation of the singular arc ) , then we will usually represent the singular arc by a continuous red curve .",
