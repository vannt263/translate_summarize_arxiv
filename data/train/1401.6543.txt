    "the link reliability in single - input - single - output ( siso ) fading channels is poor due to lack of diversity .",
    "one way to improve the link reliability is to get diversity gains through the use of multiple antennas .",
    "diversity gains can be achieved even in single - antenna systems using rotation coding @xcite or transmit power control @xcite .",
    "transmit power control requires channel state information at the transmitter ( csit ) .",
    "whereas , rotation coding does not require csit .",
    "the idea in rotation coding is to use multiple channel uses and precode the transmit symbol vector using a phase precoder matrix without requiring more slots than the number of symbols precoded .",
    "a @xmath2 phase precoder matrix with optimized phases is shown to achieve a diversity gain of two in siso fading channels @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the rotation coding idea has been exploited for large precoder sizes .",
    "instead of using optimized phases in the precoder matrix ( solving for optimum phases for large precoder sizes is difficult ) , pseudo - random phases are used .",
    "also , the issue of detection complexity at the receiver for large precoder sizes has been addressed by using the low complexity likelihood ascent search ( las ) algorithm in @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that with pseudo - random phase precoding ( prpp ) and las detection , near - exponential diversity is achieved in a siso fading channel for large precoder sizes ( e.g. , @xmath3 precoder matrix ) .",
    "recently , spatial modulation ( sm ) is getting increasingly popular for multi - antenna communications @xcite,@xcite .",
    "sm is a transmission scheme that uses multiple transmit antennas but only one transmit rf chain ( thus requiring less rf hardware size , cost and complexity ) . at each time",
    "instant , only one among all the transmit antennas will be active and the others remain silent .",
    "the index of the active transmit antenna will also convey information bits in addition to the information bits conveyed through modulation symbols ( e.g. , qam ) .",
    "an advantage of sm over conventional modulation is that , for a given spectral efficiency , conventional modulation requires a larger modulation alphabet size than sm .",
    "for example , conventional modulation ( with 1 transmit antenna and 1 transmit rf chain ) requires 8-qam or 8-psk to achieve 3 bpcu spectral efficiency . whereas , in sm ( with 4 transmit antennas and 1 transmit rf chain ) the same spectral efficiency can be achieved using bpsk . this is because while the bpsk symbol can convey 1 bit , 2 additional bits can be conveyed through the index of the chosen transmit antenna .",
    "this possibility of using a smaller modulation alphabet size in sm , in turn , results in snr gains ( for a given probability of error performance ) in favor of sm over conventional modulation @xcite,@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we exploit the advantages of both sm and prpp simultaneously .",
    "our contributions in this paper are as follows .",
    "* we propose a method to precode both the modulation bits and the antenna index bits in sm systems using pseudo - random phases .",
    "we refer to this system as prpp - sm system .",
    "the novelty here is that while conventional prpp system uses a square precoding matrix of size @xmath4 ( where @xmath5 is the number of channel uses ) , in prpp - sm system , in order to precode the antenna index bits in addition to the modulation bits , we use a rectangular precoding matrix of size @xmath6 ( where @xmath7 is the number of transmit antennas ) .",
    "* for small precoder sizes ( e.g. , @xmath0 ) , we demonstrate using ml detection that the prpp - sm system significantly outperforms prpp system ( without sm ) and sm system ( without prpp ) , for the same spectral efficiency .",
    "this performance advantage is because of the snr gain due to the use of smaller alphabet size and diversity gain due to phase precoding . * for large precoding sizes ,",
    "we propose a low complexity detection algorithm based on local search .",
    "the novelty here is a suitable neighborhood definition that takes into account the antenna index bits in the prpp - sm signal set .",
