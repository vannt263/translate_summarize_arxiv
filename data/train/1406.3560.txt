    "in this supplementary material we provide details of the atomic calculations used to find magic conditions for monochromatic and bichromatic traps .",
    "we adopt an effective hamiltonian approach between the ground states of cesium .",
    "it is effective by virtue of the fact that no excited states explicitly appear in the hamiltonian , instead our off - diagonal coupling terms account for the virtual processes through the excited states .",
    "we again write down an example hamiltonian between @xmath89 and @xmath90 before delving into the computational specifics .",
    "@xmath91 we have left the hyperfine interaction ( hfi ) as a perturbation term and thus all of the polarizability terms use fine structure energy denominators . for the second order polarizability",
    "we use the notation of @xcite    @xmath92    with the following further definitions for the reduced polarizability and polarization tensor @xmath93    @xmath94    with @xmath95 a tensor rank corresponding to the scalar , vector and tensor polarizabilities , @xmath96 a spherical tensor component , @xmath97 a polarization vector written in the spherical tensor basis , @xmath98 the nuclear spin and @xmath99 the total spin and orbital angular momentum of the ground and excited state , respectively .",
    "@xmath49 is the reduced rabi frequency with @xmath100 , @xmath101 is the optical intensity and @xmath102 is the elementary electric charge . as stated before @xmath103 is the energy difference between the ground state and an excited state without any hyperfine splitting , i.e. just fine structure energies .",
    "we write all of our results in terms of the reduced rabi frequency , @xmath104 .",
    "finally , we only included four excited @xmath105 states in our calculations @xmath106 .",
    "the reduced matrix elements from the @xmath11 ground state to these states are given in sec .",
    "[ sec.numbers ] .",
    "the static polarizability is dominated by the @xmath107 terms , on the order of 96% according to @xcite , and the dynamic polarizabilities near these transitions are even more dominated by @xmath107 since the energy denominators are even smaller for these states by roughly a factor of @xmath108 with @xmath68 the detuning from @xmath107 while leaving relatively unchanged those of other states .",
    "the only other notable contribution is from @xmath109 , being the next allowed dipole transition , but as can be seen the reduced radial matrix element is an order of magnitude smaller along with carrying a much larger energy denominator for the cases we study .",
    "next is the hyperfine - mediated polarizability , @xmath110 , that consists of two electric dipole couplings and a hyperfine interaction ( hfi ) coupling .",
    "this can be split into 4 broad categories based on the nature of the hfi matrix element : diagonal in the ground state , off - diagonal mixing of the ground state with other @xmath47 and @xmath111 levels , diagonal in the excited @xmath105 levels , and off - diagonal mixing of excited @xmath105 levels .",
    "we only account for those terms with a hfi diagonal in the ground states and those that mix the @xmath80 ground state with excited @xmath47 states , as including other terms results in a smaller than 1% correction .",
    "more detailed discussion of the hyperfine - mediated polarizability can be found in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the term with the hfi matrix diagonal in the ground state term can be written as @xmath112 where @xmath113 with the replacement @xmath114 , and @xmath115 the diagonal matrix element of the standard magnetic dipole hyperfine operator@xcite @xmath116 in the ground states .",
    "the other term involving hyperfine mixing of the @xmath117 ground state with excited @xmath47 states is a bit trickier .",
    "we approximate the hyperfine constant characterizing the mixing as @xcite @xmath118 which is verified empirically to work at the 1% level .",
    "the matrix element is related to this constant in the usual way @xmath119 and the operator appearing in the hamiltonian is @xmath120 with @xmath121 where in one reduced matrix element the ground state is replaced by an excited @xmath117 state,@xmath122 , and the energy denominator is now @xmath123 and we include a sum over excited @xmath47 states . for this calculation",
    "we only include mixing up to @xmath25 and use reduced electric dipole matrix elements calculated from a wkb approximation for elements involving @xmath124 or higher .",
    "it is vital to note that the sign of the reduced matrix elements is now crucial since they are no longer squared in the polarizability , @xmath125 .    combining the above contributions the hyperfine - mediated polarizability is @xmath126 where the first term is diagonal and the second also contributes an off - diagonal vector component .",
    "we keep this vector component in our calculations though it is dwarfed by the second order vector polarizability by a factor that is approximately the hyperfine mixing matrix element divided by the energy difference between the ground state and an excited @xmath117 state or @xmath127 .",
    "two sources contribute the majority of the error in our calculation .",
    "first , the accuracy of our wkb approximation of the reduced dipole matrix elements connecting @xmath107 and @xmath109 to excited @xmath47 levels is unknown .",
    "secondly , @xmath128 is known to converge slowly as a function of the included excited states and thus our truncation at @xmath25 will introduce nontrivial inaccuracies .",
    "comparison with recent experimental determinations of the dc stark coefficient , @xmath129 , yields an error of approximately 5% .",
    "a more pertinent test for our calculations is to compare against the experimental data in @xcite for the differential light shift per unit of intensity . for 780 nm light",
    "they record @xmath26 compared to our value of @xmath27 and for 532 nm light they measured @xmath28 whereas we calculate @xmath29 .",
    "thus , in both cases we are within experimental error bars and differ by no more than 15% .",
    "finally there are zeeman terms @xmath130 here we have specialized to the case of a static magnetic field polarized along @xmath131 .",
    "the diagonal coeffiients @xmath22 give the usual expression for the hyperfine zeeman shifts @xmath132 for the cs ground state @xmath133 , @xmath134 , and the nuclear land factor is @xmath135 with @xmath136 the bohr magneton and @xmath137 the nuclear magneton .",
    "representing coupling via the carrier laser and @xmath86 that of the sideband .",
    "four potential terms can contribute , but only two are important at any one time depending on sign of the sideband frequency @xmath138 .",
    "when @xmath139 two of the dressed states are becoming nearly degenerate with a dressed state of the other atomic ground state .",
    "this gives rise to a fourth order term that is tunable by the strength of the sideband and the sideband frequency.,width=321 ]    we now extend the above hamiltonian to the two frequency case where we dress the ground states with sideband fields .",
    "the basis is @xmath140 where @xmath141 and @xmath142 are the photon numbers of the two fields with energy @xmath143 and @xmath144 , respectively , and @xmath145 .",
    "the matrix dimension is then threefold larger than the monochromatic case as each ground state has two additional dressed states that differ in energy by @xmath146 from the original state . in all other respects they are identical and",
    "the above definitions for matrix elements are still valid except that we must keep track of when the sideband amplitude is used . to this end",
    "we introduce @xmath147 when the sideband is one of the field amplitudes in the polarizability , @xmath85 , and assume that when @xmath19 appears that one computes it for the carrier amplitude and the sideband amplitude , @xmath148 where @xmath86 , is the reduced rabi frequency for the sideband .",
    "finally , for brevity we make the following substitution @xmath149 and omit the vector contribution of the hyperfine - mediated polarizability , though again it is included in our full calculation .",
    "we write down a @xmath150 example hamiltonian for the ground states in the above basis with non - elliptical polarization for both fields .",
    "@xmath151 at this point one can diagonalize and find the eigenvalues of the states @xmath152 and @xmath153 to acquire the shifts of the atomic state due to the magnetic and a.c . electric fields .",
    "in this section we list the hyperfine constants and radial reduced matrix elements used for calculations .",
    "table i gives hyperfine constants and tables ii - v give radial matrix elements .",
    "where possible we have used numerical values from @xcite . for other transitions",
    "we have used the values found from wkb calculations following the theory of ref . @xcite . as a check on the wkb calculations we compare them in the tables to the published values in @xcite and to coulomb wave function ( cwf ) calculations .",
    "the wkb and cwf calculations use effective quantum defects extracted from the energy values listed in @xcite .",
    "we estimate the error of the wkb matrix elements to be less than 10% on the basis of comparison to values from @xcite .",
    "the cwf and wkb calculations give a value for @xmath154 which is converted to a reduced matrix element using @xmath155 when calculating the third order hf - stark polarizability the sign of the reduced matrix elements is significant . note that @xmath156 thus @xmath157 but @xmath158 .",
    "there is inconsistency in the literature as regards signs of published reduced matrix elements .",
    "we have taken the signs from our cwf or wkb calculations which agree with each other ."

    "<S> our solutions provide a viable and flexible approach for achieving extended coherence with trapped alkali atoms .    </S>",

    "<S> then the differential shift is @xmath55 and after taking the appropriate derivatives @xmath56 doubly magic trapping occurs when both derivatives simultaneously vanish for a set of parameters @xmath57 , thus eliminating the first order sensitivity to both electric and magnetic fields .    </S>",

    "<S> as we will show , this term can not be neglected and the implication is that there exist not magic wavelengths , but magic intensities for most wavelengths . finally , we emphasize that while solving the above equations will yield approximately correct results , our primary search method is to diagonalize the ground state hamiltonian and look for local minima ( or maxima ) in the differential shift that is equivalent to a doubly magic operating point .    </S>",
    "<S> the influence of the hyperpolarizability on magic trapping conditions has been shown to be important for optical atomic clocks@xcite , but has been neglected in previous analyses of microwave clocks . when field strengths reach @xmath60 the hyperpolarizability can not be neglected when calculating energy shifts of alkali atom ground states@xcite . to put this value in perspective an optical dipole trap for cs atoms based on a modest power of 20 mw at @xmath61 focused to a waist ( @xmath62 intensity radius ) of @xmath63 </S>",

    "<S> for detunings large compared to the excited state hyperfine structure we can estimate when the contribution of the fourth order term to the differential shift becomes as important as that of the hyperfine - mediated polarizability , i.e. the magic intensity point . @xmath65 and @xmath66 , with @xmath67 the hyperfine splitting of the two states and @xmath68 the detuning from the excited state , which suggests an order of magnitude of @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> the implications of this relationship are that the hyperpolarizability becomes important at lower intensities in atomic species with smaller ground state hyperfine splitting , e.g. rubidium compared to cesium . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig.6p12 ] illustrates the importance of the fourth order and cross - terms by graphing the differential shift with and without them .    </S>",
    "<S> the primary lesson to be drawn from these two terms is that it is inappropriate to talk about magic wavelengths . </S>",
    "<S> even if searching purely for magic conditions in one field the operating laser intensity and magnetic fields are interdependent and the system is now nonlinear in the intensity . adjusting the laser intensity then tunes the relative strength of these terms and allows for magic conditions at a more diverse set of wavelengths .    </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately we were unable to find doubly magic conditions for monochromatic trapping light of any wavelength for any pair of states . </S>",
    "<S> it is possible that some elliptical polarization we did not check or just a more precise calculation could turn up something useful . </S>",

    "<S> increasing the bias magnetic field increases the trap depth of the magic intensity for the states @xmath78 . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , increasing the detuning increases the trap depth and decreases the residual sensitivity to the trapping light . </S>",
    "<S> we chose @xmath79 for the magnetic field since it is very close to the magic magnetic field for the @xmath2 states with no trapping light and thus elucidates how important a proper accounting of the aforementioned cross - term is for accurately assessing magic conditions .    in order to achieve true doubly magic traps we adopt the idea of radnaev et al.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they envisioned applying another laser that would couple the two ground @xmath80 hyperfine levels via a two - photon transition where the photon fields differ in frequency by very near the hyperfine splitting of the two ground states . </S>",
    "<S> practically , this could be accomplished by a high frequency phase modulator that adds a frequency shifted sideband at approximately the hyperfine ground splitting , e.g. @xmath81 in cesium . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we obviate the need for another laser and automatically match the intensity profile of the second light frequency to that of the primary trapping light .    </S>",
    "<S> we modify our computational apparatus to incorporate dressed ground states that differ by plus or minus a sideband frequency . </S>",
    "<S> essentially , the hamiltonian matrix grows three fold as for each ground state we add two levels with identical quantum numbers to the original except that the diagonal element has @xmath82 , the difference between the carrier and sideband frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> the matrix is then populated as before . </S>",
    "<S> we include an explicit example in @xcite . a fourth order term that is roughly @xmath83 arises , where @xmath84 uses the field amplitude of the sideband and the carrier , i.e. @xmath85 with @xmath86 the reduced rabi frequency of the sideband . </S>",
    "<S> this term is much like the fourth order term introduced for a single frequency in that it couples a ground state to the other ground state and back , but in this case that other state is a dressed state nearly resonant with the initial state due to the sideband . </S>",
    "<S> the denominator depends on the difference of the sideband frequency @xmath87 and the qubit frequency @xmath88 . </S>",
    "<S> this then gives us two levers with which to adjust this fourth order term s magnitude and sign : the intensity of the sideband and its frequency . </S>",
    "<S> we assume pure @xmath7 polarization for all results regarding the bichromatic scheme .    in table [ tab.doublefreq ] </S>",
    "<S> we present the results of our search for doubly magic conditions with physically feasible parameters . </S>",
    "<S> as can be seen , doubly magic conditions exist for blue and red detuned traps and multiple pairs of states . bringing the sideband frequency closer to the qubit frequency </S>",
    "<S> lowers the magic magnetic field , the trap depth and the residual sensitivity to the trapping light . </S>",
    "<S> reducing the sideband intensity reduces the residual light sensitivity for a given magic trap depth and magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> lastly , the residual magnetic field sensitivity is entirely determined by the pairs of states chosen and even then is approximately the same for all pairs at the doubly magic point . </S>",
    "<S> thus , bichromatic trapping light allows one to not only create a doubly magic trap but also to tune the parameters of the trap by adjusting the sideband strength and frequency .    </S>",
    "<S> we conclude by reiterating our results for doubly magic trapping conditions . our analysis established that the fourth order stark shift term is vital to differential stark shift calculations at typical operating conditions and further explored the implications of the interaction of the laser and magnetic fields . with these tools we demonstrate light insensitive traps for a wide array of wavelengths , pairs of states , and bias magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> we then extended our analysis to a bichromatic trap with two optical frequencies separated by an amount similar to the splitting of the hyperfine ground states in cesium . in doing so </S>",
    "<S> , we discovered doubly magic conditions in red and blue detuned traps for states separated by only one or two photons . </S>",
    "<S> these results provide a method for obtaining insensitivity to trapping lasers and magnetic field noise that could potentially improve atomic clock and quantum information experiments . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we have relaxed many of the stringent requirements on wavelength , polarization , and states previously reported in the literature , making magic trapping more accessible to future experiments . </S>",
    "<S> we anticipate that similar results will be found for other alkali atom species .    </S>",
