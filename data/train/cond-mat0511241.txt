    "the theoretical understanding of the structural and mechanical properties of static granular assemblies is still an open issue @xcite . indeed , there is no consensus on how the stress distribution should be expressed and how granular materials respond to applied perturbations .",
    "experimental measurements of stress distributions in silos and sandpiles  @xcite seem to be incompatible with a simple elastic theory and have led to the development of new mechanical formulations for granular matter where new assumptions are proposed @xcite .",
    "the equations of equilibrium for the stress tensor , @xmath0 , are @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the density of the medium and @xmath3 the gravitational acceleration vector . from this equation",
    "we see that the stress is indeterminate .",
    "for instance in 2d , it provides two independent equations for the three components of the stress tensor ( the stress tensor is symmetrical , @xmath4 ) .",
    "thus a third constitutive equation ( the missing equation ) characterizing the behavior of the material is needed in order to provide closure to the problem . in the elastic formulation closure",
    "is provided by the introduction of the strain field and new constitutive relations relating the strain with the strain ( hooke s law ) .",
    "this leads to elliptic equations governing the stress distribution @xcite . unlike elasticity where the closure is provided by hooke",
    "s law new granular models propose closure relations involving only stress tensor components @xcite .",
    "hyperbolic equations of the same mathematical structure as a wave equation are thus obtained . as a consequence ,",
    "a load applied at the surface propagates along two characteristic directions .",
    "another theoretical framework of stress transmission in granular matter ( the q - model ) was introduced by coppersmith _",
    "it considers the transmission of interparticle forces by a random redistribution of forces among nearest neighbors . at the continuum scale",
    "@xcite , the stress components satisfy a parabolic equation of diffusion , expected from the stochastic uncorrelated nature of the transmission process .",
    "thus , different theories predict different stress distributions according to the nature of the equations governing the stress .",
    "the importance of resolving which of these models apply under which circumstances is of major theoretical and practical interest in order to reveal the real mechanical properties of static granular assemblies .    in order to test the validity of the different models ,",
    "a simple experiment was proposed by de gennes  @xcite : the calculation of the green function by applying a perturbation force on a grain in the granular medium and measuring the resulting stress field perturbation .",
    "the elastic and the new models predictions are then confronted . in the most simple case of an homogeneous isotropic material ,",
    "the elastic framework predicts that the vertical stress profile resulting from the perturbation is a single peak centered below the perturbation with a width @xmath5 proportional to the depth @xmath6 from the perturbation . in the hyperbolic models",
    ", the stress profile presents a distinctive double peak and in the parabolic models the profile is a single peak as in the elastic prediction but with a width proportional to @xmath7 .",
    "the green function problem has divided the granular community into two .",
    "for some researchers , the problem is well settled by now , in particular after the experimental work of reydellet and clement @xcite and geng _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite in favor of the validity of elasticity theory to model the response function .",
    "their experiments indicate a single peak in the stress distribution in @xmath8 in qualitative agreement with the elastic framework .",
    "moreover , @xcite shows that the elastic framework can be further extended to anisotropic system .",
    "however , other experiments @xcite show evidence for the possible validity of alternative approaches : @xcite discusses the lateral diffusion of vertical stress increments due to the local application of a force in a brick wall ; @xcite and @xcite focus on relatively small scale response experiments and @xcite on ordered lattices ; the study on isostatic networks of @xcite and @xcite show deviations from elasticity .",
    "these groups argue that on approaching the isostatic point the elasticity theory would break down and new approaches need to be considered to describe the stress response . on the other hand",
    "some groups @xcite argue that in the isostatic limit the hyperbolic equations do not describe the stress field .",
    "recent work @xcite suggest that there exist a characteristic length above which elasticity is valid and below anomalous behaviour of isostaticity should be observed .",
    "also , it was shown that the degree of ordering @xcite and the texture properties of packings @xcite affect strongly the stress transmission .",
    "even though , there is general consensus that the elastic theory may describe qualitatively the system , many discrepancies still remain @xcite .",
    "a microscopic study is needed to perform a _ quantitative _ assessment of the validity of the different theoretical approaches .",
    "simulations offer an optimum scenario to compare the different theories and allow to obtain microscopic information @xcite and the exact system dynamics @xcite , difficult to observe in experiments .    here",
    "we perform md simulations to gain more microscopic insight into the mechanical response of granular matter .",
    "our results indicate that the elastic theory can describe the simulations better than the other models .",
    "indeed , we find a stress response whose vertical component shows one peak .",
    "furthermore we show that elasticity predicts very accurately all components of the stress tensor at all depths in the packing , for all the ranges of pressures , porosities and frictional properties studied in this work .",
    "we developed a numerical code based on the discrete element method ( dem ) .",
    "the model deals with an assembly of elastic spheres interacting via the hertz - mindlin contact laws .",
    "the grains interact with one another via non - linear hertz normal forces @xmath9 which depend on the overlap between two spheres , and frictional transverse forces @xmath10 which depend both on the shear and normal displacements between the grains : @xmath11 where @xmath12 with @xmath13 and @xmath14 the radii of the spheres in contact .",
    "the normal overlap between the two grain is @xmath15 , and @xmath16 is the relative shear displacement between the two grain centers .",
    "the constants @xmath17 and @xmath18 are defined in terms of the shear modulus @xmath19gpa and the poisson s ratio @xmath20 of the material of the grains .",
    "coulomb friction , @xmath21 , @xcite is also included in the model and we set the friction coefficient @xmath22 . we also include viscous damping terms in the equations of motions ( translational and rotational ) to allow the system to relax toward static equilibrium . in this study , the grains spherical are constrained to move in 2d .",
    "the packings are prepared using binary mixtures of particles at equal concentrations characterized by a radius @xmath23 mm in order to avoid crystallization .",
    "we study different sample sizes ranging from @xmath24 to @xmath25 particles equilibrated using periodic boundary conditions in the horizontal directions and two rigid walls made of grains at the top and the bottom of the system ( see fig .",
    "[ system_geometry ] ) . in order to prepare the larger samples ( @xmath26 ) at static equilibrium and save computational time on the preparation procedure , we repeated periodically in space the elemental sample ( @xmath24 ) equilibrated using periodic boundary condition in both horizontal and vertical directions .",
    "for instance , to prepare a packing with size @xmath27 , we repeat the elemental packing twice in both horizontal and vertical directions .",
    "we found no significant difference for large system size , so that most of the results presented here are for @xmath28 particles , which were obtained without applying the repeating technique .",
    "we use a numerical compaction protocol designed to prepare confined dense granular isotropic packings explained in detail in  @xcite .",
    "we set the gravity @xmath29 since the pressures of confinement considered in this work are sufficiently high .",
    "a packing is isostatic @xcite when the number of contact forces equals the number of force balance equations . in a packing of perfectly smooth ( frictionless ) particles ,",
    "there are @xmath30 unknown normal forces and @xmath31 force balance equations , where @xmath32 is the dimension and @xmath33 is the average coordination number .",
    "this result in a minimal coordination number needed for mechanical stability as @xmath34 , i.e. , @xmath35 and @xmath36 in 2d and 3d ( see fig .",
    "[ coordination_number ] , the system is at the isostatic limit with @xmath37 as @xmath38 ) . in the case of packings of perfectly rough particles , which is realized by frictional particles with infinite friction @xmath39 [ note that in this case there are still tangential forces given by the mindlin elastic component eq .",
    "2 ] , in addition to @xmath30 unknown normal forces and @xmath31 force balance equations , there are @xmath40 unknown tangential forces and @xmath41 torque balance equations @xcite .",
    "thus the coordination number in the isostatic limit is @xmath42 , i.e. , @xmath43 and @xmath44 in 2d and 3d for frictional packings . in such isostatic packings ,",
    "there is possibly a unique solution for the forces between particles for a given geometrical configuration , because the number of equations equals the number of unknowns .",
    "the existence of isostaticity is the foundation of recent theories of stress propagation in granular materials @xcite .",
    "here we use a specific preparation protocol which sets the friction between particles to zero . after a sample",
    "is equilibrated at a given pressure , we consider two situations to calculate the green function : ( i ) frictionless case , @xmath45 ; ( ii ) frictional case , @xmath46 .",
    "note that in ( ii ) friction is turned on an equilibrated frictionless packing only for the calculation of the green function .",
    "thus , this case is far from the isostatic frictional case @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "we use a frictionless preparation because ( 1 ) we want to avoid issues of path dependence in the sample preparations and ( 2 ) to obtain the isotropic packings with large coordination number ( 6 in 3d , see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "our preparation protocol tries to mimic the shaking that is usually applied to the packings in experiments to remove unstable voids that would otherwise render the system unjammed . in a sense , the packings that we obtain are analogous to the  reversible \" packings obtained in the compaction experiments of nowak _ et al _ @xcite",
    "this preparation scheme was tested against experiments in our previous computations of sound speeds in granular materials @xcite .",
    "we find very good agreement between experiments and simulations .",
    "thus we believe that it is a reliable method to prepare the packing",
    ". however it will be very interesting to see the response behavior for a packing prepared with friction .",
    "for this case , extreme care has to be taken to assure that the packing is jammed and reversable , i.e. , that there are no unstable voids .",
    "we have recently developed a preparation protocol to provide jammed frictional packings @xcite .",
    "the green function calculation will be applied to this frictional packings to investigate the validity of elasticity as the frictional isostatic point is reached .",
    "we check the isotropy and randomness of the packings by calculating both the texture tensor and the 2d orientational order parameter  @xcite .    in a first part",
    ", the simulated granular aggregates are prepared with target pressure of @xmath47 n / m ( equivalent to a pressure of 10mpa in 3d ) and result with an average coordination number @xmath48 ( see fig .",
    "[ coordination_number ] ) and a solid volume fraction @xmath49 . in a next part , in order to be closer to the isostatic point , we show results for lower pressures @xmath50 n / m and @xmath51 n / m ( equivalent to 100kpa and 1mpa in 3d ) with @xmath52 and @xmath53 ( see fig . [ coordination_number ] ) compared to the isostatic limit @xmath35 , and @xmath54 and @xmath55 slightly above the random close packing limit of @xmath56 .",
    "the next step of the preparation protocol consists to break the vertical symmetry of the system by removing the periodic conditions in the vertical direction and replacing it by rigid walls made of rough particles at this time .",
    "next , we select the particle nearest to the center of the system and apply a vertical downward force .",
    "the amplitude of the force , @xmath57 ( where @xmath58 is the average normal force in the packing ) , is small enough to assure that we measure the linear response regime . to calculate the local stress tensor @xmath59",
    ", the system is subdivided into square cells of size @xmath60 mm containing about @xmath44 to @xmath61 particles depending on their local arrangements ( see upper left corner of fig .  [ system_geometry ] ) .",
    "the results are independent of the size of the coarse - graining cell in the range @xmath62 to @xmath63 .",
    "we have performed these simulations using three different system sizes in a range @xmath64 to @xmath65 in order to find the minimal size to consider to avoid finite size effects .",
    "the aspect ratio @xmath66 to @xmath67 is needed for the appropriate study of the stress response function because the width is of the order of @xmath6 .",
    "we find that the vertical response is less sensitive than the two others component to the sample size .",
    "we have also compared the vertical response functions above and below the perturbation , respectively in the dilatation region and in the compression region .",
    "we find an horizontal symmetry @xmath68 , showing that the compression response and the dilatation response are almost identical in the studied linear regime .",
    "we measure @xmath69 in units of @xmath62 with @xmath70 at the center of the packing .",
    "we consider system sizes ranging from @xmath71 @xmath72 to @xmath73 @xmath74 .",
    "we find no appreciable size effects in this range for @xmath75 and slight size effects for @xmath76 and @xmath77 saturating above @xmath78 @xmath79 .",
    "the perturbation of the stress is calculated as @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the stress of the initial reference state before the perturbation and @xmath82 is the stress after the perturbation is applied ( @xmath83 corresponds to compression ) . because of the discrete nature of the material and the strong inhomogeneity of the contact network @xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ system_geometry ] ) , we average the stress response functions over many configurations of particles ( about @xmath84 ) .",
    "the application of the force on the central particle generates a pressure wave which propagates in the granular packing ( as seen in the inset of fig .",
    "[ green_fonction_sigmaij_and_normalf]a ) and is reflected at the rigid and periodic boundaries . the wave is dissipated slowly over time until the packing reaches a new static state at mechanical equilibrium .",
    "figure  [ green_fonction_sigmaij_and_normalf]a presents the evolution with time of the vertical stress @xmath85 at different depths @xmath6 below the perturbation in the compression region . at all depths , a first stress maximum is observed at the passage of the front wave ( local instantaneous response in the propagative regime , point a ) , followed by a rapid oscillation and then a slow relaxation ( point b ) .",
    "then , a new stress peak of smaller amplitude is measured ( point a ) which corresponds to the wave reflected at the boundary followed by the same decrease sequence towards complete relaxation to the new static state ( point b ) .",
    "the further the point of measurement is , the smaller is the amplitude of the first stress maximum resulting from the expansion of the front .",
    "figure  [ green_fonction_sigmaij_and_normalf]b plots the stresses at equilibrium as well as the perturbation of the normal interparticle forces , @xmath86 .",
    "we clearly see the existence of a single peak in @xmath8 in agreement with elasticity and the experiments of @xcite and in disagreement with the predictions of the hyperbolic theories of stress transmission .",
    "next , we make a detailed comparison with the prediction of elasticity theory . in the case of an infinite elastic medium",
    "the solution was calculated by boussinesq @xcite : @xmath87 however , there is no analytical solution for the boundary conditions used in the present part of the study , i.e. , rigid top and bottom rough boundaries where the strain satisfies @xmath88 and @xmath89 ( this conditions can be expressed in terms of the stress tensor as @xmath90 and @xmath91 respectively , where @xmath92 is the poisson ratio of the entire packing @xcite ) and horizontal periodic boundary conditions .",
    "then , we find the solution of eq .",
    "( [ stress ] ) numerically @xcite .",
    "the applied perturbation @xmath93 is taken to be a narrow gaussian centered at @xmath70 , such that @xmath94 .    in the theory , the stress distribution is not sensitive to the poisson ratio as we find numerically .",
    "moreover , this result was confirmed in previous simulations @xcite . since the results are independent of @xmath92 , a possible choice is to set the poisson ratio equal to the effective poisson ratio , @xmath95 , which is given by simulations @xcite .",
    "moreover , the effective poisson ratio of a granular packing is independent on pressure .",
    "[ note that some groups found the poisson coefficients varying with confining pressure , for frictionless packings at the approach of the isostatic limit @xcite and frictional packings with lower coordination number @xcite ] .",
    "this can be seen from the effective medium theory calculations @xcite , which gives : @xmath96 , where @xmath97 and @xmath98 are the effective bulk modulus and shear modulus , respectively . due to the same power law relations of @xmath97 and @xmath98 versus pressure",
    ", @xmath99 and @xmath100 , the effective poisson ratio @xmath101 is independent of the pressure .",
    "therefore we use the same @xmath101 for all our systems at different pressures .",
    "we note , however , that the results of @xcite are for 3d while our systems are 2d .",
    "other choices of @xmath92 would give the same results as presented here .",
    "figure [ stress_response_fonctions_elasticity_simulations]a shows how the elastic solution compares with the numerical results for the stress components .",
    "the elastic solution provides a very satisfactory fit at all depth for all the components of the stress tensor .    _",
    "width of the stress profile. _ we obtain the width of the vertical stress profile as a function of the depth @xmath6 by calculating the half - amplitude spread of the distribution  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ stress_response_fonctions_elasticity_simulations]b shows a linear dependence on the depth , @xmath102 , in general agreement with elasticity ( and in disagreement with the parabolic model @xcite ) .",
    "the numerical response ( @xmath103 ) exhibits a slightly narrower response than the elastic solution ( @xmath104 ) ; it was also found in experiments  @xcite and could be attributed to the disorder of the packing .    _",
    "pressure and friction effects_. we also study the stress response functions for different pressures ( from @xmath105 n / m to @xmath106 n / m ) and porosities on smaller systems ( @xmath107 and @xmath108 ) shown in fig .",
    "[ green_function_pressure_friction_dependence]a .",
    "we find that the stress profiles averaged over @xmath84 realizations are in extremely good agreement with the elastic prediction for rough boundaries .",
    "moreover the profiles do not show appreciable pressure dependence .",
    "this is in further agreement with elasticity .",
    "indeed the elastic solution depends only on the poisson ratio @xmath92 which is constant with pressure  @xcite .",
    "moreover , we find the same linear dependence with the depth ( @xmath109 ) for the studied range of pressure ( see inset of fig .",
    "[ green_function_pressure_friction_dependence]a ) .",
    "the agreement with elasticity holds very well also for the two others components .",
    "we also investigate the effect of friction by performing simulations with frictionless packings ( @xmath110 ) in the same range of pressure and with the same system size shown in fig .",
    "[ green_function_pressure_friction_dependence]b .",
    "this time , we compare the stress profiles averaged over @xmath111 realizations ( due to much larger fluctuations ) with the elastic prediction for smooth boundaries ( i.e. , @xmath112 ) .",
    "we find that the stress profiles show a small pressure dependence and that the agreement with the elastic prediction holds better for the smallest pressure .",
    "the reason for the discrepancy could come from the fact that even though the particles are frictionless , the fixed grains at the top and bottom surface induce a roughness , the effect of which is expected to be more important at high pressures . indeed despite non - frictional particles , a non - zero shear stress is found at the boundary , whose amplitude increases with pressure .",
    "the linear dependence of the half - amplitude show similar dependence with pressure .",
    "our numerical work shows that , for the studied frictional and frictionless packings , the vertical component of the stress response has a single peak at all depths and that the half - amplitude width of the vertical stress profiles is proportional to the depth . by calculating the stress profiles using the elasticity framework and taking into account the exact geometry of the simulations , we compare the numerical results and find very good agreement with elasticity for the three components of the stress tensor in the frictional case . whereas",
    ", experiments probe only the vertical stress profile at the boundary , our numerical simulations are able to show the agreement with elasticity at all depth inside the packings and all the components .",
    "furthermore , we confirm that pressure is not a critical parameter for the stress response function of frictional packings .    however , it is important to note that we have not investigate the frictional isostatic point . near this critical point",
    "the system may show deviations from elasticity .",
    "thus , we may still expect corrections to appear if the system is prepared closer to the isostatic frictional jamming point @xmath43 in 2d .",
    "it will be of interest , then , to continue this work and investigate the critical regime as well .",
    "we also demonstrate that the response of frictionless packings is consistent with elasticity ; it exhibits pressure dependency and tends to agree with elasticity at low pressure .",
    "we attribute this effect to the roughness of the boundaries in our simulations . in further work",
    ", it would be interesting to confront the more general anisotropic elastic theory to the response of loose and anisotropic packings obtained by other compaction protocols .",
    "we thank p. claudin , e. clement , y. gueguen , d. l. johnson , e. kolb , d. pisarenko and c. song for stimulating discussions . this work has been supported by the department of energy and the national science foundation ."
