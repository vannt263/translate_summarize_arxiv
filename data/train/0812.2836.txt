    "an outflowing wind carries away angular momentum and thus spins down the stellar rotation . winds with magnetic fields exert a braking torque that is significantly larger than for non - magnetic cases , due to the larger lever arm of magnetic field lines that extend outward from the stellar surface .",
    "a seminal analysis of this process was carried out by weber & davis ( wd , 1967 ) , who modelled the angular momentum loss of the solar wind for the idealized case of a simple monopole magnetic field from the solar surface . in terms of the surface angular velocity @xmath3 and",
