    "since they were discovered @xcite , quasars have been found to be aperiodically variable from radio to x - ray and gamma - ray @xcite , whose uv / optical emissions vary in flux on an order of @xmath1 - 20% and on characteristic timescales ranging from days to years @xcite . currently , the studies of quasar variability are generally based on long - term monitoring of individual sources @xcite , such as the optical gravitational lensing experiment ( ogle , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the sloan digital sky survey stripe 82 ( sdss , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and/or on the ensemble properties of quasars @xcite .",
    "on one hand , the former approach mainly employing spectral techniques , e.g. , power density spectra , structure functions , etc .",
    ", has revealed that the power density spectra of quasar optical light curves are of form of @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the frequency , on timescales of 100 to 1000 days @xcite and could become flattened on longer timescales @xcite .",
    "motivated by these results and the similar power density spectrum implied by the damped random walk ( drw ) process , @xcite ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) have demonstrated that the optical variations in agns could be well modeled with the drw process on timescales of weeks to years , though the power density spectra of some kepler agns appear much steeper , with slope of -2.6 to -3.3 , on shorter timescales @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the ensemble studies have uncovered several relationships between the optical variability amplitude and the physical properties of agns , including the anti - correlations with the observed wavelength , the bolometric luminosity , and the eddington ratio , the positive correlation with the bh mass , as well as no significant correlation with the redshift , etc . @xcite .",
    "in addition , the amplitudes of uv / optical variations are larger in bluer bands , which is also coined as the so - called bluer - when - brighter trend , that is , agns normally appear bluer when they get brighter @xcite .",
    "more strikingly , the variations across the uv / optical continuum almost simultaneously occur in phase , with a time lag less than 1 - 2 days inferred from local seyfert galaxies @xcite and more luminous quasars @xcite .",
    "although the physical origin for quasar variability and then the aforementioned observations are still unclear , it is widely accepted that the variations are generally intrinsic , thanks to the results from reverberation mapping showing that the variation of broad emission lines closely responds to that of the continuum just after some time lag ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "despite the changes of global accretion rate or the _ global temperature fluctuations _ could account for many aforementioned correlations and the bluer - when - brighter trend ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the hint that the characteristic timescale of quasar optical light curves could be identified with the thermal timescales of accretion disk is found by @xcite , when modeling the light curves as drw process .",
    "this stimulates @xcite to consider a simple inhomogeneous disk model with _",
    "localized temperature fluctuations _ undergoing drw process to simultaneously explain the observed larger size of accretion disk than that predicted by the standard thin disk , and the amplitudes of the optical variability .",
    "later on , @xcite demonstrated that , rather than changing the global accretion rate in the thin disk , the inhomogeneous disk model can better account for the bluer - when - brighter trend constructed from a sample of 604 variable quasars .",
    "recently , an interesting timescale dependence of the color variability in quasars , that is , short - term variations are even bluer than longer term ones at all redshifts up to @xmath4 , was discovered by @xcite , using the sdss @xmath5- and @xmath6-band photometric monitoring data for quasars in stripe 82 .",
    "such timescale dependency of the color variation can rule out the models that simply attribute the color variations to mixture of a variable disk emission with blue but constant color and a redder stable emission such as from the host galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "it can not either simply be explained by changes in the global accretion rate .",
    "a natural mechanism to the observed timescale dependent color variations , as @xcite already pointed out , is that short - term variations could be dominated by thermal fluctuations in the inner most region of the accretions disk where the disk is hotter and the disk emission is bluer , while longer term variations are produced over larger scales with lower effective disk temperatures .",
    "this yields an interesting consequence that quasar variations at different timescales correspond to different disk regions , and one could possibly utilize this effect to spatially resolve the otherwise un - resolvable accretion disk .",
    "it is therefore essential to numerically testify whether localized disk temperature fluctuations can reproduce a timescale dependent color variation pattern in quasars as observed . in the present work ,",
    "starting from the inhomogeneous disk model of @xcite we simulate localized disk temperature fluctuations and investigate the yielded color variations and the timescale dependency .",
    "the inhomogeneous disk models ( and necessary revisions ) and their implications are completely demonstrated in sections  [ sect : model ] and [ sect : results ] , respectively , and discussed in section  [ sect : discussion ] .",
    "finally , a brief summary is presented in section  [ sect : conclusion ] .",
    "the disk fluctuation has been proposed to be responsible for the uv / optical quasar variability , which has been shown to be sufficiently described by the drw process @xcite . besides directly describing the optical light curves , the drw model has also been assumed for the temperature fluctuation of independent zones on the accretion disk to depict the optical quasar variability @xcite . following @xcite , we construct similar inhomogeneous disk models to test whether they can present the timescale dependent color variability of quasars recently discovered by @xcite .    as reference",
    ", we consider a standard thin disk surrounding a schwarzschild black hole ( bh ) with mass @xmath7 , whose innermost radius , @xmath8 , is assumed to be the same as the innermost stable circular orbit , @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the gravitational radius .",
    "the temperature profile of the standard thin disk as a function of radius , @xmath6 , is given by @xmath11 \\right\\}^{1/4}~{\\rm k},\\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath12 is the stefan - boltzmann constant and @xmath13 the accretion rate . unless otherwise stated , we will consider our reference models with typical bh mass @xmath14 and accretion rate @xmath15 , corresponding to the eddington ratio @xmath16 for radiation efficiency @xmath17 .",
    "note that our main results on the timescale dependent color variations do not depend on these selections ( see section  [ sect : parameters ] for discussion ) .    to avoid the fluctuating regions being stretched along the radial direction , the accretion disk is split into totally @xmath18 square - like zones in @xmath6 and @xmath19 with @xmath20 layers and @xmath21 zones per each layer from the inner boundary @xmath8 to a given outer boundary @xmath22 .",
    "the number of layer @xmath20 equals the integral part of @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the radial boundary ratio of each layer .",

    "since the temperature fluctuations have been simulated under the drw process , which is only one of the vast array of autoregressive models , one may worry about that the results discussed in this work may depend on the assumed specific autoregressive model .",
    "however , this simple drw process has been shown to be able to provide significant good description of quasar light curves on timescales of days to years at the level of data quality of the ogle and stripe 82 surveys ( @xcite ; however , see @xcite ) .",
    "especially , @xcite have shown that the simple drw process is by far the best model for quasar light curves from stripe 82 and is favored over many other deterministic and stochastic models , including multiple drw process , higher order continuous autoregressive processes , composite models , etc . complementing that the structure functions of the simulated light curves in all considered models are generally consistent with that of a singel drw process ( see section  [ sect : sf ] )",

    "to be more specific , the timescale dependent color variability of quasars is considered within two distinguishable inhomogeneous disk models : one ( thereafter , * model a * ) analogous to that of @xcite is parameterized with radius - independent @xmath81 days and @xmath85 dex , the other revised one ( thereafter , * model b * ) is of radius - dependent @xmath86 , where @xmath87 days , @xmath88 , and constant @xmath85 dex .",

    "in fact the mean seds averaged over different luminosity ranges , i.e. , the over - luminous ( @xmath94 of luminosity distribution ) , mid - luminous ( @xmath95 ) , and the under - luminous states ( @xmath96 ) , are almost always blued at shorter wavelength , comparing with the standard thin disk model . meanwhile the under - luminous states ( @xmath96 ) could be slightly redder at @xmath97 2000 , particularly with larger @xmath24 ( thus smaller @xmath21 ; cf .",

    "alternatively , the analyses can be performed in flux - flux space to directly measure the color of difference spectrum , which is free from contamination of non - variable component .",
    "however , as shown in @xcite , the color of difference spectrum of quasars shows also clear redshift dependence due to variable emission lines and balmer continuum , indicating the effects of which can not be neglected either for analyses in flux - flux space . in figure",

    "as expected , arbitrary shifts are still required to match the absolute values of @xmath155 from simulations to observations . nevertheless , the slope in the @xmath155 ",
    "@xmath38 relation is again nicely reproduced by our simulations .",
    "the parameters of the inhomogeneous disk ( @xmath38 , @xmath40 and their possible radius dependence ) could also depend on smbh mass and accretion rate , for which the observed sample span considerably large ranges , instead of the single values we adopted in this work .",
    "more fundamentally , the inhomogeneous disk model still encounters two problems .",
    "one of them is that the thin accretion model predicts bluer uv spectra than observed ( see review by @xcite ) .",
    "once introducing temperature fluctuations , the time - averaged sed is even bluer than the one without ( see the top panels of figures  [ fig : qv_sed_lbol_llambda ] or [ fig : qv_bwb_ruan14 ] ) .",
    "therefore , the tension between the observed composite sed and the modeled one predicted by the thin disk would be further aggravated .",
    "on the other hand , dust extinction and/or disk outflow could yield redder disk seds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "nevertheless it is complicated by the extensive debate on whether the origin of agn sed can be attributed to a geometrically thin , optically thick accretion disk or not ( see reviews by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to finally settle down the delicate dependence of @xmath38 and @xmath40 on radius for inhomogeneous disk model",
    ", we need to firstly work on a more realistic disk model .",
    "it is possible as demonstrated by @xcite that the thin accretion disks are indeed , if not all , responsible for the origin of agn seds once included various improvements , such as general relativistic corrections , radiation transfer in the disc atmosphere , dust extinction , and/or disk winds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the correlations between @xmath5- and @xmath6-bands at all redshifts are strong and almost the same at zero lag , except that when the wavelength difference is larger , e.g. , @xmath112-@xmath108 .",
    "the widths in the cross - correlation functions reflect the characteristic timescales in the variation in corresponding light curves . ]",
    "the second one is the so - called coordination problem .",
    "observationally , the variations of several seyfert galaxies and few quasar at different uv / optical wavelengths are found to be quite coordinate ( @xcite ; see review by @xcite and references therein ) . delicately comparing the simulated inter - band correlations with observed ones are useful to testify and further improve the inhomogeneous disk models .",
    "the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : qv_sed_lbol_llambda ] shows the simulated light curves at three uv / optical bands from the inhomogeneous disk models .",
    "both ( radius - independent and radius - dependent @xmath38 ) models produce well correlated light curves at the effective wavelengths of @xmath97 4640  and @xmath97 6122 , consistent with observations .",
    "more quantitative assessments are presented in the figure  [ fig : qv_sed_comp_ccf ] showing that the cross - correlation functions of the simulated @xmath5- and @xmath6-band light curves at two redshifts for both inhomogeneous models are found to be highly correlated ( @xmath201 for @xmath202 and @xmath203 ) at zero time lag .",
    "instead , @xcite has shown the inhomogeneous disk model of @xcite produces weaker inter - band correlations comparing with light curves of stripe 82 quasars , suggesting further revisions to the models are required .",
    "it seems that our results somewhat contradicts that stated by @xcite , yet showing that the inter - band correlations with smaller wavelength differences , e.g. , @xmath202 , are indeed better .",
    "however , as @xcite adopted a different approach to assess the inter - band correlations , it is currently unclear that how good is the consistence both results even for the @xmath5-@xmath6 correlations and what is the reason for this potential difference , and we will leave this to a future work .    notably , the inter - band correlations implied by both models indeed become less correlated with increasing the wavelength difference of the two bands , e.g. , @xmath204 in figure  [ fig : qv_sed_comp_ccf ] or see figure  [ fig : qv_sed_lbol_llambda ] for @xmath97 1160  and @xmath97 4640/6122  light curves ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the current inhomogeneous disk models ,",
    "the fluctuations at different disk regions were assumed to be totally independent to each other .",
    "the coordinate problem can be greatly alleviated if temperature fluctuations from different disk regions are somehow linked ( such as through instability propagation , likely both inward and outward ) . with the propagation",
    ", the uv / optical variations could be more coordinated , at least at timescales longer than that for instability propagation . in upcoming papers",
    ", we will delicately consider this problem as well as those aforementioned previously .",
    "we have demonstrated that the inhomogeneous accretion disk model , similar to that of @xcite with radius - independent characteristic timescale for temperature fluctuations , conflicts with the discovery of a timescale dependent color variation of quasars by @xcite .",
    "the latter instead could be reproduced in an adjusted model whose characteristic timescales for temperature fluctuations are radius - dependent , unaffected by the un - even sampling and photometric error .",
    "this suggests that one may use quasar variations at different timescales to statistically probe accretion disk emission at different physical scales .",
    "we discuss further issues to be addressed in future simulations of inhomogeneous disks , including the discrepancy between the observed redder composite quasar sed and the modeled bluer one , and the coordination problem that variations at different uv / optical wavelengths occurs nicely in phase .",
    "interesting by - products of this work include :    \\1 .",
    "assuming individual zones in an inhomogeneous accretion disk fluctuate in logarithm temperature following drw process , the light curves of disk radiation ( both bolometric and broadband ) are not strict drw mathematically , but can be approximately fitted with drw .",
    "drw fitting however yields smaller characteristic timescales than the input values for temperature fluctuations , thus the characteristic timescales measured from real quasar light curves can not be directly used as that of temperature fluctuations in the corresponding disk zones .",
    "the inhomogeneous accretion disk models predict weak skewness in the magnitude ( or @xmath134 ) distribution of quasar light curves , i.e. , weak deviation from lognormal flux distribution .",
    "such weak skewness , consistent with model prediction , is detected using quasar light curves in stripe 82 .",
