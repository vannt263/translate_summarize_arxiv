    "efforts to understand the physics that drive the activity in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) have been underway for decades , and have recently seen rapid progress thanks to improvements in both instrument design and theoretical modeling .",
    "observationally , new facilities have provided important pieces of information , which when combined with advances in modeling have allowed a reasonably clear picture of the emission mechanisms in agn to emerge . the optical continuum ( up to 1 m ) of type - i agn ,",
    "is seen to be a power law , which can be explained by the existence of an accretion disk around a central supermassive black hole . at longer wavelengths ,",
    "one starts observing emission thought to arise from a dusty torus , which , depending on the geometry , peaks at wavelengths between 15 and 100 m. this emission is thought to be the reprocessed emission of the uv / optical radiation from the accretion disk by the particles composing the torus , namely silicate and graphite grains ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "studies with the infrared space observatory ( iso ) showed that the mid - infrared ( mir ) window can be used to distinguish agn from starbursts @xcite .",
    "furthermore , recent work conducted on a sample consisting of 25 quasars detected by the european large area iso survey ( elais ) at 15 m @xcite showed the potential of combined optical and mir observations in the construction of quasar samples , and in achieving a better understanding of the physical properties of agn .",
    "these studies also showed , however , the need for deeper multi - band observations in the mir in order to refine physical constraints on the torus models and unified schemes .    with the advent of spitzer it is now possible to obtain mir photometry for very large samples of galaxies .",
    "in particular , the spitzer wide - area infrared extragalactic survey ( swire ; @xcite ; @xcite ) offers an unprecedented opportunity to study the mir properties of agn thanks to both the large areal coverage ( @xmath0 deg@xmath1 ) and to the number of bands in which the fields are being observed ( irac bands 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 and 8 m and mips bands 24 , 70 and 160 m ) . in this paper",
    "we investigate properties of a complete optically selected spectroscopically confirmed type - i quasar sample from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , consisting of 35 objects .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "section [ sample ] describes the mir , optical and near - ir data available for this sample ; these properties are then used in section [ midselection ] in order to determine type - i agn candidate selection criteria from multi - color data .",

    ". notes on individual objects are given in section [ notes ] .",
    "finally , section [ discuss ] presents a discussion of the results .",
    "the mir data used here are taken from the swire elais n1 field , and were obtained in february 2004 with both irac and mips . for the purposes of this work",
    "only the four irac bands ( referred to as irac1 , irac2 etc throughout ) and mips 24 m ( hereafter mips24 ) are used .",

    "two of the objects only have 24 m detections as they fall in areas at the very border of the field and are not covered by irac , while four others have detections in all four irac bands but do not have mips 24 m observations due to the failure of some mips scans during the mips campaign .",
    "none of the non - detections are drop - outs , instead all are due to the inhomogeneous coverage of the field at its edges .",

    "the red dashed lines delineate the region of quasar candidates , with equations : @xmath14 @xmath15 @xmath16 the region defined here is only indicative , and the tolerance depends on the degree of completeness and the number of contaminants that are acceptable .    a total of 1870 quasar candidates populate the region inside the dashed lines .",

    "a type - i agn sample selected based on mir colors can not be entirely complete , and could also suffer from contamination by spiral and starburst galaxies at specific redshifts .",
    "when optical morphology is taken into account the resulting sample will be cleaner but less complete , as nearby type - i agn will probably be excluded .",
    "note also that the more mir information one adds the more accurate the selection can become ( see for instance @xcite ) , but then one is limited by the substantially lower sensitivity of irac channels 3 and 4 .",

    "the predicted redshift distribution is also close to the observed one , as can been seen by comparing the dotted line with the black dashed line in fig .",
    "[ figzhist ] .",
    "this good agreement is most probably due to the cut in the @xmath4-band , which most likely excludes all type - ii agn .",

    "the general shape of the seds roughly follows the quasar template but the use of all 35 quasars provides better sampling , and allows for the refinement of the template , especially in the ir .    using the 35 swire - sdss quasars , two new templates were constructed .",
