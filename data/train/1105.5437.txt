    "the ordinary electroweak gauge - bosons are understood as the lightest  kaluza - klein \" resonances of the five - dimensional gauge theory , whose light masses arise either through the boundary conditions imposed on the five - dimensional gauge fields , as in the case of higgsless models  @xcite , or through the vacuum expectation value of a composite scalar higgs  @xcite .    in both higgsless @xcite and composite higgs models @xcite , the observed mass - eigenstate fermions result from mixing between two kinds of gauge - eigenstate fermions : a set with quantum numbers resembling those of standard model fermions and a new set of vector fermions @xcite .",
    "the first set are elementary ( non - composite ) fermion fields that are only weakly coupled to the new strong dynamics , and they correspond to  brane - localized \" states that are largely confined to the ultraviolet boundary of the compactified space .",
    "in contrast , the new vector fermions are kaluza - klein resonances arising from the  bulk fields `` of the compactified five - dimensional theory , and in the dual four - dimensional theory they correspond to a tower of composite states arising from the underlying strong dynamics .",
    "the fermions observed in experiment correspond to the lighter mass eigenstates resulting from this mixing , and they are mostly composed of elementary fields with a smaller admixture of vector states ; we will refer to these as ' ' ordinary fermions \" .",
    "the heavier partner mass eigenstates , which have not yet been observed , are predominantly composed of the composite , vectorial states ; we will refer to these as  heavy vector fermions \" .",
    "their mass scale @xmath4 is typically in the @xmath5 gev range .",
    "the composition of the lighter mass eigenstates will affect their properties .",
    "consider , for instance , an elementary brane - localized fermion @xmath6 , whose left - handed component is a member of the weak doublet @xmath7 , and whose right - handed component is an electroweak singlet .",
    "we will denote by @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively , the degree of mixing of the weak doublet @xmath7 and weak singlet @xmath10 fields with the new vector fermions @xmath11 bearing the same lorentz and electroweak quantum numbers .",
    "then , as suggested by fig .",
    "[ fig : mass - fig ] , the mass of the lighter  ordinary fermion \" mass eigenstate resulting from the mixing will be of order @xmath12 .",
    "it is then clear that in order for the light flavors of the ordinary fermions to receive their appropriate masses @xmath8 and/or @xmath9 must be quite small , whereas for the top quark neither @xmath8 nor @xmath9 can be too small if @xmath13 is to have its observed value .",
    "hence , from the four - dimensional point of view , the light ordinary fermions will be essentially elementary , while the top - quark must be substantially composite .     and composite vector fermions @xmath11 , and a yukawa coupling between @xmath14 and @xmath10 is mediated by scalar @xmath15 .",
    "as discussed in the text , the mass of the lighter mass eigenstate will depend on the dirac mass @xmath4 of the vector fermions , and the mixing factors @xmath16.,width=377,height=151 ]    in these models , the hierarchy of ordinary fermion masses is then transferred to a hierarchy of the values of the mixing factors @xmath17 . in models with a warped extra - dimension , a possible explanation for such a hierarchy , results from the combination of the exponential factor in the ads@xmath18 metric , along with different fermion profiles in the bulk  @xcite .",
    "we will assume that the strong electroweak breaking dynamics incorporates either minimal @xcite or next - to - minimal @xcite flavor violation , and therefore that non - sm contributions of these strong dynamics to flavor - changing neutral currents are sufficiently suppressed to avoid conflict with experiment .",
    "fermion compositeness can yield significant corrections to low - energy observables ; some are beneficial and others are problematic . in higgsless models , for example , the presence of vector fermions with sm quantum numbers can cancel contributions to the @xmath19 parameter arising from the extended gauge sector @xcite .",
    "additional effects are expected to arise predominantly from the top sector , where the mixing factors @xmath20 are largest .",
    "two electroweak quantities are particularly sensitive to effects in the top - sector : the @xmath2 coupling , @xmath21 , and the deviation in the ratio of the @xmath22- and @xmath23-boson masses from that predicted in the sm , also known as the electroweak @xmath0 parameter @xcite .",
    "potential contributions to both parameters can be understood in terms of the ( approximate ) global symmetry structure of the new strong dynamics . just as in the sm ,",
    "contributions to @xmath0 can be suppressed if the symmetry breaking sector has an approximate @xmath24 symmetry which , via electroweak symmetry breaking , breaks to a diagonal custodial @xmath25 symmetry @xcite .",
    "furthermore , as shown by agashe _ et . al . _",
    "@xcite , corrections to the @xmath2 coupling can be suppressed if custodial symmetry is extended to include a left - right parity symmetry @xmath26  whose action consists in exchanging @xmath27 and @xmath28 charges  and making @xmath29 an eigenstate of @xmath26 . in this case , the required overall symmetry structure is @xmath30 .    due to the mass splitting between the top- and bottom - quark , neither the conventional @xmath25 nor",
    "the extended @xmath31 symmetry can be exact , even in the limit of zero hypercharge .",
    "@xmath25 requires that the top and bottom quarks form a doublet , and hence @xmath32 in the symmetry limit .",
    "@xmath31 symmetry requires that the top and bottom quark masses both equal that of an additional exotic quark of charge + 5/3 , with which they form a triplet @xcite . in the sm ,",
    "the dimension - four top - quark yukawa coupling @xmath33 breaks @xmath25 weakly , and is responsible for transmitting electroweak symmetry breaking to the top - quark sector .",
    "therefore , the leading sm corrections to both @xmath0 and @xmath21 are proportional to @xmath34 . in models",
    "in which the top - quark is composite , _",
    "i.e. _ has a large vector fermion component , the vector fermions can be members of custodial singlets , doublets , or triplets .",
    "however , unlike in the sm and simple generalizations thereof @xcite , both positive and negative corrections to @xmath0 and @xmath21 can be generated .",
    "this is both dangerous and interesting .",
    "it is dangerous because the sm predictions for @xmath0 and @xmath21 are in agreement with experiment .",
    "it is interesting because the agreement is not perfect : the sm prediction for @xmath21 is about @xmath35 below the measured value ( with weak dependence on the higgs mass ) @xcite , whereas the sm prediction for @xmath0 is in full agreement with experiment for a light higgs ( @xmath36 gev ) but is @xmath35 below for a heavy higgs ( @xmath37 gev ) @xcite .",
    "moreover , the measured left - handed and right - handed @xmath38 couplings have a strong and positive correlation , and the sm predictions are both approximately @xmath35 below their expectation values .",
    "in this paper we consider the effect of top compositeness on @xmath0 and @xmath21 , and discuss the patterns of top compositeness that can yield phenomenologically viable models . to begin , we examine the low - energy operators induced @xcite when the heavy vector fermion states are  integrated out \" at tree - level , and correlate the phenomenological properties of these operators with the custodial quantum numbers of these fermions . in sections",
    "iii and iv , we construct simple models that illustrate these effects by extending the sm via the addition of one weak - charged vector fermion multiplet mixing with the left - handed elementary top - bottom doublet , and/or one weak - singlet fector fermion mixing with the elementary right - handed top .",
    "these models may be considered as highly deconstructed versions  @xcite of full five - dimensional duals  @xcite to various underlying strongly - interacting composite higgs theories : deconstructions that de - scope the theory to include only one non - standard kaluza - klein fermion level . taken together",
    ", the simple models discussed illustrate the various ways in which the third - generation fermion masses arise in any strongly - interacting composite higgs theory with a weakly coupled five - dimensional dual .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : conclusions ] we compare our results to previous calculations in five - dimensional models , note what happens if the right - handed top is mixes with a triplet state , and present our conclusions .",
    "in this section we use an effective field theory analysis of top - quark compositeness to understand how integrating out heavy vector fermion states with different quantum numbers correlate with likely phenomenological effects on @xmath0 and @xmath39 .",
    "we will consider , in turn , the effects of mixing of new vector fermions with each of the third - generation quark states : the top - bottom doublet , the right - handed top , and the right - handed bottom quark , in situations with and without an overall custodial symmetry .",

    "the leading effects on both @xmath0 and @xmath39 may then be computed in the low - energy effective field theory @xcite .",

    "let us review a scenario from @xcite where the lagrangian terms that include the heavy vector fermion @xmath11 take the form @xmath41 where @xmath15 is a scalar coupling @xmath14 to @xmath10 . requiring the variation of @xmath42 with respect to @xmath43 to vanish yields the equations of motion @xmath44 which we may solve iteratively in @xmath45 . doing so , we find @xmath46 plugging these expressions into eq .",

    "both of these operators will affect @xmath58 at one loop because they alter the @xmath23 but not the @xmath22 propagator ( since the @xmath22 does not couple to @xmath10 ) .",
    "neither affects @xmath59 at tree level since they alter the @xmath60 vertex rather than the @xmath61 vertex ; however they could affect @xmath59 at one loop through diagrams with an internal top quark coupled to the decaying @xmath23 boson .",
    "both of these operators will be worth exploring further .",
    "when a right - handed state mixing with @xmath10 has been integrated out , as in @xcite , one obtains @xmath62 here , @xmath63 has the quantum numbers of the sm @xmath10 quark .",
    "this operator will affect both the @xmath64 and @xmath65 couplings ( and may therefore impact single - top production ) . because it does not also affect the @xmath66 coupling , it _ will _ alter @xmath58 at one loop  but _ will not _ affect @xmath59 at tree level ; it should generally impact @xmath59 at the one - loop level through diagrams with an internal top quark .",
    "this operator also merits further study .",

    "this operator affects the @xmath70 vertex at tree level and , as such , is very tightly constrained .",
    "therefore , this operator does not warrant further study at present .",
    "finally , if custodial and flavor symmetry protect the interactions of the sm - like top - bottom doublet , then integrating out the states mixing with @xmath10 and @xmath67 , as in @xcite , yields the custodially - symmetric operator @xmath71 in which @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "this operator does not contribute to @xmath58 at all .",
    "in the presence of a flavor symmetry , the operator will not alter @xmath59 either @xcite .",

    "a @xmath79 coupling can be induced , as occurs in the 3-site model , but this is again suppressed by @xmath80 and is unlikely to yield interesting limits .",
    "we will not explore either of these operators further .",
    "our discussion has identified three operators of potential phenomenological interest @xmath81 , and shown that they arise from mixing between fundamental top and bottom quarks with particular kinds of ( potentially composite ) vector fermions . in the next sections of the paper",
    ", we will introduce specific models that explore the ideas raised by our effective field theory analysis .",
    "section  [ sec : explicit ] proposes a pair of illustrative models in which the yukawa interactions explicitly break the @xmath25 custodial symmetry of the symmetry breaking sector . in the first model the right - handed top",
    "is mixed with a heavy vector singlet , so that this model explores operator ( [ eq : smtr - op ] ) , whereas in the second model the left - handed top - bottom doublet is mixed with a heavy vector doublet so that one instead explores operator ( [ eq : smtl - op ] ) .",
    "each of these models include all terms consistent with the gauge symmetries , and each is a renormalizable four - dimensional gauge theory .",
    "we will find that neither kind of mixing leads , on its own , to a more viable phenomenology  and this implies that models introducing both kinds of mixing at once will be similarly unsuccessful .    in section  [ sec : soft ]",

    "we first consider a model in which the left - handed top - bottom doublet is mixed with a heavy vector bi - doublet of @xmath84 ; integrating out the heavy vectors would give rise to the third interesting operator identified in our effective field theory analysis ( [ eq : extl - op ] ) .",
    "we find that this particular model has limitations , but also suggests a possible solution .",
    "we then instantiate that solution in a particularly economical way by embedding the top - bottom left - handed doublet itself in an @xmath84 bi - doublet @xcite , @xmath85 , while mixing the right - handed top with a heavy vector singlet . for each of the models considered in this section , in the limit of zero gauge couplings",
    ", the @xmath3 symmetry is softly broken due to a dirac mass term for the vector fermions . moreover , these two models contain @xmath31 triplet fermions including states of charge @xmath86 and @xmath87 which , after electroweak symmetry breaking , mix with the top - quark .",
    "we find that only models with these custodial triplet fermions feature both positive and negative contributions to @xmath0 and @xmath21 , leading to regions of the parameter space in which agreement with experiment is at the @xmath88 level .",
    "in this section we examine a pair of scenarios in which the custodial symmetry is explicitly broken by yukawa couplings .",
    "we will find that neither of these directions in model building , on their own , provides improved agreement with data on @xmath0 and @xmath21 , compared with the sm .",
    "this is because in both models the corrections to both parameters turn out to be uniformly positive and correlated with one another .",
    "a vector - like custodial / weak singlet fermion @xmath91 has the same charges as the right - handed top of the sm .",
    "adding such a field to the top - sector lagrangian gives @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the elementary left - handed top - bottom doublet , @xmath15 is the @xmath94 higgs doublet , and @xmath53 is the @xmath95 version of @xmath15 . while a yukawa term mixing @xmath96 with @xmath97 is also possible , it can always be removed by redefining @xmath97 and @xmath98 . for our analysis",
