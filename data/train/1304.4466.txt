    "while a non - degenerate stable ground state and metastable excited state may , indeed , be found in alkaline earth atoms @xcite , our description in the main text of the qubit states @xmath5 and @xmath4 as non - degenerate eigenstates of a bare atom hamiltonian is not in accord with the level scheme of most neutral atom candidates for quantum computing and information purposes .",
    "our analysis can , however , be applied for , e.g. , rubidium atoms in one of the following , slightly modified , forms : ( i ) the states @xmath77 and @xmath7 may be implemented as the `` stretched '' hyperfine ground state with @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and excited state with @xmath80 driven by circularly polarized fields , so that the transitions are closed , even under spontaneous decay @xcite . the @xmath7 state then decays only to @xmath4 and not to @xmath5 , as we allow in the main text , but since any transiently populated state converges to the dark state , this will only affect details in this transient evolution . the single atom stretched states are field sensitive , but their singlet combination is decoherence free under the influence of field fluctuations which are homogeneous over the separation between the atoms .",
    "( ii ) the states @xmath5 and @xmath4 may be implemented as the magnetic field insensitive ground states with @xmath81 , and @xmath82 , respectively , and the atoms may be excited with linearly polarized light . a constant magnetic field on the atoms will shift the zeeman ground states with @xmath83 different from zero . a realistic shift of a few @xmath84 suffices to detune the two - photon resonant transitions and hence prevent the dark state mechanism for excitation ladders with @xmath85 . as a consequence",
    ", atoms decaying into the corresponding zeeman ground states will become excited and undergo decay , until they eventually reach the @xmath86 dark state , which remains the only dark state of the system .",
    "simulations with multi - level systems verify that this mechanism works , also in the presence of additional fields serving to repump population from unwanted components of the @xmath5 state manifold .",
    "we have shown in the main text that after a nonexponential transient behavior at short time @xmath87 , the fidelity @xmath46 , converges towards unity in an exponential manner , f(t>1/_p ) = f_max(1-de^-_e(t- ) ) , where @xmath88 is the population in @xmath65 after the initial transient time @xmath89 , @xmath90 is the rate of formation of the entangled state , and @xmath91 is the maximum attainable fidelity for given physical parameters@xmath92 .      in fig .",
    "1(left ) we show the variation of @xmath90 as a function of @xmath11 keeping all other parameters fixed .",
    "the results shown are obtained by numerical solution of the master equation ( eq . 5 , main text ) , and one clearly sees a predominantly linear dependence on small @xmath11 , while a deviation is seen for larger values of @xmath11 . the calculations also show that if @xmath45 is increased proportionally with @xmath11 the linear behavior holds even for large @xmath11 .    in fig .",
    "1(right ) we show the variation of @xmath90 as a function of @xmath9 , keeping the other parameters fixed .",
    "one can see that @xmath90 depends on the ratio @xmath93 , while it is independent of the absolute magnitudes of the rabi - frequencies @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "using these observations and assuming values for @xmath45 and @xmath94 in the saturation regime ( see fig .",
    "3a of main text ) , the rate of entanglement formation can be approximated by _",
    "e ~()g(,v_rr ) , where the function @xmath95 is a constant of order unity for a wide range of parameters of the model .",
    "we now analyze the asymptotic fidelity achievable with the proposed scheme . in the case of non - interacting atoms",
    ", @xmath9 determines the rate at which population accumulates in the effective two - level subspace spanned by the single - atom dark state @xmath96 and @xmath97 . if @xmath98 , the ground state component of the dark state increases but at the same time the convergence rate to the entangled steady state decreases .",
    "if , conversely , @xmath99 , the dissipative processes suppress the sensitivity to the rydberg interaction @xmath94 , mediated by @xmath10 on the @xmath100 transition , and @xmath67 is a quite stringent requirement to achieve the high fidelity singlet state . in fig 2 ( left )",
    "we present numerically calculated values of @xmath46 and @xmath91 for different values of the rabi frequencies .",
    "as shown in the inset , the singlet state fidelity is governed by @xmath101 , with the optimal choice for both the convergence rate and for the steady state fidelity given by @xmath102 .    in fig .",
    "2 ( right ) we show the dependence of @xmath91 on the raman coupling @xmath11 and the rydberg state life time @xmath103 .",
    "clearly , there exists an optimal regime in the parameter space to achieve fidelities close to unity . though a finite @xmath94 is enough to produce the state @xmath65 , a too small value of @xmath104 ( see fig .",
    "3a main text ) will slow down the entangling process .",
    "this would in turn increase the errors due the finite lifetime of the rydberg state @xmath6 , leading to a decrease in the value of @xmath91 .          for resonant couplings the hamiltonian ( eq .",
    "3 main text ) has three dark states , @xmath105 $ ] , @xmath106 $ ] , and @xmath107 $ ] , where @xmath108 are the respective normalization constants and @xmath109 $ ] and @xmath110 $ ] are the respective singlet and triplet combinations of the basis vectors @xmath111 , and hence any linear superpositions of the three states also remain dark . in the presence of dissipation",
    "neither of these remain dark , as each of them has a nonzero overlap with the decaying level , @xmath7 , and hence will gain an imaginary component , allowing any population in these states to decay in the long time limit . while states @xmath112 and @xmath113 attain an imaginary component @xmath114 to their eigenvalue the other dark state @xmath115 $ ] , where @xmath116 , gets the smallest imaginary component @xmath117 .",
    "hence @xmath118 will remain dark even in the presence of dissipation .",
    "in fact it is closest to the maximally entangled supersinglet    the bounds on the steady state fidelity and the rate of entanglement can be determined from the eigenspectrum of @xmath72 ( eq . 5 , main text ) . the maximum fidelity achievable",
    "is given by the overlap of the state @xmath65 with the eigenstate of @xmath73 which has the eigenvalue with the smallest imaginary part .",
    "as the imaginary part of the energy determines the decay rate for the corresponding eigenstate the convergence towards the state @xmath65 is determined by the gap between the two eigenvalues with lowest imaginary component . assuming perfect blockade the rate of entanglement _ e , and the maximum attainable fidelity is given by f_max 1 - 2()^2 .",

    "<S> these fidelities are mainly limited by the finite magnitude of the blockade interaction with respect to the exciting lasers and errors due to spontaneous emission from the intermediate state used in the two - photon coupling to the rydberg state @xcite . to reduce these errors one must excite very high lying rydberg states with large blockade interactions and one must apply excitation fields with a large intermediate state detuning .     and coupled via rydberg state interaction @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the atoms are described as four - level systems comprised of two ground levels @xmath4 and @xmath5 , coupled weakly to each other by a raman process , while the ground level @xmath4 is strongly coupled to the rydberg level @xmath6 by a resonant two - photon process via the intermediate short - lived excited level @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> , title=\"fig:\",width=302,height=226 ] [ setup ]    dissipation provides an attractive supplement to unitary interactions for the preparation of few - atom entangled states and can even be tailored to implement universal quantum computation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this has drawn further attention to the use of dissipation as an active ingredient in quantum information processing . in this letter , we show that decay by spontaneous emission of light can be used as a key resource to generate pairwise entangled steady states of atoms with interacting rydberg states . </S>",
    "<S> we shall show that our scheme works for even moderate interactions between the excited atoms and that the convergence to the entangled steady state is rapid enough to yield robustness against realistic noise and loss mechanisms .    </S>",
    "<S> the physical setup for our dissipative generation of entangled states involves two atoms with two ground hyperfine states , labeled @xmath5 and @xmath4 @xcite , and a rydberg state @xmath6 , which can be excited via the intermediate state @xmath7 , see fig . </S>",

    "<S> the triplet space of states @xmath22 are also dark states , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ , they do not couple to the short lived excited atomic state , but the raman coupling causes rotations among them . in the absence of interatomic interaction , any initial product state of the atoms , will on the time scale of a few @xmath23 evolve into an incoherent mixture of the dark singlet and triplet states with no entanglement .    </S>",
    "<S> since the singlet state contains only one atom in the state @xmath19 and hence only single rydberg state components , it is immune to the interaction term @xmath3 , while the triplet component @xmath24 , due to the interaction , is energetically shifted away from the ground state manifold and seizes to be an eigenstate of the interaction . </S>",
    "<S> this destroys the eit mechanism @xcite and @xmath25 now couples to the rapidly decaying states . as a consequence of this coupling , </S>",
    "<S> also the other two triplet states , which are coupled by the raman field , acquire finite lifetime and undergo excitation and decay by spontaneous emission until the atomic population accumulates in the dark singlet state ( [ darksinglet ] ) . </S>",

    "<S> we have plotted the population of the effective four level subspace @xmath29 obtained from the full master equation analysis . </S>",
    "<S> one can see that all the population resides in the four level subspace for @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> hereafter , on a longer time scale the system reaches a steady state with a high overlap with the dark singlet state @xmath65 , ( [ darksinglet ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> as long as the coupling and interaction parameters fulfil @xmath66 and @xmath67 , fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 reveals a very weak dependence of the fidelity @xmath46 on the dissipative atomic decay rate @xmath45 and the interaction strength @xmath3 ( for more information see @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> from the same figure one can see that for @xmath68 , and @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) , the formation of the entangled state is almost purely determined by the interplay of dynamics between the rabi and raman fields . </S>",
    "<S> this is surprising since spontaneous decay and rydberg interactions are both essential physical components for the formation of the entangled state . </S>",
    "<S> only when either of these strengths are small in comparison with the rabi fields , the convergence to steady state becomes slower . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the deviations from these conditions the fidelity also gets reduced by other long time effects such as decay of the rydberg state which reduces the steady state fidelity @xmath71 @xcite , and dephasing due to e.g , magnetic noise . </S>",
    "<S> the bounds on the steady state fidelity and the rate of entanglement can be determined from the eigenspectrum of @xmath72 ( 5 ) . the maximum fidelity achievable </S>",
    "<S> is given by the overlap of the state @xmath65 with the eigenstate of @xmath73 which has an eigenvalue with the smallest imaginary part @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as the imaginary part of the energy determines the decay rate for the corresponding eigenstate the convergence towards the state @xmath65 is determined by the gap between the eigenvalues with lowest imaginary component @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the steady state ( 1 ) is a maximally entangled state of two atomic qubits with states @xmath5 and @xmath19 , and as it requires only finite rydberg interaction , it may be prepared with atoms quite far apart , e.g , , within a regular neutral atom array . such an entangled state may be used to teleport qubits and thus to perform long distance gates in a neutral atom quantum computer @xcite . to accommodate local operations one may use the rydberg blockade gate mechanism , and </S>",
    "<S> since that assumes atomic qubits encoded initially in the bare atomic ground states , we may need to turn @xmath65 in ( 1 ) into a state of the pure ground state form @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> note that this can be done by adiabatically turning off the @xmath9 field , or by abruptly switching the phase of the lasers to drive the @xmath19 superposition state into the atomic state @xmath4 .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have presented a fast and robust scheme for dissipative generation of entangled steady states of a pair of atoms with interacting rydberg states . </S>",
    "<S> the scheme does not demand the interaction to be in the blockade regime , and provided an experimentally natural hierarchy between the magnitudes of the different coupling terms , it does not depend on fine tuning of any parameters . note that the role of @xmath3 is merely to perturb the state @xmath75 so that the triplet states are no longer dark states of the system . for realistic parameters used in the simulations we see that any product state evolves into the desired entangled state within few tens of microseconds . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that , under steady driving conditions , our scheme protects the desired entangled state by automatically compensating for the harmful effects of decoherence and decay .    </S>",
    "<S> the present analysis also shows that the eit dark state feature , which is lost in the presence of interaction for the case of two three level atoms @xcite , is regained by the weak coupling to an additional ground state . the effective @xmath5 and </S>",
    "<S> @xmath19 two - level description of the atoms leads to the identification of singlet and triplet - like states of two atoms , and we believe it may be a good starting point to study correlated effects under similar conditions in larger number of rydberg interacting atoms , e.g. along the lines of @xcite .    the authors thank mark saffman for helpful comments and suggestions . </S>",
