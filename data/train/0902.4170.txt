    "the quantum theory of charge transport in one - dimensional ( 1d ) systems of interacting fermions is a fundamental building block of our understanding of electron transport in nanostructures and of a future nanoelectronics .",
    "one - dimensional interacting fermion systems have been studied since the 1950s , beginning with the pioneering works of tomonaga and luttinger . the early work exploited the fact that the elementary excitations in these systems are charge and spin excitations of bosonic character , and led to the formulation of the method of bosonization .",
    "@xcite this method offers a natural description of the fractionalization of the usual fermionic quasiparticles existing in higher dimensions , into spinon and holon quasiparticles in 1d . while the bosonization method is highly successful in accounting for the properties of systems in equilibrium , it is somewhat problematic when applied to transport situations .",
    "for example , an ideal quantum wire attached to two reservoirs is expected to have a two - point conductance of @xmath2 per channel . in contradiction to this general law it was found in early work on transport in clean luttinger liquids @xcite that the conductance ( here and in the following conductance will be measured in units of the conductance quantum @xmath3 ) is given by the luttinger parameter @xmath4 , and thus depends on the interaction strength .",
    "it was later pointed out that by carefully choosing the order of limits of frequency , @xmath5 , and wire length , @xmath6 , @xcite or else by taking into account the screening of the external field by the interacting electron system @xcite  one recovers the correct value of unity for the two - point conductance .",
    "whether the former or the latter explanation is the correct one remains disputed to this day .    the more relevant case of a luttinger liquid with potential barrier has been considered first by kane and fisher @xcite and by furusaki and nagaosa , @xcite again using the bosonization method .",
    "these authors found that interaction has a dramatic effect on the conductance : for repulsive interaction the conductance is found to tend to zero as a fractional power of the temperature @xmath7 , in the limit @xmath8 .",
    "this was shown in the two limits of a weakly scattering barrier and a strong ( tunneling ) barrier .",
    "in addition , results in the complete temperature range are available at special values of the interaction parameter , @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "kane1992,kane1992a , weiss1995,fendley1995,fendley1995a all these works suffer from the drawback that in the clean limit the conductance is found to tend to @xmath4 rather than @xmath11 .",
    "it has been argued that these results may be applied to the four - point conductance .",
    "however , the four - point conductance is expected to tend to infinity in the limit of vanishing barrier strength , a behavior not shown .    for the reasons noted above we think it worthwhile to develop an alternative formulation of the transport theory of luttinger liquids , formulated entirely in the fermionic language . the fermionic representation offers the possibility to connect the fermionic degrees of freedom in the ( non - interacting ) leads smoothly with the degrees of freedom in the interacting system . in other words",
    ", it allows to use the scattering states of the system in the non - interacting limit as a basis of description . on the simplest level , in lowest order in the interaction ,",
    "this program has been carried out in a seminal paper by yue , matveev and glazman .",
    "@xcite the physics of this problem lies in the scale - dependent build - up of a polarization potential around the bare barrier , induced by the friedel oscillations of the density . for repulsive interaction , the polarization potential",
    "is found to extend farther and farther out as the temperature is lowered , until at @xmath12 it is infinitely extended , leading to a vanishing transmission probability across the barrier .",
    "the process of gradual growth of the effective potential barrier may be described in the language of renormalization group theory applied to the transmission probability as a function of the temperature . a generalization of the approach of yue et al . to the case of two barriers",
    "has been given in ref .",
    "these predictions , based on the continuum version of the theory , were thoroughly checked and confirmed by the fermionic functional renormalization group method , starting from the hubbard models on a lattice .",
    "@xcite    in this paper we report on a significant extension of the work of yue et al . to the case of systems of spinless fermions in 1d interacting via arbitrarily strong forward scattering ( parameter @xmath0 ) and subject to a short range barrier potential ( width @xmath13 ) .",
    "the principal tool we will be using is perturbation theory in the interaction , summed to infinite order . to achieve this goal , and to gain insight into the structure of perturbation theory , we map the problem first onto an effective model of interacting currents of chiral fermions .",
    "the reformulation allows to describe the effect of the barrier potential as a local magnetic field at the position of the barrier , acting on the pseudospin vector of the chiral current .",
    "the logarithmic corrections to this field , stemming from the fermionic interactions can be addressed in a simplified poor - man scaling approach ; however this approach becomes ambiguous in higher orders .",
    "therefore at a later stage we will apply the callan - szymanzik type of analysis , by first introducing the counter terms to magnetic field part of the hamiltonian to compensate the effect of the interaction , and secondly requiring the `` bare '' value of the field to be independent of the high - energy cutoff .",
    "equivalently , we may assume the scaling property of the conductance to hold , entailing the existence of a renormalization group equation for the conductance as a function of the scaling variable @xmath14 ( at finite temperature @xmath15 ) .",
    "by comparison with the structure of perturbation theory for the conductance , which is given by a power series in the interaction and in the scaling parameter @xmath14 , one may extract the rg @xmath1-function . in this way we derive a universal renormalization group equation for the conductance as a function of the scaling parameter .",
    "the most important consequence of the current algebra formulation is , however , to allow for an efficient organization of perturbation theory . after presenting the formulation of perturbation theory as well as a few low order results we analyze the structure of the perturbation expansion with respect to logarithmically divergent terms containing powers of  @xmath16  or  @xmath17 .",
    "we identify a class of universal diagrams contributing the principal terms linear in @xmath14 and derive an integral equation resumming these contributions ( `` ladder approximation '' ) .",
    "these terms are shown to dominate in both limits , small and large conductance .",
    "we identify the prefactor of the terms in the perturbation series for the conductance @xmath18 linear in @xmath14 with the renormalization group @xmath1-function of the flow equation of @xmath19 .",
    "there is , however , one important new feature : there appear scale independent terms ( from third order on ) , which lead to a correction of the conductance even at @xmath20 , the ultraviolet cutoff .",
    "these terms must be taken into account , in order to preserve the scaling property of the conductance , and lead to a starting value of the conductance @xmath21 , different from the conductance in the absence of interaction .",
    "the rg equation may be solved analytically in the ladder approximation , to give the conductance as a function of temperature for any interaction strength and barrier potential .",
    "the result completely agrees with earlier work , where a comparison is appropriate we emphasize that our result for the conductance reduces to unity in the absence of a barrier .",
    "furthermore , the effect of screening of the external field @xcite  is included by omitting all polarization diagrams .",
    "we checked the renormalizability of the theory explicitly by calculating all terms up to third order in @xmath14 and @xmath0 .    at intermediate temperatures ( semi - transparent barrier )",
    "additional diagrams contribute small corrections to the @xmath1-function .",
    "we calculate these terms in lowest ( third ) order in @xmath0 .",
    "a proper treatment of these contributions requires taking into account scale independent terms in a way sketched above .",
    "we demonstrate explicitly that the resulting @xmath1-function is uniquely determined for a given physical quantity .",
    "however , @xmath22 turns out to be a slightly different function for the two cases of interest here , the temperature dependent and the length dependent conductance .",
    "the result of the solution of the rg - equation for the conductance , using the approximate @xmath1-function thus obtained , is found to agree quantitatively with all known results on the scaling behavior of the conductance in the limits @xmath23 and @xmath24 . in the intermediate regime @xmath25 we find small discrepancies with the results of conformal field theory in the case @xmath9 , which we can trace back to a different cutoff scheme used there and the effect of higher order terms neglected in our work . as an excellent interpolation formula between two exact limits our result goes beyond all previous works : it is valid for any interaction strength @xmath4 and any potential scattering strength .",
    "the hamiltonian includes the kinetic energy of freely right- and left - moving ( r , l ) spinless fermions with linearized dispersion , @xmath26 , the interaction energy between the left- and right - moving densities , @xmath27 , and the impurity part decribing scattering off the barrier , placed at the origin , @xmath28 : @xmath29   \\notag \\\\",
