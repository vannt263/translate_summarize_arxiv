    "it is well known that when the system of interest interacts with its environment , irreversible decoherence occurs , which is , in most cases , both undesirable and unavoidable  @xcite .",
    "this interaction causes pure states to become mixed states .",
    "this process describes the influence of noise on quantum states which results in information processing errors .",
    "the question of how to reliably transmit information began with communication systems .",
    "shannon s noisy channel coding theorem is the fundamental theorem of information theory  @xcite .",
    "it states that information can be transmitted with arbitrarily good reliability over a noisy channel provided the transmission rate is less than the channel capacity , and that a code exists which achieves this .",
    "there has been recent interest in studying quantum channels for sending quantum information and defining quantum channel capacities  @xcite .    as in classical information theory ,",

    "the noise in the channel generally degrades the states .",
    "the receiver tries to recover the message which was sent from the output states .",

    ", we use a special basis of left and right damping eigenoperators for a lindblad superoperator to calculate explicitly the image of a stochastic map for a wide class of markov quantum channels .",
    "we use this method to derive a noisy quantum channel for qubits which we call the squeezed vacuum channel .",
    "this channel is non - unital with unequal damping eigenvalues , which makes it different from previously introduced channels  @xcite .",
    "we use this channel to give geometrical insight into the holevo channel capacity .",
    "we begin this paper by defining a noisy quantum channel in section ii in terms of stochastic maps and the kraus decomposition .",

    "stochastic maps in the context of quantum optics described by a set of bloch equations are discussed in section v. section vi reviews some known quantum channels and presents some more general types of channels . the stochastic map which defines the squeezed vacuum channel is explicitly calculated in section vii and the restrictions imposed by the condition of complete positivity are presented .",
    "these results are used to determine a kraus decomposition explicitly .",
    "the geometrical picture of the channel is given in section viii . finally , section ix deals with the channel s ability to send classically encoded quantum states and its ability to send the resource of entanglement .",
    "the concept of a noisy quantum channel arose from the field of quantum communication .",
    "information is encoded in quantum states and transmitted across some channel where the receiver decodes the information to retreive the original message .",
    "the ability to send messages reliably depends on the noise present in the channel .",
    "the effect of the noise is to take an initial quantum state and transform it to another quantum state .",
    "the noisy quantum channel is then defined by a map @xmath0 which takes a quantum state described by a density operator @xmath1 into a quantum state described by a density operator @xmath2 .",
    "there are certain restrictions on the class of maps which generate legitimate density operators .",

    "in addition , the image of the map , @xmath2 , must be a positive operator .",
    "a map which takes positive operators into positive operators is called a positive map .",
    "but if one considers the noise to come from a larger hilbert space of a reservoir , then the stronger condition of complete positivity is required for the process to be physical  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we restrict our attention to completely positive , trace - preserving maps which are called stochastic maps .      noise in the channel",
    "may be considered as a reservoir to which the quantum state of interest is coupled .",
    "the state and the reservoir interact unitarily for some time and they become correlated .",
    "if we are now only interested in the system , we trace over the environment degrees of freedom .",
    "one may think of the reservoir as extracting information from the system as it will typically map pure states into mixed states .",
    "this noise process can be described by a quantum operation involving only operators on the system of interest .",
    "this is called a kraus decomposition and has the form @xmath4 where the condition @xmath5 ensures that unit trace is preserved for all time  @xcite . if an operation has a kraus decomposition , then it is completely positive .",
    "the converse is also true so that all stochastic maps have a kraus decomposition .",
    "the formalism we have outlined so far is general . for a important type of noise , markov noise",
    ", we have a special class of completely positive maps .",
    "we call a markov quantum channel one in which the noise in the channel arises from a coupling of the system with a reservoir under the markov and born approximations .",
    "this is a commonly used approximation in quantum optics and leads to the well - known lindbladian form of a master equation . for this type of channel , one can always write a stochastic map as @xmath6 the equation describes the evolution of a system coupled to a reservoir in terms of the system of interest alone .",

    "this lindblad equation is widely used in many branches of statistical mechanics and quantum optics .",
    "this form , the lindblad form , has been shown to guarantee positivity and trace - preservation of the density operator  @xcite .",
    "there are many methods for solving master equations , the use of fokker - planck equations built on methods in stochastic processes , and monte - carlo wave functions , to name a couple  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will make use of the damping basis in order to solve a master equation which has the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : master ] ) containing both the coherent and damping dynamics .",
    "this amounts to solving an eigenvalue equation . in some cases",
    ", this problem can seem formidable and finding a damping basis first is useful . to solve",
    "the master equation in this fashion involves first solving the eigenvalue equation @xmath23 for the non - unitary part of the density operator evolution describing an open system .",
    "this provides one with a complete , orthogonal basis with which to expand the density operator at any time .",
    "such a basis is called the damping basis  @xcite .",
    "this basis is obtained by finding the eigenoperators of the eigenvalue equation .",
    "likewise , the dual eigenoperators are found by solving the dual eigenvalue equation .",
    "the original basis and the dual basis are orthogonal . if the eigenoperators of eq .",
    "( [ eq : eigenvalue ] ) are @xmath24 with corresponding eigenvalues @xmath25 then once the initial state is known @xmath26 the state of the system at any later time can be found through @xmath27 where @xmath28 are the damping eigenvalues and @xmath29 is the state dual to @xmath30 .",
    "these are called the left and right eigenoperators , respectively , and satisfy the following duality relation : @xmath31 it is easy to show that l and r have the same eigenvalues .",

    "one obtains a set of coupled differential equations for the coefficients of the density operator in the damping basis .",
    "solution of this set of coupled differential equations yields the solution to the total liouville dynamics .",
    "the important point is that once all eigenvalues and all left and right eigenoperators of the superoperator are found , the master equation can be solved and all system observables can be computed .",
    "when studying two - level systems there is the added advantage of a geometrical picture offered by the vector model of the density matrix .",
    "for instance , decoherence of a two - level atom is described by the dynamics of a bloch vector with three components , @xmath36 , inside a unit three - sphere , governed by a set of bloch equations  @xcite .",
    "these constitute a set of differential equations , one for each component of the bloch vector , of the form : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the rabi frequency , the constants @xmath39 and @xmath40 are decay rates of the atomic dipole , and @xmath41 is the decay rate of the atomic inversion into an equilibrium state @xmath42 .",
    "one typically finds that the phenomenological decay rates in the bloch equations appear as @xmath43 so that the parts of the atomic dipole which are in phase and out of phase with the driving field are affected in the same way by the damping .",
    "this description is in terms of a two - level atom coupled to an external field as well as a reservoir .",
    "the coupling to the external field causes the bloch vector to rotate .",
    "the coupling to the reservoir , which might be a continuum of vacuum field modes , causes the bloch vector to decrease in magnitude .",
    "the combination of these two behaviors leads to a spiraling in of the bloch vector .",
    "although we describe these dynamics in terms of the two - level atom , the bloch picture can describe any two - level system . here",
    "we shall consider the more general form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : bloch ] ) where all three damping constants may be unequal .",
    "as we shall see , this describes the physical situation where the two - level atom is coupled to a squeezed vacuum reservoir rather than a regular vacuum field .",
    "the damping parameters lead to decoherence of the system of interest .",
    "the decoherence is caused by the presence of noise and may be viewed as a stochastic map acting on the bloch vector in the form of a mapping  @xcite : @xmath44 because there is a correspondence between the bloch vector @xmath45 and the density operator @xmath1 , we see that the stochastic map is a superoperator which maps density operators into density operators : @xmath46 we can expand the density operator in the pauli basis , @xmath47 , and consider how the components of @xmath1 transform under the map . this latter transformation is characterized by a 4x4 matrix representation of @xmath7 . it has been found that the general form of any stochastic map on the set of complex 2x2 matrices , may be represented by such a 4x4 matrix containing 12 parameters  @xcite : @xmath48 the 3x3 block of the matrix @xmath49 can be diagonalized using two rotations .",
    "this amounts to a change of basis . without loss of generality",
    ", we can consider the matrix @xmath50 which uniquely determines the map . to preserve hermiticity",
    ", @xmath49 must be real .",
    "the first row must be @xmath51 to preserve the trace of the density operator .",
    "we call the 3x3 part of the matrix @xmath52 , consisting of the damping eigenvalues @xmath53 which are contractions , the damping matrix @xmath54 .",
    "explicitly , @xmath55 in terms of the bloch vector , a general stochastic map may be written in the form @xmath56 where @xmath57 is a translation .",
    "the overall operation consists of a damping part and translations . due to the presence of translations ,",
    "the transformation is affine .    to see the properties required by the stochastic map in terms of the bloch vector",
    "consider the matrix representation of the bloch vector as an expansion in terms of the pauli matrices : @xmath58 in the absence of noise , the bloch vector remains on the bloch sphere so that @xmath59 has magnitude unity .",
    "the presence of stochastic noise transforms the matrix @xmath60 according to @xmath61 to guarantee that the map @xmath7 transforms the density operator into another density operator , the bloch vector can only be transformed into a vector contained in the interior of the bloch sphere , or the bloch ball .",
    "equivalently , we require @xmath62 so that the qubit density operator @xmath63 under the map becomes @xmath64 this is only possible if the eigenvalues @xmath53 are contractions . in the following sections we provide an explicit construction of the stochastic map @xmath7 from the bloch eqs .",

    "( [ eq : master ] ) which retains a relation to the bloch eqs .",
    "( [ eq : bloch ] ) and leads to the case where the three components of the bloch vector have different decay rates and where the bloch vector is shifted from the origin of the bloch sphere .",

    "( [ eq : lindblad ] ) describes many well - known physical processes in quantum optics .",
    "we wish to now briefly discuss the physics behind this lindblad form of the master equation .",
    "the amplitude damping channel is identical to the case of spontaneous emission for a two - level atom .",
    "this corresponds to the following choice for the parameters : @xmath79 the parameter a is the einstein coefficient of spontanteous emission that depends on the density of vacuum field modes and how strongly the atom couples to the modes .",
    "this describes the exponential decay of an atom , from excited to ground state , due to vacuum fluctuations .",
    "the equilibrium state is @xmath80 indicating that , given enough time , the atom will be in the ground state .",
    "another type of noisy quantum channel is the depolarizing channel .",
    "this channel is identical to the quantum optical model for pure phase decay .",
    "this channel has parameters @xmath81 this describes the process of phase randomization of the atomic dipole caused by atomic collisions .",
    "this leads to equal damping for the @xmath77 and @xmath78 components of the bloch vector with contractions which depend on the parameter , @xmath82 , due to collisions .      in the case of spontaneous emission ,",
    "the atom is coupled to a vacuum reservoir .",
    "but one can consider an atom interacting with a thermal field , so that now the field has a non - zero photon number .",
    "the reservoir may be considered as a large number of harmonic oscillators such as modes of the free electromagnetic field or a heat bath in equilibrium . in this case , one finds the decay constants are related to the photon number in the following way : @xmath83 note that setting @xmath84 reduces to the case of spontaneous emission . in this thermal field case , the value of @xmath42 indicates that the atomic inversion approaches a steady state which is the ground state in the limit of zero photon number but as n becomes large , it approaches zero .",
    "therefore , the equilibrium state for the inversion is bounded : @xmath85 one can see from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : damping ] ) that this leads to equal damping for the @xmath77 and @xmath78 components of the bloch vector .",
    "a more general case occurs when all parameters are non - zero and explicitly are : @xmath86 this describes an atom in a squeezed vacuum where n is the photon number and m is the squeezing parameter .",
    "the parameter n is related to the two - time correlation function for the noise operators of the reservoir @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the field amplitude for a reservoir mode .",
    "the squeezing parameter , m , arises from the two - time correlation function involving the square of the field amplitudes @xmath89 .",
    "these are the familiar relations obeyed by squeezed white noise which leads to squeezing of a vacuum reservoir  @xcite .",
    "a squeezed vacuum has fluctuations in one quadrature smaller than allowed by the uncertainty principle at the expense of larger fluctuations in the other quadrature .",
    "this type of reservoir leads to two dipole decay constants in the bloch equations , the one in the squeezed quadrature being correspondingly smaller than that for the stretched quadrature .",
    "the steady state for the inversion is the same here as in the previous case and depends only on the photon number .",
    "when the field is not squeezed ( @xmath90 ) , the master equation reduces to the previous case of an atom in a thermal field .",
    "the important difference now is that the squeezing parameter has introduced a new parameter , @xmath91 which leads to unequal damping for the @xmath77 and @xmath78 components of the bloch vector . in what follows",
    ", we deal with the most general case , corresponding to the lindbladian ( [ eq : lindblad ] ) , of a qubit coupled to a squeezed vacuum reservoir .",
    "this defines a new noisy quantum channel which we call the squeezed vacuum channel ( svc ) having different properties than the depolarizing and amplitude damping channels .",

    "we will consider the case where the system is not isolated from its environment but unaffected by coherent dynamics . in this case",
    ", rotations occur on a time scale much longer than the dissipation so that effectively @xmath114 we will see that this case is advantageous .    with these explicit formulas for the damping basis and the damping eigenvalues we can calculate the density operator for all times .",

    "the channel capacity of a noisy quantum channel is characterized by the types of errors which result after the input is transmitted .",

    "what is not as obvious is that not all states inside the bloch sphere are allowable for the system . in other words",
    ", the bloch vector can not access all points in the interior of the bloch sphere .",
    "this is because of the condition of complete positivity , related to the existence of a kraus representation which we discuss in the following section .",
    "it has been shown  @xcite that the damping eigenvalues must obey the four inequalities @xmath121 to guarantee complete positivity of the map .",

    "it is worth pointing out that while contractions , without shifts , will always map the bloch sphere into the bloch ball , not all contractions satisfy the inequalities ( [ eq : inequalities ] ) .",

    "the minimum number of kraus operators , for the map constructed here , is four , but one could just as well use more than four to produce the map .",
    "this freedom in the kraus decomposition is related to the many possible ways of performing measurements on the system .",
    "the system is decohered as a result of being measured by the environment .",
    "the many different kraus operators correspond to the many different positive operator - valued measures ( povms ) which lead to the decohered state .",

    "i.e. _ , it does not map identity into identity , we have @xmath135 this is due to the presence of the affine shift .",

    "the pure states have become mixed states . by eq .",
    "( [ eq : lambdas ] ) , each axis is unequally contracted , as shown in figure 1 .",
    "because of the squeezed vacuum , the @xmath78-component experiences very little damping while the @xmath77-component is rapidly damped , as shown in figure 2 .",
    "the explicit expression for the shift in terms of @xmath42 indicates the ellipsoid is translated in the negative @xmath144-direction over time and settles into an equilibrium or fixed point , as shown in figure 3 .    the matrix of eq .",
    "( [ eq : tdmatrix ] ) is in the pauli basis and describes the dissipative dynamics from the stationary viewpoint at the center of the bloch sphere . from this viewpoint",
    ", one would observe a contracting ellipsoid moving away from the bloch sphere center to some equilibrium point .",
    "the matrix could also be represented in the damping basis , in which case it would be diagonal .",
    "this amounts to transforming to a frame where , instead of being a stationary observer at the bloch sphere center , one is moving along with the shifting ellipsoid . in this case , one observes only a contracting ellipsoid .",
    "this is the geometrical picture of the damping basis .",
    "if the effect of noise on all input states is known , then the least noisy output states can be identified .",
    "the minimal entropy states are the states least affected by the noise and consequently the least - mixed states .",
    "geometrically , these would be all states whose distance to the surface of the bloch vector is a minimum .",
    "these states form a set of extreme points of the convex set of density operators .",
    "such a set of points on the ellipsoid having minimal distance to the bloch sphere may consist of one or two points , a circle , or the entire surface of the ellipsoid . for a given noise ,",
    "these nearest points represent states of maximum purity in the set of states affected by the noise . for the squeezed vacuum channel ,",
    "the set of minimal entropy states consists of two states along the major axis of the ellipsoid .",
    "the purest minimal entropy states are obtained by maximal squeezing of the reservoir .",
    "this results in the most eccentric ellipsoid which is stretched in one particular direction and places the two points along the major axis of the ellipsoid close to the bloch sphere surface , as seen in figure 1 .",
    "as the squeezing parameter @xmath145 goes to zero , the ellipsoid becomes less elongated and the minimal entropy states lose their purity . when m is identically zero , the minimal entropy points lie in a circle .",
    "equivalently , as m approaches zero , the damping for the @xmath77 component of the bloch vector approaches that for the @xmath78 component .    if we had included the coherent dynamics as well as the dissipative dynamics , the minimal entropy points on the ellipsoid would be more mixed than without the coherent dynamics .",
    "the reason for this is that the ellipsoid would begin to rotate and the minimal entropy points along the @xmath78-component would rotate away from this axis where there is more noise .",
    "consequently , the minimal entropy points get degraded by being moved away from the axis with least noise so that for this channel , it is advantageous to keep coherent dynamics suppressed .",
    "other noisy quantum channels have been introduced such as the depolarizing channel , amplitude - damping channel , and the phase - damping channel  @xcite .",
    "the depolarizing channel has all three components of the bloch sphere equally damped and it is a unital channel .",
    "the set of minimal entropy points would lie on a sphere .",
    "the amplitude - damping channel has two of the three components equally damped and it is a non - unital channel .",
    "it arises from the master equation describing spontaneous emission as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sponemission ] ) .",
    "the set of all states moves on an ellipsoid which shifts toward the south pole .",
    "the phase - damping channel is the case described in eq .",
    "( [ eq : phasedecay ] ) .",
    "it has two equally damped components , one undamped component , and it is unital .",
    "it has two extreme points , one at the north pole and one at the south pole .",
    "given any type of noise , the geometrical picture is a useful aid and allows for a simple analysis of the channel capacity . to transmit information over the channel",
    "it is ideal to use as input states those states which result in the minimum amount of measurement error .",
    "one way to use a quantum channel is to send classical information encoded in quantum states .",
    "although quantum information is being sent because qubits are sent through the channel , these qubits are being used in an entirely classical way . a natural extension of classical channel capacity for a quantum channel",
    "has been proposed by holevo  @xcite . in this case ,",
    "quantum states are used to transmit messages reliably across some noisy quantum channel .",
    "also known as the product state capacity , because messages are sent using tensor products of the input states which comprise the alphabet , the channel capacity for classical information over a noisy quantum channel has been defined as @xmath146 - \\sum_i      \\textrm{p}_i \\textrm{s}[\\phi(\\rho_i ) ] \\rbrace .",
    "\\label{eq : holevo}\\ ] ] s is the von neumann entropy defined as @xmath147 and is the quantum analogue of the shannon entropy . the maximum is taken over all possible ensembles of input states .",
    "the input alphabet consists of a set of states @xmath148 which are transmitted with probability @xmath149 . for the case of the svc",
    ", the maximization is achieved using the two orthogonal input states for which the damping is smallest with a uniform distribution over these states . with the convention already chosen ,",
    "this is the v - component of the bloch sphere .",
    "thus , the optimal way to send classical information through the svc is to prepare product states using the two orthogonal input states @xmath150 and @xmath151,which lie in the equatorial plane of the bloch sphere , with corresponding probabilities @xmath152 and @xmath153 to encode messages .",
    "for example , @xmath154 , requiring n uses of the channel , would represent the n - length classical bit string 01@xmath1551 .",
    "the noise operation @xmath7 causes the output of these two states to be non - orthogonal , mixed states .",
    "no single measurement at the receiving end can perfectly determine which input state was sent .",
    "there are two errors which can occur , one error arises because of the non - distinguishability of non - orthogonal states while the other arises because the state is mixed . the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : holevo ] ) takes into account the information loss due to the fact the the output states are non - orthogonal while the second term takes into account the fact the the output states are mixed .",
    "the holevo capacity has a nice geometrical interpretation . to see this we consider an example . for simplicity ,",
    "let us assume that the svc has maximum squeezing and the input states are received after a one second pass through the channel . then , using the same parameters as in figures 2 - 4 , namely , n=1,m=@xmath156 , and t=1 , we find explicitly that the holevo capacity is c(svc)=.93-.11=.82 qubits per transmission .",
    "this is calculated by using @xmath150 and @xmath151 as input states with corresponding probabilities @xmath152 and @xmath153 and calculating the quantity inside the brackets of eq .",
    "( [ eq : holevo ] ) .",
    "note that the first term is present because of the affine shift while the second term is due to a contraction of the bloch sphere . to see the various errors which can occur we can write c(svc)=1-(1-.93)-.11=.82 qubits per transmission . now",
    "the first term is the number of qubits which can be sent if there was no noise present .",
    "the second term is the error caused by the affine shift .",
    "this is a distance from the center of the bloch sphere to the center of the ellipsoid .",
    "this error occurs because the states lose their orthogonality .",
    "the last term is the error due to the contraction of the ellipsoid .",
    "the contractions cause the states to become mixed and consequently there will be measurement errors of this kind .",
    "this term is a distance from the bloch sphere surface to the surface of the ellipsoid .",
    "it is interesting to note that the affine shift actually takes the maximally mixed state into a state with less entropy .",
    "this can occur because generalized measurements can decrease entropy .",
    "also , if no noise were present the capacity would be c(i)=1 qubit per transmission meaning that one error - free qubit can be transmitted in one use of the channel .",
    "another way in which a quantum channel can be used which does not have a classical counterpart is for entanglement transmission . in this case , one is interested in distributing parts of an entangled state to different locations .",
    "for example , a source may generate epr pairs and one may be interested in sending one half of this epr pair through some channel to a receiver . naturally , noise will corrupt the transmitted state and lead to a decrease in the entanglement of the joint state .",
    "a channel has the capacity to transmit entanglement if after passing through the channel there is any nonzero entanglement present in the joint state .",
    "it has been shown by horodecki _ et .",
    "al _ that any nonseparable bipartite system which has entanglement , however small , can be distilled to a singlet form  @xcite . therefore , if a channel can transmit any entanglement , it is a useful channel .",
    "n copies can be sent and a singlet state can be distilled .    assuming the initial bell state has the following density operator representation @xmath157 the output state will be determined by the following operation @xmath158\\ ] ] which describes the process of sending one qubit to bob while alice keeps her qubit intact . in matrix notation ,",
    "the output state for the joint system is    @xmath159    at the initial time the joint state is maximally entangled and the noise process should result in a decrease in the entanglement until some critical time when the joint state is separable and remains separable thereafter . using the peres criterion of the positivity of the partial transpose , one can determine when the state becomes separable  @xcite . a necessary and sufficient condition for the output state to be nonseparable",
    "is that the partial transpose map be negative  @xcite . to check the positivity of the partial transpose it suffices to examine the eigenvalues of the operator given by @xmath160\\ ] ] where @xmath161 denotes the transpose of the state of bob s qubit .",

    "the value of this critical time depends on the parameters of the reservoir .",
    "as the photon number of the reservoir increases the critical time decreases .",
    "one would expect this to be the case since the reservoir is more noisy .",
    "it is not as obvious what the effect of the squeezing of the reservoir has on the entanglement because the squeezing results in a tradeoff of more noise in one component and a decrease in another component .",
