    "spin polarization by currents and its inverse effect are currently a subject of intensive theoretical and experimental investigation both in semiconducting and metallic systems .",

    "may be referred to under different names .",
    "the generation of a current from a non - equilibrium spin polarization goes under the equivalent names of spin galvanic effect ( sge ) or inverse edelstein effect ( iee ) , while the reciprocal phenomenon of current - induced spin polarizations is referred to as inverse spin galvanic effect ( isge ) or edelstein effect ( ee ) .    the first experimental observation of the sge / iee was in quantum wells , by measuring the current produced by the absorption of polarized light @xcite .",
    "more recently it has been shown that a non - equilibrium spin polarization injected by spin - pumping into an ag@xmath0bi @xcite or fe@xmath0gaas @xcite interface also yields an electrical current .",

    "the sge / iee has also been observed at ferromagnet - topological insulator interfaces @xcite and in lao@xmath0sto systems @xcite . in semiconducting structures",
    "the reciprocal isge / ee is measured via optical detection of the current - induced spin polarization @xcite .",
    "the isge / ee is also measured by analyzing the torques exercised , via exchange coupling , by the non - equilibrium polarization on the magnetization of an adjacent ferromagnetic system@xcite .",
    "recently this has been extended also to antiferromagnets@xcite .",
    "although the key mechanism of the effect relies on the symmetry properties of gyrotropic media , most of the recent theoretical work has concentrated on models based on the rashba and dresselhaus spin - orbit coupling ( respectively rsoc and dsoc in the following ) in the presence of disorder scattering responsible for spin relaxation@xcite . in a 2-dimensional electron gas , as for instance the one studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) is also due to the electric field of the scattering impurities and the interplay between intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms becomes highly non trivial@xcite . in this paper",
    "we analyze some aspects of this interplay focusing on the description of the of isge / ee and sge / iee in a 2-dimensional electron gas  we will however also discuss results valid in 3d gases .",
