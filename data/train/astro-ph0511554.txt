    "it is worth noting that given that @xmath6band traces the evolved stellar populations ( rather than @xmath69band which may be obtain reflection nebulae and young or star - forming galaxies ) our results indicate that being these evolved populations aligned with the radio structure , indicates that the radio orientation is linked to the large scale structure traced by galaxies with substantial evolution in these structures .",
    "we can interpret this effect with a dynamical model for the formation of massive galaxies .",
    "@xcite proposed a dynamical origin for the alignment effect . in this picture ,",
    "powerful high redshift radio galaxies are assumed to represent an early stage in the formation of massive galaxies in the centers of rich clusters .",
    "galaxy formation proceeds anisotropically by hierarchical merging of smaller protogalactic units along preferred directions , which are related to large  scale filamentary features in the surrounding mass distribution . as a consequence of this anisotropic formation process , these galaxies are quite prolate in shape",
    ". infalling gas will quickly settle into an accretion disc whose angular momentum vector is aligned with the major axis of the galaxy mass distribution .",
    "if the radio jet emerges in the direction of this angular momentum vector , a natural consequence of such formation model is that one would expect companion galaxies to be preferentially located along the radio axis .",
    "the model proposed here does not preclude the possibility that some fraction of the aligned light may have its origin in jet - induced star formation . in this case , this phenomena is only a second order effect which may act to enhance further the alignments with the radio axis .",
    "in this section we have analyzed the uss galaxy morphology using an automated classification system based on central concentration of light .",
    "we used the concentration index ( @xmath70 ) , which is the fraction of an object s light contained in the central 30% of its area as measured in an ellipse aligned with the object and having the same axial ratio ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the interpretation of the observed central light concentration indices has been assessed using galaxy model simulations , which is discussed in the next subsection .",
