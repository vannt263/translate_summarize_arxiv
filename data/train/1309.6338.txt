    "we have detected weak [ cii ] and [ nii ] emission ( figure  [ fig - pacs ] ) . the peak [ cii ] flux in an 18@xmath14 diameter aperture is @xmath25 w m@xmath26 and the total flux summed in a 36@xmath14 diameter aperture is @xmath27 w m@xmath26 . for [ nii ] , the peak flux is @xmath28 w m@xmath26 and the total flux is @xmath29 w m@xmath26 .",

    "one unusual aspect of the dust emission in ngc 4125 is that the emission is spatially extended and follows the general shape of the stellar emission ( figure  [ fig - kcomp ] ) .",
    "while previous optical extinction maps have shown a central dust lane aligned with the major axis @xcite , the _ herschel _ images trace dust over a significantly larger area and the dust emission even follows the @xmath4 profile that is a common feature of ellipticals .",
    "fitting the global dust emission from 160 to 500 @xmath8 m with a modified blackbody with dust opacity going as @xmath31 gives an average dust temperature of @xmath32 k ( figure  [ figbb ] ) .",
    "the dust mass can be calculated as @xmath33 m@xmath1 , where @xmath34 is the distance to the galaxy in mpc , @xmath35 is the dust temperature in k , @xmath36 is the 250 @xmath8 m flux in jy , and @xmath37 is the dust emissivity at 250 @xmath8 m in @xmath38 g@xmath18 . as our default , we assume a standard graphite plus silicate dust emissivity @xmath39 @xmath40 g@xmath18 @xcite , which corresponds to @xmath41 and has also been used for previous analyses of elliptical galaxies @xcite .",
    "we obtain a global dust mass for ngc 4125 of @xmath42 m@xmath1 ( table  [ tbl - prop ] ) and a mass in the peak resolution element of @xmath43 m@xmath1 . using the same distance and emissivity ,",
    "our dust mass is a factor of 4 larger than that of @xcite , who obtained a warmer dust temperature due to a lack of fluxes longward of 160 @xmath8 m .",
    "the dust mass is rather sensitive to our assumptions about the grain properties .",
    "if we instead adopt the mixture of amorphous carbon and silicates explored for the large magellanic cloud by @xcite , for which @xmath44 and @xmath45 @xmath40 g@xmath18 , we obtain a dust temperature of @xmath46 k and a total dust mass of @xmath47 m@xmath1 . performing the fit with @xmath48 allowed to vary between 1 and 2.5 returns",
    "a fit with @xmath49 and a temperature of @xmath50 k. combining this temperature with @xmath51 @xmath40 g@xmath18 gives similar dust masses to the amorphous carbon model of @xcite .",
    "we also note , however , that single temperature fits to spiral galaxies usually yield smaller dust masses than more realistic multiple temperature models @xcite . fitting the data with two components with @xmath52 ( figure  [ figbb ] )",
    "gives temperatures of 17 and 51 k and a cold dust mass of @xmath53 m@xmath1 .",
    "although the 500 @xmath8 m flux lies somewhat above the fits , the excess emission is likely due to two faint ( @xmath54 mjy ) point - like sources to the west of ngc 4125 ( figure  [ fig - kcomp ] ) .",
    "these sources contribute 20% of the total flux at 500 @xmath8 m but only 10% at 250 @xmath8 m and may be background galaxies .",
    "we estimate a stellar mass of @xmath55 m@xmath1 from the 3.6 @xmath8 m flux in @xcite and the median mass - to - light ratio of 1.00 @xmath56 @xmath57 from @xcite .",
    "the dust to stellar mass ratio of @xmath58 is towards the high end of the values seen for nearby elliptical galaxies @xcite .",
    "comparing the global dust mass with the sum of the hi and h@xmath15 upper limits @xcite and including a factor of 1.36 to account for helium @xcite gives a global gas - to - dust ratio of @xmath59 . because the areas covered by the three different measurements ( hi , co , dust ) are very different , another relevant comparison is between the peak dust mass ( 18@xmath14 beam ) and the co upper limit ( 21@xmath14 beam ) . comparing these two values gives a limit on the gas - to - dust mass ratio of @xmath60 .",
    "these @xmath61 upper limits are factors of 7 - 12 smaller than the typical gas - to - dust mass ratio of 150 seen in our own and other galaxies .",
    "thus , there appears to be a deficit of neutral gas to go along with the cold dust in ngc 4125 .",
    "we can also estimate the gas mass associated with the observed [ cii ] emission .",
    "we assume that the [ cii ] emission comes from the ionized gas phase ( @xmath62 k ) via collisional excitation with electrons .",
    "we note that the [ nii]/[cii ] ratio is consistent with a low - density ionized medium @xcite . assuming the electron density , @xmath63 , is much less than the critical density @xmath64 @xmath65 @xcite , the column density is given by @xmath66 with @xmath67 in units of erg s@xmath18 @xmath17 sr@xmath18 .",
    "assuming a c@xmath68 abundance relative to hydrogen of @xmath69 , the mass corresponding to the total flux in the map is @xmath70 m@xmath1 .",
    "solving for the case where the ionized medium uniformly fills the 18@xmath14 ( 2.1 kpc ) radius volume gives a lower limit to @xmath63 of 0.11 @xmath65 and an ionized hydrogen mass of @xmath71 m@xmath1 .",
    "combining this mass estimate with our dust mass and again accounting for helium with a factor of 1.36 gives a total ( ionized plus neutral ) gas - to - dust mass ratio of @xmath72 for @xmath52 or @xmath73 for @xmath44 .",
    "this analysis suggests that a significant fraction of the gas in ngc 4125 is warm ionized gas that produces [ cii ] emission rather than cold neutral gas .",
    "the dusty ism of ngc 4125 has some unusual properties .",
    "the dust has a similar radial profile to the stellar light out to at least 7 kpc ( 1@xmath12 ) radius ( figure  [ fig - kcomp ] ) .",
    "its total dust mass is among the highest seen in elliptical galaxies @xcite and is only a factor of 3 times smaller than the dust mass in the elliptical galaxy centaurus a @xcite .",
    "however , unlike cen a , where the neutral gas - to - dust mass ratio is 100 and the gas traces a clearly rotating disk @xcite , in ngc 4125 the corresponding gas is not neutral but in a warmer ionized or even x - ray emitting phase .",
    "these unusual properties suggest an internal origin for the ism of ngc 4125 .",
    "the ratio @xmath74 is towards the high end of the range seen in ellipticals , as is the total stellar mass @xmath75 @xcite .",
    "the optical colors of ngc 4125 suggest that it underwent a burst of star formation 6 - 8 gyr ago @xcite .",
    "long - slit spectroscopy combined with simple stellar population models indicate super - solar metallicity and also point to a recent dissipational merger event and stellar ages as young as 8 gyr @xcite .",
    "many of these younger stars would now be in the red giant , carbon star , or asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) phase when stars shed large quantities of gas and dust .",
    "the material that is lost from these stars has a normal gas - to - dust mass ratio .",
    "however , if the dust from the star survives for a longer time ( i.e. 50 myr , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) than the gas survives in the neutral phase , the observed _ neutral _ gas to dust mass ratio could be reduced , because the majority of the gas would be in an ionized or x - ray emitting phase . assuming a dust lifetime of 50 myr , the stars in ngc 4125 would need to produce dust at a rate of @xmath76 m@xmath1 yr@xmath18 to explain the observed dust mass .",
    "this rate is much higher than the typical rate seen in passive elliptical galaxies @xcite .",
    "@xcite derived total ( gas plus dust ) mass loss rates from a few @xmath77 to a few @xmath78 m@xmath1 yr@xmath18 for a collection of agb stars and proto - planetary and planetary nebulae in our own galaxy , with a median mass loss rate of @xmath79 m@xmath1 yr@xmath18 .",
    "@xcite find that extreme agb stars are responsible for @xmath80 of the dust produced by evolved stars in the smc . assuming a normal gas - to - dust mass ratio of 150 , ngc 4125 would need to contain roughly @xmath81 such stars ( 0.001% of its total stellar mass ) to produce the required dust .",
    "given the total mass of ngc 4125 , such a population of stars seems quite reasonable .",
    "in contrast , if the dust in ngc 4125 was acquired via an interaction with another galaxy , the lack of neutral gas suggests that the interaction must have been extremely recent .",
    "we would need to be viewing ngc 4125 at the precise time when most of the gas has been ionized but significant cold dust remains .",
    "it is hard to understand how such a large mass of dust could survive for much more than 50 myr without the high column densities which would shield both the dust and the neutral gas .",
    "one question which arises is why we have not discovered more galaxies like ngc 4125 .",
    "first , such galaxies may be intrinsically rare in the local universe .",
    "the herschel reference survey @xcite contains all elliptical galaxies in a portion of the northern sky with @xmath82 mag and @xmath83 mpc ; ngc 4125 meets the distance and luminosity criteria but falls just outside the upper declination limit of the survey . adding ngc 4125 to the 18 elliptical galaxies from @xcite",
    ", we can estimate that the rate for ngc 4125-like galaxies may be @xmath84% .",
    "however , not all the galaxies in the herschel reference survey have atomic and molecular gas measurements and so some could be similar to ngc 4125 .",
    "second , ngc 4125 is a luminous galaxy , which makes it easier to detect a given mass fraction of dust . for internal processes , a higher stellar mass would correlate with a higher dust mass .",
    "the presence of a younger stellar population than in passively evolving ellipticals could also serve to increase the dust to stellar mass ratio .",
    "given the sensitivities of typical _ herschel _ maps , a similar galaxy which was 1/3 as massive would appear as a point source at 250 @xmath8 m at the same distance as ngc 4125 , while a galaxy 1/10 as massive could not be distinguished easily from the _ herschel _ confusion limit .",
    "finally , it is hard to know how critical the exact age and mass fraction of the younger stellar population might be in producing this particular configuration of dust without neutral gas . with stellar lifetimes of 1.4 gyr for a 2 m@xmath1 star and 5.5 gyr for a 1.25 m@xmath1 star @xcite , the exact age of the young population may not be a critical factor , as long as a young enough population forms a sufficient fraction of the stellar mass .",
    "understanding the frequency and origin of galaxies like ngc 4125 may have important implications for understanding red galaxies at larger redshifts .",
    "a galaxy like ngc 4125 would be rather difficult to interpret if it was observed at much larger distances .",
    "its relatively strong submillimeter emission could be interpreted as indicating the presence of a significant cold ism @xcite , while its rest - frame 70 @xmath8 m emission could be taken as an indicator of on - going star formation .",
    "for example , using the star formation rate calibration of @xcite , the 70 @xmath8 m flux in the central 18@xmath14 could be interpreted as a star formation rate of 0.15 m@xmath1 yr @xmath18 . for a typical gas depletion time of 2 gyr @xcite",
    ", such a star formation rate would imply an h@xmath15 mass of @xmath85 m@xmath1 , a mass which is clearly ruled out by the existing co upper limits .",
    "at some point in the past , the progenitors of elliptical galaxies must have contained a significant ism in order to form their current population of stars .",
    "if the ism in ngc 4125 has an internal origin linked to the age of its most recent star formation episode , then we might expect galaxies like ngc 4125 to be more common at larger redshifts , when the overall stellar population of elliptical galaxies was , of necessity , younger .",
    "recently , observations of moderate redshift galaxies have identified optically red galaxies which contain significant infrared emission . @xcite and",
    "@xcite have studied large samples of early - type ( elliptical and lenticular ) galaxies from the h - atlas @xcite survey .",
    "while these galaxies typically have larger dust masses and lower stellar masses than ngc 4125 , it would be interesting to follow up on the handful of massive galaxies with red @xmath86 colors . @xcite have identified a sample of dust - obscured galaxies with high spitzer mid - infrared to optical flux ratios .",
    "the @xmath87 colors of some of these galaxies show they are clearly forming stars @xcite , but many are not detected in @xmath88 and so could instead be passive , post - star formation galaxies . _",
    "herschel _ surveys have also identified a number of 250 @xmath8 m sources with red optical colors @xcite . while @xcite conclude that most of these are highly obscured galaxies , some of them have @xmath86 colors that are similar to ngc 4125 .",
    "if galaxies like ngc 4125 , where the far - infrared emission is not related to star formation and neutral gas in the usual manner , become more common at higher redshift , this would have significant implications for our understanding of high redshift galaxies and galaxy evolution .",
