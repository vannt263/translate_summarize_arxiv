    "x - ray observations are providing answers to many long - standing questions about the dynamics and physical conditions of radio galaxies .",
    "studies of radio - galaxy environments have revealed the influence of the hot - gas medium on radio - lobe structure and have shown that radio - source heating may be common ( kraft et al . 2003 ; croston et al . 2003 ) .",
    "detections of x - ray synchrotron and inverse - compton ( ic ) jets have constrained the electron population in the jets ( e.g. harris & krawczynski 2002 ) and provided information about the locations of particle acceleration in low - power ( fr - i ) jets ( e.g. hardcastle et al .",
    "measurements of ic emission from lobes and hotspots are providing information about the magnetic field strength and the relative contribution of particles and field to source dynamics ( e.g. brunetti et al .",
    "2001 , hardcastle et al . 2002a ; isobe et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "prior to the availability of sensitive x - ray data , studies of radio - galaxy dynamics and source evolution were based almost entirely on measurements of radio synchrotron emission .",
    "as synchrotron emissivity depends on magnetic field strength as well as electron energy density , our knowledge of the physical properties of the sources has been limited .",
    "the assumption of equipartition of energy density between particles ( relativistic electrons ) and magnetic field has typically been used to obtain values for the physical properties of jets , lobes and hotspots . however , there are problems with this assumption . in particular ,",
    "the internal radio - lobe pressures determined on this basis have been found to be significantly lower than the external pressures inferred from x - ray measurements in both fr - i and fr - ii radio galaxies ( e.g. morganti et al .",
    "1988 ; worrall & birkinshaw 2000 ; hardcastle & worrall 2000a ) , which is inconsistent with lobe expansion .",
    "investigation of the validity of this assumption is therefore essential for a full understanding of the dynamics and evolution of radio galaxies .",
    "x - ray ic emission has been detected from the lobes and hotspots of a number of radio galaxies ( e.g. harris et al . 1994 ; hardcastle et al . 2001 ;",
    "brunetti et al . 2001 ; hardcastle et al . 2002a ; belsole et al .",
    "as this emission process does not involve the magnetic field , the x - ray ic flux can be used in combination with the radio synchrotron spectrum to determine the magnetic field strength of the emitting region . to date , detected lobe ic sources are typically found to be near to equipartition or in the particle - dominated regime , with magnetic fields @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the equipartition value . however , the results are dependent on the parameters of the input electron energy spectrum used to model the radio synchrotron emission , and on the careful separation of thermal and non - thermal x - ray emission , so that estimates from different authors are often not directly comparable , and the overall picture remains unclear .",
    "the study of lobe ic emission also has implications for the dynamics of radio galaxies .",
    "as defined above , the equipartition calculation assumes that the only particles in the radio lobes are the relativistic electrons ( and positrons ) responsible for the radio emission .",
    "if the lobes contain large contributions from additional particles , such as relativistic protons , then there is no physical reason for them to prefer magnetic field strengths close to the value of @xmath3 calculated for electrons only .",
    "therefore , if observations show that sources _ are _ commonly found with @xmath4 , this suggests that the minimum - energy lobe pressures are correct and that there is no energetically dominant population of non - radiating particles . by combining observations of lobe - related emission and thermal emission from the surrounding medium ,",
    "it is possible to test models of radio - source expansion .",
    "it is therefore useful to find more examples of radio galaxies with lobe - related x - ray emission . in this paper , we describe new _ xmm - newton _ observations of two powerful ( fr - ii ) radio galaxies , 3c 223 ( @xmath5 ) and 3c 284 ( @xmath6 ) , and discuss the dynamics of the radio sources and their impact on their surrounding hot - gas environments .",
    "we use a cosmology with h@xmath7 = 70 km s@xmath8 mpc@xmath8 , @xmath9 = 0.3 , and @xmath10 = 0.7 throughout , which gives a scale of 2.4 kpc arcsec@xmath8 at the distance of 3c 223 , and a scale of 3.8 kpc arcsec@xmath8 at the distance of 3c 284 .",
    "_ xmm - newton _ observed 3c  223 in october 2001 and 3c  284 in december 2002 .",
    "both observations were made using the medium filter , and the pn data were taken in extended full frame mode . for",
    "3c  223 , the duration was 33903 s for the mos 1 camera , 33917 s for the mos 2 camera and 25849 s for the pn camera , and for 3c  284 , the duration was 43066 s for mos1 , 43104 s for mos2 and 35806 s for pn .",
    "we reduced the data using the _ xmm - newton _ scientific analysis software ( sas ) package , using methods described in the xmm - sas handbook .",
    "the data were filtered for good time intervals using a count - level threshold determined by examining a histogram of the count rate above 10 kev . for 3c 223 ,",
    "the threshold levels used were 4 cts / s for mos1 , 3 cts / s for mos2 , and 5 cts / s for pn ; for 3c 284 they were 1.4 cts / s for mos1 and mos2 and 1.3 cts / s for pn .",
    "the data were then filtered using the flag bitmask 0x766a0600 for mos and 0xfa000c for pn , which are equivalent to the standard flagset # xmmea_em / ep but include out of field - of - view events ( useful for studying the particle component of the background ) and exclude bad columns and rows .",
    "they were also filtered for patterns less than or equal to 12 for the mos cameras and less than or equal to 4 for the pn , as suggested in the handbook .",
    "the 3c  223 observation included several large background flares , so that the filtered data were of duration 23138s for mos1 , 24651 s for mos2 and 12305 s for pn .",
    "the filtered 3c  284 data were of duration 41775 s for mos1 , 41496 s for mos2 and 32095 s for pn .",
    "our images were created using software that interpolates over the _ xmm - newton _ chip gaps ( described in more detail in croston et al . 2003 ) to avoid artefacts in smoothed images .",
    "we then adaptively smoothed the images using the ciao task _ csmooth _ for the purpose of better identifying contaminating point sources .",
    "the point sources were removed from the unsmoothed images using the ciao task _ dmfilth _ , and the region files retained for use in spectral analysis .",
    "none of the point sources coincided with the positions of the radio lobes , so that we can not have accidentally removed any radio - related emission .",
    "the resulting images were smoothed using gaussian kernels in order to show the distribution of extended emission , and also adaptively smoothed to show compact structure in the regions of extended emission . as the x - ray structure shown in the images",
    "is on - axis , we do not include the vignetting correction in the images .",
    "see section 2.1 for a more detailed discussion of the vignetting correction .",
    "spectral analysis was performed using scripts based on the sas _ evselect _ tool to extract spectra from all three cameras . for the spectral analysis",
    ", we included the vignetting correction by using sas task _ evigweight _ , so as to be able to use on - axis response files downloaded from the _ xmm - newton _",
    "website rather than indivually generated responses for each spectrum and camera .",
    "we checked that there is no significant difference in the results we obtain with these response files and with files generated using _",
    "rmfgen_. we generated ancillary response files using _ arfgen_. as the extraction regions are typically small and on - axis , we used local background subtraction , because this is likely to be a more accurate representation of the true background in the source regions than background spectra obtained from template files .",
    "the source and background spectra were scaled to account for differences in area using the sas task _ backscale _ , as _ evselect _ does not put this information in spectrum headers .",
    "[ 223reg ] shows the choice of spectral regions for 3c  223 and fig .",
    "[ 284reg ] for 3c  284 .",
    "we used xspec for spectral model fitting , and all of our fits assume galactic absorption , with @xmath11 @xmath12 and @xmath13 @xmath12 ( dickey & lockman 1990 ) for 3c  223 and 3c  284 , respectively .    in order to search for extended emission that might be associated with a hot - gas atmosphere",
    ", we used radial surface - brightness profiling of the central regions . software developed in earlier work ( e.g. birkinshaw & worrall 1993 ; hardcastle et al .",
    "2002b ) was used to extract and fit radial profiles .",
    "we fitted models obtained by convolving a point source with a @xmath14-model to the surface - brightness profiles , and compared these with point - source only models to study the significance of any contribution from extended emission .",
    "for the point - source models we used the analytical description in the document xmm - soc - cal - tn-0022 , obtained from the _ xmm - newton _ website .",
    "the inclusion of the vignetting correction has the effect of incorrectly weighting up unvignetted particle events . by examining the events in the region outside the field of view",
    ", we found that the contribution of particle events to the background is particularly high in these two datasets ( between 30 and 50 per cent of events in the background spectra ) , so that these incorrectly weighted events could significantly affect our results .    for imaging the x - ray structure in our dataset ,",
    "it is preferable not to include the correction , because the weighted - up particle events lead to bright regions at the edges of the image , particularly after smoothing . for spectral analysis ,",
    "the correction is more important .",
    "however , our extraction regions are mainly on - axis , so that the weighting factor is typically quite small ( always less than 20 per cent ) .",
    "we concluded that the effect of including the correction , which leads to a slight overestimation of the background level for spectral analysis , is less than the error introduced by not correcting the spectra , which would lead to an underestimation of the background level .",
    "therefore , all of our spectral analysis was performed with the vignetting - corrected events list .",
    "this compromise means that systematic errors are introduced into the background spectra at a level of @xmath15 per cent for 3c  223 and @xmath16 per cent for 3c  284 .",
    "we compared corrected and uncorrected spectra for our largest extraction region for each source , and found consistent best - fitting spectral parameters , but a significant difference in the model flux .",
    "where it could affect our conclusions , we calculated a systematic error in flux measurements by determining the fractional increase in background - subtracted source counts if the background is over - estimated by the amounts given above .",
    "these provide conservative upper limits on the flux values , as source counts are also slightly overestimated ( always by less than 2 per cent , since the weighting factor is lower in the source regions ) .",
    "we included the vignetting correction in the radial - profile analysis , for similar reasons as above .",
    "since the low surface brightness of the extended emission leads to large uncertainties on @xmath14-model parameters , the error introduced here by the weighted - up particle events is not significant .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     we determined internal lobe pressures from the radio - synchrotron models described in section 4.2 , above , assuming an electron filling factor of unity , and that the only contribution to pressure comes from the population of relativistic electrons producing the synchrotron emission .",
    "we used the magnetic field strengths given above calculated based on the measured ic flux .",
    "we then calculated the external pressure on the lobes from the x - ray - emitting gas using the the best - fitting thermal models for the extended emission described in section 4.3 , above .",
    "we used the results of birkinshaw & worrall ( 1993 ) to determine pressure as a function of radius from the emission measure and the @xmath14-model fit parameters . for each source , we determined the pressure halfway along the lobes , and at the ends of the lobes . for 3c  284 , we did the pressure calculation separately for each lobe as they are asymmetrical in length .",
    "internal and external pressures for each source are given in table  [ pressures ] .",
    "the errors we quote for pressures are based on the errors on the best - fitting @xmath14-model parameters , which are the main contribution to uncertainty in the pressure .",
    "we assume that @xmath14 is between 0.35 and 2 , as the fits are poorly constrained . for 3c  223 ,",
    "the factor of three uncertainty in the flux from the atmosphere leads to a @xmath17 per cent increase in the pressure values ( not included here ) , which does not significantly affect our conclusions below about pressure balance . for 3c  284 ,",
    "the factor of three uncertainty in the flux from the atmosphere leads to a 50  70 percent increase in the pressure values ( not included here ) . as for 3c  223",
    ", this does not significantly affect the conclusions .",
    "table  [ pressures ] shows that 3c  223 is consistent with being in pressure balance at the ends of the source , but likely to be underpressured at the midpoint . for 3c  284",
    "there is also approximate pressure balance at the ends of the source , and at the midpoint the lobes are underpressured by a factor of @xmath0 2 .",
    "these results suggest that self - similar models of radio - source expansion ( e.g. falle 1991 ; kaiser & alexander 1997 ; see also a discussion of these models in hardcastle & worrall 2000a ) , which require that the entire source be overpressured , no longer apply to these sources .",
    "3c  223 and 3c  284 are comparatively large sources , so that it seems plausible that they have reached a stage of expansion where the inner parts of the sources are now underpressured .",
    "the outer parts of the source are still expanding , but the lateral expansion is now subsonic .",
    "further support for this model comes from the radio structure of the two sources , which have a  pinched  appearance in the central regions .",
    "gas that was intially pushed out by lobe expansion may now be falling back in and crushing the central part of the cocoon .    if we instead adopt the second interpretation of the lobe emission  that it is thermal in origin , and hot  then the lateral expansion of the lobes must be supersonic and overpressured , so as to produce shock - heated gas surrounding the entire lobes . in this scenario , since all of the x - ray flux from the lobes is attributed to hot gas , the level of ic emission from the lobes must be much lower than the values we used in section 4.2 .",
    "this means that the lobes must either be magnetically dominated , so that the pressure for supersonic expansion comes from the magnetic field , or else contain a dominant proton or other non - radiating particle contribution .",
    "this interpretation requires two coincidences : an x - ray flux which happens to be at the level expected for the minimum energy condition in the absence of protons , and that the minimum energy condition happens to correspond to an internal pressure approximately in balance with the pressure from the surrounding hot gas .",
    "we therefore consider that the ic model for the lobe emission is far more plausible .",
    "however , in the following section , we discuss the constraints that our results have placed on models that require overpressured lobes .      in order for supersonic lateral expansion of the lobes ,",
    "they must either be magnetically dominated , or dominated by non - radiating particles , as described above .",
    "the lobes of low - power ( fr - i ) radio galaxies do require a large contribution from one of these constituents ; however , it seems likely that much of the additional pressure in fr - is comes from material entrained into the lobes as the jets decelerate ( e.g. bicknell 1984 , laing & bridle 2002 ) . in fr - iis , where entrainment is not thought to be an efficient process , a different explanation is probably necessary if the lobes are required to be overpressured .",
    "it is therefore tempting to accept the self - consistent model we proposed in the previous section , in which the two sources are at equipartition and in approximate pressure balance , so as to avoid requiring this additional explanation .",
    "nevertheless , we briefly consider possible pressure contributions to fr - ii lobes in the following paragraphs , both to constrain supersonically expanding models , and since our upper limits on external pressure for 3c  223 leave room for a large contribution from other particles in that source .",
    "constraints on the amount of cold gas and a subrelativistic tail to the electron population can be obtained by examining the limits on faraday depolarization . for 3c  284 ,",
    "leahy , pooley & riley ( 1986 ) report only slight depolarisation between 11 and 18 cm . to investigate whether 3c223 showed evidence for internal or external depolarization we retrieved vla data from the public archive .",
    "the low - frequency data were from 1.5-ghz observations in the vla b and c configurations , described by leahy & perley ( 1991 ) , while the high - frequency data we used were from the two - pointing 8.4-ghz observations at c and d configuration described by leahy et al .",
    "the total and polarized intensities were compared within a fixed contour ( the 5-@xmath18 level of the 8.4-ghz total intensity map ) . for both lobes",
    "the degree of polarization was essentially identical ( 20 per cent ) at the two frequencies ; the ratio of degrees of polarization was 1.0 .",
    "there is therefore no detection of radio depolarization in 3c223 , though we emphasise that the steep spectrum of the lobes means that there is essentially no detectable 8-ghz lobe flux density within 45 arcsec of the radio core .",
    "we conclude that it is unlikely that sufficient cold gas is present in the lobes of either source to allow supersonic lateral expansion .",
    "the presence of sufficient low - energy electrons to provide significant pressure would require a steepening of the electron energy spectrum below the observable radio region ( e.g. @xmath19 ) .",
    "such a population of electrons can not be ruled out by our data ; however , its physical origin is unclear .",
    "if relativistic protons are providing the additional pressure , then large proton to electron ratios would be needed for supersonic expansion .",
    "there are arguments suggesting that a significant proton population is required in parsec - scale jets ( e.g. celotti & fabian 1993 ) , so that they should be present and provide pressure in the lobes as well .",
    "we can not rule out some contribution from protons .    in the absence of efficient entrainment , there are few physically plausible means for the lobes to contain sufficient pressure to be expanding supersonically in all directions .",
    "we can not rule out magnetic domination in the lobes or a dominant population of relativistic protons .",
    "however , as discussed above , either of these scenarios requires the x - ray flux from a power - law model to coincide with the level expected for minimum energy ic emission in the absence of protons .",
    "we have detected x - ray emission from the lobes of two fr - ii radio galaxies , 3c  223 and 3c  284 , which in both cases can be attributed to inverse - compton emission from cosmic microwave background photons . in both cases",
    "the magnetic field strengths inferred from the levels of x - ray flux are near to minimum energy values in the absence of protons .",
    "we also detect extended emission surrounding the two sources .",
    "both sources are in large group - scale atmospheres with temperatures of @xmath0 1 kev .",
    "our data are not of sufficient sensitivity to detect temperature variations in the hot - gas atmosphere .",
    "we find that the lobes are in approximate pressure balance with their external environments if they contain only relativistic electrons , but that additional material or magnetic dominance would be required in a model where the lobes have lateral supersonic expansion .",
