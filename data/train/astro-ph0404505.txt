    "ram pressure @xcite can inhibit star formation by exhausting the gas present in galaxies that move fast in the intergalactic medium of rich clusters .",
    "similarly , galaxy harassment @xcite can produce significant changes in the star formation rate of a galaxy .",
    "these effects are not expected to be important in poor clusters or groups , where the velocity dispersion is lower , instead , effects such as mergers or tidal interactions can be dominant in these environments @xcite .    besides affecting galaxy properties , such as star formation , luminosity and colour index , some of the physical processes listed above may also produce changes on the dynamics of the galaxy with respect to the cluster centre . in turn , the efficiency of some of these mechanisms to produce significant changes on a galaxy , depends on its dynamical behavior . for example , the effects of galaxy interactions are stronger for galaxies moving slowly with respect to the cluster centre .",
    "this suggests that the dynamical properties of galaxies in groups and clusters may be related with the star formation efficiency , colours or luminosities of galaxies@xcite .",
    "segregation effects of galaxy velocities in clusters are predicted theoretically @xcite , in semi  analytical models @xcite , and has been reported in rich clusters @xcite .",
    "the relation between the dynamical properties and the luminosity of a galaxy has been observed in rich clusters , by e.g. @xcite and @xcite , who find evidence for velocity segregation . in agreement with these findings , theoretical studies @xcite and numerical simulations @xcite show similar trends .    however , it is not clear how to interpret these results .",

    "we have also considered the central ( @xmath102 ) region of the groups , where it can be seen that the velocity segregation by luminosity is stronger ( see table 1 ) .",
    "this trend is similar to the observed behavior of the segregation by spectral type , which is stronger in denser environments ( see section [ sts ] ) and will be discussed in more detail in section [ globaldep ] .    given the significant velocity segregation by spectral types , we have searched for luminosity segregation in subsamples restricted to type i and types iii - iv galaxies .",
    "we find that the luminosity segregation signal is of less significance in these cases , indicating that luminosity is not a primary parameter in defining the dynamics of galaxies in groups .",
    "this suggests that early spectral type galaxies , on average more luminous than late types , could provide the observed dependence on luminosity .      using the same procedure",
    "we have also explored the relation between galaxy dynamics and colour index .",

    "a unique threshold is suitable to define a sample of red galaxies .    the normalized velocity distributions for red ( @xmath4 ) and blue ( @xmath5 ) galaxies",
    "are shown in fig . 5 , where a significant velocity segregation of velocity according to galaxy colour index can be clearly appreciated .",
    "given the correlation between @xmath3 colour index and spectral index @xmath11 , we have restricted our analysis to galaxies with low present star formation ( type i ) , and strongly star forming galaxies ( types iii - iv ) .",
    "the results are shown in table 1 , and for type i objects in the small box of fig .",
    "5 . as it can be appreciated , velocity segregation has a lower level of significance in the last case .       on @xmath104 .",
    "the dashed region displays the rms of the distribution of @xmath92 obtained for the random samples described in section [ ensamble ] .",

    "our results suggest that the segregation effects are stronger in denser environments although there is no indication of a strong dependence on the parent group mass . in this section",
    "we explore in more detail the dependence of our results on galaxy  group centric distance and parent group virial mass .    in fig .",
    "6 we show the dependence of the kurtosis differences @xmath92 on @xmath1 .",
    "the dashed region displays the rms of the distribution of @xmath92 obtained for the random samples described in section [ ensamble ] .",
    "it can be clearly appreciated that velocity segregation in the central regions ( @xmath100 ) is particularly important for spectral type and colour index but smoothly decreases at larger group centric distances . in a similar fashion , we have analysed the dependence of velocity segregation on parent group virial mass .",
    "our results for galaxies with @xmath100 are shown in fig .",
    "it can be appreciated that there is no strong dependence of the segregation effects on the mass of the parent group .",
    "this is an important fact suggesting that the mechanisms that generate the observed difference in the dynamics , according to the galaxy star formation activity , are efficient on a wide range of masses .      the uncertainty in redshift determinations in the 2dfgrs amounts to a rms of @xmath105 @xcite",
    "this is a quite large figure , so its effects on our statistical analysis deserves particular attention . to account for this uncertainty",

    "the resulting smoothed histograms are suitable to compute the parameters characterizing the differences of the distribution of velocities of two given samples of galaxies taking into account line of sight velocity errors . as an example of this analysis , in fig .",
    "8 we show the results for case 3 , where it can be appreciated that the binned and the smoothed distributions show the same behavior . moreover we have computed the parameters @xmath95 and @xmath92 for the cases shown in table 1 , finding similar results which show the stability of our analysis against redshift measurements errors .    as a test of the stability of our results against the number of group members",
    ", we have also analysed a sub - sample of groups restricted to have at least 20 members .",
    "we obtain similar and even more prominent segregation effects for the same galaxy properties analysed previously .",
    "also , in order to test the effects of possible erroneous determination of the centre of the groups in our results , we have repeated the analysis for re  centered groups .",
    "these new centres where calculated using only galaxies within 1.2 times the virial radius and 2.5 times the velocity dispersion , which would provide a better estimate of group centres for elongated or clumpy systems .",
    "again here the results are similar and show that our conclusions are not strongly dependent on the group centre definition .",
    "inside box shows the binned case for comparison.,title=\"fig : \" ] [ smooth ]    we find a statistically significant difference of the distributions of group centric line of sight velocities , normalized to the group mean velocity dispersion , for samples of galaxies selected by spectral type , luminosity or colour index . given the large data set analysed , we have been able to investigate the dependence of this velocity segregation on group properties and galaxy  group centric distance .",
    "spectral type i objects , corresponding to passively star forming galaxies , show a statistically narrower velocity distribution than that of galaxies with a substantial star formation activity ( types iii - iv ) .",
    "similarly , samples of galaxies with greater colour index ( @xmath4 ) have a larger fraction of small velocities ( @xmath93 ) compared to galaxies with @xmath5 .",
    "these two trends show a strong correlation between galaxy dynamics in groups and star formation , reflected both by spectral type and by colour index .",
    "the velocity distribution of luminous galaxies ( typically brighter than @xmath107 ) also show a larger fraction of small velocities , although we notice that once the galaxies are restricted to a given spectral type , there is a less significant segregation .",
    "thus , luminosity is not likely to be a primary parameter determining galaxy dynamics in groups .",
    "our results suggest that the observed luminosity segregation might be related to the fact that the slowest objects , of early spectral type , are on average more luminous than star forming galaxies .",
    "there are several mechanisms that may produce dynamical segregations of galaxies in groups and clusters .",
    "ram pressure can effectively remove the existing gas in the galaxies and transform star forming into passively star forming objects .",
    "this mechanism affects most strongly those galaxies with large velocities with respect to the intra  cluster medium ,",
    "and then it should produce a dynamical segregation with opposite trends to the observed one .",
    "moreover , since our analysis concerns groups and small clusters of galaxies , ram pressure is not expected to be significant .",
    "our results indicates that the velocity segregation effects are nearly independent of group virial mass .",
    "this fact also suggests that ram pressure is not important since its effects are stronger in more massive systems , and with higher velocity dispersion .",
    "thus , it is unlikely that ram pressure may explain the observed correlations .",
    "mergers on the other hand , are effective to generate spheroidal objects with a low star formation rate .",
    "galaxy encounters are expected to lower the original cluster - centric relative velocities of each galaxy , with respect to the velocities of the galaxies prior to the merger event , so that they can act effectively in generating the observed trends .    in a similar fashion ,",
    "tidal interactions may effectively remove a substantial amount of gas from disks of galaxies , and then , are also effective in truncating star formation .",
    "early type objects generated through this mechanism , would be biased to smaller velocities since interactions are expected to be more effective in slow encounters .",
    "furthermore , these are generally brighter and redder objects .",
    "it has been suggested that morphological transformation of galaxies takes place in systems which have a density threshold larger than the density of groups and poor clusters of galaxies @xcite .",
    "our results indicate that dynamical segregation of passively star forming galaxies is a generic feature of systems of galaxies , irrespective of global properties .",
    "however , the fact that segregation effectively occurs in the inner regions of groups indicates that density might be an important parameter in determining the observed effects .",
