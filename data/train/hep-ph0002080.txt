    "my assignment at the 1999 icfa instrumentation school is to survey some current developments in particle physics , and to describe the kinds of experiments we would like to do in the near future and illustrate the demands our desires place on detectors and data analysis . like any active science ,",
    "particle physics is in a state of continual renewal .",
    "many of the subjects that seem most fascinating and most promising today simply did not exist as recently as twenty - five years ago .",
    "other topics that have preoccupied physicists for many years have been reshaped by recent discoveries and insights , and transformed by new techniques in accelerator science and detector technology . to provide some context for the courses and laboratories at this school ,",
    "i have chosen three topics that are of high scientific interest , and that place very different demands on instrumental techniques .",
    "i hope that you will begin to see the breadth of opportunities in particle physics , and that you will also look beyond the domain of particle physics for opportunities to apply the lessons you learn here in istanbul .",
    "i begin with the remarkable neutrino , a subatomic particle that our instruments must be able to detect both by its presence and by its absence , depending on the circumstances .",
    "in particular , i note the interest in observing and characterizing neutrino oscillations in order to determine the properties of the neutrinos , and describe some of the new instruments contemplated to do that",
    ". then i will talk about physics at the high - energy frontier , focusing on what we hope to learn from the top quark in the next set of experiments at fermilab s tevatron collider .",
    "third , i will tell you some of the ways we hope to explore the landscape of spacetime , and explore some of the signs we might find that the three - plus - one dimensions of ordinary experience are not the whole story .",
    "my treatment of all of these will be schematic ; in a single lecture , my intent is to raise questions and present a wide range of challenges and opportunities .",
    "neutrinos are tiny subatomic particles that carry no electric charge , have ( almost ) no mass , move ( nearly ) at the speed of light , and hardly interact at all .",
    "they are among the most abundant particles in the universe . as you listen to this lecture , inside your body are more than 10 million ( @xmath3 ) relic neutrinos left over from the big bang . each second",
    ", some @xmath4 neutrinos made in the sun pass through you . in one tick of the clock , about a thousand neutrinos made by cosmic - ray interactions in earth s atmosphere",
    "traverse your body .",
    "other neutrinos reach us from natural sources , including radioactive decays of elements inside the earth , and artificial sources , such as nuclear reactors .",
    "our awareness of neutrinos started with a puzzle in 1914 that led to an idea in 1930 that was confirmed by an experiment in 1956 .",
    "today , neutrinos have become an important tool for particle physics and astrophysics , and fascinating objects of study that may yield important new clues about the basic laws of nature .",
    "there was a neutrino puzzle even before physicists knew there was a neutrino .",
    "natural and artificial radioactivity includes nuclear beta ( @xmath5 ) decay , observed as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the old - fashioned name for an electron and @xmath8 stands for the nucleus with @xmath9 protons and @xmath10 neutrons .",
    "examples are tritium @xmath5 decay , @xmath11 neutron @xmath5 decay , @xmath12 and @xmath5 decay of lead-214 , @xmath13 for two - body decays , the principle of conservation of energy & momentum says that the @xmath5 particle , or electron , should have a definite energy , indicated by the spike in figure [ fig : betaspec ] .",
    "what was observed was very different : in 1914 , james chadwick ( later to discover the neutron ) showed conclusively @xcite that in the decay of radium b and c ( @xmath14pb and @xmath14bi ) , the @xmath5 energy follows a continuous spectrum , as shown in figure [ fig : betaspec ] .",
    "how could we account for this completely unexpected behavior ?",
    "might it mean that energy and momentum are not uniformly conserved in subatomic events ?",
    "although chadwick did not discover the neutron until 1932 , we can use a little chronological license to sharpen our puzzle by considering a cartoon of neutron @xmath5 decay .",
    "the continuous @xmath5 spectrum means that , in general , the products of the decay of a stationary neutron will not have balanced momenta ( zero net momentum ) , as shown in the left - hand frame in figure [ fig : enocons ] . for the products of a system at rest to drift off in some direction flies in the face of physical intuition , though we have to concede that at the time , physicists intuition was still largely derived from macroscopic experience",
    "the @xmath5-decay energy crisis tormented physicists for years . on december 4 , 1930 , wolfgang pauli addressed an open letter - spectrum ",
    "'' pauli concluded , `` for the moment i dare not publish anything about this idea and address myself confidentially first to you .",
    " i admit that my way out may seem rather improbable _ a priori _  .",
    "nevertheless , if you do nt play you ca nt win  .",
    "therefore , dear radioactives , test and judge . ''",
    "pauli s neutrino , together with the discovery of the neutron , also resolved a vexing nuclear spin - and - statistics problem . ] to a meeting on radioactivity in tbingen .",
    "pauli could not attend in person because his presence at a student ball in zurich was `` indispensable . '' in his letter , pauli advanced the outlandish idea of a new , very penetrating , neutral particle of vanishingly small mass . because pauli s new particle interacted very feebly with matter , it would escape undetected from any known apparatus , taking with it some energy , which would seemingly be lost . the balance of energy and momentum would be restored , as shown in the right - hand frame of figure [ fig : enocons ] , by the particle we now know as the electron s antineutrino . the proper decay scheme for the neutron is thus @xmath15    pauli s new particle was indeed a `` desperate remedy , '' but it was , in its way , very conservative , for it preserved the principle of energy and momentum conservation and with it the notion that the laws of physics are invariant under translations in space and time .",
    "the hypothesis fit the facts ; after the discovery of the neutron in 1932 , fermi named the new particle the neutrino , to distinguish it from the neutron , and constructed his four - fermion theory of the weak interaction .",
    "experimental confirmation of pauli s neutrino had to wait for dramatic advances in technology .    detecting a particle as penetrating as the neutrino required a large target and a copious source of neutrinos . in 1953 , clyde cowan and fred reines @xcite used the intense beam of antineutrinos from a fission reactor @xmath16 and a heavy target ( @xmath17 of liquid scintillator ) containing about @xmath18 protons to detect the reaction @xmath19 initial runs at the hanford engineering works were suggestive but inconclusive .",
    "moving their apparatus to the stronger fission neutrino source at the savannah river nuclear plant , cowan and reines and their team made the definitive observation of inverse @xmath5 decay in 1956 @xcite .",
    "in addition to the electron ( @xmath20 ) and its neutrino ( @xmath21 ) , we now recognize two other pairs of pointlike , spin-@xmath22 particles that are not affected by the strong interaction : @xmath23 these particles are known as leptons , from the greek @xmath24 = thin , inspired by the small mass of the electron , muon , and their neutrinos compared with the mass of the proton and neutron , the lightest of the baryons ( from the greek @xmath25 = heavy ) .",
    "the muon neutrino is created in charged pion decay , @xmath26 and neutrino beams produced at accelerators are overwhelmingly muon neutrinos .",
    "the two - neutrino experiment carried out at brookhaven national lab in the early 1960s @xcite demonstrated that the neutrinos produced in pion decays do not initiate inverse @xmath5 decay , so that @xmath27 is distinct from @xmath21 .",
    "the donut ( direct observation of nu - tau ) experiment @xcite under analysis at fermilab is a three - neutrino experiment .",
    "using a prompt neutrino beam in which decays of the charmed - strange meson provide the @xmath28 source , the experimenters aim to observe the reaction @xmath29 i expect to see results from donut in the year 2000 .",
    "neutrinos traverse vast amounts of material .",
    "the fission antineutrinos detected by cowan , reines , and their collaborators have an inverse @xmath5-decay cross section @xmath30 .",
    "accordingly , their interaction length , @xmath31 where @xmath32 is avogadro s number , @xmath33 is the specific gravity of the target , and @xmath34 is the proton fraction of the target nucleons , is very long .",
    "it corresponds to about @xmath35 of water , or a column density of @xmath36 kilotonnes per square centimeter . on average ,",
    "a fission neutrino would traverse more than four light - years of lead  the distance from earth to @xmath37-centauri  before interacting . at higher energies",
    ", the cross section for the inclusive reaction @xmath38 grows  at first @xmath39 , then more slowly ",
    "so the interaction length decreases .",
    "the high - energy dependence of the @xmath40 interaction length is shown in figure [ fig : lint ] .",
    "the interaction length of a 100-gev neutrino is approximately 25 million kilometers of water , or about 230 earth diameters .",
    "if you should stand in fermilab s neutrino beam , only one neutrino in @xmath41 will interact in your body .",
    "what are the consequences of the great interaction length ?",
    "first , there is the missing - energy signature for neutrinos .",
    "second , there is the difficulty of detecting neutrino interactions .",
    "third  because the other known particles all interact more than neutrinos do  we have the possibility of preparing filtered neutrino beams , which we shall discuss in a moment .",
    "fourth , because neutrinos can penetrate great columns of matter , whereas electromagnetic radiation is blocked by a few hundred grams of material , it is appealing to consider the promise of neutrino astronomy for peering into the hearts of dense structures or looking back at the state of the universe before recombination of ions and electrons into neutral atoms .    at high - energy accelerators ,",
    "neutrinos are tertiary products of collisions @xmath42 followed by the decays @xmath43 in an evacuated decay space up to a kilometer long .",
    "the decay region is followed by an earthen shield , perhaps made denser by the inclusion of blocks of iron or steel , that absorbs photons , surviving mesons , and other hadrons , and ranges out many of the muons . at fermilab ,",
    "the total length of the neutrino beam line is about @xmath44 .    in the most recent study of deeply inelastic neutrino scattering at fermilab , 800-gev protons from the tevatron",
    "deliver @xmath45 neutrinos in 5 pings over 2.5 seconds each minute , spread over the @xmath46 face of the nutev detector .",
    "the detector is made up of 690  t of iron , scintillator , and drift chambers .",
    "events are studied from a `` fiducial volume '' of 390  t. the @xmath45 neutrinos per minute produce about 10  20 events that are recorded for off - line analysis .",
    "experiments of this kind give us our best look at the interior of the proton , and reveal its quark structure in exquisite detail @xcite .",
    "_ neutrinos are very light . _",
    "no one has ever weighed a neutrino .",
    "the best kinematical determinations set upper bounds @xcite on the dominant neutrino species emitted in nuclear beta decay ( @xmath47 ) , charged - pion decay ( @xmath48 at 90% cl ) , and @xmath49-lepton decay ( @xmath50 at 95% cl ) . although there are prospectsfact 99 in lyon by alvaro de rjula , ref .",
    "] for improving these bounds  and the measurement of a nonzero mass would constitute a real discovery ",
    "they are sufficiently large that it is of interest to consider indirect ( nonkinematic ) constraints from other quarters .",
    "if neutrino lifetimes are greater than the age of the universe , the requirement that neutrino relics from the big bang not overclose the universe leads to a constraint on the sum of neutrino masses . for relatively light neutrinos ( @xmath51 ) , the total mass in neutrinos , @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the number of spin degrees of freedom of @xmath54 plus @xmath55 , sets the scale of the neutrino contribution to the mass density of the universe , @xmath56 .",
    "if we measure @xmath57 as a fraction of the critical density to close the universe , @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the reduced hubble parameter , then @xmath60 an assumed bound on @xmath61 then implies a bound on @xmath62 . a very conservative bound results from the assumption that @xmath63 : it is that @xmath64 .",
    "recent observations suggest that the total matter density is considerably smaller than the critical density , so that @xmath65 . if we fix @xmath66 and choose the plausible value @xmath67 , then we arrive at the still generous upper bound @xmath68 . taking into account the best ( and model - dependent ) information about the hot- and cold - dark - matter cocktail @xcite needed to reproduce the observed fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background",
    ", it seems likely that cosmology limits @xmath69 .",
    "it is worth remarking that the cosmological desire for hot dark matter has been on the wane .",
    "if neutrinos were exactly massless , neutrino physics would be simple",
    ". there would be no pattern of masses to explain , no neutrino decays , no mixing among lepton generations , and no neutrino oscillations",
    ". the only question would be why ?",
    "if neutrinos do have masses , the electroweak theory has more unexplained parameters : the neutrino masses , three mixing angles , and a -violating phase .",
    "neutrinos may decay , and neutrinos can oscillate from one electroweak species to another .      in the quantum world",
    ", particles are waves .",
    "if neutrinos @xmath70 have different masses @xmath71 , each neutrino flavor may be a mixture of different masses .",
    "let us consider two species for simplicity , and take @xmath72 if neutrinos are emitted with a definite momentum @xmath73 , the wave functions corresponding to the two mass eigenstates evolve with different frequencies .",
    "as a consequence , a beam born as pure @xmath27 may evolve a @xmath21 component with time .",
    "if the neutrino momentum is large compared with the neutrino masses , @xmath74 , then the probability for a @xmath21 component to develop in a @xmath27 beam after a time @xmath75 is @xmath76 measuring the propagation distance @xmath77 , approximating the neutrino energy as @xmath78 , and using the conversion factor @xmath79 , we can re - express @xmath80 arising as it does from a slight frequency mismatch , neutrino flavor oscillation is analogous to the beat - frequency phenomenon observed when two tuning forks with _ almost _ the same pitch",
    "are sounded at the same time .",
    "if the forks are sounded individually , producing waves    or ,    we might find it difficult to distinguish the pitches .",
    "but when we sound them together , the sound intensity    @xmath81    swells and fades periodically because the two sound waves are different , reflecting the physical difference between the two tuning forks .",
    "the probability that a neutrino born as @xmath27 remain a @xmath27 at distance @xmath82 is @xmath83    the probability for a @xmath27 to metamorphose into a @xmath21 , @xmath84 depends on two parameters related to experimental conditions : @xmath82 , the distance from the neutrino source to the detector , and @xmath85 , the neutrino energy .",
    "it also depends on two fundamental neutrino parameters : the difference of masses squared , @xmath86 , and the neutrino mixing parameter , @xmath87 .",
    "the amplitude of the probability oscillations is given by @xmath87 , as shown in figure [ fig : oscparam ] ; the wavelength of the oscillations is @xmath88 and the oscillation probability is greatest at a distance @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is an integer .",
    "many experiments have now used natural sources of neutrinos , neutrino radiation from fission reactors , and neutrino beams generated in particle accelerators to look for evidence of neutrino oscillation .",
    "the nuclear burning that powers the sun produces neutrinos as well as light and heat @xcite .",
    "overall , a network of reactions we may summarize as @xmath91 leads to the spectrum of neutrinos shown in figure [ fig : sunjb ] .",
    "because solar neutrinos interact so feebly , they can only be detected in a very massive target and detector .",
    "the super - kamiokande detector in japan consists of @xmath92 tonnes of pure water viewed by @xmath93 photomultiplier tubes to detect cherenkov light .",
    "it is sited @xmath94 under a mountain , under @xmath95 .",
    "the great advantage of the super - k detector is that it detects neutrino interactions @xmath96 in real time , and determines the neutrino direction from the electron direction .",
    "super - k has demonstrated that the brightest object in the neutrino sky is the sun , which proves that nuclear fusion powers our star .",
    "the disadvantage of the water - cherenkov technique ( see figure [ fig : sunjb ] ) is that it is only sensitive to the highest - energy solar neutrinos .",
    "five solar - neutrino experiments report deficits with respect to the predictions of the standard solar model : kamiokande and super - kamiokande using water - cherenkov techniques , sage and gallex using chemical recovery of germanium produced in neutrino interactions with gallium , and homestake using radiochemical separation of argon produced in neutrino interactions with chlorine .",
    "these results suggest the oscillation @xmath97 .",
    "cosmic rays that interact in earth s atmosphere produce neutrinos in the decays of pions , kaons , and muons , in the approximate proportions @xmath98 .",
    "five atmospheric - neutrino experiments report anomalies in the arrival of muon neutrinos : kamiokande , imb , and super - kamiokande using water - cherenkov techniques , and soudan ii and macro using sampling calorimetry .",
    "the most striking result is the zenith - angle dependence of the @xmath27 rate reported last year by super - k @xcite , which is shown in figure [ fig : atmo ] .",
    "the electron - like events follow the monte carlo simulation , but the muon - like events exhibit a deficit that is most pronounced for upward - coming neutrinos , _",
    "i.e. _ , those for which the flight path is longest , up to @xmath99 .",
    "these results suggest the oscillation @xmath100 .",
    "auxiliary information disfavors the sterile - neutrino ( @xmath101 ) interpretation .",
    "the atmospheric- and solar - neutrino anomalies are both disappearance phenomena .",
    "a single experiment reports the appearance of neutrinos that would not be seen in the absence of neutrino oscillations .",
    "the lsnd experiment @xcite reports the observation of @xmath102-like events is what should be an essentially pure @xmath103 beam produced at the los alamos meson physics facility , suggesting the oscillation @xmath104 .",
    "this result has not yet been reproduced by any other experiment .",
    "a host of experiments have failed to turn up evidence for neutrino oscillations in the regimes of their sensitivity .",
    "these results limit neutrino mass - squared differences and mixing angles . in more than a few cases ,",
    "positive and negative claims are in conflict , or at least face off against each other . over the next five years , many experiments will seek to verify , further quantify , and extend these claims .",
    "our colleagues working to assess the feasibility of very - high - energy muon colliders have given us the courage to think that it may be possible , not too many years in the future , to accumulate @xmath105 ( or even @xmath106 ) muons per year .",
    "it is very exciting to think of the possibilities that millimoles of muons would raise for studies in fundamental physics .    from the perspective of a muon collider",
    ", the 2.2-@xmath107s lifetime of the muon presents a formidable challenge .",
    "but if the challenge of producing , capturing , storing , and replenishing many unstable muons can be met , the decays @xmath108 offer delicious possibilities for the study of neutrino interactions and neutrino properties @xcite .",
    "we would have at our disposal for the first time not only neutrino beams of unprecedented intensity , but also controlled beams rich in high - energy electron neutrinos . in a _ neutrino factory _",
    ", the composition and spectra of intense neutrino beams will be determined by the charge , momentum , and polarization of the stored muons .",
    "the beam from a @xmath109 storage ring contains @xmath103 and @xmath21 , but no @xmath27 , @xmath102 , @xmath28 , or @xmath110 .",

    "the muon storage ring is compact .",
    "we could build it at one laboratory , pitched at a deep angle , to illuminate a laboratory on the other side of the globe with a neutrino beam whose properties we can control with great precision . by choosing the right combination of energy and destination , we can tune future neutrino - oscillation experiments to the physics questions we will need to answer , by specifying the ratio of path length to neutrino energy and determining the amount of matter the neutrinos traverse . although we can use each muon decay only once , and we will not be able to select many destinations , we may be able to illuminate two or three well - chosen sites from a muon - storage - ring neutrino source .",
    "that possibility  added to the ability to vary the muon charge , polarization , and energy  may give us just the degree of experimental control it will take to resolve the outstanding questions about neutrino oscillations .",
    "_ the detector challenge . _ to distinguish oscillations among @xmath21 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and a possible fourth , `` sterile , '' neutrino @xmath101 that does not experience weak interactions , we require a target _ cum _ detector of several kilotonnes  perhaps several tens of kilotonnes  that can distinguish electrons , muons , and taus , and measure their charges .",
    "this is a straightforward requirement for the muons , but the short - lived ( @xmath115 ) @xmath49 and the eager - to - shower electron are more difficult to deal with .",
    "top is a most remarkable particle , even for a quark .",
    "a single top quark weighs @xmath116 , about as much as an atom of gold .",
    "but unlike the gold atom , which can be disassembled into 79 protons , 79 electrons , and 118 neutrons , top seems indivisible , for we discern no structure at a resolution approaching @xmath117 .",
    "top s expected lifetime of about 0.4 yoctosecond ( @xmath118 ) makes it by far the most ephemeral of the quarks .",
    "the compensation for this exceedingly brief life is a measure of freedom : top decays before it experiences the confining influence of the strong interaction . in spite of its fleeting existence ,",
    "the top quark helps shape the character of the everyday world .",
    "the discovery experiments were carried out at fermilab s tevatron , in which a beam of 900-gev protons collides with a beam of 900-gev antiprotons .",
    "creating top - antitop pairs in sufficient numbers to claim discovery demanded exceptional performance from the tevatron , for only one interaction in ten billion results in a top - antitop pair , through the reaction observing traces of the disintegration of top into a @xmath119-quark and a @xmath120-boson , the agent of the weak interaction , required highly capable detectors and extraordinary attention to experimental detail .",
    "both the @xmath119-quark and the @xmath120-boson are themselves unstable , with many multibody decay modes .",
    "the @xmath119-quark s mean lifetime is about @xmath121 .",
    "it can be identified by a decay vertex displaced by a fraction of a millimeter from the production point , or by the low - momentum electron or muon from the semileptonic decays @xmath122 , @xmath123 , each with branching fraction about 10% .",
    "the @xmath120 boson decays after only @xmath124 on average into @xmath125 , @xmath126 , @xmath127 , or a quark and antiquark ( observed as two jets of hadrons ) , with probabilities 1/9 , 1/9 , 1/9 , and 2/3 . the characteristic modes in which @xmath128 production can be sought are shown with their relative weights in figure [ fig : tarte ] .",
    "dilepton events ( @xmath129 @xmath130 , and @xmath131 ) are produced primarily when both @xmath120 bosons decay into @xmath132 or @xmath133 .",
    "events in the lepton + jets channels @xmath134 occur when one @xmath120 boson decays into leptons and the other decays through quarks into hadrons .",
    "another challenge to experiment is the complexity of events in high - energy @xmath135 collisions .",
    "the top and antitop are typically accompanied by scores of other particles .",
    "the discovery experiments scanned @xmath136 events per second .",
    "each detector is an intricate apparatus operated by an international collaboration of about 450 physicists .",
    "the tracking devices , calorimeters , and surrounding iron for muon identification occupy a volume about three stories high and weigh about 5000 tons .",
    "the collider detector at fermilab ( cdf ) , a magnetic detector with solenoidal geometry , profited from its high - resolution silicon vertex detector ( svx ) to tag @xmath119-quarks with good efficiency .",
    "the d  detector ( d - zero ) had no central magnetic field , emphasizing instead calorimetric measurement of the energies of produced particles .",
    "a top event from the cdf detector , shown in figure [ fig : cdftop ] , displays the power of the silicon vertex detector to resolve secondary @xmath119 decays at only a small remove from the production vertex .",
    "the d  event pictured in figure [ fig : dzerotop ] shows one @xmath120 boson reconstructed from a muon plus missing energy , and a second @xmath120 reconstructed from two jets .    _ the detector challenge . _ to select top - quark events with high efficiency , and to measure them effectively , require the ability to decide quickly which few of the @xmath3 events per second in tevatron run 2 ( @xmath137 per second at the lhc ) are interesting ; excellent @xmath119 tagging , resolving secondary vertices within a few tenths of a millimeter of the collision point in a hostile high - radiation environment ; efficient lepton identification and measurement of both electron and muon momenta , even for leptons in jets ; calorimetry that provides good jet - jet invariant mass resolution and a reliable measurement of missing transverse energy ; a hermetic detector .    for the moment",
    ", the direct study of the top quark belongs to the tevatron .",
    "early in the next century , samples twenty times greater than the current samples should be in hand , thanks to the increased event rate made possible by fermilab s main injector and upgrades to cdf and d .",
    "boosting the tevatron s energy to @xmath138 per beam will increase the top yield by nearly 40% .",
    "further enhancements to fermilab s accelerator complex are under study . a decade from now , the large hadron collider at cern will produce tops at more than ten thousand times the rate of the discovery experiments . electron - positron linear colliders or muon colliders may add new opportunities for the study of top - quark properties and dynamics .",
    "in the meantime , the network of understanding known as the standard model of particle physics links the properties of top to many phenomena to be explored in other experiments .    how can we expect new experiments to extend our knowledge of the top quark ?",
    "tevatron run 2 , to begin in march 2001 , is to accumulate @xmath139 of integrated luminosity .",
    "we anticipate a determination of the top mass to @xmath140 in run 2 , @xmath141 with @xmath142 in run 2@xmath143 or in lhc experiments . combined with a measurement of the @xmath120-boson mass to @xmath144 ,",
    "this measurement will make it possible to infer the higgs - boson mass with increased precision .",
    "it is now possible to begin asking how precisely top fits the profile of anticipated properties in its production and decay . it should be possible to determine the @xmath145 coupling in single - top production : @xmath146 in run 2 , @xmath147 in run 2@xmath143 .",
    "one of the exploratory goals of the new round of experiments will be to search for @xmath128 resonances , rare decays , and deviations from the expected pattern of top decays .",
    "finally , it may prove possible to begin to probe the ephemeral lifetime of top .",
    "on the theoretical front , the large mass of top encourages us to think that the two problems of mass may be linked at the electroweak scale .",
    "it is popular to say that top quarks were produced in great numbers in the fiery cauldron of the big bang some fifteen billion years ago , disintegrated in the merest fraction of a second , and vanished from the scene until my colleagues learned to create them in the tevatron .",
    "that would be reason enough to care about top : to learn how it helped sow the seeds for the primordial universe that evolved into our world of diversity and change .",
    "but it is not the whole story ; it invests the top quark with a remoteness that veils its importance for the everyday world .",
    "the real wonder is that here and now , every minute of every day , the top quark affects the world around us . through the uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics , top quarks and antiquarks",
    "wink in and out of an ephemeral presence in our world .",
    "though they appear virtually , fleetingly , on borrowed time , top quarks have real effects .",
    "quantum effects make the coupling strengths of the fundamental interactions ",
    "appropriately normalized analogues of the fine - structure constant @xmath37vary with the energy scale on which the coupling is measured .",
    "the fine - structure constant itself has the familiar value @xmath148 in the low - energy ( or long - wavelength ) limit , but grows to about @xmath149 at the mass of the @xmath150 boson , about @xmath151 .",
    "vacuum - polarization effects make the effective electric charge increase at short distances or high energies .",
    "in unified theories of the strong , weak , and electromagnetic interactions , all the coupling `` constants '' take on a common value , @xmath152 , at some high energy , @xmath153 .",
    "if we adopt the point of view that @xmath154 is fixed at the unification scale , then the mass of the top quark is encoded in the value of the strong coupling @xmath155 that we experience at low energies .",
    "unified theory that contains the standard - model gauge group @xmath156 .",
    "the final result is more general . ] assuming three generations of quarks and leptons , we evolve @xmath155 downwards in energy from the unification scale .",
    "the leading - logarithmic behavior is given by @xmath157 for @xmath158 .",
    "the positive coefficient @xmath159 means that the strong coupling constant @xmath160 is smaller at high energies than at low energies .",
    "this behavior  opposite to the familiar behavior of the electric charge  is the celebrated property of asymptotic freedom . in the interval between @xmath161 and @xmath162 ,",
    "the slope @xmath163 ( where @xmath164 is the number of active quark flavors ) steepens to @xmath165 , and then increases by another @xmath166 at every quark threshold . at the boundary @xmath167 between effective field theories with @xmath168 and @xmath169 active flavors , the coupling constants @xmath170 and @xmath171 must match .",
    "this behavior is shown by the solid line in figure [ fig : courant ] .",
    "the dotted line in figure [ fig : courant ] shows how the evolution of @xmath172 changes if the top - quark mass is reduced .",
    "a smaller top mass means a larger low - energy value of @xmath172 , so a smaller value of @xmath155 .",
    "to discover the dependence of @xmath173 upon the top - quark mass , we calculate @xmath174 evolving up from low energies and down from the unification scale , and match : @xmath175 identifying @xmath176 we find that @xmath177    thanks to qcd , we have learned that the dominant contribution to the light - hadron masses is not the masses of the quarks of which they are constituted , but the energy stored up in confining the quarks in a tiny volume .",
    "our most useful tool in the strong - coupling regime is lattice qcd . calculating the light hadron spectrum from first principles",
    "has been one of the main objectives of the lattice program , and important strides have been made recently . in 1994 ,",
    "the gf11 collaboration @xcitecarried out a quenched calculation of the spectrum ( no dynamical fermions ) that yielded masses that agree with experiment within 510% , with good understanding of the residual systematic uncertainties .",
    "the cp - pacs collaboration centered in tsukuba has embarked on an ambitious program that will soon lead to a full ( unquenched ) calculation @xcite .    neglecting the tiny `` current - quark '' masses of the up and down quarks",
    ", the scale parameter @xmath178 is the only mass parameter in qcd .",
    "it determines the scale of the confinement energy that is the dominant contribution to the proton mass . to a good first approximation , @xmath179 where the constant of proportionality @xmath180 is calculable using techniques of lattice field theory .",
    "we conclude that , in a simple unified theory , @xmath181 this is a wonderful result .",
    "now , we ca nt use it to compute the mass of the top quark , because we do nt know the values of @xmath182 and @xmath154 , and havent yet calculated precisely the constant of proportionality between the proton mass and the qcd scale parameter . never mind ! the important lesson ",
    "no surprise to any twentieth - century physicist  is that the microworld does determine the behavior of the quotidian .",
    "we will fully understand the origin of one of the most important parameters in the everyday world ",
    "the mass of the proton  only by knowing the properties of the top quark .",
    "ordinary experience tells us that spacetime has @xmath183 dimensions .",
    "could our perceptions be limited ?",
    "that is the question raised allegorically in _ flatland , _ a victorian fable published in 1880 by a british schoolmaster , edwin abbott abbott ( 1839  1926 ) , and still widely available @xcite .    like any question that tests our preconceptions and unspoken assumptions , `` what is the dimensionality of spacetime ? ''",
    "is a legitimate scientific question , to which we should return from time to time .",
    "it is given immediacy by recent theoretical work .",
    "for its internal consistency , string theory requires an additional six or seven space dimensions , beyond the @xmath183 dimensions of everyday experience . until recently it has been presumed that the extra dimensions must be compactified on the planck scale , with a compactification radius @xmath184 part of the vision of string theory",
    "is that what goes on in the small curled - up dimensions does affect the everyday world : excitations of the calabi ",
    "yau manifolds determine the fermion spectrum , for example .",
    "the great gap between the electroweak scale of about @xmath185 and the planck scale of about @xmath186 gives rise to the hierarchy problem of the electroweak theory @xcite .",
    "the conventional approach to new physics has been to extend the standard model to understand why the electroweak scale ( and the mass of the higgs boson ) is so much smaller than the planck scale .",
    "a novel approach that has evolved over the past two years is instead to _ change gravity _ to understand why the planck scale is so much greater than the electroweak scale @xcite .",
    "now , experiment tells us that gravitation closely follows the newtonian force law down to distances on the order of @xmath187 .",
    "let us parameterize deviations from a @xmath188 gravitational potential in terms of a relative strength @xmath189 and a range @xmath190 , so that @xmath191\\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath192 is the mass density of object @xmath193 and @xmath194 is the separation between body 1 and body 2 .",
    "elegant experiments that study details of casimir and van der waals forces imply bounds on anomalous gravitational interactions , as shown in figure [ fig : nonngrav ] .",
    "below about a millimeter , the constraints on deviations from newton s inverse - square force law deteriorate rapidly , so we are free to consider changes to gravity even on a small but macroscopic scale .",
    "that is precisely the possibility raised by the interesting new idea that some extra dimensions of spacetime might be  relatively speaking  large .",
    "the new idea is to consider that the @xmath195 standard - model gauge fields , plus needed extensions , reside on @xmath183-dimensional branes , not in the extra dimensions , but that gravity can propagate into the extra dimensions .",
    "how does this hypothesis change the picture ?",
    "the dimensional analysis ( gauss s law , if you like ) that relates newton s constant to the planck scale changes .",
    "if gravity propagates not only in the @xmath183 dimensions of minkowski space , but also in @xmath169 extra dimensions with radius @xmath196 , then @xmath197 where @xmath198 is gravity s true scale . the correlation between @xmath198 and the size @xmath196 of the @xmath169 large extra dimensions is given in table [ tbl : ed ] for some representative cases .    .radius",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tbl : mpp ]    if a missing - energy signal is found , it will be a challenge to distinguish an extradimensional signal from the classic @xmath196-parity  conserving signature for supersymmetry .",
    "we should be so lucky !      we are only beginning to explore the possible implications of almost - accessible extra dimensions . among the fascinating new worlds to explore are the randall  sundrum mechanism for localizing gravity in an extra dimension ( in the vicinity of a brane or domain wall ) @xcite , and the speculation of arkani - hamed and schmaltz that the fermion mass hierarchy reflects fermion wave packets separated in an extra dimension @xcite . the characteristic missing - energy signature of a kauza  klein excitation will be hard to distinguish from other new physics .",
    "we need to think in more detail about the backgrounds and optimal search techniques .",
    "the search for large extra dimensions reinforces the informative metaphor of a collider and its detectors as an ultramicroscope .",
    "are extra dimensions large enough to see ?",
    "it is also interesting to consider what might we observe above the threshold for exciting extra dimensions .",
    "although the basic concepts that underlie these speculations have a sound basis in string theory , most of the scenarios put forward so far have more to do with storytelling than with theoretical rigor . however",
    ", it is plain that our inability to disprove at once the outlandish idea of large extra dimensions is a measure of the potential for experimental surprises , and an indication of nature s capacity to amaze us !",
    "to a great degree , the progress of particle physics has followed from progress in accelerator science and instrumentation .",
    "there is no substitute for experiment , and experiment requires inventions in both hardware and software and continuous innovation in analysis .",
    "the slogan , `` yesterday s sensation is today s calibration and tomorrow s background , '' embodies both the challenge and the opportunity of advances in experimental technique .    in the middle of the revolution we are experiencing  indeed , making  in our conception of nature , when we deal with fundamental questions about our world , including    _ _ _ _",
