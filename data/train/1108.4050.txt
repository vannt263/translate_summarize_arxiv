    "as the population of known exoplanets has grown over the last decade , interest has been steadily increasing in methods and missions to observe them directly .",
    "these include both ground and space based systems .",
    "in fact , the 2010 decadal survey for astronomy and astrophysics @xcite placed a high priority on developing both the technology and mission concepts for a high - contrast planet imager that would be ready for the next decade .",
    "the goal is to be able to image earthlike planets in the habitable zones of their parent stars with a telescope from @xmath0 to @xmath1 m in diameter .",
    "many approaches to achieving the high contrast needed have been proposed , including many types of coronagraphs , pupil interferometers , and external occulters . in this paper , we present new shaped - pupil designs that increase the system throughput and can be used with on - axis and segmented telescopes , introducing the potential for dramatically simplifying the engineering of a future ground or space telescope .",
    "_ pupil apodization _ creates a high - contrast point - spread function by varying the amplitude transmission in the entrance pupil of the telescope ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , slepian @xcite found the best possible apodization in the sense that it maximally concentrates the light in the image plane toward the center leaving very high contrast outside the inner working angle .",
    "unfortunately , manufacturing aperture masks with variable transmission over broad bands with sufficient accuracy has proved formidable .",
    "instead , we have focused on binary masks that reshape the entrance pupil by either allowing or blocking transmission @xcite .    our approach to designing shaped pupils has been to maximize the transmission of the pupil subject to constraints on the field distribution in the image plane . because a linear operator ( the fourier transform ) is used to switch from one plane to the other , these optimization problems are linear programs , and can thus be solved very efficiently . however , so far , full optimizations ( i.e. without any constraints put on the pupil except for the initial transmission of the aperture ) have only been done for one - dimensional geometries .",
    "the results of these optimizations include barcode masks , checkerboard masks and concentric ring masks @xcite . in the last two cases , a square geometry and a circular symmetric geometry , respectively , were assumed so that these 1d problems resulted in 2d masks .",
    "an important observation is that each of these 1d optimizations tended toward binary distributions of amplitude in the pupil plane ; their binary aspect is not a constraint but rather is a result of the optimization .",
    "the outer working angle ( owa ) of these masks govern ( indirectly ) the number of the blocking and transmitting regions , and in the case of a large owa the width of these regions becomes smaller than the width associated with one element of resolution . in this case",
    "the apodization profile is no longer binary but rather smooth .    in this paper , we describe a new optimization approach that results directly in 2d shaped pupils with no simplifying geometric assumptions .",
    "the idea , first described in @xcite , exploits the main idea behind the fast fourier transform ( see also @xcite ) thereby allowing us to design masks for arbitrary pupil geometries , including those with central obstructions , spiders , or segmented telescopes .",
    "it also allows us to tailor the region of high contrast in the image plane to any desired shape or size .",
    "thus , for instance , we can design for dark holes that match those created by the accompanying wavefront control system .",
    "this ability often results in systems with higher transmission , smaller inner working angles ( iwa ) or higher contrast .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec1 ]",
    ", we describe the formalism for the optimizations . in section [ sec2 ] ,",
    "we present the result of the optimization for a circular unobstructed aperture .",
    "we use this example to show how the sampling of the pupil plane affects the quality of the optimization both in the pupil plane and the image plane . in section [ sec3 ]",
    ", we display various optimized circular pupil masks with a central obscuration and spiders .",
    "for example , we consider the pupil geometries of the 8 m subaru telescope and the 3 m telescope for the planned japanese space infrared telescope for cosmology and astrophysics ( spica ) .",
    "section [ sec4 ] shows that we can also optimize for a segmented mirror ; we use the pupil of the james webb space telescope ( jwst ) as an example for such masks .",
    "section [ sec5 ] discusses the possibilities offered by these optimizations , as well as their limitations .",
    "what makes these optimizations possible is a fast and accurate computation of the fourier transform ( ft ) of the pupil plane apodization .",
    "indeed , the amplitude distribution in the image plane is proportional to the fourier transform of the electric field in the pupil plane , which is the arriving electric field ( to be of constant , say unit , amplitude ) multiplied by the apodization function @xmath2 : @xmath3 here , the aperture has diameter @xmath4 along the @xmath5 and @xmath6 axes ( the aperture is therefore assumed to be contained within a @xmath7 square ) , the focal length of the instrument is @xmath8 , and @xmath9 denotes the light s wavelength .",
    "an important first step in many optical design problems is to replace quantities representing physical lengths with quantities that are unitless scalars times some natural physical scale for the problem .",
    "for example , in the pupil plane we replace @xmath5 and @xmath6 with new variables , for which we use the same notation , that measure length in units of @xmath4 ( formally , @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) .",
    "that is , @xmath12 means one diameter .",
    "similarly , in the image plane we replace the physical lengths @xmath13 and @xmath14 with values that represent radians on the sky ( formally , @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) . with this substitution ,",
    "an image plane variable @xmath13 represents a physical position of @xmath17 on the detector .",
    "it also represents an angular position of @xmath18 radians on the sky . throughout the rest of this paper we view image plane variables as measures of @xmath19 radians on the sky . making these substitutions , ( [ 1 ] ) becomes @xmath20 this two - dimensional fourier transform can be approximated using discrete sets of points in both the pupil and the image planes :    @xmath21    with @xmath22 indexed on the set @xmath23 and @xmath24 on the set @xmath25 .",
    "we will assume equal sizes along the @xmath5 and @xmath6 axes , as well as along the @xmath13 and @xmath14 axes , making @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "furthermore , we will consider a uniform partition in the @xmath28-plane , and thus @xmath29 .",
    "for the previous one - dimensional problems ( where only single fourier transforms were considered with the result extended to two dimensions by symmetry ) , the complexity of the problem was @xmath30 , where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are respectively the number of `` pixels '' in the pupil and image plane .",
    "a basic 2d ft leads to a complexity of @xmath33 ; for a typical desktop computer , the maximum value for @xmath30 is roughly 4500 , which puts serious limits on how large @xmath31 and @xmath32 can be .",
    "for example , if @xmath32 is chosen to be 30 , which is about the minimum one can get away with in the image plane , then @xmath31 can be at most 150 .",
    "consequently , the smallest detail in a pupil mask of 1 cm in diameter would have a width of @xmath34 .",
    "this is too low a resolution to produce sufficient contrast , as explained in more detail in section  [ sec2 ] .",
    "there is , however , a way to increase the resolution with which we sample the pupil plane .",
    "as described in @xcite and @xcite , the complexity can be reduced to @xmath35 if the 2d fourier transform is made in two steps , first along one axis , @xmath36 and then along the other one , using as inputs the results of the first computation in the second 1d ft , @xmath37 this two - step method dramatically improves the complexity problem by reducing the number of computations at the expense of increased memory allocation ( the intermediate matrix @xmath38 has to be stored during this process ) .    since most telescope pupils have one or two axes of symmetry , we can use this feature to work with arrays 2 or 4 times smaller .",
    "additionally , because the binary apodization is real , the exponential term in the fourier transform can be replaced with a cosine .",
    "when computing the ft this way , n can be as high as 1000 , while m can be set to 50 , and the smallest detail in the same 1 cm pupil would now have a @xmath39 length .",
    "note that , in this particular case , we gain a factor @xmath40 in efficiency over the classical , brute - force , computation of the 2d ft .",
    "the maximization of the pupil mask s throughput , subject to contrast constraints , can be formulated as a linear programming problem : maximize e(0,0 ) subject to : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the targeted contrast .",
    "the electric field in the image , @xmath43 , is subject to this constraint only in a specific discovery space ( defined in particular by an iwa and an owa ) .",
    "the apodization , @xmath44 , is also defined on a specific domain , the initial aperture shape .    in practice",
    ", the optimization problem is expressed in the ampl language @xcite and solved with r. vanderbei s loqo solver @xcite .",

    "to begin , we consider a circular unobstructed aperture .",
    "almost all coronagraphs being considered for a space mission require unobstructed apertures to achieve high contrast , and therefore necessitate complicated off - axis telescope designs .",
    "starting with such a geometry allows us to compare the new approach to previously - designed shaped pupils . in later sections ,",
    "we explore designs for more interesting pupil geometries .      in vanderbei",
    "et al.@xcite we found optimal shaped pupils for open circular apertures consisting of concentric rings by solving for the ring width and spacing along a radius .",
    "this allowed the problem to be solved in only one dimension .",
    "it is , however , interesting to compare the result of the 1d optimization to the new 2d approach . in the latter case ,",
    "the optimization produces a `` wiggly '' version of a concentric ring mask ( the wiggles result from the rather coarse discretization of the image plane ) .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the jwst pupil is particularly interesting : the internal and external hexagonal segments making up the pupil have a great effect on the contrast that can be reached . a first mask was generated for a circular ring dark hole with a minimal iwa of 5 @xmath19 .",
    "a smaller iwa ( 4 @xmath19 ) could be obtained with a similar throughput by changing the dark hole to a hexagonal ring , with internal and external contours rotated by @xmath45 with respect to each other . the resulting mask and psf",
    "is shown in figure  [ jwst ] .",
    "several other geometric aspects still remain to be tested .",
    "previous two - dimensional shaped - pupil optimizations all assumed specific geometries in order to reformulate the 2d problem as a 1d mathematical description that could then be solved .",
    "we have shown in this paper that full optimizations of pupil masks in two dimensions are possible . no constraint other than the initial geometry of the aperture",
    "are placed on the pupil .",
    "this allows us to find new , and more optimal , solutions to a variety of high contrast problems .",
    "we have in particular compared composite barcode masks designed for the spica coronagraph and for the subaru telescope to new , fully optimized 2d masks .",
    "given the same discovery zones ( same contrasts , iwa and owa ) , higher throughputs can always be expected .",
    "more importantly , these throughputs are simply the highest possible .",
    "complex pupil geometries can be treated without much more efforts than basic geometries .",
    "masks optimized for the jwst illustrate particularly well the possibilities that full 2d optimizations offer . despite the central obstruction , the spiders and the inter - segments gaps , optimal mask solutions are found .",
    "another very important observation is that the result of the optimization always tends to be a binary mask , and that , given a sufficiently high enough number of points used to sample the pupil plane , it virtually is .",
    "this had already been observed when optimizing 1d masks , but the optimization of ripple masks and star shaped masks assumed a binary amplitude distribution .",
    "one can argue that these optimizations are constrained by the choice of the high contrast regions . in the basic case of a circular symmetric pupil , without central obstruction and spiders ,",
    "many types of dark holes can be considered ( circular symmetric rings , portions of rings , rectangular areas , etc . ) , but the particularities of pupils with more complex features must be taken into account when designing the dark holes .",
    "for example , the small size of spiders leads to diffraction effects on a large scale , and the geometry of the spiders must be used to design the dark holes .",
    "a system of 4 spiders set in an orthogonal fashion will create diffraction spikes in a similar orthogonal fashion .",
    "one can then choose to move the diffracted energy along only one axis , so as to obtain a good contrast on the other , or one can also choose to maximize the contrast in the 4 quadrants of the image plane by concentrating the diffracted energy along both axes .",
    "many coronagraphs are meant to be used with telescopes without central obstructions .",
    "optical devices can be used to artificially remove the spiders and/or the central obstruction .",
    "masks could be designed , not to aim for high contrasts , but to attenuate the diffraction spikes .",
    "the advantage of choosing this solution would be a better achromaticity and little to no additional aberrations introduced in the wavefront .",
    "this will be explored in a future paper .",
    "the masks that are presented here are all binary , but none of them is fully structurally connected , in contrast to bar code masks , star shaped masks , or shaped pupils .",
    "this makes it mandatory for them to be laid on glass or mirrors .",
    "additional amplitude and phase aberrations will thus be introduced on the wavefront , and will have to be taken into account in the design of the wavefront correction system .",
    "checkerboard masks are also not structurally connected , and some were manufactured for the spica project using e - beam lithography of aluminum coated bk7 glass substrates .",
    "masks designed for @xmath46 were tested in the laboratory , and contrasts smaller than @xmath47 were achieved in laser light @xcite .",
    "more recent experiments were conducted in broadband , and in a vacuum chamber ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this time the contrast was limited by ghosts and ranged from @xmath48 for a central wavelength @xmath49 = 650 nm ( @xmath50 = 8 nm ) to @xmath51 for @xmath49 = 850 nm ( @xmath50 = 55 nm ) . in both experiments the wavefront was not actively corrected .",
    "we intend in the near future to have some masks manufactured in a similar fashion , and use them in our high contrast imaging laboratory in princeton , together with our 2 dm wavefront correction system",
