    "there have been several experiments @xcite which suggest neutrino oscillations .",
    "it has been shown in the two flavor framework that the solar neutrino deficit can be explained by neutrino oscillation with the set of parameters @xmath13 @xmath14 ( small angle msw solution ) , @xmath15 ( large angle msw solution ) , or @xmath16 ( vacuum oscillation solution ) , and the atmospheric neutrino anomaly can be accounted for by @xmath17 .    in the three flavor framework",
    "there are two independent mass squared differences and it is usually assumed that these two mass differences correspond to @xmath18 and @xmath19 . throughout this paper we will assume three neutrino species which can account for only the solar neutrino deficit and the atmospheric neutrino anomaly . without loss of generality",
    "we assume @xmath20 where @xmath21 .",
    "the flavor eigenstates are related to the mass eigenstates by @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) , where @xmath22 are the elements of the mns mixing matrix u @xcite : @xmath24 with the mass hierarchy @xmath25 there are two possible mass patterns which are depicted in fig . 1a and 1b , depending on whether @xmath26 is positive or negative .",
    "if the matter effect is relevant then the sign of @xmath26 can be determined by distinguishing neutrinos and anti - neutrinos .",
    "the superkamiokande experiment uses water cherenkov detectors and events of neutrinos and anti - neutrinos are unfortunately indistinguishable , so the sign of @xmath26 is unknown to date .",
    "it has been shown in the three flavor framework @xcite of the chooz reactor data @xcite and the atmospheric neutrino data implies very small @xmath4 , i.e. , @xmath27 which is essentially the result of the chooz data . when @xmath28 is small , the mns matrix looks like @xmath29 where @xmath30 , @xmath31 have been replaced by @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively .",
    "measurements of @xmath4 and even cp phase @xmath1 may be possible in the near future projects @xcite .",
    "neutrino factories @xcite have been proposed to measure @xmath4 , the sign of @xmath26 and cp phase @xmath1 , and a lot of people have worked out many aspects in detail @xcite .    since measurement of cp violation is the main motivation for neutrino factories , it is important to examine errors of the cp phase @xmath1 taking into consideration all possible sources of uncertainties in the oscillation parameters as well as matter effects . in this paper",
    "we discuss correlations of errors of @xmath1 and the matter effect , as well as @xmath34 and @xmath35 . and",
    "other oscillation parameters have been discussed in the past @xcite , but they used relatively optimistic sets of the oscillation parameters , and the behaviors we obtain with the most up to date best fit values for the oscillation parameters are sometimes different from theirs . ]",
    "we find that the correlation of @xmath1 and the matter effect is strong for ( @xmath36=50 gev , @xmath373000 km ) , which has been advocated as the best choice , and if the uncertainty of the matter effect is larger than 5 % then baselines shorter than 3000 km are advantageous",
    ".    there have been works @xcite which advocated the advantage of conventional low energy neutrino beams over neutrino factories with high energy , and there does not seem to be consensus among the community of neutrino physicists about the optimum neutrino energy and the baseline .",
    "one of the purposes of this paper is to show that neutrino factories with high or medium muon energy ( 20gev@xmath550gev ) are more advantageous over experiments with low energy ( @xmath910gev ) .",
    "we evaluate the statistical significance of possible cp violation in neutrino factory type experiments for a range of the muon energy 0.5gev@xmath3850gev and the baseline 10 km @xmath39 10@xmath40 km and we show that the case @xmath7 a few gev is always inferior to the option with higher energy . on the other hand ,",
    "lipari @xcite has shown that long baseline experiments lose the sensitivity for cp violation for extremely high energy .",
    "we will show analytically that the two kinds of @xmath0 that we will use , one of which is defined through the difference of @xmath11 and @xmath2 and the other of which through t violation , decrease for large muon energy @xmath1050gev .",
    "we also analyze the possibility to measure cp violation at the upgraded jhf experiment with 4mw power and a one mega ton detector .",
    "we show that measurement of cp violation is possible for a relatively large value of @xmath4 .",
    "it is possible mainly because the detector size is so huge .    in section 2",
    "we analyze numerically the effect of the cp phase @xmath1 in neutrino factories by introducing @xmath0 which is defined as the square of the difference of the number of events with @xmath11 and that with @xmath2 , divided by errors .",
    "we show that the optimal muon energy and baseline vary depending on the magnitude of @xmath4 , the background fraction and the uncertainty of the matter effect . in section 3",
    "we discuss t violation assuming ideal polarization . in section 4",
    "we present analytical treatments of the two kinds of @xmath0 introduced in sections 2 and 3 , and show that these @xmath0 decrease as the muon energy becomes very small or very large . in section 5",
    "we discuss the possibility of measurement of cp violation at the upgraded jhf experiment . in section 6",

    "the threshold energy is assumed to be 0.1gev which is close to what has been assumed for liquid argon detectors @xcite and which may be realized in possible mega ton water cherenkov detectors @xcite .",
    "the number of the free parameters in the present case is six ( @xmath1 , @xmath30 , @xmath4 , @xmath31 , @xmath53 , @xmath53 ) , but the density @xmath54 of electrons is not known exactly ( @xmath55 is the ratio of the number of electrons to that of protons and neutrons , and @xmath56 is the density of the earth at a distance @xmath57 from the beam production point ) , so we have to vary @xmath58 also . here for simplicity we assume the prem ( preliminary reference earth model ) @xcite and vary the overall normalization of the prem : @xmath59 where @xmath60 corresponds to the prem .",
    "we have to consider correlations of errors of the cp phase and six other quantities and taking into account all these errors we obtain the probability of rejecting a hypothesis @xmath61 . to do that we look for the minimum value of @xmath62 by varying the six parameters ( @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 ) :    @xmath69    where @xmath70 stands for the overall normalization of the electron density .",
    "let us first discuss correlations of two variables ( @xmath45 , @xmath71 ) where a parameter @xmath72 stands for @xmath70 , @xmath4 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath53 and @xmath73 .",
    "we have studied numerically correlations of errors between @xmath1 and the other oscillation parameters ( @xmath34 , @xmath35 ) as well as the normalization @xmath70 of the matter effect for the case where the central values for these parameters are those of the best fit point , i.e. , @xmath74 , @xmath75 ; @xmath76 , @xmath77 , c=1.0 and we have used a reference value @xmath78 .",
    "the values of @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 are plotted in fig . 1  6 in the case of @xmath85 for @xmath36=3 , 20 , 50 gev , @xmath49=100 km , 1000 km , 2500 km , 6300 km , where the data size 10@xmath8610kt is used as a reference value and no backgrounds are assumed .",
    "since the number of degrees of freedom is 2 , @xmath87=0.18 , 0.34 , 0.73 correspond to 1@xmath3 , 90% , 99% confidence level to reject a hypothesis with @xmath61 .",
    "as can be seen in fig .",
    "1 , the correlation ( @xmath45 , @xmath68 ) for @xmath883000 km is strong for @xmath89 . the correlation ( @xmath45 , @xmath68 ) turns out to be small for larger values of @xmath53 or for smaller value of @xmath4 ( i.e. , @xmath90",
    "; see fig .",
    "1b ) , as the gradient of the ellipse in the ( @xmath45 , @xmath68 ) plane becomes smaller for larger values of @xmath53 .",
    "this is why strong correlations were not found in @xcite where the set of parameters ( @xmath91 , @xmath92 ; @xmath76 , @xmath93 ) and @xmath94 , @xmath95gev were used .",
    "if we assume that the uncertainty in the overall normalization @xmath70 is at most 5% , then the correlation ( @xmath45 , @xmath68 ) is not so serious , but if we assume that the uncertainty is as large as 20 % then the set of the parameters ( @xmath96 50gev , @xmath88 3000 km ) is not a good option .",
    "we will discuss this issue later .    from figs . 2  6",
    ", we see that the correlations of ( @xmath45 , @xmath97 ) and ( @xmath45 , @xmath98 ) are not large for @xmath991000 km , @xmath10020gev .",
    "as we will show analytically later , the value of @xmath101 increases for @xmath10 50gev and @xmath102 1000 km unless we minimize it with respect to @xmath34 and @xmath35 , but because of strong correlations in ( @xmath45 , @xmath64 ) , ( @xmath45 , @xmath65 ) and ( @xmath45 , @xmath67 ) , the value of @xmath103 , which is minimized with respect to @xmath34 and @xmath35 , decreases for @xmath10 50gev .",
    "the quantity @xmath104 can be regarded as the deviation of @xmath105 from the best fit point ( the best fit point in eq . ( [ eqn : delchi2 ] ) is of course @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 for which we have @xmath110 ) and for six degrees of freedom the value of @xmath111 which corresponds to @xmath112 ( @xmath113 ) is 20.1 ( 28.9 ) . from this we can estimate the necessary data size @xmath114 to reject a hypothesis @xmath61 at @xmath112 by dividing 20.1 by @xmath104 for each value of @xmath1 . on the other hand , it is important to include the effect of the backgrounds in the analysis @xcite .",
    "here we assume that the fraction @xmath115 of backgrounds to right sign muon events is given by @xmath116 or @xmath117 and that the systematic error of backgrounds is @xmath118 as in @xcite for simplicity .",
    "we also assume the number of muons @xmath119kt as a reference value .",

    "then we minimize @xmath0 with respect @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath68 : @xmath126 where the values of oscillation parameters we use in ( [ eqn : chicpv ] ) are the best fit values in the analyses of the solar and atmospheric neutrinos @xcite as in figs . 1  6 , and we take @xmath4= @xmath127 , @xmath128 , @xmath78 and @xmath85 as a reference value . in varying the overall normalization @xmath70",
    "we assume @xmath129 .",
    "we will mention the results for @xmath130 and for @xmath131 later . for other oscillation parameters ,",
    "we vary ( @xmath30 , @xmath53 ) and ( @xmath31 , @xmath73 ) within the allowed region at 90%cl of the solar and the atmospheric neutrino data , i.e. , @xmath132 , @xmath133 , @xmath134 , @xmath135 .",
    "it should be emphasized that in minimizing @xmath0 in ( [ eqn : chicpv ] ) all the six parameters are varied at the same time , unlike in figs . 1  6 which are obtained by varying only one of @xmath97 , @xmath136 , @xmath68 .",
    "the result is given in fig .",
    "7 for a neutrino factory with 0.5gev @xmath38 50gev , 10 km @xmath39 10000 km and for three values of @xmath4= @xmath127 , @xmath128 , @xmath78 and two different values of the background fraction @xmath137 , @xmath138 .",
    "the behavior of the figures change a little depending on the value of @xmath4 . for @xmath116 , the sensitivity to cp violation , i.e.",

    "_ optimized by the set of parameters @xmath139 ( 50gev , 3000 km ) , which has been advocated as the best choice , but rather by @xmath139 ( 20gev , 2000 km ) .",
    "this is because with a nonnegligible fraction @xmath115 the contribution of the systematic uncertainty @xmath140 to the total error becomes so large for high energy such as @xmath96 50gev and sensitivity to cp violation is lost . for @xmath137 and @xmath4= @xmath127 , on the other hand , the contribution of @xmath140 is not so large and the sensitivity is optimized by @xmath139 ( 50gev , 3000 km ) .",
    "we note in passing that we have also optimized the sensitivity with respect to the number of energy bins but the conclusion does not depend very much on the number of energy bins .",
    "this result disagrees with the claim in @xcite .",
    "we have also evaluated the data size assuming a larger uncertainty of the matter effect , i.e. , @xmath130 and @xmath141 .",
    "the results for @xmath142 are shown in fig .",
    "if we have to assume an uncertainty of the matter effect which is as large as 20% , then the optimum baseline and muon energy become even smaller than the results with @xmath143 .",
    "the situation is less serious for smaller value of @xmath4 , i.e. , @xmath90 , for which the correlation ( @xmath45 , @xmath68 ) is not so strong .",
    "it should be noted that we have assumed in our analysis that the detection efficiency does not decrease down to the neutrino energy @xmath144 a few gev , so if this assumption is not satisfied then the optimum muon energy may not be as low as fig .",
    "8 indicates .    in figs . 7 and 8",
    "we have taken @xmath85 as a reference value .",
    "it is possible to do the same analysis for a value of @xmath1 other than @xmath145 .",

    "we observe that ( @xmath36=50gev , @xmath49=3000 km ) is better than ( @xmath36=20gev , @xmath49=1000 km ) for smaller values of @xmath4 , but for larger values of @xmath4 ( @xmath36=20gev , @xmath49=1000 km ) can be more advantageous than the other .",
    "it should be emphasized that in all cases in fig .",
    "9 we can distinguish the case of @xmath146 from that of @xmath2 , since the necessary data size to reject @xmath2 is finite even for @xmath146 .",
    "this is because there are both contributions from @xmath147 and @xmath148 for the muon energy @xmath750 gev .",
    "as we will see in section 4 , for extremely high energy @xmath1050 gev we can show analytically that our @xmath0(cpv ) becomes proportional to @xmath149 and distinction between @xmath146 and @xmath2 is no longer possible .",
    "sato et al .",
    "@xcite have been emphasizing the importance of the low energy option ( @xmath7 1gev ) , since the shape of sine curves in the cp violating probabilities becomes more conspicuous for low energies . as can be seen from fig .",
    "7 , the data set which is require to reject a hypothesis @xmath61 is much larger than the value for the high energy case .",
    "this is because the small boost factor @xmath150 means that the number of events is statistically insufficient even though the cp conserving probabilities become relatively large in this case .",
    "furthermore , in obtaining fig . 7",
    ", we have assumed that the detection efficiency does not change for low energy . in reality , however , it becomes more and more difficult to distinguish wrong sign muons from right sign ones at lower energy so that the background fraction is expected to increase as @xmath151 small .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the low energy option offers no advantage over the high energy region as long as we have the same detector size .",
    "sato et al .",
    "@xcite gave another criticism that neutrino factories at high energy are looking at only terms which are proportional to @xmath148 .",
    "however , as we will see in section 4 , we can show analytically in the high energy limit that our @xmath0(cpv ) , when minimized with respect to one of the oscillation parameters , is proportional to the square @xmath152 of the jarlskog factor and has the same behavior @xmath153 as @xmath0 in the case of t violation .",
    "therefore a naive argument that the square of difference of the quantity at @xmath1 and the one at @xmath2 must depend only on @xmath148 does not necessarily apply .",

    "we have evaluated numerically the data size required to reject a hypothesis with @xmath61 .",

    "in order to be more concrete , we need the knowledge on the uncertainty of the matter effect @xmath274 .",
    "the error of @xmath275 comes from those of @xmath276 and @xmath277 .",
    "the error of @xmath276 has been discussed by @xcite and it is about 2% and geophysicists @xcite agree with it . without any uncertainty of the matter effect , it has been claimed that a medium baseline experiment ( @xmath278 km , @xmath96 50gev ) is best for measurements of cp violation . in that case",
    "the depth of the neutrino path is at most 200 km and most of the neutrino path is in the upper mantle .",
    "it is known in geophysics @xcite that the crust has relatively large latitude - longitude dependent fluctuations around constant density . on the other hand , in the case of the upper mantle , some geophysicists claim that fluctuations around constant density are a few % @xcite while another @xcite says that they may be as large as 5 % .",
    "however , such discussions are based on normal mode studies in seismology which are confined to long wavelength features , and it was pointed out @xcite that the fluctuations in the density in the analysis of neutrino factories may be larger than 5 % , since the width of the neutrino beam is much smaller than typical wavelengths in seismological studies . if that is the case , then it follows from fig . 8",
    "that the case @xmath371000 km is better than the case @xmath373000 km , since the former is insensitive to the uncertainty of the matter effect .",
    "more detailed analysis with seismological discussions seems to be necessary to determine the optimal baseline and the muon energy in neutrino factories .",
    "we have also seen that if there is a nontrivial fraction of backgrounds , which is expected in the case of water cherenkov or liquid argon detectors , then medium energy ( 10gev @xmath5 20gev ) is more advantageous than high energy ( @xmath96 50gev ) , as systematic errors become so large in the latter case .",
    "the bottom line of the present paper is that either the high or medium energy option is certainly better than the low energy option which has been advocated by some people @xcite .",
    "we have arrived at this conclusion on the assumption that the energy threshold is as low as 0.1 gev , and the detection efficiency is independent of the neutrino energy . in practice , it may be very difficult to have such a low threshold and to keep such a good detection efficiency down to 0.1 gev , so it is expected that the low energy option ( @xmath279 10gev ) becomes less and less advantageous .",
    "if we can realize a nearly perfectly polarized muon beam , it may be possible to measure t violation , which is much better than cp violation , since we do not have to worry about the uncertainty of the density of the earth or other oscillation parameters and a nonzero value of t violation immediately indicates @xmath11 .",
    "efforts should be made along these lines .",
    "if @xmath12 and if the value of @xmath1 is not close to 0 or @xmath266 , then the jhf experiment with 4mw power and a 1 mega ton detector will be able to demonstrate @xmath11 at 3@xmath3cl . on the other hand , if @xmath90 , then neutrino factories seem to be the only experiment which can demonstrate @xmath11 . in that case , depending on the situation such as the fraction of backgrounds , the uncertainty of the matter effect and the magnitude of @xmath4 , the option with ( @xmath25950gev , @xmath373000 km ) may be advantageous ( or disadvantageous ) over ( @xmath25920gev , @xmath371000 km ) . in both a neutrino factory with ( 20gev@xmath550gev , 1000km@xmath63000 km ) and the jhf experiment , our @xmath0(cpv )",

    "] so that we can in principle distinguish @xmath146 from @xmath2 as long as the statistical significance overcomes the systematic errors .",

    "<S> the optimum muon energy and the baseline depends on the magnitude of @xmath4 , the background fraction , the uncertainty of the normalization of the matter effect , but in general lie in the ranges 20gev @xmath5 50gev , 1000km@xmath63000 km . if we assume that the uncertainty of the matter effect is as large as 20% then the optimum values may be modified to @xmath7 10gev , @xmath81000 km due to the strong correlation of @xmath1 and the matter effect . </S>",
    "<S> we show analytically that sensitivity to cp violation is lost for @xmath9 10gev or for @xmath10 50gev . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss the possibility of measuring cp violation at the upgraded jhf experiment by taking all the error correlations into account , and show that it is possible to demonstrate @xmath11 at 3@xmath3cl for @xmath12 .    0.1 cm </S>"
