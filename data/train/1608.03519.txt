    "does there exist a finite colouring @xmath2 relative to which @xmath3 does not admit a @xmath4-monochromatic factorisation , i.e. , a factorisation of the form @xmath5 with @xmath6 for all @xmath7 ?    a finite colouring @xmath2 is called a _ separating colouring _ for @xmath3 ( or a separating @xmath30-colouring for @xmath31 if for all factorisations @xmath5 there exist @xmath7 such that @xmath32 while t. brown originally stated it as a question , question  [ conj ] has evolved into a conjecture which states that every non - periodic word admits a separating colouring .",
    "we begin by illustrating question  [ conj ] with an example : consider the _ thue - morse _ infinite word @xmath33 where the @xmath34th term of @xmath3 ( starting from @xmath35 is defined as the sum modulo @xmath9 of the digits in the binary expansion of @xmath36 the origins of this word go back to the beginning of the last century with the works of a. thue @xcite in which he proves amongst other things that @xmath3 is _ overlap - free _ i.e. , @xmath3 contains no factor of the form @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a non - empty prefix of @xmath39    consider the @xmath40 colouring @xmath41 defined by @xmath42 we claim that no factorisation of @xmath3 is @xmath43-monochromatic .",
    "in fact , suppose to the contrary that @xmath5 is a @xmath43-monochromatic factorisation of @xmath44 since @xmath45 is a prefix of @xmath3 , it follows that @xmath46 i.e. , there exists @xmath47 such that each @xmath48 is a prefix of @xmath3 terminating with @xmath49 pick @xmath50 such that @xmath51 then as each @xmath48 is a prefix of @xmath52 it follows that @xmath48 is a prefix of @xmath53and hence @xmath54 is a factor of @xmath44 writing @xmath55 ( with @xmath56 empty or in @xmath57 we have @xmath58 which is an overlap , contradicting that @xmath3 is overlap - free .",
    "this proves that there exists a separating @xmath40-colouring for the thue - morse word .",
    "recently s. avgustinovich and o. parshina  @xcite proved that it is possible to colour @xmath59 using only @xmath9 colours in such a way that no factorisation of the thue - morse word is monochromatic .",
    "let us remark in the example above that since the thue - morse word @xmath3 is not periodic , it follows that each proper suffix @xmath60 of @xmath3 begins in some factor @xmath61 which is not a prefix of @xmath44 this means that @xmath60 may be written as an infinite concatenation @xmath62 where @xmath63 for all @xmath64 so while @xmath3 itself does not admit a @xmath4-monochromatic factorisation , where @xmath4 is the @xmath40-colouring of @xmath59 defined above , it turns out that every proper suffix of @xmath3 does admit a @xmath4-monochromatic factorisation .",
    "moreover , this monochromatic factorisation of @xmath60 has an even stronger monochromatic property : the set @xmath65 is @xmath4-monochromatic ( each element has @xmath4 colour equal to @xmath66 this is because each element of @xmath67 is a non - prefix of @xmath3 and hence the same is true of any concatenation formed by elements from this set .",
    "it turns out that a weaker version of this phenomenon is true in greater generality : given any @xmath68 and any finite colouring @xmath69 one can always find a suffix @xmath60 of @xmath3 which admits a factorisation @xmath62 where @xmath70 for all @xmath71 this fact may be obtained via a straightforward application of the infinite ramsey theorem @xcite ( see @xcite or see @xcite for a proof by m. p. schtzenberger which does not use ramsey s theorem ) .",
    "thus question  [ conj ] belongs to the class of ramsey type problems in which one tries to show that some abstract form of ramsey s theorem does not hold in certain settings .",
    "for instance , the infinite version of ramsey s theorem @xcite ( for colouring of pairs ) states that whenever the set @xmath72 of all @xmath9-element subsets of @xmath73 is finitely coloured , there exists an infinite set @xmath74 with @xmath75 monochromatic .",
    "hence the same applies when @xmath73 is replaced by @xmath76 on the other hand , w. sierpiski @xcite showed that there exists a finite colouring of @xmath77 such that there does not exist an uncountable set @xmath78 with @xmath75 monochromatic .",
    "in other words , ramsey s theorem does not extend to the uncountable setting in @xmath76 similarly , by a straightforward application of ramsey s theorem , one deduces that given any finite colouring of @xmath79 there exists an infinite @xmath74 all of whose pairwise sums @xmath80 is monochromatic .",
    "again it follows the same is true with @xmath73 replaced by @xmath76 on the other hand , n. hindman , i. leader and d. strauss @xcite recently exhibited ( using the continuum hypothesis ch ) the existence of a finite colouring of @xmath81 such that there does not exist an uncountable set with all its pairwise sums monochromatic .",
    "in other words , this additive formulation of ramsey s theorem also fails in the uncountable setting in @xmath76 a related question in these sorts of problems concerns the least number of colours necessary to avoid the presence of monochromatic subsets of a certain kind .",
    "for instance n. hindman @xcite showed that there exists a @xmath40-colouring of @xmath73 such that there does not exist an infinite subset @xmath78 with @xmath82 monochromatic , and it is an open question of owings @xcite whether the same result may be obtained with only @xmath9 colours .",
    "again , using ch and a few more colours ( @xmath83 to be precise ) , it is possible to extend hindman s result to the reals ( see theorem 2.8 in @xcite ) .",
    "but again it is not known whether the same result can be obtained with only @xmath9 colours  @xcite .",
    "thus a stronger version of question  [ conj ] would read : does every non - periodic word admit a separating @xmath9-colouring ?    various partial results in support of an affirmative answer to question  [ conj ] were obtained in @xcite . for instance , in @xcite , it is shown that question  [ conj ] admits an affirmative answer for all non - uniformly recurrent words and various classes of uniformly recurrent words including sturmian words . in @xcite , v. salo and i. trm",
    "prove that for every aperiodic linearly recurrent word @xmath27 there exists a finite colouring of @xmath14 relative to which @xmath3 does not admit a monochromatic factorisation into factors of increasing lengths . and",
    "recently a. bernardino , r. pacheco and m. silva @xcite prove that question  [ conj ] admits an affirmative answer for all fixed points of primitive strongly recognizable substitutions .",
    "in addition to the fact that these partial results concern only restricted classes of non - periodic words ( e.g. , sturmian words or certain fixed points of primitive substitutions ) , in most cases the number of colours required to colour @xmath14 in order to avoid a monochromatic factorisation of @xmath3 is found to be quite high .",
    "for instance in @xcite , the authors prove that if @xmath27 is an aperiodic linearly recurrent word , then there exists a constant @xmath84 and a colouring @xmath2 with @xmath85 such that no factorisation of @xmath86 verifying the additional constraint that @xmath87 for each @xmath88 is @xmath4-monochromatic .",
    "the constant @xmath89 above is chosen such that for every factor @xmath61 of @xmath52 every first return @xmath90 to @xmath61 satisfies @xmath91 ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "a similar large bound depending on the recognizability index of a substitution is obtained in @xcite in the context of fixed points of strongly recognizable substitutions .",
    "in contrast , it is shown in @xcite that every sturmian word admits a separating @xmath40-colouring .    in this paper",
    "we give a complete and optimal affirmative answer to question  [ conj ] by showing that for every non - periodic word @xmath92 there exists a @xmath9-colouring @xmath10 relative to which no factorisation of @xmath3 is @xmath4-monochromatic .",
    "moreover , this is a characterization of periodicity of infinite words :    [ m ] let @xmath93 be an infinite word .",
    "then @xmath3 is periodic if and only if for every @xmath9-colouring @xmath10 there exists a @xmath4-monochromatic factorisation of @xmath52 i.e. , a factorisation @xmath5 such that @xmath6 for all @xmath94    theorem  [ m ] has several nice immediate consequences : for instance , fix a symbol @xmath95 and suppose an infinite word @xmath27 admits a factorisation @xmath5 where each @xmath48 is a prefix of @xmath3 rich in the symbol @xmath96 meaning that for each @xmath97 and for each factor @xmath56 of @xmath3 with @xmath98 we have @xmath99 where @xmath100 denotes the frequency of @xmath101 in @xmath102 then @xmath103 is a finite union of arithmetic progressions . as another application of theorem  [ m ] we show that if @xmath104 ( with @xmath105 a positive integer ) , then any @xmath27 belonging to @xmath106 is periodic .",
    "theorem  [ m ] may be reformulated in the language of ultrafilters as follows : let @xmath13 denote the stone - ech compactification of the discrete semigroup @xmath14 which we regard as the set of all ultrafilters on @xmath14 , identifying the points of @xmath14 with the principal ultrafilters .",
    "as is well known , the operation of concatenation on @xmath14 extends uniquely to @xmath13 making @xmath13 a compact right topological semigroup with @xmath14 contained in its topological center ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "in particular by the ellis - numakura lemma , @xmath107 contains an idempotent element i.e. , an element @xmath21 verifying @xmath108 we show that an infinite word @xmath93 is periodic if and only if there exists @xmath17 such that for each @xmath18 there exists a factorisation @xmath19 with each @xmath20 moreover @xmath21 can be taken to be an idempotent element of @xmath22",
    "before embarking on the proof of theorem  [ m ] , we introduce some notation which will be relevant in what follows .",
    "let @xmath16 be a non - empty set ( the _ alphabet _ ) .",
    "we do not assume that the cardinality of @xmath16 is finite .",
    "let @xmath109 denote the set of all finite words @xmath110 with @xmath111 .",
