    "the number of rigorous studies into a quantised , free electromagnetic field system propagating in a globally hyperbolic spacetime is fairly small and unfortunately these studies have been plagued by problems , or limitations , which are related to the topological properties of the background spacetime .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to give a new presentation which overcomes these shortcomings and which fully clarifies all the topological properties of the theory . in this introduction",
    "we will briefly describe the geometric point of view that will be expounded in the remainder of our paper and we will indicate the problems that previous investigations encountered and how they will be overcome .",
    "historically , electromagnetism was described by a field strength @xmath7 in minkowski spacetime , which is a two - form that contains both the electric field strength @xmath8 and the magnetic field strength @xmath9 .",
    "the maxwell equations for @xmath7 entail that it is closed , @xmath10 , and as the topology of minkowski spacetime is trivial we may always write @xmath11 , where @xmath0 is the so - called vector potential . instead of using @xmath7 as a fundamental object , one may use gauge equivalence classes of vector potentials @xmath0 , where two vector potentials are identified when they give rise to the same field strength @xmath7 .",
    "this means that they differ by a closed , or , equivalently , an exact , one - form in minkowski spacetime .",
    "( see @xcite for a description of electromagnetism in minkowski spacetime from the perspective of algebraic quantum field theory . )",
    "when generalising the theory to more general spacetimes one encounters several topological obstructions .",
    "firstly , not every closed two - form @xmath7 is exact , so there may not always be a vector potential . secondly , two vector potentials that give rise to the same field strength differ by a closed one - form , but this one - form may not be exact , so the choice of gauge equivalence relation to be used becomes relevant .",
    "this raises the question which of the three equivalent formulations of electromagnetism in minkowski spacetime leads to the correct generalisation in curved spacetimes : the theory based on @xmath7 , or a theory based on @xmath0 with either choice of gauge equivalence .    in this paper",
    "we will identify connections on a trivial principal @xmath3-bundle over a spacetime @xmath2 with vector potential one - forms @xmath0 . using general covariance",
    "this naturally leads to a gauge equivalence relation that identifies vector potentials that differ by an exact one - form .- bundle , the associated bundle of connections is an affine bundle modeled on the space of one - forms on the base manifold @xcite . ]",
    "this point of view , which essentially coincides with that taken in the standard model of elementary particles , has emerged in the course of time and incorporates the well - known aharonov - bohm effect @xcite . in order to treat this effect most clearly",
    ", we will include in our description an electromagnetic current , @xmath1 , which is regarded as a given background structure .",
    "the choice of gauge equivalence that we employ can then be motivated by the following physical considerations .",
    "using the aharonov - bohm effect , which is experimentally established @xcite , we can distinguish vector potentials that differ by a closed one - form which is not exact .",
    "this means that the field strength @xmath7 itself does not contain enough information to account for all physical effects and also that a gauge equivalence on @xmath0 using closed forms , rather than exact ones , is too crude .    a few early studies in the quantisation of free electromagnetism focussed on some particular ( curved ) spacetimes and used methods that are ill - suited for a generally covariant approach .",
    "@xcite noticed that in kruskal spacetime there are many inequivalent hilbert space representations for free electromagnetism , which are labeled by magnetic and electric charges , when the field strength @xmath7 is taken as the basic object . the existence of inequivalent representations is a circumstance which is now known to hold even for free scalar fields in general curved spacetimes and which is treated in the modern literature by separating the construction of the abstract algebra of observables and its representation . in @xcite the usual weyl quantisation in minkowski spacetime",
    "is compared to an interesting proposal for quantising the holonomies of the electric field together with the magnetic field .",
    "the two approaches are found to be inequivalent , but the holonomy based approach seems to make essential use of the choice of a cauchy surface , which makes it doubtful that the approach can be made generally covariant .",
    "we will follow the direction set out in the more recent literature , starting with @xcite , that uses an algebraic approach based on the weyl algebra , because it is the most obvious way forward towards a generally covariant theory .",
    "some of the recent quantisations of free electromagnetism in curved spacetimes were inadequate for describing the aharonov - bohm effect ( @xcite and @xcite appendix a ) : they either took the field strength as its basic object or they identified two vector potentials that differ by a closed one - form .",
    "other investigations run into problems in the quantisation procedure .",
    "although the well - posedness of the classical maxwell equations was not in doubt ( see e.g.  @xcite for @xmath4-form fields ) , @xcite only carry out the quantisation in spacetimes with a compact cauchy surface ( and @xcite additionally assumes the triviality of a certain de rham cohomology group ) .",
    "the reason appears to be that they want to equip the space of spacelike compact solutions with a non - degenerate symplectic form .",
    "this symplectic form gives rise to a poisson space of observables , which is quantised @xcite using ( infinitesimal ) weyl algebras .",
    "@xcite follows a similar path , but without imposing topological restrictions .",
    "although this quantisation procedure is successful on any spacetime , it does not behave well under embeddings ( cf .",
    "remark [ rem_wrongq ] ) . alternatively , @xcite consider general spacetimes and define a ( degenerate )",
    "pre - symplectic space , which is quantised directly ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this can lead to algebras with a non - trivial centre , depending on the topology of the underlying spacetime , which entails that the theory is not locally covariant in the sense of @xcite .",
    "indeed , when a spacetime with non - trivial cohomology is embedded into minkowski spacetime , this can lead to algebraic embeddings which vanish on the non - trivial centre .",
    "although the lack of injectivity was completely characterised in these papers , its interpretation remained to be understood .",
    ".the geometric interpretation of ( classical ) phase space , using a lagrangian approach and ignoring issues of infinite dimensional topology .",
    "the compact supports arise from a duality .",
    "note that in systems without gauge symmetry there is an injection @xmath12 , whose range consists of spatially compact solutions .",
    "one may then interpret the peierls bracket as a ( densely defined ) symplectic form on @xmath13 . in the presence of gauge symmetries , however , @xmath14 may fail to be injective ( see remark [ rem_wrongq ] below ) and the quantisation schemes based on symplectic and poisson structures are no longer equivalent .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     our presentation differs case or investigate its interpretation in this setting .",
    "in fact , it only discusses these issues in its appendix a , where an alternative quantisation scheme is used . ] by using peierls method @xcite to directly find a poisson structure on the space of observables , bypassing the need for a symplectic form .",
    "this procedure fits in a general geometric framework for lagrangian field theories @xcite , whose most salient aspects are indicated in table [ tab_geo ] , and the resulting affine poisson space may be quantised using ideas from deformation quantisation , in particular fedosov s quantisation method ( cf .",
    "whereas the two approaches are equivalent for the scalar field , where a non - degenerate symplectic form always exists , this is no longer the case for electromagnetism , due to the gauge symmetry . in order to obtain an equivalent formulation in terms of the space of classical spacelike compact solutions",
    ", one would have to modify the gauge equivalence of those solutions in a subtle , but very relevant , way .",
    "( this modification was also noted , but not explained , by @xcite in the case of linearised gravity ( see also @xcite ) . for spacetimes with compact cauchy surfaces",
    "the two approaches are equivalent . )    carefully computing the poisson structure by the standard procedure ( peierls method ) , we find a different space of degeneracies than @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we show that there is a perfectly satisfactory explanation for these degeneracies in the form of gauss law . in particular",
    ", the lack of injectivity of algebraic morphisms is only a lack of locality , not of general covariance , which occurs when observables in a spacetime region @xmath2 exploit gauss law to measure charges that are located elsewhere in spacetime .",
    "( using classical spacelike compact solutions without modifying the gauge equivalence , one would not find any degeneracies , but the theory would not behave well under embeddings . )",
    "the logical relationship between the aharonov - bohm effect and gauss law that we establish by this procedure is indicated in figure [ fig_abgauss ] .",
    "in addition to a full clarification of the lack of locality of the quantum vector potential , our analysis also leads to a formula for the space of electric monopole charges in terms of the topology of the underlying spacetime .",
    "moreover , with little extra effort we derive our results for general @xmath4-form fields @xmath0 , where @xmath15 , the spacetime dimension .",

    "it is possible to obtain such theories by going to an off - shell algebra , at the price of losing the dynamics , which is also physically undesirable .",
    "instead , we argue that one should generalise the axiomatic framework of local covariance , in order to accommodate the lack of locality of electromagnetism , which is physically well - understood . what kind of axiomatic restriction should be placed on the ( lack of ) injectivity for general spacetime embeddings , if any , remains unclear .",
    "for the theories that we consider , injectivity of morphisms still holds for embeddings of spacetimes with trivial topology ( in the spirit of @xcite ) .",
    "however , a purely topological resolution of this issue seems unlikely , because other theories ( like linearised gravity @xcite ) possess gauge symmetries that are not related to the spacetime topology alone , but also to the background metric .    in the algebraic approach",
    "the construction of the algebras of the theory is only the first step , which should be followed by a discussion of the class of physical states .",
    "this topic , however , lies outside the scope of our paper , which aims to clarify the topological issues involved in the classical theory and on preserving them during quantisation .",
    "nevertheless we would like to remark here that we expect that it should be possible to extend the results of @xcite to define hadamard states for our theory on any globally hyperbolic spacetime and to prove the existence of such states by a deformation argument .",
    "also the construction of hadamard states from a bulk - to - boundary correspondence @xcite is expected to remain valid .",
    "in addition we would like to point the interested reader to @xcite , which constructs quasi - free hadamard states on a large class of spacetimes with the additional property that a gupta - bleuler type description of the representation remains valid .",
    "we have organised the contents of our paper as follows . in section [ sec_classical ]",
    "we will describe the ( essentially well - known ) results on the classical dynamics of the vector potential and its @xmath4-form generalisations .",
    "the main result is the well - posedness of the initial value formulation in the presence of a background current , also for distributional field configurations . in section [ sec_poisson ]",
    "we find the poisson structure on the classical phase space , using peierls method , and we study its degeneracy , which is related to gauss law and the spacetime topology . due to",
    "the background current the phase space is in general an affine poisson space , which will be quantised in section [ sec_quantum ] .",
    "a quantisation of the field strength can be derived from that of the vector potential .",
    "finally we will show that the theory is not locally covariant and that the lack of locality may be interpreted in terms of gauss law , also at the quantum level .",
    "most of the material that we present here on the classical dynamics of the vector potential and its @xmath4-form generalisations is not new , but in view of our later applications it is fitting to give some results and notations that go beyond standard treatments .",
    "this concerns in particular details on distributional solutions to normally hyperbolic and the maxwell equations .",
    "the subsections [ ssec_geo ] and [ ssec_nhyp ] introduce the relevant results and notations from differential geometry , based on @xcite , and for the cauchy problem for normally hyperbolic operators @xcite .",
    "subsequently we turn to the cauchy problem for the maxwell equations , in subsection [ ssec_maxwell ] , which is a slight generalisation of the work of @xcite .",

    "peierls method applies to any lagrangian theory , even if the equation of motion is non - linear . because we were studying a linear equation ( with source term ) , the extension of the classical space of solutions to include distributional solutions allowed us to view the space of observables as the continuous dual space , consisting of smooth test - forms . in this way",
    "the poisson bracket that we found was automatically well - defined on all observables .",
    "thirdly , we continued to use a geometric perspective by quantising the affine poisson space using ideas from deformation quantisation , in particular fedosov s method .",
    "it is not clear if ( or how ) these methods can be extended to general lagrangian theories , but in our case they allowed us to interpret the quantum field operators in terms of observables , in direct analogy to the classical case .",
    "in addition to these general choices of procedure , our arguments relied on a somewhat involved computation of the degeneracies of the poisson bracket . both at the classical and at the quantum level we were able to relate these degeneracies to gauss law ( at least for @xmath412 ) and they have lead to a formula for the space of electric monopoles that can influence a spacetime . for the field strength tensor associated to the vector potential",
    "we have mentioned that the degeneracies are ruled by @xmath1128 .",
    "these explanations vindicate the combination of the three procedural ingredients mentioned above .",
    "in addition we would like to point out that the degeneracies are not directly due to the aharonov - bohm effect , but our computation does establish that the aharonov - bohm effect and gauss law are related , via the poisson bracket",
    ".    the quantum theory @xmath1066 that we constructed is not locally covariant . from a mathematical point of view",
    "the reason can be ascribed to the degeneracy of the underlying poisson structure , which entails that the on - shell algebra possesses a non trivial centre , depending on the topology of the underlying spacetime . even though we motivated the gauge equivalence by viewing electromagnetism as a @xmath3 yang - mills theory in a general covariant setting , we did not analyse in detail the effect of non - trivial principal @xmath3-bundles on our results .",
    "such a formulation may shed further light on the geometric ( or topological ) causes of the failure of locality @xcite .",
    "we also omitted a detailed study of the special case @xmath405 , where a different choice of gauge equivalence would be appropriate .",
    "another potentially interesting research topic is the inclusion of dirac fields and their interaction with the vector potential at a perturbative level . in this framework",
    ", one may expect that the on - shell algebra would behave well under general embeddings , leading to a locally covariant theory ( cf .",
    "remark [ rem_a - alg - off ] ) .",
    "although the quantum theory @xmath1066 is not locally covariant , we have argued that it is generally covariant and that the failure of locality is a well - understood consequence of the gauge invariance . besides , we have shown that it is impossible to recover a locally covariant theory by dividing out the degeneracies of the poisson bracket , at least for the vector potential .",
    "for the field strength such a procedure is possible , and the off - shell theory is locally covariant from the start , but these theories are rather unphysical or have a limited physical applicability . finally , the idealisation of classical background currents is so useful that it should be considered as a perfectly satisfactory model . in our opinion",
    "these are sufficient grounds to consider modifying the framework of locally covariant quantum field theory , so as to accommodate physical theories with gauge symmetries and non - local observables .",
    "our notion of generally covariant quantum field theory is clearly general enough for this purpose , but it is not clear whether it is too general .    in the spirit of @xcite one could argue that the principle of local covariance wants to stress that algebras of arbitrarily small neighbourhoods of a point should depend only on the germ of the metric at this point .",
    "this is in line with the fact that for the @xmath4-form theories under consideration , the morphisms @xmath1076 are injective as soon as the source spacetime of @xmath273 has a trivial topology .",
    "such spacetimes could be used as building blocks for the entire theory , in such a way that topological effects can be inferred out of a failure of haag duality .",
    "( how this works in detail , and how these ideas relate to the universal field strength algebra of @xcite , will hopefully be addressed by some of us in a future investigation . ) on the other hand , one could argue that the topology of the underlying spacetimes is only relevant because the gauge symmetry of the @xmath4-forms fields is related to the topology . other linear gauge theories , in particular linearised general relativity , may have central elements in their algebras which are sensitive to the background metric @xmath70 as well as ( or instead of ) the background topology of @xmath17 .",
    "this could force us to search for other remedies , which are not of a purely topological nature .",
    "( this issue too will hopefully be addressed in a future investigation involving one of us . )",
