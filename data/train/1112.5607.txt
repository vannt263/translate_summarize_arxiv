    "ever since @xcite shot @xmath0 particles on a gold foil @xcite and @xcite subsequently used their results to confirm that atoms consist of a very small nucleus surrounded by an electron cloud @xcite , scientists have used scattering effects to determine the properties of otherwise invisible or inaccessible objects .",
    "in particular , quantum systems are usually investigated by means of scattering experiments .",
    "the central quantity in these quantum mechanical scattering systems is the matrix element of the transition operator @xmath1 , @xmath2 which describes the amplitude for the transition from a product state @xmath3 to another product state @xmath4 in first order born approximation . here , we distinguish between the states of the probe ( lower - case letters ) and the target ( upper - case letters ) .    in this work ,",
    "we limit ourselves to the treatment of the electronic transition of a single , isolated atom , and the effect it has on the probe triggering that transition . assuming a coulomb - like transition potential , @xmath5 with @xmath6 and inserting appropriate identity operators , the transition matrix element can be written as @xmath7 here , we assume that the probe electron was prepared as a plane wave , i.e. , @xmath8 , and that the detector also measures plane waves , i.e. , @xmath9 . and",
    "@xmath10 can always be described in a plane wave basis . in the most general case , each is given by a coherent superposition of several plane wave components .",
    "thus , the formulas derived in this article apply to each component of the general case as well . ] in that case , the transition matrix element assumes its commonly used form , @xmath11 or , by virtue of the partial wave or rayleigh expansion , @xmath12 where the @xmath13 denote the spherical harmonics and the @xmath14 are the spherical bessel functions of first kind .",
    "up to this point , the treatment is exact . in order to evaluate the matrix element further",
    ", one needs to explicitly specify the functions @xmath15 and @xmath16 , however . for",
    "the electronic transitions treated here , two common approximations are slater - type orbitals ( sto ) @xcite and hydrogen - like orbitals ( hlo ) @xcite . in both models ,",
    "the initial and final states are modeled as a spherical harmonic angular dependence and a ( analytic ) radial wavefunction @xmath17 : @xmath18 with this , eq .  [ eq : matrix_rayleigh ] becomes @xmath19 where the angular integral evaluates to wigner 3j symbols@xcite .",
    "hence , we will only deal with the radial integral @xmath20 in this work , for which we will derive an analytical form in the sto and hlo models .",
    "the rationale behind this choice of orbitals is the fact that the initial state is usually a tightly bound ( and hence strongly localized ) core state that is described well by an atomic model . since the matrix element can only be non - zero if both the initial and final states are non - zero , this effectively selects a portion of the final state that is close to the nucleus as well .",
    "crystal and many - body effects , on the other hand , are often relatively small perturbations  especially in the commonly experimentally accessible regions . in addition , for elucidating the underlying fundamentals , an analytical treatment in an isolated atom model is usually advantageous .    in many articles , eq .",
    "[ eq : radial_wf_overlap ] is simplified further by taking the small angle limit ( also known as dipole - approximation ) , @xmath21 in which case the integral over @xmath22 in eq .",
    "[ eq : radial_wf_overlap ] becomes only a weighting factor ( the factor @xmath23 can be moved out of the integral ) .",
    "for increasing momentum transfer , a leading term @xmath23 would increase boundlessly , giving rise to a similar effect as the ultraviolet catastrophe . to avoid that , an artificial cutoff @xmath24 is sometimes introduced , which is only fighting the symptoms instead of the cause , however , and is not very elegant .",
    "in addition , is has recently been shown experimentally using electron energy loss spectrometry ( eels ) that a @xmath23 dependence is an oversimplification even for @xmath25 and can lead to errors of the order of @xcite .",
    "the radial part of stos is given by@xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 is an effective quantum number ( which is not necessarily an integer ) .",
    "@xmath28 is an effective nuclear charge , with the physical nuclear charge @xmath29 and a screening factor @xmath30 .",
    "the normalization constant is given by @xmath31    then , eq .",
    "[ eq : radial_wf_overlap ] becomes @xmath32 where we defined @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "as derived in appendix  [ sec : int_j_lambda ] , this integral can be evaluated analytically , yielding @xmath35 ,      \\label{eq : sto_result}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] with the constants @xmath36 as defined in appendix  [ sec : int_j_lambda ] .",

    ", one can study the behavior of eq .",

    ". unphysical cut - offs are no longer necessary to ensure they tend to zero properly for large @xmath43 .",
    "in addition , they are simple finite sums of polynomials and  in the case of stos  elementary trigonometric functions . as such ,",
    "they are easily implemented into existing simulation programs@xcite with very little effort and the increase in computation time is small .     and underestimated in strength .",
    "consequently , @xmath44 is shifted towards smaller @xmath43 and severely underestimated in the sto model . ]",
    "it must be emphasized that stos are designed to have the same asymptotic behavior as hlos , but no nodes . in the case of @xmath45 ( in which case the hlos are also nodeless ) , they are identical . in all other cases ,",
    "the missing nodes are problematic .",
    "this is particularly evident in the case of @xmath46 which can be allowed in monopole or quadrupole transitions . in those cases",
    ", stos give completely wrong results because the node - less radial wave functions are not orthogonal as they should be , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : si_2p_3p_sto_hlo ] .     for the example of an isolated si atom .",
    "the top panel shows a 2p  @xmath47  3d dipole transition calculated using the sto model ( for @xmath48 , the curve is magnified by a factor of 50 ) , the bottom panel shows a 2p  @xmath47  3p quadrupole transition calculated using the hlo model .",
    "3d transition , hlo and sto calculations are identical . ] the screening constants for both cases were taken from ref .  .",
    "the dashed lines show the asymptotic behavior . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : si_2p_sto_hlo ] , examples of weighted radial wave function overlaps using both the sto and hlo models are shown in more detail .",
    "it is clearly evident that using the complete eqs .",
    "[ eq : sto_result ] and [ eq : hlo_result ] gives highly superior results than the approximations for small or large @xmath43 alone .",
    "3d dipole - transition calculated for crystalline si using the hlo model ( solid line ) and wien2k@xcite ( dots ) .",
    "the screening constants for the hlo model were determined by fitting to the wien2k data . for @xmath49 ,",
    "the data is magnified by a factor of 50 . ]",
    "the formulas even give comparable results to much more sophisticated calculations using a full crystalline environment of the atom . in fig .",
    "[ fig : wien2k ] , a calculation using the hlo model is compared to wien2k@xcite calculations using the telnes.3 program .",
    "the excellent agreement can primarily be attributed to the fact that the initial state  which has a high probability density in close proximity to the nucleus  can be viewed as a filter on the final state .",
    "consequently , the weighted radial wave function overlap is dominated by the shapes of the orbitals close to the nucleus , and crystal effects like bonding play only a secondary role .",
    "in this work , we have demonstrated that the transition probability in coulomb scattering can be separated in an angular part and a radial part .",
    "the former is composed of well - known matrix elements of spherical harmonics .",
    "the latter can be expressed in simple independent - atom models such as the sto or the hlo model . both yield simple algebraic expressions involving only finite sums of polynomials and ( in the case of stos ) elementary trigonometric functions .",
    "therefore , they are easy to implement into existing simulations programs without a large increase of the computation time , but with significant improvements in terms of accuracy , especially in the regime of medium momentum transfer",
    ".    moreover , some of the weighted radial wave function overlaps have one or more zeros .",
    "hence , they are suppressed at the corresponding momentum transfers , even though they are not forbidden by other selection rules . this can be exploited , e.g. , for measuring faint signals from transitions that are normally hidden under a huge background from another transition with much higher transition probability .",
    "finally , the formulas presented here can be exploited in the future to experimentally determine properties of wave functions in atoms , like the screening effects of other electrons .",
