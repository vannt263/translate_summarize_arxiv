    "absorption and scattering of electromagnetic waves by electrically ( optically ) small particles are basic , but very important phenomena , which we encounter in many branches of physics and engineering ( light propagation in atmosphere , small antennas and sensors , plasmonics , etc . )",
    "especially , _ resonant _ particles are interesting and important for applications due to strong interactions with electromagnetic fields .",
    "most commonly , these are plasmonic nanoparticles ( optical frequencies ) and various small antennas ( from radio to terahertz frequencies ) . on one hand , understanding of electromagnetic response of small particles",
    "appears to be very simple : after all , we deal with radiation from the simplest source , a point electric dipole . and indeed , basic properties of dipole radiators and antennas are well known for very long time , since the beginning of the 20ies century , and documented in numerous text books , e.g. @xcite . in particular , it is a classical result that the effective area ( absorption cross section ) of a small resonant wire antenna is of the order of @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the wavelength of the incident radiation ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "if this effective area would be as small as the geometrical cross section of the thin metal wire forming the antenna , no radios would work at frequencies below microwaves .",
    "but on the other hand , it appears that in the optical literature the fact that a small resonant particle can collect and absorb much more power than is incident on its geometrical cross section was recognized only in 1983 @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the same property has been recognized in 1950ies mainly in the works of s.m .",
    "rytov in the context of studies of thermal radiation from finite - size bodies ( thermal radiation from a resonant particle exceeds the black - body limit in the vicinity of resonances ) .",
    "recently , with the developments of plasmonics and metamaterials , basic phenomena of scattering and absorption in small resonant particles are again in the focus of research interests .",
    "for example , in paper @xcite it was shown that a focused laser beam ( the focal area of the order of @xmath0 ) can be nearly fully reflected by a small resonant dipole particle , which follows from the fact ( see above ) that its scattering cross section is of the same order .",
    "likewise , the theory of periodical arrays of small electric dipoles at normal incidence is a very simple special case of the well - developed theory of antenna arrays ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in particular , if a single small but resonant particle can absorb or reflect power `` collected '' from the surface of the order @xmath0 , it appears clear that a regular array of such particles can fully reflect plane waves if the period is smaller than @xmath1 ( the theory is given e.g. in @xcite ) .",
    "this is the enabling phenomenon in many applications of frequency selective surfaces ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the babinet principle tells that an ideally conducting sheet with periodically arranged electrically small but resonant holes can be fully transparent at the resonant frequency ( in recent literature , this phenomenon is called _ extraordinary transmission _ ) . in the optical literature , research on such simple resonant arrays is active even now : for example , in @xcite , this effect of nearly full reflection from an array of resonant low - loss particles is demonstrated for an array of dielectric spheres .",
    "however , general considerations on the maximum reflected and received power in such arrays appeared in the literature only recently @xcite .",
    "paper @xcite considers limiting receiving and scattering performance also of large and directive antennas .    in most recent literature ,",
    "there are numerous publications on exotic and special properties of resonant particles and their arrays , especially in plasmonics , in connection with the developments of metasurfaces and metamaterials and new devices ( cloaked sensors , light - trapping structures , etc . )",
    "this calls for good understanding of electromagnetic response of small but resonant structures and especially on fundamental limitations on their absorptive and scattering performance .",
    "this paper is a tutorial overview with the focus on fundamental limitations on absorption , extinction , and scattering cross sections and on most general results which hold for all small scatterers and planar arrays of such particles .",
    "most ( probably , even all ) results and conclusions of this review are known , but this knowledge is scattered in many publications in journals and books in various disciplines .",
    "there is no attempt to make a historical overview of the subject , and the reference list is limited to papers which are necessary to understand this review .",
    "limitations on electromagnetic response of small particles are considered also in recent papers @xcite .",

    ", when the loss parameter decreases , the amplitude of the induced dipole moment can reach arbitrary large values .",

    "while for determination of the near - field distribution and for calculations of the real part of the polarizability the accuracy of the quasi - static approximation is improving with decreasing the particle size , the above results for the effective cross section areas show that neglecting the scattering term proportional to @xmath21 leads to dramatically different results for low - loss resonant particles .",

    "actually , the quasi - static approximation can be used for small resonant dipole scatterers only when the absorption loss dominates over the scattering loss . for plasmonic nanoparticles",
    "this means the case of small radius of the particle , see formula below ( for silver spheres the estimation based on the drude model gives @xmath27 nm @xcite ) . for electrically small",

    "indeed , substitution of @xmath32 with @xmath17 and @xmath33 into the expression for the total scattered power gives the same result as in .",
    "physically , this extremum of absorbed power corresponds to a particle at resonance ( @xmath17 ) whose loss parameter is such that the amount of absorbed power is equal to the amount of scattered power .",
    "this extremum has the same meaning as the extremum of power delivered to a load from a generator when the load impedance is matched to the impedance of the source .",
    "similarly , in that case half of the power is delivered to the load and half is dissipated in the internal resistance of the generator .",

    "substitution of the optimal value of the particle polarizability gives the maximum power received by one particle p_abs max = a^24|e_inc|^2=a^22p_incthus , the extreme value of the effective area of each particle acting as a receiving antenna in an infinite array is _ abs max = a^22this agrees with the fact that an infinite array of electric dipole antennas can receive at maximum one half of the incident power ( the area of the unit cell is @xmath84 , but the effective receiving area of each dipole is @xmath85 ) .",
    "it is interesting to observe that particles in the grid absorb as much as the same particles in free space when ka = same for _ denser _ grids each particle dissipates smaller power than the same particle in free space illuminated by the same incident field .",
    "the power scattered by each particle in an infinite grid we can find multiplying by the unit - cell area @xmath84 : p_sc|_per  particle = a^2 ^ 22 z_g^2+(2+z_g)^2p_incthe maximal scattered power is achieved when @xmath86 , and it is equal to @xmath87 : the effective scattering area of each unit cell is _ twice as large _ as the physical area .",
    "this means that the array fully reflects the incident plane wave _ and _ creates a complete shadow behind the array ( the reflection coefficient @xmath88 and the transmission coefficient @xmath89 , see and ) . in terms of the particle polarizability",
    "this regime corresponds to lossless ( @xmath15 ) and resonant ( in the array ) particles ( @xmath90 ) . continuing the comparison of properties of individual particles in free space and the same particles in regular arrays",
    ", we see that also the scattered powers are the same if is satisfied .",
    "note that the ratio between the maximum scattered and received powers for regular grids is the same as for individual particles in free space ( four ) .",
    "the largest distance between small particles in a regular array such that no grating lobes still appear equals @xmath1 ( for the normal incidence ) . at this period ,",
    "the extreme values of absorption and scattering cross sections per particle in the array become @xmath91 , @xmath92 , which are larger values than for the same particles in free space .",
    "thus , coherent interactions in the grid can enhance interactions of the particles with the fields .",
    "on the other hand , for dense arrays ( @xmath93 ) , each particle in the array absorbs and scatters less than it would do individually in free space .    finally we note that adding an array of similarly optimized magnetic dipoles to the array we can receive 100% of the incident power , which is also a known result @xcite .",
    "the limitations on the extinction , absorption , and scattering properties of arbitrary small scatterers or antennas come from the fact that the maximum amplitude of the induced dipole moment is limited by the inevitable scattering loss . since the scattering loss factor is the same for all dipole scatterers ( it depends only on the frequency ) , the limitations are very general .",
    "the only assumptions ( besides linearity ) are that the particle is small ( reacts as an electric dipole ) and that there is no bi - anisotropy and no magnetic polarization .",
    "absorption and scattering by a magnetic dipole particle obeys the same rules , as follows from duality ( the corresponding formulas can be obtained replacing @xmath94 by @xmath95 and _ vice versa_. combining a magnetic dipole with an electric dipole , we can double the received power .",
    "more general bi - anisotropic particles are considered in recent paper @xcite .",
