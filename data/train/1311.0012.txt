    "recent observations @xcite continue to support the existence of dark energy(de ) , which is invisible to any method of detection except in einstein s evolution equation @xcite of the universe .",
    "the evidence for de has been taken into account since the 1998 observation of the accelerated expansion of the universe @xcite .",
    "the current de under this hypothesis is extremely small compared to the fundamental energy density of gravity @xmath3 , where @xmath4 .",

    "therefore , any good idea shedding light on this extremely small magnitude of de is welcome . in this paper",
    ", we suggest such a magnitude from a relation of the recently discovered higgs boson mass @xcite compared to the planck mass @xmath5 .",
    "this relation leading to the small de is drawn from the potential energy of an extremely light pseudo - goldstone boson originating from a discrete symmetry principle in an ultraviolet complete theory @xcite .",
    "such ultraviolet completions with abundant discrete symmetries can be found in the framework of explicit ( heterotic ) string theory constructions in the sprit of @xcite .",

    "when cdm was the dominant component , the cosmological scale factor @xmath7 grew as the @xmath8 power law of the cosmic time , @xmath9 , and the current acceleration was driven by comparing the data with the @xmath8 power law @xcite .",
    "it is the ` coincidence puzzle ' in particle cosmology why the de density has overcome the cdm energy density quite recently in the cosmic time scale . in this paper , we will not attempt to attack this problem of coincidence puzzle , but the de solution along our line of reasoning will be related to the axion cdm density .    .",

    "this vacuum is indicated by the thick lavender arrow in fig .",
    "[ fig : depotential](a ) .",
    "even though we do not yet have a good theory for understanding the true vacuum with the vanishing cc , it is still meaningful to assume that the cc is zero at the true vacuum @xcite .",

    "natural inflation is based on a cosine potential , and ours uses the quadratic potential as a leading term .",

    "[ fig : depotential](b ) .",
    "another difference is that the inflaton in natural inflation is probably a pseudoscalar field while the inflaton in hilltop inflation is a scalar field .",

    "this is because our hypothetical fields are arising from some gut multiplets , and if both the gravity contribution and the gut contribution to the interactions are present then the gut contribution dominates .",

    "namely , @xmath27   provides all the masses of the sm , including @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "therefore , if de can be calculated at all in terms of scalar vevs , its simplest form is expressible in terms of two mass scales , @xmath31 the intermediate scale @xmath32 is parametrically dependent on @xmath5 and @xmath27 , and later the axion scale ( about 100 times @xmath33 @xcite ) will be used for it to include all the qcd anomaly couplings .",

    "dilaton was suggested and the dilatonic symmetry was assumed with the spontaneous symmetry breaking scale at @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "the explicit breaking scale of the dilatonic symmetry is via the dimensional transmutation of asymptotically free theories , but the dimensional transmutation scale is not a mass parameter of scalar fields .",
    "@xmath27   determined from mass parameters of scalar fields can not serve as an explicit symmetry breaking of the dilatonic symmetry because it is another vev breaking the dilatonic symmetry .",
    "another feature of dilaton toward a de solution is changing newton s constant , which is unsatisfactory at the moment .",
    "in addition , we do not find any discussion on a basic discrete symmetry which we adopt here .",
    "there has been a tremendous effort to understand the de scale in the @xmath6cdm cosmology , not changing newtonian dynamics .",
    "the simplest account of de in this direction is the cc itself , but there is a theoretical difficulty to consider an extremely small cc as commented above that there is not yet a self - tuning solution towards a vanishing cc @xcite .",
    "so , if the cc itself is considered as the observed de , the anthropic bound @xmath43 @xcite is the most plausible argument .    in table [ tab : qnumb1 ] , naturalness in the second column is judged from the possibility of obtaining it from a symmetry principle , in particular from a discrete symmetry principle .",

    "string theory has the gravity multiplet in 10-dimensions @xmath52 : the symmetric tensor field @xmath53 which contains graviton , the dilaton , and the antisymmetric tensor field @xmath51 .",
    "when six of ten dimensions are compactified , @xmath51 leads to pseudoscalar fields , the model - independent(mi ) pseudoscalar for @xmath54 and model - dependent(md ) pseudoscalar for @xmath55 .",
    "these were considered before for the de called ` quintessential axion ' @xcite .",
    "it is known that the quintessential axion has a difficulty for making its potential extremely flat unless massless quarks are introduced @xcite .",
    "probably , the md axions obtain non - negligible superpotential terms @xcite , which is the reason we usually neglect these at low energy . for the mi axion",
    ", it can become the phase of a u(1)@xmath56   transformation below the string scale if the compactification leads to the anomalous u(1 ) .",
    "the very light qcd axion from string theory is usually based on this scheme @xcite . because the decay constants of @xmath51 turn out to be somewhat reduced from @xmath5 @xcite ,",

    "to relate the deps to @xmath27 , it is necessary to couple it to the higgs fields @xmath68 , which implies that u(1)@xmath1   has a qcd anomaly because @xmath69 and @xmath70 couple to quarks .",
    "therefore , to have a qcd - anomaly free u(1)@xmath1 , it is necessary to introduce two u(1 ) global symmetries , u(1)@xmath1   and u(1)@xmath56   in our case so that one anomaly - free combination results .",
    "the anomaly - free combination is our deps .",
    "the remaining one is the qcd axion .",
