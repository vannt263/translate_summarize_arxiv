    "the first rotational transition ( j = 1@xmath60 ) of carbon monoxide ( co ) , at 115.27 ghz has been the most popular choice .",
    "this transition , however , has long been known to be nearly always optically thick , so for a given filling factor its intensity is expected to increase monotonically with the kinetic temperature of the emitting gas . clearly , this could have adverse effects on efforts to establish the distribution of molecular gas in the ism from co observations alone , because very low temperature gas might go unnoticed in sensitivity - limited co observations while warm regions ( @xmath7 20 k ) will stand out even if they are not those with the highest molecular content .",
    "the sources where these effects might be most noticeable are those with large temperature gradients ; for instance in molecular clouds located in the immediate vicinity of hot stars .",

    "( 1996 ) and helfer & blitz ( 1997 ) .",
    "as mentioned earlier , we will use a smoothed version of that dataset here in order to compare with our formaldehyde observations .    in general , the co emission and h@xmath2co  absorption morphologies in this region are quite similar ( fig .  [ fig:2comp ] ) .",

    "it is also in good agreement with the results obtained towards the galactic anticenter by rodrguez et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , and towards the orion molecular complex by cohen et al .",
    "there are , however , several noteworthy differences between the co emission and h@xmath2co  absorption in s140 .",
    "the first difference is the fact that the co peak and the h@xmath2coabsorption maximum are not located at the same position .",
    "the co integrated intensity map ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2comp ] , see also fig.[fig : mosaic ] ) shows that the maximum co emission occurs just behind the s140 h@xmath18 arc at the western edge of l1204 , while only comparatively fainter emission extends to greater longitudes .",
    "the maximum h@xmath2co  absorption , however , is located about 10@xmath4 eastward of the co peak .",
    "a second notable difference between the co and h@xmath2coprofile is the existence of a co emission `` tail '' in the south / southeast part of the main cloud with little or no h@xmath2cocounterpart ( figs . 2 and 3 ) .    in order to study the relation between h@xmath2co  absorption and co(1 - 0 ) emission in a more quantitative way ,",
    "we have computed the moments of the profiles shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mosaic ] .",
    "the results are listed in table  [ table : mom ] ( appendix b ) .",
    "when two velocity components are visible at a given pointing , the moments for each were computed separately .",
    "intensities above @xmath37 are shown as squares in fig.[fig : intensityratio ] , and were used to make least - square fits ( see below ) .",
    "the two spatio - kinematical components that we identified in our formaldehyde dataset behave quite similarly with respect to the co - h@xmath2co  relation , and are plotted together in fig.[fig : intensityratio ] .",
    "the best least - squares fit to a straight line for the entire l1204 dataset yields :    @xmath38    we shall see momentarily that the co emission near s140 may be particularly bright because of local heating . ignoring the pointings very near s140 , however , yields a fairly similar relation between co and h@xmath2co :    @xmath39    the small difference between these relations presumably reflects the differing excitation requirements for the two lines .",
    "the relation between co and h@xmath2co  given by eqs .",
    "[ eq : relation1 ] and [ eq : relation2 ] for the l1204 region is almost identical to that found towards the galactic anticenter by rodrguez et al.(2006 ) :    @xmath40    it is important to note , however , that , in spite of the agreement between the fits to the galactic anticenter and s140 data , there is very significant scatter in the co - h@xmath2co  relation , some points lying nearly 10@xmath41 away from the linear relation .",
    "this situation was already noticed by @xcite in their study of the galactic anticenter .",
    "this lack of a detailed correspondence between co emission and h@xmath2co  absorption presumably reflects differences in the excitation conditions of the two tracers , as we will now discuss in the next section .",
    "the comparison between h@xmath2co  absorption and co(1 - 0 ) emission profiles in the galactic anticenter and in the l1204/s140 region has led us to three important observational conclusions :    1 .",
    "qualitatively , the morphology of co and h@xmath2co  are quite similar , and quantitatively , the line integrated intensities correlate quite well with one another .",
    "2 .   the scatter in the co - h@xmath2co  relation is , however , significantly larger than the observational errors .",
    "3 .   in the specific case of s140 ,",
    "the co emission peak is offset by about 3 pc from the locus of the deepest formaldehyde absorption , and there is a region south of the main cloud where significant co emission is detected with little or no h@xmath2co  counterpart .    from the general large - scale correspondance between the co(1 - 0 ) and h@xmath2co  6 cm integrated maps ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2comp ] ) , and from the fair correlation between their line intensities ( fig.[fig : intensityratio ] ) , we conclude that the physical conditions needed for the excitation of both lines are quite similar . the calculations presented in the appendix",
    "a , indeed show that both lines preferentially trace warm gas at intermediate densities ( 10@xmath42@xmath43 n @xmath43 10@xmath44 for h@xmath2co ; n @xmath45 10@xmath46 for co ) . in this scheme ,",
    "the offset between the co(1 - 0 ) peak and the h@xmath2co  maximum absorption may seem puzzling .",
    "note that a similar trend is seen at higher resolution : while the co peak in the full - resolution co map published by heyer et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and helfer & blitz ( 1997 ) is at @xmath13 = 106@xmath47.8 , @xmath15 = + 5@xmath47.3 , the h@xmath2co  absorption feature seen in the high - resolution vla images published by evans et al .",
    "( 1987 ) is centered around @xmath13 = 106@xmath47.9 , @xmath15 = + 5@xmath47.3 , again a few arcminutes to the east .",
    "we suggest that a combination of two effects may explain this puzzling result .",
    "first , it can be seen from the excitation analysis presented in appendix a that the h@xmath2co  absorption strength `` saturates '' for @xmath48 k , whereas the temperature of the co emission continues to rise at higher kinetic temperature ( fig .",
    "5 ) . for example , while the h@xmath2co  line strength increases by only about 30% when the kinetic temperature goes from 20 to 40 k , the co(1 - 0 ) line intensity increases by more than a factor of two .",
    "according to @xcite , the co brightness temperature is about 40 k at the peak and 20 k for the rest of the cloud .",
    "thus , the strong co peak behind s140 may well be largely due to enhanced kinetic temperatures related to local heating ( by the external star providing the ionization of s140 , and/or by the infrared sources embedded in the cloud ) .",
    "as one progresses into the cloud , the local heating diminishes , and the co line intensity fades . also , it should be pointed out that the formaldehyde calculations presented in the appendix show that the 6-cm line should be seen in emission rather than absorption when the density exceeds 10@xmath11 @xmath9 . the fact that this is not the case near the co peak ( neither in our low - resolution data , nor in the high - resolution vla data presented by evans 1978 ) suggests that the gas density there is lower than 10@xmath11 @xmath9 .",
    "other effects that could explain the offset between the co and the h@xmath12co peaks are the lower dissociation energy , and the lower abundance ( and , therefore , lower self - shielding ) of formaldehyde compared to co ( see appendix a.3 ) . in a photo - dissociated region , these effects should combine to create a stratified distribution where co survives nearer the source of the uv photons than h@xmath12co .",
    "this stratification , combined with the heating of the co , would naturally lead to the offset between h@xmath12co and co seen in the present data .",
    "finally , the origin of the other main difference between co and h@xmath2coin s140 , namely the existence of co emission at the south of l1204 with no or little formaldehyde counterpart , is likely related to another aspect of the excitation differences between the 6 cm line of formaldehyde and the 1 - 0 transition of carbon monoxide .",
    "6 of the appendix a.2 shows that the density detection limit for h@xmath2co  line is @xmath510 times larger than the density limit for the co(1 - 0 ) line .",
    "we therefore suggest that the gas traced by the co emission to the south of l1204 is of relatively very low density .",
    "it is interesting to note , indeed , that classical high - density molecular tracers ( e.g.  cs or nh@xmath49 ) have only been detected around the co peak behind s140 , and not in the southern region of the cloud .",
    "thus , we conclude that the co(1 - 0 ) and h@xmath2co  6 cm lines both tend to preferentially trace warm gas at intermediate densities .",
    "there are , however , significant differences related either to differing excitation requirements or to differing abundances .",
    "these differences can easily explain the large scatter in the co ",
    "h@xmath12co relation .",
    "the main conclusions of this work are the following :    1 .",
    "we have mapped a large region ( 70@xmath4 @xmath17 110@xmath4 ) around l1204/s140 in the 6 cm line of formaldehyde , observing a total of 72 regularly - spaced positions every 10@xmath4 on a regular grid .",
    "the center of our map was at @xmath13 = @xmath24 , @xmath15 = + @xmath25 , and formaldehyde was detected against the cosmic microwave background in at least 16 of our 72 positions ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "the formaldehyde emission can be separated in three spatio - kinematical components ( fig .",
    "3 ) : two ( at @xmath35 @xmath5 11 km s@xmath20 in the northeast part of the cloud , and at @xmath35 @xmath5 8 km s@xmath20 just behind s140 ) are clearly associated with l1204 , whereas the other ( an isolated component at @xmath35 @xmath5 2.5 km s@xmath20 towards the southeast ) is most likely a local foreground cloud unrelated to s140/l1204 .",
    "3 .   both qualitatively and quantitatively , the co(1 - 0 ) emission and the formaldehyde 6 cm absorption lines correlate fairly well .",
    "an excitation analysis shows that both preferentially trace warm gas at intermediate densities .",
    "4 .   there are , however , notable differences between the co and h@xmath2colines , that can be traced to differing excitation requirements and abundances . those differences are most likely the origin of the large scatter in the co - h@xmath2co  intensity correlation .",

    "parallel slab irradiated from one side by a uv field with an enhancement factor @xmath84 with respect to the @xcite average interstellar radiation field . in a pdr , the gas is heated by the photoelectric emission from grains and pah s , h@xmath2  formation in grains , uv pumping in the lyman and werner bands , gas  grain collisions , photoionization , and photodissociation .",
    "as the uv radiation is absorbed deeper into the cloud , other processes like cosmic rays and chemical reaction energies become important . cooling is produced by fine  structure and molecular line emission .",
    "shocks and turbulence can keep a pdr away from isobaric equilibrium . however in our model the temperature and density of the pdr were kept constant in order to compare the results with our h@xmath2co  model in fig.[fig : comparison ] .",
    "we used the chemical network given for s140 by the meudon group at its internet site , which does not include h@xmath2co .",
    "thus the co and h@xmath2co  calculations represent different models , and fig .  [",

    "ultraviolet radiation ( fuv ) from the star hd211880 will have an enhancement factor of @xmath86 with respect to the average interstellar field @xcite at the ionization front , although @xcite found that a more intense radiation field may be needed to explain the h@xmath2  rotational emission .",
    "h@xmath2co  has a dissociation energy of 3.61 @xmath87 0.03 ev @xcite , and a photodissociation rate of 1.0 @xmath17 10@xmath88 sec@xmath20 in the interstellar field @xcite while for co the values are 11.2 ev and 2.0 @xmath17 10@xmath89 sec@xmath20 respectively . thus it is possible that the h@xmath2co  will be selectively photodissociated near the s140 ionization front and the bright pdr region , where the co emission peaks .",
    "detailed pdr model calculations by @xcite show that at 20@xmath4 from the ionization front , where we observe the h@xmath2co  maximum , @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "we added 62 reactions involving @xmath92 and @xmath93 taken from the umist data base ( woodall et al . , 2007 ) to the chemical network of the meudon group mentioned above and ran a pdr model with @xmath94 , @xmath95k and constant density of @xmath96 .",
    "we found that @xmath92 has significant abundance only at depths of @xmath97 while co becomes important at @xmath98 , which shows that photodestruction could explain the offset between the co and the h@xmath12co peaks .",
