    "one - dimensional bose and fermi systems with contact interactions have been studied for many decades now , especially in the regime where the systems obey periodic boundary conditions  @xcite .",
    "a large fraction of the eigenstates can be thought of as corresponding to gas - like states .",
    "a second subset of eigenstates corresponds to self - bound droplet - like states .",
    "these states maintain their bound state character in the absence of periodic boundary conditions , i.e. , in free space .",
    "in many cases , both the gas - like and droplet - like states can be obtained analytically via the bethe ansatz .",
    "the bethe ansatz takes advantage of the fact that the zero - range nature of the interactions , combined with the fact that particles in one dimension have to pass through each other to exchange positions , allows one to identify constants of motion .",
    "the solutions can then be derived in terms of these constants of motion .",
    "a closely related aspect is that a variety of one - dimensional systems with two - body contact interactions are integrable  @xcite .",
    "the solution of the homogeneous system can be applied to one - dimensional systems under spatially varying external confinement via the local density approximation  @xcite .",
    "this approximation typically provides a highly accurate description for a large number of particles but not necessarily for a small number of particles .",
    "it is thus desirable to derive more accurate descriptions for small one - dimensional systems with two - body delta - function interactions under external confinement .",
    "unfortunately , extensions of the bethe ansatz to inhomogeneous systems are , in general , not known .",
    "this can be understood intuitively by realizing that the relative two - body momentum in inhomogeneous systems is not conserved due to the presence of the spatially varying confinement .",
    "correspondingly , harmonically trapped one - dimensional few - body systems have been treated numerically by various techniques  @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we apply standard raleigh - schrdinger perturbation theory to harmonically confined systems and derive approximate solutions whose accuracy can be improved systematically by considering successively higher orders in the expansion in the small parameter .",
    "we focus on one - dimensional fermi gases with a single impurity under external harmonic confinement .",
    "this system is of particular interest since it has been realized experimentally in jochim s cold atom laboratory  @xcite . in the experiments ,",
    "the impurity is a lithium atom that occupies a hyperfine state different from the hyperfine state that the majority atoms occupy .",
    "the trapping geometry is highly - elongated and effectively one - dimensional .",
    "we will show that our perturbative results enable us to calculate the energy of the upper branch , which has been studied experimentally , with fairly good accuracy for all @xmath0 over a wide range of coupling strengths .",
    "in addition , our results provide bounds on the energies in the weakly- and strongly - interacting regimes .",
