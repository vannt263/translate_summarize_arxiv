    "experimental data on the @xmath1he@xmath2 reaction close to threshold have revealed some surprising features @xcite .",
    "inspite of the large momentum transfer involved in @xmath0 production as compared to that in pion production , the cross section for @xmath1he@xmath10 is large and comparable with that for @xmath11he@xmath12 .",
    "the energy dependence of the two reactions near threshold is also very different .",
    "the @xmath1he@xmath2 reaction shows a much rapid variation , with the threshold amplitude falling by a factor of 3.75 over an @xmath0 centre of mass momentum of 75 mev / c .",
    "the observed features of the @xmath1he@xmath2 reaction have been attributed to the strong final state @xmath0-nucleus interaction .",
    "this reaction was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the final state interaction ( fsi ) was incorporated in an approximate way through an enhancement factor .",
    "the cross section was factorized in terms of the amplitude for the reaction @xmath1he@xmath2 with plane waves for the @xmath3he in the final state and an s - wave fsi factor written in terms of the on - shell @xmath0-nucleon amplitude .",
    "the energy dependence of the cross section data was reproduced , though its predicted absolute value was lower by a factor of 2.5 . in",
    "yet another work @xcite , the scattering length of the @xmath0 meson on helium was calculated using multiple scattering theory , which was then used to calculate the fsi factor for the @xmath1he@xmath2 cross section .",
    "the fsi factor with an @xmath0-nucleon scattering length @xmath13 leading to @xmath14=(-0.89 , 1.8 ) was found to give a good fit to the @xmath1he@xmath2 data .",
    "the @xmath1he@xmath2 reaction at threshold and higher energies has also been studied theoretically to investigate the reaction mechanism involved @xcite . due to the large mass of the @xmath0 meson",
    ", the momentum transfer involved in this reaction is large .",
    "it is 900 mev / c at threshold and reduces to 500 mev / c by about 1 gev above threshold . as a result of this , it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the three - body mechanism which allows the momentum transfer to be shared amongst three nucleons dominates .",
    "the one and two body mechanisms were found to underestimate the experimental cross sections by more than two orders of magnitude .",
    "the three nucleons share the large momentum transfer through a two step process where the incident proton interacts with a nucleon in the deuteron to produce a pion which then interacts with the other nucleon in the deuteron to produce an @xmath0 meson .",
    "the @xmath1he@xmath2 reaction , thus , proceeds via the @xmath15 and @xmath16 reactions . though the @xmath1he@xmath2 reaction can in principle proceed through the one and two body mechanism , considering the support in existing literature @xcite for the three body mechanism and the fact that the low momentum components of the nuclear wave function are picked up in this way , at least at energies very close to threshold it seems justified to consider this mechanism to be the only major reaction mechanism for the @xmath1he@xmath2 reaction .    in the present work we study the @xmath1he@xmath2 reaction near threshold using the three body mechanism mentioned above .",
    "our main objective is to investigate the fsi in this reaction in a rigorous way .",
    "the above mentioned theoretical works in the literature either neglect the fsi or incorporate it in an approximate way using on - shell amplitudes .",
    "we express the @xmath3he relative wave function in terms of the lippmann schwinger equation involving the t - matrix for @xmath3he elastic scattering .",
    "this t - matrix is evaluated using a method of few body equations @xcite which will be described in detail in the next section .    in section 2",
    "we present the formalism for the calculation of the @xmath1he@xmath2 cross section including the fsi .",
    "the production mechanism for @xmath1he@xmath2 reaction within a two - step model is described in section 3 . in section 4",
    "we present the results .",
    "we reproduce the shape and magnitude of the experimentally measured scattering amplitude .",
    "the off - shell effects in @xmath3he scattering are found to be important in producing the energy dependence of the cross section .",
    "the transition matrix for the reaction @xmath1he@xmath10 , which includes the interaction between the @xmath0 meson and @xmath17he is given by , @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the spin projections of the proton , deuteron and helium respectively .",
    "@xmath22 and @xmath23 are the momenta of the particles in the initial and final states .",
    "the final state @xmath3he wave function @xmath24 consists of a plane wave and a scattered wave , and can be written as , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the t - matrix for @xmath3he elastic scattering . replacing the above wave function in eq .",
    "( [ tmat ] ) , we get , @xmath27 the matrix elements @xmath28 in the above equation correspond to the born amplitude for the @xmath1he@xmath2 reaction .",
    "we calculate these matrix elements using a two step model which will be discussed in the next section .    the t - matrix , @xmath26 , in eq . ( [ tmat2 ] ) for @xmath3he elastic scattering",
    "is evaluated using four particle equations for the @xmath29 system . for practical convenience ,",
    "the evaluation of @xmath26 is done within a finite rank approximation ( fra ) approach .",
    "this means that the nucleus in the elastic meson - nucleus scattering is always in its ground state .",
    "the shortcomings of the fra for the @xmath0-deuteron system have been investigated in ref .",
    "however , for the low energies concerned in this work and also as mentioned in ref .",
    "@xcite , it seems justified to use the fra for the @xmath30he system .",
    "we write the target hamiltonian @xmath31 as , @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the nuclear ground state wave function and @xmath34 the binding energy .    within this approximation ,",

    "since there exists a lot of uncertainty in the knowledge of the @xmath0-nucleon interaction , we use three different prescriptions of the @xmath0-n t - matrix , t@xmath49 , leading to different values of the @xmath0-n scattering length . we give a brief description of these models of t@xmath49 below .",
    "the elementary matrix , t@xmath49 is then used in the evaluation of the t - matrix for @xmath3he scattering . in ref .",
    "@xcite a coupled channel t - matrix including the @xmath50n and @xmath0n channels with the s@xmath51 - @xmath0n interaction playing a dominant role was constructed .",

    "@xcite which gives a much smaller value of @xmath57 , namely , @xmath57 = ( 0.28 , 0.19 ) fm . in this model",
    "the @xmath50n , @xmath0n and @xmath59 channels were treated in a coupled channels formalism .",
    "it is important to note that the parameters in all the coupled channel t - matrices mentioned above are adjusted to reproduce the data on the @xmath60 reaction , but the values of @xmath57 deduced from them are different .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , we assume the @xmath0 production in @xmath1he@xmath2 to proceed through a two - step process via the @xmath15 and @xmath61 reactions as shown in fig .",
    "1 . the amplitude for the @xmath1he@xmath2 reaction appearing in eq .",

    "the matrix element for @xmath1he@xmath2 is half of that written above for @xmath64 .",
    "hence we calculate the t - matrix as in eq .",
    "( [ ampli ] ) and multiply it by a factor of 3/2 to account for the intermediate @xmath65 . each of the individual matrix elements in the above equation is expressed in terms of partial wave expansions .",
    "the matrix elements for the @xmath66 reaction , parametrized in terms of the available experimental data are taken from ref .",
    "for the @xmath67 reaction , we use the coupled channel t - matrix of ref .",
    "@xcite , mentioned in the previous section .",
    "the matrix elements @xmath68 and @xmath69he@xmath70 consist of the deuteron and helium wave functions in momentum space .",
    "we use the deuteron wave function from ref .",
    "@xcite where an analytical parametrization of it was done with a paris potential .",
    "this wave function reproduces the known low energy properties and the electromagnetic form factor of the deuteron well . for the @xmath17he wave function ,",
    "we use the parametrization given in ref .",
    "the values of the parameters in @xcite were obtained by fitting the wave function to the variational calculations of schiavilla _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite using the urbana force .",
    "the details of eq .",
    "( [ ampli ] ) are given in the appendix .",
    "the reaction @xmath1he@xmath2 has been studied at saturne @xcite for proton energies between 0.2 and 11 mev above threshold . taking out the phase space factor ,",
    "the spin averaged amplitude can be defined as , @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the proton and @xmath0 momenta in the centre of mass system . the data on @xmath73 ( see fig .",
    "2 ) drops rapidly ( by about a factor of 3.75 ) from threshold to 0.4 @xmath74 momentum ( corresponding to 11 mev energy ) above threshold . in fig .",
    "2 we compare our calculations of @xmath73 ( at @xmath75 ) with and without the inclusion of the @xmath3he final state interaction ( fsi ) , with the data from refs @xcite . the dotted line in fig .",
    "2 is our calculation without fsi and can be seen to be a constant as a function of energy .",
    "the dash - dotted , solid and dashed curves are the results obtained using the t - matrix of ref .",
    "@xcite , with parameter sets ( i ) and ( ii ) , and that of ref .",
    "@xcite respectively .",
    "we see that the fsi is responsible for changing the shape of @xmath73 from a constant to a rapidly falling one as a function of energy .    in",
    "what follows , we shall study the off shell and the binding energy effects in the fsi .",
    "we also calculate the angular distribution and total cross - sections for the @xmath76he@xmath77 reaction . in all these calculations we use the prescription of ref .",
    "@xcite with parameter set ( ii ) for the elementary t - matrix , @xmath78 .",
    "we arrive at the same results qualitatively , in all the calculations if we choose the parameter set ( i ) of the same t - matrix or the elementary matrix , @xmath78 of ref .",
    "@xcite .    in fig .",
    "3 we study the off - shell effects in the fsi . as seen in section 2 , we describe the @xmath3he final state interaction through an off - shell t - matrix for @xmath3he scattering .",
    "previous estimates of fsi in literature have been made using on - shell amplitudes and hence it is important to check the validity of such an approximation .",
    "the @xmath3he t - matrix appears in an integral in eq .",
    "( [ tmat2 ] ) which can be split into the principal value and pole term . retaining only the pole term in eq .",
    "( [ tmat2 ] ) and setting the principal value ( which involves the off - shell @xmath3he scattering ) to zero , we get the dash dotted line in fig .",
    "the pole term alone is unable to reproduce the shape of the data and in fact reduces the magnitude of the results obtained without fsi .",
    "we find that @xmath79 of ref .",
    "@xcite , with parameter set ( i ) and ( ii ) and that of ref .",
    "@xcite have similar on - shell behaviour meaning that the same dash dotted curve of fig .",
    "3 represents the pole term calculation for the 3 different prescriptions of @xmath80 .",
    "the solid line represents the full calculation using the prescription of ref .",
    "@xcite with parameter set ( ii ) for the elementary t - matrix .",
    "thus we see that including the off shell effects produces the proper energy dependence of @xmath73 in addition to increasing its magnitude as compared to the pole term calculation .",
    "the other two prescriptions of @xmath79 ( fix _ et al . _",
    "( i ) and bhalerao _ et al .",
    "_ ) show similar off - shell effects .",
    "however , as can be seen from the curves in fig .",
    "2 , the increase in magnitude as compared to the pole term is smaller .",
    "next , in fig .",
    "4 , we study the effect of the fsi on the angular distributions at different energies . as observed in fig . 2",
    "too , we see that the fsi increases the magnitude of the cross sections with the increase being maximum at threshold ( fig .",
    "the angular dependence of the cross sections without fsi ( dashed lines ) is isotropic at threshold and deviates by a small amount from the isotropy with increase in beam energy .",
    "the small anisotropy at a few mev above threshold is somewhat amplified by the final state interaction .",
    "thus , as one goes to higher energies ( fig .",
    "4c ) , though the fsi does not increase the magnitude of the cross section too much , it does change the angular dependence .    in fig .",
    "5 we show the angle integrated total cross section as a function of beam energy .",
    "the total cross sections without fsi are shown by the dashed line .",
    "the solid line is obtained by numerically integrating the angular distribution with fsi included .",
    "the dash dotted curve indicates the total cross section calculated with fsi included but assuming the angular distribution to be isotropic ( i.e. @xmath81 ) .",
    "the data of ref .",
    "@xcite seems to indicate a negligible forward - backward asymmetry ( which is consistent with zero within 5% at all energies from 0 to 11 mev above threshold ) in the @xmath1he@xmath2 reaction . within the two - step fsi model of the present work , however , we find small deviations from isotropy at energies away from threshold .",
    "since the total cross section assuming isotropic angular distribution gives better agreement with data , it seems that the two step model of the present work underestimates the cross section at forward angles .",
    "the data on the squared amplitude @xmath82 at 180@xmath83 is however very well produced as seen earlier in fig .",
    "2 .    finally , in fig .",
    "6 we study the effects on the @xmath1he@xmath2 reaction , of including the fsi which incorporates the binding effects in @xmath17he . once again we plot the amplitude squared @xmath73 calculated for three different elementary t - matrices , @xmath78 .",
    "the solid curves are the calculations using @xmath34 = -7.718 mev in eq .",
    "( [ tfsi ] ) for @xmath26 .",
    "the dashed curves represent the calculation with @xmath84 , i.e. no binding effects in the final state interaction .",
    "the calculated results without the binding effects are larger than those which include them .",
    "the magnitude of the increase , however , depends upon the elementary t - matrix , @xmath79 , under consideration .",
    "it is nearly a factor of 2 when we use the t - matrix of ref .",
    "@xcite , with parameter set ( i ) , a factor of 1.25 when we use the same t - matrix with parameter set ( ii ) and negligibly small for the t - matrix of ref .",
    "the @xmath1he@xmath2 reaction has been studied in the present work within a two step model , incorporating the final state interaction ( fsi ) of the @xmath17he nucleus and @xmath0 meson in a rigorous way .",
    "the peculiar behaviour of the cross section for this @xmath0 producing reaction as compared to a similar pion production reaction @xmath11he@xmath85 is seen to originate due to the interaction between @xmath17he and @xmath0 .",
    "the fsi changes the energy dependence of the squared amplitude from a constant ( without fsi ) to one which falls by a factor of about 4 , from threshold to 11 mev above threshold .",
    "we incorporate the fsi through an off - shell t - matrix for @xmath3he elastic scattering .",
    "this t - matrix is evaluated by numerically solving few body equations which include the nuclear binding effects .",
    "both the off - shell as well binding effects in @xmath3he scattering are found to be important in the calculation of the @xmath1he@xmath2 reaction near threshold .",
    "earlier investigations of this reaction involving on - shell and approximate ways of calculating the fsi should hence be treated with caution .",
    "the @xmath0 nucleus interaction has generated a lot of interest in the past few years , particularly due to the possibility of forming @xmath0 mesic nuclei . since it is difficult to obtain data on elementary @xmath0 nucleon scattering , little",
    "is known about the @xmath46 interaction .",
    "the scattering length in @xmath46 scattering is a much debated quantity and different estimates and limiting values ( for the possible formation of an @xmath0 mesic nucleus ) of this parameter exist in literature . within the models used in the present work",
    "we find that values of the @xmath46 scattering length , re @xmath86 0.75 to 0.9 and i m @xmath86 0.3 to 0.4 lead to a good reproduction of the @xmath1he@xmath2 data near threshold .",
