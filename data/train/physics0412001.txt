    "the belle experiment  @xcite , located on the kekb  @xcite asymmetric - energy @xmath1 collider , is primarily devoted to the study of cp violation in the @xmath2  meson system .",
    "kekb has shown a very stable operation with increasing luminosity over the years .",
    "it has turned to so - called `` continuous injection mode '' last january , thus allowing a gain in the integrated luminosity of about 30% . in this mode , the beam particle losses are compensated by continuously injecting beam from the linear accelerator , without interruption of data taking .    kekb has reached a world record peak luminosity of @xmath3  @xmath4s@xmath0 and an integrated luminosity of about 1  fb@xmath0  per day . in the meanwhile ,",
    "belle has accumulated a total integrated luminosity of 290  fb@xmath0  ( about 275  million @xmath2  meson pairs ) , among which 127  fb@xmath0  was collected between october  2003 and july  2004 ( svd2 run ) .",

    "cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ failure - tab ]    in addition , a number of limitations to the processing speed have been observed :    database access is one of the main issues , since processing makes heavy use of the database , in particular at the start of a job .",
    "using more dedicated servers will solve this issue .",
    "the limited cpu power of tape servers which distribute the data the dbasf clusters was identified as the present bottleneck .",
    "faster tape servers will be used in the future .",
    "the network bandwidth between the input server and basf nodes may eventually limit the processing power .",
    "this does not seem to be a major issue in the near future .",
    "none of these limitations , however , seriously hampered the processing speed .",
    "the new offline processing scheme started running on may 18 , 2004 . in 39 days of stable",
    "running , it successfully processed the 3 billion events collected by kekb with a maximum rate of 5/fb / day , 5 times faster than the data acquisition and the previous scheme . with the expected increase of the kekb luminosity , however , the dst processing will face further challenges  room for improvement of this scheme still remains ."
