( the original daubechies condition can be found in @xcite . a later variant is due to casazza and christensen @xcite . ) the precise dependence of @xmath54 and @xmath55 on these quantities is explained in the definitions in section  [ mainproofs ] , and then revisited in a specific situation in section  [ mexicanexample ] , when we treat the mexican hat .",
    "next we give a strong answer to meyer s completeness question about non - orthogonal wavelets , for the class of wavelets in our main theorem .",
    "[ cor - expansions ] assume all the hypotheses of theorem  [ invertible ] hold .",

    "we apply the corollary in section  [ mexicanexample ] to the mexican hat example .",
    "there we construct an analyzer @xmath31 which , when combined with the mexican hat synthesizer , generates a frame operator lying less than @xmath58 from the identity on @xmath8 and less than about @xmath59 from the identity in @xmath1 .",
    "thus the frame operator is a bijection , and so the mexican hat wavelet can reproduce each function in @xmath60 and @xmath2 .",
    "note that wavelet systems can not reproduce @xmath61-functions with nonzero integral , because the wavelet @xmath19 and all its dilates have integral zero .",
    "interestingly , reproduction in @xmath0 with @xmath62 can be achieved by using only the small scales ( terms with @xmath63 ) , as shown in @xcite .",
    "open problems that a motivated reader might pursue include higher dimensional analogues of theorem  [ invertible ] , and the case of @xmath64 spaces for @xmath65 .      motivating literature for our approach includes : the @xmath8 frame work of chui and shi @xcite , the phi - transform theory of band limited dual frames for triebel ",

    "( and frazier and jawerth @xcite , bui and paluszyski @xcite , and li and sun @xcite ) is the fact that a sufficiently dense oversampling of translations and dilations must yield approximate reconstruction in any reasonable function space , for any reasonable analyzer and synthesizer .",
    "the reason is that by the caldern reproducing formula , perfect reconstruction holds in the limit of infinite oversampling ( the case of continuous parameter translations and dilations ) .",
    "unfortunately , those papers do not specify the degree of oversampling required to guarantee their conclusions .",
    "in other words , the dilation factor @xmath26 must lie sufficiently close to @xmath45 and the translation step @xmath27 sufficiently close to @xmath67 , but _ how _ close would constitute `` sufficiently close '' is simply not specified .",
    "theorem  [ invertible ] avoids oversampling completely , by constructing a criterion that is usable for fixed values of @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "further , the theorem relaxes the band limitation of frazier and jawerth , so that one may treat non - band limited examples such as the mexican hat .",
    "the cost of that relaxation is merely that the frame operator yields approximate rather than perfect reconstruction : our frame operator is bijective rather than equalling the identity .",
    "let us now contrast our work with the established theory of _ orthonormal _ wavelets .",
    "in that setting , the frame operator gives perfect reconstruction on @xmath8 and is bounded on other function spaces such as @xmath1 and @xmath0 , assuming reasonable smoothness and decay of the wavelet .",
    "the frame operator therefore equals the identity on those spaces , simply by density of @xmath8 , and thus one obtains wavelet expansions in whole families of function spaces @xcite . in this current paper",
    ", we do not assume orthonormality or perfect reconstruction on @xmath8 .",
    "we assume instead that the difference between the frame operator and the identity has small norm in @xmath8 .",
    "the challenge in theorem  [ invertible ] is to show ( under suitable hypotheses ) that the norm of this difference remains small when considered in the hardy space and @xmath2 , so that the frame operator is bijective on those spaces .",
    "our work is unrelated also to multiresolution analyses that generate pairs of perfectly reconstructing analyzers and synthesizers , such as @xcite .",
    "such methods do not apply to the mexican hat wavelet , for example , because it satisfies no scaling or refinement equation .",
    "theorem  [ invertible ] takes a different approach : it finds sufficient conditions for a given analyzer and synthesizer to generate a frame - like structure .",
    "we employ the fourier transform with @xmath68 in the exponent , @xmath69 so that parseval s identity says @xmath70 .",
    "next we specify the norms to be used on hardy space and @xmath2 , and define the caldern  zygmund operators that will act upon those spaces . as always , we write @xmath71 .",
