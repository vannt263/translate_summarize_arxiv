    "there has been a recent resurgence of research on the magnetoelectric ( me ) effect , which describes the coupling between electricity and magnetism.@xcite the linear me effect is defined as @xmath4 where the polarization @xmath5 is linearly induced by an external magnetic field @xmath6 , or the magnetization is linearly generated by an applied electric field @xmath7 . here indices @xmath8 and @xmath9 denote the cartesian directions and @xmath10 is the vacuum permeability .",
    "this coupling between electricity and magnetism is of fundamental interest and shows broad potential for technological applications .",
    "the history of research on the me effect dates back to the 1960s when the magnetic symmetry started to be emphasized .",
    "it was first realized by landau and lifshitz that the me response is only allowed in media without time - reversal symmetry or inversion symmetry.@xcite in 1959 , dzyaloshinskii predicted that @xmath3 should be a me crystal@xcite based on its magnetic point group , and experiments successfully measured the linear induced magnetization by an external electric field @xcite and the inverse effect.@xcite the early theoretical studies and explanations for the me effect were based on phenomenological models@xcite that typically do not distinguish carefully between microscopic mechanisms .",
    "the recent rapid development of first - principles methods@xcite has now allowed the underlying mechanisms in different materials to be classified and investigated .    the linear me effect can be decoupled into three contributions , namely electronic ( frozen - ion ) , ionic ( lattice - mediated ) , and strain - mediated responses.@xcite each term can be further subdivided into spin and orbital contributions .",
    "the early _ ab - initio _ studies were focused on the spin - lattice @xcite and spin - electronic @xcite terms .",
    "first - principles methods have only recently been developed to calculate the full me response tensor @xmath0 including both spin and orbital contributions.@xcite as the symmetry condition for the strain - mediated term is more restrictive , this term is absent in most bulk materials .",
    "previous studies have shown that the spin - lattice term is dominant in many materials , as for example in @xmath3.@xcite iguez has shown @xcite that the lattice contribution can be written as a product of the born charge , the force - constant inverse , and the dynamical magnetic charge , which is the magnetic analogue of the dynamical born charge .",
    "this dynamical magnetic charge is defined as @xmath11 here @xmath12 is the volume of the unit cell containing @xmath13 atoms and @xmath14 denotes a periodicity - preserving sublattice displacement , where @xmath15 is a composite label running from 1 to @xmath16 to represent the atom and its displacement direction .",
    "the magnetic charge tensor @xmath2 plays an important role in various lattice - mediated magnetic responses and contributes to the lyddane - sachs - teller relationship in magnetoelectric materials,@xcite but the mechanisms that give rise to it are not yet well understood .",
    "in particular , one route to optimizing the magnetoelectric coupling is clearly to enhance @xmath2 , but it is not obvious how to do so .    in this work ,",
    "we use first - principles density functional methods to study the dynamical magnetic charges in two materials and explore the different mechanisms responsible for them in these two cases .",
    "we first study the magnetic charges in @xmath3 , which are driven by the spin - orbital coupling ( soc ) mechanism",
    ". then we study a fictitious structure , `` kitpite , '' which was reported to have a large spin - lattice me coupling according to a previous theory.@xcite the structure of kitpite is such that the superexchange interactions between mn moments are frustrated , leading to a 120@xmath17 noncollinear spin structure .",
    "our study shows that the @xmath2 values , which are orders of magnitude stronger than in @xmath3 , are responsible for the strong me coupling .",
    "we find that this enhancement is present even when soc is completely absent , thus confirming that it arises from exchange striction acting on the non - collinear spins , in contrast to the case of @xmath3 where @xmath2 is driven only by soc effects .",
