    "in the last several years evidence for the occurrence of stripe and related orders has accumulated in many underdoped cuprates .",
    "static charge and spin stripes have long been known to occur in some la - based cuprates@xcite .",
    "other cuprates have been thought to have incipient stripe ordering (  dynamic stripes \" ) which can be pinned locally around impurities or near vortex cores in the low temperature superconducting state .",
    "such pinning of incipient stripe order is routinely observed in stm experiments in the bi - based@xcite and oxychloride@xcite cuprates .",
    "further a number of phenomena in the ybco family have indicated the possible role of incipient stripe order .",
    "quantum oscillations@xcite seen in high magnetic field and low temperature have been interpreted@xcite in terms of the reconstruction of a large fermi surface by stripe order .",
    "such a fermi surface reconstruction might also explain the sign of the hall effect@xcite and various other transport properties of underdoped ybco at low temperature and in high magnetic fields@xcite .",
    "several experiments also show that ybco undergoes a rapid crossover to a regime of enhanced orthorhombicity at a temperature that roughly tracks the pseudogap temperature@xcite .",
    "this is reasonably associated with enhanced electronic nematic order which is naturally a precursor of stripe order .",
    "most recently direct evidence for charge stripes in ybco has been obtained in an nmr experiment in high magnetic fields@xcite .",
    "the stripe ordering seems to disappear with increasing doping .",
    "the fermi surface of overdoped tl-2201 has been mapped out in great detail through angle dependent magnetoresistance studies@xcite , quantum oscillations@xcite , and angle resolved photoemission experiments@xcite .",
    "all these probes clearly and convincingly demonstrate the existence of a large band structure - like fermi surface at low temperature .",
    "the absence of any fermi surface reconstruction strongly suggests the absence of stripe ordering .",
    "these developments sketch a picture of the evolution of the low temperature  underlying normal \" state electronic properties upon moving from the overdoped to the underdoped side .",
    "decreasing doping tends to produce stripe ordering which reconstructs the large fermi surface .",
    "it is natural then to expect the existence of a quantum phase transition between the large fermi surface metal and a stripe ordered metal with reconstructed small fermi pockets .",
    "such a transition , if second order , might conceivably play a role in the mysterious phenomena characterizing the strange metal regime of optimally doped cuprates .",
    "this viewpoint is advocated e.g. by taillefer in ref . .",
    "despite this strong motivation , there is very little theoretical understanding of such quantum phase transitions . in a weakly interacting fermi liquid",
    "the stripe order may be viewed simply as a uni - directional charge density wave ( cdw ) or spin density wave ( sdw ) .",
    "the transition to this kind of order may then be described in terms of a fluctuating order parameter coupled to the particle - hole continuum of the metallic fermi surface .",
    "such a theory was formulated by hertz@xcite and others in the 1970s and has received enormous attention over the years . despite this the theory is very poorly understood in two space dimensions ( the case relevant to cuprates ) .",
    "very interesting recent work shows that the low energy physics involves strong coupling between the various gapless degrees of freedom - the resulting theory currently has no controlled description and remains to be understood@xcite .    in light of this , and in light of the fact that the cuprates are in any case unlikely to be correctly described as weakly interacting fermi liquids , it is natural to explore alternate strong coupling approaches to phase transitions associated with stripe ordering@xcite and the associated fermi surface reconstruction .",
    "specifically it is interesting to view this transition as a melting of stripe order by quantum fluctuations .",
    "could the stripes melt through a continuous quantum phase transition ?",
    "what is the nature of the resultant melted phase ?",
    "how does the metallic fermi surface affect ( and is affected by ) such a putative continuous stripe melting transition ?",
    "what is the correct description of the universal singularities associated with such a stripe melting quantum critical point ?    in a recent short paper we initiated a study of these questions with the main goal of explaining some old neutron scattering experiments in the cuprates . in this paper",
    "we expand in detail the ideas on stripe melting we discussed in our earlier work@xcite .",
    "we provide a few concrete and tractable examples of continuous stripe melting transitions in the presence of a metallic fermi surface .",
    "as expected the stripe melting is accompanied by a reconstruction of the metallic fermi surface .",
    "remarkably despite this right at the quantum critical point the critical stripe fluctuations decouple dynamically from the particle - hole continuum of the fermi surface and are described by a strongly coupled though tractable quantum field theory . in the language of renormalization group theory",
    "the coupling of the stripe fluctuations to the fermi surface is a  dangerously irrelevant \" perturbation - though it is irrelevant at the critical fixed point it is relevant at the stripe ordered fixed point and leads to the fermi surface reconstruction .",
    "one consequence of this dangerous irrelevance is that close to the quantum melting transition , the energy scale associated with the onset of stripe order is parametrically larger than the energy scale at which the fermi surface reconstructs .",
    "we determine the universal critical singularities both of the stripe order parameter and of the electronic excitations at the hot spots on the fermi surface that are connected to each other by the stripe ordering wavevector .",
    "the stripe melting transitions discussed in this paper and in our earlier work@xcite are obtained by proliferating some but not all topological defects of the stripe order parameter .",
    "the resulting stripe melted phase retains a memory of the long range stripe ordered phase by possessing gapped excitations associated with the unproliferated topological defects .",
    "phases of this kind were proposed by zaanen@xcite and co - workers and further explored in refs . .",
    "despite having the same symmetries , these are _ not _ regular fermi liquids , due to the unproliferated defects . a clear distinction between these non - trivial stripe liquid phases and the regular fermi liquid lies in the topological structure ,",
    "i.e. the former have ground state degeneracies on non - trivial manifolds .",
    "while this difference is completely sharp theoretically , it is very difficult to detect with any conventional experimental probe .",
    "in particular these phases have large fermi surfaces with landau quasiparticle excitations described within the usual fermi liquid theory paradigm .",
    "their single - electron properties , transport and low - energy thermodynamics are fermi - liquid like , thus such phases may have easily been mistaken for fermi liquids .",
    "the topological structure associated with the unproliferated defects leads to a fractionalization of the stripe order parameter - this is extremely difficult to probe in experiments .",
    "we provide a simple physical picture of the stripe fluctuations that lead to this kind of stripe melted phase . when the stripes melt the resulting ground state will in general be a quantum superposition of arbitrary stripe configurations .",
    "the fluctuating stripe phases described in this paper may be pictured as ones in which the stripes form closed loops of arbitrary size while they fluctuate ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : slm ] ) . cutting a stripe loop open to leave an open end for a stripe costs a finite energy and describes an excited state .",
    "such an open end is precisely the gapped unproliferated topological defect that survives the stripe melting transition .",
    "this picture is justified and elaborated in detail below .",
    "we thus dub such phases  stripe loop metals \" . in contrast",
    "the conventional fermi liquid may be viewed as consisting of fluctuating stripes of all kinds including ones with open ends in its ground state .    in the early work",
    "such a stripe loop metal was suggested as a candidate for the underdoped cuprates .",
    "as it seems extremely unlikely that the  underlying \" normal state in the underdoped cuprates has a large unreconstructed fermi surface the stripe loop fermi liquid is unlikely to occur in the underdoped side .",
    "it is more interesting therefore to explore the possibility that it may describe the  normal \" ground state of the overdoped cuprates .",
    "indeed none of the existing experimental probes of the overdoped normal state are in a position to distinguish between such a stripe - fractionalized fermi liquid and the conventional fermi liquid .",
    "further as we demonstrate in this paper the stripe loop fermi liquid admits a direct and interesting second order transition to the stripe ordered metal with a reconstructed fermi surface .",
    "however our results also demonstrate that the corresponding critical stripe fluctuations can not by themselves account for most of the observed non - fermi liquid physics around optimal doping in the cuprates .",
    "nevertheless as we discuss , this kind of stripe melting transition may contain interesting lessons to at least understand the nature of stripe fluctuations near optimal doping .",
    "quantum melting transitions between the stripe ordered metal and the conventional fermi liquid are more challenging to address , and we leave them for the future .",
    "apart from developing an intuitive description of the stripe loop metal phase , we also discuss several experimental consequences of the theory of the quantum phase transition to the stripe ordered metal .",
    "the availability of a theory of a continuous stripe melting transition enables us to reliably address the phenomenon of fermi surface reconstruction across such a transition .",
    "for instance we determine how the gap opens at the hot spot as the transition is approached from the stripe melted side and the growth of the quasiparticle weight in the folded portion of the reconstructed fermi surface in the stripe ordered phase .",
    "we also study the issue of the low temperature superconducting instability of the metal and its interplay with the stripe melting . not surprisingly we find that the energy scale of the superconducting instability is enhanced as the stripe quantum critical point is approached from either side .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : problems ] we discuss some of the challenges presented to theory by well known experimental results@xcite .",
    "we then set the stage for discussing phase transitions by first describing various possible stripe order parameters that are of relevance for the cuprates in section [ sec : orderpara ] . in section [ sec : phasedia ] we discuss possible phase diagrams for stripe melting transitions and the associated defects in the order parameters .",
    "the concept of `` stripe loop metals '' is introduced in section [ sec : slm ] and connected to the corresponding quantum field theories . in section",
    "[ sec : chargemelting ] the theories of several charge - stripe melting transitions are presented in detail .",
    "spin - stripe melting transitions are discussed in section [ sec : spin1 ] . in section [ sec : single ] we calculate single particle properties close to the phase transitions . the possibility of pairing by stripe fluctuations within our theory is analyzed in section [ sec : pair ] . in section [ sec : exps ]",
    "we review some results of scaling theory applied to fluctuating stripes .",
    "we discuss some existing experimental results as well as predictions of our theory for future experiments .",
    "some more technical details can be found in the appendices .",
    "if quantum criticality associated with onset of stripe order is held responsible for the physics of the strange metal in the cuprates , then it is very important to experimentally establish that critical stripe fluctuations occur in the strange metal regime .",
    "there is actually very little information from experiments on critical stripe fluctuations in near optimal cuprates above their superconducting transition termperature .    in an important and well - known experiment ,",
    "aeppli et .",
    "@xcite measured the dynamic spin - susceptibility of slightly underdoped ( @xmath0 ) lsco near @xmath1 over a wide range of temperatures and wave - vectors .",
    "however as emphasized in our previous work@xcite the results paint a very intriguing picture of the stripe fluctuations and pose a challenge to theory . from the scaling of the width of the neutron scattering peak ( the inverse correlation length ) with temperature they deduced that the dynamical exponent @xmath2 .",
    "they further found that for low frequencies the peak height scales as @xmath3 . within @xmath4",
    "scaling , a standard scaling argument shows that this implies an anomalous exponent @xmath5 for the critical spin fluctuations ( see sec .",
    "[ spinscaling ] ) .",
    "such a large value of the anomalous dimension @xmath6 of the spin - fluctuations is very unusual for a landau quantum critical point , but it is quite common for non - landau quantum critical points@xcite . later on in this paper",
    "we provide a careful discussion of the data of ref . and highlight the need for further experimental studies .     as measured in ref . via arpes , shown in the first brillouin zone .",
    "left : hot - spots on the fermi surface that are connected by the sdw wave vectors .",
    "right : hot - spots of the cdw wave - vectors . ]",
    "we would like to emphasize that in a metal , @xmath7 is very surprising . since the stripe - ordering vector @xmath8 connects two points on the fermi - surface ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : vectors ] ) , the stripe - fluctuations should be landau damped .",
    "the propagator of the stripe fluctuations is expected to be modified as ( see fig . [",
    "fig : bosonselfenergy ] ) @xmath9 where the damping rate @xmath10 is determined by the properties of the conduction electrons close to hot spots , i.e. points on the fermi - surface which are connected by @xmath8 . for small frequencies @xmath11 the quadratic term can be neglected against the damping term and the stripe fluctuations become strongly coupled to the fermi surface . in particular",
    ", we see that @xmath12 , where @xmath13 , i.e. the dynamical exponent @xmath14 .",
    "recent careful analyses@xcite show that at low energies the stripe fluctuations couple even more strongly to the fermi - surface , and higher order contributions become important .",
    "there is currently no controlled description of the resulting theory .",
    "this form of the landau damping is not unique to the weakly interacting fermi liquid but rather general in the presence of gapless excitations into which a stripe fluctuation can decay . in appendix",
    "[ app : damping ] we demonstrate this explicitly for several known non - fermi liquid metals .    the data of ref",
    ". shows dynamical exponent of @xmath7 over all measured temperatures , i.e. no evidence of the expected strong coupling to the fermi surface is seen .",
    "of course , once a single - particle gap develops , a low - energy stripe fluctuation can no longer decay into particle - hole excitations and effectively decouples from the fermi - surface .",
    "this does not require phase - coherence and is therefore already possible in the pseudogap phase .",
    "while such an opening of a gap would explain the observed @xmath7 below the pseudogap temperature @xmath15 , it would also predict a dramatic change in the nature of the stripe - correlations upon crossing @xmath15 . above @xmath15 the stripe fluctuations",
    "are strongly coupled to and modified by the gapless fermi surface , while below @xmath15 they decouple .",
    "however in the data of ref . , the measured spin - correlations develop smoothly across the pseudogap temperature , which for @xmath16 lsco is around 150 k@xcite .",
    "the apparent message from the experiments is that the critical stripe fluctuations are indifferent to the fate of the electronic fermi surface .",
    "this has also been emphasized by other neutron studies of the cuprates where magnetic scattering near the incommensurate peaks seems to not know about the particle / hole continuum of the fermi surface at low energies@xcite .",
    "this state of affairs in experiments should be contrasted with the emerging picture from modern clarifications@xcite of the standard weak coupling `` hertz - millis '' approach to stripe ordering quantum phase transitions : in this theory the stripe fluctuations become more and more strongly coupled to the fermi surface at low energy .    given this stark contradiction ,",
    "we therefore focus our attention on an alternate theory of the stripe ordering transition which describes it as a quantum melting of stripes by proliferation of topological defects .",
    "throughout the paper we will use the term `` stripe '' as a collective term for various kinds of charge density wave ( cdw ) and spin density wave ( sdw ) states . with the cuprates in mind , we focus on two - dimensional systems ( a single copper - oxygen plane ) with an underlying orthorhombic or tetragonal lattice .",
    "the simplest stripe pattern is a    1 .   _",
    "unidirectional charge stripe_. here the expectation value of the charge is modulated at some wavevector @xmath17 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : static ] ) , i.e. @xmath18 where @xmath19 creates a spin @xmath20 electron at @xmath21 and summation over spin indices is implied .",
    "such unidirectional stripe patters occur naturally in orthorhombic crystals , where there is a preferred direction for @xmath17 . in tetragonal crystals unidirectional order",
    "is possible by spontaneously breaking the lattice rotation symmetry ( in addition to the lattice translation symmetry along @xmath17 ) .",
    "this case is frequently referred to as _",
    "smectic _ in the literature .",
    "+ when the ordering vector @xmath17 is commensurate with the lattice , i.e. @xmath22 , where @xmath23 are integers , this is referred to as a phase with _",
    "commensurate charge stripes_. for the cuprates , commensurate stripes with @xmath24 and a period of @xmath25 are most commonly observed experimentally .",
    "2 .   in a _ unidirectional spin stripe _ the expectation value of the spin undergoes spatial modulations , i.e. @xmath26 for _ collinear _ spin order ,",
    "i.e. @xmath27 , it follows that @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a real vector .",
    "a further possibility is _ spiral _ order , i.e. @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are real vectors with @xmath33 . with the cuprates in mind , we consider collinear spin - stripes exclusively . in the cases of interest here , sdw order at @xmath34",
    "will be accompanied by cdw order at @xmath35 . in a weak coupling , landau - ginzburg approach , this follows since the charge density has the same symmetries as the _ square _ of the spin density .",
    "since the ordering wave - vectors of charge and spin are tied together , it is sufficient to name either one .",
    "we will adopt the convention that the period of a commensurate stripe refers to the charge sector , i.e. a `` period-@xmath36 stripe '' has period @xmath36 for the charge , but period @xmath37 for spin ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : neel ] ) .",
    "+    + it is often convenient to express a spin - configuration not in terms of the spin directly , but in terms of the nel - vector ( see fig . [",
    "fig : neel ] ) .",
    "in particular , in the experimentally observed _ antiphase _ stripes , the nel - vector changes sign between two adjacent charge stripes .",
    "3 .   on a tetragonal lattice , in addition to the above , a _ checkerboard _ pattern which respects the lattice rotation symmety is possible . here",
    "the charge and spin - densities have equal modulations in both the @xmath38 and @xmath39 directions , i.e. @xmath40 and likewise for the spin - density .",
    "all of these ordering patterns are of relevance in the cuprates , and we will discuss them in turn .",
    "before addressing the quantum phase transition in detail , we will now briefly discuss a possible phase diagram and some properties of the phases which we consider .",
    "the limiting cases are , on the one hand , the usual fermi - liquid with a large fermi surface which respects all symmetries of the underlying crystalline lattice . on the other hand , there are various striped phases where translation symmetry is broken by static spin and charge order as discussed in the previous section . in these phases the original large fermi - surface is reconstructed . as a striped phase undergoes a transition ( or a sequence of transitions ) into the fermi - liquid , the symmetries broken by stripe - order are restored . depending on the stripe order in question ,",
    "these are spin - rotation , lattice rotation and lattice translations symmetry . in general",
    ", there may be intermediate phases where only a subset of the symmetries are restored .",
    "for example , when spin - rotation symmetry is restored but lattice symmetries remain broken , a spin - striped phase turns into a phase with charge - stripes only .",
    "intermediate phases without stripe - order are also possible , e.g. a spin - nematic phase where lattice symmetries are restored but spin rotation symmetry remains broken .",
    "just like melting of an ordinary crystal , the melting of stripes is most conveniently described in terms of defects in the stripe order . in the limiting case of perfect long - range stripe order ,",
    "no defects are present .",
    "the fermi liquid lies in the opposite limit , where stripe order is completely destroyed and the number of defects is no longer well defined , i.e. it may be viewed as a condensate of all possible defects .",
    "intermediate phases can be realized ( and characterized ) by proliferating only a subset of allowed defects .    before addressing the phase transition ,",
    "it is necessary to identify the possible topological defects .",
    "we begin by considering incommensurate , unidirectional spin and charge stripes . to allow for defects",
    "we must allow the order parameters to vary in space and time .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the phases of the stripe - order parameters as @xmath41}\\cdot { \\boldsymbol{r}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath42 has the interpretation of being ( @xmath43 times ) the local displacement of the stripes in the @xmath44-direction at time @xmath45 .",
    "the fundamental topological defects are a ) dislocations where the phase of the spin - order winds by @xmath46 and @xmath29 rotates by @xmath46 and b ) dislocations where the phase of the spin order @xmath47 winds by @xmath48 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : dis ] ) . around these defects",
    "the phase of the charge stripe @xmath49 winds by @xmath48 and @xmath50 , respectively .",
    "we will hence refer to defects of type a ) as single dislocations and to defects of type b ) as double dislocations .",
    "spin order is frustrated around single dislocations but not around double dislocations ( see fig . [",
    "fig : dis ] ) . in the commensurate case of a period @xmath36 charge - stripe @xmath51",
    "we can also have elementary oriented domain walls where the entire stripe - pattern is shifted by one lattice spacing ( @xmath52 increases by @xmath53 ) .",
    "a single dislocation is then located at the point where @xmath36 such domain walls meet ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : walls ] ) .            in a conventional ( weak coupling )",
    "approach , the stripe melting is described as an @xmath54-transition for the charge - stripe order parameter @xmath55 . at this transition ,",
    "_ all _ dislocations proliferate and the resulting state is the fermi liquid .",
    "however , in the presence of a fermi surface , this approach becomes problematic for the reasons discussed in section [ sec : problems ] .",
    "it is then natural to ask whether these complications are still present at a modified transition where only certain dislocations proliferate .    a physical mechanism that may lead to a situation where some , but not all defects proliferate was already mentioned above .",
    "we have seen that when spin order is present , it is frustrated around single dislocations .",
    "this raises the energy cost of such dislocations@xcite , potentially even above the energy of double dislocations which are not frustrated .",
    "thermal melting by proliferating double dislocations was studied for spin stripes in ref . and",
    "for a striped superconductor / the larkin - ovchinnikov ( lo ) state in refs . .",
    "quantum melting of the lo state was discussed in a cold - atoms context in ref . .",
    "even in the absence of long - range spin order , strong short - range spin correlations may significantly raise the core - energy of single dislocations . in this paper",
    "we thus explore a stripe melting transition where double dislocations proliferate , while single dislocations remain gapped . in the resulting stripe liquid phase ,",
    "all lattice symmetries are restored .",
    "this phase was first proposed by zaanen@xcite and co - workers and further explored in refs . .",
    "despite having the same symmetries , it is _ not _ the regular fermi liquid due to the gapped single dislocations .",
    "a clear distinction between the non - trivial stripe liquid phase and the fermi liquid lies in the topological structure , i.e. the former has a ground state degeneracy on non - trivial manifolds .",
    "while this difference is completely sharp theoretically , it is extremely difficult to probe experimentally . in particular",
    ", the stripe liquid phase has the same large fermi surface with well defined landau quasiparticles as the weakly interacting fermi liquid .",
    "its single - electron properties , transport and low - energy thermodynamics are also identical , thus this phase may have easily been mistaken for a fermi liquid . a detailed discussion of this phase along with a more physical picture is given in section [ sec : slm ] .",
    "above we saw that the order parameters @xmath56 and @xmath29 are intertwined only around single dislocations , while around double dislocations they are independent .",
    "thus at energies well below the core energy of single dislocations , @xmath57 and @xmath29 become separately well defined ( this will be explained more formally in section [ sec : gauge ] ) .",
    "we can envisage four different phases ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sn2 ] ) , in all of which the single dislocations are gapped . first , @xmath58 , @xmath59 is the ordered phase with both spin and charge order .",
    "second , @xmath60 , @xmath59 describes a phase with a charge stripes but without spin order .",
    "third when @xmath58 , @xmath61 , lattice symmetries and time reversal symmetries are restored .",
    "thus in this phase the spin expectation value @xmath62 but spin rotation symmetry is broken by a spin quadrupole moment @xmath63 ( such a phase is frequently referred to as spin nematic ) .",
    "finally @xmath64 describes the non - trivial stripe liquid we mentioned above and which we discuss in detail in the following section .     which separates the four phases discussed in the text .",
    "the dashed line is parametrized by @xmath65 . ]    in the presence of itinerant fermions the two latter phases have a conventional large fermi surface while in the striped phases with @xmath66 the fermi surface is reconstructed by the stripe order .",
    "as we mentioned above , the distinction between the stripe liquid metal obtained after proliferation of paired dislocations and the regular fermi - liquid is topological and thus difficult to detect . on a pictorial level",
    ", however , the difference between these phases becomes very intuitive , by looking at the charge density @xmath67 . in a perfectly stripe - ordered phase",
    "all the stripes extend across the entire system , and there are no stripe endings . in the regular fermi liquid ,",
    "all kinds of fluctuations are allowed , in particular there are dislocations where stripes end ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : slm ] ) .",
    "we are instead interested in a stripe liquid phases where only double dislocations are allowed . introducing any number of ( static ) paired dislocations into a stripe ordered",
    "phase turns the stripe pattern into a set of _ closed _ stripe - loops . in the stripe liquid phase , where these dislocations proliferate",
    ", there will thus be a fluctuating pattern of stripe - loops , but no stripe endings ( see fig . [",
    "fig : slm ] ) .",
    "indeed , this picture can be made precise by connecting the stripe patterns to features of the field theory , which we will demonstrate below . to see the topological nature of the slm it is useful to consider the system on a cylinder , around which the stripes wind in the ordered phase . in the slm phase ,",
    "all fluctuations of stripes are allowed , as long as there are no loose ends .",
    "thus the number of _ closed _ charge stripes winding around the cylinder is conserved _ mod 2 _ ( see fig . [",
    "fig : top ] ) .",
    "there are two ground states which are distinct by the parity @xmath68 of closed stripes around the cylinder .",
    "the distinction between these two states is clearly topological , i.e. can not be determined by just looking at any finite region of the cylinder .      to make the stripe loop representation of these phases more precise we now connect it to the corresponding field - theory . formally to express the physical order parameters in terms of @xmath57 and @xmath29 , i.e. @xmath69 the phase @xmath47 of @xmath57 should fall in the interval @xmath70 $ ] .",

    "we can independently change the sign of both @xmath57 and @xmath29 without affecting the physical order parameters . as this _ emergent _ gauge degree of freedom is an artifact of our chosen representation of the operators ,",
    "any physical operator must be a gauge - invariant combination of these operators .",
    "in particular , inverting eq .",

    "we now consider a loop enclosing a single defect where @xmath52 winds by @xmath48 , i.e. @xmath86 .",
    "( [ eqn : loops ] ) requires that around this loop @xmath87 we have seen that single dislocations in @xmath88 corresponds to a @xmath72 gauge flux of @xmath46 in the gauge theory .",
    "such an excitation ( see fig . [",
    "fig : vis ] ) is usually referred to as a vison .",
    "therefore the transition between fermi liquid and the slm is described as a confinement transition of the @xmath72 gauge theory , where visons are gapped in the _ deconfined _ phase ( slm ) while they proliferate in the _ confined _ phase ( fl ) . at the deconfinement transition ,",
    "both @xmath57 and @xmath29 are massive and do not significantly affect the critical properties of the gauge theory . however , the phase of the gauge theory has important consequences for the @xmath57 and @xmath29 fields . as long as the visons are gapped , @xmath57 and @xmath29",

    "stripe order has also been invoked to reconstruct a large fermi surface to obtain pockets which may explain quantum oscillation phenomena in a magnetic field at low-@xmath198 , and hall effect and other measurements .",
    "in contrast there is very little evidence for stripe ordering in the overdoped side .",
    "a natural suggestion is that a quantum critical point associated with melting of stripe order and the related fermi surface change underlies some of the strange normal state properties around optimal doping .",
    "to apply the results of this paper to the cuprates we first need to postulate that the overdoped metal is a stripe loop metal .",
    "there is very little experimental evidence against such a proposal , and so it is worthwhile to examine our results further . as proposed in our earlier work@xcite and discussed further in this paper , the ` mother ' multicritical fixed point where the charge and spin stripe orders simultaneously quantum melt into an overdoped stripe loop metal might potentially control the physics of the stripe fluctuations around optimal doping in the strange metal regime .",
    "this proposal finds some support in well known early experiments of aeppli et al@xcite on near - optimal la@xmath331sr@xmath332cuo@xmath333 providing an explanation of both the scaling of the peak width and peak height as a function of temperature / frequency .",

    "a disappointing aspect of our results is that the critical stripe fluctuations associated with the transition to the stripe loop metal are not capable of producing most of the observed non - fermi liquid physics of the strange metal regime .",
    "in particular the electron quasiparticle remains well defined even at the stripe melting quantum critical point . given the success of our theory in describing the observed stripe fluctuations in neutron data one possibility is simply that the physics driving the strange metal non - fermi liquid is not stripe quantum criticality ( contrary to the proposal of ref . ) .",
    "we suggest that our theory correctly describes the stripe sector which decouples dynamically from the electronic fluctuations of a non - fermi liquid metal at the stripe quantum critical point .",

    "<S> we study theoretically quantum melting transitions of stripe order in a metallic environment , and the associated reconstruction of the electronic fermi surface . </S>",
    "<S> we show that such quantum phase transitions can be continuous in situations where the stripe melting occurs by proliferating pairs of dislocations in the stripe order parameter without proliferating single dislocations . </S>",
    "<S> we develop an intuitive picture of such phases as  stripe loop metals \" where the fluctuating stripes form closed loops of arbitrary size at long distances . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain a controlled critical theory of a few different continuous quantum melting transitions of stripes in metals . at such a ( deconfined ) critical point the fluctuations of the stripe order parameter </S>",
    "<S> are strongly coupled , yet tractable . </S>",
    "<S> they also decouple dynamically from the fermi - surface . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate many universal properties of these quantum critical points . </S>",
    "<S> in particular we find that the full fermi - surface and the associated landau quasiparticles remain sharply defined at the critical point . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the phenomenon of fermi surface reconstruction across this transition and the effect of quantum critical stripe fluctuations on the superconducting instability . </S>",
    "<S> we study possible relevance of our results to several phenomena in the cuprates . </S>"
