    "vanadium sesquioxide v@xmath1o@xmath2 holds a a very special place among the variety of physical systems exhibiting a metal - insulator transition ( mit ) .",
    "this compound is considered as a prototype of a mott - hubbard system : it displays a mit from a paramagnetic metallic ( pm ) phase to an antiferromagnetic insulating ( afi ) phase at low temperatures ( @xmath5 ) , and a transition from a pm phase to a paramagnetic insulating ( pi ) phase at a higher temperature ( @xmath6).@xcite in order to understand several of its properties , the knowledge of its crystal structure plays a fundamental role : in the paramagnetic phase v@xmath1o@xmath2 can be characterized by a corundum cell in which v ions are arranged in v - v pairs along the @xmath7-hexagonal axis and form a honeycomb lattice in the basal @xmath8 plane .",
    "all vanadium ions are equivalent : each v@xmath9ion has @xmath10 configuration and is surrounded by a nearly perfect oxygen octahedron .",
    "however , a slight displacement of vanadium ions away from the centers of their octahedra is at the origin of a small trigonal distortion which removes the three - fold degeneracy of the @xmath3 manifold . a non - degenerate @xmath11 orbital and doubly degenerate @xmath4 orbitals",
    "are then separated by an energy gap measuring the trigonal distortion , @xmath12 .",
    "a first order structural transition takes place upon cooling , and the system becomes monoclinic .",
    "simultaneously , a peculiar antiferromagnetic ( af ) spin order emerges with ferromagnetically ordered planes antiferromagnetically stacked perpendicularly to the monoclinic @xmath13 axis .    in late seventies , castellani ,",
    "natoli and ranninger @xcite ( cnr ) developed the first realistic description of v@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "they realized that the peculiar structure observed in the afi phase could not be explained in terms of a single band hubbard model , and that the introduction of the orbital degrees of freedom into the model was a necessary ingredient in order to explain the experimental findings .",
    "the cnr model has been considered as a reliable model of v@xmath1o@xmath2 until the end of the nineties , when several experiments , e.g. , x - ray absorption spectroscopy by park et al.@xcite and non - resonant magnetic x - ray scattering by paolasini et al .",
    "@xcite have demonstrated that this model was in need of corrections .",
    "the failing of cnr model came from the underestimation of the value of hund s coupling ( @xmath14 ev ) and the subsequent result of a spin - state @xmath15 for @xmath16ions .",
    "instead , all previous experiments independently showed that each vanadium ion has a spin @xmath17 , observation that called for a deep revision of the theoretical description of v@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "for this reason , many theoretical works followed.@xcite in particular , very recently , the nature of the mit in v@xmath1o@xmath2 has been studied by means of lda+dmft approaches .",
    "et al_@xcite have proposed that the mit is of orbital - selective type , and that large changes in the orbital occupation at the transition occur in response to the crystal field changes .",
    "et al_@xcite , with a different lda+dmft approach showed that the crystal field , the correlations , and the orbital degrees of freedom are strongly interrelated .",
    "they also proposed that the trigonal distortion , strongly enhanced by correlations , acts as an external field in the orbital hilbert space , in the same way as a magnetic field acts in the spin space .",
    "these two works@xcite have suggested that drastic modifications in the hybridization of the orbitals due to the correlation effects and the trigonal splitting were at the basis of the change in the population of the orbitals across the transition . despite all this progress in the understanding of the mit in v@xmath1o@xmath2 ,",
    "the controversy about the nature of the low - temperature antiferromagnetic phase remains .",
    "specifically , there are contradictory results on how the two electrons are distributed within the @xmath3 manifold , and whether or not orbital ordering takes place . the lda+u calculation of ezhov _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite suggested that the @xmath17 state with no orbital degeneracy and a purely @xmath4 occupancy is a possible candidate for the low - temperature antiferromagnetic phase .",
    "this idea , _ mutatis mutandis _ , is present also in the lda+dmft calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite on the contrary used an old idea by allen @xcite that magnetic and optical properties of all the phases of v@xmath1o@xmath2 show a loss of @xmath18-ion identity , and suggested that a good candidate for a ground state is a state in which vanadium ions have @xmath17 and form vertical bonds ( molecules ) with the total spin @xmath19 . in our previous study@xcite",
    ", we showed using a different correlated model that the molecular state can be stabilized throughout the crystal only if the correlation energy within the molecule is big compared to the in - plane interaction energy .",
    "this gave a certain region in the parameter space where the molecular solution could be realized .",
    "later , tanaka @xcite proposed that , in order to explain a large contribution from the orbital magnetic moment , @xmath20 ( the minus sign reminds that this contribution is opposite to the spin contribution @xmath21 ) , observed in the non - resonant magnetic scattering experiments by paolasini _",
    "@xcite , the orbital wave function had to be complex .",
    "he argued that spin - orbit coupling plays an important role in determining both the ground state and the low energy excitation spectrum of v@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "this controversy of theoretical results calls for a better quantitative description of the electronic structure of v@xmath1o@xmath2 , which is a starting point for any model - based analysis .",
    "recently , the nmto method has been applied to study the electronic structure of v@xmath1o@xmath2.@xcite surprisingly , after early works by cnr@xcite and by mattheis,@xcite this is the first serious attempt to model complicated electronic structure of v@xmath1o@xmath2 by an effective single particle hamiltonian .",
    "the nmto method provides a way to derive an effective hamiltonian with only few energy - selective wannier - like orbitals by integrating out all others , less important degrees of freedom .",
    "the result is an accurate tight - binding ( tb ) modeling of v@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "the nmto approach shows that oxygen contribution to hopping matrix elements and renormalization effects due to hopping paths via the @xmath4-tails ( in addition to direct v - v @xmath3-hopping paths ) are important and were only partially taken into account in refs .",
    "[ ] . as one can see from table i , the tb hopping parameters obtained by the nmto - downfolding technique differ significantly from the estimates based on the tb fitting performed on the lapw band calculation of mattheiss@xcite or by cnr .",
    "the nmto analysis shows that the hopping through @xmath4-tails mainly influences the parameters in the basal plane .",
    "this is a bonding effect , which leads to an increase of the in - plane matrix elements .",
    "the other contributions via oxygen tails affect mainly the hopping along vertical bonds .",
    "this is an anti - bonding effect which significantly reduces @xmath22 hopping matrix elements .",
    "the latter leads to the decrease of the correlation energy of vertical pairs , in this way reducing the stability of the molecular state .",
    "simultaneous increase of the in - plane interaction energy favors uncorrelated atomic sites , and in the end potentially breaks the molecular state . this new qualitative picture of the ground state of v@xmath1o@xmath2 in the parameter space , suggested by nmto - downfolding method,@xcite calls for re - examination of the variational analysis of the effective hamiltonian in the antiferromagnetic insulating state , which is the main purpose of this paper .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "we first present a brief outline of the results of our previous work , ref .",
    "[ ] and set the notations .",
    "we then minimize the effective hamiltonian we derived using the values of the hopping parameters from ref .",
    "[ ] and performing a variational calculation with two kinds of variational functions : molecular and atomic .",
    "we discuss the result in the light of the experimental facts and try to draw some conclusions for the physics of v@xmath1o@xmath2 .",

    "we assume that the low - temperature afi phase of v@xmath1o@xmath2 can be described by a super - exchange spin - orbital hamiltonian , @xmath23 , that can be derived perturbatively from a three - fold degenerate @xmath3 hubbard hamiltonian , @xmath24 , as done in ref .",
    "[ ] , to which we refer for further details .",
    "we can write the hubbard hamiltonian as : @xmath25 where the kinetic term @xmath26 includes a summation over nearest neighbor ( nn ) sites , over orbital ( @xmath27 ) and spin ( @xmath28 ) indexes .",

    "we shall later use these parameters in the variational analysis where we compare various ground - states energies . for the coulomb repulsion @xmath31 and hund s coupling @xmath32 ezhov _",

    "et al._@xcite suggested @xmath40 ev , @xmath41 ev .",
    "recent optical studies of qazilbash _",
    "et al_@xcite , however , yielded a smaller value for the hund s coupling @xmath42 ev .",
    "we have described already@xcite how the range of these two parameters is subjected to large fluctuations in the literature . in what follows",

    "the term @xmath47 describes the trigonal distortion that splits the three degenerate two - electron states : @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 .",
    "the energy splittings due to this distortion are defined as @xmath63 and @xmath64 for orbitals @xmath65 and 3 , respectively .",
    "@xmath12 is comparable in magnitude to the hopping integrals , which allows us to treat the term @xmath47 on the same level as @xmath23 .",
    "in this section , we compare orbital and magnetic ground - state configurations of the effective hamiltonian @xmath66 as obtained by a variational analysis with tb parameters from mattheiss@xcite and nmto@xcite models",

    "the average value of the @xmath66 over the corresponding state takes the form : @xmath71 \\langle\\psi^o_n|\\langle\\psi^o_m|h^o_{\\rm eff}|\\psi^o_m\\rangle    eff}|\\phi^s_m\\rangle |\\phi^s_n\\rangle \\end{array } \\label{av}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this factorization is possible only in the mean field approximation , in which single - site wave - functions , @xmath70 , otherwise entangled , factor into orbital @xmath72 and spin @xmath68 parts . by this",
    "we explicitly neglect any coupled spin - orbit fluctuations .",
    "the spin averaging is straightforward : for a ferromagnetic bond @xmath73 and @xmath74 , while for an antiferromagnetic bond , @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "orbital averaging in eq.([av ] ) , however , requires some algebra and is discussed in ref .",
    "[ ] for both atomic and molecular states . in the following",
    ", we will first average over all possible ordered magnetic structures , and then for each type of magnetic ordering find an orbital configuration that minimizes the total energy be means of a variational procedure .",
    "note , that we limit the number of magnetically ordered structures only to those that can be realized on the corundum unit cell .    as a preliminary step , before the full minimization of the variational energy ( [ av ] ) , we can compare the correlation energy of the ferromagnetic state of the vertical pair , @xmath77 , with the superexchange energy in the basal plane , in order to have an idea about the relative order of magnitude of atomic and molecular energies .",
    "we remind that the correlation energy is defined as the difference between the exact ground state energy , @xmath78 , and the ground state energy in the hartree - fock approximation , @xmath79 .",
    "the superexchange energy in the basal plane was approximated by @xmath80 in ref .",
    "[ ] , where we assumed that the contributions from @xmath37 and @xmath38 hopping matrix elements were negligible , and should rather be written as @xmath81 with the nmto values of table i , that shows that @xmath37 is no more negligible , whereas @xmath36 it is .",
    "there are two qualitatively different regimes of solutions .",
    "if the correlation energy is larger , the most appropriate variational wave function for the whole @xmath66 must be constructed in terms of molecular units with @xmath82 and orbital part @xmath72 given by @xmath83 where @xmath84 and @xmath85 define two sites of the vertical molecule , and @xmath86 and 0 denote the value of @xmath87 component of the pseudospin operator , defining the orbital state .",
    "if , instead , the values of the exchange energy in the basal plane are larger than the correlation energy , the appropriate variational wave function is atomic - like and should be written as @xmath88 contrary to the molecular case , this wave function allows all three states @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 to be present without any _ a priori _ restriction on their relative weight .",
    "the relative weight of these three states is then determined through the minimization procedure with respect to the variational parameters @xmath92 and @xmath93 .    as quantitatively shown in ref .",
    "[ ] , eqs .",
    "( 6.19 ) and ( 6.20 ) , in order to determine the nature ( atomiclike , molecularlike ) of the ground state , we need to compare the absolute value of the ratio of the molecular correlation energy ( per atom ) and the in - plane exchange energy , computed with mattheiss parameters and new nmto set of parameters .",
    "we obtain @xmath94 and @xmath95 for mattheiss and nmto set , respectively .",
    "the strong reduction of this ratio for nmto set suggests that nmto parameters do not favor the formation of the molecular state .",
    "there are few possible reasons for such large difference in the results of the two approaches",
    ". the discrepancy may be the consequence of the fact that nmto method more accurately treats the effect of trigonal distortion on hopping matrix elements . in the approach of mattheiss the influence of the trigonal distortion on matrix elements",
    "was assumed to be small and was neglected .",
    "as one can see from fig.14 of ref .",
    "[ ] , where structures with varying amount of distortion have been generated , the @xmath22 hopping along vertical bond , @xmath35 , decrease significantly with the increase of the trigonal distortion : nmto estimates are @xmath96 ev , while @xmath97 ev .",
    "the same figure gives much smaller estimate of variation of @xmath35 for cnr model : @xmath98 ev and @xmath99 ev . other reasons of discrepancy , as pointed by the authors of ref .",
    "[ ] themselves , can be traced down to various approximations used in constructing effective orbitals in the nmto - downfolding , and to imprecise knowledge of the value of the covalency v(@xmath100)-o(@xmath101 ) mixing parameter and the charge transfer @xmath102 gap , extracted from nuclear magnetic resonance and photo - emission experiments .",
    "we now perform the minimization of the effective hamiltonian with nmto set of parameters and compare the results with the equivalent minimization procedure performed in ref .",
    "[ ] with mattheiss parameters . as in ref .",
    "[ ] , we examine the following four magnetic phases :    * afm phase  all three in - plane bonds are antiferromagnetic ; * rs phase  one in - plane bond is ferromagnetic and the other two are antiferromagnetic ; ( this is the spin structure experimentally observed in v@xmath1o@xmath2 ) ; * ars phase  one in - plane bond is antiferromagnetic and the other two are ferromagnetic ; * fm phase  all three in - plane bonds are ferromagnetic .",
    "fig.[and ] shows the plot of energy per v - ion , @xmath103 , obtained with molecular ( a ) and atomic ( b ) variational functions using the nmto set of parameters , as a function of hund s coupling @xmath32 and for @xmath104ev . a direct comparison between fig . [ and ] ( a ) and fig .",
    "[ and ] ( b ) shows that for all values of @xmath32 the energy of the atomic state is lower than the energy of the molecular state .",
    "this confirms what we had more qualitatively suggested above  that the molecular state is not supported by the nmto calculations .",
    "the region of stability of experimentally observed rs magnetic structure is again rather small , as we have obtained previously with mattheiss parameters for the molecular state . in this case",
    ", this region also shifts towards a lower value of hund s coupling , @xmath105ev .",
    "this value is close to @xmath42 ev , extracted from optical studies of qazilbash _",
    "et al._@xcite , as well as to the old value @xmath106 ev given by tanabe and sugano@xcite by fitting optical spectra and at odds with the much bigger values ( @xmath107 ev ) recently used in the literature.@xcite    for the orbital structure , the minimization gives the values of the orbital mixing angles @xmath108 and @xmath109 at all sites for the rs configurations , ie , an orbital wave function @xmath110 .",
    "this is the solution without orbital degeneracy as found by ezhov _",
    "et al._.@xcite the absence of @xmath11 electrons in the solution can be understood as follows : the small gain in the kinetic energy , due to the significant reduction of the hopping matrix elements in the nmto calculations , can not compensate the effect of the trigonal splitting , which pushes @xmath11 orbital to higher energies and favors the occupancy of the @xmath111 states on all the atoms . as a result , the ground state is a non - degenerate @xmath4-doublet , and the orbital degeneracy is completely lifted , contrary to the ground states found in ref .",
    "[ ] , where the important @xmath11 contribution to the kinetic energy in the molecule due to the @xmath22 hopping term @xmath35 allowed a finite occupancy of @xmath11 orbitals .",
    "it is worth mentioning that even with mattheiss set of parameters it was possible to find a ground state @xmath112 , however only for larger values of the trigonal splitting @xmath113 ev .",
    "one more remark : due to the competing presence of the afm , ars and fm phases , the stabilization energy of the rs atomic solution is rather small , the first excited state is located about 2 mev above the ground state . despite all differences between the ground state solutions obtained with nmto and mattheiss parameters , this is a common feature which is apparent from fig.[and ] and from figs.5 and 8 of ref . [ ] : both the stability region and the stabilization energy for the the ground state with rs magnetic structure are much reduced in contrast with the spin @xmath15 case considered by cnr@xcite .    to illustrate more completely the properties of the effective spin - orbital model , eq .",
    "[ av ] , in fig .",
    "[ phase ] we present its ground - state phase diagram , in the parameter space specified by @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "all other parameters are taken from the nmto set and we consider the trigonal splitting @xmath116 ev . > from fig.[phase ] it can be seen that the ground state is successively changed from afm to fm magnetic phase as the hund s coupling increased . in order to gain maximum energy from orbital - dependent exchange terms , more complicated magnetic structure are realized at the intermediate values of @xmath32 , and that rs structure is stabilized in a strip between afm and ars phases .",
    "the examination of orbital structure for various ground states , presented on the phase diagram ( fig.[phase ] ) , has shown that orbital configurations in rs and ars states are basically the same : the orbital degeneracy is lifted and all states are occupied by only @xmath4 electrons . for the afm and fm phases",
    "we find a continuum of orbital degeneracies with any mixing angles @xmath92 and @xmath93 , depending on value of the ratio @xmath115 and @xmath114 .",
    "this phase diagram is very different from other phase diagrams , which have been proposed for afi of v@xmath1o@xmath2 , i.e. from that of cnr model,@xcite from the molecular model of shiina _",
    "et al_,@xcite from that proposed by us in ref .",
    "the phase space occupied by rs phase is larger , and it happens at the realistic intermediate values of @xmath115 .",
    "in this paper we have studied the ground state of the effective spin - orbital hamiltonian ( eq . [ simpform ] ) with the nmto set of tb parameters .",
    "we have shown that the formation of stable molecules throughout the crystal is not favorable in this case .",
    "for all values of the hund s coupling the minimization procedure with an atomic wave function gives a lower energy than in the minimization with a molecular wave function .",
    "the analysis of the orbital structure of the ground state shows that the orbital degeneracy is lifted , and that two @xmath3 electrons occupy the degenerate @xmath4 doublet .",
    "we also computed the mean - field phase diagram and showed that the rs structure is realized at realistic intermediate values of the hund s coupling .",
    "the phase space of the rs phase is significantly enlarged compared to our previous study,@xcite although the gain of energy compared to competing phases is again small , of the order of @xmath117 mev . however , in every other aspect , the variational orbital ground state with two @xmath3 electrons occupying the degenerate @xmath4 doublet is in disagreement with the experimental data .",
    "first , it contradicts the observation of unquenched angular momentum ( @xmath118 ) found by paolasini _",
    "et al_@xcite through the use of non - resonant magnetic x - ray scattering .",
    "since @xmath119 over a real ground state , we need to introduce the spin - orbit coupling in the configuration @xmath120 , obtaining the new ground state @xmath121,@xcite where @xmath122 .",
    "unfortunately this state still gives a zero expectation value for the orbital moment , due to its invariance under complex conjugation ( modulo an overall sign ) .",
    "moreover it is now well established @xcite that the resonant @xmath123 monoclinic reflection observed by paolasini _",
    "et al_@xcite is of magnetic origin . specifically , it is due to a mixture of contributions of magnetic octupole and magnetic quadrupole moments of the v atom .",
    "the octupole moment results from a quadrupole - quadrupole @xmath124 x - ray transition of even parity , corresponding to the operator @xmath125 \\otimes \\hat{\\bf r}]^3_q$ ] , whereas the quadrupole moment results from a dipole - quadrupole @xmath126 x - ray transition of odd parity , related to the spherical tensor @xmath127 ^ 2_q$ ] . however , the resonant scattering amplitude ( which is related to the average values of both these operators in the @xmath128 ground state ) vanishes , again due to the invariance of this state under complex conjugation .",
    "yet another discrepancy comes from the fact that the orbital occupation of the @xmath128 state disagrees with the population analysis of the @xmath3 orbitals derived by park _ et al_.@xcite this latter was based on polarized x - ray absorption measurements at the @xmath129 edge of vanadium in v@xmath1o@xmath2 and provided a value of @xmath130 for the @xmath11 orbital occupancy in the afi phase .",
    "finally , a large value of the trigonal splitting @xmath12 together with the same structure of ground state ( @xmath120 ) , as found in the paramagnetic phase@xcite by the same nmto implementation of the lda+dmft approach , would lead to a highly anisotropic nmr line shape , with a sizable quadrupole splitting in the @xmath131v nucleus , and to a highly anisotropic van vleck susceptibility .",
    "in contrast , rubistein@xcite found , back in 1970 , that in the paramagnetic phase of v@xmath1o@xmath2 there is no detectable anisotropy of the knight shift and no observable quadrupole splitting of the nmr spectrum . even earlier , jones@xcite performed susceptibility measurements for various crystalline orientations with respect to the magnetic field direction and found very little anisotropy .",
    "we emphasize instead that all the experimental observations mentioned above are well explained in the framework of the molecular ground state picture@xcite , which works especially well after the inclusion of the spin - orbit interaction and the coupling with the lattice degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "we therefore strongly doubt the applicability of the nmto method to describe the physics of v@xmath1o@xmath2 , even though the method in itself is quite sophisticated for band structure calculations and is certainly in keeping with the localized , hubbard - type of approach to the description of correlated systems .",
    "in fact we note that the difficulties found in the framework of the nmto - method when applied to v@xmath1o@xmath2 reflect a general problem of all lda+u and lda+dmft calculations based on local atomic correlations inside a single vanadium atom .",
    "all these approaches lead essentially to the same kind of ground state , with two @xmath4 electrons in spin one configuration without orbital ordering and an almost empty @xmath11 band .",
    "a similar result was found by cnr in their second paper of the series@xcite , starting with an empirical band structure and an unrestricted hartree - fock calculation , which is very similar to the modern lda+u scheme .    in a previous publication@xcite ,",
    "one of us has already highlighted the main drawbacks of implementation of dft - based ab - initio methods to v@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "this compound is a very peculiar strongly correlated system , in which non - local correlations play an important role .",
    "the molecular ground state of v@xmath1o@xmath2 is stabilized because of these non - local interactions ( e.g. , correlated hopping along vertical bond ) , the physics of which can not be captured within a method based on local interactions .",
    "the nmto - downfolding belongs to the same class of dft _ ab initio _ methods and , therefore , holds all shortcomings of local correlated approaches . stated differently , non - local correlations would lead to non - local one particle effective potentials that might substantially modify the shape and the range of the wannier - like functions .",
    "one step in this direction has been provided by a new generation of correlated non - local quantum chemical _ ab initio _ calculations . in this approach a combined exact diagonalization-_ab initio",
    "_ method ( edabi ) by spalek _",
    "et al_@xcite is used as a promising method to estimate correlated hopping .",
    "this latter is based on a definite procedure of construction of the many - particle trial wave function expressed in terms of an adjustable one particle basis , followed by the solution of a self - adjusted non - local and non - linear wave equation obeyed by the basis functions .",
    "we believe that the edabi method is particularly well suited for treating situations in which the inter - particle correlations are not weak and lead to non - local interactions .    still , the major outcome of the nmto - downfolding method is the realization that in - plane hopping parameters are important and a model of weakly interacting vertical correlated molecules , which neglects in - plane hopping , is grossly oversimplified .",
    "the interactions between molecules , originating from in - plane hopping , are therefore not negligible and should be included into the theory .",

    "<S> motivated by recent results of @xmath0th order muffin - tin orbital ( nmto ) implementation of the density functional theory ( dft ) , we re - examine low - temperature ground - state properties of the anti - ferromagnetic insulating phase of vanadium sesquioxide v@xmath1o@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the hopping matrix elements obtained by the nmto - downfolding procedure differ significantly from those previously obtained in electronic structure calculations and imply that the in - plane hopping integrals are as important as the out - of - plane ones . </S>",
    "<S> we use the nmto hopping matrix elements as input and perform a variational study of the ground state . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the formation of stable molecules throughout the crystal is not favorable in this case and that the experimentally observed magnetic structure can still be obtained in the atomic variational regime </S>",
    "<S> . however the resulting ground state ( two @xmath3 electrons occupying the degenerate @xmath4 doublet ) is in contrast with many well established experimental observations . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the implications of this finding in the light of the non - local electronic correlations certainly present in this compound .    </S>",
