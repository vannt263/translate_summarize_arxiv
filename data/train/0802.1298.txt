    "the first year wmap data combined with the galaxy survey and the supernova ia data favor the phantom energy equation of state of the cosmic fluid @xmath0 ( where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the cosmic energy density and pressure , respectively ) over the einstein cosmological constant ( @xmath3 ) and the quintessence field ( @xmath4 ) @xcite .",
    "the interpretation of this result brings about the possibility that dark energy could be in the form of a phantom field @xcite .",
    "compared to the lagrangian density of a quintessence field @xmath5 , the lagrangian density of the phantom field has a kinetic energy term with the `` wrong '' sign , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath6 .",
    "this``wrong '' sign endows the phantom model of dark energy with two surprising properties .",
    "first , the density of phantom matter increases with the expansion of the universe in such a way that both the scale factor and the phantom energy density can become infinite in a finite comoving time . if this happens , every object in the universe , including galaxies , stars , the earth and nuclei will be torn apart in a finite future in a so - called big rip singularity @xcite .",
    "a second surprising property of the phantom field was found by babichev , dokuchaev and eroshenko @xcite , who showed that accretion of phantom energy will induce the mass of black holes to decrease .",
    "they concluded that the masses of all black holes will vanish before the big rip is reached .",
    "however , in their calculations , they ignored the backreaction of phantom matter on the black hole metric . in a low matter density background , this effect can be safely ignored , but if the matter density of the background is large , for example if it becomes comparable to the black hole density @xmath7 ( @xmath8 is the black hole mass ) , the metric describing this black hole will be modified significantly ; hence , the backreaction must be accounted for in this case .    the purpose of the present paper is to point out that , taking into account the backreaction , the physical black hole mass may not decrease but will rather _ increase _ due to the accretion of phantom matter .",
    "the size of the black hole apparent horizon ( ah ) increases , while that of the cosmic ah decreases , during the evolution of the universe to a big rip .",
    "there exists a moment @xmath9 at which the black hole ah coincides with the cosmological ah , and after which the black hole singularity becomes naked .",
    "a naked singularity is forbidden by the cosmic censorship conjecture @xcite ; in a broad sense , if the latter is correct , it seems that the cosmic censor disallows the existence in nature of not only naked singularities , but also of the cryptic phantom field .    in order to study this issue",
    "we use new exact solutions of the einstein field equations describing dynamical black holes embedded in a friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe driven by phantom energy and accreting this cosmic fluid .",
    "independent motivation for the development of dynamical black hole solutions comes from various areas of theoretical physics including black hole thermodynamics , quantum gravity , and mathematical physics @xcite .",
    "similar issues about the accretion of phantom energy onto wormholes were discussed in @xcite .",
    "we use units in which @xmath10 and this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we discuss how the mcvittie solution can not describe a black hole embedded in a frw background universe .",
    "then , we turn to new solutions and show that a new metric found ( but not studied in detail ) in @xcite can describe a dynamical black hole in a universe driven by dark matter , radiation , or dark energy . in sec .",
    "iii , using the solution of @xcite , we derive the result that the black hole mass will _ increase _ due to the accretion of phantom matter .",
    "iv and vi find the same result for qualitatively different classes of exact solutions , while sec .",

    "@xmath15 is an arbitrary ( positive ) function of the comoving time @xmath16 .",
    "this metric reduces to the familiar spatially flat frw metric as @xmath17 .",
    "so at a first glance , the metric seems to represent a schwarzschild black hole embedded in a spatially flat frw universe @xcite .",
    "however it is argued that , in general , the mcvittie solution can not describe a black hole because it is singular on the 2-sphere @xmath18 ( which reduces to the schwarzschild horizon if @xmath19const . )",
    "@xcite and this singularity is spacelike @xcite .",
    "it is also claimed that the mcvittie metric may describe a point mass located at @xmath20 and embedded in a frw universe .",
    "however , this point mass is , in general , surrounded by the singularity at @xmath21 , which is difficult to interpret .",
    "this singularity was studied in refs .",
    "nolan @xcite showed that this is a weak singularity in the sense that the volume of an object approaching the @xmath21 surface is not shrunk to zero , and therefore the energy density of the cosmic fluid remains finite . on the other hand , the pressure diverges at @xmath21 together with the ricci scalar @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "so , while the mcvittie metric represents some kind of strongly gravitating central object , its physical interpretation is not totally clear and remains the subject of debate @xcite .",
    "the only exception is the schwarzschild- de sitter ( or kttler ) metric , which corresponds to a special case of the mcvittie metric and represents a genuine black hole of constant mass embedded in a de sitter background @xcite .",

    "@xmath28 corresponds @xcite to the hawking - hayward quasi - local mass of the metric  ( eq .  [ eq : ds - dt ] ) and , therefore , the mcvittie no - accretion condition corresponds to constant physical mass of the central object , which is static even when the universe expands or contracts . here instead , following @xcite , the black hole is allowed to accrete cosmic fluid and @xmath28 changes with time .",
    "two distinct processes concur in the time variation of the black hole mass : the first is the radial flow of energy onto the black hole due to the radial motion of the cosmic fluid toward the horizon ( this is a simplified version of the accretion process considered by babichev _",
    "_ ) , possibly supplemented by a radial heat flux , which necessarily requires an imperfect fluid description .",
    "the second process is the variation of the mass enclosed by the black hole apparent horizon due to the motion of the horizon itself ; this process is absent in the mcvittie solution ( in which the singular surface @xmath18 does not expand ) and in the static black hole considered by babichev _",
    "et al . _ , but is present for any dynamical horizon even in the absence of the first accretion process",
    ". however , unless the total mass of the central object is zero ( which could happen , _ e.g. _ , for a spherical shell of exotic matter ) , a radial energy flow is to be expected due to its gravitational pull .",

    "the energy density and pressure depend on both the radius and the comoving time , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 is non - negative .",
    "thanks to the particular form of the metric coefficient @xmath28 , this solution is conformal to a schwarzschild black hole with conformal factor equal to the scale factor of the background universe @xmath15 @xcite , a feature shared with the sultana - dyer solution @xcite ( _ cf . _ also the solutions of ref .",
    "the mass coefficient @xmath28 coincides with the hawking - hayward quasi - local mass of the spacetime  ( eq.[eq : ds - dt ] ) , which should be identified with the physical black hole mass @xcite .",
    "the fact that the latter increases in an expanding universe describes the constant accretion due to the radial energy flux from the surrounding fluid .",
    "the mcvittie condition @xmath25 equivalent to @xmath54 that forbids accretion onto the central object in the mcvittie metric is clearly not imposed in the solutions of @xcite that we use here , allowing accretion to occur .",

    "it is apparent that , when @xmath183 , the metric  ( [ eq : cosmic time ] ) describes a phantom - dominated universe . for simplicity , we set @xmath184 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath185 .",
    "then , the metric  ( [ eq : cosmic time ] ) reduces to @xmath186,\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\nonumber \\\\",

    "( [ eq : ah ] ) has only two physical roots which denote the cosmic ah @xmath138 and the black hole ah @xmath107 , respectively . using eq .",
    "( [ eq : ah ] ) and the definition of @xmath192 , we have plotted the relation between the comoving time @xmath16 and the ahs in fig .",
    "the latter shows that the black hole apparent horizon increases while the cosmic apparent horizon decreases with the blow - up of the phantom scalar field .",
    "there is a moment at which the two horizons coincide and after which both horizons disappear and the black hole singularity becomes naked .",
    "the well - known mcvittie solution can not describe a black hole embedded in a frw universe . on the contrary ,",
    "the new solutions of  @xcite do : the surface @xmath18 is not an event horizon but a 2-sphere contained inside the black hole ah and a conformal killing horizon when @xmath193 .",
    "the energy density and pressure are regular at the ah , contrary to the case of the mcvittie metric in which the pressure diverges on the would - be horizon .",
    "therefore , we adopt the solution  ( [ eq : ds - ph ] ) of faraoni and jacques @xcite to investigate the problem of phantom matter accretion by black holes . we take into account the backreaction , which was ignored in the previous work of babichev _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite . in a low density background",
    "this effect can be safely neglected ; however , if the energy density of the background is large ( _ e.g. _ , if it becomes comparable to the black hole density @xmath194 ) , the metric describing this black hole will be modified significantly .",
    "therefore , backreaction must be part of the picture .    using this solution",
    "we find that , according to both the quasi - local and the generalized misner - sharp mass notions , the black hole mass increases during the cosmic evolution with accretion of the phantom fluid .",
    "first of all , one notes that more than one notion of mass can be employed , and it is not trivial to identify the correct one ( the hawking - hayward quasi - local mass has proved to be the most convenient in previous studies @xcite ) ; this issue is absent when using a constant mass schwarzschild black hole as in @xcite .",
    "the discrepancy between our result of increasing hawking mass and size of the ah , and the decreasing mass property found in @xcite might be explained by the fact that the quasi - local mass does not receive contributions from the negative pressure .    in faraoni and jacques @xcite , there is also a solution ( eq .",
    "( 98 ) ) which yields the opposite result , _",
    "i.e. _ , the black hole mass decreases with the accretion of phantom fluid .",
    "however , that solution requires an outgoing radial energy flux @xmath195 , which is not easy to interpret for an accreting black hole , and could easily explain the decreasing mass . here",
    ", we have shown that , for an inward energy flux , the black hole mass increases even when phantom energy fluid is accreted .    unfortunately , it is not easy to compare our solution to the babichev _",
    "_  solution @xcite directly , as they have ignored the backreaction effect of expansion , while we have simplified our model of fluid flow instead .",
    "the comparison is not straightforward : it is not a simple matter of taking a limit in the relevant equations , because here the relevant black hole mass is taken as the hawking - hayward quasi - local mass for the cosmological black hole immersed in a fluid that sources the surrounding frw universe - this is forced upon us when looking for a meaningful mass concept to use .",
    "when comparing with @xcite , one must replace this quasi - local mass with the schwarzschild mass and neglect its time dependence , which implies setting @xmath196 to a constant and , in turn , means that the background fluid becomes a test fluid ( it no longer causes the cosmic expansion ) .",
    "the crucial difference between our solutions and that of @xcite is that the black hole mass is no longer obtained as a `` mass contrast '' with respect to the background , but it will include both energy density @xmath1 and pressure @xmath2 inside the horizon , thus causing a flow of accreted total energy that is negative ( however , in this regime , the effect on the schwarzschild mass is neglected ) . while we do not doubt that the analysis of @xcite is correct in the test - fluid regime , it is its extrapolation to a gravitating fluid and to an expanding universe that we question , and we can only propose some special classes of exact solutions to further the analysis . because these may be very special , we do not claim that our is the last word on this issue - it is an intermediate step ( but a valuable one because exact solutions are rare ) , and we auspicate that more exact solutions incorporating an explicit radial mass flow be found to discuss this issue further .",
    "the central , and most interesting point of our study , however , is not the behavior of the black hole mass but rather the process in which the black hole ah expands while the cosmic ah shrinks .",
    "when the comoving time derivative of the scale factor approaches the critical value @xmath197 at the time @xmath9 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : tstar ] ) , the two horizons coincide . at times",
    "@xmath97 both horizons disappear and the black hole singularity becomes a naked singularity ; this happens _ before _",
    "the universe reaches the big rip .",
    "the shrinking of the cosmic apparent horizon has serious consequences .",
    "the bekenstein - hawking formula @xmath198 @xcite tells us that the horizon entropy @xmath199 is proportional to the area @xmath200 of its cosmic apparent horizon .",
    "so , the entropy of a phantom energy - dominated universe _ decreases _ , in violation of the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "if the black hole singularity becomes naked in a finite time well before the big rip , the cosmic censorship conjecture is violated . by combining these considerations",
    ", one could go as far as reaching the conclusion that nature may not permit the existence of phantom energy .",
    "there is , however , another consideration to keep in mind : the solution  ( [ eq : ds - ph ] ) ( as well as the similar solutions of @xcite ) is meant to describe a black hole that has existed forever , not one that is created by gravitational collapse . according to the expression  ( [ rb ] ) of the ah radius on which we base our considerations ,",
    "if this black hole is created together with the universe in a big bang singularity , early on the derivative @xmath82 was arbitrarily large and the central singularity was not covered by a horizon , either .",
    "hence , the metric  ( [ eq : ds - ph ] ) describes a naked singularity ( violating the cosmic censorship conjecture ) which gets dressed by a horizon shortly after the big bang , and evolves as a black hole spacetime until it becomes again a naked singularity ( violating cosmic censorship again ) .",
    "this bizarre behavior leads one to wonder whether this is a physically meaningful solution .",
    "after all , it is well known that naked singularities form during simulations of gravitational collapse , but they are not generic .",
    "`` typical '' choices of initial data result in the collapse to a black hole and naked singularities appear to be the exception rather than the rule .",
    "it could well be that the solution  ( [ eq : ds - ph ] ) describes a non - physical , fine - tuned situation with bizarre phenomenology .",
    "the more general solutions considered in sec .",
    "iv exhibit the same phenomenology and this fact tends to exclude fine - tuning , but no truly definitive statement can be made at present to this regard due to the paucity of exact solutions describing the physical situation at hand .    using eq .",
    "( [ eq : w - mm ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : irs ] ) with @xmath4 , one finds that the black hole ah first shrinks and then expands , while the cosmic ah always expands with the evolution of the universe , with the cosmic ah expanding faster than the black hole ah .",
    "there was a moment at which the two horizons coincided and before which the singularity was naked .",
    "as an example , we have plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : r - t - dust ] the evolution of the cosmic and black hole ahs in a dust - dominated universe .",
    "the reason for the black hole ah shrinking initially is that the density , and thus the expansion speed of the universe , were very large in the vicinity of this coincidence . in this sense ,",
    "the expansion of the universe `` wins '' over the attraction of the black hole near this coincidence .    finally , we comment on the global structure of the cosmological black holes discussed . in figures  4 and  5",
    "we plot the penrose - carter diagrams for both the phantom - dominated and the dust - dominated universe with a black hole , respectively .",
    "the global structure and penrose diagram of the sultana - dyer solution has been studied in @xcite , and these are similar for our conformally schwarzschild solutions in a dust - dominated universe ( see fig .  3 of @xcite ) .",
    "hence , the singularity will never become naked in a universe dominated by ordinary ( or dark ) matter . in a universe driven by exotic phantom matter",
    ", the black hole ah also expands .",
    "one then wonders which mechanism can make the black hole ah to shrink .",
    "recall that the schwarzschild anti - de sitter metric is @xmath201 in this case , @xmath81 is a constant and the black hole ah is smaller than that of the corresponding asymptotically flat black hole .",
    "accordingly , the generalized misner - sharp mass is smaller than the one of the hole without cosmological constant .",
    "we note that the schwarzschild - anti - de sitter spacetime has a remarkable difference in comparison with schwarzschild - de sitter : its energy density @xmath202 is negative .",
    "this solution suggests that if a black hole is surrounded by negative and decreasing energy density , its mass will decrease monotonically and will tend to zero in a finite or an infinite cosmic time .",
    "however , even though in the solutions considered here the phantom kinetic energy density is negative , its total energy density is positive , hence this would not happen .",
