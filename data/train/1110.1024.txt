    "the physical systems which have so - far been proposed or used for dissipative state preparation are : cavity quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) @xcite , ion traps @xcite , optical lattices @xcite , atomic ensembles @xcite , and plasmonic waveguides @xcite .",
    "the first experimental studies along these lines @xcite have shown these new ideas to be realistic and promising as a new path for harnessing the potential of quantum information .",
    "+ in this paper , we consider two @xmath0-atoms trapped in a single mode cavity qed setup @xcite coherently driven by a classical optical field and a microwave or raman field .",
    "we demonstrate that a maximally entangled steady state ( stationary state ) of the two atoms can be prepared dissipatively with a very high fidelity by several qualitatively different state preparation mechanisms .",
    "which mechanism is desirable ultimately depends on the strengths and limitations of the experiment at hand @xcite . in each of the schemes ,",
    "the two atoms are rapidly driven into a singlet state , independent of the initial state of the system , and without need for any unitary feedback control .",
    "consequently , the lifetime of the state is dictated by the lifetime of the experiment .",
