    "the polarization directions of the currents in each of the two electrodes do not change in time and are pre - determined solely by the soi parameters of the system .",

    "the applied magnetic flux , though found to be necessary in sustaining the spin polarization of the currents in the steady - state limit , plays no role in the determination of the polarization directions .",
    "however , the effective fluxes , composed of the applied magnetic flux and the soi - induced phase , efficiently modulate the magnitudes of the polarized currents throughout the time .",
    "the couplings between the dqd and the electrodes then largely determine the times to reach the final stable polarizations .",
