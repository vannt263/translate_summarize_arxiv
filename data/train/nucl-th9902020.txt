    "the method of two - particle intensity interferometry was discovered in the early 1950 s by hanbury brown and twiss ( hbt ) @xcite who applied it to the measurement of the angular diameter of stars and other astronomical objects .",
    "these first measurements used two - photon correlations .",
    "an independent development occurred in the field of particle physics in 1960 by goldhaber , goldhaber , lee and pais @xcite who extracted from two - pion correlations the spatial extent of the annihilation fireball in proton - antiproton reactions .",
    "the method exploits the fact that identical particles which sit nearby in phase - space experience quantum statistical effects resulting from the ( anti)symmetrization of the multiparticle wave function . for bosons",
    ", therefore , the two - particle coincidence rate shows an enhancement at small momentum difference between the particles .",
    "the momentum range of this enhancement can be related to the size of the particle source in coordinate space .",
    "hbt interferometry differs from ordinary amplitude interferometry that it compares _ intensities _ rather than amplitudes at different points .",
    "it shows the effects of bose or fermi statistics even if the phase of the ( light or matter ) wave is disturbed by uncontrollable random fluctuations ( as is , for example , the case for starlight propagating through the earth s atmosphere ) or if the counting rate is very low . to illustrate how the method works and how its applications in astronomy and in particle physics differ let us consider the following simple model @xcite : two random point sources @xmath0 and @xmath1 on a distant emitter , separated by the distance @xmath2 , emit identical particles with identical energies @xmath3 which , after travelling a distance @xmath4 , are measured by two detectors 1 and 2 , separated by the distance    @xmath5 ( see figure  [ f0]a )",
    "@xmath4 should to be much larger than @xmath6 or @xmath7 .",
    "the total amplitude measured at detector 1 is then @xmath8 where @xmath9 are the amplitudes emitted by points @xmath0 and @xmath1 , @xmath10 are their random phases , @xmath11 are their distances to detector 1 . the total intensity in 1 is @xmath12 } \\bigr),\\ ] ] with a similar result for @xmath13 . the last term in ( [ b2 ] )",
    "contains information on the distance @xmath6 between the sources @xmath0 and @xmath1 , but it vanishes after averaging the signal over some time , _",
    "i.e. _ over the random phases @xmath14 : @xmath15 the product of the averaged intensities @xmath16 is thus independent of both @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the same is not true for the time - averaged _ coincidence rate _ which is obtained by multiplying the two intensities before averaging : @xmath17 the two - particle intensity correlation function is thus given by @xmath18 for large @xmath19 , the argument of the second , oscillating term becomes @xmath20 note the symmetry of this expression in @xmath7 and @xmath6 , the separations of the detectors and of the emitters ; this symmetry is lost in the two practically relevant limits :    1 .   in astronomical applications",
    "the emission points @xmath0 and @xmath1 are part of a star s surface or of even larger objects , while the detectors on earth are only a few meters or kilometers apart : @xmath21 . in this limit ( see figure  [ f0]b ) the cosine - term in ( [ b5 ] ) reduces to @xmath22 , with @xmath23 , the unit vectors @xmath24 giving the directions from the detectors to the two emission points @xmath25 .",
    "experimentally one varies the distance @xmath5 between the detectors , and from the resulting oscillation of the signal one extracts the _ angular _ separation @xmath26 of the two emitters via @xmath27 . absolute determination of the source separation @xmath6 is possible only if their distance @xmath4 is known from elsewhere .",
    "2 .   in nuclear and particle physics",
    "the emitters are very much smaller than the detector separation , @xmath28",
    ". then ( see figure  [ f0]c ) the cosine - term in ( [ b5 ] ) becomes @xmath29 , in similar notation as above .",
    "now the experimental control variable is the momentum difference @xmath30 , and @xmath2 is extracted from the oscillation period .    in real",
    "life one has , instead of two discrete ones , a continuum of sources described by a distribution @xmath31 of their relative distances . for the case @xmath28 , after averaging ( [ b5 ] ) over this relative distance distribution , the measured correlation function",
    "is then given by the fourier transform of @xmath31 : @xmath32 as we will see , this expression is only applicable to static sources .",
    "the assumption of a static source is adequate for stars .",
    "the particles emitted in high energy hadron or nuclear reactions , however , come from sources which feature strong dynamical evolution both along the beam direction and transverse to it . as a result ,",
    "two - particle correlation measurements in heavy - ion physics exhibit a much _ richer _ structure , but their interpretation is also considerably more involved .",
    "the present review covers the technical tools required to access this richness of information and their practical application in heavy - ion reactions .",
    "high energy heavy - ion collisions produce hadronic matter under intense conditions of temperature and density . while the highest densities are reached in the early stages of the collision , most of the observed particles are hadrons , which are emitted rather late in the evolution of the collision . for this reason ,",
    "the measured momentum spectra and correlations contain direct information only about the size , shape , and dynamics of the source at `` freeze - out '' , _",
    "i.e. _ when the hadrons cease to interact .",
    "the dynamical information is of particular importance as it allows us to connect the observed final state with the hot and dense early stages .",
    "therefore much of the effort in the last few years has gone into the extraction of this dynamics .",
    "it turns out that both the single - particle spectra and two - particle correlations are sensitive to certain combinations of thermal and collective motion in the source .",
    "a simultaneous analysis of particles with different masses allows for a separation of the two effects : while the thermal motion generates a common momentum distribution in the source , the collective motion creates a flow velocity which combines with the thermal momentum proportionally to the particle s mass .",
    "further discrimination is achieved by combining the spectra with the two - particle correlations which reflect the collective source dynamics through a characteristic momentum dependence of their width parameters .",
    "the aim of hbt ( or two - particle bose - einstein ) interferometry is therefore to provide , in conjunction with a simultaneous analysis of single - particle spectra , a complete and quantitative characterization ( both geometrically and dynamically ) of the emitting source at `` freeze - out '' . such a characterization can be used for backward extrapolations into the interesting dense earlier stages of the collision , and it provides stringent constraints on dynamical models aiming to describe the kinetic evolution of these stages .      the last decade has brought great strides in measurement , theory , and interpretation of two - particle correlations .",
    "dedicated experiments , optimized for momentum resolution , allow measurement of correlations to very small momentum difference . much increased statistics of particle pairs has opened the possibility of multidimensional correlation analysis .",
    "correlation functions of identified kaons have become available ; as many fewer kaons arise from resonance decays , they provide a more direct picture of the emitting source than the more prevalent pions .",
    "correlations of proton pairs , which will not be discussed here , are also measured in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the experimental programs at the cern sps and brookhaven ags have allowed comparison between small and large systems at different energies , using s and pb beams at cern and lower energy si and au beams at the ags .",
    "the comparisons are greatly aided by the development of a commonly accepted analysis formalism among the experiments .",
    "furthermore , the pair momentum dependence of the correlations is now being used to provide dynamical information about the space - time structure of the particle source .",
    "intensive modeling with event generators , combined with methods to extract correlation functions from them , has been used to study experimental effects such as acceptance and to verify the usefulness of simple model parameterizations in theory .",
    "new parametrizations of the two - particle correlation function have been developed which are particularly well adapted for the sources created in high energy collisions .",
    "recently , the necessity of separating geometrical , temporal and dynamical aspects of the correlations has been recognized , and methods to do so have been developed .",
    "intensity interferometry has thus developed into a quantitative tool which at the present stage yields important source parameters at the level of 20% accuracy .",
    "the 2-particle correlation function is defined as the ratio of the lorentz - invariant 2-particle coincidence cross section and the product of the two single particle distributions : @xmath33 the single- and two - particle cross sections are normalized to the average number of particles per event @xmath34 and the average number of particles in pairs @xmath35 , respectively .",
    "different normalizations of the correlation function are sometimes used in the literature @xcite .",
    "careful consideration of the normalization is required when analyzing multi - particle symmetrization effects @xcite .",
    "the most direct connection between the measured two - particle correlations in momentum space and the source distribution in coordinate space can be established if the particles are emitted independently ( `` chaotic source '' ) and propagate freely from source to detector .",
    "several approaches to derive this connection @xcite are worked out in the literature , parametrizing the source as a covariant superposition of classical currents @xcite or using a superposition of nonrelativistic wave packets @xcite .",
    "one finds the simple relations ( with the upper ( lower ) sign for bosons ( fermions ) ) @xmath36 where the _ emission function _",
    "@xmath37 is an effective single - particle _ wigner phase - space density _ of the particles in the source .",
    "( wigner densities are real but not necessarily everywhere positive . ) for the single - particle spectrum ( [ spectrum ] ) this wigner function must be evaluated on - shell , _",
    "i.e. _ at @xmath38",
    ". the correlation function ( [ correlator ] ) was expressed in terms of the relative momentum @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and average ( pair ) momentum @xmath41 , @xmath42 .",
    "as the two measured particles are on - shell , @xmath43 , the 4-momenta @xmath44 and @xmath45 are _ off - shell_. they satisfy the orthogonality relation @xmath46 that on the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ correlator ] ) one needs the emission function for off - shell momenta @xmath45 may at first seem troublesome . in practice , however , the _ on - shell approximation _",
    "@xmath47 is very accurate in heavy - ion collisions : the corrections of order @xmath48 are small in the interesting domain of small relative momenta @xmath49 , as a result of the large source sizes and the rest masses of the measured particles .",
    "a further simplification is achieved by making in the denominator of ( [ correlator ] ) the _ smoothness approximation _ @xcite , taking the product of single - particle spectra at their average momentum @xmath50 : @xmath51 it is exact for exponential single - particle spectra , with corrections proportional to their curvature in logarithmic representation .",
    "both approximations can _ a posteriori _ be corrected for in the correlation radii ( `` hbt radii '' , see below ) , using information from the measured single - particle spectra @xcite . for heavy - ion collisions ,",
    "such corrections are usually negligible @xcite .",
    "we call @xmath37 an _ effective _ single - particle wigner density since different derivations of the relation ( [ correlator ] ) yield different microscopic interpretations for @xmath52 . for a detailed discussion of this point",
    "we refer to @xcite .",
    "the differences can become conceptually important in sources with high phase - space density @xcite .",
    "so far , in heavy - ion collisions the phase - space densities at freeze - out appear to be low enough to neglect them @xcite .",
    "the mass - shell constraint ( [ ortho ] ) eliminates one of the four components of the relative momentum @xmath44 ; for example , it can be resolved as @xmath53 which gives the energy difference @xmath54 in terms of @xmath49 and the velocity @xmath55 of the pair . with only three independent @xmath49-components , the fourier transform in ( [ corrapp ] ) can not be inverted , _",
    "i.e. _ the space - time structure of @xmath37 can not be fully recovered from the measured correlator : @xmath56 separation of the spatial and temporal structure of the source thus requires _ additional model assumptions _ about @xmath37",
    ".    we can connect ( [ invert ] ) with ( [ b7 ] ) by introducing the _ normalized relative distance distribution _ which is a folding of the single - particle emission function with itself : @xmath57 @xmath7 is an even function of @xmath58 . it allows to rewrite @xcite the correlator in the form ( [ b7 ] ) : @xmath59 in the second equation we used ( [ mass - shell ] ) and introduced the _ relative source function _",
    "@xmath60 in the pair rest frame where @xmath61 , @xmath62 is the time integral of the relative distance distribution @xmath7 , and the time structure of the source is completely integrated out . on the other hand , @xmath62 is , for each pair momentum @xmath63 , fully reconstructible from the measured correlator @xmath64 by inverting the last fourier transform in ( [ reldis2 ] ) .",
    "this `` imaging method '' was recently exploited in @xcite .",
    "as we will see , interesting information about the source dynamics and time structure is then hidden in the @xmath50-dependence of @xmath65 ; the latter can , however , not be unfolded without additional model assumptions about the source .",
    "hbt measurements in high energy physics are mostly performed with charged particles .",
    "these suffer long - range coulomb repulsion effects on the way from the source to the detector which , even for boson pairs , cause a suppression of the measured correlator at @xmath66 .",
    "moreover , the charged particle pair feels the total electric charge of the source from which it is emitted .",
    "final state effects from strong interactions play a dominant role in proton - proton correlations @xcite , due to the existence of a strong @xmath67-wave resonance in the two - nucleon channel just above threshold .",
    "such final state interaction ( fsi ) effects are sensitive to the average separation of the two particles at their emission points and thus also contain relevant information about the source size @xcite .",
    "this has recently led to an increased effort to understand and exploit fsi - induced two - particle correlations which also exist between pairs of _ unlike particles _ @xcite .",
    "the particular interest in such correlations arises from the fact that , for particles with unequal masses , they allow under certain circumstances to determine the _ sign _ of the time difference between the emission points of the two particles or the _ direction _ of their separation at emission @xcite ; this is not possible with correlations between identical particles . in most practical cases , however , the fsi - induced correlations are considerably weaker than the bose - einstein correlations between pairs of identical particles .    at the level of accuracy of eqs .",
    "( [ corrapp],[reldis2 ] ) which use the smoothness approximation , the correlator can be easily corrected for 2-body final state interactions by replacing @xmath68 with a suitable distorted wave . instead of ( [ reldis2 ] )",
    "one thus obtains @xcite @xmath69 a slightly more general result which avoids the smoothness approximation was derived in @xcite . for simplicity",
    "the integral in ( [ koonin ] ) is written in coordinates of the pair rest frame where @xmath70 .",
    "@xmath71 is an fsi distorted scattering wave for the relative motion of the two particles with asymptotic relative momentum @xmath49 ; for coulomb fsi it is given by a confluent hypergeometric function : @xmath72 where @xmath73 .",
    "it describes the propagation of the particle pair from an initial separation @xmath74 in the pair rest frame , at the time when the second particle was emitted @xcite , under the influence of the mutual fsi . for identical particle pairs",
    "it must be properly symmetrized : @xmath75 .",
    "for a pointlike source @xmath76 the correlator ( [ koonin ] ) with ( [ coulomb ] ) reduces to the gamov factor @xmath77 ( to @xmath78 for identical particles ) : @xmath79    for coulomb fsi it was recently shown @xcite that a very good approximation for the coulomb correction can be taken from _ measured _ unlike - sign particle pairs in the following form : @xmath80 the denominator ( which deviates from unity for small @xmath81 ) corrects for the fact that even for a pointlike source the like - sign and unlike - sign coulomb correlations are not exactly each other s inverse .",
    "the important observation in @xcite is that this correction is essentially independent of the source size .",
    "the effects of the central charge of the remaining fireball on the charged particle pair were studied in @xcite . for a static source",
    "it was found that at large pair momenta the fsi reduces ( increases ) the apparent size ( hbt radius ) for positively ( negatively ) charged pairs @xcite whereas for small pair momenta the apparent radius increases for both charge states @xcite .",
    "expanding sources have not yet been studied in this context , nor has this effect been quantitatively confirmed by experiment . also , combining the central interaction with two - body fsi remains an unsolved theoretical challenge .      the two - particle correlation function is usually parametrized by a gaussian in the relative momentum components .",
    "we now discuss different gaussian parametrizations and establish the relationship of the corresponding width parameters ( hbt radii ) with the space - time structure of the source .",
    "the space - time interpretation of the hbt radii is based on a gaussian approximation to the space - time dependence of the emission function @xmath37 @xcite . characterizing the effective source of particles of momentum @xmath45 by its space - time variances ( `` rms widths '' )",

    "( [ 3.4 ] ) expresses the width of the correlation function in terms of the rms widths of the single - particle wigner density @xmath37 .",
    "note that the absolute space - time position @xmath87 of the source center does not appear explicitly and thus can not be measured .    instead of the widths of the single - particle function",
    "@xmath37 we can also use the widths of the relative distance distribution @xmath88 ( see ( [ reldis ] ) ) to characterize the correlation function . starting from ( [ reldis ] )",
    "one finds within the same gaussian approximation @xmath89 $ ] ; here @xmath90 denotes the average with the relative distance distribution @xmath7 . since @xmath7 is even , @xmath91 .",
    "one sees that the rms widths of @xmath52 and @xmath7 are related by a factor 2 : @xmath92 .",
    "this shows that for a gaussian parametrization of the correlator according to ( [ 3.4 ] ) , _ without a factor @xmath93 in the exponent _ , the width parameters are directly related to the rms widths of the single - particle emission function @xmath52 whereas a similar parametrization _ which includes a factor @xmath93 in the exponent _ gives as width parameters the rms widths of the relative distance distribution @xmath7 ( or of the relative source function @xmath65 ) . while the latter interpretation may be mathematically more accurate ,",
    "the former is more intuitive and has therefore been preferred in the recent literature .    in either case , the two - particle correlator yields _ rms widths of the effective source of particles with momentum @xmath50_. in general , these width parameters do not characterize the total extension of the collision region .",
    "they rather measure the size of the system through a filter of wavelength @xmath50 . in the language introduced by sinyukov  @xcite",
    "this size is the `` region of homogeneity '' , the region from which particle pairs with momentum @xmath50 are most likely emitted .",
    "the space - time variances @xmath94 coincide with total source extensions only in the special case that the emission function shows no position - momentum correlations and factorizes , @xmath95 .",
    "relating ( [ 3.4 ] ) to experimental data requires first the elimination of one of the four @xmath44-components via the mass - shell constraint ( [ ortho ] ) .",
    "depending on the choice of the three independent components different gaussian parametrizations exist .",
    "a convenient choice of coordinate axes for heavy - ion collisions is the _",

    "the _ sideward _ component @xmath102 of the pair velocity @xmath55 in ( [ mass - shell ] ) vanishes by definition .",
    "the * cartesian parametrization *  @xcite of the correlator ( often referred to , historically somewhat incorrectly , as pratt@xcite - bertsch@xcite parametrization ) is based on an elimination of @xmath54 in ( [ 3.4 ] ) via ( [ mass - shell ] ) : @xmath103 the gaussian width parameters ( hbt correlation radii ) @xmath104 of the cartesian parametrization are related to the space - time variances of the emission function by @xcite @xmath105 these are _ 6 functions of three variables _ : the pair rapidity @xmath106 , the modulus @xmath107 and the azimuthal angle @xmath108 between the transverse pair momentum @xmath100 and the impact parameter @xmath109 .",
    "only these 6 combinations of the 10 independent space - time variances @xmath86 can be measured .",
    "for _ azimuthally symmetric _ collision ensembles the emission function has a reflection symmetry @xmath110 , eliminating 3 of the 10 space - time variances , and the correlator is symmetric under @xmath111 @xcite .",

    "extensive discussions of these parameters ( including the cross - term @xmath115 which originally appeared in the important , but widely neglected paper @xcite , was recently rediscovered @xcite and then experimentally confirmed @xcite ) can be found in refs .",
    "the cross - term vanishes in any longitudinal reference frame in which the source is symmetric under @xmath116 @xcite ( e.g. for pion pairs with vanishing rapidity in the center - of - momentum system ( cms ) of a symmetric collision ) ; in general it does _ not _ vanish for pion pairs with non - zero cms rapidity , not even in the longitudinally co - moving system ( lcms @xcite ) @xcite .",
    "for azimuthally symmetric collisions no direction is distinguished for pairs with @xmath117 . as long as for @xmath118 the emission function reduces to an azimuthally symmetric expression ( an exception is a certain class of opaque source models discussed in section [ sec2.3.4 ] ) ,",
    "one has at @xmath117 the identities @xcite @xmath119 ; these imply that @xmath120 and the cross - term @xmath115 vanish at @xmath117 . at non - zero @xmath107",
    "these identities for the space - time variances may be broken by transverse position - momentum correlations in the source , as e.g. generated by transverse collective flow .",
    "if the latter are sufficiently weak the leading @xmath107-dependence of the difference @xmath121 is given by the explicit @xmath122-dependence of the first term on the rhs .",
    "this yields the duration of the particle emission process @xmath123 for particles with small @xmath107 @xcite .",
    "( this is sometimes loosely called the `` lifetime '' of the effective source , but should not to be confused with the total time duration between nuclear impact and freeze - out which is not directly measurable . )",
    "the possibility to extract the emission duration from correlation measurements , pointed out by bertsch and pratt @xcite , provided the main motivation for the construction of second generation experiments to measure high quality , high statistics correlation functions .",
    "subsequent model studies for relativistic heavy - ion collisions @xcite where the emission duration is expected to be relatively short ( of the order of the transverse source extension ) showed , however , that the extraction of @xmath124 is somewhat model dependent ; the relative smallness of the last two terms in ( [ rdiff ] ) can not always be guaranteed , and their implicit @xmath107-dependence can mix with the explicit one of the interesting first term .",
    "the * yano - koonin - podgoretski  ( ykp ) parametrization * is an alternative gaussian parametrization of the correlator for _ azimuthally symmetric _ collisions .",

    ", the three ykp radii thus have a straightforward interpretation as the transverse , longitudinal and temporal homogeneity lengths in the yk frame .",
    "in particular the time structure of the source only enters in @xmath137 . for sources with strong longitudinal expansion , like those created in relativistic heavy - ion collisions",
    ", it was shown in extensive model studies @xcite that the yk velocity @xmath134 very accurately reflects the longitudinal velocity at the center @xmath138 of the `` homogeneity region '' of particles of momentum @xmath50 .",
    "the yk frame can thus be interpreted as the rest frame of the effective source of particles with momentum @xmath50 , and the ykp radii measure the transverse , longitudinal and temporal size of this effective source in its own rest frame .",
    "the parametrizations ( [ pbc ] ) and ( [ ykp ] ) use different independent components of @xmath44 but are mathematically equivalent .",
    "the ykp parameters can thus be calculated from the cartesian ones and vice versa @xcite .",
    "the corresponding relations are @xmath139 whose inversion reads @xmath140 these last definitions hold in an arbitrary longitudinal reference frame . according to ( [ 22a ] ) @xmath141 is zero in the frame where @xmath142 vanishes .",
    "however , ( [ 22a ] ) also shows that the ykp parametrization becomes ill - defined if the argument of the square root turns negative .",
    "this can indeed happen , in particular for opaque sources @xcite ; this has motivated the introduction of a _ modified ykp parametrization _ in @xcite which avoids this problem at the expense of a less intuitive interpretation of the modified ykp radii .",
    "these remarks show that these relations provide an essential check for the internal consistency of the gaussian fit to the measured correlation function and for the physical interpretation of the resulting hbt parameters .",
    "if the particle momenta are correlated with their emission points ( `` @xmath58-@xmath144-correlations '' ) , the space - time variances in ( [ 3.4 ] ) depend on the pair momentum @xmath50 .",
    "various mechanisms can lead to such correlations ; the most important one for heavy - ion collisions is collective expansion of the source .",
    "recently a major effort has been launched to extract the collective flow pattern at freeze - out from the @xmath50-dependence of the hbt parameters .",
    "however , thermalized sources may exhibit temperature gradients along the freeze - out surface which cause additional @xmath58-@xmath144-correlations .",
    "moreover , pion spectra receive sizeable contributions from the decay of unstable resonances some time after freeze - out .",
    "these decay pions tend to come from a somewhat larger space - time region than the directly emitted ones and , due to the decay kinematics , they preferentially populate the low - momentum region .",
    "together these two effects also generate @xmath58-@xmath144-correlations for the emitted pions even if the original source did not have them @xcite .",
    "the separation of these different effects requires extensive model studies some of which will be reviewed below . for didactical reasons we will discuss them in the context of the ykp parametrization where",
    "certain mechanisms can be demonstrated most transparently .",
    "a translation for the cartesian fit parameters via the cross - check relations ( [ 24])-([24c ] ) is straightforward .",
    "furthermore we will show that for sources with strong longitudinal expansion the yk frame ( effective source rest frame ) is usually rather close to the lcms ( in which the pairs have vanishing longitudinal momentum ) , _ i.e. _ @xmath145 in the lcms .",
    "this allows , at least qualitatively , for a rather direct extraction of source properties in its own rest frame from the cartesian hbt radius parameters in the lcms .",
    "this is important since initially most multi - dimensional hbt analyses were done with the cartesian parametrization in the lcms , before the ykp parametrization became popular .",
    "we will concentrate on the discussion of azimuthally symmetric sources ( central collisions ) for which extensive knowledge , both theoretical and experimental , has been accumulated in the last few years .",
    "many analytical model studies @xcite are based on the following parametrization of the emission function ( or slight variations thereof ) : @xmath146.\\ ] ] here @xmath147 , @xmath148 $ ] , and @xmath149 parametrize the space - time coordinates @xmath150 , with @xmath151 .",

    "the correlation between the velocities of the pair ( @xmath106 ) and of the emission region ( @xmath187 ) strengthens as the thermal smearing decreases . for the boltzmann form ( [ 3.15 ] ) the latter is controlled by @xmath188 , and correspondingly @xmath189 as @xmath190 . for small @xmath107 ,",

    "thus a similar linear rise of the yk - rapidity with the pair rapidity and a strong decrease of @xmath197 would also be expected in jet fragmentation ( with the @xmath97-axis oriented along the jet axis ) . it would be interesting to confirm this prediction @xcite in @xmath198 or @xmath199 collisions .      just as longitudinal expansion affects @xmath185",
    ", transverse flow causes an @xmath181-dependence of @xmath200 .",

    "correspondingly , in realistic simulations ( e.g. @xcite ) the longitudinal homogeneity length @xmath185 turns out to be dominated by the expansion ( _ i.e. _ by @xmath202 ) while in the transverse direction the geometric size @xmath6 dominates at small @xmath181 , with flow effects taking over only at larger values of @xmath181 .",

    "as will be seen later , this prediction by rqmd and hydrodynamical models is confirmed by the data .",
    "an analogous effect is seen in the sideward direction where especially the calculated kaon correlation function is wider than expected from the fourier transform of their momentum - integrated transverse spatial distribution .",
    "this can be traced back to transverse position - momentum correlations in the rqmd freeze - out distribution , induced by collective transverse expansion . as discussed above",
    ", these correlations increase with increasing transverse mass of the particles and are thus more strongly reflected in the kaon correlation function .",
    "the resulting decrease of the transverse effective source size extracted from kaon correlations is again confirmed by the data .",
    "event generators like rqmd can be used to study the influence of experimental acceptance cuts on the @xmath107-dependence of the hbt fit parameters induced by collective flow .",
    "rqmd was shown to reproduce the @xmath107-dependence of the correlation functions both at sps @xcite and ags @xcite energies .",

    "the shrinking of the effective source size as a result of collective flow is illustrated in figure  [ freeze ] .",
    "the collective flow velocity has the effect of `` focussing '' particles arising from nearby regions of the source . as the correlation selects particles of small momentum difference , it is sensitive to this focussing .",
    "figure  [ freeze ] shows the freeze - out distributions of all pions ( open histograms ) and of those pions accepted in two na44 spectrometer settings ( 44mr is the low @xmath107 setting and 131mr high @xmath107 ) .",
    "higher @xmath107 pairs have a narrower distribution at freeze - out due to the larger effect of the flow velocity .",
    "note that this is the focussing from flow and not an experimental acceptance effect .",
    "the correlation function only `` sees '' particles which are flowing in the same direction ; particles from the far side of the source flow away in an expanding source .",
    "this is why the characteristic drop of apparent source size with increasing @xmath107 is observed by both na35 and na44 even though one experiment has large acceptance and one narrow .",

    "@xcite found that only for @xmath107 below @xmath279 100 mev / c does this method yield the actual emission duration . for higher @xmath107 particles , the true emission duration ( 3 - 6 fm/@xmath280 for s+pb @xcite and 7 - 8.5 fm/@xmath280 for pb+pb @xcite ) is shorter due to flow - induced position - momentum correlations , but the value derived from the difference between @xmath223 and @xmath281 underrepresents even this .",
    "consequently , extraction of the emission duration from experimental correlation functions should only be attempted at low @xmath107 .",
    "of course , the total lifetime of the source between impact and freeze - out is considerably larger .      in rqmd as many as half of the low @xmath107 pions in heavy - ion collisions arise from the decay of long - lived resonances @xcite .",
    "very long - lived resonances produce a long tail in the pion freeze - out position distribution , visible in figure  [ rqmd ] .",
    "this corresponds to a component of the correlation function too narrow to measure and reduces the correlation strength @xmath226 @xcite . in s+pb collisions",
    "the fraction of pions from @xmath282 resonances is 30% at low @xmath247 and falls to 5 % at @xmath247= 800 mev / c @xcite .",
    "these pions cause a departure from a gaussian source shape , which impacts the quality of fits with a gaussian parametrization .",
    "resonance decay contributions to kaons are smaller , which makes the interpretation of their correlation functions cleaner . due to their rest mass",
    "they always have a sizeable @xmath181 , and so their correlation functions are more sensitive to flow .",

    "freeze - out is usually enforced at a fixed energy density or temperature . after the end of the simulation",
    "those fluid cells which satisfy this freeze - out criterium are identified , and the local energy and baryon density in these cells are converted into temperature and chemical potentials using the equation of state of an ideal resonance gas in thermal and chemical equilibrium .",
    "each such cell thus emits a thermal hadron spectrum boosted by the local fluid velocity .",
    "this determines the emission function @xmath283 of the model from which spectra and correlation functions can be calculated @xcite .",
    "measured spectra and correlation functions put constraints on the output of such simulations which can be used to identify allowed combinations of initial conditions and equations of state @xcite . in this way certain classes of evolution scenarios can be eliminated while successful combinations can be used to predict other observables for further discrimination or hadronic one- and two - particle spectra at future colliders @xcite .",
    "experimentally , correlation functions are constructed by counting events with boson pairs of given pair and relative momenta and dividing by a properly normalized @xcite `` background '' sample with no enhancement : @xmath284 typically , @xmath285 is generated by creating artificial pairs by combining single tracks from different events , or by using unlike - sign pions .",
    "generally , analyses bin both the data and the background in the chosen variables .",
    "the correlation functions are then corrected for coulomb interactions , experimental resolution and two - particle acceptance ( generally by monte carlo techniques ) , residual two - particle effects on the single - particle spectrum constructed from mixed pairs , particle misidentification ( if contamination is significant ) ; see @xcite for details .",
    "correlation functions are customarily fit by a gaussian in @xmath44 which assumes a gaussian - distributed source .",
    "this is a simplification , since the source may well have a more complex shape .",
    "however , the gaussian assumption provides a reasonable representation of the data @xcite and continues to be used .",
    "one should keep in mind , however , that the measured correlation functions are usually not perfect gaussians and that this leads to systematic uncertainties of the order of 10 - 20% in the extracted fit parameters .",
    "high statistics data samples are now analyzed using multi - dimensional fits@xcite . unlike many lower - dimensional parametrizations these do not require the unrealistic assumption of a spherical source and are more sensitive to the collision dynamics @xcite .",
    "some analyses do , however , use lower - dimensional parameterizations due to statistical or acceptance limitations .",
    "these carry the danger of producing misleading results , but they can be useful if they are based on a complete parametrization and make proper projections @xcite .      initially , experimental correlation functions were corrected for 2-body coulomb interactions using the gamov factor .",
    "however , as measurements of heavier systems were made , the point source approximation became increasingly inappropriate .",

    "the difference is 8 - 12% , with @xmath226 decreasing by 3 - 6% @xcite .",
    "the coulomb correction can be investigated experimentally by measuring correlation functions of oppositely charged particle pairs , where quantum mechanical symmetrization effects are absent @xcite .",

    "longitudinally the source at freeze - out features approximately boost - invariant flow while the transverse dynamics is slightly weaker . still , the transverse radius of the particle emitting source approximately doubles from initial impact to freeze - out .",
    "these features indicate action of a significant pressure , though the hadronic observables are not able to indicate which degrees of freedom are responsible for its build - up .    already at bevalac energies , below 2 gev / nucleon",
    ", the hadronic matter expands .",
    "however , both the radial flow velocity of the matter and the final source size tend to increase with increasing beam energy . high energy collisions at the sps result in hadron sources which develop average transverse flow velocities of 0.5@xmath280 ; the hadrons freeze out at temperatures near 100 mev .",
    "kaons and pions flow together , and the observations are consistent with freeze - out from a common source . from the onset of expansion to freeze - out , the transverse radius increases by a factor of 2.5 ; given the difference in expansion velocities , the longitudinal growth should be about twice that .",
    "the total source volume in pb+pb collisions thus grows by a factor of 30 !",
    "the single and two - particle distributions are consistent with formation of a thermalized , flowing hadron gas .",
    "the behavior of such a gas may be used to extrapolate back to the early times in the collision , using the _ measured _ freeze - out conditions and flow gradients constrained by the data .",
    "the freeze - out temperature , via the equation of state of an ideal resonance gas , provides an estimate for the local energy density at decoupling ( @xmath356 mev/@xmath357 at @xmath338 mev ) , the measured transverse flow velocity provides the lorentz contraction factor @xmath358 to correct for the kinetic energy of the expanding matter in the lab frame ( @xmath359 for @xmath360 ) .",
    "this gives a freeze - out energy density of about 100 mev/@xmath357 . with the total expansion factor 30 given above , the initial energy density , at the onset of transverse expansion , should have been of the order of 3 gev/@xmath357 , _ i.e. _ well above the critical energy density @xmath361 gev/@xmath357 for color deconfinement as given by lattice calculations @xcite .",
    "since the initialization of transverse expansion requires pressure , this large energy density must have been at least partially thermalized .",
    "this estimate of the initial energy density ( which is averaged over the transverse area of the source ) agrees in order of magnitude with simple estimates which use the bjorken formula @xcite with the measured multiplicity density and assume an initial thermalization time @xmath362 fm/@xmath280 .",
    "compared to the latter it has , however , the advantage that it replaces several features of the highly idealized bjorken expansion model @xcite ( e.g. the parameter @xmath363 ) by measured quantities , extracted from the hbt analysis .          higher energy collisions ( factor of 10 increase in @xmath352 ) will be available at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) in late 1999 .",
    "experiments will use the techniques described here to map the freeze - out conditions . quantifying the transverse and longitudinal flow velocities",
    "will allow determination of the pressure build - up in the early stages of the collisions .",
    "armed with the extracted velocities , one will be able to back - extrapolate from freeze - out to the time of hadron formation .",
    "full analysis of kaon and proton correlations both extends the accessible @xmath107 range and will verify whether these hadrons are emitted from a common source with the pions .",
    "we have only discussed the analysis of azimuthally symmetric sources . even if impact parameter @xmath364 never occurs , the `` central '' event ensemble from which the correlation function is constructed is azimuthally symmetric since one averages over the orientation of the collision plane . on the other hand , reconstructing the latter event - by - event opens up an even richer field of activities and phenomena .",
    "azimuthal anisotropies of global event features ( in particular directed and elliptic flow , for reviews see @xcite ) have been studied since the days of the bevalac , and azimuthally sensitive analyses of single - particle spectra from non - central collisions have recently attracted a lot of attention @xcite .",
    "the measured elliptic flow of pions and protons at the sps @xcite may play an important role in extracting the pressure in the early collision stage @xcite .",
    "the next question is how these azimuthal deformations in momentum - space are correlated with corresponding deformations in coordinate - space .",
    "the tools for extracting this information from azimuthally sensitive hbt analyses were developed in @xcite .    without azimuthal symmetry of the source ,",
    "the correlator in gaussian approximation is characterized by 6 functions of 3 variables , see ( [ carthbt ] ) . following the pioneering studies of voloshin and cleland @xcite , it was shown by wiedemann @xcite that for sources whose transverse geometric and dynamical deformations have a dominant quadrupole component this",
    "can be reduced to _ 6 functions of only 2 variables _ @xmath127 .",
    "the dependence on the angle @xmath108 between @xmath100 and the impact parameter @xmath109 is made explicit in the * wiedemann parametrization * : @xmath365   \\nonumber\\\\     & & \\quad\\times     \\exp[-\\alpha_1\\cos\\phi(3q_o^2+q_s^2)+2\\alpha_1\\sin\\phi q_o q_s ]   \\nonumber\\\\     & & \\quad\\times     \\exp[-\\alpha_2\\cos(2\\phi)(q_o^2-q_s^2 )           + 2\\alpha_2\\sin(2\\phi)q_o q_s]\\ , .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the parameters @xmath366 are the same as in ( [ pbc ] ) ; they are given by the @xmath108-averages of the corresponding functions of @xmath367 in ( [ cartesian ] ) and describe the homogeneity regions of the azimuthally averaged deformed source .",
    "the two new parameters @xmath368 are related to the first and second harmonic coefficients of @xmath240 in the azimuthal angle @xmath108 .",
    "they were shown @xcite to characterize dynamic and geometric elliptic anisotropies in the source , respectively .",
    "determination of the phase - space density of particles at freeze - out will be important to check whether the collisions at higher energies produce a source consistent with local thermal equilibrium .",
    "it has been speculated that the higher densities of produced particles might cause a pion condensate @xcite . here , a comparison of pion and kaon phase - space densities may be particularly illuminating .",
    "the average phase - space density of pions at freeze - out has already been studied at ags and sps energies and found to be consistent with particle emission from a source in local thermal equilibrium .",

    "( [ psdens ] ) , e877 analyzed positive and negative pions from 10.8 @xmath286 gev au+au collisions near beam rapidity .",
    "they found  @xcite that transverse flow is not needed , and the data are well - described by a thermal source .",
    "study of a compilation @xcite of data from s+nucleus and pb+pb collisions at the sps showed a nearly universal behavior of the phase - space density of pions at freeze - out .",
    "the data are again consistent with freeze - out from a locally equilibrated source . however , the @xmath247-dependence of the spatially averaged phase - space density at mid - rapidity is less steep than that of a bose - einstein distribution .",
    "such a deviation is expected due to transverse flow .",
    "higher order bose - einstein correlations will be studied to seek evidence of coherence in the source .",
    "an analysis as described in sec .",
    "[ sec2.6 ] was done by na44  @xcite , albeit due to limited statistics only in one dimension .",
    "a three - pion correlation function @xmath369 , with @xmath370 ,    was constructed from central s+pb collisions at 200 @xmath286 gev ; it is shown on the left side of figure  [ 3pi ] .",
    "the upper dashed line shows the three - pion correlation function expected if the source is totally chaotic and symmetric , while the lower shows the case of vanishing @xmath271 ( see sec .",
    "[ sec2.6 ] ) .",
    "the right side of the figure shows that the normalized three - pion correlation function @xmath271 ( which is experimentally determined as a weight factor called @xmath227 @xcite ) deviates from 1 in the experiment in the accessible @xmath371-range ; if this behaviour persisted down to @xmath371=0 , this would imply partial coherence of the source .",
    "it is hoped that the much higher statistics expected at rhic will settle this important question .",
