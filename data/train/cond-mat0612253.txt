    "the effect of the electric field on the exciton recombination energy is used to probe the properties of the electron and hole confinement in separate self - assembled quantum dots @xcite through a strong deformation of the carrier wave functions . for vertically coupled quantum dots@xcite",
    "the electric field oriented in the growth direction leads to a redistribution of the carriers between the dots.@xcite typical electric field applied for vertically coupled quantum dots is of the order of 20 - 30 kv / cm , i.e. , by an order of magnitude smaller than the one used to probe the confinement potential@xcite of a single dot .",
    "therefore , such experiments on the electric - field effect for coupled dots resolve rather the properties of the molecular coupling than the fabrication dependent details of the confinement in separate dots .",
    "moreover , the charge redistribution induced by the electric field between the different dots have naturally a much stronger energy effect than deformation of the wave functions inside each of the dots .",
    "due to these features , previous simple modeling@xcite ( done in parallel with the experimental work@xcite ) using a square well vertical and harmonic lateral confinement@xcite led to the correct description of the observed @xcite electric field induced dissociation of the electron - hole pair in an avoided crossing of dark and bright energy levels.@xcite it also successfully predicted@xcite non - trivial features of the photoluminescence spectrum observed during the negative trion dissociation by the electric field.@xcite    a vertical electric field was used very recently@xcite to verify the growth process of intentionally strongly asymmetric double quantum dots . in this paper we demonstrate that the horizonal electric field ( perpendicular to the growth direction ) can be useful to estimate the non - perfect vertical alignment of the dots and to determine the direction of the horizontal shift between them . to account for the horizontal field effects we replaced the harmonic lateral profile of our previous model@xcite by a quantum well and developed a computational approach for treating excitons in systems with no axial symmetry and for an arbitrary electric field direction .",
    "the vertical electric field - induced redistribution of charge carriers is smooth only for the electron which tunnels much more effectively between the dots and is responsible for the most characteristic experimental features of the spectrum .",
    "@xcite similarly , it is the electron redistribution between the dots due to a rotation of a weak horizontal field that allows for the detection of the non - perfect alignment , the hole charge being only shifted within the separate dots .",
    "therefore , we decided to use for simplicity the single band model to describe the hole .",
    "the paper is organized as follows , section ii describes the computational approach , our numerical results are given in section iii , and section iv contains the summary and conclusions .",
    "we work in the single valence band approximation , for which the hamiltonian of the electron - hole pair is @xmath0 with @xmath1 , @xmath2 - electron and hole coordinates , @xmath3 , @xmath4 - effective band masses for the electron and the hole , @xmath5 the dielectric constant , and @xmath6 is the electric field",

    "we take the same size of both dots , the inevitable asymmetry between them ( due to size difference , indium composition , nonsymmetric strain , etc . )",
    "can for the limited purpose of the present paper be effectively taken into account by applying different depths of the dots .",
    "the confinement potential for the hole is of the same form , only with depths @xmath14 , @xmath15 replacing @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the bottom of the conduction band of the barrier material ( gaas ) is taken as the reference energy for electrons , and the top of the gaas valence band as the reference level for the holes , i.e. , the eigenvalues of ( 1 ) have to be shifted up by the gaas band gap to give the photon energy measured in a luminescence experiment .",
    "we previously@xcite demonstrated , that for an interacting electron - hole pair both the energy spectrum and the particle distribution are nearly the same when the asymmetry of the double well is exclusively introduced for one of the particles , since it is translated by the interaction into an asymmetry for the other particle . in this paper",
    "we assume that the dot situated on the negative side of the @xmath16 plane is deeper by 10 mev for both the electron and the hole @xmath17 mev , @xmath18 mev , and @xmath19 mev , @xmath20 mev is taken the same as in our previous paper@xcite assuming that the dots embedded in a pure gaas matrix are made of ga@xmath21in@xmath22as alloy with @xmath23 .",

    "two additional centers are placed above and below the center of each dot @xmath43 with @xmath44 optimized variationally .",
    "addition of more centers outside the plane of confinement or including more centers within it does not improve the results significantly . in the configuration basis",
    "( 3 ) we include all the single - particle wave functions obtained in a diagonalization of the electron and the hole hamiltonians each in a basis of form ( 4 ) ( with position of centers and other nonlinear parameters optimized separately for the electron and hole ) , which eventually yields 484 _ localized _ basis functions to treat the exciton .",
    "the recombination probability for the exciton state with wave function @xmath45 is calculated from the envelope wave function as @xmath46    two - dimensional version of the multicenter basis was previously used for laterally coupled dots.@xcite our study@xcite on electron systems in a single circular dot performed with a similar technique showed that the superposition of gaussians very well approximates the angular momentum eigenstates .",

    "the energy dependence of the excited bright state on @xmath45 is stronger than for the ground state .",
    "this is due to the larger electron tunnel coupling for the excited state [ see fig . [ 510 ] ] .",

    "field of 20 kv / cm at @xmath71 ( @xmath61 oriented in @xmath58 direction ) reverses this relation , as the field shifts more of the electron to the upper dot when in the ground state and removes the electron from the lower dot when in the excited state . a shift of the hole distributions to the left and the squeeze of the distribution to the left side of the dot is also visible .",

    "in summary , we have shown that for vertically coupled dots their non - perfect alignment does not qualitatively influence the exciton stark effect of the electric field oriented in the growth direction .",
    "although for perfectly aligned dots the horizontal electric field only deforms the electron and hole density within each of the dots , for non - perfect alignment it leads to a redistribution of the particles between the dots , i.e. , in the direction perpendicular to the field .",
    "we demonstrated that due to the relatively strong electron tunnel coupling and strong electron confinement within each of the dots the horizontal electric field can be used to tune the electron distribution in the vertical direction only weakly affecting the electron charge distribution within each of the dots . on the other hand , due to a weaker hole confinement",
    "the horizontal field distinctly affects the hole distribution within each of the dots , and the hole transfer between the dots is rapid due to negligible tunnel coupling .",
