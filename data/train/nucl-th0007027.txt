    "unfortunately , there are little empirical information on form factors involving bottom mesons or @xmath0 states .",
    "we thus take the form factors to have the usual mono - pole form at the three - point @xmath55 channel and @xmath56 channel vertices , i.e. , @xmath57 where @xmath58 is a cutoff parameter , and @xmath59 is the squared three momentum transfer in the center - of - mass frame , given by @xmath60 and @xmath61 for @xmath55 and @xmath56 channel processes , respectively . for simplicity , we use the same value for all cutoff parameters , and choose @xmath58 as either @xmath3 or @xmath4 gev to study the uncertainties due to form factors .",
    "we also assume that the form factor at four - point vertices has the following form : @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the average value of the squared three momentum transfers in @xmath55 and @xmath56 channels .",
    "in fig .  [ sigma ] , we show the cross sections for @xmath0 absorption by @xmath1 and @xmath2 mesons as a function of the center - of - mass energy @xmath64 of the initial - state mesons .",
    "the cross section for the @xmath65 process includes contributions from both @xmath66 and @xmath67 , which have the same cross sections .",

    "we note that at a temperature of @xmath6 mev , for example , both @xmath77 and @xmath78 are only about @xmath5 mb after including the form factors .",
    "this indicates that @xmath0 absorption by hadronic comovers in the final state of high energy heavy ion collisions is not expected to be important .",

    "[ diagrams ] , respectively , and these ratios agree with the scaling relation of eq .",
    "( [ scale ] ) within 50% .",
    "as shown previously , the thermal averages of the @xmath0 absorption cross sections by pion and rho mesons are both about @xmath5 mb at @xmath82 mev , which are roughly a factor of 5 to 10 smaller than the thermal averages of @xmath83 and @xmath84 at the same temperature and with the same form factors @xcite .",
    "this is mainly due to the larger kinematic thresholds ( i.e. , @xmath85 ) for the @xmath0 absorption . with @xmath86 mev",
    ", they are @xmath87 , and @xmath88 gev , respectively , for the three processes shown in fig.[diagrams ] , compared to @xmath89 , and @xmath90 gev for the corresponding @xmath7 absorption processes .",
    "the larger threshold for @xmath0 absorption by hadrons not only prevents more light mesons from participating in the absorption process but also causes a larger reduction of the cross sections due to the form factors at interaction vertices .",
    "in our study , the hadronic lagrangian shown in eq .  ( [ lagn2 ] )",
    "is generated from the su(5 ) flavor symmetry .",
    "the resulting ppv , vvv , ppvv and vvvv interaction lagrangians are exactly the same as those in the chiral lagrangian approach @xcite .",
    "however , the su(5 ) flavor symmetry is badly broken by quark masses , especially by charm and bottom quark masses .",
    "although in our study we have used the coupling constants determined from either the vector meson dominance model or the qcd sum rules , other symmetry - breaking effects are possible and need to be further studied .",
    "there are also large uncertainties on the values of the coupling constants .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath50 given by the qcd sum rules @xcite can differ by about a factor of 2 , and the result from the lattice qcd studies @xcite is also inconclusive due to the large error bar . to include the symmetry breaking effects in hadronic models , an alternative approach @xcite based on both the chiral symmetry for light flavors and the heavy quark spin symmetry for charm and bottom flavors may be useful .",
    "since there is little experimental information available for form factors involving bottom mesons , significant uncertainties thus exist in results based on hadronic lagrangians . to reduce these uncertainties ,",
    "studies of @xmath17 meson decays will be useful .",
    "for example , the form factor for @xmath17 meson semileptonic decays @xcite , @xmath91 , may be related to the form factor for the @xmath92 vertex .",
    "recent studies based on qcd sum rules @xcite have shown that the @xmath92 and @xmath93 form factors as a function of the pion momentum roughly correspond to cutoff parameters between @xmath3 and @xmath4 gev if they are fitted with the mono - pole form . also , the form factor at the @xmath94 vertex is related to the form factors for decays such as @xmath95 @xcite .",
    "we note that the absorption cross sections of the @xmath0 by heavier mesons such as the kaon and charmed meson can be similarly calculated in our model .",
    "we have not included them in the present study as transport models have shown that the numbers of heavier mesons are much less than those of pions and rho mesons in high energy heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "we have only considered the absorption of the @xmath96 in hadronic matter .",
    "there are also heavier bound states of @xmath97 , such as @xmath98 and @xmath99 ( @xmath100 , and @xmath4 ) , which can decay into the @xmath96 . in @xmath101 collisions ,",
    "almost half of the final @xmath96 yield is from the decay of these heavier particles @xcite . to use @xmath96 as a signal for the quark - gluon plasma in heavy ion collisions thus requires also information on the absorption cross sections of these particles by hadrons . since they are less bound than @xmath96 , these heavy particles are more likely to be dissociated in both the partonic @xcite and hadronic matter @xcite",
    ". it will be useful to extend our meson - exchange model to include these heavier @xmath97 bound states in order to calculate their absorption cross sections .    in summary",
    ", we have studied the @xmath0 absorption cross sections by @xmath1 and @xmath2 mesons using a hadronic lagrangian based on the su(5 ) flavor symmetry . including form factors with a cutoff parameter of @xmath3 or @xmath4 gev at the interaction vertices",
    ", we find that the values for @xmath68 and @xmath69 are about @xmath70 mb and @xmath3 mb , respectively .",
    "however , due to the large kinematic threshold , their thermal averages at a temperature of @xmath6 mev are both only about @xmath5 mb . our results thus suggest that the absorption of directly produced @xmath0 by comoving hadrons is unlikely to be important in high energy heavy ion collisions .",
