    "solar system evolution hinges on the outcome of collisions . in order for planetary accretion to proceed , for example",
    ", collisions must result in larger , not smaller pieces .",
    "asteroid dynamical families are in most cases thought to be the outcome of catastrophically disruptive collisions between parent bodies ; smaller asteroids and interplanetary dust may be the result of collisional cascades ; asteroid and planetary binaries ( ida and dactyl , pluto and charon , earth and moon ) may also be an expression of impact .",
    "impacts or collisions can be grouped in three different categories depending on outcome : cratering , shattering and dispersing .",
    "the first category is defined by events leading to the formation of topographical signatures ( craters ) accompanied by ejection of material but without affecting the physical integrity of the main body .",
    "shattering impacts , on the other hand , are events that break the parent body into smaller pieces . dispersing events are those which not only break the body into pieces , but also manage to impart velocities to those fragments in excess of escape velocity .",
    "much observational evidence testifies to these most energetic events : the dynamical asteroid families for example ( such as koronis ) , and the iron meteorites which are fragments excavated by impact from the cores of differentiated bodies .",
    "it has become customary in the literature to characterize impacts in terms of a specific energy threshold ( the kinetic energy in the collision divided by target mass ) .",
    "the threshold for a shattering event is defined by @xmath0 , the specific energy required to break a body into a spectrum of intact fragments , the largest one having exactly half the mass of the original target . dispersing events , on the other hand ,",
    "are defined by @xmath1 , the specific energy required to disperse the targets into a spectrum of individual but possibly reaccumulated objects , the largest one having exactly half the mass of the original target . in the strength regime , where gravity does not matter (",
    "fragments do not reaccumulate ) , @xmath0is obviously equal to @xmath1 . in the gravity regime",
    "however , @xmath1is always greater than @xmath0 , since the target must be fragmented and also _ dispersed _ by the event .",
    "laboratory experiments can be designed to determine this threshold for small targets , i.e. targets in the strength dominated regime ( see for example fujiwara _",
    "et al .  _ 1989 ; davis & ryan 1990 ; ryan _ et al .",
    "_ 1991 ) . by using up to meter - sized targets , housen and holsapple ( 1999 ) were able to confirm previous theoretical prediction of strength weakening with size .",
    "impacts in pressurized targets ( housen 1991 ) designed to simulate self - gravitating bodies indicate that strength increases again in these `` larger '' targets .",
    "however , these artificially pressurized targets are uniformly compressed while in truly self - gravitating bodies the overburden is a function of position .",
    "the interpretation of these experiments is therefore not completely straightforward .",
    "the scales of planetary impacts are far different from what can be studied directly in the laboratory , and extrapolations by more than a dozen orders of magnitude in mass are required before reaching a range relevant to asteroids and/or planetesimals .",
    "detailed theoretical models of disruptive impacts ( holsapple & housen 1986 ; housen & holsapple 1990 ; holsapple 1994 ) try to bridge this gap by establishing relations among non - dimensional ratios involving impactor size , impact velocity , target strength , density , etc .",
    "such relations , deriving from dimensional analysis , assume uniformity of process , structural continuity and other idealizations , and can not predict detailed outcomes .",
    "recent exponential increases in computational power have enabled numerical simulations to become the method of choice to investigate these issues in greater detail .",
    "laboratory impact experiments are used to validate the numerical models on small scales before extrapolations to sizes relevant to solar system bodies are undertaken . however",
    ", numerical attempts to determine @xmath1have for the moment been limited to idealized geometry ( two - dimensional axisymmetry ) ( ryan & melosh 1998 ) or restricted to a subset of target sizes ( gravity regime ) ( melosh & ryan 1997 ; love & ahrens 1996 ) and low resolution ( love & ahrens 1996 ) .    in this paper , we use a smooth particle hydrodynamics method ( sph ) to simulate colliding basalt and icy bodies from cm - scale to hundreds of km in diameter , in an effort to define _ self - consistently _ the threshold for catastrophic disruption .",
    "unlike previous efforts , this analysis incorporates the combined effects of material strength ( using a brittle fragmentation model ) and self - gravitation , thereby providing results in the `` strength regime '' and the `` gravity regime '' and in between .",
    "we begin with a short presentation of the physical model ( section [ sec : physics ] ) followed by a discussion of various numerical issues pertaining to our study ( section [ sec : numerics ] ) .",
    "the results obtained from 480 different simulations are presented and discussed in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "our approach of dynamical fracture modeling has been described in detail elsewhere ( benz and asphaug 1994 , 1995 ) and will only be summarized here .",
    "the equations describing an elastic solid are the usual conservation equations ( mass , momentum and energy ) in which the stress tensor has a non - diagonal part , the so - called deviatoric stress tensor . with the assumption that the stress deviator rate is proportional to the strain rate , i.e. hooke s law , and a suitable equation of state ( see section [ subsec : eos ] ) it is possible to numerically solve this set of coupled differential equations .",
    "plasticity is introduced by suitably modifying the stresses beyond the elastic limit using a von mises yielding relation .",
    "not counting the equation of state , this approach requires 3 material - dependent constants : @xmath2 the shear modulus , @xmath3 elastic limit and @xmath4 the melt energy used to decrease the elastic limit with increasing temperature .",
    "young s modulus can be computed from the knowledge of the bulk modulus ( parameter @xmath5 in section [ subsec : eos ] ) and the shear modulus according to @xmath6 .",
    "for the lower tensile stresses associated with brittle failure , we use a fracture model based on the nucleation of incipient flaws whose number density is given by a weibull distribution ( weibull 1939 ; jaeger & cook 1969 )    @xmath7    where @xmath8 is the number density of flaws having failure strains lower than @xmath9 .",
    "the weibull parameters @xmath10 and @xmath11 are material constants which can be determined from laboratory experiments comparing failure stress to strain rate , although data are scarce .",
    "table [ tab : matcon ] gives the numerical values of these material - dependent constants used in this study .",
    "the weibull parameters for basalt are a previously - determined ( benz & asphaug 1995 ) best match to the laboratory impact experiments of nakamura & fujiwara ( 1991 ) ; parameters for ice are derived by fitting a line to the measurements of rate - dependent fracture stress published in lange & ahrens ( 1983 ) .    once flaws are activated , fractures grow at constant velocity , about half the sound speed . the extent to which fracture affects the local properties of matter",
    "is described by a scalar state variable called _",
    "damage_. the possible values for @xmath12 range between @xmath13 ( undamaged ) to @xmath14 ( totally damaged ) . the ability to sustain shear or tension by individual particles is reduced linearly with @xmath12 and vanishes for @xmath15 . because damage accrues according to the entire stress history of a parcel of matter , only lagrangian solutions to the hydrodynamics equations are applicable .    our model of dynamic fragmentation",
    "explicitly reproduces the growth of cracks in a brittle elastic solid by rupturing bonds and forming new free surfaces .",
    "cracks grow when local failure strains are exceeded , and stresses are relieved across the crack boundaries .",
    "the release of stress along fracture walls increases differential stress at the crack tips , driving cracks forward in the manner of an actual brittle solid .",
    "tensile and shear stresses are unsupported across disconnected regions , leading to reduced average strength and sound speed ( i.e. damage ) in the body . by producing actual cracks and fragments , our method at sufficiently high resolution automatically takes into account friction between fragments and bulking , effects which are included as recipes in statistical damage models .",
    "we used the so - called tillotson equation of state ( tillotson 1962 ) which was specifically derived for high - velocity impact computations .",
    "this equation has the advantage of being computationally expedient while sophisticated enough to allow its application over a wide regime of physical conditions .    for compressed regions and for cold expanded states where the energy density ( @xmath16 ) is less than the energy of incipient vaporization ( @xmath17 )",
    "the tillotson eos has the form :    @xmath18 \\ ; \\rho \\ , e      + a \\ , \\mu + b \\ ,",
    "\\mu^{2 } \\label{eq : tillc}\\ ] ]    where @xmath19 and @xmath20 , such that @xmath21 is the compressed density and @xmath22 is the zero - pressure density . here",
    "@xmath23 and @xmath24 are referred to as the material - dependent tillotson parameters .    for expanded states ,",
    "when the internal energy ( @xmath16 ) is greater than the energy of complete vaporization ( @xmath25 ) , the pressure has the form    @xmath26 \\ ;        e^ { - \\alpha \\ , ( \\rho_{0 } \\ , /\\rho - 1)^{2 } } \\label{eq : tille}\\ ] ]    where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are constants that control the convergence rate of the equation to the perfect gas law .",
    "for intermediate states , pressure is simply interpolated linearly between both expanded and compressed states .",
    "tillotson parameters for a variety of geologic materials have been compiled by melosh ( 1989 ) . however , the most fundamental coefficients ( especially density and bulk modulus ) for candidate materials are typically different from those reported for specimens used in laboratory impact fragmentation experiments , from which our weibull coefficients ( table 1 ) are derived .",
    "we therefore make the following alteration to the equations of state , in an effort to best characterize the material in the fragmentation experiments : we substitute the measured density for the published tillotson reference density of the most similar material , and the measured bulk modulus for the tillotson parameter @xmath5 . because the tillotson parameter @xmath29 is not known for the specific target material , we make use of the fact that @xmath30 for most geologic materials .",
    "this is probably a good assumption for basalt but may underestimate the second - order pressure terms in ice , making it more  rock - like \" .",
    "we summarize in table [ tab : tillotson ] the tillotson parameters used in this paper .",
    "this situation is not ideal .",
    "however , given the rudimentary understanding of asteroidal and cometary compositions ( they are surely neither pure basalt nor pure water ice ! ) , we feel that there is little to be gained until comprehensie experimental work , combining dynamic strength and equation of state , can be performed on more representative candidate materials at the appropriate temperature .",
    "in this section we discuss various issues related to the numerical methods used to either simulate the impacts or analyze the results of the simulations .",
    "fracture depends on the entire stress history of a given piece of material .",
    "a lagrangian approach , in which the frame of reference is attached to the material , is therefore the natural framework for solving the equations briefly described in section [ sec : physics ] ; eulerian codes to date can not accurately follow stress history and the development of cracks .",
    "conventional lagrangian codes , however , are unable to handle large material deformations , as tangling and deformation of the grid severely affect the accuracy of derivatives .",
    "smooth particle hydrodynamics ( see reviews by benz 1990 ; monaghan 1992 ) does not suffer from this problem .",
    "we have developed a three - dimensional sph code capable of simulating dynamical fracture of brittle material ( benz & asphaug 1994 , 1995 ) .",
    "our sph code being an explicit code , the size of the time step is limited by the courant condition . in practice , this means that the time step can not exceed a fraction of the time needed by an elastic wave to cross a resolution element .",
    "if this element is of size @xmath31 , numerical stability requires that @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the wave speed . with 42,000 particles ,",
    "@xmath31 is of order @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the target radius . as an estimate for wave speed",
    "we take @xmath36 where @xmath5 is the bulk modulus . taking the values appropriate for basalt",
    ", we get @xmath37 km / s which leads to an upper bound for the time step given by @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is in seconds and @xmath35 in km .",
    "gravitational clumping of fragments and the formation of rubble piles on the other hand takes place on a dynamical timescale given by @xmath40 . for basalt",
    ", we obtain a value for the clumping timescale of @xmath41 s. the number of timesteps required to follow a collision up to the time where gravitational reaccumulation occurs is therefore @xmath42 . for targets of radius 100 m",
    ", this requires a number of timesteps greater than @xmath43 , which is currently prohibitive .",
    "while these two vaslty different timescales prevent us from simulating the entire process directly , they also mean that self - gravitation is entirely decoupled from the impact phase for intermediate targets ( see asphaug 1997 ) .",
    "clumping can therefore be studied independently as part of the postprocessing analysis of the impact simulations proper ( see section [ subsec : frag ] ) .",
    "this has also the additional advantage not having to solve poisson s equation ( self - gravity ) during the impact phase .",
    "we therefore use a faster linked list in rank space algorithm to find the neighbor particles rather than a hierarchical tree . while the dynamical effects of self - gravity are not included in the simulations , the fracture shielding effect due to compression is included in the code(see section [ subsec : flaw ] ) .",
    "the code s behavior in the elastic regime was extensively tested against simple analytical solutions , while the fracture modeling was tested by simulating laboratory impact experiments ( nakamura and fujiwara 1991 ; ahrens and rubin 1993 ) leading to core - type and radial fragmentation and extensive spallation .",
    "the code was able to reproduce the laboratory experiments to a level of detailed accuracy never achieved before , including shape , ejection speed and rotation of fragments , trajectories of far - field fracture , and post - fragmentation sound speed relationships .",
    "we use the explicit flaw assignment procedure described in benz & asphaug ( 1995 ) using the material - dependent weibull parameters listed in table [ tab : matcon ] .",
    "our explicit flaw method improves upon the mixed explicit - implicit method of benz & asphaug ( 1994 ) .",
    "these methods are wholly independent of numerical resolution ( in terms of the assigned flaw statistics ) and lead to rate- and size - dependent fracture thresholds .",
    "each particle is assigned a number of discrete fracture thresholds distributed at random from the underlying weibull distribution ( eq .",
    "when local stresses exceed such a threshold , damage @xmath12 is allowed to grow until the local stresses decrease again , or until @xmath12 reaches its maximum authorized value .",
    "this maximum authorized value for particle @xmath44 is given by @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the currently active number of flaws and @xmath47 the number of fracture thresholds assigned to particle @xmath44 .",
    "this particular algorithm of damage accrual and authorization ensures that flaw distribution and activation are not linked to numerical resolution .",
    "for fracture to proceed , stresses must first overcome the local gravitational overburden .",
    "to include what amounts to an effective _ gravitational strengthening _ without having to solve the full poisson equation during the simulations , we use the technique ( asphaug and melosh 1993 ) of adding to the local stress tensor ( determined from solving the elasto - dynamical equations ) an isotropic lithostatically equilibrated stress ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "the sum , the  total fracture stress \" , is converted into a weibull strain for use in eq . 1 by dividing the largest tensile principal stress by the modified young s modulus , as pioneered by melosh",
    "_ et al .  _",
    "note that the difference between the rock fracture stress and the total fracture stress is negligible for targets smaller than a few 10 s of km radius , and that for larger targets , strengthening towards the interior may be due as much to thermodynamical processes ( annealing ) than to gravity per se .",
    "as outlined above , late time gravitational evolution can for intermediate size targets be decoupled from the impact physics itself .",
    "thus , we perform the characterization of the collisional outcome as a postprocessing step .",
    "our approach to find the final collisional outcome proceeds in two steps .",
    "first , and regardless of target size , we begin by searching for intact ( undamaged ) fragments , i.e. fragments that are held together by material strength alone .",
    "our method makes no assumptions regarding their number , geometry , or location , as they are a natural outcome of the fracture trajectories resulting from a given simulation .",
    "contrary to statistical fragment approaches , our fragments are explicitly defined by the network of cracks resulting from the impact .",
    "we use a friends - of - friends algorithm to identify individual monolithic fragments defined as contiguous regions of particles held together by strength and surrounded by strengthless or empty regions . at the end of this procedure , we obtain for each fragment its mass , position , velocity , angular momentum and moment of inertia .",
    "this is the  shattering \" spectrum of fragment sizes discussed in the introduction .",
    "as soon as the target size exceeds 50 - 100 m , searching for intact fragments is no longer sufficient , as some of them may be able to reaccumulate due to gravity , leading to remnants incorporating multiple fragments .",
    "we search for these gravitationally - bound aggregates by applying a well known iterative procedure adapted from the techniques used in simulations of galaxy formation .",
    "the procedure starts by computing the binding energy of all particles and/or fragments with respect to the largest fragment , or if too small , the particle closest to the potential minimum .",
    "this serves as the seed for nucleating the total bound mass .",
    "unbound particles are discarded , and the center of mass position and velocity of the aggregate is computed .",
    "the binding energy of all the remaining fragments and particles with respect to this new position and velocity is again computed .",
    "unbound particles are again discarded and the procedure iterated until no particles are discarded .",
    "typically , convergence is achieved after a few iterations ( @xmath49 ) with only very few particles being lost after the first 2 - 3 steps .",
    "finally , we check that particle / fragment members of this gravitationally bound aggregate are also close spatially , using again a friends - of - friends algorithm .",
    "mass , position , velocity , angular momentum and moment of inertia are also determined for this gravitationally bound aggregate , which can be made of a collection of smaller fragments and/or individual particles . because of the limited number of particles used , we limit our search to the single largest aggregate and do not attempt to search for smaller ones .",
    "the algorithm has been tested extensively in both the strength and gravity dominated regime by comparing end results of simulations with predictions made at early times by the cluster finding algorithm . to overcome the time step problem in the gravity dominated regime ,",
    "purely hydrodynamical simulations were used to allow the code to compute to sufficiently late times .    for each simulation ,",
    "we therefore identify and characterize the largest object present at the end of the collision .",
    "this object may either be an intact fragment ( in the strength dominated regime ) or a gravitationally bound aggregate of fragments ( gravity dominated regime ) . in the latter case",
    ", we also search for the largest intact fragment belonging to the aggregate ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : impcart ] ) , e.g. the largest component of the resulting `` rubble - pile '' .",
    "we have considered 8 different target radii : 3 cm , 3 m , 300 m , 1 km , 3 km , 10 km , 30 km , and 100 km , and two different material types : basalt and ice . for each target",
    "we have computed impacts for five angles of incidence measured from the surface normal : 0 , 30 , 45 , 60 , and 75 degrees . for each material",
    "we have considered two impact velocities : for icy targets 0.5 km / s and 3 km / s ; for basalt targets 3 km / s and 5 km / s . in each case , @xmath1was computed from a parabolic fit to three different simulations in which only the impactor mass was modified .",
    "the entire study therefore represents a total of 480 different simulations which were automatically handled by special  driver \" software .",
    "as each simulation can take up to a few days of high performance workstation time , this represents a significant body of computational effort .",
    "because of the statistical nature of this study , we had to limit ourselves to a relatively small number of particles . in all cases , we used @xmath50 particles to model the target .",
    "this number was found in convergence - test comparisons between numerical simulations and laboratory impact experiments ( benz & asphaug 1994 , 1995 ) to be sufficient to determine reliably the characteristics ( size , velocity and rotation ) of the largest fragment .",
    "thus in all what follows , we shall concentrate only on the characteristics of the largest fragment .",
    "the projectile was modeled using @xmath51 particles for the @xmath52 km / s and @xmath53 km / s impacts and @xmath54 for @xmath55 km / s impacts since in this case the impactor was much larger .",
    "( in fact , in the case of @xmath56 km large icy targets and large incidence angles the required projectile for a given value of @xmath57 was sometimes bigger than the target ! )",
    "the simulations were carried out in time until no further significant changes occurred in the extent of damage endured by the target and in the velocity of the ejected particles .",
    "for a given impact geometry , velocity and target ( parent body ) material , @xmath1is determined by interpolation between three different simulations spanning a range of incident kinetic energy per unit target mass ( @xmath57 ) chosen to yield largest remnant masses ( @xmath58 ) generally in the range @xmath59 . in the expression above , @xmath60 represents the mass of the largest remnant ( including gravitational reaccumulation if applicable ) and @xmath61 the mass of the parent body ( or target ) . a parabolic fit ( @xmath62 ) to these results is computed and @xmath1determined by solving for @xmath63(@xmath1)@xmath64 .",
    "the results of these calculations are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : qbas3kms ] , [ fig : qbas5kms ] , [ fig : qice3kms ] and [ fig : qice05kms ] for the various velocities and material type . in these figures ,",
    "each dot represents the value of @xmath1determined from the parabolic fit .",
    "the dots corresponding to the same angle of incidence of the projectile are connected by a solid line .",
    "we recover in these figures the well known functional dependency of @xmath1with target size , namely that @xmath1decreases with size for small targets while it increases with size for larger targets .",
    "these two behaviors correspond to collisions occurring in a strength or gravity dominated regime .",
    "the transition between the two regimes occurs in the range @xmath65 for both ice and basalt .",
    "we note that for a given target size , @xmath1is a strong function of the projectile s angle of incidence .",
    "differences in @xmath1between a head - on and a @xmath66 degree impact reach about a factor 10 .",
    "the increase of @xmath1 in the gravitational regime is due to two factors .",
    "the most important is the fact that even though bodies exceeding 1 km in radius are almost entirely shattered ( see section [ subsec : largestf ] ) in a @xmath1collision , the pieces do not all disperse because their relative velocities are smaller than the escape velocity of the aggregate .",
    "hence , for catastrophically disrupted and dispersed bodies larger than @xmath67 km , all the largest remnants are found to be gravitationally bound aggregates of smaller fragments .",
    "the second effect is due to gravitational shielding of the central region of the target ( see section [ subsec : flaw ] ) but as we shall see in section [ subsec : largestf ] this affects only the largest targets in our mass range .    in many studies ,",
    "one is not interested in the outcome of a particular collision but rather in the collisional evolution of an entire population .",
    "for these statistical studies , we can compute an effective threshold which is independent of angle of incidence , namely @xmath1@xmath68 averaged over all possible impact geometries but at fixed relative velocity .",
    "for an isotropic distribution of incoming projectiles ( at infinity ) , shoemaker ( 1962 ) showed that the probability distribution for impacting with an angle between @xmath27 and @xmath69 is given by    @xmath70    regardless of a planet s mass . using this probability distribution ,",
    "we define a mean catastrophic disruption threshold @xmath71 by    @xmath72    this integration is carried out numerically with a simple trapezoidal method and using the @xmath1@xmath68 determined from the simulations .",
    "the results are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : qbasmean ] for basalt targets and in fig .",
    "[ fig : qicemean ] for icy targets .    in order to compare with disruption thresholds published in the literature and to allow these results to be used by others",
    ", we fitted ( by eye ) an analytical curve to @xmath73 of the following functional form    @xmath74    where @xmath75 is the radius of the parent body ( or target ) , @xmath21 the density of the parent body ( in g/@xmath76)and @xmath77 constants to be determined .",
    "this functional form is often encountered in scaling law approaches with the two terms representing the two distinct physical regimes dominating the dynamics : 1 ) material strength ( first term on the right , with @xmath78 ) and 2 ) self - gravity ( second term on the right , with @xmath79 ) .",
    "the values obtained for the coefficients are listed in table [ tab : qbarcon ] and the fits are represented as lines on figs . [ fig : qbasmean ] and [ fig : qicemean ] .    note that the slopes in the gravity regime ( @xmath80 ) are somewhat different between basalt and ice , and even for ice the two slopes corresponding to the two velocities differ slightly .",
    "this could be related to the fact that for equal mass targets , ice material is lifted from an initially higher potential ( less negative potential energy ) corresponding to the larger equal - mass target diameter . alternatively , because the shock imparts different velocities to fragments according to different material characteristics ( the velocity field determines the subsequent gravitational reaccumulation ) , equation of state distinctions sensitive to both material type and impact speed may be the culprit .    also note that in the gravity regime , faster impacts are less disruptive than slower impacts of the same energy , for both rock and ice .",
    "this is due to the greater efficiency of momentum coupling for slower impacts .",
    "the governing factor for gravity regime disruption is not shattering , but motion towards gravitational separation .",
    "for basalt , this trend continues into the strength regime , although that is coincidental , since the strength regime depends on entirely different aspects of collisional physics ( flaw activation ) . for ice ,",
    "the opposite is true : slower impacts ( of the same energy ) result in less disruption .",
    "evidently ice is easier to fracture at high strain rates than at low strain rates , relative to basalt .",
    "this is either because it has more flaws available at low activation energies ( consistent with its weibull distribution ) , or because vaporization at high impact speed may contribute to fragmentation , which is not the case for the subsonic ( 500 m / s ) collisions .",
    "now we compare our averaged dispersion threshold with other published values in fig .",
    "[ fig : compq ] . in this figure , we reproduced the _ disruption _ thresholds obtained either from scaling laws or numerical simulations in the strength or gravitational dominated regime . for small targets ,",
    "our estimate of the threshold agrees well with the determination of holsapple ( 1994 ) .",
    "the largest differences occur for large targets for which we predict that they are significantly stronger ( more difficult to disrupt and disperse ) than previously estimated .",
    "this does not arise due to a significant change of slope ( notice our slope is close to the one predicted by holsapple 1994 or melosh & ryan 1997 ) but because the turn over from strength to gravity dominated targets occurs at smaller sizes .",
    "we also display in fig .",
    "[ fig : compq ] the recent determination of @xmath1by durda _ et al .  _",
    "their curve is determined by requiring that numerical models of the collisional evolution of the main belt asteroids fit the observed size distribution of these objects .",
    "interestingly , they obtain that objects of order 100 - 200 m in diameter are the weakest objects , a conclusion confirmed by our simulations .",
    "however , besides the agreement on the size of the weakest objects , our results ( as well as all other determinations of @xmath1 ) , differ from the results of durda _ et al .",
    "_ by an order of magnitude or more .",
    "the origin of this discrepancy is not clear . on one hand",
    ", we note that the values of @xmath1determined by durda _",
    "et al .  _",
    "are not obtained from a simple fit to observed sizes but assume an underlying collisional model which might not be predicting accurately collisional outcomes . on the other hand , it may also be possible that asteroidal material has very different mechanical properties than the material tested in the laboratory .",
    "as already noticed by many ( most recently by ryan and melosh 1998 ) , the efficiency at which the kinetic energy is transmitted from the impactor to individual fragments is extremely low .",
    "since the largest remnants in collisions involving targets larger than 1 km are gravitationally bound rubble piles ( see section [ subsec : largestf ] ) their mass is determined ultimately by the velocity distribution imparted to the fragments during the impact .",
    "a fragment will remain bound if its velocity remains below the escape velocity of the aggregate of all slow moving fragments .",
    "this explains why targets as small as 1 km radius are already significantly strengthened by gravity against dispersal .    for a given material type",
    ", the radius of the weakest object @xmath81 , is obtained by finding the radius for which @xmath82 . from equation [ eq : qfr ] the value of the radius of the weakest object is given by    @xmath83    table [ tab : rweak ] gives the values derived for @xmath84 using the values of the parameters listed in table [ tab : qbarcon ] . for both materials and impact speeds , @xmath85 100200 m.",
    "these values are smaller than those derived in other studies .",
    "for example , holsapple ( 1994 ) based on scaling laws gives 3 km as the transition point between the two regimes .",
    "melosh & ryan ( 1997 ) as well as love & ahrens ( 1996 ) from numerical simulations give numbers in the range 200 - 400 m .",
    "while a collision occurring at @xmath1leaves by definition a largest remnant with mass equal to half the target mass , collisions occurring with different @xmath57 leave remnants of different masses .",
    "we can therefore use all our simulations ( whose intent was to bracket @xmath1 ) to investigate how the mass of the largest remnant depends upon the incident kinetic energy per gram of target material ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "[ fig : icemfq ] and [ fig : basmfq ] show the dependency of the mass of the largest fragment on the impact energy obtained in our simulations . to facilitate the interpretation of these results ,",
    "the impact kinetic energy per gram of target material has been normalized to @xmath1for each target size and projectile angle of incidence .",
    "all simulations ( 120 ) involving a given material type and impact velocity have been plotted on the same plot .",
    "the different symbols correspond to targets of different sizes .",
    "these figures clearly show that when normalized to @xmath1the relative mass of the largest remnant is a well - defined , simple function of @xmath57 and is independent of target size and/or angle of incidence .",
    "the dependence upon these parameters enters only in @xmath1 !",
    "the increased scatter in the points for small mass fragments is probably due to the inherent numerical difficulties in resolving these smaller objects ( at fixed resolution ) .",
    "this relationship is remarkable since the mass of the largest remnant is not determined by a single process , but either by material strength or gravity depending on target size ! in this regard it is interesting to note that in the case of low velocity collisions on icy targets the correlation is significantly worse , especially for large targets ( @xmath86 km ) .",
    "it is unclear why this is the case ; however , in these cases it is worth pointing out that , due to the low velocity , the projectile is sometimes as big as the target and that the relative velocity is significantly smaller than sound speed , indicating that there might be a different disruption regime at low velocity .    except for the case discussed above , we find that the relative mass of the largest remnant can be well represented by the following expression and that this single expression holds for targets ranging from 3 cm to 100 km and angles of incidence between 0 and 75 degrees .",
    "@xmath87    these lines are drawn on the various figures and their slopes are remarkably similar : for basalt @xmath88 for @xmath89km / s , @xmath90 for @xmath91km / s and for ice @xmath92 for @xmath91km / s . the case for ice at @xmath93 km / s for some still unknown reason does not yield such a tight relation .",
    "we have not attempted a real fit to the data and only plot the line derived for the @xmath91 km / s .",
    "we now determine the largest _ intact _ ( unshattered )",
    "fragment , @xmath94 , in collisions occurring at @xmath1 . here by undamaged we mean a fragment for which material strength still plays an important role in the cohesive properties of the object even though the fragment may no longer have its original strength .",
    "we are looking for the largest boulder in the final rubble - pile .",
    "for each target radius and projectile angle of incidence , we obtain from the three simulations performed a parabolic relation @xmath95 .",
    "we determine @xmath94 by setting @xmath96 where @xmath1has been determined using the parabolic fit described in section [ subsec : qcrit ] .",
    "the values obtained for the mass of these largest intact fragments are displayed in figs .",
    "[ fig : fraginice ] and [ fig : fraginbas ] for both material types and impact velocities .",
    "not surprisingly , for small targets ( @xmath97 m ) the largest undamaged fragment is equal to half the original target mass regardless of impact parameter .",
    "this is simply because in the strength dominated regime the mass of the largest intact fragment is equal to half the target mass by definition of @xmath1 . however , for targets larger than @xmath98 m and regardless of material type and/or impact velocity , the mass of the largest intact fragment drops rapidly even though the collisions occurred at @xmath1 .",
    "this reflects the fact that collisions involving parent bodies this size and larger take place in the gravity dominated regime .",
    "this regime is therefore characterized by the fact that the largest remnant is not an intact fragment but a gravitationally bound aggregate of fragments . due to the precipitous nature of these curves for target",
    "radii larger than a few 100 m , we do nt expect any monolithic object of this size .",
    "on the other hand , we expect a wide variety of internal structures for objects in the 30 m - 300 m range .    for the largest targets considered in this study we notice a marginal trend for @xmath94 to rise again .",
    "this effect is due to gravitational strengthening of the target discussed in section [ subsec : flaw ] .",
    "however , we stress that this effect is only of moderate importance : the main role of gravity in this size range is to allow for the formation of gravitationally bound rubble piles .",
    "gravitational strengthening appears also to be strongly dependent on initial impact parameter .",
    "for example , in the case of an icy target of 100 km radius a grazing impact occurring at @xmath1and with an incidence angle of @xmath99 leaves behind a largest undamaged fragment of @xmath100 while at @xmath101 the same fragment is smaller than @xmath102 .",
    "final objects in the range @xmath103 are found to be essentially gravitationally bound aggregates of smaller fragments . whether or not observed asteroids and comets in this size range are indeed rubble piles depends upon whether they have suffered a @xmath1collision during their history .",
    "further complications exist ; for example , asphaug _ et al . _ ( 1998 ) have shown that target geometry ( shape ) and internal structure ( pre - fracture ) can significantly influence collisional outcome .",
    "the spherical homogeneous intact solids considered here may be idealized . a  contact binary \" asteroid may for instance suffer catastrophic disruption of its impacted lobe , with little or no disruption occurring on its unimpacted lobe .",
    "a target which is _ already _ a rubble - pile may similarly be more difficult to disperse by impact , due to the inefficient coupling of impact energy .      for each target size , material type and impact parameter we determined the ejection velocity of the largest mass remnant in each of the three simulations bracketing @xmath1 .",
    "we note that this velocity is not related in a straightforward manner to the usual energy partitioning coefficient , @xmath104 , namely the fraction of kinetic energy going into fragment kinetic energy .",
    "given that the kinetic energy is _ not _ distributed uniformly over all fragments , but rather carried away by a small amount of mass moving very fast , we believe the coefficient @xmath104 to be of little use to address the dynamics of the largest fragments .",
    "we therefore focus our attention on determining the actual velocity of the largest fragment or aggregate in each simulated collision , numerical resolution preventing us from studying the smaller ones .",
    "these ejection velocities as a function of normalized fragment mass are displayed in figs.([fig : vbas5kms ] , [ fig : vbas3kms ] , [ fig : vice3kms ] , [ fig : vice05kms ] ) for both material types and collision velocities .",
    "velocity is measured relative to the center of mass of the original target .    in each figure",
    ", the upper panel shows the actual ejection velocity .",
    "each different symbol corresponds to a different initial target size regardless of angle of incidence .",
    "the lower panel shows the ejection velocity normalized to the target s escape velocity for initial targets greater that 1 km .",
    "we note that for a given parent body size , larger remnants have lower ejection velocities regardless of angle of incidence .",
    "in fact , it is remarkable how little influence the impact parameter seems to have on the ejection velocity of the largest remnant . for each target size , the ejection velocity of the largest remnant is to a good approximation a simple decreasing linear function of its fractional mass ( in the domain @xmath105 ) .",
    "in addition , we note that for the largest fragments , i.e. the one for which gravity is the dominant cohesion force , we can almost remove the target size dependence by normalizing the ejection velocity by the parent body s escape velocity . in other words ,",
    "the outcome velocity of the largest fragment normalized to initial target escape velocity is ( within some considerable scatter ) independent of target size and impact parameter .",
    "the fact that the velocity of the largest remnant is a relatively constant fraction of the target s escape velocity is probably due to the a priori requirement that in the gravitational regime about half of the initial mass must escape .    in order to gain insight regarding which collisions lead to the fastest moving largest remnants , we have analyzed how the ejection velocities depend upon the ratio of impactor to target size , @xmath106 .",
    "we stress again that because of numerical resolution , we are able to analyze only the largest remnants and not the entire ejecta distribution .",
    "thus , it is unrealistic from our data to determine the actual kinetic energy transfer efficiency @xmath104 .    figs .",
    "[ fig : basvr ] and [ fig : icevr ] display the ejection velocity of the largest remnants as a function of @xmath106 regardless of angle of incidence .",
    "the two different symbols correspond in each cases to the two different impact velocities .",
    "apparent from these figures is the fact that the ejection velocity rises with @xmath106 in a monotonic fashion .",
    "the `` width '' of the curve is mainly determined not by scatter but by the relation between ejection velocity and remnant mass ( see section([subsec : vejec ] ) .",
    "thus , regardless of angle of incidence , collisions will give rise to fast moving remnants if the size of the impactor becomes comparable to the size of the parent body .",
    "in regard to the collisional origin of asteroid families , we note that velocities of order 100 m / s are easily obtained for basaltic targets provided the impactor size is at least about half the parent body size .",
    "we have presented a self - consistent three - dimensional treatment of impact disruption leading from the laboratory and the strength regime , where our sph code has been exhaustively calibrated and tested , all the way out to the gravity regime collisions responsible for the formation of asteroid families and planetary accumulation .",
    "while some parameters ( such as shape and pre - fragmentation and rotation ) have yet to be fully explored ( see for instance asphaug _",
    "et al . _ 1998 ) the 480 runs summarized here provide a robust constraint on the outcome of catastrophic collisions .",
    "in particular , we have demonstrated that bodies  100 - 200 m radius ( depending on impact speed and composition ; see table 4 ) are the weakest objects in the solar system , with all bodies this size and larger being dominated by self - gravitational forces , rather than material strength , with regard to impact disruption .",
    "this enhanced role of gravity is not due as usually assumed to fracture prevention by gravitational compression .",
    "it is due to the difficulty of the fragments to escape their mutual gravitational attraction .",
    "owing to the generally low efficiency of momentum transfer in collisions , the velocity of larger fragments tends to be small , and more energetic collisions are needed to disperse them .",
    "remarkably , the efficiency of momentum transfer ( while still small ) is found to be larger for larger projectiles .",
    "thus , at a fixed collisional energy , a low velocity high mass projectile will lead to a higher fragment velocity that a small mass high speed projectile .",
    "this increased role of gravity implies that the threshold for disruption is actually significantly larger than previously assumed .",
    "the upshot of this is that any catastrophic collisions leading to disruption _ must _ occur at an energy far exceeding the threshold for shattering the parent body .",
    "these necessarily high strain rate collisions imply by the nature of the fracturing process that many cracks must grow to release the stresses , preventing any sizeable fragment from surviving .",
    "thus , catastrophic collisions of this nature can only result in the formation of gravitationally bound aggregates of smaller fragments .",
    "we shall continue to examine the outcome of these simulations for information regarding angular momentum transfer during impact , and for anticipated cumulate structures for large fragments from large parent bodies , motivated by the possibility of re - creating the events which led to the formation of known asteroid families ( benz and michel , in preparation ) . as available computing power permits , a more detailed parameteric exploration ( varying weibull coefficients , shape and internal structure ) is someday hoped for .",
    "as it stands , our chosen materials ( basalt and ice ) represent broad - based choices , and the fact that both give similar results implies that catastrophic disruption is perhaps not very material dependent .",
    "if that is the case , then the simple and robust relations presented here , for the mass of the largest remnant in an impact event , and for the ejection velocity of the largest remnant , are appropriate for a new generation of calculations modeling the accretion of planets in ours and other solar systems .",
