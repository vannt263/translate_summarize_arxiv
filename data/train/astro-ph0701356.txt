    "the discovery of hot jupiters that transit in front of their parent stars has advanced our knowledge of extrasolar planets adding a fundamental datum : the planetary radius .",
    "there has been considerable activity revising the measured radii , owing to uncertainties in the differential image analysis ( see pont et al . 2006 ) .",
    "it is important to obtain accurate radii from photometry , in order to compare these exoplanets with the giant planets of the solar system , and with the models .",
    "in addition , if accurate photometry of transits is available , one can use timing for future studies of multiplicity in these systems ( e.g. sartoretti & schneider 1999 , miralda - escude 2002 , holman & murray 2005 , agol et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "new samples of transiting hot jupiters should become available soon ( see for example fischer et al .",
    "2005 , sahu et al .",
    "2006 ) , but up to now the ogle search has provided the largest number of transiting candidates . in particular , udalski et al .",
    "( 2002 ) discovered very low amplitude transits in the @xmath5 , @xmath6 magnitude star ogle - tr-111 , located in the carina region of the milky way disk , at @xmath7 , @xmath8 .",
    "they monitored 9 individual transits , measuring an amplitude @xmath9 mag , and a period @xmath10 days .",
    "the period is a near - multiple of a day , therefore , the window for transit observations is restricted to a couple of months per year .",
    "the planet ogle - tr-111-b was discovered by pont et al .",
    "( 2004 ) with precise velocity measurements .",
    "they measured @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 .",
    "they call this planet the `` missing link '' because of the relatively long period , which overlaps with the planets discovered by radial velocity searches .",
    "ogle - tr-111-b is one of the least irradiated known transiting extrasolar planets , ( baraffe et al . 2005 , laughlin et al . 2005 ) , and therefore it is also an interesting case to study because it may probe the transition region between strongly irradiated and isolated planets .",
    "we have previously carried out a selection of the most promising ogle planetary candidates using low dispersion spectroscopy in combination with optical and near - infrared photometry ( gallardo et al . 2005 ) .",
    "this work identified ogle - tr-111 as one of the most likely candidates to host exoplanets .",
    "gallardo et al .",
    "( 2005 ) classify ogle - tr-111 as a k - type main sequence star with @xmath14 k , located at a distance @xmath15 pc , with magnitudes @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath16 , and reddening @xmath17 .",
    "their low dispersion spectrum shows strong mgb band characteristic of a metal - rich dwarf .",
    "they find that this star is intrinsically fainter ( @xmath18 ) , and smaller ( @xmath19 ) than the sun .",
    "based on the high dispersion spectroscopy , pont et al .",
    "( 2004 ) derive similar stellar parameters for ogle - tr-111 : temperature @xmath20 k , gravity @xmath21 , mass @xmath22 , radius @xmath23 , and metallicity @xmath24=0.12 $ ] dex .",

    "the values from these independent studies agree within the uncertainties .",
    "the known planetary parameters are in part based on the ogle photometry",
    ". there has been recent revisions of the radii of other confirmed ogle planets using high cadence , high s / n photometry with large telescopes ( see pont et al .",
    "recently , winn et al . ( 2006 ) presented accurate photometry of two transits for ogle - tr-111 in the @xmath28-band , revising the ephemeris , obtaining a period @xmath29 , and measuring the system parameters , including an accurate stellar radius @xmath30 , and planet radius @xmath31 .",
    "this planet radius is @xmath32 larger than the recent value of santos et al .",
    "( 2006 ) . in this paper",
    "we present new high cadence @xmath0-band photometry covering a transit of ogle - tr-111 , giving an independent determination of the planetary radius , and deriving an accurate period for the system .",
    "the observations and photometry are described by fernndez et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and daz et al .",
    "the photometric observations were taken with vimos at the unit telescope 4 ( ut4 ) of the european southern observatory very large telescope ( eso vlt ) at paranal observatory during the nights of april 9 to 12 , 2005 .",
    "the vimos field of view consists of four ccds , each covering 7@xmath338 arcmin , with a separation gap of 2 arcmin , and a pixel scale of 0.205 arcsec / pixel .",
    "the large field of view of this instrument allows to monitor simultaneously a number of ogle transit candidates , in comparison with fors at the vlt , which has a smaller field of view ( fernndez et al .",
    "however , for high precision photometry of an individual candidate fors should be preferred because its finer pixel scale allows better sampling ( e.g. pont et al .",
    "2006 ) . here",
    "we report on the observations of ogle - tr-111 , which was located in one of the four monitored fields , and it happened to have a transit during the first night of our run .",
    "we used the bessell @xmath0 filter of vimos , with @xmath34 , @xmath35 .",
    "the @xmath0-band was chosen in order to complement the ogle light curves which are made with the @xmath28-band filter .",
    "in addition , the @xmath0-band is more sensitive to the effects of limb darkening during the transit , and is adequate for the modeling of the transit parameters .",
    "we have monitored two fields on april 9 , 2005 , one of which included the star ogle - tr-111 .",
    "the fields were observed alternatively with three exposures of 15s before presetting to the next field . for this program we managed to reduce the observation overheads for telescope presets , instrument setups , and the telescope active optics configuration to an absolute minimum .",
    "this ensured adequate sampling of the transit : we obtained 224 points during the first night in the field of ogle - tr-111 .",
    "the observations lasted for about 9.5 hours , until the field went below 3 airmasses .    in order to reduce the analysis time of the vast dataset acquired with vimos , the images of ogle - tr-111 analyzed here are 400@xmath33400 pix , or 80 arcsec on a side .",
    "each of these small images contains about 500 stars with @xmath36 that can be used in the difference images , and light curve analysis .",
    "the 7 best seeing images ( @xmath37 ) taken near the zenith were selected , and a master image was made in order to serve as reference for the difference image analysis ( see alard 2000 , alard & lupton 1998 ) .",
    "the candidate star is not contaminated by faint neighbours , judging from our deep @xmath0 and @xmath38-band images .",
    "there is a @xmath39 mag star 2 arcsec south of our target , which does not affect our photometry .",
    "the difference image photometry yields a noisier light curve with a low amplitude transit , and we decided to apply the ogle pipeline dia ( udalski et al .",
    "this new reduction showed significantly reduced photometric scatter .    for ogle - tr-111 , with a mean visual magnitude @xmath5",
    ", we achieved a photometric accuracy of @xmath40  @xmath41 magnitudes .",
    "the errors mainly depend on the image quality , which was worse at the beginning and end of the time series , when the target had large airmass .",
    "figure 1 shows the light curve for the first night of observations , when the ogle - tr-111 transit was monitored .",
    "every single datapoint is shown , no mesurement is discarded . for comparison ,",
    "figure 1 also shows the phased light curve of the ogle @xmath28-band photometry ( in a similar scale ) .",
    "the transit is well sampled in the @xmath0-band , and the scatter is smaller .",
    "there are @xmath42 points in our single transit shown in figure 1 , and the minimum is well sampled , allowing us to measure an accurate amplitude . in the case of ogle , the significance of the transits is in part judged by the number of transits detected . in the case of the present study",
    ", we compute the signal - to - noise of the single , well sampled transit . for ogle - tr-111",
    "we find the s / n of this transit to be @xmath43 following gaudi ( 2005 ) .",
    "however , this does not include systematic effects ( red noise ) , which we consider below .",
    "after the ogle 2002 transit campaign , the field of ogle - tr-111 was observed by the ogle survey regularly but less frequently with the main aim of improving the ephemeris .",
    "altogether more than @xmath44 new epochs were collected in the observing seasons 20032005 .",
    "unfortunately , there were no eclipses observed between 2002 and april 2005 , when ogle started recovering eclipses .",
    "this is because this system has a near multiple of a day period .",
    "the full ogle photometric dataset covering almost 350 cycles made it possible to significantly refine the ephemeris of ogle - tr-111 : @xmath45 ( udalski et al . 2005 , private communication ) .",
    "the vimos transit reported here also agrees with this ephemeris , as discussed in section 5 .",
    "in light of the high dispersion follow up of this target by pont et al . ( 2004 ) that confirmed the low mass of ogle - tr-111-b , we can consider that the transit measured here is representative of all transits of ogle - tr-111-b .",
    "unfortunately , just a single transit was measured here , and only in the @xmath0-band filter , but it is of value because we used a different passband that previous works and can therefore independently check the parameters for the system .",
    "for example , the stellar limb darkening is different from the @xmath28-band , with transits that are shallower at the edges but about @xmath46 deeper in the central parts ( e.g. claret & hauschildt 2003 ) .",
    "there are a few published measurements of the radius of the ogle - tr-111 companion , based on the ogle photometric data ( table 1 ) .",
    "udalski et al .",
    "( 2002 ) measured @xmath9 mag , and estimated @xmath47 for ogle - tr-111 , and a lower limit of @xmath48 for its companion , arguing this was one of the most promising extrasolar planetary transit candidates . based on a fit to the same ogle data , silva & cruz ( 2006 ) estimated @xmath49 for the companion .",
    "pont et al .",
    "( 2004 ) give @xmath50 for ogle - tr-111 , and @xmath51 for its companion , also using on the ogle data .",
    "gallardo et al .",
    "( 2005 ) measure @xmath52 for ogle - tr-111 , and @xmath53 for its companion , also based on the ogle amplitude .",
    "figure 2 shows our best fit to the transit curve , following mandel & agol ( 2002 ) , using appropriate limb - darkenning coefficients for the @xmath0-band .",
    "this fit yields @xmath54 mag , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 .",
    "using @xmath57 gives @xmath58 .",
    "the uncertainties of the fit parameters were estimated from the @xmath59 surface . as shown by pont ( 2006 ) , the existence of covariance between the observations produces a low - frequency noise which must be considered to obtain a realistic estimation of the uncertainties . to model the covariance we followed gillon et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and obtained an estimate of the systematic errors in our observations from the residuals of the lightcurve .",
    "the amplitude of the white ( @xmath60 ) and red ( @xmath61 ) noise can be obtained by solving the equation system presented in their equations ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) . repeating our procedure for similar vlt data on ogle - tr-113 ( daz et al .",
    "2006 ) , we estimated the white noise amplitude , and the low - frequency red noise amplitude , and then , the surface which determines the uncertainty interval .",
    "the projections of the @xmath59 surface to estimate the uncertainties of the fit parameters are shown in figure 3 , as done by daz et al .",
    "( 2006 ) for ogle - tr-113 .",
    "the light curve was also fitted to obtain the transit time , by fixing the other parameters ( a , r@xmath62 and i ) .",
    "for example , the regions for @xmath63 ( only white noise , without systematics ) , and @xmath64 ( with white + red noise , including systematics ) for the fit parameters as function of the transit time are marked in figure 4 .    at this point , the major uncertainty on the ogle - tr-111-b planetary radius arises from the uncertainties in the stellar properties .",
    "note that we do not fit the star radius simultaneously using the photometry as done by winn et al .",
    "( 2006 ) . adopting @xmath19 from gallardo et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , we obtain @xmath65 . adopting @xmath57 from santos et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , we obtain @xmath66 .",
    "the unweighted mean of these two independent determinations is @xmath67 .",
    "however , we will adopt the spectroscopic determination of santos et al .",
    "( 2006 ) of @xmath57 , instead of the one from gallardo et al .",
    "( 2005 ) for two main reasons .",
    "first , the santos spectroscopic data are more recent and of higher quality , resulting on a complete analysis of the composition and stellar parameters based on high dispersion spectroscopy , while gallardo give an indirect determination based on the surface brightness .",
    "second , in order to allow a direct comparison with the results of winn et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , who also adopt the mass from santos et al .",
    "( 2006 ) .",
    "table 1 lists the previous estimates of the size for the ogle - tr-111 transiting planet @xmath68 from the literature , and this work , along with the stellar parameters .",
    "the agreement of the most recent values to within about @xmath32 implies that the radius of this planet is known .",
    "the unweighted mean of the radii measured by santos et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , winn et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , and this work is : @xmath69    with this radius , ogle - tr-111-b does not seem to be oversized for its mass , its gross properties ( mass , radius , mean density ) being similar to the jovian planets of the solar system , as listed for example by guillot ( 2005 ) .",
    "ogle - tr-111-b is the least irradiated of the known transiting extrasolar planets , with equilibrium temperature @xmath70 ( baraffe et al . 2005 , laughlin et al .",
    "2005 , lecavelier des etangs 2006 ) .",
    "it lies at the cool end of the distribution of the other transiting hot jupiters ( @xmath71 ) , but it is still warmer than the solar system giants ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "thus , ogle - tr-111-b is not only a missing link regarding its orbital properties , as suggested by pont et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , but also may probe the transition between strongly irradiated and more isolated planets .",
    "it is interesting to compare ogle - tr-111-b with hd209458b , which has a similar mass ( @xmath73 ) , and orbital semimajor axis ( @xmath74 ) . yet",
    "the radius of hd209458b is about 40% larger than the radius of ogle - tr-111-b measured here ( laughlin et al .",
    "2005 , baraffe et al . 2005 ) .",
    "two main effects could produce this large difference .",
    "first , hd209458b is inflated by stellar irradiation , which is smaller for ogle - tr-111-b .",
    "the difference in incident flux is a factor of 4 according to baraffe et al .",
    "this irradiation difference is mostly because the primary star hd209458 ( @xmath75 ) , is hotter than ogle - tr-111 ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "second , the presence of a massive solid core in ogle - tr-111-b might make its radius smaller in comparison with hd209458b .",
    "models predict that the presence of a massive solid core should reduce the radius of a giant planet significantly ( saumon et al .",
    "1996 , burrows et al .",
    "2003 , bodenheimer et al .",
    "2003 , sato et al .",
    "2006 , guillot et al .",
    "for example , the reduction in radius is @xmath77% for a @xmath78 planet with a @xmath79 core with respect to a planet with a small core .",
    "it has been recently realized that it is very important to measure the transit times accurately , because of the exciting possibility of using these times for future studies of multiplicity in these systems ( holman & murray 2005 , agol et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "winn et al . ( 2006 ) measure two transits accurately , giving an improved period of : @xmath80 the mean transit times measured by winn et al .",
    "( 2006 ) are : @xmath81= 2453787.70854 \\pm 0.00035,$ ] and @xmath81= 2453799.75138 \\pm 0.00030.$ ] these transits are separated by 3 cycles , and we use their mean along with our own observations to compute a more accurate period .",
    "the vlt transit occurred 80.5 cycles before the mean of the transits observed by winn et al .",
    "the mean transit time measured at the vlt is : @xmath81= 2453470.56397 \\pm 0.00076,$ ] and the final period measured here is : @xmath82 this period is independent of the ogle photometry , but it is consistent with the ogle data .",
    "the errors include the systematic errors ( figure 4 ) .",
    "therefore , our improved ephemeris for the mean transit times of ogle - tr-111-b is : @xmath83 where the numbers in parenthesis indicate the errors in the last two digits of their respective quantities .    adopting the ephemeris of winn et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , the mean predicted time is off from the center of our transit , which occurs about 5 minutes earlier .",
    "in fact , the period determined here is more than @xmath84 away from the period measured by winn et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , or @xmath85 away using our larger errorbars ( that include systematics ) . nonetheless , we believe that it is accurate , because it relies on their two well sampled transits as well as our single transit .",
    "interestingly , there is a difference with the previous measured periods.such difference can arise in the presence of another massive planet in the system , which is the main motivation for measuring accurate timing of this planet . with the present data , however , it can not be claimed that this is the case : we can not yet rule out a constant period .",
    "more transits should be accurately measured in the following seasons to follow up this interesting system and confirm or rule out variations in the mean transit times .    due to the period very close to @xmath86 ,",
    "about 20 consecutive full transits can be observed during a season for a period of three months , and then they are not observable again for a period of about six months . with the new ephemeris we are able to predict that the next observable series of transits of ogle - tr-111 occur around december 2006 , and then again in mid-2008 , as shown in figure 5 .",
    "it is evident that the window of opportunity for accurate photometric measurements of the transits for this target is small .",
    "an alternative way to track another massive planet in the system is to perform radial velocity follow - up with no critical time of observational windows , even though this method is time consuming and difficult for such a faint candidate .",
    "udalski et al . ( 2002 ) discovered low amplitude transits in the main sequence star ogle - tr-111 , which we observed with vimos at the eso vlt .",
    "the planet ogle - tr-111-b is a massive planet with mass @xmath2 ( pont et al .",
    "we were able to accurately sample one low amplitude transit on this star with high cadence observations , complementing the recent measurement of two transits by winn et al .",
    "we improve upon the parameters of the transit , in particular measuring the transit time , @xmath87 hours , the orbital inclination @xmath88 , and the orbital semimajor axis @xmath89 .",
    "these data are in agreement with the orbital parameters measured by radial velocities and with the stellar parameters .",
    "\\(1 ) we measure an accurate radius based on vlt transit photometry and revised stellar parameters .",
    "we obtain @xmath66 , which for a mass of @xmath11 , gives a density of @xmath3 .",
    "thus , the planet of ogle - tr-111 has a radius similar to jupiter , and a mean density that resembles that of saturn .",
    "the ogle - tr-111-b planet does not appear to be significantly inflated by stellar radiation like hd209458-b .",
    "\\(2 ) using newly available transits from winn et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , we are able to measure accurately the orbital period of this interesting system , @xmath90 as well as to update the ephemeris .",
    "the timing is different from previously published values , but there is not yet sufficient data to claim time variations caused by another massive planet in the system . follow up of the ogle - tr-111-b transits is warranted in the next observable transit windows around december 2006 and mid-2008 .",
