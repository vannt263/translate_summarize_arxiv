    "flavor conversions of supernova neutrinos are a fascinating problem involving refractive effects that not only depend on the ordinary matter background  @xcite , but also on the neutrino fluxes themselves .",
    "indeed , neutrino - neutrino interactions provide a non - linear term in the equations of motion  @xcite that causes collective flavor conversions  .",
    "since few years  @xcite it has realized that in the sn context these self - induced effects give rise to qualitatively new phenomena ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "the main consequence of this unusual type of flavor transitions is an exchange of the spectrum of the electron species @xmath0 ( @xmath2 ) with the non - electron ones @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) in certain energy intervals , giving rise to interesting spectral features  @xcite .",
    "these flavor exchanges are called `` swaps '' marked by the `` splits '' , which are the boundary features at the edges of each swap interval .    in this context ,",
    "one of the main complication in the simulation of the flavor evolution is that the flux of neutrinos emitted from a supernova core is far from isotropic .",
    "the current - current nature of the weak - interaction hamiltonian implies that the interaction energy between neutrinos of momenta @xmath5 and @xmath6 is proportional to @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the neutrino velocity  @xcite . in a non - isotropic medium",
    "this velocity - dependent term would not average to zero , producing a different refractive index for neutrinos propagating on different trajectories .",
    "this is the origin of the so - called `` multi - angle effects ''  @xcite , which hinder the maintenance of the coherent oscillation behavior for different neutrino modes  @xcite .",
    "all the numerical simulations of supernova neutrino flavor conversions have characterized the multi - angle effects in the so called `` bulb model ''  @xcite in which neutrinos are assumed spherically emitted at the neutrino - sphere at a radius @xmath9 .   zenith angle distributions at the neutrinosphere has been discussed in  @xcite . ]",
    "global spherical symmetry was also assumed in the neutrino propagation , reducing to an axial symmetry of the multi - angle effects along the radial line - of - sight ( polar axis ) .",
    "therefore , at any radius @xmath10 along the polar axis , neutrinos with different momenta @xmath5 ( characterized by @xmath11 ) were identified by the only zenith angle at the emission @xmath12 .",
    "the underlying assumption in the bulb model is that small deviations with respect to a perfect axial symmetry , would not significantly affect the neutrino flavor evolution .",
    "this unjustified assumption has been questioned in a recent paper  @xcite , in which the authors investigated the effect of relaxing the axial symmetry , performing a linearized stability analysis of the sn neutrino equations of motion , introducing the azimuthal angle of neutrino propagation @xmath13 as explicit variable .",
    "the stability analysis , as described in  @xcite , would allow one to determine the possible onset of the flavor conversions , seeking for an exponentially growing solution of the eigenvalue problem , associated with the linearized equations of motion for the neutrino ensemble .",
    "surprisingly it has been found that even assuming a completely spherically symmetric neutrino emission at the neutrinosphere , without forcing the neutrino ensemble to follow the axial symmetric solution , a new `` multi - azimuthal - angle '' ( maa ) instability would emerge in addition to the one caused by the `` multi - zenith - angle '' ( mza ) effects . in particular , considering simple neutrino ensembles with only @xmath0 and @xmath1 , the instability has been found in normal mass hierarchy ( nh , @xmath14 ) , where the system would have been stable imposing the perfect axial symmetry .",
    "subsequently , the role of these instability has been clarified in  @xcite , where it has been shown with simple toy models that , introducing small deviations in the assumed symmetries of the initial conditions in a dense @xmath15 gas , new instabilities would be triggered .",
    "once this new instability has been found in the dense sn neutrino gas , numerical simulations of the flavor evolution are mandatory in order to characterize how the instable system evolves . at this regard ,",
    "the main aim of this work is to perform a numerical study of the sn neutrino flavor evolution including both neutrino zenith and azimuthal propagation angles .",
    "it it known that the development of self - induced flavor conversions in sne , as well as their dependence on the neutrino mass hierarchy , is crucially dependent on the flux ordering among different neutrino species . since",
    "our primary goal is to have a first characterization of possible effects induced by the maa instability , we will consider simple neutrino systems , whose flavor evolution is well understood in the axial symmetric case .",
    "we leave the study of more complicated spectral configurations to future works .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in sec .  2 we present the neutrino equations of motion without imposing axial asymmetry . in sec .",
    "3 we show the results for the flavor evolution of a monochromatic beam of @xmath0 and @xmath16 with different initial flavor asymmetries , in the presence of only maa and both maa and mza effects .",
    "we find that independently of the initial flavor symmetry , the maa effects trigger new flavor conversions in the ( otherwise stable ) nh case .",
    "these lead to a flavor decoherence of the neutrino ensemble . in sec .",
    "3 we also include the effect of continuous energy spectra .",
    "we consider a system with an excess of @xmath0 over @xmath16 , whose spectra are represented by fermi - dirac distributions .",
    "again we find new flavor conversions in nh case .",
    "remarkably , the flavor evolution crucially depends on the asymmetry among @xmath0 and @xmath16 .",
    "if it is sufficiently large , final spectra show an ordered behavior with spectral swaps and splits .",
    "conversely , for small flavor asymmetries decoherence among angular modes develops , affecting the flavor evolution also in inverted mass hierarchy ( ih , @xmath17 ) . finally , in sec .",
    "4 we summarize our results and we conclude .",
    "we work in a two - flavor oscillation scenario , associated to the atmospheric mass - square difference @xmath18  ev@xmath19 and and with the small ( matter suppressed ) in - medium mixing @xmath20 .",
    "since we aim at isolating the effect of the maa instability , we assume in the following that self - induced flavor conversions are not matter suppressed ( as expected instead at @xmath21  s after the core bounce )  @xcite , ignoring the ordinary matter background in the equations of motion .    we still assume that variations in the transverse direction are small so that the flavor evolution depends only on @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath8 .",
    "in other words , we study neutrino propagation only in the neighborhood of a chosen location and do not worry about the global solution  @xcite .",
    "we assume neutrinos to be emitted half - isotropically at the neutrinosphere , that here we schematically fix at @xmath24  km . for simplicity",
    ", we neglect possible residual scatterings that could affect @xmath15 s after the neutrinosphere , producing a small `` neutrino halo '' that would broaden the @xmath15 angular distributions  @xcite .",
    "if we describe neutrinos by their local velocity @xmath8 , the zenith angle of a given neutrino trajectory with respect to the radial direction @xmath25 , due to flux conservation will depend on the radial coordinate @xmath22 even for straight line propagation .",
    "it is thus convenient to parameterize every zenith angular mode in terms of its emission angle @xmath26 relative to the radial direction of the neutrinosphere .",
    "a further simplification is obtained if one labels the different zenith angular modes in terms of the variable @xmath27 , as in  @xcite . at a radius @xmath22 ,",
    "the radial velocity of a mode with angular label @xmath28 is @xmath29  @xcite and the transverse velocity is @xmath30  @xcite .",
    "conventionally , we use negative @xmath23 for anti - neutrinos and we label the different energy modes by the vacuum oscillation frequency @xmath31 . then , following  @xcite , we define the flux matrices @xmath32 as function of the radial coordinate , where @xmath13 is the azimuth angle of @xmath33 .",
    "the diagonal @xmath34 elements are the ordinary number fluxes @xmath35 at a radius @xmath22 .",
    "the off - diagonal elements , which are initially zero , carry a phase information due to flavor mixing .",
    "the flux matrices are represented by polarization vectors @xmath36 in the usual way , @xmath37 where @xmath38 are the flavor fluxes at the neutrinosphere radius @xmath39 . following  @xcite",
    ", we introduce the dimensionless spectrum @xmath40 , representing @xmath41 .",
    "it is negative for antineutrinos , where @xmath42 , and normalized to @xmath43 flux , i.e. @xmath44 .",
    "we introduce the @xmath45 asymmetry parameter @xmath46 , where @xmath47 . in the following",
    "we will always assume axial symmetry of the neutrino emission and half - isotropic zenith angle @xmath15 distributions .",
    "therefore , at the neutrinosphere @xmath48 .",
    "we write the compact form of the the equations of motion ( neglecting matter effects ) for the flavor - spin polarization vectors  @xcite and @xmath43 of the same flavor have polarization vectors which point in opposite directions  @xcite .",
    "this formalism allows to write in a compact from the equations of motion for neutrinos and antineutrinos [ see eq .",

    "we consider both nh ( left panels ) and ih ( righ panels ) for different values of the flavor asymmetry parameter , namely @xmath73 ( upper panels ) , @xmath74 ( middle panels ) and @xmath75 ( bottom panels ) .",
    "we compare single - zenith - angle ( sza ) evolution ( dashed curves ) with @xmath76 , with the complete mza and maa cases ( continuous curves ) .",
    "we realize that in order to get numerical convergence of our results is enough to take @xmath77 angular modes in @xmath13 , while a larger number of modes is required for the mza simulations .",

    "indeed , as discussed in  @xcite for discrete azimuthal angles no spurious instabilities appear , in contrast to discrete zenith angles  @xcite .",
    "in particular , we use @xmath78 for @xmath79 $ ] and @xmath80 for @xmath81 $ ] .",
    "the most striking result of this toy model is that independently of the value of the flavor asymmetry @xmath62 , if we break the axial symmetry in the @xmath15 evolution , nh presents self - induced flavor conversions , as predicted from the stability analysis of  @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to mention that these flavor conversions develop even if here we are starting from an initial perfectly spherical @xmath15 distribution . indeed , since the system in unstable it is enough a small breaking of the perfect axial symmetry , induced the numerical noise : the small numerical seeds will be exponentially amplified during the flavor evolution .",
    "the effect of @xmath62 is to shift the onset of the flavor conversions , i.e. the largest @xmath62 the greatest the onset radius of the flavor conversions .",
    "this relation is qualitatively similar to what already found for the bimodal flavor evolution  @xcite .",
    "it is also interesting to notice that mza effects do not seem to play an important role in changing the flavor dynamics .",
    "the final outcome is generic : the maa effect leads to a final @xmath82 that would imply a flavor decoherence leading to a mixture of @xmath1 and @xmath72 . of course",

    "passing now to ih , we find that the onset of the flavor conversions is associated with the usual bimodal instability , leading to the well - known `` pendulum '' behaviour which tend to completely invert @xmath69 leading to a complete @xmath83 flavor change  @xcite . for @xmath84 ,",
    "maa and mza effects do not play a significant role , since one observes a `` quasi - single angle '' behavior  @xcite , driven by the bimodal instability . only for a small flavor asymmetry @xmath75",

    "this can be understood as follows .",
    "we have found that an ensemble initially composed of only @xmath0 and @xmath1 is unstable under maa effects in nh . instead , if the initial ensemble had been consisted by @xmath3 and @xmath72 , the situation would have been reversed , i.e. we would have found the maa instability for ih .",

    "<S> the flavor evolution of neutrinos emitted by a supernova ( sn ) core is strongly affected by the refractive effects associated with the neutrino - neutrino interactions in the deepest stellar regions . till now , all numerical studies have assumed the axial symmetry for the `` multi - angle effects '' associated with the neutrino - neutrino interactions . </S>",
    "<S> recently , it has been pointed out in  @xcite that removing this assumption , a new multi - azimuthal - angle ( maa ) instability would emerge in the flavor evolution of the dense sn neutrino gas in addition to the one caused by multi - zenith - angle ( mza ) effects . </S>",
    "<S> inspired by this result , for the first time we numerically solve the non - linear neutrino propagation equations in sn , introducing the azimuthal angle as angular variable in addition to the usual zenith angle . </S>",
    "<S> we consider simple energy spectra with an excess of @xmath0 over @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that even starting with a complete axial symmetric neutrino emission , the maa effects would lead to significant flavor conversions in normal mass hierarchy , in cases otherwise stable under the only mza effects . </S>",
    "<S> the final outcome of the flavor conversions , triggered by the maa instability , depends on the initial asymmetry between @xmath0 and @xmath1 spectra . </S>",
    "<S> if it is sufficiently large , final spectra would show an ordered behavior with spectral swaps and splits . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , for small flavor asymmetries flavor decoherence among angular modes develops , affecting the flavor evolution also in inverted mass hierarchy . </S>"
