    "<S> , it now seems that one has reached the end of the  spin crisis \" and the beginning of the spin problem @xcite . as it is unlikely that perturbative qcd corrections alone are enough to solve the problem </S>",
    "<S> , we should examine the possibility that at least some of the discrepancy arises in the non - perturbative regime . </S>",
    "<S> a common approach has been to calculate the desired quantities at some low scale and then evolve them , using the qcd renormalization group equations , to the experimental scale . </S>",

    "<S> the vector mesons are omitted because we are not aware of any model to extract their polarized quark distribution functions . </S>",
    "<S> once again we need a model for the bare quark distributions in the nucleon and , as before , we use the mit bag model . for the polarized case </S>",
    "<S> we need to specify the spin - flavor part of the wave function . </S>",
    "<S> we shall use the usual @xmath71 wave function in which case , for the interference terms , we have :    @xmath72    @xmath73    we notice that in the matrix elements ( [ f14 ] ) and ( [ f15 ] ) only mixed symmetric terms contribute and , as a consequence , the intermediate state always forms a spin vector .    </S>",
    "<S> the first moment of the polarized structure function for the proton , @xmath74 , is expressed in nlo as :    @xmath75    with @xmath76 and @xmath77 nonsinglet distributions and @xmath78 a singlet distribution . </S>",
    "<S> however , the full singlet anomalous dimensions ( for any moment ) for polarized scattering in nlo are still not known and , because of that , it is not possible to calculate the @xmath4 dependence of @xmath78 in nlo . faced with this problem , we decided to take the following two approaches to the evolution of @xmath68 :    @xmath79 in the first approach , * case ( a ) * , we evolve @xmath76 and @xmath77 as nonsinglet in nlo and evolve @xmath78 as a singlet in lo so that @xmath78 does not pick up the @xmath80 correction and the whole structure function is overestimated .    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath79 in the second approach , * case ( b ) * , we treat @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 as nonsinglet combinations and evolve them in nlo . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath78 picks up a correction of the form @xmath81 such that the corrections due to the nlo evolution are overstimated and the structure function is underestimated </S>",
    "<S> . the actual curve must be somewhere between the two approaches .    in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] we show the emc and earlier slac data for @xmath82 together with the bare bag , the bag plus mesons but without the @xmath5-@xmath6 mixing terms and the bag plus mesons plus mixing terms . </S>",
    "<S> we stress that the parameters for the bare bag differ significantly from those used in earlier calculations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the meson cloud lowers the bag model prediction over the entire range of @xmath4 , in accordance with earlier estimates for the ellis - jaffe sum rule in the bag @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is because some of the spin of the nucleon is carried as angular momentum by the mesons . the actual value of the calculated ellis - jaffe sum rule at @xmath83drops from 0.209 in the bare bag to @xmath84 in the bag plus mesons for case ( a ) and to @xmath85 for case ( b ) . the actual value of the sum rule in the bag model plus mesons , calculated using eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ f16 ] ) as it stands , is @xmath86 , supporting our claim that the full nlo prediction for the @xmath4 dependence of @xmath87 in the present model is somewhere between the results for case ( a ) and ( b ) of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the inclusion of vector mesons is expected to reduce the value of the sum rule somewhat more .    the @xmath4 dependence for the model , compared with the slac e143 data @xcite for @xmath74 , is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig5 ] , and is quite impressive . </S>",
    "<S> this data was taken at an average @xmath88 and has smaller error bars than earlier experiments . </S>",
    "<S> comparison with this set is also a good test of our model once we have to move to a different @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting agreement between theoretical and experimental values for @xmath70 is inspiring and provides some confidence in the model . at this value of @xmath38 </S>",
    "<S> the calculated value for the ellis - jaffe sum rule is @xmath86 for case(a ) and @xmath89 for case ( b ) .    </S>",
    "<S> these results shed light on how the spin in the physical proton is shared , suggesting strongly that mesons are responsible for part of the dilution of the spin . in general </S>",
    "<S> , we can say that the agreement between the data and the theoretical calculation is very impressive and that further corrections might well bring the entire curve within experimental errors . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , we know that in the axial gauge the axial anomaly is related to the polarized gluon distribution @xcite . in this context , we think that a reasonable polarized gluon distribution @xcite could bring the curve down in the region @xmath90 .    </S>",
    "<S> we would also like to call attention to the role of the @xmath5-@xmath6 mixing term . </S>",
    "<S> as said before , it tends to increase the ellis - jaffe sum rule . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , if the mixing terms were absent , the new value of the sum rule at @xmath91 would be @xmath92 for case </S>",
    "<S> ( a ) and @xmath93 for case ( b ) . for the @xmath38 </S>",
    "<S> compatible with the slac e143 data , these values would be reduced to @xmath94 for case ( a ) and to @xmath95 for case(b ) . </S>",
    "<S> figures 2 and 3 tell us that the rise of @xmath74 due to the mixing terms is confined to the region @xmath96 . </S>",
    "<S> this is because for the mixing term , the mass of the intermediate state is always @xmath48 , and then the contribution is isolated at smaller @xmath4 when compared with the other contributions ( similar to the down quark distribution in the bag @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the most interesting effect associated with the mixing terms can be observed in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig8 ] , where @xmath97 is shown . </S>",
    "<S> although in @xmath74 the effect of the mixing terms in the @xmath4 distribution is not too dramatic because one is adding a small number to a large number , in @xmath97 the effect is relatively large because one is subtracting from numbers near to zero . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , for @xmath97 the mixing terms are essential to give to the theoretical curve the shape of the experimental data as measured by the slac e142 @xcite experiment . </S>",
    "<S> the first moment of the calculated polarized distribution of the neutron turns out to be @xmath98 for case ( a ) and @xmath99 for case ( b ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is also worth noticing that there is a consistency between the calculation of @xmath100 and @xmath101  the same calculation that fits the unpolarized data also makes a good prediction for both @xmath100 and @xmath101 .    </S>",
