    "in recent years , enormous progress had been achieved in experimental realization of artificial gauge fields with ultracold atoms @xcite .",
    "it gives rise to the new era in quantum simulation of solid - state phenomena , such as the quantum hall effect @xcite , spin - orbit coupling @xcite , majorana fermions @xcite , to name a few .",
    "this breakthrough is mainly conditioned by high degree of atom state controllability , allowing to reduce undesirable concomitant factors which lead to fast decoherence of quantum states in solid - state experiments .",
    "however , we have to account for mechanismes of decoherence which are relevant for ultracold atoms , like optical lattice amplitude noise @xcite or spontaneous emission @xcite .    in the this work we consider dynamics of ultracold atoms with artificial spin - orbit coupling in the presence of optical lattice fluctuations .",
    "attention is focused on influence of noise on rabi inter - level oscillations .",
    "it is well - known that rabi coupling for spin - orbit coupled states leads to onset of the zitterbewegung ( zb ) oscillations .",
    "the term zb means specific trembling motion originally predicted by schrdinger for relativistic dirac electrons @xcite .",
    "basically , zb occurs as a consequence of coupling between states with different velocities .",
    "the phenomenon of the zb with ultracold atoms was considered , for example , in refs .",
    "we are interested in influence of lattice amplitude fluctuations on zb oscillations .",
    "we consider the experimental setup where spin - orbit coupling is created by means of the raman dressing scheme @xcite .",
    "lattice fluctuations are introduced using the harmonic noise @xcite . in the present work",
    "we restrict ourselves by the case of non - interacting atoms .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ model ]",
    "we introduce the model under consideration .",
    "section [ momentum ] represents the analytical solution for rabi oscillations in the absence of noise .",
    "noise influence on rabi oscillations is studied in section [ rabi ] .",
    "effect of the zitterbewegung is considered in section [ zb ] . in section [ discuss ]",
    "we summarize the results obtained and outline possible ways for further research .",
    "consider gas of ultracold non - interacting @xmath0rb atoms with mass @xmath1 and momentum @xmath2 moving in an external magnetic field and an optical field of two raman lasers with orthogonal linear polarizations .",
    "frequency difference between the two lasers is @xmath3 and the @xmath4-projection of wave vector difference is @xmath5 .",
    "magnetic field results in zeeman splitting of the triplet state @xmath6",
    ". laser field induces transitions between three hyperfine states @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 . setting laser frequency difference @xmath3 to be close to the frequency splitting @xmath10 between @xmath7 and @xmath8 states",
    ", we can neglect the level @xmath9 due to the quadratic zeeman effect .",
    "therefore we have an effective two - level ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) system with the hamiltonian @xcite @xmath13 - \\frac{\\hbar\\omega_z}{2}\\hat\\sigma_3 , \\label{ham}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 are the pauli matrices and @xmath15 is the rabi frequency ( fixed by the intensity of the lasers ) .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) is characterized by equal contributions of rashba and dresselhaus couplings . in the absence of lattice fluctuations , the terms @xmath16 and @xmath17 read @xmath18 lattice fluctuations can be incorporated into the hamiltonian by means of the replacement @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the two - dimensional ornstein - uhlenbeck process , also called harmonic noise .",
    "harmonic noise is described by the coupled stochastic differential equations @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a positive constant , and @xmath23 is gaussian white noise .",
    "it should be emphasized that terms @xmath20 and @xmath24 have to correspond to the same realization of noise @xmath25 in order to provide wavelike form of @xmath16 and @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "power spectrum of harmonic noise has an unique peak at frequency @xmath26 width of the peak is given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 it is important to note that elimination of the hyperfine level @xmath9 requires @xmath29 if @xmath30 , then @xmath31 in the present work we consider values of @xmath22 in the range @xmath32 . if we set @xmath33 mhz , as in @xcite , the corresponding laser bandwidth should be @xmath34 hz .",

    "the only exception is the case of exact resonance @xmath103 ( not shown in the figure ) .",
    "dominance of the state @xmath11 is especially apparent in the case of @xmath104 , when the trajectory only slightly deviates from the upper bound @xmath105 .",
    "indeed , far from resonance ( [ res ] ) right - hand side terms in ( [ ab ] ) rapidly oscillate with time and can be averaged out .",
    "therefore , rabi oscillations are suppressed .",
    "a similar phenomenon , referred to as the coherent population trapping , was earlier observed in @xcite for two- and three - level atoms moving in a standing - wave laser field .    as noise is turned on ,",
    "a phase space trajectory corresponding to rabi oscillations is able to diffuse in phase space .",
    "so , it can drift to a region with different population dynamics , or even enter a trapping region .",

    "shows that intermittency reduces values of the time - averaged population imbalance as compared to the noiseless case .",
