    "the bepposax satellite measured x - ray bursts , identifying 14 x - ray sources as the counterparts of @xmath0-ray bursts ( see section 6 ) @xcite .",
    "the ams ( alpha magnetic spectrometer ) experiment on the space station should make a thorough search for antimatter , measure the cosmic ray composition , and perform other searches .",
    "a test flight was successful and it has already provided important information on the flux of @xmath181 , and limits on antimatter @xcite .",
    "a variety of experiments are becoming realities .",
    "for instance pamela is measuring @xmath182 of 100 - 200 gev and is making a search for @xmath183 nuclei @xcite .",
    "agile should be operative in 2002 @xcite ; it has several @xmath0 ray detectors optimized to cover different @xmath0 ray energies above @xmath184 , preliminary results have been obtained by nina , etc . @xcite .",
    "since few years , the observation of @xmath0-ray bursts ( grbs ) poses one of the main misteries of astrophysics .",
    "the @xmath0-ray observatory , on board the compton satellite , observed every day , a new @xmath0-ray burst of mev energy .",
    "the burst durations are from 30 ms to 1000s ( but this depends on the sensitivity and time resolution of the experiment : one may only see the tip of an iceberg ) .",
    "the bursts come from all directions of space ; in almost all cases they represent a single episode .",
    "the rise time of the bursts is very fast , and this suggests that they could be connected with neutron stars .",
    "measurements from the bepposax satellite observe the grbs at x - ray energies , fig .",
    "[ fig : ray ] , determining more accurately the position of the source ; they see a tail in intensity ( afterglow ) .",
    "when seeing a burst , bepposax alerts the astronomical community ; it was thus possible to observe the optical counterparts of x - ray emitters ; the optical signal lasts a few days @xcite ; at least one appeared to be at the border of a far away galaxy .",
    "it should be stressed that , even if it is seen in x - ray and in the visible , most of the emitted energy of grbs is in @xmath0 rays , at mev energies .    it would be interesting to observe the grbs at higher energies ( multi gev ) @xcite .",
    "it would even be more interesting to observe them with neutrinos ; trials are being made , but probably one needs larger neutrino telescopes , with lower energy thresholds .",
    "grand unified theories ( guts ) of electroweak and strong interactions predict the existence of magnetic monopoles ( mms ) with large mass , larger than @xmath185  gev , and magnetic charges @xmath186 , with @xmath187 .",
    "these theories leave open the question of monopole abundance .",
    "mms were probably produced in the early universe , at the end of the gut era as point defects ; others may have been produced in ultra ",
    "high energy collisions .",
    "standard cosmology predicts too many monopoles , whereas models with inflation at the gut phase transition predict very few .",
    "several superstring models predict the existence of multiply  charged mms @xmath188 . in some models , the primordial monopoles appeared when the temperature of the universe reached relatively low values .",
    "these monopoles were probably not diluted by inflation in the early universe .",
    "the existence of large  scale magnetic fields , on the galactic scale , leads to an astrophysical constraint , the so  called parker bound , with an upper limit on the monopole flux at the level of @xmath189 ; an extended parker bound leads to a flux limit almost an order of magnitude smaller .",
    "underground experiments have searched for mms in the penetrating cosmic radiation using scintillators , gas tubes , and nuclear track detectors via @xmath190 , time of flight and pulse shape analyses . at present",
    "there are only a few large experiments .",
    "they tested the sensitivity of their detectors to low velocity mms .",
    "new limits have been presented by macro @xcite and by amanda @xcite .",
    "the present limits on massive cosmic mms are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : neutral ] for @xmath191 bare poles with mass @xmath192 gev and for catalysis cross sections smaller than few mb .      analyses of the rotation curves of stars in galaxies , and of galaxies in clusters of galaxies prove ( assuming the validity of newton s law ) that most of the matter is unseen :  @xmath193 .",
    "the unseen dm could be : a ) baryonic , in the form of gas , planets like jupiter , brown dwarfs , nuclearites ; b ) non baryonic , i.e. a gas of particles .",
    "in the latter case there could be : i ) hot dm , i. e. particles which were relativistic when in the early universe they decoupled from the rest of matter and radiation ( an example could be neutrinos with a mass of a few ev ) ; ii ) cold dm , i.e. particles which were non  relativistic at decoupling ( for example the wimps , see section 3.2 ) .",
    "these particles are probably located in the galactic halos ; their abundance in the vicinity of the solar system could typically be @xmath194 , and their velocity @xmath195",
    ".    * nuclearites .",
    "* the hypothesized stable phase of quark matter , called strange quark matter or nuclearites , formed by quarks @xmath196 and @xmath197 , may be the true ground state of qcd .",
    "nuclearites could have masses ranging from a few gev to the mass of a neutron star .",
    "because of this wide range , searches were performed using a variety of experimental techniques . at this meeting new results have been presented , using techniques developed for mm searches . limits for nuclearites with masses larger than @xmath198 ( which can penetrate the earth ) are at the level of the limits of mms @xcite ; the limits are twice as large for nuclearites with m @xmath199 , which can not traverse the earth .",
    "other `` exotic '' objects , like the q - balls ( aggregates of squarks , sleptons and higgs fields ) have also been discussed at this meeting @xcite .      guts place quarks and leptons in the same multiplets .",
    "quark @xmath200 lepton transitions are thus possible and should be mediated by supermassive vector bosons @xmath201 with @xmath202 @xmath203 .",
    "a free proton may decay as @xmath204 meson(s ) or @xmath205 meson(s ) .",
    "proton decay , with a predicted lifetime of the order of @xmath206 , motivated the construction of the first underground detectors with masses of the order of @xmath207 .",
    "present detectors are either water erenkov detectors ( sk ) or tracking calorimeters ( soudan 2 ) .",
    "water detectors have larger masses and more free protons and may detect the sense of the track direction .",
    "tracking calorimeters have a higher spatial resolution and a better @xmath208 separation at energies of about @xmath209 .",
    "technical developments are being made towards a tpc type liquid chamber ( icarus ) . a @xmath210 prototype works well and a @xmath211 module is under construction .",
    "superkamiokande presented the following limits    @xmath212    at @xmath153 c.l .",
    "@xcite ; they rule out the simplest su(5 ) gut models .",
    "* lep . * the four experiments at the lep positron - electron collider provided new improved precision values of the @xmath213 lines shape .",
    "the @xmath213 mass is now known with a precision of two parts in @xmath214 , and has acquired the status of one of the three basic inputs of the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics .",
    "an important quantity derived from the line shape parameters is the number of light neutrino species which is now + @xmath215 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : width ] ; a direct method ( the neutrino counting method ) confirms this result @xcite .    from this determination one",
    "may deduce the amount of helium expected in primordial nucleosynthesis : one expects @xmath216 , in fair agreement with astrophysical data .",
    "the charged lepton universality is now established at the @xmath217 level ; the muon and the @xmath218 lepton appear more and more to be replicas of the electron .",
    "the increased energy of lep ( lep2 ) allowed to study the reaction @xmath219 , proving the existence of the triple boson vertex , @xmath220 , and a precise measurement of the @xmath221 mass , which very likely will become one of the three inputs of the sm .",
    "lep1 allowed a detailed study of qcd properties , in particular a precise determination of the strong coupling constant and of its variation with energy ( lep2 is showing that the variation continues to higher energies ) .",
    "it may be worth remembering that precision measurements lead to the first determination , below threshold , of the mass of the quark top and now gives a hint of the mass of the higgs boson .",
    "lep2 with data up to @xmath222 yields direct limits on the s.m .",

    "the earth should be continously bombarded by gravitational waves produced by distant celestial bodies subject to `` strong '' gravitational effects .",
    "the amplitude of the gravitational wave emitted by a celestial body is proportional to its mass , to its acceleration , and to the inhomogeneity in its mass distribution .",
    "gravitational waves are emitted when the quadrupole moment of an object of large mass is subject to large and fast variations .",
    "only large celestial bodies subject to unusual accelerations should produce sizeable gravitational radiation measurable on earth .",
    "these bodies may be binary systems of close - by stars ( in particular when a neutron star is about to fall on the other ) ; they yield a periodic emission of gravitational waves , with frequencies from few hundred hz to 1 mhz .",
    "asymmetric supernovae explosions may give bursts of gravitational waves , with frequencies of the order of 1 khz over few ms . also vibrating black holes , star accretions , galaxy formation , and the big bang",
    "may produce or have produced gravitational waves .",
    "a gravitational wave is a transverse wave which travels at the speed of light .",
    "a gravitational wave should modify the distances between objects in the plane perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the wave .",
    "these deformations are expected to be extremely small .",
    "it has been estimated that a star collapse at the centre of our galaxy may produce a variation of the order of @xmath229 metre per metre of separation of two objects on earth .",
