    "particle creation is an important topic in modern physics .",
    "the concept was given birth after the discovery of the inconsistency of vacuum .",
    "one of the first investigations of particle production by an expanding spacetime was first carried out by bernard and duncan in 1977 .",
    "it showed that the concept of vacuum was incorrect , since a vacuum state does produce particles in a spacetime that undergoes some form of expansion .",
    "the creation of minimally coupled scalar particles , or free bosons , will be considered in this paper .",
    "there are many important reasons to consider scalar particles .",
    "these particles are certainly generated only by the geometry of the spacetime . in the calculation of the number of these peculiar bosons",
    ", we will see that these bosons mostly are zero - mode particles .",
    "somehow , this may indicate the so - called spin-2 gravitons .",
    "the idea may also lead to an explanation of the vacuum energy divergences of bosons and fermions .",
    "clearly , particle creation occurs in pairs , _",
    "i.e. _ particles and anti - particles will be created as a pair . from the calculations in this paper",
    ", we will see that the initial vacuum state can be represented by a @xmath0-excited final vacuum state .",
    "in birrell @xcite , this topic has been investigated in a two - dimensional friedman - robertson - walker spacetime with a suitable line metric . in his analyse",
    ", the expansion of the spacetime is represented by the conformal scale factor . in this paper , however , we will investigate the same problem in term of qft . in the derivation , produced particles",
    "will be identified as excitations of an initial vacuum state of a simple harmonic oscillator . considering klein - gordon fields in an expanding spacetime represented by a time dependent energy term ,",
    "minimally coupled scalar and neutral pairs of particles will be produced .",
    "certainly , the evolution of the field is given by the so - called bogoliubov transformation and the number of produced particles is represented by the absolute square of the bogoliubov coefficient , @xmath1 .",
    "here , we consider a simple model to see how excitations of a vacuum state can occur in a usual minkowskian spacetime at distant past and distant future . actually , since the term vacuum is not adequate , it should be replaced by ground state .",
    "but for simplicity , we will not be concerned by this , so in this model we may consider the ground state as a vacuum state .",
    "the ground state at @xmath2 is associated with an initial vacuum state which evolves in time .",
    "indeed , the simplest way to start the investigation of this topic is a simple massless harmonic oscillator . for massless particles , there is equality between the momentum and the energy .",
    "later , in consideration of massive bosons , the energy @xmath3 can be written as a function of momentum @xmath4 and mass @xmath5 in a quantum theoretical way . in our case , with the assumption of a time dependent energy the corresponding hamiltonian acquires the same time dependence . by finding the probability of the transistion from the initial to the final vacuum state , excitations of the initial vacuum state",
    "will clearly be present .",
    "obviously , this will also appear in calculation of the equation of the motion .",
    "excitations of the initial vacuum state will appear in the calculations , which simply can represent production of particles due to time evolution .",
    "our starting point is a massless harmonic oscillator with a time dependent hamiltonian given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the scalsr field and @xmath8 is the momentum of the field .",

    "the ansatz of the frequency is not a function of the spatial coordinate @xmath12 , spatial translation invariance is still valid and is a symmetry of this spacetime .",
    "it is thus convenient to consider the field as a quantum field , yielding @xmath13 here , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the annihilation and creation operators and @xmath16 is the time dependent function of the field .",
