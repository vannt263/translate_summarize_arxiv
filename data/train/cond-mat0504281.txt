    "the magnitude of crystal - field splitting ( cfs ) is known to be very important characteristic of transition metal compounds , necessary for understanding different physical phenomena such as magnetism and metal - insulator transitions.@xcite it is often used for detailed fitting of spectroscopic data and in various model calculations .",
    "an important question is : how can one calculate cfs in a reliable way ?",
    "one can obtain character of cfs using the group theory analysis .",
    "it provides qualitative description of ionic levels structure in the presence of crystal - field of given symmetry and can even give some ratios between splittings using wigner - eckart theorem.@xcite however , for quantitative estimates the detailed structure of ionic potentials has to be taken into account .",
    "generally , there are different contributions to the total value of cfs to be considered .",
    "a point - charge contribution can be calculated `` by hand '' using for instance direct madelung potential summation ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "however , this method has some drawbacks and neglects the overlap of the electron clouds of neighboring ions , which can lead to several important consequences.@xcite    another important contribution comes from the covalency .",
    "it can also be estimated using some model calculations ( for instance taking slater - koster parameters ) , but without precise knowledge of the band structure one does not actually know the parameters of the models accurately enough . in order to take into consideration all these contributions to the total value of cfs in a reliable way one should use _ ab initio _ methods based on density functional theory ( dft ) calculations .",
    "nevertheless , even in this case there are several ways to define and calculate cfs .",
    "each of them has its own virtues , but also difficulties .",
    "the first possibility is a direct calculation of the center of gravity of corresponding bands .",
    "it works well when splitting is large enough .",
    "thus it is most useful and rather accurate for @xmath1 splitting ( typically in 3d - oxides cfs between @xmath2 and @xmath3 states is @xmath42 - 2.5  ev ) .",
    "for example the behavior of spin - state transition temperature in cobaltites , which depends on this splitting has been recently estimated quite accurately.@xcite the problems might arise in computation of smaller values such as the splitting inside @xmath2 or @xmath3 shells .",
    "the general problem is that cfs is a well - defined characteristic only for isolated ions which have energy levels but not bands . the bigger the corresponding band width ( in comparison with cfs ) the more questionable it becomes to treat the difference of centers of gravity as an estimate of cfs value .",
    "the second way to calculate cfs is the downfolding or projection procedure which could give a few orbital on - site hamiltonian in the minimal basis set of functions @xmath5 , @xmath6 , ... ,",
    "@xmath7.@xcite in sec .",
    "iv the method of obtaining such few orbital hamiltonian from a full orbital one is briefly described .",
    "having this hamiltonian one can diagonalize it to obtain its eigenvalues @xmath8 , @xmath9 , ... ,",
    "@xmath10 and eigenvectors @xmath11 , @xmath12 , ... , @xmath13 which are in general linear combinations of the initial wave functions : @xmath14 for wannier function construction ( see sec .",
    "iv ) and in the choice of the basis set wave functions @xmath5 , @xmath6 , ... , @xmath7 in any downfolding or projection procedure . using different basis sets few",
    "orbital non - interacting hamiltonian can be constructed in different ways .",
    "all of them are equally good if the resulting hamiltonian gives the same bands as the lda full orbital one .",
    "it is essentially important for low symmetry systems , where it is not clear what kind of linear combinations of @xmath15wave functions and in which local coordinate system ( lcs ) should be taken as a basis set for few orbital hamiltonian construction .",
    "in addition there is one more serious and general problem .",
    "lda calculations are widely known to give good description of the _ ground state _ characteristics .",
    "however , it often fails to describe the excited states .",
    "lda eigenvalues should not be treated as the real excitation energies .",
    "this general shortcoming concerns all methods of calculating cfs which use lda eigenvalues .    on the other hand",
    ", care should be taken in what we actually mean by cfs . in direct study of cf excitations",
    "e.g. by optics one should take into account possible relaxation of both the electronic ( fast process ) and lattice ( relatively slow relaxation ) subsystems .",
    "fast electronic relaxation definitely has to be taken into consideration , whereas the lattice relaxation can be often treated separately ( direct optical absorptions usually occur at a frozen lattice , according to the frank - condon principle ) .    in this paper",
    "we propose _ the direct method _ of calculation of cf excitation energy in the framework of the lda+u approximation which allows for such relaxation of electron system and enables to avoid ambiguity in the choice of basis set ( as in projection or downfolding procedure ) as well .",
    "cf excitations are calculated as difference between the ground state energy and the total energy of an excited state in which the electron is `` artificially '' put to one of the higher - lying @xmath15levels .",
    "these states - the ground state and the excited state with the electron constrained in the higher level - are both treated in the self - consisted lda+u scheme .",
    "this allows us to obtain the values of cf excitation energy which , in particular , take into account fast relaxation of the electronic system .",
    "below we develop this general method and test it on the example of y and la titanates .",
    "we compare our results with the previously obtained ones.@xcite the physics of these compounds is discussed on the basis of calculated values of cf excitation energy , as well as the other results of _ ab initio _ lda and lda+u calculations .",
    "unusual and very rich physics of titanates attracts much attention since the possibility of existence of an orbital liquid has been proposed for latio@xmath16.@xcite in the ground state both latio@xmath16 and ytio@xmath16 crystallize in perovskite structure .",
    "the lattice distortions due to different ionic radii of y and la ions seems to lead to the cardinal changes in electronic and magnetic properties of these compounds .    at low temperatures latio@xmath16",
    "was found to be g - type antiferromagnet with n@xmath17el temperature for stoichiometric samples t@xmath18=146  k  @xcite while ytio@xmath16 is an isotropic ferromagnet with relatively low t@xmath1930  k.@xcite local magnetic moment on ti@xmath20 ion in ytio@xmath16 was found to be 0.84  @xmath21.@xcite the ordered moment in latio@xmath16 amounts to 0.46 - 0.58  @xmath21  @xcite and strongly differs from 1  @xmath21 expected for @xmath22 configuration with quenched orbital moment .",
    "another interesting feature is nearly isotropic magnon spectra with small spin gap observed both in latio@xmath16 and ytio@xmath16 despite of the intrinsic orthorhombic distortion.@xcite    in order to describe these puzzling properties the exciting idea of the orbital liquid has been proposed.@xcite according to this theory the large degeneracy of @xmath2 shell can lead to the orbitally - disordered ground state .",
    "the crucial point in this case is the value of energy required for electron excitation from one @xmath2 orbital to another : orbital liquid can exist only if this energy is zero or very small .",
    "however , as the real symmetry of latio@xmath16 and ytio@xmath16 is not cubic but orthorhombic , one should expect certain splitting of @xmath2-levels .",
    "first calculations of the cfs in latio@xmath16 was performed by r. schmitz and e. mller - hartmann.@xcite using realistic crystal structure@xcite they carried out model calculations taking into account point - charge and covalency contributions and obtained that the lowest singlet is separated from two higher - lying almost degenerate levels by about 0.24 ev .",
    "similar calculations were also performed by mochizuki and imada.@xcite they stressed the importance of the gdfeo@xmath16-type distortion and found the value of cfs to be @xmath23  ev , where @xmath24 is an effective dielectric constant .",
    "this constant is hard to evaluate in model calculations in a reliable way because of local screening effects in a solid , which could be explicitly taken into account only in _ ab initio _ band structure calculations .",
    "the _ ab initio _ calculations were done by pavarini _ et al._@xcite and solovyev.@xcite they used the diagonalization of few orbital on - site effective lda hamiltonian in real space to obtain cfs .",
    "solovyev has performed an exact procedure of full - orbital hamiltonian transformation to the small energy - dependent hamiltonian .",
    "after that the energy         was fixed in the center of the @xmath2 band.@xcite pavarini _",
    "et al._@xcite have used formalism of nth - order muffin - tin orbitals ( nmtos ) to define small hamiltonian.@xcite despite the similarity of the methods , the results are qualitatively different .",
    "the cfs between lowest and next @xmath2 level obtained in ref .",
    "is rather small , @xmath430 - 50  mev for both compounds , which would not prevent an orbital liquid formation .",
    "the results of calculations presented in ref .   are incompatible with this scenario : obtained values of cfs are @xmath4 150 - 200  mev for both compounds , similar to the results of model calculations.@xcite",
    "discrepancy between the results of previous _ ab initio _ cfs calculations  @xcite is probably caused by ( i ) choice of mt spheres radii in lmto method  @xcite or ( ii ) the details of different projection procedures . to resolve first problem",
    "we have carried out the conventional lda calculations using lmto method and verified its band structure by performing the full - potential calculations in the framework of linearized augmented plane waves ( fp - lapw ) method realized on wien2k program code.@xcite we chose fp - lapw because it is known to be the most accurate method for band structure calculations .",
    "crystallographic data for latio@xmath16 ( t=8  k ) and ytio@xmath16 ( t=293  k ) were taken from ref .  .",
    "the radii of the muffin - tin ( mt ) spheres for lmto calculations were chosen to be r@xmath25=3.28  a.u .",
    ", r@xmath26=2.52  a.u . ,",
    "and for both oxygens r@xmath27=1.92  a.u .",
    "remaining unit cell volume was filled by empty spheres ( atomic spheres with zero nuclear charge ) with different mt radii .",
    "ionic radius of y is known to be smaller than la one.@xcite according to this fact the mt radius of y was also taken to be smaller : r@xmath28=3.01  a.u .",

    "almost empty la-@xmath41 states were treated as pseudo - core , since la-@xmath41 states are localized and do not strongly contribute to the relevant electronic states . due to rather large values of the on - site coulomb interaction @xmath42 ( of the order of 10  ev ) la-4f states",
    "will be located approximately at 5 - 10  ev above the fermi level.@xcite    the brillouin - zone ( bz ) integration in the course of the self - consistent iterations was performed over a mesh of 27 * k*-points in the irreducible part of the bz .",
    "density of states ( dos ) were calculated by the tetrahedron method with 512 * k*-points in the whole bz .",
    "the band structure obtained within the lda approximation in the framework of lmto ( with the mt radii chosen above ) and fp - lapw methods for latio@xmath16 is presented in fig .",
    "[ bands ] .",
    "twelve ti@xmath43 ( four ti per unit cell ) bands are placed in the vicinity of the fermi level and have band width @xmath44 ev both in fp - lapw and lmto methods .",
    "the energy gap between the top of the @xmath2 and the bottom of @xmath3 bands is estimated to be 0.25  ev in fp - lapw and 0.18  ev in lmto . comparing this figure and fig .  2 of ref .",
    "one can see that the present lmto bands agree better in all high - symmetry points of bz with fp - lapw ones than those presented in ref .  .",
    "so being firmly convinced of the correctness of lmto band structure one could carry out the cfs calculations .",
    "one of the ways to calculate cfs is to use the minimal basis set hamiltonian for the orbitals of interest in real space . to construct such hamiltonian we used wannier functions projection procedure . in this section we present brief description of the method . for more details , see ref .  .",
    "for an lda hamiltonian @xmath45 one has a hilbert space of eigenfunctions ( bloch states @xmath46 ) with the basis set @xmath47 defined by the particular method ( for lmto these are lmt - orbitals,@xcite for lapw - augmented plane waves,@xcite etc . ) . in this basis",
    "set the hamiltonian operator is defined as : @xmath48 where greek indices are used for full - orbital matrices .",
    "if we consider a certain subset of the hamiltonian eigenfunctions , for example bloch states of partially filled bands @xmath49 , then we can define a corresponding subspace in the total hilbert space .",
    "the hamiltonian matrix is diagonal in the bloch states basis , however , physically more appealing is a basis which would have a form of site - centered atomic orbitals . that is a set of wannier functions @xmath50 defined as a fourier transformation of certain linear combination of bloch functions belonging to this subspace ( see eq .",
    "( [ wf_psi_def ] ) bellow ) .",
    "they are labeled in real space according to the band @xmath51 and the lattice vector of the unit cell * t * which they belong to .",
    "the hamiltonian operator @xmath52 defined in this basis set is @xmath53    the total hilbert space can be divided into a direct sum of above introduced subspace ( of partially filled bloch states ) and the subspace formed by all other states orthogonal to it .",
    "those two subspaces are decoupled since they are the eigenfunctions corresponding to different eigenvalues .",
    "the hamiltonian matrix in wannier function basis is block - diagonal , so that the matrix elements between different subspaces in hilbert space are zero .",
    "the block @xmath54 in ( [ ham_genwf ] ) corresponding to the partially filled bands can be considered as a projection of the full hamiltonian operator ( [ ham_gen ] ) to the subspace defined by its wannier functions .",
    "localized wannier functions @xmath55 were defined in ref .   as",
    "fourier transforms of the bloch functions @xmath46 @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the number of discrete @xmath58 points in the first bz .",
    "wannier functions are not uniquely defined because for a certain set of bands any orthogonal linear combination of bloch functions @xmath46 can be used in ( [ wf_psi_def ] ) . in general",
    "it means that the freedom of choice of wannier functions corresponds to freedom of choice of a * k*-depended unitary transformation matrix @xmath59:@xcite @xmath60",
    "the most serious drawback of wannier representation is that there is no rigorous way to define @xmath59 .",
    "as one can see from ( [ wf_psi_def ] ) and ( [ psi_def ] ) , wannier functions can vary significantly in shape and range because variations in @xmath46 or @xmath59 change relative phases and amplitudes of bloch functions at different @xmath58 and bands @xmath61 .    in order to avoid this disadvantage",
    "some additional restrictions on the properties of wannier functions have been proposed.@xcite among others marzari and vanderbildt  @xcite suggested the condition of maximum localization for wannier functions .",
    "that gave the variational procedure to calculate @xmath59 . to get a good initial point the authors suggested to choose a set of trial localized orbitals @xmath62 and projecting them onto the bloch functions @xmath46 .",
    "it was found that this starting guess is usually quite good.@xcite this fact led later to the simplified calculating scheme proposed in @xcite where variational procedure was abandoned and the result of aforementioned projection was considered as a final step .    in order to start projection procedure one needs to determine the set of trial orbitals @xmath62 and the bands which will be used for the wannier functions construction .",
    "the latter can be defined either by the bands numbers ( from @xmath63 to @xmath64 ) or by the energy interval ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "non - orthogonalized wannier functions in real @xmath66 and reciprocal space @xmath67 are then the projection of the set of trial site - centered atomic - like orbitals @xmath62 on the bloch functions @xmath46 of the chosen bands @xmath68    note that the wannier functions in reciprocal space @xmath67 do not coincide with the bloch functions @xmath69 for multi - band case due to the summation over band index @xmath61 in ( [ wf_psi ] ) .",

    "[ splittable ]    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in fact , in the case of spin - polarized calculations ( like lda+u ) there are two occupation matrices for every transition metal ion on each site : spin majority and spin minority occupation matrices . according to the hund s rule , at first",
    "the spin majority states start to be occupied .",
    "nevertheless , due to the large spatial extension and sizable overlap between @xmath3 and oxygen @xmath71 orbitals ( see fig .",
    "[ latio3-d - dos ] ) there are always some non - negligible occupation numbers for @xmath3 states in a real band structure calculation for both spins . in order to avoid the influence of these effects ( they can lead to the `` symmetrization '' of @xmath72-orbitals ) we use for the analysis not the occupation matrix for majority spin ( ti is @xmath22 system in the compounds under consideration ) , but the difference between matrices for two spins . here",
    "we suppose the oxygen influence on @xmath15states for both spins to be equal .",
    "the diagonalization of the difference between occupation matrices for majority and minority spins for latio@xmath16 gives following eigenvalues : 0 , 0 , 0.01 , 0.02 , 0.76 .",
    "the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue defines the occupied orbital as a linear combination of all @xmath15orbitals : @xmath73 thus , in case of latio@xmath16 in the lcs : @xmath74 similar decomposition for ytio@xmath16",
    "is presented in the table iii .",
    "the excitation energy ( from the ground to the first excited state ) in this case is the total energy difference between states where this orbital is occupied and where it is empty and another one is occupied . according to this scheme we performed the calculation where the system is constrained by external potential @xmath75 to change the occupied orbital : @xmath76 in other words @xmath75 just pushes up the orbital where the electron has been localized in lda+u .",
    "it is not important how big is the correction @xmath77 .",
    "one needs just be sure that it is large enough to force the electron to hop to another orbital .",
    "the total energy of excited state does not depend on the value of @xmath77 , because the correction is applied to the orbital which has to be empty in the excited state .",
    "the total energy difference between the ground and first excited states is an estimate of the cf excitation energy .    the results of calculations of cf excitation energies for latio@xmath16 and ytio@xmath16 are presented in the fourth column of tab .",
    "[ splittable ] .",
    "they have the same order of magnitude as those obtained using the wf projection in the present work and downfolding performed by pavarini _",
    "et al._@xcite as has been mentioned above , for proper estimation of cf excitation energy the relaxation of electron system should be taken into consideration .",
    "such relaxation decreases the energy costs of the electron excitation . according to the present results",
    "the gain in energy can amount to @xmath470  mev ( @xmath430% ) .",
    "however , it is obviously insufficient to reduce the value of cfs significantly .",
    "thus , the results of the cfs calculations both using wf projection and constrained lda+u which takes into account the electron system relaxation indicate that the splittings in latio@xmath16 and ytio@xmath16 are relatively large .",
    "they are definitely bigger than the spin - orbital coupling in titanates which is expected to be @xmath78  mev  @xcite .",
    "the latter result is supported by the recent xas measurements , where shown that the orbital momentum in latio@xmath16 is essentially quenched.@xcite    but the most important conclusion is that cf excitation energy obtained in the present work and value of cfs calculated in ref .   as well as",
    "extracted from ti l@xmath79 xas  @xcite and optical measurements  @xcite are all the order of 200 mev , that makes orbital liquid scenario for latio@xmath16 rather unlikely .",

    "contribution of @xmath80 and @xmath81 components to the resulting orbital in latio@xmath16 are nearly the same and by @xmath4  4060 @xmath82 bigger than @xmath83 one .",
    "there is quite different situation in ytio@xmath16 , where @xmath83 contribution is almost zero .",
    "this fact can be explained by means of the analysis of the crystal structure distortions , which are quite different in these compounds .",
    "distortions in @xmath84plane in latio@xmath16 have in general large trigonal @xmath85 component .",
    "it gives rise to square - to - rectangle transformation in this plane  @xcite and results in localization of the electron on the orbital of almost @xmath86 character . at the same time the predominant distortions in ytio@xmath16 make rhombus from the initial square , revealing the sizable contribution of local tetragonal distortions .",
    "however , even in case of latio@xmath16 the occupied orbital deviates from a@xmath87 : @xmath88    the variation of @xmath89 distances in ytio@xmath16  @xcite leads to antiferroorbital ordering ( fig .",

    "<S> in the framework of the lda+u approximation we propose the direct way of calculation of crystal - field excitation energy and apply it to la and y titanates . the method developed can be useful for comparison with the results of spectroscopic measurements because it takes into account fast relaxations of electronic system . for titanates </S>",
    "<S> these relaxation processes reduce the value of crystal - field splitting by @xmath0 as compared with the difference of lda one electron energies </S>",
    "<S> . however , the crystal - field excitation energy in these systems is still large enough to make an orbital liquid formation rather unlikely and experimentally observed isotropic magnetism remains unexplained . </S>"
