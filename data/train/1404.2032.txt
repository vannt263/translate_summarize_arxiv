    "green , hartmann , marcos and solberg constructed a minimal projective bimodule resolution for any koszul algebra by using sets @xmath27 @xmath28 introduced by green , solberg and zacharia in @xcite . moreover , by using this method , minimal projective bimodule resolutions of several weakly symmetric algebras are constructed in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . in this paper , by the same method , we give a minimal projective bimodule resolution of @xmath0 for @xmath21 and compute the hochschild cohomology group @xmath29 of @xmath0 for @xmath12 in the case where @xmath22 .    in @xcite , snashall and solberg have defined the support varieties of finitely generated modules over a finite - dimensional algebra by using the hochschild cohomology ring modulo nilpotence , which are analogous to the support varieties for group algebras of finite groups .",

    "in particular , it is shown that @xmath30 is finitely generated as an algebra for @xmath22 ( see theorem 4.1 ) .    throughout this paper , for all arrows @xmath32 of @xmath3 , we denote the origin of @xmath32 by @xmath33 and the terminus of @xmath32 by @xmath34 . also , we denote the enveloping algebra @xmath35 of @xmath36 by @xmath37 .",
