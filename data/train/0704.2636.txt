    "the aim of this paper is to explore the notion that we can relate the magnetic field estimates in these two regions by suitably extrapolating disk magnetic fields to the blazar emission zone .",
    "we then examine the conditions under which the extrapolated and estimated fields agree . some of the physical issues which we examine include those related to poynting flux dominated jets , the accuracy of specific one - zone inverse compton models for blazar emission and the accuracy of estimates of the magnetic field strengths in the accretion disk near the black hole .",
    "the very existence of a jet or wind in a black hole ",
    "accretion disk system points to the existence of a magnetic stress additional to the conventional @xmath1 stress identified by @xcite .",
    "( we adopt @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 as conventional cylindrical polar coordinates with @xmath5 being the disk mid - plane . )",
    "@xcite showed that the channelling of accretion power into either coronal heating or an outflow depends upon the existence of a @xmath6 stress @xmath7 over the surface of the disk . in principle",
    ", this stress can be important even when it is numerically small compared to the @xmath8 stress @xmath9 : @xmath10 acts over the surface are a of the disk , whereas @xmath9 acts over the disk height @xmath11 so that if @xmath12 then the dynamical effect of @xmath10 dominates .",
    "let @xmath13 be the disk mass accretion rate and @xmath14 be the approximately keplerian mean azimuthal velocity , then the full equation for angular momentum transport is : @xmath15    = \\tilde v_\\phi r \\frac { d \\dot m_a}{dr } - 4 \\pi r^2 \\langle t_{\\phi z } \\rangle^+\\ ] ] in principle the mass accretion rate can vary with radius @xmath2 if there is substantial mass flux deposited into the wind .",
    "however , if the wind and/or jet from the accretion disk is poynting flux dominated then @xmath16 .",
    "suppose that we further assume that the @xmath10 stress dominates and that the magnetic stresses dominate the kinetic reynolds stresses ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "we then obtain the following estimate for the magnetic term @xmath18 , _ viz .",
    "_ @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the mass accretion rate in units of the eddington value @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the mass of the black hole and @xmath23 is the gravitational radius .",
    "hence we have the following numerical estimate for the strength of the magnetic field : @xmath24 where the mass of the black hole is @xmath25 .",
    "coincidentally , this is the same dependence of magnetic flux density assumed by @xcite in their paper on centrifugally driven winds from accretion disks .",
    "let us assume that the jet is poynting flux dominated and that the base of the jet outflow is confined to radii @xmath26 .",
    "we can determine the jet energy flux @xmath27 by integrating the mean poynting flux @xmath28 over the cross - sectional area of the jet utilising equation  ( [ e : bphibz1 ] ) for @xmath18 .",
    "hence , @xmath29\\ ] ] this equation can thus be used to estimate the mass accretion rate given the jet energy flux . then eliminating @xmath13 from equation  ( [ e : bphibz1 ] )",
    "we have , for the magnetic field as a function of cylindrical radius @xmath30 at the base of the jet : @xmath31^{-1/2 } \\",
    ", \\left ( \\frac { r_0}{r_g } \\right)^{-5/4}\\ ] ]    the determination of the base magnetic field in terms of the jet can be used in conjunction with a blazar emission model ( which gives the jet energy flux ) to determine the magnetic field in the jet extrapolated from the accretion disk .",
    "this is a valid procedure since the jet energy flux is conserved irrespective of entrainment in the region between the disk and the blazar emission region @xcite .",
    "this is important since the particles in the initially poynting dominated jet may be entrained en - route .",
    "in order to connect the magnetic field at the base of the jet to the field further out in the blazar emission region we need to consider the evolution of the field along the poynting flux dominated jet . in order to do this",
    "we consider the equations of relativistic axisymmetric mhd ( see @xcite ) with a newtonian gravitational field .",
    "let @xmath32 be the angular velocity of the jet , @xmath33 its rest mass density , @xmath34 the poloidal velocity , @xmath35 the polodial magnetic field and @xmath36 the lorentz factor .",
    "then we have the following stream line constants : @xmath37 one of the important surfaces in such a flow is the alfven surface where the poloidal gas velocity equals the poloidal alfven speed ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "the alfven surface is also equivalently characterised by @xmath39 and @xmath40 . denoting the values of dynamical variables at the alfven surface by a subscript @xmath41 , the azimuthal magnetic field ( the dominant perpendicular component )",
    "is given by : @xmath42 the asymptotic form of this expression is obtained for @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , giving @xmath46 the value of @xmath47 at the disk surface is obtained assuming that @xmath48 and @xmath49 giving @xmath50 hence , @xmath51 the other streamline parameter that we require is the ratio of azimuthal to vertical field at the disk surface .",
    "the first step is to evaluate the streamline constant @xmath52 assuming that @xmath53 is at most of order @xmath54 and that the initial poloidal velocity is much less than the keplerian velocity ( @xmath55 ) we have @xmath56 then , dividing equation  ( [ e : r0b0 ] ) by @xmath57 and using @xmath58 gives @xmath59 in both equations  ( [ e : r0b0 ] ) and ( [ e : rbphi0 ] ) we have the similar terms @xmath60 and @xmath61 which we can treat approximately as follows",
    ". let the equation of a poloidal stream line by @xmath62 .",
    "the continuity equation tells us that @xmath63 if we assume that over a jet cross - section the density and vertical velocity are constant , _ i.e. _ @xmath64 and @xmath65 , then @xmath66 thus along any poloidal streamline , @xmath67 .",
    "consequently @xmath68 furthermore , we assume that by the time the flow has reached the alfven surface it is already relativistic although possibly not with a high lorentz factor .",
    "hence , we assume that @xmath69 . also , in the asymptotic regime where @xmath70 , @xmath71 to an even better approximation .",
    "therefore , in the asymptotic region @xmath72 the ratio of the azimuthal and vertical components of magnetic field in the disk is : @xmath73 given this estimate of the ratio of toroidal to vertical field components at the base of the jet we can use the estimate for @xmath74 on the accretion disk surface to determine the asymptotic azimuthal field using equation  ( [ e : rbphi_final ] ) .",
    "the result is : @xmath75^{-1/2 } \\ , \\left ( \\frac { r_0}{r_g } \\right)^{-1/2}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 refers to the value of @xmath2 at the base of the streamline .",
    "in order to compare this estimate of magnetic field with the one - zone models which invoke a single magnetic field strength we define an area weighted flux density @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the radius of the jet in the blazar emission region . in order to carry out",
    "this integral one needs to integrate@xmath78 with respect to the streamline radius @xmath2 across the jet in the blazar region ; this in turn requires that we know the relationship between the streamline radius and the radius at the base of the streamline , i.e. @xmath79 .",
    "we make the simplifying assumption that the expansion is linear .",
    "this should not be a great source of error since the integrand only depends weakly on @xmath30 . with this assumption and with @xmath80 as the ratio of inner to outer jet radii : @xmath81^{1/2 } \\label{e : bphi_lab}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the function @xmath82 varies by a factor of 2 from its mean value @xmath83 for @xmath84 so that the precise value of @xmath85 is unimportant .",
    "however , for illustration we consider two different values in the following .    the magnetic field estimate in equation  ( [ e : b_lab ] )",
    "represents the magnetic field in the laboratory frame . for comparison with blazar estimates the magnetic field in the plasma rest frame is obtained by dividing this estimate by the lorentz factor @xmath36 .",
    "our aim is to compare the estimate of the magnetic field using the above theory with the values derived from inverse compton models of blazar high energy emission .",
    "inverse compton emission results from the scattering of `` soft '' photons by high energy electrons and one may distinguish three qualitatively different models for blazar emission :    1 .   _ exernal inverse compton ( eic ) _ models in which the soft photons originate from outside the region of high energy electrons .",
    "_ synchroton self compton ( ssc ) _ models in which the soft photons are produced by the same population of high energy electrons which scatter them .",
    "3 .   _ local inverse compton ( lic ) _ models in which the soft photons originate from a region which is adjacent to the region of high energy electrons .",
    "however , the regions may be physically related .",
    "for example , one can envisage a region of jet containing embedded shocks .",
    "the high energy electrons would then be in a sub - volume of a larger volume which is the source of soft photons .    in the literature",
    "the distnction between lic emission and eic emission is not usually made .",
    "however , we think that the distinction is useful in view of the close spatial and physical relationship that may exist between the source of soft photons and the scattering region . examples of lic emission models include the decelerating flow models proposed by @xcite and the ` blob in jet ' model of @xcite .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     table  [ t : blazars ] summarises the comparison of blazar and extrapolated accretion disk estimates for three blazars .",
    "different groups have independently estimated blazar parameters using different models ( ssc and lic ) for mkn  501 . in the comparisons",
    "we have used two different values of @xmath86 ; however , as indicated earlier this does not make great deal of difference to the extrapolated magnetic field estimates .",
    "we have also indicated which of the models are ssc and which are lic ; the last column of the table indicates the ratio of the extrapolated magnetic field to the magnetic field estimated from the particular blazar model .",
    "one of the obvious conclusions from table  [ t : blazars ] is that the ssc models do not fare very well in estimating the magnetic field in the blazar region . on the other hand",
    "the two lic estimates of magnetic flux density agree well with the extrapolated magnetic field .",
    "whilst such an agreement is welcome it is not especially surprising .",
    "the estimate of the magnetic field in equation  ( [ e : bphi_lab ] ) is based on a poynting flux dominated jet which remains so in the asymptotic regime ",
    "consistent with the original non - relativistic solution of @xcite .",
    "it is well known that pure ssc models yield low magnetic energy densities and high particle energy densities that are incompatible with an important poynting flux .",
    "the lic models on the other hand effectively reduce the particle energy density and increase the magnetic energy density as a consequence of the larger flux of soft photons .",
    "the lic models therefore imply comparable values of magnetic flux density and energy density , which are more compatible with a substantial component of poynting flux .",
    "hence , the agreement with the extrapolated field is not surprising . in order to provide a more stringent test of the extrapolation technique developed here",
    "it is desirable to have an independent estimate of the accretion rate ( rather than one based on the energy flux ) which can be used to estimate the base magnetic field ( using equation  ( [ e : bphibz2 ] ) ) independently of the energy flux .",
    "this could be provided , for example , by the x - ray and/or optical luminosity associated with the accretion disk .    on the other hand ,",
    "the reasonable comparison between extrapolated and estimated magnetic fields bodes well for a continuation of this approach in which several of the simplifying assumptions can be relaxed . in particular the gravitational field of the black hole",
    "can be incorporated into a fully general relativistic treatment , a small mass flux can be incorporated and the consistent development of the model for the flow near the black hole may also be included .                  , : decelerating flows in tev blazars : a resolution to the bl lacertae - fr i unification problem . in : miller , h.r . , marshall , k. , webb , j.r . , aller , m.f .",
