    "weak gravitational field of a spatially compact source is identified as a perturbation about a background space - time which is a solution of the einstein equation in the source free region . in the presence of a positive cosmological constant ,",
    "the background space - time is the de sitter space - time . unlike the minkowski background for the zero cosmological constant",
    ", de sitter space - time has different patches eg the global patch , a poincare patch and a static patch . in the cosmological context ,",
    "a poincare patch is appropriate which is what we focus on . a solution at the _ linearized level _ , valid throughout the poincare patch and extending to the future null infinity @xmath2 , is available in @xcite .",
    "however the space - like character of the @xmath0 poses challenges for defining energy , momentum and their fluxes .",
    "let us recall that the cleanest articulation of ` infinity ' arises in the conformal completion of physical space - times .",
    "conformal completion preserves the light cone structure of the physical space - time and captures the notion of approaching infinity along many directions as well as with different speeds .",
    "it naturally identifies boundary components , @xmath3 where time - like and null geodesics ` terminate ' .",
    "the causal nature of these boundary components is determined by the asymptotic form of ` source - free ' equations : @xmath4 are null when @xmath5 and space - like for @xmath6 ( time - like for @xmath7 ) .",
    "these boundary components serve to define out - going ( in - coming ) fields as those solutions of the asymptotic equations that have suitably finite limiting values on @xmath8 .",
    "it is then a result that the weyl tensor of out - going fields evaluated along out - going null geodesics , has a definite pattern of fall - off in inverse powers of an affine parameter along the geodesics ( the peeling - off theorem ) @xcite .",
    "this enables one to identify the leading term as representing gravitational radiation ( far field of a source ) , in a coordinate invariant manner .",
    "it is conveniently described in terms of the weyl scalars which are defined with respect to a suitable null tetrad .",
    "when @xmath2 is null , a null tetrad at a point @xmath9 is uniquely determined ( modulo real scaling and rotation ) by the tangent vector @xmath10 of an outgoing null geodesic reaching @xmath11 , _ and _ the null normal , say @xmath12 at @xmath11 normalized so that with @xmath13 .",
    "clearly as the null geodesic changes its direction , @xmath14 changes but not @xmath15 and hence the weyl scalar @xmath16 remains unchanged .",
    "its non - zero value can be taken as showing the presence of gravitational radiation .",
    "this feature is lost when the @xmath2 is space - like .",
    "now the null vector @xmath12 , with @xmath13 , is chosen to be in the plane defined by @xmath10 and the ( time - like ) normal @xmath17 . clearly , as @xmath10 changes , so does @xmath12 and then _ no _ weyl scalar is invariant .",
    "an invariant characterization of gravitational radiation is no longer available @xcite .    to test",
    "if a notion of radiation based on asymptotic behaviour is physically useful , one still needs suitable definitions of flux of energy - momentum , angular momentum in terms of the fields which will then correlate physical quantities being radiated away from a spatially compact source .",
    "fortunately , in the poincare patch , there are seven globally defined killing vectors , all space - like in the vicinity of @xmath0 , and corresponding conserved quantities can be expected .",
    "one of the definition of such conserved quantities is based on the covariant phase space framework @xcite . in the context of the linearised theory",
    ", it exploits the phase space structure of the space of solutions and defines a manifestly gauge invariant and conserved ` hamiltonian ' corresponding to every _ isometry _ of the background space - time .",
    "although defined on each space - like hypersurface of the poincare patch , the simplest expressions results for evaluation at @xmath2 .",
    "being defined as an integral over a hypersurface , it is also referred to as a _",
    "flux_.    thus we see that the null infinity provides a characterization of the radiation ( up to origin dependence for @xmath18 ) which can transport energy - momentum - angular momentum away from a spatially compact gravitating source .",
    "one other implication of this characterization at infinity is that the energy / momentum / angular momentum which _ is _ received at the future null infinity is _ necessarily lost _ from the source under the assumption of _ no incoming radiation _ boundary condition .",
    "it is this last implication that follows also for the cosmological horizon of a spatially compact source : energy / momentum / angular momentum that crosses the cosmological horizon is also lost forever from the source .",
    "note that the worldlines of different components of a spatially extended ( but compact ) source must reach the same point on @xmath0 to maintain a _",
    "finite _ physical separation among them .",
    "it follows that that the cosmological horizon for a spatially compact source is well defined : it is the past light cone of the common point on @xmath0 where the source world tube converges . equally well , _ any observer _ who remains at a finite physical distance from the compact source for all times , must necessarily lie within the cosmological horizon i.e. within the static patch .",
    "we would like to explore to what extent and under what conditions may we regard the cosmological horizon as a `` substitute '' for the _ future null infinity_.    it is obvious at the outset that the out - going null geodesics emanating from the source intersect the cosmological horizon at a _ finite _ value of any affine parameter and it can be chosen to be 1 by a suitable normalization .",
    "such a normalized affine parameter equals the ratio of the physical distance from the source to @xmath19 .",
    "all spatially compact sources may be taken to be within a sphere of radius @xmath20 .",
    "furthermore , only sources varying over cosmological time scales , will have comparable wavelengths .",
    "in other words , most sources producing gravitational waves would have wavelengths far smaller than @xmath21 and any wave crossing the horizon may be taken to be a ` far zone field ' .",
    "cosmological horizon being a null hypersurface , we do have the weyl scalar @xmath22 defined on it , which is independent of the _ direction _ of null geodesics meeting the horizon .    for sources which are sufficiently rapidly varying ( relative to the scale set by the cosmological constant )",
    ", there is an alternative identification of gravitational waves as _",
    "ripples on a background _ within the so called _ short wave approximation _ @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is possible to define an _ effective gravitational stress tensor _ , @xmath23 for the ripples . for vanishing @xmath24 ,",
    "it is gauge invariant , conserved and symmetric . for non - zero @xmath24",
    "it is _ not _ gauge invariant but the gauge violations are suppressed by powers of @xmath25 .",
    "it is very convenient to have such a stress tensor to define and compute fluxes of energy and momenta carried by the ripples across any hypersurface .",
    "we will use this to show that for the retarded solution given in @xcite , the flux of energy - momentum across the cosmological horizon exactly equals the corresponding flux across the @xmath0 and also equals the flux computed in @xcite . like - wise ,",
    "the instantaneous power received at infinity matches with that crossing the horizon .",
    "this is our main result .",
    "the paper is organised as follow .    in section [ solution ] , we recall the solution at the linearised level for which the fluxes will be evaluated .",
    "section [ energy ] is divided into five subsections . in subsection [ covariant ]",
    "we summarise the covariant phase space framework and in subsection [ effectivestresstensor ] , we discuss the isaacson prescription adapted to the presence of the cosmological constant . since this constructs a symmetric , conserved and gauge invariant ( to _ leading order _ ) stress tensor , we get conserved currents for each killing vector of the background space - time . in the subsection [ fluxcomputations ] , we present computations of the energy flux across various hypersurfaces .",
    "in particular we show that the fluxes across the out - going null hypersurfaces are zero , implying for example , that the energy propagation is sharp .",
    "subsection [ momentumfluxes ] contains the fluxes for the momentum and the angular momentum . in the subsection [ cosmologicalhorizon ]",
    ", we discuss its applications and show that the quadrupole power can be computed at the cosmological horizon .",

    "the sharp propagation of energy comes in very useful .",
    "we note two of its implications .",
    "\\(1 ) the flux across two hypersurfaces @xmath362 and @xmath363 _ can not _ be equal , see the right side figure of ( [ fluxfig ] ) .",
    "let @xmath38 .",
    "let @xmath362 meet the @xmath42 line at @xmath364 .",
    "let the out - going null hypersurface through @xmath364 intersect the @xmath363 in a @xmath365 at @xmath366 with the radial coordinate being @xmath367 .",
    "the three hypersurfaces @xmath362 , the out - going null hypersurface and the hypersurface @xmath363 bounded by the sphere at @xmath366 enclose a space - time region , @xmath368 . by the conservation equation , the sum of the fluxes through these bounding hypersurfaces must vanish .",
    "but the flux through the out - going null hypersurface vanishes as shown before .",
    "hence the fluxes through @xmath362 and the partial hypersurface @xmath363 between @xmath366 and @xmath369 , must be equal .",
    "however , this leaves the contribution of the flux through the ` remaining ' portion of the @xmath363 hypersurface between @xmath370 and @xmath366 . hence the result .",
    "alternatively , one can also see this explicitly by writing the full flux through the two hypersurfaces using the expression given in equation and matching the integrands along the out - going null hypersurface . evidently , the full flux through @xmath371 is also not equal to that through @xmath0 .",
    "physically this is understandable since the hypersurface at a later value of @xmath37 receives energy emitted _ after _ the earlier value of @xmath37 .",
    "the null infinity of course records _ all _ the energy emitted by the source and so does the cosmological horizon .",
    "we also conclude that the total flux at @xmath0 computed by ashtekar et al matches with that given in equation for @xmath372 .",
    "note that unlike the spatial slices @xmath100 , all hypersurfaces @xmath373 intercept all the emitted energy .",
    "\\(2 ) the sharp propagation of energy can also be used to infer the _ instantaneous emitted power_. consider two out - going null hypersurfaces intersecting the cosmological horizon in spheres with radii @xmath374 and @xmath375 .",
    "the same hypersurfaces intersect the null infinity at corresponding spheres at @xmath376 and @xmath377 , see the left side figure in ( [ fluxfig ] ) . for @xmath378",
    ", we have @xmath379 and @xmath380 . by the conservation equation and sharp propagation , the flux integral over the portion bounded by the spheres @xmath381 on @xmath0 and the flux integral over the portion bounded by the spheres @xmath232 on the @xmath1 , are equal .",
    "taking @xmath382 , the integral becomes @xmath383 the integral over the sphere at @xmath374 .",
    "the _ emitted power _ is then defined by dividing the flux integral by @xmath384 and taking the limit .",
    "thus we get the instantaneous power as : @xmath385 this matches with the definition given by ashtekar et al @xcite and is manifestly positive . since the power defined at @xmath0 in equation is gauge invariant and that defined at @xmath1 in equation using the effective stress tensor are equal , we conclude that the power computed using the effective stress tensor is gauge invariant .",
    "thus , the quadrupole power can be computed at the cosmological horizon .",
    "we have dealt with two aspects namely the role of the cosmological horizon and the use of effective gravitational stress tensor in the limited context of rapidly changing , distant sources .    as noted in the introduction , the cosmological horizon is unambiguously defined for a spatially compact source .",
    "this follows because worldlines with finite physical separation at every @xmath37 must converge to @xmath386 , the point @xmath387 of figure ( [ desitterpenrose ] ) . if @xmath357 denotes the physical radial distance corresponding to the radial coordinate difference @xmath388 , then @xmath389 . to maintain @xmath390 to be finite as @xmath44 , we must have @xmath391 near @xmath386 .",
    "this identifies @xmath388 with @xmath392 or @xmath393 .",
    "thus , the worldlines approach @xmath386 along the @xmath394constant hypersurfaces .",
    "the cosmological horizon is then the past lightcone of @xmath386 .",
    "the same argument also shows that any observer , who remains at finite physical distance away from the source must remain confined within the cosmological horizon .",
    "furthermore , neither any such observer , nor the source has any access to energy / momentum which has crossed the horizon .",

    "incidentally , any future directed causal curve reaching @xmath0 also registers on @xmath1 .",
    "further support for the role of cosmological horizon as future null infinity comes from the computations of the energy momentum fluxes . for these , we employed the effective gravitational stress tensor and showed that the fluxes defined at @xmath0 by more geometric methods , also matched with those computed at the horizon .",
    "in particular the quadrupole power can be evaluated at the horizon .",
    "the effective gravitational stress tensor , although limited to short wavelength regimes ( which covers most common sources ) , provides a convenient picture of energy momentum flows much like those for matter .",
    "there is a shortcoming of the effective stress tensor - it does not capture the angular momentum flux correctly .",
    "a clearer understanding of this failure is lacking at present .",
    "it should be noted that definition of fluxes is not necessarily _",
    "unique_. apart from a definition being well defined , its ` correctness ' should be tested in conjunction with the definition of the bondi - type quantities having a loss formula relating to flux .",
