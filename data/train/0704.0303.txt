    "the pierre auger observatory in malarge , argentina , is designed to study the origin of ultra - high energy cosmic rays with energies above @xmath0ev . while still under construction , scientific data taking began in 2004 , and first results have been published  @xcite .",
    "the pierre auger observatory is a hybrid detector that combines two techniques traditionally used to measure cosmic ray air showers : surface particle detection and air fluorescence detection .",
    "both detector types measure the cosmic ray primary indirectly , using the earth s atmosphere as part of the detector medium .",
    "when the primary particle enters the atmosphere , it interacts with air molecules , initiating a cascade of secondary particles , the so - called extensive air shower . surface detectors in the form of ground arrays sample the shower front as it impacts the ground , whereas air fluorescence detectors make use of the fact that the particles in the air shower excite nitrogen molecules in the air , causing uv fluorescence . using photomultiplier cameras to record air shower uv emission",
    ", we can observe showers as they develop through the atmosphere and obtain a nearly calorimetric estimate of the shower energy .    upon completion , the surface detector ( sd ) array of the pierre auger observatory will comprise 1600 water cherenkov detector tanks , deployed in a hexagonal grid over an area of @xmath1 , and four fluorescence detector ( fd ) stations overlooking the sd from the periphery .",
    "an advantage of combining both detector types at the same site is the possibility to cross - calibrate .",
    "based on the subset of events seen with both detectors , the nearly calorimetric information of the fd provides the energy calibration of the sd .    for the calibration to be meaningful , the properties of the calorimeter , _",
    "i.e. _ the atmosphere , must be well - known . at the pierre auger observatory , this is achieved by an extensive program to monitor the atmosphere within the overall fd aperture and measure atmospheric attenuation and scattering properties in the 300 to 400  nm wavelength band recorded by the fds  @xcite .",
    "two primary forms of atmospheric light scattering need to be considered : molecular , or rayleigh , scattering , mainly due to nitrogen and oxygen molecules ; and aerosol scattering due to airborne particulates .",
    "the angular distribution of scattered light in both types of scattering may be described by a phase function @xmath2 , defined as the probability per unit solid angle of scattering through an angle @xmath3 .",
    "rayleigh scattering allows for an analytical treatment , and assuming isotropic scattering , the rayleigh phase function has the well known @xmath4 angular dependence .",
    "matters are more complicated for aerosols , because the scattering cross section depends on the size distribution and shape of the scatterers .",
    "forward scattering typically dominates in this case , but the fraction of forward - scattered light varies strongly with aerosol type .",
    "moreover , a rigorous analytical treatment is not possible , though the literature gives various approximations .",
    "for example , if one assumes spherical particles with a known or estimated size distribution , then aerosol scattering can be described analytically using mie theory  @xcite . in practice , however , aerosols vary a great deal in size and shape , and the aerosol content of the atmosphere changes on short time scales as wind lifts up dust , weather fronts pass through , or rain removes dust from the atmosphere",
    ".    the fd reconstruction of the primary cosmic ray particle energy must account not only for light that is `` lost '' between the shower and the camera due to scattering , but also for direct and indirect cherenkov light contributing to the fd signal .",
    "the amount of cherenkov light seen by the fds depends on the viewing angle , _",
    "i.e. _ the angle between the shower axis and the fd line of sight , and can be calculated once the geometry of the air shower is determined . at small viewing angles , direct cherenkov light dominates , while at viewing angles greater than @xmath5 , the fds detect mainly `` indirect '' cherenkov light scattered into the fd field of view . to calculate this scattered component",
    ", the aerosol phase function needs to be known .",
    "finally , a small multiple scattering component also adds to the contamination of the fluorescence light and must be removed  @xcite .",
    "the aerosol phase function ( apf ) light sources  @xcite , in conjunction with the fluorescence detectors at the pierre auger observatory , are designed to measure the aerosol phase function on an hourly basis during fd data taking .",
    "the apf light sources direct a near - horizontal pulsed light beam across the field of view of a nearby fd .",
    "the aerosol phase function can then be reconstructed from the intensity of the light observed by the fd cameras as a function of scattering angle .",
    "since the fd telescopes cover about @xmath6 in azimuth , the aerosol phase function is measured over a wide range of scattering angles .",
    "currently , apf light sources are installed and operating at two of the fds . with their ability to measure the _ angular distribution _ of the scattered light ,",
    "the apf light sources are meant to complement other atmospheric monitoring tools at the auger site which measure the optical depth , and therefore the _ amount _ of attenuation due to aerosols .",
    "this paper describes the design and performance of the apf light sources .",
    "it is structured as follows .",
    "section 2 gives a description of the apf facilities .",
    "section 3 describes how the aerosol phase function is determined from the apf data . in section 4 ,",
    "we show first results for data taken between june and december 2006 .",
    "section 5 summarizes the paper .",
    "the auger fd comprises four detector stations ( see fig.[auger_scheme ] ) . at present , the sites at los leones , coihueco , and los morados are completed and fully operational , while the fourth site at loma amarilla is under construction .",
    "apf light sources are operating at the coihueco and los morados fd sites .",
    "both were built by the university of new mexico group  @xcite .",
    "fig.[apf_photo ] shows a photograph of the apf container building at los morados .",
    "each apf building contains sources which operate at different wavelengths in the region of interest between 300  nm and 400  nm . during the initial studies described in this paper ,",
    "only one light source with a johnson u - band filter of central wavelength 350  nm was used . however , in the near future , we plan to operate the light sources at several wavelengths to study the wavelength dependence of the phase function over the full range of the fd sensitivity .",
    "the light beam is provided by a broad - band xenon flash lamp source from perkin elmer optoelectronics ( model ls-1130 - 4 flashpac with fx-1160 flash lamp ) .",

    "all optical components are assembled on a commercial optical plate .",
    "we use thor optical table parts , assembled from nomex epoxy / fiberglass 1.91  cm panels from teklam ( part number n507ec ) .",
    "the xenon lamps rest inside refurbished 6.1  m shipping containers , and the light is sent through a 0.749  cm thick acrylite uv transmitting window ( cyro industries acrylite op-4 uvt acrylic ) .",
    "each light source provides a nearly horizontal beam of divergence @xmath8 pulsed across the field of view of the nearby fluorescence detector .",
    "computer control occurs from the corresponding fd building .",
    "a serial radio link ( ydi wireless , model 651 - 900001 - 001 ( tranzpoint esc - ii kit ) ) connects the computer to a commercial adc / relay system ( model adc-16f 16 channel 8 bit adc and rh-8l 8-relay card from electronic energy control inc . ) at the light source .    once during each hour of fd data taking , the adc / relay system enables a 1  hz gps pulser ( cns systems inc .",

    "each lamp fires a set of 5 shots , pulsed at 2 second intervals .",
    "the apf events are flagged by the fd data acquisition system and the corresponding fd data are stored on disk in especially designated apf data files .",
    "when the light sources are not operating , only the radio link and the adc board are powered .",
    "the total current draw is therefore only @xmath9 at 12  v , and the whole system can be powered by batteries recharged during the day with 12  v solar panels ( two siemens sp75 75  w solar modules with trace c35 controller ) .",
    "the light beam produced by the apf sources is observed by the cameras of the corresponding fd site .",
    "the fd detectors of the pierre auger observatory are described in detail elsewhere  @xcite . here , we only give a short summary of the main characteristics relevant for the analysis of apf shots .",
    "each auger fd site contains six bays , and each bay encloses a uv telescope composed of a spherical light - collecting mirror , a photomultiplier camera at the focal surface , and a uv transmitting filter in the aperture .",
    "the mirrors have a radius of curvature of 3.4  m and an area of about @xmath10 .",
    "the camera consists of 440 photomultipliers with a hexagonal bialkaline photocathode , arranged in a @xmath11 array .",
    "each camera has a field of view of @xmath12 in azimuth and @xmath13 in elevation , covering an elevation angle range from @xmath14 to @xmath15 above horizon . to reduce optical aberrations , including coma , the fd telescopes use schmidt optics with a circular diaphragm of diameter 2.2  m placed at the center of curvature of the mirror , and a refractive corrector ring at the telescope aperture .",

    "<S> air fluorescence detectors measure the energy of ultra - high energy cosmic rays by collecting fluorescence light emitted from nitrogen molecules along the extensive air shower cascade . to ensure a reliable energy determination , the light signal needs to be corrected for atmospheric effects , which not only attenuate the signal , but also produce a non - negligible background component due to scattered cherenkov light and multiple - scattered light . </S>",
    "<S> the correction requires regular measurements of the aerosol attenuation length and the aerosol phase function , defined as the probability of light scattered in a given direction . at the pierre auger observatory in malarge , argentina , the phase function is measured on an hourly basis using two aerosol phase function ( apf ) light sources . </S>",
    "<S> these sources direct a uv light beam across the field of view of the fluorescence detectors ; the phase function can be extracted from the image of the shots in the fluorescence detector cameras . </S>",
