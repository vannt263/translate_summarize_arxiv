    "the event horizon telescope ( eht ) is a very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) array consisting of radio telescopes around the world . once complete",
    ", it will be capable of achieving a resolution of up to 23 microarcseconds at 230 ghz and 15 microarcseconds at 345 ghz .",
    "this resolution is required , as its name suggests , to resolve black hole structure on event horizon scales .",
    "both the supermassive black hole at the center of the milky way , sagittarius a * , and that of the elliptical galaxy m87 are massive enough and close enough ( subtending tens of microarcseconds ) for the eht to resolve .",
    "sgr a * is predicted to subtend a larger angle on the sky , and with a declination of @xmath0 , it remains permanently visible in the southern hemisphere .",
    "however , radio images of sgr a * are blurred due to interstellar scattering by turbulent electrons @xcite , which is consistent with a thin scattering screen located near the scutum spiral arm @xcite . supergiant elliptical galaxy m87 , known for its striking jet in the optical , provides an alternate source  it has a black hole nearly as large in angular size , and without any indication of strong interstellar scattering at 7 mm ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "initial eht observations have made the first detections of event horizon scale structure using both sources @xcite .",
    "the array capabilities are rapidly improving both in sensitivity and coverage due to increased bandwidth and the inclusion of additional radio telescopes ( e.g. , the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) , * ? ? ? * ) .    here",
    "we assess the potential for future eht observations at various milestones in its development , taking into account the locations and sensitivities of the eht s constituent telescopes .",
    "we attempt to answer a variety of observational questions .",
    "can the eht detect signatures of strong field general relativity ?",
    "how well can we constrain models for black hole images ? should we preferentially observe sgr a * or m87 ?",
    "what are the tradeoffs between observing at 345 ghz versus 230 ghz ?",
    "we perform a set of experiments using geometric and theoretical models for black hole images (  [ sec : modeling ] ) and our simulated arrays (  [ sec : arrays ] ) .",
    "we statistically quantify the performance of each simulated observing run (  [ sec : experiments ] ) , and discuss the implications and limitations of this study (  [ sec : discussion ] ) before summarizing our results (  [ sec : conclusion ] ) .",
    "the sparse uv - coverage of the current eht array prevents imaging ( but see * ? ? ? * for an example of image formation with the future eht array ) .",
    "maximizing the science return on the data or simulating future observations requires fitting models in the fourier domain .",
    "both geometric shapes and physical emission models have been used to interpret the observations . the mm emission from sgr",
    "a * and m87 is thought to be synchrotron radiation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , either from a radiatively inefficient accretion flow @xcite or a jet @xcite . recently , there has been considerable interest in making predictions for the observed event horizon scale structure , both using semi - analytic ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* e.g. , ) and mhd ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) accretion flow and jet models .",
    "thus far both geometric and physical models can produce satisfactory fits ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but physically - motivated ones are statistically favored @xcite . in this work , we use both physical models from numerical simulations of the innermost regions of accretion flows and jets and a parameterized geometric description of their resulting `` crescent '' images .        [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "this work presents a concrete demonstration of the potential of the eht to do transformative science within the framework of plausible observing parameters and models for the source structure in sgr a * and m87 . however , there are a number of limitations to the methods used here .",
    "the arrays we consider ( table [ table : arrays ] ) correspond roughly to the technical roadmap of the eht experiment , but are necessarily approximations of the true evolution of its technological capabilities in time .",
    "future array developments which we have not considered in our analysis include the addition of the 12 m greenland telescope ( glt , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which will provide long baselines for m87 observations , and the addition of lmt functionality at 345 ghz , which will help constrain large - scale structure at this frequency .    simulating future observations",
    "requires assuming models for each source .",
    "we have made plausible choices based on best fit images from state of the art simulations , and a model - independent geometric crescent approximation aiming to capture the important relativistic effects .",
    "both choices are first steps .",
    "the former models are subject to systematic uncertainties in the microphysics and initial conditions of the simulations , which should be explored in the future .",
    "the geometric crescent model is physically motivated and has more parameters ( 5 ) than asymmetric gaussian ( 4 ) or ring ( 3 ) shapes , but is still too simplistic to reproduce the theoretical images in any detail . in addition , while we consider an azimuthally symmetric photon ring contribution for simplicity this feature is also asymmetric in theoretical models due to doppler beaming . analytic extensions including additional parameters @xcite are a promising means to extend these models to quantitatively fit future eht data sets .",
    "we have also separately carried out static and time - variable tests .",
    "the most effective method for detecting a photon ring may depend on its stationarity relative to the variable emitting region .    while beyond the scope of this paper , the eht array will also be able to measure spatially resolved dual polarizations , which will provide independent constraints on the structure of magnetic fields and geometry of the emitting region .",
    "advantages of polarimetric interferometry include the immunity of fractional polarization to scatter - broadening , thereby circumventing electron turbulence in line of sight to sgr a * , and the ability to reach greater astrometric precision than the size scales probed by an array s baselines .",
    "recent work by @xcite demonstrates the promise of polarimetric interferometry for achieving precise relative astrometry of a variable polarized image compact .",
    "similar to previous work @xcite , we find that coherently averaged closure phases are a powerful observable for eht science .",
    "closure phase can now be measured , and increasing their sensitivity is an important future goal for the observations . even with current capabilities , we predict that structural variability should be detectable with additional data .",
    "the amplitude and type of variability observed will provide a powerful constraint on accretion models , possibly including the direct detection of magnetic turbulence in a black hole accretion flow .",
    "here we only consider the detectability of a schwarzschild photon ring . in principle , the characterization of the photon ring , particularly its shape and phase offset from the rest of the image , could allow a measurement of black hole spin @xcite and a test of the no - hair theorem @xcite .",
    "this can be explored with simulated eht data in future work , either using static models as we have done here or by match filtering the expected feature in time - dependent simulated data .",
    "the models we consider assume general relativity .",
    "if the kerr geometry is modified , it becomes difficult to disentangle signatures of modified gravity from different accretion flow geometries .",
    "a computationally - expensive , full parameter space search is required , as recently explored by @xcite .    despite these caveats , the techniques that we develop in this paper",
    "do not depend on the underlying models .",
    "as new simulation models or analytic parameterizations are introduced , they can be used while applying the same methodology .",
    "with both geometric crescents and hydrodynamical accretion models , we have devised and simulated a variety of tests that can be used on current and future eht data and assessed the array s capabilities during its stages of development .",
    "the main results of this paper are summarized as follows .    *",
    "the photon ring , a signature of kerr strong gravity , may be detected by the event horizon telescope once alma and lmt have joined the array ( complete ) for its predicted brightness of @xmath1 of the total flux ( section [ sec : photon_ring ] and figure [ fig : ring_detection ] ) . *",
    "the use of closure phase information greatly increases the constraining power of the eht . due to the ability to coherently average closure phase information over time periods much longer than atmospheric coherence time , the increase in precision gained through measuring closure phases more than makes up for the lack of full phase information .",
    "* the eht should be able to discriminate between many best - fit theoretical models from numerical simulations even with additional data from the current array , provided that closure phases can be robustly measured with high precision ( section [ sec : sim_fits ] ) .",
    "model constraints will become far stricter still in the next few years as bandwidth is increased and stations are added to the array ( e.g. , lmt and alma ) .",
    "eht observations can therefore provide a stringent test of contemporary accretion theory and a precise measurement of black hole and accretion flow parameters .",
    "* eht closure phases are also currently sensitive to structural variability at the level present in the models ( section [ sec : time_variability ] ) .",
    "current data may therefore allow the first detection of structural variability on event horizon scales around a black hole .",
    "time - domain eht measurements provide could allow the direct study of instabilities in accretion flows both on the scales of the entire image and its fine structure , e.g. as may result from mhd turbulence driven by the mri ( right panel of figure [ fig : todayandcomplete ] ) .",
    "* the assumed underlying image model can significantly impact the results achievable by the eht . using",
    "the full complement of two sources ( sgr a * and m87 ) and frequencies ( 230 and 345 ghz ) can mitigate possible degeneracies between the accretion flow or jet image and the photon ring ( e.g. , the difference between the results for 230 ghz m87 or 345 ghz sgr a * and 230 ghz sgr a * in figure [ fig : ring_detection ] ) . using m87 and 345 ghz are particularly important to avoid the strong interstellar scattering towards sgr a * , which can still limit the science capabilities of observations at 230 ghz .",
    "we thank s. doeleman and e. quataert for useful discussions .",
