    "the origin of the structure observed in quark and lepton masses and mixing angles remains one of the most pressing and interesting questions left unanswered by the standard model .",
    "the continuing improvement in the measurement of the ckm and mns matrix elements and the neutrino masses has stimulated a renewed theoretical effort to answer these questions .    in the case of quarks",
    "one proposed structure going beyond the standard model has proved to be robust , giving a quantitatively accurate prediction for the cabbibo angle ( strictly @xmath1 ) .",
    "it follows from the postulate that the up and down quark mass matrices have a simultaneous texture  zero in the @xmath2 position and that the magnitude of the matrix elements are symmetric for the first two generations@xcite .",
    "the measured masses and mixing angles are consistent with additional texture zerosramond:1993kv , although this may require a departure from the symmetric form of the mass matrices@xcite .",
    "one reason for the interest in texture zeros is that they may indicate the presence of a new family symmetry which require certain matrix elements be anomalously small .",
    "thus identification of texture zeros may be an important step in unravelling the origin of the fermion masses and mixings .    in this paper",
    "we extend the analysis of possible texture zeros to the lepton sector for the case that neutrino masses are given by the see - saw mechanism@xcite .",
    "in analogy with the quark case we consider the predictions resulting from a symmetric form for the magnitudes of the dirac mass matrix elements together with texture zeros .",
    "of particular interest is the case of simultaneous zeros in the @xmath2 position .",
    "if this proves to be the case it would be a strong indication of a symmetry between the up and the down quarks and the charged lepton and neutrino sectors respectively .",
    "for the case that the majorana mass matrix does not contribute significantly to lepton mixing we obtain predictions for the chooz mixing angle and for the cp  violating phases .",
    "if the neutrino majorana mass does contribute significantly to mixing these predictions may be viewed as indicative to the magnitude of these parameters barring what would seem to be an unnatural cancellation between the contribution of the dirac and majorana sectors .",
    "we also consider the implications further restrictions on the form of the lepton mass matrices .",
    "the analysis is done in the context that the mass of one of the majorana neutrinos is anomalously large @xcite .",
    "this case includes the possibilities that there is sequential right hand neutrino dominance@xcite that offers an attractive way of explaining near bi - maximal neutrino mixing in the case that the quark and neutrino dirac mass matrices are related@xcite,@xcite .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section [ param ]",
    "we review a general parameterisation for the effective light neutrino masses for the case of the see - saw mechanism that is useful in studying the implications of texture zeros .",
    "we discuss the constraints on this parameterisation coming from texture zeros , from a symmetric form of the magnitudes of the mass matrix elements and from the case that one of the majorana neutrinos is anomalously large . in section [ results ]",
    "we apply this parameterisation to derive general constraints on neutrino mixing and cp  violation and consider the implications for leptogenesis .",
    "section [ summary ] summarizes the results .",
    "we consider the case of three generations of left - handed @xmath3 doublet neutrinos , @xmath4 and three generations of right - handed standard model singlet neutrinos , @xmath5 .",
    "the lagrangian responsible for lepton masses has the form@xmath6where @xmath7 @xmath8 are the matrices of yukawa couplings which give rise to the neutrino and charged lepton dirac mass matrices respectively and @xmath9 is the neutrino majorana mass matrix .",
    "we are interested in studying the implications of simultaneous zeros in @xmath10 and @xmath8 for observable quantities , masses and mixing angles and cp  violating phases .",
    "for the case of quarks and charged leptons it is easy to do this because the yukawa couplings are directly related to the mass matrices . for neutrinos",
    ", however , the existence of the majorana masses complicates the connection between the dirac yukawa couplings and the neutrino observables .",
    "the light neutrino mass matrix , @xmath11 is given by the see - saw form@xmath12sometimes it is convenient to use an alternative form for the see - saw formula , expressing @xmath13 in terms of the neutrino mass eigenvalues , mixing angles and cp  violation@xcite .",
    "in the basis in which the majorana mass matrix , @xmath14 is diagonal the parameterisation has the form@xmath15where @xmath16 is the diagonal matrix of the square roots of the eigenvalues of @xmath9 , @xmath17 is the diagonal matrix of the roots of the physical masses , @xmath18 of the light neutrinos , @xmath19 is the neutrino mixing matrix , and @xmath20 is an orthogonal matrix which parameterises the residual freedom in @xmath13 once the other parameters are fixed .",
    "it is parameterised by 3 complex mixingangles .",
    "@xmath21    where @xmath22 @xmath23 @xmath24 are arbitrary complex angles . these , together with the three majorana masses , the three light neutrino masses , the three mixing angles and three phases of @xmath19 make up the eighteen real parameters needed to specify @xmath25 with this form it is straightforward to study the implications of a zero in @xmath13 for the physical measureables .    in our study of texture zeros we will be interested in simultaneous texture zeros in @xmath13 and @xmath8 .",
    "of course this is basis dependent as a zero in one basis will not in general remain zero after a rotation . in this sense",
    "the appearance of simultaneous texture zeros specifies the texture zero  basis .",
    "the idea is that there is some dynamical reason , such as a family symmetry , which generates the texture zero structure . for the case of a family symmetry",
    "the texture zero  basis is just the current quark basis , defined as the one in which the fermion states are eigenstates of the family symmetry group . in the phenomenological analysis of texture zeros",
    "this basis choice is taken into account by modifying the parameterisation so that the charged lepton mass matrix is not diagonal . in this case",
    "it is the combination @xmath26 that should be identified with the @xmath27 matrix , where @xmath28 is the unitary matrix needed to diagonalise the charged lepton mass matrix , starting from the texture basis .",
    "it is instructive to determine how many free parameters are left in @xmath20 when @xmath13 is constrained in various ways .",
    "if any element of @xmath10 is zero , there is a reduction of two complex parameters needed to specify @xmath13 and a corresponding reduction of the parameters in @xmath29 for more than @xmath30 texture zeros there will be relations between measureable quantities ; of course it is necessary to discuss the lepton sector to relate @xmath19 to @xmath31 . ] .",
    "however , depending on the position of the texture zero , there may be predictions for fewer texture zeros .    for the case that @xmath13 is symmetric ( or hermitian or has off diagonal elements antisymmetric ) the number of real parameters needed to specify it are reduced to @xmath32 , so in this case @xmath20 is completely determined .",
    "this does not lead to any relations between measurable quantities but if , in addition , there is a texture zero there will be such relations ( this is the analogue to the gst  relation in the quark sector ) .    for the case one of the majorana masses , @xmath33 is anomalously heavy the standard model singlet component , @xmath34does not play a role in determining the two heaviest of the light neutrino eigenstates . following from eq([seesaw ] ) we see that in this case the couplings @xmath35 do not contribute to the light masses and mixing angles .",
    "there is also a reduction in the number of parameters needed to specify @xmath36following from the condition that @xmath37 is finite as @xmath38 we see that in this limit @xmath39 @xmath40 and @xmath41 @xmath42 @xmath43 inserting these constraints in eq([r ] ) we find the form of @xmath20 is given by@xmath44where @xmath45 this @xmath46 refer to a reflection ambiguity .",
    "in practice we can work with the positive sign only and absorb this ambiguity in the unknown phases specified below . the yukawa couplings @xmath47",
    "@xmath48 @xmath49 are thus given in terms of @xmath50 alone in the limit @xmath51 if we require the @xmath52 block be symmetric , antisymmetric or hermitian , @xmath50 will be determined and for @xmath53 texture zero there will be relations between measureables .",
    "alternatively more than @xmath53 texture zero will give relations even if the @xmath52 and @xmath54 matrix elements are not related .",
    "the @xmath27 matrix is given by @xmath26 and has a contribution coming from the matrix @xmath28 which diagonalises the charged lepton mass matrix .",
    "the latter has to  reproduce the hierarchical structure of lepton masses and this may place constraints on the magnitude of the charged lepton mixing angles .",
    "let us consider the case the lepton mass matrix is symmetric and that , like the quarks , the hierarchy of lepton masses is due to an hierarchical structure in the matrix elements and not due to a cancellation between different contributions .",
    "this is what is expected if there is an underlying grand unified symmetry relating leptons to quarks .",
    "moreover a cancellation between different contributions to lepton masses seems very difficult to reconcile with an underlying family symmetry as it requires non - trivial relations between different matrix elements which are difficult to arrange even in the context of non - abelian family symmetry . with this constraint",
    "it is easy to limit @xmath55 because @xmath56 , giving @xmath57similarly one obtains a bound on @xmath58 from the constraint that @xmath59 which follows from taking the deteminant of the mass matrix .",
    "this in turn implies @xmath60with equality occurring if there is a texture zero in the @xmath2 position .",
    "the constraint on @xmath61 also leads to the constraint @xmath62 . if @xmath63 which occurs when there is a texture zero in the @xmath64 position , we have the bound @xmath65 if , however , @xmath66 we have @xmath67 and then from the determinant we have @xmath68 which again gives @xmath69 in practice the magnitudes of @xmath70 and @xmath71 are so small that they do not affect the mixing coming from the neutrino sector",
    ". however @xmath58 close to the upper bound given in eq([l1 ] ) does give a significant contribution to the chooz angle .",
    "its effect is considered below .",
    "the discussion above relies on a symmetric structure relating the magnitudes of the charged lepton mass matrix elements .",
    "if we relax this condition there is no constraint on the magnitude of the matrix elements of @xmath72 in this case the contributions to the mns matrix coming from the neutrino sector should be considered as an indication of the lower bound on the @xmath27 matrix elements , assuming there is no delicate cancellation between the contributions of @xmath28 and @xmath73    we turn now to a determination of the relations that follow for various form of the yukawa couplings .",
    "we first consider in detail how the analysis proceeds for the case the texture zero is in the @xmath2 position and both @xmath13 and @xmath75 are symmetric . in the analogous case in the quark sector a @xmath2 texture",
    "zero leads to the remarkably successful gst relation @xcite , so this case is particularly interesting for , if it leads to a phenomenologically realistic prediction , it may indicate a connection betweeen quarks and leptons .",
    "as discussed above we are interested in the case @xmath76and the majorana mass matrix , @xmath9 is diagonal and real .",
    "we include the cp violating phases in @xmath77 i.e.we write it in the form@xmath78where @xmath79 and @xmath80 are the cp violating phases and @xmath81 has the form of the ckm matrix . in this case a symmetric structure in the dirac neutrino mass matrices and a texture zero will lead to a relation between measurable parameters .",
    "following from eq([ci ] ) the condition @xmath82",
    "gives@xmath83where @xmath19 is the matrix acting on the left - handed neutrino states needed to diagonalise the dirac neutrino mass matrix . to express this in terms of @xmath84 we use the constraints of eqs([l1],[l2],[l3 ] ) to determine @xmath73",
    "there is a residual phase ambiguity because the basis in which the mns matrix has the standard form can be different from the `` symmetry '' basis in which the texture zero appears .",
    "this corresponds to the simultaneous redefininition of the phase of the left- and right- handed states such that the dirac structure is invariant ( the change in the majorana matrix is absorbed in a redefinition of @xmath79 and @xmath85 in eq([majphase ] ) ) . with this",
    "we have @xmath19 @xmath86 where @xmath87    from the symmetric constraint @xmath88 one obtains@xmath89substituting for @xmath90 leads to the relation@xmath91where @xmath92=@xmath93 .",
    "we choose the phases of the right handed charged leptons such that @xmath28 is real in the @xmath52 block .",
    "then in leading order we have @xmath94 except for@xmath95where we have written @xmath96 . in eq([w ] ) we have dropped terms involving the roots of ratios of lepton masses relative to unity . using eq([w ] ) in eq([11 ] ) gives @xmath97for the case of a @xmath2 texture zero in @xmath98 we have @xmath99 . for the case of a texture zero in @xmath100 , @xmath101 .",
    "other possibilities for a lepton texture zero or no texture zero at all give @xmath102    the implications of eq([1tz ] ) for the chooz angle are shown in fig(f1 ) for the case @xmath103 and @xmath104 respectively . in these plots",
    "we have chosen a random distribution of the unknown phases @xmath105 one may see there is a clustering of values within a small range with the chooz angle near the current bound , @xmath106 at @xmath107 this implies that , barring an unnatural cancellation between terms , we expect a large chooz angle , in the range that would make the long baseline neutrino factory searches for cp  violation feasible . to quantify this we have determined the range of the chooz angle which includes 95% of the points , giving @xmath108 over the whole range of @xmath109    in fig([f2 ] ) we plot the distribution for the cp violating phase combination @xmath110 .",
    "this is the cp  violating phase relevant to neutrinoless double beta decay .",
    "we see that @xmath111 clusters near its maximal value . in this case",
    "the 95% cutoff implies @xmath112    finally we determine the implications of our results for thermal leptogenesis , assuming that the lightest majorana state dominatesbuchmuller:2003gz . in this case",
    "the asymmetry is given by @xmath113since @xmath114 @xmath115 we have@xmath116    note that @xmath117 depends only on @xmath90 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath90 on low energy phases may be read from eq([tanz ] ) showing which combination is relevant for leptogenesis .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath118 is plotted in fig([f3 ] ) .",
    "note that , if we ignore the charged lepton contribution coming from a nontrivial @xmath119 , a @xmath2 texture zero with an hierarchical majorana mass spectrum gives the same value for the cp violating phase in double beta decay as the cp  violating phase determining the lepton asymmetry in leptogenesis @xcite .",
    "this explains the correlation seen between the plots of figs([f3 ] ) , although note that in figs([f3]b ) a significant charged lepton contribution has been added .    whether this asymmetry can lead to the observed baryon asymmetry depends on the subsequent washout .",
    "this is characterised by the parameter @xmath120 @xcite@xmath43 it is given by @xmath121for the case of a ( 1,1 ) texture zero the value of @xmath122 is given in fig([f4 ] ) .",
    "in the whole region of parameter space @xmath123 and so the washout will reduce the baryon asymmetry below the observed value unless @xmath124 is very large chankowski:2003rr . in the case of sugra",
    "this implies a reheat temperature above the gravitino abundance bound implying that in this case thermal leptogenesis can not work .",
    "however in other supersymmetry breaking mediation scenarios , such as gauge mediation , the gravitino is much lighter and a heavier @xmath124 is consistent with the gravitino bound .",
    "it is straightforward to apply the analysis just discussed to the other possible positions for a single texture zero in the dirac neutrino matrix .",
    "the results are presented in table [ table1 ] .",
    "note that , unlike the case for a @xmath2 texture zero , the prediction for @xmath90 is in terms of the measured large @xmath27 matrix elements . as a result one obtains a definite prediction for leptogenesis which is also given in the table .",
    "for the case of @xmath52 and @xmath125 texture zeros we see that @xmath90 is suppressed by @xmath126 which leads to a near maximal form for @xmath127 the bound on @xmath128 is only mildly stronger than the absolute bound @xmath129 , so the washout effects are expected to be less efficient than in the @xmath2 texture zero case . for the case of the @xmath64 and @xmath130 texture zeros @xmath90",
    "is enhanced by @xmath131 which leads to a @xmath132 suppression in @xmath133 the bound on @xmath134 in this case is comparable to the one for a @xmath2 texture zero but is independent of @xmath109 as a result baryogenesis through thermal leptogenesis will not proceed in these cases either .",
    "for the case of the @xmath52 texture zero the prediction for the chooz angle depends only on unknown phases with the distribution is shown in fig([f5 ] ) .",
    "for a ( 1,3 ) texture zero the chooz angle also depends on the ratio @xmath135 as in the previous cases .",
    "this is plotted in fig([f6 ] ) . in both cases",
    "@xmath136 is predicted to be large , although the @xmath137 lower range is smaller than that found for the @xmath2 texture zero case .    for the case of the @xmath64 and @xmath130 texture zeros one obtains a relation between the large elements of the mns matrix .",
    "from this one may extract a relation between the phases and a prediction for @xmath109 unfortunately these do not lead to a relation between measureable parameters , although the constraint that @xmath138 may be of interest in model building .",
    ".the constraints following from a symmetric mass matrix and a single texture zero .",
    "@xmath139 is 1 for a ( 1,1 ) texture zero in the charged lepton sector and 0 for a ( 1,2 ) texture zero .",
    "if there is no lepton texture zero @xmath139 lies between these limiting cases .",
    "@xmath140 is @xmath141.[table1 ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "the combination of the see - saw mechanism , an hierarchical structure for the majorana mass matrix and a combination of texture zeros and/or a symmetrical form for the moduli of the mass matrix elements leads to relations amongst observable properties of neutrinos . in this paper",
    "we have determined these predictions in a model independent way .",
    "the case of a @xmath2 texture zero is of particular interest because , in the quark sector , it leads to a relation in excellent agreement with experiment . in the neutrino case the equivalent @xmath2 texture zero leads to a prediction for the chooz angle that is close to the present limit and a near",
    "maximal cp  violating phase relevant to thermal leptogenesis and to @xmath142 for the @xmath2 texture zero , thermal leptogenesis can not give rise to acceptable baryogenesis while satisfying the gravitino bounds on the reheat temperature .",
    "therefore , an acceptable range of baryogenesis is only possible if the gravitino constraints are relaxed , for example in theories in which the supersymmetry breaking occurs at a lower scale . in the case",
    "that the texture zero appears in the @xmath52 or @xmath125 positions the chooz angle is still predicted to be large , encouraging for long baseline cp  violation studies .",
    "furthermore , in these cases washout effects after thermal leptogenesis are not too efficient and could allow for adequate baryogenesis .",
    "the case of @xmath64 and @xmath130 texture zeros does not lead to phenomenologically interesting relations .",
    "however there are five viable cases in which two texture zeros can be present . in these cases a large chooz angle is again predicted .",
    "the determination of the parameters involved in the see - saw  mechanism is an illdefined problem due to the large number of parameters relative to measureables .",
    "the best hope is that the system has a high degree of symmetry , reducing the number of parameters .",
    "our analysis has explored a particularly promising possibility suggested by the structure observed in the quark sector in which the dirac masses have one ( or more ) texture zero(s ) and the magnitude of the mass matrix elements may be symmetric .",
    "in addition we have assumed an hierarchical structure for the majorana matrix , motivated by the fact this can readily explain the large neutrino mixing angles while having a relation between quark and lepton dirac masses .",
    "such a structure for the dirac and majorana masses can be derived from an underlying family symmetry@xcite and , if the resultant predictions for neutrino properties should be confirmed , it would provide strong support for such an underlying symmetry organising the fermion mass matrices .",
