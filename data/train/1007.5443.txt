    "the start of the lhc has greatly motivated detailed phenomenological studies of scenarios which involve physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) . among them",
    "d - brane constructions in string theory are one of the most promising framework in which the sm can be embedded and extended . such brane constructions naturally lead to extra anomalous @xmath0 s in the four dimensional low energy theory and , in turn , to the presence of possible heavy @xmath1 particles in the spectrum",
    ". these particles should be among the early findings of lhc and besides for the above cited models they are also a prediction of many other theoretical models of the unification of forces ( see @xcite for a recent review ) . in",
    "@xcite we have considered a minimal extension of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) with a single extra @xmath2 gauge symmetry in a string - inspired setup .",
    "we believe that our model encodes the key features of the low - energy sector of some of those brane construction . in this framework we studied in  @xcite the radiative decay of the next to lightest supersymmetric particle ( nlsp ) into the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) .",
    "this kind of process is very interesting since it might be the first one where the lsp could be observed at lhc  @xcite and at the upcoming ilc  @xcite .",
    "under suitable assumptions the lsp in our model turns out to be an axino  @xcite , the fermion component of the stckelberg supermultiplet related to the anomaly cancellation mechanism ( see for details  @xcite ) . without loss of generality",
    "we assume a wino - like nlsp . in the following we",
    "just give the interaction term which involve the axino and the wino relevant for our analysis .",
    "the interaction term , written in terms of four components majorana spinors are in the weyl representation .",
    "] , is given by & & i = _ w |_2 _ 5 [ ^,^](_a _ ) _ s where @xmath3 is the neutral wino , @xmath4 is the axino , @xmath5 is the photon , @xmath6 the weinberg angle , @xmath7 and @xmath8 respectively the @xmath2 and @xmath9 coupling constants , @xmath10 the @xmath11 anomaly factor and @xmath12 the @xmath13 mass .",
    "the rate of the radiative decay ( @xmath14 ) is _",
    "^(2 ) = g_2 ^ 4 ^2_w @xmath15 ^ 2 [ gamma ] where @xmath16 , while @xmath17 and @xmath18 are respectively the wino and axino masses . as we showed in @xcite ,",
    "the radiative decay is the most dominant wino decay mode with a br close to 1 ( @xmath19 ) , so we can use ( [ gamma ] ) to give an estimation of the wino mean life time _ _ 2 [ meanlife ]",
    "in order to fall into the wmap range in the most experimentally attractive situation , we considered a light lsp ( @xmath20 ) and a mass gap of order @xmath21 , which imply more energetic and therefore easier to detect photons .",
    "this requirement is necessary because the detector resolution increases with energy , while at low energy there is an obstruction for the detection of photons due to bremsstrahlung , qcd background and absorption before the detection from the calorimeter @xcite .",
    "+ moreover we considered a universal squark mass @xmath22 for the first two squark generations ( since under this assumption they are nearly degenerate ) and we assumed flavor blindness  @xcite .",
    "the contribution from the third generation squarks is always negligible .     and the universal squark mass @xmath22 . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : winoprod ] we summarize the results obtained in  @xcite by plotting the number of directly produced winos as a function of @xmath18 and @xmath23 having assumed 14 tev of center of mass energy and 100 fb@xmath24 of integrated luminosity .",
    "since the br is almost close to one this is also the number of photons in the final state .",
    "the number of photons produced is of the order of @xmath25 . in our analysis",
    "we follow  @xcite,@xcite-@xcite , where the nlsp decay in the gmsb framework is controlled by the parameter @xmath26 .",
    "if the nlsp lifetime is not too long ( @xmath27 ) photons originate close to the primary interaction vertex ( `` prompt photons '' ) . in the case of large @xmath26 and",
    "therefore long lived neutralinos the resulting photons are non - pointing . from now on we fix the axino mass @xmath28 gev and the universal squark mass @xmath29 tev . in our framework the role of @xmath26 is played by the ratio @xmath30 . in the following we discuss two different cases : short lived nlsp and long lived one .",
    "we compare the number of photons produced by radiative decay with the ones produced by the cascade decays of all the other supersymmetric processes .",
    "we slightly modified the herwig code 6.5  @xcite in order to take into account the new axino state in the neutral sector .",
    "it should be stressed that herwig does not implement extra @xmath13 in a supersymmetric framework .",
    "this in turn implies that the total number of photons can be underestimated due to the lack of sparticles interactions with the @xmath13 .",
    "however this problem can be overcome by assuming a decoupled @xmath13 either because it is very heavy or because it is extra - weak coupled .",
    "we generated by herwig 2-partons@xmath31 2-sparticles events , using about 1 @xmath32 of integrated luminosity but we have not considered the case of sm particles produced directly in the parton - parton interaction .",
    "a good discriminant variable of the process is the @xmath33 of the photons produced by radiative decay , in particular in the region of @xmath33 between 30 - 80 gev / c . the corresponding distribution is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pta3 ] .",
    "we denote in red the number of @xmath34 s radiatively produced from the decay of the wino , in blue the number of @xmath34 s from all the other processes while in black the sum of the two .",
    "we assumed @xmath35 , which is obtainable with @xmath36 tev and @xmath37 .",
    "distribution of photons ( in log scale ) for @xmath38 susy events .",
    "]    we performed the same cut on the number of generated photons as in  @xcite with @xmath39 gev and with pseudorapidity @xmath40 , @xmath41 , which provides a good way to further suppress the susy background . the result obtained by using herwig in generating @xmath42 net events",
    "is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : num_phot_comp_before ] .        the most important difference between our case and the gmsb1 sample",
    "@xcite is in the number of events with zero or two photons in the final state .",
    "the latter in particular is only 30 in our case .",
    "this behavior can be related to the squark masses we have considered . in our case",
    "they are about 3.5 tev , while in the gmsb1 they are lower than 1 tev ( @xmath43 900 gev ) .",
    "we choose the value of 3.5 tev for the squark masses since in this case the number of directly produced winos essentially depends only on @xmath18 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : winoprod ] ) .",
    "the number of produced squarks is low since they have a high mass .",
    "hence they give a lower contribution to the nlsp production .",
    "if we consider lighter squarks , with masses less than 1 tev , there is an increasing in the number of events with 2 photons in the final state . in any case",
    "the channel with one photon in the final state is always the dominant one .",
    "+ the key point in the analysis is the sm background discrimination .",
    "we considered the same sm background as in  @xcite : events with qcd jets , single gauge bosons ( w and z ) production , di - boson , @xmath44 and @xmath45 production . in order to disentangle the sm background from the signal we require a standard preselection cut for susy - like signatures :    *",
    "at least four jets must be present with @xmath46 gev ( @xmath47 gev for the leading jet ) ; * missing transverse energy @xmath48 gev .",
    "after having applied these preselection cut we are able to reconstruct photons with @xmath49 gev and @xmath40 , @xmath41 .",
    "the jet - finder algorithm used in our analysis is the durham - type clustering ktclus @xcite .",
    "the cut on the @xmath50 requires some care . in hadron colliders , the initial momentum of the colliding partons along the beam axis",
    "is not known since the energy of each hadron is distributed and constantly exchanged between the partons .",
    "hence the total amount of missing energy can not be determined in a straightforward way .",
    "however the initial energy of particles travelling transverse to the beam axis is zero and thus any net momentum in the transverse direction denotes missing transverse energy . to determine the latter for the i - th not - detected particle in each generated event",
    ", we considered the following procedure : take a transverse direction ( perpendicular to the z axis ) and define the vector @xmath51 whose direction is given by its momentum . then @xmath52 ^ 2+[(e^{miss}_{t})^{tot}_y]^2}$ ] where @xmath53 and analogously for the @xmath54 component . the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : smbackground ] . in this plot",
    "the number of photons from the nlsp decay is that generated by herwig while the number of background photons is the reconstructed one  @xcite .",
    "we note that in the channels with @xmath55 the signal can be easily disentangled by the sm background .",
    "is the distance traveled by @xmath56 before its radiative decay .",
    "@xmath57 is the value of the displaced vertex . ]    in the case in which the wino is a long lived particle the reconstruction of the emitted photon after its decaying plays an important role .",
    "if the nlsp has a significant decay length , a photon will not  point back \" to the primary interaction point ( @xmath58 in fig .",
    "[ fig : nopoint ] ) but towards a kind of `` virtual '' point @xmath59 .",
    "the relevant discriminant variable is @xmath57 , the distance between @xmath58 and @xmath60 . using simple trigonometric relations we have : z _ = d_z - d_xywith @xmath61 , the ratio between the photon momentum along the beam direction ( z - axis ) and the transverse momentum .    by fitting the vertex resolution along z as a function of the photon energy for @xmath62 ( see plot in section  electrons and photons \" in  @xcite ) we derive the functional dependence of the standard deviation @xmath63 for the gaussian distribution associated to @xmath57 on the energy in gev of all the photons as 0.7 + [ eq : sigma ] to each @xmath57 we can associate a random number sampled from a gaussian distribution centered on that specific value of @xmath57 and with @xmath63 given by the relation in ( [ eq : sigma ] ) .",
    "we considered a wino mean life time @xmath64 s , so that the distance travelled by this particle before its radiative decay is always within the atlas tracker radius ( @xmath43 115 cm ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : displaced ] we show the results of the analysis for photons of @xmath65 gev and with @xmath66 ( photons with great angle to the beam direction , because these are more easily detected than the ones along the z direction ) , for an integrated luminosity of 10 @xmath32 . by considering the value of their energy and the contribution of the tail of the associated gaussian distribution",
    ", we observe a consequent enlargement of the distribution of @xmath34 s not coming from @xmath3 , which otherwise would be a spike centered on the origin of the x - axis in fig .",
    "[ fig : displaced ] .",
    "the red line stands for photons produced by radiative wino decay , while the black one from the others susy processes .",
    "we can see that in the region @xmath67 cm the photons from the radiative decay are well distinguished from the background ones .",
    "since we have assumed @xmath68 , @xmath69 gev and @xmath64 s , we get from ( [ meanlife ] ) [ ultima ] to satisfy ( [ ultima ] ) we need either a super - heavy @xmath13 ( @xmath70 tev if @xmath71 ) or an extra - weakly coupled ( @xmath72 if @xmath36 tev ) one .",
    "this decoupling makes our simulation more consistent since in it we have neglected the @xmath13 contribution .",
    "cases of extra - weak @xmath13 were already studied in the past @xcite .     for photons of @xmath65 gev and @xmath73",
    ": the red line stands for photons produced by wino decay , the black one for photons from the other susy processes . ]",
    "the most important result we get is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : displaced ] which gives a distinctive behavior of the photons coming from our model with respect to those coming from other susy processes .",
    "the distribution of @xmath57 is centered in zero while the half - width is a function of the nlsp decay length @xmath74 .",
    "this means that the radiative produced photons are preferably emitted along the nlsp direction or more generally at very small angle .",
    "thus the signal can be disentangled from the background by applying a suitable cut in a region @xmath75 cm .",
    "our result can be compared with  @xcite in which the nlsp is a long lived wino - like particle in the particular gauge mediated model dubbed gmsb3 .",
    "the main difference is in the mass gap . in our model",
    "we considered a mass gap of @xmath76 and an lsp of 124 gev , while in the gmsb3 case the mass gap is much higher : the gravitino ( the lsp ) is almost massless ( @xmath77 gev ) and the nlsp has a mass @xmath78 gev . in this case",
    "the energy distribution for the photons produced by the nlsp decay is peaked on the value of the nlsp mass @xmath79 gev while in our case the peak is around @xmath80 gev .",
    "moreover in the gmsb3 @xmath81 m and so the nlsp long lived particles tend to escape the detector before their decay .",
    "this implies a sizable reduction in the number of photons detected .",
