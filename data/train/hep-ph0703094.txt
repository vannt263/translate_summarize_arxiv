    "there are a lot of very convincing experimental data for neutrino oscillations and non - zero masses , @xcite .",
    "the smallness of neutrino masses @xcite is generally understood as a consequence of some see - saw mechanism .",
    "this brings the question of the possibility of new heavy neutrino states .",
    "so far none of these new states was experimentally observed @xcite with masses up to @xmath0 gev . for higher masses",
    "there are many suggestions of experimental possibilities in the next high energy hadron - hadron colliders @xcite , in electron - positron linear accelerators @xcite and in neutrinoless double - beta decay @xcite .",
    "the properties of these new heavy states are the central point in many of the theoretical models proposed as extensions of the present standard model of elementary particle physics .",
    "heavy majorana neutrinos naturally generate b - l asymmetries and are good candidates for leptogenesis @xcite .",
    "besides the masses and mixing angle values , an important point is the majorana or dirac nature of new heavy neutral states .",
    "this is directly connected with lepton number conservation and the general symmetries of any extended model .",
    "the authors already investigated some points in this direction for a single heavy majorana production in hadron - hadron colliders @xcite .",
    "it was shown that this mechanism could be more important than pair production and that like - sign dileptons can give a clear signature for this process . in the present paper",
    "we consider more general possibilities for a heavy neutral lepton production at hadronic colliders .",
    "if a new heavy neutral lepton is experimentally found , then a fundamental question to be answered will be its theoretical origin - singlet ( vsm ) @xcite , doublet ( vdm ) @xcite , mirror ( fmfm ) @xcite and other extensions .",
    "the main point of our work is to present a study of signatures and distributions that could , in principle , show the fundamental properties of possible new heavy neutral leptons at the lhc energies . during the first years , the lhc collaborations will concentrate theirs efforts on new phenomena analyzing channels with low multiplicity and the simplest sm extensions .",
    "since we presently have no signal for new additional gauge bosons , we will make the hypothesis that the dominant interactions of the new heavy neutrino states are given by the standard @xmath1 gauge bosons .",
    "we can resume the new particle interactions in the neutral and charged current lagrangians :    @xmath2    and    @xmath3    where @xmath4 stand for the usual fermions and the heavy majorana neutrino ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "these models have only two parameters : the new majorana neutrino mass and a mixing angle , if we consider all the mixing angles with the same value .    the general fermion mixing terms are given in @xcite as well as the experimental bounds on the mixing angles ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "for the purpose of the present investigation we resume these mixing angles in table 1 .",
    "the @xmath7 vertex is of pure @xmath8 type for the vsm , pure @xmath9 type for the vdm and pure vector @xmath10 or pure axial @xmath11 for the fmfm .",
    "the study of the bounds on the mixing angles can be addressed in several ways .",
    "a general consequence of fermion mixing is that the standard model couplings of gauge bosons and fermions is to be multiplied by a factor of the form @xmath12 .",
    "the universality of the different families coupling to the gauge bosons then imply a global upper bound on mixing angles that must all be very small , regardless of the studied model . the present value , with @xmath13 c.l .",
    ", for the upper bound on the mixing angle @xmath14 , is @xmath15 , when considering them all equal .",
    "a detailed analysis of these calculations can be found in @xcite .",
    "another kind of analysis on mixing angles can be done for the experimental discovery potential at the lhc . in this case , besides the mixing angles one must add to the analysis at least one new unknown parameter - the heavy neutrino mass .",
    "this kind of approach was recently presented in reference @xcite for the @xmath8 case .",
    "the possibility of new gauge interactions can add more unknown parameters to the analysis .",
    "the other @xmath16 cases can be studied in a similar form . in this paper",
    "all the mixing angles have been considered to be equal to the upper bound of the global approach .",
    "this study is organized as follows : in section ii we present the total cross - sections for pair and single production for different models of heavy majorana neutrinos at the proton - proton collisions at lhc energies , and the various distributions that were studied trying to distinguish models , as well as the characteristics and number of events of the chosen processes . in section iii",
    ", we discuss the statistical treatment used to disentangle models and determine the theoretical origin of a heavy majorana neutrino , if experimentally found .",
    "finally , we present our conclusions .",
    "[ eins ]    [ cols=\"^,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "this work suggests that the process @xmath17 is an adequate , relatively simple and clear channel to look for a heavy majorana neutrino and also to study its origin at hadronic colliders , since it violates leptonic number conservation rule and has , _ a priori _ , no background from the standard model . for an annual luminosity of @xmath18",
    "fb@xmath19 this channel allows an investigation of the existence of a majorana neutrino up to a mass of @xmath20 gev .",
    "furthermore , we showed that , once experimentally found , the theoretical origin of the majorana neutrino can be determined using the rapidity distribution of the final electron with the lowest @xmath21 , provided there are enough data .",
    "although the differences among the rapidity distributions for the several models studied are not so great , we showed that a model separation could be achieved using a special statistical treatment , until a mass of the order of @xmath22 gev for @xmath23  fb@xmath19 of data , at the parton level .",
    "the use of the lowest @xmath21 electron rapidity distribution enhances the difference among the models , total cross sections and thus allows model discrimination until higher majorana masses .",
    "a treatment , considering the hadronic jets resulting from the @xmath24 disintegration , could lead to model separation for higher heavy neutrino majorana masses .",
    "the lhc experimental groups can do a more realistic treatment doing full detector simulation . due to the few number of parameters involved in the models studied here and the clear non - sm channel , we believe this kind of experimental analysis can be done soon with data from the first `` runs '' .",
