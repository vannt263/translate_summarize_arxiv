    "<S> at low energies the particle - hole ( @xmath0 ) part of the pionic susceptibility in isospin - symmetric nuclear matter is known to behave very differently from the susceptibility in finite nuclei due to the presence of an energy gap in the @xmath0 excitation spectrum . in this note </S>",

    "<S> for finite nuclei , @xmath3 is often calculated in a local - density approximation using results from the homogenous medium . in this case the particle - hole ( @xmath0 ) contribution , which is dominant at low energies , is described by the lindhard function . however , when applied to finite nuclei , this approximation is justified only if the energy @xmath4 is much larger than the lowest - lying @xmath0 excitation energy . </S>",
    "<S> the modifications due to this energy gap in the excitation spectrum were discussed in ref . </S>",

    "<S> the original lindhard function @xcite can not be used . </S>",
    "<S> instead , it is convenient to split the lindhard function into direct and crossed contributions . </S>",
    "<S> we define @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 indicate neutron ( @xmath8 ) or proton ( @xmath9 ) , @xmath10 and @xmath11 denote the corresponding fermi momenta , and @xmath12 is the nucleon mass . for completeness , the explicit expression for @xmath13 is given in the appendix . using this definition , e.g. , </S>",

    "<S> the susceptibility for a @xmath18 can be obtained by replacing @xmath19 . in realistic cases one has to include corrections from the short - range @xmath20 correlations ( ericson - ericson lorentz - lorenz effect @xcite ) which lead to an rpa resummation of @xmath21 .    in symmetric matter the indices @xmath6 and @xmath7 can be omitted . in this case </S>",

    "<S> it should also be noted that @xmath36 and thus also @xmath37 are complex for @xmath38 .    the previous discussion is valid for infinite matter which is adequate e.g. , for the interior of a neutron star . in view of the strong modifications in the symmetric case due to the energy gap in finite nuclei , it is interesting to include similar corrections also in the asymmetric case . </S>",
