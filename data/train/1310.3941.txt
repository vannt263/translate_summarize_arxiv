    "in the last decades , surface effects in solid state physics have been widely investigated from the applied and fundamental point of view .",
    "an appropriate thermodynamic framework has been developed to describe the interplay between elasticity and surface effects in crystalline solids @xcite .",
    "an essential result is that the concept of surface tension can not be applied without any caution to a solid condensed phase .",
    "this description is usually , however , not considered in the soft matter community , which has focused on problems of adhesion , elasto - capillarity of slender bodies , deformation of an elastomer by a liquid drop , etc . @xcite .",
    "as already pointed out in @xcite a correct treatment of elastocapillarity requires to distinguish between two excess interfacial quantities : the surface energy and the surface stress , cf .",
    "[ fig : intro ] . a thermodynamical approach to derive the relation between surface energy and surface stress yields the well - known shuttleworth - relation @xcite : @xmath0 with @xmath1 the elastic strain parallel to the interface . from this relation",
    "it is immediately clear that for incompressible liquids , and _ only _ for such systems , the surface energy and surface stress are equal and are usually called `` surface tension '' .",
    "the aim of this paper is to adapt this framework previously proposed for crystalline solids , to the case of elastomers and gels : we will extend the concept of surface stress to the case of two soft condensed phases in contact .",
    "specifically , we will propose a microscopic model for these macroscopic excess quantities , in the case of soft elastic amorphous solids , based on the density functional theory in the sharp interface approximation  @xcite .",
    "we will show that the compressibility of the superficial layer , quantified by the poisson ratio @xmath2 , is the key characteristic of elastomers for elasto - capillary effects .",
    "the central result will be that the solid - liquid surface stress @xmath3 relates to the interfacial energies in the following way : @xmath4 if the surface layer is perfectly incompressible , i.e. @xmath5 , this gives a strict equality between surface energy and surface stress : @xmath6 , as for liquid interfaces .",
    "the other extreme limit is that the stress directions perfectly decouple , i.e. @xmath7 , for which @xmath8 .",
    "schematic of a planar interface between a liquid and solid phase .",
    "the surface free energy associated with this interface is @xmath9 . in the case of a solid - liquid interface",
    "this surface free energy is generally _ not _ equal to the surface stress ( force per unit length ) at the interface @xmath10 indicated by the arrows at the dashed control volume . ]    in sect .",
    "[ sect : micmac ] we derive a microscopic model to describe fluid and solid behaviour , which we use to derive @xmath3 in sect .",
    "[ sect : forces ] . the consequence of this result [ eq .",
    "[ eq : upsilon_sl ] ] will be discussed in detail in the discussion of sect .",
    "[ sect : disc ] , where we compare our findings to recent experiments and numerical results .",
    "we wish to define a model to compute the mechanical stresses that arise in the vicinity of a fluid - fluid or fluid - solid interface .",
    "these surface or capillary forces originate from molecular interactions , and predicting their strength thus calls for a description at that scale . before developing this in detail ,",
    "let us first consider the purely macroscopic viewpoint and define a macroscopic ( or thermodynamic ) stress tensor @xmath11 . in the absence of bulk forces ,",
    "the mechanical equilibrium condition is @xmath12 for a planar interface whose normal points along the @xmath13-direction , this implies that the normal stress @xmath14 is constant and is identical in both phases ( assuming homogeneity in the @xmath15-directions ) .",
    "when the interface is curved , the boundary condition at the interface involves a normal stress discontinuity , to account macroscopically for the microscopic interactions in the surface layers . for a fluid - fluid interface , this can be expressed as the difference in thermodynamic pressure , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the surface tension and @xmath18 is the curvature  @xcite .",
    "this macroscopic result can be contrasted with a purely microscopic approach that explicitly includes the molecular interactions .",
    "microscopically , the interfacial region will be continuous , but one should still recover _ as a result _ that the bulk stress far away from a curved interface is different in the two phases .",
    "for fluid - fluid interfaces , such a microscopic framework has been developed based on density functional theory using the so - called sharp - kink approximation  @xcite . as will be further outlined in the next subsection ,",
    "the key assumption of this theory is that the molecular interactions can be split in a long - range attractive part and a short - ranged repulsive interaction  @xcite .",
    "the attraction is described by a ( mean - field ) potential @xmath19 , while the repulsion is a contact interaction described by a microscopic stress tensor @xmath20 .",
    "the mechanical equilibrium equation then reads @xmath21 the sharp - kink approximation assumes that the interface between the two phases is perfectly sharp , but that the interaction potential is long - ranged and extends across the interface  most notably , the potential varies only near the interface and @xmath22 directly accounts for interfacial stresses . since capillary effects are already included in this description , the boundary condition is now the _ continuity _ of the normal stress @xmath23 across the interface .",
    "this model is very close to the original work by laplace @xcite , who postulated an internal pressure to balance the strong attractive forces between molecules . for incompressible liquids near a straight interface",
    ", we will derive the following connection between macroscopic and microscopic stress : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a constant .",
    "one should bear in mind that even under atmospheric conditions , the repulsive stress @xmath26 is orders of magnitude larger than @xmath27 , as it balances the strong attractive interaction @xmath19 .",
    "an estimate for the repulsive pressure is obtained by @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the scale of the repulsion ( a few angstroms ) and thus @xmath30 n / m@xmath31 , as already estimated by laplace @xcite .",
    "the description above is valid for fluids .",
    "below , we will generalize this formulation to account for elastic solids whose elastic properties arise from entropic effects .",
    "in other words , the description focuses on solids such as gels and elastomers , which are polymer solutions in which there is no connected structure based on enthalpic ( chemical ) elastic effects .",
    "the goal is to derive an expression for the surface stress [ eq .  ] from the microscopic interactions .",
    "we consider a simple model of liquid based on a pair potential @xmath32 .",
    "the key idea of the density functional theory is to express the grand potential @xmath33 as a functional of the particle density @xmath34 and to perform a functional minimisation for given values of the chemical potential @xmath35 and of the temperature @xmath36 .",
    "the free energy @xmath37 is not known explicitly and needs to be built by integration , starting from the free energy of a known state . for a perturbation theory",
    ", one may choose hard spheres or the same system with only a repulsive potential , and then treat the van der waals attraction as a corrective effect .    in the sharp interface approximation ,",
    "one uses a standard van der waals expansion of the free energy around the hard - sphere reference system ( whose pair potential is denoted @xmath38 ) , computed in the local density approximation .",

    "one can use , for instance , a low density approximation for @xmath40 : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is boltzmann s constant and @xmath36 the temperature .",
    "we now apply the gibbs interface idealization and assume that the density is homogeneous on both sides of the interface .",
    "we furthermore extend the description to several phases and introduce @xmath44 the effective potential associated to the influence of phase @xmath45 on phase @xmath46 , at @xmath47 : @xmath48 note that in general @xmath49 , unless the domains of @xmath45 and @xmath46 have an identical shape .",
    "altogether , we get contribution to the free energy associated to the phase @xmath45 as : @xmath50 d\\vec r\\ ] ] the long - range attractive interaction between liquid and solid molecules gives rise to a potential @xmath51 i.e. an energy per unit volume .",
    "the short - range repulsive interactions are assumed to lead to an isotropic stress i.e. to a contact pressure @xmath52  @xcite .",
    "minimising the free energy , we obtain the ( microscopic ) equilibrium condition inside the liquid , @xmath53 so that the total potential @xmath54 must be homogeneous @xcite .",
    "this is the same result as obtained in eq .",
    ", as for liquids @xmath55 and the macroscopic stress @xmath11 is homogeneous in the liquid phase .    in this work",
    ", we work with planar interfaces only and therefore , for future reference , we define the potential @xmath19 in phase @xmath45 due to the presence of a semi - infinite phase @xmath46 at distance @xmath56 from an interface as : @xmath57 note that , altough in general @xmath58 the equivalence @xmath59 does hold , since in that case the phases @xmath45 and @xmath46 are identically shaped ( both are infinite half - spaces ) . within this formalism",
    "we can readily compute the adhesion energies and hence the surface free energies . as the surface tensions are defined for flat interfaces between two semi - infinite phases ,",
    "these energies can be expressed in terms of integrals over @xmath60 and one finds @xcite : @xmath61      we now extend the density theory description to describe soft solids such as elastomers or gels .",
    "the elastic properties in such solids are of entropic origin and their structure is close to that of a liquid .",
    "therefore , we hypothesize that these solids can be described using the density functional theory in the sharp interface approximation , by replacing the repulsive pressure @xmath62 by an elastic stress tensor @xmath20 . just like the liquid in the previous section , this solid",
    "is assumed to be submitted to the long - range attractive potentials @xmath63 and @xmath64 , which are not included in the stress tensor @xmath65 .",
    "we therefore get a very similar expression as in the liquid case : @xmath66 as anticipated in eq .  .",
    "the next step is to find expressions for the components of @xmath11 and @xmath20 , which are generally not isotropic in the elastic case .",
    "the description of the solid differs from the liquid discussed in the previous section by the existence of a base state with respect to which deformations are measured .",
    "one standardly considers , for bulk elasticity , a base state which is stress free .",
    "however , this choice is problematic for capillary effects as these induce a pre - stress , even when no external force is exerted on the solid . to follow experimental constraints",
    ", we will therefore consider that the base state is the state in which the system was prepared .",
    "if a gel is prepared in a solid mold as in  @xcite , the base state will therefore be sensitive to the molecular interactions between this mold and the gel .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we will reduce the discussion to the case were the solid is prepared in void .    in order to express",
    "the constitutive relation of the material , we split both stresses into a reference part that is associated with the base state , and the elastic contribution relative to this base state : @xmath67 @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the stresses in a reference state , taken as a semi - infinite solid in contact with vacuum ( i.e. a solid - vacuum interface ) .",
    "for @xmath70 and @xmath71 we apply hooke s law .",
    "we will write the expressions using the thermodynamic stress @xmath72 only , but the same relations hold for the microscopic stress @xmath73 .",
    "hooke s law relates the components of the stress @xmath74 to the elastic strain @xmath75 : @xmath76\\ ] ] or equivalently : @xmath77 where @xmath78 with @xmath79 is the displacement vector , and @xmath80 the young s modulus .",
    "we consider plane strain conditions ( @xmath81 , with the @xmath13-direction normal to the interface ) , and therefore find : @xmath82 as explained above , the same expression holds for @xmath73 , so : @xmath83 this relation between the @xmath84 and @xmath85 components of the stress - tensor is at the core of the inequality between @xmath86 and @xmath3 .",
    "note that the stress - tensor for an incompressible surface layer ( @xmath5 ) is isotropic ( @xmath87 ) and we would recover liquid behaviour : @xmath88       schematic of a liquid and solid interface . ( a ) a liquid - vapour interface located at @xmath89 .",

    "one might argue that for most experiments this is a valid assumption : soft rubbers and gels are essentially incompressible , in which case our model recovers @xmath210 .",
    "intriguingly , however , recent experiments on a soft elastomeric wire clearly demonstrate that a tangential force is transmitted across the surface , and give rise to a significant tangential bulk strain @xcite .",
    "this strongly suggests that , while the bulk material clearly has @xmath211 , the interfacial layers of soft elastomers _ do _ exhibit a substantial degree of compressibility .",
    "this would explain why a tangential stress is transmitted in the vicinity of the contact line , even for incompressible bulk materials .",
    "a final consequence of such a tangential force is that the contact angles on very soft surfaces do not follow neumann s law @xcite .",
    "this provides a strong limitation on the recently proposed method to determine surface stresses from contact angle measurements @xcite .",
    "our work clearly shows that a more detailed microscopic description of the interfacial chemistry , combined with further experimental characterizations , are necessary to fully resolve the physics of elastocapillarity .",
