    "a necessary condition for the layers to be uniformly spaced is that their normal vector field points along geodesics of the surface  @xcite . in the flattened model ,",
    "these geodesics are just the straight lines of the plane . we know that defects ( even in flat space ) tend to concentrate on lower dimensional sets in order to save energy so",

    "this can be easily seen by noting that a geodesic is a curve with constant velocity that provides the path of minimal length  and therefore minimal time  between two given points .",
    "note that the smectic analog of time is the number of layers through which the geodesic passes over a given distance .",

    "the angle of refraction might differ from the angle of incidence if an interface separated two smectic phases of different layer spacing , as larger layer spacing is analogous to smaller index of refraction .",

    "apart from the fact that we would be surprised by the unusual pattern of brushes , we would also be led to identify a fictitious set of planar layers which are everywhere orthogonal to the projected geodesics , the latter being inferred from measurements under crossed polarizers . since the projected geodesics are not geodesics on the plane by themselves , these fictitious layers can not be equally spaced !",
