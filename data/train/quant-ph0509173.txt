    "during the last two decades a major research effort has been conducted in the emerging field of quantum information theory @xcite .",
    "much of this activity starts with the observation that the capacity of physical systems to process , store and transmit information depends on thir classical or quantum nature @xcite .",
    "quantum algorithms , that is , algorithms based on the laws of quantum mechanics , show an enhancement of information processing capabilities over their classical counterparts .",
    "a large collection of quantum communication protocols such as quantum teleportation @xcite , entanglement swapping @xcite , quantum cloning @xcite and quantum erasing @xcite reveal new forms of transmitting and storing classical and quantum information .",
    "most of these protocols have already been experimentally implemented @xcite .",
    "a common assumption concerning quantum algorithms and quantum communication protocols is the capacity of performing transformations belonging to a fixed but arbitrary set of unitary transformations together with measurements on a given basis . in this article",
    "we study the problem of mapping a mixed initial state onto a known pure state using measurements as the only allowed resource , that is , a measurement driven quantum evolution .",
    "we show how this problem connects naturally to generation of quantum copies , quantum deleting and entangled states generation .",
    "this article is organized as follows : in section [ 2d ] we study the problem considering states belonging to a two - dimensional hilbert space . in section [ ddimension ]",
    "we generalize to the case of a @xmath0-dimensional hilbert space and show that mutually unbiased bases optimize the overall success probability .",
    "section [ d - d and m / d ] presents the case of @xmath1 target states in a @xmath0-dimensional hilbert space . in section [ conclusions ] we summarize our results .",
    "let us consider a quantum system described by a two - dimensional hilbert space . initially , the system is in a mixed state @xmath2 .",
    "our goal consists in mapping this state onto the known target state @xmath3 by using quantum measurements as the only allowed resource .    in order to accomplish this task",
    "we define a non - degenerate observable @xmath4 .",
    "its spectral decomposition is @xmath5 where the @xmath3 and @xmath6 states are eigenstates of @xmath4 with eigenvalues @xmath7 and @xmath8 respectively .",
    "thereby , the target state must belong to the spectral decomposition .",
    "a measurement of the @xmath4 observable onto the @xmath2 state projects the system to the target state @xmath3 with probability @xmath9 . in this case",
    "we succeed and no further action is required",
    ". however , the process fails with probability @xmath10 when the measurement projects the system onto the @xmath6 state .",
    "since this state can not be projected to @xmath3 , the target state , by means of another measurement of @xmath4 , it is necessary to introduce a second observable @xmath11 whose nondegenerate eigenstates @xmath12 and @xmath13 are @xmath14 with @xmath15 and @xmath16 being real numbers .    a measurement of @xmath11 projects the @xmath6 state onto the state @xmath12 or @xmath13 .",
    "since both states have a component on the @xmath3 state , a second measurement of @xmath4 allows us to project again , with a certain probability , to the target state @xmath3 .",
    "the probability @xmath17 that this procedure fails after a first measurement of @xmath4 but is successful after a consecutive measurement of the @xmath11 and @xmath4 operators is @xmath18 ) .",
    "then , the success probability in the sequence of measurements @xmath19 is @xmath20 similarly , the success probability @xmath21 of mapping the initial state @xmath2 onto @xmath3 , the target state , after applying the consecutive measurement proceses @xmath22^nm(\\hat{\\varphi)}$ ] , that is , a measurement of @xmath4 followed by @xmath23 measurement processes each one composed of @xmath11 followed by @xmath4 , is given by @xmath24 or equivalently @xmath25 clearly , the extreme values @xmath26 and @xmath27 correspond to observables @xmath4 and @xmath11 defining the same basis .",
    "consequently , in this case the success probability becomes simply @xmath28 .",
    "the expression ( [ pe ] ) indicates that the success probability @xmath29 can be maximized by choosing @xmath30 .",
    "in this case we obtain @xmath31 fig .",
    "( [ fig1]a ) illustrates the behavior of the maximum success probability @xmath32 as a function of @xmath23 for different values of @xmath28 .",
    "we observe that @xmath32 quickly converges to @xmath33 almost independently of the @xmath28 even if the initial state @xmath2 belongs to a subspace orthogonal to @xmath3 .",
    "for instance , in this particular case , if the success probability for the first measurement of @xmath4 vanishes , after four successive measurements of @xmath11 and @xmath4 the success probability has increased to approximately @xmath34 , while after twelve measurement processes it reaches approximately the value @xmath35 .",
    "the fact that the success probability is maximized for @xmath30 indicates that in this case the @xmath11 and @xmath4 observables define two mutually unbiased bases in a two - dimensional hilbert space .",
    "( [ fig1]b ) shows @xmath29 versus @xmath23 for @xmath15 equal to @xmath36 ( circle ) , @xmath37 ( square ) , and @xmath38 ( triangle ) . since mutually unbiased bases give the optimal process for each @xmath23 , @xmath29 approaches to @xmath33 faster than in the other cases . as is apparent from fig .",
    "( [ fig1]b ) , the convergence of the success probability strongly depends on the relation between the involved bases . in the following section we study this relation and generalize the results of this section to the @xmath0-dimensional case .     as a function of n for three values of @xmath28 : @xmath39(triangle ) , @xmath40 ( square ) , @xmath41 ( circle ) , ( b ) @xmath29 as a function of n for three values of @xmath15 : @xmath38(triangle ) , @xmath37 ( square ) , @xmath36 ( circle ) , with @xmath42.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]",
    "two noncommuting and nondegenerate observables defined on a @xmath0-dimensional hilbert space can have at most @xmath44 equal eigenstates with @xmath45 .",
    "thus , on this @xmath44-dimensional subspace both observables can be well defined simultaneously , that is , the system can be described by one of the @xmath44 common eigenstates . however , on the @xmath46-dimensional subspace only one of them can be well defined .",
    "this property for two noncommuting observables turns up in a hilbert space only when its dimension is higher that @xmath47 .",
    "one can easily conclude that observables having some common eigendirections are not useful for our purpose . in this case",
    "the noncommutativity of the observables is a necessary but not sufficient condition , as in the two - dimensional case studied in the previous section .",
    "this motivates us to study the scheme of driving a quantum state by means of measurement in the general case of a @xmath0-dimensional hilbert space .",
    "we now generalize the previous results to the case of a target state , @xmath48 , belonging to a @xmath0-dimensional hilbert space .",
    "let @xmath49 and @xmath50 be orthonormal bases defined by the spectral decompositions of the non - degenerate observables @xmath4 and @xmath11 respectively . initially the system is described by the @xmath2 state to be mapped onto the known pure state @xmath51 .",
    "the probability of success after @xmath23 measurement processes of @xmath11 followed by @xmath4 , is given by @xmath52 , \\label{se}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 is defined as @xmath54 the process which maps the @xmath55 state with @xmath56 onto the @xmath51 state is fundamental in this protocol because it is repeated when we do not succeed .",
    "the success probability of this process is @xmath57 .",
    "this can be seen as an inner product between @xmath58 vectors whose @xmath0 real , non - negative components are @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) , that is , @xmath61 .",
    "this product is maximum when both vectors are parallel , which implies that @xmath62 for all @xmath63 .",
    "since these vectors are real and the sum of their components is unitary , we deduce that @xmath64 for all @xmath63 and that @xmath65 .",
    "therefore , we conclude that @xmath66 @xmath67 @xmath68 .",
    "this property indicates that , in the optimal case , the two @xmath11 and @xmath4 observables define two mutually unbiased bases . an alternative proof can be obtained by noting that it suffices to optimize the first step . that is , we need to project a @xmath6 state onto some element of the @xmath69 basis in order to take the state out from the subspace orthogonal to the desired direction .",
    "the resulting density matrix of this process is @xmath70 now we look for the basis which leads to the state nearest to the target state @xmath48 .",
    "this can be quantified by means of the hilbert - schmidt distance @xcite . in this case",
    ", we need to minimize the expression @xmath71 considering the @xmath2 state , this expression becomes @xmath72 which means that the @xmath69 basis must be complementary to the original @xmath73 basis .",
    "that is , the two required bases are related by means of the discrete fourier transformation . in this scheme only two complementary bases",
    "are required , which can always be found @xcite . a different proof can be obtained by interpreting @xmath57 as a correlation function and considering the property @xmath74 @xcite .    for mutually unbiased bases the success probability , eq .",
    "( [ se ] ) , simplifies considerably to @xmath75 in the limit , @xmath76 , this expression becomes @xmath77 thus , in the case of higher dimensions , in order to reach a success probability close to @xmath33 , it is required that the number @xmath23 of measurement processes of the @xmath11 observable followed by @xmath4 must be larger than the dimension @xmath0 of the hilbert space . otherwise , the term @xmath78 entering in eqs .",
    "( [ pk ] ) and ( [ pke ] ) dominates .",
    "we now proceed to obtain an average success probability which does not depend on the initial pure state .",
    "this is achieved by integrating over the whole hilbert space , that is @xmath79 where @xmath80 denotes the haar integration measure and we consider initially pure states only . in this case",
    "the average probability @xmath81 is @xmath82 where we have considered the case of mutually unbiased bases .",
    "the starting point is the identity @xcite @xmath83 where @xmath84 with @xmath85 is an arbitrary base for a @xmath0-dimensional hilbert space . taking the trace of this identity we obtain @xmath86 making @xmath87 and considering @xmath51 as belonging to the basis ,",
    "we obtain , for any @xmath51 state , the identity @xmath88 thereby , the average success probability becomes @xmath89 thus , if we randomly select an initial state , the average success probability of mapping this state onto the target state @xmath48 is given by @xmath81 . in the limit of large @xmath23 , @xmath81 becomes @xmath90 these results are equal to the case when the initial state @xmath2 is @xmath91 , see eqs .",
    "( [ pk ] ) and ( [ pke ] ) .    an interesting application of this result arises when we study the case of a target state @xmath48 belonging to a bipartite system , each system being described by a @xmath0-dimensional hilbert space . in particular @xmath92 assuming a factorized initial state of the form",
    "@xmath93 the success probability of the process which maps this state onto the @xmath48 state is given by @xmath94 ( 1-\\frac{1}{d^2})^n,\\ ] ] where the @xmath95 coefficient gives account of the initial decoherence process affecting the @xmath2 state .",
    "this coefficient relates the diagonal coefficients of @xmath2 to the non - diagonal coefficients through the relation @xmath96 with @xmath97 .",
    "it can be shown that the success probability can be upper bounded as @xmath98 ( 1-\\frac{1}{d^2})^n.\\ ] ] thereby , when @xmath99 , the maximum probability for fixed @xmath23 is achieved under the condition @xmath100 , that is , for a pure initial state . however , if @xmath101 , the probability is maximum when @xmath102 .",
    "this means that , for states fulfilling the condition @xmath101 , such as the singlet state , the success probability is higher in the case of total initial decoherence than in any other case , corresponding the smallest probability to an initially pure state .",
    "this scheme can also be connected to the application of quantum erasure .",
    "if we fix the target state , and consequently the @xmath11 and @xmath4 operators , then the sequence of measurements will map any initial state onto that same target state .",
    "thereby , the overall effect will correspond to probabilistically erasing the information content of the initial state .",
    "the success probability of this probabilistic erasure will be given by eq .",
    "( [ average success probability ] ) .",
    "the above results can be generalized to the case of @xmath1 orthogonal target states belonging to a @xmath0-dimensional hilbert space .",
    "here we consider again the bases @xmath49 and @xmath103 of the observables @xmath4 and @xmath11 respectively .",
    "our aim is to map the initial state @xmath2 onto any of the target states @xmath104 . after measuring the @xmath105 observable and failing ,",
    "the state of the system is in one of the @xmath106 states .",
    "the probability of mapping the system from any one of these states onto any one of the target states by a consecutive measurement of the @xmath11 and @xmath4 observables is given by @xmath107 this probability can be written as a sum of @xmath108 scalar products of the @xmath109 vectors defined in the previous section , that is @xmath110 the maximum value of this quantity is achieved when each scalar product involves two parallel vectors , that is @xmath111 since the sum of the elements of each @xmath109 vector is unity , we obtain @xmath112 @xmath113 .",
    "thus , it holds that @xmath114 , that is , all the @xmath109 vectors are equal .",
    "this implies that any state @xmath115 has the same projection onto all the states belonging to the @xmath116 basis , which is possible only if @xmath117 .",
    "therefore , the @xmath4 and @xmath11 observables define mutually unbiased bases . considering these types of bases , which optimize the process ,",
    "the probability of mapping the initial state @xmath2 onto any of @xmath1 states @xmath118 after @xmath23 measurement processes of @xmath11 and @xmath4 is given by @xmath119    as an application , let us suppose that we want to generate @xmath120 copies of each of the @xmath1 orthogonal states @xmath121 , belonging to a @xmath0-dimensional hilbert space .",
    "so , we can assume that the @xmath1 target states belong to a multipartite system composed of @xmath120 identical systems and that they have the form @xmath122 , where @xmath123 .",
    "then the probability of generating any of these `` state - copies '' after @xmath23 processes of measurement of @xmath11 followed by @xmath4 is @xmath124 where we have assumed that the initial state is factorized and that each of the @xmath120 systems is in the @xmath2 state . independently of the initial condition ,",
    "this probability is closer to unity when @xmath125 and @xmath126 . on the other hand , randomly selecting an initially pure state the average success probability of mapping this state onto one of the @xmath1 target `` state - copies '' is given by the expression @xmath127 which in the limit @xmath125 behaves as @xmath128 thus , in this limit the more the number @xmath120 of copies , the probability of success decreases or converges more slowly to @xmath33 .",
    "we have studied a scheme to map an unknown mixed state of a quantum system onto an arbitrary state belonging to a set of known pure quantum states .",
    "this scheme is based on a sequence of measurements of two noncommuting observables .",
    "the target states are eigenstates of one of the two observables , while the other observable maps the states out of the subspace orthogonal to the one defined by the target states . the success probability turns out to be maximal under the condition that the observables define mutually complementary bases . in other words ,",
    "both required bases are always related by a discrete fourier transform .",
    "we have also shown that these results hold in the case of arbitrary but finite dimensions .",
    "the scheme consists of applying a measurement of the @xmath4 observable followed by @xmath23 measurement processes each one composed of @xmath11 followed by @xmath4 , this is , @xmath129 .",
    "the target states belong to the spectral descomposition of the @xmath4 observable .",
    "the success probability quickly converges to unity when the number @xmath23 of the sequences of measurement processes is larger than the dimension of the hilbert space .",
    "we have connected these results to the generation of quantum copies , quantum deleting and pure entangled states generation .",
