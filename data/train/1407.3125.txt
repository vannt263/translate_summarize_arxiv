    "supernova remnants ( snrs ) are a unique resource that enables to investigate the final stage of the evolution of massive stars or binary stars interacting with the surrounding interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "studies of individual snrs in the milky way ( mw ) are important for understanding the detailed interaction between snrs and the ism . however",
    ", determining the global properties of the mw snrs is hard because of uncertain distances to individual remnants and high extinction in the galactic plane where most of the snrs are found .",
    "extragalactic snrs do not suffer from these problems so that they are an ideal target for investigating statistically their global properties and evolution as well as their relationship to the ism .",
    "they provide a clue to understand the star formation history and chemical evolution of galaxies .",
    "extragalactic snrs have been identified mostly at three bands : optical , radio and x - ray wavelengths .",
    "a majority of the known snrs in nearby galaxies were detected by optical surveys @xcite .",
    "we have been carrying a project to detect snrs in nearby galaxies .",
    "we presented a result of the first target , m31 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* henceforth l14 ) .",
    "this paper is the second of the series , presenting the results for m33 .",
    "m33 is an ideal galaxy for snr surveys , because it is nearby ( @xmath1800 kpc , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , relatively face - on ( @xmath4 = @xmath5 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and a late - type spiral ( sa(s)cd ) galaxy .",
    "@xcite first detected three snrs using optical images in m33 .",
    "subsequent optical studies have increased the number of m33 snrs to 137 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* henceforth l10 ) .",
    "@xcite showed that the cumulative size distribution ( @xmath6 ) of 50 snrs in m33 .",
    "it follows a power law , having an index @xmath7 .",
    "they estimated a sn rate to be one per 26 @xmath8 300 yr from the number of snrs .",
    "* henceforth g98 ) identified 98 snrs , of which 53 are previously unknown .",
    "they presented a @xmath6 for the 98 snrs and showed that the sedov - taylor ( st ) expansion model is a better fit for the distribution than the free expansion model .",
    "the st expansion model is used to derive a sn rate in m33 to be one sn every 360 yr .",
    "however , they used narrow images obtained under poor seeing ranging from 2  to 24 ( which corresponds to 8 - 10 pc at a distance of m33 ) .",
    "they could not measure the accurate size of snrs and could not distinguish snrs on the outskirts of sf regions .",
    "l10 presented a list of 137 snrs derived from two emission - line surveys using local group galaxy survey ( lggs ) data taken at the kpno 4 m telescope @xcite and observational data obtained from 0.6 m burrell schmidt telescope at kpno .",
    "they showed that 82 of 137 snrs are matched with x - ray objects derived from the chasem33 survey using @xmath9 .",
    "however , they missed a significant fraction of snrs with low optical surface brightness ( @xmath10)(@xmath11 ) .",
    "they mainly discussed x - ray properties of the snrs in m33 .",
    "recently , @xcite estimated a sn rate of m33 to be one sn every 140 - 150 yr , using x - ray data of the m33 snrs and physical models at various conditions of the ambient ism .",
    "thus we carry out a new optical search of snrs in m33 utilizing the images taken in the lggs . using these data ,",
    "we find new m33 remnants , especially those with low @xmath10 , concentrating on their optical properties .",
    "we utilized the and 2 images in the lggs to find new m33 remnants .",
    "the lggs covered three 36  square fields of m33 .",
    "we subtracted continuum sources from the narrow band images using the r - band images .",
    "we smoothed the images with better seeing to match the point - spread - function in the image with worse seeing , using iraf task @xmath12 .",
    "we then scaled and subtracted the resulting continuum images from narrow band images .",
    "we selected the m33 remnants considering three criteria : emission line ratio ( ) , the morphological structure , and the absence of blue stars inside the sources , as done for m31 in l14 .",
    "details are described in l14 .",
    "we detected objects with @xmath13 0.4 in emission line ratio maps , and selected the objects with round or shell structures in each narrow band image .",
    "as a result , we chose 435 sources .",
    "we estimated an integrated emission line ratio ( i.e. , the ratio of integrated fluxes ) for individual remnants to select the genuine snrs among these candidates .",
    "we set an approximate circular region to cover the region with @xmath14 in emission line ratio ( ) maps , and carried out aperture photometry of these sources .",
    "we determined the value of the local background for individual remnants , using a 100 pc @xmath15 100 pc box region that shows no emission near the snr candidate .",
    "we selected the objects that have integrated @xmath13 0.4 . in the cases of the objects with 0.4 @xmath16",
    "@xmath16 0.6 , we examined the existence of blue stars inside the remnants .",
    "we excluded the sources embedding blue stars .",
    "then we removed the objects larger than 100 pc , which is too big to be snrs ( * ? ? ? * l10 ; ) .",
    "finally we considered 199 objects as the probable snrs , including 79 new ones .",
    "l10 provided a catalog of 137 sources based on optical and x - ray data .",
    "we examined these objects according to our identification criteria and considered 17 of these objects to be non - snrs such as 2 or superbubbles .",
    "of these , seven objects do not appear to have high enough to be cataloged as snr candidates , and they are likely 2 .",
    "nine objects have sizes with @xmath17 100 pc and embed many blue stars inside , so that we considered them to be superbubbles . l10 also suggested that these objects are possible superbubbles .",
    "one object ( l10 - 35 ) is an oxygen - dominated snr with little emission in and 2 ( l10 ) .",
    "table [ table1 ] lists the 17 objects excluded according to our criteria .",
    "consequently , we confirmed that 120 of the 137 known objects satisfy our identification criteria .",
    "figure [ comlo2 ] compares ( a ) @xmath18 ( ) , ( b ) @xmath19 , ( c ) @xmath10 ( ) , and ( d ) of the remnants in this work and l10 .",
    "two measurements for each physical quantity of the objects are correlated well .",
    "we fit the data with linear least squares fitting , obtaining ( a ) log @xmath20h@xmath21(this work ) = 0.94(@xmath220.03 ) @xmath23 log @xmath20h@xmath21(l10)@xmath24 2.12(@xmath221.06 ) , ( b ) @xmath19(this work ) = 1.05(@xmath220.05 ) @xmath25(l10)@xmath26 3.11(@xmath221.94 ) pc , ( c ) log @xmath27h@xmath21(this work ) = 1.20(@xmath220.10 ) @xmath23 log @xmath27h@xmath21(l10)@xmath26 0.11(@xmath220.07 ) , and ( d ) ( this work ) = 1.19(@xmath220.06 ) @xmath23(l10)@xmath28 3.07(@xmath220.89 ) .",
    "we estimated the diameters of the circles covering the region with @xmath13 0.4 in emission line ( ) images . in the cases of objects with partial shells",
    ", we determined their sizes on the basis of the visible portion of the shells . the errors in measuring the sizes are about 0.5  for small objects ( @xmath19 = 10 @xmath1 50 pc ) and about 1  for larger objects",
    "( d @xmath13 50 pc ) .",
    "l10 determined elliptical regions that best traced optical shells of remnants , and they defined the geometric mean of the major and minor axes of above ellipses as sizes of the sources .",
    "they expanded slightly in a few cases to embrace x - ray emission that is apparently associated with the snr .",
    "the errors in their measuring the diameter are 0.5 @xmath8 1  for well - defined objects . in figure [ comlo2](b ) , we compared the diameters of the remnants in this work and l10 .",
    "they agree well in general .",
    "about 10 objects show differences larger than 10 pc .",
    "we checked the images of these objects , and confirmed that our measurements are reasonable .",
    "the mean difference ( @xmath19 = 10 @xmath1 40 pc ) is derived to be 1.7 pc , showing that our measurements are on average slightly larger than l10 s .",
    "we applied the classification schemes for the progenitor type and the morphological type to the m33 snr sample , as done for m31 in l14 .",
    "the progenitor types are type ia snrs and core - collapse ( cc ) snrs .",
    "details are described in l14 .",
    "cc sne are formed by high mass progenitors undergoing core collapse , while type ia sne are formed by white dwarfs in binary systems .",
    "the former are typically located in star forming regions , while the latter can be found anywhere in a galaxy , regardless of their host galaxy types .",
    "thus , some previous studies examined the properties of stellar populations around snrs to identify the nature of their sn progenitors @xcite .",
    "an existence of massive stars around an snr candidate suggests that the remnant may result from a cc sn , while the absence of nearby massive stars suggests that it may be originated from a type ia sn .",
    "we selected the blue stars with @xmath29 and @xmath30 mag ( @xmath31 mag ) from the photometric catalog given by @xcite .",
    "then we derived the number of ob stars in the surrounding region within 100 pc for individual remnants , @xmath32(ob ) , following l14 .",
    "@xcite showed that some massive runaway stars have been detected at distances of about 100 pc from the center of star clusters in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) . therefore the existence of ob stars within 100 pc from the center an snr indicates that its progenitor might have been a massive star .",
    "we adopted this distance as a boundary to count ob stars for progenitor classification .",
    "known snrs have various morphological features : a discrete shell , a filled - center nebula or a diffuse nebula .",
    "all the snr samples in m33 show resolved morphological structure at the resolution of images we use .",
    "even in relatively confused regions on the outskirts of 2 and sf regions the objects are resolved well .",
    "thus we classified 199 sources in m33 according to their shape as well as environments .",
    "table [ table2 ] summarizes our criteria used for the classification .",
    "figure [ sample ] displays some examples of the remnants for individual morphological categories .",
    "the majority of a2-class remnants have brighter @xmath10 than other types , as shown in figures [ sb](a ) and ( b ) .",
    "the majority of b2-class remnants are embedded in sf regions .",
    "their @xmath10 is brighter compared with the other b - class objects , as displayed in figures [ sb](c ) and ( d ) .",
    "by applying the snr search method described in the previous section , we detected a total of 199 sources . among these",
    "there are 79 new objects detected in this work and 120 known ones in the catalogs of previous studies ( g98 and l10 ) .",
    "table [ table3 ] presents a list of the 199 sources . in the table",
    "the columns give the i d number , the coordinates in right ascension and declination ( j2000.0 ) , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , , morphological types , @xmath32(ob ) , and progenitor types . the last column in table [ table3 ] gives the identification matched with the catalog of l10 .    of the sample ,",
    "170 objects result more likely from cc sne , with the remainder to be from type ia sne .",
    "m33 has flocculent spiral arms so that a significant fraction of its disk is occupied by star forming regions .",
    "therefore the type ia remnants located in the disk are likely to be classified as the cc remnants according to our classification criteria",
    ". then the 170 sources classified as cc would be an overestimate .",
    "if the number density of the type ia remnants is uniform , about 10% of the cc remnants may be the type ia remnants .",
    "there are a few results for the relative ratio of two categories of remnants ( chu & kennicutt 1988 ; franchetti et al .",
    "2012 ; l14 ) .",
    "according to the study of 32 objects in the lmc by @xcite more than @xmath33 of them are cc remnants . @xcite and l14 also inspected the stellar population around remnants in m101 and m31 , respectively .",
    "they showed that @xmath125% ( 9 of 34 ) and @xmath127% ( 42 of 156 ) are more likely type ia remnants , respectively . a fraction ( @xmath117% ) of the type ia snr remnants for m33 in this work is smaller than those for m101 and m31 .",
    "the majority of the objects with a - class and b - class are cc snrs ( @xmath185% for each ) . in the cases of the a3-class ( @xmath131% ) and b3-class ( @xmath139% ) objects , the type ia proportions are high , compared with those of objects of different morphological categories .",
    "l14 showed @xmath185% of m31 remnants are classified as shell remnants and @xmath115% are center - bright remnants .",
    "the majority ( @xmath190% ) of the m33 remnants are also shell remnants .",
    "it is noted that the proportions of the shell remnants and center - bright remnants in the mw at radio wavelengths are @xmath34 and @xmath35 , while the rest is composite type remnants @xcite .",
    "massive stars ( which explode as cc sne ) would tend to be found near sf regions such as 2 , molecular clouds , and spiral arms , while evolved , lower mass stars ( which explode as type ia sne ) are expected to be distributed in a more random manner across the plane of a galaxy s disk . below we examined the distributions of remnants relative to spiral arms as well as the radial distributions of their number density .",
    "the positions of the m33 remnants are displayed in figure [ spattype ] . the background image ( @xmath36 24 @xmath37 m ) exhibits the sf regions along the arms .",
    "the cc remnants are mainly distributed along the spiral arms .",
    "in contrast the majority of the type ia remnants are located in the outer part of m33 .",
    "the radial number density profile for the m33 remnants is seen in figure [ spat2 ] .",
    "we derived deprojected galactocentric distance ( @xmath38 ) adopting the position angle , @xmath39 @xcite and the inclination angle , @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the radial number density profile of all the objects decreases slightly outward with an abrupt break near @xmath38 = 4 kpc .",
    "discernible concentrations are seen at @xmath40 2 kpc and @xmath13.5 kpc , and a much weaker concentration at @xmath40 5 kpc .",
    "the histogram of the a - class remnants shows discernible concentrations at the @xmath40 2 kpc and @xmath13.5 kpc , and the number density decreases slightly outward . on the other hand ,",
    "the distribution of the b - class remnants decreases more smoothly .",
    "we investigated the radial variation in physical properties of all the remnants in figure [ radialall ] : ( a ) @xmath18 ( ) and ( b ) @xmath18(2 ) , ( c ) @xmath19 , ( d ) @xmath10 ( ) and ( e ) @xmath10(2 ) . the @xmath18 ( ) and @xmath18(2 ) of the objects",
    "change little at @xmath41 kpc . in the outer region ( @xmath42 kpc ) , @xmath18 ( ) and @xmath18(2 ) of the objects decrease slightly outward . in the same range of @xmath38",
    ", @xmath19 increases from 40 pc to 50 pc .",
    "thus , the radial gradients of @xmath10 ( ) and @xmath10(2 ) are seen in figures [ radialall ] ( d ) and ( e ) .",
    "this might be caused by the selection bias in our snr survey .",
    "we could find the remnants with more large @xmath19 and lower @xmath10 easily in the outer region of a galaxy .",
    "the evolution of snrs has been a subject of many theoretical studies @xcite .",
    "some previous studies tried to explain observation data in theoretical aspects ( mathewson et al .",
    "1983 ; green 1984 ; badenes et al .",
    "2010 , henceforth b10 ; dopita et al .",
    "their evolution is described in terms of age .",
    "however , it is hard to determine observationally the age of the snrs .",
    "thus their sizes are used as a proxy for age .",
    "the differential size distributions of the m33 remnants are shown in figure [ size](a ) .",
    "their diameters range from 10 pc to 100 pc .",
    "the histogram shows a noticeable concentration at @xmath43 45 pc with a broad wing toward the large size .",
    "a discernible concentration at the same value is seen at the histogram of the cc remnants . on the other hand ,",
    "no distinguishable concentration is shown at the histogram of the type ia remnants .",
    "the majority of the objects smaller than @xmath44 30 pc are the cc remnants .",
    "the mean diameter of the type ia remnants is larger than that of the cc remnants .",
    "this means that a majority of the cc remnants may lie on denser ambient ism than the type ia remnants .",
    "the @xmath6 of snrs in a galaxy is useful for studying their evolutionary phases .",
    "their evolution is generally described by the three phase model : the free expansion phase , the st phase , and the radiative phase @xcite .",
    "it is considered that the shapes of the @xmath6 are different , depending on the evolution phase .",
    "if the sn rate in a galaxy is constant , the @xmath6 of snrs becomes steeper as snrs evolve . during the free expansion phase",
    ", it will increase linearly , @xmath45 .",
    "the power law index will be 2.5 for the st phase , and that will be 3.5 for the radiative phase .",
    "thus , a study of the @xmath6 of snrs in a galaxy is important to understand the evolution of snrs .",
    "the transition sizes between these three phases are supposed to depend on several parameters including the density of surrounding ism , mass of ejected material , and energy released by sne @xcite . the transition radius from free expansion phase to st phase ranges from 1 to 10 pc , and that from st to radiative phase is about 25 pc .",
    "the @xmath6 of the m33 remnants is seen in figure [ size](b ) .",
    "it follows a power law form ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "the power law index is @xmath47 ( @xmath19 = 17 @xmath1 50 pc ) .",
    "the majority of the remnants are considered to be in the st phase .",
    "their number decreases abruptly at @xmath44 17 pc as the size of the objects decreases .",
    "there are only a few sources that have sizes of @xmath48 17 pc .",
    "the slope of the @xmath6 of snrs at @xmath17 50 pc is flatter compared with that of smaller snrs .",
    "this indicates two possibilities .",
    "first , the flatter slope may be due to incompleteness .",
    "we might have missed a significant number of the snrs , that have large @xmath19 and low @xmath10 in the inner regions of the galaxy .",
    "second , this may correspond to the transition stage from the st phase to the radiative phase .",
    "b10 suggested that the majority of the objects are in the st phase , and that they rapidly fade away below detection limit once they transit to the radiative phase .",
    "the slope for the cc remnants is @xmath49 ( @xmath19 = 17 @xmath1 50 pc ) , but that for the type ia remnants is @xmath50 ( @xmath19 = 40 @xmath1 60 pc ) .    in figures [ sizemor](a ) and",
    "( b ) , we plot the size histograms of the objects with different morphological categories .",
    "the histogram of the a - class remnants shows two concentrations at @xmath43 40 pc and @xmath160 pc , whereas that of the b - class remnants shows a broad concentration at @xmath43 50 pc .",
    "the diameter of the a - class remnants is , on average , @xmath43 45 pc , which is smaller than that of the b - class remnants , @xmath43 54 pc . in figure [ sizemor](b ) , the @xmath6s of the a - class and b - class remnants have close slopes up to 50 pc .",
    "the slopes for the a - class and b - class remnants are @xmath51 ( @xmath19 = 17 @xmath1 50 pc ) and @xmath52 for the same range , respectively .",
    "this means that the size evolution of snrs may not depend on their morphological category .",
    "we derived the emission line ratio ( ) to identify the snr candidates .",

    ", there is little difference in the distributions of physical properties between the m31 and m33 snr candidates .",
    "the @xmath6s of snrs can be often described by the power law @xcite .",
    "the @xmath6s of both the mw snrs and snrs in the magellanic clouds ( mcs ) were represented well by a power law index @xmath59 1 @xcite , while the m33 remnants follow a power law , having an index @xmath59 2.5 ( g98 ) .",

    "the correlation between @xmath71 and @xmath2 of the a - class remnants is stronger than that of the b - class remnants in m33 .",
