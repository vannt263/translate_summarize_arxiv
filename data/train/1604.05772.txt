    "crucial goals of future oscillation experiments are ( @xmath1 ) the determination of the neutrino mass ordering and the cp - violating phase @xmath2 , and ( @xmath3 ) establishing the robustness of three - flavour oscillations with respect to physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) . in the present work",
    "we show that those two items are intimately related .",
    "we consider the hypothesis that additional interactions affect the neutrino sector , beyond the sm weak interaction  @xcite , see  @xcite for recent reviews .",
    "we will show that , for a certain choice of these non - standard interactions ( nsi ) , the determination of the neutrino mass ordering ",
    "one of the main goals of upcoming oscillation experiments  @xcite  becomes impossible , due to an exact degeneracy in the evolution equation governing neutrino oscillations in matter .",

    "three - flavour neutrino evolution in an arbitrary matter potential is described by the schroedinger equation @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a vector of the flavour amplitudes , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 .",
    "the hamiltonian describing evolution in vacuum is @xmath8 with @xmath9 , where @xmath10 stands for the neutrino mass - squared difference , and @xmath11 is the neutrino energy . from neutrino oscillation data , we know that @xmath12",
    ". the neutrino mass ordering is parametrized by the sign of the larger mass - squared difference , with normal ordering ( no ) corresponding to @xmath13 and inverted ordering ( io ) to @xmath14 .",
    "the sign of @xmath15 by convention is chosen positive .",
    "the standard parametrization for the leptonic mixing matrix is @xmath16 , where @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) denotes a real ( complex ) rotation in the @xmath19 sector , with mixing angle @xmath20 .",
    "here we find it convenient to use an equivalent parametrization , where we put the complex phase @xmath2 in the 12 rotation , such that @xmath21 . after subtracting a term proportional to the unit matrix , the vacuum hamiltonian becomes @xmath22 with the 12 block given by @xmath23    let us consider now the presence of neutral - current ( nc ) nsi in the form of dimension-6 four - fermion operators , which may contribute to the effective potential in matter in @xmath24 .",
    "we follow the notation of @xcite , for a recent review see _ e.g.",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "nsi are described by the lagrangian @xmath25 where , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 denotes a fermion present in the background medium .",
    "the parameter @xmath28 parametrizes the strength of the new interaction with respect to the fermi constant @xmath29 .",
    "hermiticity requires that @xmath30 .",
    "note that we restrict to vector interactions , since we are interested in the contribution to the effective matter potential .",
    "in generic models of new physics nsi parameters are expected to be small .",
    "however , examples of viable gauge models leading to @xmath31 can be found in @xcite ( see also @xcite for a discussion of nsi models ) .",
    "the matter part of the hamiltonian is then obtained as @xmath32    \\epsilon_{\\alpha\\beta } & = \\sum_{f = e , u , d } y_f(x ) \\epsilon_{\\alpha\\beta}^f \\ , , \\label{eq : eps}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath33 , @xmath34 being the density of fermion @xmath27 along the neutrino path .",
    "this implies that the effective nsi parameters @xmath35 may depend on @xmath36 .",
    "the `` 1 '' in the @xmath37 entry in eq",
    ".   corresponds to the standard matter potential @xcite . for neutral matter ,",
    "the densities of electrons and protons are equal .",
    "thus , the relative densities of up and down quarks are @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the relative neutron density along the neutrino path . below we will use the notation @xmath40 and @xmath41 to indicate when the @xmath35 refer to the specific matter composition of the earth or the sun , respectively .",
    "let us consider first the vacuum part of the hamiltonian , @xmath42 defined in eqs .   and .",
    "it is easy to show that the transformation @xmath43 implies that @xmath44 . inserting this into eq .   and",
    "taking the complex conjugate we recover exactly the same evolution equation , when we take into account that complex conjugation of the amplitudes ( @xmath45 ) is irrelevant , as only moduli of flavour amplitudes are observable .",
    "is a consequence of cpt invariance .",
    "it has been noted in the context of nsi in @xcite and applied in some limiting cases , see also @xcite . ]",
    "this proves that the transformation leaves the three - flavour evolution in vacuum invariant .",
    "note that this transformation corresponds to a complete inversion of the neutrino mass spectrum .",
    "the transformation @xmath46 exchanges no and io , while changing the octant of @xmath0 exchanges the amount of @xmath47 present in @xmath48 and @xmath49 . we denote the effect of the transformation as `` flipping '' the mass spectrum .",
    "the corresponding degeneracy is known in limiting cases , for instance , the so - called mass ordering degeneracy in the context of long - baseline experiments @xcite .",
    "it is manifest also in the exact expression for the three - flavour @xmath47 survival - probability @xmath50 in vacuum , relevant for medium - baseline reactor experiments  @xcite .",
    "it is clear that for a non - zero standard matter effect , eq .   with @xmath51 ,",
    "the transformation no longer leaves the evolution invariant , since @xmath24 remains constant .",
    "the matter effect in the 13-sector is the basis of the mass ordering determination in long - baseline accelerator @xcite and atmospheric neutrino @xcite experiments .",
    "moreover , the observation of the msw  @xcite matter resonance in the sun requires that @xmath52 , which forbids the transformation in the second line of eq .  .",
    "this allows , in principle , for the determination of the mass ordering via a precise measurement of @xmath50 in vacuum  @xcite , as intended for instance by the juno collaboration @xcite .",
    "however , if in addition to the transformation , it is also possible to transform @xmath53 , then the full hamiltonian including matter would transform as @xmath54 , leaving the evolution equation invariant . this can be achieved in presence of nsi , supplementing the transformation with  @xcite @xmath55 the transformation of @xmath56 is crucial to change the sign of the @xmath37 element of @xmath24 including the standard matter effect .",
    "note that eq .",
    "depends on the parametrization used for @xmath42 in eq .  .",
    "if the standard parametrization with @xmath57 was used instead , then we would obtain @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and all other @xmath35 transforming as in eq .  .",
    "since in general the @xmath35 are dependent on the neutron density , the degeneracy can be broken in principle by comparing experiments in matter with different neutron densities , or in configurations where the neutron density changes significantly along the neutrino path .",
    "however , one can choose couplings such that nsi with neutrons are zero and take place only with protons and/or electrons , by choosing @xmath60 proportional to the quark electric charge , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath61 . in this situation",
    "the @xmath35 are always independent of @xmath36 , the degeneracy is complete and can not be broken by any combination of neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "let us illustrate the degeneracy by the following example : assume that there are no nsi in nature .",
    "then we can fit data from any neutrino oscillation experiment either with standard oscillations and the correct spectrum , or equally well with a flipped spectrum and @xmath62 .",
    "for @xmath63 we obtain @xmath62 independent of the neutron density , and hence the degeneracy will be perfect , irrespective of the matter environment .",
    "a manifestations of this result is the so - called lma - dark solution for solar neutrinos @xcite , which corresponds to a fit to solar neutrino data with @xmath64 ( `` dark octant '' ) and values of @xmath65 . in the sun",
    "the neutron fraction @xmath66 drops from about 1/2 in the centre to about 1/6 at the border of the solar core . from eqs .   and follows , that for @xmath65 we obtain @xmath67 , close to the value needed for the generalized mass ordering degeneracy . in @xcite",
    "a recent analysis of solar neutrino data has been performed , assuming either nsi with up or down quarks . in this case",
    "@xmath66 does not drop out of @xmath35 defined in eq .  , and",
    "hence the condition @xmath68 can not be fulfilled along the whole neutrino path in the sun .",
    "therefore , the degeneracy is not perfect . in @xcite",
    "the @xmath69 of the lma - dark solution is nearly zero for nsi on up quarks and @xmath70 for down quarks .",
    "while the sign of @xmath71 is irrelevant for solar neutrino phenomenology , it has been realised in @xcite , that the @xmath72 ambiguity introduced by the lma - dark solution leads to a mass ordering ambiguity in the planned reactor experiment juno @xcite .",
    "this is a manifestation of the generalized degeneracy discussed above .    as another example",
    ", we will now demonstrate the impact of the generalized degeneracy on the sensitivity of the long - baseline deep underground neutrino experiment ( dune ) @xcite to the mass ordering . in absence of nsi",
    ", the dune experiment would be able to reject the wrong hypothesis for the mass ordering with a significance above @xmath73 regardless of the true value of @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "we calculate expected data for no , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and no nsi .",
    "the simulation is performed using globes @xcite ; the simulation details are the same as in ref .",
    ". then these artificial data are fitted by allowing for the simultaneous presence of @xmath56 and @xmath76 , while all other nsi parameters are set to zero , for simplicity .",
    "results are shown by the shaded regions in fig .",
    "[ fig : vplot ] .",
    "the lower panel confirms the perfect degeneracy of the flipped mass spectrum at @xmath77 and @xmath78 , with @xmath79 with respect to the true best fit point . in both panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : vplot ] we observe also a strong correlation between @xmath80 and @xmath81 , see @xcite .",
    "therefore , while the degeneracy is exact for @xmath82 , it is recovered to a good accuracy for nonzero values of @xmath81 as long as @xmath83 .",
    "the importance of @xmath80 and @xmath81 for the mass ordering determination in dune has been pointed out recently in @xcite .     and @xmath81 .",
    "in the upper panel we fit with the correct mass spectrum , while in the lower panel we adopt io and exchange @xmath72 .",
    "the shaded regions correspond to dune alone , whereas the contour curves include the constraints from global oscillation data @xcite and from the charm experiment @xcite on the nc cross section .",
    "we marginalize over @xmath84 , @xmath2 , @xmath85 and the complex phase of @xmath81 . ]",
    "since the generalized degeneracy is exact and holds for any oscillation experiment , the only way to break it are non - oscillation experiments .",
    "indeed , operators of the type in eq .",
    "contribute to the neutral current ( nc ) neutrino scattering cross section .",
    "unfortunately , data on electron neutrino nc scattering is scarce .",
    "a relevant constraint on the parameters of interest to us comes from the historical charm experiment  @xcite , which has measured the quantity @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is ratio of the electron neutrino plus antineutrino nc cross sections to the corresponding charged current ones . in presence of nsi",
    "we have @xmath88 , where @xcite @xmath89 \\,,\\ ] ] with @xmath90 , and @xmath91 are the sm nc couplings .",
    "we have included only the vector - like nsi parameters .",
    "note that the charm constraint is somewhat model dependent , since it would not apply if the mediator particle responsible for the nsi is much lighter than the momentum transfer in charm ( typically of several tens of gev ) @xcite .",
    "( 2  d.o.f . ) from charm  @xcite ( assuming nsi from a heavy mediator ) in the plane of @xmath92 and @xmath93 , for @xmath94 .",
    "the cross corresponds to the point of exact degeneracy , eq .  .",
    "the diagonal lines indicate the parameters for which @xmath68 in earth and solar matter . ]    assuming that the charm bound applies , we follow ref .",
    "@xcite and we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : charm ] the allowed region for @xmath92 and @xmath93 from the charm data .",
    "the point from eq .",
    ", corresponding to perfect degeneracy for any matter profile , is indicated by the cross in the figure .",
    "we observe that it is excluded by charm data : for this point we predict @xmath95 , which disagrees with the charm experimental value at @xmath96 .",
    "the diagonal lines in the figure indicate the parameters for which @xmath68 in earth and solar matter .",
    "we use that in earth matter , @xmath97 , and for the sun we show the spread induced by @xmath98 . for neutrino trajectories in the earth ,",
    "the generalized degeneracy holds along the line indicated in the plot .",
    "however , since the degeneracy for the sun appears for slightly different values of @xmath99 there is the potential to break it by the combination . indeed , for the lma - dark solution for nsi either on up or down",
    "quarks we have @xmath100  @xcite . from fig .",
    "[ fig : charm ] we see that @xmath101 is in strong disagreement with charm , while @xmath102 is within the @xmath103 region .",
    "let us therefore adopt the hypothesis of nsi with up quarks only and check whether solar neutrino and charm data could break the mass ordering degeneracy for dune .",
    "the contour curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : vplot ] show the combined analysis , where we include global oscillation data ( including the solar neutrino `` sno - poly '' analysis ) from @xcite , assuming that @xmath92 and @xmath104 are approximately uncorrelated .",
    "if we restrict @xmath78 , the degeneracy is broken , since @xmath105 ( as required by solar data ) implies @xmath106 , which can be excluded at high confidence level by dune for @xmath107 . however ,",
    "if we allow for non - zero @xmath81 , we see that a large region with the flipped mass spectrum remains below the @xmath108 level around @xmath106 and @xmath109 .",
    "hence , we conclude that including present constraints from oscillation and scattering data , the degeneracy will severely affect the mass ordering sensitivity of dune .",
    "let us note that if more nsi parameters are allowed to vary , the fit with the flipped spectrum may even improve further .",
    "we have demonstrated that the so - called lma - dark solution is a manifestation of an exact degeneracy at the level of the neutrino evolution equation .",
    "this degeneracy makes it impossible to determine the neutrino mass ordering by neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "it requires nsi comparable in strength to weak interactions .",
    "the only way to break the degeneracy is via non - oscillation experiments . we have shown that taking into account current data on the @xmath47 nc cross section excludes nsi needed for the exact generalized degeneracy ( subject to some model dependence ) ; however , the degeneracy remains to be present at an approximate level , still destroying the mass ordering sensitivity of planned experiments . in order to break",
    "the degeneracy at high confidence level , improved data on @xmath47 nc interactions is mandatory .",

    "note that flavour evolution in oscillation experiments is only sensitive to differences of the diagonal elements of the hamiltonian .",
