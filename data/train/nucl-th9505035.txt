    "<S> we use a boost - invariant one - dimensional ( cylindrically symmetric ) fluid dynamics code to calculate @xmath0 production from @xmath1 and @xmath2 decay in the central rapidity region of a central s+au collision at @xmath3 gev / nucleon . </S>",

    "<S> one of the most important problems in nuclear physics today is the study of the equation of state ( eos ) of high - temperature and high - density hadronic matter ; the former is necessary to understand the first few microseconds of the big bang , and the latter for elucidating the physics of neutron stars and similar dense astrophysical objects . in order to investigate the nature of the transition from normal ( @xmath8 ) hadronic matter to deconfined quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) , or whatever </S>",

    "<S> the only particles expected to emerge from the early part of the collision ( and thus the only probes of the high - temperature eos ) are photons and leptons , which therefore may provide the most important information obtained from these collisions </S>",
    "<S> .    predicted @xmath0 transverse mass , @xmath6 , spectra from resonance decays in ultra - relativistic nuclear collisions are sensitive to the hadronic transition temperature , @xmath7 , when transverse expansion is neglected@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , measurements of these spectra may place strong constraints on @xmath7 , as well as other parameters of the hadronic eos@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the photon transverse momentum spectrum was also predicted to be sensitive to @xmath7@xcite , but the sensitivity disappeared when transverse expansion was included@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the next natural step is to study @xmath0 transverse mass spectra with a model including transverse expansion . </S>",
    "<S> this is the subject of the present paper . </S>",
    "<S> since transverse expansion may increase the contribution of mesons decaying after freeze - out , a careful treatment of freeze - out is necessary . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the @xmath6 spectra are in fact dominated by the freeze - out contribution for sufficiently high @xmath6 , but can still be fitted with apparent temperatures correlated to @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> this may provide a method to determine @xmath7 experimentally , even though the underlying physics is more complicated than originally envisioned in the treatment of lepton pairs without transverse expansion@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the correlation between @xmath7 and the @xmath6 spectrum of dileptons from @xmath1 and @xmath2 decay persists in the presence of transverse expansion , and thus that a determination of the transverse mass spectrum of dileptons in the @xmath9 peak would yield useful constraints on @xmath7 .    here </S>",
    "<S> we adopt the position that in strongly - interacting matter at sufficiently high temperature and/or density a transition takes place to a high - energy phase . in the present paper , we are interested in the possibility of extracting the transition temperature assuming a first - order phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> we assume a boost - invariant longitudinal expansion as discussed by bjorken@xcite , coupled to a cylindrically symmetric transverse expansion . </S>",
    "<S> for the initial evolution , we use a simple model for production of longitudinally free - streaming hot matter@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> after the hot matter has thermally equilibrated , we use thermal equilibrium fluid - dynamical evolution , but consider deviations from chemical equilibrium in the high - temperature phase by allowing the quark and antiquark densities to be a ( fixed ) fraction , @xmath10 , of their equilibrium values . when particle mean free paths become comparable to the radius of the cylinder of hot matter , which we take to occur at some freeze - out temperature , @xmath11 </S>",
    "<S> , we assume that the particles crossing the freeze - out surface @xmath12 stream freely until they either decay or reach the detectors . </S>",
    "<S> we then calculate the @xmath0 production rate from @xmath1 and @xmath2 decays ; these are not separated , as the masses are almost degenerate and the experimental resolution is typically not good enough to resolve the individual peaks . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the sensitivity to different assumptions about the initial temperature , freeze - out temperature , and quark fraction , and compare production rates to the preliminary na45 data@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we use standard high - energy conventions , @xmath13 .    </S>",
    "<S> here we describe the initial conditions and assumptions about the eos ; the details of the fluid - dynamical calculation can be found elsewhere@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we consider a central collision of two large nuclei at sps energy ( @xmath3 gev / nucleon ) . </S>",
    "<S> for such high collision energies we expect approximate longitudinal boost invariance@xcite , so the behavior of the produced matter at different rapidities is the same in the longitudinally comoving frame for fixed proper time @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the distance along the beam axis . at @xmath16 </S>",
    "<S> the colliding nuclei reach the point of maximum overlap and are assumed to form a longitudinally expanding pancake . </S>",

    "<S> this is approximately compatible with the initial entropy density for short times@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we determine @xmath22 by assuming entropy conservation for @xmath23 , hence @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the entropy density , with total ( charged plus neutral ) multiplicity density @xmath26 .    </S>",

    "<S> so the entropy density is @xmath29 independent of the phase of the matter . </S>",
    "<S> below @xmath7 , the eos is that of a massless pion gas . because recent calculations have predicted that the quarks may reach only a fraction of their equilibrium number by the beginning of transverse expansion@xcite , we take @xmath30 , where @xmath10 is a parameter that we vary between 0 and 1 to simulate the effect of reducing the quark density in the qgp below the equilibrium value ( @xmath10=1 is equilibrium for two flavors of massless quarks ) . the vacuum energy density in the deconfined phase , @xmath31 , is related to the transition temperature , @xmath7 , by requiring equal pressures in the deconfined and hadronic phases at @xmath32 so that @xmath33 . </S>",

    "<S> mesons which pass through the freeze - out surface @xmath12 are no longer subject to fluid - dynamic flow , as their mean free paths are so long that they do not interact with the surrounding matter . as these frozen - out mesons free - stream toward the detectors they decay to @xmath0 pairs as before , but the number of mesons decreases exponentially in time , with time constant equal to the free space meson decay time . </S>",

    "<S> the @xmath57 function ensures that only mesons going through the freeze - out surface in the outward direction are counted .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we extract the fit temperature , @xmath58 , by performing a least - squares fit to our calculated spectrum ( equilibrium plus freeze - out ) in the window @xmath59 gev , which is dominated by freeze - out . </S>",
    "<S> the part of the spectrum that is dominated by the equilibrium contribution is much smaller , typically @xmath60 gev . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately this is of the order of a single experimental bin , so we choose instead to focus on the freeze - out contribution , in anticipation of fitting experimental data with both equilibrium and freeze - out contributions . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , a measurement of an @xmath6 spectrum from the @xmath61 peak would look at a finite range of @xmath62 , so we filter the simulated data through an invariant mass bin of size @xmath63 gev , assuming a breit - wigner distribution for each species . for our fitting function , </S>",

    "<S> we use @xmath69 for central s+au collisions at sps energy ( the na45 experimenters estimate @xmath70 for their s+au collision sample , and we assume isospin symmetry ) . our standard value for the equilibration time , @xmath66= 0.2 fm/@xmath19 , implies an initial temperature @xmath71 mev . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1 shows the equilibrium , freeze - out and total contributions for the standard set with @xmath7=170 mev .    in the absence of transverse expansion , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath58 is a monotonically increasing function , and comparable to @xmath7 , so one can infer @xmath7 given @xmath58 from the measured @xmath0 spectrum@xcite . in fig .  2 </S>",
    "<S> , we vary @xmath7 from 150 to 200 mev and calculate the resulting values of @xmath58 while including transverse expansion . </S>",
    "<S> we find that @xmath58 is higher than in the case of longitudinal - only expansion , but still monotonic ( except where @xmath11 approaches @xmath7 ) . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath58 is 10 - 20 mev lower for @xmath66=1 fm ( @xmath22=192 mev ) , which we attribute to the fact that transverse expansion develops relatively little in this case .    </S>",
    "<S> note that freeze - out is treated dynamically in the present calculation in contrast to an earlier investigation @xcite where transverse expansion was neglected and thus freeze - out was approximated as occurring at a fixed proper time . </S>",
    "<S> we consider a moving freeze - out surface here , and the yield from mesons crossing this surface is integrated over the history of the collision . </S>",
    "<S> this contribution is enhanced by transverse expansion ; the larger the temperature difference @xmath72 , the stronger the enhancement . </S>",
    "<S> we find that increasing @xmath11 to 140 mev from its standard value decreases @xmath58 . for larger </S>",
    "<S> @xmath11 the hadronic matter near the freeze - out surface expands outward at a lower velocity , so that there is less contribution to @xmath6 from the fluid motion . </S>",
    "<S> thus @xmath58 , which depends strongly on the fluid motion , is lowered .    the curve for @xmath73 shows that @xmath58 is about 15 mev higher than for @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> the increase occurs because the temperature of the mixed phase , which makes a large contribution to the @xmath0 spectrum , is raised when @xmath10 is lowered and @xmath31 is held constant .    </S>",
    "<S> our overall production at the @xmath9 peak is up to a factor 3 below the value measured by the na45 experiment . </S>",
    "<S> we take the value measured in the experimental bin @xmath74 gev ( which contains the @xmath75 peak ) , assuming that the signal is all from meson decay , obtaining @xmath76 gev@xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the same quantity for our simulated data from the standard calculation with @xmath7=150 mev , including the experimental acceptance by counting only @xmath0 pairs whose members both have @xmath78 , and integrating over a breit - wigner distribution for each species , giving us @xmath79 gev@xmath77 for our standard parameter set . </S>",
    "<S> increasing @xmath7 to 200 mev makes @xmath80 gev@xmath77 , still below the preliminary na45 data . </S>",
    "<S> additional pair - producing processes not included here will increase the cross - section . also , one likely effect of a departure from chemical equilibrium in the hadronic phase is an excess of @xmath5 mesons , increasing the strength of the peak and thus accounting for some of the missing signal . </S>",
    "<S> the overall production rate is sensitive to @xmath11 : increasing @xmath11 from 120 to 140 mev while keeping @xmath81 mev gives @xmath82 gev@xmath77 ( @xmath83 mev with @xmath84 mev gives @xmath85 gev@xmath77 ) ; on the other hand , sensitivity to increasing @xmath66 or decreasing @xmath10 is minimal . omitting transverse expansion gives a value that is a factor of 2 - 3 too high . </S>",
    "<S> since the estimated error in the na45 data is of order 50% , we would not rule out any of the calculations except that with no transverse expansion .    </S>",
    "<S> partial restoration of chiral symmetry in hot and dense matter @xcite is expected to modify the masses and lifetimes ( widths ) of vector mesons . </S>",
    "<S> changes in the @xmath5-meson properties may indicate chiral restoration through modified @xmath0 production . however , there is no consensus at present on the behavior of the @xmath5 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> arguments based on qcd sum rules @xcite and effective lagrangians @xcite point to decreasing meson masses with increasing temperature and density , while vector - meson dominance studies @xcite and consistency arguments @xcite have been used to support the opposing view . for the time being , we therefore use the free mass and width of the resonances as a first approximation . </S>",
    "<S> the study of the effects of in - medium modifications on @xmath0 production from thermal resonances as a probe for chiral restoration is left for future work .    it is tempting to carry out a calculation without a transition to a high - energy phase in the present model </S>",
    "<S> . however , this would not be sensible with the massless pion gas approximation . </S>",
    "<S> the complete resonance spectrum would have to be taken into account and such an investigation is beyond the scope of the present paper .    </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that transverse expansion does not destroy the correlation suggested in ref.@xcite . if @xmath7 is close to the high end of the interval considered here ( @xmath86 mev ) and @xmath11 is not too low , we come close to reproducing the preliminary na45 data , so that the shape of the @xmath0 @xmath6 spectrum , as parametrized by @xmath58 , should make a good thermometer to measure @xmath7 in this region . </S>",
    "<S> if , however , @xmath87 mev or @xmath88 mev , the contribution from other ( potentially long - lived ) resonances appears to be significant , and therefore the usefulness of the @xmath5 meson as a thermometer in that region is questionable . </S>",
    "<S> the preliminary na45 data appear to rule out models in which transverse expansion plays no role , but otherwise place no significant constraints on the collision dynamics .    </S>",
