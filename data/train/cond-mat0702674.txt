    "there has recently been increasing interest , both experimentally  @xcite and theoretically  @xcite , in a @xmath1relativistic condensed - matter system , graphene which is a monolayer of graphite .",
    "graphene is a gapless planar semiconductor , in which low - energy electronic transport is essentially governed by massless dirac fermions with effective speed of light @xmath2 m / s @xmath3 , and thus provides a special opportunity to study relativistic quantum dynamics in condensed - matter systems .",
    "experiments have revealed a number of exotic transport properties of graphene , such as an unusual sequence  @xcite of magneto - oscillations and of the quantum hall ( qh ) effect , that are characteristic of dirac fermions .",
    "it has long been known that dirac electrons in 2 + 1 dimensions lead to peculiar quantum phenomena of fractional fermion number  @xcite : fractional charge and current of abnormal parity , as summarized by the chern - simons ( cs ) term , are induced in the vacuum in response to an applied field .",
    "the induced cs term , or a parity anomaly , is associated with a spectral asymmetry and an index of the dirac hamiltonian , and is also tied to the chiral anomaly in 1 + 1 dimensions  @xcite .",
    "the one - half degeneracy of the lowest landau level observed  @xcite in the graphene qh effect is a manifestation of fermion number fractionalization , although complete cancellation of the net vacuum charge and current takes place in graphene ( which involves a parity pair of fermions ) .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to explore possible signatures of relativistic quantum field theory in the low - energy physics of graphene .",
    "we study the electromagnetic response of graphene in a magnetic field at integer filling factor @xmath0 , with particular emphasis on the quantum features of the ground state with @xmath4 , the vacuum state . for graphene , unlike standard qh systems ,",
    "the vacuum state is a dielectric medium and carries an appreciable amount of both electric and magnetic susceptibilities @xmath5 over the entire range of wavelengths ; this reflects the presence of the @xmath1dirac sea. the dielectric effect grows rapidly with increasing filling factor @xmath0 in such a way that reflects the @xmath1relativistic landau - level characteristics of graphene as well as its valley and spin degeneracy .",
    "a close look into the dielectric function reveals that the coulomb interaction is efficiently screened on the scale of the magnetic length , leading to a prominent reduction of the exciton spectra in graphene .",
    "in addition , we construct , out of the response and via functional bosonization , a low - energy effective gauge theory of graphene in a magnetic field . it is pointed out thereby that the electric susceptibility @xmath6 is generally expressed as a ratio of the hall conductance to the landau gap .    in sec .",
    "ii we study the electromagnetic response of graphene in a magnetic field , with emphasis on projection to landau levels and regularization . in sec .",
    "iii we construct an effective theory of graphene . in sec .",

    "section  v is devoted to a summary and discussion .",
    "graphene has a honeycomb lattice which consists of two triangle sublattices of carbon atoms with one electron per site .",
    "the electrons are described by a two - component spinor @xmath7 with fields @xmath8 and @xmath9 residing on each sublattice . in the tight - binding approximation with nearest neighbor interactions",
    "the spectrum of electrons becomes linear at the two inequivalent fermi points ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) on the corners of the brillouin zone . in the continuum",

    "the su(2)-breaking zeeman coupling is considerably weak , compared with the coulomb interaction , for graphene and is ignored in the following .",
    "the coulomb interaction is written as @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the fourier transform of the electron number density @xmath37 ; @xmath38 is the fourier transform of the coulomb potential @xmath39 with the fine - structure constant @xmath40 and the substrate dielectric constant @xmath41 . in this paper",

    "filling one encounters intra - level ( collective ) excitations ,  @xcite which are less sensitive to long - wavelength probes and are determined by diagonalizing the coulomb hamiltonian @xmath48 projected to a given landau level .",
