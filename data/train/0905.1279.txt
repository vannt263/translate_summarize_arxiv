    "the increasing control of quantum systems that has been obtained in the last decades brings into reach the possibility of performing hitherto unprecedented tests of the principles of quantum mechanics @xcite . in particular , there is a growing interest in demonstrating non - classical behavior in systems or with respect to features that would be assigned to the classical realm according to our every - day experience .",
    "one exciting approach aims at luring mesoscopic mechanical oscillators into the quantum regime , see @xcite and refs therein .",
    "another approach focuses on the generation of highly non - classical states of continuous variables with direct classical correspondence , such as creating superpositions of macroscopically different phase space coordinates @xcite .",
    "the recent achievements in the generation and manipulation of ultracold atoms and molecules @xcite suggest to imprint non - classical features even on the free motion of material particles .",
    "for example , it has been proposed to perform the original einstein - podolsky - rosen thought experiment based on the dissociation of a molecular bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) @xcite .    in a recent article",
    "we go one step further by proposing to violate a bell inequality in the motional state of material particles using position measurements in the end @xcite .",
    "the two - particle state considered in this proposal can be characterized by its generation procedure .",
    "starting from a diatomic feshbach molecule , which is trapped in an optical dipole trap , a sequence of two short magnetic field pulses creates the superposition of two subsequent dissociations . due to momentum conservation",
    "the dissociated atoms propagate in opposite directions along some wave guide , with each atom delocalized into a pair of macroscopically separated , consecutive wave packets , corresponding to the early and the late dissociation instant , see fig .",
    "[ experimentalsetup ] .",
    "an observer can not tell whether the dissociation took place at the early or at the late instant , while both atoms must have started their journey at the same time . in this sense",
    ", the generated two - particle state may be called dissociation - time entangled ( dte ) .",
    "since each atom in a dte state is described by two spatially distinct propagating wave packets , which correspond to the early and the late dissociation times , the use of switched , asymmetric mach - zehnder interferometers can serve first to endow these wave packets with additional relative phases and then to rejoin them . in detail , the early wave packets propagate through the long arms of the interferometers , whereas the late ones are directed through the short arms , see fig .",
    "[ experimentalsetup ] c ) .",
    "if the detour of the early wave packets is chosen appropriately , they rejoin the late ones in the final beam splitters .",
    "provided the two dissociation processes are coherent in the sense that no information about the dissociation time has leaked to the environment , the rejoined wave packets may interfere . the joint probability for detecting the particles in the output ports of the two interferometers then exhibits a fringe pattern under variation of either path length difference , which is in principle capable of violating a bell inequality .",
    "we emphasize that the only relevant information required to extract these correlations is the output port combination where the atoms are detected .",
    "this information can be obtained by simple position measurements , without the need of a particular spatial or temporal resolution . and",
    "since the position measurements can be understood from a classical physicist s point of view , they are indeed in line with the above mentioned pursuit of focusing on features that have a classical analogoue .",
    "we note that a similar bell test procedure was first introduced for photons in @xcite .",
    "this led to the experimental demonstration of a bell inequality violation for parties separated by several kilometers , albeit using a postselection procedure required due to the lack of sufficiently good switches for photons .",
    "the implications for material particles , in particular the detrimental effect of dispersion , are discussed in detail in @xcite .    in this article",
    "we devise a concrete scenario to perform the described dte bell test , which is sufficiently detailed and realistic to suggest that violating a bell inequality should be possible within reach of present day technology .",
    "section [ experimentalscenario ] provides a detailed quantitative account of the proposed setup , based on realistic choices for the experimental parameters .",
    "it involves pulse separations on the order of seconds and implies atom velocities on the order of centimeters per second , as well as a truly macroscopic spatial separation of the single atom wave packets on the order of centimeters . in section [ dtestategeneration ]",
    "we discuss and numerically evaluate the two - particle superposition state that is generated in the wave guide in the course of a double dissociation with two square pulses .",
    "section [ dtebelltest ] demonstrates that this state , if exposed to the switched , asymmetric mach - zehnder processing , generates a fringe pattern which violates a bell inequality .",
    "finally , we conclude in section [ conclusions ] by pointing out the advantages of the proposed scheme .",
    "in the following we discuss quantitative details of a possible experimental setup that should be capable of generating a pair of dissociation - time entangled atoms and to violate a bell inequality in terms of single - particle interferometry and simple position measurements .",
    "we work at this example to prove the viability of the proposal presented in @xcite , but of course many alternative implementations are conceivable . we emphasize that the setup is designed to allow for time and length scales on the order of seconds and centimeters , establishing entanglement with respect to single - particle properties that are truly macroscopically distinct . in this section",
    "we focus on a consistent set of experimental parameters , deferring the theoretical analysis of the parts concerning the dissociation process to section [ dtestategeneration ] .",
    "we suggest to use a dilute molecular bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) produced from a 50:50 spin mixture of fermionic @xmath0 as a starting point .",
    "such a fermionic mixture seems favorable compared to bosonic ingredients , since huge lifetimes of more than @xmath1 can be achieved due to pauli blocking of detrimental 3-body collisions @xcite .",
    "this makes truly macroscopic time separations @xmath2 between the two dissociation pulses conceivable , and we choose @xmath3 in the following .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the molecular @xmath0 bec can be prepared efficiently and with near - perfect purity @xcite , and the comparatively small mass of lithium reconciles reasonable propagation velocities , on the order of @xmath4 , with resolvable de broglie wave lengths , on the order of @xmath5 .",

    "the guiding laser , which connects the two single - atom interferometers , serves as an atom guide which compensates the gravitational force .",
    "moreover , it must be chosen sufficiently strong that the transverse motion of the atoms remains frozen in the ground state . this way an effectively one - dimensional description of the atomic motion can be used .",
    "the following numerical values are chosen to be consistent with a pulse separation of @xmath3 and a relative velocity of @xmath7 .",
    "we assume that the guiding laser is given by a gaussian laser beam and operated at a power of @xmath8 with a ( center ) waist of @xmath9 , such that the optical dipole potential resulting from a molecular polarizability of @xmath10 has a ( center ) trap depth of @xmath11 .",
    "it thus is strong enough to compensate gravitation , supporting several thousand transversally bound states .",
    "the implied rayleigh length of about @xmath12 sets the scale for the extension of the whole setup .",
    "decoherence due to photon scattering can be estimated to occur at a rate on the order of @xmath13 , which limits the overall duration of a single experiment to remain below 20 s. the implied transverse trap frequency of @xmath14 , on the other hand , limits the maximum dissociation velocity not to exceed about @xmath15 , if we demand the transverse motion of the atoms to remain frozen in the ground state .",
    "the corresponding de broglie wave length @xmath16 , which sets the scale for the fringe separation , is in compliance with viable stability requirements for the interferometers .",
    "the second laser beam intersects the guiding laser perpendicularly , creating an elongated dipole trap for the bec within the laser guide . at the same time",
    ", it must be sufficiently shallow to be overcome with reasonable magnetic field pulses .",
    "moreover , the resulting longitudinal trap ground state @xmath17 , which is supposed to determine the center of mass state of the trapped molecules , must meet stringent conditions regarding its momentum spectrum .",
    "only a sufficiently narrow momentum spectrum guarantees that the dispersion - induced reduction of the non - local correlations due to the momentum spread in the center of mass motion admits the violation of a bell inequality @xcite .",
    "this demands a comparatively small trap frequency .",
    "specifically , for an atomic propagation velocity of @xmath18 , the trap frequency should not greatly exceed @xmath19 .",
    "a reasonable trap depth of @xmath20 combined with the required trap frequency of @xmath21 implies the trap laser ( center ) beam waist to be @xmath22 . by employing an elliptic gaussian laser beam with waist ratio @xmath23",
    ", the required laser power can be kept reasonably low , at @xmath24 .",
    "the corresponding photon scattering rate of @xmath25 , on the other hand , does not impose any limitations .",
    "the preparation is arranged such that only a small number of molecules , on the order of @xmath26 , remains in the bec at the end .",
    "these can be taken to be non - interacting , so that the initial longitudinal center of mass state of the molecules indeed is given by the trap laser ground state , parametrized by the trap frequency @xmath27 .",
    "a dte atom pair is extracted from the bec by applying a sequence of two short square pulses in the external magnetic field , as shown in fig .",
    "[ experimentalsetup ] b ) .",
    "the pulses must be chosen such that the desired dissociation velocity of @xmath15 is accomplished . to this end",
    "the pulses not only have to provide the corresponding kinetic energy but also the energy to overcome the longitudinal trap depth of @xmath28 .",
    "moreover , the generated state of the relative motion must meet similarly stringent conditions concerning its momentum spectrum as the trap laser ground state @xmath17 .",
    "the desired dissociation velocity of @xmath15 is obtained for a narrow , sufficiently isolated resonance with , e.g. , resonance width @xmath29 and @xmath30 , by applying a pulse duration of @xmath31 and a pulse height of @xmath32 .",
    "here , @xmath33 denotes the difference between the magnetic moments of the resonance state and the open channel , @xmath34 stands for the magnetic field base value before and after the pulses , and @xmath35 indicates the resonance position . in particular , the generated state meets the tight restrictions on the momentum distribution as imposed by dispersion . in section [ dtestategeneration ]",
    "we will analyze the momentum spectrum resulting from such a double pulse sequence and explicitly demonstrate its capability of violating a bell inequality .",
    "the dissociation probability per double pulse sequence depends , apart from the shape of the magnetic field pulses , on the resonance parameters @xmath36 and @xmath33 , on the guiding laser trapping frequency @xmath37 , and on the background channel scattering length @xmath38 . for a generic value of @xmath39 the dissociation",
    "probability amounts to a few percent .",
    "we thus rely on post - selection in order to guarantee that only one atom pair per shot enters the interferometers .",
    "this is however unproblematic , since the final fluorescence detection of the slow , strongly confined atoms can be done with single particle resolution , so that it is easy to disregard the cases of too many atom pairs in the process . for a start , we stick to this simple post - selection procedure ; in a more refined setup it is conceivable to use a specially prepared optical lattice where each site is occupied by at most one molecule @xcite .    after the completion of the dissociation sequence , and for our chosen time separation of @xmath3 between the early and the late dissociation pulse , the corresponding early and late wave packets of each particle propagate at a velocity of 5 mm / s , separated by a distance of 5 mm on each side .",
    "this constitutes a truly macroscopic delocalization of each atom . immediately after the dissociation process ,",
    "the widths of the early and late single - particle wave packets are on the order of about @xmath40 .",
    "their narrow momentum spectra guarantee that these wave packet extensions are not appreciably modified during the propagation to the interferometers if the propagation time does not exceed about @xmath1 .",
    "the early and late wave packets are thus spatially still sufficiently distinct when arriving at the interferometers for the switches to be applicable .",
    "the interferometers are implemented by two more red - detuned laser beams crossing the guide in a triangular arrangement at small angles , see fig .",
    "[ experimentalsetup ] .",
    "the path length differences must compensate the @xmath41 distance between the early and late wave packets of each particle .",
    "small variations of the path length differences on the order of the de broglie wave length @xmath42 result in a variation of the relative phase between the early and the late wave packets , as required for the bell test @xcite .",
    "the additional laser beams are switched on only after the early wave packets have passed the crossing points , but before the late ones arrive there .",
    "the crossings of the beams then act as beam splitters , while the required atom mirrors may be realized using evanescent light fields or blue - detuned laser beams perpendicular to the interferometer planes @xcite .",
    "such perpendicular blocking beams at the crossing point of the first beam splitters could also support the full deflection of the late wave packets into the short arms .",
    "this way , the early wave packets pass through the long arms , whereas the late wave packets are deflected into the short arms , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ experimentalsetup ] c ) .",
    "note that a simplified setup could do without the switching , replacing the switches by ordinary beam splitters , at the cost of 50% post - selection .",
    "resonant laser beams crossing the guiding lasers behind the final beam splitters , as sketched in fig .",
    "[ experimentalsetup ] a ) , effect fluorescence detection with near unit efficiency and with single particle resolution .",
    "no particular spatial or temporal resolution of the detection is required , since the only relevant information for the bell test is the combination of beam splitter output ports where the particles are detected .",
    "similar to the original bell test based on spins , the joint probability distribution for detecting the particles in particular output port combinations shows an interference pattern under variation of either path length difference , which can violate a bell inequality .",
    "decoherence due to photon scattering in the guiding laser beam sets the scale for the distance between the bec trap and the detection lasers to be on the order of 10 cm in our example .",
    "we proceed to derive the asymptotic form of the two - particle state that is generated by a double pulse sequence in the described setup , and we verify that it has the dte structure as described in section [ introduction ]",
    ". in particular , we will be able to specify the corresponding momentum spectrum , which plays a crucial role for the feasibility of the bell test .",
    "below in section [ dtebelltest ] we will use this result to demonstrate explicitly that the experimental scenario presented above yields a dte state which can violate a bell inequality in spite of wave packet dispersion .",
    "a two - channel single - resonance calculation shows that after an arbitrary magnetic field pulse sequence ( close to an isolated resonance ) the dissociated part of the state , @xmath43 , is described , for low energies , at positions far from the dissociation center , and at large times , by the asymptotic form @xmath44 here @xmath45 denotes the free ( two - particle ) propagator in the longitudinal direction , while the transverse motion is frozen in the harmonic ground state , @xmath46 and @xmath47 , resp .",

    "the feasibility of this procedure requires the early and the late wave packets not to overlap before arriving at the first , switchable mirror . if this condition is met by the dte state ( [ dtestate ] ) the joint probability for detecting a pair of counterpropagating atoms in a particular output port combination labeled by @xmath96 , @xmath97 ( @xmath98 ) follows from    @xmath99 , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    as shown in @xcite .",

    "[ dtefringepattern ] .",
    "specifically , we choose @xmath107 and @xmath108 , where @xmath109 defines the optimum overlap path length difference cancelling the separation between the early and the late wave packets .",
    "the variation of @xmath104 or combinations of @xmath103 and @xmath104 would of course yield similar fringe patterns .",
    "the ( constant ) relative phase @xmath110 is neglected since it only results in a phase shift of the fringe pattern , while the upper and lower envelope remain unaffected .    inspecting fig .",
    "[ dtefringepattern ] , we can identify several generic features of the dte fringe pattern .",
    "first , the characteristic length for its period is set by the de broglie wave length of the relative motion @xmath111 .",
    "this is natural , since we implement the relative phase shift by displacing the early and late wave packets with respect to each other , while the phase variation of a propagating wave packet is set by its de broglie wave length . in our case",
    ", we get @xmath42 .",
    "this means that , in order to be able to detect the fringe pattern , the interferometers have to be kept stable by about @xmath112 .",
    "the envelope size of the fringe pattern , on the other hand , can be traced back to the unavoidable offset from the optimum wave packet overlap when varying the path length differences .",
    "one expects no interference if there is no overlap in the beam splitter output ports , resulting in the uncorrelated probability distribution of @xmath113 per output port combination .",
    "indeed , the width of the fringe pattern , which is of about @xmath40 , matches approximately the initial position spread of the single - particle wave packets .",
    "minor modifications to this can be traced back to the dispersion - induced distortion between the early and the late wave packets .",
    "however , the overall visibility reduction , which prevents the fringe pattern to vary with its maximum amplitude of @xmath114 even in the case of optimum overlap , is a genuine effect of the dispersion - induced distortion between the early and the late wave packets .",
    "if the early and late wave packets were identical up to displacement , the visibility should not be affected , independently of their shape @xcite .",
    "it is mainly this criterion which decides whether a single pulse momentum distribution is sufficiently well - behaved or not .",
    "indeed , the joint detection probability ( [ detectionprobability ] ) can be evaluated analytically in the case of a gaussian momentum distribution , revealing that the overall visibility is sensitive to the center - of - mass and relative motion momentum spreads @xmath115 and @xmath116 @xcite .",
    "only if these are sufficiently small with respect to the relative momentum @xmath87 , the resulting fringe pattern can exceed the visibility threshold @xmath117 as required for violating a bell inequality . in our case , the momentum spreads are characterized by @xmath80 and @xmath118 , yielding a momentum distribution that is sufficiently well peaked to be capable of violating a bell inequality , as can be seen in the lower plot in fig .",
    "[ dtefringepattern ] .",
    "we emphasize that the potential violation sustains over a sufficient number of fringes to be resolvable in experiment .",
    "another viable approach to attain the expected fringe pattern as determined by a given ( sufficiently well - behaved ) momentum distribution is to fit it with a gaussian .",
    "this permits to apply above mentioned analytic result , as was done in @xcite .",
    "however , for spectra of the form ( [ singlepulsespectrum ] ) such a least square fit has the tendency to slightly overestimate the accessible visibility .",
    "a more conservative procedure than least square fitting would define the fit as an upper envelope of the corresponding momentum distribution .",
    "we note that the second momenta of the momentum distribution resulting from ( [ singlepulsespectrum ] ) are not useful for characterizing the widths of the peaks , while the gaussian fitting procedure yields a comparatively good approximation in our context .",
    "a final remark should be made on the relative phase @xmath110 between the early and late state component . as can be seen in ( [ detectionprobability ] )",
    ", it also enters the joint detection probability and hence influences the fringe pattern .",
    "it was neglected in our numerical investigation since it only effects a phase shift of the fringe pattern .",
    "of course , this assumes that @xmath110 remains constant from shot to shot , while an uncontrolled variation of @xmath110 already on the order of @xmath119 would spoil the fringe pattern . in our feshbach calculation",
    "@xmath110 is determined by @xmath120 / \\hbar + \\omega_{\\text{g } }     \\tau .\\ ] ] hence , we have to require that the magnetic field pulses can be kept stable and are reproducible from shot to shot with a relative accuracy of @xmath121 .",
    "we described an experimental scenario for the generation of a pair of dissociation - time entangled atoms and the subsequent interferometric bell test . assuming viable experimental conditions , the generated state of two counterpropagating atoms was shown to be capable of violating a bell inequality .",
    "the experiment is based on the feshbach - induced dissociation of a diatomic molecule , where the entanglement of the dissociating atoms is achieved by applying a sequence of two magnetic field pulses .",
    "hence , no complicated manipulation of the molecular state is required , the only experimental demand is to keep the molecules trapped in a controlled way and to carry out the magnetic field pulses with sufficient accuracy .",
    "the atom guides and the required switched , asymmetric mach - zehnder interferometers are implemented by laser beams . since only single - particle interference has to be performed , the interferometers on the opposite sides do not have to be kept stable with respect to each other .",
    "this allows to reach macroscopic distances between the two measurement devices , in our scenario on the order of 10 centimeters .",
    "the procedure is completed by position measurements that only have to be able to distinguish the chosen beam splitter output port for each atom .",
    "this does not require prominent spatial and temporal resolution and is conveniently accomplished by resonant laser beams .",
    "the violation of a bell inequality on the basis of dissociation - time entanglement would be the manifestation of non - classicality in the _ motional _ state of two _ material _ particles , without resorting to internal degrees of freedom like spin . here",
    "not only the two atoms are separated on a scale of several centimeters , but also the early and the late wave packets are separated by a distance of @xmath122 on each side .",
    "such a superposition of two consecutively propagating wave packets for each atom , which would be established in this experiment , constitutes a macroscopic violation of the classical particle concept of localization and therefore presents a worthwhile feature of its own ."

    "<S> , we discuss in detail the requirements for a specific experimental implementation , which is based on the feshbach dissociation of a molecular bose - einstein condensate of fermionic lithium . </S>",
    "<S> a sequence of two magnetic field pulses serves to delocalize both of the dissociation products into a superposition of consecutive wave packets , which are separated by a macroscopic distance . </S>",
    "<S> this allows to address them separately in a switched mach - zehnder configuration , permitting to conduct a bell experiment with simple position measurements . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze the expected form of the two - particle wave function in a concrete experimental setup that uses lasers as atom guides . assuming viable experimental parameters the setup is shown to be capable of violating a bell inequality . </S>"
