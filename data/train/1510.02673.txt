    "the heavy - ion collision can be divided into several successive processes including formation of quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) and hadronization , etc .",
    "some of such processes are believed to exist shortly after the big bang and explain the interior of compact stellar objects . on the other hand ,",
    "the experimental devices are exclusively designed to detect hadrons , leptons and electromagnetically interacting particles .",
    "thus , quarks and gluons ca nt directly be detected and therefore properties such as viscosity of qgp still represent a great challenge for the particle scientists . the nonnegligible elliptic flow measured at the relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) and recently at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) is a striking observation referring to the fact that the viscosity property turns to be measurable in the heavy - ion collision experiments , on one hand and the hydrodynamic response of produced matter to the initial geometry leads to such particle production asymmetry , on the other hand .",
    "most of the experimental signals revealing the qgp formation and the elliptic flow , for instance , strengthen with increasing the collision centrality .",
    "furthermore , the peripheral collisions introduce remarkable effects , as well .",
    "the local imbalance in the momentum that carried by the colliding nucleons generates a nonvanishing local angular - momentum @xcite and the relativistic motion of the spectator nucleons generates currents of net positive charge moving off - center ( opposite to each other ) . both types of nuclear collisions generate a huge magnetic field @xcite , @xmath0 .    in quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) , phenomena such as magnetic catalysis in which the magnetic field dynamically generates masses , and meissner effect where the magnetic field changes the order of the phase transition in type - i superconductor from second to first are examples on the possible influence of such large magnetic field on the phase - transitions in quantum choromodynamics ( qcd ) and/or the properties of the hadronic and partonic matter .",
