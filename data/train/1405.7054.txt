    "results of radial velocity surveys demonstrate that @xmath5 of exoplanets reside in stellar binaries ( desidera & barbieri 2007 ) . while most of these binaries have wide separation between stellar components ( hundreds of au ) , some of them are systems with relatively short binary periods of @xmath6 yr .",
    "one of the best examples of such a binary is @xmath2 cephei ( hatzes 2003 ) , which consists of two stars of mass @xmath7 and @xmath8 with semi - major axis of @xmath9 au ( orbital period @xmath10 yr ) and eccentricity @xmath11 .",
    "the planet with the projected mass @xmath12 is in orbit around the primary with semi - major axis @xmath13au .",
    "several more planetary systems within tight ( @xmath14 au ) binaries are known at present ( chauvin 2011 ) , including the terrestrial planet around our stellar neighbor @xmath1 cen ( dumusque 2012 ; cf . hatzes 2013 ) .",
    "for a long time theorists struggled to explain the origin of planets in such systems of s - type in classification of dvorak ( 1982 ) .",
    "the issue lies in the strong dynamical excitation that any object in a binary is subject to .",
    "gravitational perturbations due to the eccentric companion are expected to adversely affect planet formation already at the stage of _ planetesimal growth_. as first shown by heppenheimer ( 1978 ) companion perturbations drive planetesimal eccentricities to high values , easily approaching @xmath15 at 2 au from the primary .",
    "planetesimals would then be colliding at relative speeds of a couple km s@xmath16 , which is much higher than the escape speed from the surface of even a @xmath17 km object ( about 100 m s@xmath16 ) . as a result",
    ", collisions should lead to planetesimal _ destruction _ rather than growth .",
    "a number of possibilities have been explored to at least alleviate this problem .",
    "in particular , marzari & scholl ( 2000 ) , studied the dissipative effects of _ gas drag _ as the means of damping relative velocities of planetesimals .",
    "these authors have shown that for a circular disk in secular approximation gas drag induces an _ alignment _ of planetesimal orbits such that the periapses of small objects strongly affected by gas drag tend to cluster around @xmath18 with respect to the binary apsidal line .",
    "this was originally thought ( marzari & scholl 2000 ; thbault 2004 ) to assist planetesimal agglomeration since the relative velocities of colliding bodies are reduced by such orbital phasing .",
    "however , it was subsequently recognized ( thbault 2008 ) that the reduction of the relative velocity caused by apsidal alignment is effective only for planetesimals of similar sizes .",
    "objects of different sizes still collide at high speeds , which complicates their growth .",
    "these studies have generally arrived to the same conclusion  difficulty of planetesimal accretion  despite the different ways in which the gas disk and its interaction with planetesimals was treated . while the early calculations ( thbault 2004 , 2006 , 2008 , 2009 ; thbault 2011 ) typically assumed disk properties to be described by some ( semi-)analytic axisymmetric models , recently several studies followed properties and evolution of gas disks in binaries using direct hydrodynamical simulations ( paardekooper 2008 ; kley 2008 ; marzari 2009 ; regly 2011 ; mller & kley 2012 ; marzari 2012 ; picogna & marzari 2013 ) .",
    "one of the most important aspects of the disk physics that the latter allow capturing is the _ development of non - axisymmetry _ in the surface density distribution of the gaseous disk .",
    "it emerges under the gravitational perturbation of the binary companion , predominantly in the form of non - zero eccentricity of the fluid trajectories ( marzari 2012 ) .",
    "another phenomenon is the _ disk precession _",
    ", with sometimes develops in simulations with subsequent effect on planetesimal dynamics .",
    "an entirely different way of lowering planetesimal eccentricities in binaries has been pursued by rafikov ( 2013a , hereafter r13 ) , who demonstrated that planetesimal eccentricities can be considerably lower than previously thought by properly accounting for the gravity of a massive _ axisymmetric _ gaseous disk in which planetesimals form .",
    "the non - keplerian potential of the disk drives rapid precession of planetesimal orbits , suppressing driving of their eccentricity by the companion .",
    "note that massive protoplanetary disks must have been quite natural in @xmath2 cep - like systems since all of the known systems ( with the exception of @xmath1 cen ) harbor jupiter - like planets with @xmath19 ( chauvin 2011 ) .",
    "it is natural to expect the parent disk mass to exceed the planet mass by at least a factor of several ( this number is very uncertain but is believed to be @xmath20 for the minimum mass solar nebula ) making an assumption of a @xmath21 disk not unreasonable .",
    "this is even despite the fact that sub - mm surveys find very low fluxes of thermal dust emission in young binaries with semi - major axes of several tens of au ( harris 2012 ) .",
    "as discussed above , the assumption of a purely axisymmetric disk may be too simplistic since simulations indicate that protoplanetary disks in binaries often develop significant eccentricities . to that effect silsbee & rafikov ( 2013 ,",
    "hereafter sr13 ) presented the first investigation of secular excitation of planetesimal eccentricities by simultaneous action of the gravitational perturbations due to both the _ eccentric _ gaseous disk and the companion star .",
    "they showed that the non - axisymmetric gravitational field of such a disk excites planetesimal eccentricity ( in addition to the excitation produced by the companion ) and usually does not allow it to drop below the disk eccentricity , which may be rather high as suggested by some simulations ( okazaki 2002 ; paardekooper 2008 ; kley & nelson 2008 ) .",
    "this would again suppress planetesimal growth .",
    "on the other hand , sr13 outlined several ways in which this issue can be alleviated , for example if the gaseous disk is precessing rapidly or if its own self - gravity is capable of reducing disk eccentricity to low levels . at the same time , sr13 did not include gas drag in their calculations , eliminating the possibility of planetesimal apsidal alignment and their eccentricity damping by drag .",
    "our current work builds upon the results of previous studies by exploring planetesimal dynamics in disks coplanar with the binary under the _ combined effects _ of ( 1 ) gravitational perturbations due to the eccentric gaseous disk in which planetesimals are embedded , ( 2 ) gravity of eccentric companion , and ( 3 ) gas drag .",
    "while we do not model disks in binaries using hydrodynamical simulations , we still capture their main features , namely their non - axisymmetry and the possibility of precession .",
    "our results are then used in a companion paper ( rafikov & silsbee 2014 , in preparation ; hereafter paper ii ) to explore the details of planet formation in binaries .",
    "we thereby extend the existing semi - analytical studies in which the disk is treated as axisymmetric with only gas drag ( and not disk gravity ) accounted for ( thbault 2004 , 2006 , 2008 , 2009 ) .",
    "we also go beyond the works of r13 and sr13 in which gas drag was neglected and only the gravitational effects of the gaseous disk and binary companion were considered . in addition , we extend the study of beaug ( 2010 ) devoted to exploring planetesimal dynamics in eccentric , precessing disks by accounting for the gravitational potential of such a disk .",

    "finally , some of our analytical derivations use the local approximation for treating elliptical motion , which is reviewed in appendix [ sect : local ] .",
    "our general setup is similar to that explored in sr13 .",
    "we consider an elliptical disk around a primary star in a binary with semi - major axis @xmath22 , eccentricity @xmath23 , and component masses @xmath24 ( primary ) and @xmath25 ( secondary ) .",
    "we define @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "binary , disk , and planetesimal orbits within it are assumed to be _",
    "this distinguishes our work from many other studies focused on the effects of lidov - kozai oscillations ( lidov 1962 ; kozai 1962 ) on planetesimal dynamics in systems with inclined companions ( marzari 2009 ; batygin 2011 ; zhao 2012 ) .",
    "non - axisymmetric disk structure is described via the non - zero disk eccentricity , which is a viable approximation given that simulations tend to show the prevalence of @xmath28 azimuthal harmonic of the disk shape distortion ( marzari 2012 ) .",
    "fluid elements in a disk follow elliptical trajectories with eccentricity @xmath29 which is a function of the semi - major axis @xmath30 of a particular ellipse .",

    "we assume all fluid elliptical trajectories to have _ aligned _ apsidal lines , uniquely determining disk orientation via a single parameter @xmath31  the angle between the disk and binary apsidal lines .",
    "the latter is assumed to be fixed in space as the precession of the binary under the gravity of the disk is slower than all other processes .",
    "the assumption of apsidal alignment does not affect the qualitative features of planetesimal dynamics and can be easily relaxed using the results of statler ( 2001 ) .    because gas moves on ellipses its surface density generally varies along the trajectory ( statler 2001 ; ogilvie 2001 ) . to obtain gas surface density @xmath32 at a point in a disk with polar",

    "we also assume @xmath55 as well as @xmath56 and introduce for convenience the planetesimal eccentricity vector @xmath57 .    in this work we fully account for gravitational perturbations due to both the binary companion and the eccentric disk using the approach advanced in sr13 . for the disk properties described by equation ( [ eq : sigma0 ] )",
    "sr13 calculated an analytic expression for the planetesimal disturbing function accounting for the gravity of both disk and secondary .",
    "they then derived a set of lagrange equations [ see their equations ( 16)-(17 ) ] describing the evolution of @xmath3 under the influence of gravitational forces alone .",

    "drag - induced dissipation also results in non - conservation of energy and evolution of @xmath52 .",

    "this approach is often used in studies of planetesimal and galactic dynamics ( binney & tremaine 2008 ) and forms a basis of the so - called hill approximation ( hnon & petit 1986 ; hasegawa & nakazawa 1990 ) .",

    "first , there is a critical size of order @xmath130 , around @xmath265 km , at which maps exhibit a `` waist '' , in which @xmath251 is small for collisions of equal size bodies .",
    "second , @xmath251 becomes small for encounters between both the small bodies , with @xmath266 , and for large objects with @xmath267 .",
    "third , @xmath251 saturates at a value roughly independent of @xmath232 or @xmath233 for collisions of particles with very different sizes , i.e. when @xmath268 , and vice versa .    these gross features , as well as the variations of the overall velocity scale seen in these maps ,",
    "are addressed below using the results of  [ sect : ecc_evol ] .",
    "given that particles can be in different drag regimes  strong or weak  we will consider several possibilities separately .      when both planetesimals are in strong drag regime , @xmath269 , both @xmath270 and @xmath271",
    ". then equation ( [ eq : erel ] ) predicts that e_12^ss & & e_c||a_d,1|- |a_d,2|| [ eq : ss_er ] + & & e_c|()^1/2- ( ) ^1/2| .",
    "[ eq : ss_er1 ] where we used equation ( [ eq : atd_s ] ) to express @xmath133 in terms of planetesimal sizes . since @xmath272 in the strong drag limit",
    ", one finds that @xmath273 , which explains low values of @xmath96 in the lower left corner in maps in figure [ fig : e_r_map ] .",
    "physically , in this regime relative velocity of two planetesimals is considerably lower than their individual velocities because of the apsidal alignment of their orbits by gas drag , see marzari & scholl ( 2000 ) ) and similar magnitudes of @xmath3 .      when both planetesimals are in the weak drag regime @xmath274 and @xmath275 , one finds using equation ( [ eq : erel ] ) that e_12^ww & & e_c||a_d,1|^-1- ( a_d,2|^-1| [ eq : ww_er ] + & & e_c|- | .",
    "[ eq : ww_er1 ] where equation ( [ eq : atd_w ] ) has been used . since @xmath276 in the weak drag limit , one again finds that @xmath277 , explaining the low relative eccentricity in the upper right corner in maps in figure [ fig : e_r_map ] .    in this case",
    "apsidal alignment is again at work , lowering @xmath96 compared to @xmath278 .",
    "however , now it is caused by the disk+binary gravity , which affects planetesimals in the same way when they are weakly coupled to gas .",
    "this is because the gas damps the free eccentricity , but is not strong enough to significantly change the forced eccentricity .",
    "when one of the planetesimals ( e.g. of size @xmath232 ) is in the strong drag regime , @xmath270 , while the other is in the weak drag regime , @xmath275 , equation ( [ eq : erel ] ) shows that their relative eccentricity @xmath251 is just e_12^swe_c .",
    "[ eq : sw_er ] one can see that @xmath251 is roughly independent of the sizes of particles participating in an encounter .",
    "the overall scale of @xmath251 in each of the maps shown in figure [ fig : e_r_map ] is characterized by @xmath251 in one of the high - velocity corners .",
    "according to  [ sect : weak_strong ] this scale is just @xmath131 , which allows us to use the results of  [ sect : pl_dyn ] to understand how the typical @xmath251 varies as we change the disk parameters . note that in comparison of panels ( a ) and ( b ) of figure [ fig : e_r_map ] shows that disk mass @xmath178 plays an important role in setting @xmath279 : planetesimals in low mass disks ( @xmath280 )",
    "collide with much higher speeds than in higher mass ( @xmath281 ) disk .",
    "this is because for the chosen value of @xmath282 the low mass disk is in the bb regime and the value of @xmath283 is high , see figure [ fig : e_c_map]a .",
    "increasing @xmath178 as in panel ( a ) brings the disk in the dd regime and also close to the valley of stability .",
    "for that reason , in higher mass disk with @xmath284 one gets much lower @xmath285 .",
    "lowering @xmath39 for a high mass disk as in panel ( c ) reduces relative velocity scale even more , simply because for @xmath286 the system gets even deeper into the valley of stability , where the corresponding @xmath287 , see figure [ fig : e_c_map]a .",
    "comparison of panels ( a ) and ( d ) shows that changing disk orientation also strongly affects @xmath96 : there is no valley of stability in the misaligned disk and characteristic eccentricity scale becomes @xmath288 . as a result ,",
    "particles in a mis - aligned disk collide at higher speeds than in the aligned disk .",
    "our work extends and complements existing results on planetesimal dynamics in binaries in several important ways .",
    "first , for the first time , our solutions for @xmath3 in  [ sect : ecc_evol ] _ simultaneously _ account for a number of key physical ingredients needed for a complete description of secular dynamics of planetesimals in binaries : gravity of both eccentric disk and eccentric companion as well as the gas drag , which causes orbital phasing of planetesimals and reduces their relative eccentricity in certain regimes .",
    "second , we provide a rigorous derivation of the equations of eccentricity evolution due to gas drag ( [ eq : kdrag])-([eq : tau_d ] ) in an _ eccentric _ disk .",
    "previously , adachi ( 1976 ) derived analogous equations for the case of a circular disk , while beaug ( 2010 ) proposed a set of empirical equations similar to ( [ eq : kdrag])-([eq : hdrag ] ) but without proper calculation of the constant pre - factors .",
    "third , we derive an analytic expression ( [ eq : dfdv2 ] ) for the relative velocity distribution function @xmath234 for locally homogeneous populations of objects with fixed eccentricity vectors , which is appropriate in the limit @xmath289 in the presence of gas drag .",
    "we also provide an in - depth analysis of @xmath251 behavior for objects of different sizes in systems with different parameters (  [ sect : char_vel ] ) .",
    "previously the distribution of planetesimal encounter velocities has been explored only numerically , by following a large number of trace particles in simulations of different kinds ( thbault 2006 , 2008 , 2009 ; paardekooper 2008 ; fragner 2011 ) .",
    "thus , our derivation of @xmath290 represents an important analytical step in understanding planetesimal dynamics .",
    "we now provide a more detailed comparison of our results with previous studies and discuss the limitations of this work .",
    "lcc binary companion only & 2,3 & 4,5,6,8,9,10 +   + axisymmetric disk & 7 & 1 + and binary companion & & +   + non - axisymmetric disk & 8 & 1 + and binary companion & & + [ table ]      the main novelty of our study is the extension of the line of analytical investigation of disk gravity effects , started in r13 and sr13 for axisymmetric and non - axisymmetric disks , respectively , by including gas drag .",
    "previous ( semi-)analytical studies of planetesimal dynamics in binaries neglected the gravitational effect of the disk .",
    "our calculations account for both the precession of planetesimal orbits due to the axisymmetric part of the disk potential and the eccentricity excitation due to its non - axisymmetric component .",
    "disk non - axisymmetry is modeled via its nonzero eccentricity , i.e. @xmath28 distortion , which can be a function of radius .",
    "we expect this approximation to capture the key effect of the disk asymmetry , as higher-@xmath291 distortions of the disk shape are relatively small ( marzari 2012 ) .    in table",
    "[ table ] we summarize some ( this list is not exhaustive ) existing ( semi-)analytical treatments of planetesimal dynamics ( including this work ) , classified according to the physical ingredients that are taken into account .",
    "we primarily focus on studies of secular effects to put our work in proper context .",
    "our current results cover _ all dynamical regimes _ listed in this table in appropriate limits . the majority of previous studies considered planetesimal dynamics in the presence of gas drag , with _ only the direct binary _ gravitational perturbations taken into account ( marzari & scholl 2000 ; thbault 2004 , 2006 , 2008 , 2009 ; paardekooper 2008 ) .",
    "as shown in sr13 this approximation is unwarranted as long as the disk mass @xmath196 since then the disk potential dominates gravitational perturbation .",
    "we also provide full analytical solutions for test particle dynamics in a general precessing or non - precessing disk without companion perturbation , see equations ( [ eq : e_r_pr])-([eq : d_1_pr ] ) . previously , beaug ( 2010 ) studied this regime for a precessing disk but did not account for the gravitational effect of the disk ( i.e. only gas drag was taken into account ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : dif_dyn_approx ] we illustrate the differences in various descriptions of planetesimal dynamics .",
    "it shows relative eccentricity as a function of planetesimal sizes @xmath232 and @xmath233 at 1 au in an aligned disk of @xmath292 and @xmath192 around a primary of @xmath2 cephei in four different limits . panel ( a ) presents a full calculation with all physical ingredients ( gas drag , gravity of both the eccentric disk and the binary companion ) accounted for using the solutions obtained in  [ sect : ecc_evol ] .    in panel ( b )",
    "we show how things change if disk gravity is completely switched off by setting @xmath121  an approximation common to a number of previous studies ( marzari & scholl 2000 ; thbault 2004 , 2006 , 2008 , 2009 ; paardekooper 2008 ; beaug 2010 ) .",
    "one can see that without disk gravity relative planetesimal velocities go up by a factor of several .",
    "moreover , the `` waist '' between the two high-@xmath251 regions in panel ( b ) is narrowest at @xmath293 km , which is considerably larger than in panel ( a ) where this happens for @xmath294 km objects .",
    "this difference is in complete agreement with equations ( [ eq : d_c_b ] ) and ( [ eq : d_c_d ] ) .    in panel ( c )",
    "we account for the gravitational effect of a non - axisymmetric disk but neglect gas drag ( @xmath162 ) , i.e. use equations ( [ eq : e_n_drag_decompose])-([eq : e_forced_d ] ) , as was done in sr13 . in the absence of gas drag",
    "there is no apsidal alignment of planetesimal orbits and they approach each other at random phases . also , @xmath96 is independent of @xmath232 and @xmath233 ( the size - dependent drag is absent ) explaining uniform color in figure [ fig : dif_dyn_approx]c .",
    "absence of gas drag results in rather high relative velocities of planetesimals making their survival in collisions problematic .",
    "thus , apsidal alignment of planetesimal orbits and eccentricity suppression due to gas drag are very important for the proper description of their dynamics .",
    "finally , in panel ( d ) we retain only the axisymmetric component of the disk potential neglecting the eccentricity excitation by the disk , i.e. @xmath295 but @xmath296 . in this limit , also neglecting gas drag ( accounted for here ) r13 predicted dramatic lowering of @xmath3 . comparison with panel ( a )",
    "clearly shows this not to be the case when gas drag included , which can be understood by noticing that @xmath131 in equation ( [ eq : e_c ] ) can significantly deviate from @xmath297 because of @xmath298 contribution .",
    "this is why lowering @xmath297 by setting @xmath295 and increasing @xmath226 does not necessarily result in smaller @xmath131 , as expected in r13 .    to summarize , simultaneously accounting for all the physical processes affecting planetesimals  gas drag , disk and secondary gravity",
    " is very important for understanding planetesimal growth .",
    "omission of even a single physical ingredient can significantly affect the conclusions drawn from the dynamical calculations .",
    "previously kley & nelson ( 2007 ) and fragner ( 2011 ) numerically explored planetesimal dynamics in gaseous disks , which were evolved using direct hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "they accounted for the effect of disk gravity on planetesimal motion and at least some of their calculations assumed coplanarity of the disk and the binary .",
    "however , even though the setup of these studies is very similar to that of our present work , some subtle differences prevent direct comparison of their results . in particular",
    ", when estimating the relative velocities of planetesimals based on their orbit crossing kley & nelson ( 2007 ) do not take into account the apsidal phasing of their orbits ( marzari & scholl 2000 ) , clearly obvious in their fig .",
    "10 . as a result",
    "they find very high relative speeds even between equal - size planetesimals , which we believe is an artefact of their neglect of apsidal phasing .",
    "fragner ( 2011 ) study the case of a _ circular _ binary ,",
    "in which apsidal phasing is naturally absent , resulting in high relative speeds of planetesimals . as a result , the applicability of calculations using circular binaries to understanding planetesimal dynamics in eccentric systems like @xmath2 cep is not obvious .",
    "finally , we discuss limitations of our study . some of them have to do with the adoption of secular , i.e. orbit - averaged , approximation .",
    "while averaging over the planetesimal orbit is justified because @xmath299 is always much shorter than other periodicities ( e.g. of planetesimal apsidal precession ) , when averaging over the longer binary period one may overlook important dynamical features of the systems possessing very massive disks .",
    "indeed , equation ( [ eq : a_d ] ) suggests that for @xmath300 planetesimal precession rate @xmath301 becomes comparable to the binary angular frequency  @xmath302 yr@xmath16 for @xmath2 cephei . in these conditions averaging over the latter",
    "is not justified and new effects , such as the possibility of evection resonance ( touma & wisdom 1998 ) inside the disk , may additionally affect planetesimal dynamics .",
    "other effects omitted in our study , such as the density waves or higher-@xmath291 contributions to the azimuthal mass distribution in the disk , short - term fluctuations of the disk potential , may also affect planetesimal dynamics . they may account for some of the difference between the results of this work , which uses secular , time - averaged description of the disk and binary potential , and direct numerical studies of kley & nelson ( 2007 ) and fragner ( 2011 ) .",
    "planetesimal eccentricity can be additionally excited by the stochastic gravitational perturbations due to the turbulence in the disk .",
    "this issue has been previously investigated for disks around single stars ( ida 2008 ; yang 2009 , 2012 ) and for circumbinary disks ( meschiari 2012 ) .",
    "coplanarity of the disk and the binary orbit is another restriction , that can be easily eliminated in future studies .",
    "we believe that small but non - zero inclination ( xie & zhou 2009 ) would not affect our solutions for the behavior of planetesimal eccentricity .",
    "however , as shown in xie ( 2010 ) , such non - zero inclination has strong effect on planetesimal collision rates .",
    "there is also room for improvement within the framework of our model .",
    "some approximations that we adopt such as the power law behavior of @xmath303 and @xmath304 , constant can be used to describe disks with density waves . ]",
    "@xmath305 are dictated by our desire to obtain analytical solutions using the results of sr13 whenever possible .",
    "also , we did not investigate the conditions under which our model ( [ eq : sigma0 ] ) represents a steady - state solution for a fluid disk perturbed by a companion ( statler 2001 ) .",
    "more refined semi - analytical or numerical calculations using improved disk models are certainly desirable but are unlikely to seriously affect our results and conclusions .",
    "we studied secular dynamics of planetesimals and explored prospects for planet formation around one of the components of an eccentric binary .",
    "we believe that our study includes most , if not all , of the important physical ingredients relevant for this problem  perturbations due to the binary , gas drag , and gravitational effects of an eccentric disk .",
    "this is the first time planetesimal dynamics in binaries have been studied analytically in such generality .",
    "the analytical nature of our solutions for planetesimal dynamical variables allowed us to explore their dependence on system parameters in great detail .",
    "our main results can be summarized as follows :    * we find that under the action of gas drag as well as the gravitational effects of the binary companion _ and the eccentric disk _ , planetesimal eccentricity vector @xmath3 converges to a constant value depending on the planetesimal size and the disk and binary properties .",
    "we obtained complete analytical solutions for @xmath3 in the case of non - precessing disk and analyzed them in detail , extending results of previous studies .",
    "* we showed that relative particle - gas ( equation ( [ eq : e_r_d ] ) ) and particle - particle velocities can be expressed as simple functions of only two key parameters  the characteristic eccentricity @xmath131 and planetesimal size @xmath306 in units of characteristic size @xmath130 , given by equations ( [ eq : e_c ] ) and ( [ eq : d_1 ] ) .",
    "behavior of these variables has been explored in detail in  [ sect : pl_dyn ] .",
    "* we show that in massive disks containing enough gas to form giant planets ( @xmath196 ) planetesimal dynamics is always in the regime when _ apsidal precession of planetesimal orbits is dominated by disk gravity _ , i.e. in the db or dd regimes in classification of sr13 .",
    "significantly eccentric ( @xmath307 ) disks also dominate eccentricity excitation of planetesimals by their gravity ( dd regime ) .",
    "this emphasizes the key role of the disk gravity in relation to planet formation in binaries .",
    "* we derive the explicit form of the relative velocity distribution between the populations of planetesimals with different sizes and show that it depends only on the relative eccentricity @xmath251 of the approaching objects . * in disks aligned with the binary planetesimals collide with lower velocities than in mis - aligned disks .",
    "thus , planetesimal growth favors disk - binary apsidal alignment .",
    "* we also present analytical results for the dynamics of planetesimals in precessing disks in certain limits .",
    "our results will be used in paper ii to understand planet formation in small separation binaries , such as @xmath2 cep and @xmath1 cen .",
    "they can also be used to understand the circumbinary planet formation .",
