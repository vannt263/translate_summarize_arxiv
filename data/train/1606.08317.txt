    "@xmath0 ( @xmath7 ) , known as the lightest charmonium state , can provide a very good laboratory for the study of the quarkonium production mechanism . however , in contrast to the copious data on the @xmath8 yield , the observation of the @xmath0 meson is scant .",
    "this is basically because the @xmath8 can be detected via its leptonic decay channels , while the fragments of the @xmath0 decays are dominated by multiple hadrons  @xcite , both the observation and reconstruction of which are more difficult .",
    "a novel approach to the measurement of the various charmonium states using their common decay channel to @xmath9 was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , which shed light on the investigation of the @xmath0 and @xmath10 mesons . by exploiting this approach ,",
    "lhcb collaboration  @xcite achieved their first study on the inclusive and prompt @xmath0 yield in @xmath11 collisions .",
    "they found that the @xmath0 hadroproduction cross section is even larger than that of the @xmath8 in the same experimental condition . on the theory side , qcd leading order ( lo ) calculation of the @xmath0 hadroproduction within the nonrelativistic qcd ( nrqcd )  @xcite was accomplished in refs .",
    "@xcite , following which the complete qcd next - to - leading order ( nlo ) studies came out in a few weeks  @xcite .",
    "@xcite considered the lhcb data on @xmath0 hadroproduction as the challenge to nrqcd , while refs .",
    "@xcite found these data did not bring in any inconsistency .",
    "@xcite further argued that this measurement actually provided an excellent opportunity for fixing the @xmath0 ( as well as the @xmath8 ) wave function at the origin , and can also help with the determination of the colour - octet ( co ) long - distance matrix elements ( ldmes ) for the @xmath8 production . as was pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , only two degrees of freedom of the three @xmath8 co ldmes can be fixed by the @xmath8 yield data .",
    "@xmath0 data helped to fix the last one , @xmath12})\\rangle$ ] . having this parameter fixed , ref .",
    "@xcite discovered some interesting features of the @xmath8 hadroproduction and polarization , which provided a possibility for the solution to the long - standing @xmath8 polarization puzzle .",
    "in fact , as early as 17 years ago , @xmath0 photo- and leptoproduction as a heuristic probe to the co mechanism has already been proposed  @xcite . in these processes , the colour - siglet ( cs ) channel is suppressed by an order of @xmath13 compared to the @xmath4}$ ] channel , which , on the one hand , provided an opportunity to test the co mechanism , on the other hand , could help to fix the @xmath4}$ ] ldme for @xmath0 production . unfortunately ,",
    "due to lack of data , this device has never been put into implementation .",
    "similar to the @xmath0 photo- and leptoproduction , @xmath0 production in @xmath1 annihilation also has these good features .",
    "this process becomes more important since the b - factories raised up their luminosity to the order of @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "two super b - factories  @xcite are proposed to reach even higher luminosities , on the order of @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) . a few years running of these machines",
    "can accumulate adequate data for a precision measurement of the @xmath0 production , which , as will be shown later , can provide the most distinct test of nrqcd .",
    "for the @xmath0 production , up to @xmath18 , one cs state ( @xmath19}$ ] ) and three co states ( @xmath4}$ ] , @xmath20}$ ] and @xmath5}$ ] ) are involved . at the b - factory energy , charge parity",
    "is approximately conserved .",
    "the cs state can only be produced with at least three gluons emitted .",
    "this process is of order @xmath21 .",
    "however , @xmath4}$ ] state can be produced with only one gluon emitted , which is of order @xmath22 , two orders lower than the cs one in @xmath23 .",
    "we can expect the co processes be more significant than the cs one .",
    "thus the measurement can definitely distinguish the two mechanisms .",
    "another interesting feature of this process is that , in constrast to the @xmath0 hadroproduction case in which the @xmath20}$ ] channel dominate the production , @xmath0 production in @xmath1 annihilation is dominated by the @xmath4}$ ] and @xmath5}$ ] channels .",
    "the ldmes for these channels are related to the @xmath20}$ ] and @xmath24}$ ] ldmes for the @xmath8 production by the heavy quark spin symmetry ( hqss ) .",
    "since the determination of the @xmath8 ldmes is still facing controversy  @xcite , this process can help to clarify this issue .",
    "the last but not the least important thing to mention : the measurement of the @xmath0 production at b - factories might provide some useful information for the study of the process @xmath25 , which was measured by babar  @xcite and belle  @xcite collaborations .",
    "the theoretical studies of these experiments are presented in refs .",
    "@xcite , which found that the cs results of the total cross sections generally saturate the most recent belle measurement  @xcite , and the inclusion of the co contributions would ruin the agreement between the theory and experiment . in spite of this , the angular distribution  @xcite , within the cs mechanism , for the production of the @xmath8 in association with either light hadrons or charmed hadrons is in conflict with the data given in the same experiment paper . ref .",
    "@xcite suggested that the cs ldme for the @xmath8 production might be smaller than the ordinarily used values obtained in potential - model calculations  @xcite , which left room for the co mechanism .",
    "the smaller cs ldme and the inclusion of the co contributions can provide opportunities for the understanding of the angular distribution puzzle .",
    "however , the results given by employing the ldmes in ref .",
    "@xcite exceed the belle measurement of the production of the @xmath8 plus light hadrons .",
    "this problem is still waiting for further investigation .",
    "actually , many factors can cause this discrepancy .",
    "for example , the @xmath13 corrections are always significant  @xcite , thus the universality of the ldmes at qcd nlo can not take the responsibility of testing nrqcd . before we can achieve the high - order calculations , @xmath0 production at b factories can serve as an alternative test of the co mechanism .",
    "since this process is dominated by the @xmath4}$ ] and @xmath5}$ ] channels , the measurement can , on the one hand , distinguish the cs and co contributions , on the other hand , specify whether the theoretical results for the @xmath26})$ ] production in @xmath1 annihilation reach a good convergence up to qcd nlo .    in this paper , we study the @xmath0 associated production with light hadrons at b - factory energy within the nrqcd framework , which can provide references for the future experiment at the super b - factories .",
    "the rest of this paper is organised as follows . in section",
    "ii , we briefly describe the framework of our calculation .",
    "section iii presents the numerical results and discussions , while we come to our conclusions in section iv .",
    "in the nrqcd factorization framework , up to @xmath18 , four intermediate @xmath27 states , including one cs state ( @xmath19}$ ] ) and three co states ( @xmath4}$ ] , @xmath20}$ ] and @xmath5}$ ] ) , are involved in the @xmath0 production .",
    "the cross section for the @xmath0 production in association with light hadrons in @xmath1 collisions can thus be expressed as d(e^+e^-_c+x)=_nd(e^+e^-c|c(n)+x)o^_c(n ) , [ eqn : nrqcdfac ] where @xmath28 runs over the four intermediate states , @xmath29 are the corresponding short - distance coefficients ( sdcs ) , and @xmath30 denotes light hadrons , the hadronization process of which are not concerned in our calculation .",
    "thus , we simply evaluate the processes in which @xmath30 are partons ( gluons and/or light quarks ) .",
    "the charge parity of the cs state , @xmath19}$ ] , is @xmath31 . since the charge parity is conserved in strong and electroweak interactions , this state can be produced with at least three gluons emitted .",
    "however , the lo processes for @xmath4}$ ] , @xmath20}$ ] and @xmath5}$ ] productions involve only one , two and two emitted gluons , respectively .",
    "this results in the fact that the cs contribution are greatly suppressed compared with the co one . in this paper",
    ", we consider the cs contribution at lo ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "there is only one process at this order , namely e^+e^-c|c(^1s_0^[1])+g+g+g , [ eqn : cs ] where @xmath32 denotes a gluon .",
    "the co processes are evaluated up to the order @xmath33 , which is , for both the @xmath20}$ ] and @xmath5}$ ] channels , lo , while for the @xmath4}$ ] channel , nlo in @xmath23 .",
    "the processes involved are & & e^+e^-c|c(^1s_0^[8])+g , [ eqn:1s08lo ] + & & v : e^+e^-c|c(^1s_0^[8])+g , [ eqn:1s08v ] + & & e^+e^-c|c(^1s_0^[8])+g+g , [ eqn:1s08gr ] + & & e^+e^-c|c(^1s_0^[8])+q+|q , [ eqn:1s08qr ] + & & e^+e^-c|c(^3s_1^[8])+g+g , [ eqn:3s18 g ] + & & e^+e^-c|c(^3s_1^[8])+q+|q [ eqn:3s18q ] + & & e^+e^-c|c(^1p_1^[8])+g+g , [ eqn:1p18 ] where @xmath34 and @xmath35 represent light quark and antiquark , respectively , and the label @xmath36 means one - loop - level virtual correction to the process on the right - hand side of it . summing over the processes in eq.([eqn:1s08v ] ) , eq.([eqn:1s08gr ] ) and eq.([eqn:1s08qr ] ) , the cross section for the @xmath0 production via the @xmath4}$ ] channel at qcd nlo will be free of divergence , while those for the processes listed in eq.([eqn : cs ] ) , eq.([eqn:1s08lo ] ) , eq.([eqn:3s18 g ] ) and eq.([eqn:3s18q ] ) are nonsigular in theirselves . however , the process in eq.([eqn:1p18 ] ) is divergent .",
    "this divergence can be cancelled within the nrqcd framework by including the qcd corrections to the @xmath4}$ ] ldme .",
    "summing the two contributions stated above , we can redefine the @xmath5}$ ] sdc as a finite quantity .",
    "the detail of this procedure can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite , so , we just omit these discussions in the current paper , and purloin the useful equations in the references . one important feature necessary for our discussion",
    "is that the sdc for the @xmath5}$ ] channel can be decomposed in two parts ( e^+e^-c|c(^1p_1^[8])+g+g)=_foml -()(e^+e^-c|c(^1s_0^[8])+g ) , where @xmath37 is completely free of @xmath38 , the nrqcd factorisation scale",
    ".    then we rewrite eq.([eqn : nrqcdfac ] ) , up to the order we maintain in our calculation , in an explicit form as d(_c)&=&d(^1s_0^[1])o^_c(^1s_0^[1])+d(^3s_1^[8])o^_c(^3s_1^[8])+d_fomlo^_c(^1p_1^[8 ] ) + & -&()d_lo(^1s_0^[8])o^_c(^1p_1^[8])+d(^1s_0^[8])o^_c(^1s_0^[8 ] ) , [ eqn : dsigma ] where we have abbreviated the sdcs @xmath39 as @xmath40 .",

    "the global choice of the parameters are listed as follows : the qed and qcd coupling constants are @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively .",
    "the colliding energy is fixed at @xmath44 , which corresponds to the b - factory and super b - factory experiments . at this energy ,",
    "the diagrams involving a @xmath45-boson propagator are greatly suppressed .",

    "we are also interested in the significance of the qcd corrections , thus we assign the lo results a distinct name , @xmath48})$ ] .",
