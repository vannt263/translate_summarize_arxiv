    "inflation  @xcite ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review of its status ) is now one of the cornerstones of the standard cosmological model . in its simplest",
    "form , inflation has very definite predictions : the existence of adiabatic initial scalar perturbations and gravitational waves , both with gaussian statistics and an almost scale invariant power spectrum  @xcite .",
    "various extensions , which in general involve more fields , allow e.g. for isocurvature perturbations  @xcite , non - gaussianity  @xcite , and modulated fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "all these features let us hope that future data will shed some light on the details ( and physics ) of this primordial phase of the universe .",
    "almost the entire literature on inflation assumes that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic while homogeneity and isotropy are what inflation is supposed to explain .",
    "indeed , the dynamics of anisotropic inflationary universes has been widely discussed  @xcite .",
    "it was demonstrated that under a large variety of conditions , inflation occurs even if the spacetime is initially anisotropic  @xcite , regardless of whether it is dominated by a pure cosmological constant or a slow - rolling scalar field .",
    "the isotropization of the universe was even generalized to bianchi braneworld models  @xcite recently .",
    "it should be emphasized , however , that a deviation from isotropy  @xcite or flatness  @xcite may have a strong effect on the dynamics of inflation , and in particular on the number of @xmath1-folds .",
    "+ the study of the perturbations during the isotropization phase has been overlooked , mainly because in the past decades one was mostly focused on large field inflationary models , which generically give very long inflationary phases .",
    "this was also backed up by the ideas of chaotic inflation and eternal inflation  @xcite . in such cases , it is thus an excellent approximation to describe the universe by a friedmann - lematre ( fl ) spacetime when focusing on the modes observable today since they exited the hubble radius approximatly in the last 60 @xmath1-folds . in this case ,",
    "the origin of the density perturbations is understood as the amplification of vacuum quantum fluctuations of the inflaton .",
    "in particular , the degrees of freedom that should be quantized deep in the inflationary phase , and known as the mukhanov - sasaki variables  @xcite , were identified  @xcite , which completely fixes the initial conditions and makes inflation a very predictive theory .    in the context of string theory , constructing a string compactification whose low energy effective lagrangian is able to produce inflation is challenging ( see ref .",
    "in particular , it has proved to be difficult to build large field models  @xcite ( in which the inflaton moves over large distances compared to the planck scale in field space ) .",
    "this has led to the idea that , in this framework , an inflationary phase with a small number of @xmath1-folds is favored ( see however ref .",
    "if so , the predictions of inflation are expected to be sensitive to the initial conditions , and in particular the classical inhomogeneities are not expected to be exponentially suppressed , which makes the search for large scale deviations from homogeneity and isotropy much more motivated , as well as the possibility that the inflaton has not reached the inflationary attractor .",
    "more important , it is far from obvious ( as we shall discuss in details later ) that all observable modes can be assumed to be in their bunch - davies vacuum initially , and more puzzling , that for a given mode modulus the possibility of setting the initial conditions will depend on its direction .",
    "if so , then the initial conditions for these modes would have to be set in the stringy phase , an open issue at the time .",
    "the theory of cosmological perturbations in a bianchi universe was roughed out in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also ref .  @xcite and ref .",
    "@xcite for the case of higher - dimensional kaluza - klein models and ref .",
    "@xcite for the quantization of test fields and particle production in an anisotropic spacetime ) .",
    "recently , we performed a full analysis of the cosmological perturbations in an arbitrary bianchi  @xmath0 universe  @xcite .",
    "it was soon followed by an analysis  @xcite that focused on bianchi  @xmath0 universe with a planar symmetry . as we shall see in this work , the case of a planar symmetric spacetime",
    "is not generic ( both for the dynamics of the background and the evolution of the perturbations ) .",
    "+ from a more observationally oriented perspective , the primordial anisotropy can imprint a preferred direction in the primordial power spectra .",
    "this could be related to the possible large scale statistical anomalies  @xcite of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies .",
    "many possible explanations have been proposed , including foregrounds  @xcite , non - trivial spatial topology  @xcite ( which implies a violation of global isotropy  @xcite ) , the breakdown of local isotropy due to multiple scalar fields  @xcite , the presence of spinors  @xcite or dynamical vectors @xcite , the effect of the spatial gradient of the inflaton  @xcite or a late time violation of isotropy  @xcite . in the case of universes with planar symmetry ,",
    "the signatures on the cmb were derived by many authors  @xcite . in this case , a large primordial shear is indeed necessary , which is not in contradiction with the constraints obtained from the cmb  @xcite or from the big - bang nucleosynthesis  @xcite .",
    "this brings a secondary motivation to our analysis : can the cmb anisotropy be related to an anisotropic primordial phase or , on the other hand , can it constrain the primordial shear and what are the exact predictions of a primordial anisotropic phase ? + this is however not our primary motivation . in the first place , we are interested in understanding the genericity of the predictions of inflation , and in particular with respect to the symmetries of the background spacetime .",
    "as we shall see , the simple extension considered in this article drives a lot of questions , concerning both the initial conditions in inflation and , more generally , quantum field theory in curved spacetime .    in this article",
    ", we build on our previous work  @xcite to investigate the dynamics and predictions of one field inflation starting from a generic bianchi  @xmath0 universe .",
    "after discussing the dynamics of the background in ",
    "[ sec1 ] , we focus on the evolution of the perturbations in   [ sec2 ] . in particular , we will need to understand the procedure for the quantization during inflation . as we shall see in  ",
    "[ sec2.2 ] , this procedure deviates from the one standardly used in a friedmann - lematre spacetime , and even in a planar symmetric spacetime as discussed in ref .",
    "the main reason for such an extension lies in the fact that there always exist modes that were not in a wkb regime during the shear - dominated inflationary era .",
    "it follows that , while our procedure leads to similar predictions to the standard one on small scales , it appears that there is a lack of predictibility on large scales .",
    "indeed , we do not want to push our description beyond the planck or string scale where extensions of general relativity have to be considered .",
    "this may give a description of both the early phase of the inflationary era and also a procedure to fix the initial conditions without any ambiguity . in ",
    "[ sec3 ] , we explicitly compute the primordial spectra , for both scalar modes and gravity waves .",
    "we will describe in details the effect of the anisotropy and show how the isotropic predictions are recovered on small scales .",
    "we first set our notations in   [ sec1.1 ] and describe the dynamics of the background , focusing on its general solutions in    [ sec1.2 ] .",
    "we then turn to the slow - roll regime and to the case of a massive free field , that we shall use as our working example , respectively in   [ sec1.3 ] and    [ sec1.4 ] .",
    "bianchi spacetimes  @xcite are spatially homogeneous and those of type  @xmath0 have euclidean hypersurfaces of homogeneity . in comoving coordinates , and using cosmic time , their metric takes the general form @xmath2 which includes three _ a priori _ different scale factors .",
    "it includes the friedmann - lematre spacetimes as a subcase when the three scale factors are equal , and the extensively studied planar symmetric universes when only two of the three scale factors are different .",
    "the average scale factor , defined by @xmath3^{1/3}\\,,\\ ] ] characterises the volume expansion of the universe .",
    "the metric  ( [ metric1 ] ) can then be recast under the equivalent form @xmath4 where the `` spatial metric '' , @xmath5 , is the metric on constant time hypersurfaces .",
    "it can be decomposed as @xmath6\\delta_{ij}\\,,\\ ] ] where the functions @xmath7 must satisfy the constraint @xmath8    let us introduce some useful definitions .",
    "first , we consider the scale factors @xmath9 they are associated to the following hubble parameters @xmath10 which are trivially related by @xmath11 where the dot refers to a derivative with respect to physical time .",
    "we define the shear as @xmath12 and introduce the scalar shear by @xmath13 ( see appendix  a of ref .",
    "@xcite to see the relation with the shear usually defined in the @xmath14 formalism . ) to finish , we define the conformal time by @xmath15 , in terms of which the metric  ( [ metric2 ] ) is recast as @xmath16.\\ ] ] we define the comoving hubble parameter by @xmath17 , where a prime refers to a derivative with respect to the conformal time .",
    "the shear tensor , now defined as @xmath18 is clearly related to @xmath19 by @xmath20 so that @xmath21 is explicitly given by @xmath22 and is related to its cosmic time analogous by @xmath23 .        in cosmic time , assuming a general fluid as matter source with stress - energy tensor @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the energy density , @xmath26 the isotropic pressure and @xmath27 the anisotropic stress ( @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) , the einstein equations take the form @xmath30 and the conservation equation for the matter reads @xmath31 where the @xmath32-component of @xmath27 has been defined as @xmath33 ( so that @xmath34 ) .",

    "@xcite in the study of some trans - planckian models in which the wkb regime is violated .    on the other hand , and probably in a more conservative way",
    ", one could just assume their initial value to be completely random and introduce a free function to describe the initial conditions on large scales .",
    "such a function would then need to be measured from e.g. large angular scale properties of the cmb or predicted by some processes that arise at the planck or string scale , and that indeed can not be accounted for in our description .    in the former case , we loose the predictive power on large scales , that actually may just be beyond the actual size of the observable universe .",
    "it may seem that we are back to the ( historical ) pre - inflationary times , where the form of the initial power spectrum of the harrison - zeldovich type had to be postulated in order to reproduce the observations of the large - scale structures .",
    "this is somehow a very standard approach in physics in which one learns about the initial conditions of a system by observing its evolution    inflationary theories allowed to actually predict this spectrum , which makes them very predictive .",

    "we thus expect the transitional tachyonic behaviour and our ignorance of the initial state of the perturbations before the wkb regime not to significantly alter the validity of our prescription for the initial conditions of quantum origin set during the wkb regime . + from a practical point of view , we can estimate the effect of the coupling functions @xmath378 and @xmath320 by changing their amplitude by hand .",
    "we have checked that they hardly affect the predictions that are presented in the following section . in particular , that teaches us that the main directional dependence of the power spectra is induced mainly by the directional dependence of the comoving wavenumbers ( see fig .",

    "we have also checked that when @xmath379 increases our prediction is similar to the one obtained in standard inflation .",
    "+ in conclusion , we can trust our prescription for modes larger than @xmath271 and we have to assume ( somehow as an observational input ) that @xmath380 .",
    "this sets a tuning on the primordial shear that we can not explain with the model at hand . in this regime",
    ", we have checked that it is a robust prescription that is not affected by the unknown preexisting perturbations that are completely arbitrary and that fixes the properties of the long wavelength modes .",
    "to set the initial conditions as previously detailed , we need to first solve numerically the system  ( [ b1:v]-[b1:mu ] ) . because of the couplings , each of the three variables , @xmath256 and @xmath381 , will have components along the three independent stochastic directions , even if they were initially independent .",
    "for instance , @xmath382 and @xmath383 and we deduce from the properties of the random variables that @xmath384 the power spectrum of the curvature perturbation at the end of inflation ( once the shear has decayed away ) is thus @xmath385 it can be checked , as expected , that for super - hubble modes , @xmath386 is conserved once the shear is negligible .",
    "we thus perform our numerical integration in a time interval long enough so that the universe has been isotropized and all the observable modes have become super - hubble .",
    "the power spectra of the gravity waves are defined analogously by @xmath387    at the beginning of the radiation era , the background spacetime can be described by a friedmann - lematre solution and the primordial anisotropy is now encoded on the statistical properties of the perturbations on large scales .",

    "so that these initial conditions can be set unambiguously while still having an imprint of the cmb anisotropy , we presented the imprint of the primordial anisotropy in the power spectra of the gravity waves and curvature perturbation at the end of inflation .",

    ", there exists an early shear - dominated phase where the wkb approximation is violated .",
    "this forbids us to set the initial conditions as in a friedmann - lematre universe .",
    "as we showed , the sub - hubble modes at the onset of the accelerating phase can be quantized because quantum fluctuations act at all times and can always source oscillatory solutions , when they exist . on the other hand , there always exist non - oscillating modes .",
    "these modes are expected not to be much smaller than the hubble radius today ( since there is no trivial imprint of the anisotropy on the cmb ) .",
    "this implies that there exists a cut - off scale above which we can not predict the spectra from first principles , at least in the theoretical set - up we are considering .",
    "consequently , we conclude that above this scale we can only measure the power spectra or postulate their functional form , as was actually done to set the initial conditions before the invention of inflation .",
    "we have shown that even if unknown pre - wkb initial conditions can grow , this growth is at most of order unity .",
    "therefore we can safely assume that the perturbations at the end of inflation reflect only those modes that have been seeded during the wkb regime .",
    "second , for these modes , one can not assume that they are independent .",
    "it implies that we have to consider 3 interacting fields , which also complicates the quantization procedure .",

    "this could introduce an early chaotic phase  @xcite since bianchi  @xmath0 models coupled to @xmath426-form fields have never ending oscillatory behaviour exhibited by generic string theory .",
    "examples of an early dynamics have also been given in terms of kalb - ramond axion fields  @xcite , non - commutative geometry  @xcite and recently loop quantum gravity  @xcite .",
    "any of these developments may give a description of both the early phase and a procedure to fix the initial conditions .",
    "+ coming back to inflation , our study demonstrates to which extent its predictions are sensitive to initial ( classical ) large scale anisotropies and that in the presence of a non - vanishing shear , it is impossible to define a bunch - davies vacuum in the standard way ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for a discussion of this issue in the standard picture and the arbitrariness on the choice of the initial state and its influence of the prediction of inflation ) . indeed ,",
    "if we tune the initial conditions such that the number of @xmath1-folds is large , none of the problems we address here will affect the observable modes , simply because only modes such that @xmath427 are observable and we have shown that in this limit we recover the standard inflationary predictions .",
    "if this is the case , one would have no observational imprint of the primordial shear .",
    "but our analysis and conclusions may be of some relevance for inflationary model building in the framework of string theory if the feeling that no large field model ( and thus no large number of @xmath1-folds ) can be constructed persists , an issue far beyond the scope of this article .",
    "our analysis also shows the importance ( and peculiarity ) of the friedmann - lematre background in our theoretical predictions and on the quantization procedure , and it gives as well an explicit construction of the difficulties encountered when these symmetries do not exist .",

    "this method relies on the fact that the solutions of the system ( [ background_sigma]-[background_sigma3 ] ) are , in a general sense , given by @xmath448 as a function of time .    instead of solving ( [ background_sigma]-[background_sigma3 ] )",
    "after having extracted the components of the shear at a fixed initial time , we can determine the dynamics of the shear components through the dynamics of the basis vectors , the polarisation tensor and the shear .",

    "<S> this article investigates the predictions of an inflationary phase starting from a homogeneous and anisotropic universe of the bianchi  @xmath0 type . after discussing the evolution of the background spacetime , focusing on the number of @xmath1-folds and the isotropization </S>",
    "<S> , we solve the perturbation equations and predict the power spectra of the curvature perturbations and gravity waves at the end of inflation .    </S>",
    "<S> the main features of the early anisotropic phase is ( 1 ) a dependence of the spectra on the direction of the modes , ( 2 ) a coupling between curvature perturbations and gravity waves , and ( 3 ) the fact that the two gravity waves polarisations do not share the same spectrum on large scales . </S>",
    "<S> all these effects are significant only on large scales and die out on small scales where isotropy is recovered . </S>",
    "<S> they depend on a characteristic scale that can , but a priori must not , be tuned to some observable scale .    to fix the initial conditions , we propose a procedure that generalises the one standardly used in inflation but that takes into account the fact that the wkb regime is violated at early times when the shear dominates . </S>",
    "<S> we stress that there exist modes that do not satisfy the wkb condition during the shear - dominated regime and for which the amplitude at the end of inflation depends on unknown initial conditions . on such scales </S>",
    "<S> , inflation loses its predictability .    </S>",
    "<S> this study paves the way to the determination of the cosmological signature of a primordial shear , whatever the bianchi  @xmath0 spacetime . </S>",
    "<S> it thus stresses the importance of the wkb regime to draw inflationary predictions and demonstrates that when the number of @xmath1-folds is large enough , the predictions converge toward those of inflation in a friedmann - lematre spacetime but that they are less robust in the case of an inflationary era with a small number of @xmath1-folds . </S>"
