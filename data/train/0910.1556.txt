    "the production of heavy gauge boson pairs ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 ) has been observed in fully leptonic final states at the fermilab tevatron collider @xcite .",
    "evidence for diboson decays into an @xmath10 final state , with @xmath11 and @xmath12 , was recently presented by the d0 collaboration @xcite .",
    "the analysis presented here is the first conclusive observation at a hadron collider of diboson production with one boson decaying into leptons and the other into hadrons @xcite",
    ".    measurements of the diboson production cross sections provide tests of the self - interactions of the gauge bosons , and deviations from sm predictions could indicate new physics @xcite .",
    "diboson production involving hadronic decays is also topologically similar to associated higgs boson production , @xmath13 , when the higgs boson decays to @xmath14 , the most promising discovery channel for a low - mass higgs boson .",
    "thus the analysis techniques described here will also be useful for higgs boson searches .",
    "the cdf ii detector is described in detail in ref .",
    "surrounding the beam pipe is a tracking system consisting of a silicon microstrip detector , a cylindrical drift chamber , and a solenoid producing a 1.4 t magnetic field along the beam axis .",
    "the central and forward calorimeters surround the tracking system with a projective tower geometry .",
    "the calorimeters are composed of inner electromagnetic and outer hadronic sections that consist of lead - scintillator and iron - scintillator respectively .",
    "a system of cerenkov counters , located around the beam pipe and inside the forward calorimeters , measures the number of inelastic @xmath3 collisions per bunch crossing and thus the luminosity @xcite .",
    "the geometry of the detector is characterized by the azimuthal angle @xmath15 and the pseudorapidity @xmath16 $ ] , where @xmath17 is the polar angle measured from the proton beam direction .",
    "the transverse energy @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the energy in the calorimeter towers associated with a cluster of energy deposition .",
    "transverse momentum @xmath20 is the track momentum component transverse to the beam - line .",
    "the missing transverse energy vector @xmath21 is defined as @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the transverse component of the unit vector pointing from the interaction point to the energy deposition in calorimeter tower @xmath24 .",
    "this is corrected for the @xmath20 of muons , which do not deposit all of their energy in the calorimeter , and tracks which point to uninstrumented regions in the calorimeter .",
    "the missing transverse energy @xmath25 is defined as @xmath26 .",
    "strongly interacting partons undergo fragmentation that results in highly collimated jets of hadronic particles .",
    "jet candidates are reconstructed in the calorimeter using the jetclu cone algorithm @xcite with a cone radius of 0.4 in ( @xmath27 ) space .",
    "the energy measured by the calorimeter must be corrected to improve the estimated energy  @xcite .",
    "the effects corrected for include the non - linear response of the calorimeter to particle energy , the loss of energy in uninstrumented regions of the detector , and the energy radiated outside of the jet cone .",
    "events are selected which have large @xmath25 and exactly two jets whose invariant mass can be reconstructed .",
    "this signature is sensitive to both @xmath10 and @xmath28 decays because a charged lepton is not explicitly required in the final state . due to the limited dijet mass resolution",
    ", there is significant overlap between the @xmath29 and @xmath30 dijet mass peaks .",
    "therefore we consider as signal the combination of three diboson signals ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 ) , and search for diboson production in the dijet mass range @xmath31 gev@xmath32 .",
    "events are selected using a set of @xmath25-based triggers with a variety of @xmath25 and jet requirements .",
    "all of these triggers have benefited significantly from a calorimeter trigger upgrade completed in 2007 @xcite . the majority ( 94% ) of events",
    "satisfy the inclusive @xmath25 trigger which requires @xmath33 gev .",
    "we require events to have @xmath34 gev and exactly two jets with @xmath35 gev and @xmath36 , which ensures a trigger efficiency of @xmath37 on signal as measured in @xmath38 events .",
    "additionally , the fraction of the total jet energy which is in the electromagnetic calorimeter is required to be less than 90% to eliminate the possibility that electrons and photons are reconstructed as jets .",
    "several criteria suppress contamination from non - collision backgrounds .",
    "events are required to have at least one reconstructed vertex formed by charged particle tracks to remove cosmic - ray events . to reduce beam - related backgrounds ,",
    "the electromagnetic fraction of the total event energy must be greater than 30% .",
    "additionally , the arrival time of the jets as measured by the electromagnetic shower timing system @xcite must be consistent with the @xmath3 collision time .",
    "after all selection criteria are made , non - collision backgrounds are a negligible contribution to the sample ( fewer than 90 events out of the total 44,910 selected events ) .    in order to suppress the multijet background described in sec .",

    "less significant ewk backgrounds include @xmath50+jets , top - quark pair production , and single top - quark production .",

    "modeling of the backgrounds is described in more detail in the following sections .",
    "the electroweak ( ewk ) processes considered to be backgrounds to this measurement are the @xmath51+jet and top - quark production processes .",
    "the @xmath48+jets processes are simulated by the fixed - order matrix element generator alpgen @xcite interfaced with pythia to simulate parton showering and fragmentation , the underlying event , and additional @xmath3 interactions in the event .",
    "the @xmath52+jets and top - quark production are simulated by pythia .",
    "the expected yields of all monte carlo - simulated background processes are normalized to sm cross sections calculated at next - to - leading order , although the overall normalization of this background is allowed to float in the final fit to data .",
    "the multijet background ( mjb ) does not typically result in signatures of large @xmath25 .",
    "however , when jet energy is not measured accurately an event may be reconstructed with large fake @xmath25 and thus pass the event selection . due to the large rate of mjb production , this is still a significant background .",

    "a region dominated by mjb is isolated in the data .",
    "a missing transverse momentum vector @xmath53 , analogous to the calorimeter - based @xmath21 , is constructed from the vector sum of the transverse momenta of all particles measured in the tracking system . for @xmath25 arising from neutrinos",
    ", the @xmath53 and @xmath21 will usually be closely aligned and the azimuthal angle @xmath54 between them will be small .",
    "the @xmath53 is largely uncorrelated to the @xmath21 in events where jet energies have not been measured accurately ; thus the mjb is expected to be the dominant contribution at large values of @xmath54 .",
    "the distribution of @xmath54 for events satisfying the selection criteria is shown in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "the ewk monte carlo is normalized to the data in the peak region of @xmath55 , where the mjb contribution is negligible .",
    "additional corrections to the monte carlo are made based on comparisons of @xmath38 monte carlo to @xmath38 events in data . because muons are minimum ionizing particles which deposit little energy in the calorimeter , from calorimeter activity @xmath38 events appear to have real @xmath25 .",

    "subtracting the corrected ewk monte carlo from the data in the @xmath56 region gives an estimate of the remaining mjb in the signal sample .",
    "we now determine the shape of the mjb in any variable of interest using events in the @xmath56 region , with the ewk contribution subtracted .",
    "the shapes of the derived mjb distributions are also verified with a high - statistics dijet pythia monte carlo sample .",
    "the systematic uncertainties associated with this data - driven method of determining the mjb contribution come primarily from potential differences between the mjb contribution in the @xmath57 and @xmath56 regions . to estimate the size of these uncertainties , we compare distributions in these regions in the dijet monte carlo sample .",
    "the normalization must also be scaled up to account for mjb contamination in the region @xmath57 , and an uncertainty of 20% is applied to the total mjb yield .",
    "the analysis proceeds via a fit of the signal and background contributions to the dijet mass @xmath58 distribution .",
    "the signal extraction is performed with an unbinned maximum likelihood fit using the roofit program @xcite .",
    "three @xmath58 template distributions are used in the fit .",
    "the first is the signal shape .",
    "this template is obtained from a gaussian plus polynomial fit to the signal monte carlo @xmath58 distribution , which is a combination of the @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 @xmath58 distributions weighted by the predicted sm cross sections . the mean and width of the gaussian",
    "are linearly dependent on the jet energy scale ( jes ) , which is constrained to be in the range allowed by external measurements @xcite .",
    "the second template is the ewk shape , a combination of the @xmath58 distributions for all backgrounds taken from monte carlo as described in sec .",
    "[ sec : ewk ] .",
    "the third is the mjb template , which is determined by forming the @xmath58 distribution in events with @xmath56 as described in sec .",
    "[ sec : mjb ] .",
    "the mjb @xmath58 distribution is modeled by an exponential which is used as the template in the fit . based on studies with the dijet pythia monte carlo sample ,",
    "a 20% uncertainty is taken on the slope of the exponential to account for uncertainties on the shape of the mjb contribution .    in the fit to data , the jes , the mjb normalization , and the slope of the mjb exponential enter as gaussian constraints , allowed to float within the predetermined uncertainties .",
    "the yield of signal and ewk background events are floating in the fit with no constraints .",
    "we address separately two classes of systematic sources , those that affect the signal extraction and those that affect the signal acceptance in the cross section calculation .",
    "the signal extraction systematic uncertainties come from uncertainties on the shapes of the signal and background templates .",
    "these shape uncertainties include effects of the jet energy resolution ( jer ) , the jet energy scale ( jes ) , and the uncertainties on the shapes of the mjb and ewk background .",
    "the jes and the shape and normalization of the mjb are treated as nuisance parameters in the fit , with a gaussian constraint to their expected values .",
    "thus these uncertainties are already accounted for in the statistical uncertainty on the extraction .",
    "the signal resolution uncertainty is determined by smearing each jet in the monte carlo by the expected uncertainty on the jer .",

    "[ sec : syst ] and their effect on the number of extracted signal events , the acceptance , and the cross section measurement .",
