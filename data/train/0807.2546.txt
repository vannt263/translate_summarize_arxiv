    "an approach to critical - point scaling motivated by high - temperature series expansions has recently been developed , which aims to extend the scaling window well beyond the critical regime @xcite . at a temperature @xmath0 sufficiently close to the critical temperature @xmath1",
    ", divergent thermodynamical averages display the scaling behavior @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a constant amplitude , @xmath4 is the critical index associated with the observable @xmath5 and @xmath6 is the standard reduced temperature . in order to improve the temperature range where scaling holds , other thermal scaling variables have been considered in the literature . in particular",
    "the alternative reduced temperature @xmath7 is popular in analysis of series expansions .",
    "this variable is also natural in renormalization group analyses where the temperature variable usually appears through @xmath8 ( @xmath9 being a coupling constant between microscopic degrees of freedom ) , and thus the reduced variable is defined as in  ( [ tau ] ) .",
    "the relationships between the two reduced temperatures are @xmath10 such that in the vicinity of the critical point @xmath11 while both @xmath12 and @xmath13 vanish as the critical point is approached , they have very different high - temperature limits , @xmath14 in @xcite , a rationale was given explaining why the alternative reduced temperature @xmath13 in ( [ tau ] ) may be superior to the more traditional variable @xmath12 in scaling analyses , at least in the high - temperature regime .",
    "this rationale stems from the following observations .",
    "firstly , suppose the constant @xmath3 in ( [ ot ] ) is promoted to a temperature - dependent amplitude as follows , @xmath15 where @xmath16 . from ( [ limitoftau ] ) , @xmath17 and @xmath18 may be chosen so that @xmath19 matches the high - temperature series expansion ( htse ) for @xmath20 in this limit .",
    "note that a similar approach can not be implemented for scaling in @xmath12 .",
    "i.e. , scaling in @xmath13 , unlike scaling in @xmath12 , allows @xmath19 to represent the correct asymptotic behavior of @xmath20 in the @xmath21 limit as well as close to criticality . inspired by ( [ funamp ] ) we now write the full expression for the observable @xmath20 as @xmath22 where the dots represent higher - order additive corrections . in @xcite ,",
    "campbell et al . proposed and tested the extended scaling scenario in the ising model in two dimensions as well as the ising , heisenberg and xy models in @xmath23 dimensions .",
    "these works convincingly established the superiority of the method over the conventional scheme between the lower and upper critical dimensions .",
    "the inherent idealness of the extended scaling approach to study systems _ below _ the lower critical dimension was demonstrated in  @xcite . in this work , we test extended scaling for the @xmath24-dimensional ising models with @xmath25 and 8 , i.e. _ above _ the upper critical dimension @xmath26 .",
    "furthermore , while the @xmath27 ( mean - field ) case was also investigated in @xcite ( where extended scaling is exact for all @xmath28 ) , here we include a detailed analysis of corrections in the extended scaling scheme .    in the next section we review the known results about the leading and sub - leading scaling behavior of the ising model above @xmath29 .",
    "we then define the extended scaling of this model , taking into account scaling corrections . in section",
    "3 the mc approach is presented and in section  4 the resulting data is discussed .",
    "agreement with results from htse confirms the efficacy of extended scaling , which is then used to determine the critical parameters governing scaling in higher dimensions . since above @xmath30 dimensions ,",
    "the dominant corrections to scaling are due to analytic terms , this work provides a full account of leading and confluent corrections in the susceptibility above the upper critical dimension .",
    "we conclude in section  5 .",
    "above the upper critical dimension @xmath26 , the leading scaling behavior for the magnetic susceptibility is given by mean field theory and is characterized by the exponent @xmath31 .",
    "the additive correction - to - scaling terms are expected to be non - classical .",
    "the generic scaling form for the reduced susceptibility for the ising model is @xmath32 where the dots indicate higher - order terms . in  ( [ generic1 ] ) , the confluent ( or non - analytic ) corrections involve the universal exponent @xmath33 , while the remaining correction terms are analytic .",
    "( while in principle there could be several confluent correction exponents involved in ( [ generic1 ] ) , it is sufficient in this work to consider the single exponent @xmath33 . )",
    "analysis of the @xmath34 model above @xmath26 shows that the dominant critical behavior is determined by the gaussian fixed point , leading to @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the confluent scaling corrections are due to the irrelevant @xmath34 term .",
    "the perturbation felt by the system inside the correlation volume is @xmath37 ( since the average is taken over a gaussian distribution ) , which thus behaves in the vicinity of the critical point as @xmath38 . as a consequence ,",
    "the exponent @xmath33 is given by @xmath39 for @xmath40 .",
    "thus , for @xmath41 , where @xmath42 , the confluent corrections are expected to be overwhelmed by the analytic ones . in six dimensions ,",
    "the corrections are expected to be modified by a logarithmic factor @xcite , and , explicitly , @xmath43    series analysis techniques have been used to verify the leading correction - to - scaling exponent @xmath33 in five and six dimensions and to determine some of the critical amplitudes @xcite . in particular , accepting the classical value @xmath31 , guttmann measured @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 in five dimensions as well as @xmath47 and @xmath48 in six dimensions @xcite .",
