    "for each case , he used a `` hop - stop '' ansatz in which the green function equals a sum over appropriately chosen causal trajectories between the two arguments of the green function , with a weight assigned for every hop between the elements of the trajectory and another for every stop at an intervening element . requiring that the continuum limit of the mean of the causal set green function over poisson point process samplings  so - called sprinklings  of the minkowski spacetime",
    "equals the continuum retarded green function then fixes these weights . extending the scope of the hop - stop ansatz to a larger class of causal sets would therefore allow us to study causal set quantum field theory further .",

    "we will see that the key is to identify the appropriate retarded green function for the _ massless _ field .",
    "this then leads to our proposed extensions of the model in section [ sec : generalisations ] .",
    "for @xmath2 we propose that johnston s definition of @xmath1 can be used for a minimally coupled massive scalar field on a causal set approximated by any topologically trivial spacetime .",
    "the proposal stems from the fact that the massless , minimally coupled scalar field theory is conformally invariant . in @xmath2 , for non minimal coupling ",

    "the conformally coupled massless green function is related to that in @xmath59 by @xmath169 where @xmath170 and @xmath171 denotes the retarded massless green function in @xmath59 .",

    "an example is the conformally flat patch of de sitter spacetime @xmath174 where @xmath175 is the conformal time ( @xmath176 ) and @xmath177 with @xmath178 the cosmological constant .",
    "the conformally coupled massless retarded green function is @xmath179 since de sitter is homogeneous , one can choose @xmath13 to lie at the convenient location @xmath180 so that @xmath181    taking our cue from the rnn calculation , we look to the link matrix @xmath182 whose expectation value is given by eqn ( [ linkexp ] ) .",

    "however , we also need to consider intervals of small volume that lie outside of the rnn .",

    "since there is a spatial rotational symmetry in de sitter , we can also take @xmath190 .",
    "in order to simplify the calculation of @xmath67 , we perform a boost about @xmath13 in the @xmath191 plane about @xmath13 so that @xmath192 .",

    "consider a lorentz transformation about @xmath13 in the 5-dimensional minkowski spacetime in which the hyperboloid that is de sitter spacetime is embedded , which brings @xmath185 .",
    "this transformation preserves the hyperboloid .",
    "one can then choose the conformally flat patch of de sitter with origin @xmath208 , and use the above construction .",
    "when @xmath209 are not causally related , the green functions vanish in both cases .",
    "thus the green function for global de sitter is retarded if the conformally flat green function is , and both satisfy the same equations , because there is no `` wrap - around '' in de sitter .",
    "the causal set green function we propose is well defined on a sprinkling into global de sitter .",
    "moreover , as we have shown its continuum limit matches that of the green function into the conformally flat patch and thence from the above discussion , also the green function of global de sitter spacetime .    in anti de sitter ( ads )",
    "spacetime there exist pairs of events @xmath42 such that @xmath210 is finite , but @xmath67 is infinite . while it is possible to obtain a poisson sprinkling into such a spacetime , the resulting poset is not locally finite and hence not strictly a causal set .",
    "such an interval is moreover not globally hyperbolic and hence falls outside the scope of our analysis .",
    "however , the interior of a conformally flat patch of ads ( the so - called half - space ) is globally hyperbolic and moreover , @xmath67 is finite for every @xmath42 in this region .",
