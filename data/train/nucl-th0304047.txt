    "since jaffe predicted the existence of @xmath6 particle @xcite , the study of dibaryon systems has attracted more and more attentions @xcite . a lot of theoretical models , for example , the constituent quark model in which the effective degrees of freedom are constituent quarks and gluons @xcite ; the quark - mesons exchange model in which the effective degrees of freedom are constituent quarks and goldstone bosons @xcite ; the chiral su(3 ) quark model @xcite , ... had been employed to predict the bound states of dibaryon systems .",
    "many particles , namely , @xmath6 dihyperon @xcite , @xmath7 particle @xcite , @xmath8and @xmath9 @xcite , @xmath10 @xcite have been suggested to be candidates for being observed in the experiment .",
    "unfortunately , the convincing experimental evidence for the existence of these particles has not yet been found .",
    "then it is essential to confirm which dibaryon would be the best one to be detected in the experiment . therefore , it is necessary to address the above dibaryons from different point of views , different models and different treatments , because it can open the field of vision and choose the best detectable candidate after comparing the results given by different models .",

    "employing a suitable model to study the stability and the thermodynamic properties of dibaryon at finite temperature can help us to learn the detectable possibility of dihyperon .    in previous papers , by means of the qmdtd  model , we studied the thermodynamic behavior and stability of @xmath11 and @xmath12 strangelets at finite temperature where @xmath13 is the baryon number @xcite .",

    "given the strangeness number , baryon number and electric charge , the free energy and stable radius for dibaryons and baryons can be obtained self - consistently by using the formulas in sec .",
    "ii .    as was pointed out by @xcite and sec .",
    "iii , the strong decay channel @xmath118 is forbidden because the binding energy of @xmath119is large .",
    "but at high temperature , a metastable dibaryon can absorb enough energy from the hot environment to overcome its binding energy and open the strong decay channel .",
    "to study the possibility of strong decay , we treat the @xmath75and @xmath47 as a six quarks cluster with @xmath120 and a three quarks cluster with @xmath121 respectively , and calculate their free energy density .",

    "when @xmath126 , @xmath127 , the strong decay channel opens .",
    "this result is reasonable if we notice that the temperature @xmath128 is a little bigger than the binding energy of @xmath75 , @xmath97 @xmath4 .    since the strong decay of @xmath75will open and @xmath78becomes unstable when",
    "@xmath126 , the favourable detectability of @xmath75must be taken in the regions @xmath129 @xmath4 .",
    "this temperature regions seem wide enough for detectability in rhic experiments . of course , in order to help the design of a detectable experiment , it is necessary to get more information about @xmath75 in this metastable regions . for this purpose , we study the temperature dependence of the radius and the mean lifetime of @xmath75 in @xmath130 regions .    the curves of stable radius @xmath58 vs. @xmath124 for @xmath131is shown in fig .",

    "we find that the order of magnitude is not less than @xmath138 @xmath115 in the whole metastable temperature regions .",
    "in summary , we have studied thermodynamic properties of dibaryons by using qmdtd model . at zero temperature , we find that only three dibaryons , namely , @xmath75 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , are metastable .",

    "using two essentially different models and get the same conclusion , this result strongly compels us to support @xmath75is the most favorable candidate of dibaryon for detectability , because its binding energy is maximum .    extending our investigation to finite temperature , we find the strong decay channel will open and @xmath75will become unstable when temperature arrives at @xmath125 @xmath4 .",
