    "aim of this section is to develop a many - body model of the spin filter which incorporates the main features of the experimental situation .",
    "we make the following two assumptions , which allow us to treat the corresponding many - body problem exactly :    1 .",
    "the tunneling processes of the emitted electrons are independent from each other ; i.e. the conduction band is nearly empty ( n=0 ) .",
    "2 .   the 4f - lattice is ferromagnetically saturated , i.e. low temperatures ( t=0 ) .",
    "our calculations are done for a _",
    "planar _ spin filter , i.e. a sandwich - like batch of mono layers , which are translational invariant parallel to their plane .",
    "this matches the experimental situation ( field emission through a eus - layer ) and provides at the same time the proper symmetry to include the influence of the strong electric field .",
    "the treatment of a planar system is based on the decomposition of the whole system into @xmath39 equivalent two - dimensional sub - lattices ( atomic layers ) with @xmath40 lattice points each : @xmath41 @xmath42 and @xmath43 are perpendicular to each other .",
    "@xmath43 points to the atomic layer with index @xmath44 , whereas @xmath42 points towards the lattice point with index @xmath45 inside this layer .    from the lattice vector @xmath46",

    "it is convenient to write ( [ sfhamilton ] ) in a for our purposes more suitable form : @xmath49 here the spin - operators for the conduction electrons were expressed in terms of the creation- and annihilation- operators @xmath50 : @xmath51 with @xmath52 and the identity for the ladder operators @xmath53 has been used .",
    "this representation already indicates some physics : the first term in ( [ sfhamsch ] ) describes the interaction of the z - components of the spins similar to the well known ising - model@xcite .",
    "accordingly it will be called _ ising - term_. the second term in ( [ sfhamsch ] ) is non - diagonal in spin - indices and thus responsible for spin - flip - processes ; it will be referred to as _ spin - flip term_.    interactions among the strongly localized 4-f spins might be taken into account via a heisenberg - term @xcite , but will here be neglected , as we are especially interested in the situation of conduction band electrons .",
    "magnon energies are two to three orders of magnitude smaller than the other energy scales of the system as bandwidth or s - f coupling",
    ".    for similar reasons the interaction among different conduction band electrons will not be part of the model : europium chalcogenides are magnetic semiconductors , ordering at fairly low temperatures ( in the interesting range of temperatures , the conduction band is nearly empty , and thus the contribution of electron - electron - interaction to the total energy of the system will be negligible small .",
    "the hamiltonian of an external electric field @xmath54 is a one - particle - operator . rewriting it in terms of second quantization : @xmath55 we have to determine the matrix elements @xmath56 .",

    "calculating the @xmath56 , we have to specify the vector of electric field @xmath59 , and the operator of the electric dipole momentum @xmath60 .",
    "the electric field is assumed to act homogeneously along the z - axis , i.e. perpendicular to the eux - film ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) : @xmath61 with @xmath62    we evaluate the matrix elements : @xmath63 here we assumed the wannier functions to be eigen - functions of the position - space operator , what should hold in good approximation .",
    "additionally we used ( @xmath64 : the z - component of lattice vector @xmath46 equals the product of layer index @xmath44 and lattice constant @xmath65 .",
    "furthermore we introduced the interlayer potential difference @xmath66 .",
    "for the hamiltonian of a homogeneous field , acting along the z - axis , i.e. perpendicular to spin filtering eux - film we eventually obtain @xmath67 finally we thus propose the following model hamiltonian for the spin filter : @xmath68",
    "the theoretical model developed in the previous section will now be solved .",
    "we consider a single test - electron in the otherwise empty conduction band and a ferromagnetic saturated 4f - spin system .",
    "this special case of the s - f model is not only fundamental for the understanding of the spin filter effect as it meets the experimental conditions ; it moreover can be solved exactly @xcite , even for the planar geometry @xcite .",
    "the retarded one electron anti - commutator - green - function @xmath70 will give us among other interesting information the time - dependent spectral density , which is needed for calculating the flip - probabilities ( [ w = s1 ] ) and thus the polarization of the emitted electrons ( [ p = w ] ) : @xmath71    to determine this green function , one has to solve its equation of motion : @xmath72_+ \\right\\rangle + \\left\\langle\\!\\left\\langle [ c_{i \\alpha \\sigma } , h]_{- } ; c^+_{j \\beta \\sigma } \\right\\rangle\\!\\right\\rangle_e,\\ ] ] the higher green functions , appearing on the rhs of ( [ algbwglsch ] ) @xmath73 are to be calculated by solving _ their _ equations of motion .",
    "this procedure usually leads to an infinite hierarchy of coupled green functions and their equations of motion . to get any solution ,",
    "physically reasonable decouplings are needed .",
    "one possible treatment would be the mean field approximation where ( [ isingfkt ] ) can be expressed in terms of ( [ eegfschsf ] ) and ( [ flipfkt ] ) is suppressed completely .",
    "after doing the two - dimensional fourier transformation parallel to the planes , the equation of motion ( [ algbwglsch ] ) of the one - electron green function @xmath74 reads as follows : @xmath75    in the case of an empty conduction band ( n=0 ) and ferromagnetic saturation of the f - spin lattice ( t=0 ) which is considered here , we can solve this exactly .",
    "writing down the equation of motion of the so called flip - function @xmath76 ( [ flipfkt ] ) one recognizes , that all higher green functions may be expressed in terms of already known ones ore vanish @xcite .",
    "we find the following expression : @xmath77 that expresses the flip - function completely in terms of the one - electron green function @xmath78 .",
    "here we introduced the complex propagator @xmath79 : @xmath80 ( [ sumf = g ] ) and ( [ eom3 ] ) form a coupled system of equations .",
    "the equation of motion ( [ eom3 ] ) is at this point obviously equivalent to a matrix - multiplication which may be written in the following compact formulation : @xmath81 @xmath82 is the effective hamiltonian of the one - dimensional problem of an atomic chain perpendicular to the translational invariant layers . in site representation",
    "it reads @xmath83 with its matrix elements : @xmath84 containing the complex , local and spin - depending self - energy @xmath85 @xmath86 the complex propagator @xmath79 ( [ b_al ] ) and the fourier - transformed hopping - integrals @xmath87 .",
    "it should be noticed , that the self - energy for @xmath12-electrons is trivial .",
    "this is due to the fact , that these electrons can not participate in the spin flip processes , so that their interaction with the ferromagnetically saturated 4-f spins is restricted to a rigid energy shift of the @xmath12-conduction band .",
    "the propagator @xmath79 and the self - energy @xmath85 are layer dependent ( index @xmath44 ) but independent of the in - plane wave vector @xmath28 .",
    "the latter is due to our neglect of magnon energies which is not necessary but convenient and reasonable since they are two to three orders of magnitudes smaller than other typical energy scales of the system ( bandwidth , s - f coupling ) .",
    "however , our model might be solved exactly with full consideration of the magnon energies .    from ( [ bwglmatrix ] )",
    "we get finally the exact solution of the many - body - system by matrix - inversion : @xmath88      the hamiltonian of the electric field ( [ feldham ] ) is a single - particle - operator : @xmath89 expressed in terms of second quantization , i.e. by means of the electron creation- and annihilation - operators the electric - field - operator @xmath90 is therefore of the same structure as the operator of the kinetic energy of electrons @xmath91 . they can be summed up : @xmath92 the renormalisation of the hopping matrix elements by the external field is equivalent to a displacement of the bloch - band centers of gravity by a position dependent amount for each layer .    an external electric field thus renormalizes the layer dependent self - energy : @xmath93 however , the principal structure of the many - body problem remains unaffected .",
    "its solution is given by @xmath94 with @xmath95 defined analogously to ( [ hk ] ) with the renormalized self - energy ( [ sire ] ) .",
    "the matrix inversion in ( [ gensol ] ) is done numerically for a sc - film with layers parallel to the ( 100)-face .",
    "as stated above , the self - energy for @xmath12-electrons is trivial .",
    "this is due to the fact , that this electron group can not participate in the spin flip processes , so that its interaction with the ferromagnetically saturated 4-f spins is restricted to rigid energy shift of the @xmath12-conduction band .",
    "for that reason we now focus on the discussion of the @xmath13-results .      with the green functions given by ( [ gensol ] ) we can calculate the spectral densities @xmath96 .",
    "they depend on the spin direction @xmath2 of the test - electron as well as on the layer - index @xmath44 and the in - plane wave - vector @xmath28 : @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the element @xmath99 of the green function matrix ( [ gensol ] ) .",
    "[ fig4 ] shows the spectral density @xmath100 for the center layer ( @xmath101 ) of a five - layer - film with and without ( right / left column ) external electric field for no , medium and strong ( top/ middle/ bottom line ) interaction between 4f - spins and conduction band .",
    "the top left picture of fig.[fig4 ] shows accordingly the well known dispersion of the free bloch electron gas in the two - dimensional brillouin zone .",
    "as the system consists of five layers one might expect five excitation energies .",
    "however , for symmetry reasons two pairs of them are degenerated , we see only three peaks at each @xmath28-point . + by switching on an external electric field perpendicular to the film , this degeneracy is lifted and five different peaks can be observed ( top right picture of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .    middle and bottom line of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] show the situation for finite values of the coupling strength @xmath102 between 4f - spins and conduction band electrons .",
    "in each of these pictures we find two main structures : an energetically lower lying , broad and dispersionless so called _ flip band _ and at higher energies a sharply peaked structure which corresponds to the _ magnetic polaron _ and shows a bloch like dispersion .",
    "the flip band originates from spin flip processes of the conduction band electrons . via the s - f interaction ,",
    "the @xmath13 conduction band electron can emit a magnon , i.e. it causes a spin deviation in the ferromagnetically saturated lattice of 4f - spins .",
    "as this process is of course forbidden for @xmath12 electrons , the spectral densities @xmath103 for @xmath12 electrons are rather trivial .",
    "they are not shown separately .",
    "the sharply peaked structure corresponds to a quasiparticle with in most cases infinite lifetime : the magnetic polaron .",
    "this means , in analogy to the `` normal '' polaron , an electron , renormalized by a cloud of virtual excitations , namely magnons . as this quasiparticle propagates freely through the crystal lattice , .",
    "the corresponding structures in the spectral densities show therefore a bloch like dispersion .    in the strong coupling regime ( @xmath1040.2 ev ) both structures",
    "are energetically clearly separated , the polaron is represented by @xmath105-peaks and has therefore indeed infinite lifetime .",
    "this changes at weaker couplings : at @xmath106 , i.e. realistic values for eus , the polaron peak touches the flip band and becomes considerably broadened near to the @xmath107-point of the two dimensional brillouin zone .",
    "the lifetime of the polaron under these circumstances is finite and of the order of    the external electric field ( right column of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) increases mainly the energetic distances between the layers and thereby influences strongly the shape of all spectral densities .",
    "the polaronic peaks become more separated . as the flip band reproduces roughly the shape of the ( @xmath12)-dos , the flip band changes with the ( @xmath12)-dos under the influence of the electric field , too . because of ( [ w = s1 ]",
    ") one should expect a similarly significant field induced change of the transition- and spin flip- probabilities .",
    "this will be investigated in the following sub - section .",
    "we apply ( [ w = s1 ] ) on the typical @xmath13-spectral density of the s - f model . as calculated ( [ sksial ] , [ gensol ] ) and",
    "shown above fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] it consists at each @xmath28-point of the broad flip band , written now as @xmath108 , a continuous function of energy without singularities , and the @xmath105-like polaron band @xmath109 : @xmath110 the @xmath111 are the spectral weights ( @xmath112 ) .    from ( [ ssf ] )",
    "one finds with ( [ w = s1 ] ) @xmath113 because of the linearity of fourier transformation . with parsevals theorem @xmath114",
    "we conclude from the normalization of @xmath108 that @xmath115 must vanish quicker than @xmath116 for @xmath117 .    for a typical spectral density of our model",
    "we therefore find from ( [ ssf ] ) and ( [ w = s1 ] ) : @xmath118 this interesting result shows , that the non - flip probability for a ( @xmath13)-electron is completely determined by the spectral weight of the polaron peak in the spectral density and therefore strongly dependent on position in the brillouin zone , coupling strength and temperature .",
    "we ask now for the probability of finding an electron independent of its spin direction in a layer with index @xmath119 at time @xmath27 after we prepared it at time @xmath29 in layer @xmath44 . generalizing ( [ w = s1 ] )",
    "we find : @xmath120 we will illustrate ( [ w = s2 ] ) by investigating it analytically for a two layer system of free electrons ( i.e. @xmath121 ) with applied electric field .",
    "the spectral densities have a double peak structure : @xmath122,\\ ] ] where the @xmath111 are again the spectral weights of the @xmath105-peaks ( @xmath112 ) and @xmath123 is the @xmath39-th excitation energy of the system .",
    "@xmath123 is given as the @xmath39-th pole of the green functions ( [ gensol ] ) : @xmath124 @xmath125 is a measure for the energetic separation of the layers and depends on the interlayer hopping @xmath27 set to @xmath126 and the interlayer- potential - difference @xmath127 induced by the external electric field ( [ feldham ] ) .",
    "now a simple calculation from ( [ w = s2 ] ) using ( [ spekmat1 ] ) yields @xmath128 the probability of finding an electron in the second layer ( @xmath129 ) or in the first layer ( @xmath130 ) at time @xmath27 after we prepared it at time @xmath29 in the first layer of our two layer film .",
    "both probabilities are completely determined by @xmath131 , the energetic separation of the layers and therefore not @xmath28-dependent .",
    "increasing the external electric field @xmath127 , we observe a growing confinement of the electron in the layer it had been prepared in fig .",
    "this behavior is well known as wannier - stark - localization@xcite .",
    "finally we want to determine the probability of finding an electron at time @xmath27 in layer @xmath119 with reversed spin @xmath132 after it had been prepared at time @xmath29 in layer @xmath44 with opposite spin @xmath2 .",
    "these spin flip probabilities @xmath133 are obviously given by the overlap of the bloch states @xmath134 with states like @xmath135 .",
    "the spin flip process of the conduction band electron results always from a magnon emission , i.e. it is connected to a spin deviation in the lattice of the magnetic 4-f moments .",
    "let us assume this magnon had been emitted in layer @xmath136 and carries away the momentum @xmath137 .",
    "in order to get the total spin flip probability @xmath133 we have to sum over all possibilities of emitting such a @xmath138-magnon : @xmath139    the flip probabilities @xmath133 are related to the spectral density @xmath140 of the spin flip green function ( [ flipfkt ] ) .",
    "straight forward calculation similar to those in section ( [ subsec : prob_green ] ) show : @xmath141 the corresponding probability @xmath142 vanishes , since we considered here the case of a ferromagnetically saturated 4-f lattice , which can not be aligned any further and thus interdicts spin flip processes for ( @xmath12)-electrons .    in a last step we have now to determine the general spin flip function @xmath143 which is in the usual way connected to its spectral density : @xmath144 after fourier transformation we will get @xmath145 .",
    "the general spin flip function can be obtained from the hierarchy of the equation of motion .",
    "the calculation is comparable to the one in section ( [ sec : sol ] ) and yields finally : @xmath146 with @xmath147 the equations ( [ hk]-[loesung ] ) and their generalized form which includes the external electric field ( [ sire]),([gensol ] ) completely determine the solution .",
    "( [ flipwl ] ) and ( [ flipgl1 ] ) give us the probabilities for spin flip processes we were looking for .",
    "the spin flip - and non flip- probabilities derived so far were evaluated numerically for a two - layer sc - film with layers parallel to the ( 100)-face .",
    "the results for different values of s - f coupling and strength of the external electric field are shown in the figures [ fig7],[fig8 ] and [ fig9 ] .",
    "it should be stressed , that the shown non - flip- and flip - probabilities were obtained in separate calculations , based on completely different many - body entities ( one - electron green function and spin flip function , respectively ) .",
    "however , our understanding of those complementary probabilities demands that they add up to 1 for all times and all vectors @xmath28 ( particle conservation ) .",
    "as the figures show , this is fulfilled in each case ( bottom right pictures ) .    comparing the figures [ fig7]-[fig10 ] we can summarize :    1 .",
    "the spin - totalized probabilities ( bottom lines ) do not show a significant dependence on the strength of the s - f coupling @xmath102 between conduction band electrons and localized 4-f moments .",
    "accordingly they are equal to those with no coupling @xmath148 which had been determined analytically in subsection ( [ subsec : prob ] ) and are completely independent of the intra - layer momentum @xmath28 .",
    "the total spin flip - and non flip- probabilities ( right columns ) do not show any dependence on the external electric field @xmath127 .",
    "accordingly they are equal to those without field @xmath149 .",
    "calculations for films with various numbers of layers show : the total spin flip - and non flip- probabilities are also independent from the total number of layers in the film .",
    "consequently they are the same as those which are calculated for a mono - layer .",
    "these observations simplify the practical evaluation of spin flip probabilities for the spin filter experiment essentially and allow to determine the polarization of the field - emitted electrons quite generally .      according to ( [ p = w ] ) the polarization",
    "is completely determined by the effective spin flip ratio @xmath150 , where the flip probability for ( @xmath12)-electrons @xmath151 vanishes identically and the ( time dependent ) flip probability for @xmath13-electrons @xmath21 is given by ( [ flipwl ] ) as pointed out in the previous subsection .",
    "using the observations ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) concerning @xmath142 made in the previous subsection the calculation of the polarization simplifies considerably : the dynamics of the spin flip processes turned out to depend neither on the strength of the external electric field nor on the number of layers of the spin filter .",
    "it is completely determined by the strength of the s - f interaction @xmath102 .    practically calculating the polarization",
    "therefore simply demands to evaluate the spin flip probabilities for a mono - layer - film without electric field @xmath152or , even simpler , its complementary quantity : the non flip probability @xmath153 as @xmath154    in the previous subsection we showed , that after a sufficient long period of time the non flip probability @xmath153 is given by the square of the spectral weight of the polaron .",
    "this  critical  time is characterized by the width of the scattering peak : and thus sufficiently smaller than typical amount of time an electron spends in the spin filter .",
    "we can therefore apply equation ( [ winfty ] ) and obtain finally : @xmath155 the degree of polarization is completely given in terms of the spectral weight of the magnetic polaron peak @xmath156 and thus strongly dependent on the s - f coupling as well as the electrons intra - layer momentum @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath156 is obtained by integration of the spectral density ( [ sksial ] ) .",
    "[ fig11 ] shows the degree of polarization @xmath157 calculated according to ( [ pk ] ) for different s - f interactions .",
    "it is interesting to see that for unrealistic small values of the coupling ( @xmath158 ) , one really gets nearly 100% of polarization .",
    "this is due to the finite life time of the magnetic polarons under these circumstances : polaronic and scattering peak touch each other near to the origin of the two - dimensional brillouin zone , the polaronic gets broadened and the @xmath13-electrons  decay  into ( @xmath12)-states .",
    "however , for realistic values of @xmath102 ( @xmath159 ) the polarization lies for all @xmath28 clearly below 100% ( fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] , right ) .",
    "the spin filter experiment allows only for a @xmath28-averaged measurement of the degree of polarization @xmath16 .",
    "out of all electrons with given total energy those electrons with maximum energy perpendicular to the tunneling barrier will be transmitted most likely .",
    "that are just those electrons with minimum intra - layer momentum @xmath28 , i.e. the electrons close to the @xmath107-point of the two - dimensional brillouin zone .",
    "according to our calculation ( fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] , right ) this would yield @xmath160 , which accounts much better for the experimental results then former mean field results do .    to exploit equation ( [ pk ] ) fully , @xmath28-resolved experiments as for instance spin polarized low energy electron diffraction ( spleed ) or spin polarized electron energy loss spectroscopy ( speels ) on an europium chalcogenide surface",

    "aim of the presented paper was a new interpretation of the spin filter experiments done on europium chalcogenides using recent results from many - body - theory on the s - f model .",
    "this was achieved by expressing the degree of polarization of the field emitted electrons in terms of spin flip probabilities which had been determined in the framework of an exactly solvable many - body model of the experimental situation .",
    "this model used the s - f model in reduced dimensions ( film geometry ) , including an additional term taking into account the strong external electrical field .",
    "several physically relevant probabilities as layer resolved probability densities , flip and non flip probabilities had been derived and discussed , showing for instance the wannier - stark - localization due to the electrical field and the strong dependence of the spin flip probabilities on the intra - layer momentum and the s - f coupling between ferromagnetically ordered 4-f spins and conduction band electrons of the spin filter .",
    "the degree of polarization of the field emitted electrons evaluated in our model turned out to be well below 100% for all temperatures which is in good agreement with the experiments and a considerable progress with respect to mean field results of former works ."
