    "x - ray spectra of black - hole binaries ( bhbs ) depend on the luminosity in complex ways , particularly when they are luminous ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , as long as the luminosity is well below the eddington limit , @xmath13 , bhbs exhibit only two major spectral states ; the high / soft state and the low / hard state , which manifest themselves when the luminosity is higher and lower than a few percent of @xmath13 , respectively @xcite . in the high / soft state ,",
    "a bhb spectrum consists of optically - thick thermal emission from a standard accretion disk ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and a power - law shaped hard tail extending up to mev energies with a photon index of @xmath14 .    in the low / hard state ,",
    "a bhb emits a harder spectrum that can be approximated by a @xmath15 power law , accompanied by subsidiary features such as iron - k related structures ( e.g. , @xcite ) , a low energy excess ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and a hard x - ray hump attributable to reflection by cool matter ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , the spectrum often exhibits a cutoff at energies above 50150 kev , as observed from several bhbs and a fair number of seyfert galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) . as a result , a thermal - comptonization scenario ( e.g. , @xcite ) and its variants have been developed as a standard interpretation . according to this scenario , the low / hard state emission from an accreting black hole is formed when some seed photons are compton up - scattered by a hot electron distribution , with the electron temperature determining the high - energy spectral cutoff .    in spite of its general success , details of the thermal comptonization scenario",
    "are far from established .",
    "it is yet to be clarified whether the supposed hot electron cloud should be identified with an optically - thin portion of the accretion disk , or a sort of corona above an optically - thick cool disk .",
    "the radial and vertical extents of the hot cloud are not well constrained . nor",
    "is it clear yet whether the soft seed photons come from an optically - thick and cool portion of the disk , or from the hot cloud itself as thermal cyclotron emission . in order to better quantify this promising scenario for the low / hard state , careful modeling of the spectra over a broad energy band",
    "is of particular importance .",
    "in fact , @xcite found that broad - band spectra of cyg x-1 , obtained with bepposax , can be successfully reproduced by invoking _ two _",
    "compton @xmath12-parameters , of @xmath16 and @xmath17",
    ". we may then utilize the extremely broad energy band of suzaku @xcite , to extend such studies to a larger number of bhbs . here , we describe suzaku results on the low / hard state of gro j1655@xmath040 , which is a secure bhb having a much higher inclination angle than cyg x-1 ( @xmath18 ; @xcite ) .",
    "gro j1655@xmath040 is a transient x - ray source discovered with the batse onboard the compton gamma ray observatory @xcite .",
    "subsequent optical observations revealed a 2.6 d binary period @xcite , and successfully determined the mass of the compact object and mass - donating star as @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively @xcite . the system is thus considered to be a bhb . together with grs 1915 + 105 @xcite ,",
    "this object is classified as an interesting subgroup of bhb possessing superluminal radio jets @xcite .",
    "the system inclination , @xmath21 , of gro j1655@xmath040 is estimated to be @xmath22 from jet kinematics , or @xmath23 from optical light curves @xcite .",
    "although the distance is estimated to be 3.2@xmath240.2 kpc from the radio jet kinematics @xcite , a shorter distance of @xmath25 kpc has been proposed by @xcite based on the spectral type of the secondary star .",
    "in addition , gro j1655@xmath040 allowed the first detection of narrow x - ray absorption lines from ionized iron @xcite . together with those in other high - inclination sources @xcite and in dipping binary sources @xcite ,",
    "the detection of these absorption lines indicates the existence of highly ionized plasmas above the accretion disks .",
    "on 2005 february 17 , an x - ray brightening of gro j1655 - 40 was detected by the rxte all sky monitor  ( asm ) @xcite ; since then it remained active for more than half a year .",
    "x - ray observations were carried out with xmm - newton @xcite , integral @xcite , swift @xcite , chandra @xcite , and rxte @xcite , as the source evolved from the low / hard state into the high / soft state , and then back again .",
    "based on high energy spectra obtained in the low / hard state early in the outburst , @xcite reported the detection of a high - energy cutoff around 180 kev .",
    "in contrast , broad - band spectra taken during the high / soft state reveal a hard tail component extending up to @xmath26 kev @xcite , reconfirming a previous osse detection @xcite .",
    "the absorption lines from highly ionized ions were also reconfirmed with a blue shift equivalent to 300 - 6000 km s@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the present paper describes suzaku observations of gro  j@xmath27 made in the decay phase during the 2005 september campaign , while the object was in the low / hard state .",
    "we successfully detected the object over a broad , unprecedented , energy range of 0.7300 kev .",
    "although the obtained broad - band spectra can be approximated by a power - law of photon index @xmath7 , the high - quality suzaku data clearly reconfirm the spectral cutoff at energies above @xmath28 kev as well as a weak soft x - ray excess .",
    "furthermore , the data require two comptonized components , having a common electron temperature but different optical depths .",
    "absorption features around 6 kev were not detected significantly .",
    "using suzaku @xcite , we observed gro  j1655@xmath040 from 2005 september 22 , 07:16 ut , through 07:07 ut of the next day .",
    "the data were acquired with the x - ray imaging spectrometer ( xis : @xcite ) and the hard x - ray detector ( hxd : @xcite ) . as shown in figure  [ fig : asmlc ] , the source was at that time in the decay phase of the 2005 outburst , exhibiting a typical 1.512 kev intensity of a few tens mcrab",
    ".    installed at the focal plane of the four x - ray telescopes ( xrt : @xcite ) , the xis consists of one back - illuminated ccd ( bi - ccd ) camera and three front - illuminated ccd ( fi - ccd ) cameras , observing in the energy range from 0.2 kev to 12 kev . during the present gro  j1655@xmath040 observation , the xis was operated in the normal 3@xmath293 and 2@xmath292 modes . since the source is relatively bright , we employed `` 1/8 window '' option in which , out of the 1024 rows , 128 rows around the source image are read out .",
    "this shortens the frame exposure time to 1 s , and reduces the number of xis events suffering from pile - up .",
    "furthermore , one of the fi - ccds ( xis0 ) was not used in order to double the telemetry capacity of the bi - ccd ( xis1 ) .",
    "the hxd was operated in the normal mode , acquiring 1070 kev data with the si pin photo diodes ( hereafter pin ) and 40600 kev data with the gso scintillators ( hereafter gso ) . combining pin and gso with the xis",
    ", suzaku can cover a broad energy band spanning three orders of magnitude .",
    "the average 0.7300 kev flux of gro  j1655@xmath040 was measured to be @xmath30 erg s@xmath4 @xmath31 .",
    "the luminosity in the same band was estimated to be @xmath32 erg s@xmath4 , which corresponds to @xmath5 % of @xmath13 for a 6 @xmath6 black hole , assuming a distance of 3.2 kpc @xcite .",
    "for the xis data analysis , we accumulated cleaned events over good time intervals that were selected by removing spacecraft passages through the south atlantic anomaly ( saa ) and periods of low earth elevation ( @xmath33 for the day - time earth and @xmath34 for the night earth ) .",
    "the details are described in @xcite .",
    "the source and background events were accumulated inside and outside the central circular region of radius @xmath35 for each ccd image , respectively . since xis2 and xis3 have almost the same properties , we hereafter present results obtained from their co - added spectra .",
    "the total exposure time achieved was 35 ks per sensor .",
    "although the intensity of gro j1655@xmath040 was @xmath250  mcrab and we used the `` 1/8 window '' option , we still need to be careful about photon pile - up in the xis data . in order to quantify this effect ,",
    "we tentatively extracted another spectrum from a @xmath36 annular region , where the count rate for each pixel is several times lower than that within the central @xmath37 , and the pile - up effect is considered to be negligible in the annulus . comparing this spectrum with the original one from the entire @xmath35 radius , we found that the original spectrum has @xmath2 3% and 5% higher count rates than the annular one in the 78 kev and 910 kev energy bands , respectively , after equalizing their normalizations in the 12 kev band .",
    "this result suggests that the region inside @xmath38 slightly suffers from photon pile - up .",
    "therefore , considering the statistical error ( @xmath2 3% ) of the spectra after binning , we limited the xis energy range to @xmath39 kev .",
    "since the hxd does not have offset detectors @xcite , subtraction of non x - ray background is an essential part of the data analysis .",
    "generally , the background spectrum to be subtracted is synthesized , employing certain models that are based on the hxd data accumulated during periods of earth occultation @xcite .",
    "the models are being developed by the hxd team , and the results are being made publicly available ; some early suzaku publications ( e.g. , @xcite ) have actually used the modeled pin backgrounds .",
    "however , gro j1655@xmath040 was observed only 2 months after the launch , when long - lived activation components in the gso background spectra were still increasing at a significant rate .",
    "therefore , the model background is thought to be less reliable in this particular case , compared to other hxd observations conducted on later occasions .",
    "we have hence chosen another method , namely to derive the background spectrum directly from some blank - sky observations conducted on an occasion close in time to the present observation of gro j1655@xmath040 .",
    "below , our primary method is to employ this blank - sky subtraction , but we will compare our results to the `` standard '' modeled background as a cross confirmation .    to carry out the blank - sky subtraction , we employed data from an observation of the planetary nebula bd+30@xmath403639 , because it was conducted on the day just before the gro j1655@xmath040 observation ( 2006 september 21 ) , and no hard x - ray source is catalogued in this sky region . the on - source ( i.e. , gro j1655@xmath040 ) and blank - sky ( i.e. , bd+30@xmath403639 ) data were both accumulated after removing time periods immediately before ( 3 minutes ) and after ( 7 minutes ) each passage through the saa , and those periods when suzaku was in regions of low geomagnetic cutoff rigidity ( @xmath39 gv ) . to exclude the periods of earth occultation",
    ", we further screened the on - source data by the condition that the target elevation above the earth s horizon should be @xmath41 .",
    "then , the background events of pin and gso were accumulated over the same orbital phases of suzaku as the on - source data integration .",
    "the obtained on - source exposure was corrected for dead time , using so - called pseudo events implemented in the hxd @xcite ; this method has been verified in orbit using other independent dead - time indicators @xcite . as a result",
    ", a live time of 20 ks was attained .",
    "figure  [ fig : hxd_src_bkg_spec ] compares the on - source and blank - sky hxd spectra , both obtained in this way .",
    "the background - subtracted spectra are also presented .",
    "the source is so bright that the signal from gro  j1655@xmath040 is more than half of the pin background even at its upper - bound energy of 70 kev .",
    "therefore , systematic errors of the pin background are considered to be negligible over the entire pin energy range ( 1070 kev ) . in the gso range ,",
    "the source signal is 25% and 10% of the background at 40100 kev and 100300 kev , respectively .",
    "as described in the appendix , the gso background estimation using blank - sky observations is thought to be accurate to about 2% . as a result",
    ", we can claim a source detection with the gso over an energy range of 40300 kev . since the gso background subtraction becomes more susceptible to systematic errors as the integration time becomes shorter , we hereafter report results from analysis of the gso data integrated over the entire 20 ks exposure only .",
    "in addition to the above analysis using the blank - sky observation , we tried currently available background models to synthesize the pin and gso backgrounds .",
    "these models provide a set of time - tagged _ fake _ events ( separately for pin and gso ) , in the same form as the actual on - source data acquired .",
    "we processed these background events in exactly the same manner as the on - source data , using in particular the same `` good time intervals '' .",
    "the derived model backgrounds are also presented in figure  [ fig : hxd_src_bkg_spec ] .",
    "thus , the two sets of backgrounds from the two methods ( the blank - sky data and the synthetic model ) agree well with each other ; the gso backgrounds agree within @xmath42 2% , while the pin spectra agree within @xmath42 3% below @xmath2 50 kev , although there is a slight deviation at higher energies .",
    "figure  [ fig : broadbandspectrum ] shows broad - band energy spectra of gro  j1655@xmath040 from 0.7 kev to 300 kev , obtained with the xis and hxd , by averaging all the data . in order to assess the overall shapes of these spectra without relying on the detector responses and in a way that is rather free from possible calibration uncertainties , we first converted them into so - called `` crab ratios '' , whereby the source spectrum is divided by a crab spectrum that was accumulated in the same way .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : crab_ratio ] , the calculated crab ratio indicates that the object had an intensity of @xmath43 mcrab at 20 kev .",
    "the crab ratio exhibits a nearly constant logarithmic slope of @xmath2 0.5 in the 2100 kev range . considering that the crab spectrum can be approximated by a power law with a photon index of @xmath44 2.1",
    ", this implies that the spectrum of gro  j1655@xmath040 also takes a power - law shape , but with @xmath44 1.6 .",
    "we hence conclude that gro  j1655@xmath040 was in the low / hard state during the suzaku observation . in detail",
    ", the slope in the 1070 kev band is slightly harder than that in 310 kev .",
    "the strong drop in the crab ratio below 1 kev is caused by a higher absorbing column density toward gro  j1655@xmath040 than that to the crab .    at energies above @xmath2 100 kev ,",
    "the crab ratio in figure  [ fig : crab_ratio ] exhibits a clear turnover .",
    "since the crab spectrum , which is about an order of magnitude brighter than that of gro  j1655@xmath040 at @xmath28 kev , is known to exhibit a single power - law shape in the hard x - ray range up to 300 kev or more ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the hint of a turnover in the crab ratio suggests an intrinsic high - energy cutoff in the gro  j1655@xmath040 spectrum , as is often observed from other bhbs in the low / hard sate . in the figure , the ratios are also plotted by artificially changing the gso background intensity by @xmath242% , which is the typical error as described in the appendix .",
    "thus , the presence of a turnover itself is unaffected by the gso background uncertainty , although the steepness of the cutoff might be affected .",
    "figure  [ fig : lightcurve ] shows background - subtracted light curves of gro  j1655@xmath040 obtained with the xis and hxd - pin .",
    "the intensity decreased gradually during this one - day long observation , by @xmath45 in the softest 0.72 kev band and by @xmath46 in the higher energy bands , resulting in a slight spectral hardening with time .    in order to quantify the intensity - correlated spectral changes",
    ", we divided the data into two halves , which we hereafter refer to as the first and second halves ( figure  [ fig : lightcurve ] ) .",
    "we then extracted the corresponding energy spectra from the xis and pin .",
    "( as mentioned above , we did not attempt such time - resolved spectral analysis on the gso data . )",
    "the time coverage was half a day for each of the first and second halves of the pin data , and the blank - sky pin background was accumulated over the corresponding portions of the bd+30@xmath403639 observation .",
    "figure  [ fig : ratio_half ] shows spectral ratios between the two halves .",
    "the source intensity decreased by @xmath2 10% above @xmath8 kev , and by up to @xmath2 18% below @xmath8 kev .",
    "thus , the intensity decrease is somewhat more prominent at low energies , in agreement with the impression from the light curves .",
    "( these percentages are smaller than are indicated by the light curves , simply because of time averaging effects . )",
    "this suggests the presence of a separate soft spectral component , which is superposed on the dominant power - law shaped continuum that is emitted over the entire energy band .        as a first - cut quantitative spectral study , we tried an absorbed single power - law model on the xis data of gro  j1655@xmath040 , as suggested by the crab ratio in figure  [ fig : crab_ratio ] . specifically , we fitted the spectrum from the bi - ccd ( xis1 ) and that from the two fi - ccds ( xis2 and xis3 co - added ) simultaneously , using the detector responses ae_xi1_20060213c.rmf and ae_xi1_xisnom4_20060415.arf for xis1 , and averages of ae_xi[23]_20060213.rmf and ae_xi[23]_xisnom4_20060415.arf for the co - added fi spectrum . here and hereafter , fits to the xis spectra utilize only the 0.71.7 kev and 1.98 kev ranges , because the excluded energy bands are still subject to calibration uncertainties or possible pile - up effects .",
    "the effect of contamination on the optical blocking filters of the xis is modeled as additional absorption @xcite . in the fitting , we kept the energy offset to be a free parameter within @xmath47  ev , which is the current tolerance of the xis energy scale .",
    "the overall model normalization is here and hereafter allowed to differ between different xis sensors .",
    "the single power - law fit , with a free photon index @xmath48 and a free absorbing column density @xmath49 ( using the `` wabs '' model ; @xcite ) , was formally rejected by the xis data with @xmath50 , mainly due to wiggling residuals at energies below @xmath51 kev .",
    "this , together with the soft - energy behavior revealed by figure  [ fig : ratio_half ] , inspired us to incorporate an independent soft component .",
    "evidently , the most natural candidate is an optically - thick disk emission component which is described by the `` disk - blackbody ( diskbb ) '' model @xcite .",
    "we therefore adopted a model consisting of a power - law and a disk blackbody , both absorbed by a common absorber with column density @xmath49 .",
    "this composite model , denoted by `` diskbb+pow '' , gave a much improved fit with @xmath52 , yielding an innermost disk temperature of @xmath53 kev and an innermost disk radius of @xmath54 km at a distance of 3.2 kpc , where @xmath21 is the inclination angle of the disk .",
    "nevertheless , the model was not yet fully acceptable , because of some positive residuals in the 58 kev energy range .",
    "finally , we obtained @xmath55 , by adding a broad ( @xmath56 kev ) gaussian line component , centered at @xmath57 kev and having an equivalent width ( ew ) of @xmath58 ev .",
    "the fit is in fact marginally unacceptable at the 99% confidence level , but the fit statistic has a similar value to that obtained when we fit the crab spectrum with an absorbed single power - law model .",
    "thus , we considered that this fitting is essentially acceptable under the current level of instrumental calibration and response adjustments . although we can not rule out the possibility of this gaussian feature having an instrumental origin , the obtained gaussian parameters are suggestive of a broad iron line , or some related spectral features .",
    "the obtained best - fit parameters are listed in table  1 .",
    "the power - law component has @xmath59 , which is typical of an accreting black hole in the low / hard state .",
    "the `` diskbb '' component has an innermost disk temperature of @xmath60 kev , and carries 10.2% of the 0.52 kev source flux ( or 4.1% in the 0.510 kev range ) .",
    "we used numerical modeling @xcite to represent the effects of contamination on the optical blocking filters of the xis sensors .",
    "the model , which is still under development , may include some unknown systematic errors .",
    "however , this should not affect our results significantly , since the contaminant was not so thick when the present observation was performed ( only two months after the launch ) .",
    "also , we did not use data below energies of 0.7  kev , since there is a relatively high interstellar column density toward gro  j1655@xmath040 .      before actually conducting model fitting to the hxd - pin and gso spectra of gro  j1655@xmath040",
    ", we briefly describe the hxd data of the crab nebula . with the current pin response ( ae_hxd_pinxinom_20060814.rsp )",
    ", the 1070 kev pin spectrum of the crab nebula can be successfully represented by a single power - law model with @xmath61 , which agrees with numerous previous measurements .",
    "similarly , using the gso response ae_hxd_gsoxinom_20060321.rsp , the 100300 kev gso spectrum of the crab is reproduced to a reasonable accuracy with @xmath62 @xcite .    strictly speaking",
    ", the single power - law fit to the gso spectrum of the crab over the 70300 kev range , using the current gso response , is formally unacceptable , due to mild ( @xmath63 ) convex residuals [ see figure  18 in @xcite ] .",
    "this implies that the gso response predicts spectra that are slightly too concave than it should .",
    "therefore , the gso response needs to be improved , or at least corrected , when we try to quantify the high - energy cutoff of gro j1655@xmath040 suggested by its crab ratio . in order to make the necessary correction in an explicit manner ,",
    "we have resorted to introducing an empirical correction factor of the form @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the energy in kev , and multiplying this factor to any input model before it is convolved with the current gso response .",
    "this function , @xmath66 , has a mildly convex shape with a peak at @xmath2 150 kev , and takes values in the range @xmath67 for @xmath68 .",
    "in fact , this particular functional form has been determined so that the current gso response can successfully reproduce the 70300 kev spectrum of the crab nebula by a single power - law with @xmath69 , when the input power - law model is multiplied by @xmath66 . hereafter in the present paper , we always include this factor @xmath66 when fitting gso spectra .    with these preparations",
    ", we fitted the hxd ( pin and gso ) spectra of gro  j1655@xmath040 , after subtracting the bd+30@xmath403639 spectra as the blank - sky backgrounds ( subsection 3.1 ) .",
    "a single power - law model ( but multiplied by equation ( 1 ) when simulating the gso data ) failed to give an acceptable joint fit to the pin and gso spectra , with @xmath70 , even though the relative pin versus gso normalization was left free to vary .",
    "since the model was actually over - predicting the gso data above 100 kev , we replaced the power - law model with a cutoff power - law ( hereafter `` cutoffpl '' ) model , namely , a power - law multiplied by an exponential factor of the form @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath73 is the cutoff `` temperature '' .",
    "this model gave an acceptable ( @xmath74 ) joint fit to the pin and gso spectra of gro  j1655@xmath040 , with the relative pin versus gso normalization in agreement within 10% of that obtained from the crab analysis .",
    "the best - fit parameters are listed in table  1 , including in particular values of @xmath75 and @xmath76 kev , where the first errors are statistical and the second ones reflect the 2% systematic uncertainty in the gso background subtraction .",
    "the systematic errors may be somewhat overestimated , because the value of 2% is rather conservative ( see appendix ) .    by means of model fitting to the hxd data , we have thus confirmed quantitatively the presence of the high - energy spectral turnover which is suggested by the crab ratio .",
    "although the upper bound on @xmath77 is rather loose when considering the gso systematics , an @xmath78-test indicates that the data still prefer the `` cutoffpl '' model to the single power - law model , because the probability of the cutoff being insignificant is 4@xmath2910@xmath79 , even if we adopt the worst case of 2% under estimation of the background . if the correction factor descried by equation ( 1 ) is not incorporated , the requirement of the high energy cutoff by the hxd data for gro  j1655@xmath040 is even stronger .    with @xmath80 kev ,",
    "the `` cutoffpl '' model as determined above from the hxd data implies a slope of @xmath81 in the 110 kev range . this is smaller by @xmath11 than that determined by the xis ( @xmath82  3.4.1 )",
    "this reconfirms the inference obtained by inspecting the crab ratio (   3.2 , figure [ fig : crab_ratio ] ) , that hxd - pin measures a flatter slope than the xis .    as a consistency check",
    ", we repeated the same analysis using the hxd data , except that the model background was subtracted ( @xmath82  3.1 ) instead of the blank - sky data .",
    "the obtained parameters from this analysis are @xmath83 and @xmath84 kev . as expected from the good agreement between the two sets of backgrounds ( figure  [ fig : hxd_src_bkg_spec ] ) , neither the goodness of fit nor the best - fit parameters differ significantly between the two methods , reinforcing the reality of the high - energy cutoff .      following the above analysis ,",
    "we next jointly fitted the time - averaged xis and hxd ( pin and gso ) spectra .",
    "although it would be natural to employ a model consisting of `` diskbb '' and `` cutoffpl '' components , here a more physically consistent approach may be adopted .",
    "since the hard x - ray emission from bhbs in the low / hard state is generally interpreted as resulting from thermal comptonization of some soft photons by hot electrons with a temperature @xmath85 ( @xmath82  1 ) , we decided to represent the hard continuum with `` compps '' model @xcite in xspec , instead of the `` cutoffpl '' model .",
    "the `` compps '' code computes compton scattering in an exact manner incorporating the klein - nishina effect , and is known to accurately reproduce the wien peak particularly when the electron temperature is high .",
    "our new fitting model thus becomes `` diskbb+compps+gau '' , where the broad gaussian component around 6 kev ( @xmath82  3.4.1 ) is retained with its parameters left free .",
    "because the `` compps '' code allows us to use an optically - thick disk emission as a seed photon source generated at the center of the hot plasma , we substitute the `` diskbb '' temperature for this seed - photon temperature . then , the `` compps '' normalization , equivalent to the seed photon flux , becomes proportional to the square of innermost radius @xmath86 of the assumed seed disk , although this parameter , @xmath86 , can differ from the original @xmath87 .",
    "the implied picture is that a fraction [ @xmath88 of photons from a disk - blackbody source is directly observed as the soft excess , while the rest [ @xmath89 is injected into the comptonizing plasma . with the seed photon source thus specified , the `` compps '' model has two basic free parameters : one is @xmath85 , and the other is so - called compton @xmath12-parameter which is related to the optical depth @xmath90 by @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the electron rest mass energy . among several available geometries provided by `` compps '' , we chose a sphere ( parameter=4 ) , so as to make the comptonized spectrum independent of the inclination .",
    "we thus fitted this `` diskbb+compps+gau '' model jointly to the xis , hxd - pin , and hxd - gso spectra , again incorporating equation ( 1 ) for the gso data .",
    "the overall model normalization was allowed to take different values between the xis and hxd - pin , to `` absorb '' residual calibration uncertainties .",
    "in contrast , considering the results obtained in section  3.4.2 , and the fact that the gso scintillators are placed directly behind the pin diodes , we constrained the pin versus gso normalization to stay within @xmath24 10% of the nominal value determined from the crab spectra .",
    "this tolerance reflects the systematic gso background uncertainty of @xmath93 ( see appendix ) , which amounts to @xmath94 of the source flux in the pin / gso overlapping energy range . hereafter in this section , we show only the results using the blank - sky background , since the modeled background yields consistent results .",
    "as presented in figure  [ fig : broadbandspectrum]b , this `` diskbb+compps+gau '' model provided a rather poor joint fit to the three spectra , with @xmath95 ( table  2 ) .",
    "this is because the fit residuals for the pin and gso data are seen to rise toward higher energies , yielding @xmath96 if the jointly determined model is compared with the hxd data only .",
    "this again implies that the continuum slope above 10 kev is harder than that in the xis band , as found previously with the crab ratio and from the separate model - fitting of the xis ( @xmath97 ) and the hxd ( @xmath98 ) spectra .",
    "although the fit is unacceptable , the electron temperature obtained is @xmath99 kev , implying a cutoff energy of @xmath100 kev ( since the optical thickness of the `` compps '' is rather large ) , which is consistent with @xmath77 derived from the hxd data using the `` cutoffpl '' model .",
    "the `` diskbb '' parameters became different from those derived using the xis data only , because we replaced the power - law with a `` compps '' model .",
    "the failure of the above fit suggests the presence of a hard spectral hump , due to reflection from thick matter ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we therefore activated an option in the `` compps '' model , to include reflection of the comptonization continuum by a thin disk .",
    "we set free three parameters specifying the reflector ; the solid angle @xmath101 viewed from the photon source , its photo - ionization parameter @xmath102 in units of erg cm s@xmath4 , and its inner radius @xmath103 in units of @xmath104 where @xmath104 is schwarzschild radius .",
    "the reflector was assumed to have an outer radius of 1000 @xmath104 , and a radial emissivity profile of @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is the radius and @xmath107 is emissivity index @xcite .",
    "the remaining reflector parameters , namely the inclination angle , abundance , and temperature , were fixed at @xmath108 , 1 solar , and @xmath109 k , respectively . the broad gaussian line around 58  kev",
    "is included keeping the parameters free , which is here interpreted as an iron fluorescent line associated with the reflection emission .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : broadbandspectrum]c and table  2 , this `` diskbb+compps+reflection+gau '' model favored @xmath110 to represent the hard spectra in the hxd band .",
    "however , the fit was not improved significantly , with @xmath111 ( 0.7300 kev ) and 484/70 ( 10300 kev ) .",
    "the hard excess still remained above @xmath2 50 kev because the reflection hump can not become hard enough above several tens of kev .    to better reproduce the broad - band spectrum ,",
    "the model must predict a harder and slightly concave continuum . therefore , as in @xcite , we included an additional `` compps '' component , instead of the reflection component .",
    "the two `` compps '' components were assumed to share the same @xmath85 , but were allowed to have independent values of @xmath12 .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : broadbandspectrum]d and table  2 , this `` diskbb+compps+compps+gau '' model has improved the fit to @xmath112 and 85/70 in the total ( 0.7300 kev ) and the hxd ( 10300 kev ) band , respectively . with the electron temperature of @xmath113 kev , the obtained compton @xmath12-parameters , @xmath114 and @xmath115 , translate to optical depths of @xmath116 and @xmath117 , respectively .",
    "the gaussian component has an equivalent width of @xmath2110  ev .",
    "the above two-``compps '' model requires a broad gaussian , which is generally considered to be an indication of a reflection component .",
    "therefore , we further modified the model , assuming that the two `` compps '' components are both accompanied by reflection with a common set of reflection parameters .",
    "the obtained parameters are listed in table  2 , and the residuals from the best fit model are shown in figure [ fig : broadbandspectrum ] e. this `` diskbb+compps+compps+reflection+gau '' model gave @xmath118 ( 0.7300 kev ) and 67/70 ( 10300 kev ) .",
    "thus , the inclusion of the reflection component has significantly improved the fit , and makes it acceptable at the 90% confidence limit .",
    "also this reflection component may naturally explain the gaussian component .",
    "therefore , we adopt this model in the following part of this paper .",
    "the compton @xmath12-parameters , @xmath119 and @xmath115 , are almost the same as those from the `` diskbb+compps+compps+gau '' fit , but the obtained @xmath120 kev is twice as high , thus halving the optical depths to @xmath121 and @xmath116 respectively . as shown in figure  [ fig : fit_model ] , this fit implies a relatively strong reflection component with @xmath122 .",
    "this makes @xmath85 higher , because the spectral cutoff above @xmath28 kev is partially explained away by the turn - over intrinsic to the reflection component .      following the above analysis that was based on data averaged over the whole observation time , we applied the same `` diskbb+compps+compps+reflection+gau '' model separately to the first - half and second - half spectra , obtained in   3.3 by the xis and hxd - pin .",
    "( as noted before , we did not split the gso data into the two halves , and the pin data refer to those using the blank - sky background only . )",
    "the reflection parameters ( @xmath123 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 ) were fixed to the best - fit values of the average spectrum ( table  2 ) . as summarized in table  3",
    ", this model has successfully reproduced both spectra . as the 0.7300 kev source luminosity decreased by 10% , the two compton @xmath12-parameters stayed nearly constant , while @xmath85 increased marginally . the additional 8% decrease ( total @xmath124 ) fractional decrease of the flux below 3  kev ( figure  [ fig : ratio_half ] ) is driven solely by a decrease in the diskbb component , although the error of the luminosity of the disk component is large .",
    "although the xis data might be consistent with the presence of a broad ( @xmath125 kev ) iron line feature ( @xmath82  3.4.1 ) , much narrower emission / absorption lines are often observed from bhbs .",
    "we therefore searched the xis spectra for relatively narrow iron k absorption or emission features .",
    "figure  [ fig : ironlinespectrum ] shows an expanded view of the 58 kev portion of the xis spectra , where a power - law model with a broad gaussian mentioned in  3.4.1 was fitted to the data over this limited energy range . as is evident from the fit residuals plotted in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : ironlinespectrum ] , no narrow spectral features are present .",
    "we added another gaussian line to the model , allowing its normalization to have both positive and negative values . by fixing the centroid energy of the added gaussian at various trial values between 6.0 and 7.0 kev , we determined the allowed regions of its gaussian equivalent width ew .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig : ironlineeqwidth ] , where three cases of the gaussian intrinsic width were examined : 1 ev , 100 ev , and 200 ev in the gaussian standard deviation , based on the reports by @xcite ( @xmath126  ev , @xmath127  ev , and @xmath128  ev ) and @xcite ( @xmath28 ev ) .",
    "the allowed ews of positive ( emission line ) and negative ( absorption line ) features , at the 90% confidence level , are less than 20  ev and 23  ev , respectively , for an intrinsic width of 200  ev . if we consider the energy range above 6.4 kev , the upper limits of the ew are @xmath2 20  ev and @xmath2 15  ev for the emission and the absorption features , respectively .",
    "we have presented high - quality broad - band ( 0.7300 kev ) energy spectra of the black hole candidate gro j1655@xmath040 , obtained with suzaku in a decay phase of the 2005 outburst .",
    "employing the distance of 3.2 kpc and assuming isotropic emission , the 0.7300 kev luminosity at the time of our observation ( estimated using the `` diskbb+compps+compps+reflection+gau '' model ) becomes @xmath129 erg s@xmath4 , equivalent to @xmath2 0.7% of @xmath13 for a 6 @xmath6 black hole .",
    "the spectra are dominated by a power - law like continuum , implying that the object was in a typical low / hard state .",
    "the continuum is approximated by a photon index of @xmath130 and @xmath131 at energies below and above @xmath2 10 kev , respectively , together with a high - energy cutoff around an energy of @xmath10 kev .",
    "the spectra do not exhibit narrow iron emission or absorption lines in the 58 kev band , but they do show a weak soft excess .",
    "the continuum can not be reproduced by a single thermal compton model with disk reflection , but can be explained successfully by two thermal - comptonization components having a common @xmath85 and different optical depths , both accompanied by reflection with @xmath132 .",
    "below , we discuss these spectral characteristics .",
    "thanks to the high capability of suzaku , we have shown that the high - energy spectrum of gro  j1655@xmath040 gradually deviates above @xmath28 kev from a single power - law , exhibiting a high - energy cutoff effect that can be represented by an exponential factor with @xmath133 kev ( or @xmath134  kev , if we include a maximum systematic error ) .",
    "this reconfirms the rxte and integral detection of a similar effect with @xmath135 kev , that was made in an early stage of the same outburst @xcite . at that time",
    "the object was also in the low / hard state , with a similar luminosity of @xmath136 erg s@xmath4 .",
    "these two independent observations firmly establish the presence of a high - energy cutoff in the low / hard state spectrum of gro j1655@xmath040 .",
    "although the presence of a high - energy cutoff supports the thermal compton scenario , the observed 380 kev continuum exhibits a concave shape in a log - log plot , in contradiction to a prediction of a simple comptonization scenario that the continuum should have a constant logarithmic slope at energies @xmath137 .",
    "the discrepancy can not be attributed to reflection by cold or partially ionized material , since it can produce a concave curvature only up to @xmath43 kev .",
    "instead , two thermal - comptonization components ( both modeled by `` compps '' ) , with different compton @xmath12-parameters , have successfully explained the 0.7300 kev spectra over the entire energy band ( except for the subtle soft excess ) . as shown in figure  [ fig : fit_model ] ,",
    "the flatter continuum in the hxd - pin band is explained by the component with the larger compton @xmath12-parameter ( @xmath138 ) that has a flatter photon index of @xmath139 , whereas the continuum steepening by @xmath140@xmath141 @xmath11 in the xis band is explained by the addition of the component with the smaller compton @xmath12-parameter ( @xmath142 ) that has a steeper photon index of @xmath143 .",
    "of course , there remains a possibility that the two values of @xmath12 are representing more complex , for example continuous , distributions in the @xmath12-parameter .    in our double-@xmath12 modeling",
    ", we assumed for simplicity that the two compton components have the same @xmath85 .",
    "this does not however rule out the possibility that they have different values of @xmath85 , since the component with smaller @xmath12 contributes little to the gso energy range , and hence its high - energy curvature remains poorly constrained .",
    "the empirical modeling with multiple ( at least two ) comptonized continuum components allow two alternative physical interpretations .",
    "one is a spatial variation , in which an extended seed - photon source is covered by a hot electron cloud for which the optical depth varies with position ; the two components differ in their spatial location but arise effectively simultaneously in time . the other is a temporal variation , in which the optical depth of the hot electron cloud varies on short timescales between , for example , two representative values , so that a time - averaged spectrum would be composed of a superposition of the individual components . the true physics may well be a mixture of these two extreme cases . for further elucidation , we need to study intensity - correlated spectral changes on various timescales . for example , according to @xcite , the 160 kev spectrum of cyg x-1 acquired with ginga softens around the peak of x - ray `` shots '' , namely rapid x - ray flaring ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this sort of investigation , however , is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "the existence of two compton components with different @xmath12-parameters was previously reported from cyg x-1 in a low / hard state observed with bepposax @xcite , when the 0.5200 kev luminosity was @xmath144 erg s@xmath4 . employing the same `` compps '' modeling , these authors measured the compton parameters of cyg x-1 as @xmath145 and @xmath146 , together with @xmath99 kev .",
    "the implied optical depths are @xmath147 and @xmath148 .",
    "thus , the double-@xmath12 modeling has been successful on both these objects , and has yielded roughly similar sets of spectral parameters except for minor differences .    compared with these values for cyg x-1 ,",
    "the two @xmath12-parameters of gro  j1655@xmath040 observed with suzaku , particularly @xmath149 , are considerably larger .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the fact that the bepposax spectrum of cyg x-1 is steeper than that of gro  j1655@xmath040 obtained with suzaku .",
    "the difference in @xmath12 can be attributed to the higher electron temperature of gro  j1655@xmath040 ( 140 kev ) , than that of cyg x-1 observed with bepposax ( 60 kev ) .",
    "this difference in @xmath85 , in turn , may arise because cyg x-1 was by a factor of 4 more luminous than gro  1655@xmath040 .",
    "in fact , it has been observed in other bhbs ( e.g. , esin et al .",
    "1998 ; yamaoka et al .",
    "2005 ) that @xmath85 decreases with the increasing luminosity , presumably due to the enhanced coronal cooling .",
    "this tendency , though marginal , is visible even between the two halves of the present data of gro  1655@xmath040 .",
    "however , this mechanism alone may not be sufficient to produce the observed temperature difference , since the two objects are implied to have relatively similar luminosities when normalized to their eddington luminosity , given the mass of @xmath150 of gro  j1655@xmath040 and @xmath151 of cyg x-1 @xcite .    in spite of the rather extreme edge - on inclination , gro  j1655@xmath040",
    "are inferred to have comparable , or even smaller , compton optical depths ( 1.2 and 0.25 , if we adopt @xmath152 kev for both the comptonizing clouds . )",
    "than cyg x-1 ( 1.9 and 0.5 ) .",
    "this would not happen if the comptonizing cloud had an oblate geometry extending along the disk plane .",
    "therefore , the relation between the two objects is consistent with the generally accepted view that the comptonizing cloud has a relatively large scale height perpendicular to the disk plane , so that the emergent hard x - rays are approximately isotropic .",
    "we have so far ascribed the spectral difference between gro  j1655@xmath040 and cyg x-1 to their differences either in the inclination angles or in the luminosities . in reality , both these effects can be operating , that would cause gro  j1655@xmath040 to have larger @xmath12-parameters . although this subject is important in constructing a unified picture of bhbs in the low / hard state , further examination of it is beyond the scope of the present paper .      in the present analysis",
    ", we have assumed that the two `` compps '' ( comptonized continuum ) components are both supplied with seed photons by `` diskbb '' sources that have a common @xmath153 .",
    "taking a quadratic sum of the two `` compps '' normalizations ( table  2 ) , the innermost disk radius of the seed photon source is obtained as @xmath154 km .",
    "the xis spectra require an additional soft - excess component to be added to the power - law continuum (   3.4.1 ) .",
    "we also expressed it in terms of a simple `` diskbb '' model , and required it to have the same innermost temperature as the seed photon disk .",
    "this modeling has yielded @xmath155 km together with @xmath156 0.18 kev .",
    "( although this error region of @xmath87 includes no-diskbb  assumption , the spectrum of the first half ( table  3 ) requires significant `` diskbb '' component . )",
    "therefore , based on the assumption made in   3.4.3 , substantial part of the cool accretion disk",
    "is thought to be covered by the comptonizing cloud , while the remaining part [ @xmath88 is directly visible as the soft excess .",
    "the overall innermost radius then becomes @xmath157 km , as a quadrature sum of @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "assuming an inclination angle of @xmath158 @xcite , the physical size of the innermost disk radius becomes @xmath2 100 km , or @xmath159 for a black hole of 6@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the estimated disk radius is a factor of 47 larger than the values inferred from observations of this object in the high / soft state @xcite .",
    "as argued so far , the `` diskbb '' interpretation of the soft excess leads to a view that the optically - thick disk has retreated outwards , by up to an order of magnitude in radius , compared to its location during the high / soft state .",
    "this is consistent with the general picture regarding the relation between these two states .",
    "nevertheless , the estimated inner radius of the cool disk is small enough to suggest that a considerable fraction of seed photons to the compnotization process is provided by the inner region of the cool disk which is immersed in the hot corona .",
    "then , the compton cloud would be cooled by its own radiation , which are intercepted by the cool disk , reprocessed there , and re - emitted into the cloud .",
    "in such a case , the photon index of the comptonized component is expected to become @xmath160 ( haardt & maraschi 1993 ) , though depending on the ratio of energy inputs to the disk and the hot cloud ( gilfanov et al .",
    "since we observed a much flatter continuum ( @xmath161 ) , some modification to the scenario might be needed ( e.g. , beloborodov 1999 ) .",
    "although the `` diskbb '' modeling of the soft excess gives a natural and self - consistent interpretation , it may be explained in alternative ways .",
    "for example , the excess may result from scattering of the soft part of the continuum by interstellar dust grains .",
    "actually , @xcite detected a dust scattering halo around gro j1655@xmath040 , and @xcite reported changes in the intensity of the scattered component in 24 hours . yet",
    "another possibility is that the soft excess is intrinsic to the hard continuum itself , and produced , for example , by the `` shots '' mentioned in the previous section (   4.1 ) .",
    "then , the observed change in the soft excess intensity could be attributed to variations in the average shot rate .",
    "the broad emission structure at 58 kev has an equivalent width of @xmath162  ev , when modeled with `` diskbb+compps+compps+reflection+gau '' .",
    "the reflection component in the `` compps '' model does not include fe - k line emission so the broad feature in the data is being modeled by both the complexity in the reflection component and the fluorescent iron lines , presumably smeared by the disk motion .    in previous observations of gro  j1655@xmath040 made in the high / soft state ,",
    "narrow fe - k absorption lines were detected repeatedly , with equivalent widths of , for example , 61@xmath163 ev @xcite , 60110 ev @xcite , and 6080 ev ( fe xxv+fe xxvi ; @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast , the present suzaku observation conducted in the low / hard state has shown that any such feature has to have an equivalent width @xmath164 ev , which is considerably smaller than values observed in the high / soft state .",
    "the present upper limit on the fe xxv k@xmath165 line equivalent width constrains the column density of the corresponding ions to @xmath166 @xmath31 from a curve of growth @xcite , assuming that the absorbing plasma has a temperature of 0.1 kev .",
    "this value is more than an order of magnitude lower than that estimated in the high / soft state .",
    "further , considering that the detections of fe - k absorption line features from bhbs ( including gro  j1655@xmath040 itself ) have all been achieved in the high / soft state , the present non - detection can be most naturally attributed to the fact that the source was in the low / hard state .    in the high / soft state ,",
    "the fe - k absorption features are considered to be formed by a highly ionized absorber , that is located at a distance of ( 510 ) @xmath167  cm @xcite , or @xmath168 cm @xcite from the central black hole .",
    "it is suggested that such a line - forming absorber , present in the high / soft state , undergoes significant geometrical and/or physical changes when the system makes a transition into the low / hard state .",
    "then , the absorber may become either fully ionized from illumination by the intense x - rays , or too tenuous ( for unknown reasons ) , or too turbulent , so that the formed line features are smeared out .",

    "namely , that from a blank - sky observation and that from modeled background , since our data analysis was begun before the modeled background was available",

    "the latter subtraction method , using a background model , has been developed by the hxd instrument team and the detailed properties of the modeling are described in another paper .",
    "as described in @xmath82  3.1 , the source flux of gro  j1655@xmath040 is so high that the systematic error of the pin background is considered to be negligible . on the other hand ,",
    "since the background of the gso detector is higher than that of the pin , and the flux from celestial objects becomes fainter in the higher energy band , the source signal of gro  j1655@xmath040 is 25% and 10% of the background flux in the 40100 kev and 100300 kev bands , respectively .",

    "note that the flux of the cosmic x - ray background is 2 - 3 orders of magnitude smaller than that of the gso background , and it is negligible .",
    "there are five components that affect the estimate of the gso background spectrum in the gro  j1655 - 40 analysis @xcite : ( 1 ) a component with a constant flux , namely natural radioactive isotopes included in the detector ; ( 24 ) components from radio - activated sources that are accumulated through the passages of the south atlantic anomaly ( saa ) and have half - lives longer than a day [ denoted as `` long - nuclides '' in @xcite ] , from @xmath2 100 min to a day ( `` middle - nuclides '' ) , and of @xmath42 100 min ( `` short - nuclides '' ) , and ( 5 ) a component that changes in magnitude due to the flux of cosmic - ray particles , depending on the cut - off rigidity ( cor ) .",

    "the flux of component ( 3 ) changes moderately on a timescale of days , reflecting the number of high energy particles irradiated during saa passages .",

    "the background variation in the latter half of figure  [ fig : app_lc_bd30 ] is caused by a difference in the cor @xcite , and it is considered that component ( 5 ) constitutes @xmath2  10% and @xmath2  5% of the total flux in the background in the 40100 kev and 100300 kev energy band respectively .",
    "see @xcite for details of the cor dependence .",
    "figure  [ fig : app_dist_cor ] compares the cor distributions between the gro j1655@xmath040 and bd+30@xmath403639 observations .",
    "the distributions for the two cases are very similar , with average values of 11.9 and 11.7 gv , respectively .",
    "the total of the difference of the exposure time in every cor bin is @xmath2 600 s , which is @xmath2 3% of the total observation time ( @xmath2 20 ks ) .",
    "even if the differences in the background flux for these terms are all 10% of the total background flux in the 40100 kev band , the systematic error induced by component ( 5 ) is considered to be @xmath174 of the total background in the 40100 kev band .",
    "similarly , the error is @xmath175 in the 100300 kev band .    from the above discussion ,",
    "the systematic errors in the gro  j1655@xmath040 background obtained from the bd+30@xmath403639 dataset are summarized for each component as ( 1 ) @xmath42 0.1% , ( 2 ) + 0.3% , ( 3 ) -1.2% , ( 4 ) -0.7% over 40100 kev and -0.4% over 100300 kev , and ( 5 ) at most -0.3% over 40100 kev and -0.2% over 100300 kev , where the symbol `` + '' represents an under - subtraction and the `` - '' symbol indicates over - subtraction .",
    "therefore , adding up all the components , the total systematic error of the current background is thought to be at most -1.9% and -1.5% in the 40100 kev and 100300 kev bands respectively .    in order to confirm this estimation , we additionally examined three sets of gso backgrounds obtained during two successive days near the gro  j1655@xmath040 observation .",
    "namely , a bd+30@xmath403639 observation on 2005 september 21 and a hess  j1616 - 508 observation on 2005 september 20 , an rx  j1713 - 39 observation on 2005 september 26 and 25 , and a continuous observation of the same source on 2005 september 28 and 27 .",
    "all the datasets were obtained in the same declining phase of the 50-day cycle of the pin - ud modulation .",
    "we extracted the spectra by the same method as in @xmath82  3.1 , and we also subtracted the background of the previous day from that of the next day .",
    "the result shows that the differences between the two observations are all within -1.9  @xmath2  + 1.5% and -0.9  @xmath2  0.0% of the count rate in the 40100 kev and 100300 kev bands respectively .",
    "following the estimation and the result , we assume the peak - to - peak systematic error of the one - day average gso background spectrum obtained from the adjacent dataset is @xmath242% in the present gro  j1655@xmath040 analysis , although the error in the 100300 kev band could be smaller by about a half .",
    "this 2% background uncertainty results in 8% and 20% systematic errors in the gro  j1655@xmath040 source spectrum in the 40100 kev and 100300 kev bands respectively , since the source signal is 25% and 10% respectively of the background flux in these energy bands .",
