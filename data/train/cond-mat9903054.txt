    "the size dependence of the magnetoresistance observed by giordano @xcite in thin films of dilute magnetic alloys above the kondo temperature may play a decisive role in the understanding the behavior of such small systems . in the recent decades the studies of magnetic impurities ,",
    "i.e. fe , cr , mn in non - magnetic host metals ( au , ag , cu ) have attracted considerable interest .",
    "@xcite these studies have recently been extended to small systems by measuring their resistivity @xcite and thermopower @xcite .",
    "the challenging motivation of these studies has been the possibility that the size dependence of the kondo effect in thin films and wires might give some information on the size of the spin compensation cloud formed by the conduction electrons , which is responsible for the formation of the magnetic singlet ground state @xcite .",
    "that possibility is ruled out as the kondo impurity experiences only the level spacing of the conduction electrons at the impurity site @xcite , thus there is no such effect except of very small granular samples .",
    "furthermore , there are experiments where no size dependence occurs @xcite .",
    "recently , two attempts have been made to explain the size dependence : ( i ) static disorder proposed by martin , wan and phillips @xcite ( ii ) surface spin anisotropy for magnetic impurities due to spin - orbit interaction between the nonmagnetic host atoms and electrons .",
    "these two suggestions can be applied in the opposite limits , namely in the dirty and ballistic regions .    if the normal vector of the surface is @xmath1 , then the anisotropy energy @xmath2 is @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the spin operator of the impurity spin and @xmath5 is the strength of the anisotropy which depends on the distance , @xmath6 of the impurity measured from the surface .",
    "the suggested spin anisotropy nearby the surface hinders the spin dynamics , thus it can affect the amplitude of the kondo effect , but for integer and half - integer impurity spins in different ways @xcite .",
    "the occurance of that anisotropy is independent of the kondo effect as it can be obtained by straightforward perturbation theory without any logarithmic corrections . at the same time",
    "the evidences are growing for the size dependence but only in the temperature region governed by the kondo effect @xcite .    in order to clarify the relevance of the magnetic surface anisotropy giordano",
    "@xcite measured the magnetoresistance of thin gold films of thickness @xmath7 and @xmath8 with @xmath9 fe impurities . at @xmath10 , above the kondo temperature @xmath11 he found an essential difference in the magnetic field dependence of the resistivity by measuring these two samples . that challenging phenomena was attributed by him to the surface anisotropy .",
    "the basic idea is that due to the strong spin - orbit scattering of the conduction electrons on the non - magnetic host atoms a magnetic anisotropy is developed for the magnetic ions nearby the surface .",
    "the magnetic scattering ( exchange ) of the conduction electrons by the impurity ion has a strong angular dependence as the scattered waves are d - type , which are hybridized with the localized magnetic d - orbitals of the impurity .",
    "the scattered waves traveling through the samples suffer spin - dependent scatterings due to the spin - orbit scattering .",
    "as far as the host atom scatterers are in the ballistic region measured from the magnetic ion , the scattering amplitudes for spin - flip and spin - conserving scatterings depend on the angular momenta of the conduction electron wave functions . in this way the magnetic impurity receives information about the positions of the host atoms , thus the geometry of the sample in the ballistic region around the host atom .",
    "the phase information is lost outside the ballistic region .",
    "that phenomenon results in forming of a surface magnetic anisotropy , @xmath5 which depends inversely on the distance @xmath6 measured from the surface , @xmath12 and exhibits the anisotropy axis perpendicular to the surface .",
    "the anisotropic energy is @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the normal direction of the surface , and @xmath15 is the @xmath14-component of the spin .",
    "recently that results has been generalized by fomin _ et.al .",
    "_ @xcite for arbitrary geometry of the sample and the actual calculation has been performed for a sample of slat shape , also .",
    "concerning the boundary conditions they have shown that a moderate roughness of the surface even may enhance the anisotropy .    in the magnetoresistance experiments on bulk samples",
    "as the magnetic field increases the level spacing of magnetic atomic levels become larger thus as the magnetic energy exceeds the temperature the spin - flip electron scattering is gradually frozen out and only the lowest level is occupied .",
    "that effect is very sensitive on the actual level spacing of the atomic levels as a function of the magnetic field .",
    "considering a magnetic atom in the neighborhood of the surface an essential level splitting occurs even without magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the magnetic field splits these levels further",
    ". the magnetic field saturating the magnetoresistance for a given temperature can be much larger as the energy of the lowest level only occupied in high field is shifted upwards by the surface anisotropy relatively to the others , see fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] .    carrying out that calculation a conceptional",
    "problem arises . in the derivation of the surface",
    "anisotropy the anderson model had to be used with nonzero angular momentum of the localized @xmath6-level . only in case of spin @xmath16 the orbital momentum is quenched , thus for @xmath17 a more general hamiltonian must be used as it is discussed e.g. by nozires and blandin@xcite but that is actually a hopeless task , because of the large number of terms and couplings . here",
    "we follow the simplification applied in ref.@xcite and @xcite , where we kept a simple spin hamiltonian with only one orbital channel for the conduction electrons but the anisotropy obtained for @xmath16 is generalized for arbitrary spin .",
    "there is no reason to believe that the saturation can not be demonstrated in that simplified model even if details and the value of the kondo exchange coupling value are somewhat changed .",
    "the present paper is devoted to calculate the magnetoresistance of thin films taking into account the magnetic surface anisotropy in the ballistic region for integer and half - integer impurity spins .",
    "fitting the data obtained from au(fe ) films by giordano @xcite the strength of the surface anisotropy is determined .",
    "that anisotropy strength is compared with the value estimated from the size dependence of the kondo resistivity @xcite .",
    "they are found in the same order of magnitude and their difference which is about a factor four can be easily accounted for the difference in the mean free path due to the different sample preparations or to the different surface roughness@xcite .",
    "finally it should be emphasized that the calculation is carried out in the lowest nonvanishing order of perturbation theory ignoring any corrections of higher order of kondo type which is justified if the temperature @xmath18 is much higher than the kondo temperature . in the case of giordano s experiment@xcite @xmath19 and @xmath11 . in that case",
    "the measured resistivity shows logarithmic dependence and size effect as well .",
    "the size dependence of the magnetoresistance is twice as strong as in case of the logarithmic part of the resistivity .",
    "( see ref .",
    "@xcite fig .",
    "that indicates that the size dependence of the magnetoresistance can not be explained simply by the size dependence of the logarithmic coefficient @xmath20 of the resistivity replacing @xmath21 by @xmath22 where @xmath23 is in the order of unity and @xmath24 is the magnetic field@xcite .",
    "the magnetoresistance for infinite system was calculated many years ago by abrikosov in the leading logarithmic approximation@xcite , where @xmath23 can not be determined .",
    "as far as we know no major improvement has been achieved since that .",
    "thus a calculation , where the surface anisotropy and the kondo term in the next to leading logarithmic approximation as in ref .",
