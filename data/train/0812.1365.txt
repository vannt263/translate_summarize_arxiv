    "in the @xmath2 expansion method @xcite the ground state baryons have an approximate su(2@xmath3 ) symmetry when the number of colors @xmath1 is large but finite .",
    "this stems from the property that when @xmath4 the su(2@xmath3 ) is an exact contracted symmetry @xcite and in that limit the baryons are degenerate . at large but finite @xmath1 the mass splitting starts at order @xmath2 for the ground or excited symmetric states and at order @xmath5 for mixed symmetric states .    here we consider light baryons with @xmath6 , thus we deal with su(6 ) symmetry . in this case",
    "the building blocks of the mass operator are the generators of su(6 ) . for the excited states the symmetry",
    "is extended to su(6 ) @xmath7 so(3 ) .",
    "therefore the generators of so(3 ) also appear in the mass formula .",
    "the study of excited states of symmetric orbital symmetry is straightforward .",
    "however the study of excited states of mixed orbital symmetry , or equivalently mixed spin - flavor symmetry , presented so far some difficulty related to the fact the matrix elements of su(6 ) generators between mixed symmetric @xmath0 $ ] spin - flavor states were unknown . accordingly , a method based on the separation of a system of @xmath1 quarks into a symmetric `` core '' of @xmath8 quarks and an excited quark was proposed @xcite and applied to the @xmath9 $ ] and @xmath10 $ ] ( @xmath11 ) multiplets , for @xmath12 @xcite and @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the orbital - spin - flavor wave function describing such a decoupled system is not totally symmetric , as it should be .",
    "its approximate form is explained at large in ref .",
    "in addition , to match the decoupling , in ref .",
    "@xcite each generator of su(@xmath14 ) was written as a sum of two terms , one acting on the core and the other on the excited quark . as a consequence ,",
    "the number of linearly independent operators appearing in the mass formula increases and the number of coefficients to be determined generally becomes larger or nearly as large as the number of the experimental data available .",
    "for example , for the @xmath9 $ ] multiplet with @xmath6 one has at least 15 linearly independent operators up to order @xmath2 included @xcite and 7 known masses",
    ". then one must select the most dominant operators , which is a very difficult task , not free from ambiguities @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we have proposed a new approach where the separation of the system into a symmetric core of @xmath8 quarks and an excited quark can be avoided .",
    "the approach was restricted to @xmath3 = 2 . in this way",
    "the number of linearly independent operators was substantially reduced .",
    "in addition the method has important physical consequences .",
    "we have shown for example that the term containing the isospin - isospin interaction in the mass formula of @xmath15 , neglected in all previous applications , becomes as dominant as the pure spin - spin term in @xmath16 . to obtain such results the matrix elements of the generators of su(4 ) were needed .",
    "general analytic expression were available from nuclear physics studies @xcite .",
    "it was easy enough to adjust them to a system of @xmath1 quarks .",
    "let us explain the previous situation in detail . in the scheme based on the separation of the system into a symmetric core of @xmath8 quarks and an excited quark",
    "the su(2)-isospin casimir operator was written as @xmath17 , where the lower index @xmath18 refers to the core , and decomposed into three independent pieces , corresponding to the terms in the above decomposition . in su(4 ) @xmath19 and @xmath20 have identical matrix elements because the spin and isospin states of a symmetric core are identical , so that @xmath19 can be neglected . but",
    "@xmath21 has different matrix elements from @xmath22 as one can clearly see from table ii of ref . @xcite .",
    "then in the decoupling scheme the isospin can be introduced only through @xmath21 . in ref .",
    "@xcite table vi we have shown that the introduction of the operators @xmath23 together with @xmath24 and @xmath25 separately deteriorates the fit .",
    "this may explain why @xmath23 has been avoided in previous numerical fits both in su(4 ) @xcite and in su(6 ) @xcite .",
    "we avoided it as well @xcite in line with our predecessors . to extend the application of the method of ref .",

    "the remaining problem is to derive the matrix elements of @xmath34 .",
    "the su(6 ) generators are the components of an irreducible tensor operator which transform according to the adjoint representation @xmath35 $ ] , equivalent to @xmath36 , in dimensional notation .",
    "there are several ways to calculate the matrix elements of the su(6 ) generators . in the standard group theory",
    "the matrix elements of any irreducible tensor can be expressed in terms of a generalized wigner - eckart theorem which is a factorization theorem , involving the product between a reduced matrix element and a clebsch - gordan ( cg ) coefficient .",

    "the latter is the quantity we derive here .    in the 60ties",
    "the literature provided a few examples of isoscalar factors needed in particle physics , thus for @xmath37 .",
    "cook and murtanza @xcite considered the full cg series of the direct products @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "carter , coyne and meshkov @xcite derived the isoscalar factors for @xmath41 independently from schlke @xcite who also calculated the isoscalar factors for @xmath42 like cook and murtanza .",

    "@xcite , ( see eq .",
    "( [ reduced ] ) below ) , which simplifies the problem , in the sense that we obtain vanishing su(6 ) isoscalar factors for the products @xmath53 while carter and coyne obtain non - vanishing values for the isoscalar factors for these products .",

    "such ambiguities are typical for all groups , including the permutation group , whenever the multiplicity in the cg series is larger than one @xcite .",

    "they are expressed in terms of @xmath1 and the spin of the total system which is fixed for each multiplet , namely 1/2 , 3/2 , 1/2 and 1/2 respectively .",
    "the values of the spin are consistent with the label of the corresponding su(3 ) irreducible representation @xmath94 as illustrated by the examples ( [ decupletch52])-([singletch52 ] ) , _ i.e. _ one has @xmath144 and @xmath145 for all the multiplets .",
    "the index @xmath48 is specified whenever necessary , with its two distinct values 1 and 2 .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^ , < \" , ]     the order of @xmath146 and @xmath147 follow from the arguments given in ref",
    "accordingly , unlike the case of two light flavors , the matrix elements of the flavor generators @xmath30 and spin - flavor generators @xmath34 do not have the same @xmath1 dependence everywhere in the flavor weight diagram .",
    "the baryons under concern , located at the top of an su(3 ) weight diagram , therefore having finite strangeness , have matrix elements of @xmath30 which are of order @xmath148 , @xmath149 and @xmath150 for @xmath151 @xmath152 and @xmath153 respectively and matrix elements of @xmath34 which are @xmath150 , @xmath149 and @xmath148 .",
    "then the corresponding combinations give for @xmath146 and @xmath147 the order @xmath5 and @xmath154 respectively .",
    "@xmath155 is of course of order @xmath156 .",
    "the contribution of so(3 ) , is first manifested in the operator @xmath157 which represents the spin - orbit coupling where @xmath158 and @xmath29 are the total angular momentum and spin components . in applications one can also use the hartree approximation @xcite which is a one - body operator .",
    "this approximation is useful because it shows that the leading order of the spin - orbit contribution is @xmath5 .",
    "lastly , the operator @xmath159 contains the so(3 ) 2nd rank tensor , defined as @xmath160 which , like @xmath158 , acts on the orbital wave function @xmath161 of the whole system of @xmath1 quarks .",
    "in su(4 ) the practice on the @xmath9 $ ] multiplet @xcite showed that the operators @xmath162 , @xmath163 , @xmath164 ( defined as @xmath165 ) and @xmath147 are the most dominant .",
    "a problem is to find out if this behavior also holds in su(6 ) .",
    "also one has to reanalyze the @xmath10 $ ] multiplet , studied so far in the decoupling scheme only @xcite .",
    "applications to baryons belonging to the @xmath166 $ ] multiplets will be considered in subsequent studies .",
    "we should finally mention , that the method based on the separation of the system into a symmetric core of @xmath8 quarks and an excited quark , as first used in ref .",
    "@xcite , acquired some support from the work of pirjol and schat  @xcite , based on a large @xmath1 quark model hamiltonian , where explicit results for the coefficients @xmath167 are presented both for the one gluon exchange ( oge ) and for the goldstone boson exchange ( gbe ) hyperfine interactions , with radial dependent form factors .",
    "an extension of the study of collins and georgi @xcite from @xmath37 to large @xmath1 is obtained in this way .",
    "including the space degree of freedom , pirjol and schat decompose the two - body operators into tensor operators transforming as s , ms and e representations of @xmath61 ( the latter exists only for @xmath168 ) .",
    "moreover , the splitting of the su(4 ) generators into two pieces ( see introduction ) , @xmath169 , @xmath170 and @xmath171 , matches the choice of their basis states . the conclusion of ref .",
    "@xcite was that the inclusion of core and excited quark operators is necessary , at variance with our simplified procedure .",
    "a useful result is that pirjol and schat obtain a large @xmath1 dependence similar to that of the @xmath2 expansion method . the tower structure , first observed in the n = 1 band in ref .",
    "@xcite , is satisfied at leading order in @xmath2 .",
    "the resulting mass formula contains 6 independent non - vanishing coefficients at order @xmath2 both for oge and for gbe .",
    "they have to be found by fitting the 7 resonance masses available in the n = 1 band .",
    "therefore some arbitrariness is imposed in combining oge with gbe . in general",
    ", the arbitrariness could lead to anomalies , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite .    on the other hand in the method based on the quark model hamiltonian ,",
    "the operator @xmath172 is absent , but present in our case , see table [ operators ] . in ref .",
    "@xcite we have shown that such an operator brings a dominant contribution to most of the nucleon masses in the n = 1 band . according to ref .",
    "@xcite this absence is allowed in su(4 ) but , as explicitly stated there , for more than two flavors a term like @xmath173 , should be included in the mass operator .",
    "thus the extension to su(6 ) of the work of pirjol and schat could , at least in this respect , raise problems .",
    "the basic difference between our work and that of pirjol and schat is the radial dependence is integrated out in our case , consistent with the @xmath2 expansion method . when there is no radial dependence , the spin - spin operator is symmetric .",
    "the quadrupole operator of the quark model makes its presence through its symmetric part , which is related to the 2nd - rank so(3 ) operator ( [ tensor ] ) , as in the work of collins and georgi @xcite , or of carlson et al .",
    "@xcite and as in subsequent studies .",
    "so far , in applications , the spin - orbit term was treated in the hartree approximation . in this context ,",
    "our operator basis is complete inasmuch as the orbital part is always symmetric , thus the flavour - spin part should be symmetric too , so we have only @xmath174 matrix elements in the flavour - spin space .",
    "the differences between the two methods should be confronted in future applications to nonstrange and strange baryons , from where one wishes to obtain meaningful physical information on the coefficients @xmath167 .",
    "the isoscalar factors of the su(6 ) generators derived in this study opens new applications of the @xmath2 expansion method to baryons spectroscopy .",
    "it allows to combine data on non - strange and strange baryons together and to lead to a more precise determination of the coefficients @xmath167 and @xmath175 which encode the qcd dynamics .",
    "finally , our results presented in tables i - iv , can be used for other @xmath16-body problems governed by su(6 ) symmetry and where the spin is known .                  c. l. schat , j. l. goity and n. n. scoccola , phys .",
