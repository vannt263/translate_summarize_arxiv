    "the sunyaev - zeldovich effect ( sze ) is a spectral distortion in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) due to inverse compton scattering of the cmb photons off hot electrons ; at radio frequencies this distortion is manifested as a fractional decrement in intensity of order @xmath8 . for over two decades",

    "this yields an orientation - unbiased sample , and departures from spherical symmetry in individual clusters will average out in the determination of @xmath10 from the sample as a whole .",
    "myers obtain a hubble constant of @xmath11 from observations of four clusters .",
    "the accuracy of this result is limited by a 7% radio calibration uncertainty and estimated 15 - 30% x - ray model uncertainties for each cluster .",
    "in this letter we present an improved measurement of @xmath0 based on the herbig and myers results on coma , a478 , a2142 , and a2256 , plus observations of three new clusters ( a399 , a401 , a1651 ) from their complete sample .",

    "altogether we have a systematic error budget of @xmath174 , or @xmath175 for @xmath169 .    the increase in @xmath0 relative to the myers result",

    "see mm2000 for more discussion of this analysis .",
    "also the @xmath42 values we have used tend to be higher than the myers values due to the correction for the spectral bias of the cooling flows . using the myers temperatures increases the fractional scatter in the @xmath0 values by over a factor of two and decreases the sample mean to @xmath178 .",
    "the fact that the uncertainty in our result is comparable to that of myers  in spite of improved x - ray models , better calibration , and 3 more clusters is due to our inclusion of intrinsic anisotropy in the analysis .",
