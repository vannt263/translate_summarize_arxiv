    "in @xcite , falk and randell introduced the notion of a formal arrangement .",
    "an arrangement is formal iff every linear dependency among the defining forms of the hyperplanes can be expressed as linear combination of dependencies among exactly 3 defining forms .",
    "many interesting classes of arrangements are formal : in @xcite , falk and randell proved that @xmath7 arrangements and arrangements with quadratic orlik - solomon ideal are formal and , in @xcite , yuzvinsky showed that free arrangements are also formal ; and gave an example showing that formality does not depend on the intersection lattice . in @xcite , brandt and terao generalized the notion of formality to @xmath0formality , proving that every free arrangement is @xmath0formal . for this they introduced the concept of higher relation spaces , which capture the dependencies among dependencies.    in the first section of this paper we briefly recall the notions of relation spaces and @xmath0formality . by rewriting the definitions",
    ", we obtain a lemma characterizing @xmath0formality topologically .",
    "then we apply this criteria for graphic arrangements to obtain a description of @xmath0formality in terms of the homology of a certain chain complex . with this",
    "it is easy to produce examples of graphic arrangements which are @xmath0formal but not @xmath8formal , for any given @xmath9 .",
    "in what follows we adopt all the notation from @xcite .",
    "let @xmath10 be an arrangement of @xmath11 hyperplanes in a vector space @xmath12 over a field @xmath13 . for each @xmath14",
    "we fix the defining form @xmath15 .",
    "define a map @xmath16 , by @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the vector space with basis @xmath19 .",
    "let @xmath20 be the kernel of this map",
    ". then @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the rank of @xmath10 .",
    "the vector space @xmath20 describes which linear forms are linearly dependent , as well as the dependency coefficients ( up to scalar multiplication )",
    ". we will refer to elements of @xmath20 as _",
    "let @xmath23 be the subspace of @xmath20 generated by the relations corresponding to dependencies of exactly 3 linear forms .",
    "@xmath10 is formal iff @xmath24 .    for @xmath25",
    ", recursively define @xmath26 to be the kernel of the map @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the lattice of intersections of @xmath10 and @xmath29 is the sum of the inclusion maps @xmath30 .",
    "we identify @xmath31 with @xmath20 .",
    "to simplify notation , for @xmath32 we will denote with @xmath33 the vector space @xmath34 .",

    ".2 in    for any arrangement @xmath10 , the following sequence of vector spaces and maps form a complex : @xmath38 where @xmath39 , @xmath40 and for @xmath32 , @xmath41 are the spaces from the notations above . also , @xmath42 and @xmath43 for @xmath32 .",
    "we have @xmath44 .",
    "so @xmath45 is well defined .",

    "in this example we will discuss @xcite , example 5.1 .",
    ", in terms of the homology of the above complex . we must specify that all the computations are already done in @xcite , and we are just translating into topological language .",
    "@xmath10 is a real essential arrangement of rank 4 consisting of 10 hyperplanes , defined by the vanishing of the following linear forms : @xmath58 .",
    "so @xmath59 , @xmath60 and the map @xmath61 is just the map @xmath62 and has rank 4 .",
    "therefore @xmath63 has dimension @xmath64 .",
    "we have 7 nondegenerate rank 2 elements in @xmath65 and each is an intersection of exactly 3 hyperplanes .",
    "so we have 7 relations of length 3 : @xmath66",
    ".    therefore @xmath67 .",
    "the matrix of the map @xmath68 is exactly the matrix in @xcite , page 61 @xmath69 and it has rank 6 .",
    "so @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "also in @xcite we have listed all the elements of rank 3 from @xmath65 : @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 .    if @xmath84 is such an element ( with @xmath85 ) , then @xmath86 means that there is at least a relation among the relations of length 3 of elements of rank 2 in @xmath87 .",
    "the nondegenerate rank 2 elements in @xmath87 are nondegenerate rank 2 elements in @xmath65 and these are listed above .",
    "it is not difficult to check which are the relations of length 3 for each rank 3 element in @xmath10 . for reference ,",
    "these are listed in the chart on page 62 in @xcite .",

    ".2 in    graphic arrangements are a class of arrangements possessing many nice properties ( see , for example , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , and for this class there is a pleasant combinatorial interpretation of lema 2.5 . in the next section , @xmath1 denotes a connected graph with no loops or multiple edges . for the graphic arrangement @xmath4",

    "the graphic arrangement associated to @xmath1 is @xmath104 .",
    "note that @xmath10 is an arrangement in @xmath105 of rank @xmath106 ( if @xmath1 is connected ) and consists of @xmath107 (= the number of edges in @xmath1 ) hyperplanes .",
    "notice that from the beginning we fixed the defining forms @xmath108 . to be consistent with notation",

    ", we can identify @xmath40 with @xmath112 by @xmath113 $ ] for @xmath114 .",
    "if we fix the form of the elements in the basis of @xmath115 s and with proper notations of those , the correspondence between the two complexes will become natural .",
    "the next lemma will do this , but before we state and prove it here is the flavor of it :      we have @xmath118 .",
    "suppose for an @xmath119 we have @xmath120 .",
    "this means that we must have a dependency ( relation ) among some of the linear forms corresponding to some edges in @xmath117 . but",
    "this translates in the fact that @xmath117 contains a cycle .",
    "if the length of this cycle is @xmath121 , then the linear forms corresponding to 3 consecutive edges in the cycle are linearly independent .",
    "this contradicts the fact that @xmath122 .",
    "so @xmath117 contains a triangle",
    ". if we have an extra edge in @xmath117 , beside those from the triangle , then the linear form of this extra edge and the linear forms associated to two of the edges of the triangle are linearly independent .",
    "again we get a contradiction with the fact that @xmath122 .",
    "so @xmath123 a triangle .",
    "so each nonzero summand of @xmath124 corresponds to a triangle in @xmath1 .",
    "the converse of this statement is obvious .",
    "( the recursive identification lemma ) let @xmath116 with @xmath125 .",
    "then @xmath126 iff @xmath117 is a @xmath127 subgraph of @xmath1 .",
    "more , @xmath128 and if @xmath129 , i_1<i_2<\\cdots i_{l+1}$ ] , then we can pick a special basis element of @xmath130 to be the relation on the special elements corresponding to the @xmath131 subgraphs of @xmath117 : @xmath132 .",
    "this element is denoted with @xmath133 .                    if @xmath117 has just one @xmath131 subgraph , then @xmath147 .",
    "but @xmath148 is a sum of inclusions , and in this particular case it will be exactly an inclusion .",
    "so we get that @xmath149 , which is a contradiction .",
    "let s take two of them @xmath150 and @xmath151 , and first suppose they do not share any vertex .",
    "let @xmath152 and @xmath153 be two vertices of @xmath117 . through @xmath154",
    "pass exactly @xmath155 edges and the corresponding linear forms @xmath156 are linearly independent .",
    "let s take two edges @xmath157 $ ] and @xmath158 $ ] of @xmath151 and let @xmath159 and @xmath160 be the corresponding linear forms .",
    "then , @xmath161 are linearly dependent if at least one of the vertices @xmath162 is a vertex in @xmath150 .",
    "therefore , @xmath163 are linearly independent . but this will contradict @xmath164 .    hence , @xmath150 and @xmath151 have at least a common vertex @xmath154 .",
    "suppose @xmath165 are two vertices of @xmath151 but not of @xmath150 .",
    "then , through @xmath154 pass at least @xmath166 edges : @xmath155 from @xmath150 and @xmath167 $ ] , @xmath168 $ ] from @xmath151 .",
    "the corresponding linear forms are linearly independent and again we obtain a contradiction with the fact that @xmath164 .",

    "let @xmath172 .",
    "then @xmath173 for some @xmath174 .",

    "so we get a relation on the special basis elements of @xmath176 : @xmath177 @xmath178 observe that this equation is impossible .",
    "so @xmath117 has at least three distinct @xmath131 subgraphs : @xmath179 $ ] , @xmath180 $ ] and @xmath181 .",
    "if both @xmath134 and @xmath166 are vertices in @xmath181 , then @xmath134 and @xmath166 are connected in @xmath117 , so @xmath117 contains a @xmath127 subgraph .",

    "the corresponding linear forms of these edges are linearly independent so we get a contradiction with the fact that @xmath164 .",
    "we can conclude that @xmath117 contains a @xmath127 subgraph .",
    "now , if there exists an extra edge of @xmath117 not on this @xmath127 , then the corresponding linear form of this edge together with the corresponding linear forms of the edges passing through any vertex of the @xmath127 subgraph will form a linearly independent set of @xmath166 elements .",
    "again we get a contradiction with the fact that @xmath164 .",
    "so @xmath117 is a @xmath127 .      with this , @xmath117 has exactly @xmath166 @xmath131 subgraphs",

    "the only relation on these elements is exactly the special element in @xmath130 : @xmath190 we denote this element with @xmath191 and he is forming the basis for @xmath130 .",
    "with this lemma we can identify easily the two complexes .",
    "the way we pick the special basis elements will give us the same matrices for the differentials of the two complexes and , hence , with lemma 2.5 .",
