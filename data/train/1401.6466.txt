    "spontaneous pattern formation in two - dimensions ( 2d ) can occur for length scales ranging from fractions of a nanometer to micrometers when ions , organic molecules , macromolecules , nanoparticles or colloid particles are adsorbed on solid substrates , interfaces between two fluid phases or on biological membranes @xcite . in the case of membrane proteins ,",
    "cluster formation enables biological functions that can not be performed by single macromolecules . for this reason the self - assembly is very important for life processes . on the other hand",
    ", self - assembly of ions or nanoparticles on surfaces or interfaces can find applications in nanotechnology or in biomimetic systems .",
    "the sum of all the effective interactions in such systems often has a form of the short - range attraction and long - range repulsion potential ( salr ) which was intensively studied recently  @xcite .",
    "the repulsion is typically of electrostatic origin @xcite , or it is caused by polymeric brushes @xcite , while the attraction results from the van der waals and solvent - mediated interactions @xcite .",
    "the size of the structural motifs depends on the ranges of the attractive and the repulsive parts of the salr potential . in the case of charged nanoparticles or biologically relevant globular proteins in some solvents",
    "the thickness of the clusters or stripes is @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the particle diameter .",
    "a characteristic example is lysozyme in water @xcite .    in order to study the pattern formation in such systems ,",
    "we have introduced a 2d triangular lattice model with attraction between the first neighbors and repulsion between the third neighbors @xcite . in ref.@xcite the ground state ( gs ) , the mean - field",
    "( mf ) phase diagram and the correlation function in the brazovskii approximation have been obtained .",
    "the ground state of the model consists of the vacuum and fully occupied lattice for small and for large values of the chemical potential @xmath2 respectively .",
    "in addition , for intermediate values of @xmath2 periodically ordered clusters , stripes or bubbles are present when the repulsion to attraction ratio @xmath3 is sufficiently large .",
    "we have also found that at the coexistence between the ordered phases of different symmetry the ground state is strongly degenerated , and the entropy per site does not vanish in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the microscopic states present at the vacuum - ordered cluster phase coexistence consist of clusters that are located at distances larger than the repulsion range , but apart from this restriction the positions and the number of the clusters are arbitrary .",
    "we interpret the collection of the disordered microstates consisting of small noninteracting clusters as a cluster fluid ( cf ) phase . for weak repulsion , @xmath4",
    ", the clusters consist of 7 particles and have a hexagonal shape , whereas for @xmath5 four particles form a rhomboidal cluster . at the coexistence between the cluster and",
    "the stripe phases the ground state is also strongly degenerated , and for @xmath5 stripes of different lengths and rhomboidal clusters are packed as densely as possible under the constraint of no repulsion between different objects . in such microstates one direction is distinguished , and the rotational symmetry is broken .",
    "we call the collection of such microstates a `` molten lamella '' ( ml ) .    the degeneracy of the ground state must influence the phase behavior for @xmath6 ( with @xmath7 being the temperature ) .",
    "however , this effect can not be properly described by the mf theories .",
    "the average density in the disordered phase is position - independent , and the contribution to the internal energy from the repulsive part of the potential is an increasing function of the density . for this reason in mf",
    "the periodically ordered cluster phase coexists for low @xmath7 with a disordered fluid of very low density , with the fraction of occupied sites @xmath8 for @xmath9 . in the majority of the microstates of the cf phase , however , the distances between the clusters are larger than the range of the repulsion . in addition , for @xmath5 the clusters are small and no intra - cluster repulsion is present , therefore the repulsion contribution vanishes even for large volume fractions .",
    "thus , beyond mf the cf phase can be stable for quite large densities , @xmath10 , according to our simple estimation  @xcite .",
    "similarly , the molten lamella phase is not present on the mf phase diagram for low @xmath7 , although according to the gs analysis it is stable at the coexistence between the ordered cluster and stripe phases for @xmath11 @xcite .    on the other hand , for high @xmath7 thermal fluctuations destroy the periodic order .",
    "we have found an instability of the disordered phase with respect to density waves in mf . however ,",
    "when fluctuations are taken into account in the brazovskii - like approximation  @xcite , the instability with respect to the density waves is shifted to @xmath11 @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "a continuous transition between the isotropic phase and the phase with broken rotational symmetry was predicted recently for the brazovskii functional at two - loop level @xcite .",
    "the above observations indicate that in the salr systems the role of mesoscopic fluctuations is crucial for the stability of different phases consisting of aperiodic distribution of some structural motifs .    in this work",
    "we are interested in effects of fluctuations on pattern formation in thermal equilibrium .",
    "we focus on the case of strong repulsion and perform monte carlo ( mc ) simulation on the triangular lattice model for @xmath12 .",
    "our main goal is the construction of the phase diagram .",
    "we should stress that because of difficulties in the simulation procedure and in the interpretation of the results only sketches of a phase diagram for the salr potential have been obtained in 2d by mc @xcite and in 3d by molecular dynamics @xcite .    in the next section the model and the gs",

    "the presence of these transitions , and the atypical dependence of the results on the system size moved us to make use of parallel tempering ( or replica exchange ) mc sampling @xcite in order to improve the sampling quality of the simulation .    we have focused the simulation effort into a relatively large system , @xmath82 , in order to get a reliable estimation of the phase diagram .",

    "the results for @xmath82 suggest that the transition changes from a continuous to a weakly first order at a temperature @xmath195 ( fig.[phd - sim]b ) , and that this change occurs at , or close to , @xmath196 , i.e. the minimum value of the chemical potential with the f - ml equilibrium .     at the f@xmath197ml transition . ]",
    "the calculation of the f - ml transition below @xmath198 was carried out by fixing the temperature and running parallel tempering mc simulation using several values of the chemical potential .",
    "the plots of the density as a function of the chemical potential indicated a continuous transition for @xmath199 , whereas for @xmath200 , a clear discontinuity was observed ( fig.[rho_mu ] ) . from these plots it was possible to get estimates for both , the chemical potential at the transition , and the density of the two phases .",
    "the topology of the phase diagram implies the existence of a triple point where the or , f , and ml phases coexist . using the results of simulations with @xmath82 we have estimated the locus of this point as : @xmath201 , @xmath202 .",

    "the main features of the phase diagram in our model and in the case of the salr potential with moderate repulsion in an off - lattice system @xcite are similar .",
    "the details , however , are significantly different .",
    "the most important novelty is the stability of two different lamellar phases .",
    "let us compare the mf and the mc phase diagrams for the repulsion to attraction ratio @xmath12 . in the @xmath205 variables the phase diagrams ( fig .",
    "6 in ref.@xcite and fig.[phd - sim ] ) are similar for low @xmath100 , except that in mc the stability region of the ml phase extends down to @xmath43 , while in mf the @xmath206 phase appears for @xmath207 .",
    "the relation between the ml and the l@xmath208 phases obtained in mc and in mf respectively is not entirely obvious . in the @xmath206",
    "phase the density oscillates in one of the lattice directions @xmath209 , i.e the distinguished directions in the @xmath206 and the ml phases are the same .",
    "the structure of the ml phase resembles the structure of the l phase with defects .",
    "the defects do not destroy the orientational order , but the translational order is lost ( see fig.[fig.conf - lam]c ) .",
    "we attribute the stability of the ml phase for @xmath210 to the effect of the degeneracy of the gs that can not be properly described within mf .    for high @xmath100",
    "the differences between the mf and mc phase diagrams in the @xmath205 variables are more pronounced . in mf",
    "the stability region of the ordered phases extends to much higher temperatures than found by mc simulation .",
    "moreover , for high @xmath100 the h ( hexagonal ) phase with translational and without orientational order of the rhomboidal clusters appears in the mf , but not in the mc phase diagram .",
    "although we were not able to identify the h phase using mc simulation , we can not rule out the physical significance of this mf result .",
    "notice that in our analysis of the simulation results ( see for instance fig .",
    "[ hc - sim ] ) we found some anomalous behavior both in the equations of state ( either @xmath211 at constant @xmath2 , or @xmath212 at constant @xmath7 ) , and in the dependence of the results on the system size in the putative region of the f phase close to the transition to the or phase . in this regard , it is interesting to point out that other models on the triangular lattice and related models containing competing interactions @xcite exhibit modulated structures , and the phenomenology of devil s staircase @xcite .",
    "our simulation analysis can not answer if it is the case for our lattice salr model , but both the behavior of the fluid phase close to the transition to the or phase , and the results in the region described as molten lamellas exhibit some similarities with those reported for this kind of systems .",
    "further differences between the phase diagrams concern the sequences of phase transitions for high @xmath100 . in mf",
    "the @xmath206 phase coexists with the h phase for high @xmath100 , and extends to higher @xmath100 than the or phase .",
    "in contrast , in mc we find that the ml phase coexists with the disordered f phase for high @xmath100 , and extends to lower @xmath100 than the or phase .",
    "we attribute the stability of the f phase between the or and ml phases to the effects of fluctuations",
    ".    in our mc simulation we do not discriminate between possibly distinct fluid f phases , despite signatures of the phase transitions both in the density and in the energy .",
    "thus , the region marked as f in fig.[phd - sim ] might in fact represent stability of a few different phases ( see the snapshots in fig.[fig.conf - lam ] ) .",
    "the differences between the mf and mc phase diagrams are even stronger in the @xmath213 variables .",
    "the density ranges of the stability regions of the ordered phases and the two - phase regions are quite different in mf and in mc .",
    "the exception is the ordered l phase .",
    "it is stable for very narrow range of densities , @xmath214 both in mf and in mc .    on the mc phase diagram the ml phase coexists with the f phase for @xmath100 higher than the temperature at the triple point or - f - ml , and the transition between the two phases becomes continuous or very weakly first - order above @xmath195 . in mf we found a continuous phase transition between the f and the @xmath206 phases only for @xmath215 @xcite .",
    "we have calculated the maximum @xmath216 of the structure factor @xmath217 in the f phase in the brazovskii - type approximation@xcite .",
    "we have obtained a large value , @xmath218 for @xmath219 . for decreasing @xmath100 the maximum of the structure factor increases , but it diverges only for @xmath43 .",
    "this means a very large but finite correlation length , and an absence of the continuous transition to the phase with periodic density for @xmath220 beyond mf .",
    "recently , however , a continuous transition between the isotropic and the nematic phases has been predicted for a stripe - forming system in the brazovskii @xmath221 theory at two - loop order@xcite .",
    "this theory is relevant for @xmath65 in our model , and supports the mc results for the transition between the disordered and the ml phases .",
    "we expect that for high @xmath100 the transition f - ml is continuous , but since we do not have a definite proof for the order of the transition , the very weakly first - order transition is not ruled out .",
    "based on the comparison of the mf and mc phase diagrams we conclude that if the amplitude of the density wave in an ordered phase is small in mf , then only a short - range order ( such as in fig [ fig.conf-lam]b ) is left in a presence of fluctuations .",
    "the mf ordered phases with a large amplitude of the density oscillations remain stable in a presence of fluctuations .",
    "however , instead of a coexistence of two different ordered phases , we find a transition between each of them and a less ordered phase above a triple point .",
    "we found the or - ml - l triple point at @xmath43 , and the or - f - ml triple point at @xmath222 .",
    "we may observe that the temperature of the triple point is higher when the coexisting phases are less ordered .",
    "a further interesting question is : to what extent the results for the lattice salr model can be extrapolated to the corresponding models in the continuum ? regarding this point",
    "we could expect that the existence of low density ordered phases analogous to our or phase might strongly depend on the details of the interaction potential . in the continuum",
    ", a low density cluster ordered phase could be expected only if the clusters formed at low temperature show little amount of polydispersity both in a number of particles and shape . on the other hand , the transitions involving isotropic phases and lamellar structures",
    "seem to appear easily for systems in the continuum @xcite .",
    "we think that the results presented in this work will provide a convenient framework to analyze the possible transitions between fluid and lamellar phases , and the possible order - disorder transition between different lamellar phases .",
    "finally , we should mention that experimental observation of thermodynamically stable patterns is a real challenge , and our results can guide the experimental studies .",
