    "molecular transport through cell membranes is an essential mechanism in living organisms . often , the molecules are too long , and the pores in the membranes too narrow , to allow the molecules to pass through as a single unit . in such circumstances ,",
    "the molecules have to deform themselves in order to squeeze  i.e. , translocate  themselves through the pores .",
    "dna , rna and proteins are such naturally occuring long molecules @xcite in a variety of biological processes .",
    "translocation is also used in gene therapy @xcite , in delivery of drug molecules to their activation sites @xcite , and as a potentially cheaper alternative for single - molecule dna or rna sequencing @xcite .",
    "consequently , the study of translocation is an active field of research : as a cornerstone of many biological processes , and also due to its relevance for practical applications .",
    "translocation in living organisms is a complex process .",
    "take for instance the case of gene expression : most proteins are synthesized within the cytoplasm . their subsequent accurate and swift delivery to target sites , requiring energy , is a crucial step in gene expression . in different situations",
    "the energy is provided by chaperon molecules @xcite , ph gradient @xcite or molecular motors across membranes @xcite .",
    "these delivery mechanisms can be further complicated by membrane fluctuations and sometimes by gates that control the accessibility of the pores @xcite . in view of such complexity , translocation as a biological or biophysical process in living organisms has been scrutinized in a variety of _ in vivo _ experimental situations [ see e.g. ref . @xcite and the references therein ] .",
    "the experimental developments have been followed by a number of mean - field type theoretical studies on polymer translocation @xcite .",
    "more recently , translocation has found itself at the forefront of single - molecule - detection experiments @xcite , as new developments in design and fabrication of nanometer - sized pores and etching methods may lead to cheaper and faster technology for the analysis and detection of single macromolecules .",
    "the underlying principle for these experiments is that of a coulter counter : molecules suspended in an electrolyte solution pass through a narrow pore in a membrane .",
    "the electrical impedance of the pore increases with the entrance of a molecule as it displaces its own volume of the electrolyte solution . by applying a voltage over the pore",
    ", the passing molecules are detected as current dips .",
    "for nanometer - sized pores ( slightly larger than the molecule s cross - section ) the magnitude and the duration of these dips have proved to be effective in determining the size and length of the molecules . in the case of dna sequencing at nucleotide level , usage of protein pores ( modified @xmath9-haemolysin , mitochondrial ion channel , nucleic acid binding / channel protein etc . ) , and etching specific dna sequences inside the pores @xcite have opened up promising new avenues of fast , simple and cheap technology for single macromolecule detection , analysis and characterization [ see ref .",

    "the subject of this paper is a translocating polymer threaded through a narrow pore in an immobile membrane , where a bead is attached to one end of the polymer , and the bead is pulled by an optical tweezer with a constant force .",
    "such a setup can be used to spread apart a partially unzipped dsdna molecule  of which one strand is threaded through the pore  a process that can quantify the forces involved in basepair unzipping kinetics @xcite . in theoretical literature , this problem has been considered in recent times : for polymer length @xmath0 and applied force @xmath1 , in ref .",
    "@xcite , in the _ absence _ of hydrodynamical interactions , a lower bound @xmath10 for small forces ( @xmath11 ) has been argued for the polymer s mean unthreading time @xmath4 , the average time it takes for the polymer to leave the pore .",

    "@xcite reported numerical results that in the absence of the membrane @xmath14 for moderate forces , and @xmath15 for strong forces , while for narrow pores @xmath15 for moderate to strong forces .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to revisit the problem of translocation of a polymer pulled through a narrow pore in the _ absence _ of hydrodynamical interactions , in order to provide a deeper theoretical understanding of the polymer dynamics under these conditions , as well as of the scaling behaviour of the unthreading time of the polymer . in support of our theory ,",
    "we perform high precision computer simulations , using a _ three - dimensional self - avoiding lattice polymer model _ that we have used before to study polymer translocation @xcite and several other situations @xcite .",
    "our conventions to study this problem , all throughout this paper , is the following .",
    "we place the membrane at @xmath16 , and thread the polymer of _ total length _ @xmath17 halfway through the pore such that both the right ( @xmath18 ) and the left ( @xmath19 ) of the membrane have equal number of monomers @xmath0 .",
    "we fix the middle monomer ( monomer number @xmath0 ) at the pore , apply a force @xmath1 on the free end on the right and let both left and right segments of the polymer come to equilibrium . at @xmath20",
    "we release the middle monomer and let translocation commence .",
    "the mean time @xmath4 that the polymer remains within the pore is defined as the mean unthreading time for polymer length @xmath0 under the force @xmath1 .",

    "the value of @xmath9 depends on the relaxation properties following the event of injecting , say , @xmath65 extra monomers at the tether end , just like extra monomers add to ( or get taken out of ) the right segment of the polymer during translocation .",

    "this internal section of @xmath85 monomers in steady state extends only to @xmath86 from the membrane , because the larger scale conformation has yet to adjust , and consequently there is a compressive force @xmath87 on these @xmath88 monomers .    for @xmath6",
    ", @xmath89 is the only length scale for the equilibrated section of the chain , which leads to @xmath90 @xcite , but for @xmath40 this does not hold . for small to moderate forces , i.e. , for @xmath91 ,",
