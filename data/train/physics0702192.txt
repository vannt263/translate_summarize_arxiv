    "blackbody radiation ( bbr ) is known to strongly affect the populations of atoms in highly excited rydberg states  @xcite .",

    "strong effect of bbr on rydberg atoms is related to large matrix elements of bound - bound and bound - free transitions between rydberg states in the microwave and far infrared spectral range  @xcite .",
    "interaction of rydberg atoms with bbr has been studied earlier in various contexts .",
    "farley and wing  @xcite calculated the dynamic stark shifts and depopulation rates of rydberg levels of alkali atoms with @xmath3 at 300  k. the temperature dependence of bbr - induced transitions rates from the 19s state of sodium was calculated and measured by spencer et al  @xcite .",
    "galvez et al  @xcite have studied bbr - induced cascade transitions from the initially populated @xmath4=24 - 29 states of na , both theoretically and experimentally .    although interaction of rydberg atoms with blackbody radiation has been studied for years , both theoretically and experimentally , only a few works were devoted to bbr - induced ionization of rydberg atoms itself .",
    "the temperature dependence of the bbr - induced ionization rate of na  17d state was numerically calculated using the quantum defect method in a coulomb approximation and experimentally measured by spencer et al  @xcite .",
    "a simple scaling law for bbr ionization rates was also introduced in that work .",
    "more recently , the interest to bbr - induced ionization of rydberg atoms has been related to the spontaneous formation of ultracold plasma in dense samples of cold rydberg atoms @xcite , and to the prospects of its use as a convenient reference signal in absolute measurements of collisional ionization rates @xcite . even nowadays",
    ", however , the studies of spontaneous evolution of ultracold rydberg atoms to a plasma caused by bbr @xcite use the simple estimates of bbr ionization rates taken from the well - known work @xcite .",
    "the numerical calculations of direct bbr photoionization rates were performed by lehman @xcite for h and na rydberg states with @xmath4=10 - 40 using a herman - skillman potential with an additional term to account for core polarization .",
    "however , the theoretical data for rb atoms , which are widely investigated in experiments on ultracold plasma , are lacking .",
    "no systematic experimental studies of the @xmath4-dependences of bbr ionization rates of alkali - metal rydberg atoms in a wide range of principal quantum numbers are known .    a major problem in the interpretation of measured ionization rates of rydberg atoms is related to the fact that populations of rydberg states are affected by bbr - induced processes to an unknown ( or , at least , not straightforwardly predictable ) extent , which depends on the combination of specific experimental conditions ( principal quantum numbers _",
    "n _ , ambient temperature , duration of measurements , extracting electric field strengths , etc . ) .",
    "therefore , a more detailed study of bbr - induced ionization of rydberg atoms under typical experimental conditions is required , especially for higher rydberg states that are often explored in the experiments with cold atoms .",
    "in this article we present the results of numerical calculations of bbr ionization rates of rb and na rydberg atoms for the most commonly used _ _",
    "n__s , _ _ n__p and _ _ n__d states with _ _ n__=8 - 65 at the ambient temperatures of 77 , 300 and 600  k. in these calculations we take into account two phenomena that may affect the observed ionization rates : the time - dependent bbr - induced population redistribution between rydberg states prior to photoionization and the selective field ionization ( sfi ) of high - lying rydberg states by the electric field applied for extraction of ions from the excitation zone .",
    "although both phenomena were mentioned in some of the earlier studies  @xcite , their effects have not yet been studied in sufficient detail neither theoretically , nor experimentally . in particular , in the measurements of direct bbr photoionization rate of the sodium 17d state @xcite with effective lifetime 4  @xmath5s at the ambient temperature of 300  k",
    ", the effect of population redistribution was diminished due to the short measurement time of 500  ns and weak electric field used for extraction of ions . however ,",
    "for rydberg states with @xmath6 and effective lifetimes less than 500  ns even this very short time interval is insufficient to avoid mixing with neighboring states , so that mixing processes must be necessarily accounted in calculations . in the present study",
    "we address to both phenomena and provide the useful analytical formulae , which can be applied to any rydberg atom for estimates of the direct bbr - induced ionization rates and of the contribution of the sfi .",
    "the simplest ( but often insufficient ) way of considering bbr - induced ionization after the excitation of an atom _ a _ to a given _ nl _ rydberg state is to limit the problem to the direct photoionization of the initial _ nl _ state in one step by absorption of bbr photons :    @xmath7    where @xmath8 is the energy of absorbed bbr photon , @xmath9 is the atomic ion , and @xmath10 is the free electron emitted in the ionization . in the reality , however , ionization of rydberg atoms exposed to bbr is a complex process , in which the following main components can be identified [ see fig .",
    "1(a ) ] : ( i ) direct photoionization of atoms from the initial rydberg state via absorption of bbr photons , ( ii ) field ionization by extraction electric field pulses of high rydberg states , which are populated from the initial rydberg state by absorption of bbr photons , ( iii ) direct bbr - induced photoionization of atoms in the neighboring rydberg states , which are populated due to absorption and emission of bbr photons prior to photoionization , and ( iv ) field ionization of other high - lying states , which are populated via population redistribution involving two or more steps of bbr photon absorption and/or emission events .",
    "our calculations show that all these processes can contribute to the total ionization rate to a comparable extent , and , therefore , none of them can be disregarded . in what follows",
    "we will consider the above processes separately and calculate the total bbr ionization rates , both analytically and numerically .",
    "ionization mechanisms of rydberg atoms exposed to bbr are illustrated in fig .  1 .",

    "such fields are more relevant to the experiments with cold rydberg atoms , e.g. , to ultracold plasma formation from cold rydberg atoms clouds @xcite , since these experiments explore the atoms excited to relatively high rydberg states that are ionized in weaker electric fields ( 35  v / cm for @xmath117 and 10  v / cm for @xmath118 ) .",

    "however , from the tables of appendix it can be seen that , e.g. , for the rb  65s state at @xmath119=300  k the total bbr ionization rate is twice larger than the direct photoionization rate ( see table  5 ) .",

    "our calculations take into account the effect of bbr - induced mixing of rydberg states and their field ionization by extracting electric field pulses .",
    "useful analytical formulae have been derived , which allow for quick estimation of ionization rates and their dependences on the principal quantum number _ n_. the numerical results are in a good agreement with our recent experiment data on na _ _ n__s and _ _ n__d states , except for _ _ n__s states with @xmath0 , which is most probably associated with the cooper minimum in the photoionization cross - section .",
    "the obtained results show that bbr - induced redistribution of population over rydberg states and their field ionization by extracting electric fields affect both the magnitudes of total ionization rates and shapes of their dependencies on the principal quantum number .",
    "this suggests that these processes are important and can not be ignored in the calculations and measurements of bbr ionization rates .",
    "equations ( [ eq16])-([eq20 ] ) , as well as the analytical formulae ( [ eq9 ] ) and ( [ eq15 ] ) , can be used to calculate total ionization rates @xmath113 under particular experimental conditions .",
    "the obtained numerical results may be helpful to the analysis of ionization signals measured in experiments on collisional ionization and spontaneous formation of ultracold plasma , since bbr - induced ionization is the main channel of delivering atomic ions . at the same time , as we have revealed that theoretical data for na @xmath4s - states noticeably disagree with experiment at @xmath120 , new experimental data for na and rb in a broader range of principal quantum numbers would be of interest for the further improvement of theory , especially for the non - hydrogen - like states .",
