    "detailed observations of the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of young stellar objects ( ysos ) have revealed numerous systems with deficits of near - infrared flux compared to primordial ysos .",
    "these pre - transitional and transitional disk systems are interpreted as having inner gaps and holes in their disks @xcite .",
    "both infrared scattered light imagery @xcite and sub - millimeter observations have confirmed this basic architecture for pre - transitional and transitional disk systems , and revealed additional sub - structure that could provide information about the mechanism responsible for clearing regions in these disks @xcite .",
    "numerous mechanisms have been suggested to explain the clearing and partial clearing associated with pre - transitional and transitional disk systems , including grain - growth , photo - evaporation @xcite , disk instability , and perturbation from planetary companions @xcite .",
    "these mechanisms can also influence other regions of these disks such as the inner walls and surface structures .",
    "for example , grain growth can create a rounded gap edge whereas planets can inflate gap edges , creating a wall that can shadow parts of the outer disk or induce significant back scattering @xcite .",
    "grain growth should also induce very bright sub - millimeter features in systems exhibiting gaps in the near - infrared , although this is not seen in oph irs 48 or sao 206462 .",
    "additional morphological features such as spiral arms have been detected in these disks , and could be attributable to stellar and sub - stellar companions or gravitational instabilities @xcite .",
    "planet - induced perturbations should co - rotate with the planet ; hence , detecting the rotation of these structure could help to distinguish the origin of some disk structures @xcite .",
    "additional morphological features observed in transitional disks , such as dust traps , can also be used to constrain the mechanism responsible for sculpting the spatial distribution of gas and dust in transitional disks .",
    "clearly , a first step that is needed to assess the clearing mechanism is to fully constrain the spatial distribution of small and large dust grains , as well as the gas , in individual disk systems .    the spatial distribution of small dust grains in numerous transitional disks @xcite have been recently parametrized utilizing several facilities , including large programs like the strategic exploration of exoplanets and disks with subaru ( seeds ) high - contrast imaging survey @xcite .",
    "these observations have provided scattered light confirmation of the gapped nature of transitional disks @xcite , revealed the presence of spiral structures @xcite , detected likely non - axisymmetric inner disks @xcite , found differences in some cases about the distribution of large versus small dust grain populations @xcite , and the presence of a planet within a gap @xcite .",
    "doar 28 is a k5-type object in the @xmath4 ophiuchi association located at a distance of @xmath3139 pc @xcite , that has been identified as a transitional disk based on its sed @xcite .",
    "the system is observed to be actively accreting at a rate of @xmath5 @xmath6 @xcite , and has a disk with an inferred outer gap radius of 15 au @xcite from analysis of its sed .    in this paper ,",
    "we present the first scattered light detection of the doar 28 transitional disk , in the h - band . in section 2",
    ", we will discuss the scattered light observations and data reduction . in section 3",
    ", we present our analysis of the resolved disk , constrain the presence of co - moving point sources , and model these data using monte carlo models .",
    "finally , we discuss the implications of our results in the broader context of other resolved transitional disk systems in section 4 .",
    "doar 28 was observed in two epochs on 2012 july 9 ( 2012 epoch ) and 2014 june 9 ( 2014 epoch ) as part of the seeds survey using hiciao @xcite in the h - band .",
    "the data were obtained in quad polarized differential imaging ( qpdi ) mode at four wave - plate positions ( 0@xmath7 , 22.5@xmath7 , 45@xmath7 , 67.5@xmath7 ) in angular differential imaging ( adi ) mode .",
    "each observational frame contains four sub - images with each sub - image having a field of view of 5@xmath00 by 5@xmath00 , with a pixel scale of 9.5 mas pixel@xmath8 and a fwhm of 0@xmath0136 for the 2012 epoch and 0@xmath0101 for the 2014 epoch .",
    "the total adi field rotation achieved was 19.5@xmath7 for the 2012 epoch data and was 21.3@xmath7 for the 2014 epoch data .",
    "the data reduction process we employed for extracting polarized intensity ( pi ) disk images utilized the double differencing reduction technique described in @xcite .",
    "to briefly review , the four sub - images of each frame contain two ordinary and two extra - ordinary images , which can be summed and subtracted from their @xmath9 counterparts to create -q , + q , -u , and + u images .",
    "the q and u frames were then rotated into a common orientation , corrected for instrumental polarization , and summed to create final q and u images .",
    "note that as our 2012 epoch imagery were obtained under non - optimal conditions , we only utilized the best 64 of the 76 observed frames for our summed imagery .",
    "the final pi images are computed using @xmath10 . as previously noted by @xcite ,",
    "the psf convolved by seeing is not perfectly corrected by the ao-188 system , which produces a residual polarized halo .",
    "we computed an artificial halo following the procedure outlined in @xcite , scaled this to the observed aperture polarization of the system ( p = @xmath11 ) , and subtracted it from the pi image to create final pi imagery .",
    "we searched for point - source companions to doar 28 using the acorns - adi software package @xcite .",
    "we treated each of the four sub - images noted above as its own angular differential imaging sequence ( adi , marois et al .",
    "2006 ) and reduced them using the loci algorithm ( lafreniere et al . 2007 ) with the standard reduction parameters from brandt et al .",
    "this yielded four residual images , each corrected for partial flux subtraction .",
    "we then averaged these psf - subtracted images to produce a single high - contrast image .",
    "we computed the standard deviation in annuli on this combined image to produce a contrast map and searched for 5@xmath12 companions .",
    "we found one companion candidate as described in section 3.2 ; follow - up data showed it to be an unrelated background star .",
    "we observed doar  28 with the submillimeter array ( sma ) on 2011 march 16 , using the compact configuration with six of the 6 m diameter antennas at 230 ghz ( 1.3  mm ) with a full correlator bandwidth of 2 ghz , for a total integration time of 63 minutes .",
    "calibration of the visibility phases and amplitudes was achieved with observations of the quasar 3c  279 , at intervals of about 20 minutes .",
    "observations of titan provided the absolute scale for the flux density calibration .",
    "the data were calibrated using the mir software package.cqi/mircook.html ] we detected doar  28 with a flux density of 68.6@xmath131.9  mjy .",
    "the double sideband system temperatures were 110 to 170 k.      doar  28 was observed using the arc echelle spectrograph ( arces ; @xcite ) at the apache point observatory ( apo ) 3.5 m telescope on 2014 june 19 , yielding a r@xmath331,500 spectrum covering the spectral range of @xmath33,600 - 10,000  . the data were reduced using standard iraf techniques .",
    "we extracted the order containing h@xmath14 and continuum normalized these data , enabling us to characterize the line strength discussed in section [ subsec : model ] .",
    "our two epochs of scattered light pi imagery of doar 28 are shown in figure [ fig : piimage ] .",
    "significant scattered light around the central star is clearly seen in both epochs .",
    "the direction and relative intensity of the polarization vectors derived from these data exhibit a clear centrosymmetric behavior around the central star ( figure [ fig : vector_map ] ) , confirming that this signal arises from scattering off of circumstellar material .",
    "these data exhibit less evidence of centro - symmetry about the minor axis , which is much less resolved than the major axis , suggesting that the level of our residual polarized halo correction might be incomplete .",
    "our primary analysis of these data will focus on the measured polarized intensity along the major axis of the system .",
    "since these data were not observed with a coronagraph , we defined the effective inner working angle as the location where the radial profile measured along the disk major axis ( figure [ fig : power_law ] ) exhibited a clear deviation from the disk dominated scattered light power law behavior seen in the outer disk . using this criterion , we determined the inner working angle to be 0@xmath017 ( 22 au ) for the 2012 epoch data and 0@xmath010 ( 13 au ) for the 2014 epoch ( figure [ fig : radial_profile ] ) .",
    "the power law that characterizes the radial profile distribution of the scattered light flux along the disk major axis extends out to @xmath30@xmath050 ( 65 au ) , defining the outer edge of the scattered light disk , before becoming clearly dominated by noise .",
    "the detected disk appears to be continuous , with no significant gaps or holes clearly visible .",
    "the two epochs of imagery appear similar to each other , modulo potential differences arising from the factor of 1.4 better fwhm achieved in the 2014 epoch imagery . for the imagery with a slightly larger fwhm ,",
    "it is conceivable that a small amount of disk flux could be spread out into the psf halo , and be subtracted out in the process described in section [ subsec : hiciao_reduc ] . nevertheless , the overall surface brightness of the disk is the same at both epochs and the radial surface brightness power law measured along the major axis for both epochs is similar ( -2.47 for 2012 ; -1.84 for 2014 ) .",
    "we do note the potential presence of a slight curl in the sw region of the 2014 epoch scattered light disk , and further discuss this feature in section [ sec : discussion ]    we determine the inclination of the disk to be @xmath350@xmath7 ( table [ tbl : model ] ) .",
    "this was found by subtracting a suite of disk models for a range of inclination angles , described in section [ subsec : model ] , and identifying the inclination which yielded the smallest residuals ( figure [ fig : residual ] ) .",
    "note that this residual image ( figure [ fig : residual ] ) exhibits clear deviations from axisymmetry , with a deficit of scattered light present along the northern side of the major axis",
    ". we will be further discuss this non - axisymmetric structure in section [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "we identified a candidate point source companion @xmath15 northwest of doar 28 , with an @xmath16-band contrast of 9.5 magnitudes , in our july 2012 data .",
    "our second epoch images from june 2014 indicate that this object is almost certainly a background star .",
    "doar 28 was too faint for a proper motion from the _ tycho _ satellite , but is part of to the same star forming region as @xmath4 oph .",
    "we assume that it shares @xmath4 oph s proper motion of @xmath17 mas / yr in ra and dec @xcite . at a distance of @xmath3140 pc , 1",
    "mas / yr corresponds to @xmath30.7 kms@xmath8 , similar to the velocity dispersions of the hyades , pleiades , and tw hya @xcite , and somewhat less than the @xmath323 kms@xmath8 of orion @xcite .",
    "figure 6 shows that the companion candidate follows the expected background track assuming common proper motion with @xmath4 oph .",
    "if the point source were co - located with doar 28 , their relative velocity would be at least 17 kms@xmath8 , much too high for the system to be bound at its observed location .",
    "figure [ fig : contrast_curve ] shows our sensitivity limits , assuming a distance of @xmath3140 pc and converting contrast to absolute magnitude , and neglecting extinction ( estimated to be @xmath30.4 magnitudes at h - band , using a(v ) = 2.3 @xcite , r@xmath18 = 3.1 , and the @xcite extinction relations ) , making these sensitivity estimates slightly optimistic .",
    "it is more difficult to interpret these results as mass limits , given doar 28 s extreme youth and uncertainties about the luminosities of very young planets @xcite .",
    "our seeds observations reach a limiting @xmath16-band absolute magnitude of @xmath313.5 at a projected separation of 100 au . at an age of 5 myr",
    ", this corresponds to @xmath34 @xmath19 in the bt - settl models , but anywhere from @xmath34 @xmath19 up to the deuterium - burning limit of @xmath313 @xmath19 in the @xcite models ( sb12 ) , depending on the initial entropy .",
    "we note that the high - mass end of this range requires a very cold start .",
    "assuming an initial entropy midway between the minimum and maximum values of the sb12 models , the sb12 mass limits are only slightly higher than the bt - settl limits .",
    "there are theoretical reasons arguing against the formation of substellar companions below @xmath35 @xmath19 by direct gravitational collapse @xcite .",
    "our seeds imagery rule out such a companion , which would necessarily form hot and beyond @xmath380 au . while a less massive core - accretion planet is unlikely to form at such a wide separation ( doar 28 s disk only extends to 70 au ) , our data can not rule out a jovian planet scattered into a wide or unbound orbit .",
    "we modeled the doar28 system with the hochunk3d monte carlo radiative transfer ( mcrt ) code as described in whitney et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "hochunk3d is similar to other codes and has a long history of being used to constrain the dust distribution in protoplanetary systems .",
    "the latest version of hochunk3d decouples the small and large dust grain distributions , allowing settling of dust to be incorporated .",
    "this implementation can be thought of as utilizing overlapping disks with different dust grain size distributions .",
    "dust density distributions in hochunk3d are adopted from shakura & sunyaev ( @xcite ) and are characterized by a radial power law ( @xmath14 ) , and a vertical gaussian distribution ( @xmath20 ) , as given by equation [ eqn : density ] , where @xmath21 is the radial component in cylindrical coordinates and @xmath22 is the height of the disk from the mid - plane .",
    "@xmath23 is the scale height defined in equation [ eqn : scale_height ] , which is normalized at a defined radius of 100 au .",
    "deviations in the dust density distribution , such as gaps , spiral arms , and warped disks , can also be fully parameterized with hochunk3d .",
    "@xmath24 ^ 2\\right\\}\\ ] ]    @xmath25    @xcite and references therein describe the full radiative transfer of the hochunk3d code .",
    "to briefly summarize , the code uses a henyey - greenstein scattering phase function and includes parameters for forward - scattering and albedo calculated from the adopted dust grain model .",
    "the dust models we used are described below .",
    "temperature corrections utilized the lucy method with a maximum number of six iterations @xcite .",
    "we utilized 5 * 10@xmath26 photons for our broad exploration of mcrt parameter space , and 5 * 10@xmath27 photons for each of our runs where we compared both the observed sed and pi imagery against the models .",
    "as is true with many mcrt codes , the large number of free parameters exceed the number of data points leading to model degeneracies .",
    "since we lacked spatially resolved sub - millimeter observations that trace the radial distributions of large grains we assumed that the small and large grain disks had the same @xmath14 and @xmath20 .",
    "we included a wall along the disk edge , as walls are thought to be common in transitional disks @xcite .",
    "we also assumed that there was a negligible envelope , no warping of the disk , and that the disk was azimuthally symmetric .",
    "we adopted dust parameters from wood et al .",
    "dust model 1 ( @xcite ) for our large dust grains , which are composed of amorphous carbon and silicon ranging in sizes up to 1 millimeter .",
    "the small dust grain model we adopted was the average galactic ism model from kim et al .",
    "( @xcite ) . we generated a grid of 270 models and identified a broad range of parameters consistent with the observed sed in table [ tbl : model ] .",
    "our model sed is consistent with the observed photometry of doar  28 , as shown in figure [ fig : sed ] , with the new sma data point helping to constrain the large dust grain disk .",
    "we explored a range of gap sizes and how these influenced the resultant sed and images , and demonstrate below that a gap size of @xmath38 au best represents our data .",
    "we also found that the accretion rate and the gap density parameter had similar effects on the sed [ tbl : model ] .",
    "we adopted the accretion rate quoted by @xcite , @xmath28 @xmath6 , which led us assume a gap density parameter of 5 * 10@xmath29 ( table [ tbl : model ] ) .",
    "note however that our analysis of our new spectroscopic observations of doar 28 revealed a h - alpha equivalent width ( @xmath30 ) that was different than the 36   reported in @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the system likely exhibits a variable accretion rate .",
    "thus , the upper and lower bound values of the gap density shown in table [ tbl : model ] are more representative of the system .    after using the observational sed of doar 28 to constrain our mcrt model parameters",
    ", we next used the observed surface brightness of our pi imagery to further constrain these parameters .",
    "specifically , we measured the surface brightness of our pi imagery using a 4-pixel wide aperture along the major axis of the disk , and compared this to the h - band pi surface brightness predicted by our models ( figure [ fig : radial_profile ] ) .",
    "this iterative process enabled us to arrive at our final adopted model parameters listed in table [ tbl : model ] , including the adoption of the gap size at @xmath38 au .",
    "we used the model image subtracted from the pi images to find the inclination of 50@xmath1 . to search for potential deviations from axi - symmetry in our data",
    ", we subtracted our ( axi - symmetric ) model , scaled to the peak intensity of the observed pi disk , from our observations .",
    "this process revealed evidence that the northern side of the disk exhibits a deficit of polarized flux near the inner working angle of our data as compared to the southern side of the disk ( figure [ fig : residual ] ) .",
    "we discuss the potential origin of this asymmetry in the discussion section .",
    "our hiciao h - band multi - epoch observations of the doar  28 transitional disk clearly reveals evidence of a scattered light disk observed in polarized intensity , extending from our effective inner working angle of 13 au ( 0@xmath010 ; 2014 epoch ) to 65 au ( 0@xmath050 ) .",
    "we observe no gap in the disk in our pi imagery at the location suggested by previous sed modeling of the system ( 15 au ; @xcite ) .",
    "this suggests that either the small grain population is decoupled from the large grain population , and/or that the disk gap resides inside of our effective inner working angle .",
    "our mcrt modeling of the disk , using constraints both from doar  28 s sed and our h - band imagery , suggests the disk has a gap extending from the dust sublimation radius out to @xmath38 au , that is only partially cleared of material .",
    "this gap size is smaller than that estimated from previous sed - only modeling efforts ( 15 au ; @xcite ) .",
    "other transitional disks observed in the h - band with hiciao as part of the seeds project , such as sao 206462 , mwc 758 , and sr 21 @xcite , also exhibit evidence of small dust grains in their gaps , similar to that inferred for doar  28 .",
    "future multi - wavelength observations of the system that achieve a factor of @xmath32 improvement in the effective inner working angle are needed to both test if the disk gap is truly as small as @xmath38 au , and to determine whether the radial distribution of small and large dust grains are decoupled , as is the case for systems like sr 21 @xcite .",
    "the seemingly small gap size of doar  28 contrasts the disk gaps at larger orbital separations observed in other transitional disks , such as pds 70 ( 70 au ; @xcite ) , sr 21 ( 36 au ; @xcite ) , sao 206462 ( 46 au @xcite ) , lkca 15 ( 56 au ; @xcite ) , and oph irs 48 ( 60 au @xcite ) .",
    "if this gap is caused by dynamical interactions between planetary bodies in the system and the disk , this could suggest that doar  28 has few such fully formed companions , perhaps owing to the system being in a more youthful state than other imaged systems .",
    "doar  28 exhibits several indications of morphological features that deviate from simple axisymmetry at modest signal - to - noise levels ( figure [ fig : residual ] ) .",
    "for example , our 2014 epoch imagery exhibits tentative evidence of asymmetry in the northern - side of the disk ( figure [ fig : residual ] ) .",
    "this type of asymmetry is commonly observed , and could be caused by a range of phenomenon ranging from companion interactions , a clumpy inner disk , and magneto - rotational instability .",
    "a companion such as a planet could induce warping of the disk which would shadow the outer portions of the disk .",
    "if the observed asymmetric feature is caused by a companion , the feature should move in the disk at the same rotational speed of the companion , and not at the keplarian speed @xcite .",
    "the asymmetry could also indicate the presence of a small azimuthal asymmetry in the inner disk .",
    "numerical simulations of magneto - rotations instabilities ( mri ) also suggest that mri - driven disk winds can perturb the disk @xcite , which could also produce departures from axisymmetry .",
    "additional epochs of spatially resolved imagery could help constrain whether the observed non - axisymmetric structure evolves with time , hence constrain the potential origin of this feature .",
    "an additional , albeit more speculative indication of a non - axisymmetric feature is present along the southwest edge of the disk in our 2014 epoch data , namely the suggestive presence of a small hook - like feature ( figure [ fig : piimage ] ) .",
    "while the feature looks similar to spiral arms seen on in disks such as sao 206462 and mwc 758 @xcite , there are no known t - tauri transitional disks that exhibit spiral structures .",
    "it has been suggested that the lower temperatures of t - tauri disks ( compared to their herbig analogs ) results in lower sound speeds , creating tighter spiral arms @xcite that would not be resolved in our data .",
    "some studies have found that the dynamical temperature of co gas is greater in t tauri stars than in herbig aebe stars ( ) , but this co gas may not be well coupled with the small dust grain population .",
    "we conclude that this hook , if it is real , is most likely to be a perturbation of the disk much like the asymmetric feature described above and not a spiral arm .",
    "we have reported the first spatially resolved scattered light image of the doar  28 transitional disk in h - band .",
    "we detect the scattered light disk from 0@xmath010 ( 13 au ) out to 0@xmath050 ( 65 au ) , which is slightly interior to the location of the system s gap inferred by another group s sed modeling ( 15 au ) .",
    "although we detected a point source companion 1@xmath01 northwest of the system , our second epoch of imagery of the system indicates this object is most likely a background star . using the hochunk3d monte carlo radiative transfer code , we have modeled both the observed sed and h - band pi imagery of the system .",
    "our best fit models utilize a modestly inclined ( 50@xmath1 ) , 0.01 m@xmath31 disk that has a partially depleted inner gap from the dust sublimation radius out to @xmath38 au . subtracting this best fit , axi - symmetric model from our polarized intensity data reveals evidence for a small asymmetry in the northern - side of the disk , which could be attributable to variety of mechanisms .",
    "we encourage future high spatial resolution sub - millimeter imagery of the system to better ascertain the location of the disk gap in the system , and to search for azimuthal and radial differences in distribution of small versus large dust grains that could be caused by recent planet formation in the system .",
