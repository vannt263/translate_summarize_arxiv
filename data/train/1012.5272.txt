    "the triangular lattice susceptibility for @xmath8 is given directly as @xmath468 while that for the honeycomb follows from the duality / star - triangle transformation ( [ star - triangle ] ) and is @xmath469 note that both odd and even sites contribute in ( [ 54 ] ) with the sum for the ferromagnet ; the difference for the antiferromagnet . the results for @xmath7 follow by duality and are @xmath470 where @xmath471 is the conventional high - temperature variable and @xmath113 is @xmath255 or @xmath257 as appropriate .",
    "all of these susceptibilities agree with the earlier work by sykes et al .",
    "@xcite .    in our implementation of the above procedure we made full use of maple s automatic series multiplication routines in full integer arithmetic .",
    "this is similar to what was done in @xcite for the square lattice and allowed us to reach series of adequate length .",
    "however we did introduce several modifications to improve efficiency .",
    "first , as also in @xcite , when generating high- and low - temperature series the recursions were set up to deal directly with the much smaller residuals @xmath472 . as an example of this change ,",
    "the recursion ( [ 49 ] ) becomes @xmath473 \\nonumber \\\\   & & /\\big(m^2+\\delta g_{k-1}(i-2,j-1)\\big ) , \\hspace{1 cm } i \\geq 2\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in which the magnetization appears only in a denominator factor .",
    "a second change was based on the observation that all @xmath354 terms on odd honeycomb sites are of the form @xmath474 times series in @xmath25 .",
    "if we define these @xmath354 terms as @xmath475 and use @xmath476 in the recursion relations in place of @xmath354 one can eliminate all occurrences of @xmath474 and dramatically speed up maple s handling of the resulting series in the recursions ( [ 45])([49 ] ) and thus reducing the number of required series multiplications ] .",
    "thirdly , we transformed from series in @xmath25 to series in the ( cube root ) nome @xmath477 .",
    "as remarked in section [ bernie ] , the effect is not dramatic but because the implementation of a variable change is so easy we did take this opportunity for improved efficiency .    for the high- and low - temperature susceptibilities",
    ", we generated series to ",
    "shell \" 160 in about 40 days on a 3 ghz pentium processor with 500 mbyte memory .",
    "this gives @xmath478 , @xmath479 and @xmath480 to about 640 terms and @xmath481 to about 320 and these series can be found in @xcite .",
    "we have also run the recursion program for series in @xmath1 to @xmath482 for the data necessary to determine the  short - distance \" terms in @xmath483 .",
    "here there is no magnetization subtraction ; instead @xmath484 and the code simplifies considerably .",
    "it is only practical to run in floating point and we have gone as high as 121  shells \" with an accuracy estimated better than about 500 digits .",
    "another difference from the high- and low - temperature series case is that the correlation data from different shells is not accumulated but rather kept separate so as to allow a fitting procedure completely analogous that appears in various equations in @xcite is now to be interpreted as @xmath35it remains as the same function of @xmath1 . ] to that described in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 6 ) .",
    "note that there is a distinction between what constitutes a shell for short - distance fitting and the  shells \" as defined in figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "first , a fitting shell contains only one layer each of odd and even sites  not the two shown in figure [ fig4]so our data extends to 241 fitting shells .",
    "secondly , we try to keep fitting shells as close to perfect hexagons as possible .",
    "symmetry dictates that we use even sites from a single @xmath399 but odd sites are taken from @xmath399 if they are below the horizontal in figure [ fig4 ] and from @xmath485 if they are above the horizontal .",
    "the individual shell values are of little intrinsic interest and are not recorded here .",
    "instead we give  short - distance \" terms , which are the output of the fitting procedure , in an abbreviated form in appendix c and to the full estimated accuracy of our calculations in @xcite .",
    "to complement the much longer 2042 term high- and low - temperature square lattice series from @xcite , we have rerun the code in @xcite for series in @xmath1 to @xmath486 to 241 shells .",
    "our extended fits confirm the earlier results from @xcite and the new output is recorded in appendix c and @xcite as for the triangular / honeycomb data .",
    "once we obtained the high- and low - temperature susceptibility series , we analysed them to extract the scaling function .",
    "firstly , we normalised the series variable so that the ferromagnetic singularity occurs at 1 .",
    "for example , for the high- and low - temperature square lattice series we use the variables @xmath487 and @xmath488 respectively .",
    "we began with short - distance terms calculated from the expansion of the susceptibility in terms of @xmath1 as described in ( * ? ? ? * section 6 ) , and a number of aharony and fisher scaling terms which are known to be accurate .",
    "these are of the form @xmath489 and @xmath490 respectively .",
    "we converted these to series in our chosen variable @xmath26 in the following manner .",
    "first we expressed each of these terms as a series in @xmath491 , of order approximately 50 , which may be multiplied by @xmath492 or @xmath493 .",
    "each term in the @xmath491 series was then expanded as a series in @xmath26 to the full length of the susceptibility series ( about 2000 terms for the square lattice , for example ) , and the results added up to produce a series in @xmath26 for each short - distance and aharony and fisher scaling term .",
    "all these series were then subtracted from the susceptibility series .",
    "this formed a new series @xmath494 , singular at @xmath495 .",
    "the next step involved suppressing the effect of the competing singularities on the series .",
    "for the square lattice , the singularities of the susceptibility are given ( @xcite ) by the singularities of the @xmath249-particle contributions .",
    "these lie on the unit circle @xmath496 at the points @xmath497 , where @xmath498    for the low - temperature series , only the even-@xmath249 singularities are relevant .",
    "the asymptotic behaviour of the susceptibility near each of these singularities is given ( @xcite ) by @xmath499 , where @xmath500 is the singularity and @xmath501 .",
    "this introduced a term into the susceptibility series which behaves asymptotically as @xmath502 ( since @xmath503 ) .",
    "this has the potential to dominate the effect of the scaling term @xmath504 for large @xmath275 , since it introduces a term into the susceptibility which behaves asymptotically as @xmath505 .    the simplest procedure ( which was the one used in @xcite ) to rectify this is simply to multiply the series by @xmath506 .",
    "this changes the behaviour of the contribution from the singularity at @xmath500 to @xmath507 , but leaves the contribution from the scaling term at @xmath505 .",
    "however , because we know the exact form of the singularity , we can use a more accurate suppression . to illustrate ,",
    "we begin by observing that @xmath508 \\left(1 - \\frac{z}{z'}\\right)^p = c,\\ ] ] where @xmath509 is a constant . expressing the original singularity term as a series shows that applying @xmath510 forms the new series @xmath511 z^n\\ ] ] which completely removes the @xmath499 term .",
    "moreover , because @xmath512 this transformation also has the additional effect of suppressing @xmath513 . in other words ,",
    "the contribution to the susceptibility from this singularity goes from @xmath502 to @xmath514 when we apply this suppression , compared with @xmath507 when we simply multiply by @xmath506 .",
    "in addition , applying the integral operator to scaling terms gives @xmath515 which still contributes @xmath505 to the asymptotic behaviour of the susceptibility series .",
    "so this operator suppresses the competing singularity while not asymptotically affecting the scaling term .",
    "an unfortunate consequence of applying @xmath510 for a complex singularity is that the series resulting from ( [ eq : suppress ] ) has complex coefficients .",
    "this can be avoided by observing that since the susceptibility is real , for every singularity @xmath500 there is a corresponding singularity of the same order at @xmath516 .",
    "sequentially applying the suppression to both of these singularities results in the series @xmath517 z^n,\\ ] ] which can be seen to have real coefficients . as all we are doing is applying formula ( [ eq : suppress ] ) twice for two different singularities",
    ", the effects on the singularity and scaling terms that we observed above still hold .    in practice",
    ", we also suppress the higher - order terms @xmath518 for @xmath519 , using the above suppression formula ( with @xmath520 replaced by @xmath521 ) for each @xmath275 .",
    "the maximum @xmath275 that we use varies for each singularity and is determined empirically as described below .    for high - temperature series ,",
    "only the odd-@xmath249 singularities are relevant .",
    "the asymptotic behaviour of the susceptibility near each of these singularities is given ( @xcite ) by @xmath522 , where @xmath501 .",
    "these terms can also be suppressed by the same formula ( [ eq : suppress ] ) .",
    "this can be seen to be true because applying the same integral operator results in an analytic term for integer @xmath520 ( which is true for odd @xmath249 ) .",
    "again , we suppress a number of higher powers .    in order to determine",
    "which singularities should be suppressed and by how much , we apply a fast fourier transform diagnostic , as described in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 7 ) .",
    "we first do a preliminary fit of the series to our functions , as described in section [ sec : fit ] below , and subtract the fit from the series . the dominant unsuppressed singularity in the remainder",
    "is expressed by periodic behaviour of period @xmath523 , for a singularity located at @xmath524 . by applying fft to the remainder",
    ", we can observe the periods of the dominant unsuppressed singularities , match these to the known singularities , and increase the suppression on these singularities ( by suppressing more higher - order terms ) .",
    "this is repeated until the remainder has a satisfactorily small amplitude .",
    "the analysis of the triangular and honeycomb series is almost identical , though we must suppress the appropriate singularities ( see @xcite ) . for these lattices , it is conjectured that the singularities lie on the curve of matveev and shrock ( @xcite ) , @xmath525 we further conjecture that the singularities are given implicitly by this equation when @xmath359 takes the values @xmath526 to suppress these singularities , we again apply formula ( [ eq : suppress ] ) , assuming that the form of the singularities , and in particular the exponent @xmath501 , is the same for these lattices as for the square lattice .",
    "partial confirmation of this conjecture arises from the singularities that we observe from our fft diagnostic as we suppress singularities .",
    "we have observed the singularities corresponding to this formula for @xmath527 for @xmath528 to 8 and @xmath529 , and for @xmath530 for @xmath531 .",
    "we checked for additional singularities by analyzing both low- and high - temperature series of the triangular lattice susceptibility in the ( cube root ) nome @xmath532 .",
    "because all complex portions of the @xmath533-plane curves defined by ( [ 36 ] ) are at or within the distance to the ferromagnetic singularity , the high order series coefficients in @xmath533 will be dominated by the complex singularities . by a succession of suppressions of the dominant terms and fft diagnostics",
    "we have identified the same @xmath534 and 8 singularities as found in the @xmath25-plane ; in addition @xmath535 for @xmath536 and two singularities consistent with @xmath537 and -1.35 in ( [ 36 ] ) .",
    "the latter singularities are those on the left , upper plane arc shown in figure [ fig5 ] . from the @xmath7 series in @xmath533 we find the same @xmath538 and 7 as in the @xmath202-plane , the @xmath535 for both @xmath539 and 7 and a singularity consistent with @xmath540 in ( [ 36 ] ) and shown on the left , lower arc in figure [ fig5 ] .",
    "the singularities on the left arcs are not identifiable with any small integer values in ( [ 37 ] ) .",
    "thus , although we propose that the closed curve in figure [ fig5 ] is a natural boundary for both low and high temperature , we can only give ( [ 37 ] ) as the conjectured singularities for the right arcs corresponding to @xmath541 and @xmath348 .",
    "confirmation of this and a formula for the singularities on the left arcs can presumably be obtained by an analysis of the vaidya ( @xcite ) integrals .",
    "-plane for the ising model on the triangular lattice .",
    "the real axis cusps are the points @xmath542 ; the other two are @xmath543 .",
    "the right side arcs are defined by @xmath348 and @xmath544 .",
    "the left arcs correspond to straight line segments lying on either side of the cuts , @xmath545 in @xmath245 and @xmath546 in @xmath25 .",
    "crosses mark the singularities found in the series analysis described in the text . for clarity ,",
    "the singularities for @xmath8 are shown only in the upper half plane , those for @xmath7 in the lower half . ]",
    "once all the singularities are suppressed , we fit the series to our scaling functions .",
    "we use only terms which are known ( or assumed ) to be nonzero , and leave out the known ( and removed ) aharony and fisher scaling terms . in other words",
    ", we fit to the linear combination @xmath547 with @xmath548 our fitting coefficients .",
    "firstly , we convert each term in this expression from @xmath1 to our series variable @xmath26 , as described in section [ sec : convert ] .",
    "we then apply the singularity suppression that we applied to our susceptibility series to these fitting functions , so that the required equality between the two functions is maintained even though both functions have been changed by the suppression .",
    "finally we fit the suppressed series to the linear combination of our suppressed fitting functions .",
    "suppose that the transformed and suppressed fitting function ( [ eq : fit ] ) is @xmath549 , while the subtracted and suppressed susceptibility series is @xmath494 .",
    "we choose the amplitudes to minimise the expression @xmath550 the range of @xmath193 in the sum can be varied , but we always choose @xmath551 to be the largest available power of @xmath26 in our susceptibility series .",
    "in addition , varying @xmath552 will change the fitted amplitudes , which gives an idea of how accurate our fit is .    for the honeycomb lattice high - temperature series , we conduct two separate fits , one at the ferromagnetic point ( with additional suppression of the antiferromagnetic singularity ) and one at the antiferromagnetic point ( with additional suppression of the ferromagnetic singularity ) .",
    "in fact we also did this for the square lattice , to check for an antiferromagnetic scaling term .",
    "we found no such scaling term , which is consistent with the results in @xcite .",
    "once the initial fitting has been done , we can improve the accuracy of our fits by iteratively subtracting the new fit ( or fits ) , re - suppressing singularities ( replicating this in our fitting functions ) and fitting again to the remainder , and so on .",
