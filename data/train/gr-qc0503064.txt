    "recent observations suggest that majority of the universe is the unknown : 27% is matter ( and only 4% is ordinary matter ) and the rest is the cosmological constant ( or dark energy ) @xcite . since the cosmological constant is interpreted as a vacuum energy @xcite , these observations indicate that the energy density of the vacuum energy is @xmath4 .",
    "on the other hand , a field theoretical estimate of zero point energy of the vacuum yields the planck energy @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , the mismatch between observations and the theory is huge : @xmath6 . this mismatch is called the cosmological constant problem ( ccp ) @xcite and still remains to be solved .",
    "dvali _ et al._@xcite has suggested the mechanism of diluting the cosmological constant by using brane world models with codimension greater than 2 . in this mechanism",
    "the observed effective cosmological constant related to the expansion rate becomes small because whose energy is consumed to bend the bulk space even if the bare vacuum energy ( brane tension ) is as large as the planck scale .",
    "the success of the mechanism rests on the conjectured relation in higher dimension @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the @xmath9-dimensional planck mass and @xmath10 is the four dimensional ( bare ) vacuum energy ( brane tension ) .",
    "if the number of extra dimensions @xmath3 is greater than @xmath11 , the expansion rate @xmath1 is inversely proportional to the brane tension @xmath10 .",
    "then the smallness of the cosmological constant could be explained by the largeness of the brane tension .",
    "cho and vilenkin ( extending the analytic solutions in @xcite ) have recently constructed numerical solutions of a global defect in seven ( @xmath12 ) dimensional spacetime @xcite .",
    "they obtained numerical solutions of an inflating global defect if the symmetric breaking scale is greater than the higher dimensional planck scale .",
    "then the inflation rate is found to grow almost linearly as the brane tension is increased , which is opposite to what is needed to solve the cosmological constant problem ( [ eq : dgsconj ] ) .    the main purpose of this paper is to extend cho and vilenkin s model to the arbitrary @xmath9-dimensional one and find numerical solutions without `` cigar ansatz '' and to examine the relation among the number of extra - dimensions , the energy density and the expansion rate .",
    "we shall find that the conjectured relation ( [ eq : dgsconj ] ) does not hold even by using our new bulk solutions in other extra dimensions @xmath13 .",
    "however we find that the brane s expansion rate is a monotonically decreasing function of the number of the extra dimensions @xmath3 and can vanish at the specific dimension .    in the following section , we introduce the model in sec .",
