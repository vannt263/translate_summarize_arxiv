    "a likely interpretation is reduced pah emission in star - forming regions in the vicinity of an agn due to destruction of the pah carriers by x - ray and far - uv photons from the agn @xcite .",

    "this could indicate higher sfr in the obscured agn , or , alternatively , higher abundance of pah carriers due to absorption by the obscuring material of the energetic photons from the agn .",
    "however , the statistical significance of this result is not strong due to the small number of sources contributing to the obscured agn average , and requires validation in larger samples .",
    "a selection bias favouring obscured sources with strong pah emission could also be responsible for the increased pah luminosity , but we have not found any likely bias able to increase pah luminosity in obscured agn but not in qsos . in example , the pah features increase the observed flux in the selection band at @xmath2 @xmath3 1 , where we find roughly half of the obscured agn , but these sources are bright enough to be selected even without contribution from pah emission to the 15-m flux . since the pah features help to find a redshift estimate in many sources , this could play a role in the observed asymmetry , because most redshifts for agn2 sources rely on the irs spectrum , while most qsos have optical spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "but in agn2 sources a reliable redshift estimate can usually be obtained from the ( absorption ) silicate feature alone , and indeed all sources with unreliable redshifts are classified as agn1 .",
    "in addition , a lower accuracy in redshifts obtained from the silicate feature relative to those from optical spectroscopy imply that pah features may be blurred in the agn2 composite , leading to an underestimation of their real strength .",
    "another possible interpretation could be lower mir luminosity in obscured agn than in qsos of the same intrinsic luminosity , as is expected if the putative torus is optically thick in the mir ; but this is not supported by measurements of the luminosity ratio between x - rays and mir @xcite .",
    "a strong difference in sfr between optical type 1 and type 2 agn has been observed in a sample of qsos and qso2s from the sdss @xcite .",
    "using estimates from the [ o ii ] 3727   line , they find a sfr an order of magnitude higher in type 2 sources , and this is probably a lower limit , due to higher extinction in the optical .",
    "such a large difference between type 1 and 2 sources can hardly be explained within the agn unification scheme , and might indicate instead that the agn classification into type 1 or type 2 does not depend exclusively on the orientation of an agn torus .",
    "recent papers suggest that a fraction of the obscuration in type 2 agn occurs in the host galaxy : @xcite find a correlation between silicate extinction and orientation of the plane of the galaxy , while @xcite suggest that foreground extinction by cold dust is required to reproduce both the silicate feature and nir continuum for almost half of the sources in a sample of mir selected obscured agn .",
    "if we assume that the extinction law for dust in the torus is similar to that found in local ulirgs and in the galactic centre , it reaches a minimum in opacity at @xmath37 m and increases towards shorter wavelengths ; thus the optical depth is higher in the nir than at 7 m. if the silicate absorption feature originates in the torus , a decrease in the viewing angle of the torus should produce a deeper silicate feature and weaker and steeper nir continuum peaking at longer wavelengths ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the only agn2 source that separates slightly from the general trend is eirs-52 , but its spectrum is still better described by the torus model ; therefore , a dusty torus is favored as the source of the obscuration in the elais - irs agn .",

    "the relatively shallow depth of the optical data in the elais - irs sample and the requirement of optical photometric or spectroscopic redshifts for source candidates favours the selection of weakly obscured sources , contrarily to other mir high-@xmath2 ulirg samples where highly obscured sources are preferred , and thus turns the elais - irs sample into a valuable complement for the study of the high-@xmath2 ulirg population .",
    "redshift estimates for the elais - irs sources from their mir spectrum are reliable for obscured or star - forming sources , and unreliable in many unobscured agn .",
    "this behaviour is the opposite to that obtained through optical spectroscopy , and thus guarantees that reliable redshift estimates can be obtained by one or other means for most ir sources .",
    "a combination of mir diagnostic criteria efficiently separates starbursts , obscured and unobscured agn , with a good correlation to the optical classification .",
    "the selection criteria of the elais - irs sample favour the selection of starburst - dominated sources at 0.6 @xmath26 @xmath2 @xmath26 1.2 , yet most galaxies selected in this range are agn - dominated .",
    "this suggests that the population of @xmath120 @xmath1 1 mjy sources at @xmath2 @xmath17 1 is dominated by agn .",
    "the averaged spectrum of elais - irs starbursts is similar to that of local ulirgs , but the observed depth of the silicate feature , strength of pah features and pah flux ratios are more alike to those found in lower - luminosity starburst galaxies .",
    "this behaviour has already been observed in higher - redshift starburst samples and could be related to star formation extending over larger regions or a higher gas - to - dust ratio in the galaxy .",
    "the correlation between mir and fir seds allows the estimation of ir luminosities from the mir spectrum with a factor 3 uncertainty . if mips70 and/or mips160 photometry is available the uncertainty reduces further and becomes dominated by uncertainties in the photometry and in the sed models .",
    "the mean sfr in elais - irs qsos estimated from pah luminosity is 50 - 100 @xmath5 , but its implied fir emission is 310 times lower than that obtained from stacking analysis in the 70 and 160 m bands , thus suggesting the pah emission in substantially depleted in most qsos .",
    "a lower pah - to - continuum luminosity ratio is found in the most luminous qsos relative to lower - luminosity ones , suggesting a saturation of the correlation between star formation and agn activity found in other samples of lower - luminosity sources or , alternatively , higher depletion rates of the pah carriers in the galaxies hosting the most powerful agn .    in the obscured agn ,",
    "the mean sfr is 23 times higher than in qsos of the same luminosity .",
    "if confirmed in larger samples , this could indicate a connection between dust obscuration and star formation in the host galaxy .",

    "<S> redshifts were obtained from optical spectroscopy , photometric redshifts and from the irs spectra . </S>",
    "<S> the later turn out to be reliable for obscured and/or star - forming sources , thus becoming an ideal complement to optical spectroscopy for redshift estimation .    </S>",

    "<S> we also estimate integrated 81000 m infrared luminosities via spectral energy distribution fitting to mir and far - infrared ( fir ) photometry from the spitzer wide - area infrared extragalactic survey ( swire ) and the mir spectrum . based on these measurements , </S>",
    "<S> we classify the spectra using well - known infrared diagnostics , as well as a new one that we propose , into three types of source : those dominated by an unobscured agn , mostly corresponding to optical quasars ( qsos ) , those dominated by an obscured agn , and starburst - dominated sources . </S>",

    "<S> the estimated mean sfr in the qsos is 50100 @xmath5 , but the implied fir luminosity is 310 times lower than that obtained from stacking analysis of the fir photometry , suggesting destruction of the pah carriers by energetic photons from the agn . </S>",
    "<S> the sfr estimated in obscured agn is 23 times higher than in qsos of similar mir luminosity </S>",
    "<S> . this discrepancy might not be due to luminosity effects or selection bias alone , but could instead indicate a connection between obscuration and star formation . </S>",
