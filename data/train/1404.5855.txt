    "@xmath45 too decreases steadily until is no longer bound .    with @xmath8()@xmath50 holding over the full range of variation exhibited in table  [ tab : nn ] ,",
    "it is clear that the behavior of @xmath46 ( ) follows closely that of @xmath45 .",
    "for fairly small values of @xmath45 , say @xmath51  mev , @xmath45 is quite accurately reproduced by the effective - range expansion approximation @xmath52 as shown by comparing the exact and approximate values of @xmath45 listed in the table .",
    "it is worth noting in table  [ tab : nn ] that the dissociation of occurs while the dineutron is still bound , although quite weakly .",
    "the final result of no bound state , for a virtual dineutron and @xmath29 low - energy scattering parameters listed in the caption to table  [ tab : nn ] , should come at no surprise given that a considerably larger - size @xmath29 scattering length was found to be required in the faddeev calculations listed in table  [ tab : acrit ] to bind . although a specific value of 2.5  fm for the @xmath29 effective range was used in our actual demonstration , similar results are obtained for other reasonable choices of the @xmath29 effective range .",
    "we have shown in this work that the @xmath29 interactions required to bind are inconsistent with the measured @xmath31 scattering cross sections at low energies , with @xmath53 binding energy , and with the @xmath54@xmath55 excitation energy of the @xmath3 @xmath5 hypernuclei .",
    "although simple @xmath29 interactions were used to simulate the more realistic nsc97 interactions , the consequences of accepting a bound for @xmath5 hypernuclear data are sufficiently strong that the use of more refined interactions is unlikely to modify any of the conclusions reached here .",
    "of the three hypernuclear systems related here to , we attach special significance to the @xmath3 @xmath5 hypernuclei where only the 1.1  mev @xmath54@xmath55 excitation energy is involved in our model building .",
    "this excitation energy is intimately connected to @xmath32 coupling effects in the @xmath3 hypernuclei @xcite which have been further incorporated and tested successfully to reproduce excitation spectra in @xmath56-shell hypernuclei @xcite .",
    "we judiciously avoided relying on the absolute binding energy of the @xmath54 of the @xmath3 @xmath5 hypernuclei because it has not been yet reproduced satisfactorily in few - body calculations that use theoretically derived @xmath19 potentials , as stressed recently by nogga  @xcite .",
    "this difficulty might be associated with missing three - body @xmath18 interaction terms , other than those incorporated here by including @xmath32 coupling .    of the @xmath18 interactions considered in past hypernuclear calculations , those arising from an intermediate @xmath57 hyperon resonance @xcite are independent of the spin of the @xmath5 and",
    "thus would not affect the @xmath54@xmath55 spin - flip excitation upon which our considerations rest .",
    "the spin - isospin dependence of the central component of this interaction is given by @xmath58 which assumes the same value @xmath59 for both @xmath60 states in the @xmath33 hypernuclei . a dispersive @xmath18 repulsive contribution with @xmath5 spin dependence given by ( 1+@xmath61 ) , where @xmath62 , was considered in vmc calculations of light hypernuclei @xcite .",
    "this gives 1(@xmath63 ) for the @xmath64 @xmath33 states , namely more repulsion for than for @xmath53 .",
    "another form of dispersive @xmath18 contribution suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite depends on spin and isospin through the factor @xmath65 which assumes values @xmath66 for the @xmath67 , @xmath60 states , repulsive for while attractive for @xmath53 .",
    "the latter two dispersive @xmath18 interaction forms were found in ref .",
    "@xcite capable of accounting for a substantial fraction of the @xmath54@xmath55 excitation in the @xmath3 hypernuclei , but obviously neither of them would add attraction to relative to @xmath53 .",
    "this brief survey of three - body @xmath18 phenomenology offers , therefore , no plausible solution of the puzzle .",
    "a comment on csb effects in light @xmath5 hypernuclei and whether or not csb might resolve the puzzle is in order before concluding the present study . for the known @xmath68 isodoublet of @xmath3 hypernuclear @xmath54 levels @xmath69@xmath70@xmath71()@xmath24@xmath8()=0.35@xmath90.04  mev @xcite is exceptionally large and defies explanation in modern @xmath19 interaction models , see table  9 in ref .",
    "@xcite where the recently constructed nlo chiral @xmath19 interactions  @xcite are shown to yield only @xmath72  kev .",
    "this @xmath73 arises largely from kinetic energies depending on which charged @xmath74 hyperon mass is used .",
    "the same csb effect will result in smaller @xmath8 ( ) values relative to those calculated , as done here , using a charge symmetric calculation .",
    "therefore , csb contributions are also unlikely to resolve the puzzle .",
    "how does one then explain the hyphi @xmath25 signal which is naturally assigned to the two - body weak decay @xmath75 ? this problem is aggravated by a similar one addressing a @xmath76 signal , also observed in the hyphi experiment , the most straightforward assignment of which would be due to the two - body weak decay of a bound @xmath77 system : @xmath78 .",
