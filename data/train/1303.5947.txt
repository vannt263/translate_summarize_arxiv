    "recent advance in wireless communication has shifted from single - user multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) to multi - user mimo systems , which greatly enhances the performance by transmitting to multiple users simultaneously via spatial multiplexing .",
    "the capacity region of a single - cell mu - mimo downlink system , also called mimo broadcast channel ( bc ) , is achieved by the non - linear `` dirty paper coding ( dpc ) '' scheme @xcite , which is of high implementation complexity .",
    "other studies have thus proposed low - complexity linear mimo precoder designs , e.g. , block diagonalization @xcite .",
    "a common drawback of the above schemes is the requirement of instantaneous and highly accurate channel state information ( csi ) at the transmitter , which is practically difficult to realize .",
    "the single - beam `` opportunistic beamforming ( obf ) '' and multi - beam `` random beamforming ( rbf ) '' schemes for the single - cell multiple - input single - output ( miso ) bc , introduced in @xcite and @xcite , respectively , have attracted a great deal of attention since they require only _ partial _ csi fedback to the transmitter at each base station ( bs ) .",
    "the fundamental idea in these schemes is to achieve nearly interference - free downlink transmissions by exploiting the multi - user channel diversity with _ opportunistic _ user scheduling .",
    "it has been shown that the achievable sum - rates with the rbf and optimal dpc both scale identically as the number of users in the cell approaches infinity , for any given signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this shows the optimality of rbf in the regime of large number of users and has motivated extensive subsequent studies on , e.g. , sum - rate characterization @xcite , @xcite , quantized channel feedback @xcite-@xcite , and precoder design with opportunistic scheduling @xcite , @xcite .",
    "however , most existing studies of rbf have only considered the single - cell setup .",
    "one recent progress was made in our prior work @xcite , in which the rate performance of multi - cell miso rbf systems is investigated in both the finite - snr and asymptotically high - snr regimes .",
    "furthermore , the effect of _ receive spatial diversity _ on the rate performance of rbf with multi - antenna receivers is not yet fully characterized in the literature , even in the single - cell case .",
    "note that some prior works have studied rbf under a single - cell mimo setup , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "assuming that the number of users goes to infinity for any given snr , it has been shown therein that rbf schemes with single- or multi - antenna receivers achieve the same sum - rate scaling law with the growing number of users .",
    "the conventional asymptotic analysis thus leads to a pessimistic result that receive spatial diversity provides only _ marginal _ gains to the achievable rate of rbf @xcite , @xcite .",
    "in contrast , in this paper , we investigate the achievable rate of a multi - cell mimo rbf system with different receive spatial diversity techniques in the _ high - snr _ regime .",
    "we aim to characterize the achievable degrees of freedom ( dof ) trade - offs in multi - cell mimo rbf systems , where the dof is defined as the individual sum - rate of each cell normalized by the logarithm of the per - cell snr as snr goes to infinity .",
    "thereby , we provide a succinct characterization of the interplays among the receive spatial diversity , multiuser diversity , spatial multiplexing gain , inter-/intra - cell interferences , and bss collaborative transmission in multi - cell rbf systems .",
    "it is worth noting that the high - snr dof analysis for interference channels has become a major research topic inspired by the invention of a novel transmission technique so - called `` interference alignment ( ia ) '' ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "although ia - based dof studies provide useful insights to the optimal transmission design for interference - limited multi - cell systems , they have in general assumed the perfect csi at bss .",
    "furthermore , how to efficiently schedule the users transmissions in ia - based systems with a significantly larger number of users than that of transmitting antennas remains open .",
    "some promising results on this regard can be found in @xcite-@xcite and the references therein .",
    "investigation on the multi - cell cooperative downlink precoding / beamforming at finite snrs has also been pursued in the literature under two different assumptions on the cooperation level among bss , i.e. , the `` fully cooperative '' multi - cell systems with global transmit messages sharing across all bss @xcite-@xcite and `` partially cooperative ' ' counterparts with only locally available transmit message at each bs @xcite-@xcite .",
    "furthermore , there has been recent work on the asymptotic analysis for multi - cell mimo downlink systems based on a large - system approach , in which the number of users per cell and the number of transmit antennas per bs both go to infinity at the same time with a fixed ratio @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the main results of this paper are summarized as follows .    * * multi - cell mimo rbf * : we propose three mimo rbf schemes for multi - cell downlink systems . in these schemes ,",
    "rbf is applied at each bs and either the minimum - mean - square - error ( mmse ) , matched filter ( mf ) , or antenna selection ( as ) based spatial receiver is employed at each mobile terminal ( denoted as rbf - mmse , rbf - mf , and rbf - as schemes , respectively ) .",
    "these schemes preserve the same low - feedback requirement as that for the special case of single - cell obf / rbf @xcite , @xcite , but bring in the new benefits of receive spatial diversity with different performance - complexity trade - offs . * * sinr distribution * : by applying the tools from _ multivariate analysis _ ( mva ) , we derive the exact distribution of the signal - to - interference - plus - noise ratio ( sinr ) at each multi - antenna receiver in a multi - cell mimo rbf system subject to both the intra- and inter - cell interferences , assuming either the mmse , mf , or as based spatial diversity technique .",
    "note that these results are non - trivial extensions of our previous work @xcite for the miso rbf case with only single - antenna receivers . *",
    "* dof region characterization * : we further investigate the multi - cell mimo rbf system with mmse , mf , or as based spatial receivers under the asymptotically high - snr regime , by assuming that the number of users per cell scales in a certain order with the snr ( a larger scaling order indicates a higher user density in one particular cell ) .",
    "we first derive the achievable sum - rate dof under a single - cell setup without the inter - cell interference to gain useful insights and then obtain a general characterization of the dof region for the multi - cell case , which constitutes all the achievable dof tuples for the individual sum - rate of all the cells subject to the additional inter - cell interference .",
    "our analysis reveals that significant sum - rate dof gains can be achieved by employing the mmse - based spatial receiver as compared to the cases with single - antenna receivers or with the suboptimal spatial receivers such as mf and as .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to the existing result ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) that spatial diversity receivers only yield marginal rate gains in rbf , which is based on the conventional asymptotic analysis in the regime of large number of users but with fixed snr per cell . with mmse receivers",
    ", our result shows that a significantly less number of users in each cell is required to achieve a given sum - rate dof target as compared to the cases without receiver spatial diversity or with mf / as receivers .",
    "our new high - snr dof analysis thus provides a more realistic characterization of the rate trade - offs in multi - cell mimo rbf systems .",

    "<S> , we study a multi - cell multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) broadcast system with rbf applied at each base station ( bs ) and either the minimum - mean - square - error ( mmse ) , matched filter ( mf ) , or antenna selection ( as ) based spatial receiver employed at each mobile terminal . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the effect of different spatial diversity receivers on the achievable sum - rate of multi - cell rbf systems subject to both the intra- and inter - cell interferences . </S>",
    "<S> we first derive closed - form expressions for the distributions of the receiver signal - to - interference - plus - noise ratio ( sinr ) with different spatial diversity techniques , based on which we compare their rate performances at finite signal - to - noise ratios ( snrs ) . </S>",
    "<S> we then investigate the asymptotically high - snr regime and for a tractable analysis assume that the number of users in each cell scales in a certain order with the per - cell snr as snr goes to infinity . under this setup </S>",
    "<S> , we characterize the degrees of freedom ( dof ) region for multi - cell rbf systems with different types of spatial receivers , which consists of all the achievable dof tuples for the individual sum - rate of all the cells . </S>",
    "<S> the dof region analysis provides a succinct characterization of the interplays among the receive spatial diversity , multiuser diversity , spatial multiplexing gain , inter-/intra - cell interferences , and bss collaborative transmission .    </S>",
