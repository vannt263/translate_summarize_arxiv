    "<S> this anisotropy together with the anisotropy coming from the spin - orbit impurities leads to 9 different fourier modes in the cooperon to the second order in @xmath23 as opposed to only one mode for the hln model . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , our expansion in the spin - orbit impurity strength shows more explicitly the fact that this calculation is perturbative in @xmath23 and should be restricted to small values of the perturbative parameter as the odd powers of the series expansion contribute negatively to the conductivity .    in general symmetry terms , the massless dirac fermion model stays in the symplectic class for all values of the impurity spin - orbit coupling , as the square of the time reversal operator @xmath99 </S>",
    "<S> this explains why wal is always observed for dirac fermions . in the hln formula , </S>",
    "<S> the introduction of the impurity spin - orbit coupling is responsible for a crossover from the orthogonal class @xmath100 when @xmath101 to the symplectic ( `` pseudo - unitary''-component of the spin for a strictly 2d system , and the triplet state with no net magnetization along the @xmath37-axis is not suppressed . as a consequence , the singlet and triplet compensate each other , resulting in no correction to conductivity . </S>",
    "<S> this is similar to the unitary class where trs is broken and all four states are suppressed . ] ) class when @xmath102 for quasi-2degs ( strictly 2degs ) .    </S>",

    "<S> _ we have derived the magnetoconductivity corrections for the surface states of 3d ti in the presence of scalar and spin - orbit impurity disorder . </S>",
    "<S> this is expected to be directly relevant to the experimental analysis of these materials . </S>",
    "<S> we showed the profound difference between the hln model for parabolic dispersion and the massless dirac fermion model . </S>",
    "<S> for the latter we predict wal in the presence as well as in the absence of spin - orbit impurity scattering , while the diffusion constant and the longitudinal conductivity are renormalized to the first order in the spin - orbit scattering strength .    </S>",
