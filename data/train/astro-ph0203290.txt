    "in the unified picture of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) ( miller & antonucci 1983 ; antonucci & miller 1985 ; antonucci 1993 ) , the soft - x - ray spectra of seyfert  2 galaxies are expected to be affected by emission and scattering from a medium strongly influenced by the nuclear continuum .",
    "however , soft x - rays can also be produced through mechanical heating , as in shocks driven by supernova explosions in nuclear star - forming regions , or shocks created in or by outflowing material .",
    "it is quite plausible that both effects are important , i.e. , the spectra contain a combination of separate components of warm plasma whose emission is predominantly `` radiation - driven '' ( dominated by photoionization and photoexcitation ) and hot plasma whose emission is predominantly `` collision - driven '' ( dominated by electron - impact ionizations and excitations at a temperature consistent with the observed line energies ) . since the same ionic transitions are expected in both types of plasma , distinguishing between these different emission mechanisms with the limited ccd - type spectral resolution available on previous observatories has not been possible .    a recent , high - resolution _ chandra _  hetgs  spectrum of the seyfert  2 , markarian  3 , showed unambiguously that much of the soft - x - ray emission from that source is produced through radiative recombination in photoionized plasma @xcite .",
    "several resonance transitions ( 1s@xmath1np ) , though , were stronger than expected for pure recombination .",
    "an additional , hot , collisionally - ionized component was suggested by this excess .",
    "however , the lack of accompanying strong fe  l - shell lines argued against that possibility , and was instead consistent with recombination in a photoionized plasma @xcite .",
    "sako et  al .",
    "( 2000b ) pointed out that the same nuclear continuum responsible for photoionizing the plasma may also photoexcite the ionic resonance transitions , producing line emission through radiative decay back to the ground state @xcite .",
    "therefore , they asserted that the soft - x - ray emission from markarian  3 could be explained in its entirety as reemission in warm plasma both photoionized and photoexcited by the inferred nuclear continuum .",
    "this model is consistent with reprocessed emission from the warm absorbing medium typically observed in seyfert  1 galaxies , but now viewed from a different angle .    in this paper , we present the first high - resolution x - ray spectrum of the prototypical seyfert  2 galaxy ngc  1068 .",
    "ngc  1068  has a rich observational history , starting with its original , though less commonly used , designation as m77 @xcite .",
    "various independent studies in the optical early on confirmed its `` nebular''-type emission - line spectrum @xcite .",
    "it appeared as the first object in seyfert s historic list @xcite and , more recently , provided the first convincing evidence for a unified model of agn  @xcite .",
    "extensive studies at all wavelengths have upheld this model : broad optical emission lines in polarized light @xcite , the existence of highly collimated bipolar radio jets ( wilson & ulvestad 1982 ; wilson & ulvestad 1983 ; pedlar et  al .",
    "1989 ) , biconical  emission regions @xcite , reflected x - ray emission of an obscured nucleus ( monier & halpern 1987 ; elvis & lawrence 1988 ; koyama et  al .",
    "1989 ) , and a soft - x - ray component that lies significantly above the reflected continuum ( marshall et  al . 1993 ; ueno et  al .",
    "1994 ) .",
    "we show below  using a new , simple radiative transfer code  that the soft - x - ray spectrum of ngc  1068 , obtained with the _ xmm - newton",
    "_  reflection grating spectrometer ( rgs ) , can be explained in its entirety as emission from warm , irradiated plasma ( as in markarian  3 ) , which reprocesses the nuclear continuum incident on it through recombination / radiative cascade following photoionization and radiative decay following photoexcitation .",
    "the format of our paper is as follows . in  [ sec : obs ] we begin with a discussion of the observations and data analysis .",
    "detailed spectral analysis is presented in  [ sec : spec ] , followed by interpretation in terms of possible emission mechanisms in  [ sec : int ] . in  [ sec : novel ] , we discuss a novel method for inferring geometrical / dynamical properties of the ionization cone from the observed relative amount of photoionization versus photoexcitation . we discuss the remarkably consistent fits we obtain using this method in  [ sec : finalfit ] . finally , in ",
    "[ sec : dis ] , we discuss the implications of these fits , including the connection between the observed large - scale ionization cone and generic warm absorbers .",
    "ngc  1068  was observed with _ xmm - newton _  for 110 ks starting at 5:48:05 ut on 2000 july 29 .",
    "data were taken simultaneously for the epic   detectors mos  and pn , the optical monitor , and the rgs .",
    "all data were processed with the _ xmm - newton _  science analysis software , sas  5.2 , with the corresponding calibration files available for that version .",
    "we concentrate in this paper mainly on the data from the rgs , which was operated in its normal spectroscopy mode . however ,",
    "in order to confirm the negligible effect of source size and position on the extracted rgs  spectrum , we also present a cursory analysis of the pn  image below .",
    "the rgs  covers the wavelength range of approximately 6 to 38    ( @xmath5@xmath6  kev ) with a resolution of 0.05   , and a peak effective area of about 140  @xmath7 at 15   .",
    "the sas  filters the observed rgs  events in dispersion channel versus ccd - pulse - height space to separate the spectral orders .",
    "the background is estimated using events from a region spatially offset from the source .",
    "the wavelengths assigned to the dispersion channels are based on the pointing and geometry of the telescope with an overall accuracy of 8  m  ( 1-@xmath8 ) across the total wavelength range , which is 120  km  s@xmath9 at 20   .",
    "similarly , the estimated uncertainty in line broadening is 5  m(1-@xmath8 ) , which is 75  km  s@xmath9 at 20   .",
    "based on ground calibration , we expect the 1-@xmath8 uncertainty in the effective area to be less than 10% above 9    and at most 20% for shorter wavelengths @xcite .",
    "independent , fluxed spectra from the rgs  1 ( red ) and rgs  2 ( blue ) instruments for all 110 ks of data for the @xmath10 order are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] .",
    "the spectral discontinuities are due to chip gaps , bad pixels , and the previous in - flight loss of one ccd  for rgs  2 ( @xmath1124   ) .",
    "overall , the fluxed spectra agree to @xmath12% .",
    "the soft - x - ray spectrum of ngc  1068  ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] ) is dominated by line emission .",
    "emission lines from h - like and he - like c , n , o , ne , mg , and si are all clearly detected .",
    "numerous fe  l - shell emission lines ( to ) are present as well . many higher - order resonance transitions ( 1s@xmath1np ) in h - like and he - like ions",
    "labelled ly@xmath13@xmath14 and he@xmath13@xmath14 , respectively , are prominent , with evidence for strong emission from even higher order transitions as well .",
    "several unidentified features located in the bottom panel of fig .  [ fig : spectrum ] ( e.g. , at 27.92 , 30.4 , 34.034.6 , and 36.38   ) are likely due to l - shell emission from mid - z ions such as si or s. a bright fluorescent line for fe  k is observed in the mos / pn   ccd - resolution data , but the rgs  does not extend in wavelength down to fe  k. we report marginal detection of the fluorescent line of neutral si in the rgs  spectrum ; there is no other evidence for any other significant fluorescent line emission .",
    "we see no significant continuum emission in the spectrum .      by performing joint fits to the separate @xmath10 and @xmath15 orders within xspec  @xcite , we have measured line fluxes , widths , and shifts for all relatively bright lines which have been unambiguously identified ( table  [ tab : lines ] ) .",
    "the measured fluxes take into account the galactic column density of @xmath16  @xmath17 @xcite using the neutral absorption model _",
    "tbabs _ ( wilms , allen , & mccray 2000 ) in xspec .",
    "line shifts are measured with respect to the systemic redshift of ngc  1068  of @xmath18 or @xmath19  km  s@xmath9 ( huchra , vogeley , & geller 1999 ) .",
    "the brightness of ngc  1068  coupled with the duration of the observation , implies that all the listed errors ( representing @xmath201-@xmath8 ) of the unblended lines are dominated by instrumental uncertainty ( see  [ sec : obs ] ) and not by counting statistics .",
    "for example , there are approximately 6050 and 1880 total counts in the forbidden line ( rgs  1 alone ) and the ly@xmath21 line ( rgs  1 and rgs  2 ) , respectively , implying counting errors of 1.3% and 2.3% ; these errors are much less than the effective area uncertainty of 10% .",
    "we find that most emission lines in the rgs  spectrum are shifted and appear broader than expected for monochromatic lines ( table  [ tab : lines ] ) .",
    "the line shifts are due to velocity shifts at the source and not , for example , due to an absolute pointing error .",
    "the position of the nominal centroid of the x - ray emission in the pn  image with a ccd - determined energy cut consistent with the rgs  waveband ( fig .",
    "[ fig : contour ] ) has been used to derive the rgs  spectrum .",
    "gaussian fits to the pn  image using several different ccd - resolution energy cuts yield centroids all within 0.5 of each other , proving that possible spatial stratification of different emission zones is insignificant .",
    "the overall positional uncertainty between the pn  and rgs  instruments is less than the absolute pointing uncertainty of the telescope of 4 , implying a robust upper limit on the line shift uncertainty of 8  m  ( 120  km  s@xmath9 at 20   ) .",
    "significant velocity blueshifts from roughly @xmath22 to @xmath23  km  s@xmath9 have been measured from the rgs  spectrum ( table  [ tab : lines ] ) .",
    "line blueshifts of each ionic line series are fairly consistent .",
    "longer wavelength lines appear to have higher blueshifts .",
    "overall , the observed blueshifts are comparable to blueshifts of optical / uv  emission lines ( grimes , kriss , & espey 1999 ; kraemer & crenshaw 2000 ) , though , in contrast to these observations , we find no evidence for any significant redshifts .",
    "the widths we measure are similarly due to intrinsic velocity distributions at the source .",
    "chandra _  image of ngc  1068  ( young , wilson , & shopbell 2001 ) shows evidence for weak extended emission on scales of tens of arcseconds ( fig .",
    "[ fig : contour_large ] ) .",
    "the effect of spatial broadening in the rgs  spectrum for this source , characterized by a strongly peaked central component and weak extended emission , is negligible ( a.  rasmussen , private comm . ) .",
    "therefore , any excess broadening of particular lines can only be due to velocity distributions at the source .",
    "measured velocity widths are also presented in table  [ tab : lines ] .",
    "all widths lie in the range @xmath24@xmath25  km  s@xmath9 , which is consistent with the linewidths associated with the narrow - line - emitting regions observed in the uv   ( grimes , kriss , & espey 1999 ) .",
    "the spectrum also includes very distinctive radiative recombination continua ( rrc ) for h - like and he - like c , n , and o , which are produced when electrons recombine directly to the ground state of these highly - ionized species .",
    "rrc  are broad features for hot , collisionally - ionized plasma , but are narrow , prominent features for cooler photoionized plasma .",
    "the narrow width of these rrc  provide a direct measure of the recombining electron temperature @xcite .    for those rrc  which are clearly detected ( , , , , , and )",
    ", we were able to determine accurate temperatures from the rrc  profile itself ( table  [ tab : rrc ] ) .",
    "the unblended rrc  ( on the short wavelength side ) of and provide the best temperature determinations . for the other rrc , the dominant source of uncertainty comes from blending with other nearby lines .",
    "all temperatures are consistent with the conservative range of @xmath0 few  ev .",
    "these temperatures imply velocity broadening of all features by @xmath26  km  s@xmath9 . this broadening is much lower than the observed broadening of @xmath27  km  s@xmath9 , implying the importance of bulk and/or turbulent cloud velocities .",
    "higher temperatures of @xmath2830  ev were inferred from the broad , polarized , electron - scattered optical lines ( miller , goodrich , & mathews 1991 ) .",
    "but these temperatures are really only upper limits , since nonthermal broadening due to bulk and/or turbulent cloud velocities , as observed in the x - ray , could also be present .    weak features at the positions of the rrc  from and are also detected , though severe blending makes a temperature determination difficult in these cases .",
    "their inferred temperatures are not necessarily discrepant with the range given for the other ions , though significantly hotter temperatures can not be excluded .",
    "in addition to the prominent @xmath29 transitions in the h - like and he - like ions , the unique combination of high resolution and large effective area characteristic of the rgs  allows for the detection and flux measurement of several discrete higher - order resonance transitions ( np@xmath11s ) , as well as blended higher - order transitions leading up to the rrc  edge . for the h - like ions , we list the observed ratios of these transitions to the ly@xmath21 line in table  [ tab : hratios ] , where we also give the ratios expected for recombination in a warm , photoionized plasma and for hotter plasma in collisional equilibrium . for the he - like ions , we list the observed ratios of these transitions to the forbidden line in table  [ tab : heratios ] , together with the ratios expected for recombination . here",
    ", we do not provide the ratios expected for a hotter plasma in collisional equilibrium , because the strong dependence of the relative strength of the forbidden line on temperature would make that comparison meaningless .      for he - like n and o , we present measurements of the standard plasma diagnostic ratios @xmath30 and @xmath31 @xcite in table  [ tab : rif ] , where @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 are the resonance , intercombination , and forbidden line fluxes . also listed are the ratios expected for recombination in a warm , photoionized plasma and for hotter plasma in collisional equilibrium .",
    "unambiguous evidence for the predominance of emission in a photoionized plasma comes primarily from the observed bright rrc , which indicate recombination at a temperature around a few ev .",
    "in addition , as we explain in detail below , the ratios of the intercombination and forbidden lines to the rrc  are very close to the values expected for pure recombination ( see  [ sec : oxygen ] and bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : oxygen ] ) . the @xmath35 ratio for ( table  [ tab : rif ] ) also appears to favor pure recombination , though the @xmath35 ratio for is somewhat ambiguous ( see  [ sec : oxygen ] ) .",
    "the anomalous he - like @xmath36-ratios ( table  [ tab : rif ] ) , however , are grossly inconsistent with pure recombination , suggesting an additional component and/or mechanism .",
    "an additional , weak collisionally - ionized plasma component , whose he - like triplets generically exhibit a higher resonance line intensity compared to the intercombination and forbidden lines , could explain these effects",
    ". however , such a component would not only enhance the resonance line , but _ all _ lines in the triplet , thereby overpredicting the intercombination and forbidden line fluxes relative to the rrc .",
    "this interpretation is marginally ruled out by the triplet to rrc   ratio in the rgs  data .",
    "similarly ambiguous @xmath36 ratios were previously observed in the _ chandra _  hetgs  spectrum of the seyfert  2 , markarian  3 .",
    "sako et  al .",
    "( 2000b ) argued against the presence of an additional collisionally - ionized plasma component due to the observed weakness of the fe  l shell emission , which was consistent with recombination in a photoionized plasma @xcite .",
    "instead , sako et  al .",
    "( 2000b ) suggested that the enhanced resonance lines were due to photoexcitation ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : grotrian ] for a schematic of the relevant atomic processes ) .",
    "this argument is sensitive to the fe abundance ; however , sako et  al .",
    "( 2000b ) noted that a rather unlikely order - of - magnitude underabundance of fe would be necessary to be consistent with the presence of additional hot collisionally - ionized plasma .    for ngc  1068",
    ", we propose a cleaner test based solely on each particular ionic line series .",
    "the key to robustly distinguishing between photoexcitation and additional collisionally - ionized plasma components lies in the higher - order series line strengths .",
    "we illustrate this new method in fig .",
    "[ fig : pipecie ] . starting with a pure recombination spectrum ,",
    "we add in photoexcitation ( self - consistently , as presented below in  [ sec : novel ] ) or a separate collisionally - ionized plasma component .",
    "the addition of photoexcitation enhances all resonance transitions , whereas the addition of collisionally - ionized plasma primarily enhances only the triplet lines ( with more weight on the resonance line of the triplet ) .",
    "the ratios of higher - order - series lines to ly@xmath21 for , , and shown in table  [ tab : hratios ] are significantly higher than those expected for collisional ionization equilibrium ( cie ) , though they are not entirely consistent with pure recombination ( rec ) either .",
    "photoexcitation boosts all lines in this series including ly@xmath21 , but its effect is dependent on the column density and velocity distribution , so it must be modeled carefully .",
    "however , the forbidden line in he - like ions is unaffected by photoexcitation , allowing for a measure of the significance of photoexcitation of higher - order - series transitions with respect to the forbidden line , which is fed through recombination after photoionization .",
    "comparison of the ratios of these higher - order - series lines to the forbidden line ( table  [ tab : heratios ] ) with similar ratios for plasma in collisional equilibrium is not as useful due to the significant temperature sensitivity of @xmath34 .",
    "however , ratios for plasma in collisional equilibrium are generally comparable to or lower than ratios for pure recombination ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pipecie ] ) .",
    "therefore , the excess strength of the higher - order lines , especially the he@xmath37 and he@xmath38 , can only be explained by photoexcitation .",
    "we now show that the relative amount of photoionization versus photoexcitation inferred from the soft - x - ray spectrum of ngc  1068  provides detailed information about the geometry of absorbing / reemitting material around the central , power - law - continuum source .    in the unified model of active galaxies , the observable properties of a particular agn",
    "depend primarily on orientation .",
    "the soft - x - ray warm absorber observed in seyfert  1 galaxies , therefore , should show itself in reemission for the roughly perpendicular line of sight to seyfert  2 galaxies ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : cone ] ) . for the seyfert  1 view , the relative amount of edge absorption versus line absorption depends greatly on the column density through the material .",
    "thus , the seyfert  2 spectrum should similarly be sensitive to the radial column density , since each photoionization is balanced by recombination / radiative cascade , and each photoexcitation is similarly balanced by radiative decay .",
    "therefore , the shape of the reemitted seyfert  2 ionic line series can be used to infer the radial ( or seyfert-1-observed ) ionic column densities through the warm absorber .    for low radial ionic column density , @xmath39 ,",
    "all lines and photoelectric edges remain unsaturated . for a h - like or he - like ion , the summed oscillator strength for transitions to discrete levels",
    "is roughly comparable to the integrated oscillator strength for transitions to the continuum ( e.g. , bethe & salpeter 1977 ) , implying roughly similar amounts of radiative decay following photoexcitation and recombination / radiative cascade following photoionization ( modulated by the shape of the continuum at the relevant photoexcitation / photoionization energies ) .    for higher @xmath39 ,",
    "the low - lying , high - oscillator - strength transitions are the first to saturate , leading to a `` tilting '' of the photoexcitation contribution to the seyfert  2 spectrum to lower - oscillator - strength , higher - order - series transitions .",
    "this can simply be thought of as the standard `` curve of growth , '' except now observed indirectly through reemission . due to this gradual line saturation and the fact that the edge always saturates last , it is evident that an increase in @xmath39 implies an increase in the overall relative importance of photoionization compared to photoexcitation .    at very high @xmath39",
    ", all discrete transitions are fully saturated and the reemitted spectrum is that of pure recombination following photoionization . in the following discussions ,",
    "these qualitative arguments are made more explicit .",
    "the dependence of our model ionic spectra on radial ionic column density , @xmath39 , is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : opticaldepth ] . here",
    "we show the effect of varying @xmath39 for he - like .",
    "the seyfert  1 and seyfert  2 views are shown in the top three panels on the left and the right of fig .",
    "[ fig : opticaldepth ] , respectively , for different radial ionic column densities .",
    "the total edge absorptions ( photoionizations ) and line absorptions ( photoexcitations ) in the seyfert  1 view yield the expected amounts of recombination / radiative cascade following photoionization and radiative decay following photoexcitation in the seyfert  2 view .",
    "note the relative strength of the lines to the rrc  and the effect of saturation on the high - oscillator - strength , lower - order - series transitions .",
    "in particular , note the strong variation in the relative strength of the resonance line in the he - like triplet as a function of optical depth , illustrating that the triplet , by itself , is a poor diagnostic for determining whether or not hotter , collision - driven plasma ( which would show a strong resonance line ) is present ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : pipecie ] ) .",
    "the radial velocity width specified by @xmath40 is a model parameter .",
    "there is little _ a priori _ reason to believe that @xmath40 should be identical to the _ observed _ velocity width of the lines , @xmath41 , viewed perpendicular to the cone ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : cone ] ) . for this reason ,",
    "we keep @xmath40 a free parameter .",
    "the effect of varying @xmath40 is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigmav ] .",
    "increasing @xmath40 by a certain factor leads to a roughly similar increase ( depending on the line saturation or position on the `` curve of growth '' ) in all photoexcited lines .",
    "this is in contrast to variations in @xmath39 , which primarily lead to a `` tilting '' of the photoexcitation contribution , since , one - by - one , each line , in descending order of oscillator strength , is eventually saturated .",
    "the velocity width we invoke here may be due to a turbulent velocity in the plasma or simply due to different bulk velocities of multiple absorption systems .",
    "we have constructed a self - consistent model of an irradiated cone of plasma for application to the ngc  1068  soft - x - ray spectrum .",
    "this model applies to all significant h - like and he - like ions , employing atomic data obtained from the flexible atomic code ( fac ) @xcite .",
    "( a detailed study of the more complicated fe  l - shell transitions is left for the future . ) to simplify fitting , we have incorporated our model into xspec  @xcite as the local model _ photo _ @xcite .    in our model , we allow for individual line absorption , but assume that photoelectric absorption is negligible . with this assumption",
    ", we can simplify the calculations by irradiating each ionic column density separately with an initially unabsorbed power law ( discrete line absorption due to all other ions can safely be neglected , since it removes flux from only a small portion of the total spectrum ) . alternatively , using the method employed by our model , we can irradiate all ionic column densities together , assuming all ions have the same radial distribution .",
    "we have checked that both methods produce the same reprocessed spectrum as long as all photoelectric edges have low optical depths .",

    ". robust lower and upper limits to @xmath101 of 10  km  s@xmath9 and 500  km  s@xmath9 are set by thermal broadening ( @xmath104  ev ) and the observed line broadening , respectively .",

    "this may suggest that the radial column density is larger by roughly a factor of a few than the transverse column density , which would be consistent with a narrow cone geometry .",
    "the electron temperatures we measure directly from the rrc  for recombination onto specific ions can be compared with results from self - consistent simulations of photoionized plasma , where photoelectric heating is balanced by line cooling in the plasma .",

    "[ fig : ksi ] , we plot the thermal equilibrium curve for the same optically thin plasma ( assuming solar abundances ) along which heating equals cooling .",
    "the plasma is thermally unstable along segments of the equilibrium curve which have negative slope , since upward deviations from the curve in this region heat the plasma until it reaches the higher stable branch and downward deviations cool the plasma until it reaches the lower stable branch . comparing both figs .",
    "[ fig : ksi ] and [ fig : ksi ] , we see that several ions present in the spectrum have maximal ionic abundances in this thermally unstable region .",
    "this putative thermal instability , therefore , appears problematic for ions in the observed range of ionization parameter , @xmath109 .",
    "we note that thermal instability can be removed if additional heating / cooling mechanisms are at work in the plasma in addition to those associated with photoelectric heating and line cooling .",
    "thermal instability is also sensitive to metal abundance ( hess , kahn , & paerels 1997 ) , with low metal abundances effectively removing the instability .",
    "the existence of thermal instability in astrophysical photoionized plasmas is presently an open question .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : fractional ] , we present the fractional ionic abundances relative to h and assuming solar abundances for the elements observed in the rgs  spectrum of ngc  1068 .",
    "no single ionization parameter is capable of explaining the column densities obtained in table  [ tab : finalfit ] , which shows similar column densities in h - like and he - like ions for each elemental species .",
    "the data instead require a broad , flat distribution in ionization parameter of the plasma over the range @xmath1103 .",
    "this distribution in @xmath3 could be due to spatial stratification of ionization zones in a single - density cone @xcite or a broad density distribution at each radius .",
    "kraemer and crenshaw ( 2000b ) find that the extended optical / uv  absorber is powered by photoionization due to an inferred hidden source of continuum , as we similarly argue for the soft - x - ray emission .",
    "these findings , coupled with the remarkable overlap of the soft - x - ray image of the cone with optical observations of emission regions ( young et  al .",
    "2001 ) , favor an intrinsic density distribution ( over at least three orders of magnitude ) at each radius .",
    "for such a model , a perfectly flat distribution in @xmath111 would give a distribution in densities at each radius of @xmath112 . an intrinsic density distribution in agn",
    "ionization cones has been proposed in the past to explain the optical and uv  spectra of generic seyfert  2 galaxies ( e.g. , komossa & schulz 1997 ) . in x - ray",
    "emitting plasmas , such a density distribution may naturally arise in outflows due to thermal instabilities ( krolik & kriss 2001 ) , which may counter the usual perception of such instabilities on the presence of specific ions in the unstable region ( see  [ sec : instability ] ) .",
    "the upper limits obtained in  [ sec : warmabsorber ] for the radial filling factor do not allow for distinguishing between spatially - stratified ionization zones or an intrinsic density distribution . robust discrimination between these two models will require future observations and analysis .      given the ionization parameter distribution , the inferred ionic column densities can provide estimates of relative elemental abundances .",
    "however , even absent knowledge of the exact distribution , some tentative conclusions can be drawn due to the overlap in ionization parameter of specific charge states of different ions .",
    "the necessity of a broad , rather flat range of ionization parameter allows for comparison of overlapping charge states of different elements , such as h - like c and he - like o ( see fig .  [ fig : fractional ] ) .",
    "overall , we find that all of the well - measured ionic column densities yield relative elemental abundances which are consistent with solar ( grevesse et  al . 1996 ; allende prieto et  al .",
    "2001 ) , excluding n , which is overabundant by approximately a factor of three .",
    "the column densities of mg and si also seem high in the context of a flat ionization parameter distribution .",
    "but , due to low counts and blending , their column densities are not well determined , making difficult any robust conclusions concerning their relative abundance .",
    "furthermore , we note that the abnormally high fe / o abundance invoked for previous _ asca _  spectra of ngc  1068  by netzer & turner ( 1997 ) is not observed .",
    "in fact , the and emission lines are the strongest in the spectrum , especially when compared to fe l - shell transitions , which are considerably weaker ( but not necessarily inconsistent with solar - abundance photoionized plasma ) .",
    "fe l - shell line emission in generic photoionized plasma , as well as in ngc  1068 , is currently under investigation .",
