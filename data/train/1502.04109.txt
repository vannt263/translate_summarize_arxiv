    "five centuries ago , leonardo da vinci first marveled at the intricate flow patterns arising in a turbulent cascade of water .",
    "but the first quantitative understanding of the physics of hydrodynamic turbulence had to wait until the seminal work by kolmogorov in the 1940s , and humankind s grasp of hydrodynamic turbulence remains yet incomplete . to advance the frontiers of our knowledge beyond the limits of our terrestrial environment , we strive to understand the impact of turbulence on the astrophysical plasmas that comprise most of the visible matter in the universe .    on the face of it",
    ", it would appear that unraveling the details of plasma turbulence , with electromagnetic forces in addition to the gas pressure force that occurs    in hydrodynamics , would be a much more challenging task than the study of turbulence in water and air .",
    "but the study of plasma turbulence is facilitated by one fundamental difference between a hydrodynamic fluid and a plasma : in a magnetized plasma , magnetic tension provides a restoring force that is absent in hydrodynamics .",
    "the importance of this distinction can not be overstated , because magnetic tension supports the propagation of a fundamental wave mode , the alfvn wave , that plays a governing role in plasma turbulence .",
    "the linear alfvnic response , due to magnetic tension , of the plasma to applied perturbations provides a critical theoretical foothold in the quest to understand the dynamics and energetics of plasma turbulence .",
    "specifically , in the limit of weak nonlinearity , it is possible to derive rigorous asymptotic analytical solutions of the nonlinear dynamics .",
    "it is precisely this nonlinear physics that underlies the turbulent cascade of energy from large to small scales , one of the most important impacts of turbulence on astrophysical environments . in practice ,",
    "such rigorous solutions in the limit of weak nonlinearity can often be pushed to the limits of strong turbulence while remaining at least qualitatively correct , even though such solutions are formally well beyond their regime of applicability .",
    "lacking this foothold of linear physics , hydrodynamics ruthlessly forces the physicist to resort almost immediately to a statistical approach to describe the turbulent evolution , with the typical focus on the power spectra , the development of intermittency , and the scaling of higher - order statistics . in the weakly collisional solar wind ,",
    "researchers at the forefront strive to illuminate the physics of the nonlinear energy transfer to small scales , the kinetic mechanisms of dissipation of the turbulent fluctuations , and the resulting plasma heating . to illuminate these mechanisms",
    ", i contend that we must step beyond the usual statistical treatments , adopting instead a dynamical approach , to determine definitively the dominant physical processes at play in the evolution of plasma turbulence . only with a dynamical understanding of both the nonlinear wave - wave interactions responsible for the turbulent cascade and the collisionless wave - particle interactions responsible for the dissipation",
    "will it be possible to construct a predictive theory of plasma turbulence and its effect on energy transport and plasma heating .",
    "a significant fraction of the heliospheric turbulence research community appears to believe , likely based on the analogy with hydrodynamics , that linear physics properties are not relevant to strong plasma turbulence . on the contrary ,",
    "there are numerous counterexamples in which linear physics properties have been shown to be relevant to strong plasma turbulence @xcite and in some cases significant insights into the nature of magnetized plasma turbulence have been achieved by the exploitation of intuition from the linear physics properties @xcite .",
    "one particularly significant example is that the qualitative picture of the nonlinear energy transfer in the weak turbulence limit persists in the limit of strong turbulence @xcite .",
    "in fact , there is a long history of linear wave properties being explicitly or implicitly used to analyze spacecraft measurements and numerical simulations of plasma turbulence @xcite .",
    "in fact , as will be explained below , the linear and nonlinear dynamics of alfvn waves are responsible , at a very fundamental level , for some of the key qualitative features of plasma turbulence that distinguish it from hydrodynamic turbulence , including the anisotropic cascade of energy and the development of current sheets at small scales . in the opinion of this author , to attempt a purely statistical investigation of plasma turbulence , analogous to the common approach in hydrodynamic turbulence , without exploiting the plasma physics of the turbulent fluctuations is bound to meet with moderate success at best .",
    "the current frontier of research on plasma turbulence in the weakly collisional solar wind is framed by three fundamental questions :    1 .   * what is the physical mechanism underlying the nonlinear transfer of energy from large to small scales ? * this question must be answered both for the mhd regime of the inertial range and the kinetic regime of the dissipation range . and the kinetic regime as @xmath0 , although compressible fluctuations in the weakly collisional solar wind require a kinetic treatment , even at the large scales of the inertial range @xcite . here",
    "@xmath1 refers to the component of the wavevector perpendicular to the local mean magnetic field @xmath2 and @xmath3 is the thermal ion larmor radius , where the ion thermal velocity is defined by @xmath4 ( with temperature expressed in units of energy ) and the ion cyclotron frequency is given by @xmath5 . ]",
    "* what are the dominant physical mechanisms responsible for damping the turbulent electromagnetic fluctuations ?",
    "* note that which mechanisms dominate may depend on both the plasma parameters and the characteristics of the turbulence , such as the scale and amplitude of the energy injection .",
    "these mechanisms determine the partitioning of dissipated turbulent energy into heat , or other energization , of the protons , electrons , and minor ions .",
    "* how do coherent structures arise from and/or affect both the nonlinear energy transfer and the dissipation mechanism ? *",
    "the concentration of dissipation in coherent structures , specifically current sheets , is well established by numerical simulations of plasma turbulence and is inferred from spacecraft measurements in the solar wind .",
    "the ultimate goal of the study of space and astrophysical plasma turbulence is to develop a sufficiently detailed understanding of the physics to enable the construction of predictive models of the nonlinear energy transfer , the damping of the turbulent fluctuations , and the resulting heating of the plasma species , for example the heating of the solar corona @xcite .",
    "in addition to establishing a more thorough knowledge of the physics of the heliosphere  our home in the universe  it will provide a crucial foundation for an improved understanding of complex astrophysical phenomena in remote regions of the cosmos .",
    "below i present the first dynamical model of kinetic turbulence in the weakly collisional solar wind plasma that combines self - consistently the physics of alfvn waves with the development of small - scale current sheets . based on this model , i will address each of the questions above , as well as numerous subsidiary issues , as we follow the turbulent cascade of energy from large to small scales in the solar wind .",
    "incompressible mhd is one of the most simple , self - consistent descriptions of turbulent plasma dynamics .",
    "although incompressible mhd lacks much of the rich physical behavior possible in the weakly collisional plasma conditions relevant to the solar wind , i argue here that incompressible mhd systems appear to contain the minimum number of physical ingredients necessary to yield the key qualitative features of plasma turbulence that distinguish it from hydrodynamic turbulence , specifically the anisotropic cascade of energy and dissipation dominantly occurring within current sheet structures .",
    "these key features persist as more physically complete plasma descriptions are adopted , yet do not occur in hydrodynamic turbulence",
    ".    early research on incompressible mhd turbulence in the 1960s @xcite suggested that nonlinear interactions between counterpropagating alfvn waves  or alfvn wave collisions  support the turbulent cascade of energy from large to small scales .",

    "@xmath12 is total pressure ( thermal plus magnetic ) , @xmath13 is mass density , and @xmath14 are the elsasser fields which represent waves that propagate up or down the mean magnetic field .",
    "the @xmath15 term governs the nonlinear interactions between counterpropagating alfvn waves , denoted _ alfvn wave collisions_.    the strength of the nonlinearity in incompressible mhd turbulence may be characterized by the _ nonlinearity parameter _ , @xmath16 , while a state of strong incompressible mhd turbulence is characterized by @xmath17 @xcite .      following significant previous studies on weak incompressible mhd turbulence @xcite , the nonlinear energy transfer in alfvn wave collisions",
    "has recently been solved analytically in the weakly nonlinear limit , @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the key physics is illustrated in fig .",

    "are positive constants , and the components of a particular wavevector are denoted @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 .",
    "the asymptotic solution is ordered by the small parameter @xmath25 . the lowest order nonlinear interaction creates an inherently nonlinear , purely magnetic mode with wavevector @xmath26 ( green triangle ) .",

    "this process is the fundamental mechanism by which turbulence transfers energy from large to small scales @xcite .",
    "this fundamental energy transfer mechanism in the weakly nonlinear limit , derived in the limit of incompressible mhd , has been confirmed numerically with gyrokinetic numerical simulations in the mhd regime @xcite and verified experimentally in the laboratory @xcite , establishing alfvn wave collisions as the fundamental building block of astrophysical plasma turbulence .",
    "this nonlinear mechanism is likely to be the physics leading to a non - zero third - moment of turbulent magnetic field measurements , a statistical measure often used to estimate the turbulent energy cascade rate @xcite .",
    "the validation of the incompressible mhd analytical solution for the nonlinear evolution of alfvn wave collisions with a kinetic numerical simulation has two important implications .",
    "first , the properties of incompressible mhd solution persist even under the weakly collisional plasma conditions relevant to realistic space and astrophysical plasmas .",
    "second , the dynamical behavior of the turbulent cascade in the mhd regime , @xmath40 , in particular the nonlinear energy transfer , is adequately described by the simplified framework of incompressible mhd .",
    "this second point highlights that , even in a kinetic plasma , the nonlinear energy transfer is essentially fluid in nature , and can be modeled as a nonlinear wave - wave interaction . on the other hand , the physical mechanisms responsible for damping of the turbulent fluctuations under weakly collisional plasma conditions , as will be argued below , must be essentially kinetic in nature , dominated by wave - particle interactions .",
    "i also note that the physics of alfvn wave collisions highlights the fact that plasma turbulence is inherently three - dimensional @xcite . the linear term in that",
    "governs the propagation of the alfvn waves along the equilibrium magnetic field and is nonzero only when the parallel wavenumber @xmath41 , requiring the inclusion of the field - parallel dimension .",
    "and the vector nature of the nonlinear term requires variation in both of the directions perpendicular to the magnetic field for the nonlinearity to be nonzero .",
    "the manifestly three - dimensional nature of plasma turbulence not only applies to incompressible mhd plasmas , but persists as a general characteristic of the turbulence for more complex plasmas , such as compressible mhd plasmas or kinetic plasmas @xcite .",
    "the anisotropic nature of the nonlinear energy transfer in alfvnic plasma turbulence has long been recognized in laboratory plasmas @xcite and in the solar wind @xcite , as well as in the results of numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "it is observed that energy is preferentially transferred to small scales perpendicular to the local magnetic field direction , leading to anisotropic , small - scale turbulent fluctuations that are elongated along the local magnetic field , characterized by the wavevector anisotropy @xmath42 .",
    "why is magnetized plasma turbulence anisotropic ?",
    "this question can be answered rather simply , in the context of incompressible mhd , through physical intuition derived from the picture of nonlinear energy transfer presented above .",
    "basically , the anisotropy arises as a direct consequence of two facts : ( i ) only counterpropagating alfvn waves interact nonlinearly , and ( ii ) the nonlinear energy transfer is maximized for interactions between perpendicularly polarized alfvn waves .",
    "consider the nonlinear interaction between two plane alfvn waves with arbitrary wavevectors @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "we adopt the convention that the wave frequency must be non - negative , @xmath45 , so that the propagation direction of the wave along the mean magnetic field is given by the sign of the parallel component of the wavevector . the nonlinear interaction between these two modes",
    "is nonzero only for counterpropagating alfvn waves @xcite , so the parallel components @xmath46 and @xmath47 must be opposite in sign . a mode @xmath48 receiving energy via the nonlinear interaction between these two modes must satisfy @xmath49 , so its parallel component must have @xmath50 and @xmath51 . the nonlinear term in",
    "has the form @xmath52 .",
    "the magnitude of this nonlinear term is maximized when the perpendicular components of the wavevectors of the interacting alfvn waves are orthogonal , @xmath53 , so we expect the nonlinear energy transfer to be dominated by interactions in which the colliding alfvn waves are perpendicularly polarized @xcite .",
    "for this case of orthogonal perpendicular wavevector components , @xmath54 , the resulting magnitude of the perpendicular component of @xmath48 will satisfy @xmath55 and @xmath56 . in summary ,",
    "the parallel wavevector component of alfvnic fluctuations decreases or remains constant due to the fact that only counterpropagating alfvn waves interact nonlinearly , while the perpendicular wavevector component of the fluctuations generally increases due to the dominance of nonlinear interactions between perpendicularly polarized alfvn waves .",
    "thus , the resulting nonlinear energy transfer is expected to be anisotropic , with energy preferentially flowing towards smaller scales in the perpendicular direction than in the parallel direction .",
    "the argument presented above is similar to a previous explanation of anisotropic energy transfer @xcite which relies on the wavevector @xmath49 and frequency @xmath57 matching conditions in the weak turbulence limit for resonant interactions between alfvn waves with wavevectors @xmath43 and @xmath44 . retaining the convention of non - negative frequencies , the linear alfvn wave frequency is given by @xmath58 .",
    "therefore , the parallel component of the wavevector matching condition and the frequency matching condition lead to the equations @xmath59 and @xmath60 . since",
    "only counterpropagating alfvn waves interact nonlinearly , and thus @xmath46 and @xmath47 must be opposite in sign ( or zero ) , these equations have a solution only if either @xmath61 or @xmath62 .",
    "this argument establishes the necessity of modes with @xmath63 in resonant nonlinear interactions in the weak turbulence limit , but elucidates neither the origin nor the nature of such modes . in summary",
    ", the parallel wavenumber does not increase through nonlinear interactions in weak incompressible mhd turbulence , while the perpendicular wavenumber generally does increase , yielding an anisotropic transfer of energy to modes with @xmath42 .",

    "[ sec : cascade ] can be used to illustrate this previous explanation for the anisotropic energy transfer and to clarify the origin and role of the @xmath63 modes .",
    "using the wavevector notation from ",
    "[ sec : cascade ] , where @xmath24 represents the wavevector component parallel to the local mean magnetic field , the nonlinear interaction between counterpropagating plane alfvn waves given by wavevectors @xmath64 and @xmath38 may lead to energy transfer to two other fourier modes @xmath65 and @xmath66 . the detailed analytical solution",
    "@xcite demonstrates that the resonant interactions that lead to the secular transfer of energy to smaller scales are mediated by a nonlinearly generated mode with @xmath32 , so this result singles out @xmath67 as the key mode mediating the nonlinear energy transfer . for this particular problem , the primary counterpropagating alfvn waves @xmath64 and @xmath38 each then interact nonlinearly with this self - consistently generated mode @xmath67 to transfer energy resonantly to alfvn waves with wavevectors @xmath34 and @xmath68 .",
    "it is these two subsequent interactions that correspond directly to the previous explanation @xcite of anisotropic energy transfer in the weak turbulence limit . in the presence of pre - existing energy in @xmath32 modes",
    ", this energy transfer corresponds to a dominant three - wave interaction . in the absence of such pre - existing @xmath32 modes , it is the self - consistently generated @xmath67 mode that mediates the energy transfer . in this case , there is no energy transfer via three - wave interactions , but rather the combined interactions @xmath69 and @xmath70 , together equivalent to a four - wave interaction , constitute the dominant mechanism of nonlinear energy transfer .",
    "note that the mode @xmath67 has no associated velocity fluctuation , @xmath71 , but does include a non - zero perpendicular magnetic field fluctuation , @xmath72 @xcite , so this mode has both @xmath73 and @xmath74 , and therefore interacts with alfvn waves propagating in either direction along the magnetic field . physically , the mode @xmath67 can be interpreted as a shear in the magnetic field that the alfvn waves traveling in either direction attempt to follow .",
    "these arguments demonstrate that , in the weak turbulence limit , @xmath75 , no parallel cascade occurs , yielding a maximally anisotropic energy transfer only to smaller perpendicular scales .",
    "does the physical picture of energy transfer mediated by self - consistently generated @xmath32 modes persist in the strong turbulence limit , @xmath76 ?",
    "let us consider an alfvn wave collision problem equivalent to the weakly nonlinear case presented in ",
    "[ sec : cascade ] , but with the initial alfvn wave amplitudes increased to yield a strongly nonlinear case with @xmath77 .",
    "simulations of alfvn wave collisions in this strong turbulence limit @xcite demonstrate that the energy transfer in perpendicular fourier space flows primarily to modes along the three diagonal lines represented in panel ( a ) of fig .  [ fig : modes_o5 ] . due to the wavevector matching conditions for this particular problem , the parallel wavenumber is a positive constant describing the initial counterpropagating alfvn waves .",
    "] is constant along these diagonal lines , with values @xmath78 , @xmath32 , and @xmath79 , while the perpendicular wavenumber increases with the distance from the origin of the plot .",
    "thus , the energy transfer is anisotropic in this strongly nonlinear case , consistent with previous findings of anisotropic energy transfer in strong plasma turbulence .",
    "of course , in contrast to the weakly nonlinear case where the energy transfer is dominated by interactions involving just the modes @xmath80 , @xmath67 , and @xmath81 , the strongly nonlinear limit involves significant contributions from higher - order terms in the asymptotic expansion .",
    "these terms lead to significant nonlinear energy transfer involving many other three - wave couplings , ultimately leading to a parallel transfer of energy to modes with @xmath82 , but at a rate slower than the cascade of energy to higher perpendicular wavenumber .",
    "the observed channeling of energy along the three diagonal lines in panel ( a ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : modes_o5 ] suggests that @xmath32 modes continue to play a key role in mediating the nonlinear energy transfer in strong turbulence .",
    "it is important to note that , for an alfvn wave collision with @xmath17 , the self - consistently generated @xmath32 modes rise to amplitudes with the same order of magnitude as the primary alfvn waves , so pre - existing energy in @xmath32 modes is unnecessary to yield a strong cascade of turbulent energy .    in summary ,",
    "the anisotropic cascade of energy in incompressible mhd turbulence is a consequence of the two facts that only counterpropagating alfvn waves interact nonlinearly and that the nonlinear term is greatest for interactions between perpendicularly polarized alfvn waves .",
    "note this explanation of the anisotropy in terms of the linear and nonlinear properties of the turbulent fluctuations differs substantially from a statistical argument in this issue @xcite relying on the coupling of third - order to second - order correlations in the turbulence .",
    "it is an open question why the property of anisotropic energy transfer appears to persist under less restrictive plasma conditions than incompressible mhd ( in particular for the dispersive modes at scales below the ion larmor radius ) which allow for copropagating modes to interact nonlinearly .",
    "an analytical solution of the nonlinear energy transfer in the dispersive regime of kinetic alfvn waves may help to answer this open question .      as a relevant aside , it is worthwhile to consider the nature of low - frequency .",

    "the collisional term is subdominant , and thus the physics of solar wind turbulence is controlled by the electromagnetic lorentz force on the particles .",
    "the charge density and current density give rise to the electromagnetic fields through maxwell s equations , and therefore the fields are entirely determined by the two lowest - order moments of the ion and electron distribution functions .",
    "thus , the forces in weakly collisional plasma turbulence are essentially fluid in nature , since they depend on only the low - order moments . for the non - relativistic conditions of solar wind turbulence ,",
    "the plasma fluctuations are quasineutral , with typical charge density fluctuations , @xmath86 , normalized by the total ion charge density , @xmath87 , having an order of magnitude @xmath88 @xcite .",

    "note that the kinetic energy density of a plasma species is given by @xmath90 , and we may define a `` kinetic '' temperature @xmath91 ( expressed in units of energy ) for a monatomic plasma species @xmath84 in three spatial dimensions by @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the bulk fluid velocity of species @xmath84 , given by the first moment of the distribution function .",

    "energy can not be extracted from a thermal distribution without lowering the entropy , so this energy is thermodynamically inaccessible .",
    "but , if the distribution function deviates from a maxwellian , as will generally be the case for a turbulent weakly collisional plasma , then the last term contains not only thermal energy but also non - thermal free energy associated with the deviations from a maxwellian distribution .",

    "it is worthwhile considering the various physical mechanisms that can lead to the transfer of energy among the different terms in .",
    "the low - frequency linear wave response of the kinetic plasma leads to the continual exchange of energy between the electromagnetic energy and bulk kinetic energy ",
    "the magnetic tension in alfvn waves , for example , leads to the periodic transfer of energy between the magnetic energy and the kinetic energy of the bulk plasma motion , an exchange that is purely fluid in nature .",
    "collisionless wave - particle interactions , such as landau damping , lead to the transfer of energy from the electromagnetic fields into non - thermal free energy in the distribution function .",
    "conversely , unstable distribution functions can lead to the transfer of energy from the non - thermal free energy in the velocity distributions to electromagnetic fluctuations via collisionless wave - particle interactions , such as kinetic temperature anisotropy instabilities @xcite .",
    "both of these physical mechanisms of energy transfer by wave - particle interactions are essentially kinetic in nature .",
    "in addition to conserving energy , all of the processes mentioned above also conserve entropy since the collisionless boltzmann equation ( or the vlasov equation ) conserves entropy .",
    "collisions are the final physical mechanism that converts non - thermal free energy in the distribution function to thermal energy , a process that increases the entropy of the plasma , thereby realizing irreversible thermodynamic heating of the plasma .",
    "collisions , of course , do not transfer energy between terms in , but merely convert non - thermal to thermal energy within the last term in the equation .    based on these considerations , here i suggest a practical definition for what constitutes the turbulence in a kinetic plasma .",

    "the nonlinear interactions underlying the turbulent cascade of energy from large to small scales are mediated by the electromagnetic fields , and since these fields depend only on the first moments of the ion and electron distribution functions , the nonlinear dynamics of the turbulence is therefore fluid in nature .",
    "particle motions contributing to the third term , containing both non - thermal and thermal energy in the distribution function , are not part of the turbulence by this definition .",
    "collisionless wave - particle interactions transfer energy from the turbulent electromagnetic and bulk velocity fluctuations ( the first two terms in ) into non - thermal free energy in the plasma species distribution functions ( the third term ) .",

    "collisions then act to smooth out the non - thermal fluctuations in the velocity distribution , irreversibly converting the non - thermal free energy in the distribution function to thermal energy .",
    "thus , the dissipation of turbulence in a weakly collisional plasma is necessarily a two - step process , whereby first entropy - conserving collisionless wave - particle interactions damp the turbulent electromagnetic and bulk velocity fluctuations , and then entropy - increasing collisions thermalize the energy removed from the turbulent fluctuations .",
    "other forms of particle energization , such as the development of beams or high - energy tails in the velocity distribution , may also occur via collisionless wave - particle interactions , and correspond to the transfer of energy from the electromagnetic fields to non - thermal free energy in the distribution functions , a transfer that is also essentially kinetic in nature .",
    "the inherently anisotropic nature of plasma turbulence , with turbulent fluctuations that satisfy @xmath42 , also leads to the prediction that the nonlinearity associated with alfvn wave collisions dominates over other potential nonlinear mechanisms driven by gradients parallel to the magnetic field , in particular parametric instabilities , such as the decay,@xcite modulational,@xcite and beat@xcite instabilities .",
    "for example , even for oblique alfvn wave modes , numerical studies using both mhd @xcite and kinetic ion / fluid electron hybrid @xcite simulations find parametric instability growth rates that are proportional to @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is the angle between the wavevector and the magnetic field .",
    "the root of this property is that the nonlinearity associated with parametric instabilities is proportional to @xmath98 , whereas the nonlinearity associated with alfvn wave collisions is proportional to @xmath99 .",
    "therefore , the relative magnitude of the effect of parametric instabilities to that of alfvn wave collisions is @xmath100 , so parametric instabilities are expected to be subdominant in anisotropic plasma turbulence @xcite .",

    "since the linear terms are equal in magnitude to the nonlinear terms in critically balanced strong turbulence , the linear plasma physics continues to have an important impact on the dynamics in magnetized plasma turbulence , unlike hydrodynamic turbulence .",
    "an important consequence of this fact is that the turbulent fluctuations may exhibit some linear mode properties , properties which may be exploited to illuminate the nature of plasma turbulence @xcite .",
    "the relevance of linear physics to plasma turbulence is responsible for the numerical finding that the picture of energy transfer to smaller scales presented in  [ sec : cascade ] , derived rigorously in the weakly nonlinear limit @xcite , remains qualitatively correct , even in the limit of strong , critically balanced turbulence , well beyond the formal regime of applicability of the solution @xcite .",

    ", it is easy to understand why reduced models , such as incompressible mhd and reduced mhd , are valuable tools in the study of plasma turbulence .",
    "the simplicity of such reduced models is that they satisfy a number of exact constraints that facilitate the development of an intuitive understanding of the turbulent dynamics .",
    "although these constraints do not strictly hold under more general plasma conditions , often the behavior observed in the simplified system persists , at least to lowest order , in the more general system .",
    "for example , we employ here our understanding of the nonlinear energy transfer between counterpropagating alfvn waves in incompressible mhd to argue that the anisotropic cascade of energy ubiquitously observed in magnetized plasma turbulence is due to the facts that only counterpropagating alfvn waves interact nonlinearly and that the nonlinear term is greatest for interactions between perpendicularly polarized alfvn waves .",
    "although the constraint that only counterpropagating waves interact ceases to hold strictly when compressibility or kinetic effects ( dispersion due to finite larmor radius effects ) are introduced , the anisotropy of the turbulent cascade persists .",
    "the separation of essentially fluid versus essentially kinetic properties of kinetic plasma turbulence enables further simplifications .",
    "although non - maxwellian particle velocity distributions are widely found in the solar wind and in kinetic numerical simulations , the departures from a maxwellian equilibrium ( bi - maxwellian , kappa , or multi - component with core / halo structure ) do not affect the electromagnetic dynamics of the turbulence very much @xcite . since the nonlinear energy transfer and development of current sheets in plasma turbulence are due to wave - wave interactions , they depend only on the first moments of the distribution functions , and are therefore not very sensitive to the particular form of the distribution functions . the physical mechanisms of dissipation and the injection of energy by kinetic instabilities , on the other hand , which depend on growth or damping rates due to collisionless wave - particle interactions , may depend sensitively on the form of the distribution functions .",
    "for example , a kappa distribution , having a much larger population of particles at high energy with respect to a maxwellian , may experience significantly enhanced rates of collisionless damping of waves that are resonant with these high energy particles .",
    "this viewpoint proposed here strongly contradicts the recent suggestion from a kinetic study of plasma turbulence @xcite that `` it seems increasingly clear that significant kinetic effects including heating have strong association with coherent structures and with the turbulent cascade that produces intermittency . ''    looking toward the future , to identify definitively the kinetic mechanism responsible for the dissipation of solar wind turbulence , it is likely that it will be necessary to step beyond the analysis of the turbulent electromagnetic fields alone , delving much more deeply into the dynamic effect of turbulent fluctuations and their dissipation on the particle velocity distributions .",
    "these velocity distributions are already measured directly by instruments on existing spacecraft missions . and",
    ", on upcoming missions , such as _ mms _ and _ solar probe plus _ , with a combination of higher cadence and better resolution than previous missions , the distribution function data represent an important untapped potential source for discovery science .",
    "a new frontier will be the exploration of the dynamics of the perturbations to the distribution functions associated with the turbulent fluctuations and their kinetic dissipation , where kinetic plasma turbulence simulations will be essential to exploit fully the potential of _ mms _ and _ solar probe plus_.",
