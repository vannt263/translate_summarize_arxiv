    ", we calculate the electron and positron spectrum and the positron fraction from lkp annihilation in the galactic halo including the effects of propagation , and compare the results with recent measurements .",
    "we found the energy dependence of the positron fraction is well explained by the mixture of `` line '' , which consists of electron  positron pairs directly produced by annihilation , and `` continuum '' component , which consists of secondarily produced electrons and positrons .",
    "also the total electron plus positron spectrum can be explained by taking account of the lkp contribution assuming appropriate values for the boost factor describing concentration of dark matter in the galactic halo .",
    "then we discuss the constraints on the boost factor .",
    "in ued assuming only one extra dimension , the extra dimension is compactified with radius @xmath1 , and the lkp mass , which we denote as @xmath2 , is inversely proportional to @xmath1 .",
    "the relevant mass for the lkp ranges from a few 100  gev to 1000  gev  @xcite , if we assume the lkp contributes significantly to cold dark matter .",
    "more recently , progress in estimating the relic density indicate it could be as heavy as 1.5 tev  @xcite .",
    "experimentally , recent lhc results indicate the lkp mass lighter than 950 gev is disfavored  @xcite . here , we vary the lkp mass from 300 gev to 1500 gev , and we analyze the electron plus positron spectrum and the positron fraction to be observed at earth from lkp annihilation .    when lkp pairs annihilate , there are some modes which produce electrons and positrons as final products , and we categorize them into two components .",
    "one of them is a `` line '' component , which consists of electron  positron pairs directly produced by annihilation , and gives rise to edge structure near the lkp mass after propagating in the galactic halo to earth .",

    "the branching ratios are given as follows : 20% for charged leptons , 11% for up  type quarks , 0.7% for down  type quarks , 1% for charged gauge bosons , and 0.5% for neutral gauge bosons , respectively",

    "we will show later that we can fit it well by considering both the line and the continuum components assuming an appropriate boost factor @xmath12 .",
    "charged particles , such as electrons and positrons , produced by lkp annihilation around the center of the galaxy change their direction randomly by the irregular component in the galactic magnetic field , and lose their energies by bremsstrahlung in interstellar matter before reaching earth .",

    "this figure indicates the continuum component becomes dominant in lower energies , and it is larger by two orders of magnitude around 10  gev than the line component .",

    "detailed descriptions of these parameter sets are given in refs .",
    "these plots indicate that two halo density models give almost the same spectra , while different halo propagation models affect the spectra especially in the lower energy region . also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : e3fluxfigure ] indicated by `` ms '' is our calculation using the green function approach based on calucation by moskalenko and strong  @xcite ( corresponding to the solid line in fig .",

    "thus , we hope on  going ( calet  @xcite and dampe  @xcite ) and near  future missions with better sensitivity will clarify the existence ( or non  existence ) of the lkp dark matter .",
    "we investigated the cosmic electron and positron spectra from lkp annihilation taking account of propagation effects in the galaxy .",
    "we paid particular attention to the calculation of the `` continuum '' emission , which is a secondary product of lkp annihilation , in addition to the `` line '' component directly produced by annihilation .",
    "the result shown in fig .  [ fig : line35 ] indicates the `` continuum '' component dominates over the `` line '' component in the low energy region after propagation in the galactic halo to earth , and changes the shape of the positron fraction , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : posifrafigure ] .",
    "we also consider the spectra for different halo density and propagation models .",

    "the results of our calculation imply that while the addition of the lkp component gives good fits to the total electron plus positron spectrum and the positron fraction with appropriate boost factors estimated for each case , but these two boost factors are not consistent each other , if we only take account of the ams02 observation .",
    "however , considering the rather large experimental uncertainties we should not conclude that whether lkp can be a good candidate of cold dark matter now .",
