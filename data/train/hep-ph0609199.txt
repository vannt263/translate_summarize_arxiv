    "axions are the pseudoscalar particles predicted by the peccei and quinn ( pq ) mechanism  @xcite , a quite elegant attempt to explain the smallness of the cp - violation induced by the qcd lagrangian ( the so - called strong cp problem ; for a review see , e.g. , ref .",
    "they emerge as pseudo - goldstone boson modes associated with the global axial pq - symmetry @xmath0 , spontaneously broken at the pq - scale @xmath1 .",
    "this last is also known as the pq- or axion - constant , and characterizes all the axion phenomenology .",
    "more specifically the axion mass is given by the relation  @xcite @xmath2 ( here qcd means that this is induced by interaction with gluons ) while its interactions with fermions are measured by @xmath3 , where @xmath4 represents the fermion mass ( e.g.@xmath5 for electrons , nucleons , etc . ) .",
    "in addition , though chargeless , axions interact with photons through the electromagnetic anomaly : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the electromagnetic field , @xmath8 its dual , and @xmath9 . here , @xmath10 is the electromagnetic fine structure constant and @xmath11 an order one , model dependent constant .",
    "presently , the pq - constant s allowed range is rather narrow  @xcite : terrestrial experiments together with astrophysical and cosmological considerations have in fact excluded all the values of @xmath1 up to @xmath12,gev can be also permitted ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) . ] and above @xmath13 .",
    "because of the axion - photon interaction term ( [ agamma ] ) , the phenomenology of axions can be influenced by the presence of an external electromagnetic field . probably , the most discussed result of this well studied interaction is the axion - photon conversion in an external magnetic field ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , which presently seems the best way to detect axions by terrestrial experiments  @xcite .",
    "another interesting consequence of interaction ( [ agamma ] ) was discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite where it was shown that axions in a strong magnetic field undergo a finite mass shift .",
    "however , in that computation of the mass shift the temperature effects were not taken into account .",
    "this makes the result in ref .",
    "@xcite , though correct , not directly applicable to the axion phenomenology .",
    "in fact , since the axion - photon coupling is very small , the induced mass can be relevant for the axion phenomenology only in the case of very intense magnetic fields , which normally exist only at high temperatures . in this paper",
    ", we reconsider this effect accounting also for the thermal contribution . as we will show , the result given in ref .",
    "@xcite is a very good approximation only for temperatures well below the electron mass @xmath14 . for higher temperatures and sufficiently intense magnetic fields the thermal corrections are relevant .",
    "interestingly , the resulting mass shift induced by the magnetic field is independent of the gluon dynamics and , therefore , does not vanish if the ( qcd induced ) axion mass ( [ m0 ] ) is set to zero .",
    "in other words , the external electromagnetic field itself is responsible for the breaking of the pq - symmetry , playing a role similar to the gluon fields .",
    "we will discuss this point in section 2 of this paper .",
    "we will show that the magnetic contribution is indeed due to a topological effect ( just as for gluons ) which is expected when the axion dynamics take place in an external magnetic field . ultimately , we will associate this effect with the generation of magnetic helicity , whose important role in axion cosmology has already been pointed out ( see ref .",
    "this property makes the magnetic mass shift a true mass term .",
    "therefore , the terminology `` mass shift '' is perhaps inappropriate . in the following",
    ", we will refer to this contribution as the _ magnetic induced axion mass _ @xmath15 .",
    "it contributes to the total axion mass as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is given in ( [ m0 ] ) .    because of this property",
    ", our result applies not only to axions but to any pseudoscalar particle which interacts with photons as in eq .",
    "( [ agamma ] ) , independent of its interaction with gluons .",
    "this is the case with arions  @xcite , ( almost ) massless pseudoscalar particles which do not interact with gluons at all . ) .",
    "the phenomenology of arions in an external magnetic field has been reconsidered recently as a tentative to analyze the problem of supernova dimming in terms of photon - arion oscillations  @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) . ] on the other hand , concerning the axion phenomenology , we expect the contribution @xmath15 to be especially relevant at temperatures above @xmath18 , where the gluon contribution to the axion mass is strongly suppressed  @xcite , or in regions of space and time where a very strong magnetic field is present .",
    "a more detailed analysis of the phenomenological implications of the magnetic induced axion mass is in progress .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  2 we comment on the origin of the magnetic induced mass term .",
    "we then compute the magnetic induced axion mass in section  3 , discussing the zero temperature limit as well as the finite temperature result . finally , in section  4",
    "we summarize and give our conclusions .",
    "in this section we want to discuss some features about the origin of the axion mass generation due to the external magnetic field .",
    "this discussion is semi - qualitative and based only on symmetry considerations .",
    "the actual computation of the induced electromagnetic mass term is devoted to the next section .",
    "however , here it will be shown the relevance of the magnetic helicity for axion dynamics ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    in the pq - mechanism",
    "the axion is defined as the phase of a field ( or , more generally , a linear combination of the phases of different fields ) .",
    "the lagrangian is constructed so that it is invariant under the pq - symmetry @xmath0 . at pure classical level",
    "the pq - symmetry is exact and can be read as the invariance of the effective action @xmath19 $ ] [ see eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) ] for a constant shift of the axion field @xmath20 ( @xmath21 , with @xmath22 a constant ) .",
    "this symmetry requires the axion interactions to be of the form @xmath23 ( where @xmath24 is a conserved current ) , and prevents the generation of the mass term @xmath25 . if quantum mechanical effects are taken into account , it results @xmath26 , and the interaction terms with the gluons @xmath27 and the electromagnetic field @xmath28 emerge .",
    "both @xmath29 and @xmath30 are total derivatives .",
    "however , because of the non - trivial topology of the gluon fields , the first one is responsible for the axion mass term .    following shifman , vainshtein , and zakharov  @xcite we can state the problem better defining the quantum effective action for the axion field , obtained by integrating away all the fields but the axion : @xmath31 } \\ : = \\int \\ ! d \\phi \\ : e^{-s[a(x ) , \\phi ] } \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath32 is a collective name for the gluon , photon and fermion fields .",
    "since the derivative terms like @xmath33 are left invariant for @xmath34 , it follows that : @xmath35 } \\ : = \\int \\ !",
    "d \\phi \\ : e^{-s[a(x ) , \\phi ] \\ ; + \\ ; c g \\ ! \\int \\ ! d^4x \\ ,",
    "g \\widetilde g \\ ; + \\ ; c g_{a\\gamma } \\ ! \\int \\ !",
    "d^4x \\ , f \\widetilde f}\\ ] ] ( @xmath36 is the coupling with gluons ) .",
    "if we neglect the external magnetic field we can also neglect the term @xmath37 since we know that the topology of the electromagnetic field is trivial .",
    "however , the @xmath38 term can not be neglected and is therefore responsible for the breaking of the pq - symmetry , @xmath39 { \\rightarrow}s_{\\rm eff}[a(x)+c]$ ] , and the origin of the axion mass .",
    "let us now suppose that an external magnetic field is present in addition to the radiation one , and reconsider the @xmath37 term .",
    "we use the relation @xmath40 , where @xmath41 and @xmath42 is the total electromagnetic field , which includes the external field . neglecting the contribution of @xmath43 at the surface of the spatial integration volume @xmath44 , which implies @xmath45 , we get @xmath46 where @xmath47 is known as magnetic helicity or abelian chern - simons term ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "the conclusion is therefore that the term @xmath48 can not _ a priori _ be neglected if the helicity of the system is not conserved .",
    "interestingly , it was shown a few years ago @xcite that the dynamics of the axion field ( indeed of any pseudo - scalar field ) in an external , uniform magnetic field _ necessarily _ induces a change of the magnetic helicity .",
    "therefore , the quantity @xmath49 is not constant and , consequently , @xmath50 .",
    "the non - vanishing of this term implies the non - invariance of the classical action for a constant shift of the axion field , @xmath51 - s[a(x ) ] = c \\ , g_{a\\gamma } \\ , \\int d^4x \\ , f \\widetilde f \\propto \\delta h_b \\neq 0 $ ] .",
    "this translates in a mass term for the axion field , if also the quantum effective action is non - invariant @xmath52 \\neq s_{\\rm eff}[a(x)]$ ] .",
    "this is the case if all the charged fermions are massive . on the other hand ,",
    "if at least one charged fermion @xmath53 ( with electric charge @xmath54 ) is massless , we could redefine the fermion field as @xmath55 with @xmath56 constant .",
    "this would introduce a change in the measure @xmath57 ( @xmath58 is a constant proportional to @xmath56 ) and no changes in the fermion mass matrix .",
    "therefore , it would always be possible to choose @xmath56 so that @xmath59 . in other words , if one charged fermion is massless it would be possible to reabsorb @xmath48 by an unphysical chiral rotation of that fermion , and then the axion would not get a mass ( this is analogous to what happens to the standard qcd - induced mass if a quark is massless ) .",
    "in this section we compute the effective , magnetic - induced , axion mass . technically , the problem consists in the computation of the vacuum polarization effects produced by the external ( classical ) electromagnetic field .",
    "diagrammatically we consider the temperature dependent vacuum polarization tensor @xmath60 with one loop quantum corrections and with an arbitrary number of interactions with the external field .    for what concerns our conventions we use natural units with @xmath61 and the lorentz - heaviside convention so that @xmath62 .",
    "the metric tensor is chosen as @xmath63 and we adopt the often used notation @xmath64 for the axion momentum @xmath65 . in addition , we assume the external magnetic field @xmath66 , with intensity @xmath67 , to be directed along @xmath68 , @xmath69 .",
    "the total electromagnetic tensor is @xmath70 , with @xmath71 accounting for the quantum electromagnetic field @xmath72 , and @xmath73 for the classical external one .    in order to compute the magnetic induced axion mass we need to consider the exact axion propagator in the external field , @xmath74 , which is related to the @xmath75 transition amplitude in the external field , @xmath76 , by the equation @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the free axion propagator .",
    "the above equation is shown diagrammatically in fig .  1 .",
    "its formal solution is @xmath79 .",
    "the magnetic axion mass can be calculated in the standard way taking the limit @xmath80 and solving the equation @xmath81 .",
    "we are considering here only the interaction of the axion with the photon .",
    "of course , also the axion - fermions interactions contribute to the axion propagator , but the resulting mass shift is small and disappears in the limit of @xmath82 @xcite .",
    "therefore , in the following , it is assumed that @xmath76 is induced only by photons ( as in fig .  1 ) .",
    "for the exact axion propagator in the external magnetic field @xmath66 .",
    "the sources of this are denoted by crosses .",
    "the dashed lines represent the free axion propagator , while the double dashed ones represent the exact propagator .",
    "the internal waved line stands for the exact photon propagator in the external magnetic field.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    formally , the exact photon propagator @xmath83 is given by the dyson relation @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the free propagator and @xmath86 is the gauge parameter .",
    "the polarization tensor @xmath87 is diagonalizable and its 4 eigenvectors @xmath88 , @xmath89 satisfy the orthonormality @xmath90 and completeness @xmath91 relations @xcite .",
    "because of the transversality condition , @xmath92 , the polarization tensor has a zero eigenmode directed along @xmath93 . to keep the same notation as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we label this as the fourth eigenvector @xmath94 .",
    "so we find @xmath95 where we have indicated with @xmath96 the eigenvalue associated with @xmath88 .",
    "of course , it results @xmath97 . using the orthonormality and completeness relations , it is easy to invert eq .",

    "( [ lambda ] ) . in the limit @xmath80",
    ", it results @xmath104 .",
    "let us define the function @xmath105 such that @xmath106 where we have introduced the factor @xmath107 for convenience .",
    "it results @xmath108 the one loop polarization tensor at finite temperature in an arbitrary magnetic field was computed using the imaginary time formalism in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the imaginary time formalism ,",
    "the ( euclidean ) photon energy is quantized and expressed in terms of the so - called matsubara frequencies : @xmath109 , with @xmath110 integer . for simplicity , we consider only the contribution of the electrons in the fermion loop since this is the leading one as electrons are the lightest charged fermions . in any case , the contribution from the other fermions can be easily included .",
    "the electron energy in the fermion loop is quantized as well , @xmath111 , with @xmath112 integer .",
    "the function @xmath113 is given in ref .",
    "however , for our purpose , the computation of the effective axion mass can be simplified observing that in all the phenomenologically relevant cases the axion mass is always smaller than the fermion masses @xmath114 .",
    "this assumption will be verified _ a posteriori_.",
    "therefore , we can safely consider the limiting value @xmath115 in place of @xmath113 .",

    "in fact , the approach that we have considered is based on the perturbative expansion of fig .  1 , and loses clearly its validity if @xmath76 is arbitrarily large , as in the case of very small electron mass .",
    "indeed , our result is based on an even stronger assumption , which is that the electron mass is always much larger than the axion mass .",

    "the phenomenology of the axion in an external magnetic field has been deeply studied in the last few decades . nowadays",
