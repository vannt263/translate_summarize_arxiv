    "it has been known since the early 1980 s that the hosts of powerful radio galaxies display a tight relation between the @xmath8-band magnitude and redshift ( lilly&longair 1984 ) . in recent years",
    "it has been shown that , at least out to @xmath9 , essentially the same relation is followed by both the less powerful parkes selected regions ( psr ) and 6c radio galaxies ( dunlop _ et al .",
    "_ 1989 ; eales _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ) and by x - ray selected brightest cluster galaxies ( collins & mann 1997 ) . when the @xmath8-band magnitudes of the 3cr galaxies are corrected for the expected effects of passive evolution of their stellar populations they appear to represent rather good standard candles from the present day out to redshift one and greater .",
    "consequently , for many years it was widely accepted that the tightness of the @xmath7 relation for the 3cr radio galaxies could be most naturally explained by the most powerful radio galaxies having a rather well - defined mass , being formed at @xmath10 , and evolving basically passively thereafter .",
    "however , this long - held view has recently been challenged in a series of papers by best , longair & rttgering ( 1997,1998 ) , hereafter blr . between",
    "19941996 blr undertook an extensive study of a virtually complete sample of @xmath11 powerful frii 3cr galaxies in the redshift range @xmath0 ( see fig [ 3csample ] ) .",
    "blr obtained v and i  band hst images , j and k  band ukirt images , and complimentary radio observations at 8.4 ghz with the vla .",
    "blr made use of the four broad  band images they obtained for each of their sources to perform spectral synthesis fitting .",
    "the four broad  band fluxes where fitted by a simple two - component model consisting of an old stellar population and a power - law contribution which represented any possible aligned component .",
    "the stellar population sed s were constructed from the models of bruzual & charlot ( 1993 ) , and assumed a 1-gyr burst of star formation at @xmath12 , with the stars evolving passively from that point onwards to the redshift of the particular 3cr galaxy .",
    "the assumed form of any possible nuclear / aligned emission was a power - law of the form @xmath13 which was used as a compromise between the likely contributions of quasar / starburst / dust scattered emission .",
    "the results of this fitting procedure ( blr 1998 ) show that the broad  band fluxes from these 3cr galaxies are fully consistent with that expected from an old passively evolving stellar population , as required in the traditional interpretation of the @xmath7 relation .    however , the results of the determination of the elliptical galaxy half - light radii @xmath14 performed by blr , combined with a summary of the literature concerning the environments of 3cr galaxies at high and low redshift , led blr to challenge the traditional view of the @xmath7 relation .",
    "using the method of fitting de vaucouleurs templates to azimuthally averaged luminosity profiles , blr produced best ",
    "fit scalelengths for 19 of their 28 objects ( excluding 3c41 and 3c22 which have a large nuclear contribution ( leyshon & eales 1998 ) not dealt with in the blr fitting scheme ) .",
    "the results of this profile fitting revealed a mean scalelength of @xmath15 kpc ( @xmath16 ) . as pointed out by blr",
    "this is significantly larger than the @xmath17 kpc found to be typical of low redshift ellipticals by schombert ( 1987 ) , and only around a factor of two smaller than the average scalelength of low-@xmath18 brightest cluster galaxies ( bcg ) , @xmath19 kpc , found by the same author . combining this result with the @xmath20 relation found by kormendy ( 1977 ) , and confirmed by our hst agn host galaxy study ( dunlop _ et al _ 2000 ) ,",
    "blr argue that even at @xmath2 the hosts of 3cr radio galaxies are highly evolved massive systems , possibly larger by a factor of two than their low-@xmath18 counterparts .    combining the apparent similarity of the @xmath2 3cr galaxies to bcg at the same redshift , with results from the literature concerning the environments of high redshift radio galaxies ( see blr 1998 for a review )",
    ", blr concluded that the passive appearance of the @xmath7 relation is a cosmic conspiracy .",
    "the general picture given by existing studies is that the environments of @xmath21 3cr s are consistent with moderately rich clusters ; galaxy  galaxy cross - correlation function measures are consistent with abell class 0 , or richer ( hill & lilly 1991 ) , while multi - colour imaging shows many companion objects consistent with passively evolving coeval galaxies ( dickinson 1997 ) . as pointed out by blr , the same is not found in existing studies of the environments of low redshift 3cr s ( prestage and peacock 1988 ) , where it has been reported that these objects reside in fairly low - density environments and have smaller characteristic sizes and luminosities than their high - redshift counterparts ( lilly and prestage 1987 ) .    on the basis of",
    "the apparent redshift dependence of 3cr cluster environments blr argued that the 3cr galaxies at @xmath22 and @xmath2 can not be linked by a simple `` closed - box '' passive evolution scheme .",
    "in the picture favoured by blr , the @xmath7 relation can be explained by the two 3cr galaxy samples having different dynamical evolutionary histories , but being observed at the points in their respective histories where they both contain a characteristic mass of stars ; a few times @xmath23 . the @xmath21 3cr galaxies would reach this mass first due to their location in a larger density peak producing strong merging between @xmath24 .",
    "the 3cr galaxies at low-@xmath18 would reach the characteristic mass later through merging within their weaker cluster environment between @xmath2 and the present day , as is expected in many hierarchical galaxy formation models ( kauffmann 1999 ) .",
    "the 3cr galaxies at @xmath2 would obviously also grow through merger activity in this redshift range and would become the radio dormant bcg we see today at low redshift , radio activity having ceased presumably due to the lack of available gas to feed their central black - hole .",
    "although this picture is both consistent and appealing , it is dependent on the acceptance of environmental studies which now date back @xmath25 years , together with the finding that 3cr galaxies at @xmath21 have sizes comparable to bcg at that epoch , something which is not found to be true for low-@xmath18 3cr galaxies .",
    "it was a careful examination of the methods used by blr in determining their scalelengths which provided the original motivation for this paper .",
    "as mentioned above , scalelengths were presented by blr for 19 of their 28 object sample ( the images of the excluded 9 objects having poor signal - to - noise or suffering from extreme aligned emission ) .",
    "however , only 6 of these 19 scalelengths where actually determined from the high resolution hst imaging .",
    "the reason for this is that the one - dimensional profile fitting technique employed was unable to cope with the masking of significant contamination by companion objects or aligned emission .",
    "the majority of the scalelength information presented by blr was in fact derived from the analysis of their @xmath8-band imaging data obtained at ukirt . as reported by blr , this imaging was obtained in @xmath26 seeing conditions with typically 54 minutes of on - source integration which , considering the redshift range of the objects , leaves a relatively small amount of data which has both good signal - to - noise and is free from substantial seeing effects .",
    "the use of an analytical gausian function to represent what has proven to be the extremely complicated ircam3 psf ( mclure _ et al _ 1999b ) casts further doubt on the quoted scalelength values .    experience gained from the comparison of our modelling results of @xmath27 agn host galaxies ( mclure _ et al _ 1999a , mclure _ et al _ 1999b ) with those previously obtained from typically @xmath26 @xmath8-band imaging ( dunlop _ et al .",
    "_ 1993 , taylor _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ) has demonstrated to us that the twin benefits of high resolution and a temporally stable psf tend to combine to revise the best - fitting galaxy scalelength downwards .",
    "the main reason for this systematic trend appears to be that the high spatial resolution provided by hst allows the reliable identification of separate companion objects and their subsequent masking from the modelling process , preventing the inclusion of extra flux from biasing the scalelength determination to higher values .",
    "this effect is obviously only going to be strengthened at redshifts of @xmath28 where the angular separation between companion objects and the target can easily be of the same order as the typical seeing experienced during the blr ukirt observations .",
    "given these considerations it was felt worthwhile to re - examine the publically available hst data to determine whether the use of the full two - dimensional analysis utilised in the @xmath27 quasar host galaxy programme would produce significantly different scalelength figures from those published by blr .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,<,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     if the two samples of radio galaxies can truly be linked by a single population of passively evolving ellipticals it is to be expected that they should follow kormendy relations which are identical except for a simple vertical shift in surface - brightness . after making the appropriate surface - brightness corrections ( section [ korz ] ) and @xmath29-band filter transformation ( section [ abmags ] ) the least - squares fit to the kormendy relations formed by the @xmath27 radio galaxies",
    "are shown in table [ 0.2kor ] .",
    "it can be seen from this that , as for the @xmath30 galaxies , the choice of cosmology makes little difference to the slope of the kormendy relation , although the normalization does change significantly .",
    "it is also apparent that the low-@xmath18 objects appear to follow a substantially flatter relation , with a slope of 2.9 instead of 3.5 , although clearly both values are consistent with the expected slope @xmath31 ( due to the fairly substantial formal error in the fitted slope , which is predominantly a result of the small sample size and lack of dynamic range in radius ) . to facilitate a fair comparison of the high- and low-@xmath18 radio galaxy kormendy relations , the least - squares fitting was repeated with an enforced intermediate slope of 3.20 . if it is indeed the case that these two galaxy populations can be linked by passive evolution alone then the vertical shift required to reconcile the kormendy relations should be in good agreement with both that required to match the absolute magnitudes , and the passive evolution predictions of the stellar synthesis modelling . to explore",
    "what range of vertical magnitude shifts are allowed by the data , we performed the least - squares fitting ( with fixed slope=3.20 ) not only with the best estimate of @xmath32 for each galaxy , but with the scalelengths of the @xmath30 sub - sample shortened and lengthened such that the ks test showed its scalelength distribution to differ from that of the @xmath27 sub - sample at the @xmath33 level .",
    "the results of this process are presented in table [ shifts ] .",
    "a comparison of the figures from table [ shifts ] with those of table [ passive ] shows that in the @xmath34 models considered here it is only possible to reconcile the luminosity evolution predicted by the kormendy relations with that predicted by the spectral modelling and the absolute magnitude distributions , separately . in these cosmologies",
    "it is impossible to force both alternative measures of the amount of luminosity evolution , and the predictions of the spectral modelling , into agreement .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath35 predictions from the kormendy relations in the @xmath36 cosmologies comfortably bracket the offsets given in table [ passive ] , thus leaving both alternative measures of the luminosity evolution in excellent agreement .    in theory , the kormendy relations for the low and high - z sub - samples presented here offer an opportunity to constrain both cosmology and the prevalence of merger activity .",
    "however , in practise the effects of these are very closely coupled .",
    "for example , our results can be reproduced either by pure passive evolution since @xmath30 in an open universe , or by modest growth ( @xmath37 growth in scalelength &  luminosity ) since @xmath30 in an einstein - de sitter universe . despite this inherent degeneracy",
    "the kormendy relations can firmly exclude very strong growth ( @xmath38 ) from mergers in the redshift range @xmath39 .",
    "the results from a thorough re - examination of the blr hst images of a sample of @xmath28 3cr radio galaxies have been presented .",
    "it has been shown that , in terms of scalelength , absolute magnitudes and kormendy relation there are no significant differences between @xmath40 and @xmath41 3cr radio galaxies .",
    "the two populations appear to be fully consistent with being comprised of old stellar populations formed at high redshift and evolving passively thereafter .",
    "it is obviously true that the fact that both the high and low - redshift radio galaxies have absolute luminosities consistent with pure passive evolution can easily be reconciled with the involvement of some dynamic evolution . in the dynamical model",
    "this simply requires that the proto - galactic clumps which merge to produce the final galaxies where formed reasonably coevally .",
    "the results presented here do not then require that these radio galaxies must have formed in a monolithic collapse at a single redshift .",
    "however , they do suggest strongly that the vast majority of merger activity within this population of massive ellipticals must have been completed before @xmath21 . although semi - analytical galaxy formation models in a @xmath42 cosmology predict as much as 70% of present day ellipticals to already be in place by @xmath21 ( kauffman & charlot 1999 ) , it is worth remembering that the same is not true of bcgs , which are still predicted to grow by a factor of @xmath43 between @xmath2 and the present day ( aragn - salamanca _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) .",
    "the crucial question still to be answered is whether or not it can be proven that a significant difference in cluster environment does exist between the two populations .",
    "if it can be shown that this is definitely the case then the argument forwarded by blr that we are observing the effects of dynamical evolution producing the characteristic mass required for powerful radio emission at the two different epochs remains tenable ; the correlation between luminosity and scalelength would actually predict the @xmath44 and @xmath45 sub - samples to have similar scalelength distributions .",
    "however , as was discussed in section [ background ] , while there have been numerous surveys carried out recently tackling the environments of high-@xmath18 radio sources , the work on the low-@xmath18 environments looks to be subject to possible systematic error .",
    "this suspicion is further strengthened by our new deep r  band hst images of the 10 @xmath27 radio galaxy sub - sample ( mclure _ et al .",
    "_ 1999a , dunlop _",
    "et al . _ 2000 ) .",
    "these images show numbers of apparent companion objects which appear consistent with abell classes @xmath46 .",
    "this is in good agreement with our recent work to model the first to fourth - ranked brightest cluster galaxies ( bcg ) in clusters spanning abell classes @xmath47 , imaged with hst ( dunlop _ et al .",
    "this work has shown that the scalelengths of these objects are not significantly different from the radio galaxy scalelength results presented here .    in an attempt to disentangle the radio galaxy environment problem ,",
    "more near - infrared observations of the low-@xmath18 radio galaxies and quasars from our hst programme are planned , to compliment our existing r and b  band images of this sample .",
    "this combined dataset will allow a fully qualitative investigation of the cluster environments of the low-@xmath18 radio galaxies with which to compare with the existing high-@xmath18 environmental data .",
    "if it transpires that there is no significant difference in 3cr environments at high and low-@xmath18 , then a much simpler picture of powerful radio galaxy evolution emerges .",
    "combined with the scalelength evidence presented here , this would suggest that the host galaxies of powerful radio sources are basically the same sort of objects at _ all _ redshifts from @xmath48 . in this picture",
    "the fall - off in 3cr radio power over this redshift range would simply be due to the progressively smaller amount of gas available to feed the central engine .",
