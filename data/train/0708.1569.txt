    "electronic transport properties of graphene have attracted much interest since the experimental measurements were performed recently.@xcite many theoretical models for the electric transport in graphene were focused on the short - range impurity scatterings,@xcite but the predictions can not describe the experimental observations that the electric conductivity of graphene linearly depends on the carrier concentration.@xcite for the charged impurity scatterings , some theoretical works including the numerical diagonalization of the finite - electron system @xcite and the calculations using the boltzmann formalism @xcite have been performed .",
    "the obtained electric conductivity is in overall agreement with the experiment .",
    "these works show strong evidence that the charged impurities are responsible for the electronic transport properties in graphene .",
    "the boltzmann transport theory for graphene is based on the one - band approximation,@xcite which is different from the usual two - dimensional systems .",

    ", charge carriers in both bands should contribute to the electric transport .",
    "therefore , the development of a proper transport theory for the dirac fermions is of fundamental importance .",
    "the method of using the current - current correlation function should be such a choice , but it has been applied only for short - range impurity scatterings . because of the complex nature of the involving matrix algebra , this approach has not yet been extended to study the transport in graphene with impurities of finite - range potentials .    in this work",
    ", we present a new formalism for the electric transport of dirac fermions under finite - range impurity scatterings based on the current - current correlation function .",
    "the current - vertex correction is shown to be determined by four - coupled integral equations .",
    "the two energy bands of the dirac fermions are taken into account in this scheme .",
    "the present result should provide the more reasonable description of the electric transport of dirac fermions at low doping and at finite temperature .",

    "the energy bands are given by two dirac cones at the corners of the hexagon brillouin zone . by noting this fact",
    ", we separate @xmath5 in momentum space into two parts : intravalley scatterings ( within the same dirac cone ) and the intervalley ones ( between the different dirac cones ) . using the pauli matrices @xmath6 s and @xmath7 s to coordinate the electrons in the two sublattices and two valleys , and suppressing the spin subscripts for briefness ,",

    "the momentum transfer @xmath24 is constrained so that an electron at @xmath12 is scattered to @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) in the same ( different ) valley . within the validity of the dirac - fermions description for graphene , the carrier concentrations should be low and the radius of the fermi circle is thereby small . since the most important momentum transfer is about the order of the diameter of fermi circle , for low energy excitations",
