    "supersymmetry ( susy ) remains the most popular theory for solving the hierarchy problem , albeit the recent discovery of a 125 gev higgs boson , which makes most low energy susy models suffer from fine - tuning to some extent @xcite . from the viewpoint of model - building , the mechanism of susy breaking",
    "remains a puzzle .",
    "usually , it is assumed that spontaneous breaking of susy occurs in some hidden sector and is mediated to visible fields by certain mechanism .",
    "then a massless fermion named goldstino appears , which in the existence of local susy is absorbed into the longitudinal component of gravitino . if susy is broken in multiple sectors independently , each sector gives a goldstino @xmath3 with susy breaking scale @xmath4 .",
    "one linear combination of @xmath3 is massless and eaten by the gravitino , while the orthogonal combination remains as a physical state and is named pseudo - goldstino .",
    "the property and related phenomenology of pseudo - goldstino have been investigated in the literature @xcite . comparing to the gravitino , the interactions of pseudo - goldstino are not totally constrained by the supercurrent and thus some of its coulpings could be large enough to have intriguing phenomenology . in the framework of gauge mediated susy breaking ( gmsb ) ,",
    "pseudo - goldstino can make final states softer and more structured at colliders @xcite . in gmsb with more than two hidden sectors",
    "the multi - photon signature was discussed in @xcite and the lhc detectability for the higgs boson decay into a pseudo - goldstino was examined in @xcite .",
    "the non - observation of sparticles at the 7 tev and 8 tev runs of the lhc has set stringent bounds on colored sparticles .",
    "however , the electroweak sparticles are less constrained because of their small production rates , and can still have masses below 1 tev .",
    "theoretically , a light spectrum of electroweak sparticles is naturally predicted in some frameworks like anomaly mediation and non - minimal gauge mediations .",
    "so the study of electroweak sparticles , especially the light neutralinos and charginos , is rather important for testing susy at the lhc . at the lhc",
    "the neutralinos and charginos can be directly produced through the drell - yan process and vector boson fusion .",
    "in many conventional scenarios with @xmath5-parity , the lightest neutralino is stable and just leads to missing energy in the experiments .",
    "but in some low scale gauge mediation scenarios the lightest neutralino can decay into a photon plus a gravitino . in the scenario of susy breaking in two hidden sectors ,",
    "the lightest neutralino can decay to a pseudo - goldstino plus a @xmath0-boson or higgs boson . in this work we focus on such a two - sector susy breaking scenario to study the lhc detectability for the productions of lightest neutralino and chargino .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we will make a brief review on the framework with pseudo - goldstino and discuss its possible effect on the neutralino and chargino decays .",
    "then in section iii we take an effective way to study the corresponding signal at the lhc .",
    "finally , we give our conclusions in section iv .",
    "due to the non - renormalization theorem of superpotential , the spontaneous susy breaking is communicated to visible fields through the non - trivial khler potential @xmath6 and gauge kinetic function @xmath7 . after integrating the hidden sector fields and parameterizing their information in a non - linear way @xcite @xmath8 the following representative term which contributes to the soft mass",
    "can be obtained @xmath9 in the above equations , @xmath3 is the so - called goldstino and @xmath10 are respectively the soft masses for the chiral fields and gauginos .",
    "the trilinear @xmath11 terms and bilinear @xmath12 could also be constructed easily and we do not list them for simplicity . in the two - hidden - sector scenario with the definition @xmath13 and @xmath14 , the combination @xmath15 is eaten by the super - higgs mechanism , while one pseudo - goldstino @xmath16 is left . after substituting the expression of @xmath17 and making some rotations , we get the interaction lagrangian up to order @xmath18 : @xmath19 here the parameters @xmath20 and @xmath21 are defined as @xmath22 in our analysis we assume a large hierarchy between @xmath23 and @xmath24 ( we assume @xmath25 so that @xmath26 is very large ) . in this case",
    "the pseudo - goldstino can couple more strongly to visible fields than ordinary goldstino ( gravitino ) .",
    "further , we will consider a small @xmath27 which happens for a large @xmath26 ( @xmath28 is suppressed ) and a very small @xmath29 ( such a tiny gaugino mass is easily achieved if the susy breaking sector @xmath24 approximately preserves r - symmetry @xcite ) . in this special case , the pseudo - goldstino couplings with the photon or transverse @xmath0-boson , which are proportional to @xmath27 in eq.([leta ] ) , are suppressed .",
    "so in our following analysis we neglect the pseudo - goldstino couplings with the photon or transverse @xmath0-boson .",
    "of course , a pseudo - goldstino should have a mass . at tree level",
    "its mass comes from the intrinsic property of sugra .",
    "also it can get loop corrections , which are very model - dependent . in our analysis",
    "we assume that the pseudo - goldstino is rather light so that a neutralino can decay into a pseudo - goldstino plus a @xmath0-boson .",
    "so our numerical results are only applicable to a rather light pseudo - goldstino ( for a rather light pseudo - goldstino , say below 10 gev , we can approximately neglect its mass in numerical calculations ) .",
    "the phenomenology of a rather massive pseudo - goldstino was considered in @xcite .",
    "now we look at the effects of pseudo - goldstino in concrete models . in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm )",
    ", the lagrangian for the neutralinos and charginos is given by @xmath30 here @xmath31 represent the four neutralinos in the gauge eigenbasis @xmath32 and their mass matrix is given by @xmath33 @xmath34 are charginos in the gauge eigenbasis @xmath35 and their mass matrix is given by @xmath36 the couplings to the physical higgs and gauge bosons are given by @xmath37 @xmath38 since the contribution in eq .",
    "( [ leta ] ) is proportional to @xmath39 , there are two pseudo - goldstino interaction terms which should be added to the above lagrangian : @xmath40 with the parameters @xmath41 and @xmath42 given by @xmath43 in the above matrices , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the mixing angles in the higgs sector with @xmath46 .",
    "we used the notations @xmath47 , @xmath48 ( @xmath49 is the weinberg angle ) and @xmath50 , @xmath51 .",
    "-boson and pseudo - goldstino . ]",
    "the linear terms induce a small mixing between neutralinos and pseudo - goldstino , so we have to make a rotation to the mass eigenstate basis for neutralinos and then the small mass mixing can be treated perturbatively . for example , the vertex between @xmath0-boson and pseudo - goldstino @xmath52 appears after a mass insertion @xmath53 , as shown in fig .",
    "the matrices @xmath54 and @xmath55 are defined as @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the rotation to diagonalize the neutralino mass matrix .",
    "other interactions could be obtained in the same way , such as the interaction between chargino and pseudo - goldstino . since in this scenario the couplings of pseudo - goldstino with photon or transverse component of @xmath0-boson are negligible , the two possible decay channels for the lightest neutralino are @xmath0 or @xmath58 plus @xmath59 .    from the above analysis",
    "we can get the structure of the interactions for pseudo - goldstino .",
    "however , there are many parameters involved , especially in the chargino and neutralino rotation matrices .",
    "so we only pick out some representative interactions to study the corresponding phenomenology .    to study the phenomenology",
    ", we employ the effective lagrangian @xmath60 . \\label{eff}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here we list all possible couplings , some of which may be turned off in specific cases .",
    "the decay widths of the lightest neutralino and chargino to pseudo - goldstino are given by @xmath61,\\label{eq17}\\\\ \\gamma(\\chi^{\\pm}\\rightarrow w^{\\pm } g^{\\prime})&= & \\dfrac{m_{w}^{2}}{16\\pi m_{\\chi } } \\dfrac{(g_{\\chi w_{1}}^{2 } + g_{\\chi w_{2}}^{2})\\widetilde m_\\phi^{4}}{f^{2 } } \\left(1-\\dfrac{m_{w}^{2}}{m_{\\chi}^{2}}\\right ) \\left[\\dfrac{m_{\\chi}^{4}}{2m_{w}^{4}}+\\dfrac{m_{\\chi}^{2}}{2m_{w}^{2}}-1\\right ] .",
    "\\label{eq18}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first two decay modes have been considered in @xcite and we checked that our results agree with theirs . in our calculation",
    "we fix @xmath62 and all the couplings @xmath63 to be unity . under these assumptions ,",
    "the weak scale neutralino or chargino have the decay width at the order of @xmath64 gev and the decay length @xmath65 cm so they will decay inside the detector .",
    "note that these parameters have no effects on the production rates of neutralino or chargino .",
    "as long as the neutralino and chargino only decay to pseudo - goldstino , their signal rates are not sensitive to these parameters .    about the parameter space in the neutralino / chargino sector , following the analysis in @xcite , we classify it according to the relative values of @xmath66 and @xmath67 : ( i ) @xmath68 ; ( ii ) @xmath69 ; ( iii ) @xmath70 .",
    "each case corresponds to a different property of the lightest neutralino , called the lightest ordinary sparticle ( losp ) . in the first case ,",
    "the losp is higgsino - like , which can not only decay to higgs , but also decay to @xmath0-boson though a mass insertion of @xmath71 . in the second and third cases the losp is respectively wino - like and bino - like , which only decays to a higgs boson plus a goldstino through its mass mixing with the higgsino . for the lightest chargino , which is too light to decay into a neutralino plus an on - shell @xmath1-boson",
    ", it now can decay into a @xmath1-boson plus a pseudo - goldstino .",
    "note that in the second case the interaction vertex needs more than one insertion , so wino may mainly decay to gravitino . since the decay to gravitino has the same collider signature",
    ", we assume the lightest chargino totally decay to pseudo - goldstino .",
    "note that in addition to the above decays , the neutralino can also decay to a real goldstino ( gravitino ) , which may be competitive and need to be checked .",
    "the corresponding decay widths are given by  @xcite @xmath72 here we see that the decay @xmath73 is suppressed for a higgsino - like neutralino .",
    "so in the following we demonstrate the results for a bino - like neutralino and compare with the decays into a pseudo - goldstino . for numerical calculations , we fix the parameters @xmath74 , @xmath75  gev , @xmath76  gev and @xmath77  tev .",
    "the soft mass @xmath78 is a combination of higgs soft parameters whose values can be obtained from softsusy @xcite once @xmath79 , @xmath67 and the sm - like higgs mass ( we take 125 gev ) are fixed .",
    "note that these higgs soft parameters receive contributions from two susy - breaking sectors and we assume the two contributions are equal ( say @xmath80 ) in the following numerical example .    ) or real goldstino ( @xmath81 ) , as a function of @xmath26 . ]    with the above fixed parameters , we vary @xmath26 and show the decay widths in fig.[width ] .",
    "as expected , for a small @xmath26 the decays into real goldstino are important while for a large @xmath26 the decays into pseudo - goldstino become dominant .",
    "the reason is obvious : the couplings of pseudo - goldstino are proportional to @xmath78 , which can be enhanced by a large @xmath26 , as shown in eq.([eq6 ] ) .",
    "in this section we study the direct productions of the lightest neutralino and chargino followed by the decays to pseudo - goldstino at the lhc . in our study",
    "we assume that other susy particles ( like squarks , sleptons , heavy higgs bosons and gluino ) are heavy enough to be decoupled .",
    "the mass of the sm - like higgs boson is fixed at @xmath82 gev .",
    "for the parameters @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath67 , they will be fixed with different values in three different cases listed in the preceding section .",
    "the sign of @xmath67 is assumed to be positive and @xmath79 is fixed as 10 in the calculation .",

    "since in our scenario the signals are quite rare compared with the huge sm backgrounds ( as shown in our results , only at 14 tev lhc with a rather high luminosity can our signals be possibly accessible ) , the current lhc limits at 7 and 8 tev with rather limited luminosities are not yet able to constrain the scenario under our consideration .",
