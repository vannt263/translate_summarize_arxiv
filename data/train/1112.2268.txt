    "because of their interesting combination of properties , including high strength , low density , and high electrical and thermal conductivities , carbon nanotubes ( cnts ) have been of great interest as nanoscale elements in a variety of applications , @xcite . aligned arrays of cnts can be readily synthesized to form foam - like materials that combine low density with a desirable dissipative response , @xcite .",
    "there are a few interesting structural and mechanical features of these materials : first , the thermal chemical vapor deposition process that is typically used to synthesize the arrays @xcite results in a gradient in physical properties ( such as density ) along the height of the structure .",
    "this leads to strain localization during compression , with the majority of the structure remaining undeformed while increasing strain results in the sequential addition of highly localized buckles @xcite .",
    "second , there is a large amount of strain recovery after compression ( typical of the cnt arrays that we study , which are synthesized using a vapor phase catalyst , @xcite , but not for all types of cnt arrays that are synthesized differently , @xcite ) .",
    "third , the stress - strain response of the material is hysteretic , with different loading and unloading paths .",
    "it has been noted in the past that repeated compressive cycles result in a hysteresis of decreasing area and decreasing stress at any given strain for the first few cycles , @xcite .",
    "this effect , sometimes referred to as _ preconditioning _ , ceases after the initial few cycles , resulting in a hysteresis of constant area for loading cycles thereafter .",
    "finally , we observe that this preconditioning effect is dependent on the maximum strain reached .",
    "when the maximum strain of all previous loading cycles is exceeded , the stress response obtained at these elevated strains is that of the un - preconditioned material , as if it had never been compressed previously , @xcite .",
    "the features we have enumerated for the foam - like response of cnt arrays are analogous to those observed in other soft materials such as filled rubbers . in the context of rubbers ,",
    "this response is associated with what is termed the _",
    "mullins effect _ , @xcite .",
    "capturing these features simultaneously in models has proven difficult in the past for other materials , with frequent use of simplifying assumptions that only allow models to match some of the experimental observations ( see , e.g. , the",
    "_ idealized mullins effect _ modeled in @xcite ) .",
    "we show in the present work that a suitable generalization of the mesoscopic mass - spring model of cnt structures recently proposed by @xcite is able to handle the material damage due to preconditioning and permanent deformation within an effective one - dimensional framework .",
    "we introduce preconditioning - induced material damage by setting to zero the stiffness of a suitable percentage of the bistable springs that describe the response of the material at the microscopic scale .",
    "this allows us to model permanent axial deformation of the structure through the irreversible ` annihilation ' of the springs with zero stiffness .",
    "we model an infinitesimal portion of a cnt foam through the bistable spring model described in @xcite , which we hereafter briefly summarize .",
    "we assume that such a portion of the foam can be described as a chain of @xmath0 lumped masses @xmath1 , with @xmath2 clamped at the bottom of the chain .",
    "the adjacent masses are connected to each other through bistable springs characterized by the axial strains @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the axial displacement of the mass @xmath5 ( positive upward ) , @xmath6 is the equal spacing between the masses , and @xmath7 .",

    "the mechanical energy of the structure is @xmath41 let @xmath42 be the given total stress .",

    "the first spring located closer to the bottom of the structure is the softest and yields first , changing its phase , @xcite .",

    "( note that in accordance with ( a4 ) , the springs @xmath53 with small spring constant @xmath52 do not flip . ) therefore , similar to the case of @xmath25 identical springs , the total state of the series of springs is still completely specified by two scalar parameters @xmath54 and @xmath55 and the additional parameter @xmath56 .",
