    "the most luminous non - nuclear x - ray sources in nearby galaxies occur in regions of current or recent star formation .",
    "some of them have x - ray luminosities exceeding the isotropic eddintgton luminosity @xmath9 for an @xmath10 black hole ( bh ) ; they are commonly labelled ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) .",
    "the conservative interpretation is that the large majority of ulxs are the upper end of the high - mass x - ray binary population , powered by an accreting bh formed from `` normal '' stellar processes .",
    "if so , their ( apparent ) extreme luminosity is due to any of the following three reasons , or to a combination of them : moderately unisotropic emission @xcite ; mildly super - eddington luminosities @xcite ; extremely heavy stellar - mass bhs , with masses @xmath11@xmath12 @xcite .",
    "those scenarios also require mass accretion rates @xmath13 , where the accretion parameter @xmath14 .",
    "alternatively , there is still room for the more intriguing hypothesis that at least some ulxs are powered by intermediate - mass bhs @xcite .    in the absence of direct kinematic measurements ( because of the faintness of their optical counterparts ) , x - ray spectral and timing studies have been used to try and constrain bh masses in ulxs .",
    "such model - dependent arguments rely on the ( expected ) simple scaling of characteristic variability timescales and disk temperatures with bh mass , and on the correspondence of ulx spectral states with the `` canonical '' states of galactic bhs , for which the mass is accurately known .",
    "unfortunately , ulxs do not appear to have the same state - transition behavior as galactic bhs ; for example , the most luminous sources are rarely found in a high / soft state , dominated by a standard accretion disk @xcite .",
    "the x - ray spectra of some ulxs are dominated by an unbroken power law , with photon index @xmath15@xmath16 , whose physical origin is still unclear .",
    "others have a broad component with a steepening or downward curvature above @xmath17 kev and sometimes a small soft excess below @xmath18 kev ; this kind of spectrum may come from a slim disk , or from the inner region of a standard disk , heavily modified by comptonization when @xmath13 .",
    "however , there is no clear gap between the two kinds of spectra , and the phenomenological classification of a source in either class usually depends on the signal - to - noise ratio available in the observations .    a small subsample of ulxs stands out from this general spectral classification",
    ": they have a thermal spectrum with temperatures @xmath19 kev and no emission above 1 kev .",
    "this is similar to the spectrum of classical supersoft sources in the milky way and magellanic clouds , but their luminosity is one or two orders of magnitude higher .",
    "the two most luminous supersoft ulxs are m101 ulx-1 @xcite and ngc4631 x1 @xcite .",
    "both sources are strongly variable or transient ; when in a high state , their blackbody luminosity is @xmath20 erg s@xmath2 .",
    "other supersoft ulxs reaching bolometric luminosities @xmath21 erg s@xmath2 have been found in m81 @xcite , in the antennae @xcite and ( two ) in ngc300 @xcite .",
    "their thermal spectra can , in principle , provide tighter constraints on the size of the emitting region , and hence more significant tests for the geometry of the accretion flow and the nature and mass of the accretor .    while ulxs with a harder ( power - law - like , slim - disk or comptonized ) x - ray spectrum may be interpreted as the upper end or the natural extension ( either in bh mass or accretion rate ) of stellar - mass bhs , supersoft ulxs appear like the upper end of nuclear - burning white dwarfs , which can not be more massive than @xmath22 .",
    "therefore , their high apparent luminosities are even more difficult to explain",
    ". the white dwarf scenario may be salvaged if supersoft ulxs are seen in a transient outburst phase , well above the eddington luminosity of a white dwarf ( @xmath23 erg s@xmath2 ) .",
    "the other main competing scenarios for the emitting region in supersoft ulxs are a strong outflow from a stellar - mass bh accreting at a super - eddington rate ( @xmath24 ) , or a standard disk around an intermediate - mass bh .",
    "for the disk to be so cool ( @xmath25 kev ) , the bh mass needs to be @xmath26 .    in this paper , we re - examine the physical interpretation of the supersoft ulx in ngc4631 , by comparing the _ xmm - newton _ observations taken when the source was in a more luminous state , with earlier _ chandra _ observations in a lower state .",

    "we re - extracted the _ xmm - newton _ data and coadded the pn and mos spectra with a suitably averaged response function .",
    "this is equivalent to fitting them simultaneosly , but provides a better signal - to - noise ratio for discrete features .",
    "we recover the result of @xcite , with a spectrum dominated by a soft blackbody component , plus residual features ( both in emission and absorption ) especially at @xmath104@xmath105 kev ( figure 2 ) .",
    "such features are already evident in each individual epic spectrum , as plotted in figure 4 of @xcite , and become more significant when the spectra from all three detectors are combined .",
    "the visual impression of such systematic residuals is confirmed by the fit statistics : the best - fitting absorbed blackbody model has @xmath106 and can be safely rejected .",
    "the residual emission and absorption features may not seem to affect the bolometric luminosity significantly , compared with the dominant blackbody emission .",
    "however , different models for such residual components have the effect of shifting the fitted temperature of the blackbody component between @xmath107 and @xmath108 ev , with a dramatic effect on the extrapolated , unabsorbed bolometric luminosity .",
    "some examples are summarized in table 2 .",
    "when we model the deviations from a pure blackbody spectrum with only emission components ( e.g. , a gaussian as in @xcite , or an optically - thin thermal plasma ) , we find an extrapolated luminosity @xmath109@xmath110 erg s@xmath2 . however , we also find that there is a statistically - significant absorption feature at @xmath111 kev .",
    "this may be analogous to the fe - l absorption edges found in some seyfert galaxies @xcite .",
    "ignoring this edge leads to apparently lower blackbody temperatures and therefore higher extrapolated bolometric luminosities .",
    "when we include this edge in our models ( tables 2 and 3 ) , we obtain bolometric luminosities as low as @xmath112@xmath113 erg s@xmath2 , depending on whether we assign the same , high intrinsic absorption to both the optically - thin and optically - thick thermal components , or only to the latter . on the other hand , the isotropic emitted luminosity @xmath114 erg s@xmath2 in the @xmath4@xmath44 kev band provides a solid lower limit to the bolometric luminosity .    in our best - fitting model ( table 3 )",
    ", the optically - thin emission component contributes less than 1/10 of the extrapolated bolometric luminosity , but about 1/4 of the observed flux in the full @xmath4@xmath44 kev band , about half of the unabsorbed luminosity at energies @xmath115 kev , and 2/3 of the unabsorbed luminosity at energies @xmath116 kev .",
    "this explains why modelling such component has a great effect on the fit parameters and inferred luminosity .",
    "the unabsorbed luminosity of the optically - thin thermal plasma is @xmath117 erg s@xmath2 ( bolometric luminosity @xmath118 erg s@xmath2 ) .",
    "the 1991 _ rosat_/pspc spectrum is also dominated by a blackbody component at @xmath119 kev @xcite , and a webpimms estimate suggests it may have similar luminosity to the 2002 _ xmm - newton _ spectrum .",
    "however , the _ rosat _ data do not have enough counts and spectral resolution to constrain the temperature ( and therefore the extrapolated emitted luminosity ) more accurately .",
    "if we assume that the spectral model was the same as in the _ xmm - newton _ observation ( choosing for example the model listed in table 3 ) , and leave only the relative normalization free between the two epochs , we find that the two spectra are indeed consistent with being very similar ( figure 3 ) , with a _",
    "flux normalization @xmath120 times higher than for _ xmm - newton_.    the best - fit blackbody temperature ( @xmath121 kev ) and ( extrapolated ) blackbody luminosity ( @xmath122 erg s@xmath2 in 2002 , and @xmath123 erg s@xmath2 in 1991 ) correspond to a characteristic radius @xmath124 cm or @xmath125 cm ( in 2002 and 1991 , respectively ) for the optically - thick emitting surface .",
    "we should also keep in mind that a simple blackbody approximation tends to overestimate the true luminosity of supersoft sources by a factor of a few @xcite , so the true luminosity may be even lower .",
    "[ fig : figure2 ]      from the _ chandra _ data in the low state , we found @xmath126 net acis counts , corresponding to a count rate of @xmath127 ct s@xmath2 ( a factor of two less than estimated by @xcite ) .",
    "the breakdown of the net counts in different energy bands is : @xmath128 counts at @xmath4@xmath129 kev , and @xmath130 counts at @xmath129@xmath131 kev . dividing the interval into three bands ,",

    "so , although there are not enough counts for detailed spectral fitting , we have at least a strong indication that the source was very soft ( or `` quasi - soft '' in the definition of @xcite ) . even if we assume no intrinsic absorption , the count distribution rules out a power - law spectrum with photon index @xmath137 at the 90 per cent confidence level ( using the cash statistic , @xcite ) .",
    "the optically - thin thermal plasma component fitted to the high - state spectrum is clearly inconsistent with the lower flux detected in the low state ( figure 4 ) .",
    "more generally , optically - thin thermal plasma models ( at fixed solar metallicity ) are also ruled out at the 90 per cent confidence level ( the best - fitting model has a cash - statistic parameter @xmath138 ) soft , optically - thick thermal emission ( blackbody or disk - blackbody ) is a much better model for the observed count distribution .",
    "we estimate a disk - blackbody temperature @xmath139 kev ( 90 per cent confidence limits ; cash - statistic fit parameter @xmath140 ) or a simple blackbody temperature @xmath141 kev ( cash - statistic fit parameter @xmath142 ) . the best - fitting unabsorbed luminosity is @xmath143 erg s@xmath2 , although the 68 per cent confidence interval includes values as high as @xmath144 erg s@xmath2 ; but in any case , the luminosity is lower than in the supersoft state , as intuitively expected from a simple scaling of the count rate between the _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ observations . from the few detected counts , we can not strongly rule out the alternative possibility that the lower count rate in the _ chandra _ observation is also or mostly due to a much higher intrinsic absorption ( @xmath145 @xmath146 ) of the same , luminous super - soft component .",
    "but in the absence of independent evidence for that dramatic change in absorption , and by analogy with the behaviour of other accreting systems ( including the supersoft source in m101 mentioned earlier , @xcite ) , here we consider the low - state scenario as the most plausible .",
    "the absence of the optically - thin thermal plasma component in low state is somewhat puzzling .",
    "the rapid change between 2000 and 2002 suggests that it was not due to diffuse hot gas at large distances from the source , but was instead directly associated with the high state or outburst .",
    "the psf and source extraction region are of course much larger for _ xmm - newton _ , which may suggest a contamination from galactic - scale diffuse emission ; however , we tested this possibility using the _ chandra _ images , and we do not find evidence of local enhancements in the diffuse soft emission .",
    "different choices of background extraction regions in _ xmm - newton _ do not remove this component . in conclusion",
    ", we suggest that the most likely explanation at this stage is that the line emission and absorption edge are really associated with the compact source .",
    "if the emission is due to an expanding bh wind or white dwarf photosphere ( scenarios outlined in sections 4.2 and 4.3 ) we speculate that this may be evidence of an optically thick and optically thin component in the outflow .",
    "[ fig : figure3 ]    [ fig : figure4 ]",
    "three scenarios have been considered for this source ( and for the handful of similar ones in other nearby galaxies ) , based on the properties of its high / supersoft state @xcite : standard disk emission from an intermediate - mass bh ; super - eddington outflows from a stellar - mass bh ; nuclear - burning white dwarf .",
    "we discuss here how the low - state appearance provides stronger constraints .      in the standard disk model",
    ", the bh mass can be expressed as a function of inner - disk temperature and bolometric disk luminosity ( or normalization constant ) : @xmath147 @xcite . assuming @xmath148 and imposing @xmath149 @xmath146 ( galactic line of sight ) , we used the cash - statistics fit to the _ chandra _ data , and we derived a contour plot of the acceptable region in the bh - mass versus disk - luminosity space ( figure 5 ) .",
    "we do not have enough net counts to determine the 90% confidence contours , but we can at least identify a `` most plausible '' ( 68% confidence contours ) region in that plane . the large uncertainty in the inner - disk temperature ( from @xmath150 to @xmath18 kev ) is reflected in a large range of masses and unabsorbed luminosities .",
    "regardless of bh mass , the luminosity appears to be always @xmath151 . however , there are observational and theoretical arguments against a disk - dominated low / soft state at @xmath152 . at those luminosities , accreting bhs",
    "are generally found in a power - law - dominated low / hard state , which is ruled out in this case .",
    "hence , we suggest that the low / soft appearance of the source in the _ chandra _ observation does not favour the disk - blackbody model",
    ".    moreover , the fitted inner - disk temperature in the low / soft state appears to be similar or slightly higher than the thermal temperature in the high / supersoft state ( @xcite , and table 2 ) .",
    "if the thermal emission is due to an accretion disk , we expect the disk to be cooler , when the net count rate ( a proxy for the accretion rate and emitted luminosity ) is two or three orders of magnitude lower ; @xmath153 in a standard disk .",

    "we have already noted that in the _ chandra _ observation , the emitted luminosity may be two or three orders of magnitude lower .",
    "hence , we do not expect the super - eddington outflow to be present in that lower state .    in the canonical scheme of bh accretion states , inferred mostly from the study of stellar - mass galactic bh binaries",
    ", moderately active ( sub - eddington ) bhs are either in the high / soft state ( dominated by a disk - blackbody component with @xmath154 kev ) , or in the low / hard state ( power - law component with @xmath15@xmath16 ) .",
    "neither state is consistent with the observed _ chandra _ spectrum . and",
    "conversely , no stellar - mass bhs have been observed in a disk - dominated state with @xmath155 kev and @xmath156@xmath157 erg s@xmath2 .",
    "if the supersoft component in the higher state is attributed to a disk outflow during super - critical accretion , we would have to conclude that the lower - state spectrum does not look like a canonical state for stellar - mass bhs .",
    "an alternative possibility we should consider is that the sequence of high and low states is not due to accretion state transitions , but to a long - term precession of the binary system , such that the moderatley collimated outflow moves in and out of our line of sight .",
    "when we are looking down the outflow , we may be observing the undisturbed , cooler ( soft spectrum ) outer disk , at radii larger than the spherization radius .",
    "however , a difficulty of this interpretation is that the predicted isotropic luminosity of the outer standard disk down to the spherization radius should be @xmath158 erg s@xmath2 for a stellar - mass bh .",
    "this is much higher than observed .    in conclusion",
    ", we suggest that the stellar - mass bh scenario , although still viable , has not yet provided a perfectly self - consistent interpretation for this source , or at least requires a new kind of accretion - state behaviour or accretion - disk structure , so far unobserved in stellar - mass bhs .    [ fig : figure5 ]    [ fig : figure6 ]      the observed temperature and luminosity of x1 in the low / soft state is consistent with the thermal emission from surface hydrogen burning on a massive white dwarf , @xmath159@xmath160 ( figure 6 ) .",
    "such process can occur at accretion rates just below the steady burning rate ( @xmath0 a few @xmath161 yr@xmath2 : @xcite .",
    "the white dwarf is sufficiently hot that hydrogen burns on its surface immediately as it is accreted ; for this reason , the system does not go through classical - nova outbursts .",
    "a blackbody luminosity @xmath144 erg s@xmath2 at a temperature @xmath162 kev are well within the 68% confidence limit of the _ chandra _ detection .",
    "these values correspond to a radius @xmath163 km for a spherical emitter , consistent with the radius of a @xmath160-@xmath164 white dwarf .",
    "however , the high / supersoft phases can not be explained with steady surface burning .",
    "it was found from numerical simulations @xcite that steady surface hydrogen burning on a @xmath160-@xmath164 white dwarf can occur only for accretion rates @xmath165 yr@xmath2 ; above that limit , the photosphere of the white dwarf expands to large radii and shuts off accretion .",
    "this may be what is happening in x1 , with a sequence of outbursts in between phases of more steady surface burning ( at reduced accretion rate ) or simply of surface cooling .",
    "the estimated radii ( a factor of 10 higher than in the low / soft state , section 3.1 ) and blackbody temperatures ( a factor of two lower ) fitted to the high / supersoft spectrum are consistent with photospheric expansion .    from the sequence of x - ray observations between 1991 and 2002 , we speculate that x1 is in a transient supersoft state about half of the time .",
    "since the emitted luminosity in the high / supersoft state is @xmath0 a few @xmath1 erg s@xmath2 , and that in the low / soft state is @xmath0 a few @xmath166 erg s@xmath2 , the long - term average luminosity may be @xmath167 .",
    "this clearly raises two problems , related to the average long - term accretion rate and to the peak luminosity .",
    "since all the power must ultimately come from nuclear burning , the long - term average luminosity requires an average accretion rate @xmath168@xmath169 yr@xmath2 . from stellar evolution models",
    "@xcite , it appears that even late - type b stars ( likely progenitor of the putative massive white dwarf and likely donor star in the system ) can provide such extreme rates during thermal - timescale episodes of mass transfer , lasting @xmath170 yr . if the same accretion rate was used to power an accreting bh , it would produce a bolometric luminosity @xmath171@xmath172 erg s@xmath2 , which is similar to the maximum luminosity inferred for ulxs ; the x - ray luminosity distribution of ulxs has a downturn at @xmath173 erg s@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "in other words , explaining the most luminous supersoft sources ever found as nuclear - burning sources with average long - term luminosity @xmath174 erg s@xmath2 requires mass - transfer conditions similar to those needed to explain the most luminous ulxs as accreting bhs with luminosities @xmath0 a few @xmath175 erg s@xmath2 .",
    "we speculate that this may be more than a coincidence .",
    "moreover , the alternative ulx scenario of a super - eddington outflow from a stellar - mass bh ( section 4.2 ; @xcite ) also requires mass transfer rates of up to @xmath176 yr@xmath2 on the thermal timescale , possibly from a b - type donor star",
    ". therefore , the required limits on the long - term average mass transfer rate are similar for both models .    as for the peak luminosity",
    "@xmath0 a few @xmath1 erg s@xmath2 , this is highly super - eddington for a white dwarf , and a factor of 10 above the luminosity produced by steady surface burning .",
    "however , steady burning can not persist at accretion rates @xmath176 yr@xmath2 .",

    "super - eddington outbursts powered by non - steady episodes of nuclear burning have been observed in some novae , most notably lmc 91 , which peaked at @xmath182 erg s@xmath2 @xcite .    in conclusion , we suggest that a fireball white - dwarf model is still a viable scenario for this extreme source ( and perhaps also for the whole class of supersoft ulxs ) , considering that its true bolometric luminosity is likely to be an order of magnitude less than originally estimated @xcite , and that the required accretion rate @xmath176 yr@xmath2 is similar to the rate invoked for super - eddington outflows in the most luminous ulxs .      from a timing study of the _ xmm - newton _ observation",

    "other well - known supersoft sources such as cal87 are known to have a low - mass donor with a binary period of a few hours @xcite .",

    "a b - type donor star is consistent with a massive white - dwarf compact object , both from theoretical arguments @xcite and observationally @xcite ; the lifetime of the b - type progenitor of a @xmath188 white dwarf is @xmath189 myr .",
    "if the @xmath190-hr x - ray modulation is not the binary period , then it could be due either to a disk precession in the bh scenario , or to the rotational period of the white dwarf , or to pulsations in the donor star which affect the rate of mass transfer .",
