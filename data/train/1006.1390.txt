    "high - mass stars evolve somewhat differently from low - mass stars .",
    "there appear to be ( at least ) four main evolutionary stages of high - mass star formation ( e.g. zinnecker & yorke 2007 ) : infra - red - dark clouds ; hot molecular cores ; compact hii regions ( including hyper- and ultra - compact hii regions ) ; and classical hii regions .",
    "the earliest observed phase of high - mass star formation is the infra - red - dark cloud ( irdc ) stage .",
    "irdcs are very dense , massive interstellar clouds in which high - mass stars are believed to form .",
    "they were first identified in infra - red surveys , by the _ infrared space observatory _",
    "( iso ; perault et al .",
    "1996 ) and the _ midcourse space experiment _ ( msx ; egan et al .",
    "1998 ) , as denser , higher - mass and more distant analogues to prestellar cores ( ward - thompson et al . 1994 , 2007 ) , from which lower - mass stars form ( e.g. solar - type stars ) .",
    "in fact , irdcs are so dense that they are optically thick even at infra - red wavelengths ( @xmath0824@xmath1 m ) . in many of these clouds",
    "there is little or no detectable star formation ( e.g. parsons et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "the mass of an irdc can be hundreds , or even thousands of solar masses ( e.g. rathborne et al .",
    "often , dense , dark cores can be seen within each cloud .",
    "these are known as infrared - dark cores , and can have masses of up to @xmath0100  m@xmath2 , and are typically only 0.1  pc or less in radius .",
    "hence they have densities of up to @xmath010@xmath3 hydrogen molecules  m@xmath4 ( e.g. egan et al .",
    "1998 ; carey et al .",
    "1998 , 2000 ) .",
    "these are the most likely candidate sites of high - mass star formation .",
    "the _ herschel space observatory _ was launched on 2009 may 14 , and carries a 3.5-metre diameter telescope , and three scientific instruments designed to carry out imaging and spectroscopy ( pilbratt et al .",
    "2008 , 2010 ) . the spectral and photometric imaging receiver ( spire ) is the long - wavelength camera on board _ herschel _ ( griffin et al . 2009 , 2010 ) .",
    "the hi - gal survey is a _",
    "open time key project that is mapping the inner galaxy in five bands between 60 and 500  @xmath1 m ( molinari et al .",
    "2010a , b ) .",
    "hi - gal will map the area common to the _ spitzer _ glimpse & mipsgal ( rieke et al . 2004 ) and msx ( price et al .",
    "2001 ) galactic plane surveys , but at fir and submm wavelengths .",
    "hence , the irdcs will be seen in emission , in contrast with the previous surveys .",
    "one of the science goals of hi - gal is to determine the physical properties of irdcs and hence constrain the initial conditions of high - mass star formation .    in this paper",
    "we demonstrate the use of the 3d monte carlo radiative transfer code phaethon in converting two - dimensional imaging data of irdcs from the hi - gal survey , into the physical parameters of the clouds being studied , with particular emphasis on the data from spire . in section 2",
    "we describe the radiative transfer code and the specific input parameters used in this study . in section 3 we present radiative transfer models of three irdcs with different morphologies ( spherical , flattened , and turbulent ) . in section 4 we use the spire photometer simulator to produce simulated observations of the irdc models , and in section 5 we compare the radiative transfer models with the simulated observations . in section 6 , we apply this method to determine the properties of g29.55 + 00.18 , an irdc from the hi - gal survey .",
    "finally , in section 7 we summarize our results .",
    "the radiative transfer calculations are performed using phaethon , a 3d monte carlo radiative transfer code ( stamatellos 2003 ; stamatellos & whitworth 2003 , 2005 ; stamatellos et al . 2004 , 2005 , 2007 ) . the code uses a large number of monochromatic luminosity packets to represent the radiation sources in the system ( stars and/or the ambient radiation field ) .",
    "the luminosity packets are injected into the system and interact ( are absorbed , re - emitted , scattered ) stochastically with it . if a luminosity packet is absorbed its energy is added to the local region and raises the local temperature . to ensure radiative equilibrium",
    "this packet is re - emitted immediately with a new frequency chosen from the difference between the local cell emissivity before and after the absorption of the packet ( bjorkman & wood 2001 ; baes et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "the input parameters of the code are : ( i ) the density profile of the system , ( ii ) the dust properties ( e.g. opacity ) , and ( iii ) the radiation sources present ( e.g. ambient radiation field and/or stars ) .",
    "the code calculates the dust temperature , and produces observables : ( i ) the sed of the system at different viewing angles , and ( ii ) synthetic images of the system at different viewing angles and at different wavelengths .",
    "a starless irdc is assumed , hence the cloud is only heated by the ambient radiation field .",
    "for the ambient radiation field we adopt a revised version of the black ( 1994 ) interstellar radiation field .",
    "this consists of radiation from giant stars and dwarfs , thermal emission from dust grains , cosmic background radiation , and mid - infrared emission from transiently heated small pah grains ( andr et al . 2003 ) .",
    "this radiation field represents well the interstellar radiation field in the solar neighbourhood but it is probably an underestimate of the ambient radiation field in the galactic plane",
    ". an enhanced ambient radiation field could result in higher dust temperatures at the surface of the clouds but the temperatures in the central cloud regions are not expected to be significantly higher ( only a few degrees ) .",
    "the luminosity packets representing the ambient radiation field ( typically a few @xmath5 packets ) are injected from the outside of the cloud with injection points and injection directions chosen to mimic an isotropic radiation field incident on the cloud ( stamatellos et al .",
    "2004 , 2007 ) .",
    "the dust grains in dense clouds are expected to coagulate and accrete ice mantles , thus we use the ossenkopf & henning ( 1994 ) opacities for the standard mathis , rumpl & nordsieck ( 1977 ) interstellar grain mixture ( 53% silicate & 47% graphite ) , with grains that have coagulated and accreted thin ice mantles over a period of @xmath6 years at densities @xmath7 .",
    "we assume a gas - to - dust mass ratio of 100 .",
    "we model 3 different cloud geometries : ( i ) a spherical cloud ; ( ii ) a flattened cloud ; and ( iii ) a turbulent cloud with substructure .",
    "we also vary the mass , density and radius .",
    "the parameter values are chosen so as to illustrate some of the variety of parameter values that the code can handle .",
    "the parameters of each of the three cases are listed in table  1 .",
    "lccc + & * spherical * & * flattened * & * turbulent *   + @xmath8 ( cm@xmath4 ) & @xmath10 & @xmath11 & @xmath12 + @xmath13 ( pc ) & 0.08 & 0.04 & 0.08 + @xmath14 ( pc ) & 1 & 1 & 1.5 + @xmath15 ( m@xmath16 ) & 1300 & 510 & 27200 + @xmath17 ( kpc ) & 2 & 2 & 2 +      for the spherical cloud we adopt a plummer - like density profile ( plummer 1915 ) ,    @xmath18 ^ 2 } \\,,\\ ] ]    where @xmath8 is the density at the centre of the cloud , and @xmath19 is the extent of the region in which the density is approximately uniform .",
    "this density profile is consistent with observations of low - mass cores in nearby star forming clouds , such as l1544 , l63 and l43 ( e.g. kirk et al . 2005 , 2006 , 2007 ) , and has been used to model such clouds ( whitworth & ward - thompson 2001 ) .",
    "the values of these parameters are given in table  1 .",
    "the mass of the cloud is 1300  m@xmath20 .",
    "figure  1 shows that the temperature in the cloud drops from @xmath21  k at the edge of the cloud to @xmath22  k at the centre of the cloud .",
    "the central dust temperature is @xmath23  k lower than the typical temperatures in the central regions of low - mass ( i.e. a few solar masses ) clouds ( @xmath24  k ; e.g. stamatellos & whitworth 2003 ; stamatellos et al . 2004 ) .",
    "this is due to the much higher mass and extinction of the irdc .",
    "heating from cosmic rays , which is not included in our models , may increase the temperature in the centre of the cloud to @xmath25  k. additionally , a stronger external radiation field in the galactic plane could also possibly increase the temperature by a few degrees ) .",
    "figure  2 shows that the sed of the cloud peaks at around 200  , consistent with the low temperatures in the cloud . because the temperature gradient in the irdc is larger than the temperature gradient in a low - mass core , the sed is broader .",
    "for the flattened cloud we use a density profile of the form @xmath26 ^ 2 } \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the density at the centre of the cloud , and @xmath19 is the extent of the region in which the density is approximately uniform ( see stamatellos et al .",
    "the values of these parameters are given in table  1 .",
    "the parameter @xmath27 determines the equatorial - to - polar optical depth ratio @xmath28 , i.e. the maximum optical depth from the centre to the surface of the cloud ( which occurs at @xmath29 ) , divided by the minimum optical depth from the centre to the surface of the cloud ( which occurs at @xmath30 and @xmath31 ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath32 determines how rapidly the optical depth from the centre to the surface rises with increasing @xmath33 , i.e. going from the north pole at @xmath34 to the equator at @xmath35 . in this model",
    "we assume @xmath36 , i.e. a slightly flattened cloud , and @xmath37 . this geometry may be more realistic than the spherical cloud presented in the previous section .",
    "the mass of the cloud is 510  m@xmath20 ( see table  1 ) .",
    "figure  3 shows that the temperature profile in the cloud is similar to the case of the spherical cloud ; the temperature drops from 18 k at the edge to 5 k in the centre of the cloud .",
    "however , due to the flattened cloud geometry the cloud ` equator ' is colder than the cloud ` poles ' .",
    "figure  4 shows that the sed of the cloud is also similar to that of the spherical cloud .",
    "there is no dependence on the viewing angle despite the fact that the optical depth to the centre of the cloud becomes @xmath38 at @xmath39 .",
    "this is because the temperature varies with the direction in the cloud only in the outer region of the cloud , which is optically thin even at wavelengths up to @xmath39 .",
    "we finally examine a more realistic cloud geometry , i.e. a turbulent cloud . to produce this cloud",
    "we start off with a spherical cloud having a density profile @xmath40 where @xmath8 is the density at the centre of the cloud , and @xmath19 is the extent of the region in which the density is approximately uniform . note that this profile is less steep than the profile used for the spherical irdc , hence the higher mass of this cloud .",
    "the values of the parameters are again given in table  1 .",
    "the mass of the cloud is 27200 m@xmath20 . a large turbulent velocity field ( @xmath41 ) is imposed to the cloud ( e.g. goodwin et al . 2004 ) , and the cloud is evolved using the sph code dragon , for enough time to produce substructure , i.e. until cores form in the cloud ( e.g. stamatellos et al .",
    "dragon is a gravitational hydrodynamics code which invokes a large number of particles to represent a physical system .",
    "it uses an octal tree ( to compute gravity and find neighbours ) , adaptive smoothing lengths , multiple particle timesteps , and a second - order runge - kutta integration scheme .",
    "the resulting cloud is shown in figure  5 , in which we plot its density on 3 planes ( @xmath42 pc , left , @xmath43 pc , centre and @xmath44 pc , right ) .",
    "we perform a radiative transfer simulation for this cloud using the method of stamatellos & whitworth ( 2005 ) .",
    "the calculated dust temperature is presented in figure  6 .",
    "the dust temperature is similar to the temperature calculated in the previous cases .",
    "however , the temperature distribution at a particular distance from the centre of the cloud is broader due to the clumpiness of the cloud .",
    "figure  7 shows that the sed of the cloud peaks at longer wavelengths than in the previous two cases , as the cloud is more massive and consequently it is cooler .",
    "simulated observations of the modelled irdcs are performed , to assess the impact of instrument systematics .",
    "the simulations are produced using v2.31b of the spire photometer simulator ( sibthorpe , chanial and griffin 2009 ) .",
    "this software simulates both the spire instrument , and the _ herschel _ observing modes .",
    "the simulations are performed in a configuration which matches the hi - gal observations .",
    "the fast scanning speed ( 60per second ) option is used ( see the spire observers manual ) , and the observations are made in the spire parallel mode , to match the hi - gal mapping mode .",
    "these observations are performed by continuously scanning the telescope backwards and forwards in a raster pattern while the instruments continuously take data .    for hi - gal two maps",
    "are obtained by scanning first along one axis of the instrument array , and then scanning along the perpendicular axis of the array .",
    "this provides redundancy in the data , allowing for the use of maximum likelihood techniques to be used in the subsequent data reduction ( sibthorpe et al .",
    ".    realistic noise with a 1/_f _ spectrum is simulated with each of the spire bolometers using independent noise parameters based on pre - flight test data .",
    "thermal drifts are not included in these simulations as the information is not available to model these accurately .",
    "however , the _ herschel_/spire pipeline will automatically remove these drifts , making their omission from these simulations insignificant .",
    "the simulated data are calibrated and reduced from time - line data to maps using a simple map - maker .",
    "maps at the three spire bands , 250 , 350 and 500@xmath1 m are obtained , having full width half maximum beams sizes of 18 , 25 and 36 arcseconds respectively .",
    "synthetic maps of the plane - of - sky intensity distribution of the three irdcs are produced using the radiative transfer model .",
    "the maps are produced at eight wavebands ( 8 , 15 , 70 , 160 , 250 , 350 , 500 , and 500  @xmath1 m ) that replicate the filter sets of recent telescope facilities .",
    "the 8 and 15  @xmath1 m wavelengths match two bands from the msx satellite ( price et al .",
    "the near infra - red 8  @xmath1 m is also found on _ spitzer _ s irac camera ( fazio et al . 2004 ) . the 8  @xmath1 m filter can show strong emission from pah grains ( flagey et al .",
    "the radiative transfer model does not include transiently heated small grains .",
    "these grains dominate the emission at some ir bands ( e.g. li & draine 2003 ) . in this paper",
    "we focus at longer wavebands ( @xmath45 m ) , where there is no emission from such grains",
    ".    the far - infrared bands at 70 and 160  @xmath1 m bands match approximately the 70 and 160  @xmath1 m bands of _ spitzer _ s mips camera ( rieke et al . 2004 ) , the n60 and n160 bands of akari ( kawada et al .",
    "2007 ) , and the 70 and 160 bands of _ herschel _ s pacs camera ( poglitsch et al . 2009 , 2010 ) .",
    "the submillimetre bands at 250 , 350 , and 500  @xmath1 m match approximately the filter set of _ herschel _ s spire ( griffin et al .",

    "the 500  @xmath1 m band is also roughly equivalent to scuba s and scuba2 s 450  @xmath1 m band ( holland et al .",
    "1999 ; 2006 ) .    given a synthetic map of intensity it is possible to simulate the observing process and produce simulated observations that match the resolution and expected instrumental characteristic of the chosen camera .",
    "as described in section  [ sec : spire ] , we have used the spire simulator to produce simulated observations for the 250500  @xmath1 m data .        figure  8 shows the model irdcs before ( blue colour table ) and after ( red colour table ) they have been processed into simulated observations .",
    "the columns are labelled at the top with the wavelength ; the rows are labelled on the right - hand side with the description of the cloud .",

    "the pixel size of the model cloud maps at all wavelengths is 0.019 pc ( 1.9 arcsec ) for the spherical and flattened cloud , and 0.028 ( 2.9 arcsec ) for the turbulent cloud .",
    "the pixel sizes of the 250 , 350 , and 500  @xmath1 m maps are approximately a third of the spire beam fwhms , corresponding to 0.058 pc ( 6 arcsec ) , 0.097 pc ( 10 arcsec ) , and 0.116 pc ( 12 arcsec ) at 250 , 350 , and 500  @xmath1 m respectively . the 8- and 15-@xmath1 m bands",
    "are not shown in figure  8 , as they simply show up as dark clouds against a bright background .",
    "irdcs have been identified in large numbers from infra - red surveys ( simon et al .",
    "2006 ; peretto & fuller 2009 ) as higher - mass and more distant analogues to the optically dark clouds of gas and dust seen in silhouette against a bright background in v - band surveys ( e.g. barnard 1927 ; lynds 1962 ) .",
    "starting at the shortest wavelength in figure  8 ( 70  @xmath1 m ) this extinction can be seen in the spherical and flattened model clouds as a central dark patch .",
    "the size of this patch decreases with increasing wavelength until 500  @xmath1 m where it has either closed up entirely or can no longer be resolved .",
    "we note that the size of the emitting region at 500  @xmath1 m is approximately the same size as the dark region at 70  @xmath1 m .",
    "the substructure of the turbulent cloud which is evident in the model images is hardly visible in the simulated images due to the angular resolution of the simulations being larger than the length scale of the substructure at the assumed distance of the irdc ( 2  kpc ) .",
    "table [ tab : fwhm ] lists the fwhm of 2d gaussians fitted to each of the 250500  @xmath1 m model clouds .",
    "these show quantitatively that the fwhm of the emitting region also decreases with increasing wavelength .",
    "this can be ascribed to the centre - to - edge temperature gradient .",
    "cold dust located towards the centre of the cloud will preferentially radiate at longer wavelengths , whereas warmer dust located towards the edge of the cloud will preferentially radiate at shorter wavelengths .",
    "the wavelength dependent size of the cloud is also visible in the simulated observations .",

    "no a priori knowledge ( e.g. about the density profile and the dust temperature ) is assumed whilst generating the radial profiles .",
    "we compute an equivalent semi - major axis @xmath46 for each pixel @xmath47 with coordinates @xmath48 by assuming that it lies on an ellipse with the same origin , position angle , and axis ratio @xmath49 as the equivalent 350  @xmath1 m cloud ( i.e. , the simulated observations use the axis ratio of the 350  @xmath1 m simulated cloud ) .",
    "the spherical and turbulent models have axis ratios of @xmath50 and the flattened model cloud has an axis ratio of @xmath51 ; it is assumed that the clouds axes have a position angle of zero .",
    "the equivalent semi - major axis @xmath46 is given by @xmath52 where @xmath53 are the coordinates of the centre of the cloud .",
    "once @xmath46 is known , we bin the pixels into bins of width @xmath54 and compute the mean and standard deviation of the intensities of the pixels in each bin . for the model clouds we use a bin width equal to the pixel size .",

    "the top row of figure  9 shows the distribution of mean intensity versus equivalent semi - major axis for each of the eight model bands .",
    "the flux density has been normalised for clarity , but no minimum flux has been subtracted ( i.e. zero on the relative scale equates to zero on the absolute scale ) .",
    "the colour key for each band is shown beneath figure  9 .",
    "all three clouds show the characteristic irdc extinction holes at pacs equivalent wavelengths ( 70 and 160  @xmath1 m ) .",
    "the spherical and flattened clouds are completely extinguished at 0.20.3 pc , but the turbulent cloud is extinguished across its entire radius ( due to its higher mass ) .    the middle row of figure  9 shows the profiles of the three spire bands . the model profile , from the upper row , is reproduced as a dashed line . plotted over this",
    "is the profile of the simulated observation .",
    "the process of observing the clouds causes flux to be averaged out due to the resolution limit of the telescope .",
    "this moves flux towards regions of lower flux , i.e. outward or towards central holes , and is most pronounced for bands where there is a significant central dip in the model profiles .",
    "the lower panel of figure  9 shows the results of fitting an optically - thin @xmath55 ( ossenkopf & henning 1994 ) greybody to the radial spectral energy distribution of each cloud .",
    "the blue and purple curves show the best - fit temperature for a greybody fitted to the 250 - 500  @xmath1 m and 160 - 500  @xmath1 m model cloud profiles respectively ( i.e. using the results of the radiative transfer model ) .",
    "the error bars show the greybody fit to the 250 - 500  @xmath1 m simulated observation profiles ( i.e. taking into account instrumental effects ) .",
    "these are interpolated to the lowest common resolution ( 500  @xmath1 m ) before fitting the greybody .",
    "these figures show that temperatures fitted to the observed fluxes match the temperatures that would have been fitted to the model irdcs in the absence of instrumental effects .",
    "however the fitted temperatures are higher than the actual temperatures ( i.e. the ones calculated with the radiative transfer model ) in the centre of the cloud and lower than the actual temperatures at the outer parts of the cloud .",
    "this is because the dust temperature from the simulated observations corresponds to an averaged temperature in the observed column , just as in real observations .",
    "this demonstrates that for accurately determining the dust temperatures in irdcs , detailed radiative transfer modelling is needed along with multi - wavelength , spatially resolved observations .",
    "accurate dust temperatures are important for determining the masses of these clouds .",

    "this has important implications for the inferred cloud stability and for the derived mass function of irdcs .",
