    "the electroweak standard model ( sm ) has so far been very successful and consistent with experiments .",
    "however , it is likely that there exist other models , of which the sm is the effective low energy limit .",
    "the future colliding facilities , which will operate at tev scale , are likely to reveal new physics beyond sm . the symmetry - breaking and the non - abelian gauge - boson sectors are the most peculiar natures of sm . a lot",
    "have been discussed on the possibilities of the future hadronic and @xmath10 colliders to probe the gauge - boson and the symmetry - breaking sectors . with the recent discussion of the physics possibilities at @xmath9 and @xmath11 colliders @xcite",
    ", they might be as important as the hadronic and @xmath10 colliders .",
    "they have backgrounds much cleaner than the hadronic colliders and should be as clean as the @xmath10 colliders , and also photon has anomalous gluon and quark contents @xcite that enable one to study qcd directly .",
    "the @xmath12 collisions at @xmath10 machines can be realized by directing a low energy ( a few @xmath13 ) laser beam almost head - to - head to the incident positron beam . by compton scattering",
    ", there are abundant , hard back - scattered photons in the same direction as the incident positron beam , and carry a substantial fraction of the energy of the incident positrons .",
    "therefore , we have the @xmath12 collisions",
    ". for details please see refs .",
    "other possibilities include the bremsstrahlung and beamstrahlung effects @xcite but these methods produce photons mainly in the soft region @xcite , and beamstrahlung depends critically on the beam structure @xcite",
    ". therefore we shall limit all the calculations to @xmath9 collisions produced by the laser back - scattering method .    in recent studies of the higgs production in @xmath9 collisions",
    "@xcite through @xmath14 the cross section is just a factor of 2 or 3 smaller than that of @xmath15 for @xmath16  tev , and so this production might be a possible channel in searching for the higgs boson . however ,",
    "the backgrounds have not been fully analysed , therefore we can not draw any decisive conclusions .",
    "for the higgs in the intermediate mass range ( imh ) the signature , due to the dominate decay of @xmath17 and hadronic decay of @xmath18 , will be @xmath19 where there are 4 jets plus missing energy in the final state .",
    "two of the four jets are reconstructed to the @xmath18 mass and the other two can be reconstructed as a resonance peak at the higgs mass . for this signature",
    "the backgrounds are the @xmath0 , @xmath20 and @xmath3 productions when the @xmath18 and @xmath21 bosons decay hadronically into four jets .",
    "if the higgs mass falls very close to the @xmath18 or @xmath21 masses , the signal is much more difficult to identify and precise calculation of the backgrounds under the @xmath18 and @xmath21 peaks is necessary .",
    "calculations of the @xmath0 , @xmath20 and @xmath3 pair productions are desirable as important potential backgrounds to the imh search through @xmath22 production . in addition",
    ", it also suffers backgrounds from the @xmath23 production @xcite with @xmath24 , and @xmath25 .",
    "also attention has been focused on the single @xmath18 production in the channel @xmath26 @xcite to probe the @xmath27 coupling and search for any anomalous gauge - boson interactions . to probe the @xmath28 coupling , however",
    ", we must go for the boson - pair productions of @xmath29 .",
    "another interesting point is that the quartic @xmath30 and @xmath31 couplings first come in in the @xmath32 and @xmath33 productions .",
    "the calculation of these processes involves delicate cancellation among the contributions from triple gauge - boson , quartic gauge - boson and the other feynman diagrams , which consist of well - tested vertices .",
    "therefore , any anomalous interactions of the triple or quartic gauge - boson vertices will result in deviations from sm predictions .",
    "it is then favorable to quantify precisely the production of these gauge - boson pairs , @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath20 , within sm so that any deviations from these predictions will indicate some new physics in the gauge - boson sector .",
    "one advantage of these gauge - boson pair productions in @xmath9 collisions over hadronic collisions is that they do not have large qcd background as they do in hadronic collisions .",
    "also these processes as probes to test the triple and quartic gauge couplings should be as important as the three gauge - boson productions in @xmath10 colliders@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we calculate the following processes of boson - pair productions in @xmath12 collisions , @xmath34 the processes in eqs .",
    "( [ wz])([zz ] ) are important because they are the major potential backgrounds to the imh search in the channels of eqs .",
    "( [ wh ] ) and ( [ zh ] ) @xcite . besides , the processes in eqs .",
    "( [ wz])([ww ] ) are important tests for sm because they involve non - abelian gauge couplings .",
    "these processes must be quantified precisely within sm before any anomalous triple or quartic gauge - boson interactions can be realized in these channels .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : we briefly describe the calculation methods including the photon luminosity function in sec .",
    "[ ii ] , following which we present the results in sec .",
    "[ iii ] , and then summarize in sec .",
    "we will also present detail formulas for the matrix elements of the processes involved in the appendix  [ amp ] .",
    "we use the energy spectrum of the back - scattered photon given by @xcite @xmath35 \\ , , % \\ ] ] where @xmath36 @xmath37 , @xmath38 is the energy of the incident laser photon , @xmath39 is the fraction of the incident positron s energy carried by the back - scattered photon , and the maximum value @xmath40 is given by @xmath41 it is seen from eq .",
    "( [ lum ] ) and ( [ d_xi ] ) that the portion of photons with maximum energy grows with @xmath42 and @xmath38 . a large @xmath38 , however ,",
    "should be avoided so that the back - scattered photon does not interact with the incident photon and create unwanted @xmath10 pairs .",
    "the threshold for @xmath10 pair creation is @xmath43 , so we require @xmath44 . solving @xmath45 , we find @xmath46 for the choice @xmath47 one finds @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50  ev for a 0.5(1 ) tev @xmath10 collider . here",
    "we have assumed that the electron , positron and back - scattered photon beams are unpolarized .",
    "we also assume that , on average , the number of back - scattered photons produced per positron is 1 ( i.e. , the conversion coefficient @xmath51 equals 1 ) .",
    "the @xmath18 and @xmath21 bosons are detected through their leptonic or hadronic decays .",
    "so we are not going to impose any acceptance cuts on the @xmath18 and @xmath21 bosons for their detections , instead , we assume some detection efficiencies for their decay products to estimate the number of observed events . on the other hand , @xmath52 can be observed directly in the final state by imposing a typical experimental acceptance , say , @xmath53 we use the helicity amplitude method of ref .",
    "@xcite to evaluate the feynman amplitudes , and keep the electron mass @xmath54 finite in all the calculations .",
    "there are totally 11 contributing feynman diagrams in the process @xmath55 , 9 in @xmath56 , 18 in @xmath57 , and 6 in @xmath58 , in the general @xmath59 gauge .",

    "( [ wz])([zz ] ) are given in appendix  [ amp ] .",
    "the processes of eqs .",
    "( [ wh ] ) and ( [ zh ] ) have been calculated in detail in refs .",
    "the total cross - section @xmath60 is obtained by folding the subprocess cross - section @xmath61 in with the photon luminosity function of eqs .",
    "( [ lum ] ) and ( [ d_xi ] ) ; shown in appendix  [ amp ] .",
    "we show the dependence of the cross sections for all the processes of eqs .",
    "( [ wz])([zh ] ) , together with @xmath62 , in fig .",

    "we typically choose @xmath63 = 100  gev in the intermediate mass range , and impose the acceptance cuts of eq .",
    "( [ photoncut ] ) on the photon that occurs in the final state .",
    "the cross section of @xmath20 is overwhelming due to a hugh contribution from the feynman diagrams with an almost on - shell @xmath64-channel @xmath52 propagator .",
    "this hugh cross section , of order 10  pb in the energy range of 0.52  tev , is an advantage to probe the triple or quartic gauge - boson couplings .",
    "the @xmath6 and @xmath7 cross section is of order 0.5 and 1  pb in the same energy range , respectively . for a yearly luminosity of 10  @xmath65",
    ", we have about 5000 @xmath6 and 10000 @xmath7 events .",
    "the hadronic branching fraction of both @xmath18 and @xmath21 is @xmath66 and assuming 50% hadronic detection efficiency , we still have 625 observed events for @xmath6 and 3500 events for @xmath7 , which are numerous enough to observe any anomalous gauge - boson interactions . therefore , even with 1% anomalous gauge coupling it could result in about 6 and 35 events in @xmath6 and @xmath7 productions respectively , and in the order of hundreds of events for @xmath8 production .",
    "therefore , as mentioned above these gauge - boson pair productions as probes to test the triple and quartic gauge couplings are as important as the three gauge - boson productions in @xmath10 collisions , which are of order 0.1  pb for @xmath672  tev @xcite .",
    "@xmath3 production is insignificant at all for the energy range that we are considering .",
    "the @xmath68 production is of order 0.10.2  pb for @xmath16  tev and @xmath69  gev , and @xmath70 production is so much smaller that it will never be discovered . in comparison",
    "we also show the cross section of @xmath71 , which is dominant over the @xmath72 production for @xmath73  tev .",
    "we can see that at @xmath74  tev the @xmath75 cross section is only about a factor of 2.5 ( 2 ) smaller than that of @xmath15 .    for the imh search in @xmath68 production",
    "total background from @xmath8 , @xmath6 and @xmath3 is about two order of magnitudes larger ( see fig .  [ cross ] ) .",
    "but from fig .",
    "[ ptvv ] we can see that the hugh cross section of @xmath8 can go down sharply by requiring a moderate transverse momentum @xmath76 cut , say @xmath77  gev at @xmath78  tev , on the @xmath8 system to keep the @xmath52-propagator far from being on - shell .",
    "further reduction of the @xmath8 cross section can be achieved by central electron vetoing method , i.e. , rejecting events with electrons detected in the central rapidity region ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "then the total background from @xmath6 , @xmath3 and @xmath8 is only a few times larger than the imh signal in @xmath22 production .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath80-tagging has a high efficiency and the invariant mass reconstruction has a good resolution these backgrounds can be substantially reduced , so @xmath68 production remains a possible channel to search for the imh .",
    "however , a more detail analysis taking into account the other backgrounds from @xmath81 and detector resolutions is necessary to establish the higgs - boson signal .    in fig .",
    "[ mvv ] , we show the dependence of the differential cross section @xmath82 on the invariant mass @xmath83 of the boson pair at @xmath84 and 2  tev . as expected , these curves rise a little bit above their corresponding @xmath83 threshold and then fall gradually as @xmath83 increases further .",
    "however , the presence of any anomalous triple or quartic gauge - boson interactions can alter the @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath68 curves to some extent .",
    "these spectra can therefore serve as sm predictions to probe the anomalous gauge - boson sector .",
    "we have quantified the productions of @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath33 , @xmath87 within sm , and presented the helicity amplitudes for these processes .",
    "these processes can probe the non - abelian gauge sector of the sm , and should be as good as the three gauge - boson pair productions in @xmath10 collisions and better than those in hadronic collisions .",
    "the production rate of @xmath20 pair is hugh , and that of @xmath0 and @xmath1 are large enough that a percent - level anomalous gauge - boson interactions can be detected if they exist . on the other hand",
    ", the imh search in the @xmath5 channel seems impossible due to hugh background from @xmath8 and @xmath6 .",
    "however , we have shown in fig .",
    "[ ptvv ] that a @xmath76 cut can substantially reduce the @xmath8 background , together with central electron vetoing method and @xmath80-tagging the total background from boson - pair productions is only a few times larger than the imh signal .",
