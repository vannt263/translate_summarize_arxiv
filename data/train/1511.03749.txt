    "the main motivation of the present work is to study the complexity of meta - modelling as defined in @xcite .",
    "no study of complexity has been done so far for this approach and we would like to analyse if it increases the complexity of a given description logic . + it is well - known that consistency of a ( general ) knowledge base in @xmath2 is exptime - complete .",
    "the hardness result was proved in  @xcite . a matching upper bound for @xmath2",
    "was given by de giacomo and lenzerini by a reduction to pdl @xcite .",
    "+ in this paper , we show that the consistency of a knowledge base in @xmath0 is exptime - complete where the @xmath1 stands for the meta - modelling approach mentioned above .",
    "hardness follows trivially from the fact that @xmath0 is an extension of @xmath2 since any algorithm that decides consistency of a knowledge base in @xmath0 can be used to decide consistency of a knowledge base in @xmath2 . in order to give a matching upper bound on the complexity of this problem",
    ", it is enough to show that there is a particular algorithm with running time at most @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the size of the knowledge base .",
    "the standard tableau algorithm for @xmath2 which builds completion trees , e.g. see @xcite , can be extended with the expansion rules for meta - modelling of @xcite .",
    "this algorithm is the bases for semantic web reasoners such as pellet @xcite .",
    "however , it has a high ( worse case ) complexity , namely nexptime , and can not be used to prove that the consistency problem for @xmath0 is exptime - complete .",
    "+ other approaches to meta - modelling use translations to prove decidability and/or complexity @xcite .",
    "however , translations do not seem to work for @xmath0 due to the combination of a flexible syntax with a strong semantics of well - founded sets . a consistency algorithm for @xmath0 has to check if the domain of the canonical model under construction is a well - founded set .",
    "this is an unusual and interesting aspect of our approach but at the same time what makes it more difficult to solve .",
    "+ the contributions of this paper are the following :    1 .",
    "we define a tableau algorithm for checking consistency of a knowledge base in @xmath0 as an extension of an algorithm for @xmath2 by nguyen and szalas  @xcite .",
    "2 .   we prove correctness and show that the complexity of our algorithm for @xmath5 is exptime .",
    "3 .   from the above two items",
    ", we obtain the main result of our paper which is the fact that the problem of checking consistency of a knowledge base in @xmath0 is exptime - complete .    hence , in spite of the fact that our algorithm has the burden of having to check for well - founded sets",
    ", complexity does not change when moving from @xmath2 to @xmath0 .",
    "a knowledge base in @xmath0 contains an mbox besides of a tbox and an abox .",
    "an mbox is a set of equalities of the form @xmath6 where @xmath7 is an individual and @xmath8 is a concept  @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : firstview ] shows an example of two ontologies separated by a horizontal line .",
    "the two ontologies conceptualize the same entities at different levels of granularity . in the ontology above the horizontal line ,",
    "rivers and lakes are formalized as individuals while in the one below the line they are concepts .",
    "if we want to integrate these ontologies into a single ontology ( or into an ontology network ) it is necessary to interpret the individual @xmath9 and the concept @xmath10 as the same real object .",
    "similarly for @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the mbox for this example contains two equations : @xmath13 these equalities are called _ meta - modelling axioms _ and in this case , we say that the ontologies are related through _ meta - modelling_. in figure [ fig : firstview ] , meta - modelling axioms are represented by dashed edges . after adding the meta - modelling axioms for rivers and lakes , the concept @xmath14 is now also a _ meta - concept _ because it is a concept that contains an individual which is also a concept .",
    "+        this kind of meta - modelling can be expressed in owl full but it can not be expressed in owl dl .",
    "the fact that it is expressed in owl full is not very useful since the meta - modelling provided by owl full is so expressive that leads to undecidability @xcite .",
    "owl 2 dl has a very restricted form of meta - modelling called _ punning _ where the same identifier can be used as an individual and as a concept @xcite .",
    "these identifiers are treated as different objects by the reasoner and it is not possible to detect certain inconsistencies .",
    "we next illustrate two examples where owl would not detect inconsistencies because the identifiers , though they look syntactically equal , are actually different .",
    "[ example : introductionriver ] if we introduce an axiom expressing that _ hydrographicobject _ is a subclass of _ river _ , then owl s reasoner will not detect that the interpretation of @xmath10 is not a well founded set ( it is a set that belongs to itself ) .",
    "[ example : introductionsimpletransference ] we add two axioms , the first one says that @xmath9 and @xmath15 as individuals are equal and the second one says that the classes @xmath10 and @xmath12 are disjoint .",
    "then owl s reasoner does not detect that there is a contradiction .    in order to detect these inconsistencies , @xmath9 and @xmath16",
    "should be made semantically equal , i.e. the interpretations of the individual @xmath9 and the concept @xmath10 should be the same .",
    "the domain of an interpretation can not longer consists of only basic objects but it must be any well - founded set .",
    "the well - foundness of our model is not ensured by means of fixing layers beforehand as in @xcite but it is the reasoner which checks for circularities .",
    "this approach allows the user to have any number of levels or layers ( meta - concepts , meta meta - concepts and so on ) .",
    "the user does not have to write or know the layer of the concept because the reasoner will infer it for him . in this way",
    ", axioms can also naturally mix elements of different layers and the user has the flexibility of changing the status of an individual at any point without having to make any substantial change to the ontology .",
    "in this section we recall the description logic @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "we assume we have three pairwise disjoint sets : a set of individuals , a set of atomic concepts and a set of atomic roles .",
    "individuals are denoted by @xmath17 , atomic concepts by @xmath18 and atomic roles by @xmath19 .",
    "we use @xmath20 to denote arbitrary concepts .",
    "_ concepts _ are defined by the following grammar : @xmath21 we omit parenthesis according to the following precedence order of the description logics operators : ( i ) @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 ( ii ) @xmath25 , ( iii ) @xmath26 .",
    "outermost parenthesis can sometimes be omitted .",

    "syntactic equality between concepts or individuals is denoted by @xmath29 .",
    "+ we say that @xmath30 is a _ ( syntactic ) subconcept _ of a concept @xmath31 if @xmath32 where @xmath33 is defined as follows .",

    "@xmath37 , called a _ tbox _ , is a finite set of axioms of the form @xmath38 , with @xmath30 , @xmath31 any two concepts .",
    "statements of the form @xmath39 are abbreviations for @xmath38 and @xmath40 .",
    "@xmath41 , called an _ abox _ , is a finite set of statements of the form @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 or @xmath45 .",
    "the set of all individuals occurring in @xmath46 is denoted by @xmath47 .    to avoid confusion with the syntactic equality , for the statements of the abox we always write the information of it , i.e. @xmath48 .",
    "note that aboxes contain equalities and inequalities between individuals in spite of the fact that they are not part of the standard definition of @xmath2 .",
    "there are two reasons for adding them .",
    "first of all , this is a very useful owl feature .",
    "second and most important , it makes it evident that equality and difference between individuals play an important role in the presence of meta - modelling since an equality between individuals is transferred into an equality between the corresponding concepts and conversely .",

    "+ the key feature in our semantics is to interpret @xmath7 and @xmath8 as the same object when @xmath7 and @xmath8 are connected through meta - modelling , i.e. , if @xmath6 then @xmath652 .",
    "this allows us to detect inconsistencies in the ontologies which is not possible under the hilog semantics  @xcite .",
    "our semantics also requires that the domain of the interpretation be a well - founded set . a domain such as @xmath653 where @xmath654 is a set that belongs to itself",
    ", it can not represent any real object from our usual applications in semantic web .",
    "the exptime algorithm for @xmath0 presented in this paper can be optimized in several ways . instead of constructing first the and - or graph and then checks whether the graph contains a consistent marking",
    ", we can do these two tasks simultaneously @xcite . adding @xmath174 to the tbox is not efficient since it generates too many expansions with or - branching .",
    "we can instead add @xmath655 and apply optimizing techniques of lazy unfolding @xcite .",
