    "the short period intermediate polar ( ip ) ex hydrae , belongs to the subclass of cataclysmic variables in which the strength of the magnetic field of the white dwarf ( wd ) is not strong enough to achieve synchronization between the rotation of the primary and the orbital period of the binary ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "the wd accretes from a surrounding disc or ring into the magnetic poles , producing a variety of observable phenomena ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it was first identified by @xcite as an eclipsing system with an orbital period @xmath14 min , a disc inclination @xmath15 and a second prominent period @xmath16 min due to the rotation of the wd @xcite . the photometric visual light curve in ex  hya is mostly dominated by the spin period which produces a sine - like modulation with an amplitude between @xmath17mag .",
    "there are also occasional enhanced maxima and persistent narrow eclipses clearly associated with the orbital period cycle @xcite .",
    "earlier determinations of the radial velocity semi  amplitude of the primary , @xmath6 , have been obtained in the optical by several authors @xcite .",
    "they estimated the masses of the binary from their derived @xmath6 values and the mass of the secondary from different mass - radius calibrations @xcite .",
    "a first determination of @xmath6 from the fuv was obtained by @xcite .",
    "high resolution results have been obtained from the euv and x - rays @xcite .",
    "a first order estimation of the radial velocity semi - amplitude of the secondary , @xmath18 , was derived by @xcite using a cross - correlation technique and later by @xcite from and absorption lines .",
    "mass determinations for the primary star have also been obtained by @xcite and @xcite from the x - ray spectra , as well from indirect methods by @xcite .",
    "a wide variety of mass values for the binary components has been obtained from these publications .",
    "its large @xmath19 ratio of @xmath20 places this system out of the usual spin equilibrium rotation value of @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "if this is the case , the magnetosphere must fill the roche lobe of the primary star and there should be , at most , an accretion ring or no disc at all ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". however , as pointed out by @xcite , there are several reasons to suggest that ex  hya has a small magnetosphere far from equilibrium , among them are the eclipse timings of the partial x - ray eclipse which suggest a magnetospheric radius of only @xmath3 4 times the white - dwarf radius ; the lack of polarisation ; the long - term secular decrease and some of the radial velocity studies , which show the presence of an emission component that is modulated with the orbital period .",
    "these controversies extend to the size of the inner disc .",
    "the previous @xmath6 results have a large range of values .",
    "this may be due to the variety of methods used to determine this value , or due to the use of a combination of emission lines , or obtained with very different spectral resolutions .",
    "since we have obtained high - resolution spectroscopy in the red and done simultaneous visual photometry , we believe that our data could help to unravel the reason of these different results .",
    "in particular , our analysis of h@xmath0 , includes a main disc as well as a broader accretion component .",
    "ccd photometry with the johnson  v filter was obtained in 2008 january 1013 , using the 1.5-m telescope with the marconi ccd for the first two nights and the 0.84-m for the rest of the nights with the thomson detector ( see table  [ tab : logpho ] ) .",
    "all ccd images were processed using the iraf package .",
    "images were bias subtracted and flat field corrected .",
    "a nearby comparison star with @xmath22  mag was used to determine the v magnitude of ex  hya .",
    ".log of photometric observations [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     our results from the individual doppler tomograms are similar to the overall tomogram shown in figure  [ fig : streamall ] .",
    "however , we detect substantial variations , particularly on the shape of the strong hotspot . in most nights",
    "it appears well constrained and near the @xmath23 point , while in other cycles it appears highly smeared .",
    "this smeared feature , or stream , could be correlated to a different combination of spin - orbital cycles .",
    "further discussion can be found in section  [ sec : discus ] .",
    "the trail and reconstructed spectra in figure  [ fig : trailspec ] are dominated by the strong hotspot and the stream .",
    "the double - peaked accretion disc appears sometimes in the background with a peak - to - peak separation of @xmath31000 km  s@xmath4 .",
    "the contribution from the hotspot alone is clear in the narrow s - wave in the first and fourth nights and it shows a variation with an amplitude of @xmath3500 km  s@xmath4 .",
    "there seems to be an eclipse of the s - wave near phase zero in most of the trail spectra , nevertheless in trail 3 and 4 the eclipse appears to affect the red - shifted wing , while in trail 2 and 5 there is almost no eclipse at all .",
    "furthermore , there is a bright spot in trail 2 near the s - wave . the stream is clearly shown in nights two and three , where we see a broader s - wave .",
    "this stream is particularly strong , both in tomogram 5 and also in its corresponding trail spectra , where there is also a prominent contribution at phases 0.1 to 0.3 .",
    "there is a red - shifted emission at phase 0.6 in trail 1 to 4 , extending from a slightly greater velocity amplitude than the hotspot .",
    "this emission does not follow the double - peaked doppler shift and it encounters the red wing of the hotspot at phase 1.0",
    ". a blue - shifted counterpart , occurring shorter in phase , is observed around phase 0.3 in trail 1 and 5 , and around phase 0.4 in trail 4 .",
    "these features , combined with our radial velocity results , will be discussed in the next section .",
    "ex  hya is a well studied system , both photometrically and spectroscopically .",
    "however , its spin to orbital period ratio , close to 2:3 , complicates its analysis and creates controversies , leaving still some unsolved problems . among them",
    "is the existence or not of an accretion disc , and consequently the question of the size of the inner disc and the magnitude of its magnetosphere @xcite .",
    "another remaining problem is the constancy of the orbital period .",
    "while we have shown here that the orbital period remains constant , we can not rule out a possible small sinusoidal oscillation ( as far as our own observations ) . however the spin period is definitely decreasing at a slow rate @xcite . another important problem is the accurate determination of @xmath6 and the mass of the wd ( even in this eclipsing system ) , as we discussed in section  [ sec : spec ] .",
    "with respect to the problem of the radial velocity semi - amplitudes of the accretion disc ( and presumably of the primary star ) , we have pointed out that the published optical data have a large scatter ( see table  [ tab : k1lit ] ) .",
    "these works have been performed in the blue part of the visible spectra , while our observations are centred around a strong h@xmath0 emission line .",
    "it is plausible that the disc component is more dominant in h@xmath0 than in higher order balmer lines and hence , the @xmath6 result would give a more accurate determination .",
    "the similarity of the results in the radial velocity curves ( see section  [ sec : spec ] ) , obtained from medium and high velocity regions have a deep implication : the high velocity component that we have analysed is moving in the orbital plane and therefore should be interpreted as an inner disc region .",
    "in fact , our analysis indicate a robust result , both from the main disc component as well as from the broad wings .",
    "furthermore , our @xmath5kms@xmath4value is in accord with the uv @xcite and x - ray @xcite results .",
    "still , the observed rm - type effect remains a problem and defies easy explanation .",
    "if this is the selective occultation of a rotating body , the simple explanation would be that the secondary star is partially occulting a symmetric disc . before ( but close to ) phase zero ,",
    "the secondary star will ( partially ) occult first the blue shifted parts of the disc , while shortly afterwards , it will mask the receding parts of the disc . as a result",
    ", the radial velocity distortions should be centred around phase zero , and this should be observed in both , the main disc and the inner disc .",
    "we observe , however , that the asymmetry in both cases , is centred around phase 0.9 .",
    "this implies that there is an asymmetric component present , and there is only one asymmetric component in the disc that could account for this shift , namely , the hot spot .",
    "we have calculated that the phase offset @xmath24 between eclipses and inferior conjunction is around 0.1 ( see table  [ tab : orbparam2 ] ) .",
    "although we have avoided measuring the hot spot velocity component , it is possible that the hot spot itself is physically occulting the high velocities behind it .",
    "therefore , we propose that the rm - type effect is in this case a combination of the occultation of the disc velocity regions by both the hot spot and the secondary star . this explanation is supported by the position of the spot shown in the tomography and by the fact that the rm - type effect moves closer to phase zero for the broad wings ( see figure  [ fig : velcur2 ] ) , suggesting that the effect of the occultation by the hot spot is smaller for higher velocity regions .",
    "in other words , the hot spot eclipse is a grazing eclipse and does not affect the central parts of the disc , nor the white dwarf itself .    with respect to the accurate determination of the masses of the binary , we believe that our careful determination of @xmath6 by two different methods , consistent with uv and x - ray measurements , coupled with the accurate determination of @xmath18 by @xcite , enable us to derive reliable masses ( see section  [ sec : baspar ] ) .",
    "the obtained values are consistent with a short period system with a primary mass with a mean value of 0.8 m@xmath10 ( e.g. @xcite ) and a secondary star with enough mass to produce nuclear reactions , still approaching the minimum orbital period @xcite .",
    "a long standing discrepancy with the mass of the primary obtained indirectly by x - rays , has also been resolved recently by @xcite .",
    "the results of the doppler tomography are quite revealing .",
    "although the overall tomogram , shown in fig  [ fig : streamall ] , does not reveal the weak broad component , due to the dilution effect in a standard projection , mentioned in section  [ sec : dopmap ] , the trail spectra does show this high velocity component ( up to @xmath32000 kms@xmath4 ) .",
    "the individual tomograms , show that there are fast changes in the hot spot or stream from cycle to cycle , and particularly from night to night , revealing different combination of spin - orbital cycles . to illustrate the effects of the spin - orbital configuration in the tomography , as well as in other related aspects discussed below , we present in figure  [ fig : diagram ] , three diagrams of the inner disc and the magnetosphere in a classical configuration ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "( we must clarify at this point that these schematics are a visual help only and we do not intend to quantify any physical parameter from it ) .",
    "spin phases 0.0 and 0.5 are defined at the time when the visible magnetic pole points away and towards the observer respectively .",
    "each one has also been labelled for orbital phases 0.0 ( when the secondary star is in front of the observer ) and 0.5 ( when the secondary is behind the disc ) . the hot spot and stream episodes appear connected with the spin - orbital cycle combination .",
    "two examples are selected , which have the desired photometric combination of spin and orbital phases ( see figure  [ fig : vphot ] ) .",
    "an episode with a more pronounced stream would correspond , as seen mainly in tomogram 4 , when the material is smeared because the magnetic pole points toward the secondary star ( _ lower diagram _ , @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) ; a less pronounced stream , e.g. tomogram 1 , would produce a more compact spot , when the pole points away from the observer but the secondary star is again at inferior conjunction ( _ top diagram _ , @xmath27 , @xmath26 ) .",
    "all other tomograms show , either a contained hot spot or a hot spot and a stream , but in these cases , although the spin and orbital phases are at some point in conjunction or opposition , the photometry has a complex behaviour , which makes the interpretation of these streams or compact spots more difficult",
    ". this would be the case of tomogram 3 , a stream seems to dominate due to the high photometric activity near spin cycle 42 .",
    "it is clear that these stream or compact spots do not affect our radial velocity results , as the hot spot and or stream , have been avoided by our double gaussian of the main disc component and single gaussian analysis of the broad component .",
    "although the h@xmath0 radial velocity curves depicted in figures  [ fig : velcur1 ] and [ fig : velcur2 ] have a clear orbital modulation , the spin and orbital modulations have a mixed behaviour .",
    "for example , the ew and more clearly , the relative flux , is modulated mainly with the spin cycle , but this modulation also depends on the orbital phase . as an example , we show in figure  [ fig : mod_all ] ( lower panel ) that the maximum flux occurs when the magnetic upper pole of the wd points away from the observer , at spin phase 1.0 and the secondary is behind the disc , while a minimum is seen at the same phase when the secondary is in front ( figure  [ fig : mwings ] , top panel ) .",
    "our analysis of the broad component presented in sections [ sec : radvel2 ] and [ sec : swidth ] shows that the radial velocity behaviour of the inner region is very similar to that of the disc component .",
    "this suggests that the observed broad wings arise from material predominantly coming from the inner disc region , still in the orbital plane , although there may be also some small contributions from the accretion curtain . as we described earlier ,",
    "the width of the broad component is modulated with the spin period ( figure  [ fig : mwings ] , top panel ) .",
    "we interpret the maximum broadening around phase zero as a preferential fan - like view of the inner accretion curtain , when the magnetic upper pole points away from the observer .",
    "the grazing eclipse of the secondary star would not affect this broadening ( see figure  [ fig : diagram ] , top diagram ) as it will cover the lower magnetic pole only . however , the behavior of the relative flux of the broad line is not like the one we measure for the whole line ( see figure  [ fig : mod_all ] , lower panel ) . in section  [ sec : swidth ]",
    "we explained that , although the flux is modulated by the spin - cycle , there is a clear correlation when the spin and orbital phases coincide . in the case of the broad wings ,",
    "there is no correlation with the spin cycle ( not shown in the paper ) , but there is an apparent double modulation with the orbital period .",
    "we must point out again , that the individual nights show different results , again depending on the correlation between the spin and the orbital phases , shown in the right panel of figure  [ fig : mwings ] .",
    "the double modulation is clearly seen in the first night , where the spin and the orbital phases do not coincide at phase zero .",
    "however , in night two , the flux is dominated by an eclipse at phase zero , when both spin and orbital phases coincide .",
    "although there seems to be a maximum at phase 0.75 , we do not have sufficient orbital coverage on that night to claim the double modulation .",
    "where as in night three , which covers two spin cycles , there is a single modulation with a maximum at phase 0.25 and a shallow eclipse at phase zero . in night four , which also covers two spin cycles",
    ", there is only a large scatter in flux values .",
    "we also observe that the relative flux of the broad component is more sensitive to this spin - orbital correlation , than the flux observed for the whole line .",
    "we are uncertain , therefore , that the double modulation in flux is a real and stable feature .",
    "we believe that more observations are needed to confirm it .",
    "our radial velocity study agrees with the main results by @xcite , yielding similar masses for the binary .",
    "but their range in @xmath6 values implies a primary mass between 0.62 and 0.99 m@xmath10 with a most likely value of 0.78 m@xmath10 .",
    "the mass of the secondary star is obtained indirectly using an empirical zams calibration by @xcite . the fact that the masses are in agreement is due to the use of our smaller @xmath6 and to the adopted value for @xmath18 from @xcite . nevertheless , the mass result of the primary in both cases is close to 0.8 m@xmath10 , and it is also encouraging that the new cooling flow models from the x - ray emission , now agrees with this mass @xcite .",
    "the eclipses seen in the trail spectra favour the interpretation of the s - wave component as a bright emission region near the outer edge of the circulating disc as stated by @xcite .",
    "the s - wave asymmetry , noted by these authors , is seen , but only in our trail spectra 1 and 3 with a more rapid transition from blue to red .",
    "the rest show a more sinusoidal behaviour as seen in trail 4 , 5 and 6 .",
    "trail 2 has a gap between phases 0.1 and 0.3 making difficult to tell .",
    "we should note that our orbital phases are 0.1 ahead of those of @xcite due to the use of our new ephemeris .",
    "this creates only a shift and have no influence on the asymmetries or lack of them .",
    "the tail - like features below the s - wave , seen in most of our trail spectra extending to slightly higher velocities , are also observed by @xcite .",
    "they interpret these as a high velocity component caused by an overflow stream , reaching @xmath28kms@xmath4 , although , in our case , they only reach velocities up to 600kms@xmath4 . in addition , our reconstructed spectra 5 , suggest that these tails may form a second s - wave , shifted 0.5 in phase with the main s - wave , in contrast with a 0.2 shift observed in the reconstructed spectra by @xcite .",
    "the reconstructed spectra 3 and 4 show a broader s - wave , in accordance with this stream , but still with velocities no greater than 600kms@xmath4 .",
    "@xcite estimates a magnetospheric radius of about 4 white - dwarf radii ( @xmath29 ) from the eclipse timing analysis which locates the centroid of the spin - varying emission @xcite .",
    "we have to point out that the spin - varying emission does not hold in the long term ( figure  [ fig : omc ] , _ bottom _ ) .",
    "we believe that this effect and the possible sinusoidal variations with the orbital period might be due to a changing geometry of the system concerning the material locked by the magnetosphere and to the position of the hot spot .",
    "nevertheless , our h@xmath0 emission is strong in a region up to @xmath31000kms@xmath4 , and this would result in a minimum accretion disc radius of @xmath30 , while the circularisation radius for a system with @xmath31 ( * ? ? ?",
    "4 ) turns out to be @xmath32 .",
    "however , if our high velocity component comes from a region with keplerian velocity ( i.e. an inner disc component still in the orbital plane ) , then the minimum disc radius would extend only to @xmath13 .",
    "this is in accordance with the fact that ex  hya shows no polarisation , which is unlikely if the magnetosphere is to dominate the white - dwarf s roche lobe @xcite .",
    "thus , our results point ex  hya to have a small magnetosphere and being far from equilibrium .",
    "although we have here claimed that the broad component comes from a disc - like structure , why does the emission line profile have an inflection point around 1000 kms@xmath4 ? and why is this component modulated mainly by the orbital modulation and not by the spin modulation as in the case of the whole line ? does this inflection point affects our result on our calculation of the inner radius of the disk ?",
    "these are questions that need to be raised for future studies of ex  hya ; further observations are suggested to look closely at these points .",
    "1 .   our photometric observations of ex  hya show a strong modulation with the 67 min spin period and 0.4mag narrow eclipses associated with the 98 min orbital period .",
    "we have computed new ephemeris for ex  hya : @xmath33 3 .",
    "the radial velocity analysis yields a semi - amplitude @xmath34  km  s@xmath4 , both from the disc and broad components which , combined with the @xmath18 value from @xcite and an inclination angle of @xmath35 , agreed by most authors , gives a determination of @xmath9 m@xmath10 , @xmath11 m@xmath10 and @xmath12 r@xmath10 .",
    "the equivalent width of the whole line is slightly modulated with the spin period as found by previous authors .",
    "furthermore , we find that its relative flux is strongly modulated with the spin period , but their maxima and minima , depend on the alignment of the spin pole and the inferior conjunction of the secondary star",
    "the gaussian sigma of the fit of the broad component is also clearly modulated with the spin period , even more clearly than the equivalent width of the whole emission line .",
    "there is a maximum at phase 1 and a minimum at phase 0.5 .",
    "we interpret this as a fan - like view of the inner accretion curtain , when the magnetic upper pole points away from the observer .",
    "however , the relative flux of this broad component shows an apparent double modulation with the orbital period . due to the dissimilarities in the individual nights , we are uncertain that this modulation is a real and stable feature and believe that more observations are needed to confirm it . 6 .",
    "we propose that the rm - type effect is the result of the combination of the occultation of the disc velocity regions by both the hot spot and the secondary star ; an explanation which could account for the varying phase shift of the distortion .",
    "the doppler tomography reveals a well formed disc and a strong hot - spot , at times smeared .",
    "the changes in shape of the hot - spot could be due to a different combination of spin - orbital cycles .",
    "the observational analysis we have made in this paper , including the radial velocity study , the simultaneous photometry and the doppler tomography , indicate that ex  hya has a well formed disc and an inner disc region , both which shows the same radial velocity behaviour .",
    "there is also a an indication of a small contribution from the accretion curtain . from the velocity of the broad wings",
    ", we estimate that the magnetosphere should extend only to about @xmath13 .",

    "<S> , we find two important components ; one with a steep rise and velocities not larger than @xmath31000kms@xmath4and another broader component extending up to @xmath32000kms@xmath4 , which we interpret as coming mainly from the inner disc . a strong and variable hotspot is found and a stream - like structure is seen at times . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the best solution correspond to @xmath5kms@xmath4 from h@xmath0 , from the two emission components , which are both in phase with the orbital modulation . </S>",
    "<S> we remark on a peculiar effect in the radial velocity curve around phase zero , which could be interpreted as a rositter - maclaughlin - like effect , which has been taken into account before deriving @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> this value is compatible with the values found in high - resolution both in the ultraviolet and x - ray . using the published inclination angle of @xmath7 and semi - amplitude @xmath8kms@xmath4 </S>",
    "<S> , we find : @xmath9 m@xmath10 , @xmath11 m@xmath10 and @xmath12  r@xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> doppler tomography has been applied , to construct six doppler tomograms for single orbital cycles spanning the four days of observations to support our conclusions . </S>",
    "<S> our results indicate that ex  hya has a well formed disc and that the magnetosphere should extend only to about @xmath13 .    </S>",
