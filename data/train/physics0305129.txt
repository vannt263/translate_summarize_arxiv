    "the problem of coherent structures has been extensively investigated in connection with the drift wave modes in tokamak . numerical simulations and experimental observations",
    "have provided strong evidence of the presence of long - lived , cuasi - coherent structures even in deep turbulent regimes .",
    "the theoretical models ( close to similar descriptions in the physics of fluids , atmosphere and ocean ) emphasize the role of two types of nonlinearity : scalar ( or korteweg devries - type ) and vectorial ( convection of the vorticity ) .",
    "both are able to support vortical flow in a form of coherent and long lived structures .",
    "the problems of generation from initial conditions and the stability of monopolar or multipolar vortices are subjects of intense research and one of the notable result is that not all of these structures can be expected to be solitons in the sense of the inverse scattering method .",
    "usually they are called solitary waves or solitary vortices .",
    "a review , mainly oriented to plasma physics applications , has been done by horton and hasegawa @xcite .",
    "the ion drift wave equation has a distinct dynamical character according to the space - time scales involved . for shorter scales",
    "the hasegawa - mima - charney equation is obtained and the dynamics exhibits dipolar structures on the larmor radius scale . on larger scales",
    "the scalar ( or kdv - type ) nonlinearity is prevailing and the structures are monopolar",
    ". both are not solitonic but very robust and long lived . in the latter case the one - dimensional version of the equation",
    "can be reduced to the modified korteweg de vries ( mkdv ) equation @xcite and has been derived in various contexts in plasma physics .",
    "tasso @xcite  and later petviashvili @xcite have derived versions of this equations applicable to the case where there is a strong temperature gradient .",
    "it has been shown @xcite , @xcite that the equation proposed was in fact exclusively dependent of the density gradient .",
    "later the equation has been rederived along with a careful analysis of the scales involved @xcite , resolving a controversy on the role of the temperature gradient . in the study of ocean",
    "flows flierl @xcite has independently formulated an equation with the same structure .",
    "a one dimensional version of the equation has been solved by lakhin et al . on an infinite domain @xcite , obtaining as solution the kdv soliton .",
    "the two dimensional case has been examined by kadomtsev and petviashvili @xcite and by petviashvili _",
    "_ @xcite using trial functions to extremize a functional derived from the equation .",
    "the solution they found is vortical monopolar .",
    "boyd and tan @xcite have found a monopolar solution expressed as a sum of @xmath0 terms depending on the radial coordinate @xmath1 through trigonometric functions .",
    "they have also proved the non - existence of stable non - axisymmetric solutions to the stationary flierl - petviashvili equation @xcite .",
    "there is a strong connection between the stationary flierl - petviashvili equation and the zakharov - kuznetsov equation @xcite , a two - dimensional generalization of the kdv equation .",
    "this has also been investigated in refs.@xcite and @xcite where multidimensional nonlinear wave structures ( of the electrostatic drift wave branch ) in inhomogeneous plasmas were studied by combining the eigenvalue problem in inhomogeneity and the @xmath2 nonlinear vortex equation .",
    "for a two - dimensional generalization of the kdv equation numerical results are available @xcite . for shorter reference",
    "it is used also the name regularized long wave equation , rlw , since the equation proposed by peregrine @xcite can be brought to the same form .",
    "the stationary two - dimensional equation derived in the studies mentioned above has a very simple structure . and a one - dimensional solution is known , the kdv soliton",
    ". we will examine the possible extension to an analytical closed form of a two dimensional solution .",
    "we are motivated by the studies of plasma ion mode instabilities , in particular the generation of radially localised layers of sheared flow ( zonal flow ) .",
    "the ion instabilities are dominated by the nonlinearity related to the polarization drift . when the temperature gradient is very small the quasi - three dimensional geometry assumed in the derivation of the haswgawa - mima equation leads to suppression of the classical convection nonlinearity although the presence of the later can still be important in a fluctuation model .",
    "the ion polarisation drift nonlinearity may support vortical flows of which certain states are stable and coherent ( actually not solitonic ) .",
    "the derivation of a nonlinear equation in this case starts by the ion density continuity @xmath3 and assuming neutrality and adiabatic response of the particles @xmath4 the ion velocity in two dimension is @xmath5 the eqs.([icon ] ) and ( [ ivit ] ) lead to a nonlinear equation for the electrostatic potential .",
    "however , in these two equations there is still much freedom and a detailed analysis of the time and space scales leads to different particular forms of this equation .",
    "this is a multiple space and time scale analysis @xcite , @xcite , @xcite @xmath6 for @xmath7 .",
    "it is possible to change to a moving frame , by introducing a translation velocity , @xmath8 .",

    "this equation leads , after one integration over the @xmath40 coordinate , to the flierl - petviashvili equation .",
    "spatschek _ et al_. @xcite also discuss intermediate scalings , where both the scalar and the vectorial nonlinearities are present .",
    "the stability analysis implies the concept of structural stability , where the dynamics governed by one of the equations obtained above ( hasegawa - mima or scalar nonlinear ) is perturbed with a term that is of the other type .",

    "the monopolar vortices are stable and are not destroyed by collisions , however the form and the amplitides are perturbed , showing again that they are not exact solitons .",
    "in plasma physics applications , the flierl - petviashvili equation has the form @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are physical parameters , _",
    "i.e. _ functions depending on @xmath44 .",
    "this equation is obtained as the stationary version of the equation which has been expressed in the system of reference moving with the velocity @xmath8@xmath45 in the following , the coordinates @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the coordinates in the moving system .",
    "it is assumed that @xmath47 is the poloidal direction and @xmath46 is the radial direction in tokamak .    in the tokamak context",
    "the equation has been frequently simplified @xmath48 leading to @xmath49 whose solution ( lakhin _ et al_.@xcite ) is @xmath50 the dependence on @xmath46 is only parametric here , via the coefficients @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",

    "we can directly integrate the one dimensional version of the equation ( [ eqorig ] ) .",
    "actually , the solution ( [ sollakh ] ) is one of the possible solutions arising from the direct integration . for a reason that will become clear later",

    "in view of the application to the description of plasma drift wave , a two - dimensional solution would be very useful .",
    "we already dispose of the one - parameter family of solutions with geometry of fronts , which has been obtained by simply translating a one - dimensional solution along the transversal direction .",
    "we examine a class of solutions that can be seen  as an extension from the one - dimensional ones . we propose a more systematic approach of construction that makes more explicit the nature of the restriction leading to this quasi - one dimensional geometry .",

    "we will use the following relation @xmath75 and the expression of the @xmath76 function as a series using its pole singularities .",
    "then we obtain @xmath77    we are looking for solutions @xmath78 of the @xmath2 equation and we try to build them from the motion of the pole singularities of the one - dimensional solution .",
    "more specifically , we will make an ansatz for the form of the @xmath2 solution based on a particular choice of poles in the complex @xmath47 plane , as suggested by eq.([sech2 ] ) .",
    "we will assume that the poles have positions that depend on the other coordinate , @xmath46 .",
    "imposing that the function constructed in this way verifies the equation we obtain a set of differential equations and constraint conditions for the positions of the poles in the complex @xmath47 plane .",
    "the poles evolve with @xmath46 as time - like variable .",
