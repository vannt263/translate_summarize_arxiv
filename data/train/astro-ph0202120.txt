    "the penubra is the least understood structure of sunspots . although known from the time of galileo (; ) , its radial filamentary structure was first recognized with the large telescopes of the @xmath0  century @xcite .",
    "the first good - quality photographs of the sub - arcsecond penumbral fibrils were made with stratoscope i in 1957 @xcite .",
    "today speckle - restored observations allow to study penumbral details with ground - based telescopes too ( , ) .",
    "real understanding of the physical processes in sunspots began in 1908 , when hale observed strong magnetic fields in them @xcite .",
    "after almost a century , the physics of the sunspot umbra is more or less clear , but the processes occurring in the penumbra even in a regular round sunspot are not fully understood yet @xcite . in the umbra",
    "the strong , almost vertical magnetic field suppresses the convection , thereby reducing the energy reaching the photosphere , so the temperature and brightness is reduced in these places .",
    "unanswered questions are in the remaining umbral structure and in the continuation below the surface .",
    "recently helioseismology gives the possibility to investigate the subsurface structure and dynamics of sunspots ( e.g. ; ) , but the spatial and temporal resolution of these measurements is fairly low yet .    the penumbra is entirely different , in it the magnetic field may be even horizontal ( the polarity dividing line between umbrae of different polarities in sunspot groups often lies in the penumbra ) , but in most places the field is inclined considerably to the surface . as the photospheric plasma must obey the frozen - in condition of magnetohydrodynamics ,",
    "the penumbral filaments must be aligned along the magnetic field , but at the same time the surface of the penumbra has only an insignificant tilt to the horizontal .",
    "so the penumbral structural elements lie in vertical planes , defined by the horizontal component of the magnetic field @xcite",
    ". the absolute value of the magnetic field does not change significantly between bright and dark fibrils , but the inclination to the surface is definitely smaller in the dark elements (; ) .",
    "earlier , low - resolution observations found horizontal field at the penumbra - photosphere boundary @xcite , but the latest measurements show , that both the inclination and the magnetic field value is different from zero at this boundary (; ; and references therein ; ; ) .",
    "recently the fine structure of the penumbral magnetic and velocity fields was investigated in several papers , using new observational and reduction methods (;",
    ", @xcite ; ; , @xcite ) .",
    "these are aimed at understanding the structure and physical processes in the penumbra , but the more general question , namely what physical quantity determines the structural boundary between the photosphere and the penumbra , is also of considerable interest .",
    "the data mentioned above were obtained mostly for regular , round sunspots , because their structure was supposed symmetrical and so can be described more easily .",
    "however investigation of the interdependence of penumbral structure and magnetic field is interesting also in complex sunspot groups for clarifying the processes shaping the penumbra .",
    "this paper describes the behavior of the magnetic field vector on the penumbra  photosphere boundary . in section 2",
    "the observations and results are presented , in section 3 these results are discussed in connection with other data from the literature , finally in section 4 the conclusions are drawn .",
    "for the study of the magnetic field at the penumbra  photosphere boundary four vector magnetograms of the sunspot group noaa 6555 were selected , together with photographic observations of this group .",
    "magnetograms were obtained by the nasa marshall space flight center ( msfc ) vector - magnetograph @xcite .",
    "photoheliograms were taken from the debrecen heliophysical observatory archives , they were acquired at its gyula observing station @xcite , and were selected according to their quality and near - simultaneity with the magnetograms .",
    "figure 1 displays the photoheliograms for 4 consecutive days in march , 1991 , together with the longitudinal ( line - of - sight ) magnetic field component and with maps of the absolute value of the magnetic field .",
    "the longitudinal magnetograms demonstrate , that noaa 6555 was a magnetically complex spotgroup , with interesting sunspot proper motions and flare activity @xcite , consisting of an old , multiple - umbra following polarity spot . newly emerging umbrae moved around this spot from both sides , causing some large flares in this interaction @xcite .",
    "a color variant of figure 1 , allowing a better comparison of the photospheric image and the magnetic field strength , and a movie of the proper motions and spot evolution in this active region is included in the cd - rom supplement , or can be downloaded from the url http://fenyi.sci.klte.hu/@xmath1kalman / penumbra/.        on figure 1 we can see the complex magnetic structure of the active region , longitudinal magnetic field maps show different polarities in the same penumbra . on the other hand , on the magnetic field",
    "absolute value maps the outer boundary of the penumbra closely follows the 0.075 t ( 750 gauss ) isoline .",
    "this correspondence is well visible in the process of evolution of the sunspot group , as the penumbra and the total field maps evolve similarly ( see the places marked by arrows on figure 1 ) . as the resolution of the magnetograms is lower , than that of the photographs , the 0.05  0.1 t band of the absolute value of the magnetic field is indicated on figure 1 .",
    "large gradients of often opposite polarity fields paired with the low resolution of the magnetogram can shift the isogauss line a little , but there is a good overall correspondence between the outer boundary of the penumbra and the isogausses of the absolute value of the magnetic field .",
    "especially good example is the p- ( white ) polarity umbra , emerging right at the southeast border of the multiple f - polarity umbra on march 23 , and gradually detaching from the common penumbra to march 26 .",
    "the isogausses in the right column of figure 1 follow this evolution .",
    "earlier observations already reported field strength values of about 0.075  0.080 t at the outer boundary of round sunspots ( e.g. ; ) . such an almost constant value of field strength at the outer boundary of the penumbra can be observed also for complex sunspot groups , as shown on figure 1 .",
    "the observed constancy of the absolute value of the magnetic field on the penumbral outer boundary was already mentioned earlier @xcite , but without interpretation .",
    "the same is true for the recent , high - resolution measurements . on figure 3 . of the penumbral values of the magnetic field strength @xmath2 _ * b * _ @xmath2 are all above @xmath10.08 t. find 0.050.1 t on the penumbra - photosphere boundary , increasing with height .",
    "this supports the results of radio observations ( see below ) , but their analysis can be influenced by the fine structure of the magnetic and velocity fields @xcite .",
    "the value of 0.075 t is approximately equal to the equipartition field value in the photosphere (; ) , corresponding to the energy of turbulent convective motions .",
    "the exact value of the equipartition field depends on the depth and the model of the convective zone , also the calibration of vector - magnetographs is a difficult problem and model - dependent .",
    "whether the magnetic field falls abruptly to zero at the boundary or continues to the nearby photosphere , can not be decided at this resolution of magnetic measurements , but the change is steep , and magnetic energy , being proportional to the square of the field strength , changes even quicker ( , @xcite ) .",
    "another proof of the controlling influence of the total magnetic field value can be found from radio observations .",
    "gyroresonance emission depends on the absolute value of the magnetic field in the solar corona above sunspots . in a series of vla observations at 1991",
    "may 7 of noaa 6615 active region @xcite , shown on figure 2 , the 5 ghz and 8.4 ghz contours , corresponding to 0.045 t and 0.075 t , respectively , follow nicely the outline of the penumbra of this complex and compact sunspot group , whereas the 15 ghz emission ( 0.135 t ) is observed mainly above umbrae ( and in the middle of the group above the neutral line in a @xmath3-configuration , which leads to stronger coronal activity ) .",
    "substantial amount of magnetic flux , and even more heat flux leaves the sunspot through the penumbra , so it needs lateral energy flow from the surroundings .",
    "this is possible through interchange convection (; ; ) , in which magnetic fluxtubes , or sheets are heated at the outer boundary of the spot ( the magnetopause ) , then moving upwards and inwards in a vertical plane they supply energy to the penumbra , whereas cooler material flows downwards and outwards .",
    "observations support this model : penumbral filaments lie in vertical planes , defined by the horizontal component of the magnetic field @xcite , inclination ( but not strength ) of the field varies in bright and dark filaments (; ) .",
    "soho mdi measurements @xcite show enhanced power of intensity oscillations in the range 0.51.0 mhz ( 16.733.3 min period ) in a ring with filamentary structure right at the penumbra - photosphere boundary , and magnetic field strength oscillations also in this period range show filamentary structure in the penumbra , just as it should be for the interchange convection ( figure 3 ) .    the thick penumbra model ( , ) supposes , that from some depth to the surface the the magnetopause ( penumbra - photosphere boundary ) transmits some energy from the surrounding convective zone , and this energy is distributed in the penumbra by the interchange convection .",
    "this model uses the monolithic sunspot convention , i.e. the magnetic field of the sunspot is represented by a single fluxtube of varying cross - section from the surface to the depth of 15 - 20 mm .",
    "the depth of the penumbra is supposed to be about 4 - 5 mm .",
    "recent results @xcite seem to contradict the monolithic sunspot model , showing strong transverse flows at depth @xmath45 mm .",
    "it is instructive to follow the change of the equipartition magnetic field value with depth , and compare with the magnetic field at the magnetopause .",
    "figure 4 shows such a comparison , where the equipartition field values were computed from the energy density of the convective motions ( r. stein , private communication ) in a 9 mm deep simulation of the convective zone @xcite , the magnetic field value at the magnetopause is extrapolated down from the surface value , scaled according to the the cross - section of the model of jahn and schmidt . the two curves intersect at the depth of about 6 mm , which indicates a change of the type of interaction at this depth .",
    "this gives a natural explanation of the depth of the thick penumbra model : above 6 mm the energy , carried by convective motions , can partly penetrate through the magnetopause .",
    "the controversy between the monolithic and the cluster model @xcite can be resolved , if a change of type with the evolution of the sunspot is supposed ( kalman , in preparation ) : younger sunspots at emergence have deep connections , which is severed later by the turbulent convection below 6 mm .",
    "stable and decaying sunspots are shallow , and are hold together by their moat cell (; ) until the convection finally erodes their magnetic field concentration .",
    "observations show , that the outer boundary of the sunspot penumbra even in complex active regions follows the isogauss line of the total magnetic field corresponding approximately to the equipartition field value at the surface ( figure 1 ) .",
    "the observations also support the thick penumbra model with interchange convection @xcite , the change of the ratio of the equipartition field value and the field value at the magnetopause boundary with depth gives a natural depth of the penumbra about 56 mm .",
    "the magnetic field in the penumbra is not strong enough to stop the convection , but severely alters its nature , leading to formation of interchange convection .",
    "the enigmatic penumbra at last seems to be understandable .",
