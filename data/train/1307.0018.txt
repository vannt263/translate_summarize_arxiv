    "under newtonian dynamics , the escape velocity is related to the gravitational potential of the system , @xmath9 if the dynamics of the system are controlled by the gravitational potential , tracers which can not escape the potential exist in a well - defined region of radius / velocity ( @xmath10 ) phase space .",
    "the extrema of the velocities in this phase space define a surface , the escape velocity profile , @xmath11 , which can be observed in projected sky coordinates .",
    "given the observed @xmath11 , this `` caustic '' technique allows one to infer the mass profile of a cluster to well beyond the virial radius @xcite .    with the latest deployments of wide - field ground - based multi - object spectrographs like vimos on the vlt @xcite ; imacs on magellan @xcite ; hectospec on the mmt we are beginning to see large spectroscopic follow - up data sets of galaxy clusters . as a consequence ,",
    "the caustic technique has become more widely adopted .",
    "@xcite compare caustic to weak lensing mass profiles and find agreement to within @xmath12 around a virial radius .",
    "@xcite perform a dynamical study of the cluster a1689 and find good agreement between the caustic mass profiles and both the weak lensing and x - ray inferred mass profiles .",
    "@xcite measure the caustic mass profiles to large radii to estimate the ultimate halo mass in clusters , which includes all mass bound to halos in a future @xmath13cdm universe .",
    "@xcite utilize caustic masses to help calibrate the @xmath14-richness relation alongside mass estimates from velocity dispersion scaling relations .",
    "new deep imaging surveys like clash on the hubble space telescope have been awarded a significant amount of very large telescope ( vlt ) time to collect spectroscopy , in part to study the dynamical and caustic masses of clusters @xcite .",
    "and of course there are a variety of planned large - scale spectroscopy programs both from the ground ( bigboss ) and space ( euclid ) .",
    "these future efforts could enable caustic masses to be measured for many thousands of galaxy clusters .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter gmk ) used the millennium simulation @xcite to show that cluster - sized caustic masses within a projected @xmath15 ( the radius which contains 200 times the critical density ) are more precise and more accurate than virial masses measured from their projected velocity dispersions .",
    "however , the implementation of the escape velocity technique employs a number of steps which result in masses that are calibrated to the n - body simulation .",
    "cluster masses based on the traditional caustic technique vary by 30% depending on which calibration is used @xcite . in this paper , we clarify where these calibrations are incorporated into the theory and we assess their validity and impact on the inferred masses .",
    "we also present a variation on the original escape velocity caustic technique which eliminates the calibration .",
    "consider a mass distribution described by an nfw profile such that the mass density @xmath16 and the potential @xmath17 radial profiles are : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the normalization and @xmath20 is the nfw scale radius @xcite .",
    "this is an example of a density - potential _ pair _ which share the same values for the shape parameters @xmath19 and @xmath20 and are related via the poisson equation , @xmath21 .",
    "we can write the nfw - inferred spherical mass differential as : @xmath22 where the unknowns are the gravitational potential @xmath23 and the scale @xmath20 .",
    "this is a key step in our escape velocity technique , where we have equated the parameter @xmath19 in equations [ eq : nfw_rhopot ] .",
    "the nfw parameter @xmath19 sets the absolute scale for the mass density .",
    "the other nfw parameter @xmath20 defines the scale radius and is observable in projected data , assuming light traces mass .",
    "we use equation [ eq : escape ] to re - write equation [ eq : m_caus_diaferio ] as : @xmath24 where @xmath25 where the unknowns are the scale radius @xmath20 and the escape velocity @xmath26 , which is measured from the extrema in the radius and velocity ( @xmath10 ) phase - space data .",
    "more precisely , our estimate @xmath27 should actually be : @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are are the spherically averaged density and potential profiles ( see @xcite or ) .",
    "the difference between @xmath31 and @xmath27 is that the former uses an exact profile for the densities and the potentials , while the latter assumes that only the density profile can be measured and that the potential has the same nfw shape parameters ( i.e. , concentration and scale ) as the potential .",
    "we discuss whether or not this nfw - shape assumption holds in section [ sec : nfw_shapes ] .    in projected data , we measure the velocities along the line - of - sight ( l.o.s . ) , and so @xmath32 where the @xmath8 is the standard velocity anisotropy parameter .    in the classical implementation of the caustic technique",
    ", the average @xmath33 is measured within n - body simulations , and then applied to real data @xcite . in the literature , @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "since @xmath35 enters into the equation as being directly proportional to the mass , we must know it to high accuracy if escape velocity masses are to be used in cosmological analyses .",
    "a goal of this paper is to drop the requirement that @xmath35 be calibrated from simulations .",
    "we assume that clusters are nfw density - potential _ pairs _ and apply equation [ eq : m_caustic_nfw ] directly .",
    "the unknowns , @xmath20 and @xmath36 and @xmath8 are constrained from observed data @xcite .",
    "a final calibration in standard escape - velocity technique is that of the iso - density surface in @xmath10 space which defines the average escape velocity , @xmath37 .",
    "the density - weighted average escape velocity inside radius @xmath38 is : @xmath39 where we have used equation [ eq : escape ] .",
    "the integral in the numerator on the right - hand side of equation [ eq : avg_esc1 ] is twice the total potential energy of the system or @xmath40 @xcite , which leads to : @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the total potential energy and mass of the system within the radius @xmath38 .",
    "one often defines the following relation between the fraction of the total kinetic over the potential energy to that expected from a virialized halo : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the total kinetic energy .",
    "if we express the total kinetic energy of the system as @xmath46 equation [ eq : avg_esc2 ] becomes : @xmath47 where the average quantities are measured within the same radius , @xmath38 .",
    "the standard calibration assumes that @xmath48 in a virialized and isolated halo such that @xmath49 .",
    "thus @xmath50 , such that the escape velocity phase - space surface is calibrated through a measurement of the velocity dispersion .    in this section",
    ", we have clarified where the calibration steps enter into the standard caustic analysis .",
    "the calibration includes the term @xmath35 , which is directly proportional to the estimate of the mass .",
    "this term comprises two parts : @xmath31 in equation [ eq : f_r ] and @xmath51 in equation [ eq : v_proj ] .",
    "the other calibration step occurs from @xmath52 in equation [ eq : vesc_sigma ] , which decides the iso - density contour in the @xmath10 phase - space that defines the escape velocity .",
    "we have also presented a derivation of the caustic technique which does not require a calibration of @xmath35 , but which assumes an nfw density - potential pair and uses the observables in equation [ eq : m_caustic_nfw ] .",
    "we apply the caustic technique to 100 millennium halos with masses @xmath53m@xmath3h@xmath4 and @xmath54 where @xmath55/100 km s@xmath4mpc@xmath4 . in 3d",
    "we use the particle positions and velocities . in the projected analyses we use the @xcite semi - analytic galaxies within 30h@xmath4mpc of the halo centers projected along a random line - of - sight .",
    "these volumes are large enough to incorporate realistic projection effects .",
    "the limits on the projected phase - space velocities are @xmath56km / s relative to the halo velocity centroids , whereas the typical escape velocities are @xmath57km / s .      in order to drop the n - body calibration of @xmath35",
    ", we assume that the nfw densities and potentials have the same parameters .",
    "this is expected if the matter distribution is concentric with the iso - potential surfaces ( e.g. , as in spherical symmetry ; see also the classical potential solutions for homogeneous density distributions in @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "however , @xcite provide exact closed - form newtonian potential solutions to an infinite family of heterogeneous spheroids and find that the densities are generally not constant on the iso - potential bounding surfaces . in other words , while both the potential and density distribution could have the same general functional form like an nfw , they need not have identical shape parameters .",
    "we compare the nfw density / potential shapes by first fitting the nfw density profile and determining @xmath19 and @xmath20 for each halo .",
    "the gravitational potentials are measured exactly through summation of @xmath58 and then fit with an nfw using @xmath19 measured from the density , but allowing the potential scale parameter @xmath20 to be a free parameter .    in figure",
    "[ fig : r_0_compare ] , we compare the nfw concentrations @xmath59 , where @xmath15 is the radius which contains a density corresponding to 200@xmath60 the critical density .",
    "we find that the potentials have slightly higher concentrations than the densities .",
    "this difference suggests that our systems are not density - potential pairs which are simply related via spherical solutions to the poisson equation .",
    "because of this , we expect that using equation [ eq : m_caustic_nfw ] will return an incorrect mass estimate due to its assumption of shape similarity in the density and potential profiles .    in figure",
    "[ fig : m_v_m ] we compare the 3d escape velocity masses with halo masses within @xmath15 ( @xmath14 ) . in the top left panel",
    ", we use the exact densities and potentials as measured using the particles ( e.g. , equation [ eq : f_r ] ) .",
    "these caustic mass estimates are nearly unbiased with a scatter of @xmath61 . in the top right panel of figure [ fig : m_v_m ]",
    "we utilize equation [ eq : m_caustic_nfw ] , where only the density profile is used to fit the 3d nfw concentrations and their errors .",
    "as expected from figure [ fig : r_0_compare ] the nfw - inferred 3d caustic masses are biased low by @xmath5 10% .",
    "the scatter is 8% .",
    "the errors on this panel use a conservative uncertainty in @xmath62 50% .",
    "a large uncertainty in the concentration has little effect on the scatter of the actual caustic mass estimate .",
    "this will become important when we discuss realistic observational biases and scatters in section 3.3 .",
    "it has been shown that the virial relation @xmath49 is often not met in simulated halos @xcite .",
    "this does not mean that the system is not virialized , but simply that more terms from the tensor virial equation are required , usually in a surface pressure kinetic term .",
    "so the question then is at what radius to we begin to see a bias expected from equation [ eq : vesc_sigma ] when @xmath63 ?    to test this , we measure the exact ( unbiased ) caustic masses using @xmath64 at 1 , 0.9 , 0.7 , and 0.5 @xmath60 the virial radius .",
    "we detect no appreciable bias until we reach half a virial radius where the masses become biased low by 10% .",
    "we calculate @xmath65 for particles within this radius .",
    "we then apply @xmath65 during the virial calibration stage of the caustic technique and find no mass bias .",
    "@xcite conduct a similar test , but against various fractions of their membership radius r@xmath66 , as opposed to an intrinsic cluster property like r@xmath67 .",
    "they find that there is a preferred radius of of 0.7@xmath60r@xmath66 .",
    "we come to a slightly different conclusion : that the choice of radius does not matter , so long as the correct @xmath52 is used .",
    "we also find that there is no bias when caustic masses are calibrated using data within @xmath68 .      when the data are projected along the line - of - sight , velocity anisotropies in the orbits of the galaxies must be taken into account @xcite . in the bottom left panel of figure [ fig : m_v_m ]",
    ", we use @xmath69 which is the exact @xmath31 profile multiplied by the exact @xmath70 profile . the increase in the scatter from the 3d",
    "( @xmath5 10% ) case to the line - of - sight ( @xmath5 25% ) case is identical to what was measured in , who use the classical caustic technique and a constant @xmath35 .",
    "therefore , for any given cluster , there is no gain in accuracy or precision in the estimated caustic masses by measuring a @xmath70 profile for each cluster .",
    "the scatter is dominated by line - of - sight variations in the projected velocity dispersion ( see also ) .",
    "we show our most realistic comparison of the caustic masses to @xmath14 in the bottom - right panel of figure [ fig : m_v_m ] . here",
    "we drop explicit knowledge of the concentrations and apply the ensemble average @xmath71 for every halo in @xmath27 ( see figure [ fig : r_0_compare ] ) .",
    "we also drop explicit knowledge of the anisotropy profile and instead use @xmath72 which is the average @xmath8 for these halos . using these estimates , we find that the scatter is only slightly higher than in figure [ fig : m_v_m ] ( bottom left ) .",
    "large uncertainties in the average anisotropy and concentrations do not appreciably add scatter to what is already there from the line - of - sight projection .",
    "the bias in figure [ fig : m_v_m ] bottom - right is caused by the faulty assumption that the halos have the same nfw density and potential concentrations ( see figure [ fig : r_0_compare ] ) .",
    "systematic errors in the observable ensemble averages for the concentrations and the velocity anisotropies do impart mass biases . when we impose @xmath73 the average bias changes from -10% to -18% while @xmath74 results in an average mass bias of + 5% . when we impose @xmath75 the bias changes from -8% to -13% while @xmath76 results in a mass bias of -7% .",
    "these average concentration values cover the full range of observational estimates in the literature @xcite .",
    "one goal for this _ letter _ was to test the fundamental statistical and systematic precision of the escape velocity ( or caustic ) technique to measure masses of cluster - sized halos in n - body simulations . given the 3d data , caustic masses are unbiased with 10 - 15% precision ( similar or better to the virial scaling relation of @xcite .",
    "the scatter increases to 25% as a result of line - of - sight projections .    our second goal was to re - frame the theory in terms of observable quantities and remove calibrations to n - body simulations .",
    "we utilized the weak assumption that the observed density and potential profiles can be described by an nfw with the same shape parameters , specifically the scale parameter @xmath20 .",
    "we find that this latter assumption does not hold in the millennium simulation data , and the inferred cluster masses are biased low by @xmath5 10% .",
    "the virial calibration can also contribute to biases in the caustic masses when the velocity dispersion is averaged over a radius where the total binding energy is not represented by virial expectations .",
    "we show that large uncertainties in the ensemble average of the velocity anisotropies and concentrations do not contribute significantly to the intrinsic line - of - sight scatter in projected caustic masses .",
    "however , large ( e.g. 100% ) systematic errors in the average velocity anisotropies and concentrations can lead to additional 5 - 10% biases in the caustic masses .",
    "the authors made use of the flux high performance computing cluster at the university of michigan .",
    "the millennium simulation databases used in this paper and the web application providing online access to them were constructed as part of the activities of the german astrophysical virtual observatory ( gavo ) .",
