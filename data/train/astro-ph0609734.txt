    "an important question that should be addressed by successful models of reionization concerns whether overdense or underdense regions become ionized first . in regions that are overdense , galaxies will be over - abundant for two reasons ; first because there is more material per unit volume to make galaxies , and second because small - scale fluctuations need to be of lower amplitude to form a galaxy when embedded in a larger - scale overdensity ( the so - called _ galaxy bias _ ; see mo & white  1996 ) . regarding reionization of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) , the first effect will be compensated by the increased density of gas to be ionized .",
    "furthermore , the increase in the recombination rate in overdense regions will be counteracted by the galaxy bias in overdense regions .",
    "however the latter effects need not cancel , and could either lead to enhanced or delayed reionization in overdense regions .",
    "the process of reionization also contains several layers of feedback .",
    "radiative feedback heats the igm and results in the suppression of low - mass galaxy formation ( efstathiou , 1992 ; thoul & weinberg  1996 ; quinn et al .  1996 ;",
    "dijkstra et al .",
    "this delays the completion of reionization by lowering the local star formation rate , but the effect is counteracted in overdense regions by the biased formation of massive galaxies .",
    "the radiation feedback may therefore be more important in low - density regions where small galaxies contribute more significantly to the ionizing flux .",
    "in this paper we use a simple model to evaluate the relative significance of the above effects and compute the correlation between the local overdensity and quantities such as the hydrogen neutral - fraction , the brightness temperature of redshifted 21 cm emission , and the overdensity of massive galaxies .",
    "in particular , we evaluate the prospects for finding whether reionization is enhanced or suppressed in overdense regions based on the combination of high redshift galaxy surveys and redshifted 21 cm surveys .    for illustration",
    ", the problem may be parameterised by relating the neutral fraction [ @xmath1 in regions of linear overdensity @xmath2 ( smoothed over spheres of large radius @xmath3 ) , to the average neutral fraction ( @xmath4 ) using a power - law with index @xmath5 @xmath6,\\ ] ] where we assume @xmath7 .",
    "the resulting deviation in the brightness temperature of a region of overdensity @xmath2 at @xmath8 is @xmath9,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have assumed hydrogen in the igm to have a spin temperature well in excess of the cmb temperature . in equation  ( [ temp ] ) the pre - factor of 4/3 on the overdensity refers to the spherically averaged enhancement of the brightness temperature due to peculiar velocities in overdense regions ( bharadwaj & ali 2005 ; barkana & loeb 2005 ) . in a state where the ionization fraction in the igm is independent of density ,",
    "the value of the index is @xmath10 for all scales .",
    "if @xmath11 , then ionization is enhanced in overdense regions .",
    "conversely , reionization is suppressed in overdense regions if @xmath12 .",
    "high redshift galaxies are preferentially located in large - scale regions with @xmath13 .",
    "the departure of the mean 21 cm brightness temperature in these regions from the average igm provides the opportunity to measure the value of @xmath14 , and hence to determine whether overdense or underdense regions were reionized first . in  2 we describe a simple model that predicts @xmath11 .",
    "regions of higher density should therefore be more ionized and possess reduced levels of fluctuations in redshifted 21 cm emission .",
    "we later describe how the dependence of 21 cm emission on overdensity could be extracted based on the fact that more massive galaxies populate higher density regions . throughout the paper",
    "we adopt the set of cosmological parameters determined by _ wmap _ ( spergel et al .",
    "2006 ) for a flat @xmath15cdm universe .",
    "the evolution of the ionization fraction by mass @xmath16 of a particular region of scale @xmath3 with overdensity @xmath2 ( at observed redshift @xmath17 ) may be written as ( wyithe & loeb 2003 ) @xmath18\\\\ & -&\\alpha_{\\rm b}cn_{\\rm h}^0\\left(1+\\delta\\frac{d(z)}{d(z_{\\rm obs})}\\right ) \\left(1+z\\right)^3q_{\\delta , r},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the number of photons entering the igm per baryon in galaxies , @xmath20 is the case - b recombination co - efficient , @xmath21 is the clumping factor ( which we assume , for simplicity , to be constant ) , and @xmath22 is the growth factor between redshift @xmath23 and the present time .",
    "the production rate of ionizing photons in neutral regions is assumed to be proportional to the collapsed fraction @xmath24 of mass in halos above the minimum threshold mass for star formation ( @xmath25 ) , while in ionized regions the minimum halo mass is limited by the jeans mass in an ionized igm ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "we assume @xmath25 to correspond to a virial temperature of @xmath27k , representing the hydrogen cooling threshold , and @xmath26 to correspond to a virial temperature of @xmath28k , representing the mass below which infall is suppressed from an ionized igm ( dijkstra et al .",

    "the details of the galaxy bias and radiative feedback must be incorporated in order to compute how @xmath24 and @xmath21 vary with @xmath2 . before proceeding",
    ", we stress that this model is intended to be illustrative only .",
    "while semi - analytic models can offer a picture of the global properties of reionization , the detailed processes must be modeled numerically using cosmological simulations ( e.g. zahn et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "equation  ( [ history ] ) may be integrated as a function of @xmath2 at the observed redshift . as an example , we find the value of @xmath19 that yields overlap of ionized regions at the mean density igm by @xmath38 ( white et al .",
    "we then use the model to compute the filling fraction of ionized regions at @xmath39 ( corresponding to the redshift of ly@xmath0 galaxy surveys discussed in the next section ) and at a higher redshift of @xmath40 .",
    "the results are shown in the left panels of figure  [ fig1 ] , where fluctuations in neutral fraction [ @xmath41 are plotted versus @xmath2 .",
    "results are shown assuming clumping factors of @xmath42 ( solid lines ) , @xmath43 ( dot - dashed lines ) , and @xmath44 ( dashed lines ) . here",
    "the overdensities correspond to length scales in the igm that are significantly in excess of the length scale corresponding to the minimum mass ( i.e. figure  [ fig1 ] represents scales where @xmath45 ^ 2-[\\sigma(r)]^2\\approx \\sigma_{\\rm min}^2)$ ] .",
    "therefore while figure  [ fig1 ] shows dependencies out to values of @xmath46 , such overdensities are rare on these large scales .",
    "we find that overdense regions are more highly ionized than underdense regions , implying that the bias of massive galaxies in overdense regions dominates over the increased recombination rate there .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows that fluctuations in the neutral fraction at a fixed overdensity ( as measured at an observed redshift @xmath17 ) are smaller at earlier times .",
    "the reason is simply that the neutral fraction is larger at earlier times , so that fluctuations in ionization fraction result in smaller relative fluctuations in neutral fraction .",
    "the left panels of figure  [ fig1 ] also show three lines of slope @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 . from comparison of these lines with our model prediction",
    ", we find that the value of @xmath14 in equations  ( [ neut ] ) and ( [ temp ] ) is around @xmath50 at @xmath40 ( for @xmath42 ) , and is significantly steeper at lower redshifts or lower clumping factors .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] suggests that a sufficiently large clumping factor would result in an ionization fraction that was lower in overdense relative to underdense regions .    on the right hand panels of figure  [ fig1 ] we plot the variation of",
    "predicted 21 cm brightness temperature ( @xmath51 ) with overdensity .",
    "results are again shown assuming clumping factors of @xmath42 ( solid lines ) , @xmath43 ( dot - dashed lines ) and @xmath44 ( dashed lines ) .",
    "for comparison , the three lines show equation  ( [ temp ] ) with values of @xmath52 , -1.5 and -2.5 . at positive overdensities , we find a reduced neutral fraction . however in these regions ,",
    "the neutral hydrogen present is at an increased overdensity .",
    "the brightness temperature of an overdense region is therefore reduced relative to the average by increased ionization , but increased relative to average by the higher gas density .",
    "conversely the brightness temperature of an underdense region is increased relative to the average by reduced ionization , but decreased relative to average by the lower gas density . at large redshifts and/or clumping factor , we find that the sum of these effects results in a non - monotonic dependence of @xmath51 on @xmath2 , with brightness temperature peaking near @xmath53 .",
    "on co - moving scales ( @xmath3 ) sufficiently large that the variance in the density field remains in the linear regime , we are able to compute the auto - correlation function [ @xmath54 of brightness temperature smoothed with top - hat windows of angular radius @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the angular diameter distance : @xmath57^{\\frac{1}{2}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 and @xmath33 is the variance of the density field ( at redshift @xmath23 ) smoothed on a scale @xmath3 .",
    "the resulting auto - correlation functions are shown in figure  [ fig2 ] assuming clumping factors of @xmath42 ( left ) and @xmath43 ( right ) .",
    "the four curves correspond to redshifts of @xmath59 , 7 , 8 and 10 , and demonstrate ( in the case of @xmath42 ) that the amplitude of the auto - correlation function need not vary monotonically with redshift ( or average neutral fraction ) .",
    "we would like to determine whether the distribution of high redshift galaxies can be combined with redshifted 21 cm maps to probe the correlations between the redshifted 21 cm emission and galaxies , and hence between the ionization fraction and the large - scale overdensity .",
    "we concentrate on the case of ly@xmath0 emitting galaxies . in order to estimate the bias of ly@xmath0 emitting galaxies relative to the underlying density field , we first compare the observed abundance of ly@xmath0 emitters to a simple model in order to estimate their galaxy mass .    in the subaru deep field ( sdf ) kashikawa et al .",

    "we expect a transmission of order unity ( dijkstra & wyithe  2006 ) .",
    "these values are unexpectedly high , however the model is degenerate over a wide range of parameter values . the best fit model is plotted over the data in the left panel of figure  [ fig3 ] .",
    "we are interested in the mass of ly@xmath0 emitters . in the right hand panel",
    "we show lines of constant mass corresponding to the lowest luminosity ( @xmath64erg / s ) bin .",
    "the long and short dashed lines represent masses of @xmath83 and @xmath84 respectively . based on these results",
    "we conclude that the halo masses of ly@xmath0 emitters in the sdf are larger than @xmath85 . in the remainder of this paper",
    "we show 21cm - galaxy correlations for both @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "next we discuss the cross - correlation between the number density of massive galaxies with 21 cm emission .",
    "the observed overdensity of galaxies is simply @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the galaxy bias , and the pre - factor of 4/3 arises from a spherical average over the infall peculiar velocities ( kaiser 1987 ) .",
    "the value of bias @xmath88 for a halo mass @xmath70 may be approximated using the press - schechter formalism ( mo & white  1996 ) , modified to include non - spherical collapse ( sheth , mo & tormen  2001 ) @xmath89,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 . here",

    "this expression yields an accurate approximation to the halo bias determined from n - body simulations ( sheth , mo & tormen  2001 ) .    in the left - hand panels of figure  [ fig4 ] we plot 21 cm brightness temperature as a function of @xmath96 .",
    "results are shown for two values of galaxy mass , @xmath83 ( solid line ) and @xmath84 ( dashed line ) assuming @xmath42 .",
    "we also show results for @xmath83 assuming @xmath43 ( dot - dashed line ) .",
    "the upper row of figure  [ fig4 ] shows results for @xmath39 , and the lower row for @xmath40 .",
    "the properties of the galaxy population correlate with the level of redshifted 21 cm emission .",
    "these properties depend on the overdensity of the igm whose typical fluctuation level is a function of scale . as a result",
    "the amplitude of the correlation between galaxy overdensity and 21 cm emission will therefore also be dependent on angular scale . in the right panels of figure  [ fig4 ]",
    "we plot the cross - correlation function @xmath97 for the igm smoothed on various angular scales , @xmath98 .",

    ". since in these cases we find the brightness temperature to be lower in over - dense regions , we also find that massive galaxies correlate negatively with 21 cm brightness temperature .",
    "the variance is lower on larger scales , and so the amplitude of the correlation is reduced .",
    "the results shown in figures  [ fig1 ] , [ fig2 ] and [ fig4 ] are sensitive to the value of clumping factor .",
    "weaker clumping leads to greater ionization in overdense regions , and hence a larger variation of ionization fraction with overdensity .",
    "this in turn leads to increases in the amplitudes of the auto - correlation and cross - correlation functions .    on scales of @xmath102",
    "the typical fluctuation in units of 1mk multiplied by the typical overdensity of galaxies is of order unity . in the next section",
    "we demonstrate that the brightness temperature around ly@xmath0 emitters at @xmath38 should be sufficiently different from the average value to be detectable by the first generation of redshifted 21 cm surveys .",
    "the correlation between massive galaxies ( which probe dense regions ) and the 21 cm signal ( which traces the geometry of the neutral gas ) will offer a direct probe of the process of reionization .",
    "the results of   [ lymass ] and   [ crosscorr ] suggest that ly@xmath0 emitters reside in massive galaxies at high redshift , and that overdensities in the number counts of these galaxies trace the more highly ionized regions .",
    "observationally , ly@xmath0 surveys may provide the most straightforward comparison with 21 cm maps for several reasons which we outline below . as a concrete example we consider the case of the subaru deep field and its comparison with an mwa - lfd ( _ mileura wide field array - low frequency demonstrator _ ) field .",
    "we can estimate the sizes of fluctuations needed for detection by considering the uncertainty in the 21 cm brightness averaged over synthesised beams which do or do - not contain ly@xmath0 emitting galaxies .",
    "radio telescopes measure images in data cubes and an instrument like the mwa - lfd will have much higher resolution ( spatially ) along the line - of sight than perpendicular to the line - of - sight .",
    "this allows for the option of binning in frequency space so that the data cube can have equal resolution in all three spatial dimensions . for an expected mwa - lfd resolution ( beam radius ) of @xmath103 arc - minutes",
    ", this corresponds to a region of @xmath104mhz or @xmath105 physical mpc along the line - of - sight at @xmath59 .",
    "a frequency interval of @xmath106mhz@xmath107mhz at @xmath59 corresponds to a value of @xmath108 , or a redshift range of @xmath109 . for an efficient cross - correlation we would therefore like galaxy redshifts to be known to @xmath110 , which requires spectroscopy .",
    "surveys for ly@xmath0 emitters narrow down the redshift range initially via the use of narrow - band filters , and then find sources with a strong emission line , making spectroscopy attainable .",
    "the characteristic lengths corresponding to the expected resolution of the mwa - lfd are well matched to the dimensions of surveys for ly@xmath0 emitting galaxies .",
    "for example , the sdf has a total area of 876 square arc - minutes .",
    "in this field the subaru team found 50 ly@xmath0 emitter candidates .",
    "spectra of 22 of these were obtained of which 16 were verified as high redshift galaxies , implying @xmath111 galaxies in this deep field .",
    "the line - of - sight dimension of the survey volume is set by the width of the narrow - band filter ( @xmath112 ) , centered on a mean wavelength of @xmath113 .",
    "this results in a field depth of @xmath114 , or @xmath115mpc . at @xmath38",
    "this depth is comparable to , but larger than the line - of - sight dimension corresponding to the expected mwa - lfd angular resolution .",
    "we may therefore divide the line of sight distance into a number of bins @xmath116 , so that the size of each bin is @xmath117 .",
    "we first define the angular scale that results in an angular beam radius @xmath118 , where @xmath119 .",
    "this results in cylindrical volumes of space where the diameter equals the length of the cylinder .",
    "we are now able to find the number of such cylindrical regions in the sdf survey volume ( @xmath120 , as well as the number containing galaxies [ @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the excess probability above random of finding a second galaxy within a cylinder ] , and the number of cylinders not containing galaxies ( @xmath123 ) .",
    "we next discuss the response of a phased array to the brightness temperature contrast of the igm . assuming that calibration can be performed ideally , and that foreground subtraction is perfect , the root - mean - square fluctuations in brightness temperature are given by the radiometer equation @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the wavelength , @xmath126 is the system temperature , @xmath127 the collecting area , @xmath128 the effective solid angle of the synthesized beam in radians , @xmath129 is the integration time",
    ", @xmath130 is the size of the frequency bin , and @xmath131 is a constant that describes the overall efficiency of the telescope .",
    "we optimistically adopt @xmath132 in this paper . in units relevant for upcoming telescopes and at @xmath133mhz ,",
    "we find ( wyithe , loeb & barnes  2005 ) @xmath134 here @xmath135 is the collecting area of a phased array consisting of 500 tiles each with 16 cross - dipoles [ the effective collecting area of an lfd tile with @xmath136 cross - dipole array with 1.07 m spacing is @xmath137m@xmath138 between 100 and 200mhz ( b. correy , private communication ) ] .",
    "the system temperature at 200mhz will be dominated by the sky and has a value @xmath139k .",
    "@xmath130 is the frequency range over which the signal is smoothed and @xmath140 is the size of the synthesized beam . the value of @xmath140 can be regarded as the radius of a hypothetical top - hat beam , or as the variance of a hypothetical gaussian beam .",
    "the corresponding values of the constant @xmath141 are 1 and 1.97 respectively . given the noise per synthesised beam , we can find the noise averaged in regions with and without galaxies as @xmath142 and @xmath143 respectively .",
    "the resulting uncertainty in brightness temperature between regions with and without galaxies is @xmath144 .",
    "the measurement of fluctuations in brightness temperature between over - dense and under - dense regions will require removal of emission from unresolved foreground objects . at a fixed frequency and on scales of a few arc - minutes",
    ", these foregrounds are believed to vary in amplitude at a level several orders of magnitude in excess of the expected 21 cm signal ( di  matteo et al .",
    "2002 ) . however , the foregrounds are expected to have smooth power - law spectra , while 21 cm emission from the igm will fluctuate in both space and frequency .",
    "this smoothness should allow removal through subtraction of a continuum component , leaving fluctuations due to 21 cm emission .",
    "however since the amplitude of the continuum will be different along each line of sight , we will be unable to determine its absolute level .",
    "rather , the fluctuations in 21 cm emission will need to be measured relative to the average continuum component along each line of sight ( about which the fluctuations in brightness temperature will average to zero ) .",
    "this average continuum must be measured from a region of spectrum having finite length ( the bandpass ) , and will therefore be determined only to an accuracy corresponding to fluctuations in the mean 21 cm emission across the whole bandpass . for the mwa - lfd",
    "the bandpass will be 32mhz .",
    "we may estimate the level of uncertainty introduced through subtraction of the continuum by considering the variance of the density field in cylinders of radius a few arc - minutes ( the synthesised beam size ) , and line of sight length corresponding to the band - pass .",
    "this variance can be shown to be around a few percent , which should be compared to the 10 - 20% representing the variance of the density field smoothed in spheres of radius a few arc - minutes . therefore , while fluctuations in the continuum subtraction will add to the uncertainty in the measurement , they are substantially smaller than the 21 cm fluctuations of interest .    in summary",
    "there are two aspects of the problem .",
    "first , there is the question of the distribution of overdensities ( smoothed on the scale of the 21 cm beam ) in the igm surrounding high redshift galaxies .",
    "the mean of this distribution must be significantly in excess of zero for any correlation of ly@xmath0 galaxies with large scale fluctuations in 21 cm emission to be detectable .",
    "second , there is the question of the sensitivity of the radio array , and the difference in average brightness temperature between regions ( on the scale of the beam ) that occupy or do not occupy galaxies .",
    "we treat each of these issues in turn .",
    "strong clustering of massive sources in overdense regions implies that these sources should trace the higher density regions of igm . in this section",
    "we compute the distribution of overdensities on a scale @xmath3 that are centered on galaxies of mass @xmath70 .",
    "these overdensities are larger than average since galaxies preferentially form in overdense regions .",
    "the likelihood of observing a galaxy at a random location is proportional to the number density of galaxies . at small values of large scale overdensity @xmath2 , this density is proportional to @xmath145 $ ] . more generally , given a large scale overdensity @xmath2 on a scale @xmath3 , the likelihood of observing a galaxy may be estimated from the sheth - tormen  ( 2002 ) mass function as @xmath146 where @xmath147 $ ] and @xmath148 $ ] .",
    "here @xmath95 is the variance of the density field smoothed with a top - hat window on a mass scale @xmath70 at redshift @xmath23 , and @xmath92 and @xmath149 are constants .",
    "note that here as elsewhere in this paper , we work with overdensities and variances computed at the redshift of interest ( i.e. not extrapolated to @xmath36 ) .",
    "equation  ( [ lh ] ) is simply the ratio of the number density of halos in a region of over - density @xmath2 to the number density of halos in the background universe .",
    "this ratio has been used to derive the bias for small values of @xmath2 ( mo & white  1996 ; sheth , mo & tormen  2001 ) .",
    "for example , in the press - schechter  ( 1974 ) formalism we write @xmath150\\left[\\frac{dn}{dm}(\\bar{\\nu})\\right]^{-1 } \\\\&\\sim & 1+\\delta\\left(1+\\frac{\\nu^2 - 1}{\\sigma(m)\\nu}\\right)\\equiv1+\\delta b,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath151 and @xmath152 are the average and perturbed mass functions , and @xmath88 is the bias factor .",
    "utilising bayes theorem , we find the a - posteriori probability distribution for the overdensity @xmath2 on the scale @xmath3 given the locations defined by a galaxy population .",
    "we obtain @xmath153 where @xmath154 is a gaussian of variance @xmath33 .    in figure  [ fig5 ]",
    "we show the differential ( left panel ) and cumulative ( right panel ) distributions of overdensity @xmath155 at the position of a ly@xmath0 emitting galaxy at @xmath39 .",
    "the overdensities refer to a density distribution that has been smoothed on a scale @xmath156 , and the ly@xmath0 emitters were assumed to have masses of @xmath83 ( upper row ) and @xmath84 ( lower row ) . in each case",
    "the 4 lines correspond to values of @xmath157 , 2 , 3 and 4 .",
    "the angular scales corresponding to these cases are @xmath158 , @xmath159 , @xmath160 , and @xmath161 .",
    "the means of these distributions are each greater than zero , with the departure greater in the case of smaller beam - size ( which has larger intrinsic variance )",
    ".    not every galaxy will be observed in an overdense region .",
    "however we are interested in correlating the 21 cm signal with galaxy position .",
    "the quantity of interest is therefore the distribution of the mean overdensity as measured using samples of @xmath162 galaxies . for @xmath163 and @xmath83 , we find that the mean overdensities sampled by galaxies are @xmath164 , @xmath165 , @xmath166 , @xmath167 for @xmath157 , 2 , 3 and 4 respectively .",
    "these values are each significantly in excess of zero .",
    "mass conservation implies that regions devoid of galaxies must be underdense .",
    "results for @xmath168 are plotted in the left panel of figure  [ fig6 ] , assuming experimental parameters that correspond to one sdf , combined with 1000 hours of integration using the mwa - lfd . here",
    "three lines are plotted corresponding to @xmath169 and 4 ( bottom to top ) .",
    "the case of @xmath170 leads to a near absence of empty regions , and hence a large uncertainty .",
    "the ly@xmath0 emitters in the sdf cover an order of magnitude in luminosity .",
    "the noise is therefore plotted as a function of the fraction of the brightest galaxies used ( @xmath171 ) .",
    "the noise level can be reduced as the square - root of the integration time , in proportion to the collecting area or number of lfd units , and as the square - root of the number of sdf equivalents surveyed .",
    "first let us suppose that the ionization fraction was uniform across the whole igm",
    ". in this case the brightness temperature of regions surrounding galaxies would be greater than average by a factor @xmath172 .",
    "similarly , those regions without ly@xmath0 emitters have @xmath173 , and hence brightness temperatures that are lower than average by a factor @xmath174 .",
    "we define the difference in brightness temperature between regions that contain and do not contain galaxies to be @xmath175 .",
    "the intrinsic ( i.e. uniform ionization fraction ) difference in brightness temperature between regions containing and not containing galaxies would therefore be @xmath176 where @xmath4 is the average neutral fraction .",
    "this offset must be subtracted from any measured difference to find the difference in ionization state between over and under - dense regions .",
    "equation  ( [ intrins ] ) represents a value of @xmath175 corresponding to an exponent of @xmath10 in the relation between overdensity and neutral fraction ( see equation  [ neut ] ) .    from equation  ( [ temp ] ) we find the uncertainty ( @xmath177 ) in the exponent @xmath14 given an uncertainty in the brightness temperature ( @xmath168 ) of the overdense regions @xmath178 figure  [ fig6 ] suggests that @xmath179mk will be achievable with first generation instruments , combined with ly@xmath0 surveys of comparable size to those already performed . given a measured uncertainty of @xmath180mk , we can determine the exponent @xmath14 to @xmath181 .",
    "this implies that we could easily tell the difference between reionization scenarios that predict @xmath182 ( i.e. the relation similar to that implied by our model ) , and a scenario where ionization was uniform with @xmath183    finally , as an example , we compare the expected brightness temperature noise and overdensity estimates ( for experimental parameters that correspond to one sdf , combined with 1000 hours of integration using the mwa - lfd ) to our model calculation of brightness temperature as a function of large scale overdensity ( with @xmath42 ) .",
    "three curves are shown in the right panel of figure  [ fig6 ] , with mock data points showing the estimated error over - plotted for comparison ( here the error bars have been computed for the value of @xmath171 that provides the smallest value of @xmath184 ) .",
    "the three sets of points and curves correspond to splitting up of the ly@xmath0 survey into @xmath185 , 3 and 4 redshift bins .",
    "the model curves have been computed assuming a scale for the overdensities that corresponds to the beam size ( @xmath156 ) in each case .",
    "note that where @xmath116 is smaller ( @xmath186 ) , the beams containing galaxies fill roughly half of the survey volume , so that @xmath187 .",
    "conversely , where @xmath116 is larger , the beams containing galaxies fill a small fraction of the survey volume . in this case @xmath188 .",
    "this example shows that even at this late stage of reionization , first generation surveys will be able to detect the correlation of galaxies with 21 cm emission . in the future",
    ", larger surveys and instruments will allow substantial improvements .",
    "for example , an array with 10 times the mwa - lfd collecting area , combined with 4 sdf s would reduce the uncertainty in @xmath14 by a factor of @xmath189 .",
    "in this paper we have calculated the expected cross - correlation between the distribution of galaxies and the intergalactic 21 cm emission at high redshifts .",
    "we constructed a simple model for reionization that accounts for both galaxy bias and an enhanced recombination rate in overdense regions , and used this model to compute the ionization fraction as a function of large scale overdensity in the igm .",
    "our model predicts that overdense regions will be ionized early as a result of their biased galaxy formation",
    ". this early phase of reionization in overdense regions leads to anti - correlations between the 21 cm emission and the overdensity of baryons , and between the 21 cm emission and the overdensity of neutral hydrogen .",
    "in addition , because galaxies are biased towards overdense regions , our model also predicts an anti - correlation between 21 cm emission and the galaxy population .    to explore the detectability of any correlation between 21 cm emission and galaxy properties , we also constructed a simple model for the ly@xmath0 emission corresponding to a dark - matter halo of a given mass , and hence for the ly@xmath0 luminosity function .",
    "we compared this model to an existing ly@xmath0 survey in the subaru deep field . through this comparison we demonstrated that current surveys probe galaxy masses that are larger than @xmath85 .",
    "due to their biased formation , galaxies of this mass are highly clustered in overdense regions of the igm .",
    "we have shown that by comparing 21 cm emission from regions near observed galaxies to those away from observed galaxies , future redshifted 21 cm observations will be able to test the generic prediction that overdense regions are reionized first ."
