    "extended emission structures with steep radio spectral indices , which are not obviously associated with any optical galaxy , are sometimes observed in rich cluster environments .",
    "these sources are broadly separated into cluster wide ` halos ' that appear relaxed and symmetric with respect to the x - ray intracluster gas , and the peripheral arc - like structures referred to as ` relics ' .",
    "both types are predominantly observed to be associated with hot ( @xmath1 kev ) , x - ray luminous ( @xmath2 erg s@xmath3 ) rich compact clusters @xcite ; however , the clusters that have peripheral relics may have somewhat lower temperatures @xcite .",
    "a standard hypothesis is that these sources are relic synchrotron plasma that has been revived .",
    "pks  b1400@xmath033 is an extended radio source , with an 85 mhz flux density of 57 jy @xcite , and has the lowest surface brightness of any source in the parkes catalog .",
    "pks  b1400@xmath033 appears to be associated with the poor cluster s753 of abell richness class 0 ; however , the source not been conclusively identified with any optical galaxy .",
    "previous low frequency images of the source using the vla and the most @xcite showed a relatively bright rim along the ne edge and low surface brightness filamentary emission trailing off to the sw .",
    "the source was observed to have a steep spectrum with spectral index @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) in the range 1.2 - 2.4 .    the unusual nature of this possible relic radio source and its potential value as a probe of the gas dynamics and evolution of poor cluster environments has led us to carry out new radio observations of the source .",
    "we have made images with improved surface brightness sensitivity at 330 mhz using the very large array ( vla ) , at 843 mhz with the molonglo observatory synthesis telescope ( most ) and at 1398 and 2378 mhz using the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) .",
    "table 1 is a summary of the new radio observations .",
    "these are presented here followed by discussions on the origin of this source in the light of the current understanding of the phenomenology and formation of relics in the intracluster medium ( icm ) .",
    "pks  b1400@xmath033 was observed at 330 mhz with the vla separately in the cnb , c , and dnc array configurations in order to image the extended emission in this low surface brightness source .",
    "hybrid arrays were included because of the southern declination .",
    "the data were self calibrated and imaged in aips using three - dimensional imaging routines . the vla 330 mhz image of the source is shown in fig .  1 .",
    "the image has been made combining data from all the configurations with a beam of fwhm @xmath6 arcsec@xmath7 at a p.a .",
    "of @xmath8 ; the r.m.s .",
    "noise is 2.5 mjy beam@xmath3 .",
    "this radio image , as well as all the higher frequency radio images presented here , has been corrected for the primary beam attenuation .    because of its steep spectrum , the total extent of the diffuse source is best defined by the 330 mhz vla image .",
    "the low surface brightness source is bounded to the ne by a relatively bright rim of emission ( marked ne rim in fig .",
    "1 ) , while the source is bounded on the opposite sw side by a second fainter ridge of emission ( marked sw rim in fig .",
    "1 ) . both the bounding rims are concave outwards .",
    "the emission that lies between the bounding ridges is filamentary and decreases in surface brightness from ne towards the sw .",
    "the bright compact source that is observed in the image close to the nw edge of the extended source , at ra @xmath9 , dec @xmath10 ( j2000.0 ) , has a flux density of 0.95 jy at 330 mhz ; the compact source appears slightly resolved and has a deconvolved size of about 25 arcsec . as discussed below , this compact component is identified with the galaxy ngc 5419 .",
    "there is evidence for a protrusion towards the sw beyond the bounding rim ; this extension , marked p in fig .",

    ", that is presumably an unrelated confusing source .",
    "the error in the absolute flux density scale at 330 mhz is believed to be about 2 % .",
    "the 843 mhz most image of pks  b1400@xmath033 is shown in fig .",
    "this image , obtained using the most sensitive @xmath13 field of view , better reproduces the extended structure than the 843 mhz image in @xcite .",
    "the image has been made with a beam of fwhm @xmath14 arcsec@xmath7 at a p.a .",
    "of @xmath15 and has an r.m.s .",
    "noise of 1 mjy beam@xmath3 .",
    "the 843 mhz image of the extended source shows the relatively bright rim along the ne , the filamentary structures trailing from this ridge towards the sw and the curved rim that defines the boundary of the diffuse source at the sw end .",
    "the flux density of the extended source ( again excluding ngc 5419 and the embedded backgound source b ) is 1.3 jy at 843 mhz .",
    "ngc 5419 has a flux density of 0.46 jy at 843 mhz .",

    "the flux density scale in the most image is accurate to 5 % .",
    "pks  b1400@xmath033 was observed using the 375 m and the 750b 750 m array configurations of the atca during 1995 jan and june .",
    "observations were made in two 128 mhz wide bands centred at 1398 and 2378 mhz ; the bands were covered using 13 channels .",
    "the extended source was covered with a nine - pointings mosaic with the pointings spaced @xmath18 apart in ra and dec .",
    "continuum images at the two frequencies were made separately using the channel data , adopting a bandwidth synthesis approach to avoid bandwidth smearing effects ; the mosaic imaging was carried out in aips++ .",
    "deconvolution used the multi - scale clean algorithm : the bright compact source at the edge of the extended emission was first removed from the ` dirty ' image using a ` box ' clean and subsequently a multi - scale clean was performed on the residual image .",
    "the final images at the two frequencies were then convolved to identical beams of fwhm @xmath19 arcsec@xmath20 at a p.a . of @xmath15 . consequently",
    ", different weightings were adopted at the two atca frequencies during the imaging step ; however , the convolution to identical final beams implies that the images presented here effectively have the same visibility range .",

    "the extended radio source pks  b1400@xmath033 ( not including ngc 5419 and the background source b ) has a mean spectral index @xmath27 between 330 and 1398 mhz .",
    "the spectral index appears to steepen to @xmath28 between 1398 and 2378 mhz ; this may be because of missing extended flux density in the 2378 mhz interferometric mosaic image .",
    "the 85 mhz data indicates a spectral flattening at low frequencies .",

    "the physical parameters in those powerful fr ii radio galaxies and head - tail and wide - angle tail radio sources , which have extended emission structures much bigger than the size of the host galaxy , may be useful probes of the surrounding medium @xcite . the radio structures that are overpressured with respect to the ambient medium expand in the ambient gas with speeds limited by ram pressure ; therefore , derivations of the ambient gas properties depend on a knowledge of the expansion speeds .",
    "radio structures with relatively low surface brightness , like the diffuse source pks  b1400@xmath033 , potentially have the lowest internal energy densities and pressures , and are most likely to be in a static pressure balance with the ambient thermal gas . therefore , the internal state of such synchrotron plasma might be a direct probe of the surrounding thermal environment .",
    "@xcite studied the properties of the synchrotron plasma in the diffuse bridges of the lobes of powerful and giant radio galaxies located in the field .",

    "other cluster halo sources are inferrred to have a similar low @xmath53 dyne cm@xmath43 @xcite .",
    "the extremely low synchrotron plasma pressure inferred for the halo sources appears inconsistent with their location at the centers of rich clusters .",
    "this anomaly might be related to the origin of the halo : the diffuse halos are not identified with any currently active galaxy and are , instead , postulated as being reaccelerated relic plasma @xcite .",

    "the surface brightness of pks  b1400@xmath033 is about 3 mjy arcmin@xmath43 at 1 ghz . if we assume that the cm - wavelength spectrum of pks  b1400@xmath033 continues with @xmath27 to low frequencies , the inferred @xmath47 is @xmath54 dyne cm@xmath43 .",
    "however , @xcite measured the 85 mhz flux density of the source to be 57 jy giving the source a mean spectral index of @xmath55 between 330 and 85 mhz .",

    "rood # 27 also has an extremely low @xmath50 but somewhat higher than that of pks  b1400@xmath033 ; additionally , the spectral index of rood # 27 is close to 0.6 and is not as steep as that of pks  b1400@xmath033 .",
    "the extremely steep spectral index ( mean @xmath58 ) of pks  b1400@xmath033 suggests that the source is composed of relic synchrotron plasma in which energy injection has ceased and , subsequently , the spectral index has steepened as a consequence of synchrotron losses ( spectral aging ) .",
    "the steep spectrum indicates that there is no on - going or recent reacceleration .",
    "moreover , the steep spectrum also suggests that the emissivity of this source has not been significantly enhanced as a result of adiabatic compression .",
    "pks  b1400@xmath033 is likely a relic of a source that was bright in its youth . extrapolating the measured flux density of 57 jy at 85 mhz to cm wavelengths using a spectral index of @xmath59",

    "if pks  b1400@xmath033 has been displaced from ngc 5419 over the distance of @xmath71 kpc by buoyant forces , we would expect the movement to occur over a timescale    @xmath72    where @xmath73 is the density of the entrained thermal matter , @xmath74 is the density of the thermal intra - cluster medium and @xmath75 is the gravitational mass of the cluster within radius @xmath76 .",

    "alternatively , we consider the possibility that the displacement between pks  b1400@xmath033 and ngc 5419 is the result of transverse motion of the galaxy itself . assuming a timescale of @xmath80 years and a separation @xmath71 kpc , the implied transverse velocity is @xmath81 km s@xmath3 .",
    "this is consistent with the cluster velocity dispersion and with the peculiar radial velocity of ngc 5419 of 184 km s@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the central component c , which has a relatively flatter spectrum , might be the site where the galaxy was situated when activity in its nucleus created the extended source .    in the above scenario , pks  b1400@xmath033",
    "was created in the past owing to nuclear activity in ngc 5419 .",

    "however , the parent cluster s753 has a shallow gravitational potential well and the icm presumably has a relatively low gas pressure . consequently , relativistic electrons that are distributed over a wider area in the relic plasma may survive radiative losses and be available to be re - energized by a passing shock wave @xcite .",
    "the steep spectral index of pks  b1400@xmath033 ( mean @xmath58 ) implies a relatively low shock compression ratio @xmath83 ; this is consistent with the flatter gravitational potential of the poor cluster .",

    "as discussed in section 6 , the surface brightness of the source is extremely low , similar to that in cluster halos ; however , the inferred @xmath47 is more characteristic of cluster relics .",
    "the radio galaxy phenomenon , in which beams from an active nucleus power extended radio lobes , is believed to be short lived compared to the hubble time .",
    "when the central engine switches off , presumably as the fuel is exhausted , the lobes suffer radiative losses that deplete the more energetic electrons and steepen the spectrum .",
    "however , expansion losses , if present , quickly render the synchrotron relic invisible because the radio power drops rapidly : in an expanding synchrotron bubble with a tangled magnetic field , the spectral luminosity falls as @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the expansion factor @xcite .",
    "for this reason , we expect invisible relics to be present in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) where the ambient densities and gas pressures may be lowest , and relics may preferentially be visible in a higher density medium where expansion losses are smaller",
    ".    a plausible scenario for the origin of a cluster relic like pks  b1400@xmath033 would be one in which activity in a galaxy located in the vicinity or boundaries of a cluster produced twin beams , of which one resulted in a radio lobe within the icm and the other oppositely directed beam resulted in a second lobe outside of the cluster gas and in a relatively lower density igm .",
    "the differences between the environments of the two lobes would be more pronounced if the double radio source is a giant radio source and the activity axis is aligned with a local gradient in the ambient gas density . following cessation of nuclear activity in the host , the lobe in the igm would quickly disappear from radio images , while the lobe located in the denser icm would survive as a steep spectrum relic .    in this scenario ,",
    "the extended source pks  b1400@xmath033 would be one lobe of a relic double radio source . from the viewpoint of such an interpretation , the structure of the radio source ( fig .",
    "1 ) suggests that the double may have been edge brightened and the ne rim of pks  b1400@xmath033 ( the region with the flattest spectral index ) might be the site of past hotspots and the end of the double source",
    ". the low surface brightness filamentary emission trailing towards the sw from this rim could be the relic cocoon of the backflowing plasma .",
    "the overall spectral steepening observed from the ne rim towards the sw ( see fig .",
    "6 ) is consistent with such a hypothesis .",
    "the faint protrusion past the rim along the sw boundary ( marked p in fig .",
    "1 ) might be a relic bridge .",
    "we would expect a possible host galaxy to lie towards the sw and along the axis defined by the protrusion ; a counterlobe , if it is detectable , may be located beyond that .    to test this hypothesis , we first searched wide - field nvss and most images of this field for a possible counterlobe along the axis defined by the brightest portion of the ne arc and the sw protrusion in fig .",
    "a tentative most detection at 843 mhz was followed up with a pointed observation using the @xmath13 field of view . when smoothed to a resolution of @xmath40 fwhm",
    ", this observation gives marginal evidence for a very extended source ( @xmath8650 arcmin@xmath20 ) with centroid position ra @xmath87 , dec @xmath88 ( j2000.0 ) and an integrated flux density of @xmath89 mjy .",
    "we then examined the optical field along the same axis for possible host galaxies . a candidate with @xmath90 , and classified as s0 by @xcite , was found at ra @xmath91 , dec @xmath92 ( j2000.0 ) ; it is marked h in fig .",
    "the peak of pks  b1400@xmath033 , the location of galaxy h and the peak of the extended source tentatively detected in the most observation are collinear within a few degrees .",
    "we subsequently obtained an optical spectrum of galaxy h in the 40007700   window using the anu 2.3-m telescope and double - beam spectrograph at siding spring observatory in may 2002 .",
    "its redshift , @xmath93 , implies a peculiar velocity of 1090 km s@xmath3 relative to the mean redshift of the cluster .",
    "examining the distribution in galaxy velocities for a magnitude limited sample towards the cluster ( see fig . 4 in @xcite )",
    ", we infer that galaxy h is likely to be a member of s753 .",
    "it lies @xmath94 from the center of pks  b1400@xmath033 , implying a projected separation of 300@xmath22 kpc at the distance of the cluster .",
    "the optical spectrum shows narrow emission lines of h@xmath4 , [ n ii ] and the [ s ii ] doublet ; the [ n  ii]/h@xmath4 and [ s ii]/h@xmath4 ratios are about 0.25 and 0.22 strongly suggestive of starburst activity ( and not emission from an agn environment ) .",
    "agn - type radio activity usually occurs in elliptical galaxies and the probability of such activity is an increasing function of optical luminosity .",
    "samples of extended radio sources show a sharp decline for hosts with @xmath95-band optical luminosity @xmath96 @xcite . on the other hand , in the cluster",
    "abell 428 , @xcite do find a powerful extended radio source 0313@xmath0192 associated with an @xmath97 disk - dominated host that is most likely an early type spiral ( sa  sb ) .",
    "the argument against galaxy h being the host of pks  b1400@xmath033 is simply that it is even further underluminous , with @xmath98 .",
    "we have presented new and improved radio images of the relic source pks  b1400@xmath033 .",
    "we have discussed the origin of this relic in the light of recent progress in the understanding of relic synchrotron plasma in cluster environments .",
    "the diffuse source has an extremely low surface brightness and a steep spectrum , with radio properties unlike that of relics and halos observed in cluster environments .",
    "the unusual morphology , placement in the cluster and physical parameters indicate an unusual origin for this source .",
    "the new data does not represent evidence suggesting that the relic source pks  b1400@xmath033 was created by past activity in ngc 5419 . nor do the observations rule out this possibility .",
    "the discussions suggest that pks  b1400@xmath033 is not a typical relic .",
    "the radio properties suggest that if the source was created by processes similar to those that form the relics and halos , we might be observing an extreme form of a relic in a poor cluster environment or , perhaps , a relic of a re - energized relic .",
    "we have presented marginal evidence supportive of the hypothesis that the diffuse source pks  b1400@xmath033 was born as a lobe of a powerful radio galaxy ; however , we do not have a good candidate for the optical host .",
    "the source is unusual and the peculiar radio properties might be indicating an unusual origin : we favour the interpretation that the diffuse source is a relic of a lobe injected into the cluster environment as worthy of further consideration , particularly because of the novelty of the proposed phenomenon .",
    "followup low frequency imaging of the field , possibly with the vla at 74 mhz , with the aim of confirming the most detection of a counterlobe and better quality imaging of any low surface brightness connecting features , is proposed as the next step towards understanding the phenomenology in this unusual source .",
    "the australia telescope compact array is part of the australia telescope which is funded by the commonwealth of australia for operation as a national facility managed by csiro .",
    "the national radio astronomy observatory is a facility of the national science foundation operated under cooperative agreement by associated universities , inc .",
