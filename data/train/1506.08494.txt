    "it is currently accepted that magnetars are highly magnetized neutron stars whose dipole magnetic field reaches @xmath310@xmath410@xmath5  g , implied by their slow spin periods of 212s and rapid spin - down rates of @xmath6 s s@xmath7 ( see reviews , e.g. , given by @xcite ; but see @xcite for two low magnetic field magnetar cases recently discovered ) .",
    "neutron stars which have traditionally been classified as anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) or soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgrs ) belong to this magnetar class , and over 20 magnetars have been identified up to now @xcite .",
    "their bright x - ray luminosities can not be explained by rotational energy loss rates and hence the energy source is considered to be provided by the decay of their ultra - strong magnetic fields .",
    "axps and sgrs are well known to show a variety of high - energy phenomena ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) including the exceptionally bright ` giant flares ' whose peak luminosity amounts to @xmath8 erg s@xmath7 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition to these intensive studies at x - ray energies , magnetars have been subjected to multi - wavelength follow - up observations in radio , optical , and infrared ( ir ) bands . among the magnetars",
    "identified so far , the axp 4u 0142 + 61 is the best studied magnetar at optical and ir wavelengths due to its relatively short distance ( distance @xmath9 kpc ) and low extinction ( @xmath10 ; @xcite ) .",
    "an optical counterpart was first discovered by @xcite from 4u  0142 + 61 .",
    "the optical flux was higher than the rayleigh - jeans tail of the blackbody component seen in x - ray band , requiring another emission mechanism .",
    "subsequently , @xcite found that the optical emission is pulsed at its spin period and that the pulsed fraction is @xmath327% , which is higher than 4%14% observed in its x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "a very faint near - ir counterpart was also identified by @xcite , and then _ spitzer space telescope _ detected mid - ir emission from 4u  0142 + 61 @xcite .",
    "importantly , @xcite found that two different emission components are needed to explain the combined optical and ir spectral energy distribution ( sed ) .",
    "namely , the thermal blackbody - like component , possibly emitted from a debris disk around the pulsar , is dominant over the 2.28 @xmath11 m range , while another power - law like component ( represented by @xmath12 ) can account for the residual emission in the optical @xmath13 and near - ir @xmath14 bands @xcite . follow - up _ spitzer _",
    "mid - ir spectroscopy and 24  @xmath11 m imaging of the axp were consistent with the interpretation of a debris disk for the ir emission @xcite .",
    "however , the origin of the optical power - law emission is still unclear , although it would probably arise from the magnetosphere because the emission is relatively highly pulsed .",
    "in order to shed new light on the optical emission mechanism of magnetars , we have carried out polarimetric observations for the nearest and least absorbed magnetar 4u  0142 + 61 using the subaru 8.2-m telescope . in @xcite , we have reported a 4.3% upper limit ( 90% confidence level ) on the degree of circular polarization in @xmath0-band emission from the source . in this paper",
    "we present the result from our linear polarimetry of the source at @xmath0-band .",
    "we carried out linear imaging polarimetry of 4u 0142 + 61 at i - band with the 8.2-m subaru telescope on 2013 december 2223 .",
    "two first half of the telescope time in each night were awarded to us by the national astronomical observatory of japan .",
    "due to high humidity in the first night , only three hours of data were taken .",
    "for the second night , full five hours of the telescope time were used .",
    "the faint object camera and spectrograph ( focas ; @xcite ) was used for the polarimetric observation . in this mode , a wollaston prism and a half - wave retarder",
    "are inserted to the collimated beam .",
    "an incident beam is splited by the wollaston prism into two orthogonally polarized beams , one ordinary ( o - beam ) and the other extraordinary ( e - beam ) .",
    "to avoid blending of the two beams , a standard focal mask has to be used . in order to measure the degree of linear polarization and the position angle of polarization in the celestial plane , one set of four exposures of a target with the half - wave plate at four position angles ,",
    "00 , 450 , 225 , and 675 , are required .",
    "the focas detector was two fully - depleted - type 2k@xmath154k ccds , the pixel scale of which was 0104pixel@xmath7 .",
    "we 2@xmath152 binned the detector for our observation .    in our observation ,",
    "each set of four exposures were taken by setting the half - wave plate at the four position angles alternately . in order to avoid possible",
    "sever saturation caused by bright stars , the time of each exposure was 2 min . between the sets of the exposures , the telescope was five - point dithered to avoid bad pixels on the ccds and to help remove cosmic ray hits during the data reduction . in total",
    ", in the first and second night we obtained 19 sets and 32 sets of the exposures , respectively .",
    "the observing conditions were unfortunately mediocre comparing to what we wished ( 05 seeing would be ideal ) .",
    "the average seeing was approximately 080 in the first night and 086 in the second night .        in order to determine the zero point of the position angle of polarization in the celestial plane , the standard star bd+64d106 , which has strongly polarized emission ,",
    "was observed .",
    "we used the iraf packages for data reduction .",
    "the images were bias subtracted and flat fielded .",
    "dome flats at the four position angles of the half - wave plate were taken and used for flat fielding respectively . for our target , the images made at each angle",
    "were then combined into one final image of the target field by positionally calibrating them to a reference image . in the first night at the position angle of 450 ,",
    "the target position in one image was contaminated by a cosmic ray hit , and the image was not included in image combining . in total the on - source exposure times at each position angle is 38 min ( 36 min for the position angle of 450 ) and 64 min in the first and second night , respectively . because of the faintness of the target and mediocre seeing during our observations , the signal - to - noise ratios of the target in each night s images are not sufficiently high .",
    "we therefore combined all the data of the two nights and made a set of four images of the target field at the four position angles respectively .",
    "a target - field image , made by combing all the images , is shown in figure  [ fig : fld ] .",
    "for the standard star , aperture photometry was performed and the o - beam and e - beam brightnesses at each position angle were obtained . for the target , because of its faintness , we used the point spread function ( psf ) photometry tasks from iraf s daophot package to measure its brightnesses .",
    "we also derived aperture corrections by using 8  in - field , relatively bright stars ( brightest stars in the field were saturated ) .",
    "a radius of 10.0 pixels ( @xmath16 ) was used for aperture photometry of these bright stars .",
    "the uncertainties on the corrections are negligible , as they are much smaller than those from photometry of the target .",
    "these magnitude measurements and uncertainties are given in table  [ tab : phot ] .",
    "the degree of linear polarization @xmath17 is calculated from @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are stokes parameters .",
    "they are determined from @xmath21 where @xmath22 here @xmath23 , the ratio of the intensity @xmath0 of the target in the e - beam and o - beam frames at each of the four position angles of the half - wave plate .",
    "the position angle @xmath24 of linear polarization is determined from @xmath25 then from standard propagation of uncertainty , where a first - order taylor series expansion is used and the variables in the functions are assumed to be independent , the uncertainties on @xmath17 and @xmath24 can be calculated from those on intensity measurments ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "using the formulae given above , we first checked the polarization measurements for the standard star . from the intensity measurements",
    ", we found @xmath26 ( @xmath27 , @xmath28 ) at @xmath0-band , which is consistent with the reported value 4.696@xmath29 @xcite .",
    "therefore no instrumental correction to the polarization measurement was needed .",
    "the position angle @xmath30 in the instrumental coordinate ( cf . equation ( 2 ) ) was found to be @xmath31 . comparing it to the reported value @xmath32 @xcite , which is the position angle in the celetial plane , the correction @xmath33 was determined to be @xmath34 .",
    "we then calculated the stokes parameters and degree of linear polarization for 4u 0142 + 61 , and found @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 .",
    "since the uncertainty dominates , a 90% confidence level constraint on the degree of linear polarization was derived .",
    "the upper limit is 5.6% .",
    "in addition , also due to the large uncertainties on @xmath20 and @xmath19 , @xmath38 ( where @xmath39 ) , which provides no useful information .",
    "neutron stars are known to generally have faint optical emission , either the rayleigh - jeans tail of high - temperature thermal surface emission or nonthermal emission arising from their magnetospheres .",
    "optical ( or near - ir ) fluxes of magnetars lie above the spectra extrapolated from their blackbody - like x - ray components ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which excludes the former case for magnetars . for the latter ,",
    "polarized emission is expected and actually is observed in optical emission from radio pulsars ( e.g. , @xcite ) . while the current emission models , such as the polar cap , outer gap , two - pole caustic , and striped pulsar wind ( see the detailed discussion in @xcite and references therein ) , which involve radiation mechanisms including curvature , synchrotron , or inverse compton scattering radiation , can not fully explain the well - studied crab pulsar case , 510% phase - averaged linear polarization is detected in optical emission from several close or young radio pulsars ( e.g. , the crab pulsar , @xcite ; b0540@xmath4069 , @xcite ; the vela pulsar , @xcite ; b0656 + 14 , @xcite ; b1509@xmath4058 , @xcite ) .",
    "the polarization upper limit of 5.6% we have obtained suggests , while marginally , a different emission mechanism from that considered in radio pulsars and thus supports a class of their own for magnetars .    considering the surface magnetic fields of @xmath41  g for magnetars , @xcite have suggested that optical emission from them could be similar to radio emission from radio pulsars , i.e. , due to synchrotron radiation from electron / positron pairs . in this scenario ,",
    "strong linear polarization should be seen , since pulsars radio emission is known to have the degrees of linear polarization ( phase - averaged ) in a range of from 10% to as high as 100% ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "additionally , @xcite have suggested ion cyclotron emission or curvature emission by electron / positron pairs as two possible mechanisms for magnetars optical emission .",
    "for the both mechanisms , certain degree of linear polarization might be expected .",
    "our measurement suggests zero or low linear polarization in optical emission , not supporting the scenarios .",
    "however , the propagation effects in a magnetosphere may cause a strong depolarization of optical emission .",
    "the natural wave modes of optical wave in the pulsar magnetosphere are usually two orthogonal linearly polarized modes : the ordinary mode polarized in @xmath42 plane and the extraordinary mode perpendicular to that plane .",
    "the adiabatic evolution condition of the two linear modes is ( see details in @xcite ) @xmath43 here @xmath44 is the multiplicity , @xmath45 , @xmath46 with @xmath47 the lorentz factor of the streaming plasma , @xmath48 g and @xmath49hz are the magnetic field strength and wave frequency . note that we reasonably suppose @xmath50 ( @xmath51 is the light cylinder radius ) . assuming a dipole , the magnetic field strength can be written as @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the surface magnetic field , @xmath54 g , @xmath55 the neutron star radius , and we set @xmath56 km , @xmath57s . for @xmath58 , we have @xmath59 .",
    "thus if it is in the outer magnetosphere where magnetar optical emission is generated , the mode evolution would be usually non - adiabatic , implying that the polarization direction almost does not change when propagating through the magnetosphere .",
    "considering the emission of a relativistic particle accelerated along the magnetic field direction , the initial polarization state should be the pure ordinary mode ( @xmath60 ) in each direction of the @xmath61 emission cone .",
    "the polarization percentage of the combined wave of the cone obviously equals to zero at the emission point .",
    "as pointed by @xcite , the polarization directions of the cone could be aligned by adiabatic walking after propagating a distance , which gives a very high polarization percentage such as in radio emission . however ,",
    "if the optical emission comes from the outer magnetosphere , adiabatic walking would not occur since the mode evolution is non - adiabatic .",
    "the final polarization degree should be close to zero in this case . in this emission model , if the emission region extends to inner magnetosphere where mode evolution is adiabatic , partial polarization are expected , which may be the case of the crab pulsar . for 4u  0142 + 61 , the optical emission region could be higher so that the mode evolution is purely non - adiabatic everywhere , and the final polarization degree is close to zero .",
    "even the initial emission at each height is highly polarized for some other mechanisms , the total emission from the whole magnetosphere could also be depolarized due to the aberration / retardation effect .",
    "the observed emission at one phase may come from different magnetic field curve planes where the local polarization directions are different .",
    "different from the radio band , pulsar optical emission may extend from the inner magnetosphere to light cylinder radius , such as the whole slot gap and outer gap region , which makes the depolarization due to the aberration / retardation effect much stronger .",
    "the detailed depolarization degree depends on the emission geometry in a magnetosphere .",
    "we also note that possible precession of 4u  0142 + 61 with a period of @xmath315 hours was reported @xcite , although it was not confirmed by nustar observations @xcite .",
    "this precession could cause the polarization degree to be further averaged down in our 3 and 5 hours observations .",
    "in addition to the pulsar magnetospheric origin considered above , optical i - band emission from 4u  0142 + 61 could have other origin .",
    "for example , part of it ( the non - pulsed component ) could arise from the debris disk around the magnetar . in a recently re - proposed model for magnetars ( @xcite ; following the pioneering work by @xcite and @xcite ) , they are suggested to be massive , highly magnetized white dwarfs with emission powered by their rotational energy ( similar to pulsars ) .",
    "the optical and ir sed of 4u  0142 + 61 then might be explained by the thermal surface emission from a massive white dwarf plus that from a surrounding disk ( for details , see @xcite ) . for these possibilities , low linear polarization ( at most a few percent ) would be expected , since the central star s emission can significantly lower the polarization level in optical light from a debris disk system ( although emission from a debris disk may have high polarization ; e.g. , @xcite ) , or thermal surface emission from a star can not be highly polarized ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "our constraint on the linear polarization is actually consistent with these possibilities .",
    "our subaru polarimetry likely represents the best effort for measuring polarization in optical light from 4u  0142 + 61 or the known magnetars in general , since they do not have detectable optical emission or are extremely faint @xcite .",
    "however , it would be interesting to carry out such observations when they , particularly 4u  0142 + 61 , are in an outburst .",
    "the comparison would provide further information for our understanding of magnetars emission mechanisms and related properties . in the future , polarimetry with an extremely large telescope , such as the thirty - meter telescope , would certainly help our understanding by obtaining a much tight constraint or a measurement in a much shorter observation .",
    "the result would possibly help determine the emission mechanism at optical bands for magnetars and even identify the true nature of magnetars .",
