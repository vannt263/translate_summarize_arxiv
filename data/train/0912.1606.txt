    "monolayer and bilayer graphene are distinct electronic materials .",
    "monolayer graphene is a sheet of carbon in a honeycomb lattice that is one atom thick , while bilayer graphene comprises two such sheets , with the first lattice @xmath2 above the second . since the first transport measurements  @xcite in 2005",
    ", we have come a long way in understanding the basic transport mechanisms of carriers in these new carbon allotropes .",
    "( for recent reviews , see refs .  ) .",
    "a unique feature of both monolayer and bilayer graphene is that the density of carriers can be tuned continuously by an external gate from electron - like carriers at positive doping to holes at negative doping .",
    "the behavior at the crossover depends strongly on the amount of disorder . in the absence of any disorder and at zero temperature , there are no free carriers at precisely zero doping . however , ballistic transport through evanescent modes should give rise to a universal minimum quantum limited conductivity @xmath3 in both monolayer  @xcite and bilayer graphene.@xcite the `` ballistic regime '' should hold so long as the disorder - limited mean - free path is larger than the distance between the contacts .",
    "@xcite at finite temperature , the thermal smearing of the fermi surface gives a density @xmath4 for monolayer graphene .",
    "for ballistic transport in these monolayers , the conductivity @xmath5 for large @xmath6 , so @xmath7.@xcite in the absence of disorder , @xmath8 interpolates from the universal @xmath9 to the linear in @xmath10 regime following a function that depends only on @xmath11 ; ( @xmath12 is the fermi temperature ) .",
    "@xcite    most experiments , however , are in the dirty or diffusive limit , which is characterized by a conductivity that is linear in density ( i.e. @xmath13 , with a mobility @xmath14 that is independent of both temperature and carrier density  @xcite ) , and the existence of a minimum conductivity plateau  @xcite in @xmath15 , with @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath17 is the root - mean - square fluctuation in carrier density induced by the disorder . in bilayer graphene , to our knowledge , all experiments are in the diffusive limit .",
    "the purpose of the current work is to calculate the temperature dependence of the minimum conductivity plateau in bilayer graphene .",
    "the temperature dependent conductivity of diffusive graphene monolayers is understood to depend largely on phonons ,  @xcite but monolayer and bilayer graphene are distinct electronic materials and phonons are not expected to be important for bilayer graphene transport at the experimentally relevant temperatures .",
    "an important difference between monolayer and bilayer graphene is the band structure near the dirac point .",
    "monolayer graphene has the conical band structure and a density of states that vanishes linearly at the dirac point .",
    "bilayer graphene has a constant density of states close to the dirac point from a hyperbolic dispersion . the tight - binding description for bilayer graphene  @xcite results in a hyperbolic band dispersion @xmath18 , \\label{eq : band}\\ ] ] that is completely specified by two parameters , @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( where @xmath21 is planck s constant ) . for very small carrier density @xmath22",
    ", one can approximate bilayer graphene as having a parabolic dispersion , although most experiments typically approach carrier densities as large as @xmath23 .",
    "the density of states for bilayer graphene is @xmath24,\\ ] ] where the parabolic approximation keeps only the first term .",
    "understanding the temperature dependence of the conductivity minimum is complicated for two reasons .",
    "first , there is activation of both electron and hole carriers at finite temperature .",
    "second , the disorder induces regions of inhomogeneous carrier density ( i.e. puddles of electrons and holes ) .",
    "moreover , tuning the carrier density with a gate changes the ratio between electron - puddles and hole - puddles , until at very high density there is only a single type of carrier .",
    "the temperature dependence of the conductivity for bilayer graphene was studied in ref .   using a coherent potential approximation .",
    "while this approach better captures the impurity scattering and electronic screening properties of graphene , it does not account for the puddle physics which is our main focus .",
    "reference modeled the temperature dependence of the dirac point conductivity by assuming that the graphene samples comprised just two big `` puddles '' each with the same number of carriers . in the appropriate limits ,",
    "our results agree with these previous works .",
    "below we will provide a semi - analytic expression for the graphene conductivity by averaging over the random distribution of puddles with different carrier densities .",
    "this result is valid throughout the crossover from the dirac point ( where fluctuations in carrier density dominate ) to high density ( where these fluctuations are irrelevant ) , both with and without the thermal activation of carriers .",
    "= 1.0    given a microscopic model for the disorder , one can compute both @xmath14 and @xmath17 .",
    "shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mobility ] are results for bilayer graphene mobility assuming both short - range and coulomb disorder with different approximations for the screening , and for both parabolic and hyperbolic dispersion relations . as seen from the figure , generically , coulomb impurities show a super - linear dependence on carrier density while short - range scattereres are sub - linear .",
    "similar to monolayer graphene,@xcite increasing the dielectric constant tends to decrease ( increase ) the scattering of electrons off long ( short ) range impurities , except in the over - screened and unscreened limits .",
    "all experiments to date find the mobility to be linear in gate voltage , so it is unclear what the dominant scattering mechanism in bilayer graphene is ( see also discussion in ref .  ) .",
    "further experiments along the lines of refs .   are needed .    in what follows",
    "we take @xmath14 and @xmath17 to be parameters of the theory that can be determined directly from experiments : @xmath14 can be obtained from low temperature transport measurements and @xmath17 from local probe measurements.@xcite lacking such microscopic measurements for the samples we compare with , we treat @xmath17 as a fitting parameter , while taking @xmath14 from experiment . as a consequence of this parameterization ,",
    "the results reported here do not depend on the microscopic details of the impurity potential , provided this parameterization reasonably characterizes the properties of the impurity potential . until more information about the important scattering centers is determined from experiment",
    ", all microscopic models will require a similar number of parameters such as the concentration of impurities @xmath25 and their typical distance @xmath26 from the graphene sheet .",
    "further , the results will disagree with experiment unless the choices give a constant mobility .",
    "a key assumption in this work is the applicability of effective medium theory ( emt ) , which describes the bulk conductivity @xmath27 of an inhomogeneous medium by the integral equation  @xcite @xmath28 \\frac{\\sigma(n ) - \\sigma_{\\rm emt}}{\\sigma(n ) + \\sigma_{\\rm      emt } } = 0 .",

    "[ eq : eqemt1 ] gives @xmath27 equal to the average conductivity .",
    "the denominator weights the integral to cancel the build - up of any internal electric fields .",
    "the emt description has been shown to work well whenever the transport is semiclassical and quantum corrections and any additional resistance caused by the @xmath30 interfaces between the electron and hole puddles can be ignored.@xcite it is assumed that the band structure is not altered by the disorder , which is to be expected for the experimentally relevant disorder concentrations.@xcite since we are concerned with diffusive transport in the dirty limit , we expect that the emt results hold for bilayer graphene .",
    "= 1.0    = 1.0    to solve eq .",
    "[ eq : eqemt1 ] we make the additional assumption that the distribution function @xmath31 $ ] is gaussian centered at @xmath32 , ( i.e. the field effect carrier density induced by the back gate that is proportional to @xmath33 ) , with width @xmath17 .",
    "( this assumption is justified both theoretically@xcite and empirically@xcite ) .",
    "our results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : main ] , where as discussed earlier , the temperature dependence comes from the smearing of the fermi surface .    at first glance , it is not obvious that the results for clean bilayer graphene ( left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : main ] ) and dirty bilayer graphene ( right panel ) are closely related . however",
    ", if we consider scaling the conductivity as @xmath34 , scaling temperature as @xmath35 , where we define @xmath36 , and scaling carrier density as @xmath37 , we find that for both the linear band dispersion @xmath38 and the parabolic band dispersion @xmath39 , the scaled functions @xmath40 each follow a universal curve .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",

    "[ fig : expts ] ) and choose @xmath17 to fix the value of @xmath46 at @xmath47 . then using @xmath48 to scale the temperature , all of the results lie on top of the theoretical curve computed using the hyperbolic dispersion , see fig .  [ fig : expts ] . the theoretical curve with which they agree",
    "is distinct from similar curves calculated for a linear dispersion and for the purely parabolic dispersion at high @xmath0 .",
    "we note that the scaling function is more complicated than a line .",
    "the calculation reproduces not only the initial slope as a function of temperature , but the crossover to higher temperature behavior . for the parabolic dispersion , which agrees at low temperatures , the conductivity extrapolates from @xmath49 at low temperature to @xmath50 at high temperature , with a crossover temperature scale of @xmath51 . in the future",

    "@xcite    = 1.0    one feature of fig .",
    "[ fig : main ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : expts ] is that for most of the experimentally relevant regime , the temperature dependence of the conductivity calculated using the parabolic approximation provides an adequate solution .",
    "this limit has been treated in contemporaneous work  @xcite treating this problem with different approximations and reaching similar conclusions . to better understand the emergence of a universal scaling form",
