    "amadeus @xcite ( antares modules for acoustic detection under the sea ) is a system for acoustic detection within the antares @xcite ( astronomy with a neutrino telescope and abyss environmental ressearch ) infrastructure .",
    "the former is designed to investigate the feasibility of acoustic detection of ultra high energy neutrinos .",
    "the antares experiment is located @xmath0 km off the southern french coast at a water depth of @xmath1 m and consists of @xmath2 vertical support structures , so called lines , of @xmath3 m length .",
    "they are anchored to the sea floor over an area of about @xmath4m@xmath5 , held vertically by buoys and support a total of @xmath6 photo - multipliers .",
    "an additional line , the instrumentation line , is used for environmental monitoring and multidisciplinary research .",
    "the amadeus system consists of six local clusters of six sensors each .",

    ", scaledwidth=49.0% ]    amadeus was designed to investigate short and long distance correlations , study the deep sea noise , signal filtering and source positions reconstruction techniques , all necessary to evaluate the feasibility of acoustic particle detection with a possible future large volume detector .",
    "using local clusters allows for correlation studies ranging from about @xmath7 m to @xmath8 m , and also offers the advantage of quick direction reconstruction , thereby simplifying source position reconstruction .",
    "each of the six local clusters of amadeus comprises six hydrophones .",
    "the hydrophones within a local cluster have typical distances of @xmath7 m between the sensors and thus a transit time of @xmath9ms for an acoustic wave front .",
    "this allows for quick direction reconstruction of a passing pressure wave .",
    "two methods for direction reconstruction with the individual clusters will be discussed .",
    "one of the methods is beamforming and the other one uses the time differences of the detected signals in the individual acoustic sensors of a storey .",
    "this method requires the knowledge of the hydrophone positions , within a cluster , as well as synchronized data .",
    "beamforming is done by creating a sound intensity plot scanning all directions in space ( @xmath10 ) for the actual source direction .",
    "given the six hydrophone coordinates @xmath11 , the signal @xmath12 of every hydrophone will be shifted in time corresponding to the difference in path length of the sound wave reaching the respective hydrophone .",
    "hence every direction in space corresponds to a set of time differences @xmath13 in the data . for a direction @xmath14 , the beam - forming output at time @xmath15",
    "is given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 represent weighting factors for every individual hydrophone .",
    "these factors are adjusted to match the directional sensitivity of each hydrophones . for the following calculations",
    "@xmath18 was used .",
    "the time differences @xmath13 are computed assuming a plane wave .",
    "the algorithm scans @xmath10 with a predefined step size in @xmath19 by applying the calculated time differences to the data , assuming a constant speed of sound .",
    "once all directions are scanned , the maximum value of the produced output identifies the direction of the signal . for this direction",
    "all signals are shifted such that they add up constructively .",
    "the application of the algorithm increases the signal to noise ratio for the direction the signal comes from , creating the mentioned maximum .",
    "figure [ fig : beam ] shows the output of the beamforming algorithm applied to the signal in fig .",
    "[ fig : sig ] .    the beam - forming output ( fig .",
    "[ fig : beam ] ) shows a well defined maximum at @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the error is governed by the binning of the algorithm and not by the algorithm itself . local maxima and the visible patterns in fig . [",

    "[ fig : sig ] the maximum , indicating the signal direction , can be identified at @xmath22 and @xmath23.,scaledwidth=49.0% ]    the advantage of this method is that it can be applied to untriggered data .",
    "a disadvantage of this method is that it is rather time consuming .",
    "another method for directional reconstruction is using the time differences between signals , detected by the hydrophones in a cluster , of a passing pressure wave .",
    "this method requires , in addition to the knowledge of the hydrophone position and synchronized data , a signal identification .",
    "once a signal is identified , e.g. by a simple threshold trigger for large signal amplitudes , the signal arrival times are used for the direction reconstruction .",
    "direction reconstruction is done by comparing the measured signal times to expected signal arrival times .",
    "the expected time @xmath24 for an arriving wave front is taken from a lookup table and subtracted from the measured time .",
    "that is done for @xmath10 in the desired angular resolution , where the minimum indicates the reconstructed direction :    @xmath25    this technique is similar to beam - forming , but much faster . applied to the data in fig .",
    "[ fig : sig ] the algorithm produces the @xmath26 data shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : chix ] and [ fig : chiy ] . a clear minimum can be identified in both @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",

    ", scaledwidth=49.0% ]    though the time difference method is much faster , beam - forming has the advantage of not having to identify a signal .",
    "figure [ fig : sky ] shows a qualitative mapping of the arrival directions of transient acoustic signals originating in the surrounding of the antares detector .",
    "the direction reconstruction was done using the time difference method .",
    "the data is from the time period 29.01.2008 to 05.06.2008 , using a minimum bias trigger which is taking unfiltered data for 10 seconds every 30 minutes . taking this data set ,",
    "the directions of all included signals with an amplitude greater than @xmath32rms ( about 200000 signals ) were reconstructed .",
    "the rms was calculated for a @xmath33s time interval around the signal time .",
    "a virtual observer residing on the second cluster from the bottom of the @xmath34 , about @xmath35 m above the sea bed , looking westward towards the horizon of the storey , is defining the origin of the coordinate system , see fig .",
    "[ fig : sky ] . thus @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) in longitude ( @xmath38 ) is north ( south ) , while @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) in latitude ( @xmath27 ) is looking upwards ( downwards ) .",
    "as expected , the majority of the signals is coming from above the detector , including all kinds of transient signals , as e.g. produced by dolphins .",
    "in the lower hemisphere a few sources can be seen amongst which a clear structure can be identified .",
    "the signals between @xmath39 and @xmath40 in @xmath28 and @xmath41 to @xmath42 in @xmath27 originate from the antares acoustic positioning system , emitting signals at the bottom of each string .     a qualitative mapping of the arrival directions of transient acoustic signals .",
    "the majority of the signals come from above . in the lower hemisphere",
    "the antares acoustic position system can be identified .",
    ", scaledwidth=49.0% ]",
    "for a given local cluster such as in the amadeus setup , directions are the prime observables of acoustic signals .",
    "the identified directions then allow for a simple source position reconstruction .",
    "after the successful direction reconstruction , each antenna @xmath43 that detected a signal will point to a direction @xmath44 identifying where an event came from .",
    "since the cluster positions @xmath45 are known , one obtains a line pointing to the event for each cluster , @xmath46 the source position of a signal is theoretically given by the intersection point of the lines @xmath47 . due to inherent uncertainties in the direction reconstruction , mainly due to the one degree grid ,",
    "the source location is where the lines are closest to each other .",
    "localising the point of closest approach for all lines is realized by calculating the square distance from a point @xmath48 to the reconstructed lines ,    @xmath49    and minimising the sum of these distances .",
    "since the cluster positioning and orientation was not yet implemented , a full source position reconstruction was not possible at the time of this analysis .",
    "however , as the tilts of the local clusters , induced by the sea current , are small , in the order of one degree , it is possible to reconstruct the @xmath27 angle with that uncertainty . the circles in fig .",
    "[ fig : source ] represent the possible solutions of a source given by the reconstructed @xmath27 angle and the distance of each storey to the sea floor .",
    "the signal origin can clearly be identified as the acoustic positioning emitter of the 7th line ( l7 ) , as can also be deduced from the signal properties .",
