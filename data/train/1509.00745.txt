    "statistics of binaries and hierarchical stellar systems trace conditions of star formation and serve as an excellent diagnostic for testing theoretical predictions and numerical simulations .",
    "only recently have observational techniques such as adaptive optics ( ao ) and radial velocities ( rv ) reached the maturity and productivity needed for a high quality binary census over a wide range of periods .",
    "the latest results on binary statistics are reviewed by @xcite .",
    "reaching completeness for triple and higher - order hierarchies is even more challenging .",
    "the fraction of known hierarchical systems in the nearby 25-pc volume has doubled recently @xcite in comparison with the earlier work by @xcite .",
    "large space volume and large samples are needed for their statistical study as the fraction of triples is only 14% @xcite . however , observing thousands of targets by complementary techniques would require prohibitive amounts of telescope and calendar time unless an intelligent strategy is applied . as noted by @xcite ,",
    "new observations mostly convert binaries into triples .",
    "so , focusing on known binaries and quantifying the presence of additional components ( hence hierarchies ) is a productive approach .",
    "it was adopted in the massive multiplicity survey of solar - type stars conducted in 20122013 with the robo - ao instrument at the palomar 60-inch telescope @xcite ; hereafter r15 .",
    "that survey looked for subsystems in the faint secondary components and for distant tertiary companions to known binaries with fg primaries within 67 pc .",
    "the full sample is described in @xcite .",
    "we report here the beginings of follow - up observations to the r15 survey at the palomar 5 m telescope .",
    "our goal is to both confirm the newly discovered subsystems with infrared ( ir ) imagery and to combine that ir imagery with the robo - ao observations in @xmath3 band .",
    "multi - color photometry allows us to place the secondaries on a color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) to test their physical relation to the main target . for systems with high proper motion ( pm )",
    ", the second - epoch astrometry within a year allows discrimination between physical binaries and unrelated optical companions .",
    "this is most critical for wide binaries because the probability of interlopers is proportional to the square of the separation .",
    "however , many new pairs with separations on the order of 5  also need confirmation , particularly near the galactic plane where the density of stars is high . at this time",
    ", we have only been able to collect data on a portion of the companions detected in r15 ; future observations will cover the other systems .",
    "quite unexpectedly , observations with palm-3000 resolved several subsystems missed by the robo - ao instrument in r15 because their companions were either too close or too faint .",
    "the old rule about new techniques bringing new discoveries is once again verified .",
    "the observations and data reduction are covered in section  [ sec : obs ] . in section  [ sec : ptm ] we derive individual magnitudes and colors of the components and place them on the cmd .",
    "each multiple system is commented on in section  [ sec : ind ] .",
    "discussion and conclusions are in section  [ sec : disc ] .",
    "we observed the stars on 2013 september 28 ut with the palomar observatory hale 5 m telescope using the palm-3000 ao system and the pharo near - ir camera .",
    "the palm-3000 ao system is a natural guide - star system using two deformable mirrors @xcite .",
    "one corrects low - amplitude high spatial frequency aberrations , while the other corrects the higher - amplitude low spatial frequency aberrations .",
    "it is optimized for high contrast observations and routinely produces strehl ratios greater than 80% in _ ks _ band .",
    "the pharo camera uses a hgcdte hawaii detector for observations between 1 and 2.5  wavelength @xcite .",
    "the camera has multiple filters in two filter wheels .",
    "the filter wheels contain spectral band filters and neutral density filters .",
    "these neutral density filters are used for observing bright stars , which saturated the detector .",
    "unfortunately , both the 1% and the 0.1% nd filter cause ghost reflections which appear as stellar companions .",
    "these ghosts always appear in the same locations and during analysis they are considered to be part of the point spread function .",
    "fifty frames were collected of each object with an exposure time of 1.416 s , the minimum exposure for pharo .",
    "after the observing run , the individual frames were reduced by debiasing , flat fielding , bad pixel correction and background subtraction .",
    "then we created five images by co - adding 10 frames into each image . creating multiple images allowed us to evaluate the precision of the measurements .",
    "the _ fitstars _",
    "algorithm was used to measure the astrometry and photometry of the objects @xcite .",
    "we observed six calibration binaries on the same night as the science targets .",
    "we compared their measured astrometry with the ephemeris predicted from their orbits and used the results to compute the plate scale and the position angle offset , 24.9@xmath40.2 mas pixel@xmath5 and 0.7@xmath40.5@xmath2 error .",
    "the largest error term is the position angle offset . in speckle and ao work on binaries , the measurement errors in tangential and radial directions are usually the same or similar . for the position angle error bar , we quadratically added the position angle offset error with the product of one radian and the ratio of the measurement error to the measured separation .",
    "the separation error bar was computed simarily , with the measurement error summed quadratically with the product of the plate scale error and the separation .",
    "photometric error bars were assigned using the technique described in @xcite .",
    "the resulting photometry and astrometry are presented in table [ results ] .",
    "the table gives the washington double star ( wds ; @xcite ) catalog designation for the system as are the hd and hip numbers for the primary star .",
    "this is followed by the discoverer designation , the observation epoch , the astrometry and the photometry .",
    "new discoveries are marked with a footnote to the wds ddesignation .",
