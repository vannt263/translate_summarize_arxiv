    "the authors of @xcite argued that if entanglement is absent in a quantum algorithm , then the algorithm can be classically simulated with an equivalent amount of classical resources . on the other hand ,",
    "quantum computations are closely connected with only one or few prescribed bases , in which states of the register are naturally represented . in order to analyze the quantum computational speed - up",

    "each ket @xmath2 of the calculational basis is indexed by binary @xmath0-string with @xmath3 . a rigorous framework for the quantification of coherence",

    "we consider the set @xmath4 of all diagonal density matrices written as @xmath5 one further asks how far the given state is from those states that are completely incoherent in this basis .",
    "the authors of @xcite listed general conditions for quantifiers of coherence .",

    "it then follows from ( [ c1for ] ) that the relative entropy of coherence does not exceed @xmath16 .",
    "basic properties of the quantity ( [ c1df ] ) are discussed in @xcite .",
    "uncertainty relations in terms of the relative entropy of coherence were derived in @xcite .",
    "other coherence monotones could be considered .",
    "coherence monotones of the tsallis type were examined in @xcite .",
    "relative rnyi entropies of coherence were studied in @xcite . however , these quantifiers do not reduce to a simple form similar to the expression ( [ c1for ] ) .",

    ", we define @xmath18 using the quantity ( [ cel1 ] ) , complementarity and uncertainty relations for quantum coherence were studied in @xcite . in the context of amplitude amplification , however , the @xmath17-norm of coherence seems to not very convenient . even in simple cases relations between this coherence quantifier and the success probability",
    "are sufficiently complicated .",
    "another intuitive way is to use the squared @xmath19-norm .",
    "however , the corresponding coherence quantifier does not satisfy the monotonicity requirement @xcite .",
    "the trace norm also induces an interesting candidate for quantification of coherence @xcite .",

    "the corresponding coherence quantifier was studied in @xcite .",
    "other coherence quantifiers were considered in the literature @xcite .",
    "let us recall some results concerning generalizations of grover s algorithm . in our calculations , we will follow the scheme of analysis developed in @xcite .",
    "suppose that the search space contains @xmath1 items indexed by binary @xmath0-string @xmath26 with @xmath3 so that @xmath27 .",

    "checking each concrete item is realized through an oracle - computable boolean function @xmath31 such that @xmath32 for @xmath29 and @xmath33 for @xmath34 .",
    "the original grover algorithm starts with initializing @xmath0-qubit register to @xmath35 and applying the hadamard transform to get a uniform amplitude distribution @xmath36 following @xcite , we will use phase rotations of two different classes .",
    "rotations of the first class non - trivially act on unknown marked states . for an arbitrary phase @xmath37 , we define @xmath38 thus , the operation ( [ rojf ] ) rotates all the marked states by the phase @xmath37 . for @xmath39",
    ", we have @xmath40 for @xmath32 .",
    "this phase rotation is used in the original grover algorithm .",
    "its realization with invoking the oracle black box is well explained in the literature .",
    "rotations of the second class rotate some prescribed state @xmath41 of the bases . for any phase @xmath42",
    ", one reads @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the identity operator .",
    "so , the ket @xmath41 is rotated by @xmath42 , whereas other basis kets remain unchanged .",
    "one of the well known ingredients of grover s algorithm can be written as @xmath45 clothing ( [ roj0 ] ) by the hadamard transforms , we obtain the inversion about the average .    in the original formulation , the grover iteration is written as @xmath46 for several reasons , generalizations of grover s original algorithm have been developed . in the generalized formulation ,",
    "the operation ( [ sgit0 ] ) is replaced by @xmath47 with arbitrary @xmath42 and @xmath37 . here , the hadamard transform on @xmath0 qubits is replaced by an arbitrary unitary operator . to the given @xmath41 and @xmath48 ,",
    "we assign @xmath49 , whence @xmath50 so , the effects of both @xmath48 and @xmath41 is summarized in a single term @xmath51 .",
    "after @xmath52 iterations , the state of the quantum register is represented as @xmath53 iterations of the form ( [ sgit1 ] ) will be applied to an arbitrary initial distribution of amplitudes @xmath54 .",
    "any single iteration changes amplitudes according to the equations @xmath55 where @xmath29 and @xmath56 .",
    "these equation are accompanied by initial amplitudes @xmath57 and @xmath58 of marked and unmarked items , respectively . the authors of @xcite have examined the above recursion equations .",
    "their results required for us are summarized in appendix [ apa ] .",
    "we will use them to exemplify relations between quantum coherence and the success probability in amplitude amplification .",
    "in this section , we focus on general relations that enlighten the role of coherence changes in amplitude amplification . in practice ,",
    "computing devices are inevitably exposed to noise .",
    "in this situation , the state of a quantum register after @xmath52 steps is described by density matrix @xmath59 .",
    "then the probability to measure one of the marked state is written as @xmath60 amplitude amplification technique aims to magnify amplitudes of desired states unknown _ a priori_. each good algorithm of the considered type should provide such an amplification . in order to increase the success probability @xmath61 , a coherence of the register should be used somehow . for the original formulation of grover s algorithm ,",
    "this issue was addressed in @xcite .",
    "we will analyze the problem in more general setting .",
    "in addition , the geometric coherence was not utilized in this context .    using the geometric coherence ,",
    "we observe its very immediate link with the probability of success . in the case of pure states ,",
    "the geometric coherence is expressed by ( [ cgpr ] ) .",
    "we first suppose that only one amplitude should be maximized a particular problem of amplitude amplification .",
    "this situation is sufficiently typical , but not general . for a time",
    ", we also assume that states of a quantum register are pure during the performance of algorithm .",
    "after a proper number of algorithm steps , amplitudes in some superposition @xmath62 should become sufficiently small , except for the unique one .",
    "hence , we have observed a direct complementarity relation , @xmath63 in other words , under accepted circumstances increase of the success probability implies decreasing the geometric coherence , and _",
    "vice versa_. thus , quantum coherence with respect to the calculation basis seems to be a key resource in amplitude amplification . in the form of inequality",
    ", we can exceed the above relation to mixed states of a quantum register and arbitrary number of marked states .",

    "@xmath69    returning to the case of amplitude amplification , we see the following .",
    "if the success probability is determined by the unique state of the calculation basis , i.e. , @xmath70 , then @xmath71 in reality , states of the quantum register are inevitably exposed to noise . with some amount even small",
    ", they will become mixed .",
    "so , the trade - off relation between quantum coherence and the success probability may only be restricted here .",
    "it should be noted that the geometric coherence is not a coherence measure in the sense that is proposed by the authors of @xcite .",
    "they added the list of axioms for coherence quantifiers by two items called the uniqueness for pure states and the additivity . in this regard , we are also interested in relations of the success probability with other coherence quantifiers .",
    "the coherence quantifier based on the relative entropy is one of the most natural measure for these purposes . at the same time , this measure is not connected with @xmath72 so immediately as the geometric coherence . here , the following statement holds .",

    "combining this with the definition of @xmath82 completes the proof of the right - hand side of ( [ renp02 ] ) .",
    "let us proceed to the left - hand side of ( [ renp02 ] ) .",
    "we first observe that @xmath83 applying jensen s inequality to convex function @xmath84 then gives @xmath85 for all @xmath29 and @xmath56 , we have @xmath86 and @xmath87 , whence @xmath88 combining the latter with ( [ twos2 ] ) and decreasing of the function @xmath84 finally gives @xmath89 .",

    "of course , such a picture relates to good algorithms , which ensure high chances for the success . in a general scenario of amplitude amplification ,",
    "we have herewith seen complementarity between coherence and the success probability .",
    "for the fixed @xmath65 , a difference between the lower and upper bounds mainly depends on the ratio @xmath93 .",
    "the less this ratio is , the less width of coherence variations is given by the two - sided estimate ( [ renp02 ] ) .",
    "the following observation concerns the presented upper bound . inspecting the sign of derivative , we see that the right - hand side of ( [ renp02 ] ) decreases with @xmath72 on the interval @xmath94 .",
    "the value @xmath93 gives the success probability in the trivial algorithm of random choice of items , when no amplification actually takes place . over this value ,",
    "any increase of the success probability will lead to decreasing range of allowed changes of quantum coherence with respect to the calculation basis . to reach sufficiently high values of @xmath72 , an algorithm of amplitude amplification",
    "should somehow provide a coherence depletion .",
    "note also that the right - hand side of ( [ renp02 ] ) is saturated in some examples of amplitude amplification .",
    "thus , this upper bound can not be improved without including additional parameters into a consideration .",

    "the inequality ( [ renp03 ] ) holds under the additional condition ( [ acon ] ) . for @xmath95",
    ", it provides a stronger bound on the relative entropy of coherence . in principle , the condition ( [ acon ] ) is sufficiently natural for a good technique of amplitude amplification .",
    "it may also be caused by prior evidences recorded in the initial amplitude distribution .",

    "this rescaling could be expected here , since the @xmath17-norm of coherence can reach values up to @xmath107 @xcite , whereas the geometric coherence can not exceed @xmath23 . in the context of original grover s algorithm ,",
    "the relation ( [ albe4 ] ) was presented in @xcite .",
    "we only note that the result ( [ albe4 ] ) reflects no more than a `` boxcar '' distribution of amplitudes .",
    "it is instructive to address the case , in which only one of desired states has relatively large amplitude .",
    "so , we suppose that @xmath108 for the unique @xmath109 and @xmath110 for all other @xmath111 in both the sets @xmath28 and @xmath78 .",
    "situations of such a kind may occur in amplitude amplification with _ a priori _ knowledge , for instance , in the initial amplitude distribution . here",

    "we usually expect to reach values @xmath96 . in the interval @xmath115 , the right - hand side of ( [ albe7 ] ) decreases with growth of @xmath72 .",
    "thus , the @xmath17-norm of coherence and the success probability should be mutually complementary , at least for good algorithms with high chances for success .",

    "concerning this situation , some results were reported in @xcite .",
    "we will focus on those aspects that are not addressed therein .",
    "let us consider the consistent initial distribution such that @xmath175 here , the parameter @xmath176 is not integer and may deviate from @xmath158 in both sides . for @xmath120 ,",
    "the weights @xmath177 and @xmath178 are defined by ( [ wtelb ] ) .",
    "also , the rescaled initial amplitudes are written as ( [ klrest ] ) . similarly to ( [ sicosb ] ) , we put the parameter @xmath179 such that @xmath180 hence , we write the rescaled initial amplitudes @xmath181 we also have @xmath133 just as in the original formulation .",
    "so , we merely substitute the new initial amplitudes ( [ kax0b0 ] ) and ( [ ely0b0 ] ) into the previous formulas .",
    "the resulting expressions read @xmath182 similarly to ( [ wkwlfo ] ) and ( [ wkwket ] ) , the averaged amplitudes are written as @xmath183 these expressions also give the amplitudes @xmath140 for @xmath29 and @xmath156 for @xmath56 . taking into account ( [ sicos0 ] ) ,",
    "one then obtains @xmath184 similarly to ( [ twopb ] ) , we now write the probabilities @xmath185 when @xmath146 , for the geometric coherence we again have ( [ fidp01fo ] ) .",
    "the success probability is first maximized for @xmath52 equal to one of the two numbers @xmath186 with growth of @xmath187 in ( [ etxy ] ) , the term @xmath188 also increases .",
    "it may reduce a number of iterations due to prior knowledge in prepared initial distribution of amplitudes .",
    "the situation is opposite for @xmath189 , when reaching the maximum of the success probability demand more iterations . in comparison with ( [ twoin ] ) ,",
    "the numbers ( [ twoinb0 ] ) are changed by means of @xmath179 in the numerator . in both the situations , @xmath188 and @xmath190",

    "in other words , an amplification process is balanced so that the right - hand side of ( [ renp02 ] ) is saturated .",
    "this claim easily follows from ( [ klb0 ] ) .",
    "we have again seen the role of consistency in amplitude amplification .",
    "indeed , states are evenly amplified in @xmath28 and attenuated in @xmath78 .",
    "finally , we consider an unbalanced case , in which consistency of states in amplitude amplification is broken .",
    "suppose that the amplitudes of the state @xmath51 can take only two different values , @xmath191 where @xmath192 .",
    "we further assume that @xmath158 is even and the values ( [ varpm ] ) are distributed as follows . for items",

    ", we also put @xmath196 for one half and @xmath197 for other half of items @xmath56 .",
    "then the weights @xmath177 and @xmath178 satisfy ( [ wtel0 ] ) .    for the uniform initial distribution ,",
    "the rescaled initial amplitudes are written as @xmath198 by substituting , the initial averaged amplitudes then read @xmath199 unlike the above balanced cases , the initial differences take non - zero values , namely @xmath200 since @xmath201 , we can obtain the coefficients @xmath202 , @xmath203 , @xmath204 , @xmath205 as follows .",
    "the expressions ( [ xi12fo ] ) and ( [ xi34fo ] ) should all be multiplied by the factor @xmath206 .",

    "doing some calculations , the desired probabilities are finally expressed as follows . for @xmath209",

    "the probabilities of interest are finally expressed as @xmath211 further , the relative entropy of coherence is represented as @xmath212 since the action of ( [ sgit2 ] ) is not balanced , the relation between @xmath174 and @xmath61 does not follow ( [ coh000 ] ) . due to an inconsistency in amplitude amplification ,",
    "coherence reducing is not used in the most efficient way .",
    "a similar picture occurs with inconsistent prior knowledge in the initial distribution .",
    "we refrain from presenting the details here .",
    "to illustrate the above conclusions , we now visualize @xmath174 versus @xmath52 for a some simple choice of parameters .",
    "since the relative entropy of coherence satisfies @xmath213 we will also present both the sides of this two - sided estimation .",

    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] , we visualize some quantities for the case @xmath217 , @xmath218 , and @xmath215 . in fig .",

    "for comparison , the success probability is also given in original formulation , when @xmath216 .",
    "we see that an inconsistency of amplitudes of the state @xmath51 leads to some decreasing of the probability peaks . on the other hand , reaching one or another peak requires the same number of iteration as in the original formulation .",
    "we also observe that the trade - off line between @xmath174 and the success probability does not follow the upper bound exactly .",
    "dealing with marked and unmarked states inconsistently , this form of amplitude amplification can not always use coherence changes in the most efficient way . using fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we can also estimate a quality of bounds in the two - sided estimate ( [ renp02 ] ) .",

    "general trade - off relations between quantum coherence and the success probability were derived .",
    "it seems that the geometric coherence and the relative entropy of coherence are more convenient quantifiers in this context . in comparison with the geometric coherence ,",
    "the relative entropy of coherence is recognized as more sensitive . using the success probability as a key parameter",
    ", we obtained a two - sided estimate on the relative entropy of coherence .",
    "this result describes a band of allowed values of quantum coherence .",
    "basic conclusions are supported by explicit consideration of several model scenarios of amplitude amplification .",
    "coherence changes can be used in the most efficient way only when marked and unmarked states are dealt with consistently . in other words , the computing process does not distinguish between the marked states as well as between the unmarked ones .",
    "then any coherence decreasing will amplify the success probability as much as possible .",
    "otherwise , there is a difference between concrete marked states and , maybe , between concrete unmarked states . in this unbalanced case",
    ", the relative entropy of coherence does not reach always its maximal value approved by the two - sided estimate for the given value of the success probability .",
