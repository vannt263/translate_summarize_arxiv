    "there have been many theoretical speculations regarding the nature of the above exotic dark energy . indeed , many authors claim that a real scalar field which rolls down the potential @xmath2 @xcite could resemble the dark energy .",
    "on the other hand , the global dynamics , in models with dark energy , become more complicated than in matter dominated models . within this framework ,",
    "a serious issue is the existence ( or nonexistence ) of chaos in the scalar field cosmology .",

    "the aim of this work is to investigate the dynamical properties of a family of cosmological models based on a scalar field potential which appears to act both as a dark matter and dark energy @xcite . in order to measure the amount of chaos we follow the notation of ref.@xcite that was able to give useful answers to their scattering problem .",

    "( [ eqp1a ] ) ) . if @xmath52 then there are again no equilibrium points .",
    "the physical interpretation of the non existence of equilibrium points when the universe is flat or has negative curvature is that the universe can not collapse therefore there is no other flow in the phase space than the one which starts with @xmath57 and tends to @xmath58 .    for both cases of @xmath25 at the equilibrium point the eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenvectors are : @xmath59 due to the restriction ( [ potcon1 ] )",
    "the eigenvalues of ( [ eig1 ] ) are imaginary , but due to the restriction ( [ potcon2 ] ) the eigenvalues of ( [ eig2 ] ) are real , so we have a saddle - center instability .",
    "the saddle shape is displayed on the @xmath36 , @xmath60 plane .",
    "notice that , although the existence and the position of the equilibrium point depend from the curvature s value , the eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenvectors for the equilibrium point are independent from the curvature .",
    "the detection of chaos ( see @xcite for a review ) is a topic for which many tools have been developed .",
    "these methods can be separated in two main categories .",
    "tools which exploit the properties of the deviation vector and tools that are based upon a frequency analysis . in this paper",
    "we use tools of the first category .",
    "the deviation vector @xmath61 is defined as the solution of the variational equations of the system .",
    "a classical tool for the detection of chaos is the lyapunov characteristic number ( lcn ) : @xmath62 where : @xmath63 is the `` finite time lcn '' .",
    "the orbits with @xmath64 are called chaotic , while the orbits with lcn=0 are called ordered .",
    "a similar useful quantity is the stretching number @xcite , also called the lyapunov indicator @xcite : @xmath65 in scattering problems when orbits escape from the region where they behave stochastically , and then get far away from this region , they diverge from nearby orbits linearly .",
    "therefore the lcn is zero .",
    "the latter behavior is also a characteristic of regular orbits . hence if we entrust entirely the lcn in scattering problems we may characterize as regular those orbits , that in a certain region exhibit stochastic behavior . however in our paper , in order to study chaos we use also the evolution of the stretching number , as done in ref .",
    "this method is based on the idea that when an orbit in a chaotic scattering problem passes through a stochastic region of the phase space the average value of stretching varies around a positive number , even if afterwards it tends to a value near zero .",
    "the solid black line corresponds to the the udm model with @xmath66 and initial conditions @xmath67 . note that the scale factor scaled to unity at the present time . ]    in the present section we investigate numerically the system of the rw coupled with a scalar field when the energy @xmath68 is zero .",
    "our investigation refers mainly to the case @xmath38 following the notations of @xcite . note that in the appendix we present results for the case @xmath69 .",
    "if we introduce the noncanonical transformation ( @xmath70 ) @xmath71 then the hamiltonian ( [ hamxy1 ] ) gives : @xmath72\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the hamiltonian ( [ hamxy2 ] ) for @xmath73 transforms in the same way .",
    "the only difference is that we have to change the sign of @xmath74 in ( [ hamxy1 ] ) . so as regards the parameter @xmath8 for @xmath75 we may consider only one value of k ( here @xmath76 , hereafter called semi - flat case ) , because the transformation ( [ noncant ] ) shows that any case of @xmath8 can be transformed to another .",
    "however , we must stress that the time rescales as @xmath77 by the above transformation . for other values of the curvature @xmath78 the value of @xmath79",
    "must be multiplied by @xmath77 .",
    "the reason we choose the semi - flat value of @xmath78 is that the analysis of the recent observations of the cosmic microwave backround ( cmb ) anisotropies indicates that the spatial curvature of the universe takes a quite small positive value ( @xmath80 ) very close to zero @xcite .",
    "our aim in this work is to investigate whether a small variation of the curvature around its nominal value ( @xmath23 ) could affect the global dynamics of the universe .",
    "we do not present the cases where @xmath81 because of the recent observational data .",
    "furthermore , in the case of the flat universe the two oscillators are uncoupled so the system is integrable .    in the case of two coupled hyperbolic oscillators we select @xmath82 and @xmath83 for our parameters , which means that the potential ( [ potent ] ) is simply @xmath84 .",
    "even such a simple parameterization produces a variety of orbits . in order to show this variety when @xmath66 we choose five representative orbits .",
    "the initial conditions of these orbits are : 1 ) @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , 2 ) @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath88 , 3 ) @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath89 , 4 ) @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath90 , 5 ) @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath91 .",
    "for all these orbits @xmath92 is evaluated by using eq .",
    "( [ hamxy1 ] ) with @xmath93 and by choosing the negative sign in front of the square root of @xmath94 .",
    "figure [ fighhaft]a shows the scalar field @xmath9 as a function of the logarithm of the scale factor @xmath95 for our five orbits and in the fig .",
    "[ fighhaft]b the logarithm of the scale factor as a function of the logarithm of time @xmath96 .",
    "we see that the orbits 1 , 2 , 3 refer to universes that recollapse , therefore these orbits describe examples of closed universes .",
    "on the other hand the orbits 4 and 5 refer to universes that expand to infinity , which means that even with a positive curvature we get cosmological models which expand for ever ( see ref .",
    "it is obvious that as the curvature @xmath78 increases the orbits which describe closed universes will reach bigger values of the scale factor before they collapse , which also suggests that they will collapse after a longer time .",
    "it is interesting to mention that for those orbits which are in between 4 and 5 the scale factor of the universe initially goes as @xmath97 , then for a certain interval of time as @xmath98 , and finally accelerates exponentially . in order to scale the dynamic time t of the system to the real time @xmath99 in gyears",
    ", we fit our numerical results for the orbit 5 to the observational data . that way we find the relations @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "although , the @xmath31 coordinate system is the physically straight forward for the present problem , the @xmath32 system gives a more clear insight to the problem .",
    "thus in fig .",
    "[ fighhxy]a we present the projections of the orbits on the @xmath36 , @xmath60 plane , while in fig .",
    "[ fighhxy]b we give the projections of the orbits on the @xmath37 , @xmath102 plane . in the @xmath36 ,",
    "@xmath60 plane the orbits 1 , 2 , 3 start from @xmath103 and finally return to @xmath104 .",
    "this is expected simply because these orbits model recollapsing universes @xmath105 .",
    "the orbits 4 and 5 describe expanding cases where @xmath36 , like the scale factor , tends to infinity and @xmath106 .",
    "the form of our orbits in the @xmath37 , @xmath107 plane are similar , except for the orbit 4 which , instead of giving @xmath108 returns to @xmath109 with @xmath110 .",
    "this means that the orbit 4 is essentially driven by the @xmath111 , @xmath92 oscillator which gains all the energy while the @xmath37 , @xmath102 motion ceases to exist .",
    "thus , the case of orbit 4 shows explicitely that the two coupled oscillators exchange energy .",
    "the energy exchange takes place due to the coupling term .",
    "the question which arises now is if this exchange is done in a regular way or if it is done stochastically . to address this question we used the variational equations of ( [ eqmot1 ] ) to calculate the evolution of the stretching numbers and of the finite time lcn `` @xmath112 '' through time .    doing so , in fig .",
    "[ fighhch ] we present our results : in fig.[fighhch]a is shown the stretching number ( hereafter `` sn '' ) versus the logarithm of time @xmath113 and in fig.[fighhch]b the logarithm of @xmath112 ( @xmath114 ) versus the logarithm of time @xmath113 .",
    "the dashed line in the fig.[fighhch]b represents the inclination @xmath115 which is followed by the regular orbits as the lcn tends to 0 .",
    "this dashed line helps us to separate the regular from the chaotic orbits , because the regular orbits always evolve along a parallel line , though usually with some variations around the line , while the chaotic orbits change after a certain time point their inclination from -1 to 0 as the @xmath112 tends to a finite value .",
    "for all the considered orbits fig [ fighhch]a the `` sn '' stays for most of the time above 0 and this indicates that for all five orbits @xmath112 should be positive , therefore there is a strong indication that these orbits are chaotic .",
    "this conclusion seems to agree with the results which we see also for the orbits 4 and 5 in fig .",
    "[ fighhch]b , but the orbits 1 , 2 and 3 are not so clear cases because they recollapse . in particular , the expanding to infinity orbits 4 and 5 appear to be chaotic .",
    "their @xmath112 ( see fig . [",
    "fighhch]b ) tends to a finite nonzero value @xmath116 and the `` sn '' is on the average positive .",
    "this finite @xmath112 value is the eigenvalue @xmath117 ( [ eig2 ] ) of the unstable manifold , which emanates from the equilibrium point , for @xmath118 .",
    "notice that this eigenvalue does not depend on the curvature , hence for any positive curvature in the case under study we expect that the chaotic orbits will have the same @xmath119 .",
    "this expectation was numerically attested for several orders of magnitude of the curvature s value in the case @xmath118 .",
    "this is true if the orbits do not recollapse .",
    "if the orbits recollapse before the @xmath120 indicator can decide whether they are chaotic , then the `` sn '' is the only indicator that can suggest the chaoticity of these orbits . in the case of the orbits 1 , 2 and 3 ( fig .",
    "[ fighhch]a ) the `` sn '' indeed indicates that these orbits are chaotic .",
    "the recollapse for the orbits 1,2 and 3 in figs .",
    "[ fighhch]a , b can be observed by an abrupt change of `` sn '' and @xmath112 indicators respectively . at the recollapse",
    "both indicators values start to fall , abruptly for orbits 1 and 2 , marginally for orbit 3 , before they steeply rise and become infinite .",
    "the fall of the indicators at the recollapse is explained by the fact that when an orbit falls to the anomaly @xmath121 the position variables tend to stabilize , thus the deviations of the position variables shrink and the deviation vector s norm gets smaller .",
    "as long as the value of the deviation vector s norm decreases , the `` sn '' becomes more and more negative and therefore the @xmath120 value decreases .",
    "however , as the moving point gets nearer to the anomaly the momentum variables start to grow and their deviations expand .",
    "this means that the deviation vector s norm increases , thus the `` sn '' increases and the @xmath120 value rises . because the momentum variables grow abruptly the rise of `` sn '' and @xmath112 is steep .",
    "we should state here that the anomalies produced by the recollapse could be avoided by a logarithmic transformation of the time , as done in the mixmaster problem ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "however , we do not discuss here the usefulness of such a transformation , because the recent high quality cosmological data show that the universe is expanding accelerated to infinity and does not recollapse .",
    "we emphasize that the final value of @xmath112 does not depend on the curvature s value @xmath78 . hence cosmological models for any positive value of @xmath78 reveal a chaotic behavior in contrast with the pure flat models ( @xmath23 ) . as a special case",
    ", semiflat models ( @xmath76 ) with the characteristics close to orbits 4 and 5 predict an overall dynamics which is close to the @xmath1 cosmology , cosmology the scale factor of the universe is @xmath122 and the hubble parameter is @xmath123 . in this work",
    "we use @xmath124kms@xmath125mpc@xmath125 @xcite and @xmath126 @xcite . ] despite the fact that for these udm cosmological paradigms there is a strong indication of a chaotic behavior !",
    "indeed , orbit 5 starts with a state which is similar to the radiation epoch ( @xmath127 ) , then evolves to the matter epoch ( @xmath128 ) and finishes with the exponential growth of the universe     with @xmath129 .",
    "( b ) the orbits projections on the @xmath37 , @xmath102 plane for 4 orbits .",
    "( c ) the development of @xmath130 as a function of the logarithm of time @xmath131 with @xmath132 . ]    on the other hand , it is interesting to mention that the interplay between the values of the initial conditions could yield semiflat udm cosmological models which predict well the observed evolution of the hubble parameter . as an example , in fig .",
    "4 we plot the measured hubble parameter together with a udm scenario ( solid line ) which is formed by the following initial conditions : @xmath133 .",
    "it is obvious that this model reproduces , even better than the @xmath1 cosmology ( dashed line ) , the observational data .",
    "note that the chaotic behavior of this udm paradigm is the same with that found in the case of orbit 5 . in a subsequent paper",
    "we shall investigate statistically the parameter space for models with @xmath134 which fit best the available observational data .",
    "the above result is novel because within the framework of the scalar field cosmology we can find semiflat models with specific initial conditions which reveal chaos and at the same time provide an evolution of the hubble parameter close to the observed one . in any case , we expect that the exact value of the curvature will be finally measured by the next generation of the cmb data ( planck observatory ) and therefore , we can not preclude observational surprises regarding the curvature of the universe .",
    "in this work we investigate the dynamics of the closed scalar field frw cosmological models in the framework of the so called _ unified dark matter _ scenario .",
    "we find that for the closed geometry there is a strong indication of chaos in agreement with previous studies and that the @xmath119 of these models is independent from the curvature .",
    "in particular , we find that there are semiflat cosmological models with specific initial conditions in which there is a clear indication for a chaotic behavior and at the same time the corresponding dynamics is almost the same as in the @xmath1 cosmology .",
    "we verify this by combaning the measured evolution of the hubble parameter with that expected in the scalar field cosmology ( with specific initial conditions ) and we find a very good agreement .",
    "if that is the case , then the chaotic fields may provide an alternative theory for the solution of the cosmological coincidence problem .",
    "g. lukes - gerakopoulos was supported by the greek foundation of state scholarships ( iky ) .",
    "in this kind of dynamical studies , it is well known ( for details see @xcite ) that one of the best procedures to find chaos is based on the so called poincar sections .",
    "unfortunately , in the case of @xmath38 the poincar sections are not applicable , due to the fact that the orbits do not exhibit recurrences . on the other hand , for @xmath43 poincar sections can be obtained because of the elliptic oscillator on @xmath37 , @xmath102 plane and that only if the frequency of the elliptic oscillator is much higher than the frequency of the hyperbolic one . hence in order to achieve the latter we use here @xmath135 and @xmath136 .",

    "<S> we study the dynamics of the closed scalar field frw cosmological models in the framework of the so called _ unified dark matter _ ( udm ) scenario . performing a theoretical as well as a numerical analysis </S>",
    "<S> we find that there is a strong indication of chaos in agreement with previous studies . </S>",
    "<S> we find that a positive value of the spatial curvature is essential for the appearance of chaoticity , though the lyapunov number seems to be independent of the curvature value . </S>",
    "<S> models that are close to flat ( @xmath0 ) exhibit a chaotic behavior after a long time while pure flat models do not exhibit any chaos . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we find that some of the semiflat models in the udm scenario exhibit similar dynamical behavior with the @xmath1 cosmology despite their chaoticity .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we compare the measured evolution of the hubble parameter derived from the differential ages of passively evolving galaxies with that expected in the semiflat unified scalar field cosmology . </S>",
    "<S> based on a specific set of initial conditions we find that the udm scalar field model matches well the observational data . </S>"
