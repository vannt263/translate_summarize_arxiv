    "ultra - dense spatial deployment of cellular base stations is among the most promising ways in which the data capacity of large scale wireless networks is to be enhanced .",
    "the density of this deployment is highly anticipated , as of 2016 , to be around 40 - 50 base stations per km^2^. new technology introduced into these units will result in their communication range falling by an order of magnitude compared to the 4 g base stations which are currently deployed in an ad hoc fashion around our cities .",
    "this is partly due to the appearance of multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) antennas , which offer faster data rates ( gbit / s ) , but utilise over a hundred antennas simultaneously , each at reduced power .    compounding this",
    ", the anticipated high - frequency millimeter wave technologies in the 30 - 300 ghz range will attenuate very quickly , allowing only short range communication between devices . therefore , in order to increase the range of special gateway - enabled cells , networks will have to employ a form of multi - hop , cell - to - cell communication . according to this much anticipated theory , 5 g is therefore likely to consist , at least in part , of densely deployed , millimeter wave connected ` small ' cells routing data from mobile devices between themselves in a sort of daisy chain toward gateway cells , and then finally into the backhaul network , enabling much higher throughput networks .",
    "now , these small cells will form a quasi - random spatially embedded network .",
    "combinatorial analysis of this sort of system has long since been a topic of great research interest . in this thesis ,",
    "we contribute to this growing field by analysing a combinatorial object called a _",
    "random geometric graph _ , an example of which is shown in fig . [",
    "fig : rgg ] , in order to perform statistical network analysis developing future intra - cell communications .",
    "we will focus on two models :    * the * random connection model * , also known as _ soft random geometric graph _",
    ", is a type of random network formed by distributing vertices in a bounded region @xmath2 according to a poisson point process @xmath3 of density @xmath4 , and then adding an edge between points @xmath5 with probability @xmath6 , where @xmath7 $ ] is the connection function , and @xmath8 is the distance between vertices given by some metric . * the * unit disk model * is the limit of this model where the connection function @xmath9 , with @xmath10 the critical range over which vertices connect .",
    "these random graphs have been used to model the following two types of wireless network :        * * ad hoc wireless networks * , where devices communicate , as discussed , between themselves without utilising separate , pre - established infrastructure .",
    "this is achieved by routing data in a ` multi - hop ' fashion between users .",
    "apart from in future 5 g urban networks , they are seen in deployed in disaster zones since they can offer a larger range than simple point - to - point radio communication .",
    "* * wireless sensor networks * , which are densely deployed networks of low - power sensors .",
    "they are used for many different sensing tasks .",
    "wirelessly communicating with each other , sensors with limited battery resources and limited computational performance collect data from an environment and route it in a multi - hop fashion toward an elected _ sink _ sensor .",
    "the sink then sends the collected information toward a cloud or distant base station .",
    "the major result which has lead to such great interest in random networks around the world was published surrounding a 1957 conference on monte carlo techniques in the uk .",
    "broadbent and hammersley showed that a non - trivial , first order phase transition of ` sudden connectivity ' occurred when an array of vertices is adorned at random with links between neighbouring pairs with a critically high probability @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "this is called _ _",
    "percolation__. ] .",
    "interestingly , with an infinite array of vertices , the phase transition is ` sharp ' @xcite .",
    "mathematical study of this simple model has lead to many important results in modern science , with fields medals awarded recently for proving certain results concerning a conformal invariance property of extremely dense lattices exactly at the moment of percolation , called _ criticality _ , and there is currently work ongoing at the compact muon solenoid at cern concerning a similar transition predicted by the lattice gauge theory of quark - gluon plasmas @xcite .",
    "similarly , both the unit disk and random connection model mentioned above display a percolation phenomenon , in a unit disk graph of expected @xmath12 vertices distributed over a square of side @xmath13 there exist supercritical connection ranges @xmath14 for which a giant cluster exists asymptotically almost surely ( i.e. with probability @xmath15 in the limit @xmath16 )",
    ". there exists a similar asymptotic connection rule in the random connection model @xcite . ] .",
    "now , notice that these stochastic models show an aesthetic similarity to randomly constructed , wirelessly connected networks of radio transmitters dispersed over a large urban region .",
    "one can therefore investigate analogous results to percolation , but in a wireless network setting .",
    "indeed , this is the most common application of the theory today .",
    "results , generally , concern theoretical methods for the optimal use of what are now very expensive communication resources .",
    "the field is broad :    1 .",
    "`` ( there ) is a sense of missing unification and a lack of general methods that apply to large families of different models . ''",
    "the task of then applying mathematical results such as performance bounds to actual networks and the way they run is not straightforward , nor is it commonly performed in industry .",
    "this has lead to a lack of focus .",
    "3 .   the probabilistic analysis of spatial communication networks , sometimes involving dynamical processes , is often very difficult .",
    "well developed techniques from random graph theory can rarely be applied effectively @xcite .    despite these difficulties ,",
    "there are well cited results over the last two decades which constitute a research frontier , either concerning mathematical features of commonly applied random graph models , or the specific use of random graphs in communication problems .",
    "we now introduce some current research topics :    1 .",
    "* hyperbolic geometry : * dense deployments of small cells form a _ complex system_. the classic characteristics are 1 ) a locally sparse network due to the geometric element i.e. the degree @xmath17 of a vertex is typically @xmath18 , the number of networked devices , 2 ) some cells form an unusually high number of connections , known as hubs , and 3 ) an clear spatial clustering of vertices . the degree of cells follows a power law , exhibiting _ the small world effect _ ( short hop - distances join arbitrary vertex pairs , since most vertices connect directly to hubs ) @xcite . + there is currently an hypothesis that these characteristics are a result of an ` underlying ' hyperbolic geometry .",
    "this is because random geometric graphs embedded in the _ hyperbolic plane _ exhibit many characteristic properties of complex networks ( such as the power law degree distribution ) @xcite .",
    "one can then use random geometric graphs embedded in the hyperbolic plane as a model for complex networks ( see section [ sec : hyperbolic ] ) .",
    "* symmetric motifs : * a symmetric motif is a potentially disconnected subset of vertices with the property that any permutation of indices preserves adjacency @xcite . they can be identified in the graph laplacian by identifying the integer eigenvalues and reading off the non - zero components of corresponding eigenvectors .",
    "in fact , the induced subgraph of these components is the corresponding symmetric motif @xcite .",
    "+ their spectral properties imply functional roles in system - level processes running on the graph @xcite , such as diffusion , synchronisation , or the flow of electric current .",
    "they occur more frequently in spatial networks due to the geometric factor . their characteristic nature , mixed with a simple connection to the graph s laplacian spectrum ,",
    "make them a fascinating and much undervalued research approach to processes running on dense communication networks .",
    "the rado graph : * infinite random geometric graphs consist of a random geometric graph in _ the infinite limit _ , rather than the thermodynamic or high - density continuum limit .",
    "the unit disk graph has a version of this , taking the vertex set @xmath19 to be a countably infinite subset of the euclidean metric space , and the number of vertices @xmath20 .",
    "graphs formed this way are not necessarily isomorphic , contrasting a similar theory concerning non - spatial random graphs ( the erds - rnyi or _ random graph _",
    "@xcite ) presented in one of the earliest works on the subject , by erds and rnyi @xcite , where all infinite random graphs are of a unique isomorphism type denoted the _",
    "rado graph_. for the geometric case , this infinite limit can help reveal large - scale structure and long term behaviour .",
    "ultra - dense telecommunications networks have the potential to be studied this way @xcite .",
    "* non - homogeneous point processes : * the simple poisson point process model can be extended to address more realistic situations where the distribution of points is not uniform in space .",
    "the most common variant is the _",
    "strauss process _ , which is a point process defined by a markov chain monte carlo algorithm involving repelling points ; densely deployed stations are randomly dispersed , but never right next to each other , which is the main lack of realism encountered in the poisson point process model .",
    "see sec [ sec : bpp ] , [ sec : mpp ] and [ sec : gpa ] .",
    "measures of centrality : * this involves introducing centrality analysis into communication network theory @xcite .",
    "example applications include boundary detection , and as part of social routing protocols which assign centrality indices to vertices in order to assses a sort of ` routing potential ' . also",
    ", techniques which networks can employ to determine the centrality of their constituent vertices are of current interest @xcite .",
    "* mobility models : * networks with moving vertices are used as models for mobile ad hoc networks ( manets ) .",
    "for example , consider the _ random walk model _ : vertices are distributed uniformly at random on the surface of a flat torus , but move , at each time step , to a new location a distance @xmath17 ( a parameter of the model ) and angle @xmath21 ( selected uniformly at random for each time step ) away from where they currently are @xcite .",
    "one can then ask whether the usual connectivity analysis still applies . + mobility is particularly important in the case of _ delay tolerant networking_. here , mobile users offload and collect their data ( such as a download ) from a network of intermediate , also mobile vertices , which store , cary and forward data as the relay opportunity arises",
    ". the specific mobility model on which the dynamic network is based will significantly alter the analysis of performance .",
    "state of the art research concerns the more realistic models of human mobility , such as the levy walk model ( lw ) @xcite , and _ self - similar least action human walk _ ( slaw ) @xcite , both of which capture , for example , the self - similarity of human walks , and the distribution of inter - meeting times within which message relays can occur . + also",
    ", the use of betweenness centrality @xcite , is established .",
    "numerical calculation of these network centrality indices can assist certain delay tolerant networking protocols by encouraging mobile vertices to relay data toward exceptionally central mobile vertices whenever possible @xcite .",
    "* aerial networks : * one may consider employing aerial base stations , such as drones .",
    "this can provide spontaneously adaptive coverage .",
    "exactly whether or not this solution can outperform ground station - reliant networks can be assessed using analysis of random geometric networks @xcite .",
    "* localisation : * wireless devices often demand essential location information .",
    "indoor localisation can not use gps , given a line - of - sight requirement with multiple satellites .",
    "underground , aerial and secret military localisation techniques are currently being developed . in a random network",
    ", one can _ triangulate _ by first measuring hop - counts to location - aware anchor vertices ( such as access points ) , then converting hop - counts to euclidean distances via a conditional distribution @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "* secure communication : * the use of random secrecy graphs , which consist of a superimposed point process of eavesdroppers and users on which a geometric graph is formed , can provide useful limits on the ability of wireless networks to communicate in secure environments @xcite .      in this thesis , we focus on two key , developing areas :    1 .   _ connectivity in non - convex domains _ : since many real world domains are not convex subsets of @xmath23 , we extend the analysis of high - density random network connectivity into the more realistic scenario of a domain containing randomly arranged circular obstacles . as with other work concerning non - convexity @xcite ,",
    "the obstructions in the domain introduce unique features to the graphs .",
    "specifically , obstacles act like internal perimeters , encouraging isolated vertices .",
    "we describe this effect in detail in chapter [ chapter : connectivity ] , showing how small obstacles over which vertices connect . ]",
    "encourage isolated vertices according to a factor proportional to their area @xmath24 , while large obstacles attract isolated vertices according to a factor proportional to their perimeter @xmath25 .",
    "this implies small obstacles have a negligible effect on connectivity , since one sees a power of the ratio @xmath26 , and hence the contribution vanishes for small obstacles @xmath27 . also , we show the compound effect of obstacles is a linear combination of separate contributions , given they are not too close .",
    "+ we then observe that vertex isolation near an inner boundary can be dramatic .",
    "this is because vertices on the inner perimeter have an exceptionally high betweenness centrality , acting as popular bridging vertices between distant parts of the domain.@xcite .",
    "noticing the importance of this sort of structural concept to communication processes running on dense urban networks , we begin to analyse it directly .    1 .   in chapter [ chapter : betweenness ] , we consider analytically quantifying betweenness centrality in a random geometric graph . in a limiting density scenario , which we describe as a _ continuum limit _ , shortest paths between vertices are approximated by the convex hulls of their endpoints i.e. by straight line segments .",
    "based on the assumption that only a single geodesic path will join any two vertices , by simply counting the number of convex hulls which 1 ) can be formed by any pair of points in @xmath28 and 2 ) run through @xmath29 we can then count the number of geodesic paths which intersect @xmath30 .",
    "+ using delta functions , we then show how the ( expected , normalised ) betweenness centrality @xmath31 of some polar point @xmath32 in a disk domain metric space is , in fact , a known integral : @xmath33 i.e. the elliptic integral of the second kind scaled by a quadratic function of displacement from the disk s center .",
    "we then discuss numerical convergence of expected betweenness to this integral as the point process density goes to infinity , showing how centrality is well approximated , but never exactly equal to , our convex hull based continuum approximation .",
    "given the importance of centrality , we then develop the analysis at lower densities :    1 .   in chapter [ chapter : geodesicpaths ] , in light of the above , we evaluate the expected number of geodesic paths @xmath34 which run between two vertices at displacement @xmath35 in a unit disk graph .",
    "these are the _ pair dependencies _ which are summed in the evaluation of betweenness , see section [ sec : computation ] . taking the point process density @xmath36 in a domain of arbitrary dimension @xmath17 , this is approximately equal to a polynomial in @xmath37 of order @xmath38 @xmath39we highlight the difficulties in providing a better approximation .",
    "we also numerically corroborate our formulas , and discuss some interesting features which appear when non - geodesic paths are incorporated .    1 .",
    "finally , in chapter [ chapter : discussion ] , we discuss potential applications of this research , and make the relationship between theory and practice clearer .",
    "the statistical analysis of centrality metrics on random communication networks can provide useful insights into performance .",
    "what is already known is how betweenness can be algorithmically determined , either by a central computer , or by the constituent vertices in a centralised way .",
    "what is advanced is how this can ultimately be done analytically .",
    "this avoids an infamously expensive computation ( see section [ sec : computation ] ) .",
    "we now enumerate key contributions :    1 .   in ultra - dense networks ,",
    "we show how non - convex features of bounded domains can be highlighted by centrality indices .",
    "@xmath40-dimensional subgraphs meandering around urban obstructions can become critical to optimal performance .",
    "3 .   isolated vertices do not determine connection in quasi - one - dimensional random geometric graphs .",
    "a simple approximation to social network - theoretic betweenness centrality can be used by various high - layer wireless network routing protocols in order to omit the expensive and often impossible computation which would normally occur during operation .",
    "we also discuss interesting applications of analytic formulas .",
    "an approximation to the expected number of geodesic paths joining two distant vertices will lead to a more complete understanding of the value of these sorts of statistics in straightforward interference management techniques applied to 5 g small cell deployments .",
    "also , the expected number of geodesics can be used by ad hoc vertices as part of estimating the distance to an underground point , where gps is unavailable .",
    "this may develop into overground localisation where appropriate .",
    "we finally highlight the need to develop the field of spatial probabilistic combinatorics on a more applied footing , particularly concerning issues such as the spatial dependence of network observables .",
    "the rest of this thesis is structured as follows :    1 .   * in chapter i * we introduce a number of concepts in communication theory and random geometric graphs which are relevant to the arguments in this thesis .",
    "2 .   * in chapter ii",
    "* we study the effect of non - convexity on the random connection model .",
    "3 .   * in chapter",
    "iii * we introduce _ betweenness centrality _ in asymptotically dense random geometric graphs .",
    "* in chapter iv * the continuum limit is relaxed , and we approach betweenness centrality at finite density , finding the expected number of geodesic paths between two vertices in a unit disk graph ( of general dimension @xmath17 ) . 5 .   * in chapter",
    "v * we discuss the applications of this research to dense networks .",
    "one of the early graph - theoretic communication problems was a derivation of the probability that a random geometric graph was connected in the _ thermodynamic limit _ , where both the number of vertices and the domain volume @xmath41 in such a way that the vertex density is constant @xcite .",
    "the result goes as follows : take a simple poisson point process @xmath3 of expected @xmath12 vertices inside a square of side @xmath13 , and form a graph by linking pairs of this process whenever they are within euclidean distance @xmath42 of each other .",
    "call this graph @xmath43 . according to penrose @xcite , and later gupta and kumar @xcite , the asymptotic connection probability of the model with",
    "_ logarithmic _ growth of the connection disks , i.e. @xmath44 , is given by @xmath45 as @xmath16 .",
    "therefore , if @xmath46 goes to infinity with @xmath12 , the graph will connect asymptotically almost surely .",
    "should @xmath47 , the model is at _ criticality _ , and neither connects nor disconnects with certainty .    to see this , consider a disk of area @xmath48 centred at some vertex @xmath49 : this contains no other points of @xmath3 with probability @xmath50 . for large @xmath12 , these empty disks , which are isolated vertices , occur independently in the limit .",
    "therefore the number of isolated vertices @xmath51 is distributed as a binomial random variable @xmath52 .",
    "a simple poisson process @xmath53 of isolated vertices will therefore be observed in the limit .",
    "this process is empty with probability : @xmath54 the question is , does this lack of isolated vertices imply the graph is connected ?      consider the following two lemmas @xcite :    assuming @xmath55 , there exists a @xmath56 such that asymptotically almost surely the random graph @xmath57 does not consist of two or more connected components each with _ _ euclidean diameter _",
    "_ at least @xmath58 .",

    "how large ?",
    "[ l : theyareisolatedvertices ] the graph @xmath59 contains no components @xmath60 of more than one vertex and euclidean diameter strictly less than @xmath58 .",
    "these two lemmas imply that there exists a specific phase of the sub - logarithmic growth of @xmath61 where a single giant component forms surrounded by isolated vertices . ] .",
    "we have shown in [ sec : connect ] that these isolated vertices form a poisson point process of their own .",
    "this means that one can effectively approximate the connection probability @xmath62 as @xmath63    to see the first of these lemmas , tile the square domain with tiles of side @xmath64 .",
    "this ensures that any two vertices found in any two adjacent squares are no more than @xmath65 apart .",
    "then argue that    1 .   a component @xmath66 of euclidean diameter",
    "at least @xmath58 covers many tiles as @xmath16 .",
    "2 .   since the tiles have side @xmath64 , all tiles adjacent to @xmath66 must be empty while the component exists .",
    "there are many empty boundary tiles , given the size of @xmath66 .",
    "4 .   as @xmath16 , they can not all be empty .",
    "thus any component of diameter at least @xmath58 will merge with another component , leaving only small components .",
    "we do not explicitly prove parts @xmath15-@xmath67 , but refer directly to walter s review @xcite ; it essentially suffices to count the tiles .",
    "now , the second part is based on the same sort of argument : that an empty area must be maintained around a small component in order to keep it small , and that this area is , asymptotically , filled , unless it is a single vertex .",
    "thus all large components join together , all small components are isolated vertices , and @xmath68 .",
    "given this relation between isolated vertices and connectivity , it suffices to evaluate the probability that a single isolated vertex exists in the random connection model , then suggest that as the density @xmath69 , @xmath70 we now evaluate this . consider a vertex at some fixed @xmath71 .",

    "now , given the conjecture discussed in [ sec : connect ] ( that isolated vertices occur as a simple poisson point process ) , it is natural in light of eq .",

    "one can therefore evaluate the connection probability of the random connection model with an integral .",

    "we now discuss some possible applications of eq .",
    "[ e:12 ] .",
    "betweenness centrality has been used for electing cluster heads ( ch ) @xcite ) .",
    "these are special vertices which take on the task of routing collected data , often sensor data , to some distant point on behalf of the network . in sensor networks , they are often called _",
    "sinks_. a number of routing protocols are usually implemented .",
    "for example , the basic leach ( low energy adaptive clustering hierarchy @xcite ) protocol uses a random selection of cluster heads at each round ( i.e. time - step ) , the vertices each taking turns in bearing the burden of cluster head status , or , alternatively , eecs ( energy efficient clustering scheme @xcite ) , which requires vertices to broadcast their remaining power to first - degree neighbours , asking machines that find themselves with the most battery power to then elect themselves to cluster head status .",
    "however , in large networks using a vanishing transmitter range these protocols do nt work : far too many cluster heads get elected due to the huge vertex numbers and the efficiency problem that this technique is trying to mitigate re - arises . potentially increasing transmitter range",
    "could resolve the problem ( since the usual techniques are based on one - hop access to the head vertex ) , though this introduces interference problems , so one searches for another solution .",
    "betweenness is a possible alternative election criteria , since it is proportional to power consumption , and to routing load , unlike most other centrality measures .",
    "this allows idle boundary vertices to act as cluster heads whenever power minimisation is preferred , or busy domain - center vertices whenever optimisation of vertex - to - vertex communication overheads is tasked .",
    "knowledge of betweenness as a function of position helps in the selection of positions which , when occupied by vertices , results in ch election .",
    "note also that , based on the intuition that central vertices are easier to reach , communication - based resource consumption is minimised whenever high - betweenness vertices are , in general , used as cluster heads .",
    "boundary detection is another application .",
    "this is an important field , with various applications @xcite .",
    "one potential use of betweenness as a boundary detector is for mitigating the so called boundary effect phenomenon @xcite , where high - density network connectivity is hampered through vertices becoming isolated near the domain boundaries .",
    "one potential mitigation technique is to increase the device transmit power at the domain boundary e.g. we can harness some spare power in the relatively idle boundary vertices , increasing machine transmit power appropriately with betweenness .",
    "this does not require the sharing of routing tables or other connectivity information , since betweenness is directly proportional to the devices current routing load .",
    "finding the optimal function of the betweenness ( or perhaps other centrality measures ) is beyond the scope of this thesis , but we highlight that this is an interesting and important open problem .    skeleton extraction is a third . the skeleton @xcite consists of the most central vertices , given by a rather arbitrary percentage ( the top @xmath325 , for example ) .",
    "note the bottom right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : one ] , where betweenness is plotted over a square domain containing two circular obstacles ( which restrict line - of - sight connections between vertices , e.g. @xcite ) . the skeleton @xcite forms around the circular obstacles .",
    "we discuss this further in section [ sec : skeleton ] .",
    "the betweenness centrality of vertices stands amongst a variety of popular centrality variants , many of which originated in sociology .",
    "we now discuss the possible alternatives .    1 .",
    "* edge betweenness centrality : * the number of shortest paths which involve a particular _ edge _ are considered .",
    "* flow betweenness centrality : * a flow of material through the network elucidates the importance of vertices .",
    "* node closeness centrality : * the sum of all geodesic distances to the remaining @xmath326 vertices determines centrality .",
    "* node eigenvector centrality : * a sophisticated extension of degree centrality , a form of which is implemented in pagerank . 5 .",
    "* node degree centrality : * vertices are ranked simply by the number of neighbours they have .    edge betweenness highlights communication channels which may become over subscribed .",
    "this would be a good alternative investigation : it is just as difficult to compute on a sparse graph , and just as desirable in a closed , analytic form , for example near an obstacle .",
    "it can then be used as a complement to an algorithmic determination of edge betweenness centrality ( for various reasons related to the prediction of e.g. channel characteristics ) .",
    "but as part of the current scope of centrality in wireless networks , it is perhaps less relevant",
    ". it can not be used for boundary detection , for example , and it is sensitive to an exact specification of link efficiency , which is a difficult to characterise element of wireless performance .",
    "current flow betweenness is perhaps the better candidate for wireless network - theoretic development than edge betweenness .",
    "it characterises the intuitive reason vertices , or edges , are central : they ca nt help but be put under pressure during the operation of a flow .",
    "it is , however , too mathematically involved for an analysis of this sort",
    ". it may be more appropriate to algorithmically determine .",
    "closeness has been suggested as the key alternative to betweenness .",
    "this is for the simple reason that short geodesic hop counts to all vertices characterise multi - hop routing in a straightforward way .",
    "but it does not capture the ` bridging vertex ' issues picked up by betweenness .",
    "it is also easier to infer intuitively from the geometry of a bounded domain , given the more or less linear scaling of hop count with euclidean distance when the network is dense .",
    "degree centrality , and sophisticated extensions such as pagerank , suffer from the same sort of tractability issues as current flow betweenness .",
    "though the expected degree of a vertex is easier to calculate , the analytic extension which would be required to evaluate something like eigenvector centrality would be too sophisticated for a random geometric graph model without a clear physical motivation from wireless practice being made clear .",
    "the trade off between the characterisation of flows which betweenness can provide , the overall tractability of its first moment ( which we now demonstrate ) , and its established use in ad hoc networks , provides the motivation for an analytic study .",
    "its does not incorporate non - geodesic paths , nor admit particularly tractable calculations at moderate to low densities , but overall , it is a good starting point .      despite the disparity between betweenness centrality and our continuum approximation eq .",
    "[ e:12 ] , fig .",
    "[ fig : iccmain ] shows a remarkably good approximation , given we must take into account :    1 .",
    "that there are many geodesic paths which join two vertices as @xmath258 .",
    "2 .   that the paths are not straight , but appear to form brownian bridges @xcite .",
    "thus , the small discrepancy is a fair price to pay given the difficulty that a more accurate , finite density approximation appears to present .    also , we have pointed out the quadratic scaling of betweenness as vertices moves away from the central region of the disk domain in eq . [",
    "e : quadratic ] .",
    "it is interesting to ask how sensitive this first order term is to details of the boundary .",
    "if there is partial invariance , then with central regions located , vertices can estimate their betweenness with a quadratic equation .",
    "minimising the total number of sequential transmissions required for two vertices to communicate is a common concern in multi - hop communication .",
    "this is due to :    1 .   the distortion caused by excessive amplify - and - forward activity , 2 .   the loss of sinr caused by an overly intense spatio - temporal point process of relay transmissions .",
    "probabilistic modelling of the network s route statistics can prove important for the management of these issues .",
    "for example , small perturbations to the expected number of hops in a typical path of devices can have a significant effect on the total mass of randomly timed multi - hop transmissions which the network continually initiates during its operation .",
    "this motivates a number of problems concerning the statistics of paths , most prominently that of finding a function @xmath327 relating the minimum number of hops between two vertices @xmath328 in a random geometric graph to a probability distribution on the set of euclidean distances which could separate them in the metric space .     in a unit disk graph , with the connection range @xmath329 .",
    "they are joined by ten geodesic paths , each of four hops .",
    "we evaluate the expectation of this quantity in terms of the mutual euclidean separation of vertices . ]    the origins of this problem go back to chandler s letter in the 1980 s @xcite . as an example application , this relationship can be used to provide location estimates to vertices possessing hop - counts to ` anchor ' devices distributed around the domain @xcite .",
    "this is a particularly useful skill in wireless sensor networks where gps is often unavailable .",
    "this information can also be used to optimally place gateway devices in dense small cell deployments .",
