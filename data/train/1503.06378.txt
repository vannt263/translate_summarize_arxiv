    "a new type of luminous transient has been identified in recent years through the use of deep , wide surveys searching for supernovae in the local universe ( quimby et al .",
    "2005 , 2007 ; quimby 2006 ; smith et al .",
    "2007 ; drake et al . 2009 ; rau et al . 2009 ; kaiser et al . 2010 ; gal - yam 2012 ; baltay et al . 2013 ) .",
    "these super - luminous supernovae ( slsn ) have peak magnitudes @xmath9 mag and integrated burst energies @xmath4@xmath10 erg .",
    "they are therefore much brighter than both type ia sne and the majority of core - collapse events .",
    "their unusually high peak luminosities , hot blackbody temperatures and bright rest frame ultra - violet emission ( which renders their continuum easily detectable at optical and near - infrared wavelengths at high redshifts ; cooke et al .",
    "2012 ) allow them to be studied in concert with possible gamma - ray burst associations ( li et al .",
    "2014 ; cano & jakobsson 2014 ) and , more importantly , make them viable standardizable candles and distance indicators for use as cosmological probes ( inserra & smartt 2014 ) .",
    "inserra et al . ( 2013 ) and nicholl et al . ( 2013 ) used the classification term slsn ic to refer to all the hydrogen poor snlse , though there appear to be at least two observational groups in this category .",
    "these are distinguished via the terms sn2005ap - like and sn2007bi - like events , since these are the prototypes with the faster and slower evolving lightcurves .",
    "slsne ic have now been discovered out to redshifts @xmath11@xmath12 ( chomiuk et al .",
    "2011 ; berger et al . 2012 ; cooke et al . 2012 ; howell et al . 2013 ) , and appear to be rather homogeneous in their spectroscopic and photometric properties .",
    "the brighter events decline more slowly , not unlike the phillips relation for type ia sne , which raises the possibility of correlating their peak magnitudes to their decline over a fixed number of days to reduce the scatter ( rust 1974 ; pskovskii 1977 ; phillips 1993 ; hamuy et al .",
    "1996 ) . without the use of such a relation ,",
    "the uncorrected raw mean magnitudes show a dispersion of @xmath4@xmath13 ( e.g. , inserra & smartt 2014 ) . correlating the peak magnitude to the decline over 30 days",
    "reduces the scatter in standardized peak magnitudes to @xmath14 mag . and apparently using a magnitude - color evolution reduces this scatter even more , to a low value somewhere between @xmath15 mag and @xmath16 mag .",
    "it is therefore quite evident that slsne ic may be useful cosmological probes , perhaps even out to redshifts much greater ( @xmath17 ) than those accessible using type ia sne .",
    "the currently available sample , however , is still quite small ; adequate data to extract correlations between empirical , observable quantities , such as lightcurve shape , color evolution and peak luminosity , are available only for tens of events .",
    "our focus in this paper is specifically to study whether slsne ic can be used  not only to optimize the parameters in @xmath0cdm ( li et al .",
    "2014 ; cano & jakobsson 2014 ; inserra & smartt 2014 ) , e.g. , to refine the dark - energy equation of state but , also  to carry out comparative studies between competing cosmologies , such as @xmath0cdm versus the @xmath1 universe ( melia 2007 ; melia & abdelqader 2009 ; melia & shevchuk 2012 ; melia 2013a ) .    like @xmath0cdm ,",
    "the @xmath1 universe is a friedmann - robertson - walker cosmology that assumes the presence of dark energy , as well as matter and radiation .",
    "the principle difference between them is that the latter is also constrained by the equation of state @xmath18 , in terms of the total pressure @xmath19 and energy density @xmath20 . in recent years",
    ", this model has generated some discussion concerning its fundamental basis , including claims that it is actually a vacuum solution , even though @xmath21 .",
    "however , all criticisms leveled against @xmath1 thus far appear to be based on incorrect assumptions and theoretical errors .",
    "a full accounting of this discussion may be found in melia ( 2015 ) and references cited therein .",
    "in fact , the application of model selection tools in one - on - one comparisons between these two cosmologies has shown that the data tend to favor @xmath1 over @xmath0cdm .",
    "tests completed thus far include high-@xmath22 quasars ( melia 2013b , 2014 ) , gamma ray bursts ( wei et al .",
    "2013 ) , the use of cosmic chronometers ( melia & maier 2013 ) and , most recently , the type ia sne themselves ( wei et al . 2014 ) . in all of these tests ,",
    "information criteria show that @xmath1 , with the important additional constraint @xmath18 on its equation of state , is favored over @xmath0cdm with a likelihood of @xmath23 versus only @xmath24 .    here , we broaden the comparison between @xmath1 and @xmath0cdm by now including slsne ic in this study . in ",
    "2 we briefly describe the currently available sample and our method of analysis .",
    "our results are presented in   3 .",
    "we will find that the current catalog of slsne ic suitable for this study already confirms the tendencies discussed above , though the statistics are not yet good enough to strongly differentiate between these two competing models .",
    "we show in   4",
    "how large the source catalog needs to be in order to rule out one or the other expansion scenario at a 3-sigma confidence level , and we present our conclusions in   5 .",
    "eleven of the slsne ic identified by inserra & smartt ( 2014 ) are appropriate for this work , and we base our analysis on the methodology described in their paper and in li et al .",
    "briefly , the chosen slsne ic must have well sampled light - curves around peak luminosity , and photometric coverage from several days pre - maximum to 30 days ( in the rest frame ) after the peak .",
    "this time delay appears to be optimal for use in the phillips - like peak magnitude - decline relation ( inserra & smartt 2014 ) .",
    "all 11 of these events appear to be similar to the well - observed sn2010gx , and these decay rapidly after peak brightness .",
    "they belong to the group of 2005ap - like events , the first such sn discovered in this category .",
    "other slsne ic could not be included simply because of lack of sufficient temporal coverage , even though their identification has been securely classified in previous work ( see , e.g. , leloudas et al .",

    "but though slsn ic observations currently tend to favor @xmath1 over @xmath0cdm , the known sample of such measurements is still too small for us to completely rule out either model .",

    "2012 ) due , perhaps , to a decreasing metallicity .",
    "moreover , the increase in cosmic star formation rate would boost the absolute numbers of slsne .",
    "as far as observations from the ground are concerned , assembling a sample of several hundred type ic slsne over 3 to 5 years therefore looks quite promising , particulary with the surveying capability of lsst ( see , e.g. , lien & fields 2009 ) , which should cover the whole sky every 2 nights , down to a limiting magnitude @xmath222 .",
    "the expected rate of discovery of core - collapse sne with this survey is expected to be @xmath223 s@xmath216 out to a redshift @xmath224 .",
    "given that @xmath219 of these are expected to be type ic sne in this redshift range , one should expect lsst to assemble a @xmath225 slsn sample in less than a year . the situation from space",

    "detecting type ic slsne out to redshifts @xmath226 via their restframe 400 nm and 520 nm bands is plausible with , e.g. , euclid ( laureijs et al .",
    "2011 ) , wfirst and the james webb space telescope ( specifically the nircam ) .    a major problem with this approach right now , however , is that one must rely on the use of a luminosity - limited sample of supernovae , i.e. those selected to be super - luminous with peak magnitudes @xmath9 mag and integrated burst energies @xmath4@xmath10 erg ( inserra & smartt 2014 ) , in order to test the luminosity distances .",
    "the difficulty is that the luminosity - limited sample may turn out to be different with different background cosmologies , given that their inferred luminosities are themselves dependent on the models .",
    "this situation is unlikely to change as the sample grows , so it would be necessary to find a way of identifying these sne , other than simply through their magnitudes . fortunately , in the case of @xmath1 versus @xmath0cdm , even though their luminosity distances are formulated differently",
