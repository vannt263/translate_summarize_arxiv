    "<S> although we here exploit the gauge invariance and scaling theory to obtain the scaling ansatz in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : oc ] ) , this can also be achieved from the renormalization group analysis of the disorder coupling , as shown in the si . when the fermi energy ( @xmath57 ) is pinned away from the weyl points ( see red dashed line in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ criticalregime ] ) , the system behaves as a diffusive metal at the lowest energy scale for arbitrary strength of impurity scatterers and our discussion on the scaling of oc is germane only for @xmath58 .    </S>",
    "<S> first we focus on the qcp ( @xmath59 ) , where the oc must be devoid of any @xmath60-dependence , dictating @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> its scaling with frequency is then given by @xmath62 therefore , within the critical regime oc vanishes with a peculiar power - law dependence when frequency @xmath63 , which in turn roughly determines the extent of the critical regime at finite frequencies ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ criticalregime ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> notice that as the qcp is approached from the wsm phase the residue of quasiparticle pole vanishes smoothly  @xcite , while approaching it from the metallic side the diffusion coefficient diverges  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the critical regime constitutes a _ non - fermi liquid _ phase of strongly coupled gapless critical modes , due to quantum fluctuations driven by disorder , where the oc scales as @xmath4 .    </S>",
    "<S> next we consider the metallic phase , where average density of states at zero energy is finite , and thus oc as @xmath5 also becomes finite due to a finite lifetime of diffusive fermions . </S>",
    "<S> hence , inside the metallic phase @xmath64 ( to the leading order ) and oc scales as @xmath65 oc in the metallic phase thus depends only on @xmath12 as @xmath5 , which together with the dependence of @xmath66 solely on @xmath14 endows a unique opportunity to extract the correlation length and the dynamic critical exponents near the wsm - metal qcp independently , and that way pin the universality class of this transition . </S>",
    "<S> hence , in the presence of strong disorder ( @xmath48 ) , as the frequency is gradually lowered the intra - band component of oc starts to dominate over the inter - band counterpart , and in the limit @xmath5 , only the former contribution survives . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , in the super - critical regime , oc displays a smooth crossover from @xmath4 dependence ( high frequency ) toward a constant value as @xmath5 ( low frequency ) around @xmath67 [ see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ criticalregime ] ] . </S>",
    "<S> the drude - peak ( arising from the intraband contribution ) inside the metallic phase gets broadened due to a finite transport lifetime of quasiparticles , and its width increases with the strength of disorder . by contrast , inside the wsm phase and quantum critical regime the drude - peak remains sharp .    finally , we delve into the scaling of oc on the wsm side of the transition . in the clean limit , </S>",
    "<S> on dimensional grounds , we expect inter - band oc @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> such scaling of oc remains valid in the weakly disordered wsm , at least when @xmath69 , indicating that @xmath70 for @xmath71 , leading to @xmath72 which vanishes linearly with frequency @xmath3 . with increasing strength of disorder , </S>",
    "<S> the system becomes more metallic and typically at the wsm - metal qcp @xmath73  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , as one approaches the wsm - metal qcp from the semimetallic side , the system becomes more metallic and @xmath74 increases . in the weak disorder regime , </S>",
    "<S> the inter - band component of oc dominates over intra - band piece until @xmath75 , with @xmath57 being the fermi energy ( typically unknown ) in a wsm , and with increasing frequency oc displays a smooth crossover from @xmath3 to @xmath4 dependence . as disorder increases the frequency range over which oc scales linearly with the frequency shrinks , while the region with @xmath4 scaling increases . </S>",

    "<S> [ criticalregime ] ] , at least when @xmath77 .    </S>",
    "<S> _ optical response in a wsm _ : since weak disorder flows toward smaller values with increasing rg time @xmath78 or decreasing frequency , the lowest energy excitations are described by ballistic chiral fermions in a weakly disordered wsm . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we can rely on the _ kubo formalism _ in this regime to compute oc of a wsm diagramatically , and directly test the validity of its scaling ansatz for weak enough randomness . to set the stage , we first focus on the oc in a clean wsm ( @xmath79 ) , which at zero temperature can be extracted from the current - current correlation function . in what follows and as shown in the si , we compute the integrals over the internal momentum in @xmath80 spatial dimensions , and at the end send @xmath81 , closely following the spirit of _ dimensional regularization _ that manifestly preserves the _ gauge invariance _  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the oc in a clean wsm is @xmath82 , with @xmath83 as the number of weyl pairs . in this limit ( @xmath79 ) , @xmath84 , in agreement with the above scaling form . </S>",

    "<S> by now it is well established that random charge impurities ( @xmath89 ) can drive wsm - metal transition  @xcite or at least can support a large crossover regime if rare regions dominate at the lowest energy scale  @xcite . as described in depth in the si , elastic scatterer of any other nature ( magnetic , spin - orbit , mass disorder , etc . ) </S>",

    "<S> strong axial disorder also gives rise to semimetal - metal qpt  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hence , to anchor the scaling behavior of oc in weak disorder regime , it is sufficient to focus on these two disorder couplings , @xmath89 and @xmath90 , respectively characterized by two matrices @xmath91 and @xmath92 . after accounting for the correction to oc to the lowest order in disorder coupling the total oc </S>",
