    "the anderson model for a disordered system is described by a @xmath8-dimensional disordered lattice , of size @xmath9 , with a hamiltonian @xmath10 in tight - binding approximation .",
    "the site energies @xmath11 , measured in units of the overlap integral between adjacent sites , correspond to the random potential .",
    "the hopping is assumed to connect only the @xmath12 nearest - neighbors ( referred by @xmath13 ) of each site . in the site representation",
    ", @xmath14 turns out to be a sparse matrix of size @xmath15 with diagonal matrix elements as the site energies @xmath16 .",
    "the off - diagonals @xmath17 describe the interaction between two sites @xmath18 and @xmath19 ; here @xmath17 for two sites connected by hopping will be referred as hopping off - diagonal and the rest as non - hopping off - diagonals .",
    "the level - statistics of @xmath14 can therefore be studied by analyzing the properties of an ensemble of ( i ) sparse real symmetric matrices , in presence of a time - reversal symmetry and ( ii ) sparse complex hermitian matrices in absence of a time - reversal .",
    "we consider an ensemble of anderson hamiltonians ( later referred as anderson ensemble ) with a gaussian type disorder .",
    "the site - energies @xmath16 are thus independent gaussian distributions @xmath20 with variance @xmath21 and mean @xmath22 .",
    "the hopping can be chosen to be isotropic or anisotropic , non - random or random ( gaussian ) .",
    "a general form of the probability density @xmath23 of the ensemble , including all the above possibilities , can therefore be given by    @xmath24\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with subscript @xmath25 of a variable referring to its components , @xmath26 as their total number ( @xmath27 for real variable , @xmath28 for the complex one ) , @xmath29 as the normalization constant , @xmath30 as the set of the variances @xmath31 and @xmath32 as the set of all mean values @xmath33 .",
    "as obvious , in the limit @xmath34 , eq.(1 ) corresponds to the non - random nature of @xmath17 ( that is , @xmath35 ) . note although the non - hopping off - diagonals in anderson matrix always remain zero but the effective sparsity of the matrix changes due to change in relative strength of the diagonals and the hopping off - diagonals .",
    "thus , in the insulator limit ( with almost no overlap between site energies due to strong disorder ) , the matrix behaves effectively as a diagonal one , the diagonals being very large as compared to hopping off - diagonals . in the opposite limit of very weak disorder when an average diagonal is nearly of the same strength as an average off - diagonal , the statistical behavior of the matrix is same as that of a matrix taken from a wigner - dyson ensemble @xcite .",
    "the latter are the basis - invariant gaussian ensembles of hermitian type , with a same variance for almost all matrix elements .",
    "the statistical behavior of levels in the wigner - dyson ensembles depends only on their symmetry class and is therefore universal in nature .",
    "the three main universality classes are described by a parameter @xmath26 , basically a measure of the degree of level - repulsion@xcite : ( i ) goe with @xmath27 , corresponding to time - reversal symmetry and integer angular momentum , ( ii ) gue with @xmath28 and no time - reversal symmetry , ( iii ) gse with @xmath36 and time - reversal symmetry but half integer angular momentum .    a variation of disorder and hopping rate changes the distribution parameters of the probability density @xmath37 and thereby its statistical properties .",
    "using gaussian nature of @xmath38 , it is easy to verify that under a change of parameters @xmath39 and @xmath40 , the matrix elements @xmath17 undergo a diffusion dynamics along with a finite drift ,    @xmath41    = \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\sum_{kl;s } { \\partial \\over \\partial h_{kl;s } } \\left [ { g_{kl}\\over 2 } { \\partial \\over \\partial h_{kl;s } } +   \\gamma h_{kl;s } \\right ] \\rho\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath42 with @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the @xmath45 is an arbitrary parameter , giving the variance of the matrix elements at the end of the evolution@xcite .",
    "the above equation describes a multi parametric flow of matrix elements from an arbitrary initial condition , say @xmath46 .",
    "however , as discussed in @xcite , it is possible to define a `` complexity '' parameter @xmath47 , a function of various distribution parameters @xmath48 and @xmath49 , in terms of which the matrix elements undergo a single parametric diffusion ,    @xmath50 \\rho\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with @xmath51 + c \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath52 implies a product over non - zero @xmath49 and @xmath53 .",
    "further , @xmath29 is a constant determined by the initial distribution , @xmath54 is the number of all non - zero parameters @xmath53 and @xmath49 and @xmath55 for hamiltonians with and without time - reversal , respectively .",
    "the solution of the eq.(3 ) gives the state @xmath56 of the flow at parameter @xmath47 , starting from an initial state @xmath46 with @xmath57 .",
    "an integration over initial probability density result in the density given by eq.(1 ) in terms of @xmath58 : @xmath59 .",
    "the evolution reaches a steady state when @xmath60 with the ensemble @xmath37 approaching the wigner - dyson limit , @xmath61 .    as implied by eq.(3 )",
    ", the variation of @xmath62 , depends on the changes of the parameters @xmath63 , @xmath64 ( for all @xmath65 ) only through a function @xmath47 .",
    "this can be proved by considering a transformation of the @xmath54 non - zero variables of the sets @xmath30 and @xmath32 to another set @xmath66 of @xmath54 variables ; @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "as shown in @xcite , it is possible to define @xmath69 such that the @xmath70 variables @xmath71 remain constant during the evolution of @xmath38 due to any change in sets @xmath72 .",
    "the statistics during the transition is therefore governed by @xmath47 only .",
    "the choice of the @xmath71 depends on the system under consideration . for a transition preserving the lattice structure , these constants turn out to be the functions of the site - indices in the lattice .",
    "for example , the variances @xmath63 in the anderson ensemble are functions of the disorder as well as the site - indices @xmath18 , @xmath19 ; @xmath47 can then be identified as a function of disorder while @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) as the functions of site indices .",
    "further , as these constants do not appear explicitly in eq.(3 ) , its solution and therefore the ensemble - statistics is independent of the specific values of the constants .",
    "the flow described by eq.(3 ) can start from any initial state ; the only constraint on the choice is that the parameters @xmath73 , @xmath75 , for the initial ensemble should be same as those for the ensemble @xmath76 . as shown below by an example",
    ", the initial state can also be chosen as the insulator limit of the disordered system , described by an ensemble of diagonal matrices .",
    "although this corresponds to a same value for all initial off - diagonal variances ( that is , zero ) , however a choice of different rates of change of @xmath63 with respect to @xmath47 can result in different possible values for each @xmath63 at a later stage .",
    "as an example , consider an anderson system with a gaussian site disorder ( of variance @xmath77 and mean zero ) , same for each site , and an isotropic gaussian hopping with a non - random component ( of variance @xmath78 and mean @xmath79 with @xmath80 for real and imaginary parts respectively ) between nearest neighbors ( referred as ensemble * g * later on ) .",
    "the corresponding probability density can be described by eq.(1 ) with @xmath81 where @xmath82 , @xmath83 for for @xmath84 pairs representing hopping , @xmath85 and @xmath86 for all @xmath84 values corresponding to disconnected sites . as obvious , here the distribution parameters @xmath63 depend on more than one system parameters , namely , the disorder parameters @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 as well as various functions of site - indices . the latter , being invariant of motion , give the parameters @xmath71 .",
    "the @xmath47 for this case can be obtained by using eq.(4 ) , @xmath90 + c , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath91 . here",
    "@xmath92 is the number of connected sites ( nearest - neighbors ) which depends on the topology and the dimensionality @xmath8 of the system and the @xmath93 is a function of @xmath12 , @xmath94 ; @xmath95 for @xmath96 .",
    "now consider an insulator as the initial state ( in the same site - basis as used for * g * ) with zero hopping , that is , @xmath97 , @xmath98 and a gaussian site disorder with variance @xmath99 ( referred as * g@xmath100 * ) .",
    "this corresponds to an ensemble of diagonal matrices with @xmath101 , @xmath102 for @xmath103 and @xmath104 for all @xmath65 .",
    "a substitution of these values in eq.(5 ) gives the initial value of @xmath47 , say @xmath105 , where @xmath106 with @xmath107 .",
    "note , the basis being same , the parameters @xmath73 ( for @xmath108 ) are same for both * g * and * g@xmath100*. ( the advantage of choosing the above initial state is explained later ) . as obvious , starting from * g@xmath100 * , a variation of diagonal disorder @xmath87 , hopping parameters @xmath109 and @xmath79 with rates @xmath110 can lead to the ensemble @xmath111 . using @xmath112 for @xmath108 with @xmath113 , and , eq.(5 ) to obtain @xmath114",
    ", it can be seen that the above rates correspond to @xmath115 the variances and means of different matrix elements therefore change with different rates with @xmath47 .",
    "the distribution @xmath116 of the eigenvalues @xmath117 for a metal ( for the energy ranges with fully extended eigenfunctions ) is given by the wigner - dyson distribution , @xmath118 , and , for an insulator by a poisson distribution @xcite .",
    "the distribution for various transition stages can be obtained by integrating @xmath38 over the associated eigenvector space .",
    "let @xmath119 be the joint probability of finding eigenvalues @xmath120 of @xmath14 between @xmath121 and @xmath122 ( @xmath123 ) at a given @xmath30 and @xmath32 , it can then be expressed as @xmath124 . using the above definition in eq.(3 )",
    ", it can be shown that the eigenvalues of @xmath37 undergo a diffusion dynamics along with a finite drift due to their mutual repulsion , ( see @xcite also )    @xmath125 p\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    again the steady state of the evolution is given by the limit @xmath126 ; @xmath127 in this limit turns out to be a wigner - dyson distribution .",
    "the eq.(8 ) can be used to obtain the correlations between levels .",
    "for example , a knowledge of its solution @xmath116 gives the static correlations @xmath128 the @xmath116 can be obtained by using the analogy of eq.(8 ) with the equation governing the evolution of the eigenvalues of brownian ensembles ( be ) of hermitian type @xcite .",
    "the latter , has been studied in great detail in past and many of its statistical spectral properties are already known @xcite .",
    "a brief description of the be is given in the next section .",
    "it should be noted here that the single - parametric evolution of the matrix elements of the ae in terms of the complexity parameter @xmath129 would result in a similar evolution for their eigenvector components too ; this can be shown by integrating the eq.(3 ) over all eigenvalues .",
    "however in this paper we confine ourselves to the discussion of eigenvalue statistics only ; the details for the eigenvector statistics will be published elsewhere .",
    "the stationary random - matrix ensembles were introduced in the past to model quantum mechanical operators of complex systems in which a certain set of quantities ( for example , total spin , charge or isotopic spin ) was exactly conserved ; no other integral of the motion existed even approximately @xcite .",
    "the total set of the states of the system could then be divided into subsets , each subset corresponding to a particular set of values for the conserved quantities .",
    "this divides the matrix representation of the operator in various blocks ; the deterministic uncertainty due to complicated nature of the interactions leads to randomization of the blocks . due to lack of correlation between energy levels of states belonging to different subsets , different blocks are uncorrelated .",
    "the statistics of the levels within one subset can then be described by a separate random matrix model which can be of various types based on the underlying symmetry @xcite .",
    "the stationary ensembles are inappropriate models for systems possessing approximate conservation laws .",
    "however such systems occur more frequently in practice which motivated dyson to introduce the brownian ensembles ( be ) of random matrices @xcite .",
    "as the latter have been discussed in detail in past e.g. in @xcite ( and references therein ) , here we give only a brief review of the bes related to hermitian matrices .",
    "consider the hamiltonian operator @xmath14 of a system with its elements given by @xmath17 at `` time '' @xmath130 and @xmath131 at `` time '' @xmath132 .",
    "a brownian motion of @xmath14 is defined by requiring that each @xmath133 is a random variable with the moments : @xmath134 , @xmath135 @xcite .",
    "the evolution of the distribution of matrix elements , from any arbitrary initial state , can then be given by a fokker - planck equation which has the same form as eq.(3 ) with @xmath136 .",
    "for @xmath137 , the distribution approaches steady state which corresponds to one of the stationary ensembles .",
    "the crossover to stationarity is rapid , discontinuous , as a function of @xmath130 , for infinite matrix sizes or very large energy - ranges .",
    "a brownian ensemble can therefore be described as a non - stationary state of the matrix elements undergoing a cross - over due to a random perturbation of a stationary ensemble by another one .",
    "for example , in the case of hermitian operators , a brownian ensemble @xmath14 can be given as @xmath138 ( with @xmath139 ) ; here @xmath140 is a random perturbation of strength @xmath130 , taken from a stationary ensemble , and applied to an initial stationary state @xmath46 ( see also @xcite ) . using 2nd order perturbation theory ,",
    "it can be shown that the eigenvalues @xmath141 , @xmath142 of @xmath14 execute a brownian motion too , with their evolution described by an equation same as eq.(8 ) ( with @xmath143 ) .",
    "the eigenvalue statistics ( e.g. static correlations given by eq.(9 ) ) of a be can then be obtained by solving eq.(8 ) .",
    "the eq.(8 ) is equivalent , under a wick rotation , to the schrodinger equation of the calogero - sutherland hamiltonian ; the equivalence has been used to obtain the eigenvalue correlations for many bes @xcite .",
    "it is shown moreover that the crossover in correlations is governed , for small @xmath130 and large @xmath144 , by a rescaled parameter @xmath7 which measures locally the mean - square symmetry breaking matrix element in units of the mean eigenvalue spacing of @xmath14 .    the type of a be , appearing during the cross - over , depends on the nature of stationary ensembles @xmath145 and their different pairs may give rise to different bes @xcite .",
    "the present knowledge of ten types of stationary ensembles @xcite leads to possibility of many such cross - overs and , consequently , many types of bes . for example , the hamiltonian of a disordered system or an autonomous chaotic system , with time - reversal symmetry , can usually be modeled by gaussian orthogonal ensemble .",
    "the breaking of time - reversal symmetry e.g. by switching of a magnetic field , with @xmath130 as a measure of the breaking , perturbs the hamiltonian @xmath46 .",
    "the statistical behavior of the system now depends on the energy - range of interest . at asymptotically large energies",
    ", the statistics can be modeled by gaussian unitary ensembles ; however at intermediate energies with sufficiently small values of @xmath130 , an intermediate statistics ( a be between goe and gue ) would be obtained , indicative of a non - equilibrium behavior .",
    "similarly if the system is integrable with regular classical motion for @xmath146 and fully chaotic for @xmath147 , the statistics undergoes the poisson @xmath0 goe crossover ; ( the be in this case is a superposition of poisson and goe ensembles ) . for many type of crossovers ,",
    "beginning from various stationary states e.g. goe , gse , 2goe , poisson , uniform etc and approaching gue in limit @xmath137 , the @xmath148 order correlation functions for all @xmath7 have been explicitly evaluated @xcite ; for the other transitions the correlations are given implicitly by a hierarchic set of relations @xcite .    here",
    "we discuss only the bes appearing during a transition from poisson @xmath0 wigner - dyson ensemble ( referred as wigner - dyson transition or wdt ) caused by a perturbation of the former by the latter ( that is , taking @xmath46 , @xmath140 as poisson and wigner - dyson ensemble respectively ) . as this transition results in a change of localized eigenstates to delocalized ones ,",
    "its relevance for the study of mit is intuitively suggested .",
    "the bes related to the poisson @xmath0 wigner - dyson transition can be described by a @xmath149 ensemble @xmath14 represented by the following probability distribution for all ( independent ) matrix elements : @xmath150 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath151 ; here @xmath152 for @xmath153 or @xmath154 .",
    "an ensemble @xmath14 given by the above measure , is also known as rosenzweig - porter ensemble ( rpe ) ; note it also corresponds to an ensemble of anderson hamiltonians with very long range , isotropic , random hopping .",
    "the eq.(8 ) describes the evolution of the eigenvalues of a generalized gaussian ensemble with a probability density ( 1 ) and is therefore applicable for the bes defined by a probability density ( 9 ) too .",
    "a comparison of measure ( 9 ) with measure ( 1 ) , gives a variance @xmath155 , @xmath156 and mean @xmath104 for all @xmath65 and @xmath157 indices . using these values in eq.(4 ) , the parameter @xmath47 for the be case can be given as    @xmath158    with @xmath159 and @xmath160 as the complexity parameter of the ensemble @xmath46 ( note , @xmath57 for @xmath154 ) .",
    "a typical matrix in the ensemble ( 9 ) has the diagonal elements of order @xmath161 and off - diagonals of the order of @xmath162 .",
    "the number of off - diagonals being @xmath144 times more than the diagonals , the matrix behavior is governed by the parameter @xmath163 .",
    "thus , for large be ( @xmath164 ) , a radical change from wigner - dyson case can only occur if @xmath163 increases more rapidly than @xmath144 ( which makes the total strength of the off - diagonals weaker than that of diagonals ) .",
    "this results in three different regimes of the mean - level density @xmath165 @xcite :    @xmath166    with @xmath167 as an @xmath144-independent constant .",
    "although the exact form of the function @xmath168 is not known , its limiting behavior can be given as follows : @xmath169 for @xmath170 and @xmath171 for @xmath172 , @xmath173 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath174 order correlation @xmath175 , also known as mean level density , changes from an exponential to semi - circular form at the scale of @xmath176 with @xmath177 as the local mean level spacing ; the evolution of @xmath175 can therefore be described in terms of the parameter @xmath178 .",
    "however the transition of higher order correlations @xmath179 @xmath180 occurs at a scales determined by @xmath181 @xcite . as a result , their transition to equilibrium , with @xmath182 as the evolution parameter , is rapid , discontinuous for infinite dimensions of matrices @xcite .",
    "but for small-@xmath47 and large @xmath144 , a smooth crossover can be seen in terms of a rescaled parameter @xmath183 : @xmath184 for finite @xmath144 , @xmath7 varies smoothly with changing @xmath163 : @xmath185 .",
    "this results in a continuous family of bes , parameterized by @xmath7 , existing between poisson and wigner - dyson limit .",
    "however the level - statistics for the large be ( @xmath164 ) can be divided into three regions @xcite :    \\(i ) * poisson regime : @xmath186 * : the off - diagonals , responsible for the correlation between levels , are negligible . the lack of repulsion between levels results in a mean level spacing @xmath187 ( see eq.(12 ) ) , thereby , giving @xmath188 and the poisson statistics .",
    "\\(ii ) * wd regime : @xmath189 * : the contribution from both , the diagonals as well as off - diagonals is of the same order , leading to long - range correlations between levels .",
    "the repulsion of levels now results in a mean level spacing @xmath190 .",
    "( see eq.(13 ) ) which gives @xmath191 and wigner - dyson statistics .",
    "( iii)*critical regime : @xmath192= a constant * : for @xmath193 with @xmath194 as a constant independent of @xmath144 , a sequence of approximately @xmath195 levels show wigner - dyson behavior .",
    "the more distant levels display weak correlations of the type existing near the poisson limit resulting in a @xmath196 .",
    "the parameter @xmath7 is therefore @xmath144-independent : @xmath197 note it is also independent of the symmetry parameter @xmath26 .",
    "the finite , non - zero @xmath7-value for @xmath193 in limit @xmath198 therefore gives rise to a third statistics , intermediate between poisson and wigner - dyson ensemble , which is known as the critical brownian ensemble ( cbe ) .",
    "this being the case for arbitrary values of @xmath194 ( non - zero and finite ) , an infinite family of critical be , characterized by @xmath194 ( or @xmath199 ) , occurs during wdt .",
    "note that the critical bes , with @xmath200 and @xmath201 , correspond to the poisson and wigner - dyson limit , respectively .",
    "the presence of a family of the critical bes can be seen from any of the fluctuation measures for wdt .",
    "one traditionally used measure in this regard is the relative behavior of the tail of nearest - neighbor spacing distribution @xmath202 , defined as @xmath203 with @xmath204 as any one of the crossing points of @xmath205 and @xmath206 ( here subscript @xmath207 and @xmath208 refer to the wigner - dyson case and poisson case respectively ) @xcite . in the limit @xmath198 , @xmath209 and @xmath210 for wigner - dyson and poisson",

    "further the convergence of @xmath211-values for bes with different @xmath163 and @xmath144-values on two branches indicates the presence of a scaling behavior in the level - statistics of bes with @xmath213 ( = @xmath214 ) as the scaling parameter .    as shown in figure 1(a ) , @xmath211 for a critical be is between @xmath218 and @xmath210 .",
    "a fractional value of @xmath211 indicates a tail - behavior of critical be different from that of poisson as well as wigner - dyson limit . as shown in figure 1(b ) , the @xmath219 for a critical be with a finite parameter @xmath194 has an exponential tail , @xmath220 ; this behavior of @xmath219 is also sometimes referred as semi - poisson distribution , due to presence of repulsion at small energy - scales and exponential decay at large separations .",

    "in past , a random matrix ensemble , namely , power law random banded matrix ( prbm ) ensemble was suggested as a possible model for the critical level statistics of anderson hamiltonian @xcite .",

    ", the level - statistics of a prbm can be mapped to a critical be ensemble with @xmath457    the spectral statistics of prbm therefore shows a crossover from from poisson ( as @xmath200 for @xmath458 i.e @xmath459 ) to wigner - dyson behavior ( @xmath201 for @xmath460 or @xmath461 ) .",
    "the spectral compressibility @xmath305 for a prbm ensemble at @xmath336 can now be obtained by substituting @xmath462 in the eqs.(34,35,41 ) which give @xmath463 the above results are at least in the same form as obtained in @xcite ; the lack of explicit knowledge of @xmath296 prevents us from making any further comparison . as @xmath305 , in the eq.(45 )",

    "a same violation was observed in previous prbm studies @xcite too .",
    "thus our results obtained by using prbm - be analogy seem to be in accordance with earlier studies on prbm model .    in brief , the prbm ensemble , with @xmath32 as a parameter , can be mapped to critical be with parameter @xmath194 ( see eq.(44 ) ) . as a consequence , the studies suggesting the analogy of spectral statistics for the prbm and ae ensembles are well in agreement with our study claiming the ae - be analogy . by using the connection of prbm with mns model @xcite , the prbm - be - ae analogy",
    "can further be extended to mns - be - ae analogy .",
    "in the end , we re - emphasize our main result :    under independent electron approximation , the level - statistics for the disordered systems undergoing localization @xmath0 delocalization transition of wavefunctions can be described by the brownian ensembles ( with uncorrelated elements ) undergoing a similar transition .",
    "the analogy helps us in making following deductions :    \\(i ) the transition in the statistics is governed by a single scaling parameter @xmath465 .",
    "the second equality follows from the dependence of wavefunction statistics e.g inverse participation ratio @xmath234 and therefore @xmath232 on the complexity parameter @xmath182 .",
    "\\(ii ) the level - statistics is governed by the competition between complexity parameter and local mean level spacing . the critical point of level statistics occurs when the complexity parameter @xmath129 and @xmath177 have same size dependence . in particular , if @xmath466 and @xmath467 for a disordered system , its critical point will occur when @xmath468 .",
    "however if the local mean level spacing in the system changes at a faster rate with size as compared to @xmath315 ( i.e @xmath469 ) , the system will never reach its critical state and will always remain in the localized regime .",
    "\\(iii ) the critical be analog of a critical ae is unique .",
    "further , it is different for critical ae with and without time - reversal symmetry .",
    "similar to aes , the level - statistics of bes shows a scaling behavior as well as a critical point with fractional level - compressibility .",
    "however , unlike aes , the @xmath305 turns out to be symmetry dependent for bes , their parameter @xmath7 being symmetry independent .",
    "\\(iv ) the ae - be analogy confirms the symmetry - independence of the compressibility of levels and the multifractality of the wavefunctions at the critical point of anderson transition .",
    "the analogy also indicates the non - validity of relation @xmath470 in the strong multifractality limit , and , the approximate nature of the relation @xmath430 .",
    "\\(v ) the ae - be analogy helps us in formulating , for the first time , the exact 2-point level density correlation at the critical point of a disordered system .",
    "the formulation is applicable for a wide range of system parametric conditions .",
    "it should be noted that both mit as well as wdt occur due to delocalization of the wavefunctions .",
    "in fact , our analytical study suggests that the level - statistics of almost all complex systems undergoing a localization @xmath0 delocalization transition follows the same route although with different transition rates ; the state of level - statistics of two systems with different complexity may correspond to two different points on this route . in principle , our analytical work is applicable to the gaussian models of complex systems only , however the intuition based on earlier studies suggest the validity of the results for the systems with other origins of randomness too @xcite .",
    "for example , the investigation of a number of dynamical systems seems to support this intuition .",
    "it has been shown that the spectral statistics of pseudo - integrable billiards is remarkably similar to the critical statistics of ae @xcite .",
    "the presence of a statistics intermediate between the poisson and goe has already been shown for the kicked rotor in the non - integrable regime of the kicking parameter @xcite .",
    "a correspondence of the integrable systems to the insulators and of the chaotic systems to the metals is already known to exist .",
    "the integrability @xmath0 chaos transition in the dynamical systems therefore seems to follow a route in the level - statistics similar to that of mit ; note such a transition in classical systems corresponds to a delocalization of the wavefunctions in their quantum analog .",
    "thus the analogy of the statistical level fluctuations between ae and be may possibly be extended to dynamical systems and be too ; if the latter is found to be correct , the analogy would be useful to obtain the correlations for the non - integrable regime .",
    "the evidence of such an analogy would suggest the existence of several features , unknown so far , for the level statistics of dynamical systems .",
    "for example , the analogy can be used to intuitively claim and search for the existence of a critical point , the dimensional dependence of level - statistics and the multifractality of eigenfunctions during the transition from integrable to chaotic dynamics .",
    "it should be noted that a generic one - dimensional dynamical system always shows a poisson level - statistics ( in analogy with one - dimensional ae ) .",
    "however the dynamics in a 3-dimensional system shows a feature namely `` arnold diffusion '' , absent in lower dimensions .",
    "the intuition based on the above analogy suggests the possible existence of a critical level statistics at the parametric values at which arnold diffusion takes place .",
    "a further exploration of such an analogy is therefore highly desirable .",
