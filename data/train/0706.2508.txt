    "coupling a large number of spin @xmath0 to a total spin @xmath1 state ( singlet ) leads to a very rich class of wavefunctions which are the central pieces of many physical problems ranging from condensed matter to quantum information .",
    "indeed , the singlet state plays a major role in quantum magnetism especially in the low temperature properties of su(2 ) heisenberg frustrated antiferromagnets  : below the finite spin gap energy scale , the physics is dominated by rather exotic singlet ground states ( valence bond crystal , plaquettes state , spin - liquid ,  ) and often not so well understood low lying singlet excitations  @xcite .",
    "it also attracted considerable interest since anderson suggested that the resonating valence bond ( singlet ) state ( rvb ) is the relevant insulating parent state of high-@xmath2 superconductivity  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , these genuine quantum objects naturally emerge in the different context of quantum information because they are somehow paradigmatic of entanglement . indeed , the simplest singlet ( @xmath1 ) wavefunction , namely the dimer state , is a maximally entangled state made out two spin @xmath3 . for large systems ,",
    "singlet wavefunction can naturally lead to massive entanglement  @xcite .    obtaining a simple and tractable description of singlet states when the number of spins becomes large ,",
    "is thus a crucial issue . in that respect ,",
    "it has been shown since the early days of quantum mechanics that valence bond ( vb ) states  @xcite are a much more convenient and elegant approach to this question than expansions of singlets as linear combinations of @xmath4 eigenstates .",
    "indeed , hulthn showed  @xcite that any singlet state can be written as a ( non unique ) linear combination of vb states , i.e. arbitrary range coverings of the @xmath5 sites with dimers  : @xmath6,\\ ] ] where @xmath7 = ( 1/\\sqrt{2 } ) ( \\vert\\!\\!\\uparrow_i \\downarrow_j \\rangle - \\vert\\!\\!\\downarrow_i \\uparrow_j \\rangle ) $ ] and @xmath8 is a dimer covering of the system , defined as a partition of the @xmath9 ensemble into @xmath10 _ oriented _ couples of sites @xmath11 ( see figure [ fig : vb ] ) .",
    "two vb states corresponding to the coverings @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the overlap diagram obtained by the superimposition @xmath14 involves a set a closed loops . ]    however , while emphasizing the role of an apparently intuitive source of spin correlation and entanglement ( namely the `` bond dimer '' ) , this approach leads to a non - orthogonal and massively overcomplete  @xcite description of singlet states that , in turn , destroys any interpretation of dimers as hardcore objects  @xcite .",
    "paradoxically enough , this conceptually problematic `` dimer fuzziness '' ( caused by the intrinsic non - orthogonality of these objects ) does not lead to major inconsistencies when neglected .",
    "let us select three significant examples , from the contexts of quantum magnetism and quantum information , where this apparently ill - defined notion of bond occupation appears either implicitly or explicitly and is shown to give yet interesting and consistent results  : ( i ) the liang - douot - anderson ( lda ) wavefunction  @xcite convincingly reinforces the idea that spin correlations can be driven by individual vb strength tuning , and in the same spirit sandvik  @xcite obtained very consistent results for the vb length distribution while mentioning the potential definition problem , ( ii ) the rokhsar - kivelson quantum dimer model  @xcite that considers dimers as hardcore and orthogonal objects is widely accepted as a good starting point to the study of su(2 ) highly frustrated ( or more generally gapped ) heisenberg antiferromagnets  @xcite , ( iii ) alet  @xcite recently introduced a vb entanglement entropy numerically shown to capture all the features of the von neumann entanglement entropy but defined as if dimers where hardcore and orthogonal objects .    in this article , we use a general functional framework to describe any singlet wavefunctions that allows to demonstrate that a vb occupation number testing the presence / absence of a su(2 ) dimer on a given pair of spins can be defined and computed unambiguously as an intrinsic property of any su(2 )",
    "singlet state .",
    "the implications are threefold  : ( i ) we show that su(2 ) singlets actually share some of the intuitive hardcore - like features of quantum dimers , ( ii ) we give rigorous basis for relevant albeit apparently ill - defined quantities introduced recently in the context of quantum magnetism such as vb length distribution  @xcite or quantum information such as vb entanglement entropy  @xcite and give a systematic scheme to define consistently a wide family of quantities analogous to high order spin correlation , ( iii ) the functional mapping provides a convenient framework for further studies of correlated and entangled quantum spin or qubits systems and can be extended to arbitrary values of spin @xmath15 and total spin @xmath16 .",
    "the paper is organized as follow : in the first section we introduce and demonstrate the validity of the functional mapping . in the second part",
    "the vb occupation number is explicitly defined and shown to be the parent quantity for vb length distribution  @xcite and vb entanglement entropy  @xcite .",
    "the final section is devoted to the generalization of the vb occupation number concept to arbitrary order vb correlation functions and the extension to higher spin @xmath15 and total spin @xmath16 values of the functional mapping .",
    "we introduce on each site @xmath17 of the @xmath5-spin system a real ( or complex ) variable @xmath18 and associate to any dimer covering @xmath12 the @xmath5-variable function @xmath19 defined by  : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a function of @xmath18 and @xmath22 that will be determined later .",
    "each function @xmath23 of the mapping corresponds to a pure vb state @xmath24 defined by ( [ eq : rvb ] ) .",
    "the key properties of the vb states are their non - orthogonality and overcompleteness , both being closely related .",
    "let us us recall the overlap rule that allows to compute the overlap  @xcite between two vb configurations @xmath8 and @xmath13 , @xmath25 @xmath26 being the number of closed loops in the overlap diagram obtained by superimposing both configurations @xmath8 and @xmath13 and @xmath27 the sign coming from the relative orientations of dimers in @xmath8 and @xmath13 ( see figure [ fig : vb ] ) .",
    "the overcompleteness of the basis implies its non - orthogonality and on the other hand , all the linear relations between vb states are implicitly encoded into the overlap matrix @xmath28  : because any singlet state can be expressed as a linear combination of arbitrary range vb states , the rank of @xmath28 is the singlet subspace size @xmath29 .",
    "its size being @xmath30 , all the overcompleteness of the basis is described by the @xmath31 independent singular eigenvectors of @xmath28 .",
    "hence , in order to obtain a faithful functional representation , it is necessary and sufficient to determine @xmath21 and define a scalar product @xmath32 acting on these functions that mimics the usual scalar product for vb states  : @xmath33 .",
    "let us show that @xmath21 can be chosen as @xmath34 and @xmath35    given the form ( [ eq : rep ] ) , @xmath36 involves bond terms and each variable @xmath18 appears exactly twice .",
    "hence , this term can be represented graphically by the set of even size closed loops of the overlap diagram ( see figure [ fig : vb ] ) .",
    "loops being disconnected , @xmath32 is just a product of the individual loop ( @xmath37 ) traces contributions , @xmath38 with , for a loop of size @xmath39 , @xmath40 choosing ( [ eq : dimer_rep ] ) implies that only two sequences , @xmath41 , give a non vanishing contribution to @xmath42 . as a consequence , @xmath43 with @xmath44 the size ( number of sites ) of the loop and @xmath45 the contribution of the loop @xmath37 to the global sign @xmath46 . because the total size of the loops is just the number of sites @xmath5 , the overlap @xmath47 as expected .    using ( [ eq : scalar_product_rep ] ) , we showed that the set of functions @xmath48 have the same linear properties as the vb states ( [ eq : rvb ] ) and thus provides an algebraic mapping of the singlet subspace  @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that this mapping is general as it establishes a one to one correspondence between any vb state ( [ eq : rvb ] ) and its functional counterpart ( [ eq : rep2 ] )  : any subclass of vb states maps to its corresponding subclass both defining isomorphic hilbert spaces . in the next section ,",
    "we show ( i ) the particular role of the subset made of bipartite vb states , ( ii ) that valence bond occupation number is unambiguously defined using bipartite vb states despite non - orthogonality and overcompleteness .",
    "( a ) arrangement of @xmath5 spins around a circle , alternating @xmath49 sites and @xmath50 sites .",
    "( b ) in the definition ( [ eq : count_operator ] ) of bond @xmath51 occupation operator , the limit for @xmath52 is taken to @xmath53 for @xmath49 sites and @xmath54 for @xmath55 sites except for @xmath18 and @xmath22 for which the inverse convention is used  : @xmath56 if @xmath17 ( or @xmath57 ) is part of @xmath50 and @xmath58 if @xmath17 ( or @xmath57 ) is part of @xmath49 . ]",
    "_ bipartition . _",
    "the overcompleteness of the full vb basis prevents to define consistently a vb occupation number .",
    "we now show that such a definition is possible by restraining expansions of singlet states to a subset of @xmath59 , yet overcomplete and spanning all the singlet sector .",
    "let us partition the @xmath5-spin system into two @xmath10-spin subsets denoted @xmath60 and @xmath55  @xcite .",
    "we consider the subset @xmath61 of @xmath62 containing the @xmath63 bipartite vb states  : @xmath64.\\ ] ] @xmath61 also provides an overcomplete description of the singlet subspace  : let us arrange the @xmath5 spins on a circle in such a way that @xmath49 sites alternate with @xmath50 sites ( see figure [ fig : bipartite ] ( a ) ) and choose an arbitrary singlet state @xmath65 .",
    "as shown by rumer  @xcite , there exist at least one decomposition of @xmath65 as a linear combination of _ non - crossing _",
    "@xcite vb states . a simple inspection at figure [ fig : bipartite ] ( a ) shows that these non - crossing states are also bipartite .",
    "the occurence of a non - bipartite dimer would lead to the existence of an odd sized arc , hence causing at least one crossing . as a consequence any singlet state @xmath65 can be written as",
    ", @xmath66 this decomposition is not unique due to @xmath67 independent linear relations that reflect the overcompleteness of @xmath61 .",
    "_ bond occupation .",
    "_ we denote by @xmath68 the occupation number of a bond @xmath51 ( bipartite or not ) in a bipartite vb state @xmath24 ( [ eq : bip_rvb ] ) and define it as , @xmath69 for any singlet state @xmath65 decomposed on @xmath61 as ( [ eq : bip_decomposition ] ) , we show that the bond occupation @xmath70 is _ independent _ of the decomposition ( [ eq : bip_decomposition ] ) used , hence providing a consistent intrinsic definition of a bond occupation number for any singlet state .",
    "this statement is valid if any relation of overcompleteness implies its bond occupation counterpart  : @xmath71    to demonstrate this point , let us use the functional mapping presented in the previous section and introduce the operator @xmath72 acting on the functions of the mapping , @xmath73 with @xmath74 or @xmath75 ( resp .",
    "@xmath76 ) if @xmath17 or @xmath77 ( resp .",
    "@xmath55 ) ( see figure [ fig : bipartite ] ( b ) ) . one can easily check that @xmath72 have the following properties  : ( i ) linearity  : @xmath78 , ( ii ) for any @xmath79 , @xmath80 if @xmath81 and @xmath82 if @xmath83 . using ( [ eq : rep2 ] ) , l.h.s . of equation ( [ eq : overcompleteness ] ) becomes , @xmath84 and applying @xmath72 to ( [ eq : overcompleteness_mapping ] ) immediately leads to the r.h.s . of ( [ eq : overcompleteness ] ) which concludes the demonstration .    at this point , it is important to mention that @xmath68 is reminiscent of a bond correlation @xmath85 but is _ essentially different_. indeed , @xmath86 for any pure vb state .",
    "but , in the generic case of a superposition ( [ eq : bip_decomposition ] ) , both notions decouple due to the off - diagonal terms induced by the non - orthogonality of vb states  : @xmath87    _ illustration . _ for @xmath88 ( then @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 ) we define the bipartite vb states taking @xmath92 and @xmath93 . the overcomplete bipartite vb basis is  : @xmath94[3,4][5,6]$ ] , @xmath95[3,2][5,4]$ ] , @xmath96[5,2][3,6]$ ] , @xmath97[3,6][5,4]$ ] , @xmath98[3,2][5,6]$ ] and @xmath99[5,2][3,4]$ ] .",
    "the sole relation of overcompleteness writes @xmath100+@xmath101+@xmath102-@xmath103-@xmath104-@xmath105 .",
    "we can check that e.g. the occupation of bond @xmath106 on the singlet state @xmath107 that can be directly evaluated to @xmath108 is indeed independent of the decomposition  : @xmath109 leads to @xmath110 . on the other hand ,",
    "the expectation value of @xmath111 is 5 and not @xmath112 for this state .",
    "_ vb length distribution & vb entanglement entropy .",
    "_ using this result any quantity built out from bond occupation / vacancy scheme on a singlet state @xmath65 can be defined unambiguously .",
    "the vb length distribution computed in @xcite writes , @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the total occupation of bonds with length @xmath37 .",
    "a definition of the vb entanglement entropy introduced in  @xcite as an equivalent of von neumann entanglement entropy measurement of the bipartite entanglement between subsystems @xmath115 and @xmath116 spanning the all system is , @xmath117",

    "exhibit a duality in the mapping between the dimer representation @xmath118 and a dimer susceptibility @xmath119 .",
    "it is then straightforward to introduce @xmath120order vb occupation numbers ( or _ vb correlation functions _ ) , similar to @xmath121spin correlation functions , by defining _ linear _ operators in the spirit of ( [ eq : count_operator ] ) containing more than one bond susceptibility @xmath122 .",
    "the analogous of equation ( [ eq : not_correlation ] ) for such an operator , shows that both quantities are equivalent for a pure vb state but becomes distinct yet consistently defined for a vb superposition . while much simpler to compute",
    ", we infer that vb correlation functions provide the same insights than usual correlations functions when computed on a given singlet state .    _ higher total spin sectors for @xmath0 .",
    "_ following hulthn s scheme  @xcite higher total spin @xmath16 sectors with fixed total @xmath123 can be ( overcompletely ) represented by introducing in the coverings ( [ eq : rvb ] ) an arbitrary range totally symmetrized state of @xmath124 spins @xmath125 .",
    "the functional mapping can be extended to these case in the spirit of ( [ eq : dimer_rep ] ) using the generating function @xmath126 and representing @xmath125 with @xmath127 in particular @xmath128 represents the @xmath129 bond triplet .",
    "mixed total spin state such as the nel state can be represented as well in this framework  : if we denote @xmath49 the @xmath10-site sublattice with up spins , it is easy to check that the corresponding nel state is represented by @xmath130 since , using ( [ eq : scalar_product_rep ] ) , @xmath131 for any bipartite @xmath12 .    _ singlet sector for higher spins @xmath15 . _ as noticed by tasaki  @xcite , vb concept can be extended to higher values of @xmath15  : @xmath7_s = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2s+1 } } \\sum_{s_z =- s}^{+s } ( -1)^{s - s_z } \\vert -s_z,+s_z\\rangle$ ] . the overlap @xmath132 ( [ eq : overlap ] ) becomes @xmath133 with @xmath134 for integer @xmath15 .",
    "it can be readily checked that choosing @xmath135 and enlarging the support of the sum defining the scalar product ( [ eq : scalar_product_rep ] ) to @xmath136 leads to @xmath137 thus providing the extension of the mapping .",
    "the proof that @xmath15-spins vb states provide an overcomplete description of the singlet sector ( if @xmath5 is large enough to ensure that the number of coverings is larger than size of the singlet sector ) is beyond the scope of this article  @xcite .",
    "any su(2 ) singlet state can be characterized by a set of bond occupation numbers  : despite the fuzziness induced by the overcompleteness of the vb basis , singlet wavefunctions conserve intuitive hardcore dimer features such as the possibility of deciding whether a su(2 ) dimer live on a bond or not .",
    "this genuine quantum property formalizes the suggestive idea behind the lda wavefunction  @xcite that vb bond strength can drive the correlations properties of the singlet wavefunction and gives insights to the question of the interplay between non - orthogonality , overcompleteness and hardcore properties . moreover , this allows consistent definitions of quantities relevant for quantum magnetism ( vb length distribution  @xcite and vb correlations  @xcite of any order ) or quantum information ( vb entanglement entropy  @xcite ) emphasizing the intuitive role of dimers as elementary bricks to build correlations or entanglement .",
    "we note that all these quantities are particularly suitable for numerical calculation in the framework introduced by sandvik  @xcite . from a methodological point of view ,",
    "the functional mapping used to derive this result appears as a suggestive tool to describe quantum spin or qubits systems and can be extended naturally to higher spins @xmath15 and higher total spin @xmath16 sectors .      c.  waldtmann , h .- u .",
