    "an almost thorough analysis of linear stage of thermal instability was given in a well - known paper by field(1965 ) .",
    "he showed that thermal instability can lead to the rapid growth of density perturbations from infinitesimal @xmath0 to nonlinear amplitudes on a cooling time - scale , @xmath1 , in which for typical conditions in the interstellar medium ( ism ) is short compared to the dynamical time - scale @xmath2 .",
    "of the purely thermal modes , the most relevant for the ism is the isobaric mode which has been discussed in terms of the formation of distinct phases of the ism ( field , goldsmith & habing 1969 ) and the formation of protostars in a cooling ism ( schwarz , mccray & stein 1972 ) .",
    "the isentropic mode has also found application in the ism and has been discussed with regard to the amplification of acoustic waves in a warm ism ( @xmath3 ) ( flannery & press 1979 ) . a more detailed investigation of the growth of condensations in cooling regions has been presented by balbus(1986,1991 ) who examined the effect of magnetic field .",
    "+ high resolution studies of the magnetic molecular clouds , reveal that they have internal structures on all scales and are typically clumpy or filamentary ( falgarone , puget & prault 1992 , langer et al 1995 ) , with prolate and oblate ( disc - like ) clumps ( ryden 1996 ) .",
    "gammie et al ( 2003 ) have recently studied the three dimensional analogs of clumps .",
    "they have concluded that nearly @xmath4 of the clumps are prolate and @xmath5 of them are oblate .",
    "the origin and shape of these clumps is a disputable issue .",
    "thermal instability and turbulence may be two responsible parameters .",
    "+ in molecular clouds , the dispersion velocity inferred from molecular line width is often larger than the gas sound speed inferred from transition temperatures ( solomon et al 1987 ) .",
    "mhd turbulence may be responsible for the stirring of these clouds ( arons & max 1975 ) .",
    "because of these turbulent motions , molecular clouds must be transient structures , and are probably dispersed after not much more than @xmath6 ( larson 1981 ) . since cooling time - scale of molecular clouds",
    "is approximately @xmath7 ( gilden 1984 ) , thermal instability may be a coordinated trigger mechanism for clump formation .",
    "turbulence , in the second stage , can deform these small - scale clumps in shape and orient them relative to the magnetic fields .",
    "+ gilden(1984 ) calculated the net cooling function for molecular clouds and found that in environments where co cooling dominates , molecular gas may be thermally unstable .",
    "he suggested that thermal instability may be an important source of small - scale clumps in fully molecular clouds .",
    "burkert & lin(2000 ) have recently proposed that clumpyness in cold clouds arises naturally from their formation through a cooling instability which acts on time - scales that can be much shorter than the dynamical time - scale of the cloud .",
    "afterward , gomez - pelaez & moreno - insertis(2002 ) have investigated the effect of self - gravity and thermal conduction on a cooling and expanding medium .",
    "they classified importance of various physical processes including self - gravity , background expansion , cooling , and thermal conduction according to their relative time - scales .",
    "+ on the other hand , observations establish that magnetic fields play an important role in shaping the structure and dynamics of molecular clouds .",
    "especially , ambipolar drift , or ion - neutral friction , has long been thought to be an important energy dissipation mechanism in magnetic molecular clouds ( scalo 1977 ) .",
    "if @xmath8 represents the characteristic dimension over which the magnetic field varies ( the wavelength of perturbation ) , the time - scale of ambipolar diffusion in a typical molecular cloud may be approximated as @xmath9 ( shu 1991 ) .",
    "we expect that for a critical wavelength ( @xmath10 ) which @xmath11 , ambipolar diffusion may be important .",
    "thus , in view of this importance , we would interested to investigate the effect of it on thermal instability and formation of small - scale clumps in the magnetic molecular clouds .",
    "we suggest that shape of oblate clumps is formed from their early stage of evolution , via thermal instability . + for this purpose , in the first step , we turn our attention to the linear stage and neglect the effect of self - gravity and background expansion or contraction . section ii of this paper develops the theory of linear thermal instability in the presence of ambipolar diffusion . in  iii , we obtain a non - dimensional characteristic equation which can reduce to the field s characteristic equation in the absence of ambipolar diffusion .",
    "then , we discuss about the domains of stability ( or instability ) of this characteristic equation .",
    "we find a critical wavelength which the effect of ambipolar diffusion is very important and small - scale disc - like clumps can be formed .",
    "finally , a conclusion is given in ",
    "a molecular cloud gas includes neutral atoms and molecules , atomic and molecular ions , and electrons , which are the primary current carriers . since significant charge separation",
    "can not be sustained on the time - scale of interest , so the electrons and ions move together . + in principle ,",
    "the ion velocity @xmath12 and the neutral velocity @xmath13 should be determined by solving separate fluid equations for these species ( draine 1986 ) , including their coupling by collision processes .",
    "but , in our interested time - scale of cooling ( @xmath14 , gilden 1984 ) , two fluids of ion and neutral are well coupled by together , thus we can use the basic equations as follows ( shu 1991 ) @xmath15 @xmath16 @xmath17 @xmath18\\}\\ ] ] @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the lagrangian time derivative and @xmath21 is the coefficient of thermal conduction .",
    "@xmath22 is the polytropic index of the ideal gas , @xmath23 is the mean atomic mass per particle , @xmath24 is the universal gas constant , and @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the ion - neutral relative velocity with impinging cross section @xmath27 . in writing the above equations",
    ", we used the relation @xmath28 between ion density and neutral density ( nakano 1980 ) .",
    "since , the ion density is much less than the neutral density , in a good approximation we estimate @xmath29 @xmath30 is the net cooling function ( @xmath31 ) as follows @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the total heating rate and @xmath34 is the cooling rate which can be written as ( goldsmith & langer 1978 ) @xmath35 where @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 are constants .",
    "the range of @xmath38 is @xmath39 to @xmath40 .",
    "the constant @xmath37 is greater than zero for optically thin case and less than zero for optically thick case .",
    "models of molecular clouds identify several different heating mechanisms ; cosmic rays , @xmath41 formation , @xmath41 dissociation , grain photoelectrons , collisions with warm dust , gravitational contraction , and ambipolar diffusion .",
    "the rate for these processes are largely unknown .",
    "sticking efficiency on grains , grain composition and lattice structures , cosmic ray spectra and flux , efficiency of cosmic ray penetration into clouds , magnetic field strengths and geometry , and the fractional ionization are a few disputable parameters . in this paper",
    "we consider the heating rates of cosmic rays , @xmath41 formation , @xmath41 dissociation , grain photoelectrons , and collisions with warm dust as a constant @xmath42 ( glassgold & langer 1974 , goldsmith & langer 1978 ) .",
    "also , we disregard gravitational heating rate , since we neglect self - gravity and background contraction . the heating of the gas by magnetic ion - neutral slip is discussed in detail by scalo(1977 ) ; our simple estimate of this heating rate is as follows @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the drift velocity of the ions relative to the neutral . with above explanations / approximations and with introduction @xmath45 , in a good manner we choose the net cooling function as follows @xmath46 in the local homogeneous equilibrium state , we have @xmath47 , and @xmath48 .",
    "we assume perturbations of the form @xmath49 then the linearized equations are @xmath50 @xmath51 @xmath52 @xmath53\\}\\ ] ] @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are evaluated for the equilibrium state .",
    "+ we introduce the coordinate system @xmath57 specified by @xmath58 equations ( 13 ) and ( 15 ) may be used to uncouple @xmath59- the perturbed velocity in the plane perpendicular to both @xmath60 and @xmath61- from the reminder of the problem .",
    "disturbances perpendicular to the @xmath62-plane have a solution of the form @xmath63^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\ ] ] where @xmath64 is the alfvn velocity and @xmath65 .",
    "thus , in long wavelength perturbations that @xmath66 , waves are damped with ion - neutral friction and in short wavelength perturbations that @xmath67 , alfvn waves can not be existed .",
    "+ the motion in the other modes are constrained to the @xmath68-plane , and are governed by the characteristic equation , + @xmath69\\textbf{h}^3 + \\{k^2[c_s^3(k_t - k_\\rho)/\\gamma+a^2c_sk_t]+c_s^2h'k^2\\}\\textbf{h}^2 $ ] @xmath70\\textbf{h}+ ( k_t - k_\\rho)c_s^3a^2k^4\\cos^2\\theta/\\gamma=0\\ ] ] where @xmath71 is the laplacian speed of sound , @xmath72 is the angle between @xmath61 and @xmath60 , and @xmath73 are wavenumbers of sound waves whose angular frequencies are numerically equal to the growth rates of isothermal and isochoric perturbations , respectively .",
    "@xmath74 is the effect of ion - neutral slip .",
    "if we neglect the effect of the magnetic field and ambipolar diffusion ( @xmath75 ) , the characteristic equation ( 19 ) reduces to the equation ( 15 ) of field(1965 ) .",
    "by introducing the non - dimensional quantities , @xmath76 we can write the characteristic equation in the following form , + @xmath77\\textbf{y}^2 $ ] @xmath78\\textbf{y } + \\gamma^{-1}\\alpha(\\sigma_t-\\sigma_\\rho)\\cos^2\\theta=0\\ ] ] so that for each @xmath72 we have four free parameters that consist of @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 .",
    "we want to study the effect of ambipolar diffusion on stable region of the @xmath83 plane . for this purpose",
    ", we use the laguerre s method for finding the roots of the characteristic equation .",
    "+ first we consider the problem in the absence of the magnetic field ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "the stable region of this case is shown in fig .  1 .",
    "this result had been derived by field(1965 ) .",
    "now , we are interested to consider the effect of the magnetic field . for this purpose , we must consider the ambipolar diffusion because of small ion density in magnetic molecular clouds . in this case , we must break a lance to the complete characteristic equation ( 22 ) for different values of @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath72 .",
    "the stable regions of these typical instances are shown in fig .  2 .",
    "in this case , the line @xmath85 in fig .  1 is unchanged , corresponding to the breaking of the magnetic pressure for the reason of ion - neutral slipping and smallness of ions .",
    "but , the line @xmath86 in fig .  1 is brought down , corresponding to the dissipating ion - neutral slip heating during the compression phase of the wave .",
    "thus , ambipolar diffusion can stabilize the medium so that it s maximum effect is occurred at @xmath87 .",
    "+ inserting the net cooling function , equ.(10 ) , into the definitions of @xmath80 and @xmath79 , we get @xmath88 @xmath89\\ ] ] where @xmath90 is the ratio of ambipolar diffusion heating rate to the cooling rate as @xmath91 and @xmath92 is a defined wavelength as follows @xmath93 we separate two cases as follows    1 .",
    "@xmath94 which @xmath95 that is upwards of the @xmath83 plane . in this case",
    ", the medium is optically thin . as shown in fig .",
    "3(a ) , two regions of the @xmath83 plane are separated by a critical wavelength @xmath96 if the wavelength of perturbation is greater than this critical value , medium is stable . if @xmath97 , the magnetic molecular cloud is unstable and a spherical clump can be formed .",
    "@xmath98 which @xmath99 that is downwards of the @xmath83 plane.the optically thick molecular clouds set in this case . as shown in the fig .",
    "3(b ) , three regions of the @xmath83 plane are separated by two critical wavelengths @xmath100 if the wavelength of perturbation is greater than @xmath101 , the medium is stable . if @xmath102 , the molecular cloud is unstable and a spherical clump can be formed .",
    "depend on the values of @xmath82 and @xmath81 , we have semi - stable regions between @xmath103 and @xmath101 , which the thermal instability allows compression along the magnetic field but not perpendicular to it .    the increased area of semi - stable region ( shaded areas of fig .",
    "2 ) as a function of @xmath82 for three typical values of @xmath81 and for @xmath87 is plotted in fig .",
    "according to this figure , maximum of stability is occurred at a typical @xmath104 .",
    "thus , we may define a critical wavenumber @xmath105 at small wavelengths which @xmath106 , ambipolar diffusion can break the effect of the magnetic field on the whole matter , thus the value of @xmath107 is zero . on the other hand , at very large wavelengths which @xmath108 , ambipolar diffusion time - scale is very greater than the cooling time - scale , therefore we can neglect its effect , thus the value of @xmath107 must be zero , too .",
    "we have carried out a systematic analysis of the linear thermal instability of a locally uniform magnetic molecular cloud which , in the perturbed state , is undergoing ambipolar diffusion .",
    "although thermal instability proceeds faster than dynamical processes such as turbulence , its growth rate is determined by the local cooling rate .",
    "we choose a simple parametric net cooling function and discuss about its different parameters for unstability and clump formation .",
    "the small perturbation problem yields a complete characteristic equation that in the absence of the magnetic field and ambipolar diffusion , reduces to the prior results of the linear thermal instability . we have used the laguerre s method for finding the roots of this characteristic equation .",
    "+ the stable region by neglecting the magnetic field is shown in fig .  1 , while , fig .",
    "2 displays the stability region for typical values of the magnetic field ( @xmath81 ) and the ambipolar diffusion strength ( d ) .",
    "comparison of these figures indicate that ambipolar diffusion can stabilize the medium , in this manner that its maximum stabilization is occurred perpendicular to the magnetic field ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "thus , including the magnetic field and considering the ambipolar diffusion , divides the @xmath83 plane in three regions : stable region , unstable region , and semi - stable region . + by inserting the parametric general form of net cooling function into the definitions of @xmath79 and @xmath80",
    ", we find critical wavelengths which divide different cases of stability , instability , and semi - stability of the @xmath83 plane according to the wavelength of perturbation .",
    "if the physical parameters of the molecular cloud ( or the wavelength of perturbation ) settle on the unstable region of fig .  3 , a spherical clump must be formed . on the other hand ,",
    "if its parameters or the wavelength of perturbation settle on the semi - stable region , thermal instability allows compression along the local magnetic field but not perpendicular to it .",
    "therefore , including the magnetic field and ambipolar diffusion may be an evidence in formation of small - scale disc - like clumps in magnetic molecular clouds .",
    "+ since ambipolar diffusion time - scale depends on the wavelength of perturbation , we find a critical wavenumber which the effect of ambipolar diffusion for stabilizing the medium is very important .",
    "+ we have assumed a uniform background . in spite of this",
    ", our results are applicable locally in a non - uniform background if the perturbation wavelength is much less than the macroscopic variation length of the unperturbed quantities .",
    "+ we neglected the interaction and merging of the clumps .",
    "these processes become important for the subsequent evolution .",
    "we also neglected the effect of self - gravity and contraction or expansion of the background .",
