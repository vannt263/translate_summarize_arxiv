    "the mft then exhibits a remarkable symmetry : in the annealed case , this symmetry allows us to relate the generating functions of the integrated current @xmath2 for different values of the initial densities @xmath4 and @xmath3 .",
    "this relationship takes the form of the single - parameter dependence ( [ fdef ] ) @xmath189 with @xmath12 given by ( [ omega - def ] ) .",

    "thus , starting from the optimal profiles @xmath200 for a given set of parameters @xmath191 , one can deduce sets of profiles @xmath201 , obtained by performing an orthogonal transform on @xmath199 , which satisfy the same bulk minimization equations ( [ conservation - bis ] , [ h - evo ] ) as @xmath200 .",
    "therefore , for @xmath201 to be the optimal profiles for other values of the parameters @xmath192 , it is sufficient that they satisfy the corresponding boundary conditions : ( [ t=1-bis],[t=0-bis ] ) in the annealed case , and ( [ t=1-bis],[t=0-ter ] ) in the quenched case .",
