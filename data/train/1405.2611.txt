    "geodesics of the c - metric were earlier studied by pravda and pravdov @xcite in c - metric coordinates , as well as weyl coordinates and coordinates adapted to boost - rotation symmetry . in their paper they considered an analytical solution representing circular orbits around the accelerating black hole and analyzed their stability .",
