    "the twin spacecraft making up the stereo ( solar terrestrial relations observatory ) mission have already provided a rich dataset since launch in october 2006 , with images , both in the visible and in the extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) @xcite .",
    "these images are collected by the euvi ( extreme ultraviolet imager ) a and b imager and cor ( coronagraph ) 1 and cor2 a and b coronagraphs on the stereo a and b satellites as part of the secchi ( sun - earth connection coronal and heliospheric investigation ) instrument packages @xcite .",
    "each secchi suite consists of the following five telescopes : the euvi imager and cor1 and cor2 coronagraphs comprise the scip package pointing to the sun , complemented by the off - pointing hi ( heliospheric imager ) 1 and hi2 imagers observing the heliosphere .",
    "all imagers together cover the observational range from the sun to beyond 1 au .    besides the classical coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) that are identified in the fovs of the cor imagers ( _ e.g. _ ) , small scale collimated ejections of solar plasma are another common feature ( _ e.g. _ ) .",
    "these coronal jets are best observed inside polar coronal holes at euv wavelengths when the plasma beams are seen in emission against the dark background and are not obscured by bright ambient coronal structures .",
    "very early observations of coronal jets were provided by skylab and , in more details , later by yohkoh in the soft x - rays @xcite .",
    "polar coronal jets were studied by using images of the lasco ( large angle and spectrometric coronagraph ) and eit ( extreme ultraviolet imaging telescope ) instruments on board soho ( solar and heliospheric observatory ) .",
    "further observations were reported by with the trace ( transition region and coronal explorer ) spacecraft .",
    "more recently , also hinode has provided important data on polar jet parameters @xcite .",
    "x - ray jets have typical lengths of @xmath2@xmath3 km , widths of @xmath4@xmath5 km , and speeds ranging from 10 to 1000 km / s @xcite .",
    "it is usually assumed that the jet is the result of magnetic reconnection phenomena happening in the solar corona @xcite .",
    "coronal jets can be observed both in active regions , quiet sun , and coronal holes @xcite .",
    "a polar coronal jet has been studied for the first time stereoscopically with observations from the stereo / secchi imagers by , demostrating the existence of helical magnetic field lines in this event .",
    "the two points of view provided by the twin stereo satellites are very helpful for the identification of coronal hole jets .",
    "indeed , for the first time it is possible with stereo / secchi data to assess what is the three dimensional ( 3d ) structure of the jet , to understand what projection effects are present in single point observations , and to try to establish the true 3d velocity for the jet @xcite .    here",
    "we present the first catalogue of stereo polar coronal jets , comprising 79 events , which were observed by both euvi imagers in the ultraviolet , and contemporarily by the cor1 coronagraph in white - light , during the period at solar minimum at the end of solar cycle 23 from march 2007 to april 2008 .",
    "this time interval , during which the separation angle between the two spacecraft increased from 2 to 48 degrees with respect to the sun , includes two time periods of high time cadence observations in may 2007 and january 2008 .    the criteria according to which coronal jet events were identified and selected from the secchi dataset are explained in section 2 of this paper , including some brief summary of their basic characteristics .",
    "prototype events which also emphasize the difference of the viewpoints when seen either from stereo a or from stereo b , are shown in section 3 . in section 4 the lifetime distributions of jets in the different wavelengths in the euvi and in cor1",
    "fov are discussed .",
    "the conclusions are given in section 5 , followed by the catalogue of polar coronal jets in the appendix .",
    "secchi images are taken at four euv wavelengths centered at 171  , 195  , 284   with a time cadence of 2.5 , 10 , 20 minutes , and at 304   with a time cadence of 10 minutes . during high time cadence observations on may 519 , 2007 , and on january 720 , 2008",
    "the time cadences was 75 s in the 171 channel .",
    "the pixel size of the euvi ccd on the solar disk has a spatial resolution of 1.6 arcsec . because of the low time cadence of the 284   observations , in this jet study more events",
    "are seen in the 171 , 195 and 304   wavelength ranges .",
    "we began our systematic study of coronal jets in the secchi euvi a and b data after stereo s completed in - orbit insertion and the official science mission start on january 22 , 2007 , and after some follow on period of routine imaging , in march 2007 .",
    "for the search of coronal jets euvi images were used that are provided at the secchi website http://secchi.nrl.navy.mil/. secchi euvi a and b daily movies are available at http://cdaw.gsfc.nasa.gov / stereo / daily_movies/. the existence of subsequent jets in the cor1 a and b fovs were studied in the daily movies in intensity running difference available at http://cor1.gsfc.nasa.gov / dailymov / mpeg/. the running difference movies allow to identify faint transient coronal structures , _",
    "e.g. _ those hidden by coronal streamers .",

    "<S> in this paper we present the first comprehensive statistical study of euv coronal jets observed with the secchi ( sun earth connection coronal and heliospheric investigation ) imaging suites of the two stereo spacecraft . </S>",
    "<S> a catalogue of 79 polar jets is presented , identified from simultaneous euv and white - light coronagraph observations , taken during the time period march 2007 to april 2008 , when solar activity was at minimum . the twin spacecraft angular separation increased during this time interval from 2 to 48 degrees . </S>",
    "<S> the appearances of the coronal jets were always correlated with underlying small - scale chromospheric bright points . </S>",
    "<S> a basic characterisation of the morphology and identification of the presence of helical structure were established with respect to recently proposed models for their origin and temporal evolution . though each jet appeared morphologically similar in the coronagraph field of view , in the sense of a narrow collimated outward flow of matter , at the source region in the low corona the jet showed different characteristics which may correspond to different magnetic structures . </S>",
    "<S> a classification of the events with respect to previous jet studies shows that amongst the 79 events there were 37 _ </S>",
    "<S> eiffel tower_-type jet events commonly interpreted as a small - scale ( @xmath0 arcsec ) magnetic bipole reconnecting with the ambient unipolar open coronal magnetic fields at its looptops , and 12 _ lambda_-type jet events commonly interpreted as reconnection with the ambient field happening at the bipoles footpoints . </S>",
    "<S> five events were termed _ </S>",
    "<S> micro - cme _ type jet events because they resembled the classical coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) but on much smaller scales . </S>",
    "<S> the remainig 25 cases could not be uniquely classified . </S>",
    "<S> thirty - one of the total number of events exhibited a helical magnetic field structure , indicative for a torsional motion of the jet around its axis of propagation . </S>",
    "<S> a few jets are also found in equatorial coronal holes . in this study </S>",
    "<S> we present sample events for each of the jet types using both , stereo a and stereo b , perspectives . </S>",
    "<S> the typical lifetimes in the secchi / euvi ( extreme ultraviolet imager ) field of view between 1.0 to 1.7 @xmath1 and in secchi / cor1 field of view between 1.4 to 4 @xmath1 are obtained , and the derived speed are roughly estimated . in summary , </S>",
    "<S> the observations support the assumption of continuous small - scale reconnection as an intrinsic feature of the solar corona , with its role for the heating of the corona , particle acceleration , structuring and acceleration of the solar wind remaining to be explored in more details in further studies . </S>"
