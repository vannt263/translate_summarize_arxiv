    "being prepared for a summer school , these lecture notes are meant principally as a first introduction to the rather vast and rapidly growing area of research that deals with gravitational waves . as a result , these notes will simply provide the basic concepts of this field of research and briefly review the most important results .",
    "the bibliography is not meant to be complete and the sparse references are used mostly as pointers to review articles where the topics of these lectures find a more detailed discussion and where a complete presentation of the literature can be found . in what follows",
    "i will assume that the reader is proficient in basic tensor algebra , is familiar with the fundamental concepts in general relativity and has already encountered a black hole solution to einstein equations .",
    "the lecture notes are organized in three main parts . in the first one ,",
    "i rapidly introduce the basic properties of gravitational waves by deriving a wave solution of the einstein equations and discussing the sense of the transverse - traceless gauge",
    ". a brief discussion about the generation of gravitational waves will also be made . in the second part ,",
    "i discuss in some detail the perturbation properties of a schwarzschild black hole and the gravitational radiation that is expected as a result .",
    "finally , the third part is devoted to presenting the basic elements of the theory of stellar perturbations and how stellar perturbations can be used to generate gravitational waves .",
    "the discussion will be restricted to spherical oscillations in the case of relativistic stars and to nonradial oscillations in the case of newtonian stars",
    ". a brief classification of the modes of oscillations will also be presented together with an introduction to the onset of non - axisymmetric instabilities .",
    "these lectures notes are taken in part from the introductory course on general relativity given to the graduate students at sissa and is inspired by the corresponding discussions in a number of textbooks and in particular by those in  @xcite .",
    "a space - like signature @xmath0 will be used , with greek indices taken to run from 0 to 3 and latin indices from 1 to 3 .",
    "covariant derivatives are denoted with a semi - colon and partial derivatives with a comma .",
    "tensors are indicated with bold symbols ( i.e. @xmath1 ) and three - vectors with the standard arrow ( i.e. @xmath2 ) .",
    "finally , i will adopt geometrized units in which @xmath3 .",
    "all of the figures presented here are original and have not been published elsewhere .      the starting point in discussing gravitational waves can",
    "not but come from the einstein field equations , expressing the close equivalence between matter - energy and curvature @xmath4 in the 10 linearly independent equations ( [ efe1 ] ) , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the ricci tensor and scalar , respectively , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the metric and einstein tensors , respectively , while @xmath9 is the stress - energy tensor of the matter in the spacetime considered .    looking at the einstein equations ( [ efe1 ] ) as a set of second - order partial differential equations it is not easy to predict that there exist solutions behaving as waves .",
    "indeed , and as it will become more apparent in this section , the concept of gravitational waves as solutions of einstein equations is valid only under some rather idealized assumptions such as : a vacuum and asymptotically flat spacetime and a linearized regime for the gravitational fields .",
    "if these assumptions are removed , the definition of gravitational waves becomes much more difficult . in these cases , in fact , the full nonlinearity of the einstein equations complicates the treatment considerably and solutions can be found only numerically . it should be noted , however , that in this respect gravitational waves are not peculiar . any wave - like phenomenon , in fact , can be described in terms of exact `` wave equations '' only under very simplified assumptions such as those requiring an uniform `` background '' for the fields propagating as waves .",
    "these considerations suggest that the search for wave - like solutions to einstein equations should be made in a spacetime with very modest curvature and with a metric line element which is that of flat spacetime but for small deviations on nonzero curvature , i.e. @xmath10 ^ 2)\\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath11 and the linearized regime is guaranteed by the fact that @xmath12 ) and ( [ lin ] ) are , at least in our solar system , rather easy to reproduce and , in fact , the deviation away from flat spacetime that could be measured , for instance , on the surface of the sun are @xmath13    before writing the linearized version of the einstein equations ( [ efe1 ] ) it is necessary to derive the linearized expression for the christoffel symbols . in a coordinate basis ( as the one will will assume hereafter ) , the general expression for the affine connection is @xmath14 where the partial derivatives are readily calculated as @xmath15 so that the linearized christoffel symbols become @xmath16 note that the operation of lowering and raising the indices in expression ( [ lin_gammas ] ) is not made through the metric tensors @xmath7 and @xmath17 but , rather , through the spacetime metric tensors @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "this is just the consequence of linearized approximation and , despite this , the spacetime is really curved !    once the linearized christoffel symbols have been computed , it is possible to derive the linearized expression for the ricci tensor which takes the form @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the trace of the metric perturbations .",
    "the resulting ricci scalar is then given by @xmath22    making now use of ( [ lin_rt ] ) and ( [ lin_rs ] ) it is possible to rewrite the einstein equations ( [ efe1 ] ) in a linearized form as @xmath23    although linearized , the einstein equations ( [ efe2 ] ) do not seem yet to suggest a wave - like behaviour .",
    "a good step in the direction of unveiling this behaviour can be made if a more compact notation is introduced and which makes use of _ `` trace - free '' tensors _ defined as @xmath24 where the `` bar - operator '' can be applied to any symmetric tensor so that , for instance , @xmath25 and @xmath26 . using this notation , the linearized einstein equations ( [ efe2 ] ) take the more compact form @xmath27    it is now straightforward to recognize that the first term on the right - hand - side of equation ( [ efe3 ] ) is simply the dalambertian ( or wave ) operator @xmath28 where the last equality is valid for a cartesian @xmath29 coordinate system only . at this stage",
    "the gauge freedom inherent to general relativity can ( and should ) be exploited to recast equations ( [ efe2.1 ] ) in a more convenient form .",
    "a good way of exploiting this gauge freedom is by choosing the metric perturbations @xmath30 so as to eliminate the terms in ( [ efe3 ] ) that spoil the wave - like structure .",
    "most notably , the metric perturbations can be selected so that @xmath31 making use of the gauge ( [ lg ] ) , which is also known as _",
    "`` lorentz '' _ ( or hilbert ) gauge , the linearized field equations take the form @xmath32 despite they are treated in a linearized regime and with a proper choice of variables and gauges , einstein equations ( [ efe4 ] ) do not _ yet _ represent wave - like equations if matter is present ( i.e. if @xmath33 ) . a further and final step needs therefore to be taken and this amounts to consider a spacetime devoid of matter , in which the einstein equations can finally be written as @xmath34 indicating that , in the lorentz gauge , the `` gravitational field '' propagates in spacetime as a wave perturbing flat spacetime .",
    "having recast the einstein field equations in a wave - like form has brought us just half - way towards analysing the properties of these objects .",
    "more will be needed in order to discuss the nature and features of gravitational waves and this is what is presented in the following section .",
    "the simplest solution to the linearized einstein equations ( [ efe5 ] ) is that of a plane wave of the type @xmath35 where @xmath1 is the _",
    "`` amplitude tensor '' _ and @xmath36 is a null four - vector , i.e. @xmath37 . in such a solution ,",
    "the plane wave ( [ sol_efe5 ] ) travels in the spatial direction @xmath38 with frequency @xmath39 .",
    "note that the amplitude tensor @xmath1 in the wave solution ( [ sol_efe5 ] ) has in principle @xmath40 independent components . on the other hand , a number of considerations indicate that there are only two dynamical degrees of freedom in general relativity .",
    "this `` excess '' of independent components can be explained simply .",
    "firstly , @xmath1 and @xmath41 can not be arbitrary if they have to describe a plane wave ; as a result , an orthogonality condition between the two quantities will constrain four of the ten components of @xmath1 ( see condition _ ( a ) _ below ) .",
    "secondly , while a global lorentz gauge has been chosen [ cf . equation ( [ lg ] ) ] , this does _ not _ fix completely the coordinate system of a linearized theory . a residual ambiguity , in fact , is preserved through arbitrary _ \" gauge changes  _ ,",
    "i.e. through infinitesimal coordinate transformations that are not entirely constrained , even if a global gauge has been selected .",
    "to better appreciate this , consider an infinitesimal coordinate transformation in terms of a small but otherwise arbitrary displacement four - vector @xmath42 @xmath43 applying this transformation to the linearized metric ( [ metric ] ) generates a `` new '' metric tensor that at the lowest order is @xmath44 so that the `` new '' and `` old '' perturbations are related by the following expression @xmath45 or , alternatively , by @xmath46    requiring now that the new coordinates satisfy the condition ( [ lg ] ) of the lorentz gauge , forces the displacement vector to be solution of the sourceless wave equation @xmath47 as a result , the plane - wave vector with components @xmath48 generates , through the four arbitrary constants @xmath49 , a gauge transformation that changes arbitrarily four more components of @xmath1 .",
    "effectively , therefore , @xmath50 has only @xmath51 linearly independent components , corresponding to the number of degrees of freedom in general relativity  @xcite .",
    "note that all this is very similar to what happens in classical electrodynamics , where the maxwell equations are invariant under transformations of the vector potentials of the type @xmath52 , so that the corresponding electromagnetic tensor @xmath53 .",
    "similarly , in a linearized theory of general relativity , the gauge transformation ( [ hmn ] ) will preserve the components of the riemann tensor , i.e. @xmath54 .    in practice ,",
    "it is often convenient to constrain the components of the amplitude tensor through the following conditions :    _ ( a ) _ : * orthogonality condition * : _ four _ components of the amplitude tensor can be specified if @xmath1 and @xmath36 are chosen to be orthogonal @xmath55    _ ( b ) _ : * global lorentz frame * : just like in special relativity , a global lorentz frame relative to an observer with four - velocity @xmath56 can be defined . in this case , _ three _ ) fix three and not four components because one further constraint needs to be satisfied , i.e. @xmath57 . ] components of the amplitude tensor can be specified after selecting a four - velocity @xmath58 orthogonal to @xmath1 @xmath59    _ ( c ) _ : * infinitesimal gauge transformation * : _ one _ final independent component in the amplitude tensor can be eliminated after selecting the infinitesimal displacement vector @xmath60 so that    @xmath61    consider now the constraint conditions ( [ oc])([igt ] ) listed above as implemented in a reference frame which is globally at rest , i.e. @xmath62 . in this frame , the components of the wave vector @xmath63 do not appear directly , and the above conditions for the amplitude tensor can be written as    _ ( a ) : _",
    "@xmath64 i.e. the spatial components of @xmath30 are _ divergence - free_.    _ ( b ) : _",
    "@xmath65 i.e. only the spatial components of @xmath30 are _",
    "_ ( c ) : _",
    "@xmath66 i.e. the spatial components of @xmath30 are _ trace - free_. because of this , and only in this gauge , @xmath67    conditions _ ( a ) , ( b ) _ and _ ( c ) _ define the so called _ `` transverse and traceless '' ( tt ) _ gauge and represent the standard gauge for the analysis of gravitational waves .    an obvious question that might emerge at this point is about the generality of the @xmath68 gauge .",
    "a simple answer to this question can be provided by reminding that any linear gravitational wave can , just like any electromagnetic wave , be decomposed in the linear superposition of planar waves . because all of the conditions ( [ ( a)])([(c ) ] ) are linear in @xmath30 , any of the composing planar waves can be chosen to satisfy ( [ ( a)])([(c ) ] ) , which , as a result , are satisfied also by the original gravitational wave . indeed , all of what just stated is contained in a theorem establishing that : once a global lorentz frame has been chosen in which @xmath69 , it is then always possible to find a gauge in which the conditions ( [ ( a)])([(c ) ] ) are satisfied .      as introduced so far , the @xmath68 gauge might appear rather abstract and not particularly interesting .",
    "quite the opposite , the @xmath68 gauge introduces a number of important advantages and simplifications in the study of gravitational waves .",
    "the most important of these is that , in this gauge , the only nonzero components of the riemann tensor are @xmath70 since , however , @xmath71 the use of the @xmath68 gauge indicates that a travelling gravitational wave with periodic time behaviour @xmath72 can be associated to a local oscillation of the spacetime , i.e. @xmath73    to better appreciate the effects of the propagation of a gravitational wave , it is useful to consider the separation between two neighbouring particles @xmath74 and @xmath75 on a geodesic motion and how this separation changes in the presence of an incident gravitational wave ( see figure  [ fig0 ] ) . for this purpose ,",
    "let us introduce a coordinate system @xmath76 in the neighbourhood of particle @xmath74 so that along the worldline of the particle @xmath74 the line element will have the form @xmath77 the arrival of a gravitational wave will perturb the geodesic motion of the two particles and produce a nonzero contribution to the geodesic - deviation equation .",
    "i remind that the changes in the separation four - vector @xmath78 between two geodesic trajectories with tangent four - vector @xmath56 are expressed through the geodesic - deviation equation @xmath79 or , equivalently , as @xmath80    indicating now with @xmath81 the components of the separation three - vector in the positions of the two particles , the geodesic - deviation equation ( [ gde ] ) can be written as @xmath82 a first simplification to these equations comes from the fact that around the particle @xmath74 the affine connections vanish ( i.e. @xmath83 ) and the covariant derivative in ( [ gde1 ] ) can be replaced by an ordinary total derivative . furthermore , because in the @xmath68 gauge the coordinate system @xmath84 moves together with the particle @xmath74 , the proper and the coordinate time coincide at first order in the metric perturbation [ i.e. @xmath85 at @xmath86 . as a result ,",

    "that because these are transverse waves , they will produce a local deformation of the spacetime only in the plane orthogonal to their direction of propagation . as a result ,",
    "if the two particles lay along the direction of propagation ( i.e. if @xmath90 ) , then @xmath91 and no oscillation will be recorded by @xmath74 [ cf . equation ( [ ( b ) ] ) ]    let us now consider a concrete example and in particular a planar gravitational wave propagating in the positive @xmath92-direction . in this case @xmath93\\right\\ } } \\ ,      \\\\ \\nonumber \\\\",

    "] where @xmath94 and @xmath95 represent the two independent modes of polarization .    as in classical electromagnetism ,",
    "in fact , it is possible to decompose a gravitational wave in two _ linearly _ polarized plane waves or in two _ circularly _ polarized ones . in the first case , and for a gravitational wave propagating in the @xmath92-direction , the polarization _ tensors _",
    "@xmath96 ( `` plus '' ) and @xmath97 ( `` cross '' ) are defined as @xmath98 the deformations that are associated with these two modes of linear polarization are shown in figure  [ fig1 ] where the positions of a ring of freely - falling particles are schematically represented at different fractions of an oscillation period .",
    "note that the two linear polarization modes are simply rotated of @xmath99 .    in a similar way ,",
    "it is possible to define two _ tensors _ describing the two states of circular polarization and indicate with @xmath100 the circular polarization that rotates clockwise ( see figure  [ fig2 ] ) @xmath101 and with @xmath102 the circular polarization that rotates counter - clockwise ( see figure  [ fig2 ] ) @xmath103 the deformations that are associated to these two modes of circular polarization are shown in figure  [ fig2 ]      in what follows i briefly discuss the amounts of energy carried by gravitational waves and provide simple expressions to estimate the gravitational radiation luminosity of potential sources . despite the estimates made here come from analogies with electromagnetism and",
    "are based on a newtonian description of gravity , they provide a reasonable approximation to more accurate expressions from which they differ for factors of @xmath104 .",
    "note also that if obtaining such a level of accuracy requires only a small effort , reaching the accuracy necessary for a realistic detection of gravitational waves is far more difficult and often imposes the use of numerical relativity calculations on modern supercomputers .    in classical electrodynamics , the energy emitted per unit time by an oscillating electric dipole @xmath105",
    "is easily estimated to be @xmath106 where @xmath107 with @xmath108 being the electrical charge and the number of `` dots '' counting the order of the total time derivative .",
    "equally simple is to calculate the corresponding luminosity in gravitational waves produced by an oscillating mass - dipole . in the case of a system of @xmath109 point - like particles of mass @xmath110 ( @xmath111 ) , in fact , the total mass - dipole and its first time derivative are @xmath112 and @xmath113 respectively .",
    "however , the requirement that the system conserves its total linear momentum @xmath114 forces to conclude that @xmath115 , i.e. that there is no mass - dipole radiation in general relativity ( this is equivalent to the impossibility of having electromagnetic radiation from an oscillating electric monopole . ) .",
    "next , consider the electromagnetic energy emission produced by an oscillating electric quadrupole . in classical electrodynamics ,",
    "this energy loss is given by @xmath116 where @xmath117\\ , \\ ] ] is the electric quadrupole for a distribution of @xmath109 charges @xmath118 .",
    "in close analogy with expression ( [ eq ] ) , the energy loss per unit time due to an oscillating mass quadrupole is calculated to be @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the trace - less mass quadrupole ( or `` reduced '' mass quadrupole ) , defined as @xmath121   \\nonumber \\\\      & = &       \\int \\rho \\left(x_j x_k - \\frac{1}{3 }       \\delta_{jk } x_i x^i\\right ) dv\\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the brackets @xmath122 indicate a time average [ clearly , the second expression in ( [ itf ] ) refers to a continuous distribution of particles with rest - mass density @xmath123 . ] .    a crude estimate of the third derivative of the mass quadrupole of the system is given by @xmath124 so that @xmath125    although extremely simplified , expressions ( [ rough ] ) and ( [ crude ] ) contain the two most important pieces of information about the generation of gravitational waves .",
    "the first one is that the energy emission in gravitational waves is severely suppressed by the coefficient @xmath126 or , stated differently , that the conversion of any type of energy into gravitational waves is , in general , not efficient .",
    "the second one is about the time variation of the mass quadrupole , which can become considerable only for very _",
    "large masses _ moving at _",
    "relativistic speeds_. clearly , these conditions can not be reached by sources in terrestrial laboratories , but can be easily met by astrophysical compact objects , which therefore become the most promising sources of gravitational radiation .",
    "the research area that is involved with modelling the astrophysical sources of gravitational waves is quite vast and is increasing steadily as gravitational detectors become more and more sensitive , and as detectors of new generation are becoming operative . having a detailed discussion of the multiple aspects of this line of research , which encompasses numerical and perturbative techniques , is beyond the scope of these lectures .",
    "however , the interested reader will find more detailed discussions in the following review articles  @xcite .",
    "this section is dedicated to the analysis of the perturbations that characterise a black hole and more precisely a nonrotating ( or schwarzschild ) black hole .",
    "hereafter i will assume that the reader is familiar with the basic properties of such a black hole as a static solution to einstein equations in a spherically symmetric and vacuum spacetime .",
    "more precisely , i will consider as known the fundamental concepts about physical and coordinate singularities , about the existence of an event horizon as well as birkhoff s theorem on the uniqueness of schwarzschild solution .",
    "all of these concepts are clearly discussed in  @xcite .    before discussing in detail black hole perturbations",
    ", one might wonder why black hole perturbations are interesting at all .",
    "indeed , there are a number of good reasons why it is interesting and important to consider black hole perturbations .",
    "firstly , the presence of perturbations can break the static properties of a black hole spacetime and be therefore at the origin of gravitational wave _",
    "emission_. secondly , the gravitational waves emitted by a black hole carry information about its _ properties _ such as mass , spin and charge .",
    "finally , by investigating the response of black holes to perturbations it is possible to deduce important conclusions on the _ stability _ of these objects ( being a solution of einstein equations , in fact , is just a sufficient condition for stability ) .    because this is such an important area of research , some of the main results date back to the first studies made by regge and wheeler @xcite and the subsequent developments that took place in the 70 s @xcite .",
    "the starting point in the analysis of black hole perturbations is , of course , the unperturbed solution represented by a schwarzschild black hole with line element @xmath127 and where @xmath128 represents the metric tensor of the static background spacetime .",
    "because the latter is assumed to be vacuum , the einstein equations assume a more compact form and can be written as @xmath129 where @xmath130 is the ricci tensor built with the background metric @xmath128 .",
    "if small perturbations @xmath30 are now introduced , the resulting metric will be @xmath131 where , again , the perturbations considered are much smaller than the background , i.e. @xmath132    just as for the static background , the behaviour of the perturbed spacetime will be expressed by the einstein equations that , using the same notation as in ( [ efe_v ] ) , can be written as @xmath133 where @xmath134 . at first order in the perturbations ,",
    "the linearity can be exploited to break up the einstein equations ( [ efe_vp ] ) as @xmath135 where @xmath136 .",
    "using now equations ( [ efe_v ] ) , the field equations reduce to @xmath137 a different way of writing equations ( [ efe_p ] ) is in terms of the christoffel symbols and more precisely as @xmath138 where the perturbed christoffel symbols are defined as @xmath139    before proceeding further i should comment on some of the properties of the metric perturbations @xmath30 .",
    "an important constraint is posed by birkhoff s theorem , which states that the schwarzschild solution is the only spherically symmetric , asymptotically flat solution of einstein equations in vacuum even if the spacetime is not static  @xcite . as a result ,",
    "nonrotating black holes can only be perturbed by nonradial perturbations and this forces to consider perturbations with complete angular dependence , i.e. @xmath140 . handling a generic angular dependence can be complicated , but the mathematical treatment can be simplified if the tensor perturbations @xmath141 are written in a separable form i.e. as the product of four parts each being a function of one coordinate only .    in the case of a _",
    "scalar function _ depending on the spatial coordinates only , it is well - known that this can be done after expanding it in a series of _ spherical harmonic functions _",
    "@xmath142 in a similar way , in the case of a _ vector _ , the separability is achieved through an expansion in a series of _ vector spherical harmonics _",

    "it will not therefore surprise that a series expansion of the type ( [ sh ] ) and ( [ vsh ] ) can be used also for a rank-2 symmetric _ tensor _ which can then be expanded in a series of _ tensor spherical harmonics _ @xmath146_{{\\mu}{\\nu } } +       \\sum_{l , m } b_{lm}(t , r)\\left[b^{\\rm pol}_{lm }      ( \\theta,\\phi)\\right]_{{\\mu}{\\nu } }       \\ , \\ ] ] where attention has been paid to the fact that , in general , a rank-2 symmetric tensor can be expanded in terms of tensor spherical harmonics that behave differently under parity transformation , i.e. @xmath147 and @xmath148 .    more specifically , if @xmath149 is the _ parity operator _",

    "similarly , are referred to as _ even _ or _ polar _ ( or sometimes _ spheroidal _ ) those tensor harmonics for which @xmath153 .",
    "this classification of the tensor spherical harmonics is reflected also on the metric perturbations that , as a result , are classified as `` odd '' and `` even - parity '' respectively .",
    "however , before discussing the specific forms that the perturbations assume in these cases , it is convenient to introduce the so - called `` @xmath154 '' decomposition , in which the spacetime is `` sliced '' into a family of space - like spatial hypersurfaces parametrized by a @xmath155 coordinate . with this decomposition",

    "the initial step in the description of a complex phenomenology always consists of a `` classification '' and stellar oscillation modes are no different in this respect . in the case of nonradial modes of nonrotating stellar models , the classification is particularly simple when the eulerian perturbations of gravitational potential can be neglected ( i.e. @xmath390 ) , so that the perturbed poisson equation ( [ eqa3 ] ) is trivially satisfied .",

    ". the main features of these modes is that they have rather high frequencies of @xmath424 khz and very rapidly decaying times of @xmath425 ms , with the damping rate increasing as the compactness of the star decreases .",
    "modes of higher order have higher frequencies and shorter damping times . *",
    "_ trapped modes _ : they exist only for supercompact stars ( @xmath426 ) .",
    "their existence is due to the fact that for such compact stars , the stellar surface is inside the peak of the gravitational field s potential barrier  @xcite ( cf .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "the trapped modes are finite in number ( i.e. @xmath427 ) and their number increases as the potential well becomes deeper ( i.e. as the star becomes more and more compact ) .",
    "trapped modes differ from curvature modes in that their damping times are considerably longer ( i.e. a few tenths of a second ) , with frequencies that are from a few hundred hz to a few khz . at present it",
    "is not yet clear whether such ultra - compact stars can be built through a realistic equation of state . * _ interface modes _ : they resemble acoustic waves scattered off a hard sphere but do not induce significant fluid motion  @xcite . for typical neutron stars they have frequencies in the range @xmath428 khz and",
    "are extremely rapidly damped , with damping times are of the order of less than a tenth of a millisecond .",
    "more on @xmath423-modes will be discussed in the following section .      as mentioned in the previous sections , the different modes of oscillation",
    "depend on the physical properties of the stellar model and can provide detailed information on them .",
    "nevertheless , the frequencies of the lowest order modes are not very sensitive on the fine details of the stellar structure and can be estimated through simple empirical formulas .",
    "this approach was first suggested by andersson and kokkotas  @xcite and has lead to the different empirical expressions i will discuss below .    since the relation between the square of the @xmath233-mode frequencies and the mean density is linear [ cf .",
    "equation ( [ f_freq_inc ] ) ] , introducing the following normalized quantities : @xmath432 and @xmath433 , allows one to express the @xmath233-mode frequencies through the simple relation    @xmath434    which shows that the typical @xmath233-mode frequency is expected to be around 2.4 khz .",
    "equally important is to deduce a corresponding relation for the damping rate of the @xmath233-mode and this can be roughly estimated as @xmath435 where the power emitted in gravitational waves can be deduced from the quadrupole formula .",
    "doing so leads to a relation of the type @xmath436       \\ \\ { \\rm s}^{-1 } \\ , \\label{rftau}\\ ] ] which indicates that a typical @xmath233-mode oscillation is damped over about 0.6 s.    a similar procedure can be followed for the oscillation frequency of @xmath250-modes , which can be roughly estimated to scale as @xmath437 so that the typical @xmath250-mode frequency is around 7 khz .",
    "unfortunately , the damping of @xmath250-modes is sensitive to changes in the modal distribution inside the star and different eoss lead to rather different @xmath250-mode damping rates . as a result",
    ", no robust empirical expression can be derived in this case .",
    "this is clearly not the case for @xmath423-modes that do not excite a significant fluid motion and are therefore only weakly dependent on the characteristics of the fluid .",
    "rather , it can be shown analytically that the frequency of @xmath423-modes is inversely proportional to the size of the star  @xcite , while the damping time is a function of the compactness  @xcite . as a result",
    ", rather robust relations can be found for the frequency of the first @xmath423-mode @xmath438 \\ \\ { \\rm khz } \\ , \\label{rww}\\ ] ] and for its damping time @xmath439       \\ \\ { \\rm ms}^{-1 } \\ . \\label{rwtau}\\ ] ] expressions ( [ rww ] ) and ( [ rwtau ] ) show that @xmath423-modes have typical frequencies around 12 khz ( but these can vary sensibly with the radius of the star ) and a damping time of @xmath440 ms ( which is comparable to that of an oscillating black hole with the same mass )",
    ".      some of the non - axisymmetric modes of oscillation in rotating stars may not be damped , but have amplitudes that grow exponentially in time .",
    "when this is the case , the oscillations are said to be `` unstable '' and the resulting instability can either be _ dynamical _ , if it develops on the timescale set by the rotation or by the free - fall , or _ secular _ , if it develops on a much longer timescale set , for instance , by dissipative processes .",
    "dynamical instabilities differ considerably from secular ones in that they are purely hydrodynamical , while the latter are triggered by dissipative process such as viscous dissipation , emission of gravitational or electromagnetic radiation , thermal losses , etc .. in both cases , however , the instabilities reflect the attempt of the rotating star to find a lower energy state either by changing its mass distribution ( e.g. through variations of the momentum of inertia ) or by violating the conservation of some quantity ( e.g. circulation or angular momentum ) .",
    "a quantity which is often used to measure how close the rotating star is to the onset of an instability is the so called _ rotational parameter _ @xmath441",
    "@xmath442 the last equality in ( [ beta ] ) has been derived for a newtonian star , with @xmath443 being the stellar angular velocity normalized to the keplerian value , that is , the value of the angular velocity at which matter can be shed at the stellar equator .",
    "indicating with @xmath444 the average rest - mass density , the keplerian angular velocity can be estimated to be @xmath445 .",
    "the parametrization ( [ beta ] ) is independent of the rotation law and is particularly useful for differentially rotating objects . by definition and invoking the virial theorem ,",
    "the parametrization is constrained to be between @xmath446 ( for a spherical object ) and @xmath447 ( for an infinitely extended , thin disc at rest )  @xcite .",
    "a well - known application of the rotational parameter ( [ beta ] ) is offered by classical result for the onset of the dynamical instability in newtonian rotating stars , and which has been estimated to be @xmath448 for a variety of different equations of state and rotation laws .",
    "since the secular non - axisymmetric instabilities are triggered by dissipative mechanisms , their development will be different according to whether they are driven by viscous processes or by the emission of radiation ( either gravitational or electromagnetic ) . when viscous dissipation processes are present and the radiative losses are negligible , an initially axisymmetric , incompressible rotating object , i.e. a _ maclaurin spheroid _ , will be deformed into a _",
    "jacobi ellipsoid _ ,",
    "i.e. into a uniformly rotating , homogeneous configuration with ellipsoidal surfaces ( they are similar to rotating american `` footballs '' )",
    ". this happens at roughly @xmath449 and is referred to as the viscous - driven @xmath233-mode instability ( see  @xcite for a complete discussion ) .    when viscous processes are negligible , on the other hand , the growth of the non - axisym - metric modes can be driven by the emission of gravitational or electromagnetic radiation ( although the latter is usually much smaller than the former ) .",
    "the instability that develops in this way is the so called cfs ( chandrasekhar - friedman - schutz ) instability  @xcite and is produced by the coupling between the loss of energy and angular momentum via radiation and the non - axisymmetric oscillations modified by the stellar rotation ( a qualitative introduction to the cfs instability is presented in appendix a ) .",
    "also in this case , an initially axisymmetric maclaurin spheroid will be deformed into a uniformly rotating , homogeneous configuration with ellipsoidal surfaces , called _",
    "dedekind ellipsoid_. the difference between the jacobi and dedekind ellipsoids is that in the latter the ellipsoidal surfaces are supported by internal circulations but the shape is stationary as observed by an inertial observer ( they are therefore similar to nonrotating american `` footballs '' ) .",
    "this happens again at roughly @xmath449 and is referred to as the @xmath233-mode cfs - instability .    in practice ,",
    "the development of non - axisymmetric instabilities is much more complicated than what discussed in the two limiting cases above , because _ both _ viscous and radiative losses are active at the same time in realistic stars . as a result ,",
    "the modes that are driven unstable by viscosity and deform a maclaurin spheroid into a jacobi ellipsoid ( i.e. the jacobi modes ) tend to be stabilized by the emission of gravitational waves ( the star develops non - axisymmetric `` ripples '' to remove the excessive angular momentum via the emission of gravitational waves ) . at the same time , the modes that are driven unstable by the emission of gravitational waves and deform a maclaurin spheroid into a dedekind ellipsoid ( i.e. the `` dedekind modes '' ) tend to be stabilized by the viscous dissipative processes ( the increased shear stresses , for example , tend to remove , with the aid of the shear viscosity , the non - axisymmetric `` ripples '' responsible for the emission of gravitational waves ) . computing the delicate balance between these two mechanisms in regimes of strong gravitational fields , high - density matter and temperatures is extremely difficult and at the core of the present research on the emission of gravitational waves from instabilities in relativistic stars .",
    "because of the very large amplitudes that the oscillation modes can reach when driven unstable , the amount of gravitational radiation emitted can become considerable and these unstable stars can then become promising sources of gravitational waves , potentially detectable by the gravitational - wave observatories now working or being under construction .",
    "a recent review on this fascinating area of research can be found in  @xcite .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank the organizers of the school and in particular goran senjanovic and francesco vissani for their assistance in organizing these lectures .",
    "i am also indebted with shinichirou yoshida for his valuable help in writing the section on stellar perturbations and with valeria ferrari for the numerous discussions and for carefully reading these notes .",
    "finally , special thanks go to the sissa 2001 - 2002 `` first - year '' graduate students for their help in typing some of my lecture notes of the general relativity course .",
    "financial support for this research has been provided by the miur and by the eu network programme ( research training network contract hprn - ct-2000 - 00137 ) .",
    "the instability was first discovered by chandrasekhar  @xcite , and subsequently considered by friedman and schutz  @xcite , who have shown its generic nature . while a formal proof of the criteria for the instability are rather involved  @xcite , qualitative arguments on the properties of the instability can be given simply using a couple of illustrative examples .",
    "consider , therefore , a rotating star which is undergoing non - axisymmetric oscillations .",
    "for simplicity i will consider the simplest non - axisymmetric perturbation with mode numbers @xmath450 . because the star is rotating , the properties of the perturbations can be considered both in a reference frame which is corotating with it ( i.e. the `` rotating '' frame ) or in a reference frame which is not rotating and is fixed with respect to , say , distant stars ( i.e. the `` inertial '' frame ) .",
    "i will first discuss what would be observed in the rotating frame ; this is summarized in fig .  [ fig7 ] where i have shown schematically the unperturbed star on the left and the non - axisymmetric @xmath450 perturbation on the right . in the corotating frame",
    "the star has a zero angular velocity ( i.e. @xmath451 ) , but is nevertheless deformed into a spheroid by the centrifugal force .",
    "the perturbation on the other hand , has a nonzero frequency @xmath452 and the corresponding @xmath453 wave - pattern is seen to rotate with angular frequency @xmath454 which is , say , negative . by definition , such a mode is referred to as _",
    "`` retrograde '' _ and because the perturbed star is rotating at an angular velocity smaller than the initial one , the mode has a _ negative _ angular momentum @xmath455 in the corotating frame .",
    "the non - axisymmetric perturbation generates a time - variation of the stellar mass multipoles ( and/or of the mass - current multipoles ) and the gravitational waves that are produced in this way , carry positive amounts energy at infinity .",
    "the angular momentum carried at infinity @xmath456 , on the other hand , can either be positive or negative according to the sense in which the perturbation is seen to rotate in the inertial frame .",
    "i therefore need to consider how the perturbation is observed in the inertial frame which , i recall , is the frame in which quantities like the total amount of energy and angular momentum can be measured unambiguously .",
    "the `` view '' from the inertial frame is summarised in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] where , again , i have shown schematically the unperturbed star on the left and the non - axisymmetric perturbation on the right .",
    "an observer in this frame will then see the star rotating at a nonzero , say positive , angular velocity @xmath457 and the non - axisymmetric perturbation with a wave pattern that is also rotating with angular velocity @xmath458 .",
    "it is not difficult to realize that the direction in which the wave - pattern rotates depends on both @xmath420 and @xmath452 through the relation between the frequencies in the two reference frames : @xmath459 [ cf .",
    "expression ( [ in_vs_rot ] ) ] . as a result",
    ", the wave - pattern can either be `` dragged '' forward ( @xmath460 ) , or backward ( @xmath461 ) by the stellar rotation @xmath420 . the obviously interesting case shown in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] , is the one in which the mode is dragged forward ( i.e. @xmath462 ) and the non - axisymmetric mode , which is then said to be _ `` prograde '' _ , is seen to rotate in the same sense as the rotating star ( note that the `` dragging '' of the wave - pattern is a purely kinematical and newtonian effect , fundamentally distinct from the general relativistic `` dragging of reference frames '' . ) .",
    "when this happens , @xmath463 and the conditions for the onset of the cfs instability are met . in this case , in fact , and because the sign of the angular momentum lost is determined by the sense of rotation of the oscillation s wave - pattern , the prograde non - axisymmetric perturbation will carry to infinity _ positive _ amounts of angular momentum , i.e. @xmath464 .    for the observer in the rotating frame , on the other hand , the total angular momentum of the mode @xmath465 becomes increasingly negative because of the losses through @xmath466 that continuously reduce @xmath467 , i.e. @xmath468 . as a result , the initially small non - axisymmetric perturbation with negative angular momentum in the corotating frame , is driven to large amplitude oscillations with a progressively larger negative angular momentum .",
    "such perturbation emits increasingly large amounts of gravitational waves , thus feeding the development of the instability . using a pictorial analogue ,",
    "the development of the cfs is similar to someone s debts that get larger as new expenses ( with positive amounts of money ) are made .",
    "the growth of the instability stops when either nonlinear or dissipative effects become important and transfer energy from the unstable mode into the other available channels ."
