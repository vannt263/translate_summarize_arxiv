    "general modifications were previously studied @xcite ; in this paper we restrict to the following one .",
    "the _ pinball billiard ( pinbilliard ) map _ @xmath14 with parameter @xmath1 is given by @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is obtained as in the elastic billiard , by moving along the direction determined by the outgoing angle @xmath17 , starting at the boundary point @xmath18 , until the next boundary collision . the new outgoing angle @xmath19 ( at the next collision ) is then given , following a standard sign convention , by @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the angle between the incident velocity vector at @xmath22 and the outward normal @xmath23 ; it satisfies @xmath24 .",
    "this is depicted in figure  [ fig : bounce - rule ] , together with an example trajectory in an equilateral triangle .",
    "the phase space of the pinbilliard map is thus contained in @xmath25 . in fact , there is a finite number of curves where the map is not defined , consisting of points @xmath26 located at a vertex of the polygon , or whose trajectories hit a vertex in one iteration , so that an outgoing angle can not be uniquely defined .",
    "the singular locus @xmath27 of @xmath28 consists of all preimages of these curves , for which the dynamics can no longer be continued after some iterate at which the dynamics hits a vertex .",
    "we define the phase space @xmath29 , the set of points which can be iterated arbitrarily many times .",
    "note that @xmath30 has zero lebesgue measure , since it is the union of countably many regular curves .",
    "the main object of interest is the structure of the maximal forward invariant @xmath31 set in @xmath32 , which we refer to as the _ attractor _ of @xmath14 : @xmath33 note that @xmath34 , and is thus not necessarily compact . except in section [ sec : proofmaintheorem ] , we shall generally omit reference to the singularity set @xmath30 , but it is always understood that this set must be excluded when discussing the dynamics .",

    "the main goal of this paper is the explanation of this phenomenology .",
    "the main structural changes observed are the following .",
    "for sufficiently small @xmath1 , in fact @xmath35 , the attractor is a cantor set of lines , which `` thickens '' as @xmath1 increases . for larger values of @xmath1 ,",
    "triangular - shaped gaps begin to appear in the attractor ( b ) , which become larger as @xmath1 increases .",
    "afterwards , around @xmath36 , the complete horizontal lines visible in the central bands of the attractor break up ( c ) , which we refer to as band splitting .",
    "soon thereafter , round @xmath37 , there is band merging to form just three bands ( d ) .",
    "these bands shrink as @xmath1 increases , concentrating around three angle values ( e ) . finally , for @xmath38 and above , the attractor breaks into three distinct transitive regions ( f ) .",
    "the enhanced online multimedia version of this figure shows the evolution of the attractor for all values of @xmath1 .",
    "these phenomena will be analyzed in turn in subsequent sections .      for @xmath10 ,",
    "we are able to characterise the dynamics completely via a symbolic model :    [ maintheorem ] let @xmath39 .",
    "then the attractor @xmath40 of the pinball billiard map in the equilateral triangle is a transitive invariant set and is homeomorphic to @xmath41 \\times c \\setminus { { \\mathrm{sing}}(\\lambda)}$ ] , where @xmath42 is a cantor set in @xmath43 .",
    "moreover , there is an invariant ergodic measure on @xmath40 , which is absolutely continuous with respect to the lebesgue measure on horizontal lines .",
    "section  [ sec : proofmaintheorem ] of this paper is devoted to a rigorous proof of the main theorem .",
    "note that since all of these maps , restricted to the attractor , are conjugate to the same model , they are also conjugate to one another , i.e.  the one - parameter family of pinbilliards is structurally stable for @xmath44 .",
    "for the pinbilliard map that we will study , we consider an equilateral triangle of side length @xmath3 .",
    "the possible phase space coordinates are then @xmath45 , which we split into @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the part of phase space corresponding to the side @xmath48 , with arc length in @xmath49 .",
    "( note that the dynamics is not defined for phase space points whose arc - length parameter sits on a vertex , so these points are automatically excluded from the phase space . )",

    "since the geometry of the equilateral triangle is sufficiently simple , we can compute explicitly the angular coordinate of @xmath14 in terms of two affine maps : @xmath61 where the functions @xmath62 are defined by @xmath63 to see this , note that from a starting point @xmath64 , on the side @xmath65 of the triangle , there are only two possible types of bounce , depending on @xmath66 : a _ right bounce _",

    "this still holds ; thus , any periodic orbit in the equilateral triangle must have period at least @xmath50 .",
    ". then any periodic orbit of @xmath14 is hyperbolic of saddle type .",
    "consider a periodic point @xmath73 with period @xmath78 and orbit @xmath79 for @xmath80 .",

    "( [ mpders ] ) after a rearrangement ; the equality follows from the pinbilliard collision rule @xmath86 , and using the fact that @xmath87 is an even function . finally , we have @xmath88 , so that @xmath89 > 1 $ ] .",
    "thus the line spanned by @xmath83 is the unstable eigenspace of the periodic orbit .",
    "since the product of matrices of this form along the periodic orbit is also upper - triangular , its determinant is equal to the product of its diagonal entries and is also equal to the product of its eigenvalues .",
    "the other eigenvalue is thus @xmath90 .",
    "hence , there is one expanding and one contracting direction , and thus the periodic orbit is hyperbolic of saddle type .",
    "note that this result holds for any periodic orbit of any polygonal pinball billiard , except the period-@xmath77 orbits mentioned above .      for _ elastic _ billiard dynamics in an equilateral triangle ,",
    "there are two distinguished period-@xmath50 orbits , formed by the median triangle and an orientation .",
    "it turns out that we may continue these period-@xmath50 orbits for pinbilliard dynamics for all @xmath0 .",
    "they maintain their rotational symmetry and we have the following lemma :    there are two hyperbolic period-@xmath50 orbits of saddle type for any @xmath91 .",
    "their local unstable manifolds are horizontal lines .",
    "the rotational symmetry of the distinguished period-@xmath50 orbit suggests that the outgoing angle must be a fixed point @xmath92 of the angular dynamics , so that @xmath93 .",
    "it is a straightforward computation that the unique solution is @xmath94 .",
    "in fact , @xmath95 is the counterpart with reversed orientation .",
    "a simple trigonometric calculation using the rotational symmetry of the period-@xmath50 orbit shows that the point @xmath96 with @xmath97 is periodic of period @xmath50 for @xmath28 .",
    "the previous lemma then shows that this period-@xmath50 orbit is always hyperbolic .",

    "there are two possibilities for the structure of the image @xmath104 , depending on the value of @xmath66 : either it is a single horizontal interval or a union of two horizontal intervals , depending on whether the projection in the direction @xmath66 of the side @xmath48 of the triangle does or does not hit a vertex ; see fig .",

    "the interval @xmath100 is now split by the discontinuity curve @xmath56 , and hence its image consists of two horizontal intervals , each of which completely covers its corresponding side @xmath111 .",
    "moreover , each is linearly expanded and maps across the whole horizontal extent of one of the other two sides . for this reason we call the subset @xmath41 \\times ( -{\\textstyle \\frac{\\pi}{6 } } , { \\textstyle \\frac{\\pi}{6 } } ) \\subset m$ ] the  markovian region \" .",
    "note that these geometrical properties in the markovian region in no way depend on @xmath1 .",
    "the key observation is now that when @xmath10 , the image @xmath112 of the whole phase space is in fact contained in the markovian region , and hence , roughly speaking , we can obtain a good partition in terms of future itineraries ",
    "i.e. , whether the bounce is a left or right bounce at each iteration .",
    "this partition is described precisely in section  [ markovianreg ] .",
    "the combinatorics of the horizontal intervals described in the introduction of this section depend on the dynamics of the angular coordinate , which we proceed to study in this section .",
    "the form of the maps @xmath113 in ( [ phi+- ] ) leads us to consider the following geometric series with random signs .",
    "let @xmath114 and consider the following subset of real numbers : @xmath115 we show in section [ sec : proofmaintheorem ] that @xmath116 is a cantor set for @xmath117 .",
    "suppose that we are given an angle @xmath118 , that is @xmath119 for some choice of signs @xmath120",

    "[ fig : phenomenology](a ) . in section [ sec : proofmaintheorem ] we rigorously prove that the attractor is indeed precisely @xmath41 \\times { c(\\lambda)}$ ] without the singularity set .",
    "the geometric series that arise in the angular dynamics allow us to find periodic orbits with period @xmath126 and particular itinerary .",
    "that is , suppose we are given a word @xmath127 of length @xmath128 , given by @xmath129 with @xmath130 for @xmath131 .",
    "each @xmath132 specifies which kind of bounce , left or right , occurs at the @xmath108th iteration .",
    "if @xmath133 is to be a periodic orbit of period @xmath126 with this itinerary , then its angle must satisfy the equation @xmath134 where the second equality gives the explicit formula for the composition .",

    "setting @xmath138 for any @xmath131 and @xmath139 , we conclude that @xmath140 and hence @xmath141 .",
    "when @xmath142 , all iterations of the interval @xmath143\\times \\{\\theta_{w}\\}$ ] are contained in the markovian region .",
    "hence we can partition this interval according to its future itineraries . selecting the partition element",
    "@xmath144 corresponding to the itinerary @xmath127 , we have @xmath145 , so that there is a periodic orbit with periodic itinerary @xmath146 .",
    "this is the basis of the argument for the rigorous proof of the main theorem presented in section [ sec : proofmaintheorem ] . here",
    "we exhibit in fig .",
    "[ fig : period ] two examples of periodic orbits found numerically using this method .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , for @xmath147 the attractor consists of complete horizontal lines , so that for a given angle @xmath118 , ( almost ) all positions in @xmath41 \\times \\{\\theta \\}$ ] are attained in the attractor . for @xmath148 ,",
    "some of these horizontal lines are cut , giving rise to gaps , located close to the table vertices , that no longer form part of the attractor ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : phenomenology](b ) .",
    "these regions are approximately triangular in shape , and change form as @xmath1 varies .",
    "to explain this phenomenon , we say that a angle point @xmath26 is _ non - accessible _ if @xmath149 for some iterate @xmath150 .",
    "for example , @xmath151 is such a non - accessible region for @xmath152 , along with its mirror image with negative angular coordinate .",
    "obviously , such non - accessible regions can not belong to the attractor .    to avoid cumbersome notation",
    ", we will mainly work with intervals of angles and their dynamics under @xmath153 .",
    "we denote by @xmath154 the whole range of available angles , and by @xmath155 the angles corresponding to the markovian region . furthermore , given an interval @xmath156 and a scalar @xmath157 ,",
    "we denote @xmath158 .",
    "recall that @xmath153 are affine maps of @xmath43 that depend on @xmath1 .",
    "simple calculations show that the images @xmath159 and @xmath160 are disjoint intervals , both contained in @xmath161 , and the gap between them is @xmath162 ; that is , we have @xmath163 , together with two points at the boundaries of the intervals .    if @xmath35 , then we have that @xmath164 , and hence we can conclude that the strip @xmath165 is a non - accessible region , since it is not contained in @xmath166 . iterating this procedure",
    "gives rise to the cantor set @xmath167 discussed in the previous section .",
    "when @xmath168 , we now have the opposite case : @xmath169 , so there are points that may enter the middle gap . since we have studied the images of points inside @xmath170 under the action of @xmath171 and @xmath172 , it remains to study the images of @xmath173 .",
    "let @xmath174 ; by symmetry , we have @xmath175 . for @xmath176 , we have @xmath177 , so that the image of @xmath173 covers part of the previously - found gap . when @xmath178 , at @xmath179 , the gap is completely covered by this image .",
    "the images of the interval @xmath173 consist of two symmetric intervals , @xmath180 and @xmath181 .",
    "it is , however , necessary to study in more detail the position coordinate of the image under @xmath14 of the strip @xmath182 , since @xmath173 is no longer in the markovian region , and so the image of horizontal intervals of the form @xmath183 do not completely cover a side .",
    "we thus only need to study the image of the rectangle @xmath184\\times ( \\frac{\\pi}{6 } , \\lambda \\frac{\\pi}{2 } ) \\subset m^+_{0}$ ] , where @xmath185 is in the domain of @xmath171 .",
    "we have already shown that the image @xmath186 \\times l$ ] .    in order to obtain a better notion of the shape of the image , we have to be careful about the images of each of the four sides of the rectangle @xmath187 .",
    "the map @xmath28 is , of course , not defined on vertical sides , but we can take its continuous extension .",
    "the bottom side of @xmath187 , given by @xmath188 , is mapped onto the line @xmath189 , while the top side , @xmath190 , is mapped onto a sub - interval @xmath191 , reversing the orientation .",
    "the point @xmath192 corresponds to the point where a ball hits the triangle s boundary if it starts on the vertex @xmath4 with angle @xmath193 .    for the right side of @xmath187 ,",
    "it is necessary to consider vertical lines @xmath194 for small @xmath195 , since the image is not actually defined for the right side of @xmath187 .",
    "it is clear that the projection on the angular coordinate of the image covers the whole interval @xmath196 , since the angles do not depend on the position @xmath197 on the table .",
    "furthermore , as @xmath198 , both ends of the curve converge to the vertex at @xmath199 .",
    "so the continuous extension of @xmath28 maps the right side of the rectangle onto the vertical interval @xmath200 .    finally , the left side of @xmath187 , given by @xmath201 , is mapped to a curve joining the point @xmath202 and the point @xmath203 .",
    "in fact , this curve is given by @xmath204 for @xmath205 , where @xmath206 note that only the endpoint @xmath207 , and not the curve itself , depends on @xmath1 . to summarise",
    ", we have shown that @xmath208 is contained in @xmath209 in the region bounded below by the curves @xmath210 , and above by the line @xmath193 .",
    "the other way that trajectories can be injected into @xmath209 is if they come from @xmath211 . by symmetry",
    ", the relevant image of @xmath211 is bounded by the curves @xmath212 and @xmath213 .",
    "this is shown in figure [ fig : lineasdecorte ] , and explains the presence of the triangular - shaped gaps in the attractor . as we have seen , when @xmath214 , the angular parts of the images overlap . in fig .",
    "[ fig : lineasdecorte](c ) , we see that the complete images in fact touch .",
    "although this makes possible that the central bands of the attractor join as soon as @xmath214 , in fact we observe numerically that this occurs later , around @xmath37 .",
    "this can be understood by tracing the evolution of the non - accessible regions in time and finding the limits of the region around @xmath215 which is correspondingly excluded from the attractor .",
    "recall from figure [ fig : phenomenology](b ) that a splitting of the central bands of the attractor is observed around @xmath36 .",
    "this is related to the local stable and unstable manifolds of the distinguished period-@xmath50 orbit discussed in section  [ 3per ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : period-3-bifurcation ] shows the period-@xmath50 orbit together with the attractor . from the figure , we see that the period-@xmath50 orbit is embedded in the attractor before the bands split , and in particular that its local unstable manifold is a complete horizontal line contained in the center of the band .",
    "after the band splits , however , the period-@xmath50 orbit becomes isolated from the strange attractor , and there is no longer such a central line .",
    "this phenomenon is due to a homoclinic bifurcation : for @xmath216 , the stable and unstable manifolds of the period-@xmath50 meet , forming a homoclinic point , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : homoclinicpoint](a )",
    ". thus any neighbourhood of the period-@xmath50 orbit contains recurrent points , and hence the period-@xmath50 point is not isolated from the dynamics .    by @xmath217",
    "the stable and unstable manifolds no longer meet , and this recurrence is destroyed , allowing the period-@xmath50 orbit to become isolated .    to obtain these figures , the unstable manifold is obtained by iterating a local horizontal interval around the period-@xmath50 point .",
    "the stable manifold , on the other hand , is approximated using the following escape - time algorithm .",
    "for a given point in phase space to belong to the local stable manifold of the period-@xmath50 orbit , its future iterates must follow the same dynamics as the period-@xmath50 orbit , e.g.  only have right bounces .",
    "we thus iterate each point in a grid on the domain a certain number @xmath150 of times ; if the point has only right bounces up to this time , then the initial condition is marked as forming part of the approximate local stable manifold of order @xmath150 .",
    "of course , this does not give the precise shape of the stable manifold , but rather a region in which it must be contained .",
    "in particular , this guarantees that there is no homoclinic point if the unstable manifold does not cross this region .",
    "this phenomenon also provides evidence of the relation ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  iii.3 ) between expansion in the unstable direction and fractioning due to the set @xmath30 .",
    "the expansion in the unstable direction of the period-@xmath50 orbit is given by @xmath218 ^ 3 $ ] , which decreases as @xmath1 increases .",
    "for @xmath38 , we observe that there are three distinct transitive parts of the attractor , i.e.  such that it is impossible to jump from one to the other ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : nontransitive ] .",
    "the reason for this phenomenon is the following .",
    "after enough iterations , the system arrives close to a vertex , with an angle close to @xmath219 , so that it collides with the opposite side at an almost perpendicular angle , and is reinjected back into the same corner .",
    "this acts as a trapping region which prevents the system from escaping to one of the other parts of the attractor .    in  [ fig : nontransitivebasins ] the basins of attraction of each of the three symmetrical copies of this region are shown , indicating a fractal basin boundary structure .",
    "in this section we give a rigorous proof of the main theorem .",
    "this will be done in two parts , treating separately the topological and the ergodic properties , although both are consequences of the existence of a topological conjugacy of the pinball billiard map in the attractor with a symbolic dynamics model .",
    "let us recall that the attractor of @xmath28 ( or maximal forward invariant set in @xmath32 ) is defined by @xmath220 .",
    "roughly speaking , the symbolic model will be a shift - like map in the space of bi - infinite sequences of @xmath221 , but interchanging signs in a certain part of the sequence at each iteration ; this map is defined in eq .",
    "( [ shiftmodel ] ) .",
    "this map possesses a natural ergodic measure which will be pulled down to an invariant , ergodic measure for the pinball billiard map using the above - mentioned conjugation .",
    "the markovian property that guarantees uniform expansion along certain horizontal intervals is the cornerstone in the construction of the conjugation , discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : markovian - heuristic ] and constructed in section [ markovianreg ] below . in some cases , for instance for @xmath222 , the attractor is contained in the region where this property holds , allowing us to prove the existence of a dense orbit .",

    "the discontinuity curve @xmath56 , defined in ( [ eq : curvasdiscontinuidad ] ) , does not depend on the parameter @xmath1 , and its image is contained in the rectangle @xmath274 .",

    "it is easy to see that the first coordinate of @xmath332 is @xmath333 , for any @xmath334 .",
    "notice that @xmath335 .",
    "now let us assume that @xmath336 is defined and satisfies @xmath337 then @xmath338 for some @xmath339 , and so , in the same way , we can define @xmath340 , where either @xmath341 , or @xmath342 , depending on @xmath343 .",
    "we have that @xmath344 as @xmath270 .",
    "in fact , all @xmath345 involved in the construction are such that @xmath346 , and hence @xmath347 .",

    "this map is continuous by construction and it is injective at all points , except those with a periodic tail ( see the definition of the map @xmath351 ) , which correspond to points that eventually hit some vertex of the table , which are mapped to the same points in @xmath352 .    as a consequence of the construction in the proof of the previous lemma one obtains the following : on any @xmath353 such that @xmath354 , that is @xmath355 , any itinerary in @xmath356 is followed by a unique point in @xmath100 , with exception of those itineraries with periodic tail , which correspond to the same orbit that eventually hits a vertex .",
    "in fact , such exceptions correspond to points in the discontinuity set @xmath30 .",
    "hence , @xmath357 , and this proves that @xmath306 is homeomorphic to @xmath358 .",
    "thus , we can gather together the maps obtained in lemma [ conjutationpartone ] to create the following transformation that depends only on @xmath1 : @xmath359 @xmath360    observe that this map is continuous , and if @xmath361 then the inverse of @xmath362 is defined by @xmath363 , where @xmath364 denotes the integer part of @xmath365 .",
    "hence , @xmath362 is a homeomorphism in @xmath366 and conjugates the pinball billiard map to the following symbolic model : @xmath367 \\mapsto [ ( \\sigma(w ) , ( w_1 , -z_1 , -z_2 , \\ldots ) ) , i + w_1 ] , \\ ] ] where @xmath368 is the standard shift , and the addition operation in the last coordinate is in @xmath369 .",
    "this complete description of the dynamics of the pinball map allows us to prove transitivity in @xmath306 , as we shall see in the next lemma .",
    "the pinbilliard map @xmath370 is transitive .",

    "we shall prove that there is some @xmath373 such that @xmath374 .",
    "first note that there is some interval @xmath375 such that @xmath376 is a non - trivial interval , since @xmath371 is open .",
    "now , the construction in the proof of lemma [ conjutationpartone ] allows us to say that there is some interval @xmath377 and @xmath378 such that @xmath379 . therefore ,",
    "there are @xmath380 such that @xmath381 .",
    "on the other hand , there is some interval @xmath382 , such that @xmath383 for some @xmath384 , since @xmath372 is open .",
    "now we claim that for any @xmath307 there is some @xmath385 and an interval @xmath386 such that @xmath387 , and hence @xmath388 for some @xmath389 , and such that @xmath390 and @xmath391 .",
    "if this claim holds and we take @xmath195 small enough , it implies that @xmath392 , proving transitivity .    to get the claim denote @xmath393 .",
    "fix some @xmath271 such that @xmath394 .",

    "so , in order to obtain the claim it is left to prove that @xmath400 . however , this is not always true .",
    "for instance , let us assume that they differ by 2 . then , to get the claim we may need to change the itinerary @xmath127 , by adjoining two signs @xmath401 and @xmath402 at the beginning : @xmath403 and iterate @xmath404 times to obtain the claim .",
    "in fact , @xmath405    if these numbers differ only by @xmath3 , then the same argument applies by adjoining only one @xmath406 .",
    "this completes the proof of the topological part of theorem [ maintheorem ] .",
    "the space @xmath407 has a natural probability measure @xmath408 , defined on borel sets , which is invariant under the map in ( [ shiftmodel ] ) .",
    "this measure is in fact a bernoulli measure , and is a product @xmath409 , where @xmath410 is the invariant bernoulli measure for the standard shift @xmath368 , weighted in order that @xmath411 , for @xmath276 .    on the other hand",
    ", one can define a measure @xmath412 on borel sets of @xmath43 using the maps @xmath413 , for @xmath114 , in the following way : given any measurable set @xmath414 , let @xmath415    properties of the measure @xmath416 , in particular for which values it is absolutely continuous with respect to lebesgue measure , have been studied since 1920 by khintchine and kolmogoroff @xcite , and several interesting results have been developed by erds , garsia , pollicott and solomyak during the 20th century ; see @xcite , @xcite .",
    "in particular , jensen and wintner in @xcite proved that the measure @xmath416 is either purely singular or absolutely continuous with respect to lebesgue measure in the interval @xmath417 $ ] . if @xmath225 then the measure @xmath416 is purely singular , since it is supported on the cantor set @xmath167 .",
    "so , if @xmath305 , the measure @xmath408 gives us an invariant measure for @xmath14 on @xmath40 : let @xmath126 be a measure on borel sets of @xmath418 given by @xmath419    [ ergodic ] if @xmath305 , then the measure @xmath126 is an invariant ergodic measure for the pinball billiard map @xmath14 . moreover , the conditional measures @xmath420 , for @xmath421 such that @xmath422 , are absolutely continuous with respect to the lebesgue measure on the interval .    by construction ,",
    "the measure @xmath126 is @xmath28-invariant , since it is topologically conjugate to the map in ( [ shiftmodel ] ) , and hence it inherits all its ergodic properties .",
    "on the other hand , conditional measure on horizontal lines are absolutely continuous with respect to the lebesgue measure , since the map @xmath14 restricted to @xmath421 that @xmath422 is uniformly expanding with a factor of @xmath423 .",

    "we have built up a detailed picture of the dynamics of non - elastic pinbilliards in an equilateral triangle as the contraction parameter @xmath1 varies between @xmath4 and @xmath3 .",
    "away from these limits , the pinbilliard has dominated splitting , and we have established , rigorously for @xmath10 , an intricate limiting dynamics consisting of chaotic strange attractors which evolve as @xmath1 varies , and which undergo qualitative changes at certain well - defined parameter values .",
    "preliminary results indicate that non - equilateral triangle tables exhibit similar phenomena , except that the limiting elastic dynamics is then expected to be generically mixing , which seems to be reflected in the attractors found when @xmath1 close to @xmath3 , which fill out more and more of phase space as @xmath227 , instead of the shrinking and non - transitive behaviour we have discussed here .",
