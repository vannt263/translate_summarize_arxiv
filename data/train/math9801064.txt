    "constructing incompressible surfaces in 3-manifolds via degeneration of hyperbolic structures was introduced by culler and shalen in @xcite .",
    "this technique has been very useful . for instance , it was the basis for half of the proof of the cyclic surgery theorem @xcite .",
    "the construction starts with a complex curve of representations of the fundamental group of the manifold into @xmath0 .",
    "the surfaces are constructed from ideal points of this curve . in @xcite ,",
    "cooper , culler , gillet , long , and shalen showed that certain ideal points have roots of unity associated to them which reflect the topology of the associated surfaces .",
    "they asked whether these roots are always @xmath1 , this being the case in all known examples .",
    "i will give examples of hyperbolic manifolds where some of these roots are not @xmath1 , but are fourth or sixth roots .    in section  [ background",
    "] , i review the construction of incompressible surfaces from ideal points , and the associated roots of unity .",
    "i found the examples using a heuristic method described in section  [ motivation ] .",
    "i discuss examples which appear to have ideal points where the root of unity is a fourth or sixth root in section  [ probable_examples ] .",
    "i will rigorously show that two of these probable examples have ideal points whose associated roots of unity are not @xmath1 .",
    "the first is a punctured torus bundle where the root of unity is @xmath3 .",
    "the second example is the complement of a knot in @xmath4 and the root of unity is a sixth root .",
    "these examples are treated in sections  [ n ] and [ m ] , respectively .",
    "the first example , @xmath5 , also has two other interesting properties which are discussed in the remarks at the end of section  [ n ] . in the language of section  [ background ] ,",
    "let @xmath6 be the character variety of @xmath5 and @xmath7 a component of @xmath6 which contains the character of a discrete faithful representation .",
    "the manifold @xmath5 has a strict boundary slope which is not associated to any ideal point of @xmath7 but which is associated to an ideal point of some other component of @xmath6 . also , there is a @xmath8 in @xmath9 such that @xmath10 is constant on @xmath7 .",
    "i would like to thank peter shalen for suggesting this problem to me and for innumerable useful discussions .",
    "i would also like to thank the referee for very useful comments and suggestions .",
    "i should also mention that , in unpublished work , cooper and long found a hyperbolic manifold with an ideal point where the root of unity @xmath3 .",
    "the basic reference is @xcite .",
    "let @xmath11 be a compact 3-manifold .",
    "let @xmath12 denote its @xmath0 character variety . basically , @xmath12 is the set of representations of @xmath13 into @xmath0 modulo conjugacy .",
    "it has a natural structure as an affine algebraic variety over @xmath14 .",
    "let @xmath7 be a curve in @xmath12 .",
    "for instance , if @xmath11 hyperbolic with one cusp , an irreducible component of @xmath12 which contains the character of a discrete faithful representation is such a curve .",
    "let @xmath15 be a birational map with @xmath16 a smooth projective curve .",
    "the points in @xmath17 are called ideal points , and to each ideal point there is an associated action of @xmath13 on a simplicial tree .",
    "this action yields an incompressible surface by choosing a suitable equivariant map from the universal cover of @xmath11 to the tree , @xmath18 , taking the inverse image of the midpoints of the edges @xmath18 , and pushing the resulting surface down to @xmath11 .",
    "now suppose that the boundary of @xmath11 is a torus .",
    "a slope is an isotopy class of simple closed curves in @xmath19 , or equivalently , a pair of primitive elements @xmath20 in @xmath21 . if a surface properly embedded in @xmath11 has non - empty boundary , then its boundary consists of disjoint simple closed curves in @xmath19 . since these curves are parallel , they have the same slope , which is called the boundary slope of the surface . for each @xmath22",
    "there is a natural regular function @xmath10 on @xmath12 whose value at a character of a representation @xmath23 is @xmath24 .",
    "these induce meromorphic functions on @xmath25 .",
    "let @xmath26 be an ideal point .",
    "if the trace function of some peripheral element has a pole at @xmath26 , then there is exactly one slope @xmath20 for which @xmath27 is finite .",
    "any incompressible surface @xmath28 associated to @xmath26 has non - empty boundary with boundary slope @xmath29 .",
    "suppose the number of boundary components of @xmath28 is minimal among all incompressible surfaces associated to @xmath26 .",
    "for such @xmath28 , it was shown in @xcite ( for another proof see @xcite ) that @xmath30 where @xmath31 is a root of unity whose order divides the number of boundary components of any connected component of @xmath28 .",
    "i will call @xmath31 the root of unity associated to @xmath26 .",
    "before explaining the method , let me summarize the connection between the character variety and the thurston deformation variety @xmath18 ( see @xcite and @xcite , or @xcite for details ) .",
    "thurston defined @xmath18 in his proof of the hyperbolic dehn surgery theorem .",
    "fix a triangulation of @xmath32 by ideal tetrahedra .",
    "i mean this topologically , i.e.  @xmath32 decomposed as the union of 3-simplices minus their vertices  these tetrahedra should not yet be thought of as sitting in hyperbolic three space @xmath33 . up to isometry , an ideal tetrahedron in @xmath33 with geodesic sides and a preferred edge is parameterized by a single complex number , the edge parameter , which determines the similarity type of the triangle which is the link of an ideal vertex .",
    "if we choose an edge parameter for each tetrahedron in our triangulation , there are algebraic conditions , the gluing equations , which hold if the hyperbolic structures on the tetrahedra glue up to give a hyperbolic structure on @xmath11 .",
    "the space of edge parameters that satisfy the gluing equations is the variety @xmath18 .",
    "a point @xmath34 in @xmath18 where none of the edge parameters is totally degenerate ( @xmath35 or @xmath36 ) defines a representation of @xmath13 into @xmath37 by means of a simplicial `` developing '' map .",
    "if all the imaginary parts of the edge parameters have the same sign , and the gluing equations still hold in the universal cover of @xmath38 , then @xmath34 defines a hyperbolic structure on @xmath11 . in this case , the representation associated to @xmath34 is just the holonomy representation of this structure .",
    "there is a map from @xmath18 to the @xmath39 ( rather than @xmath40 ) character variety , by sending a point to its associated representation .",
    "so there is almost a map from @xmath18 to @xmath12 .",
    "it is well known that @xmath18 and @xmath12 are very similar .",
    "in fact , at least on a component of @xmath18 containing a complete structure , it is possible to construct a finite - to - finite correspondence ( in the sense of algebraic geometry @xcite ) from @xmath18 to @xmath12 , though i will not use this explicitly .    for a point @xmath34 in @xmath18 , in addition to the associated representation @xmath41",
    "there is a representation @xmath42 coming from the similarity structure of @xmath19 induced by the hyperbolic structure defined by @xmath34 .",
    "fixing @xmath43 we get a rational function @xmath44 on @xmath18 .",
    "if we conjugate @xmath23 so that @xmath45 fixes @xmath36 in @xmath46 , @xmath47 then @xmath48 is @xmath49 and we have : @xmath50    the idea for finding an example is this : suppose we want to do 1/3 orbifold hyperbolic dehn filling along a peripheral curve @xmath51 .",
    "recall from the proof of thurston s hyperbolic dehn surgery theorem that we do this by moving around in @xmath18 until we make @xmath52 .",
    "if we ca nt do 1/3 orbifold hyperbolic dehn filling , this would mean that @xmath44 is never @xmath53 for any point of @xmath18 corresponding to a non - degenerate hyperbolic structure .",
    "let s suppose this is the case .",
    "now @xmath44 is a non - constant rational function on @xmath18 , and so it takes on @xmath53 at some point if we replace @xmath18 by a projective closure .",
    "our assumptions make it likely that this point corresponds to an ideal point .",
    "i used weeks wonderful program snappea  @xcite to search for manifolds where 1/3 filling was not possible .",
    "of the several thousand manifolds tested , only ten had such a slope . in nine of these cases ,",
    "numerical evidence suggested that as the program tried to do 1/3 filling , it was actually getting sucked toward an ideal point where the holonomy was @xmath54 , and therefore the associated root of unity was a sixth root .",
    "there is nothing special about @xmath55  you can do the same thing for any @xmath56 . for @xmath57",
    ", i found probable examples including the meridian slope of the knot complements @xmath58 , and @xmath59 , and a certain punctured torus bundle .",
    "i will rigorously show that two of these examples have ideal points whose associated roots of unity are not @xmath1 .",
    "for the punctured torus bundle in section  [ n ] , it is possible to completely compute @xmath12 by hand , and , while i found this example using the above heuristic method , no use is made of @xmath18 . for the knot complement in @xmath4 i worked directly with @xmath18 and some computer computations are needed .",
    "by searching the callahan - hildebrand - weeks census of non - compact orientable hyperbolic 3-manifolds that can be triangulated with seven or fewer ideal tetrahedra ( @xcite and @xcite ) , as discussed above , i found the following examples which probably have ideal points with non - trivial sixth roots : m137 , s783 , s784 , s938 , s939 , v2946 , v2947 , v3219 , and v3221 .",
    "examples which appear to have ideal points where the root of unity is @xmath3 include : m135 , m147 , and the knot complements @xmath58 , and @xmath59 . in all cases , the boundary slope of a surface associated with the ideal point is a slope that is the shortest in the euclidean structure of the cusp .",
    "this is not surprising given the gromov - thurston @xmath60 theorem @xcite and the fact that one ca nt do @xmath55 or @xmath61 orbifold dehn filling .",
    "an extra difficulty arrises when using the heuristic method to find examples for which the root of unity is @xmath3 , rather than a sixth root .",
    "the problem is that it often happens that when the 1/2 filling is not hyperbolic , there is still no ideal point with root of unity @xmath3 .",
    "for instance , one ca nt do 1/2 filling along the meridian of the complement of a montesinos knot because the 2-fold branched cover of @xmath62 along the knot is seifert fibered .",
    "but if the meridian is to be the boundary slope of an incompressible surface , the knot complement must contain a closed incompressible surface @xcite .",
    "montesinos knots have closed incompressible surfaces if and only if they have more than three rational tangles @xcite .",
    "the first example is the punctured torus bundle over @xmath63 with monodromy @xmath64 which i will call @xmath5 . since @xmath65 is hyperbolic ,",
    "work of thurston shows that n has a complete hyperbolic metric of finite volume ( see @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath12 be the character variety of @xmath5 , and let @xmath7 be an irreducible component of @xmath12 which contains the character of a discrete faithful representation .",
    "it turns out that @xmath7 is birationally isomorphic to @xmath66 , has exactly four ideal points , and the associated roots of unity are all @xmath3 .",
    "incompressible surfaces in punctured torus bundles have been classified ( @xcite and @xcite ) , and @xmath5 contains three besides the fiber .",
    "information about these surfaces is given below ; boundary slopes are with respect a basis where the fiber has slope @xmath36 .",
    "snappea  computes that : @xmath67 a basis of @xmath21 is @xmath68 and @xmath69 where @xmath51 is a meridian of the knot .",
    "i will show there is an ideal point where the slope of an associated surface is @xmath51 and the associated root of unity is a sixth root not @xmath2 .",
    "figure 1(b ) describes an incompressible thrice punctured sphere @xmath70 in @xmath11 . because @xmath71 is generated by two conjugates of @xmath51 whose product is also a conjugate of @xmath51 , any element of @xmath71 has finite trace at the ideal point .",
    "thus , @xmath70 stabilizes a vertex of the associated tree . presumably , the surface associated to this ideal point is some number of parallel copies of @xmath70 , perhaps tubed together along @xmath19 .",
    "the gluing equations of @xmath11 are : @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the edge parameter of the @xmath74 tetrahedron for a suitable choice of edges .",
    "this defines the deformation variety @xmath75 .",
    "the holonomy functions are given by : @xmath76 the point @xmath77 defines a complete hyperbolic structure on @xmath11 . the point @xmath78 , where @xmath79 , is our desired ideal point . using the second and fourth gluing equations",
    ", we see that on @xmath18 @xmath80 hence @xmath81 . from the formula for @xmath82",
    ", we see that the numerator converges to @xmath83 as we head toward @xmath34 , and the denominator goes to zero , so @xmath82 has a pole at @xmath34 .",
    "it remains to show there is a sequence of points @xmath84 of @xmath18 converging to @xmath34 where no coordinate of any @xmath85 is equal to @xmath86 or @xmath36 , since then @xmath84 gives rise to a sequence of representations @xmath87 .",
    "as @xmath88 , every representation of @xmath13 into @xmath37 lifts to @xmath0 ( see the lemma in section 6 of @xcite ) , and so we have a sequence of representations @xmath89 into @xmath40 with @xmath90 . passing to a subsequence , the sequence of characters of the @xmath89 converges in @xmath12 to an ideal point , and @xmath91 where @xmath31 is a sixth root of unity not @xmath1 .",
    "this will show that @xmath11 has an ideal point whose root of unity is a sixth root not @xmath1 .",
    "note that any point of the form @xmath92 is in @xmath18 , and any point of @xmath18 near @xmath34 with a coordinate equal to @xmath86 or @xmath36 is of this form .",
    "producing the sequence @xmath84 is equivalent to showing that some other component of @xmath18 besides the one defined by @xmath93 contains @xmath34 . to do this",
    "we check that the tangent space to @xmath18 at @xmath34 is two - dimensional .",
    "it is necessary to find the radical of the ideal defined by ( [ glueingequations ] ) for this .",
    "i did this with macaulay2 @xcite , and the tangent space is the same as the two - dimensional subspace which you would get if you assumed that ( [ glueingequations ] ) defines a radical ideal .",
    "it s interesting to note that the volume at the ideal point @xmath34 is positive , since exactly one tetrahedron is not collapsed . in most of the examples i looked at , as you approached the ideal point",
    "all of the tetrahedra collapsed completely and the volume went to @xmath94 ."
