    "the quantum hall bilayer at @xmath3 consists of two layers of two - dimensional electron gases that are brought close to one another in the quantum hall regime of strong magnetic fields .",
    "when the distance between the layers is much smaller than the average distance between electrons inside each layer , inter and intra coulomb interactions are about the same .",
    "then the expected @xmath3 state is the state of a single layer filled lowest landau level ( lll ) generalized to two species .",
    "there is obvious degeneracy in dividing electrons into two groups which leads to the phenomenon of spontaneous symmetry breaking @xcite and the existence of a goldstone mode @xcite .",
    "the expected superfluid behavior was verified also by very large zero bias voltage peak in tunneling conductance @xcite , but no clear evidence was found for finite temperature berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) transition @xcite in transport experiments @xcite .",
    "therefore there is a need to systematically address the question of superfluid disordering in the qhb .",
    "in particular there is a need to understand the role of quantum disordering in this system that becomes important as the distance between the layers is increased . in",
    "most of the previous work the starting point for the discussion of the physics of the bilayer was the ground state ( gs ) for very small distance between the layers as a mean field solution to which none or some corrections were developed @xcite .",
    "we will take a non - perturbative approach inspired by the laughlin solution of the @xmath4 problem in which we will uniquely determine possible wave functions ( wfs ) for the gss of the bilayer at an arbitrary distance .",
    "there are two basic paradigms of superfluid disordering that are known : ( 1 ) bkt ( 2d xy model ) for which the transition proceeds via unbinding of dipoles of vortex - antivortex pairs , and ( 2 ) @xmath5 transition type ( 3d xy model ) for which the transition is characterized by a condensation of vortex - antivortex loops @xcite . on the other hand , in this paper , through an analysis of the allowed possibilities for homogeneous wfs as",
    "the distance is varied , we will identify two families of wfs and relate them to the two ways of disordering the qhb superfluid mentioned previously .",
    "the families will be introduced in section ii .",
    "one family , as it will turn out does not include elementary vortices - merons of qhb , in its description of superfluid disordering .",
    "are part of the description of the qhb superfluid for small distances as is well - known and well - established in ref . @xcite . therefore this family of ( homogeneous ) wfs can be relevant only for dirty systems - systems with impurities , which can lock merons due to merons being charged quasiparticles .",
    "then the only vortices that may participate in superfluid disordering and on which description of this family of wfs is based , are neutral composites of two merons of opposite charges - neutral vortices , and as we will find fermionic quasiparticles that carry only layer degree of freedom .",
    "we will show that the superfluid disordering of this family can be understood through a coulomb ( fermionic ) plasma picture of dipoles of these neutral fermions .",
    "therefore this family we can consider as the one that exemplifies the bkt way of superfluid disordering , our first paradigm .",
    "this whole picture will be corroborated by the fact that the wfs of this family do not incorporate quantum fluctuations ( section iv ) and , therefore , do not incorporate quantum disordering that is based on merons .",
    "the family from the viewpoint of a dual description ( i.e. in terms of quasiparticles - neutral fermions ) will be analyzed in section iii .",
    "the other family incorporates weak pairing among neutral fermions and , as we will show , by assuming a special kind of pairing agrees and correlates with the description of quantum fluctuations of the usual superfluid disordering in a translatory invariant system that one finds in other approaches ( field - theoretical ) .",
    "it is expected that this kind of disordering and pairing would lead to a charge density wave ( cdw ) solution @xcite . still our general considerations open possibilities for other kinds of weak pairing that can be present in this quantum hall system .",
    "the most likely candidate is the one with pairing function @xmath6 that results in non - trivial corrections ( from quantum fluctuations and disordering ) to the ground state wave function as the distance is varied . in general",
    "we expect that a weak pairing scenario will correspond to the superfluid disordering of the usual superfluid in @xmath7 dimension and therefore to the class of 3d xy , our second paradigm",
    ". the family with weak pairing ansatz will be analyzed in section iv .",
    "with respect to the experiments , where impurities are necessarily present and we can expect also inhomogeneous ground state solutions , our homogeneous candidates of the first family ( without neutral fermion weak pairing ) are still possible solutions for which transitions may proceed via dissociation of dipoles - pairs of opposite vorticity neutral fermions . in this sense and as will be more clear later , the quantum phase transitions with respect to changing the distance in refs . @xcite",
    "correspond to this dissociation . on the other hand",
    ", an analysis will show that in a translatory invariant system meron excitations via their loop condensation may produce an intercorrelated , paired liquid state for the neutral sector , if a transition to a cdw does not occur .",
    "a great deal is known from the experimental and theoretical point of view of the qhb in the two extremes when the distance between layers , @xmath1 , is ( 1 ) much smaller or ( 2 ) much larger than the magnetic length , @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is - the magnetic field , the characteristic distance between the electrons inside any of the layers .",
    "when @xmath10 , i.e. inter and intra coulomb interactions are about the same , the good starting point and description is so - called ( 111 ) state @xcite , @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are two - dimensional complex coordinates of electrons in upper and lower layer respectively and we omitted the gaussian factors .",
    "this is suggestive of the exciton binding @xcite ; any electron coordinate is also zero of the wf for any other electron coordinate - the correlation hole is just opposite to electron .",
    "this exciton description can be a viewpoint of the phenomenon of superfluidity found in these systems @xcite and is closely connected to the concept of composite bosons ( cbs ) @xcite that can be used as natural quantum hall quasiparticles in this system .",
    "when @xmath14 we have the case of the decoupled layers and the gs is a product of single layer filling factor 1/2 wfs ; each describes a fermi - liquid - like state @xcite , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the slater determinant of free waves of noninteracting particles in zero magnetic field and @xmath17 represents projection to lll .",
    "underlying quasiparticles are composite fermions ( cfs ) , the usual quasiparticles of the single layer quantum hall physics .",
    "to answer the question of intermediate distances we may try to , classically speaking , divide electrons into two groups , one in which electrons correlate as cbs and the other as cfs @xcite .",
    "the ratio between the numbers of cbs and cfs would be determined by the distance between layers .",
    "the wf constructed in this way would need an overall antisymmetrization in the end , but also intercorrelations among the groups as each electron of the system sees the same number of flux quanta through the system ( equal to the number of electrons ) .",
    "this requires that the highest power of any electron coordinate is the same as the number of electrons in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "if we denote by a line the laughlin - jastrow factor @xmath18 between two groups of electrons , @xmath19 and @xmath9 ( @xmath20 ) , the possibilities for the qhb gswfs can be summarized as in fig . 1 .",
    "if we ignore the possibility of pairing between cfs @xcite denoted by wriggly lines in fig.1(c)and fig.1(d ) we have two basic families of the gswfs depicted in fig.1(a ) and fig.1 ( b ) . the requirement that each electron sees the same number of flux quanta through the system equal to the number of electrons ( we are at @xmath3 ) very much reduces the number of possible states - wave functions in the mixed cb - cf approach",
    "we can consider , for example , the possibility @xmath21 depicted in fig .",
    "1 which stands for the following wave - function in the lll , @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 denote the overall antisymmetrizations . in the thermodynamic limit , the relation between the number of particles and flux quanta reads , @xmath25 where we denoted by @xmath26 and @xmath27 separately the number of flux quanta that electrons that correlate as cbs and cfs respectively see , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the number of cbs and cfs inside the layer @xmath30 , respectively ( @xmath31 is the layer index ) . the requirement constrains @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the number of flux quanta through the system .",
    "( this leads to the additional requirement @xmath34 which leaves @xmath35 unconstrained , connected with the bose condensation phenomenon that the wave function should be part of ( @xcite ) .",
    "the only additional way to count the flux quanta that electrons see , with the ( symmetric under @xmath36 reversal ) application of the jastrow - laughlin factors that we need to have , is : @xmath37 which leads to the possibility @xmath38 ( with constraints @xmath39 and @xmath40 the intercorrelations in the first family in fig.1(a ) are in the spirit of @xmath41 correlations , and those in the second family in fig.1(b ) are in the spirit of the decoupled state , @xmath42 , where we correlate exclusively inside each layer .",
    "we can imagine a mixture of both intercorrelations ( of fig .",
    "1(a ) and fig .",
    "1(b ) ) in a single wave function but these mixed states , by their basic response @xcite , fall into one of the universality classes depicted in fig .",
    "1 . in ref . explicitly such a mixture and possibility under name ",
    "generalized vortex metal \" was considered , in the scope of a chern - simons ( cs ) theory , and it was proved that it does not support a goldstone ( gapless ) mode which was found to exist for the state depicted in fig .",
    "these generalized states belong to the universality class of the state depicted in fig .",
    "1(b ) for which in the scope of the same theory we find in the low - energy spectrum only a gapped collective mode @xcite .    the chern - simons theory we mentioned neglects the overall antisymmetrization built in the classes of fig .",
    "1 . we can justify this neglect ( 1 ) by taking a point of view that stems from similar situations with quantum hall states like hierarchy and jain s constructions that in the low - energy sector can be considered as multicomponent systems @xcite ( we will argue later that the state of eq.([wfa ] ) can be mapped to a hierarchy construction ) , or ( 2 ) a posteriori because the results of the effective description of the classes in fig .",
    "1 are quite sensible and are expected for the states we are familiar with from numerics ( the state in our fig .",
    "1(a ) as analyzed in @xcite ) .",
    "( we do not ask this type of theory for detailed answers anyway . ) in this way it was found by us ( refs . and ) examining the basic response in the pseudospin channel in the random phase approximation ( rpa ) of these chern - simons theories that the states in fig.1(a ) and fig.1(c ) represent superfluids , and the states in fig.1(b ) and fig.1(d ) represent disordered superfluids , compressible and incompressible , respectively .",
    "( later , in a more complete study , we will find that the states of fig .",
    "1(d ) are also compressible in the neutral channel . )",
    "the two basic possibilities of connecting two extremes as depicted in fig . 1 , i.e. without and with pairing of cfs , must correspond to the two possible ways or paradigms that we know of disordering a superfluid .",
    "we will substantiate this claim further by examining the two superfluid constructions ( fig .",
    "1(a ) and fig .",
    "1(c ) ) in more detail .",
    "let us write out the unprojected in the lll version of the construction in fig .",
    "1(a)(eq.([wfa ] ) ) in the following way : @xmath43 where , as before , @xmath44 s and @xmath45 s denote coordinates of electrons belonging to the layer with index @xmath30 and @xmath46 and @xmath47 , as before , stand for the antisymmetrizations . using @xmath48 and @xmath49 ,",
    "symmetrizers inside each layer , the same function , @xmath50 , can be written as : @xmath51 where @xmath41 denotes the vandermonde determinant ( slater determinant in the lll ) of all coordinates in which all groups equally participate .    by using the expressions for the densities of electrons in each layer , @xmath52 ,",
    "_ here now @xmath44 s denote all electrons of the layer @xmath30 _ , we can rewrite the wave function in the following way , @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the total number of electrons that correlate as cfs .",
    "the equality is exact ; any time we have in the product of @xmath55 s the same layer electron coordinate more than once , the laughlin - jastrow factors of @xmath56 s in the same layer force the wave function to become zero .",
    "the expression in eq.([sec ] ) reminds us of a dual picture in terms of some quasiparticles with @xmath56 coordinates as in @xcite .",
    "certainly we are not describing the incompressible physics of a laughlin state where quasihole operators of coherent states span the basis of low - energy physics and allow the description in terms of wave functions of quasiholes ( dual picture ) @xcite .",
    "nevertheless we will argue that we can delineate a sector ( find a subspace ) to which constructions ( eq.([sec ] ) where @xmath54 is arbitrary ) belong , which is spanned by a quasiparticle basis of some neutral fermionic quasiparticles .    to find those quasiparticles we will rewrite eq.([sec ] ) as @xmath57 where @xmath58 factor denotes the phase part of the laughlin - jastrow factors in front of the fermi seas in eq.([sec ] ) .",
    "with respect to eq.([sec ] ) we are allowed to take for definiteness that the phase factor always vanishes when any of two @xmath56 s ( or more ) from the same layer coincide .",
    "our first question may be why states as @xmath59 would not make a bosonic basis .",
    "we look for the following overlap : @xmath60 in the expansion of the density sums we may get @xmath61 which would lead to the following contribution after @xmath62-integration : @xmath63 the last term , before the dots , comes after the integration over @xmath62 s that do not participate in the delta functions .",
    "as usual @xcite the term is the result of the screening of plasma which we find in the plasma analogy of @xmath41 state in its charge channel .",
    "the term exactly cancels the preceding one ( it is equal to its inverse ) and the same cancelation will happen for any pair of @xmath56 s ( in the place of @xmath64 ) that in remaining @xmath62-integration have the role of impurities ( of charge one ) in the plasma of remaining @xmath62 s .",
    "this is very good because of our goal to find basis states and leaves us to consider only delta functions in the contribution .",
    "but we can see immediately in eq.([bos ] ) that @xmath65 spoils our goal that the states mimic a fock basis of bosonic particles .",
    "therefore as candidates for basis states we should consider fermionic states : @xmath66 for which we can not get contributions of the type in eq.([bos ] ) because the phase part does not allow two ( or more ) quasiparticles to coincide .",
    "( eq.([sdef ] ) represents a fermionic state for @xmath56 quasiparticles because of the phase part introduced in eq.(9 ) which is antisymmetric under the exchange of @xmath56 s . )",
    "therefore we should consider fermionic states in eq.([sdef ] ) because of the previously found non - desirable terms in the bosonic case ( we are looking for quasiparticles and their basis states that would have features of the fock space basis ) : the terms like the one with @xmath67 in eq.([bos ] ) lead to the absence of orthogonality of these states which we would like to represent coordinate basis states in the bosonic case and that can be mended by taking fermions - then these terms are absent . by a similar analysis which lead to eq.([bos ] ) , considering various possibilities for delta function contributions of density operators we can find that the leading - most singular and coherent behavior of the states defined in eq.([sdef ] ) is @xmath68 the rest of contribution constitute incoherent phase factors with fewer number ( @xmath69 ) of delta functions but of the same kind as in the leading behavior .",
    "we can not prove that the states make exactly a fock space of neutral fermionic quasiparticles , i.e. we do not have an exact equality in eq.([delnf ] ) , but they stand fairly close to that status .",
    "in other words we do not have the exact equality in eq.(15 ) i.e. equality to delta functions only ( appropriately antisymmetrized ) , but we have in addition some finite contributions which can not change the fact that the overlap is singular - at its maximum when @xmath70 s and @xmath56 s coincide .",
    "therefore quasiparticles are not point - like fermionic quasiparticles ( one certainly can not expect that from quasiparticles in a strongly correlated system ) , they are extended , but clearly the overlap has the singular contribution of antisymmetrized delta functions which points out that we are fairly ( to a good extent ) close to the fermionic fock basis description . even in the laughlin case",
    "we can not prove the exact lll delta function overlaps of coherent states of quasiholes .",
    "the quasiparticles are neutral because in the construction of the states there is no net magnetic flux through the system .",
    "see eq.([sdef ] ) and the definition of the phase factor in eq.([thi ] ) with eq.([sec ] ) .",
    "now that we know basis states , just by looking at eq.([thi ] ) we can read out the gswf in the dual picture in terms of neutral fermions , @xmath71 this is a wave function of a 2d coulomb fermionic plasma . in the literature 2d coulomb fermionic plasma with same charge particles",
    "is fairly known and explored @xcite .",
    "it is a dynamical system of fermionic particles in 2d that interact with the long - range ( @xmath72 ) interaction . as shown in ref .",
    "the jastrow factor of the type @xmath73 ) describes .",
    "merons are true elementary vorticity quasiparticles of the translatory invariant qhb system at least for small distances between layers as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite and carry both charge and vorticity .",
    "therefore the neutral fermion basis that we described can be a complete basis for the ground state evolution of the qhb in the non - translatory invariant case in which merons by their charges are bound to impurities .",
    "the wave function in eq.([fou ] ) describes the superfluid state in fig 1(a ) .",
    "it encodes dipole positioning of opposite vorticity ( layer index ) neutral fermions . with increasing distance",
    "there are more dipoles of neutral fermions and they are expected to be less tightly bound as in the description of a bkt disordering of a 2d system with increasing temperature .",
    "therefore we do not find quantum fluctuations in this case .",
    "this will be explicitly shown by calculations in the following section ( see also appendix a ) .    in the superfluid phase , with respect to merons",
    ", a neutral fermion dipole should be in essence a superposition of quadrupolar combinations of merons - two dipoles which come in pairs but at arbitrary distance as illustrated in fig .",
    "2 . in this way , as special configurations of dipoles , neutral fermions , we expect , constitute the lowest lying states of the qhb - ( pseudo)spin or phonon waves @xcite .",
    "if neutral fermions may be considered as eigenstates they must lie very high in spectrum ; like electrons in fractional quantum hall states they constitute the physics of @xmath50 but their wave function eq.([fou ] ) describes a highly correlated state .    the dual expression of eq.([fou ] )",
    "was derived under assumption of the screening properties in the charge channel of the particles participating in the plasma analogy based on @xmath41 state . as the distance",
    "is increased there are less of them and the breakdown of the description in terms of dipoles of neutral fermions at smaller distances becomes a possibility .",
    "we expect that due to impurities there will be patches ( islands ) of dissociated neutral fermions @xcite .",
    "the two paradigms - models of superfluid disordering as applied to our 2 + 1 dimensional system mean that the time evolution is such that ( 1 ) meron -antimeron pairs are locked on impurities or ( 2 ) created and annihilated at some later time and therefore making a loop in time .",
    "the loops in time signify the presence of quantum disordering @xcite .",
    "we will discuss and detect the presence of quantum disordering in the wfs of class @xmath74 in fig . 1 by examining how they relate to and",
    "incorporate ordinary ( not quantum disordering that involves merons - vortices ) quantum fluctuation phonon contribution in this case @xcite .",
    "we will find that the wfs of class @xmath21 in fig .",
    "1 do not have this contribution .",
    "the usual @xcite chern - simons ( cs ) field theory approach @xcite in the random phase approximation ( rpa ) to the bilayer problem at @xmath3 ( which in the neutral channel reduces just to the problem of ordinary superfluid with only phonon description and contribution ) finds the following correction to the @xmath41 state : @xmath75 where @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 i.e. @xmath80 is the interaction in the neutral channel , @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the electron mass and @xmath83 is the uniform total density . in the small @xmath1 limit @xmath84 and we can expand the expression @xmath85 as @xmath86 where @xmath87 is a positive constant .",
    "the terms after the first one represent corrections , in the order of importance , to the @xmath41 ansatz as @xmath1 increases .    on the other hand the wfs of fig .",
    "1(c ) are more general as they suggest the form of the correction terms of wider class than the one used in the expansion ( eq.([dots ] ) ) with only exception that the class demands equal number of @xmath88 s and @xmath89 s because in writing down the classes of fig .",
    "1 we explicitly distinguished @xmath90 s from @xmath91 s and fixed the number of @xmath90 s and @xmath91 s",
    ".    we can start comparing and relating the first phonon correction i.e. @xmath92 to a wave function of two neutral fermions ( @xmath90 from @xmath91 ) i.e. density operators as in eq.([sec ] ) but with a pairing between them as in class fig .",
    "without pairing we would have @xmath93 which is identical to zero ( no correction ) as can be found out in appendix a. this is an important result and shows that there are no quantum fluctuations in the first family of wfs discussed in section iii .",
    "besides this analytical proof , our statement is further corroborated by the fact that the computer - generated two neutral fermion state also does not exist - see ref .",
    ".    therefore we continue by considering @xmath94 where @xmath95 if we take @xmath96 for the pairing function or @xmath97 if @xmath98 for @xmath95 the expression in eq.([1 + 1 ] ) reduces to the form of the first phonon contribution in the long - distance limit with the @xmath99 singularity ( see appendix a ) and for @xmath100 this singularity softens to @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the magnetic length ( see appendix a ) .",
    "we will consider only these most weakly pairing cases ; the case @xmath103 does not produce correction as can be seen in appendix a.    next we consider more than two density operator constructions i.e. more than two neutral fermions constructions as in eq.([sec ] ) but instead of the two decoupled fermi seas we have a pairing between neutral fermions : @xmath104 where in the second expression we used the cauchy determinant identity i.e. @xmath105 and substituted the pairing function that has lead us to the first phonon correction for two paired neutral fermions .",
    "immediately we can see that the diagonal terms in which pairs of the two determinants are the same would make further phonon - like corrections i.e. their superposition with appropriate coefficients would lead to @xmath106 the other non - diagonal terms would lead to more complicated constructions of four and more neutral fermions that should participate in the description of quantum disordering i.e. describe the physics beyond phonon contribution ( [ phon ] ) .",
    "although in some sense we are talking just about a class ( a pool ) of wave functions that should describe quantum disordering we can fix general form , at least for small @xmath1 , of the superposition that should completely model the ground state at fixed @xmath1 @xmath107 in the long distance limit ( [ nfcon ] ) should tend to ( [ phon ] ) .",
    "in other words non - diagonal terms in eq.([long ] ) should be subleading to the leading behavior in ( [ phon ] ) . that this is true from the physical point of view we expect that it is enough to prove the subleading behavior in the case of four neutral fermions @xmath108 and that can be found in appendix b. the proof is based on the smallness of higher order terms that may appear inside the brackets in eq.([phon ] ) .",
    "this is assumed in the rpa approach and expected in the small @xmath1 limit .",
    "therefore the quantum hall physics besides @xmath109 pairing possibility brings or allows the possibility of @xmath98 pairing that introduces non - trivial quantum corrections i.e. brings another kind of quantum disordering .",
    "the @xmath96 accommodates the usual ( on the level of rpa ) superfluid description in which we may expect that the disordered phase will break translation symmetry .",
    "indeed , the bosonic cs field theories that are not based on quantum hall wfs give this scenario of the disordered phase as a charge density wave @xcite .",
    "it seems , therefore , there are two possible scenarios for superfluid disordering not in the bkt class for the bilayer in the translation symmetry invariant case ( without impurities ) . in the following",
    "we will discuss the second possibility with @xmath98 kind of pairing .",
    "we expect , if the translational symmetry of the ground state remains unbroken , that also in the case of pairing @xmath98 the translatory invariant system smoothly evolves with the increase of @xmath1 into the class of wave functions in fig.1 ( d ) .",
    "we would like to know more about this class - whether it represents a distinct phase .",
    "if we take the choice @xmath98 and examine the final form of the state of fig.1(d ) when there are no cbs , we are lead to its following forms , @xmath111 where to get the last line we used the cauchy determinant identity . the neutral part of @xmath112 ( not carrying a net flux through the system as @xmath41 does ) that consists of the two determinants can be viewed as a correlator of vertex operators of a single _ nonchiral _ bosonic field . according to @xcite conformal field theory ( cft ) correlators not only",
    "describe quantum hall system wfs but also can be used to find out about excitation spectrum and connect to its edge and bulk theories . in this way",
    "motivated neutral excitations are vertex operators that correspond to single - valued wf expressions that multiply @xmath112 : @xmath113 @xmath114 where @xmath115 , @xmath116 , and @xmath117 and @xmath118 are holomorphic and antiholomorfic parts of the bosonic field respectively .",
    "@xmath119 must be @xmath120 because of the requirement of single valuedness . for detailed explanations of the bosonic cft analogies",
    "see appendix c.    if the low - lying spectrum were consisting only of @xmath121 and @xmath122 quasiparticle excitations our system would be described by so - called bf chern - simons theory or the theory of 2d superconductor @xcite .",
    "the mutual statistics of quasiparticles - quasiparticles and vortices , in this theory is semionic ( due to the fact that vortices carry half - flux @xmath123 quantum ) and that this is also the case with our excitations can be easily checked via cft correlators - see appendix c. combining the analysis with the charge part ( @xmath41 ) in which only charge 1 excitations are allowed ( half - flux quantum excitations are strongly confined @xcite ) we may come to the conclusion that the degeneracy of the system gss on the torus must be 4 @xcite but the expression for the first kind of excitations ( eq.([firstqp ] ) ) allows a real continuum for the value of @xmath124 exponent including @xmath125 and therefore we expect a compressible ( gapless ) behavior of the system despite the incompressibility of the charge channel and seemingly topological phase behavior in the neutral sector .",
    "nevertheless we expect that in our case bf cs theory is a part of the description of the pairing phase in a lagrangian in which there is a quadratic non - derivative term in one of the two gauge fields ; this allows a branch of gapless excitations - see appendix c for details .    the question may come why we did not do an analysis with the projection to the lll .",
    "certainly the analysis is more involved where  reversed flux part \" i.e. complex conjugated determinant becomes an operator that acts on the rest of wave function .",
    "nevertheless , an analysis of the edge excitation spectrum @xcite suggests that it can not conform to any description of simple , free cft theories i.e. can not belong to a totally incompressible class , and it is very likely that the system is , as it follows from our unprojected analysis , compressible in the neutral channel .",
    "therefore it is very hard to distinguish the physics of the states in fig .",
    "1(d ) and fig .",
    "1(c ) in the translatory invariant system that involve pairing of the type @xmath98 .",
    "while we were finishing the writing a numerical study ( of homogenous wfs in the translatory invariant case ) appeared @xcite that agrees with and complements our conclusions on the nature of pairing .",
    "in conclusion , we presented two families of wave functions that describe two possible ways of homogeneous disordering of the quantum hall superfluid with their detailed description on the basis of the dual ( quasiparticle ) picture of the quantum hall effect .",
    "we also presented detailed analysis of the disordering in the translation invariant system on the basis of insights into the pairing function of quasiparticles - neutral fermions .",
    "a class of candidate wave functions was clearly connected with the formalism that we find in other ( chern - simons ) theories , and the pairing function @xmath126 was extracted as a clear choice that incorporates quantum disordering and that will describe the system if it does not transform into a cdw ( charge density wave ) inhomogeneous solution .",

    "introducing @xmath160 and @xmath161 we can rewrite eq.([nd ] ) as @xmath162 the @xmath163 integration brings the constraint @xmath164 .",

    "there is only one more factor i.e. @xmath169 that can bring the momentum inverse contribution but this only enforces @xmath170 i.e. @xmath171 without a significant coefficient .",
    "this will only give the next order contribution inside the brackets in eq.([phon ] ) which for small @xmath1 , and as usual in the rpa approach , we can neglect .",
    "we will give a more general view of the cft analogies of so - called @xcite doubled cs theories to which bf cs theory belongs .",
    "in the work of freedman et al .",
    "( @xcite ) bf cs theory was classified as the low - energy theory of the deconfined phase of @xmath172 gauge theory .",
    "there also @xmath173 doubled cs theory was considered . for",
    "the detailed description of these theories the reader should consult refs . and . here we will , by writing down relevant cft correlators , demonstrate the analogies between non - chiral - complete cfts and these doubled cs theories",
    ".    first we will consider @xmath173 case .",
    "the possible wave function with coordinates of two species @xmath174 , for which there are equal number of @xmath90 s and @xmath91 s : @xmath175 and @xmath176 , is @xmath177 we use the following correlator of vertex operators of a bosonic field @xmath178 : @xmath179 if @xmath180 we can rewrite our wave function as @xmath181 and define : @xmath182 @xmath183 inserting a neutral pair @xmath184 and @xmath185 of @xmath186 vertex operators or @xmath187 vertex operators we can conclude that these insertions correspond to multiplying the wave function @xmath188 ( eq.([psi ] ) ) by : @xmath189 @xmath190 ( the general formula for the many vertex correlator can be found , for example , in ref . . ) the single - valuedness of the wfs demands @xmath191 .",
    "if we take also @xmath192 then @xmath193 and the mutual statistics between any of two particles of different kinds ( ( 13),(14),(23 ) , or ( 24 ) ) is fermionic . to see that",
    ", for example , for the ( 13 ) pair we send 2 towards 4 and switch @xmath194 and @xmath195 coordinates .    in our case of the quantum hall bilayer , @xmath196 the same analysis as above will fix @xmath95 and @xmath197 so that in this case the mutual statistics is semionic just as it should be in the bf cs field theory .",
    "the bf cs theory of a 2d superconductor is @xcite @xmath198 where @xmath199 and @xmath200 are gauge fields ; the first term is the cs term and @xmath201 and @xmath202 represent quasiparticle and vortex density - currents .",
    "the lagrangian encodes in the @xmath203 coefficient mutual semionic statistics between the two excitations in 2d superconductor - any time quasiparticle encircles vortex it gets the bohm - aharonov phase @xmath204 , because vortex corresponds to the half - flux quantum excitation in the paired system .",
    "higher order in derivatives i.e. maxwell terms @xmath205 and @xmath206 are present in the description of the ordinary ( @xmath207 - wave ) - gapped 2d superconductor and can describe the plasmon modes that are gapped - see ref . .",
    "in our case , because from cft analogies ( eq.([qp1 ] ) and eq.([qp2 ] ) ) we find that @xmath124 can be continuous and correspond to a branch of gapless excitations , we expect a quadratic in one of the gauge fields , without derivatives , term to describe such a behavior . for example , if we add a term quadratic in @xmath208 ( @xmath209 with the @xmath210 maxwell term present ) our classical equations of motion will be : @xmath211 and @xmath212 .",
    "they describe gapless behavior ( goldstone mode ) in one gauge field and associated quasiparticle description , and incompressible behavior in the other .",
