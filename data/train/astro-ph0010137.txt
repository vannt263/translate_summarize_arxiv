    "we build a model in which gravitational clustering is viewed as the combination of two processes .",
    "the first arises from the fact that gravity causes matter to stream towards local minima of the gravitational potential .",
    "this requires a model of how matter which was initially distributed rather smoothly around the centre of collapse becomes redistributed into a more centrally concentrated density profile as the collapse proceeds .",
    "the second process is that these centres around which local collapses are occurring , these clusters , are themselves moving towards each other : clusters cluster .",

    "it also shows that the model provides a reasonable description of how the second moment of the pairwise velocity distribution of the dark matter differs from that of haloes .",

    "we will begin by reviewing the strategy which led to the derivation of how @xmath0 depends on scale .",
    "the relevant starting equation is the pair conservation equation in peebles book ( peebles 1980 ) , but we will start with the equation in the form presented by nityananda & padmanabhan ( 1994 ) : @xmath1 \\label{pairs}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the volume averaged correlation function on proper ( rather than comoving ) scale @xmath3 at the time when the expansion factor is @xmath4 , and the hubble constant is @xmath5 .",
    "this says that if we know the correlation function for all scales @xmath3 and all times @xmath4 , then the assumption that the number of pairs is conserved allows us to compute how @xmath6 depends on scale today .",
    "an approximate solution to this expression can be got as follows ( peebles 1980 ) .",
    "assume that @xmath7 evolves according to linear theory : @xmath8 ^ 2 \\bar\\xi(r , a_0)$ ] , where @xmath9 is the linear theory growth factor at @xmath4 , and @xmath10 is the growth factor at the present time when @xmath11 .",
    "in an einstein de - sitter cosmology , @xmath12 . then the left hand side is @xmath13 , where @xmath14 .",
    "so , in this approximation we get @xmath15 on large scales , @xmath16 , and so this is just the usual linear theory expression with an extra factor of @xmath17 in the denominator . while this approximation is fine on large scales ( @xmath18 mpc@xmath19 )",
    ", it underestimates the exact solution by a factor of 3/2 or so on smaller scales ( juszkiewicz , springel & durrer 1998 ; sheth et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "hamilton et al .",
    "( 1991 ) showed they could compute a good estimate of the evolution of @xmath20 , if the initial correlation function is known ( also see nityananda & padmanabhan 1994 ) .",
    "hamilton et al .",
    "also showed that by inserting their expression for the evolution of @xmath20 into equation  ( [ pairs ] ) above , they were able to describe the shape of @xmath0 well on all scales .",
    "while this approach is very useful for studying the statistics of dark matter particles , it is not obvious that it can be used to estimate the streaming motions of galaxies .",
    "this is because one usually assumes that galaxies form at different times .",
    "this means that the number of galaxies is not conserved , so the number of galaxy pairs is not conserved .",
    "this means , for example , that the correlation function of galaxies refers to different sets of particles at different times .",
    "therefore , there is little reason to expect that inserting the correlation function of galaxies into the pair conservation equation should provide a good estimate of @xmath21 today .",
    "we show below that , provided one makes the correct choice of what one uses for @xmath22 , the pair conservation equation can be used to provide an accurate estimate of the streaming motions of galaxies .",
    "this subsection is concerned with the first moment of the pairwise velocity distribution of haloes identified at the present time .",
    "every halo will be represented by one particle , say , the one at the halo centre of mass today .",
    "imagine tracing these centre - of - mass particles back in time . by definition",
    "the number of these particles is conserved , since all we re doing is following them back to high redshift .",
    "of course , at high redshift , few if any of the haloes would actually have collapsed around these centre - of - mass particles . nevertheless , we will use the motions of these particles to represent the motions of the halo centre of mass .",
    "peebles pair conservation equation , combined with the assumption that the motion of a halo today is the same as that of its associated centre - of - mass particle , says that if we knew @xmath20 for these tracer particles , then we can compute @xmath23 today .",
    "so , to compute @xmath24 , we are stuck with the problem of studying the spatial distribution ( i.e. , the bias factor ) of a special marked set of particles at earlier times .",
    "the case in which the marked particles ( in this case , the halo centres - of - mass ) are observed at a later epoch than when they were marked is familiar : e.g. this is like the mo & white ( 1996 ) simple model for galaxies , in which galaxies formed in haloes at @xmath25 but we only observe them today . here , we are interested in the spatial distribution of the special particles at earlier epochs than when they were marked .    the halo centre - of - mass particles are biased tracers of the dark matter distribution .",
    "the large scale bias factor is the square root of the ratio of the correlation function of these particles to that of the dark matter correlation function on large scales .",
    "it depends on halo mass : @xmath26 and a similar equality holds for @xmath27 . here",
    "@xmath28 denotes the initial correlation function of the dark matter extrapolated using linear theory to the present time . in equation  ( [ xihhb ] )",
    "we use the linearly extrapolated @xmath28 rather than the present day @xmath29 as a practical way of taking into account the volume exclusion effects of haloes at small scales . see section  2 in sheth et al .",

    "the lagrangian bias factor is usually expressed as the ratio of @xmath33 at the initial time to the linearly extrapolated @xmath34 .",

    "so , on average and on large separations , relative to the dark matter , massive haloes @xmath48 stream towards each other whereas less massive haloes @xmath49 stream away from each other .",
    "this makes some physical sense ; clusters cluster , so they are moving towards each other , whereas smaller clumps are in or at the edges of expanding voids , so they are separating from each other .",
    "this linear bias of the streaming velocities at large separation is consistent with the linear theory analysis of fisher et al .",
    "( 1994 ) .",

    "finally , notice that on smaller scales where @xmath50 , this analysis suggests that @xmath43 of less massive haloes should be larger than that of the dark matter , with the opposite trend being true for massive haloes .",
    "of course , the linear theory and linear evolution approximations we used to obtain equation  ( [ v12hlin ] ) are not accurate on small scales .",

    "the halo motions only account for a fraction of @xmath0 .",
    "the remaining contribution to @xmath0 must arise from the streaming motions of pairs in which both particles are in the same halo .",
    "this means that the fact that our model for halo motions is not accurate on small scales will not matter very much for the small scale value of @xmath40 because , on small scales , the fraction of pairs which are in separate haloes , and so are affected by this inaccuracy , is small .",
    "we turn , therefore , to a discussion of the streaming motions of pairs in which both particles are in the same halo .",
    "if haloes are stable , then the streaming motion within a halo exactly cancels the hubble flow : @xmath67 . in this case",
    ", the contribution from pairs which are in the stable haloes equals unity times @xmath68 where @xmath69 denotes the number of pairs at separation @xmath3 which are in the same halo which has mass @xmath70 ; it depends on the density profiles of haloes .",
    "for all halo shapes of interest , this expression approaches unity at very small @xmath3 , because @xmath71 , and @xmath72 on scales which are smaller than a typical halo .",

    "[ gifhaloes ] show that this sum provides a good description of the dark matter streaming motions on all but the smallest scales ( see sheth et al . 2000 for a discussion of the discrepancy at the smallest scales ) .",
    "now , the dashed curves correspond to independently identifying haloes at each epoch . on the other hand",
    ", we could have followed the approach of section  2.2identify or mark the haloes today , and then follow them backward in time . with this latter approach ,",
    "the number density of haloes is fixed to the value today , @xmath83 , but the profile changes from , say a tophat to a more centrally concentrated shape .",
    "equation  ( [ v12twoh ] ) shows that the contribution to the streaming motions from particles in separate haloes is independent of the details of how this happens",
    ". however , recall that this contribution exactly equals the two - halo contribution to @xmath84 worked out by sheth et al .",
    "this means that the one - halo contributions to @xmath43 must also be the same in both approaches .",
    "in particular , this means that however the profile changes from a tophat to an nfw shape , it must change in just such a way that the final answer for the streaming motions of the dark matter particles equals equation  ( [ lamseq ] ) .",
    "indeed , we can use this requirement to constrain how the profile changes from the initial tophat to the final nfw cusp  the appendix shows a worked example of how to do this .",
    "so far , we have shown how the mean streaming motions of the dark matter and the haloes are related .",
    "sheth et al . ( 2000 ) discuss how to do this for the second moment of the pairwise velocity distribution .",
    "they argued that the dark matter particles receive substantial nonlinear kicks to their initial velocities ( essentially , the virial motions within haloes ) , whereas the haloes do not ( sheth & diaferio 2000 ) .",
    "as a result the pairwise dispersion of the dark matter should be significantly larger than that of the haloes on all scales .",

    "( we do not show @xmath86 for the dark matter in the scdm simulations because the simulation box is sufficiently small [ 85mpc@xmath19 ] that cosmic variance affects the measurement significantly . )",
    "the model is reasonably accurate on large scales , and not accurate on small scales .",
    "sheth et al . ( 2000 ) discuss why this happens for the dark matter ( the inaccuracy is due to the simplifing assumptions that haloes have no substructure , the pairwise dispersion from a single halo is isotropic and independent of the pair position , and the number of pairs in the infall regime around haloes is sufficiently small that the use of virial motions to model the dispersion from infalling pairs does not not lead to a large error ) .",
    "for the haloes , this discrepancy appears on scales which are of the order of a typical @xmath88 halo and smaller .",
    "this suggests that the discrepancy almost surely arises from using linear theory to model the spatial distribution and velocities of haloes on scales which are smaller than the smoothing scale used to make the model prediction .",
    "despite the quantitative discrepancies on small scales , the model is in qualitative agreement with the simulation : the pairwise dispersion of the haloes is substantially smaller than that of the dark matter .",
    "the previous section showed that the first moment of the pairwise velocity distribution of haloes is different from that of the dark matter .",
    "it showed that massive haloes separated by large distances are streaming together more rapidly than less massive haloes at the same separation , and that this difference scaled with one rather than two powers of the halo bias factor .",
    "it also showed that the dark matter statistic was obtained by weighting the halo statistic by the number of dark matter particle pairs per halo .",
    "the second moments of the pairwise velocity distributions are also different . in this case , also , the dark matter statistic is got by weighting by the number of particle pairs per halo . however , the pairwise dispersion is also sensitive to the fact that virial motions within haloes can be substantially higher than the motions of the haloes themselves . as a result ,",
    "the pairwise velocity dispersion of dark matter particles is substantially larger than that of haloes , on all scales .",
    "this section studies what these results imply for the pairwise motions of galaxies .",
    "we will model galaxies as random particles in dark matter haloes .",
    "that is , the motion of the galaxies is the same as that of the dark matter particle with which they are associated . in this sense",
    "there is no velocity bias in our model ; the fact that velocity statistics for the dark matter and the galaxies may , nevertheless , be different , arises solely from the fact that dark matter statistics weight each halo proportional to halo mass , whereas galaxy statistics do not . such models for the difference between the statistics of galaxies and dark matter particles have received considerable attention recently .",

    "both panels show that our model provides a good description of the simulation results . in computing our model predictions",
    ", we assumed that the two samples both trace their parent dark matter haloes similarly .",
    "that is , we used the same function @xmath75 for both the red and the blue samples .",
    "if the red galaxies were more centrally concentrated than the blue , we could have incorporated it into our analysis by adjusting @xmath75 .",
    "in fact , fig .  2 of diaferio et al .",
    "( 1999 ) shows that , in the semianalytic model , the red galaxies in massive clusters are concentrated more towards the centres of their parent halos than the blue ones are .",
    "the agreement between the simulation and our model curves in which we made no such adjustment for this suggests that it must amount to only a weak effect .",
    "we turn , therefore , to the first and second moments of the pairwise velocity distribution for these four subsamples .",
    "[ gifgals ] shows results for the same semianalytic galaxy samples shown in fig .",
    "[ xigals ] . as before ,",
    "crosses , squares , triangles and open circles show galaxies classified as being red , quiescent , star - forming , or blue .",
    "filled circles show the corresponding statistics of the dark matter particles . as for the correlation functions , the blue and star - forming samples are quite different from the red and quiescent samples .",
    "our model shows that this arises simply from the fact that these samples have rather different @xmath114 relations  there are only a few blue , star forming galaxies in clusters .",
    "notice that blue galaxies ( circles ) have the smallest streaming motions , and red galaxies ( crosses ) have the largest @xmath43 values .",
    "our model predicts that larger streaming motions at large separations indicate a higher amplitude of clustering on those scales .",
    "comparison with fig .",
    "[ xigals ] shows that the correlation functions of the red galaxies are biased high relative to the dark matter , whereas the blue galaxies are biased low .",
    "this is in qualitative agreement with our model .    the solid lines in fig .  [ gifgals ]",
    "provide a more quantitative comparison between our model predictions for the red and blue galaxies , and the values of the galaxy velocities measured in the gif simulation .",
    "the model predictions are in reasonable agreement with the simulation , although the agreement is certainly not as good as it was for the correlation functions .",
    "sheth et al . ( 2000 ) discuss the reason for the overestimate in @xmath6 on large scales ( e.g. , these models do not satisfy the integral constraint ) .",
    "the bottom panels show the ratio of the galaxy velocities to those of the dark matter ; i.e. , @xmath122 , and similarly for @xmath123 .",
    "this ratio is scale dependent on smaller scales .",
    "our model describes the scale dependence reasonably well .",
    "we presented a simple model of how the streaming motions of haloes and galaxies depends on separation .",
    "we tested the model using the publically available simulations of kauffmann et al .",
    "in the semi - analytic galaxy formation model , the mean streaming motions depend rather strongly on how the galaxy sample was selected .",
    "for example , blue galaxies have smaller streaming motions than red galaxies .",
    "we showed that our model was able to describe the differences between a wide range of simulated galaxy catalogues rather well ( fig .",
    "[ gifgals ] ) .",
    "our model predicts a very close relationship between the streaming motions of the galaxies and their spatial distribution .",
    "optical and iras galaxies cluster differently ( e.g. marzke et al .",
    "1995 ; fisher et al .",
    "therefore , they must be biased differently relative to the dark matter .",
    "if the streaming motions of optical galaxies are the same as the dark matter , then our model predicts that the streaming motions of iras galaxies must be different from that of the dark matter . in other words , whether or not the streaming motions of a given galaxy sample trace the motions of the underlying dark matter depends on how the sample was selected .",
    "thus , in the absence of strong arguments for why a given galaxy sample is expected to be unbiased , one should be cautious when interpretting measurements of the streaming motions of galaxies .",
    "if the correlation function and the streaming motions of two different galaxy samples have been measured , then the model described here ( equations  [ v12gal ] and  [ v12twog ] ) says that the square root of the ratio of the two correlation functions ( at , say , 20 mpc/@xmath124 ) should equal the ratio of the streaming motions on the same scale .",
    "this can be used to test the validity of the model .",
    "again , however , caution is required because this relationship is only true on large scales . for the semi - analytic galaxy samples we presented ,",
    "this simple linear biasing was a good approximation on scales larger than about 10 mpc@xmath19 ( although our model is able to describe the scale dependence of this ratio even on smaller scales ) . in this context",
    ", we think it worth noting that the semi - analytic galaxy samples we presented here can not explain the results of juszkiewicz et al .",
    "( 2000 ) who found that ellipticals and spirals have the same value of @xmath43 on separations of about 10 mpc/@xmath124 , even though they estimate that the spatial distributions have bias factors which differ by a factor of two : @xmath125",
    ". it will be interesting if future data sets confirm this .",
    "in addition to studying how the mean streaming velocity depends on galaxy type , our fig .  [ gifgals ] also shows that the second moment of the pairwise velocity distribution depends strongly on galaxy type .",
    "for example , our model of the pairwise dispersion suggests that the dispersion of blue galaxies should be substantially smaller than that of red ones ( although this difference depends on the colour cut ) , especially on scales of 1 mpc@xmath19 or so .",
    "thus , it is not surprising that @xmath86 for optical galaxies ( marzke et al .",
    "1995 ) is almost a factor of two larger than for iras galaxies ( fisher et al .",
    "the effects of redshift space distortions are larger if the pairwise dispersion is larger .",
    "this means that , on small scales , the amplitude of the redshift space correlation function of red galaxies should be substantially smaller than the real space correlation function , but the difference between real and redshift space correlation functions of blue galaxies should not be as dramatic .",
    "this is a generic prediction of these sorts of galaxy formation models .",
    "this suggests that galaxy redshift samples cut by colour should provide a useful and direct test of these models .",
    "dividing a galaxy sample by colour allows another simple test of these models . at large separations , where most pairs are in separate haloes , the model described above predicts that the cross - correlation function of the two colour samples should simply be the geometric mean of the two individual samples .",
    "if the two galaxy samples both trace their parent dark matter haloes in the same way ( our fig .",
    "[ xigals ] shows that this assumption describes the semianalytic model well ) , then this will be approximately true even on smaller scales .",
    "( it will not be exactly true because the scatter in the @xmath114 relations are , typically , sub - poisson . )",
    "data sets currently available should be able to test this prediction .",

    "we would like to study what happens if we make the profile of the region containing @xmath70 depend on time in the following way : we would like to use the same family of profiles , such as the nfw set , to describe the density run at any time , and we want to parametrize the evolution of the profile shape by changing the values of the profile s parameters . there is no physical reason why the nfw form should describe the density run around a region which has yet to virialize ; we are only using this to illustrate how our argument works .",

    "in addition , we will allow the concentration parameter to depend on mass as well as time : @xmath139 .",
