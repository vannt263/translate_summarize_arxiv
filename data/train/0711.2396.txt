    "contrarely to the other group-14 clathrates ( si , ge and sn ) , the synthesis of the carbon clathrates remains a challenge up to now even if the deposition of c@xmath2 or c@xmath3 networks , which basic units have a comparable size to the ones of the carbon clathrates , have been prepared  @xcite .",

    "they would represent a low - density fourfold diamond - like @xmath6 configuration .",
    "intercalation with the li and be small atoms inside each cage of the type - i carbon clathrate has been suggested  @xcite . _",
    "ab initio _ calculations indicate that upon efficient doping , carbon clathrates would turn metallic  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , large values of the electron - phonon interaction potential let envisage carbon clathrates as possible candidates for high - temperature superconductivity  @xcite .",
    "recently , zipoli _ et al _ have calculated a large value of the electron - phonon coupling for the clathrate fc@xmath7 leading to a superconducting temperature close to 77  k  @xcite .",

    "the silicon type - i clathrate ba@xmath1si@xmath0 can be synthesised from a precursor consisting of a stoichiometric mixture of basi@xmath8 and si at 3 gpa and 800@xmath9c  @xcite .",
    "an attempt was made by yamanaka _",
    "et al _ to prepare a carbon clathrate using high pressure ( hp ) and high temperature ( ht ) conditions from the polymerization of c@xmath10 but no evidence of a clathrate - like phase analogous to si - clathrates were found  @xcite .",
    "another possible hpht route has been envisaged using a li - graphite intercalation compound , where the li atoms could frustrate the graphite - diamond conversion and promote the formation of the endohedrally doped nano - cages  @xcite .",
    "this idea is supported by the observation of the half conversion of the @xmath11 bonds into @xmath6 bonds at 17  gpa when graphite is pressurized  @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we investigate the high - pressure properties of the c@xmath0 and li@xmath1c@xmath0 carbon clathrates within the framework of the density functional theory as a way to obtain new informations concerning their synthesis .",

    "the electronic band structure properties of c@xmath0 and li@xmath1c@xmath0 under pressure are also examined .",
    "we have calculated the active raman modes of li@xmath1c@xmath0 and studied their pressure dependence which could contribute to the identification of carbon clathrate crystals if synthesized for instance in a diamond anvil cell .",
    "our _ ab initio _ calculations were performed with the vasp code  @xcite , using the projector augmented waves ( paw )  @xcite pseudopotentials supplied with the package  @xcite , within the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) for the exchange - correlation energy  @xcite .",
    "this choice is justified as in the case of @xmath6 carbon based materials , gga gives a better evaluation of the c - c distance  @xcite .",
    "a plane - wave energy cutoff of 650 ev together with a ( 4@xmath124@xmath124 ) monkhorst - pack grid corresponding to 10 k - points in the irreducible part of the brillouin zone were used for the c@xmath0 and li@xmath1c@xmath0 compounds .",
    "our k - mesh was enough to reach the convergence due to the large clathrate cells .",
    "thus , convergence of 2 mev / atoms in the difference of total energies and 0.2  gpa in pressure was reached .",
    "the cell and internal parameters were fully relaxed in order to obtain forces over the atoms lower than 0.005  ev /  .",
    "the resulting energies as a function of the volume were fitted using a murnaghan equation of state ( eos )  @xcite to obtain the equilibrium volume , the bulk modulus and its pressure derivative at zero pressure . the pressure calculated values are in excellent agreement with the ones provided from the fit .",

    "the intercalation of li atoms at the center of the c@xmath2 and c@xmath4 cages leads to an expansion of the lattice parameter ( a=6.833  ) as well as a higher compressibility ( @xmath13=356 gpa ) .",
    "atomic volume has been slightly expanded by 14.5 % and 3.5 % for the c@xmath0 and the li@xmath1c@xmath0 phases respectively with respect to diamond .",
    "we find an energy difference of 92 mev / atom for c@xmath0 relative to diamond in good agreement with nesper _ et al _ ( 90 mev / atom )  @xcite who used also the paw method .",

    "it is remarkable that these binding energies , relative to diamond , are considerably lower than that of the fullerene c@xmath10 ( 430  mev / atom )  @xcite .",
