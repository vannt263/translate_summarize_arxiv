    "the quasar 3c279 ( @xmath7 ) is one of the archetypal superluminal radio sources ( cotton et al . 1979 ) .",
    "at @xmath6-ray energies , the light curve of 3c279 has been sampled intermittently since the launch of the compton observatory in 1991 ; it is one of the brightest egret quasars ( hartman et al .",
    "3c279 is also well known as an optically violent variable ( ovv ) , with large and rapid outbursts ( webb et al .",
    ". strong variability on timescales shorter than one day is observed in high - energy bands ( wehrle et al .",
    "1998 ; lawson , mchardy , & marscher 1999 ) .",
    "correlations between the variability seen over the entire electromagnetic spectrum have proved elusive .",
    "variability occurs on a variety of timescales , especially at high energies , and time sampling has been adequate to track the variations only at radio , millimeter , and x - ray bands , and as far as practicable in optical bands .",
    "there are strong theoretical motivations for the search for correlations .",
    "the two - humped overall spectral energy distribution is most naturally explained as a combination of synchrotron radiation for the radio through optical - uv region , and inverse compton emission at higher energies ( maraschi et al .",
    "1994 ; wehrle 1999 ) .",
    "the synchrotron and inverse compton emission is generally thought to be associated with a jet of relativistic electrons ; however , the source of the seed photons for inverse compton scattering is a matter of considerable debate ( e.g. maraschi , ghisellini , & celotti 1992 ; sikora , begelman , & rees 1994 ) . distinguishing the differing mechanisms",
    "involves a full understanding of the time correlations in the different energy bands .",
    "a consensus is emerging that for gev - peaked blazars , the seed photons upscattered to x - ray and @xmath6-ray energies originate outside the jet ( e.g. , in the accretion disk or broad line region clouds ) with a minor contribution from synchrotron photons ( urry 1999 ) .",
    "a full understanding may have to await the next generation of @xmath6-ray satellite observatories .    in the radio regime ,",
    "the variability timescale is longer , and flux monitoring at 4.8 , 8.4 and 14.5 ghz , complete with polarization data , has been obtained at the university of michigan radio observatory ( e.g. aller et al .",
    "monitoring at 22 and 37 ghz has been done at metshovi observatory ( tersranta et al . 1992 ; tersranta et al .",
    "less frequent monitoring has been performed at sest ( 90 and 230 ghz ) ( tornikoski et al . 1996 ) and at the jcmt ( 230 ghz ) ( marscher et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "the time variability of 3c279 s vlbi structure has been studied by several groups , beginning with the earliest days of the vlbi technique itself ( knight et al . 1971 ; whitney et al . 1971 ; cohen et al .",
    "most of these observations were made using the ad - hoc us and european vlbi networks , with observations at intervals of about 1 year ( unwin et al .",

    "1998 ) . in many cases",
    ", we have re - analyzed the original data , and obtained significantly improved images .",
    "the biggest improvement was in correcting station - based calibration errors ( and deletion of bad data in some cases ) ; the interactive self - calibration , display , and imaging package difmap ( shepherd , pearson , & taylor 1994 ) was the key to realizing these improvements . for some of the epochs listed in table  [ vlbiobs ] , observations at lower frequencies",
    "were made as well , but since these observations contribute little to following source structure changes ( because of their lower resolution ) , discussion of these observations will be deferred until the discussion of the broad - band spectrum in piner et al .",
    "( 2000b ) . beginning in 1995 many of our observations recorded dual circular polarization . in this paper",
    ", we discuss only the total intensity images formed from these observations .",
    "the data were fringe - fitted in aips , then exported to the caltech difmap package ( shepherd et al .",
    "1994 ) for amplitude and phase calibration , editing , and mapping .",
    "the 22 ghz data required particular attention to amplitude calibration because water vapor in the earth s atmosphere absorbs at this frequency .",
    "normal self - calibration does not take care of this problem if it is cloudy at most antennas because there are insufficient crossing points in the @xmath10 plane for sources that are nearly equatorial ( like 3c279 ) ; moreover , the problem is worse for antennas that are located far from the mainland array such as saint croix ( which is nearly at sea level ) or mauna kea ( which observes at low elevation angles ) . we compared the 22 ghz monitoring data from metshovi ( where only the data obtained with dry observing conditions are accepted ) with the flux density measured on the shortest vlbi baselines , and applied an initial scaling factor of order 1.1 - 1.3 to antenna gains for stations affected by cloudy weather .",
    "we estimate that 3c279 has about 1 jy in 22 ghz emission which is too diffuse to be sampled by the shortest spacings in the ( @xmath9 ) plane . in most cases , we chose an epoch with good weather to map and model fit , then used the input model to initiate the mapping - self - calibration sequence for adjacent epochs with bad weather .",
    "data from antennas obtained during snow or rain were flagged after we found that they had significant adverse effects on the images .",
    "the amplitude calibration of the 43 ghz data was compared with the 37 ghz monitoring flux densities from metshovi . in nearly all cases",
    ", the fluxes agreed to within 20% ; discrepant antennas were scaled accordingly .",
    "self - calibration enables us to make reliable images for the purpose of tracking changes in the source structure ; however , the scale factors applied render the overall flux scale somewhat uncertain .",
    "this limits our ability to track the flux density evolution of individual components at better than about a 10% level .",
    "figure  1 shows the eighteen 22 ghz images of 3c279 from the epochs listed in table  [ vlbiobs ] , and figure  2 shows the ten 43 ghz images .",
    "the images are shown with uniform weighting ( uvweight=2,0 in difmap ) to maximize the resolution .",

    "; reid & moran 1988 ; condon 1997 ) , the range in component surface brightnesses in 3c279 is so large ( of order 1000 between c8 and c5 ) that this produces an extremely large range in errors that does not empirically agree with the scatter in the model - fit positions .",
    "effects other than visibility errors ( e.g. , @xmath10 coverage effects , calibration errors , and interactions among multiple model components ) presumably dominate at the higher surface brightnesses and simulate a dependence with lower slope , and we find that the square root of the dynamic range empirically provides a good estimate for the errors .",

    "stationary components could be due to two causes : a standing shock in the jet , or a point along a curving jet where the jet crosses the line - of - sight .",
    "in the second case the stationary component should appear quite bright , since the jet material would have maximal doppler boosting when passing this point .",
    "since c5 is at times quite faint , and since there appears to be a physical change in the jet at about that point ( with most superluminal components fading and disappearing at about the location of c5  possibly becoming disrupted ) , we favor the explanation of c5 as a standing shock in the jet .",
    "gmez et al .",
    "( 1995 ) find that standing oblique shocks are created in their numerical simulations of relativistic jets by quasi - periodic recollimation shocks .",
    "a standing shock may also be created through a sudden variation in the external pressure that results in an isolated recollimation shock , and it will be an interesting future study to see if isolated stationary components correspond to a physical point in the source where the pressure would be expected to change abruptly .    the bright flux of c5 around 1991 and its subsequent decay may be due to the lingering effects of its previous encounter with c4 , which passed the location of c5 in the late 1980s .",

    "figure  7 shows that the average position angles of jet components have changed during our monitoring .",
    "the position angles of the new components c8 and c9 are similar to that of the larger - scale vlbi structure .",

    "abraham & carrara ( 1998 ) attempted to explain the different apparent speeds and position angles of the older vlbi components by postulating a precessing nozzle that ejects components at varying position angles and viewing angles .",

    "our measured apparent speeds agree reasonably well with an extrapolation of their figure  2 ( they predict a slowing of apparent speeds for ejections between 1989 and 1996 ) , but the change in component position angles from figure  7 does not agree with their figure  1 , and even has an opposite slope . since the different apparent speeds and position angles are suggestive of a precessing nozzle , it may be possible for a different precession model to fit the current data ; however , if component ejections really vary regularly between @xmath16 and @xmath35 on @xmath510 year timescales as indicated by figure  7 , it is difficult to understand why the larger - scale vlbi and vla emission should be constrained to the narrow range of position angles observed .",

    "we are fortunate that this component has been unusually bright and long - lived , and has been visible over the entire six years of monitoring at 22 ghz .",
    "component c4 has followed a curved path over the years 1991 to 1997 ( an indication of this can be seen in figure  5@xmath19 , where the apparent speed appears to slow around 1994 ) .",

    "we use the positions measured in the 22 ghz monitoring , since this has a time baseline three times longer than the 43 ghz monitoring .",

    "a straight line is a very bad fit to the measured @xmath36 values ( reduced chi - squared = 2.8 ) , and a fourth - order polynomial is the lowest order that achieves a good fit ( reduced chi - squared = 0.71 ) .",
    "zensus et al . (",
    "1995 ) also needed fourth - order polynomials to fit the motion of components in 3c345 .",

    "figure  8@xmath50 confirms that @xmath51 shows little variation in the case of the small - angle solution .",
    "the small - angle solution constrains c4 to viewing angles of @xmath52 to @xmath53 .",
    "small viewing angles such as these are typical of those expected for an egret blazar ( see the monte carlo simulations of lister [ 1998 ] ) , and angles in this range have been successfully used to model the multiwavelength spectrum of 3c279 by , e.g. , maraschi , ghisellini , & celotti ( 1992 ) ( @xmath53 ) , ghisellini & madau ( 1996 ) ( @xmath54 ) , and hartman & boettcher ( 1999 ) ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "once @xmath47 is known the trajectory of the component in the @xmath56 and @xmath57 planes ( where the @xmath58-axis is perpendicular to the plane of the sky ) can be calculated .",
    "these trajectories are shown in figure  8@xmath59 ( note the expanded scale along the @xmath58-axis ) , together with figure  8@xmath20 , they describe the complete 3-dimensional motion of the component .",
    "component c4 appears to describe approximately one oscillation of a low - pitch angle helical motion , notable especially in the @xmath56 plane trajectory .",
    "helical motion of components may be caused by hydrodynamic instabilities ( hardee 1987 ) or magneto - hydrodynamic effects ( camenzind 1986 ; camenzind & krockenberger 1992 ) , and has previously been observed in several sources , notably 3c345 ( steffen et al .",
    "1995 ) and bl lac ( tateyama et al . 1998 ; denn & mutel 1999 ) .",
    "the bending of the trajectory of c4 is much smaller ( about 4@xmath60 total change in position angle ) than the position angle differences between components shown in figure  7 .",
    "this indicates that a complete description of component motions in 3c279 may require a superposition of small - scale wiggles  possibly due to hydrodynamic instabilities  such as those observed in the motion of c4 , and a larger - scale motion of the jet nozzle that causes the differences in apparent speed and position angle from component to component .",
    "this would make a complete description of motions in 3c279 quite complex , and is reminiscent of the complexity observed in 3c345 , where different components follow different curved paths ( zensus et al .",
    "detailed motions of components in 3c279 other than c4 are difficult to observe , since other components tend to fade and disappear within about 1 mas of the core . to further constrain the dynamics of the 3c279 jet",
    "it will be necessary to continue monitoring the position of component c4 as it evolves , the bright component c8 to see if it continues past the 1 mas point ( which it will reach in about 2002 ) , and the position angles of new ejections .",

    "in this section we discuss the relation between the evolution in brightness of individual vlbi components and that of the total source flux .",
    "the motivation for this approach is to take advantage of the very long history of flux monitoring of 3c279 .",
    "regular monitoring at centimeter wavelengths was begun by the michigan group in 1965 ( aller et al .",
    "1985 ) , and the source is now monitored at intervals of a few days to frequencies as high as 87 ghz .    it is clear from the michigan radio light curves at 4.8 , 8.0 and 14.5 ghz that the character of the flux curves changed in 1990 . prior to 1990",
    ", individual flux outbursts were well separated , by intervals of up to 5 years . the 1981 - 1985 burst",
    "was well fitted by a shock model in which the low - frequency evolution lagged the higher frequencies ( hughes et al .",
    "until 1990 , the spectrum between 8 and 14.5 ghz remained essentially flat ( @xmath62 ) , but since then , the spectrum has been strongly inverted .",
    "even more striking , the characteristic timescale for flux outbursts has decreased to less than a year , with detectable changes on scales of a week or less .",
    "this increase in complexity of the total flux light curves does not correspond to any increase in the complexity of the vlbi images .",
    "the simplest explanation is that the bulk of the flux variation occurs in the almost - unresolved core .",
    "figure 10@xmath19 shows the flux density evolution of the core and jet components from model fitting at 22 ghz .",
    "also shown are the 22 ghz total flux density monitoring data from metshovi .",
    "figure 10@xmath20 shows the same data over a smaller range in flux so that the variability of the jet components can be seen .",
    "similarly , figure 10@xmath0 shows the 43 ghz core and jet component fluxes and 37 ghz metshovi data , and figure 10@xmath48 shows the same data over a smaller range in flux .",
    "we estimate the amplitude calibration of these vlbi fluxes to be accurate at about the 10% level .",
    "10._continued _    the vlbi data are clearly undersampled , even though 3c279 is one of the best - observed agns with vlbi .",
    "however , the obvious correlation between the vlbi core and total flux light curves shows that flux variations in the core are largely responsible for the total flux variability .",
    "the logarithmic contours on the image series ( figures 1 to 4 ) tend to suppress these changes , with the result that the image evolution appears to be largely uncorrelated .",
    "a consequence of this is that relating flux variations in the more distant components to the total flux will be very difficult , because they are masked by the much stronger core variations .",
    "this behavior of 3c279 ( where the total flux variability is dominated by the vlbi core and the jet components are much weaker than the core ) is quite different from its behavior in the early 1980s , when the total flux density variations were dominated by component c3 ( u89 ) , and from that of 3c345 , where the total flux variability has been linked to new jet components which have all surpassed the core in brightness ( valtaoja et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "the flux history of the vlbi components generally shows a fading with time , with component lifetimes of roughly 3 years .",
    "exceptions to this are components c4 , which has maintained an approximately constant flux over the six year monitoring period and shows no signs of fading , and c5 , which at first faded but then maintained an approximately constant flux .",
    "components c6 and",
    "c7a both fade at first but then show secondary increases in flux ; such an increase could be due to a changing doppler factor along a slightly curving path .",
    "3c279 ejected an exceptionally bright component ( c8 ) in late 1995 .",
    "this component was first detected with a flux density of 5 jy , it then rose in flux until it reached 9 jy ( making it the single exception to our previous statement that the jet components in 3c279 were generally much weaker than the core ) , it later faded to a flux density of 4 jy at the end of our monitoring in 1997 .",
    "the 22 and 43 ghz images and model fits can be used to calculate two - point spectral indices .",
    "considering first the model - fit gaussian fluxes , we calculate mean values for the spectral index of the core and c4 to be @xmath63 and @xmath64 respectively , for @xmath65 .",
    "variations in spectral index from epoch to epoch are difficult to distinguish from flux errors due to calibration or model fitting , making it difficult to draw conclusions about spectral index variations with time from these observations .",
    "similarly , it is difficult to quantify the spectral index of the inner jet components from the model fits , since the inner jet is a complex area with multiple components and subject to component blending at 22 ghz .",
    "the approximately flat index for the core indicates a synchrotron turnover frequency between 22 and 43 ghz .",
    "this is consistent with the results of grandi et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , who concluded the turnover frequency lay between 37 and 90 ghz based on total flux density monitoring from 1992 december to 1993 january .",
    "the turnover frequency of the core is variable ; u89 found a turnover frequency around 11 ghz based on their three - frequency vlbi observations from 1983 .",
    "the steep spectral index of c4 indicates that this component is optically thin above 22 ghz .",
    "piner et al . ( 2000a ) found a spectral index for c4 of @xmath66 between 1.6 and 5 ghz , placing the turnover frequency for c4 between 5 and 22 ghz .",

    "monte carlo simulations of the egret blazar sample by lister ( 1998 ) predict a doppler factor distribution with a tail extending up to @xmath96 . however , these simulations were based on a maximum observed jet speed of 15@xmath97 . since recent results on the apparent speeds in egret blazars ( marscher et al .",
    "2000 ) show speeds up to @xmath98 ( @xmath99 for @xmath100 ) , revised simulations should show doppler factors extending up to @xmath101 .",
    "such high doppler factor sources would be intrinsically rare as evidenced by the absence of such high speeds in radio - selected samples ( kellermann et al .",
    "2000 ) , and would only be present in samples that have a stronger orientation bias as has been suggested for the egret sample ( marscher et al .",
    "when combined with the apparent jet speeds in 3c279 ( @xmath11  [ radmotion ] ) , a doppler factor @xmath102 implies an extremely small viewing angle and an extremely small opening angle .",
    "if the doppler factor is this high in the radio core then it is likely reduced by a slight bend of the radio jet away from the line - of - sight by the time vlbi scales have been reached .",
    "note that the doppler factor shown for c4 in figure 8@xmath50 ( @xmath11  [ 3dc4 ] ) is not a measurement , since we assumed a constant @xmath42 close to the minimum value allowed by the observed speed of c4 .",

    ", we obtain a rest - frame brightness temperature of @xmath105  k and a doppler factor of 7.4 using equations from lhteenmki et al .",
    "this implies that the jet of 3c279 is particle - dominated by many orders of magnitude , and the brightness temperature is limited by inverse compton effects .",
    "slysh ( 1992 ) argues that such a high rest - frame brightness temperature can be maintained on a timescale of years following the injection of electrons of sufficiently high energy , or can be maintained indefinitely with continuous in situ electron acceleration . in this case , the doppler factor for the 3c279 core is at the low end of the distribution expected for egret sources ( lister 1998 ) , and the jet must bend toward the line - of - sight as it moves from the core to c4 , since the doppler factor shown for c4 in figure 8@xmath50 is a lower limit for this component .",
    "the doppler factors and rest - frame brightness temperatures suggested by equipartition and by the variability brightness temperature are discrepant for 3c279 .",
    "this suggests that one of the following situations is true :    1 .",
    "3c279 is approximately in equipartition and has an extremely high doppler factor ( @xmath102 ) in the tail end of the distribution expected for egret blazars from the simulations of lister ( 1998 ) .",
    "this means the variability brightness temperature measured for 3c279 is a lower limit and the actual variability brightness temperature is much larger ( calculated rest - frame brightness temperature goes down and @xmath49 goes up as the variability brightness temperature increases for a given vlbi brightness temperature , see equations ( 6)-(8 ) of lhteenmaki et al .",
    "[ 1999 ] ) .",
    "this could only occur if extremely rapid variations in the 3c279 light curve had been missed .",
    "the measured variability brightness temperature is correct and 3c279 has a strongly particle - dominated parsec - scale jet where the rest - frame brightness temperature is high and limited by inverse compton effects . in this case",
    "the doppler factor for the 3c279 core would be at the low end of the distribution expected for egret sources from the simulations of lister ( 1998 ) .",
    "we have presented the results from our intensive high - frequency vlbi monitoring of 3c279 during the years 1991 to 1997 .",
    "three major results of this study are :    1 . : :    apparent speeds measured for six superluminal components range from    4.8 to 7.5@xmath0 .",
    "2 . : :    comparison of vlbi and single - dish light curves from metshovi show    that variations in the total flux density light curves can mainly be    accounted for by changes in the vlbi core flux density , not the jet .",
    "this contrasts both with 3c279 s behavior in the early 1980s ( u89 ) and    with that of 3c345 ( valtaoja et al .",
    "1999 ) , because in both of these    cases total flux density increases were linked to the youngest jet    component .",
    "3 . : :     the vlbi core is partially resolved and has a size of    @xmath50.07 mas at 22 ghz and @xmath50.045 mas    at 43 ghz . the uniform - sphere brightness temperature at 22 ghz is    @xmath4  k after 1995 , which is one of the    highest direct estimates of a brightness temperature . if the    variability brightness temperature measured for 3c279 by lhteenmki &    valtaoja ( 1999 ) is an actual value and not a lower limit , then the    rest - frame brightness temperature of 3c279 is quite high and limited    by inverse compton effects rather than equipartition .",
    "4 . : :    component c4 has been very long - lived and was detected at all epochs .",
    "c4 followed a curved path , and we were able to reconstruct its    3-dimensional trajectory by fitting polynomials to its position versus    time .",
    "the reconstructed trajectory is suggestive of low pitch angle    helical motion , and constrains the path of c4 to lie within    @xmath106 of the line - of - sight .",
    "5 . : :    there is a stationary component at @xmath51 mas that fades    and may move slightly inward during the course of our observations .",
    "this behavior could be due to a previous interaction with c4 , and    resembles the interactions between superluminal and stationary    components seen in simulations by gmez et al .",
    ": :    components in the inner jet were relatively short - lived , and faded by    the time they reached @xmath51 mas from the core . 7 .",
    ": :    the vlbi components have different speeds and position angles from    each other , but these differences do not match the differences    predicted by the precession model of abraham & carrara ( 1998 ) .",
    "the    position angles also differ from that of the larger - scale structure .",
    "the longer - lived component c4 shows no signs of altering its position    angle to match that of the larger - scale structure .",
    ": :    the intrinsic jet opening angle is constrained to be smaller than    about half a degree by the size and reconstructed trajectory of c4 .",
    ": :     although vlbi components were born about six months prior to each of    the two observed @xmath6-ray high states , the sparseness    of the @xmath6-ray data prevents a statistical analysis    of possible correlations .",
    ": :    the vlbi core spectrum indicates the core turnover frequency is    between 22 and 43 ghz .",
    "comparison of c4 s flux to that at lower    frequencies suggests a turnover frequency for this component between 5    and 22 ghz .",
    "completion of this large number of epochs moves 3c279 into the category of sources ( such as 3c345 ) for which large vlbi databases exist for detailed studies of jet properties .",
    "we suggest readers view the animations made from these observations at ftp://sgra.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/users/glenn/3c279_22ghz.mpeg and 3c279_43ghz.mpeg to fully appreciate the complexity of this source as revealed by multi - epoch monitoring .",
    "possible studies using this large amount of data could include application of specific hydrodynamic instability or magneto - hydrodynamic models to the motion of c4 , or application of precession models to the differing speeds and position angles of components using much more data than was used for the precession model of abraham & carrara ( 1998 )",
    ". future data reduction will include performing the polarization analysis of the polarization - sensitive observations listed in table  [ vlbiobs ] and analyzing all unreduced lower - frequency vlbi observations .",
    "together with data from this paper , x - ray data , and @xmath6-ray data , this should allow us to test inverse compton models against the multiwavelength spectrum ( piner et al .",
    "it will be important to continue monitoring 3c279 with the vlba throughout the years between the egret and glast missions , so that a deeper understanding of this canonical @xmath6-ray blazar can be obtained before the launch of the next @xmath6-ray mission .",
