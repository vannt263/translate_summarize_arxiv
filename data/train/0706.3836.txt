    "the hypernucleus is a strongly - interacting multibaryonic system with hyperon(s ) and its lifetime is as long as the typical order of the @xmath0 weak - interaction decay ( @xmath5 sec ) .",
    "thus a variety of hypernuclear phenomena provide us with new knowledge of baryon - baryon interactions and novel behaviors of many - body structures . among these systems",
    "the @xmath0-hypernuclei have been relatively well produced mainly through the @xmath6 and @xmath7 reactions . however , as these experiments have more or less limitation due to their own kinematics , more variety of hypernuclear production processes should be challenged in order to get information on detailed properties of hyperon - nucleon interactions . in this paper",
    "we like to demonstrate a new and wide possibility of the photo- and electro - production of hypernuclei , by taking the actual experimental facilities into account , and will show a novel aspect of the reaction spectroscopy .",
    "historically , the stopped k@xmath8 absorption reaction was utilized to produce @xmath0-hypernuclei of which decays were identified in bubble chamber and nuclear emulsion .",
    "next , the in - flight reaction @xmath9 with the kaon beam momenta @xmath10 had a unique role of getting particular hypernuclear excited states taking an advantage of the recoilless condition ( @xmath11 ) with very weak spin - flip transition",
    ". then a new stage of hypernuclear production was realized by employing the @xmath12 reaction mostly at @xmath13 .",
    "this @xmath14 reaction on nuclear targets played a great role of producing a series of all @xmath0 single - particle states inside the nucleus , since the process with recoil momentum @xmath15 preferentially excites hypernuclear high - spin stretched configurations with natural parity mainly due to the spin - non - flip component of the elementary amplitudes .",
    "more details can be found in the review papers  @xcite .",
    "in general , hypernuclear states consist of multiplets which are based on the nuclear core angular momentum @xmath16 coupled with that of a hyperon @xmath17 , so that low - lying doublets with a @xmath18-state @xmath0 have spin partners : @xmath19 .",
    "the @xmath6 reaction with spin - non - flip nature leads to excitation of one of the doublet member with natural parity .",
    "although the @xmath7 spin - flip component is sizable enough to produce appreciable polarization in the final hypernuclear states  @xcite , actually the favored states with large cross section are solely restricted to the natural parity states and their unnatural parity partners get very small cross section  @xcite . in addition",
    "the typical energy resolution achieved in the @xmath7 reaction spectroscopy is 1.45 mev at best  @xcite , which is much larger than the characteristic spin - doublet splittings of the order of a few tens kev .",
    "therefore , only the energy of natural parity member of the doublets can be accessible within the restriction of such energy resolution .",
    "the coincidence @xmath20-ray measurement proved to be a nice tool to know the detailed hypernuclear level energies with a remarkably good resolution of several kev  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the production processes mentioned above , which convert a neutron into @xmath0 , here we focus our attention on k@xmath21 photo- and electro - production process .",
    "these reactions convert a proton in nuclear targets into @xmath0 , so that new variety of hypernuclei can be produced .",
    "indeed much larger amount of spectroscopic data for other hypernuclei with various excited states are quite necessary to draw some clear conclusion about the nature of hyperon - nucleon interaction for which the elementary scattering experiments are not available . over 10 years ago ,",
    "three of the present authors predicted the photo - production cross sections for @xmath22li , @xmath23b , @xmath24c , and @xmath25o targets  @xcite . among others",
    "the @xmath24c case has been remarkably well confirmed by the first experiment on the nuclear target at the thomas jefferson national laboratory ( jlab )  @xcite .",
    "these factors explain the reasons why recently the photo- and electro - production of both hyperons and hypernuclei has attracted much attention in strangeness nuclear physics .",
    "in addition the following facts encourage us to extend the theoretical estimates to wider possibilities of precise reaction spectroscopy :    * the quality of cebaf beam ( high intensity and energy resolution ) at jlab makes it possible to identify various hypernuclear energy levels with appreciable cross sections together with a resolution of about 400 kev  @xcite . * the photo- and electro - production reactions , ( @xmath26 ) and ( e , ek@xmath21 ) , are characterized by the large momentum transfer ( @xmath27 350 mev/@xmath28 ) and the strong spin - flip terms .",
    "this means especially that photons ( real or virtual ) have unique characteristics of exciting unnatural parity high - spin hypernuclear states preferentially including states with deeply - bound @xmath0 hyperon  @xcite . *",
    "in contrast to @xmath29 or ( @xmath30 ) reactions , the electro - magnetic production of k@xmath31 pair on the proton makes it possible to study some `` proton - deficient '' hypernuclear species , such as @xmath32he , @xmath33li and @xmath34b , which are not available otherwise .",
    "such ability opens a new possibility of producing neutron - rich hypernuclei with large excess of neutral baryons .",
    "the same hypernuclei may be produced in @xmath35 reaction  @xcite , but due to the weak spin - flip interaction in the latter the two reactions will afford complementary information on hypernuclear spectroscopy .",

    "the preferential excitation of the high - spin states are attributed to the large momentum transfer ( about 350 mev/@xmath28 ) as similarly as in the case of the @xmath7 reaction .",
    "secondly , such a novel fact is revealed that the selectively excited state in each combination @xmath150_j$ ] has an unnatural parity with the maximum spin value of @xmath151 . in table",

    "major 3 doublets ( 6 peaks ) structure obtained with the simplified wave functions @xmath175 $ ] ( see table 2 ) well persist also in the new estimates .",
    "it is quite interesting to note that , for the major peaks , the use of the full space wave functions results in the reduction of the cross sections by a factor of about 0.65 in comparison with the single-@xmath176 estimate with @xmath143 .",
    "it should be also remarked that two pronounced peaks obtained at @xmath177 mev correspond to the @xmath146_{4 ^ -}$ ] and @xmath147_{3 ^ -}$ ] structure , respectively .",
    "as the hole - particle interactions for high - spin states are generally very small , the energy difference between these two peaks , if separated experimentally , provides us the spin - orbit splitting of the @xmath0 @xmath49-state .",
    "the third major doublet obtained at @xmath178  mev includes the unnatural parity highest - spin state @xmath148_{5^+}$ ] which should get the biggest cross section .",
    "if the @xmath179 state is bound or it is not bound but the energy position is not so high above the threshold , this peak width might be sharp enough to be identified in the experiment with the good energy resolution expected at jlab .",
    "as the partner has the dominant structure of @xmath149_{4^+}$ ] and the @xmath0n hole - particle interactions in high - spin states are very small , the energy difference between these two peaks is almost equal to the spin - orbit splitting of the @xmath180-state @xmath0 .",
    "thus the photo- and electro - production reactions will provide a nice opportunity of looking at such splittings in heavy systems if the energy resolution is good enough .",
    "it is interesting to see how different the theoretical hypernuclear production cross sections are when one uses different models of hyperon photo - production amplitudes . in section 3",
    "we have already discussed remarkable difference among the as1 , kmaid , c4 , and sla models . in table",
    "[ tab : si28al ] the cross sections of strongly excited states in @xmath1si(@xmath163al are compared as calculated with the sla and kmaid amplitudes .",
    "they are the cross sections expected within the @xmath159 shell model framework , noting that use of the @xmath159 wave functions give rise to a reduction factor of 0.61 in comparison with the single - j estimate of @xmath181 .",
    "one notes from table  [ tab : si28al ] that the kmaid amplitude gives approximately 30% smaller cross sections of the sla values when compared at @xmath139 .",
    "such difference has been suggested already in section 3 .",
    "the present treatment is a direct extension of that for the @xmath49-shell hypernuclear photo - production calculation  @xcite where always the full @xmath49-shell wave functions have been easily employed . in the case of @xmath49-shell hypernuclear production ,",
    "the particles involved in the low - lying state are in the @xmath18- and @xmath49-orbits , so that the `` high - spin '' selectivity mentioned above is realized as the transitions with @xmath182 , @xmath183 , and @xmath184 .",
    "it is worthwhile to remark that in fig .",
    "[ fig : a28fullsf ] there appear side peaks at @xmath185 and @xmath18614 mev in @xmath187al as similarly as confirmed in @xmath34c ( @xmath188 and @xmath189 ) .",
    "they are based on the @xmath18-state @xmath0 particle coupled to the excited states ( @xmath190 and @xmath191 ) in @xmath162al .",
    "the next sample target with heavier mass is @xmath2ca and the calculated excitation function for the @xmath2ca(@xmath192k is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig43gk ] . this target",
    "is doubly @xmath4-closed up to the @xmath193 shell , so that the situation is different from the @xmath1si case because @xmath2ca has the uppermost proton orbit of the @xmath194-type",
    ". therefore the highest spin in a @xmath195_j$ ] multiplet is @xmath196 with a natural parity .",
    "on the other hand , in a @xmath197_j$ ] multiplet the highest spin is @xmath198 , so that this restriction on the smaller angular momentum transfer makes the latter cross sections much smaller than the former case with @xmath199 .",
    "this situation of the @xmath194-closed shell explains why the dominant peak series shown in fig .  [ fig43gk ] consists of the natural parity @xmath183 , @xmath200 , and @xmath201 states accompanied with only minor side peaks of the @xmath202 , @xmath203 , and @xmath184 states , respectively . in other word , if these pronounced peak positions are measured with good energy resolution in a future experiment , they tells us the exact energies of the @xmath0 particle in the @xmath204 , @xmath205 , and @xmath179 , respectively .",
    "the broad background shown in fig .",
    "[ fig43gk ] reflects the strengths originating from the deeper proton shell , @xmath206 , which has the spreading width of several mev .",
    "in reality we also expect extra small peaks between the pronounced peaks , as they might be based on the fragmentation of the @xmath193 proton hole strength . in spite of such factors ,",
    "the photo - production reaction with this kind of doubly @xmath4-closed target might give a nice example of showing up the @xmath0 single - particle energies in medium - heavy mass region .",
    "finally we add the case of the @xmath3cr target as a typical candidate from the @xmath207-shell region of nuclei .",
    "the calculated results for the @xmath3cr(@xmath208v reaction spectrum is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig52gk ] , where the vertical axis shows simply the cross section value in nb / sr .",
    "therefore , differently from the former figures , here we do not take the smearing width into account when we show the major series of the pronounced peaks by solid lines .",
    "the c4 elementary amplitude is employed here , although it leads to overestimates of the cross section by about 25% .",
    "it is also noted that in fig .",
    "[ fig52gk ] we show positions of broad peaks by gray blocks originating from deeper proton hole orbits such as @xmath209 and @xmath210 .",
    "the height@xmath211width of each gray block correspond to the calculated cross section estimates the @xmath3cr target has four protons in the uppermost @xmath212 shell and the neutron is @xmath213-closed .",
    "therefore it is easy to understand that the major peak series are based on the conversion of the @xmath214 protons into the @xmath0-particle sitting in the @xmath18 , @xmath49 , @xmath180 , and @xmath215 orbits .",
    "in fact we confirmed by the calculation that the dominant peak series consists of the unnatural parity @xmath216_{j = j_{\\rm max}}$ ] states with @xmath217 where @xmath218 , @xmath219 , @xmath220 , and @xmath221 , respectively . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath0 spin - orbit partner states @xmath222_{j = l_{\\rm max}}$ ] ( @xmath223 ) gain about 60% production rate of the corresponding biggest peak within each multiplet . therefore ,",
    "if the energy resolution is good enough , there will be a chance to get information on the @xmath224-splitting in this medium - mass region . in the present case",
    ", the other angular momentum states also have certain ( non negligible ) contributions to each peak .",
    "it should be mentioned that , if we improve the description of the @xmath225v nuclear excited states , we will also get very weak excited side peaks among the strong peaks shown here .",
    "see also the report  @xcite .",
    "the first ( e , ek@xmath21 ) experiment on the nuclear target ( @xmath24c ) was reported recently from the jefferson lab , proving it to be a nice tool for spectroscopic study of @xmath0 hypernuclei .",
    "as our theoretical prediction has been confirmed remarkably by this experiment , we applied its framework to typical heavier targets with careful consideration of modern elementary amplitudes for hyperon photo - production . in this paper",
    "we presented the ( @xmath20,@xmath226 ) excitation spectra for producing medium - mass @xmath0-hypernuclei , where we focused our attention to the novel and characteristic features of the reaction process .",
    "we started with discussions on the basic properties of modern elementary amplitudes of kaon photo - production process . among many theoretical attempts ,",
    "the isobaric models for the @xmath227 process based on the feynman diagram technique are of interest and successful in the kinematical region assumed here , @xmath228 gev .",
    "four elementary amplitudes of the models are adopted in this paper , i.e. , those denoted as kaon - maid ( kmaid ) , adelseck - saghai ( as1 ) , williams - ji - cotanch ( c4 ) and saclay - lyon a ( sla ) models .",
    "the models differ in their own choices of nucleon and hyperon resonances .",
    "detailed comparison of the models has been done for the differential cross sections and polarizations for the elementary @xmath229 and their results are compared with the available experimental data .",
    "some variances of agreement between the models exist at higher energies @xmath230 gev . however , all the four models are acceptable at @xmath231 gev which is concerned in the present hypernuclear calculations .",
    "the unique and interesting feature of the @xmath232 amplitudes lies in that the spin - flip amplitudes are much larger in magnitude than the spin - non - flip one even at the forward angles at @xmath233 and @xmath234 and at energy @xmath235 gev .",
    "this feature of the amplitude together with the large momentum transfer ( @xmath236 mev/@xmath28 ) yields the novel and selective features of the excitation spectra in the medium - heavy @xmath0-hypernuclei .",
    "here we choose @xmath41 , @xmath38 and @xmath237 as the typical medium - mass target nuclei for the spectroscopic study of the @xmath0-hypernuclei in the @xmath238 reactions .",
    "first the excitation spectra of @xmath239 are discussed for two model calculations of @xmath41 . when the simple @xmath240-closed configuration is assumed for @xmath41 as a demonstrative model ,",
    "the characteristic and unique excitation function is clearly seen .",
    "the result emphasized first is the selective excitation of the highest - spin state within each 1h-1p multiplet such as @xmath241_{4 ^ -}$ ] , @xmath242_{3 ^ -}$ ] , @xmath243_{5^+}$ ] and @xmath244_{4^+}$ ] .",
    "this is due to the large momentum transfer for the reaction process .",
    "second , such a novel fact is revealed that the selectively excited states with @xmath245_j$ ] are strongly populated and have unnatural parities with maximum spins of @xmath246 .",
    "this is attributed to the spin - flip transition dominance in the elementary hyperon photo - production reaction .",
    "this kind of selectivity is not seen in other hypernuclear production processes such as @xmath6 and @xmath7 reactions .",
    "the calculation has been extended to the @xmath159 full space model to describe @xmath41 .",
    "excitation function for the @xmath247 is presented , taking the empirical particle - hole width into account tentatively so as to make the comparison with the future experiment possible .",
    "the major doublets and peaks obtained with the simplified model well persist also in the extended estimates .",
    "the energy splitting of the two peaks with structures , such as @xmath241_{4 ^ -}$ ] and @xmath242_{3 ^ -}$ ] , and @xmath243_{5^+}$ ] and @xmath244_{4^+}$ ] corresponding to the proton hole in @xmath248 and @xmath0 in @xmath249 and @xmath250 , if observed experimentally , might give us information on the spin - orbit splitting of the @xmath0 @xmath49- and @xmath180-states , respectively .",
    "the photo - production reactions with @xmath38 and @xmath237 targets are discussed as other interesting cases .",
    "the former nucleus is @xmath4-closed up to @xmath251 shell orbit , so that the highest spin in the @xmath252_j$ ] multiplet is @xmath253 with a natural parity and such a state is strongly excited .",
    "however , the states of @xmath254_j\\,$]-type with @xmath255 have weak strengths in the excitation function .",
    "the @xmath256-closed shell nuclear target presents the dominant peaks of natural parity , i.e. , @xmath257 and @xmath201 as seen in @xmath258 .",
    "the present case seems to be a nice example of getting the @xmath0 single - particle energies in this mass region which has not been explored with good energy resolution .",
    "the @xmath39 target contains four protons in an active @xmath214 shell orbit .",
    "the dominant peak series in the @xmath238 reaction consists of unnatural parity states of @xmath259_j\\,$]-type with @xmath260 and @xmath261 , @xmath262 and 2 , respectively , while the @xmath0 spin - orbit partner states @xmath263_{j = l_{\\rm max}}$ ] have reduced strength as about 60% of the biggest peak within each multiplet .",
    "conclusively , the @xmath40 photo - production reactions on the medium - mass nuclear targets will provide us with novel and unique features in the @xmath0-hypernuclear spectroscopy through the selective excitation of unnatural parity highest - spin states ( natural parity high - spin states for the @xmath4-closed targets ) . a possibility is also pointed out that we might have a chance to investigate @xmath0 single - particle energies over whole periodic table including the spin - orbit splitting for @xmath49- , @xmath180- , and @xmath215-orbits .",
    "it is also notable that the reaction on various nuclear targets produces proton - deficient hypernuclear species otherwise unaccessible .",
    "thus the photo- and electro - production of @xmath0-hypernuclei will offer a nice opportunity to get knowledge on the dynamical behavior of hyperon - nucleus coupling and on the baryon behavior deeply inside the nucleus .",
