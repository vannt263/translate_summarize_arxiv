    "neutrinos play a decisive role in many aspects of astrophysics and determining their properties is considered the most promising gateway to novel physics beyond the standard model of elementary particle physics . thus detecting and studying",
    "accelerator - made or astrophysical neutrinos is a forefront research issue worldwide with many ongoing and planned activities .",
    "one of the fundamental questions currently investigated is whether neutrinos have a finite mass .",
    "this question can be answered by the potential detection of neutrino oscillations which would establish the existence of at least one family of massive neutrinos .",
    "furthermore , the existence of massive neutrinos might have profound consequences on many branches of cosmology and astrophysics , e.g. the expansion of the universe and the formation of galaxies , while neutrino oscillations can have interesting effects on supernova nucleosynthesis @xcite .    from the many experiments directly searching for neutrino oscillations ,",
    "only the lsnd collaboration has reported positive candidate events @xcite .",
    "indirect evidence for neutrino oscillations arises from the deficit of solar neutrinos , as observed by all solar - neutrino detectors @xcite , and the suppression and its angular dependence of events induced by atmospheric @xmath3 neutrinos in superkamiokande @xcite . due to the obvious importance",
    ", the oscillation results implied from these experiments will be cross - checked by future long - baseline experiments like minos @xcite . from the detectors currently",
    "operable karmen has a neutrino - oscillation sensitivity similar to the lsnd experiment .",
    "currently , the karmen collaboration does not observe oscillations covering most of the oscillation parameter space for the positive lsnd result @xcite .",
    "a type ii supernova releases most of its energy in terms of neutrinos .",
    "supernova neutrinos from sn87a had been observed by the kamiokande and imb detectors @xcite and have confirmed the general supernova picture .",
    "the observed events were most likely due to @xmath4 antineutrinos .",
    "however , the models predict distinct differences in the neutrino distributions for the various families and thus a more restrictive test of the current supernova theory requires the abilities of neutrino spectroscopy by the neutrino detectors .",
    "current ( e.g. superkamiokande and sno ) and future detectors ( including the proposed omnis @xcite and land @xcite projects ) have this capability and will be able to distinguish between the different neutrino types and determine their individual spectra .",
    "for the water erenkov detectors ( sno and superkamiokande ) @xmath5 neutrinos can be detected by specific neutral - current events @xcite , while the omnis and land detectors are proposed to detect neutrons spallated from target nuclei by charged- and neutral - current neutrino interactions .",
    "some of the supernova - neutrino or neutrino - oscillation detectors use iron or lead as detector material ( e.g. minos , land and omnis ) or have adopted steel ( lsnd , karmen ) and lead ( lsnd ) shielding .",
    "thus , precise theoretical estimates of the neutrino - induced cross sections on fe and pb are required for a reliable knowledge of the detection signal or the appropriate simulation of background events .",
    "we note that the karmen collaboration has recently used its sensitivity to the @xmath1fe(@xmath2)@xmath1co background events to determine a cross section for this reaction @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite we have calculated this cross section in a hybrid model in which the allowed transitions have been studied based on the interacting shell model , while the forbidden transitions were calculated within the continuum random phase approximation . in this paper",
    "we extend this investigation and study the charged- and neutral current reactions on @xmath1fe and @xmath0pb for various accelerator - based and supernova neutrino distributions .",
    "in particular , we determine the @xmath0pb(@xmath2 ) cross sections for the lsnd neutrino spectra which will serve for even improved background simulations for this detector .",
    "our calculations of supernova neutrino reaction cross sections on @xmath1fe and @xmath0pb are aimed to guide the design of supernova neutrino detectors like omnis and land . with this goal in mind",
    "we have calculated the energy spectrum of neutrons knocked - out by the charged - current or neutral - current neutrino - induced excitation of @xmath1fe and @xmath0pb . to allow also the exploration of potential oscillation scenarios we have calculated the cross sections and neutron spectra for various supernova neutrino spectra .",
    "besides the total cross sections , the partial cross sections for neutrino - induced particle knock - out are of relevance to estimate the signal and background of the various detectors . we will calculate these partial cross sections in a two - step process ( e.g. for the charged - current reaction ) :    @xmath6    in the first step , we calculate the @xmath7-induced spectrum @xmath8 in the daughter nucleus at excitation energy @xmath9 .",
    "we consider multipole excitations of both parities and angular momenta @xmath10 , using the formalism developed in@xcite .",
    "these multipole operators , denoted by @xmath11 , depend on the momentum transfer @xmath12 .",
    "our strategy to calculate @xmath8 has been different for @xmath1fe and @xmath0pb . for @xmath1fe",
    "we adopt the same hybrid model which has already been successfully applied in @xcite .",
    "that is , we calculate all nuclear responses within the random phase approximation ( rpa )",
    ". however , the rpa does not usually recover sufficient nucleon - nucleon correlations to reliably reproduce the quenching and fragmentation of the gamow - teller ( gt ) strength distribution in nuclei .",
    "for this reason we determine the response of the @xmath13 operator on the basis of an interacting shell model calculation performed within the complete @xmath14 shell .",
    "such a study has been proven to reproduce the experimental gt@xmath15 ( in which a neutron is changed into a proton ) and gt@xmath16 ( in which a proton is changed into a neutron ) distributions on @xmath1fe well @xcite , if the response is quenched by a universal factor @xmath17 @xcite",
    ". however , the gt operator corresponds to the appropriate @xmath18 operator only in the limit of momentum transfer @xmath19 . as it has been pointed out in @xcite , the consideration of the finite - momentum transfer in the operator results in a reduction of the cross sections , caused by the destructive interference with the higher - order operator @xmath20 . to account for the effect of the finite momentum transfer we have performed rpa calculations for the @xmath21 multipole operator at finite momentum transfer @xmath12 ( i.e. @xmath22 ) and for @xmath23 ( i.e. @xmath24 ) and have scaled the shell model gt strength distribution by the ratio of @xmath22 and @xmath24 rpa cross sections .",
    "the correction is rather small for @xmath25 neutrinos stemming from muon - decay - at - rest ( i.e. for lsnd and karmen ) or for supernova @xmath25 neutrinos .",
    "the correction is , however , sizeable if neutrino oscillations occur in the accelerator - based experiments or a supernova @xcite",
    ".    for @xmath0pb a converged shell - model calculation of the gt strength distribution is yet not computationally feasible .",
    "thus we have also calculated the @xmath21 response within the rpa approach .",
    "note that our rpa approach fulfills the fermi and ikeda sumrules . as the @xmath26 strength ( in this direction a proton",
    "is changed into a neutron ) is strongly suppressed for @xmath0pb , the ikeda sumrule fixes the @xmath27 strength .",
    "we have renormalized the @xmath13 strength in @xmath0pb by the universal quenching factor which , due to a very slight @xmath28-dependence is recommended to be @xmath29 in @xmath0pb @xcite .",
    "thus the ikeda sumrule reads @xmath30 . for the other multipole operators no experimental evidence exists for such a rescaling and we have used the rpa response .    in our rpa calculations",
    "we have chosen the single - particle energies from an appropriate woods - saxon potential , which has been adjusted to reproduce the relevant particle thresholds .",
    "as residual interaction we used the zero - range landau - migdal force from @xcite . however , it is well known that this parameterization places the isobaric analog state in @xmath0bi at too high an energy .",
    "this is cured by changing the parameter , which multiplies the @xmath31 term in the interaction from @xmath32 to the value 0.9 @xcite .",
    "after this adjustment the ias is very close ( @xmath33 mev ) to the experimental position ( 15.16 mev ) .",
    "furthermore , our rpa parametrization has been demonstrated to describe the @xmath0pb(p , n ) reaction data at small forward angle well @xcite .",
    "our rpa approaches are described in details in refs .",
    "we note that this approach gives quite satisfying results for neutrino scattering @xcite , muon capture @xcite and electron scattering @xcite .",
    "after having determined the neutrino - induced excitation spectrum in the daughter nucleus , we calculate in the second step for each final state with well - defined energy , angular momentum , and parity the branching ratios into the various decay channels using the statistical model code smoker @xcite .",
    "the decay channels considered are proton , neutron , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 emission . as possible final states in the residual nucleus the smoker code considers the experimentally known levels supplemented at higher energies by an appropriate level density formula . note , that the smoker code has been successfully applied to many astrophysical problems and that we empirically found good agreement between p / n branching - ratios calculated with smoker and within continuum rpa for several neutral current reactions on light nuclei @xcite .    as supernova and",
    "accelerator - produced neutrinos have an energy spectrum , the final results ( total and partial cross sections ) are obtained by folding with the appropriate neutrino spectra .",
    "the @xmath25 neutrinos produced in the muon decay - at - rest ( dar ) , have the characteristic michel energy spectrum @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the muon mass and @xmath38 the neutrino energy .",
    "our calculated excitation spectrum for the @xmath1fe(@xmath2)@xmath1co reaction is shown in @xcite . fig .",
    "1 shows the rpa response for the @xmath0pb(@xmath2)@xmath0bi reaction , calculated for a muon decay - at - rest neutrino spectrum .",
    "reaction on @xmath0pb induced by dar @xmath25 neutrinos.,height=340 ]    the collective gt transition is found at an excitation energy of around @xmath39 mev in @xmath0bi , again close to the centroid of the experimentally observed gt strength distribution which is at around 15.6 mev @xcite . as has already been observed in @xcite ,",
    "rpa calculations also predict gt@xmath15 strength at lower excitation energies , which then correspond mainly to individual single - particle transitions . due to phase space ,",
    "these low - lying transitions are noticeably enhanced in neutrino - induced reactions with respect to the collective transition .",
    "our calculation indicates the low - lying gt strength to be mainly centered at around @xmath40 mev in @xmath0bi .",
    "there might be some evidence for such a transition in the experimental ( p , n ) spectra on @xmath0pb @xcite .",
    "however , a doubtless experimental confirmation would be quite desirable .",
    "the first - forbidden transitions lead mainly to @xmath41 and @xmath42 states in @xmath0bi . in our calculation",
    "these transitions are fragmented over states in the energy interval between 17 mev and 26 mev , although we find @xmath42 strength also at rather low excitation energies @xmath43 mev and 7.5 mev .",
    "experimentally @xmath42 strength has been observed at @xmath44 mev @xcite .    to check the reliability of our approach we have performed several additional calculations . at first",
    "we have calculated the gt response for @xmath1fe within the rpa approach .",
    "then the gt distribution is focussed in two strong transitions at @xmath45 mev and 10.5 mev in @xmath1co , corresponding to the change of a @xmath46 neutron into @xmath46 and @xmath47 protons , respectively , clearly showing the inappropriate fragmentation of the gt strength within the rpa . however , we find that this shortcoming does not strongly influence the calculated cross section .",
    "if we correct for the overestimation of the total rpa @xmath48 strength compared with the shell model ( and data ) , we find an rpa gt contribution to the @xmath1fe(@xmath2)@xmath1co cross section in close agreement to the shell model result ( better than @xmath49 ) .",
    "we thus conclude that our total @xmath0pb(@xmath2)@xmath0bi cross section , for which we could not calculate the @xmath18 contribution on the basis of the shell model , is probably quite reliable .    due to the energy and momentum - transfer involved , muon capture is mainly sensitive to forbidden transitions ( @xmath50 and @xmath42 for @xmath1fe and @xmath51 and @xmath52 for @xmath0pb ) .",
    "we have tested our model description for forbidden transitions by calculating the total muon capture rates for @xmath1fe and @xmath0pb and obtain results @xmath53 s@xmath54 and @xmath55 s@xmath54 ) which agree rather well with experiment ( @xmath56 s@xmath54 and @xmath57 s@xmath54 , respectively @xcite ) .",
    "further details on these studies will be published elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the karmen collaboration has measured the total @xmath1fe(@xmath2)@xmath1co cross section for the dar neutrino spectrum and obtains @xmath58 @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "we calculate a result in close agreement @xmath60 @xmath59 . in table 1",
    "we have listed the partial cross sections into the various decay channels . as the isobaric analog state ( ias ) at @xmath61 mev and",
    "most of the gt@xmath15 strength resides below the particle thresholds in @xmath1co ( the proton and neutron thresholds are at 5.85 mev and 10.08 mev , respectively ) , most of the neutrino - induced reactions on @xmath1fe leads to particle - bound states , which then decay by @xmath35 emission . due to the lower threshold ,",
    "neutrino - induced excitation of particle - unbound states in @xmath1co is dominantly followed by proton decays .",
    "the rather high threshold energy ( 7.76 mev ) and the larger coulomb barrier makes decay into the @xmath34-channel rather unimportant .",
    "now we turn our discussion to @xmath0pb which is the shielding material of the lsnd detector .",
    "the simple ( @xmath62 ) scaling of the fermi and ikeda sumrules indicates that the ( @xmath63 ) cross section on @xmath0pb is significantly larger than on @xmath1fe .",
    "the cross section is additionally enlarged by the strong z - dependence of the fermi function .",
    "in total we find that the ( @xmath2 ) cross section on @xmath0pb is about 15 times bigger than for @xmath1fe . furthermore",
    ", as the ias energy and the gt@xmath15 strength is above the neutron threshold in @xmath0bi at 6.9 mev , most of the ( @xmath2 ) cross section leads to particle - unbound states .",
    "these expectations are born out by a detailed calculation which finds a total cross section of @xmath64 @xmath59 .",
    "the partial @xmath0pb(@xmath65)@xmath66bi cross section dominates and amounts to about @xmath67 of the total cross section .",
    "as can be seen in table 1 , the remaining cross section mainly goes to particle - bound levels and hence decays by @xmath35 emission .    for the general reasons given above",
    ", our theoretical estimate for the @xmath0pb(@xmath2)@xmath0bi cross section is probably quite reliable and should be useful for improved background simulations of the lsnd detector .",
    "it is also quite interesting to turn the problem around and ask whether the lsnd collaboration can actually measure this cross section . to this end",
    "we have estimated the total number of neutrino - induced events in the lead shielding @xcite ( volume @xmath68 m@xmath69 , density @xmath70 g / cm@xmath69 ) of the lsnd detector assuming an annual lsnd neutrino flux of @xmath72/y .",
    "then our @xmath0pb(@xmath63)@xmath0bi cross section translates into 200 000 events for the 3 year running time from 1996 - 98 . in about 180 000 events",
    "a neutron is knocked out of the lead target .",
    "the electron will not travel directly into the detector , but will shower in the shielding producing photons which in turn might reach the detector in which they produce compton electrons .",
    "the karmen collaboration has observed this process for the @xmath1fe shielding and quotes an efficiency of their detector of @xmath73 .",
    "if the lsnd detector has a comparable efficiency for this process , it should be able to observe the @xmath0pb(@xmath74)@xmath66bi cross section where the events are most likely at the edges .",
    "on the other hand , the correlated observation of a neutron and a lepton constitutes the lsnd neutrino oscillation signal . for this reason ,",
    "the lsnd collaboration suppresses the events stemming from neutrino interactions on lead by appropriate energy and spatial cuts .",
    "however , our calculated @xmath0pb(@xmath74 ) cross section might allow the lsnd collaboration to further improve their background simulations .",
    "the lsnd oscillation experiment studies their events as function of energy of the outgoing lepton , setting cuts at 20  mev , 36  mev , and 53  mev .",
    "we have therefore also calculated the @xmath0pb(@xmath75)@xmath66bi cross section as function of the final lepton energy , which is shown in fig .  2 .",
    "pb(@xmath74)@xmath66bi cross section for dar neutrinos as function of final electron energy.,height=340 ]    the lsnd neutrino beam has a small admixture of @xmath3 neutrinos stemming from pion - in - flight ( dif ) decays .",
    "these neutrinos have in fact high enough energies to significantly produce muons by the charged - current ( @xmath76 ) reaction ( this beam property allowed the lsnd collaboration to measure the inclusive @xmath77c(@xmath76)@xmath77n cross section and to test universality in a neutrino experiment on nuclei @xcite ) . for the oscillation search events stemming from the @xmath78 reaction , with a possible misinterpretation of the lepton in the final channel , are considered a possible background .",
    "for this reason we have also calculated the total and partial ( @xmath76 ) cross sections on @xmath0pb for the lsnd dif @xmath3 neutrino spectrum .",
    "the results are shown in table 2 .",
    "we note that the ` most effective ' neutrino energy defined by @xmath79 is larger for dif neutrinos ( @xmath80 mev ) than for dar neutrinos ( @xmath81 mev ) . thus ,",
    "even if the mass difference between muon and electron is considered , the phase space favors the reaction induced by dif @xmath3 neutrinos .",
    "consequently the total cross section for the charged - current reaction on @xmath0pb induced by dif @xmath3 neutrinos is larger ( by roughly a factor 3 ) than induced by dar @xmath25 neutrinos . although the average excitation energy in the daughter nucleus is also slightly higher for dif @xmath3 neutrinos than for dar @xmath25 neutrinos , the decay of the particle - unbound states is still dominantly into the neutron channel",
    ".    the lsnd collaboration observes candidate events which might imply @xmath82 neutrino oscillations @xcite .",
    "if this is the case the dif @xmath3 neutrinos can have changed into @xmath25 neutrinos before reaching the detector now allowing for @xmath0pb(@xmath2 ) reactions triggered by @xmath25 neutrinos with a significantly higher energy .",
    "we have studied the respective cross sections and have summarized them in table 3 .    for completeness , tables 2 and 3 also list the ( @xmath76 ) and ( @xmath2 ) cross sections on @xmath1fe , in both cases calculated for a dif neutrino spectrum .",
    "the observation of the neutrinos from sn1987a by the water erenkov detectors is generally considered as strong support that the identification of type ii supernovae as core collapse supernovae is correct .",
    "theoretical models predict that the proto - neutron star formed in the center of the supernova cools by the production of neutrino pairs , where the luminosity is approximately the same for all 3 neutrino families .",
    "the interaction of the neutrinos with the dense surrounding , consisting of ordinary neutron - rich matter , introduces characteristic differences in the neutrino distributions for the various families . as the @xmath83 and @xmath84 neutrinos and their antiparticles ( combined referred to as @xmath5 )",
    "have not enough energy to generate a muon or @xmath84 lepton , they decouple deepest in the star , i.e. at the highest temperature , and have an average energy of @xmath85 mev . as the @xmath25 and @xmath4 neutrinos",
    "interact with the neutron - rich matter via @xmath86 and @xmath87 , the @xmath4 neutrinos have a higher average energy ( @xmath88 mev ) than the @xmath25 neutrinos ( @xmath89 mev ) . clearly",
    "an observational verification of this temperature hierarchy would establish a strong test of our current supernova models .",
    "the distribution of the various supernova neutrino species is usually described by a fermi - dirac spectrum @xmath90 + 1}\\ ] ] where @xmath91 are parameters fitted to numerical spectra , and @xmath92 normalizes the spectrum to unit flux .",
    "the transport calculations of janka @xcite yield spectra with @xmath93 for all neutrino species .",
    "while this choice also gives good fits to the @xmath25 and @xmath94 spectra calculated by wilson and mayle @xcite , their @xmath5 spectra favor @xmath95 . in the following",
    "we will present results for charged- and neutral current reactions on @xmath1fe and @xmath0pb for both values of @xmath34 .",
    "in particular we will include results for those ( t,@xmath34 ) values which are currently favored for the various neutrino types ( t in mev ) : ( t,@xmath34)= ( 4,0 ) and ( 3,3 ) for @xmath25 neutrinos , ( 5,0 ) and ( 4,3 ) for @xmath94 neutrinos and ( 8,0 ) and ( 6.26,3 ) for @xmath5 neutrinos .    before discussing our neutral - current results for @xmath0pb",
    "we like to present the multipole response as calculated within our rpa study .",
    "this is done in fig .",
    "3 which shows the @xmath0pb photoabsorption cross section in the upper part as well as the excitation function for inelastic scattering on @xmath0pb by neutrinos with a fermi - dirac distribution with parameters @xmath96 mev and @xmath95 in the lower part .",
    "the calculated photoabsorption cross section is fragmented between 10 - 16 mev excitation energy centred around @xmath97 mev .",
    "this is reasonably close to the experimental spectrum which is centred around 13.8 mev with a width of 3.8 mev @xcite .",
    "summing over all excitation energies we obtain 3.0 mev@xmath98b for the total photoabsorption cross section , which is in agreement with the classical thomas , reiche and kuhn sum rule value ( 2.98 mev@xmath98b ) and also lies within the range of experimental values ( 2.9 to 4.1 mev@xmath98b , see table  5 of ref .",

    "3 demonstrates clearly that inelastic neutrino scattering additionally excites the spin response which is responsible for the two strong @xmath99 transitions around 10 mev and 18 mev . as expected from the general effects of the residual interaction the @xmath42 part of the spin dipole excitations",
    "is located a few mev lower in energy than the @xmath41 strength @xcite .",
    "we finally note that the gamow - teller strength is calculated between 7 mev and 8 mev , in close agreement with the experimentally observed m1 strength .",
    "table 4 summarizes the total and partial cross sections for neutral current reactions on @xmath1fe and @xmath0pb . for @xmath1fe",
    "the neutron and proton thresholds open at 11.2  mev and 10.18  mev , respectively . but",
    "despite the slightly higher threshold energy , the additional coulomb barrier in the proton channel makes the neutron channel the dominating decay mode . with increasing average neutrino energies",
    "the total cross section grows .",
    "but this increase is noticeably weaker than for the nuclei @xmath77c and @xmath100o .",
    "this is related to the isovector dominance of the neutrino - induced reactions . in the @xmath101 nuclei @xmath77c and",
    "@xmath100o inelastic neutrino scattering has to overcome a rather large threshold to reach the @xmath102 excitation spectrum in the nuclei making the cross section rather sensitive to the neutrino spectrum .",
    "the total and partial cross sections for charged current ( @xmath2 ) and ( @xmath103 ) reactions on @xmath1fe and @xmath0pb are listed in table 5 .",
    "as the average energy for supernova @xmath25 neutrinos ( @xmath104 mev ) is less than for dar neutrinos ( @xmath105 mev ) , the total cross sections are significantly smaller for supernova ( i.e. ( t,@xmath34)=(4,0 ) or ( 3,3 ) ) neutrinos .",
    "relatedly the low - energy excitation spectrum is stronger weighted by phase space .",
    "hence , the @xmath25-induced reaction on @xmath1fe leads dominantly to particle - bound states ( @xmath106 ) and therefore decays by @xmath35 emission . as for dar neutrinos",
    ", the strongest decay mode for @xmath25-induced reactions on @xmath0pb is given by the neutron channel .    as lead is discussed as material for potential supernova neutrino detectors ( like land and omnis ) , the relevant neutrino - induced reactions on @xmath0pb have been estimated previously .",
    "the first work , performed in @xcite , has been criticized and improved in @xcite .",
    "these authors estimated the allowed transitions to the charged - current and neutral - current cross sections empirically using data from ( p , n ) scattering and from the m1 response to fix the gamow - teller contributions to the cross section .",
    "we note that these data place the gt@xmath15 strength in one resonance centered just above the 2n threshold .",
    "low - lying gt@xmath15 transitions , as indicated by the present rpa calculation , have not been considered in @xcite .",
    "@xcite completed their cross section estimates by calculating the first - forbidden contributions on the basis of the goldhaber - teller model .",
    "although the total charged - current @xmath0pb(@xmath2)@xmath0bi cross section is strongly constrained by sumrules and our calculation as well as the work of ref .",
    "@xcite reproduce the energies of the ias state and the main gt resonance , our results clearly deviate with increasing neutrino energies from the calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite . for @xmath25 neutrinos with a ( t,@xmath34)=(3,3 )",
    "fermi - dirac distribution our cross section ( @xmath107 @xmath59 ) is in rough agreement with the one obtained in @xcite .",
    "( as @xcite does not give the cross section for a ( t=3,@xmath34=3 ) spectrum , we have estimated it from the cross sections given at neighboring temperatures taken from table i of @xcite . )",
    "but with increasing neutrino energies our calculated cross sections become significantly smaller than the estimate given in @xcite , and for a @xmath25 spectrum with ( t,@xmath34)=(8,0 ) our value ( @xmath108 @xmath59 ) is about @xmath109 smaller than the estimate by ref .",
    "@xcite ( @xmath110 @xmath59 ) . for the latter neutrino spectrum",
    "the cross section is dominated by forbidden transitions , and the observed difference might reflect the uncertainties of the goldhaber - teller model to describe this response .    for the total neutral - current cross sections on @xmath0pb the estimates in @xcite",
    "are noticeably larger than our results ( by factors in the range 23 for the various fermi - dirac spectra ) for all energies .",
    "as pointed out by haxton @xcite the total ( @xmath111 ) cross sections on nuclei induced by supernova neutrinos with high energetic fermi - dirac distributions follow a simple rule of thumb : @xmath112 the proportionality factor depends on the parameters of the fermi - dirac spectrum . from rpa studies one finds @xmath113 for @xmath96 mev and @xmath95 @xcite , while the proportionality factor is slightly smaller for closed - shell nuclei .",
    "we note that our present results fit well into the expected systematics : @xmath114 for @xmath1fe ( open shell ) and 0.67 for @xmath0pb ( closed shell ) .    besides detecting a supernova neutrino signal",
    ", modern detectors should also have a ` neutrino spectroscopy ability ' , i.e. it is desirable to assign observed events to the neutrino type which has triggered it .",
    "detectors like land and omnis will observe the neutrons produced by neutrino - induced reactions on @xmath0pb .",
    "an obvious neutrino signal then is the total count rate .",
    "however , as already pointed out in @xcite , the total neutron count rate in a lead detector does not allow to distinguish between events triggered by @xmath25 neutrinos and @xmath5 neutrinos .",
    "we confirm this argument as our total ( @xmath115 ) cross section ( e.g. for ( t,@xmath34)=(4,0 ) it is @xmath116 @xmath59 ) is quite similar to the neutral current cross section ( for ( t,@xmath34)=(8,0 ) neutrinos we find @xmath117 @xmath59 per neutrino family ) .",
    "the situation is , however , different for @xmath1fe .",
    "here we find , for the same neutrino spectra as above , that the total neutron counting rate in the neutral - current reaction is about 30  times larger than for the charged - current reaction .",
    "if we consider that supernova @xmath5 neutrinos comprise 4 neutrino types with about the same spectrum , the neutron response of a @xmath1fe detector to supernova neutrinos is expected to be dominated by neutral current events caused by @xmath5 neutrinos .",
    "the differences in the ratios for neutral- and charged current neutron yields again reflect the more general tendency that neutral - current cross sections for supernova @xmath5 neutrinos scale approximately with the mass number @xmath28 of the target , while the charged - current cross sections for supernova @xmath25 neutrinos depends on the @xmath62 neutron excess of the target via the fermi and ikeda sumrules ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this suggests @xcite that neutrino detectors which can only determine total neutron counting rates can have supernova neutrino spectroscopy ability if they are made of various materials with quite different @xmath118 values as the ratio of neutral- to charged - current cross sections is quite sensitive to the charge number of the detector material . of course , it is then necessary to assign observed events to the detector material .",
    "neutrino detectors of large size will probably not be build from isotopically enriched iron or lead , because the costs will be very high .",
    "therefore , in principle , in addition to @xmath1fe ( 91.75% natural abundance ) and @xmath0pb ( 52.4% ) , also cross sections for neutrino induced reactions on the other stable isotopes @xmath119fe ( 5.85% ) , @xmath120fe ( 2.12% ) , @xmath121fe ( 0.28% ) , @xmath122pb ( 24.1% ) , @xmath66pb ( 22.1% ) , @xmath123pb ( 1.4% ) are needed .",
    "but from the rule of thumb ( eq .  [ ruth ] ) we can already conclude that the isotope effect on the neutral - current cross sections will be small .",
    "this has been confirmed for the iron isotope chain @xmath124fe within a recent shell model plus rpa approach which finds less than 16% deviation from the simple scaling rule ( eq . [ ruth ] ) @xcite .",
    "contrary the isotope effect on the charged - current cross sections will be strong , because they dominantly scale with ( n - z ) like mentioned above via the fermi and ikeda sumrules .",
    "this is again confirmed in the shell model plus rpa study which finds less than @xmath125 deviation in the charged - current cross sections for @xmath126 mev and @xmath95 neutrinos from the simple @xmath127 scaling @xcite .",
    "we expect that the rule of thumb ( eq .",
    "( 4 ) ) and the @xmath127 scaling is also valid for the neutral - current and charged - current reactions on @xmath0pb , respectively .",
    "this provides then a simple scheme to estimate the charged - current cross sections for the other lead and iron isotopes .",
    "both the land and the omnis detectors will also be capable of detecting the neutron energy spectrum following the decay of states in the daughter nucleus after excitation by charged- and neutral - current neutrino reactions .",
    "we have calculated the relevant neutron energy spectra for both possible detector materials , @xmath1fe and @xmath0pb . to this end",
    "we have used the statistical model code smoker iteratively by following the decay of the daughter states after the first particle decay .",
    "we have kept book of the neutron energies produced in these ( sequential ) decays and have binned them in 500-kev bins .",

    "the calculations have been performed for different neutrino spectra which also allows one to study the potential sensitivity of the detectors if neutrino oscillations occur .    for the charged- and neutral - current reactions on @xmath1fe",
    "the response is mainly below the 2n - threshold .",
    "most of the gamow - teller distribution is below the neutron - threshold , as is the ias in the charged - current reaction .",

    "the calculation has been performed for different supernova neutrino spectra characterized by the parameters ( t,@xmath34 ) .",
    "note that the cross sections for ( t,@xmath34)=(4,0 ) and ( 3,3 ) neutrinos have been scaled by factors 20 and 40 , respectively.,height=340 ]    the spectrum is rather structureless with a broad peak centred around neutron energies @xmath128 mev and basically reflects the gt@xmath15 distribution above the neutron threshold of 10.08 mev .",
    "the respective neutron spectrum for the neutral current reaction is shown in fig .",
    "reaction on @xmath1fe .",
    "the calculation has been performed for different supernova neutrino spectra characterized by the parameters ( t,@xmath34).,height=340 ]    the spectrum is composed by several ( mainly first - forbidden ) transitions which combined lead to a rather smooth neutron energy distribution .",
    "we note that the gt distribution is taken from the shell model calculation and leads to a rather broad neutron spectrum .",
    "the neutron spectrum for the charged current reaction on @xmath0pb is dominated by the fermi transition to the ias and by the gt@xmath15 transitions . to understand the neutron spectrum we have to consider the neutron threshold energies for one - neutron decay ( 6.9 mev ) and for two - neutron decay ( 14.98 mev ) in @xmath0bi .",
    "hence the ias and the collective gt resonance ( with an excitation energy of about 16 mev ) will decay dominantly by 2n emission , while the low - lying gt@xmath15 resonance at @xmath129 mev decays by the emission of one neutron .",
    "this has significant consequences for the neutron spectrum . in the 2-neutron decay",
    "the available energy is shared between the two emitted particles , leading to a rather broad and structureless neutron energy distribution . as can be seen in fig .",

    "we note that the relative height of the peak compared with the broad structure stemming from the 2n - emission is more pronounced for the ( t,@xmath34)=(4,0 ) neutrino distribution than for a potential ( t,@xmath34)=(8,0 ) @xmath25 spectrum as it might arise after complete @xmath131 oscillations .",
    "7 shows the neutron energy spectrum for the neutral - current reactions on @xmath0pb .    )",
    "reaction on @xmath0pb .",
    "the calculation has been performed for different supernova neutrino spectra characterized by the parameters ( t,@xmath34).,height=340 ]    our rpa response places the strong gt transitions around the neutron threshold ( at 7.37 mev ) , while the first - forbidden transitions are split into several transitions between the excitation energies 9 mev and 18 mev . in particular , the two strong @xmath41 resonances at around 15 mev and 18 mev are above the 2-neutron threshold at 14.12  mev and their decay leads , for the same reasons as given above for the charged - current reaction , two a rather broad neutron energy spectrum .",
    "several transitions above the one - neutron threshold superimpose in our rpa neutron spectrum this broad structure and lead to rather pronounced peaks .",
    "but nucleon - nucleon correlations beyond the rpa will induce a stronger fragmentation which will smear out these peaks .",
    "we expect therefore that the neutral - current neutron energy spectrum will be rather broad and structureless .",
    "an exciting question is whether supernova neutrino detectors have the ability to detect neutrino oscillations .",
    "this can be achieved by a suited signal which allows to distinguish between charged - current and neutral - current events and which is quite sensitive to the neutrino distribution .",
    "it is hoped for that the detectors omnis and land have such an ability . however , as has been shown in @xcite , the total neutron counting rate is by itself not a suited mean to detect neutrino oscillations , even if results from various detectors with different material ( hence different ratios of charged - to - neutral current cross sections , as discussed above ) are combined . in ref . @xcite it is pointed out that in the case of @xmath0pb an attractive signal might emerge . due to the fact that the ias and large portions of the gt@xmath15 strength resides in @xmath0bi just above the 2-neutron emission threshold , fuller _ et al . _",
    "discuss that the 2-neutron emission rate is both , flavor - specific and very sensitive to the temperature of the @xmath25 distribution . to quantify this argument",
    "we have calculated the cross sections for the @xmath0pb(@xmath132)@xmath122bi reaction in our combined model of rpa for the neutrino - induced response and statistical model for the decay of the daughter states .",
    "we find the partial cross sections of @xmath133 @xmath59 and @xmath134 @xmath59 for @xmath25 neutrinos with ( t,@xmath34)=(4,0 ) and ( 3,3 ) fermi - dirac distributions . as pointed out in @xcite these cross sections increase significantly if neutrino oscillations occur .",
    "for example , we find for total @xmath135 oscillations partial 2n cross sections of @xmath136 @xmath59 and @xmath137 @xmath59 ( for neutrino distributions with parameters ( t,@xmath34)= ( 8,0 ) and ( 6.26,3 ) , respectively ) .",
    "we remark that these numbers will probably be reduced , if correlations beyond the rpa are taken into account , as part of the gt@xmath15 distribution might be shifted below the 2n - threshold .    as pointed out above , also portions of the neutral - current excitation spectrum",
    "are above the respective 2n - emission threshold",
    ". this decay will compete with the one stemming from the charged - current reaction and hence will reduce the flavor - sensitivity of the signal .",
    "we have therefore also calculated the @xmath0pb(@xmath138)@xmath122pb cross sections and find @xmath139 @xmath59 and @xmath140 @xmath59 ( for neutrino distributions with ( t,@xmath34)= ( 8,0 ) and ( 6.26,3 ) , respectively and averaged over neutrinos and antineutrinos ) .",
    "thus , if no neutrino oscillations occur the combined 2n - signal resulting from neutral - current reactions for the 4 @xmath5 neutrino types is larger than the one from the charged - current reactions .",
    "however , if neutrino oscillations occur the neutral - current signal is unaffected while the charged - current signal is drastically enhanced .",
    "thus , our calculations support the suggestions of ref .",
    "@xcite that the 2n - signal for @xmath0pb detectors might be an interesting neutrino oscillation signal .",
    "however , our calculations also indicate that , for an analysis of the potential observation of the signal , 2-neutron emission from neutral - current events have to be accounted for as well .    finally , as the predicted energy spectra of neutrinos from supernovae change with time and",
    "furthermore can be affected in a variety of ways ( especially oscillation scenarios ) , table  6 lists the cross sections for ( @xmath2)- and ( @xmath141)-scattering on @xmath1fe and @xmath0pb as a function of neutrino energy .",
    "we have studied the charged- and neutral current reactions on @xmath1fe and @xmath0pb which are the shielding materials for current accelerator - based neutrino experiments like lsnd and karmen and the material for proposed supernova neutrino detectors like land and omnis .",
    "our calculations for @xmath1fe are performed within a model which uses the interacting shell model to determine the gamow - teller response and the rpa for forbidden transitions . for @xmath0pb",
    "the complete nuclear response is evaluated within the rpa model .",
    "the correct momentum - dependence of the various multipole - operators is considered .",
    "this leads to a reduction of the cross sections , compared to calculations performed at @xmath23 due to destructive interference with ` higher - order ' multipole operators .",
    "at first we have calculated the total cross sections and the partial cross sections for spallating a neutron from the target for muon - decay - at - rest neutrinos .",
    "additionally we have evaluated the charged - current cross section on @xmath0pb as a function of final lepton energy .",
    "all these quantities are expected to allow for ( even ) more reliable background simulations for the lsnd and karmen detectors .",
    "as the lsnd collaboration might have observed a neutrino - oscillation signal we have also calculated the various cross sections on @xmath1fe and @xmath0pb for pion - in - flight - decay neutrinos as they comprise a small admixture of @xmath3 neutrinos in the lsnd beam .",
    "detecting supernova neutrinos is generally considered an important test of theoretical models for core - collapse supernovae .",
    "omnis and land are two proposed detectors , consisting of lead and possibly iron , which will have the capability to count the total rate of neutrons produced by neutrino reactions in the detector and further to detect the related neutron energy spectrum .",
    "for @xmath1fe the decay is mainly by emission of one neutron .",
    "nevertheless the neutron energy spectrum is rather broad and structureless following both charged- and neutral - current excitations .",
    "for @xmath0pb the situation is different as a significant portion of the charged - current response ( and also of the neutral - current response ) is above the 2n - threshold .",
    "as the two neutrons share the available decay energy this leads to a rather broad neutron spectrum . for the charged - current reaction we predict that this broad pattern is superimposed by a peak structure , due to a yet unobserved gamow - teller transition at lower energies .",
    "we find that the height of this peak relative to the broad structure is more pronounced for ` ordinary ' @xmath25 supernova neutrinos than for a @xmath25 neutrino spectrum arising after @xmath82 oscillations .",
    "another possible oscillation signal for a @xmath0pb detector is the emission rate of 2 neutrons , as suggested by fuller , haxton and mclaughlin .",
    "we have quantitatively confirmed the argument of these authors and have also calculated the 2-neutron emission rate for the neutral - current reaction which has to be considered if , in the event of a nearby supernova , the 2-neutron emission signal would be observed and analyzed for oscillation information .          neutrino reaction & cross section + ( @xmath142 ) & 1.25 ( 2 ) + ( @xmath2n ) & 3.33 ( 1 ) + ( @xmath2p ) & 7.83 ( 1 ) + ( @xmath143 ) & 3.52 ( 0 ) + ( @xmath2)x & 2.40 ( 2 ) + ( @xmath142 ) & 3.24 ( 2 ) + ( @xmath2n ) & 3.29 ( 3 ) + ( @xmath2p ) & 4.77 ( -1 ) + ( @xmath143 ) & 1.01 ( 0 ) + ( @xmath2)x & 3.62 ( 3 ) +          neutrino reaction & cross section + ( @xmath144 ) & 2.24 ( 2 ) + ( @xmath76n ) & 6.62 ( 2 ) + ( @xmath76p ) & 1.33 ( 3 ) + ( @xmath145 ) & 2.23 ( 2 ) + ( @xmath76)x & 2.44 ( 3 ) + ( @xmath144 ) & 1.23 ( 3 ) + ( @xmath76n ) & 1.02 ( 4 ) + ( @xmath76p ) & 2.89 ( 0 ) + ( @xmath145 ) & 3.31 ( 1 ) + ( @xmath76)x & 1.15 ( 4 ) +          neutrino reaction & cross section + ( @xmath142 ) & 5.80 ( 2 ) + ( @xmath2n ) & 1.91 ( 3 ) + ( @xmath2p ) & 3.84 ( 3 ) + ( @xmath143 ) & 6.48 ( 2 ) + ( @xmath2)x & 6.98 ( 3 ) + ( @xmath142 ) & 2.75 ( 3 ) + ( @xmath2n ) & 3.49 ( 4 ) + ( @xmath2p ) & 1.00 ( 1 ) + ( @xmath143 ) & 1.12 ( 2 ) + ( @xmath2)x & 3.78 ( 4 ) +           ( @xmath146 ) & ( 4,0 ) & ( 6,0 ) & ( 8,0 ) & ( 10,0 ) & ( 3,3 ) & ( 4,3 ) & ( 6.26,3 ) + ( @xmath147 ) & 2.9 ( 0 ) & 9.3 ( 0 ) & 1.9 ( 1 ) & 3.0 ( 1 ) & 1.9 ( 0 ) & 5.0 ( 0 ) & 1.7 ( 1 ) + ( @xmath148n ) & 7.1 ( -1 ) & 5.9 ( 0 ) & 2.1 ( 1 ) & 4.9 ( 1 ) & 2.3 ( -1 ) & 1.3 ( 0 ) & 1.3 ( 1 ) + ( @xmath148p ) & 5.6 ( -2 ) & 6.8 ( -1 ) & 3.1 ( 0 ) & 8.7 ( 0 ) & 1.3 ( -2 ) & 1.1 ( -1 ) & 1.6 ( 0 ) + ( @xmath149 ) & 9.4 ( -3 ) & 1.2 ( -1 ) & 5.5 ( -1 ) & 1.6 ( 0 ) & 2.1 ( -3 ) & 1.8 ( -2 ) & 2.8 ( -1 ) + ( @xmath148)x & 3.7 ( 0 ) & 1.6 ( 1 ) & 4.3 ( 1 ) & 9.0 ( 1 ) & 2.1 ( 0 ) & 6.4 ( 0 ) & 3.2 ( 1 ) + ( @xmath147 ) & 3.6 ( 0 ) & 1.2 ( 1 ) & 2.7 ( 1 ) & 4.8 ( 1 ) & 2.4 ( 0 ) & 6.1 ( 0 ) & 2.2 ( 1 ) + ( @xmath148n ) & 1.1 ( 1 ) & 5.0 ( 1 ) & 1.4 ( 2 ) & 2.8 ( 2 ) & 5.8 ( 0 ) & 1.9 ( 1 ) & 1.0 ( 2 ) + ( @xmath148p ) & 2.3 ( -5 ) & 5.3 ( -4 ) & 3.8 ( -3 ) & 1.5 ( -2 ) & 4.0 ( -6 ) & 4.4 ( -5 ) & 1.4 ( -3 ) + ( @xmath149 ) & 1.2 ( -4 ) & 4.7 ( -3 ) & 4.7 ( -2 ) & 2.3 ( -1 ) & 1.2 ( -5 ) & 2.2 ( -4 ) & 1.3 ( -2 ) + ( @xmath148)x & 1.4 ( 1 ) & 6.2 ( 1 ) & 1.6 ( 2 ) & 3.3 ( 2 ) & 8.1 ( 0 ) & 2.5 ( 1 ) & 1.2 ( 2 ) +           ( @xmath146 ) & ( 4,0 ) & ( 6,0 ) & ( 8,0 ) & ( 10,0 ) & ( 3,3 ) & ( 4,3 ) & ( 6.26,3 ) + ( @xmath142 ) & 9.8 ( 0 ) & 3.2 ( 1 ) & 6.4 ( 1 ) & 1.0 ( 2 ) & 6.5 ( 0 ) & 1.7 ( 1 ) & 5.9 ( 1 ) + ( @xmath2n ) & 7.5 ( -1 ) & 8.2 ( 0 ) & 3.3 ( 1 ) & 8.1 ( 1 ) & 1.9 ( -1 ) & 1.5 ( 0 ) & 2.0 ( 1 ) + ( @xmath2p ) & 5.4 ( 0 ) & 3.3 ( 1 ) & 1.0 ( 2 ) & 2.2 ( 2 ) & 2.2 ( 0 ) & 1.0 ( 1 ) & 7.3 ( 1 ) + ( @xmath143 ) & 6.1 ( -2 ) & 9.8 ( -1 ) & 4.9 ( 0 ) & 1.4 ( 1 ) & 9.9 ( -3 ) & 1.2 ( -1 ) & 2.5 ( 0 ) + ( @xmath2)x & 1.6 ( 1 ) & 7.4 ( 1 ) & 2.0 ( 2 ) & 4.1 ( 2 ) & 8.9 ( 0 ) & 2.9 ( 1 ) & 1.5 ( 2 ) + ( @xmath142 ) & 4.7 ( 1 ) & 1.3 ( 2 ) & 2.5 ( 2 ) & 4.0 ( 2 ) & 3.5 ( 1 ) & 7.6 ( 1 ) & 2.2 ( 2 ) + ( @xmath2n ) & 2.3 ( 2 ) & 9.9 ( 2 ) & 2.3 ( 3 ) & 4.0 ( 3 ) & 1.2 ( 2 ) & 4.2 ( 2 ) & 1.9 ( 3 ) + ( @xmath2p ) & 1.8 ( -2 ) & 1.1 ( -1 ) & 3.3 ( -1 ) & 6.9 ( -1 ) & 7.2 ( -3 ) & 3.3 ( -2 ) & 2.3 ( -1 ) + ( @xmath143 ) & 2.1 ( -2 ) & 2.6 ( -1 ) & 1.1 ( 0 ) & 3.0 ( 0 ) & 4.7 ( -3 ) & 4.1 ( -2 ) & 6.0 ( -1 ) + ( @xmath2)x & 2.8 ( 2 ) & 1.1 ( 3 ) & 2.5 ( 3 ) & 4.5 ( 3 ) & 1.6 ( 2 ) & 4.9 ( 2 ) & 2.1 ( 3 ) + ( @xmath150 ) & 3.4 ( 0 ) & 1.1 ( 1 ) & 2.2 ( 1 ) & 3.6 ( 1 ) & 2.3 ( 0 ) & 5.7 ( 0 ) & 1.9 ( 1 ) + ( @xmath151n ) & 5.0 ( -1 ) & 4.5 ( 0 ) & 1.7 ( 1 ) & 4.2 ( 1 ) & 1.5 ( -1 ) & 9.4 ( -1 ) & 1.0 ( 1 ) + ( @xmath151p ) & 4.3 ( -3 ) & 5.5 ( -2 ) & 2.7 ( -1 ) & 8.4 ( -1 ) & 9.3 ( -4 ) & 8.1 ( -3 ) & 1.3 ( -1 ) + ( @xmath152 ) & 6.7 ( -4 ) & 1.1 ( -2 ) & 6.7 ( -2 ) & 2.3 ( -1 ) & 1.2 ( -4 ) & 1.3 ( -3 ) & 2.8 ( -2 ) + ( @xmath151)x & 3.9 ( 0 ) & 1.5 ( 1 ) & 3.9 ( 1 ) & 7.9 ( 1 ) & 2.4 ( 0 ) & 6.6 ( 0 ) & 2.9 ( 1 ) + ( @xmath150 ) & 5.8 ( -1 ) & 3.0 ( 0 ) & 7.9 ( 0 ) & 1.5 ( 1 ) & 2.7 ( -1 ) & 1.1 ( 0 ) & 6.1 ( 0 ) + ( @xmath151n ) & 4.9 ( -1 ) & 3.8 ( 0 ) & 1.5 ( 1 ) & 3.9 ( 1 ) & 2.0 ( -1 ) & 8.9 ( -1 ) & 8.5 ( 0 ) + ( @xmath151p ) & 1.7 ( -7 ) & 1.4 ( -5 ) & 2.2 ( -4 ) & 1.5 ( -3 ) & 8.4 ( -9 ) & 3.2 ( -7 ) & 4.2 ( -5 ) + ( @xmath152 ) & 4.3 ( -7 ) & 4.0 ( -5 ) & 6.5 ( -4 ) & 4.4 ( -3 ) & 2.1 ( -8 ) & 8.1 ( -7 ) & 1.2 ( -4 ) + ( @xmath151)x & 1.1 ( 0 ) & 6.8 ( 0 ) & 2.3 ( 1 ) & 5.4 ( 1 ) & 4.7 ( -1 ) & 1.9 ( 0 ) & 1.5 ( 1 ) +    .total @xmath1fe(@xmath2)x , @xmath1fe(@xmath141)x , @xmath0pb(@xmath2)x and @xmath0pb(@xmath141)x cross sections for selected neutrino energies @xmath38 .",
