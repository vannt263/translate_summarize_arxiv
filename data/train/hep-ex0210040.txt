    "instead , we note that the @xmath116 and @xmath155 modes are the ones with the most extreme @xmath105 distributions ( the largest mean and the smallest ) . these distributions are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ddstlnu ] .",
    "we therefore repeat the analysis , first using only @xmath156 to describe our @xmath118 decays and then using only @xmath155 to describe these decays ; we take the larger of the two excursions as our systematic error .",
    "we have fit the @xmath6 distribution of @xmath24 decays for the slope of the form factor and @xmath11 . for the combined @xmath81 and @xmath82 fit ,",
    "we find @xmath157 including the systematic uncertainties we compute a correlation coefficient @xmath158 . figure  [ fig : ellipse ] shows the total error ellipse for this measurement .",
    "the best - fit parameters imply the decay rate @xmath159    we recover the branching fractions from the rate by dividing by the appropriate @xmath8-meson lifetimes .",
    "these results are sensitive only to the ratio of @xmath151 to @xmath150 lifetimes .",
    "they are @xmath160 where the errors are completely correlated .",
    "a recent lattice calculation yields  @xcite @xmath161 after applying a qed correction of @xmath162 .",
    "this value is consistent with @xmath163 , the evaluation of the authors of ref .  , but is more precise . using the lattice value of @xmath12",
    ", our result implies @xmath164 since full radiative corrections have yet to be calculated for @xmath12 , it is ambiguous how best to treat radiative decays in the analysis .",
    "we include radiative decays in our signal .",
    "this value of @xmath1 is consistent with previous values obtained from @xmath33 decays @xcite , but is somewhat higher .",
    "however , we note our ability to reconstruct @xmath105 makes our analysis approximately four times less sensitive to the poorly known @xmath118 background , and furthermore allows us to constrain it with the data .",
    "this value of @xmath1 is also somewhat higher than that obtained using inclusive semileptonic @xmath8 decays  @xcite .",
    "if confirmed , this discrepancy could signal a violation of quark - hadron duality . a larger value of @xmath1 shifts constraints on the ckm unitarity triangle from @xmath165 and @xmath0 violation in the neutral kaon system , somewhat reducing expectations for indirect @xmath0 violation in the @xmath8 system .",
