    "so far , there is no evidence for either cp violation or particle - antiparticle mixing in the charm - quark sector .",
    "this is as expected in the context of the standard model of particle physics .",
    "predictions for cp violation and particle - antiparticle mixing are orders of magnitude below the sensitivities of current experiments .",
    "this remains true even though today s experiments are part of the march toward standard - model sensitivities , a march which has seen a couple of orders of magnitude increase in sensitivity in each of the last two decades .",
    "what would be really exciting is the observation of cp violation or particle - antiparticle mixing in current charm experiments .",
    "the standard - model predictions which explain these effects for strange and bottom quarks typically predict ( so far ) unmeasurable effects for charm . in that case ,",
    "experimental charm signatures have no standard - model background , no relevant hadronic uncertainty in background estimates .",
    "any sighting of cp violation or mixing in the charm sector would be evidence of new physics .",
    "since no such sighting has been made , we must settle , for now , simply to use the current experimental efforts as guides to future possibilities .",
    "how can we best pursue the search for cp violation and particle - antiparticle mixing ?",
    "today s results come from four sources of charm particles : @xmath0 experiments in the upsilon region ( cleo ii.v at cesr ) and at the @xmath1 ( aleph at lep ) , photoproduction ( focus / e831 at fermilab ) , and hadroproduction ( e791 at fermilab ) . from the next generation of experiments",
    ", we may hope for a continuation of increased sensitivity - though in a more limited set of experimental environments .      while the charm - physics sector has no measurable standard model mixing or cp violation ,",
    "it is unique in much more interesting ways than simply having no standard - model backgrounds .",
    "it is the only opportunity to see new - physics coupling to the up - type - quark sector . in the case of the up quarks themselves , there is a lack of sufficient particle lifetime and richness in decay channels for cp violation or particle - antiparticle mixing to be manifest . as for the top quark , it does nt live long enough to be included in particles which can mix or can have the final state interactions needed to see cp violation .",
    "the smallness of the standard - model diagrams gives insight into the uniqueness of the charm sector .",
    "possible contributions from box , penguin , and long distance effects are usually all about same order.@xcite even when long distance effects are thought to be larger than perturbative standard - model effects , the predictions are still many orders of magnitude from present limits.@xcite any of a long list of non - standard - model sources could produce measurable mixing or cp violation in charm.@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite these include leptoquarks , susy particles , fourth - generation quarks , left - right symmetric particles , and higgs particles .",
    "particle - antiparticle mixing can occur only for neutral particles , such as the @xmath2 .",
    "three types of measurements have been made : those using hadronic decays , those using semileptonic decays , and those where comparisons are made in the decay rates to various mixtures of cp eigenstates . in the first two of these , one needs to know the nature of the @xmath3 meson when it is born , i.e. , produced .",
    "such mesons are referred to as tagged ( as to particle - antiparticle nature at birth ) .",
    "we also need the nature of the particle at the time of its decay , typically given by one or more of the decay particles . in the case of lifetime comparisons",
    ", one may use untagged mesons , and gain the increase in efficiency implied .    universally ,",
    "tagging of @xmath2 s is done by examining only those @xmath2 s which are the decay products of charged @xmath4s . in this case",
    ", the strong decay of the @xmath5 gives the nature of the charm quark in the @xmath2 , since it is the same as that in the @xmath6 , and is marked by the @xmath6 charge and that of the daughter charged pion .",
    "clearly , using only such @xmath2 s reduces the size of the @xmath2-sample available for study .",
    "fortunately , the production of @xmath4s is frequent in charm events , and the @xmath7 decay is both copious and easy to observe .    to date",
    ", the observed decays used in mixing studies are : + hadronic decays : @xmath8 and @xmath9 + semileptonic decays : @xmath10 and @xmath11 + lifetime differences : @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 .",
    "comparison of decay rates can be made between the cp eigenstates , or to the mixed state @xmath15 .      in hadronic decays , it is possible to reach the final state which would come from mixing by doubly - cabibbo - suppressed decay .",
    "such doubly - cabibbo - suppressed decays are expected at about the level of today s limits on mixing .",
    "thus , the analyses must take these decays into account .",
    "the methods used involve a maximum - likelihood fit to a sample of events which have the characteristic charge correlations for mixing . the fit function for the signal includes the signature for the @xmath2 decay ( a gaussian - function distribution for the effective mass of the @xmath2 decay products , @xmath16 ) , the signature for the tagging @xmath17 decay ( a gaussian - function distribution in the mass difference in the @xmath17 decay , @xmath18 ) , and the separate proper - time distributions for probabilities coming from mixing , from the doubly - cabibbo - suppressed mechanism , and from the interference of mixing and doubly - cabibbo - suppressed amplitudes .",
    "the proper time of decays is needed to separate origins in mixing from double - cabibbo - suppression .",
    "the backgrounds , @xmath19 , are also parameterized in terms of the same variables as used for the signal .",
    "expressions for the terms in the maximum - likelihood function are given in eqns .",
    "[ maxlike ] to [ where4 ] .",
    "@xmath20 where , for the signal part : @xmath21 \\label{where1}\\ ] ] @xmath22 @xmath23 @xmath24 and the detection efficiency , @xmath25 , may be a function of the proper time .",
    "we are now entering the time when the interference term may provide the greatest sensitivity to mixing , since the square of the limit on the mixing amplitude is now smaller than the visible doubly - cabibbo - suppressed rate .",
    "of course , such sensitivity depends on the phase between the cabibbo - favored and doubly - cabibbo - suppressed amplitudes .",
    "yesterday s background may be tomorrow s signal enhancer !",
    "the recent mixing results are shown in table [ extab1 ] .",
    "the earliest of these comes from the full data set of fermilab s e791 charm hadroproduction experiment.@xcite these results are final , and published .",
    "distributions are shown for the e791 hadronic - decay study@xcite in fig .",
    "[ e791-fig ] .",
    "the figure gives an indication of the kind of distributions which enter the maximum - likelihood fits using eqns .",
    "[ maxlike ] to [ where4 ] .",
    "the aleph data comes from the full @xmath1 data from 1991 - 1995 running at lep , and have also been published.@xcite the cleo ii.v preliminary result,@xcite@xcite@xcite which comes from the data shown in fig .",
    "[ cleo - fig ] , is also from their full data set of @xmath26 .",
    "the first results from fermilab s photoproduction experiment , focus / e831 , are expected soon,@xcite    the cleo result is the most constraining , at the level of 0.05 @xmath27 , coming from the fact that the wrong - sign events ( those characteristic of mixing and of doubly - cabibbo - suppressed decays ) appear at short proper decay - time .",
    "the short lifetime of these events strongly rejects large constructive interference between mixing and dcsd .",
    "as seen in table [ extab1 ] , some earlier mixing analyses assumed no cp violation ; and there are results quoted with the interference term arbitrarily set to zero .",
    "the more general fits , allowing the most general solution , typically result in looser quoted constraints on mixing .",
    "the excellent cleo acceptance at short proper - lifetime relative to that at fixed - target experiments also makes the cleo result less sensitive to the generality of the fit used .",
    "semileptonic decays have the advantage that there is no doubly - cabibbo - suppressed decay to obscure a mixing interpretation .",
    "tagging of the initial state is still required , of course .",
    "while the e791 results@xcite are available and listed in table [ extab1 ] , only the promise of the focus / e831 data set is known.@xcite they project a 90% cl upper limit of 0.1% after combining their electron and muon mode data , and assuming that `` they observe precisely zero background - subtracted events in their wrong sign signal region.''@xcite we anxiously await the result of their full data set .",
    "mixing can appear if there is either a difference in the masses of the cp eigenstates @xmath28 or if there is a difference in the decay rates @xmath29 ( eqn .",

    "we have seen excellent signal to ( well understood ) backgrounds in today s charm decay experiments .",
    "this has led to real improvements in sensitivity to new physics .",
    "the progress has been the result of precision reconstruction of production and decay vertices , excellent kinematic resolution , and increasingly large data samples .",
    "some of this has come from dedicated charm experiments ; other progress is the byproduct of b - motivated experiments .",
    "since we may have seen the last of dedicated charm experiments [ can we hope still for a t - charm factory ? ] , we need to understand what may be expected from future b - motivated experiments .    there is the potential for @xmath45 reconstructed charm decays from b factories ( and compass ) ; also the potential for @xmath46 from btev ( and lhc - b ? ) .",
    "even though hadron environments may be harder , the production rate , coupled to capable detectors , can win in the end .",
    "this has been shown by e791 .",
    "however , triggers will have to allow / encourage charm data to be taken !",
    "as it is , charm events may be the worst enemy of b - experiment triggers .",
    "often , b experiments actively try to minimize the charm events recorded .",
    "charm experiments have reached the level of @xmath47 reconstructed meson decays .",
    "focus holds the record in this regard today .",
    "so far , there is no evidence for either mixing or cp violation in the charm sector .",
    "the march toward increasing numbers of well - reconstructed decays with well - understood backgrounds has led to decades of increased sensitivity over the last years .",
    "there is hope for continued progress in this direction .",
    "however , this hope depends mostly on results coming as a side benefit from the major b efforts coming on line , especially those whose on - line event selection allows charm data to be taken .",
