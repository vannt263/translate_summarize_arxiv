    "if storm et al . had used @xmath24 instead of @xmath25 as predicted by the irsb @xmath3-factor law for cepheids of @xmath26days , the irsb distance modulus of ngc 1866 would become 18.14mag , which is clearly unreasonably short , and @xmath27mag shorter than the cors mean distance for these five variables . on the other hand , the cors distance modulus to ngc",

    "it is important to stress that the only version of the bw method which has used lmc cepheids as a constraint for the calibration ( demanding that lmc cepheid distances must be independent of their periods ) is the irsb technique as calibrated by * ? ? ? * , which places additional weight on this particular bw method .",
    "the most important current systematic uncertainty affecting any version of the bw method is which @xmath3-factor law to adopt . recently ,",
    "* ngeow et al . ( 2012 ) ) used revised _ hipparcos _ parallaxes ( 9 cepheids ) and zams - fitting distances ( 16 cluster cepheids ) for a sample of 25 mw cepheids in common with ( * ? ? ?",
    "* storm et al .",
    "( 2011a ) ) to derive their individual @xmath3-factor values by requiring that the independent distances should agree with the irsb distance determination .",
    "this work fully confirmed the steep @xmath3-factor law of storm et al . a very recent study by ( * ? ? ? * groenewegen ( 2013 ) ) using mw and lmc cepheids also confirms the steep storm et al .",
    "@xmath3-factor law , resulting in an even steeper dependence of @xmath3 on the pulsation period .",
    "this makes it very likely that the conclusions about the universality of the cepheid pl relation reached by storm et al .",
    "are correct .",
    "how is it then possible that other bw - method implementations ( perhaps except the latest implementation of the cors method ) using different @xmath3-factor laws quite frequently produce distances to individual cepheids that are consistent with the irsb determination ?",
    "the answer seems to be , at least in part , that different implementations of the bw method require different @xmath3-factor laws .",
    "this , in turn , tells us that there is physics hidden in the @xmath3 factor which is not yet fully understood or taken into account in the theoretical modeling of cepheid atmospheres",
    ". this may be the reason why these models currently predict a relatively shallow dependence of @xmath3 on period , in contrast to the irsb results ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* nardetto et al . 2009 ) ; also this volume ) .",
    "it is also possible ( likely ) that the @xmath3-factor relation for classical cepheids exhibits an intrinsic dispersion .",
    "it seems to be independent , however , of the metallicity ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* nardetto et al . 2011 ) ) .",
    "future precision measurements of the @xmath3 factors of cepheids , particularly of short - period cepheids , will be very important .",
    "there is hope that direct interferometric angular - diameter measurements ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* mrand et al . 2005 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* gallenne et al . 2012 ) ) will improve sufficiently to meet that goal .",
    "an interesting alternative is the analysis of cepheids in eclipsing binaries , allowing an accurate distance determination based on application of the binary method ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* pietrzynski et al . 2009 , 2010 , 2011 ) ) , which promises to yield accurate @xmath3-factor measurements for these binary cepheids .",
    "another possibly important source of systematic uncertainties in bw distances derived from infrared photometry is the recent detection of circumstellar shells around cepheids ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* kervella et al . 2006 ; mrand et al . 2006 , 2007 ; gallenne et al . 2011 ) ) .",
    "the effect on the flux in the @xmath5 band is 14% for the ( few ) cepheids which have been studied in this context so far , which may affect ( reduce ) the irsb distances by up to 4% .",
    "it has yet to be seen how ubiquitous such shells are in order to assess more reliably their possible effect on bw distance determinations .",
    "if there are few cepheids with strong flux contributions from circumstellar shells , these stars could be omitted from samples used for calibration or distance determination , similarly to binary cepheids which are known members of systems hosting relatively bright companion stars .",
    "currently , bw distance determinations based on a variety of different implementations of the method reach statistical uncertainties of 12% for cepheids using excellent existing data sets .",
    "the systematic uncertainties affecting these distances limit current bw distances to individual cepheids to approximately 6% accuracy .",
    "there is room for improvement over the next few years along the lines discussed here .",
    "theoretical models still seem to miss important physics and must be improved to produce predictions which can be reconciled with observational facts .",
