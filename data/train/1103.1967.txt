    "one - dimensional and two - leg ferrimagnets the magnetization plateaus can be understood in terms of the oshikawa , yamanaka and affleck ( oya ) argument @xcite because the longitudinal magnetic field commutes with the rest of the hamiltonian and the models have u(1 ) symmetry .",
    "however , the situation is different when a transverse magnetic field is applied on the system , because the transverse field does not commute with the xxz interaction and breaks the u(1 ) symmetry of the model .",
    "the onset of a transverse field develops an energy gap in a spin-1/2 chain which initiates an antiferromagnetic order perpendicular to the field direction @xcite .",

    "the lack of u(1 ) symmetry prohibits the use of the oya argument , thus prompts the question of a magnetization plateau and the presence of an energy gap @xcite in the spectrum .",
