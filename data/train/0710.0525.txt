    "there exists `` lore '' that convinces us that physics beyond standard model ( sm ) should be guided from the stabilization of mass hierarchy .",
    "the most ubiquitous example is the minimal low energy effective supersymmetric theory ( mssm )  @xcite , which requires a scale of supersymmetry ( susy ) breaking @xmath4  tev to avoid the fine tuning problem ( @xmath5 ) with the higgs mass ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "however , this `` naturalness '' is not favored by prescision tests at colliders , which are consistent with sm to a great accuracy  @xcite .",
    "consequently , any new physics which may turn on beyond the electroweak scale needs to be fine tuned at the percent level .",
    "moreover , the presence  @xcite of a tiny , but non - vanishing , cosmological constant presents us with a fine tuning problem much more severe than the gauge hierarchy problem .",
    "the solution of last resort to address the cosmological constant problem is weinberg s anthropic approach  @xcite , in which there exists an enormous `` landscape '' of vacua , only a small fraction of which have a vacuum energy small enough to allow for a natural habitat for observers such as ourselves .",
    "this approach has been recently rekindled by investigations in string theory which have applied a statistical analysis to the large number @xmath7 of vacua in the theory  @xcite . among this vast number of metastable vacua",
    ", there can be a small subset @xmath8 exhibiting low scale susy breaking .",
    "of course the fine tuning required to achieve a small cosmological constant implies the need of a huge number of vacua , far more than the @xmath8 characterizing low - scale susy breaking .",
    "however , the density of vacua increases @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "therefore , assigning _ a priori _ equal probability to each vacuum one arrives at a new meassure of fine tuning , which takes into account the `` entropy '' associated with the density of vacua , @xmath10 contrary to @xmath11 requirements , @xmath12 clearly favors a large susy breaking scale .",
    "for example , for @xmath13 , @xmath14 vacua become available , enough to fine tune both the cosmological constant and the higgs mass .",
    "if we live in this neighborhood of the landscape , collider data would be expected to point to the sm rather than susy . however , one pays a price for throwing away mssm , since it provides a potential explanation for both dark matter  @xcite and the lep results favoring the unification of the three sm gauge couplings  @xcite .",
    "split susy  @xcite is a relatively new variant of susy which may facilitate the required fine tuning and simultaneously preserves the achievements of the mssm . in this model",
    "the bosonic superpartners are heavy , while the extra fermions retain tev - scale masses thanks to protection by chiral symmetry .",
    "although split susy does not provide a dynamical explanation for the hierarchy problem , the assumption of a large - scale susy breaking leads to important information on the underlying parameters and on measurable physical quantities  @xcite .",
    "in particular , analyses of one loop  @xcite and two loops  @xcite running of the rg equations , show that split susy preserves unification of couplings .",
    "additionally , as in the mssm , the lightest supersymmetric particle provides a possible candidate for cold dark matter  @xcite .",
    "it is clear that split susy opens new territory for model builders , gauginos have a symmetry that protects their masses , namely the @xmath0-symmetry , so building models where scalars are very massive is quite natural in theories where this symmetry is not broken , for example in @xmath15-term breaking models ; it can also happen in theories with extended supersymmetries and there are already several papers with string inspired models of split susy  @xcite . hence there is a strong motivation for phenomenological studies , including implications for collider - based measurements  @xcite , electric dipole moments  @xcite , higgs physics and electroweak symmetry breaking  @xcite , and cosmic ray physics  @xcite .",
    "the latter is the main focus of the present study .",
    "an intriguing prediction of split susy , which represents a radical departure from the mssm , is the longevity of the gluino .",
    "as mentioned above , in split susy the squarks are very massive and so gluino decay via virtual squarks becomes strongly suppressed , yielding a @xmath16 lifetime of the order of  @xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the gluino mass . quasi - stable colorless .",
    "( i.e. , carrying one unit of @xmath0-parity ) are expected to be born when such long - live gluinos become confined with quarks , anti - quarks , and gluons  @xcite .",
    "very strong limits on heavy isotope abundance in turn require the gluino to decay on gyr time scales  @xcite , leading to an upper bound for the scale of susy breaking @xmath19  gev .",
    "more restrictive bounds on @xmath20 can be determined from cosmological considerations  @xcite .",
    "specifically , gluino decays would disturb predictions of big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) , or distort the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , or alter the diffuse gamma ray background .",
    "the details depends on both , @xmath18 and @xmath21 .",
    "for example , for @xmath22 to avoid altering the abundances of d and @xmath23li , @xmath24  s , implying @xmath25  gev  @xcite .",
    "the relic abundance of lighter gluinos , @xmath26 , is constrained by cobe  @xcite , wmap  @xcite and egret observations  @xcite .",
    "on the one hand , gluinos that decay during or after the thermalization epoch can distort the cmb spectrum  @xcite and so are limited by cobe / wmap observations .",
    "on the other hand , gluinos that decay after the recombination epoch give rise to pions which subsequently decay into @xmath27-rays that free - stream to us .",
    "the contribution of such a decay chain to the diffuse @xmath27-ray background  @xcite is limited by egret observations .",
    "long - lived gluinos are also constrained by collider searches . charged .",
    "can be observed as they cross the detector either by their time delay relative to ultrarelativistic particles  @xcite , or by their anomalously high ionization energy loss  @xcite . besides the energy deposition of neutral . in the calorimeter",
    "is rather soft , and so when they are produced in association with a high-@xmath28 jet they can be observed in the monojet channel + missing energy @xmath29 : cdf run i data  @xcite found a bound of @xmath30  @xcite .",
    "in addition , . can become stopped gluinos by losing all of their momentum and coming to rest in the calorimeter  @xcite .",
    "the dcollaboration  @xcite has recently searched for stopped gluinos decaying into a single jet and a neutralino .",
    "the non - observation of monojets ( above the expected background from cosmic - muon induced showers ) in run ii data implies @xmath31 for @xmath32 all these limits are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] . as we will show here ,",
    "the study of hadronized gluinos originating in distant astrophysical sources , provide a viable experimental handle in the region @xmath33 - @xmath34 , which is yet unexplored .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to describe a full - blown monte carlo simulation of @xmath0 air showers , and uncover observables which may be exploited by new experiments like the pierre auger observatory  @xcite .",
    "this analysis expands on previous work  @xcite by including all possible @xmath0 interactions and analyzing in detail the potential of the surface array . before describing the simulation ,",
    "we introduce in the following section the main properties of . interactions",
    "the origin cosmic rays is still an open question , with the degree of uncertainty increasing with rising energy  @xcite .",
    "theoretically , one expects the cosmic ray spectrum to fall off somewhat above @xmath36 because the particle s energy gets degraded through interactions with the cosmic microwave ( protons and nuclei ) and radio ( photons ) backgrounds , a phenomenon known as the greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin ( gzk ) cutoff  @xcite .",
    "the most recent data from the pierre auger observatory in fact do not indicate ( yet ) any excess beyond the expected cutoff  @xcite . because of the rapid energy degradation , the maximum attainable energy in far away sources can be considerably higher than the gzk - threshold .",
    "however , measurements of the gev diffuse gamma ray flux significantly constrain the cosmic ray production integrated over redshift , and consequently limit the maximum energy of these particles . specifically , the intermediate state of the reaction @xmath37 is dominated by the @xmath38 resonance ( because the neutron decay length is smaller than the nucleon mean free path on the relic photons ) .",
    "hence , there is roughly an equal number of @xmath39 and @xmath40 gamma rays , produced via @xmath41 decay , subsequently cascade electromagnetically on the cosmic radiation fields through @xmath42 production followed by inverse compton scattering .",
    "the net result is a pile up of gamma rays at gev energies , just below the threshold for further pair production .",
    "therefore , if the distribution of cosmic ray sources is homogeneous and each source is characterized by a hard injection spectrum @xmath43 then egret measurements in the 100  mev - 100  gev region  @xcite limit the maximum proton energy @xmath44  @xcite .",
    "since fermi s acceleration mechanism predicts a rather steeper spectrum @xmath45  @xcite , one can assume a maximum proton energy @xmath46    gluinos are flavor singlets of a color @xmath47 octect that interact strongly with the octect of gluons and can combine with quarks , anti - quarks , and gluons to form colorless hadrons  @xcite .",
    "the bosonic states , @xmath48 are generically called @xmath0-baryons , whereas the fermionic sates , @xmath49 and @xmath50 are called @xmath0-mesons and @xmath0-glueballs , respectively .",
    "very little is certain about the spectroscopy of these strongly interacting particles .",
    "the most relevant feature is ( perhaps ) the difference in mass between @xmath0-mesons ( -glueballs ) and @xmath0-baryons , because if @xmath51 , then there are exothermic conversions of @xmath52 into @xmath53 as the .",
    "propagate in the atmosphere .    .",
    "states should be produced in pairs through @xmath1 collisions at powerful cosmic ray engines ( e.g. , protons undergoing acceleration in compact jets of relativistic plasma interact with those in the surrounding gas ) .",
    "the average energy of the produced @xmath0 in the target system is @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the energy of the proton undergoing acceleration at the source , @xmath56 is the average @xmath0 energy in the center - of - mass ( c.m . ) of the @xmath1 collision , and @xmath57 is the square of the energy in the c.m . of the parton - parton collision . now , by restricting @xmath0-production to large c.m .",

    "since these particles originate from cosmological distance @xmath60 , to reach the earth the gluinos must be remarkably long lived @xmath61 . moreover , to avoid deflections on the extra - galactic magnetic fields and the consequent energy loss due to pair production and other mechanisms ( such as synchrotron or bremsstrahlung radiation ) , the .",

    "the overall intensity of . is constrained by its accompanying pion flux , which decays into @xmath27-rays and neutrinos that can be confronted with existing data  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the expected flux of ultra - relativistic ( lorentz factors @xmath62 ) . is found to be very low ( less than 6 particles per km@xmath63 per millenium  @xcite ) , and so the only experimental method with potential is observation of their interactions in large volumes of the earth s atmosphere .    when a hadronized gluino impinges on a stationary nucleon of the earth atmosphere a large number ( over 140 when summed over all . ) of scattering proceses are possible  @xcite .",
    "interactions of @xmath0-meson states include : _",
    "( i ) _ @xmath64 processes , such as purely elastic , ( e.g. @xmath65 ) , charge exchange ( e.g. @xmath66 ) , and baryon exchange ( e.g. @xmath67 ) ; _ ( ii ) _",
    "@xmath68 processes including normal inelastic scattering ( e.g. @xmath69 ) and inelastic scattering with baryon exchange ( e.g. @xmath70 ) .",

    "interaction of @xmath0-baryon states include purely elastic , charged exchange , and normal inelastic scattering .",

    "furthermore , this process would be kinematically strongly disfavored .",
    "consequently , @xmath0-mesons can convert into @xmath0-baryons , but not vice versa .",
    "interactions of @xmath0-glueballs are expected to be similar to those of @xmath0-mesons .",
    "this is because a @xmath72 is able to split into a @xmath73 state , suggesting that a @xmath74 interacts like ( and mixes with ) @xmath75 states .    to establish which of these processes dominates , aside from a model describing the target ( neutron or proton )",
    ", the relative couplings of all the processes must be known .",
    "the latter requires the calculation of the clebsh - gordon coefficients of isospin - related processes , and the evaluation of all adittional dynamical effects for all processes . to parametrize our ignorance about qcd interactions , here",
    "we will consider all the relevant processes mentioned above ( 5 for @xmath0-mesons , and 3 for @xmath0-baryons ) , assigning them different probabilities _ ad hoc _ so as to explore the entire parameter space .",

    "scattering off a nucleon is non - trivial .",

    "is roughly the same as the size of the accompanying hadron system , the total cross section for nucleon scattering can be approximated by the asymptotic values for the cross sections for normal hadron scattering off nucleons .",
    "therefore , for @xmath0-baryons we take @xmath76  @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to a cross section for scattering off air molecules @xmath77 yielding a mean free path in the atmosphere @xmath78 , where we have taken @xmath79 ( corresponding to an atomic mixture of 78% n , 21.05% o , 0.47% ar and 0.03% of other elements ) . at this c.m .",
    "energy , the @xmath80-air cross section is roughly 90% of the @xmath81-air cross section  @xcite , hence for @xmath0-meson states we set @xmath82 @xmath0-glueballs are expected to have the same cross section as @xmath0-mesons .",
    "this is because the geometrical cross section is approximated by the high energy hadron cross section , where gluon exchange dominates ( the @xmath83 coupling is a factor 9/4 larger than the @xmath84 coupling , but a meson has 2 quarks , resulting in a cross section of a @xmath74 state which is @xmath85 times the cross section for a @xmath86 state ) . with this in mind we set @xmath87    in analogy to a billard ball moving through a sea of ping - pong balls ,",
    "the @xmath0 suffers very little energy loss as it traverses the atmosphere .",
    "then for @xmath0-flippers ( i.e. , @xmath88 ) we assume that the emitted pion has an energy @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the lorentz factor of the incoming .. this means that most of the energy @xmath91 is carried by the accompanying @xmath92 produced in the interaction .",
    "following  @xcite , for inelastic collisions we parameterize the fractional energy loss per collision as @xmath93 for completness , a derivation of this relation is given in the appendix .",
    "the pierre auger observatory ( or simply `` auger '' )  @xcite is designed to study cosmic rays with energies above about @xmath94 , with the aim of uncovering their origins and nature .",
    "such events are too rare to be directly detected , but the direction , energy , and to some extent the chemical composition of the primary particle can be inferred from the cascade of secondary particles induced when the primary impinges on the upper atmosphere .",
    "these cascades , or air showers , have been studied by measuring the nitrogen fluorescence they produce in the atmosphere or by directly sampling shower particles at ground level .",
    "auger is a hybrid detector , exploiting both of these well established techniques , by employing an array of water erenkov detectors overlooked by fluorescence telescopes . on clear moonless nights",
    ", air showers are simultaneously observed by both types of detectors , facilitating powerful reconstruction methods and control of the systematic errors which have plagued cosmic ray experiments to date .",
    "the observatory is now operational on an elevated plane in western argentina and is in the process of growing to its final size of 3,000  @xmath95 .",
    "the surface detector ( sd ) consists of an array of 1600 water tanks deployed on an hexagonal grid with spacing of 1.5  km .",
    "these tanks detect the erenkov light produced by shower particles crossing their @xmath96 water volume , thanks to three 9-inch photo - multipliers .",
    "the fluorescence detector ( fd ) consists of four ensambles of six telescopes , each of which has a field of view of @xmath97 vertically and @xmath97 horizontally ( i.e. , @xmath98 for each fluorescence detector site ) .",
    "the geography of northern site would accommodate a larger array ( of up to 10,370  km@xmath63  @xcite ) , allowing higher sensitivity to the low flux of cosmic @xmath0 s .",
    "identifying showers themselves is usually straightforward , as there is essentially no `` background '' for the detectors , at least above their energy threshold . in the case of auger ,",
    "the threshold for the surface detector is around @xmath99  gev , below which less than 10% of the showers can trigger three tanks or more , as required .",
    "however , full detection efficiency ( i.e. , 100% or `` saturated acceptance '' ) is achieved only around @xmath100  gev for showers with zenith angle lower than @xmath101 and lower energy showers are usually discarded to avoid any complication caused by the energy dependence of both the detection efficiency and the energy resolution . for fluorescence detectors , showers with energies as low @xmath102  gev can be observed .",
    "however , the corresponding acceptance is relatively low , since the total intensity of the fluorescence light does not allow detection from a large distance , and the shower maximum is then usually above the field of view of the telescopes , which prevents accurate reconstruction .",
    "like for any fluorescence detector , the acceptance of the eyes of auger increases with energy ( as bigger showers can be seen from larger distances ) and depends on the atmospheric conditions . however , a precise determination of the fluorescence detector acceptance is not crucial , thanks to its hybrid nature , the energy differential flux ( or `` spectrum '' ) is not obtained from the fluorescence detector , but from the surface detector whose absolute acceptance is essentially geometrical above saturation and thus is controlled within a few percent at most .",
    "identifying the primary particle species is somewhat more difficult as one has to search for differences in the shower development , which are usually relatively small and subject to fluctuations associated with the stochasticity of the first interactions  @xcite .",
    "however , as we discuss in the next sections the showers initiated by .",
    "have very distinctive characteristics and can be easily isolated from background .",
    "the aires simulation engine  @xcite provides full space - time particle propagation in a realistic environment , taking into account the characteristics of the atmospheric density profile ( using the standard us atmosphere @xcite ) , the earth s curvature , and the geomagnetic field ( calculated for the location of auger with an uncertainty of a few percent  @xcite ) .",
    "the following particles are taken into account in the aires simulations : photons , electrons , positrons , muons , pions , kaons , eta mesons , lambda baryons , nucleons , antinucleons , and nuclei up to @xmath103 .",
    "nucleus - nucleus , hadron - nucleus , and photon - nucleus inelastic collisions with significant cross - sections are taken into account in the simulation . the hadronic processes are simulated using different models , accordingly to the energy : high energy collisions are processed invoking an external package ( sibyll 2.1  @xcite or qgsjetii  @xcite ) , while low energy ones are processed using an extension of the hillas splitting algorithm ( ehsa )  @xcite .",
    "the threshold energies separating the low and high energy regimes used in our simulations are 200 gev and 80 gev for the sibyll and qgsjet , respectively .",
    "the ehsa low energy hadronic model used in aires is a very fast procedure , effectively emulating the major characteristics of low energy hadronic collisions .",
    "the model is adjusted to retrieve similar results as the high energy hadronic model for energies near the transition thresholds previously mentioned , and the low energy cross sections are calculated from parameterizations of experimental data .",
    "a complete discussion on the low energy hadronic models is clearly beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "a separate report on this subject will be published elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the aires program consists of various interacting procedures that operate on a data set with a variable number of records .",
    "several data arrays ( or stacks ) are defined .",
    "every record within any of these stacks is a particle entry and represents a physical particle .",
    "the data contained in every record are related to the characteristics of the corresponding particle .",
    "the particles can move inside a volume within the atmosphere where the shower takes place .",
    "this volume is limited by the ground , the injection surfaces , and by vertical planes which limit the region of interest . before starting the simulation",
    "all the stacks are empty .",
    "the first action is to add the first stack entry , which corresponds to the primary particle",

    "the . produces a somewhat larger signal at ground level than one would expect from standard baryonic showers .",

    "showers are characterized by the presence of a strong electromagnetic component at all zenith angles .",
    "this implies a much longer time span for the signal , in comparison with proton showers . at the same time , the minishowers generated by the passage of the . across the atmosphere produce narrower lateral distributions than the corresponding ones for the proton case .",
    "if @xmath0-hadron events are analyzed with the standard protocol for hadronic primary showers , a series of inconsistencies will be present .",
    "in particular , the energy determination via ground signal analysis of very inclined showers  @xcite will likely lead to a primary energy overestimation . on the other hand , an eventual hybrid event of this kind",
    "will show a limited , or even below threshold fd signal .",
    "this leads to contradictory fd and sd energy determinations .",
    "moreover , these `` golden '' events would allow identification of @xmath0-hadrons from eventual quasi - horizontal neutrino events that are likely to generate showers with similar ground signal , but non - negligible fluorescence contribution  @xcite .",
    "the pertinent question at this point is whether existing experiments have already collected events exhibiting the characteristics of gluino showers described above .",
    "none of the ultrahigh energy cosmic ray experiments have thus reported such results .",
    "it is interesting to note , however , that the @xmath130 `` centauro '' events detected at mt .",
    "chacaltaya  @xcite might be suggestive of gluino - induced showers . in these events ,",
    "the ratio of hadronic to electromagnetic components is about 50:1 , contrary to the expectation of dominance of the electromagnetic component in vertical baryon - induced showers .",
    "the most carefully considered explanation to date is the explosive quark matter model  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , though heavy high energy gluinos could also produce such an inverted hadronic electromagnetic ratio .",
    "this is because the multiple low - inelasticity collisions would result in hadronic superimposed showers . at detector level ( @xmath131 ) ,",
    "the electromagnetic component of the sub - showers would be mostly filtered out , while the superposed hadronic showers would survive .",
    "this is because the `` low '' energy ( @xmath132  tev ) electromagnetic sub - showers induced by high energy @xmath0-hadrons would develop faster ( being quickly quenched by atmospheric losses ) than the high energy ( @xmath133  gev ) electromagnetic subshowers induced by ultrahigh energy @xmath0-hadrons .",
    "it is also interesting to note that this explanation of the centaruo events does not predict any phenomenon one might observe at a collider experiment , consistent with the null - results from ua1  @xcite , ua5  @xcite , and cdf  @xcite .",
    "if in fact , gluinos are guilty of producing the centauro events , it would constitute the first evidence of a finely - tuned universe from a cosmic ray observation .",
    "consider the process in which two particles of 4-momenta @xmath134 and @xmath135 and masses @xmath136 and @xmath137 scatter two particles of momenta @xmath138 and @xmath139 and masses @xmath136 and @xmath140 , respectively .",
    "using the total 4-momentum @xmath141 we define the vector @xmath142 and write the lorentz - invariant form      in terms of the mandelstam variables @xmath144 and @xmath145 note that this squared invariant when viewed from the c.m .",
    "frame reduces to @xmath146 where @xmath147 is the scattered angle .",
    "consequently , the forward direction is defined through the condition @xmath148 . in the large @xmath149 limit where @xmath150 the minimum momentum transfered can be easily obtained by setting eq .",
