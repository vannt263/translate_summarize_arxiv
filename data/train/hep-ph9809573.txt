    "the resummation scheme by braaten and pisarski @xcite is well established in high temperature field theory . since its first announcement in 1989",
    "it has been applied to a vast variety of physical problems @xcite , where the calculation of the gluon damping rate was the most spectacular one @xcite . to obtain consistent results in a perturbative calculation one has to distinguish two momentum scales . on the hard scale , where momenta are @xmath0 ( @xmath1 temperature )",
    ", the conventional perturbation series is valid . on the soft scale , where the momenta are @xmath2 ( @xmath3 is the small coupling )",
    ", one has to resum the so called hard thermal loops ( htl ) .",
    "the resulting effective vertices and propagators are screening formerly untreatable infrared singularities .",
    "this leads to finite and gauge invariant outcomings for physical quantities .    in some cases , however , it turned out that the htl were insufficient to screen all infinities .",
    "for example , the damping rate of dynamical gluons and the screening length in a gluon plasma suffer from the lack of a thermal magnetic mass @xcite , which results in an infrared singularity .",
    "another shortcoming was introduced by the htl itself . whenever outer momenta are soft and lightlike , the htl cause collinear singularities @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , in a medium like the gluon plasma there are no long range forces since medium effects care for the screening .",
    "thus , such singularities should be spurious .",
    "the braaten - pisarski scheme can be understood in the context of a renormalisation group treatment @xcite .",
    "the effective propagators and vertices are included in an effective action @xcite which is the result of integrating out the hard momentum scale .",
    "it was shown in @xcite , however , that in this action for lightlike outer momenta the hard modes have not been integrated out completely .",
    "one has to take into account a certain asymptotic thermal mass .",
    "an improved htl resummation scheme has been proposed recently in @xcite which includes this mass and is free from collinear singularities while retaining the structure and simplicity of the action @xcite . in this letter",
    "we will test the new resummation scheme for consistency .",
    "its applicability will be shown by a simple check of the next - to - leading order plasmon frequency .",
    "the paper starts with a collection of notations ( sect .  2 ) .",
    "the next two sections review a few facts on the plasmon - frequency at next - to - leading order ( sect .  3 ) and on the resummation of asymptotic masses ( sect .  4 ) .",
    "in section 5 we derive two consistency conditions which the plasmon frequency must obey and in section 6 we test these conditions by explicitly calculating the plasmon frequency near the light - cone .",

    "the limit of hard momentum , however , does not necessarily imply to replace the resummed propagators and vertices with the tree - level ones .",
    "instead , whenever the outer momentum @xmath30 becomes lightlike , one is forced to use massive propagators @xcite .",
    "we will cover this case in the following section .",

    "the first part of @xmath60 is typical for the one - loop diagrams in figure [ fig1 ] . for simplicity",
    "we have replaced the complicated self - energies by a single mass @xmath61 .",
    "the second part is the analogon to @xmath56}$ ] in the tree - level approximation .",
    "when @xmath30 is off the light - cone , i.e.  @xmath62 , the leading order of the integral in ( [ eff260 ] ) obviously comes from soft @xmath63 .",
    "we can approximately set @xmath64 and evaluate ( [ eff260 ] ) .",
    "but with @xmath30 becoming light - like , @xmath65 , the two parts in ( [ eff260 ] ) behave totally different .",
    "the second term becomes large due to a collinear singularity while the first one remains finite .",
    "now , the integration is not any more restricted to the soft scale . still using @xmath64",
    ", we find a strong power - like singularity @xcite , @xmath66 thus , this behavior is not solely due to a collinear singularity , but also to a latent uv - singularity , which is caused by a premature restriction to soft momenta . obviously , if @xmath67 becomes sufficiently small , @xmath57 may overgrow the leading order self - energy @xmath68 and the perturbative expansions breaks down .    for the consistency of the braaten - pisarski effective action @xcite",
    "the above behavior is a disaster .",
    "the hard scale has not been integrated out entirely and consequently the action of @xcite is incomplete in the sense of renormalization group theory . to restore consistency , as seen in @xcite ,",
    "one has to include a certain asymptotic mass @xmath69 in the calculation of the hard thermal loops .",
    "fortunately , though including @xmath70 , in the corresponding improved htl - effective action @xcite the elegant structure and gauge - invariance of the braaten - pisarski action @xcite can be maintained .",
    "moreover , recalculating the gluon polarization function with the improved action gives finite results for all momenta , including the light - cone .",
    "the true gluon system has a richer structure than in the previous example . here ,",
    "the above mentioned latent uv - singularities are not the only mechanism that cause @xmath57 to grow near the light - cone . as will be seen in the following section ,",
    "the htl - parts of the vertices introduce additional collinear singularities which may cause a breakdown of the perturbation expansion . however , the physical quantity under consideration is not the self - energy , but plasmon frequency and damping .",

    "consider equation ( [ eff210 ] ) that defines @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "for its derivation we made use of two ( really trivial ) inequalities , @xmath73 for all physical momenta .",
    "violation of the inequalities ( [ qcd110 ] ) would invalidate the perturbative expansion of the physical quantities . in the following section we check ( [ qcd110 ] ) by calculating @xmath48 near the light - cone .    however , we will _ not _ do the calculation _ on _ the light - cone but we will keep a small distance @xmath74 with @xmath75 for two reasons :    * on the light - cone the use of the improved htl - vertices @xcite is required , leading into technical difficulties . for @xmath76 , however , we may neglect @xmath70 , which renders the following calculation feasible . *",
    "a finite but small distance @xmath76 is still interesting to decide whether the asymptotic mass resummation is sufficient near the light - cone . if there were a breakdown of perturbation theory ( there is none ! ) we would have to think about an additional resummation to @xmath70 , for example one including some kind of thermal damping , see eg  @xcite .",
    "such a new screening mechanism for the collinear singularities may show up in a larger ( though still small ) distance @xmath67 , namely @xmath77 ( rather than @xmath78 in the case of @xmath70 ) . but this range is consistently treated within the present framework .",
    "let us return to the conditions ( [ qcd110 ] ) .",
    "since in ( [ eff210 ] ) we have @xmath79 near the light - cone , the first condition in ( [ qcd110 ] ) is a rather weak one for the self - energy @xmath57 .",

    "the leading order @xmath49 behaves like @xmath83 and thus @xmath84 is allowed as long as @xmath85 .",

    "( [ qcd130 ] ) , we arrive at the following inequalities which form the consistency conditions to be fulfilled by @xmath48 for @xmath74 : @xmath87 these restrictions on the light - cone behavior of @xmath48 will be checked by explicit calculation in the following section .",
    "in this main section we evaluate the next - to - leading gluon polarization function @xmath88 near the light - cone @xmath89 .",
    "we are interested in the order of magnitude of the first term of the asymptotics in @xmath90 .",
    "the starting point of the calculation is equation ( 4.5 ) of @xcite .",
    "the expression for @xmath48 can be split into two parts , @xmath91 the first part contains only tree level vertices while all the remaining contributions from htl - vertices are assembled in @xmath92 . in both parts the propagators are the resummed one ( [ eff100 ] ) .",

    "we will concentrate on the terms @xmath98 and @xmath99 which are the only ones giving rise to strong collinear singularities @xcite .    for summing over the matsubara frequencies it is convenient to introduce spectral densities @xmath100 .",

    "always mean @xmath108 .    as we will see in the next subsection",
    "the main reason for the strong light - cone singularities is a combination of collinear and infrared effects .",
    "this is due to the weird behavior of the transversal density @xcite for small momentum , @xmath109 which is nothing but the lack of a magnetic screening mass .",
    "we split off the ir - sensitive part , @xmath110 where the factor 2 in the second equation is for conveniance .",
    "it comes from the fact that @xmath99 is invariant with respect to the interchange @xmath111 .",

    "we obtain a logarithmic singularity at small @xmath63 , for vanishing @xmath63 the collinear singularity becomes stronger .",
    "so , from ( [ meg130 ] ) we expect the leading contribution to come from a very limited region of the integration variables : the infrared limit of the @xmath63-integral .",
