    "the most important characteristic of chaos is the `` trajectory instability '' , which makes the long - term predictability impossible  @xcite .",
    "this characteristic can be quantified with positive lyapunov exponent .",
    "owing to the long - term unpredictability , chaotic dynamics can be used as random number generators . on the other hand",

    "however , the origin of the unpredictability in stochastic process is believed to be different from that for chaotic dynamics . in connection with this fact ,",
    "one may ask `` is it possible to precisely simulate stochastic process with a chaotic dynamics suitably constructed ? '' .",
    "in other words , does a hidden dynamics which gives the same statistics as the stochastic process under consideration exist ? the present paper concerns with this question .",

    "<S> it is shown that large deviation statistical quantities of the discrete time , finite state markov process @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the probability for the @xmath2-state at the time step @xmath3 and @xmath4 is the transition probability , completely coincides with those from the kalman map corresponding to the above markov process . </S>",
