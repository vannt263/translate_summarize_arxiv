    "the @xmath0 ising model represents an interesting theoretical laboratory , in which one can study the effects of quenched disorder and frustration on the critical behavior of spin systems .",
    "while originally introduced to describe magnetic systems with disordered couplings @xcite , it has been shown recently to be also relevant for quantum computations  @xcite .",
    "it is defined by the lattice hamiltonian  @xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 , the sum is over all pairs of lattice nearest - neighbor sites , and the exchange interactions @xmath16 are uncorrelated quenched random variables , taking values @xmath0 with probability distribution @xmath17 in the following we set @xmath18 without loss of generality .",
    "for @xmath3 we recover the standard ising model , while for @xmath19 we obtain the bimodal ising spin - glass model .",
    "the @xmath1-@xmath2 phase diagram of the two - dimensional ( 2d ) square - lattice @xmath0 ising model has been extensively investigated @xcite .",
    "the resulting phase diagram , which is sketched in fig .",
    "[ phdia ] , presents two phases at finite temperature : a paramagnetic and a ferromagnetic phase .",
    "they are separated by a transition line , which starts at the pure ising transition point at @xmath3 and @xmath20 and ends at the @xmath21 transition at @xmath22 .",
    "the point where this transition line meets the so - called nishimori ( n ) line @xcite , at @xmath23 and @xmath5 ( we derive these estimates in the present paper ) , is a multicritical point ( mnp ) @xcite .",
    "the mnp divides the paramagnetic - ferromagnetic ( pf ) transition line in two parts . the pf transition line from the ising point at @xmath3 to the mnp",
    "is controlled by the ising fixed point : disorder gives only rise to logarithmic corrections to the standard ising critical behavior @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the presence of the mnp on the transition line suggests that the pf transitions for @xmath8 belong to a different strong - disorder universality class .",
    "this is confirmed by the renormalization - group ( rg ) calculations of refs .   and , using domain - wall and migdal - kadanoff rg transformations respectively , which found that the rg flow along the critical line for @xmath8 was attracted by a different fixed point .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the critical behavior along the low - temperature transition line from the mnp to the @xmath21 axis .",
    "we perform monte carlo ( mc ) simulations at two temperature values below the mnp , i.e. , at @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "as we shall see , our finite - size scaling ( fss ) analyses show that the pf transition line for @xmath8 is reentrant and that the transitions are continuous .",
    "moreover , the estimates of the critical exponents and of several rg invariant quantities for these two values of @xmath1 are consistent , supporting the hypothesis that the pf transition line below the mnp belongs to a unique universality class .",
    "the values of the critical exponents , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 are clearly different from the ising values @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 .",
    "therefore , these results show the existence of a strong - disorder fixed point associated with a pf transition .",
    "note that this strong - disorder fixed point does not violate hyperscaling . indeed ,",
    "our results are consistent with the hyperscaling relation @xmath29 ( our estimates of the critical exponents @xmath30 and @xmath31 give @xmath32 ) .",

    "the pf transitions are of second order and show the same critical behavior with critical exponents @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 , which are consistent with hyperscaling .",

    ", there is no evidence of a finite - temperature glassy phase .",
    "glassy behavior is only expected for @xmath21 and @xmath71 .",
    "the critical behavior for @xmath72 has been much investigated for @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "in particular , simulations found that the correlation length increases as @xmath73 with @xmath74 .",
    "a natural hypothesis is that a @xmath21 glassy transition occurs for any @xmath71 , with critical behavior in the same universality class as that of the bimodal model with @xmath19 .",
    "the point @xmath59 , where the low - temperature transition line ends is a multicritical point : it is connected to three phases and it is the intersection of two different transition lines , the pf line at @xmath75 and the glassy line at @xmath21 . at @xmath21 the critical point @xmath76 separates a ferromagnetic phase from a @xmath21 glassy phase , while for @xmath77 the transition line separates a ferromagnetic from a paramagnetic phase .",
    "therefore , on general grounds , the critical behavior when varying @xmath2 at @xmath21 differs from that along the pf transition line at @xmath75 , unless the magnetic and glassy critical modes are effectively decoupled at the @xmath21 multicritical point .",
    "the latter scenario is apparently supported by the fact that the estimates of magnetic critical exponents at @xmath21 , see e.g. refs .  ,",
    "are quite close and substantially consistent with those found along the transition line at finite temperature @xmath78 .",
    "we investigate the critical behavior along the pf line that starts at the mnp @xmath79 and ends at @xmath80 . since the transition line below the mnp is expected to be almost parallel to the @xmath1 axis , we study the fss behavior of several quantities at fixed @xmath1 as a function of @xmath2 .",
    "we consider two values of @xmath1 , @xmath81 and @xmath25 , which are quite far from the two endpoints of the line .",

    "we clearly observe a crossing point for @xmath91 , indicating @xmath92 - 0.893 , which is larger than the value at the mnp , i.e. @xmath93 .",
    "this already suggests that the transition line is reentrant .    to obtain more precise estimates",
    "we perform a careful fss analysis , following ref .  @xcite . in the fss limit",
    "any rg invariant quantity obeys the scaling law @xmath94 where @xmath95 , @xmath96 , and we have neglected scaling corrections . here @xmath97 is the nonlinear scaling field associated with the leading relevant operator , which has rg dimension @xmath98 .",
    "the scaling field is an analytic function of the system parameters which vanishes along the critical line .",
    "thus , for @xmath99 at fixed @xmath31 we can write @xmath100 where the coefficients @xmath101 are analytic functions of @xmath31 .",
    "the terms of order @xmath102 , etc . , give rise to corrections of order @xmath103 as @xmath104 .",

    "@xcite for a thorough discussion of their origin . in pure ferromagnetic systems ,",
    "in which @xmath105 and @xmath106 , they are usually negligible , and the nonanalytic corrections , which behave as @xmath107 , @xmath108 , play a much more important role .",
    "this is not the case here , since , as we shall see , at the transition line @xmath109 .",
    "since our data are sufficiently close to the critical point , @xmath110 is small and thus we can take @xmath111 .",
    "moreover , also the product @xmath112 is small , so that we can expand @xmath113 in powers of @xmath114 .",

    "changes significantly as we increase @xmath121 from 1 to 2 , and only marginally as we change this parameter from 2 to 3 .",
    "this indicates that the range of values of @xmath2 we are considering is too large to allow for a linear approximation of the scaling function @xmath113 .",
    "instead , a quadratic approximation seems to be accurate enough .",
