    "the field of tev gamma - ray astronomy is exploring energy regimes that have been , until recently , out of reach to astrophysicists . yet , even as the catalog of tev sources continues to grow , it is still debated whether the observed gamma rays are produced leptonically , through the inverse compton scattering of energetic electrons on ambient photons ( @xmath3 ) , or hadronically , though neutral pion decay ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "air erenkov telescopes , such as hess  @xcite , can measure a source spectrum with high precision for @xmath5 @xmath6  tev .",
    "one might hope that as we probe higher energy gamma rays , indications of their true origin would be revealed .",
    "however , at energies @xmath7  tev , the difficulties of gamma - ray astronomy become more pronounced , due to the low statistics of the quickly declining signal spectra .",
    "it is well established that a distinctive feature of a _ pionic _ ( hadronically - produced ) gamma - ray spectrum is an accompanying flux of neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "these neutrinos originate from the decay of charged pions ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) , which are produced in approximately equal numbers with neutral pions in proton - proton scattering .",
    "relative to gamma - ray telescopes , the new km@xmath1 neutrino telescopes  @xcite will have several advantages that result in improved performance at the highest energies .",
    "the rapidly falling atmospheric neutrino background , rising neutrino - nucleon cross section ( @xmath10 ) , and increasing muon range , which effectively expands the ( already large ) detector volume ( @xmath11 ) , all help to amplify the diminished flux at these energies .",
    "in fact , as the background quickly becomes negligible in the tev range , the detection of _ any _ high energy neutrinos from a source could significantly indicate a hadronic production mechanism .",

    "spectral features in the highest energy regime , especially an expected cutoff ( related to the maximum accelerated proton energies ) , shall not remain inaccessible to observation .",
    "measurement of the energies of neutrino - induced muons and showers , which are related to the original charged pion energy , can probe the source proton spectrum in a complementary manner to gamma - ray observations , which effectively measure the neutral pion spectrum  @xcite .",
    "the sensitivities of these two independent approaches , including the regime where they coincide , are illustrated in fig .",

    "the ability to accurately measure neutrino - induced muon spectra greatly improves the prospects for detecting point sources , as the harder source spectra dominate the atmospheric background above @xmath18  tev . while muon tracks have better angular resolution ( @xmath19 ) , neutrino",
    "_ showers _ ( @xmath20 in water ) more faithfully trace the spectrum .",
    "shower observations , which measure the @xmath21 and @xmath22 fluxes , when combined with muon data , also allow for the study of the ratio of neutrino flavors arriving from a source  @xcite .    considering the latest observations of galactic tev sources , we calculate the corresponding spectra of detectable neutrino - induced muons and showers , assuming only that the observed gamma - ray spectra are pionic , for a range of possible high energy cutoffs in the spectra .",
    "relative to analyses in which the total numbers of signal and background events are counted ( e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , a maximum likelihood analysis would have much more power .",
    "for example , below @xmath18  tev , a single event has a much greater probability of being background than at @xmath23  tev , where the source signal is dominant .",
    "spectra allow for such an approach , which takes full advantage of experimental data , in studying the high energy behavior of tev sources .",
    "resolving hadronic activity at these extreme energies would provide clear evidence concerning the sources of galactic cosmic rays  @xcite .",
    "atmospheric cosmic - ray showers give rise to high rates of down - going muons , forcing a neutrino telescope to search for up - going muons resulting from neutrino interactions .",
    "icecube is well - situated to utilize the high resolution of these @xmath14-induced muons in observing northern - sky sources .",
    "however , a detector is needed in the northern hemisphere to accurately locate southern - sky neutrino sources , although icecube may also measure shower rates from particularly bright sources . together ,",
    "icecube and a km@xmath1 mediterranean detector will provide full - time coverage of the entire sky , a feature distinct to neutrino telescopes .",
    "the combined observations from these detectors can be used to study compound objects , like the vela complex , by : ( 1 ) discovering neutrino sources through high - resolution @xmath14-induced muons ; ( 2 ) confirming agreement with gamma - ray observations in the low energy regime ; ( 3 ) examining previously unexplored energies using muons and showers together .",
    "the sources that we examine in detail are briefly discussed in section  [ prospsection ] .",
    "our empirical calculations , based upon observed tev spectra , should be compared with previous galactic neutrino studies , which have considered theoretical production models or less recent data ( e.g. refs  @xcite ) . in two very recent works , by lipari  @xcite and kappes , hinton , stegmann , and aharonian  @xcite , a similar approach to ours has been followed , with complementary perspectives and details .",

    "this source has several interesting features which merit further investigation .",
    "the large extent of the emission , hardness of the spectrum , high gas density ( which is well - correlated with the tev emission ) and strong magnetic fields in the region leave very little doubt that this spectrum is pionic  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the total flux from this region is actually about twice as intense as that of the previously discovered source coincident with sgr  a *  @xcite .",
    "measurement of the accompanying neutrino flux would provide an independent confirmation of the means of production , something which has never been possible .",

    "the calculated @xmath14-induced muon fluxes based upon the two different sets of hess data illustrate the effects of different high energy spectral assumptions .",
    "recently , hess has reported the discovery of four tev sources in the galactic plane which have no apparent counterparts at other wavelengths  @xcite .",
    "in addition to these , egret previously discovered numerous unidentified sources of gev gamma rays in the milky way  @xcite .",
    "the confirmed observation of neutrinos from these sources would also reveal an intimate connection between tev gamma rays and cosmic rays .",
    "furthermore , the understanding of these and other gamma - ray sources may account for the tev excess  @xcite .",
    "in high energy @xmath24-@xmath24 scattering , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath25 are produced in nearly equal numbers  @xcite .",
    "gamma rays are the result of the decay @xmath4 , while neutrinos originate from the @xmath26 and @xmath27 decay channels .",
    "the ratio of neutrinos to photons from pion decay is easily found . from charged pion decay ,",
    "the resulting initial neutrino flavor ratio , @xmath28 , is @xmath29 . during the traversal of astrophysical distances ,",
    "vacuum neutrino oscillations transform this ratio to @xmath30 . in neutrino telescopes , neutrinos and antineutrinos",
    "are practically indistinguishable .",
    "we can then consider their sum , @xmath31 , and average cross section in all calculations .",
    "all further references to neutrinos will imply @xmath31 .",
    "thus , for equal pion multiplicities , each photon from @xmath25 decay corresponds to one neutrino of each flavor ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "the typical energy of the neutrinos resulting from these decays is @xmath33 of the gamma - ray energy from @xmath25 decay .",
    "the resulting @xmath31 spectrum is then shifted , relative to the source gamma - ray spectrum of @xmath34 , as @xmath35 where we consider each neutrino flavor separately .",
    "we will generally refer to the normalization of the gamma - ray spectrum as @xmath36 , the differential photon flux at @xmath37  tev ( in tev@xmath17 @xmath38 s@xmath17 ) , which is commonly used in gamma - ray astronomy .",

    "see ref .",
    "pions can also be produced , in a different ratio , in @xmath24-@xmath44 scattering , but this is generally only important at much higher energies  @xcite . a neutrino flux may be observed through neutrino - induced muons and electromagnetic ( and hadronic ) cascades , which are referred to as showers .",
    "we shall consider both methods in further detail .",
    "our analysis of muon detection will be limited to @xmath14 charged - current ( cc ) events with an observable final energy of @xmath45  tev , which can be detected through their erenkov emission with an angular resolution of @xmath46  @xcite .",
    "it is important to recognize that the relevant quantity in these events is the measured energy of the _ muon _ , which can be reconstructed from radiative losses in the detector  @xcite .",
    "as muons can be produced far outside of the detector , with energy loss prior to entering , results of calculations are given in terms of @xmath47 ( at the detector ) instead of @xmath48 .",
    "we can consider @xmath14-induced muons produced both inside and outside of the instrumented volume of the detector .",
    "_ contained _ event rates can be found by combining the neutrino flux , detector mass , and @xmath49 for neutrino - nucleon scattering .",
    "we use the average of the @xmath50-@xmath51 and @xmath52-@xmath51 cross sections , as computed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and @xmath53 from ref .",
    "we consider a detector that is entirely composed of , and enclosed by , water ( ice ) , with a km@xmath54 detector area , which is a reasonable approximation at these energies .",
    "using an icecube - like effective detector area , such as computed in ref .",
    "@xcite , would lead to the lower energy muon spectrum being slightly suppressed .",
    "an actual km@xmath1 detector will be situated on top of solid rock , which will enhance the upward - going neutrino - induced muon rates relative to our calculations .",
    "also , muons produced via @xmath22 cc interactions , which contribute to the total muon flux through the @xmath55 decay channel , will not be considered  @xcite .",
    "our formulas follow those of gaisser  @xcite , with appropriate approximations . considering the uncertainties in both the gamma - ray spectra and neutrino telescope performance , which may not be fully understood until the actual detectors are calibrated , as well as the low statistics , our calculations are sufficient for the scope of this work .",
    "using these parameters , the spectrum of contained @xmath14-induced muon events is calculated as @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the detector volume , @xmath58 is an assumed exponential cutoff in the neutrino spectrum , and the term @xmath59 takes into account observation time ( t ) , normalization of the muon spectrum , and the molar density of water .",
    "the energy of the produced muon is related to the original neutrino energy as @xmath60 .",
    "the term @xmath61 , with @xmath62 , accounts for neutrino attenuation due to scattering within earth . here",
    ", @xmath63 and @xmath64 is the average column depth ( in cm.w.e . ) of earth based upon the declination of the source  @xcite .",
    "this attenuation factor only becomes important at @xmath65  tev , and varies with declination , as discussed in ref .",
    ".    a high energy muon born outside of the detector may still be detectable when it enters the instrumented detector volume . to find the propagation range of a muon",

    "as the muon range ( typically a few km ) increases with energy , so does the effective volume of the detector .",
    "the observed through - going spectrum , accounting for the probability of observing a muon entering the detector with energy @xmath47 , can then be calculated as @xmath72 where @xmath73 is assumed to be @xmath37 km@xmath74 .",
    "it should be noted that our use of the total @xmath49 and @xmath75 may overestimate the muon signal rates by @xmath2  @xmath76% ( perhaps more for spectra harder than @xmath77 ) .",
    "however , the atmospheric background will also be overestimated by a similar , even slightly larger amount .      for bright point sources or low surface brightness extended sources , shower events caused by @xmath21 , @xmath22 cc interactions",
    "can be used to effectively determine the source spectrum . to detect shower events",
    ", they must be at least partially enclosed within the instrumented volume .",
    "the shower signal is dominated by @xmath21 and @xmath22 cc events , which transfer @xmath78 of the original neutrino energy to the shower ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "the measurable shower spectrum , given in terms of the observed _ shower _ energy , @xmath80 , @xmath81 then effectively traces the original neutrino flux , as the neutral - current ( nc ) events from all three flavors , which only contain @xmath82 ( in addition to the smaller @xmath83 ) , only account for @xmath84% of the total signal .",
    "combined shower and muon observations would determine the @xmath85 ratio arriving from a source .",
    "this measured flavor ratio has many applications , as detailed in refs .",
    "the atmospheric @xmath21 flux is only about @xmath86 of the @xmath14 background , which itself only adds to the shower background through the weaker nc channel , since @xmath14 cc interactions are identifiable by the resulting muon tracks . we will not consider the prompt background , which is the only source of atmospheric @xmath87 , as it only becomes important at very high energies  @xcite .",
    "these facts help offset the lower angular resolution of these events ( @xmath88 is expected for a mediterranean detector  @xcite , @xmath89 for icecube  @xcite ) , which sets the background event rate .",
    "the improved shower resolution of a mediterranean detector , as compared to icecube ( which is naturally limited by light scattering in ice ) , increases the value of showers in determining the high energy properties of a source .       a demonstration of the sensitivity of neutrino telescopes to varying spectral characteristics . shown is the ( base-10 log ) differential ( @xmath90)-induced muon spectra for a pionic source spectrum with @xmath91 tev@xmath17 @xmath38 s@xmath17 . in the upper panel ,",

    "for ease of comparing the expected signal to background and assessing total rates , we will mainly provide integrated rates above a given measured energy .",
    "because the atmospheric spectrum is very steeply falling at these energies ( @xmath110 ) , it is often advantageous to use a low energy event cutoff @xmath111  tev when calculating significance .",
    "our method can also yield the measured muon and shower spectra directly .",
    "spectral information should be used for maximum likelihood analysis of observed neutrino events in a neutrino telescope , to make the best use of measured energies in determining detection significance .",
    "this spectral information requires consideration of the energy resolution of the detector . in icecube , the energy resolution for muons and showers is expected to be @xmath112% and @xmath0% in the logarithm of the energy , respectively  @xcite , which does not significantly affect our conclusions .    note that we present our results for an assumed muon effective area of @xmath37 km@xmath74 , and assumed muon angular resolution of @xmath46 , both independent of energy .",

    "part of our intent is to show the likely signals , and to encourage the experimentalists to optimize their detector designs in order to achieve the necessary sensitivity to observe galactic tev sources .",

    "can presently be claimed to possess a guaranteed neutrino flux .",
    "the detection of this neutrino flux will give further insight into the complex processes occurring in the galactic center region .",
    "when we consider that , to date , _ no high energy astrophysical neutrinos have ever been positively detected _ , the importance of such a guaranteed flux of tev neutrinos is difficult to overstate",
    ".    included in the catalog of tev sources are several that remain unidentified .",
    "as more observations are undertaken by the hess , magic , and veritas telescopes , this number is expected to increase .",

    "an even larger number of unidentified sources remains in the gev regime from egret observations .",
    "many of these sources have intense , hard spectra .",
    "if any of these sources , some of which are visible to icecube , have spectra that extrapolate into the tev regime and are pionic , they would have abundant fluxes of neutrinos .    in summary , the prospects for the near - term first discoveries of galactic tev neutrino sources are very good .",
    "importantly , this conclusion is empirically based on the measured spectra of bright galactic tev gamma - ray sources .",
    "for some of these , there are very compelling independent arguments that the observed gamma rays arise from neutral pion decays , meaning that they must be accompanied by neutrinos .",
    "it is essential to test this directly for these sources , as well as for others where the possibility of neutrino emission is uncertain .",
    "we emphasize the importance of using the measured muon energy spectra to discriminate against the quickly falling atmospheric neutrino backgrounds .",
    "for example , a single event near @xmath23  tev from a source direction is almost certainly signal , while an event near @xmath37  tev has a much higher probability of being background .",
    "this fact alone could be enough to help establish discovery . due to the amplifying factors of neutrino cross section and muon range , neutrino detectors have better",
    "reach to the highest energies in the source spectra , as compared to gamma - ray telescopes , which can make precise measurements at lower energies .",
    "this complementarity can be exploited to help solve the long - standing puzzle of the origin of the galactic cosmic rays .",
    "for all of the sources discussed here , the rates in km@xmath1 neutrino telescopes are relatively small , at most @xmath155  events / year , though we have argued that even these small rates could have a powerful impact .",
    "while it remains possible that various uncertainties and detector limitations may make these observations even more challenging , they might also be better than described here .",
    "if the source spectra extrapolate to higher energies than we have assumed , or especially if the emitted tev gamma - ray spectra have been diminished by absorption in the sources , which is quite possible , then the neutrino detection event rates could be significantly larger than shown here . given the potentially unique power of neutrino astronomy , we can only hope that nature has been so kind .",

    "<S> recent observations , particularly from the hess collaboration , have revealed rich galactic populations of tev gamma - ray sources , including a collection unseen in other wavelengths . </S>",
    "<S> many of these gamma - ray spectra are well measured up to @xmath0  tev , where low statistics make observations by air erenkov telescopes difficult . to understand these mysterious sources , especially at much higher energies  where a cutoff should eventually appear  </S>",
    "<S> new techniques are needed . </S>",
    "<S> we point out the following : ( 1 ) for a number of sources , it is very likely that pions , and hence tev neutrinos , are produced ; ( 2 ) as a general point , neutrinos should be a better probe of the highest energies than gamma rays , due to increasing detector efficiency ; and ( 3 ) for several specific sources , the detection prospects for km@xmath1 neutrino telescopes are very good , @xmath2  110 events / year , with low atmospheric neutrino background rates above reasonable energy thresholds . </S>",
    "<S> such signal rates , as small as they may seem , will allow neutrino telescopes to powerfully discriminate between models for the galactic tev sources , with important consequences for our understanding of cosmic - ray production . </S>"
