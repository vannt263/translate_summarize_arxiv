    "the decays @xmath10 , @xmath11 and their charge - conjugates offer a way @xcite@xcite to obtain experimental information on the angle @xmath2 of the usual , non - squashed , unitarity triangle @xcite of the cabibbo  kobayashi ",
    "maskawa matrix ( ckm matrix ) @xcite at future @xmath12 factories .",
    "recently , these decays have been observed by the cleo collaboration  @xcite and experimental data are now starting to become available .",
    "so far only results for the combined branching ratios : @xmath13\\label{br - char}\\\\ \\mbox{br}(b_d\\to\\pi^\\mp k^\\pm)&\\equiv&\\frac{1}{2 } \\left[\\mbox{br}(b^0_d\\to\\pi^-k^+ ) + \\mbox{br}(\\overline{b^0_d}\\to\\pi^+k^-)\\right]\\label{br - neut}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] have been published , with large experimental uncertainties @xcite : @xmath14 consequently , it is not yet possible to determine @xmath2 as was proposed in @xcite .",
    "however , as was pointed out in @xcite , these combined branching ratios imply _ bounds _ on @xmath2 , which are of the form @xmath15 and are hence complementary to the presently allowed range @xmath16 arising from the usual fits of the unitarity triangle @xcite .",
    "if the ratio @xmath17 is found to be smaller than 1  its present experimental range is @xmath18 , so that this may indeed be the case  the quantity @xmath19 takes a maximal value @xmath20 which depends only on @xmath21 . in the future , these bounds may play an important role to constrain the unitarity triangle ( for a detailed study , see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "in addition to the general phase structure of the standard model of electroweak interactions , the following three assumptions have to be made in order to arrive at ( [ gam - max ] ) :    * isospin symmetry of strong interations can be used to derive relations between the qcd penguin amplitudes contributing to @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "* there is no non - trivial cp - violating weak phase present in the @xmath0 decay amplitude .",
    "* electroweak penguins play a negligible role in @xmath0 and @xmath1 .    while the use of the @xmath22 isospin symmetry is certainly on solid theoretical ground ",
    "although special care has to be taken when applying it to penguin topologies with internal up quarks ",
    "the other two assumptions are significantly less reliable and deserve further investigation .",
    "as far as point ( ii ) is concerned , long - distance final - state interaction effects @xcite , which are related , for instance , to rescattering processes such as @xmath23 , may in principle affect this assumption about the @xmath0 decay amplitude @xcite@xcite .",
    "an implication of such effects may be sizeable cp violation as large as @xmath24 in @xmath0 @xcite , while estimates based on simple quark - level calculations following the approach proposed by bander , silverman and soni @xcite typically yield cp asymmetries of @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "reliable calculations of such rescattering effects are , however , very challenging and require theoretical insights into the dynamics of strong interactions , which unfortunately are not available at present . in this paper we will therefore not make another attempt to `` calculate '' these effects .",
    "we rather include them in a completely general way in the formulae discussed in sections  [ ampls ] and [ gamma - det ] , and advocate the use of experimental data on the decays @xmath0 and @xmath26 to deal with final - state interactions . employing @xmath27 flavour symmetry , these channels allow us to control the rescattering effects in the bounds on @xmath2 completely .",
    "interestingly , if there are indeed large contributions from such rescattering processes , the combined @xmath5 branching ratio may well be enhanced from its `` short - distance '' value @xmath28 to the @xmath7 level , so that an experimental study of this mode appears to be feasible at future @xmath12 factories .",
    "the role of electroweak penguins in non - leptonic @xmath12 decays , and strategies to extract ckm phases , has been discussed extensively in the literature during the recent years @xcite . in the decays",
    "@xmath0 and @xmath1 , electroweak penguins contribute only in `` colour - suppressed '' form ; model calculations using `` factorization '' to estimate the relevant hadronic matrix elements give contributions at the 1% level , and hence support point ( iii ) listed above @xcite .",
    "such a treatment of the electroweak penguins may , however , underestimate their importance @xcite , and it is therefore highly desirable to find more advanced methods to deal with these topologies . similarly to our treatment of the rescattering effects , we also include the electroweak penguins in a completely general way in our formulae without making any approximation .",
    "as we will see below , in the case of the electroweak penguins it is , however , possible to improve their theoretical description considerably by using the relevant four - quark operators and the isospin symmetry of strong interactions to relate the corresponding hadronic matrix elements .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : in section  [ ampls ] we introduce a parametrization of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 decay amplitudes in terms of `` physical '' quantities , relying only on the phase structure of the standard model and the isospin symmetry of strong interactions .",
    "in particular , the usual terminology of `` tree '' and qcd penguin amplitudes to describe these decays is clarified . in section  [ gamma - det ]",
    "we discuss strategies to constrain and determine the ckm angle @xmath2 by using @xmath3 and @xmath4 decays .",
    "the bounds on @xmath2 derived in @xcite , making use of only the combined branching ratios ( [ br - char ] ) and ( [ br - neut ] ) , are generalized by taking into account in addition the cp - violating asymmetry arising in @xmath4 , and transparent formulae including both final - state interactions and electroweak penguins in a completely general way are presented . in section  [ fsi - effects ]",
    "we investigate the role of rescattering processes in these strategies and point out that the modes @xmath3 and @xmath5 allow us to include these effects in the bounds on @xmath2 completely by using the @xmath27 flavour symmetry .",
    "a detailed analysis of the electroweak penguin effects is performed in section  [ ewp - effects ] , where also an improved theoretical treatment of the corresponding contributions and a first step to constrain them experimentally with the help of the decay @xmath29 are presented .",
    "the combined effects of final - state interactions and electroweak penguins are discussed in section  [ comb - eff ] by considering a few selected examples , and the conclusions are summarized in section  [ conclu ] .",
    "the subject of this section is a general description of the decays @xmath3 and @xmath4 within the framework of the standard model . after a parametrization of their decay amplitudes ,",

    "let us have a closer look at the charged @xmath12 decay @xmath0 first .",
    "its transition amplitude can be written as @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 denote contributions from qcd and electroweak penguin topologies with internal @xmath33 quarks @xmath34 , respectively ; @xmath35 is related to annihilation topologies , and @xmath36 are the usual ckm factors . making use of the unitarity of the ckm matrix and applying the wolfenstein parametrization @xcite yields @xmath37{\\cal p}_{tc}\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath38 and @xmath39\\ ] ] with @xmath40 in these expressions , @xmath41 and @xmath42 denote cp - conserving strong phases , and the present status of the relevant ckm factors",

    "such contributions are absent in the case of @xmath10 , where these operators contribute only through insertions into penguin and annihilation topologies , which are described by @xmath49 and @xmath35 , respectively @xcite .    using the @xmath22 isospin symmetry , which implies the relations @xmath50 for the penguin topologies with internal charm and top quarks @xcite",

    "this feature is obvious since @xmath56 , usually referred to as a @xmath57 penguin amplitude , is _ defined _ through the @xmath10 decay amplitude given in ( [ bpampl ] ) .",
    "the combination @xmath58 is on the other hand _ defined _ through the sum of the @xmath10 and @xmath11 decay amplitudes and therefore also a `` physical '' quantity . since @xmath59 and @xmath60 describe two different ckm contributions related to the weak phase factors @xmath61 and @xmath62 , respectively , they are `` physical '' amplitudes as well . a similar comment applies to the quantities @xmath63 and @xmath64 parametrizing the @xmath10 decay amplitude in ( [ bpampl ] ) .",
    "let us note that @xmath59 is usually referred to as a `` tree '' amplitude . as can be seen in ( [ t - def ] )",
    ", @xmath59 actually receives not only such `` tree '' contributions corresponding to @xmath45 , but also contributions from annihilation and penguin topologies .      taking into account that the amplitude relations for the cp - conjugate modes can be obtained straightforwardly from the expressions given in subsection  [ dec - ampls ] by performing the substitution @xmath65 , and introducing the observables @xmath66 where @xmath67 as well as the cp - conserving strong phases @xmath68 we get the following expression for the ratio @xmath21 of combined branching ratios , which has been defined in  ( [ def - r ] ) : @xmath69}{\\sqrt{1 + 2\\,\\rho\\,\\cos\\theta\\cos\\gamma+\\rho^2}}+r^2}\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\,2\\,\\epsilon\\,\\frac{\\left[\\,\\cos\\delta+\\rho\\,\\cos(\\delta-\\theta)\\cos\\gamma \\,\\right]}{\\sqrt{1 + 2\\,\\rho\\,\\cos\\theta\\cos\\gamma+\\rho^2}}-2\\,r\\,\\epsilon\\ , \\cos(\\delta-\\delta)\\cos\\gamma+\\epsilon^2.\\label{r - exp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in order to determine @xmath2 , the `` pseudo - asymmetry '' @xmath70 turns out to be very useful @xcite .",

    "note that tiny phase - space effects have been neglected in ( [ r - exp ] ) and ( [ a0-exp ] ) ( for a more detailed discussion , see @xcite ) .",
    "the expressions given in ( [ r - eps - def])([r - exp ] ) are the correct generalization of the formulae derived in @xcite , where points ( ii ) and ( iii ) listed in section  [ intro ] have been assumed , i.e.@xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "they take into account both rescattering and electroweak penguin effects in a completely general way and make use only of the isospin symmetry of strong interactions . before we investigate these effects in detail in sections  [ fsi - effects ] and [ ewp - effects ] ,",
    "let us first discuss strategies to constrain and determine the ckm angle @xmath2 from these observables .",
    "the observables @xmath21 and @xmath75 provide valuable information about the ckm angle @xmath2 .",
    "a measurement of the asymmetry @xmath75 allows us to eliminate the cp - conserving strong phase @xmath76 in the ratio @xmath21 of combined @xmath9 branching ratios ( see ( [ r - exp ] ) and ( [ a0-exp ] ) ) . in the special case @xmath77",
    ", we get an expression for @xmath21 depending only on @xmath2 and @xmath78 . consequently ,",
    "if @xmath78 could be fixed , we would have a method to determine @xmath2 @xcite . while this approach was presented in @xcite as an approximate way to fix this angle , because of the model dependence introduced through @xmath78 , recent studies @xcite using arguments based on `` factorization '' came to the conclusion that a future theoretical uncertainty of @xmath78 as small as @xmath24 may be achievable . in that case",
    ", a determination of @xmath2 at future @xmath12 factories ( babar , belle , cleo iii ) employing this approach would be limited rather by statistics than by the uncertainty introduced through @xmath78 @xcite . in section  [ fsi - effects ] we will see that large contributions to @xmath9 decays from rescattering processes may affect @xmath78 severely , thereby shifting it significantly from its `` factorized '' value @xcite @xmath79\\times\\sqrt{\\left[\\frac{2.3\\times10^{-5}}{\\mbox{br}(b^\\pm   \\to \\pi^\\pm k)}\\right]\\times\\left[\\frac{\\tau_{b_u}}{1.6\\,\\mbox{ps}}\\right]}\\,.\\ ] ] here the relevant @xmath80 form factor obtained in the bsw model @xcite has been used and @xmath81 is the usual phenomenological colour factor @xcite .",
    "consequently a reliable determination of @xmath78 may be precluded by rescattering effects .",
    "as was pointed out in @xcite , the observable @xmath21 by itself may allow an interesting bound on @xmath2 , which does _ not _ require any information about @xmath78 .",
    "the idea is as follows : if one assumes @xmath77 and keeps both @xmath78 and the strong phase @xmath76 in the expression for @xmath21 as free `` unknown '' parameters , one finds that it takes a minimal value given by @xmath82 , i.e.  we have @xmath83 .",
    "consequently , if @xmath21 is found experimentally to be smaller than 1 , we get the allowed range ( [ gamma - bound1 ] ) for @xmath2 , with @xmath19 given by ( [ gam - max ] ) .    in this section",
    "we improve this bound in two respects by taking into account both rescattering and electroweak penguin effects , and the asymmetry @xmath75 .",
    "as we have already noted , this observable allows us to eliminate the strong phase @xmath76 in ( [ r - exp ] ) . to this end , we rewrite ( [ r - exp ] ) and ( [ a0-exp ] ) as @xmath84 and @xmath85 respectively , where the quantities @xmath86+\\epsilon^2\\ ] ] @xmath87 with @xmath88 and @xmath89 are independent of @xmath78 .",

    "@xmath21 as small as 0.65 , which is the central value of present cleo data , a large region around @xmath104 would be excluded .",
    "as soon as we have a non - vanishing experimental result for @xmath75 , also an interval around @xmath105 and @xmath106 can be ruled out , while the impact on the excluded region around @xmath8 is rather small , as can be seen in fig .",

    "in the formulae derived in the previous two sections , contributions from rescattering processes are included through the quantity @xmath63 introduced in ( [ rho - def ] ) .",
    "an important implication of @xmath99 and @xmath119 is direct cp violation in the mode @xmath10 , as can be seen in ( [ ap - def ] ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath120 describing the `` strength '' of the rescattering effects is , however , highly ckm - suppressed by @xmath121 . in ( [ rho - def ] ) , we have to distinguish between contributions from penguin topologies with internal top , charm and up quarks , and annihilation topologies .",
    "concerning the hierarchy of these contributions , the usual expectation is that annihilation processes play a very minor role and that penguins with internal top quarks are the most important ones . following these considerations",
    ", one would expect @xmath122 .",
    "however , also penguins with internal charm and up quarks lead in general to important contributions , which can not be neglected @xcite .",
    "model calculations performed at the perturbative quark - level to estimate these contributions give @xmath123 and do not indicate a significant compensation of the very large ckm suppression of @xmath120 .",
    "it has recently been discussed in @xcite that rescattering processes of the kind @xmath124 where @xmath125 , are related to penguin topologies with internal charm quarks , while rescattering processes of the kind @xmath126 where @xmath127 , are related to penguin topologies with internal up quarks and to annihilation topologies , which will be discussed below .",
    "these final - state - interaction effects , where channels originating from the current  current operators @xmath128 and @xmath129 through insertions into tree - diagram - like topologies are involved , can be considered as long - distance contributions to the amplitudes @xmath130 and @xmath49 , respectively , and are included this way in ( [ rho - def ] ) .",

    "is provided by the branching ratio for @xmath29 , as we have pointed out in subsection  [ ewp - app - det ] . in figs .",
    "[ fig : rminres - a1.ps ] and  [ fig : rminres - a2 ] we have assumed that @xmath365 takes a value of @xmath403 , which is of the same order of magnitude as the strength of colour suppression in @xmath329 and @xmath367 decays , and have kept @xmath364 as a free cp - conserving strong phase .    at this point",
    "we could give more examples to illustrate the possible impact of combined rescattering and electroweak penguin effects on information on the ckm angle @xmath2 obtained from @xmath9 decays . since it is now an easy exercise to play with the corresponding formulae , we will not consider other scenarios in this paper . hopefully , improved experimental data will be available in the near future , allowing us to go beyond these selected examples and to perform a solid analysis of the corresponding decays .",
    "in summary , we have presented a general parametrization of the @xmath0 and @xmath11 decay amplitudes within the framework of the standard model in terms of `` physical quantities '' , taking into account both rescattering and electroweak penguin effects .",
    "these decays offer an experimentally feasible way to obtain direct information on the ckm angle @xmath2 at planned @xmath12 factories , which will start operating in the near future , and are therefore of particular phenomenological interest . in this respect , the ratio @xmath21 of their combined branching ratios and the pseudo - asymmetry @xmath75 play the key role .",
    "as soon as these observables , i.e.  the branching ratios for @xmath0 , @xmath11 and their charge - conjugates , have been measured , contours in the @xmath2@xmath78 plane can be calculated with the help of the formulae derived in this paper .",
    "these contours imply allowed ranges for both @xmath78 and @xmath2 . for @xmath404 ,",
    "values of @xmath2 within intervals around @xmath108 and @xmath106 can be excluded , and if @xmath21 should turn out to be smaller than 1 , also values around @xmath8 can be ruled out . in particular",
    "the latter case is of particular interest , since the corresponding range for @xmath2 would then be complementary to its presently allowed range obtained from the usual fits of the unitarity triangle",
    ". if @xmath78 could be fixed by using an additional input , @xmath2 could not only be constrained , but determined up to a four - fold ambiguity .    in order to derive these bounds and to obtain the contours in the @xmath2@xmath78 plane ,",
    "isospin symmetry has been used , which is certainly an excellent working assumption .",
    "the theoretical cleanliness is , however , limited by certain rescattering and electroweak penguin effects .",
    "our formulae include these contributions in a completely general way , and therefore allow us to investigate the sensitivity to these effects and to take them into account by using additional experimental information .",
    "the rescattering processes may lead to sizeable cp violation in @xmath0 , possibly as large as @xmath24 .",
    "we have pointed out that such cp asymmetries would provide a lower bound on @xmath120 , i.e.   a first constraint on the strength of the rescattering effects , and are useful to include these final - state interactions in the bounds on @xmath2 . in order to control the rescattering effects in these bounds , @xmath180 may be a `` gold - plated '' mode .",
    "it can be related to @xmath405 with the help of the @xmath27 flavour symmetry and provides sufficient information not just to constrain , but to take into account the final - state interaction effects in the bounds on @xmath2 completely . as a by - product",
    ", this strategy gives moreover an allowed region for @xmath120 , and excludes values of @xmath2 within ranges around @xmath108 and @xmath106 .",
    "it is interesting to note that @xmath27 breaking enters in this approach only at the `` next - to - leading order '' level , as it represents a correction to the correction to the bounds on @xmath2 arising from rescattering processes .",
    "moreover this strategy works also if the cp asymmetry in @xmath0 should turn out to be very small . in this case there",
    "may also be large rescattering effects , which would then not be signalled by sizeable cp violation in this channel .    at first sight ,",
    "an experimental study of @xmath406 appears to be challenging , since model estimates performed at the perturbative quark level give a combined branching ratio br@xmath407 , which is one order of magnitude below the present upper limit obtained by the cleo collaboration .",
    "however , as we have pointed out in this paper , rescattering processes may well enhance this branching ratio by @xmath6 , so that it may actually be much closer to the cleo limit than navely expected .",
    "consequently , in the case of large rescattering contributions , i.e.  when we have to take them into account in the bounds on @xmath2 , the branching ratio for the decay allowing us to accomplish this task , @xmath406 , may be significantly enhanced through these very rescattering effects , so that this strategy should be feasible at future @xmath12 factories .    although the decay @xmath406 allows us to determine the shift of the contours in the @xmath2@xmath78 plane arising from rescattering processes , it does not allow us to take into account these effects also in the determination of @xmath2 , requiring some knowledge on @xmath78 , in contrast to the @xmath2 bounds .",
    "this quantity is not just the ratio of a `` tree '' to a `` penguin '' amplitude , which is the usual terminology in the literature , but has a rather complex structure and may be considerably affected by final - state interactions .",
    "consequently , in the case of large rescattering effects , @xmath78 is expected to be shifted significantly from its `` factorized '' value and its theoretical uncertainty is very hard to control .",
    "interestingly , the small present central value @xmath114 implies a range for @xmath78 that is at the edge of compatibility with these `` factorized '' results and favours larger values of @xmath78 .",
    "this feature may already give us a first hint that rescattering effects play in fact an important role , and it may well be that future experimental results for @xmath21 will stabilize at the 0.65 level .",
    "in this case , a measurement of br@xmath408 and large cp violation in this channel would not be a surprise .",
    "in the recent literature it has been claimed by some authors that such rescattering processes would spoil the bounds on @xmath2 .",
    "it is interesting to note that these effects may actually be responsible for a strong realization of these bounds , i.e.  for a small value of @xmath21 , thereby making them phenomenologically relevant .",
    "concerning electroweak penguins , model calculations using `` factorization '' to deal with hadronic matrix elements typically give contributions at the @xmath409 level in the case of @xmath0 and @xmath11 decays , where electroweak penguins contribute only in `` colour - suppressed '' form . in this paper , we have presented an improved theoretical description of the electroweak penguin amplitude affecting the isospin relations between the decay amplitudes of these modes , and have derived a transparent expression , clarifying also the notion of `` colour - suppressed '' electroweak penguins .",
    "our approach does not use questionable assumptions , such as factorization , and makes use of only the general structure of the electroweak penguin operators and of the isospin symmetry of strong interactions to relate the hadronic matrix elements corresponding to @xmath0 and @xmath11 transitions .",
    "we have seen that the importance of electroweak penguins is closely related to the ratio of certain `` effective '' colour factors @xmath410 .",
    "using @xmath411 gives an enhancement of the relevant electroweak penguin amplitude by a factor of  3 with respect to the factorized result . a first step towards constraining this electroweak penguin amplitude experimentally is provided by the mode @xmath29 .",
    "our formulae include the electroweak penguin contributions in a completely general way , allowing us to take them into account once we have a better understanding of `` colour - suppression '' and rescattering effects in @xmath9 decays .",
    "although the decays @xmath0 , @xmath11 and their charge conjugates will probably not allow a precision measurement of @xmath2 , they are expected to provide a very fertile ground to constrain this ckm angle .",
    "an accurate measurement of these modes , as well as of @xmath5 , is therefore an important goal of the future @xmath12 factories .",
    "the corresponding experimental results will certainly be very exciting .",
