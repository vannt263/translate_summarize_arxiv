    "the two - level system coupled to a single bosonic mode ( rabi hamiltonian @xcite ) is probably one of the best studied models for the interaction of matter with light @xcite .",

    "quantum optics usually deals with _ closed _ two - level systems where the total electron number on individual atoms remains constant and does not fluctuate during the interaction with the photon .",
    "this restriction can be lifted in semiconductor quantum dots ( artificial atoms ) by tunnel coupling to electron reservoirs .",
    "for example , in semiconductor cavity quantum electrodynamics @xcite the interaction of light with excitons can be steered by ` pumping ' the cavity by resonant tunneling of electrons and holes .    in this paper",

    "we investigate the stationary electron transport through a double quantum dot coupled to electron reservoirs and a single photon or phonon mode .",
    "the main idea is to control the density matrix of the coupled dot - boson system by external parameters such as the reservoir chemical potentials and the tunnel couplings .",
    "these parameters ( which in experiments can be controlled via gate voltages ) then determine the reduced density operators of the dot and the boson and allow one , e.g. , to modify the state of the boson by driving a stationary electron current through the dots .",

    "have been found to be due to _ phonons _ rather than photons .",
    "in fact , the importance of electron - phonon coupling for transport in coupled dots is well - established by now @xcite .",
