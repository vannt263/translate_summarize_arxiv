    "many - body effects , effects of coulomb interaction between itinerant electrons beyond the mean - field approximation , are important to discuss electronic properties  @xcite .",
    "when the coulomb interaction is very small compared with the bandwidth of itinerant electrons , which is of the order of magnitude @xmath8 ev , we can sufficiently describe its effects in the mean - field approximation as the static and effectively single - body potentials  @xcite .",
    "however , in correlated electron systems such as transition metals or transition - metal oxides , the coulomb interaction becomes moderately strong or strong , resulting in the derivations of their electronic properties from the single - body picture  @xcite .    for several correlated electron systems ,",
    "many - body effects can be described in landau s fermi - liquid ( fl ) theory  @xcite .",
    "this theory is based on two basic assumptions  @xcite .",
    "one is the one - to - one correspondence between the noninteracting and the interacting systems . because of this assumption",
    ", we can describe low - energy excitations of the interacting system in terms of quasiparticles ( qps ) with the renormalized effective mass and the renormalized interactions described by the landau parameters  @xcite .",
    "the other assumption is lack of the temperature dependence of the landau parameters .",
    "because of this assumption , the temperature dependence of the electronic properties remains the same as that in the noninteracting system  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , as a result of those assumptions , many - body effects on the electronic properties are the changes of their coefficients due to the mass enhancement or the fl correction or both  @xcite .",
    "actually , landau s fl theory well describes several electronic properties of sr@xmath4ruo@xmath5 at low temperatures .",
    "first , this theory can explain the almost temperature - independent spin susceptibility  @xcite and the @xmath9 dependence of the inplane resistivity  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the importance of many - body effects has been suggested in the measurements of the de haas - van alphen ( dhva ) effect  @xcite and the wilson ratio  @xcite : the effective mass of the @xmath10 or the @xmath11 orbital measured in the dhva becomes , respectively , @xmath12 or @xmath13 times as large as the mass obtained in the local - density approximation ( lda ) , a mean - field - type approximation ; the wilson ratio , the ratio of the spin susceptibility to the coefficient of the electronic specific heat , becomes @xmath14 times as large as the noninteracting value .",
    "note that the enhancement of the wilson ratio arises from the fl correction  @xcite .    however , we observe non - fl - like behaviors , the deviations from the temperature dependence expected in landau s fl theory , for correlated electron systems near a magnetic quantum - critical point ( qcp )  @xcite .",
    "for example ,",
    "sr@xmath4ru@xmath6ti@xmath7o@xmath5 , a paramagnetic ( pm ) ruthenate near an antiferromagnetic ( af ) qcp , shows the curie - weiss - type temperature dependence of the spin susceptibility and the @xmath15-linear inplane resistivity  @xcite . also , ca@xmath16sr@xmath17ruo@xmath5 around @xmath18 , a pm ruthenate near a ferromagnetic qcp , shows the similar non - fl - like behaviors  @xcite .",
    "thus , those experimental results indicate the importance of many - body effects beyond landau s fl theory near a magnetic qcp .",
    "note , first , that the wave vector of the spin susceptibility enhanced most strongly in sr@xmath4ru@xmath6ti@xmath7o@xmath5  @xcite is the same for sr@xmath4ruo@xmath5  @xcite , i.e. @xmath19 ; second , that ti substitution does not cause any ruo@xmath20 distortions  @xcite , while ca substitution causes ruo@xmath20 distortions such as the rotation and the tilting  @xcite , which drastically affect the electronic structure  @xcite .    among correlated electron systems ,",
    "the ruthenates are suitable to deduce general or characteristic aspects of many - body effects in correlated multiorbital systems because of the following three advantages .",
    "the first advantage is that the ruthenates show the fl or the non - fl - like behaviors , depending on the chemical composition or the crystal structure or both  @xcite . due to this advantage",
    ", we can study how the fl state is realized and how the system changes from the fl state to the non - fl - like state , and we may obtain their general or characteristic properties . then , the second advantage is that the ruthenates are the @xmath2-orbital systems with moderately strong electron correlation  @xcite .",
    "this has been established for sr@xmath4ruo@xmath5 by three facts : the ru @xmath2 orbitals are the main components of the density - of - states ( dos ) near the fermi level in the lda  @xcite ; the lda  @xcite can reproduce the topology of the fermi surface ( fs ) observed experimentally  @xcite ; the experimentally estimated value of @xmath21 , onsite intraorbital coulomb interaction , is about @xmath22 ev  @xcite , which is half of the bandwidth for the @xmath2 orbitals in the lda  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the second advantage , the third advantage is the simple electronic structure  @xcite compared with the other multiorbital systems . due to the second and the third advantage , we can simply analyze many - body effects of a correlated multiorbital system , and that analysis may lead to a deep understanding of the general or characteristic aspects of the many - body effects .    to describe many - body effects near a magnetic qcp , we need to use the theories that can satisfactorily take account of the effects of the critical electron - hole scattering arising from the characteristic spin fluctuation of that qcp .",
    "if the system approaches a magnetic qcp , we observe the enhancement of the spin fluctuation for the wave vector characteristic of that qcp  @xcite .",
    "that enhancement causes the strong temperature dependent critical electron - hole scattering mediated by the spin fluctuation .",
    "then , that critical electron - hole scattering results in the emergence of both the hot spot of the qp damping and the curie - weiss - type temperature dependence of the reducible four - point vertex function for the momenta connected by the spin fluctuation . ( note that the reducible four - point vertex function describes the multiple electron - hole scattering  @xcite . )",
    "thus , the emergence of the former violates the first basic assumption of landau s fl theory since at the hot spot the qp lifetime is not so sufficiently long as to realize an approximate eigenstate as landau s fl  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the latter violates the second basic assumption because the temperature dependence of the reducible four - point vertex function and mass enhancement factor determines the temperature dependence of the landau parameter  @xcite .",
    "thus , many - body effects near a magnetic qcp may be described by the theories beyond landau s fl theory if the theories can satisfactorily treat the strongly enhanced temperature - dependent spin fluctuation",
    ".    actually , several non - fl - like behaviors near a magnetic qcp can be reproduced in fluctuation - exchange ( flex ) approximation  @xcite with the current vertex corrections ( cvcs ) arising from the self - energy ( @xmath3 ) and the maki - thompson ( mt ) irreducible four - point vertex function  @xcite due to electron correlation  @xcite .",
    "for example , this theory shows the curie - weiss - type temperature dependence of both the spin susceptibility and the hall coefficient and the @xmath15-linear inplane resistivity for a single - orbital hubbard model on a square lattice in a pm state near an af qcp , where the spin fluctuation for @xmath23 is enhanced  @xcite .",
    "those results are consistent with the experiments of cuprates  @xcite .",
    "since the powerfulness of the flex approximation near a magnetic qcp arises from its satisfactory treatment of the momentum and temperature dependence of spin fluctuations  @xcite , the similar applicability will hold even for a multiorbital hubbard model on a square lattice .",
    "since the effects of the cvcs due to electron - electron interaction in a correlated multiorbital system had been unclear , i studied several electronic properties of an effective model of several ruthenates , a @xmath2-orbital hubbard model on a square lattice in a pm state away from or near an af qcp , in the flex approximation with the @xmath3 cvc and the mt cvc  @xcite , and then i obtained satisfactory agreement with several experiments and three important aspects of many - body effects on the charge transports .",
    "first , the results away from the af qcp qualitatively agree with five experimental results of sr@xmath4ruo@xmath5 , ( i ) the strongest enhancement of spin fluctuation  @xcite at @xmath19 , ( ii ) the nearly temperature - independent spin susceptibility  @xcite , ( iii ) the larger mass enhancement  @xcite of the @xmath11 orbital than that of the @xmath10 orbital , ( iv ) the @xmath9 dependence of the inplane resistivity at low temperatures  @xcite , and ( v ) the non - monotonic temperature dependence of the hall coefficient  @xcite .",
    "note that the hall coefficient observed in sr@xmath4ruo@xmath5 shows the following non - monotonic temperature dependence  @xcite : at high temperatures above @xmath24k , the hall coefficient is small and negative with a slight increase with decreasing temperature ; after crossing over zero at @xmath24k , the hall coefficient becomes positive with keeping an increase , and shows a peak at about @xmath25k ; below about @xmath25k , the hall coefficient monotonically decreases with decreasing temperature .",
    "then , the results near the af qcp can qualitatively explain three experimental results of sr@xmath4ru@xmath6ti@xmath7o@xmath5 , ( i ) the strongest enhancement of spin fluctuation  @xcite at @xmath19 , ( ii ) the curie - weiss - type temperature dependence of the spin susceptibility  @xcite , and ( iii ) the @xmath15-linear inplane resistivity  @xcite . in this comparison ,",
    "i assume that the main effect of ti substitution is approaching the af qcp compared with sr@xmath4ruo@xmath5 .",
    "note that the measurement of the hall coefficient in sr@xmath4ru@xmath6ti@xmath7o@xmath5 has been restricted at very low temperature  @xcite , which is out of the region i considered .",
    "moreover , i revealed the realization of the orbital - dependent transports , the emergence of a peak of the temperature dependence of the hall coefficient , and the absence of the curie - weiss - type temperature dependence of the hall coefficient near the af qcp .",
    "however , the previous studies  @xcite contain two remaining issues .",
    "one is to clarify many - body effects of the aslamasov - larkin ( al ) cvc , the cvc arising from the al irreducible four - point vertex function  @xcite . in the previous studies",
    "@xcite , i neglected the al cvc in the flex approximation for simplicity since in a single - orbital hubbard model  @xcite on a square lattice the al cvc does not qualitatively change the results of the resistivity and hall coefficient near an af qcp and since the similar property would hold even in a multiorbital hubbard model on a square lattice not far away from an af qcp .",
    "however , it is necessary and important to analyze the effects of the al cvc in that multiorbital hubbard model since both the mt and the al cvc are essential to hold conservation laws exactly  @xcite . in particular , that analysis is needed not only to check the validity neglecting the al cvc for qualitative discussions but also to clarify many - body effects of the al cvc .",
    "the other remaining issue is to give the comprehensive explanations about the formal derivations both of the transport coefficients in the extended liashberg theory  @xcite to a multiorbital system and of the cvcs in the flex approximation for a multiorbital hubbard model .",
    "my previous study  @xcite reported a microscopic study about the effects of the cvcs due to electron correlation in a multiorbital system . in the previous studies",
    "@xcite , however , i just gave brief explanations about those formal derivations .",
    "thus , it is desirable to explain the detail of those formal derivations since those will be useful to adopt the same or similar method to the transport properties of other correlated electron systems .    in this paper , after formulating the dc longitudinal and the dc transverse conductivities in the extended liashberg theory to a multiorbital hubbard model in the flex approximation with the cvcs , i study the effects of the main terms of the al cvc on the in - plane resistivity and the hall coefficient for the quasi - two - dimensional pm ruthenates near and away from the af qcp . as the main results ,",
    "i show the qualitative validity of the main results of the previous studies  @xcite , the existence of two almost distinct regions of the charge transports near the af qcp as a function of temperature , and the different effects of the mt cvc on the low - temperature values of the in - plane resistivity and hall coefficient away from the af qcp in the presence of the @xmath3 cvc , the mt cvc , and the main terms of the al cvc .",
    "i also present several results of the magnetic properties and the electronic structure , and show four main results about each of the magnetic properties and the electronic structure .",
    "those are useful for deeper understanding than in the previous studies  @xcite .",

    "third , in contrast to @xmath155 , @xmath177 is inversely proportional to the square of the qp damping .",

    "fourth , the orbital dependence of the effective interaction is determined by the orbital dependence of the spin fluctuation .",
    "we first determine the dominant fluctuations in the present model . for that purpose",
    ", we analyze the effects of electron correlation on @xmath305 and @xmath306 , the inverses of the maximum eigenvalues  @xcite of @xmath307 and @xmath308 , respectively .",
    "this is because by analyzing the dependence of @xmath305 and @xmath306 on @xmath21 and @xmath81 , we can determine the dominant fluctuations among four kinds of fluctuations , i.e. charge fluctuations , spin fluctuations , orbital fluctuations , and spin - orbital - combined fluctuations  @xcite ( for more details see appendix h ) .",
    "i show @xmath305 and @xmath306 at @xmath309 ev and @xmath296 ev for several values of @xmath81 in figs .",
    "[ fig : fig8](a ) and [ fig : fig8](b ) , respectively .",
    "we see that as @xmath81 increases , @xmath305 monotonically decreases , and @xmath306 monotonically increases .",
    "this behavior is characteristic of the enhancement of spin fluctuations and the suppression of the charge fluctuations  @xcite ( see appendix h ) .",
    "the similar results are obtained at @xmath310 ev , as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : fig8](c ) and [ fig : fig8](d ) . since approaching",
    "the inverse of the maximum eigenvalue towards zero characterizes the enhancement of the susceptibility , the results in figs .",
    "[ fig : fig8](a)[fig : fig8](d ) show that spin fluctuations are dominant at @xmath296 and @xmath297 ev in the present model .",
    "this can be understood by considering the following three facts : the noninteracting susceptibility for @xmath311 and @xmath312 , @xmath313 , becomes very large in the present model since @xmath314 is larger than @xmath315 for @xmath316 due to the large intraorbital hopping integrals compared with the interorbital ones ; the interactions between the different kinds of fluctuations may be generally very weak in the flex approximation due to lack of the vertex corrections of the susceptibilities ; the terms arising from @xmath21 cause the strongest enhancement of the susceptibilities .",

    "the result shows that as @xmath21 increases , the spin fluctuation at @xmath304 is most strongly enhanced and the enhancement at @xmath326 is much weaker .",
    "that strongest enhancement can be understood as the combination of the merging of the nesting vectors of the @xmath10 and @xmath11 orbitals around @xmath304 due to the mode - mode coupling for the spin fluctuations around @xmath304 and the nesting instability at @xmath304 due to the rpa - type scattering process , as explained in ref . .",

    "we see that not only the diagonal but also the non - diagonal components are enhanced , and that the largest component is the diagonal one of the @xmath11 orbital .",
    "first , the enhancement of the diagonal components arises from the combination of the large diagonal components of the noninteracting susceptibility of the @xmath2 orbitals around @xmath304 , the merging of the nesting vectors of the @xmath10 and the @xmath11 orbital around @xmath304 , and the larger enhancement due to the terms arising from @xmath21 than the other terms .",

    "( [ eq : flex-2 ] ) ] .",
    "then , the diagonal component of the @xmath11 orbital becomes largest due to the following three properties : the diagonal components of the noninteracting susceptibility are larger than the non - diagonal components due to the large intraorbital hopping integrals ; the noninteracting susceptibility of the @xmath11 orbital is larger than that of the @xmath10 orbital due to the larger dos  @xcite of the @xmath11 orbital ; the enhancement due to the terms arising from @xmath21 is largest in the terms arising from the hubbard interaction terms .",
    "finally , we see the effect of the spin fluctuations on the imaginary part of the retarded effective interaction of the flex approximation .",
    "the reason why that effect is analyzed is that its understanding is useful to understand the effect of the spin fluctuations on the mt cvc since the imaginary part of the retarded effective interaction is part of the kernel of the mt cvc [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : lamb - flex - mt ] ) ] . for that analysis",
    ", it is sufficient to present @xmath333 since the other orbital components are much less important .",
    "this is due to the facts that the dominant fluctuations are the spin fluctuations and that their contributions to the effective interaction , @xmath334 , are given by @xmath335 [ see eq .",

    "second , the mass enhancement of the @xmath11 orbital is larger than that of the @xmath10 orbital in a wide region of the parameter space in the present model .",
    "third , the unrenormalized qp damping of the @xmath11 orbital becomes larger than that of the @xmath10 orbital .",
    "fourth , the orbital dependence of the qp damping is mainly determined by the orbital dependence of the unrenormalized qp damping .",
    "i begin with the effects of the real part of the self - energy in the flex approximation on the fs and the mass enhancement factor .",
    "i determine the fs by diagonalizing @xmath339 $ ] , where @xmath57 in @xmath53 has been determined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : mu - int ] ) .",
    "first , we see from figs . [",
    "fig : fig12](a ) and [ fig : fig12](b ) how the fs is modified with increasing @xmath21 .",
    "those figures show that the modification is slight .",
    "thus , the real part of the self - energy in the flex approximation does not change the topology of the fs sheets ( i.e. , whether each sheet is electron - like or hole - like ) .",
    "this result can be understood by considering two facts that the occupation numbers of the @xmath10 and the @xmath11 orbital do not become very close to integers , and that the van hove singularity of the @xmath11 orbital does not cross over the fermi level .",
    "note , first , that the occupation numbers of the @xmath10 and the @xmath11 orbitals are @xmath340 and @xmath341 , respectively , at @xmath296 and @xmath297 ev ; second , that if the van hove singularity crosses over the fermi level , the @xmath75 sheet touches the boundary of the brillouin zone at @xmath342 or @xmath343 .",
    "next , we show the mass enhancement factor , @xmath344 , at @xmath296 and @xmath297 ev in figs . [",
    "fig : fig13](a)[fig : fig13](d ) . from those figures",
    ", we find three properties about the orbital , temperature , and momentum dependences of @xmath345 .",
    "the first property is that the mass enhancement of the @xmath11 orbital is always larger than that of the @xmath10 orbital for all the temperatures considered .",
    "this arises from the stronger spin fluctuations of the @xmath11 orbital than those of the @xmath10 orbital , as explained in ref . .",
    "combining this result with the similar orbital dependence  @xcite of @xmath345 as a function of @xmath81 ( in @xmath295 at @xmath309 ev and @xmath296 ev ) , we deduce that the larger mass enhancement of the @xmath11 orbital is realized in a wide region of the parameter space of the present model for a pm state in the flex approximation .",
    "it should be noted that although the spin fluctuations of the @xmath11 orbital enhance @xmath345 of not only the @xmath11 orbital but also the @xmath10 orbital , the enhancement for the @xmath11 is larger in a realistic set of the hubbard interaction terms .",
    "this is because the spin fluctuations of an orbital cause the enhancement of @xmath345 of the orbital proportional to the @xmath346 terms of @xmath347 in @xmath348 in @xmath349 , and the enhancement of @xmath345 of another orbital proportional to the @xmath350 terms .",
    "then , the second property found in figs .",
    "[ fig : fig13](a)[fig : fig13](d ) is that the temperature dependence is weak other than the case for the @xmath11 orbital at @xmath310 ev .",
    "this results from the more significant enhancement of the spin fluctuations of the @xmath11 orbital with decreasing temperature [ see figs .",
    "[ fig : fig10](a)[fig : fig10](d ) ] , and suggests that the mass enhancement of the @xmath11 orbital may remain larger even at lower temperatures than the temperatures considered . the third property of figs .",
    "[ fig : fig13](a)[fig : fig13](d ) is that the momentum dependence is negligible for the @xmath10 orbital , while the @xmath11 orbital has the weak momentum dependence .",
    "this is due to the difference between the quasi - one - dimensionality of the @xmath10 orbital and the quasi - two - dimensionality of the @xmath11 orbital : only the @xmath11 orbital has the van hove singularity due to the saddle points at @xmath351 and @xmath352 , resulting in a larger mass enhancement  @xcite . since this result shows that the momentum dependence of the mass enhancement factor is not important to discuss the magnitude difference of the mass enhancement , the present analysis is sufficient for that discussion .",
    "then , we turn to the effects of the imaginary of the self - energy on the unrenormalized qp damping , @xmath353 . from the results shown in figs . [ fig : fig14](a)[fig : fig14](d ) , we see three main features .",
    "the first one is about the orbital dependence : the magnitude for the @xmath11 orbital is about three times as large as that for the @xmath10 orbital .",
    "this arises mainly from the larger dos and stronger spin fluctuations of the @xmath11 orbital .",
    "note , first , that a ratio of the noninteracting doss of the @xmath11 and the @xmath10 orbitals on the fermi level is about @xmath354  @xcite ; second , that due to the similar reasons for @xmath345 , the spin fluctuations of the @xmath11 orbital cause a larger enhancement of @xmath355 of the @xmath11 orbital in a realistic set of the hubbard interaction terms .",
    "the second main feature is about the temperature dependence : the unrenormalized qp dampings of the @xmath10 orbital at @xmath296 ev show the @xmath9 dependence at low temperatures ; the @xmath356 dependence of @xmath355 for the @xmath10 orbital is realized for @xmath357 at @xmath310 ev ; the unrenormalized qp damping of the @xmath11 orbital at @xmath358 is proportional to @xmath15 linear at @xmath296 and @xmath297 ev . the @xmath9 dependence is due to the formation of long - lived qps  @xcite ; the @xmath356 dependence results from the hot - spot structure  @xcite due to the enhanced af spin fluctuation , as explained in ref . ; the @xmath15-linear behavior emerges as a result of the existence of the van hove singularity  @xcite .",
    "the third main feature is about the momentum dependence : the unrenormalized qp damping of the @xmath11 orbital depends weakly on momentum ; the momentum dependence for the @xmath10 orbital is negligible .",
    "this arises from the considerable difference in the momentum dependence of the single - particle spectrum function due to the existence of the van hove singularity only for the @xmath11 orbital .",
    "finally , we analyze the effects of the combination of the real and the imaginary part of the self - energy on the qp damping , @xmath359 . from the results shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : fig15](a)[fig : fig15](d ) , we see that even for the qp damping , the larger magnitude for the @xmath11 orbital is realized .",
    "this is due to the larger difference in the unrenormalized qp damping compared with the difference in the mass enhancement factor , and suggests that the qps of the @xmath10 orbital are more coherent than the qps of the @xmath11 orbital in the present model .",
    "in addition , we find the @xmath9 dependence for the @xmath10 orbital at low temperatures at @xmath296 ev , the deviation from the @xmath9 dependence for the @xmath10 orbital at @xmath310 ev , and the similar momentum dependence of the qp damping to that of the unrenormalized qp damping .      in this section ,",
    "i show three main results about the transport properties .",
    "first , the main results in the previous studies  @xcite remain qualitatively unchanged even including the main terms of the al cvc .",
    "second , the temperature dependences of @xmath0 and @xmath1 near the af qcp consist of two regions , high - temperature region , where only the @xmath3 cvc is sufficient , and low - temperature region , where only both the @xmath3 cvc and the mt cvc are sufficient .",
    "third , in contrast to the case near the af qcp , the effects of the mt cvc on @xmath0 and @xmath1 at low temperatures are different in case away from the af qcp : only for @xmath1 , the effects are considerable .",
    "to analyze the main effects of the al cvc on @xmath0 and @xmath1 , we consider four cases , named mt@xmath360al cvc case , mt cvc case , @xmath3 cvc case , and no cvc case . in the mt@xmath360al cvc case , we take account of the @xmath3 cvc , the mt cvc , and the main terms of the al cvc : @xmath148 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lamb - flex - full ] ) includes those cvcs , and @xmath361 in eq .",

    "the inset shows @xmath0 against @xmath9 below @xmath362 ev .",
    ", width=283 ]         at @xmath310 ev and @xmath294 in the four cases .",
    ", width=283 ]        we begin with @xmath363 away from the af qcp .",
    "we show the temperature dependence of @xmath0 at @xmath296 ev in the four cases in fig . [",
    "fig : fig16 ] , and find two main features .",
    "one is that the @xmath9 dependence below @xmath364 ev holds even in the mt@xmath360al cvc case .",
    "this can be understood that the cvcs little affect the power of the temperature dependence of the resistivity .",
    "this is because the main effects of the cvcs on the resistivity arise from the magnitude changes of the current [ see sect .",
    "ii b 1 ] and because the magnitude changes appear in the equation of the resistivity as @xmath365 , where @xmath366 is not large .",
    "the other main feature is that the value of @xmath0 in the mt@xmath360al cvc case becomes smaller than that in the mt cvc case and nearly the same as that in the @xmath3 cvc case .",
    "this is due to the small effects of the mt and the al cvc ; for high - temperature region , the small effects arise from the dominance of the qp damping compared with the spin susceptibility in determining the kernels of those cvcs ; for low - temperature region , the small effects arise from the combination of the not large spin susceptibility and the partial cancellation between the effects of the mt and the al cvc .",
    "the more detailed explanations about those are as follows : in discussing the effects of the mt and the al cvc , the relative values of the spin susceptibility and the qp damping are important since the kernels of the mt and the al cvc contain the spin susceptibility and the inverse of the qp damping [ see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : lamb - flex - full])([eq : lamb - flex - al2 ] ) ] . due to this property , at high temperatures , the kernels become small since the qp damping is large ; thus , the effects of the mt and the al cvc are small for high - temperature region . furthermore , although the effects of the mt and the al cvc are separately non - negligible at low temperatures since with decreasing temperature the qp damping decreases and the spin susceptibility remains almost unchanged , the effects of the al cvc reduce the effects of the mt cvc as a result of the difference in the momentum dependence ; due to this reduction , the total effects of the mt and the al cvc are small . such property due to the difference in the momentum dependence",
    "can be easily seen from a simple and sufficient case of the second - order perturbation theory for a single - orbital system since the momentum structure of each diagram of the mt , al1 , and al2 terms remains the same as in the flex approximation : in this case , the mt cvc is given by @xmath367 , and the al1 and al2 cvcs are @xmath368 $ ] ( for more details , see ref . ) ; since @xmath369 is odd about momentum , the difference in the sign of @xmath41 leads to the partial cancellation of the effects of the mt and the al cvc .",
    "we next discuss the role of each @xmath2 orbital in determining @xmath0 away from the af qcp .",
    "for that purpose , i show the orbital - decomposed components of @xmath155 , the @xmath370 component and the @xmath11 component ; the former is obtained by replacing @xmath371 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigmaxx - approx ] ) by @xmath372 , and the latter is obtained by replacing @xmath371 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigmaxx - approx ] ) by @xmath373 . as explained in ref .",
    ", only those components are sufficient in the present model since those ( diagonal ) components are larger than the non - diagonal ones due to the large intraorbital hopping integrals compared with the interorbital hopping integrals .",
    "first , we see from fig . [",
    "fig : fig18](a ) that @xmath374 is determined almost by the component of the @xmath10 orbital , and that the contributions from the component of the @xmath11 orbital are very small .",
    "namely , the @xmath370 component remains dominant even with the main terms of the al cvc .",
    "we also see from figs .",
    "[ fig : fig18](b ) and [ fig : fig18](c ) that the values in the mt@xmath360al cvc case are nearly the same in the @xmath3 cvc case .",
    "thus , the @xmath3 cvc is sufficient for discussions about the orbital dependence away from the af qcp .    from the results at @xmath296 ev , we deduce , first , that the main results obtained in the previous studies  @xcite away from the af qcp , the @xmath9 dependence of @xmath0 at low temperatures and the dominance of the @xmath10 orbital , remain qualitatively the same even with the main terms of the al cvc ; second ,",
    "that the resistivity away from the af qcp can be almost well described by taking account of only the @xmath3 cvc .",
    "then , i turn to @xmath0 near the af qcp . from its temperature dependence shown in fig . [",
    "fig : fig19 ] , we see three main features about @xmath0 in the mt@xmath360al cvc case .",
    "first , @xmath0 in the mt@xmath360al cvc case shows the @xmath15-linear dependence , which is similar for the other three cases .",
    "this origin is the same for the other three cases  @xcite , i.e. the @xmath356 dependence of the unrenormalized qp damping of the @xmath10 orbital around @xmath357 , since the cvcs little affect the power of the temperature dependence of @xmath0 and since the @xmath370 component remains dominant even with the main terms of the al cvc [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig20](a ) ] .",
    "second , the values of @xmath0 in the mt@xmath360al cvc case at high temperatures are nearly the same as those in the @xmath3 cvc case at the corresponding temperatures .",
    "this is due to the same reason as that away from the af qcp .",
    "third , as temperature decreases , the value of @xmath0 in the mt@xmath360al cvc case approaches the value in the mt cvc case .",
    "this can be understood by combining two facts that the mt and the al cvcs separately becomes non - negligible at low temperatures , and that the al cvc near the af qcp is negligible compared with the mt cvc in the presence of the even - parity symmetry and rotational symmetry .",
    "the mechanism of the former fact explained above , and the mechanism of the latter explained by the authors of ref . .",
    "the explanations about the latter are as follows : when the system approaches an af qcp characterized by spin fluctuation at @xmath375 , that spin fluctuation gives the leading contributions to the mt , al@xmath8 , and al@xmath22 cvcs through @xmath376 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lamb - flex - mt ] ) and @xmath276 in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : lamb - flex - al1-simple ] ) and ( [ eq : lamb - flex - al2-simple ] ) , respectively",
    ". then , although the mt cvc becomes more important near the af qcp , the al@xmath8 and al@xmath22 cvcs become little important compared with the mt cvc near the af qcp due to the cancellation between the contributions from @xmath154 and @xmath377 arising from the spin fluctuation at @xmath375 .",
    "this cancellation is because in the terms of the al@xmath8 or al@xmath22 cvc only @xmath378 is odd about momentum ( i.e. , the others are even ) due to the even - parity symmetry and because the states at @xmath379 and @xmath380 are equivalent due to the rotational symmetry .",
    "moreover , we determine the role of each @xmath2 orbital in determining @xmath0 near the af qcp from the results of the orbital - decomposed components of @xmath155 .",
    "figure [ fig : fig20](a ) shows that the main terms of the al cvc keep the dominance of the @xmath370 component unchanged .",
    "furthermore , from figs . [",
    "fig : fig20](b ) and [ fig : fig20](c ) , we see a similar behavior for @xmath0 at low temperatures , i.e. an approach of the value of the @xmath370 component or the @xmath11 component in the mt@xmath360al cvc case towards that in the mt cvc case with decreasing temperature .    combining the results at @xmath310 ev , we find that the @xmath15-linear @xmath0 and the dominance of the @xmath10 orbital which are obtained in the mt cvc case are qualitatively unchanged even in the mt@xmath360al cvc case , and that there are two almost distinct regions of the temperature dependence of @xmath0 .",
    "those regions consist of high - temperature region , governed mainly by the @xmath3 cvc , and low - temperature region , governed mainly by the @xmath3 cvc and the mt cvc .       at @xmath296 ev and @xmath294 in the four cases .",

    "we show its temperature dependence in the four cases in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig21 ] , and see from that figure three main features in the mt@xmath360al cvc case .",
    "first , at high temperatures , the values of @xmath1 in the mt@xmath360al cvc case are close to the values in the @xmath3 cvc case .",
    "this origin is the same for @xmath0 at high temperatures , i.e. , the small effects of the mt and the al cvcs due to the large qp damping .",
    "second , when temperature is low , the value of @xmath1 in the mt@xmath360al cvc case becomes almost the same as that in the mt cvc case .",
    "this result can be understood that the main effects of the mt cvc on @xmath1 at low temperatures remain leading even including the main terms of the al cvc .",
    "its mechanism is as follows : as shown in ref .",
    ", the main effects of the mt cvc on @xmath1 at low temperatures are the decreases of the negative - sign contributions of the @xmath370 component of the transverse conductivity around @xmath357 as a result of the magnitude changes of the currents of the @xmath10 orbital around @xmath357 due to the mt cvc arising from the spin fluctuations of the @xmath10 orbital around @xmath304 .",
    "although the currents of the @xmath10 orbital around @xmath357 are affected by the al1 and al2 cvcs arising from the above spin fluctuations , the main effects of the mt cvc persist in the mt@xmath360al cvc case due to the cancellation of those al1 and al2 cvcs in the presence of the even - parity and the rotational symmetry .",
    "( the mechanism of this cancellation  @xcite was explained in sect .",
    "iii c 1 . )",
    "it should be noted that we can understand why only for @xmath1 the main effects of the mt cvc survive at low temperatures even with the main terms of the al cvc by considering the difference between the important factors for @xmath155 and @xmath208 : since the important factor for @xmath155 is the unrenormalized qp damping , the effects of the mt cvc on the currents of the @xmath10 orbital around @xmath357 are little important for @xmath0 away from the af qcp due to the large unrenormalized qp damping ; on the other hand , since not only the unrenormalized qp damping but also the momentum derivative of the angle of the current becomes important for @xmath208 , the effects of the mt cvc on the currents of the @xmath10 orbital around @xmath357 become considerable for @xmath1 due to the large momentum derivative .",
    "third , three specific features of @xmath1 obtained in the mt cvc case survive even including the main terms of the al cvc ; the three specific features are emerging a peak , crossing over zero , and increasing monotonically in the high - temperature region .",
    "this can be understood that at high temperatures the effects of the al cvc are small due to the large qp damping , and that the main effects of the mt cvc at low temperatures remain qualitatively unchanged .",
    "next , we analyze the orbital - decomposed components of @xmath177 away from the af qcp to determine the role of each @xmath2 orbital .",
    "due to the same reason for @xmath155 , we consider only the @xmath370 component and @xmath11 component of @xmath208 ; the former and the latter are defined as the equations that @xmath371 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigmaxy - final ] ) are replaced by , respectively , @xmath372 and @xmath373 . from figs .",
    "[ fig : fig22](a)[fig : fig22](c ) , we find three main properties : at high temperatures , the effects of all the cvcs on those components are very small ; in the low - temperature region , the temperature dependence in the mt@xmath360al cvc case is qualitatively the same for the mt cvc case ; a peak of the @xmath370 component survives even with the main terms of the al cvc . those results can be understood in the similar way for @xmath1 .",
    "it should be noted that the difference in the important factor is the origin why the @xmath11 orbital gives considerable contributions to only @xmath208 , although its contributions to @xmath155 are negligible .",
    "thus , we deduce from the results at @xmath296 ev that the qualitative behavior of @xmath1 away from the af qcp can be captured by taking account of the @xmath3 cvc and the mt cvc .",
    "then , we go on to analyze the temperature dependence of @xmath1 near the af qcp .",
    "the results at @xmath310 ev in the four cases are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig23 ] .",
    "we see that even including the main terms of the al cvc , @xmath1 shows three specific features ( emerging a peak , crossing over zero , and increasing monotonically in high - temperature region ) , and that @xmath1 has two almost distinct regions as a function of temperature .",
    "the former result can be understood in the same way as the explanations about the third result of @xmath1 away from the af qcp , and the latter can be understood in the same way for the similar property of @xmath0 near the af qcp ( see sect .",

    "this results from the more importance of the mt cvc near the af qcp .",
    "thus , the results at @xmath310 ev show the validity of the qualitative behaviors of @xmath1 near the af qcp in the mt cvc case and the existence of the two almost distinct regions of the temperature dependence of @xmath1 near the af qcp , which are the same for @xmath0 near the af qcp .",
    "in this section , i compare the results obtained away from or near the af qcp with several experimental or theoretical results . the discussions in sec .",
    "iv a are for the comparisons with several experiments , and the discussions in sec .",
    "iv b are for the comparisons with other theories .      in this section ,",
    "we compare the results obtained away from or near the af qcp with several experiments of sr@xmath4ruo@xmath5 or sr@xmath4ru@xmath6ti@xmath7o@xmath5 , respectively , and see that the obtained results are qualitatively consistent with these experiments . in the comparisons with sr@xmath4ru@xmath6ti@xmath7o@xmath5 , i believe that the physical origins of several behaviors observed experimentally can be deduced by comparison with the results obtained near the af qcp . this is because the main effect of the ti - substitution may be the system approaching towards the af qcp compared with sr@xmath4ruo@xmath5 ; this main effect can be treated by increasing the value of @xmath21 in the model of sr@xmath4ruo@xmath5 .",
    "although the microscopic mechanism why the ti - substitution causes approaching towards the af qcp is unclear , we can qualitatively understand several differences between sr@xmath4ruo@xmath5 and sr@xmath4ru@xmath6ti@xmath7o@xmath5 as a result of the difference in the distance from the af qcp , as i will show below .",
    "we begin with the comparisons about the magnetic properties .",
    "the enhancement of the spin susceptibility at @xmath304 away from the af qcp agrees with the neutron  @xcite or the nuclear - magnetic - resonance ( nmr )  @xcite measurement of sr@xmath4ruo@xmath5 , and the similar enhancement near the af qcp is consistent with the neutron  @xcite or the nmr  @xcite measurement of sr@xmath4ru@xmath6ti@xmath7o@xmath5 .",
    "also , no sizable commensurate ferromagnetic spin fluctuation obtained away from the af qcp is in agreement with the neutron measurement  @xcite of sr@xmath4ruo@xmath5 .",
    "thus , several magnetic properties can be well described in the flex approximation , as explained in ref . .",
    "it should be noted that to discuss the anisotropy between the inplane and the out - of - plane spin susceptibilities , the spin - orbit interaction is necessary  @xcite .",
    "then , we turn to the comparisons about the electronic structure . as discussed in ref .",
    ", the larger mass enhancement for the @xmath11 orbital than for the @xmath10 orbital away from the af qcp is consistent with an experiment  @xcite in sr@xmath4ruo@xmath5 .",
    "in addition , the topology of the fs away from the af qcp agrees with the measurement of the dhva effect  @xcite or the angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy  @xcite .",
    "however , there is a quantitative difference in the location of the fs sheet of the @xmath11 orbital near @xmath382 : in my result , that fs sheet is very close to the inner fs sheet of the @xmath10 orbital [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig12](a ) ] ; in the experiments  @xcite , that fs sheet is not very close to the inner fs sheet .",
    "that difference exists even in the lda  @xcite , as described in ref . .",
    "to improve that difference , the spin - orbit interaction of the ru ions will be necessary since the small spin - orbit interaction leads to the weak hybridization of the bands near @xmath382  @xcite .",
    "actually , that difference is improved in the local - spin - density approximation  @xcite including the spin - orbit interaction .",
    "although that result indicates the importance of the spin - orbit interaction for quantitative discussions , the qualitative agreement of the fs is meaningful since that qualitative agreement suggests that the present theory can capture the aspects of many - body effects on the fs of sr@xmath4ruo@xmath5 at least on a qualitative level .",
    "in addition , that qualitative agreement supports the suitability of the expectation that the electronic structure of sr@xmath4ruo@xmath5 in the lda  @xcite may be regarded as a good starting point to include many - body effects .",
    "this is another meaningful aspect of that qualitative agreement since electron correlation sometimes modifies the fs drastically , resulting in the deviation of the fs from the experiment even on a qualitative level  @xcite . from those comparisons ,",
    "we deduce that the flex approximation can qualitatively well describe the electronic structure of sr@xmath4ruo@xmath5 .",
    "finally , i compare the obtained results with the experimental results about the transport properties . as described in ref .",

    "( the detail of the temperature dependence of @xmath1 in sr@xmath4ruo@xmath5 was described in sec .",

    "thus , neglecting the spin - orbit interaction will be sufficient for at least qualitative discussions about @xmath1 . combining those discussions ,",
    "we find that the successful descriptions of the transport properties qualitatively hold in the flex approximation with the @xmath3 cvc , the mt cvc , and the main terms of the al cvc .      in this section ,",
    "we compare the results of this paper with other theoretical studies and show several better points of this theory .",
    "first , we focus on the comparisons with the dmft  @xcite for a model of sr@xmath4ruo@xmath5 , and show that several electronic properties can be better described in the method i used due to a sufficient treatment of the spatially modulated spin fluctuations . then",

    "finally , we discuss the similarities and differences between the main effects of the al cvc on the charge transports in my case and the case  @xcite of the single - orbital hubbard model near an af qcp on a square lattice , and conclude that the existence of the two almost distinct regions of the charge transports near an af qcp as a function of temperature is one of the important findings of this paper .    we begin with the comparisons about the magnetic properties , the orbital dependence of the mass enhancement , and the modification of the fs sheets due to electron correlation in the dmft  @xcite for a model of sr@xmath4ruo@xmath5 in more detail than ref . .",
    "first , in the dmft , spatial correlations , the momentum dependent fluctuations , are completely neglected  @xcite , and the effects of only local correlations are taken into account  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "i have shown that not local but spatially modulated spin fluctuation with @xmath304 is important to discuss the magnetic properties of sr@xmath4ruo@xmath5 . as explained in sect .",
    "iv a , the neutron  @xcite and the nmr  @xcite measurement for sr@xmath4ruo@xmath5 have observed the enhancement of that spatially modulated spin fluctuation .",
    "thus , the magnetic properties can be better described in my case .",
    "second , in the dmft , the locations of the fs sheets are more drastically modified due to electron correlation than in my case : on @xmath383 line , the @xmath75 sheet of the @xmath11 orbital becomes the most inner sheet in the dmft  @xcite , while the most inner sheet in the lda  @xcite or my case is the @xmath74 sheet of the @xmath10 orbital .",
    "since the experimental results  @xcite are consistent with the result in the lda  @xcite and my case , the agreement about the fs is better in my case than in the dmft  @xcite .",
    "third , in the dmft , the mass enhancement of the @xmath11 orbital is larger than that of the @xmath10 orbital for finite values of @xmath81  @xcite ; e.g. , the former and the latter become @xmath384 and @xmath385 at @xmath386 ev and @xmath387 ev ( @xmath388 ) or @xmath389 and @xmath390 at @xmath386 ev and @xmath391 ev ( @xmath392 ) .",
    "thus , the larger mass enhancement for the @xmath11 orbital than for the @xmath10 orbital is obtained in both the dmft  @xcite and the flex approximation , although the large mass enhancement of the @xmath11 orbital is realized in a wider region of the parameters space in my case than in the dmft  @xcite ; in particular , that larger mass enhancement of the @xmath11 orbital is obtained even at @xmath393 ev in my case  @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that it is important and necessary to check whether spatial correlations , neglected in the dmft  @xcite , keep the orbital dependence of the mass enhancement qualitatively the same since the spatial correlations sometimes drastically change the results obtained in the dmft ( e.g. , see case  @xcite of a single - orbital hubbard model on a square lattice ) . actually , even in a two - orbital hubbard model  @xcite on a square lattice , spatial correlations included by considering a cluster cause the almost perfect disappearance of the unusual @xmath81 dependence of a critical value of @xmath21 for a mott transition , which is obtained in the dmft . combining the discussions of this paragraph ,",
    "i conclude that several electronic properties of sr@xmath4ruo@xmath5 can be better described in my case than in the dmft  @xcite .",
    "in particular , it is significant to find the importance of the mt cvc for obtaining the non - monotonic temperature dependence of @xmath1 of sr@xmath4ruo@xmath5 in this paper since in the dmft the cvcs are neglected due to lack of the momentum dependence of the self - energy  @xcite .",

    "in addition , only for the calculation of the in - plane resistivity , the authors of ref .",
    "added @xmath403 to @xmath404 since they assumed that sr@xmath4ruo@xmath5 were close to a ferromagnetic instability .",
    "although that assumption is experimentally incorrect  @xcite , their results at low temperatures will remain qualitatively unchanged since the contribution from the @xmath10 orbital is more important than that from the @xmath11 orbital due to the smaller @xmath394 of the @xmath10 orbital . adopting the phenomenological boltzmann theory in the relaxation - time approximation with those expressions of the unrenormalized qp damping to @xmath0 and @xmath1 , the authors of ref .",
    "obtained the @xmath9 dependence of @xmath0 at low temperatures and the non - monotonic temperature dependence of @xmath1 , which are consistent with the experiments  @xcite .",
    "however , as they pointed out in ref . , the result of @xmath1 is very sensitive to the small relative variation of @xmath405 and @xmath406 , and the sign change of @xmath1 disappears in some cases .",
    "in addition , @xmath405 and @xmath406 should be the same due to the tetragonal symmetry of the crystal .",
    "thus , although the results obtained in the relaxation - time approximation  @xcite seem to be reasonable , the validity of the choice of the _ ad hoc _ parameters is unclear . on the other hand ,",
    "i have shown in ref . without any _ ad hoc _ parameters of the unrenormalized qp damping that the mt cvc arising from the spin fluctuations of the @xmath10 orbital is essential to obtain the non - monotonic temperature dependence of @xmath1 .",
    "furthermore , in this paper , i show that the importance of that mt cvc remains unchanged even if we consider the main terms of the al cvc . from those arguments ,",
    "i propose the importance of the mt cvc arising from the spin fluctuations of the @xmath10 orbital to understand the temperature dependence of @xmath1 of sr@xmath4ruo@xmath5 .",
    "i close this section with the comparisons about the main effects of the al cvc with the case  @xcite of the single - orbital hubbard model near an af qcp on a square lattice . in that single - orbital case ,",
    "the authors of ref . analytically or numerically studied the effects of the al cvc on @xmath0 and @xmath1 near the af qcp where the spin susceptibility at @xmath23 was most strongly enhanced .",
    "then , their analytic study revealed the cancellation of the leading contributions in the al@xmath8 or the al@xmath22 cvc near the af qcp , whose details were explained in sect .",
    "iii c 1 , and their numerical study considering only the contributions of the mt cvc and the al cvc from the states on the fermi level revealed the qualitative validity of the results obtained without the al cvc .",
    "however , due to neglecting the other contributions near the fermi level , they did not obtain the existence of the two almost distinct regions of the transport properties near the af qcp as a function of temperature , which is revealed in this paper .",
    "it should be noted that i obtained the similar results  @xcite to those they had obtained , a decrease of the value of the inplane resistivity due to the al cvc and a larger decrease of that at high temperatures than at low temperatures ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig19 ] ) .",
    "thus , the aspects of the al cvc in my case are qualitatively consistent with those in the single - orbital case  @xcite . in addition",
    ", it is one of the important findings of this paper to reveal the existence of the two almost distinct regions of the charge transports near an af qcp .",
    "in summary , after explaining the formal derivations of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and the flex approximation with the @xmath3 cvc , the mt cvc , and the al cvc , i studied @xmath0 and @xmath1 for a @xmath2-orbital hubbard model in a pm state near or away from the af qcp on a square lattice in the flex approximation with the @xmath3 cvc , the mt cvc , and the main terms of the al cvc , and then found the three main results about many - body effects .",
    "the first main result is showing that the results of the previous studies  @xcite remain qualitatively unchanged even with the main terms of the al cvc .",
    "this indicates the qualitative validity of the arguments in the previous studies  @xcite .",
    "the second main result is finding the two almost distinct regions of the charge transports near the af qcp : @xmath0 and @xmath1 in the high - temperature region are described by including only the @xmath3 cvc , while the @xmath3 cvc and the mt cvc are necessary for their descriptions in low - temperature region .",
    "the third main result is clarifying the difference of the effects of the mt cvc between @xmath0 and @xmath1 away from the af qcp at low temperatures : the mt cvc leads to the considerable effect only on the latter , although at high temperatures only the @xmath3 cvc affects @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "thus , the second and third main results highlight the important aspects of many - body effects on the charge transports .",
    "i also showed several results of the magnetic properties and the electronic structure for that model in the flex approximation . those support a deeper understanding than in the previous studies  @xcite .",
    "then , comparing the obtained results with several experiments , i achieved the qualitative agreement about the momentum dependence of the spin fluctuation in sr@xmath4ruo@xmath5  @xcite or sr@xmath4ru@xmath6ti@xmath7o@xmath5  @xcite , the orbital dependence of the mass enhancement in sr@xmath4ruo@xmath5  @xcite , the topology of the fs of sr@xmath4ruo@xmath5  @xcite , the @xmath9 dependence  @xcite of @xmath0 at low temperatures in sr@xmath4ruo@xmath5 , the non - monotonic temperature dependence  @xcite of @xmath1 in sr@xmath4ruo@xmath5 , and the @xmath15-linear @xmath0 in sr@xmath4ru@xmath6ti@xmath7o@xmath5  @xcite .",

    "several important issues remain for further study .",
    "one is the extension of the present method to case with the spin - orbit interaction .",

    "furthermore , the study about the charge transports of the @xmath33d ruthenates  @xcite using the extended method is useful to clarify the role of the dimensionality in the charge transports of a correlated multiorbital system",
    ". then , another important issue is the extended study about the charge or heat transports of sr@xmath4ruo@xmath5 in a superconducting phase  @xcite since it may clarify the role of each @xmath2 orbital in the superconducting phase .",

    "in this appendix , i explain how to determine the dominant fluctuations in a multiorbital hubbard model among the four kinds of fluctuations .    to discuss the dominant fluctuations in a multiorbital hubbard model , we need to consider charge fluctuations , spin fluctuations , orbital fluctuations , and spin - orbital - combined fluctuations  @xcite .",

    "then , spin and spin - orbital - combined fluctuations are described by @xmath317 , and charge and orbital fluctuations are described by @xmath467  @xcite .",

    "the difference in the @xmath81 or @xmath21 dependence arises from the difference in the dependence of the bare four - point vertex function characterizing the fluctuation .",
    "for example , in case  @xcite of a @xmath2-orbital hubbard model with @xmath288 and @xmath289 , the bare four - point vertex function for charge fluctuations is @xmath538 ; that for spin fluctuations is @xmath539 ; that for orbital fluctuations is @xmath540 or @xmath541 or @xmath542 ; that for orbital - spin - combined fluctuations is @xmath543 or @xmath544 or @xmath545 .",
    "thus , if orbital or spin - orbital - combined fluctuations are dominant , we obtain non - monotonic @xmath81 dependence of @xmath306 or @xmath305 , respectively , with increasing @xmath81 since the bare four - point vertex function characterizing those fluctuations changes from repulsive to attractive at a critical value of @xmath81 as a function of @xmath21 ; if spin fluctuations are dominant , we obtain monotonic @xmath81 dependence of @xmath305 with increasing @xmath81 due to the always repulsive bare four - point vertex function characterizing those . note that charge fluctuations are always suppressed in a realistic set of the hubbard interaction terms .",
