    "the properties of the spatial distribution and velocity field of matter in the universe constrain the models of large - scale structure formation .",
    "the velocity field has mostly been used to estimate @xmath11 , the mass density parameter of the universe , by means of the clustering anisotropy in redshift space ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) , the connection between the density and the peculiar velocity fields ( @xcite and references therein ) , or the mean relative peculiar velocity of galaxy pairs as a function of pairwise separation @xcite .",
    "further constraints on structure formation models can be extracted from the evolution of the velocity field on large scales .",
    "its measure is possible with the detection of the kinetic sz effect @xcite .",
    "when the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons are scattered by the free electrons in the intracluster medium ( icm ) , the cmb radiation varies its intensity and its spectral distribution .",
    "the thermal motion of the free electrons and their bulk velocity have a different spectral signature on the cmb and the two contributions can be separated with multi - frequency observations",
    ". however , the bulk velocity contribution ( the kinetic sz effect ) is , on average , an order of magnitude smaller than the thermal contribution ( the thermal sz effect ) , and leaves the cmb spectrum unchanged : these features make the kinetic sz effect difficult to detect , although it has been recently shown how its spatial correlation with the thermal sz effect ( @xcite ; @xcite ) can be used to remove the cmb contribution efficiently @xcite .",
    "the thermal effect is now becoming routinely detected and major efforts have been done to plan several sz cluster surveys which will produce catalogues of tens of thousands of clusters in the coming years ( see @xcite for a review and @xcite for systematics ) .",
    "the sz effect does not suffer from the usual redshift dimming of electromagnetic surface brightnesses , and clusters can be detected , in principle , as far back in time as when they formed .",
    "the distribution of sz clusters on the sky can already provide information on cosmological parameters ( @xcite , 2004 ) and cluster biasing ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , although one has to separate the effects of the icm properties from those of the cosmological model @xcite .",
    "stronger constraints for cosmology are of course provided by the cluster redshift distribution ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the accuracy of cluster redshifts determined with photometric observations @xcite or methods based on the sz information alone ( @xcite ; @xcite ) may be sufficient to constrain cosmology , and optical or x - ray follow - up spectroscopy , which can be particularly demanding in terms of observation time and sensitivity , may not be needed for a first analysis .",
    "if we measure the peculiar velocity of clusters , we can reconstruct the redshift evolution of the velocity field on large scales .",
    "many authors have investigated the feasibility of measuring the bulk flow on @xmath12 mpc scales with the kinetic sz effect ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "no other method is currently viable for this task other than the kinetic sz effect .    to date , because of",
    "the weakness of the total sz signal compared to the sensitivity of the radio telescopes , separating the kinetic from the thermal contribution has required the estimate of the expected sz signal with an _ a priori _ knowledge of the temperature and spatial distribution of the icm .",
    "x - ray observations have been used to obtain this information for spatially well resolved clusters ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , 2004 ; @xcite ) . this procedure can not be easily extended to clusters at high redshift where x - ray observations can be beyond the limit of detectability and spatial resolution",
    "can be poor . in principle , but only for massive clusters with hot icm ( @xmath13 kev ) , one can estimate the temperature , rather than with x - ray observations , by using the dependence of the spectral function of the sz effect on the gas temperature , which appears when a fully relativistic treatment of the photon scatter is considered ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , a recent attempt , although successful , has provided a temperature measure with quite large uncertainties @xcite .",
    "further insights into the physical properties of the icm come from the scaling relations between x - ray and sz observables .",
    "analytic models ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , semi - analytical models ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , and @xmath2-body hydrodynamical simulations ( e.g. @xcite ) have been used to investigate the effects of heating , cooling , and preheating on the normalization , slope and scatter of these scaling relations .    here",
    ", we use a large @xmath2-body hydrodynamical simulation @xcite , which includes an advanced treatment of the gas dynamics , contains a large sample of simulated massive clusters and reproduces reasonably well the x - ray properties of real clusters , to verify ( 1 ) whether we can reproduce the observed scaling relations between x - ray and sz observables ; ( 2 ) whether the two basic assumptions underlying the peculiar velocity measurement hold in the simulations ; namely whether ( i ) the mean gas velocity equals the dark matter bulk velocity and the internal gas bulk flows are negligible @xcite , and ( ii ) the icm temperature derived from x - ray observations is a good estimator of the icm temperature weighted by the electron number density .",
    "our simulated sample contains 117 well resolved clusters and provides a major statistical improvement on previous analyses performed on a handful number of clusters ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we do not investigate the systematics due to a realistic observational procedure , which includes cleaning the radio detection of instrumental noise , atmospheric emission , galactic emission at low frequencies , galactic dust and young galaxy emission at high frequencies , radio sources , and the cmb itself .",
    "a detailed analysis of these effects can be found , for example , in @xcite and @xcite .",

    "when we have a measure of @xmath58 at three or more frequencies @xmath56 , a fit to equation ( [ eq : deltai ] ) provides an estimate of @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "simultaneous multi - frequency observations can be performed to minimize the variations in the atmospheric emission . in this case",
    "the fitting procedure to the spectral function is obviously considerably more complicated , because the @xmath58 s are correlated @xcite .    by combining @xmath59 and @xmath60 ,",
    "one finally derives the line - of - sight peculiar velocity : @xmath61 provided that the spherical @xmath62model adequately describes the gas distribution , when applied to real clusters , this equation has two main problems , that we will investigate below : ( 1 ) the central value of the velocity @xmath51 might not necessarily coincide with the global peculiar velocity of the cluster ; ( 2 ) only the temperature averaged within the region of the size of the beam is actually available , rather than the temperature in the cluster centre @xmath49 .",

    "the plummer - equivalent gravitational softening is 7.5 @xmath4 kpc comoving at @xmath84 , and fixed in physical units at lower redshift .",
    "the simulation was run with gadget-2 @xcite , a massively parallel tree+sph code with fully adaptive time  stepping , which uses the energy and entropy conserving sph implementation of @xcite .",
    "the code includes a photoionizing , time - dependent , uniform uv background , radiative cooling , star formation , feedback from type ii supernovae and a phenomenological recipe for galactic winds . within each gas particle of sufficiently high density ,",
    "the gas is a two - phase fluid , with unresolved cold clouds , embedded at pressure equilibrium in an ambient hot medium , providing a sub - grid model for the multiphase nature of the interstellar medium @xcite .",
    "the volume of our simulation is larger than @xmath85 mpc@xmath86 , as required to predict the evolution of cluster peculiar velocities correctly @xcite ; this volume also yields a cluster sample large enough for statistical purposes .",
    "moreover our simulation represents a substantial improvement compared to recent cosmological hydrodynamical simulations used for the study of the sz effect : they typically have a volume @xmath87 mpc@xmath86 and a particle masses four to six times larger than in our simulation ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "finally , the good mass and spatial resolution and the treatment of a two - phase fluid for star formation and feedback provide a reasonable modelling of the gas physics .",
    "we identify clusters in the simulation box with a two - step procedure : a friends - of - friends algorithm applied to the dark matter particles alone provides a list of halos whose centres are used as input to the spherical overdensity algorithm which outputs the final list of clusters @xcite .",
    "centered on the most bound particle of each cluster , the sphere with virial overdensity @xmath88 , with respect to the critical density @xcite , defines the virial radius @xmath89 . for this cosmological model @xmath90 , at @xmath1 . at redshift",

    "this cluster set is our sample .      around each cluster",
    "we extract a spherical region extending out to @xmath92 .",
    "we then create maps of the relevant quantities along three orthogonal directions to investigate projection effects .",

    "we therefore distribute the quantity of each particle on the grid points within the circle of radius @xmath94 centered on the particle . specifically , we compute a generic quantity @xmath98 on the grid point @xmath99 as @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the pixel area , the sum runs over all the particles , and @xmath102 is the weight proportional to the fraction of the particle proper volume @xmath103 which contributes to the grid point @xmath99 . for each particle ,",

    "results in this paper are shown for a number of pixels @xmath106 , corresponding to a comoving length resolution @xmath107 kpc , on average .",
    "figures [ fig : tsz_map ] and [ fig : ksz_map ] show an example of the thermal and the kinetic sz maps of a cluster in our simulation .",
    "galaxy clusters are self - similar in their dark matter component , but not necessarily in their baryonic component . non - gravitational processes , namely gas heating and cooling , vary the entropy of the icm and can substantially affect the distribution of the gas ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "measuring scaling relations among gas properties is an important step to understand the role of the different processes governing the icm physics .",
    "the list of the relevant processes that we included in our simulation is currently one of the most complete .",
    "therefore , we can attempt a comparison of our simulated gas properties with the observations of the sz effect .    here , we will investigate the relations @xmath108 and @xmath109 between the x - ray luminosity @xmath110 or the icm temperature @xmath111 and the central comptonization parameter @xmath59 ; we will also compute the relation @xmath112 , where @xmath113 is the sz surface brightness integrated over a given solid angle .",

    "the cluster size @xmath115 scales with @xmath117 and the icm mass @xmath123 as @xmath124 .",
    "therefore the icm mass scales with its temperature @xmath111 as @xmath125 ; for the cmb flux variation due to the thermal sz effect we have @xmath126 , where @xmath34 is the angular diameter distance to the cluster , and @xmath127",
    ". we can also write @xmath113 in a different way to get its explicit dependence on @xmath59 : @xmath128 , where @xmath129 is the infinitesimal projected area covered by the cluster .",
    "we find @xmath130 .",

    "this last result indicates that the velocity bias found above for the slow clusters ( @xmath237 ) is totally due to the bulk flow of gas clouds within the icm , and not to different mean velocities of gas and dark matter particles .",
    "this conclusion also explains why the scatter of @xmath238 for the slow clusters ( @xmath239 ) is much larger than the scatter for the fast clusters ( @xmath240 ) : bulk flows have roughly the same magnitude , independently of the cluster speed .",

    "the two temperatures are comparable only at the smallest @xmath241 , when @xmath0 is roughly 10 per cent larger than @xmath150 @xcite . at larger @xmath241 s the disagreement increases .",

    "@xmath150 is largely insensitive to @xmath241 because it is proportional to the square of the gas density and is therefore dominated by the emission from the central region .",
    "instead , @xmath0 steeply decreases with increasing @xmath241 because it is only proportional to the first power of the electronic gas density .",
    "when @xmath248 , @xmath0 can be substantially smaller than @xmath150 : the mean relation between these two measures of the icm temperature is @xmath249 ( figure [ fig : te - tx ] ) . therefore , in spatially poorly resolved clusters , using @xmath150 rather than @xmath0 can substantially overestimate the peculiar velocity ( equations [ eq : vel - res ] and [ eq : vel - unres ] ) , as we will see in the next section .",
    "note that here we compute the bolometric temperature .",
    "figure 3 in @xcite shows that the temperatures estimated by weighting the emissivity in a finite energy band are larger than those obtained by weighting with the bolometric emissivity .",
    "therefore , for real clusters , the @xmath250 relation can be shallower and the overestimate of the peculiar velocity more severe .",
    "it remains to quantify this trend when a realistic observational procedure is applied to simulated clusters @xcite .",
    "measuring the peculiar velocity of clusters with the sz effect requires the separation of the thermal from the kinetic contribution to the total sz flux .",
    "spatially resolved and unresolved clusters require two different procedures for this separation .    in the former , a model for the icm distribution is derived from the x - ray surface brightness to estimate the central values of the sz contributions . in the latter , the beam - averaged sz contributions are measured without any information on the icm distribution . to date , only the former case has been applied to observations .",
    "we now consider these two approaches on turn to estimate the systematics that they introduce on the peculiar velocity measurement . here , we will only consider the physical properties of the icm and we will not model the instrumental or data reduction problems which affect real observations .      we perform a rather simple simulation of the observation of individual clusters .",
    "namely , we ( 1 ) construct an x - ray surface brightness map from the simulation , ( 2 ) derive the gas distribution shape parameters @xmath53 and @xmath54 from the x - ray surface brightness profile , ( 3 ) compute the sz fluctuations in the cmb intensity maps @xmath251 at four different frequencies @xmath252 , @xmath253 , @xmath254 , and @xmath255 ghz , ( 4 ) derive the central values @xmath256 of the radial fits with the shape parameters @xmath53 and @xmath54 imposed by the x - ray surface brightness profile , ( 5 ) perform a fit to equation ( [ eq : deltai ] ) by assuming that the four @xmath256 s are independent , ( 6 ) estimate the peculiar velocity ( equation [ eq : vel - res ] ) by using the x - ray temperature @xmath150 ( equation [ eq : sim - tx ] ) or the electronic temperature @xmath0 ( equation [ eq : telpart ] ) .    in equation ( [ eq : vel - res ] )",

    "observationally , one uses the x - ray temperature averaged within the resolution beam . to quantify the effect of the beam size , we compute the temperature with the gas particles within spheres of different radii @xmath257 .    figure [ fig : vel - te - tx - dist - beta ] shows the distribution of the deviations @xmath258 of the estimated line - of - sight peculiar velocity @xmath259 from the actual cluster velocity @xmath212 .",
    "the solid and dashed histograms show these deviations when we use @xmath150 or @xmath0 , respectively .",
    "we consider the temperatures averaged within four different radii .    the temperature within the smallest radius @xmath260 is the closest to the central temperature that should be used in equation ( [ eq : vel - res ] ) .",
    "at this radius , both the x - ray and the electronic temperature overestimate the peculiar velocity .",
    "the overestimate with @xmath0 is more severe , because @xmath0 is 10 per cent larger than @xmath150 ( figure [ fig : t - prof ] ) .",
    "the incorrect estimate of the peculiar velocity derives from the fact that the gas is neither spherically and smoothly distributed nor isothermal , as assumed when we impose the @xmath52-model to the x - ray surface brightness .",
    "in fact , the agreement between estimated and real peculiar velocity does not improve when we use the @xmath52-model parameters derived from the sz surface brightness , rather than the x - ray surface brightness , despite the fact that the two parameter sets do not generally coincide ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the radial profile of the x - ray temperature @xmath150 decreases less rapidly than the radial profile of @xmath0 ( figure [ fig : t - prof ] ) .",
    "therefore , the peculiar velocity estimate based on @xmath150 is rather insensitive to the beam size , whereas the velocity estimated with @xmath0 rapidly decreases with @xmath257 .",

    "including all the clusters leaves the medians unchanged , but substantially extends the tails of the distributions , because , in slow clusters , errors of order a few tens of km s@xmath7 produce large relative deviations due to the bulk flows internal to the icm .    in terms of velocity magnitudes ,",
    "the deviations are comparable , on average , to the systematics due to the internal bulk flows .",

    "the standard deviations are @xmath263 km s@xmath7 and 173 km s@xmath7 , when we use the x - ray or the electronic temperatures , respectively .",
    "if our simulated clusters mirror a realistic sample , we expect that , for spatially resolved clusters with peculiar velocity larger than @xmath220 km s@xmath7 , the usual assumptions on the icm physical properties should cause on average a @xmath264 per cent systematic overestimate of the velocity . for these clusters ,",
    "the width of the distribution in the upper - left panel of figure [ fig : vel - te - tx - dist - beta ] suggests @xmath265 per cent as a typical uncertainty on the velocity estimate .    .",

    ", we compute the @xmath269 and @xmath270 maps , and compute @xmath271 by integrating @xmath272 over a beam of physical size @xmath273 .",
    "we then extract @xmath73 and @xmath274 from the spectral fit .",
    "we emphasize that in this case there is no need of any assumption about the icm spatial distribution .",
    "figure [ fig : vel - te - tx - dist - apert ] shows the distributions of the deviations of the estimated line - of - sight velocities from the real velocities for four different aperture radii @xmath257 .",
    "our maps have @xmath275 pixels and are @xmath276 on a side .",
    "therefore , we choose @xmath277 to avoid the shot - noise due to the small number of pixels in smaller apertures .",
    "when we use the x - ray temperature averaged over the appropriate aperture in equation ( [ eq : vel - unres ] ) , the larger is the aperture , the larger is the line - of - sight peculiar velocity overestimate ( solid histograms ) .",
    "in fact , the ratio of the two integrated sz components @xmath278 , in units of the central ratio @xmath279 , increases by 45 per cent between @xmath280 and @xmath281 , while @xmath150 remains basically constant . on the other hand ,",
    "the rapid decrease of the electron temperature @xmath0 with @xmath257 compensates the increase of @xmath278 , and the peculiar velocity estimate is basically unbiased ( dashed histogram ) .    as for the case of spatially resolved clusters ,",
    "figure [ fig : vel - te - tx - dist - apert ] only shows the clusters with @xmath282 km s@xmath7 : slower clusters produce longer tails in the distributions but do not vary the central values .",
    "the lower panels in figure [ fig : vel - tx - te - res - unres ] show the extreme case of unresolved clusters , with beam size @xmath283 . even in this case",
    "the standard deviation is @xmath284 km s@xmath7 and therefore comparable to the systematic errors due to the internal bulk flows .",
    "figure [ fig : vel - te - tx - dist - apert ] clearly shows that , with only the x - ray temperature available , it is essential to have good spatial resolution , in order to have a measure of the ratio @xmath278 within a sufficiently small area where @xmath150 and @xmath0 are comparable .",
    "otherwise the large value of @xmath150 can severely overestimate the peculiar velocity .",
    "in principle , the evolution of the velocity field on large scales can be measured by detecting the kinetic sz effect of galaxy clusters .",
    "there exist substantial technical difficulties in this measurement due to the weakness of the signal and due to the fact that the kinetic effect does not produce a spectral distortion of the cmb .",
    "nevertheless , a few detections have been claimed to date ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and more sensitive instruments will make this measurement less problematic in the near future .",
    "the estimate of the peculiar velocity of a cluster from the amplitude of the kinetic sz effect assumes an isothermal icm in hydrostatic equilibrium in the cluster potential well .",
    "recent x - ray observations ( e.g. @xcite ) show that the icm is actually far from this ideal model .",
    "we extracted a sample of 117 fairly realistic galaxy clusters , with mass larger than @xmath285 , from an @xmath2-body hydrodynamical simulation of a large volume of a @xmath76cdm cosmological model to estimate the systematic errors , due to the gas bulk flows and icm temperature estimate , which can affect the measures of the peculiar velocity .",
    "our simulation reproduces the observed properties of x - ray clusters ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and the distribution of the intracluster light @xcite reasonably well . here",
    ", we show that our model also reproduces the observed scaling relation between x - ray and sz properties , namely the x - ray luminosity or the emission - weighted x - ray temperature vs. the central value @xmath59 of the comptonization parameter map .",
    "the results of the comparison , between observed and simulated clusters , that we propose here , are not yet fully satisfactory , mostly because of the lack of a uniform sample of clusters observed both in the microwave and x - ray bands .",
    "we then show that if the icm is not in hydrostatic equilibrium in the cluster potential well , bulk flows of gas within the icm itself can introduce a systematic error in the estimate of the peculiar velocity . however , this effect is unlikely to be larger than @xmath10 km s@xmath7 .",
    "our result , based on a large sample of simulated clusters , provides a robust statistical confirmation of the analyses of @xcite and @xcite who considered the @xmath2-body hydrodynamical simulations of only one and three clusters , respectively .",
    "we finally investigate the relevance of the estimate of @xmath0 , the icm temperature weighted by the electron number density , in the peculiar velocity measurement .",
    "a possibile systematic error originates from the fact that the observed temperature @xmath150 , which is derived from the x - ray spectrum , might be a biased estimate of @xmath0 . in the simulations , @xmath150 is usually identified with the temperature weighted by the x - ray emission . when averaged within large radii of the cluster centre , @xmath150 can overestimate @xmath0 by @xmath286 per cent .",
    "if the angular resolution of the radio / microwave observation is too poor to provide a spatially resolved profile of the sz surface brightness and it only provides an integrated flux , the temperature overestimate propagates into a peculiar velocity overestimate of the same amount .    on the other hand , in the case of clusters which are spatially resolved in the microwave bands , we can use the temperature of the icm in the central region of the cluster , where @xmath150 is comparable to @xmath0 . for observations which resolve a tenth of the virial radius ,",
    "the velocity is still overestimated by @xmath9 per cent , because of the assumptions on the spatial and thermal distribution of the icm , usually parametrized with a @xmath52-model , used to separate the thermal and kinetic sz components .    our results rely on the usual assumption that the emission - weighted temperature extracted from the simulations is comparable to the icm temperature derived from the observed x - ray spectrum .",
    "the emission - weighted temperature can however overestimate the spectral temperature by @xmath287 per cent ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this uncertainty makes the identification of the observed @xmath150 with @xmath0 more problematic , although it seems to alleviate the systematics we find here .    by combining all these results we can set a conservative lower limit of @xmath10 km s@xmath7 ( see figures [ fig : vmapscatter ] and [ fig : vel - tx - te - res - unres ] ) to the systematic errors that will affect upcoming measurements of the cluster peculiar velocity with the sz effect",
    "this limit is comparable to the accuracy expected when the contamination from dusty galaxies and primary cmb anisotropies is considered in radio / microwave observations at microkelvin sensitivity and arcminute angular resolution @xcite .",
    "therefore , the internal icm bulk flows and its temperature estimate may limit any substantial improvements that could come from more sensitive microwave measurements and more accurate component separations .",
    "we consider the systematic error we find here a lower limit because we identify clusters in the three - dimensional space of the simulation box and analyze their x - ray and sz properties in two - dimensional projected maps without including instrumental noise and back-/fore - ground sources .",
    "real - world complications can add further systematic errors @xcite .",
    "more realistic mock observations of sz clusters are required to design a method to correct for these biases . to accomplish this task one can construct microwave sky maps from @xmath2-body hydrodynamical simulations ( e.g. @xcite ) , identify clusters in these maps ( e.g. @xcite ) and analyze the simulated data according to standard observational procedures .",
    "this approach will help to quantify how , in a realistic situation , the different systematic errors propagate into the statistical analysis of cluster velocity fields .",

    "<S> the fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) intensity due to the sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect are the sum of a thermal and a kinetic contribution . separating the two components to measure the peculiar velocity of galaxy clusters requires radio and microwave observations at three or more frequencies , and knowledge of the temperature @xmath0 of the intracluster medium weighted by the electron number density . </S>",
    "<S> to quantify the systematics of this procedure , we extract a sample of 117 massive clusters at redshift @xmath1 from an @xmath2-body hydrodynamical simulation , with @xmath3 particles , of a cosmological volume 192 @xmath4 mpc on a side of a flat cold dark matter model with @xmath5 and @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> our simulation includes radiative cooling , star formation and the effect of feedback and galactic winds from supernovae . </S>",
    "<S> we find that ( 1 ) our simulated clusters reproduce the observed scaling relations between x - ray and sz properties ; ( 2 ) bulk flows internal to the intracluster medium affect the velocity estimate by less than 200 km  s@xmath7 in 93 per cent of the cases ; ( 3 ) using the x - ray emission weighted temperature , as an estimate of @xmath0 , can overestimate the peculiar velocity by @xmath8 per cent , if the microwave observations do not spatially resolve the cluster . for spatially resolved clusters , the assumptions on the spatial distribution of the icm , required to separate the two sz components , still produce a velocity overestimate of @xmath9 per cent , even with an unbiased measure of @xmath0 . thanks to the large size of our cluster samples </S>",
    "<S> , these results set a robust lower limit of @xmath10 km  s@xmath7 to the systematic errors that will affect upcoming measures of cluster peculiar velocities with the sz effect .    </S>",
