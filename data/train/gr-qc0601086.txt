    "the observation that the universe appears to be accelerating has been one of the biggest surprises in both the astronomy and particle physics communities .",
    "this acceleration can be accounted for by adding a cosmological constant in einstein s equations . while particle physicists never had a definite reason for setting the cosmological constant to zero",
    ", there was always the view that like all small or zero quantities , there must be a symmetry enforcing it .",
    "the observation that the size of the cosmological constant is neither zero nor at one of the natural scales like the planck length or the scale of supersymmetry breaking has focused attention on explaining the dark energy component",
    ".    there are at least two requirements for any model of dark energy : ( 1 ) one must obtain in a natural way the observed size of the energy density , @xmath0  ev@xmath1 .",

    "( 2 ) one must also obtain an equation of state @xmath5 which is similar to that of a cosmological constant at least in the recent past , namely @xmath6 .",
    "in fact , the most recent data from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) satellite and supernova and sky surveys have constrained the equation of state @xmath7 at the 95% confidence level for dark energy with a constant @xmath5 .    an interesting approach to the dark matter problem that has arisen from recent advances in understanding string theory and black hole physics",
    "is to employ a holographic principle . here",
    "the motivation is the recognition that the observed size of the energy density at the present epoch seems to be consistent with taking the geometric average of the two scales @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "early attempts to relate the dark energy to the hubble scale or the particle horizon did not give acceptable solutions in detail that were consistent with the observations .",
    "the evolution of the dark energy density also depends on its precise nature .",
    "if the dark energy is like a cosmological constant with equation of state @xmath8 , the dark energy density is constant and within the expanding universe ultimately the dark energy density comes to dominate over the matter density .",
    "in this scenario the transition from matter domination to dark energy domination is rapid , and the fact that experimental observations seem to be consistent with sizeable amounts of both matter and dark energy indicates that we are currently residing in this transition period .",
    "the cosmic coincidence problem is the statement that it is unlikely that the current epoch coincides with this rapid transition period .",
    "a possible solution is to assume that there is some mechanism that is converting dark energy into matter .",
    "cosmic antifriction forces were introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite as a possible solution to the cosmic coincidence problem .",
    "if these forces are present one can obtain a fixed ratio of matter density to dark energy density as the final state of the universe and hence solve the coincidence problem .",
    "the resulting cosmology is described by friedmann equations .",
    "the basic scenario is quite simple : the natural tendency of a cosmological component with a more negative equation of state to dominate at large times the energy density of the universe is compensated by the decay of the dark energy component into the other component(s ) . at large times",
    "an equilibrium solution can develop for which the various components can coexist .",
    "the interpretation is then that we are living in or close to this equilibrium thus eliminating the cosmic coincidence problem .",
    "frictional and antifrictional forces we envision here were introduced for a single component in refs .",
    "the particular case where the dark energy component is assumed to have a constant equation of state was treated in ref .",
    "these efforts were preceded by searches for attractor solutions involving scalar fields@xcite .",
    "recently these kind of scenarios have been employed in models with brane - bulk energy exchange@xcite .",
    "some attempts have been made to explain the size of the dark energy density on the basis of holographic ideas@xcite , and lead to the consideration of the hubble horizon as the holographic scale@xcite .",
    "a holographic model based on the future event horizon was examined in ref .",
    "danielsson studied the effects of a transplanckian backreaction as a particular source for the holographic dark energy@xcite .",

    "we assume two component equations for dark energy and matter , @xmath9 the equality of @xmath10 in the two equations guarantees the overall conservation of the energy - momentum tensor , and positive @xmath10 can be interpreted as a transfer from the dark energy component to the matter component .",
