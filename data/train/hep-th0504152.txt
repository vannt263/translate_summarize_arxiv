    "these solutions are neither asymptotically flat nor ( anti)-de sitter . some basic properties of the solutions were discussed .",
    "it was shown that the black holes are stable against linear radial perturbations .",
    "it is worth noting that the black solutions derived in the present paper are solutions not only of the bi electrodynamics but also of general nonlinear electrodynamics described by an arbitrary function @xmath116 provided the corresponding algebraic equations possess roots and the corresponding algebraic inequalities are satisfied . in particular , in the case of the linear electrodynamics with @xmath117the method presented here gives the well - known non - asymptotically flat and non-(a)ds black hole solutions of einstein - maxwell - dilaton ( emd ) gravity @xcite .",
    "moreover , for @xmath117 we have @xmath107 and therefore , the emd black holes are stable was proven in @xcite . ] against linear radial perturbations for arbitrary dilaton coupling constant @xmath7 .",
    "it is puzzling that the nonlinear electrodynamics equations can be solved for arbitrary function @xmath116 .",
    "the cause is that we consider the sector where the theory looses a part of its nonlinearity .",
    "more precisely , the electromagnetic nonlinearity of the differential equations is transformed into algebraic nonlinearity .",
    "this can be explicitly demonstrated as follows . for spherically symmetric magnetic configurations",
    "the ansatz ( [ ansatz1 ] ) and ( [ ansatz2 ] ) are equivalent to consider @xmath22 satisfies    @xmath118    the first consequence following from this fact is that the nonlinear maxwell equations ( [ fe ] ) become linear since the nonlinear part can be pulled out of the equations . in second place , redefining the dilaton field as @xmath119 where    @xmath120\\over x\\right)\\right|_{x = x_{0}},\\ ] ]    the dilaton equation becomes the one of the linear emd case .",
    "the only difference appears in the einstein equations , which reduce to    @xmath121    where    @xmath122    in this way we obtained field equations which are linear in the electromagnetic field .",
    "note however , although linear in the electromagnetic field , these equations , in general , are not the emd equations since @xmath123 for general nonlinear electrodynamics .",
    "for example , in the case of the born - infeld electrodynamics we have @xmath123 for any finite value of @xmath124 .",
    "summarizing , we have shown that the all information about the nonlinearity is encoded in the parameter @xmath125 appearing in the einstein equations and the nonlinear algebraic constraint ( [ nc ] ) .",
    "it can be seen from the exact solutions presented in the previous sections , that the solutions of the `` k - deformed '' emd equations are quite similar to those of the pure emd equations . the parameter @xmath125 influences the background constants in the solutions .",
    "in contrast , the nonlinear constraint ( [ nc ] ) gives severe physical restrictions on the black holes charge .",
    "these restrictions algebraically reflect the nonlinearity of the electromagnetic field .",
    "this can be explicitly seen from the solutions for the born - infeld electrodynamics with @xmath25 where the constraint ( [ nc ] ) gives the existence condition @xmath126 .",
