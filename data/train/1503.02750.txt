    "the formation of a compact binary system composed of two white dwarfs ( wds ) is widely accepted to include a common envelope event ( cee ) , at least during the last episode of mass exchange between the first - formed wd and a low - mass red giant ( rg ) .",
    "low - mass rgs have a well - defined relation between their core masses and radii , providing for dwds the best - defined state of a progenitor binary system at the onset of the cee among all known types of post - common envelope ( ce ) systems . as a result ,",
    "dwd systems have served extensively as test - sites for attempts to understand the physics of cees , using both population synthesis approaches and hydrodynamical methods .",
    "previous attempts to model a cee between a low - mass rg and a wd did not succeed to eject the entire ce during three - dimensional ( 3d ) hydrodynamical simulations ( for most recent studies , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the final state of these simulations is that a significant fraction of the expanded envelope remains bound to the formed binary , forming a so - called circumbinary envelope .",
    "then almost no energy transfer can take place from the binary orbit to that circumbinary envelope .",
    "observationally , no circumbinary disk in a post - common envelope system has been found so far .    it has been proposed long ago that recombination energy of hydrogen and helium should play a role during a cee @xcite .",
    "however , until now , this energy was not yet taken into account in 3d modeling . while the initially available recombination energy can be easily comparable to the binding energy of the remaining bound envelope ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the important question is _ when and where _ the energy is released  to be useful , recombination energy should not be released too early in the cee nor in material already ejected , but instead in the circumbinary envelope at a time when the recombination energy is comparable to the binding energy of the not - yet ejected material . in this _ letter _",
    ", we investigate if the inclusion of recombination energy can help to remove the circumbinary envelope .",
    "we apply the new approach to the system wd 1101 + 364 , a well - measured dwd that has @xmath2 d and a mass ratio of @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the masses of the younger and older wds , respectively @xcite .",
    "we anticipate that the progenitor of wd 1101 + 364 was a low - mass rg that had a degenerate core of @xmath6 .",
    "we consider the range of masses for the rg donor , @xmath7 , from @xmath8 to @xmath9 . to evolve the rg and find the initial one - dimensional ( 1d ) stellar profile , we use twin / star stellar code .",
    "the stars are evolved until their degenerate he cores have grown close to @xmath6 .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,>,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the orbital angular momentum @xmath10 and @xmath11 for the initial and final binary , respectively , in units of @xmath12 .",
    "the parameter @xmath13 is defined in eq .",
    "[ eq : gamma ] .",
    "the closest and farthest orbital separations are @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively , while @xmath16 is the semimajor axis ( all in @xmath17 ) . the orbital period @xmath18 is given in days , and @xmath19 is the eccentricity of the orbit .",
    "the energy fractions @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 are defined in eq .",
    "[ eq : standardce ] , eq .",
    "[ eq : recene ] , and eq . [ eq : totunb ] , respectively .",
    "because energy is well conserved , we can equate equations [ eq : etotin ] and [ eq : totefinal ] .",
    "for that , we also use equations [ eq : standardce ] , [ eq : recene ] , and [ eq : totunb ] .",
    "if we neglect @xmath23 , we can re - write the conservation of energy in fractions of the change in the orbital energy : @xmath24 we find that this is indeed the case in our simulations ( see table  3 ) , and that the deviation from 1 is due to @xmath23 : the maximum deviation occurs in 1.0rg0n ( @xmath25 and the minimum in 1.4rg2n ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "note that if @xmath27 , the previous equation reduces to the standard energy formalism .",
    "however , values of both @xmath28 and @xmath29 are non - negligible and comparable to @xmath30 .",
    "we emphasize that previously it had been anticipated only that @xmath30 is somewhat less than 1 , and we provide new improved constraints .",
    "unfortunately , this is not yet a final solution of the problem as @xmath29 can not be easily predicted for any system  a subject of our future studies .",
    "* orbital angular momenta .",
    "* we find that the ejected material takes away more than 90% of the initial angular momentum of the binary .",
    "values of @xmath13 vary between 1.42 and 1.87 .",
    "this large range of values unfortunately does not allow the obtained values of @xmath13 to be useful for predicting the final parameters in a population synthesis for all possible dwd systems .",
    "* final orbital parameters . *",
    "we find the final orbital separation as @xmath31 , where @xmath14 is the periastron , and @xmath15 is the apastron .",
    "we ensure that these two quantities , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , do not change with time at the moment when we extract them from the simulations .",
    "we calculate the final orbital period @xmath32 of the binary from kepler s third law and the eccentricity of the post - ce orbit as @xmath33 .",
    "the latter is small in all the models , showing that post - ce orbits are almost circular ( in previous studies , where the ejection of the ce was incomplete , the final eccentricity was larger , 0.08 or more , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "cases with our standard resolution .",
    "different @xmath34 s give similar outcomes ( see table  3 ) . ]",
    "figure [ fig : fig4 ] shows the final orbital periods plotted versus initial rg .",
    "we see that , as expected , the more massive the star is , the tighter the orbit gets .",
    "we find also that the final orbital period for the non - synchronized and synchronized cases are very similar ( for the final state of the binary system , the only change due to syncronization was observed for the final eccentricity , albeit final eccentricity is small in all the cases ) .",
    "we conclude that our best progenitor for wd 1101 + 364 is a @xmath35 rg .",
    "to understand the energy budget during a cee leading to a dwd formation , we perform non- and synchronized 3d hydrodynamic simulations with two eoss . we confirm that taking into account recombination energy leads to a full ejection of the rg s envelope and the formation of a non - eccentric binary system ,",
    "whilst if we do not take recombination energy into account , we obtain result similar to previous studies and only half of the rg s envelope is ejected .",
    "the most important consideration appears not to be the value of the available recombination energy , but where and when this energy is released .",
    "indeed , ionized material forms the circumbinary envelope initially .",
    "recombination then takes places there , while the circumbinary envelope continues to expand .",
    "this results in the ejection of the circumbinary envelope and effectively of all the common envelope material .",
    "if instead the recombination energy had been released too early , the simulations would have ended up with unexpelled circumbinary envelope as in previous studies .",
    "in addition , we find that considering a complete synchronization versus non - synchronized case does not change noticeably the final results .",
    "we introduce a modification of the standard energy formalism @xcite , with the parameters describing the use of the recombination energy and the unbound material energy . the first one",
    "can be found from initial stellar models , but the latter requires 3d simulations . for our set of models , @xmath29 has values from about 0.2 to about 0.44 .",
    "however to generalize the result and make it useful for population synthesis one needs to make a thorough parameter study ; this is the subject of our future studies .    as expected , we find that the more massive the parent rg star is , the tighter the final orbit gets .",
    "we do not find that the initial synchronization affects the final period but instead only changes the energy and angular momentum carried away by the ejecta , presumably shaping the post - ce nebula .",
    "we also find that our binaries end up with an eccentricity smaller than 0.04a result that has been expected theoretically but not yet produced in simulations .",
    "we applied our method to the case of wd 1101 + 364 , a well - known dwd ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we inferred that its progenitor binary could have been composed of a @xmath35 rg and a @xmath36 wd companion , with @xmath37 days .",
