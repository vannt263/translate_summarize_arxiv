    "the study of spin phenomena in meson  baryon low - energy scattering provides stringent tests of qcd and its associated effective theory , baryon chiral perturbation theory ( bchpt ) @xcite . because mesons are spinless , and at low energies can be considered nearly structureless , their scattering off baryons is the simplest process from the point of view of baryon spin dynamics . as such , it is of great interest as a probe of , and may lead to important insights into , the structure and dynamics of baryons .",
    "the applicability of bchpt is limited to the near - threshold energies at which meson momenta are much smaller than the chiral symmetry breaking scale . at moderately higher energies , resonances and coupled - channels effects",
    "enter the dynamics that must be either incorporated into the theory or dynamically generated by it . in the three - flavor case",
    "those phenomena may be convolved with a strong - coupling regime originating in the large masses of strange hadrons .",
    "a well - known example is @xmath3 scattering , in which several strongly - coupled channels are open at threshold , leading to a subthreshold resonance , @xmath4 , and rendering bchpt inapplicable to those processes .",
    "many models and techniques have been developed to overcome those difficulties over a period of several decades , that we can not review here . in the specific context of bchpt ,",
    "unitary coupled - channels techniques based on lippmann  schwinger or bethe ",
    "salpeter equations have been succesfully applied to the study of @xmath3 and other meson  baryon processes , even at relatively high energies @xcite .",
    "a unitarization method dealing directly with the chiral effective theory @xmath5-matrix has been introduced in @xcite in the meson sector , and extended to the baryon sector in @xcite . this unitarized baryon chiral perturbation theory ( ubchpt )",
    "has been shown to give accurate descriptions of unpolarized cross - section data in @xmath3 processes @xcite , and in @xmath6 scattering beyond the @xmath7 resonance peak @xcite .",
    "in this paper we consider a particular aspect of hadron spin dynamics , the production of polarized baryons in unpolarized meson  baryon scattering .",
    "specifically , we compute the polarization of the final - state baryon in its rest frame in low - energy two - body meson  baryon scattering with unpolarized initial state , in ubchpt . by low energy we mean incident - meson momentum @xmath8 mev",
    ". we use tree - level bchpt partial waves unitarized with the method of @xcite , and determine their free parameters by fitting total and differential cross - section data ( and spin - asymmetry or polarization data if available ) for @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 scattering .",
    "we also compare our results with those of a previous leading - order bchpt calculation @xcite , with the aim of further probing its domain of applicability .",
    "there is some unavoidable overlap with previous works ( e.g. , @xcite ) since we can only fit our calculations to the same available data as used in the previous literature .",
    "we remark , however , that although the unitarization method we use is the same as in @xcite , our approximation scheme is different because we have to include the full @xmath9- and @xmath10-channel contributions to scattering @xmath11 and @xmath12 partial waves , as well as baryon decuplet contributions , which are quantitatively important for polarization observables in the energy range considered here .",
    "by contrast , in order to obtain a good description of unpolarized cross sections ( for , e.g. , @xmath0 scattering ) , it is enough to use less detailed approximations .",
    "good fits to total cross sections can be obtained by considering only @xmath11-wave scattering , as done at @xmath13 in @xcite and at @xmath14 in @xcite .",
    "denotes a generic quantity of chiral order @xmath15 , with @xmath16 a nominally small quantity such as a meson momentum or mass . ] in @xcite unpolarized differential cross sections are described in terms of @xmath11 and @xmath12 partial waves in a non - relativistic approximation in which some of the contributions mentioned above are of subleading order , therefore neglected .",
    "this is to be expected , since polarized observables are more sensitive to smaller partial waves than unpolarized ones , the latter being usually dominated by large , resonant waves .    in the following section we present our notation and conventions ,",
    "give the explicit form of the tree - level partial waves used throughout the paper , and very briefly discuss the unitarization method applied to those partial waves . in sections",

    "as expected , fit iii  gives slightly better results than i. the contributions to the @xmath11 wave from @xmath9- and @xmath10-channel baryon octet exchange in those fits lead to a significan improvement over the results from nr .",

    "the results for differential cross - section legendre moments are significantly different for the three fits shown in fig .",
