    "ultracold atoms in optical lattices are of great interest for studying strongly correlated states of quantum matter , and such emergent phenomena as superconductivity and magnetism @xcite . stimulated by the discovery of graphene , and ongoing intense research in that field @xcite , optical lattices with",
    "the honeycomb lattice structure are beginning to be explored by various groups @xcite . in the context of graphene , various exotic phenomena related to massless dirac fermions as well as interesting topological phases and quantum phase transitions",
    "have been widely explored @xcite .",
    "while superconductivity still remains elusive in experiments on graphene , it has been the focus of recent theoretical work suggesting chiral superconductivity induced by repulsive interactions @xcite .",
    "earlier , motivated by a possible cold atom realization , where the interatomic interaction may be modelled by an @xmath0-wave attractive contact potential , the attractive fermion hubbard model on the two - dimensional ( 2d ) honeycomb lattice was studied and found to exhibit a quantum phase transition at half - filling between a semimetal with massless dirac fermion excitations and a simple @xmath0-wave superfluid phase @xcite .",
    "this quantum phase transition was shown to be the end point ( with changing density ) of a suitably defined bcs - bec crossover line away from half filling @xcite .",
    "this is reminiscent of the manner in which the usual bcs - bec crossover phenomenon in the continuum in 3d at finite density is linked to the `` zero density quantum critical point '' associated with two - body bound state formation @xcite .",
    "the semimetal to superconductor transition found on the honeycomb lattice is the simplest version of more general band insulator to superfluid transitions discussed in experiments @xcite and theory @xcite .",
    "the critical theory of this semimetal to superconductor transition is also a topic of great recent interest @xcite .    in this paper , motivated by the recent experimental developments reported by the eth group @xcite",
    ", we present a careful study of cooper pairing , superfluid collective modes , and superflow instabilities which limit the critical current in the attractive hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice .",
    "our main results , which go beyond previous work on this topic , are as follows .",
    "( i ) we study the mean field pairing transition temperature @xmath1 in a general _ anisotropic _ honeycomb lattice as has been realized in a `` brick - wall '' type of geometry in the eth experiments @xcite , with hoppings as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.asymcouplings ] . for weak coupling , the maximum @xmath1 , as a function of fermion density and interaction strength , is found to occur in the isotropic limit .",
    "we then argue more generally that the vicinity of this isotropic point , with all hoppings being equal , is the most promising limit to experimentally explore the superfluidity of atomic fermions .",
    "( ii ) in this limit of isotropic hopping , we compute the collective modes in the superfluid , treating both density and phase fluctuations on equal footing in contrast to previous work which only studied superconducting fluctuations @xcite .",
    "we find evidence for the expected sharp anderson - bogoliubov ( ab ) sound mode ; in addition , over a wide swath of the phase diagram , we uncover a well - defined leggett mode , which involves intra - unit - cell coupled oscillations of the density and superfluid order parameter phase .",
    "( iii ) imposing a nonzero superflow , we find that the superfluid phase becomes unstable via either a depairing instability or collective charge modulational instabilities driven by a softening of the collective mode spectrum .",
    "the superfluid is most stable against depairing in the vicinity of special fillings associated with van hove ( vh ) singularities in the density of states ; in this regime , at mean field level , we find the emergence of a supercurrent induced gapless superfluid state .",
    "the collective charge modulational instabilities that we uncover include tendencies towards forming incommensurate charge orders , stripe - like modulations , or sublattice symmetry breaking charge density wave ( cdw ) order . aside from the depairing instability , which occurs primarily at small fermion density or in the weak attraction limit , we expect such _ collective instabilities _ to limit the critical current in this system .",
    "in fact , the current - induced gapless superfluid state we uncover in mean field theory is preempted by such collective dynamical or landau instabilities for the intermediate coupling regime .",
    "furthermore , the sublattice cdw order or the instability associated with this cdw order arises from a subtle pseudospin su(2 ) symmetry of the attractive hubbard model at half filling ; probing for such cdw order can thus serve as a strong diagnostic tool to ascertain that the attractive one band hubbard model is an appropriate description of the low energy physics in a deep optical lattice .",
    "our predictions can be tested by using bragg scattering experiments to study the collective mode spectrum .",
    "the results described above are obtained using a generalized random phase approximation ( grpa ) complemented by strong coupling `` pseudospin''-wave theory where appropriate .",
    "our work here builds on similar previous studies addressing the collective modes and critical current - limiting instabilities on square and cubic optical lattices @xcite . in those cases",
    ", it has been shown that the collective mode spectrum of @xmath0-wave superfluids exhibits , in addition to the long wavelength ab sound mode , a sharp ` roton minimum ' near the corner of the brillouin zone ( bz ) due to strong cdw fluctuations , and ` roton mode softening ' leads to a collective dynamical instability of superflow .",

    "we conclude by discussing implications for experiments .",
