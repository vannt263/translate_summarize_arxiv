    "the region around the dynamic center of our galaxy is very active recently in massive star formation ( e.g. , figer et al .",
    "1999 ) , which should have yielded various high - energy products such as supernova remnants ( snrs ) and neutron stars ( e.g. , morris & serabyn 1996 ; cordes & lazio 1997 ; wang , gotthelf & lang 2002 ) .",
    "young and fast - rotating neutron stars , in particular , may be observable as pulsars , although none is yet known within @xmath4 radius of the galactic center ( gc ) .",
    "detection of radio pulsars in the gc region is difficult , because of the severe radio wave scattering by intervening interstellar ionized gas ( cordes & lazio 1997 ) . on the other hand , two of the polarized radio nonthermal filaments ( ntfs ;",

    "_ chandra _ observations have further revealed various diffuse x - ray filaments with unusually hard spectra , which are also signatures of pwne .",
    "however , no specific link has so far been proposed between such radio / x - ray features and pwne .    here",
    "we report a strong candidate for a pwn that links an x - ray thread g0.13 - 0.11 and the prominent ntfs in the radio arc region ( galactic longitude @xmath5 ; fig .  1 ;",

    "this x - ray thread g0.13 - 0.11 was first apparent in the images of yusef - zadeh et al .",
    "the diffuse x - ray emission from the neighboring molecular cloud g0.13 - 0.13 ( oka et al . 2001 ) has been further investigated by yusef - zadeh , law , & wardle ( 2002 ) .",
    "they considered the x - ray thread as part of a large - scale diffuse feature that emits the 6.4-kev fluorescent line , which results from the filling of k - shell vacancies of neutral or weakly - ionized irons ( koyama et al .",
    "1996 ; wang , gotthelf , & lang 2002 ; wang 2002 ; yusef - zadeh , law , & wardle 2002 ) . because the prominent x - ray thread is on the side of the molecular cloud that is opposite to sgr a@xmath6",
    ", they concluded that the 6.4-kev line emission could not represent the reflection of a possible recent radiation burst from the central massive black hole .",
    "however , our examination of related _ chandra _ observations shows that the 6.4-kev line is clearly not associated with the x - ray thread g0.13 - 0.11 , although the molecular cloud is indeed a strong 6.4-kev line emitter ( e.g. , fig .  2 ;",

    "we have conducted morphological and spectral analyses of both g0.13 - 0.11 and an embedded point - like source .",

    "( 2002 ) and yusef - zadeh , law , & wardle ( 2002 ) , we included the recent gc ridge survey data ( obs . i d # 2273 , 2276 , 2282 and 2284  @xmath7 ks each ; wang , gotthelf , & lang 2002 ) and the cycle-1 observation pointed at sgr a@xmath6 ( 50 ks ; obs .",

    "we searched for x - ray sources in individual observations ( wang , gotthelf , & lang 2002 ) . the source position centroids are uncertain , both statistically and systematically .",
    "the statistical uncertainty depends on the count rate of a source and on the point spread function , which is a function of the off - axis angle of the source in an observation . in order to correct for the systematic pointing offset",
    ", we select sources with 2@xmath8 statistical uncertainty radii less than @xmath9 .",
    "we examined position coincidences between the x - ray sources detected in the deep observation ( i d # 945 ) and various optical / near - ir objects ( e.g. , eso / st - ecf usno - a2.0 and 2mass catalogs ) . while no coincidence was found within the 2@xmath8 statistical uncertainty radii of the x - ray source centroids , we considered objects projected within the 3@xmath10 radii of the x - ray sources . the foreground f0 star , hd316314 ( b=9.94 , v=9.51 ) stands out , which is the brightest optical object within the radii .",
    "the corresponding point - like x - ray counterpart has an acis - i count rate of 0.026 @xmath11 and a very soft spectrum .",
    "a match between the x - ray centroid and the tycho reference catalog position of the star ( @xmath12 ; hog et al .",
    "1998 ) requires a shift of the x - ray   statistical uncertainty radii ) .",
    "the limiting r - band magnitude for the selected optical objects , for example , is 17.5 . from the residual optical / x - ray position offsets of these associations",
    ", we infer that the positional inaccuracy after the correction has been made should be less than @xmath13 .",
    "the location of the quintuplet cluster is also indicated in fig .  1 .",
    "this gc cluster contains numerous massive stars including the luminous pistol star ( figer et al .",
    "however , we detect only one possible x - ray counterpart of a cluster member .",
    "we find no counterpart for the bright x - ray source just north of g0.13 - 0.11 , which is not considered to be part of the x - ray thread ( right panel in fig .  1 ) .",
    "the focus of this paper is the x - ray thread g0.13 - 0.11 that borders a bow - shaped radio protrusion from the sheath of prominent ntfs and surrounds an embedded point - like x - ray source   ( @xmath14 with an 1@xmath8 statistical uncertainty of @xmath15 ) , marked as `` pulsar ? '' in figs .  1 - 2 .",
    "we have carefully examined possible counterparts of this source in other wavelength bands .",
    "the nearest optical / near - ir object around the x - ray source is u0600 - 28642574 ( b=17.5 ) at ra , dec @xmath16 ( j2000 ) , about 4@xmath170 from the x - ray centroid .",
    "this separation far exceeds the position uncertainty of the x - ray source .",
    "furthermore , the optical and near - ir colors of u0600 - 28642574 suggest that it is a nearby late - type star ( later than m0 ) with little interstellar extinction , which is inconsistent with the large column density inferred from the x - ray spectrum (  3 ) .",
    "we thus conclude that  and u0600 - 28642574 do not represent the same object .",
    "fig .  2 presents a close - up of the g0.13 - 0.11 field .",
    "the x - ray thread g0.13 - 0.13 extends @xmath18 to the southeast from the source  and has an intrinsic width of @xmath19 .",
    "3 shows potential instrumental effects in the same region as in fig .  2 . the morphology and intensity of the northwestern part of g0.13 - 0.11 , in particular ,",
    "are weakly constrained because of the poor counting statistics within a gap between ccd chips of the observation # 945 .",
    "the intrinsic morphology of g0.13 - 0.11 could be quite symmetric about the source , and thus more extensive to the northwest .",
    "4 compares the radial surface brightness profile of the source and the telescope point spread function at the position of the observation # 945 .",
    "it is clear that the source is point - like and can not simply be a bright clump of g0.13 - 0.11 .    fig .",
    "5 shows the spectra of both g0.13 - 0.11 and .",
    "we extracted the spectral data from the observation # 945 , which was also used by yusef - zadeh , law & wardle ( 2002 ) .",
    "as shown in fig .  2 , the extraction radius for  is 15 , and a rectangular region is used for g0.13 - 0.11 .",
    "the 6.4-kev line is completely absent in the x - ray spectra of both sources .",
    "while the limited quality of the x - ray data alone does not allow for a serious testing of spectral models , we consider various possible origins of the x - ray emission .",
    "for example , although an one - temperature raymond - smith thermal plasma model gives a statistically acceptable fit , the inferred temperature has a 99@xmath20 lower limit of 8 kev , which is too high to be consistent with a thermal supernova remnant interpretation . assuming",
    "a two - temperature thermal plasma model does not solve the problem .",
    "the temperatures , if allowed to change freely , converge to the same values as high as 64 kev . if one temperature is fixed at a value of about a few kev , the other component , assuming a much higher temperature , then dominates the overall x - ray spectrum . in short , a thermal model with a temperature of a few kev has a too steep spectrum to be consistent with the data .    furthermore , to match the observed flat spectrum with a low energy cutoff requires large amounts of absorption , which in turn demands a high emission measure .",
    "for instance , assuming that the plasma has a single temperature of 2 kev and that the depth of the x - ray - emitting region is comparable to the width ( @xmath212@xmath22 ) of g0.13 - 0.11 , we estimate the absorbing gas column density ( 90% confidence interval ) as 5.0(3.5 - 6.5)@xmath23 @xmath24 and a thermal pressure of @xmath25 .",
    "this pressure appears too great for the thermal gas to be confined . even within the brightest ntfs ,",
    "the dominant magnetic field pressure is @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the magnetic field strength in units of milli - gauss ( e.g. , yusef - zadeh & morris 1987 ) .",
    "therefore , both the high surface brightness and the flat spectral characteristics strongly suggest that the x - ray emission from g0.13 - 0.11 is nonthermal .    we have also tested the bremsstrahlung spectral model proposed by valinia et al .",
    "( 2000 ) . in this case , k - shell vacancies of iron atoms are produced by collisions with low energy cosmic - ray electrons .",
    "the model is approximately a combination of a power law with an energy slope of 1.4 and a gaussian line centered at 6.4 kev .",
    "the predicted flux ratio of the 6.4-kev line to the 2  10 kev continuum is about 1/26 .",
    "the spectrum of g0.13 - 0.11 , however , shows no sign of the 6.4-kev line . we can rule out the line - to - continuum flux ratio with a confidence of @xmath28 .",
    "a simple power law gives satisfactory fits to the x - ray spectra of both the thread g0.13 - 0.11 and the point - like source   ( fig .",
    "the best - fit energy slope is 0.9(0.2  1.8 ) for the source and 1.8(1.4  2.5 ) for the thread .",
    "the jointly - fitted x - ray - absorbing gas column density is @xmath29 .",
    "the column densities , if fitted separately for the two spectra , are consistent with each other , albeit with larger uncertainties .",
    "there is also statistically marginal evidence for the steepening of the power law with the distance from the source .",
    "the background - removed count flux ratio of the 4  8 kev band over the 2  4 kev band is 1.24@xmath300.24 in the portion of the thread close to the source ( the part of the rectangular box northwest to the dashed line in fig .  2 ) and 0.92@xmath300.19 in the portion away from the source ( southeastern part ) .",
    "we infer the total absorption - corrected luminosity as @xmath31 for the thread and @xmath32 for the source in the 0.1  2.4 kev ( 2  10 kev ) band , respectively .",
    "the above morphological and spectral results place tight constraints on the nature of the point - like source  and the x - ray thread g0.13 - 0.11 .",
    "the only satisfactory interpretation that we have found is that these x - ray sources represent an isolated young pulsar and its pwn , which are likely located near the gc , consistent with the x - ray absorption measured . in this scenario ,",
    "the x - ray emission from the pwn , results naturally from the synchrotron cooling of shocked pulsar wind particles ( electrons and positrons ) . using the empirical relation between @xmath33 and the spin - down luminosity ( @xmath34 ) for x - ray - emitting pulsars ( becker & trmper 1997 ) or for pulsar+pwn systems",
    "( seward & wang 1998 ) , we estimate @xmath34 for the putative pulsar to be a few times @xmath35 , typical of an x - ray - emitting pulsar .",
    "the power law spectra we obtained for these sources are also characteristic of such a pulsar and its pwn ( e.g. , gotthelf & olbert 2002 ) .",
    "the x - ray morphology of our proposed pulsar / pwn system , however , is quite unique .",
    "we speculate that the slightly - curved linear morphology is due to the strong and organized interstellar magnetic field environment of the gc region ( lang et al .",
    "1999 and references therein ) .",
    "studies of the interaction between the ntfs and molecular clouds indicate a magnetic field strength of @xmath36 mg along the ntfs ( e.g. , yusef - zadeh & morris 1987 ; anantharamaiah et al . 1991 ; morris & serabyn 1996 and references therein ) , although the magnetic field may be weaker in the general interstellar medium .",
    "the orientation of the magnetic field ( traced by radio polarization ) in the vicinity of g0.13 - 0.11 follows the long axis of the ntfs in the radio arc , i.e. , nearly perpendicular to the galactic plane ( yusef - zadeh & morris 1987 ) .",
    "1 shows that the x - ray thread has a similar orientation , though not aligned with any particular ntf .",
    "this similarity indicates that the pwn may be confined by the local magnetic field .",
    "x - ray emission traces high - energy particles in the pwn , which are most likely accelerated at the reverse shock of the pulsar wind and then move primarily along magnetic field lines .",
    "the expansion of the shocked pulsar wind ( unlikely to be freely expanding ) should have a velocity smaller than the thermal velocity of @xmath37 .",
    "the x - ray - emitting synchrotron lifetime of the particles is short , @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the x - ray photon energy in units of kev . from the characteristic angular scale of 40@xmath10 from   to the southeastern end of g0.13 - 0.11 , we infer @xmath40 mg .",
    "furthermore , the balance between the ram - pressure of the pulsar wind and the magnetic field pressure gives a characteristic scale of @xmath41^{1/2}$ ] at the distance of 8 kpc .",
    "because this scale should be smaller than the observed width ( @xmath19 ) of the x - ray thread g0.13 - 0.11 , we have @xmath42 mg .",
    "the required magnetic field thus seems to be quite reasonable for the general interstellar medium in the gc region .",
    "our interpretation of the x - ray thread g0.13 - 0.11 as the leading - edge of a pwn also predicts the presence of an extended radio - emitting region .",
    "the radio synchrotron lifetime of an electron is on the order of @xmath43 , about four orders of magnitude longer than the x - ray - emitting particle lifetime .",
    "therefore , the radio emission in such a system represents the accumulation of pulsar wind material and traces the overall morphology ( and `` history '' ) of the pwn .",
    "we have obtained and reprocessed archival radio data of this region originally observed with the vla at 20 and 6 cm in the dnc and cnb array configurations ( yusef - zadeh et al .",
    "1984 , yusef - zadeh & morris 1987 ) in order to compare these images to the distribution of x - ray emission and to study the spectral properties of the radio emission .",
    "an examination of the radio images shows no counterpart of the x - ray source .",
    "this is not a surprise even if the source is a young pulsar .",
    "the pulsed radio emission may be beamed away from us , or the heavy interstellar scattering may have significantly diffused the emission ( cordes & lazio 1997 ) .",
    "1 shows that the curvature of the x - ray thread g0.13 - 0.11 closely corresponds to the edge of a protrusion of diffuse radio emission from the southwestern edge of the prominent radio arc ntfs .",
    "this combination of the features suggests that our proposed pwn is produced by a pulsar moving in a strong and organized magnetic field environment .",
    "morphologically , g0.13 - 0.11 differs from the crab nebula , in which its corresponding pulsar is deeply embedded",
    ". instead , g0.13 - 0.11 shows similarities to ram - pressure confined pwne , such as the duck / psr1757 - 24 ( thorsett et al . 2002 ) and lmc snr n157b / psr j0537 - 6910 ( wang et al . 2001 ) , both of which show offsets of x - ray - emitting pulsars from radio peaks . in these latter systems ,",
    "the x - ray emission arises from freshly shocked pulsar winds ( thus from regions close to the pulsars ) whereas radio emission arises from particles swept up ( into a `` trail '' ) by the ram - pressure over the lifetime of the nebula .",
    "however , in the case of g0.13 - 0.11 , the magnetic field likely plays a dominant role in confining and transporting shocked pulsar wind particles . as a result",
    ", a moving pulsar would leave a pwn ( a bow - shaped trail of shocked wind particles ) that expands primarily along the direction of magnetic field lines .",
    "the morphological properties of the protrusion , the ntfs , and g0.13 - 0.11 together suggest a likely trajectory of the pulsar from the northeast to the present position . in this scenario",
    ", the synchrotron - emitting relativistic particles from the passing pulsar would cause the ntfs in the radio arc to be illuminated .",
    "the ntf ( marked as `` curved ntf '' in fig .",
    "1 ) that apparently most adjacent to g0.13 - 0.11 also shows more curvature than any of the other ntfs in the radio arc .",
    "the curvature of the ntfs and g0.13 - 0.11 may be a result of the balance between the magnetic field tension and the thermal pressure of the pwn .",
    "for the pulsar to cross the radio arc ntfs and the protrusion ( @xmath44 or 10 pc at the gc ) requires @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the pulsar proper motion speed .",
    "interestingly , this time is consistent with the spin - down age ( @xmath47 years ) of the pulsar expected from the observed x - ray luminosity ( becker & trmper 1997 ) , and may be compared to the radio synchrotron lifetime of the particles .",
    "we have examined the radio spectral index in the ntfs and in the protrusion of radio emission just below the ntfs ( fig .",
    "we have obtained comparable spatial resolutions ( @xmath21 10 ) by using the 20-cm cnb array data and the 6-cm dnc data .",
    "one concern , of course , is that the lack of total radio power in these interferometric observations may affect the absolute measurement of the spectral index . the globally averaged 20/6-cm spectral index over a circular region of 2  radius centered at ra , dec ( j2000 ) @xmath48 .",
    "gives a value of @xmath49@xmath21 + 0.1 ( where s@xmath50 @xmath51 @xmath52 ) .",
    "this value is consistent with the average spectral index ( @xmath49@xmath21 + 0.2@xmath300.1 ) measured by reich et al .",
    "( 1988 ) for the radio arc , using single - dish data . using well - matched interferometric data therefore does not seem to significantly bias the spectral index measurement .    while the nature of the flat or slightly positive spectral index remains unclear",
    ", we speculate that the radio - emitting particles in the radio arc ntfs are not accelerated by shocks , which would yield a steep ( negative index ) synchrotron spectrum . in our interpretation",
    ", the particles represent the thermalized pulsar wind .",
    "because the wind is believed to be ultra - relativistic and to be thermalized at the reverse shock , no acceleration is required for radio synchrotron particles .",
    "the thermalization alone would result in a maxwellian particle energy distribution .",
    "the particles on the lower energy part of this distribution could give rise to a positive spectral index of the radio synchrotron emission .",
    "this interpretation is similar to the idea that the positive spectral index could be a result of the synchrotron emission from particles of a mono - energetic distribution ( e.g. , reich et al .",
    "in contrast , x - ray - emitting synchrotron particles , which should be on the higher energy side of the maxwellian distribution , require acceleration in the pwn , most likely at the reverse shock .    we may further expect to detect the aging of the radio - emitting particles in the pwn as a function of the distance from the pulsar .",
    "in the protrusion of diffuse radio emission directly adjacent to g0.13 - 0.11 ( fig .",
    "6 ) , the limited signal - to - noise ratio of the radio data allows for only an estimate of the integrated spectral index of @xmath53 .",
    "however , across the radio arc , we investigated the distribution of spectral index ( figs .",
    "6 - 7 ) . along all three cross - cuts ,",
    "the spectral indices of the ntfs have an average value of @xmath21 + 0.4 at the southwestern edge of the radio arc , and steepen to an average value of @xmath21 -0.1 in the northeastern ( i.e. toward the numbers labelled 1 - 3 ) region .",
    "this spectral index steepening is consistent with our interpretation that the particles are being supplied by the pulsar along its northeast - to - southwest trajectory .",
    "we have studied the x - ray thread g0.13 - 0.11 and the embedded point - like x - ray source  as well as the adjacent nonthermal radio emission in the radio arc region .",
    "the morphological and spectral properties of these features appear to be consistent with our pwn interpretation .",
    "we hope that this study will stimulate observational and theoretical studies to further explore the connection between pulsars and various nonthermal features observed in the unique gc environment .",
    "the ultimate confirmation of the pwn interpretation requires the detection of the pulsed signal from the putative pulsar , which could be achieved with future radio and/or x - ray observations with fast timing capabilities .",
