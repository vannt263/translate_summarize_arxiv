    "the fact that some radio spurs can be joined into small circles is very well known .",
    "the sets of spurs which form small circles are called loops . during the early seventies ,",
    "four major loops were recognized .",
    "their discoveries and studies took place in this order : loop i ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , loop ii ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , loop iii ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and loop iv ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . salter in 1970 . gave the most precise determination of these circles parameters , which were later published in @xcite .",
    "the data salter used were the best available at the time at 408 , 404 , 240 and 178 mhz .",
    "a detailed review of the subject was published by @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite made an observation that some other spurs could be connected into loops .",
    "they proposed loop v to be formed by negative latitude spurs in taurus , pisces and pegasus and loop vi to correspond to the weak positive latitudes spurs in leo and cancer . using the survey at 38 mhz by @xcite they computed parameters of the proposed loops .    in order to study the structure of galactic radio loop emission , it is necessary to determine their spectral indices .",
    "the differential spectral indices of the north polar spur ( nps ) , the spurs in aquarius , pegasus and taurus were derived using data at 1420 , 408 and 38 mhz @xcite .",
    "the technique used was that of temperature - temperature plots ( @xmath0 plots ) .",
    "@xcite gives indices for the spurs seen on her survey .",
    "@xcite derived differential temperature spectral indices between 404 and 38 mhz .",
    "spectral index variations of the galactic radio continuum emission were discussed in several papers . @xcite has studied these variations across the northern sky between 1420 and 38 mhz and suggested that the obtained values ( about 2.5 ) are mainly due to the effects of loops i and iii . also , @xcite used radio continuum surveys at 1420 and 408 mhz to calculate a map of spectral indices across the northern sky and found significant variations between 2.3 and 3.0 .",
    "the steepest spectra corresponded to the north polar spur and loop iii .",
    "the same authors @xcite gave the estimation @xmath1 for loops i and iii which are believed to be nearby , very old supernova remnants .",
    "these estimates were mostly derived using the method of @xmath0 plots over areas of the sky where no strong local features are superposed on the general galactic background .",
    "@xcite studied the spectrum of the galactic non - thermal background radiation using observations at 408 , 610 and 1407 mhz and found that the mean differential temperature spectral index was close to 2.8 .    with the aim of studying spectral indices of the major radio loops i - iv , as well as of the radio loops v and",
    "vi , we used radio continuum surveys at three frequencies : 1420 mhz @xcite , 820 mhz @xcite , 408 mhz @xcite and calculated the corresponding mean temperatures and brightnesses . knowing three values of brightnesses , the spectral indices could be calculated as coefficients of linear fits to logaritmic temperature versus frequency plots . until now",
    ", there were no generated spectra using mean temperatures for ( at least ) two different frequencies , as is necessary for forming the simplest linear kind of spectrum .",
    "all earlier determinations of the radio loop spectral indices were based on @xmath0 methods .",
    "the reality of loops i - vi is investigated by comparing the values of their spectral indices with earlier mentioned studies of spectral indices distribution across the northern sky .",
    "in addition , diameters and distances of loops i - vi were calculated using the @xmath2 relation for snrs given by @xcite .",
    "the surveys at 1420 mhz @xcite and 820 mhz @xcite and at 408 mhz @xcite provided the database for the recomputing of small circles for the major loops .",
    "the data were obtained from the 1420-mhz stockert survey @xcite , the 820-mhz dwingeloo survey @xcite and the 408-mhz all - sky survey @xcite . the angular resolutions are 35@xmath3 and 1@xmath4.2 and 0@xmath4.85 , respectively .",
    "the effective sensitivities are about 50 mk t@xmath5 ( t@xmath5 is for an average brightness temperature ) at 1420 mhz , 0.20 k at 820 mhz , and about 1.0 k at 408 mhz .",
    "these data are available@xmath6 on mpifr s survey sampler (  max  planck  institut fr radioastronomie  , bonn ) .",
    "this is an on - line service ( http://www.mpifr-bonn.mpg.de/survey.html ) , which allows users to pick a region of the sky and obtain images at a number of wavelengths .",
    "the 1420 , 820 and 408 mhz continuum surveys specified in section 2 were used to derive brightness temperature vs frequency spectra , and the spectral indices of loops i - vi were derived from these .",
    "the average brightness temperatures of the loops at the three frequencies were estimated from the survey data .",
    "the areas of the loops were divided into different sections ( corresponding to spurs ) and estimates for these sections were combined .",
    "the longitude and latitude ranges which include spurs of the loops i - vi are given in table [ tab01 ] .",
    "the areas inside the spurs were chosen using the three surveys specified above .",
    "background radiation was subtracted in this way .",
    "first , the temperature of the loop plus background was determined .",
    "next , the background alone near the loop was estimated . finally , we calculated the difference of these values to yield the average temperature of the loop .",
    "average 1420 , 820 and 408 mhz brightness temperatures and surface brightnesses derived assuming the rayleigh - jeans approximation to hold , are presented in table [ tab02 ] .    assuming the spectra to have a power - law form :    @xmath7    we get :    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is spectral index and k is a constant .",
    "knowing three values of brightnesses ( derived in this paper ) we were able to derive spectral indices from fitting equation ( 2 ) to the data .",
    "the results are given in table [ tab03 ] .",
    "temperatures at 1 ghz were calculated by use of the spectral indices :    @xmath10    we have converted these values that have been extrapolated to 1 ghz into surface brightness and present them in table [ tab04 ] .",
    "the areas used to represent the individual loops were obtained from the radio continuum map of @xcite in such a way that they contain the brightness temperature contours enclosing the spur features that define the loop . the longitude and latitude ranges of each",
    "are given in table [ tab01 ] .",
    "contour lines which correspond to the minimum and maximum brightness temperatures for each spur , are taken to define their borders .",
    "t@xmath11 is the lower temperature limit between the background and the spur and t@xmath12 is the upper temperature limit between the spur and unrelated confusing sources ( superposed on the spur and hence requiring elimination from the calculation ) . in this manner background radiation was considered as radiation that would exist if there were no spurs .",
    "we used averages over the data within these two curves : the contour for t@xmath11 and the contour for t@xmath12 .    for evaluating brightness temperatures of the background",
    ", we used all measured values below t@xmath11 , inside the corresponding intervals of galactic longitude ( l ) and galactic latitude ( b ) , and lying on the outer side of a spur .",
    "the value of t@xmath5 is approximately constant near a spur . for evaluating the brightness temperatures of a loop including the background , we used all measured values between t@xmath11 and t@xmath12 inside the corresponding regions of l and b. if the value of t@xmath11 ( or t@xmath12 ) is changed by a small amount , say approximately @xmath13 ( i.e. 0.1 k for 1420 mhz , 0.4 k for 820 mhz and 2 k for 408 mhz ) , the brightness contours become significantly different .",
    "if t@xmath11 is too small , the area of the spur becomes confused with the background and it becomes obvious that the border has been incorrectly chosen .",
    "if t@xmath12 is too large , the area of the spur includes significant contributions from unrelated confusing sources .",
    "mean brightness temperatures for spurs are found by subtracting the mean values of background brightness temperature from the mean values of the brightness temperature over the areas of the spurs .",
    "we calculated the mean background levels over regions not too far outside the spurs because the loops are moving through regions of the interstellar medium where earlier supernova remnants are likely to have passed , i.e. through a low density medium produced by earlier snrs ( or other energetic phenomena ) @xcite .",
    "we used averages over the defined areas and subtracted from these the average values for the background regions obtained as described above .    [ cols=\"<,<,<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab01 ]    the areas over which an average brightness temperature is determined at each of the three frequencies are taken to be as similar as possible within the limits of measurement accuracy .",
    "moreover , in some cases ( e.g. at 1420 mhz for loops iv and vi ) , we used values of t@xmath11 and t@xmath12 which are below this limit ( see table [ tab01 ] ) in order to make the corresponding areas the most comparable .",
    "however , some differences between these areas still remain and we think that the major causes of differing borders between the three frequencies are small random and systematic errors in the calibrated data .",
    "the results for the six loops are presented in tables [ tab02 ] and [ tab03 ] .",
    "table [ tab02 ] shows calculated average brightness temperatures and surface brightnesses at 1420 , 820 and 408 mhz .",
    "these results are in good agreement with results obtained by @xcite , only that the present results are obtained with more sample points",
    ". as one can see from table [ tab01 ] , the first two regions of loop v are located inside the area of loop ii . the results corresponding to these two loops , presented in table [ tab02 ] , are calculated out of their overlapping regions . however , we also performed calculations for complete areas of loops ii and v ( including overlapping regions ) and obtained practically the same results for loop ii . in the case of the whole loop v , the results for @xmath14 are slightly different from those given in table [ tab02 ] : 0.14 k at 1420 mhz , 0.51 k at 820 mhz and 5.1 k at 408 mhz .",
    "this difference is probably caused by superposition of radiation from both loops .",
    "spectra are presented in figs 1  6 , with table [ tab03 ] giving the spectral indices computed for loops i - vi .",
