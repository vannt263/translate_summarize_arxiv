    "damping of magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) waves is of importance to the solar coronal heating problem ( e.g. ref.@xcite and references therein ) and tokamak plasmas @xcite .",
    "phase mixing of harmonic alfven waves ( aw ) , which propagate in plasma which has a density inhomogeneity in transverse to the uniform background magnetic field ( ubmf ) direction , results in their fast damping in the density gradient regions . in this case",
    "the dissipation time scales as @xmath3 . where @xmath4 is the lundquist number .",
    "@xmath5 is plasma resistivity , while @xmath6 and @xmath7 are characteristic length- and velocity- scales of the system .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that aw amplitude damps in time as @xmath8 , where symbols have their usual meaning and @xmath9 denotes alfven speed derivative in the density inhomogeneity direction .",
    "phase mixing of alfven waves which have gaussian profile along the background magnetic field results in somewhat slower , power - law damping , @xmath10 , as established in ref.@xcite , whilst more elegantly ( in mathematical sense ) derived in ref . .",
    "in a different physical contexts it was shown that exponentially diverging magnetic field lines provide even faster damping @xmath11 , resulting in the wave damping timescale as @xmath12 .",
    "ref.@xcite considered small - amplitude aw packets in wkb approximation in arnold - beltrami - childress ( abc ) magnetic field , which for certain set of parameters and in known regions of space possesses property of exponentially diverging magnetic fields .",
    "using wkb reduced version of mhd equations they have convincingly demonstrated that when a random number of aw packets are injected in the said abc field , two distinct populations emerge : ( i ) ones that dissipate quickly whose damping time @xmath12 and ( ii ) slowly dissipating aw packets whose damping time scales as @xmath3 . moreover",
    ", they have established that quickly dissipating aw packets can be associated with damping in exponentially divergent magnetic field regions of the simulation domain , while slowly dissipating aw packets damp in smooth , magnetic - flux - tube - like regions of space .",
    "also , exponentially diverging magnetic fields were discussed in the context of magnetic reconnection @xcite .    to our knowledge",
    "the present study is the first that investigates aw damping in abc magnetic fields using a general , rather than wkb version of 3d resistive mhd equations .",
    "therefore the present work can account for ( i ) time evolution of the background magnetic field and ( ii ) the effect of launched alfvenic waves on the physical system .",
    "the latter is not at all a trivial matter , as there are works that show in the solar coronal plasma context that directly coupling the low beta coronal evolution to prescribed photospheric motions of the magnetic footpoints allows strong magnetic energy accumulation in the corona .",
    "they argue that this amounts to ignoring a possible feedback from coronal loops on photospheric motions .",
    "however , the energy injected into the corona comes from the photosphere , so in principle the coronal loop might act as a conduit communicating photospheric dynamics from one region to another .",
    "section ii presents the model and results .",
    "section iii summarises the main findings .",
    "the numerical simulations presented here are performed using lare3d @xcite  a lagrangian remap code for solving non - linear mhd equations in 3d spatial dimensions .",
    "the code is second order accurate in space and time .",
    "the use of shock viscosity and gradient limiters make the code ideally suited to shock calculations .",

    "motivated by ref.@xcite , who studied small - amplitude aw packets in wkb approximation in abc magnetic fields , we relax the approximation and solve fully 3d mhd problem .",
    "ref.@xcite drew a distinction between 2d aw dissipation via phase mixing , with aw dissipation time scaling of @xmath0 , and 3d aw dissipation via exponentially divergent magnetic field lines , with dissipation time scaling of @xmath1 .",
    "they also suggested that for @xmath116 no clear distinction could be drawn between the two regimes , as the large resistivity @xmath117 made damping too strong . in the current study because we used full 3d mhd simulations ( as opposed to wkb approximation used by ref.@xcite ) we could not access large enough end simulation times for the damping to be noticeable in the small resistivity regime .",
    "thus testing of the above aw damping scaling laws within full mhd is still not achieved .",
    "however , we found other interesting effects : we studied two types of aw perturbations : ( i ) a gaussian pulse with length - scale much shorter than abc domain length and ( ii ) a harmonic aw with wavelength equal to abc domain length .",
    "we have shown that aws dissipate quickly in the abc field .",
    "our results are surprising in that aws magnetic perturbation energies increase in time , monotonously or in time - transient manner , depending on the spatial scale of the aw disturbance , within the considered end simulation time . in the case of the harmonic aw the perturbation energy growth is transient in time , attaining peaks in both velocity and magnetic perturbation energies within timescales much smaller than the resistive time . in the case of the gaussian aw pulse",
    "the velocity perturbation energy growth is also transient in time , attaining a peak within few resistive times , while magnetic perturbation energy continues to grow .",
    "we find that the total magnetic energy decreases in time and this is prescribed by the resistive evolution of the background abc magnetic field rather than aw damping .",
    "moreover , in the case of uniform background magnetic field , the total magnetic energy decrease in time is prescribed by aw damping , because of the absence of resistive evolution of the background .",
    "we then considered runs with different amplitudes and performed analysis of the perturbation spectra .",
    "we excluded both ( i ) a possible dynamo action by aw perturbation - induced peristaltic flow and ( ii ) an inverse cascade of magnetic energy .",
    "the only remaining reasonable explanation to the perturbation energy growth is a new instability .",
    "the growth rate seems to be dependent of the value of the resistivity and also on the spatial scale of the aw disturbance .",
    "further analysis is needed in order to determine the exact mathematical nature of the growth rate dependence on these parameters .",
    "the main conclusion is that in the complex , exponentially diverging magnetic fields that can occur e.g. in the lower solar corona , in cusps of earth magnetosphere and/or tokamak / stellarator , abc - like background magnetic field , with periodic boundary conditions , evolve significantly in time caused by the slow diffusion . the deviations from the initial state can be as large as 0.03 ( with initial background magnetic fields being of the order of unity ) within @xmath118 alfven times .",
    "thus , the fast damping in these entangled magnetic fields , as predicted by the wkb approximation , seems not to be guaranteed .",
