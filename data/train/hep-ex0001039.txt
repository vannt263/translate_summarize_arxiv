    "the search for the sm higgs at lep2 is well understood .",
    "the reach depends on the centre of mass energy which can be achieved , and the integrated luminosity obtained . for 150",
    "pb@xmath0 per experiment at @xmath3  gev , higgs masses @xmath4  gev will be ruled out@xcite .",
    "the lep energy may be pushed a few gev higher , but to go much beyond this will require the use of the tevatron .",
    "much interest in the tevatron s potential for higgs searches was sparked by work carried out during the run  ii susy / higgs workshop in 1998@xcite .",
    "the higgs cross section at the tevatron is large ( 1  pb for @xmath5  gev ) but since the @xmath6 process dominates , there is a huge qcd background . for higgs masses below 130140",
    "gev , the best potential seems to come from the processes where a @xmath7 or @xmath8 is produced in association with the higgs :    * @xmath9 : backgrounds from @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , single top .",
    "a factor of 1.3 improvement in signal to background has been demonstrated in this channel by using a neural network compared to standard cuts .",
    "it is also possible that additional gains may be had if the angular distributions ( @xmath13 , spin zero , vs. @xmath14 , spin one ) can be exploited .",
    "@xmath15 is overwhelmed by the qcd background .",
    "* @xmath16 : backgrounds from @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath12 .",
    "* @xmath19 : backgrounds from qcd , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath12 .",
    "this requires a relatively soft missing @xmath20 trigger ( 35  gev ) but is powerful because of the large @xmath21 branching ratio .    for higgs masses above 130140  gev :",
    "* @xmath22 : backgrounds from drell - yan , @xmath23 , @xmath11 , @xmath18 , @xmath12 , @xmath24 .",
    "the initial signal to background ratio is 1:140 , so many , rather finely tuned , selections are required , culminating in angular cuts to separate the signal from the `` irreducible '' @xmath23 background .    combining all these search channels , and assuming a 10% systematic error on the backgrounds , one finds the sensitivity shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : higgs ] . with 2  fb@xmath0 of data , only a modest extension of the lep reach",
    "is possible . with 15  fb@xmath0 ,",
    "on the other hand , it should be possible to either exclude , or observe at the 35@xmath25 level , a sm higgs up to @xmath26  gev .",
    "this is an exciting prospect .",
    "is it credible ?",
    "in my view , yes : it is an exercise similar in scale to the top discovery , with a similar number of backgrounds , and requiring a similar level of detector understanding",
    ". it will be harder  the irredicible signal to background ratio is worse  but it has caught the imagination of the experimenters .",
    "one problem with the studies so far ( in my opinion ) is the @xmath27 mass resolution .",
    "can the assumed resolution really be attained in a high luminosity environment ?",
    "the resolution not only affects the mass bins over which a higgs signal would be smeared , but a detailed understanding of the shape of the @xmath27 mass spectrum will be needed to separate a putative higgs signal from the nearby mass peak due to @xmath28 decays ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : higgs ] ) . for this reason",
    ", calibration samples of @xmath28 events will be very important .",
    "tens of thousands of events ( after cuts ) are expected for 2  fb@xmath0 , using a displaced vertex trigger , in both cdf and d .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "even the minimal spectrum of supersymmetry ( the sm particles plus two higgs doublets and their superpartners ) can have many faces .",
    "firstly , whether or not @xmath29 parity is conserved determines whether the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) will or will not be stable .",
    "secondly , how supersymmetry is broken determines the mass heirarchy of states and hence their decays .",
    "the typical benchmark , the supergravity - inspired or `` minimal sugra '' model , is determined by five parameters @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 . in this picture ,",
    "radiative electroweak symmetry breaking occurs naturally from the large top mass .",
    "the lightest neutralino is the lsp ; the two lightest neutralinos , the lighest chargino and the lightest higgs @xmath35 are all `` light '' , while the other charginos and neutralinos , squarks , gluinos and the other higgs states are all `` heavy '' ( above a few hundred gev , perhaps ) . in gauge - mediated models , by contrast , the lsp is a gravitino , and there are signatures with photons and/or slow moving particles which may decay within or outside the detector .",
    "recent anomaly - mediated models suggest that the lightest chargino and neutralino may be almost degenerate .    at lep2",
    ", the increased centre of mass energy will allow the present susy limits to be raised by 510  gev ( my guess ) with full use of data at and above 200  gev .",
    "at the tevatron , the highest cross sections are for the pair production of colored particles like squarks and gluinos .",
    "as long as @xmath29-parity is conserved , the signature will be jets plus missing transverse energy ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "the run  i d  analysis@xcite required three jets ( one with @xmath37  gev ) and @xmath38  gev ; it excludes squark masses below about 250  gev and gluino masses below about 200  gev .",
    "this search may be combined with complementary channels where one or more leptons are required , together with jets and @xmath36@xcite . with 2  fb@xmath0 of data",
    "the reach will approximately be doubled , to gluino masses of order 400  gev@xcite .",
    "for masses much larger than this , falling parton distributions kill the production rate very quickly . to extend the reach in parameter space , chargino /",
    "neutralino production will become increasingly important .",
    "present searches in the `` golden '' trilepton mode do not really constrain models , but with 2  fb@xmath0 of data , chargino masses up to 180  gev should be probed ( 150  gev if @xmath33 is large)@xcite .",
    "this places an emphasis on low-@xmath39 lepton triggering , since one or more of the leptons tends to be soft .",
    "it would also help a lot if @xmath40 modes could be included .",
    "in many models , the stop and sbottom squarks are significantly lighter than the others .",
    "it is therefore interesting to search for them separately .",
    "the decay channels involve @xmath41 or @xmath42 jets , and for stop there is also the possibility of @xmath43 decays or vice versa ( depending on the masses ) .",
    "present cdf limits@xcite explore @xmath44  gev and @xmath45  gev ; with 2  fb@xmath0 , the sensitivity should improve to about 200  gev@xcite .",
    "much interest in gauge - mediated supersymmetry was sparked a few years ago by the observation of a single @xmath46 event at cdf@xcite .",
    "this final state is consistent with selectron production in a gauge mediated scenario .",
    "all we can now say is that searches for the expected related signatures have all proved negative : @xmath47 and @xmath48 at the tevatron@xcite , and one or more photons plus missing energy at lep@xcite .",
    "this type of signature is just one example of what may be expected in gauge mediated models .",
    "depending on the details of the model , the next - to - lightest superpartner or nlsp ( which then decays into the gravitino lsp ) may be a neutralino , a stau , or effectively more than one slepton state ( if they are almost degenerate in mass ) .",
    "prompt decays of the nlsp will then give final states containing photons@xmath49 , taus , and multileptons , respectively .",
    "searching for such signatures is relatively straightforward .",
    "a more challenging possibility is that the nlsp has a finite decay length  since this is determined by the susy breaking interactions it is totally unknown . for neutralino nlsp s , decay lengths @xmath50 more than a few metres will give standard @xmath36 signatures since the nlsp will escape the detector .",
    "decay lengths of a few centimetres to a metre result in photons which do not point back to the primary vertex : searches at lep@xcite for such photons have excluded neutralino nlsp masses less than 85  gev , for @xmath51  m. in run  ii at the tevatron , d  will be able to make use of new preshower detectors upstream of the electromagnetic calorimeter to detect non - pointing photons .",
    "the resolution in the distance of closest approach to the vertex will be 2.2  cm along the beamline and 1.4  cm radially@xcite .",
    "charged nlsp s with long decay lengths appear as massive , slow - moving particles which exit the detector ( so called `` cannonballs '' ) .",
    "lep limits exclude stau nlsp masses less than 76  gev , or slepton co - nlsp masses less than 85  gev@xcite . in run  ii at the tevatron , @xmath52 and",
    "timing information will be available ( using time of flight counters in cdf , and the muon system in d ) .",
    "cdf expect sensitivity up to stau masses of 180  gev using the time of flight system@xcite .",
    "short decay lengths @xmath53  cm will give reconstructable impact parameters in the vertex detectors ; 1  cm  @xmath54  m is harder , especially to trigger .",
    "( with enough data , a combination of impact parameter and cannonball searches may be sensitive enough to exclude this intermediate region as well . )",
    "a general problem with understanding delayed decays is that event generators are not widely available , and the interface to the detector simulation is non - trivial .",
    "recently there has been considerable interest in anomaly - mediated susy models .",
    "the phenomenology of such models contains a light chargino which is almost degenerate with the lsp ( a neutralino ) .",
    "such small mass differences may result in delayed chargino decays , with cannonball type signatures , or decays inside the detector @xmath55 : very challenging indeed .",
    "there is also considerable interest in scenarios with large extra dimensions .",
    "gravitons may propagate into the higher dimensional space .",
    "searches have been carried out@xcite for @xmath56nothing , @xmath57nothing , and @xmath58jet@xmath59nothing .",
    "indirect effects have been searched for in @xmath60 .",
    "turning now to susy with @xmath29-parity violating decays , the usual assumption is that the @xmath29 violating couplings are small compared with the @xmath29 conserving ones .",
    "the production processes and subsequent decay chain then proceed as in minimal sugra , but the final lsp s decay via baryon or lepton number violating interactions .",
    "hence there is no @xmath36 from the escaping lsp , but there are usually multi - leptons from cascade decays and @xmath36 from neutrinos . both at lep@xcite and the tevatron@xcite ,",
    "it is found ( perhaps surprisingly ) that the excluded regions end up very comparable to those for msugra with @xmath29 conserved .",
    "@xmath29-violating couplings could also enter in the production of susy particles . at hera",
    ", `` leptoquark '' searches have been interpreted in terms of @xmath61@xcite , while at lep , limits have been placed on processes like @xmath62@xcite .    both at lep2 and the tevatron , we therefore have a basic menu of supersymmetry searches which is well - defined and we should have no trouble in exploring :    * minimal sugra ; * gauge mediated supersymmetry with prompt photon signatures ; * some subset of @xmath29 violation .",
    "our concerns are what we may have forgotten , especially at the tevatron where triggering is a crucial issue .",
    "can we cover :    * slow moving massive particles ; * gauge mediated supersymmetry with detached photons or taus ; * anomaly - mediated supersymmetry ( _ e.g. _ @xmath63 ) ; * general extra dimension signatures , _ etc ? _    a critical look at the proposed trigger lists is probably called for .",
    "at lep2 , two complementary processes allow the neutral higgs states of supersymmetric models to be explored : @xmath64 and @xmath65 . combining these channels and the four experiments , one can exclude ( summer 1999@xcite ) @xmath66  gev and @xmath67  gev .",
    "moreover , @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) is excluded for maximal ( and for minimal ) stop mixing .",
    "the @xmath33 exclusion is very sensitive to the top mass , and it should be noted that there is no excluded range in @xmath33 if @xmath70  gev .",
    "general scans of minimal susy parameter space find some points with strange decay patterns that can evade the limits , but these are rather few .",
    "invisible higgs decays have been included in the searches .    in run  ii of the tevatron",
    ", rather stringent limits will be set on the susy higgs sector , given sufficient luminosity , since the whole allowed mass range for the lightest higgs @xmath35 ( @xmath71  gev ) is covered .",
    "one may also exploit the enhanced couplings between the higgs states and @xmath41 quarks at large @xmath33 to search for @xmath72 . using present data and requiring three @xmath41-tagged jets ,",
    "cdf have been able to explore the region of @xmath73 and above@xcite . with 10",
    "fb@xmath0 the sensitivity will extend to @xmath74 for @xmath75 up to 150  gev .",
    "supersymmetry also predicts the existence of charged higgs states .",
    "searches for pair production at lep have excluded masses @xmath76  gev@xcite . in minimal susy models , it is expected that @xmath77 , and lep is not really sensitive to this region .",
    "searches at the tevatron have concentrated on the production of @xmath78 in top decays@xcite in competition with the standard @xmath79 mode .",
    "this has been carried out both as an `` appearance '' experiment ( looking for @xmath80 ) and as a `` disappearance '' experiment ( looking for fewer than expected @xmath81 ) .",
    "present limits are sensitive only for @xmath82 and @xmath83 , but with 2  fb@xmath0 the sensitivity will extend to @xmath84 and 20 .",
    "there is no fully worked - out scenario for electroweak symmetry breaking through a new strong interaction , but this does not mean that it is not possible .",
    "indeed , many schemes have been outlined in some detail , and a straw - man technicolor model is now implemented in pythia@xcite . in general , dynamical symmetry breaking schemes like technicolor and topcolor predict :    * new particles in the mass range 100  gev  1  tev , * with strong couplings and large cross sections , * decaying to vector bosons and ( preferentially third generation ? ) fermions .",
    "recently l3 has reported searches for technicolor resonances at lep2@xcite , and several technicolor and topcolor searches have been made on present fermilab data .",
    "all are negative so far . with run  ii ,",
    "the reach of the tevatron will be greatly extended .    besides all of the above scenarios , one should always be looking ( at lep , hera and the tevatron ) for anything unexpected :    * leptoquarks * fourth generation fermions , or isosinglet fermions * @xmath85 and @xmath86 * contact interactions or compositeness , _ etc . _",
    "there are plenty of opportunities for us to find `` something new '' before the lhc starts operation .",
    "the standard scenarios have been explored in some detail , but different supersymmetry breaking schemes can produce radically different signatures .",
    "theoretical fashion moves fast , and event generators are not always available . we need to keep an open mind in our searches .",
    "this is easy to say once one has the data in hand ; the challenge right now is to ensure that we do our best to trigger on all possible interesting things , especially in the hadron collider environment .",
