    "in the standard model , nuclear @xmath1 decay is mediated by the exchange of w bosons which have only vector and axial - vector couplings .",
    "however , extensions of the standard model , such as super - symmetric theories with more than one charged higgs doublet , or leptoquarks , naturally predict scalar or tensor weak couplings  @xcite .",
    "a general effective hamiltonian for allowed @xmath1 transitions that respects lorentz invariance is  @xcite @xmath8 where a term proportional to @xmath9 has been neglected because nucleons are non - relativistic . in the standard model , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite computed the nuclear-@xmath1-decay rate from this hamiltonian ; for an unoriented initial state and summation over the lepton helicities @xmath13 where @xmath14 \\label{eq : b}\\\\ { \\rm and } \\nonumber \\\\",

    "we have simplified the expressions by neglecting the small coulomb effects , and adopting the allowed approximation ( ignoring curvature in the lepton wave functions and the recoil - order corrections ) . in what follows",
    "we shall assume @xmath17 and express the scalar couplings in terms of : @xmath18    precise measurements of the @xmath19-@xmath20 correlation coefficient , @xmath21 , and of the fierz - interference term , @xmath22 , can potentially yield information about physics beyond the standard model .",
    "equations 2 - 5 are complicated and depend on nuclear physics information through @xmath15 and @xmath16 . however ,",
    "for pure fermi or pure gt transitions the expressions simplify and the @xmath15 and @xmath16 factors cancel .",
    "in pure fermi transitions , a positron - neutrino correlation coefficient @xmath23 would immediately imply the presence of scalar currents ; while in gt decays a value @xmath24 would imply tensor currents .    to measure the @xmath19-@xmath20 correlation",
    "one must determine the daughter s velocity , because it is out of the question to detect the low - energy neutrino .",
    "but , in general , measuring the daughter s recoil velocity is not a trivial task : the velocities are very small and the interaction of the daughter with the surrounding medium can jeopardize the measurement . fortunately nature has provided us with cases where the daughter states are unbound to proton emission , so that the daughter s velocity can be determined via the ` doppler ' broadening of the beta - delayed proton groups .",
    "protons are preferred over other @xmath1-delayed radiations because they are emitted before the daughter nucleus has slowed appreciably and can be detected with high resolution and good efficiency .",
    "neutrons , on the other hand , are hard to detect with high resolution and high efficiency simultaneously .",
    "gamma rays are generally emitted too slowly to probe the daughter velocity before it has been reduced by interaction with the surrounding medium .",
    "this paper discusses superallowed transitions from proton - rich nuclei with proton - unbound daughter states .",
    "these transitions are strong , which enhances the signal - to - noise ratio , and the widths of daughter states are ideally suited for probing the @xmath19-@xmath20 correlation :    * the time scale for proton decay is short enough so that the decays occur before the daughter looses any appreciable velocity due to interactions with the medium ( in the superallowed decay of @xmath2ar , the daughter travels @xmath25   before the proton is emitted ) . *",
    "because proton decays in these cases violate isospin symmetry the time scale for proton decay is long enough so the widths are much narrower than the lepton - recoil broadening ( in the superallowed decay of @xmath2ar , the daughter state has a width of @xmath26 ev while the lepton - recoil broadening has a full - width at half - maximum of @xmath27 kev ) .",
    "we performed an experiment at isolde that measured with high precision the energies of protons following the @xmath0 @xmath28 decay of @xmath2ar . except for this experiment and a previous isolde study of @xmath2ar by schardt and riisager  @xcite",
    ", there are no other precise determinations of @xmath19-@xmath20 correlations in pure fermi transitions , which explains why , prior to our new result , limits on scalar couplings were rather poor in comparison to those on tensor currents  @xcite . we here describe the salient features of our experiment and the extracted limits on scalar currents .",

    "we solved problem 2 by immersing our detection system in a @xmath31 t magnetic field .",
    "the @xmath2ar beam from isolde was stopped in a @xmath3223 @xmath33g/@xmath34 c foil at 45 degrees to the beam .",
    "our proton detectors were located at @xmath35 degrees with respect to the beam and at about 1.6 cm from the beam spot . in the 3.5 t field superallowed @xmath1 s had a maximum radius of @xmath36 cm , while protons had @xmath37 cm .",
    "we solved problem 3 by using cooled pin - diode proton detectors ( @xmath38 cm ) and temperature - controlled electronics to obtain a proton energy resolution of @xmath39 kev ( @xmath40 kev electronic noise ) .",
