    "the star formation ( sf ) is a fundamental process in the evolution of galaxies and is far from being well understood .",
    "the sf is usually characterized by the initial mass function ( imf ) and the total sf rate ( sfr ) , which depends on many factors such as the density of the interstellar gas , its morphology , its metallicity , _ etc . _ according to larson ( 1986 ) , four major factors drive star formation in galaxies : large scale gravitational instabilities , cloud compression by density waves , compression in a rotating galactic disk due to shear forces , and random cloud collisions . in galaxies with previous stellar generations",
    "additional sf triggers exist , such as shock waves from stellar winds and supernova explosions . in dense environments , such as clusters of galaxies and compact groups , tidal interactions , collisions with other galaxies ,",
    "ism stripping , and cooling flow accretion probably play some role in triggering the sf process .",
    "the triggering mechanisms were reviewed recently by elmegreen ( 1998 ) .    while `` global '' phenomena , such as the first two sf triggers of larson ( 1987 ) , play a large part in grand design spirals , random collisions of interstellar clouds may provide the best explanation for dwarf galaxies with bursts of sf . due to their small size , lack of strong spiral pattern , and sometimes solid - body rotation ( _ e.g. , _",
    "martimbeau 1994 , blok & mcgaugh 1997 ) , the star formation in dwarf galaxies is not triggered by compression due to gravitational density waves or by disk shear .",
    "therefore , understanding sf in dwarf galaxies should be simpler than in other types of galaxies .",
    "the characterization of the sf processes by a star formation rate ( sfr ) controlled by the interstellar gas density as a power law was first introduced by schmidt ( 1959 ) .",
    "the volume density of young stars , @xmath1 , is related to the volume density of hi gas in the galactic disk as @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is a constant , probably @xmath42 for spiral galaxies . in other galaxies",
    "the convention is to express the quantities as projected densities of stars ( @xmath5 ) and of gas , as actually observed : @xmath6 .",
    "this is usually studied by correlating the surface density of a young star tracer , such as the h@xmath0 surface brightness , with the gas column density .",
    "the h@xmath0 emission from a galaxy measures its ongoing sfr ( kennicutt 1983 ) .",
    "gallagher ( 1984 ) derived an analytic relation between the detected h@xmath0 flux and the present sfr of a galaxy ; similar relations were derived by kennicutt ( 1994 ) .",
    "the blue luminosity of a galaxy , on the other hand , measures its past star formation integrated over the last @xmath7 yrs ( gallagher 1984 ) .",
    "the newly formed stars , of which the more massive produce the lyman continuum photons which ionize hydrogen and produce the h@xmath0 emission , contribute also to the blue light output of a galaxy .",
    "this contribution is minor in comparison to that from the stars already existing in a galaxy , unless the sf event is the first in the history of the galaxy or the star burst is unusually strong .",
    "interestingly , tresse & maddox ( 1998 ) found recently that the h@xmath0 luminosity of a galaxy correlates with its blue absolute magnitude .",
    "kennicutt ( 1998 ) found that his parametrization of the schmidt law fitted well the sf pattern of spiral and ir - selected starburst galaxies .",
    "an alternative to the schmidt law , proposed by silk ( 1997 ) , fitted equally well . in this variant ,",
    "the sfr per unit area scales with the ratio of the gas surface density to the local dynamical timescale : @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the angular rotation speed and the scenario fits disk configurations .",
    "kennicutt ( 1998 ) adopted @xmath10 , where v(r ) is the rotation velocity of the gas at a distance r.    hunter ( 1998 ) tested a set of sf predictors on two small samples of dwarf galaxies , one measured by them and another derived from de blok ( 1997 ) .",
    "they found that the ratio of @xmath11 to the critical density for the appearance of ring instabilities did not correlate with the star formation , but that the stellar surface brightness did . from this , they concluded that possibly the stellar energy input provides the feedback mechanism for star formation .",
    "we concentrate on a sample of late - type dwarf galaxies in the virgo cluster ( vc ) .",
    "the reason for selecting dwarfs was to limit the number of possible trigger mechanisms of sf ; these objects are devoid of large - scale sf triggers , as explained above .",
    "having only vc members limits the sample to a well - defined galaxy background ; in addition , all objects are at @xmath12the same distance and have hi information from the same source .",
    "we tested for correlations between the h@xmath0 emission and other observed quantities , in order to investigate mechanisms which regulate sf in dwarf galaxies .",
    "the justification to correlate the h@xmath0 sfr index against @xmath11 is the finding of kennicutt ( 1998 ) that a schmidt - type law seems to fit large galaxies .",
    "if the sfr depends on the gas density ratioed to the dynamical timescale ( silk 1997 , kennicutt 1998 ) , a correlation with @xmath13 is expected .",
    "finally , if the sfr depends on the local population of blue stars , as found by hunter ( 1998 ) , then a dependence on the average blue surface brightness is expected .",
    "we also tested the sfr against the ism gas velocity , represented by the width of the hi line profile at 20% of its peak intensity ( @xmath14(hi ) ) , and against a combination of it and the surface density of hi , in a manner similar to that suggested by silk ( 1997 ) .",
    "our sample consists of 52 late - type dwarf galaxies in the vc selected from binggeli ( 1985 , vcc ) , with hi measurements from hoffman",
    "_ et al . _",
    "( 1987 , 1989 ) .",
    "the sample was constructed in order to enable the detection of weak dependencies of the star formation properties on hydrogen content and surface brightness .",
    "we selected two sub - samples by surface brightness ; one represents a high surface brightness ( hsb ) group and is either bcd or anything+bcd , and another represents a low surface brightness ( lsb ) sample and includes only imiv or imv galaxies .",
    "the morphological classification , which bins the dwarf galaxies in the hsb or lsb groups , is exclusively from the vcc .",
    "in addition , the galaxies are binned by their hi flux integral ( fi ) from hoffman ( 1987 , 1989 ) .",
    "the hsb sub - sample was selected with galaxies of high hi content ( fi@xmath151500 mjy km s@xmath16 ) or with low hi content ( 0@xmath17fi@xmath17600 mjy km s@xmath16 ) and is described in almoznino & brosch ( 1998 , ab98 )",
    ". the lsb sub - sample has fi@xmath151000 for the high hi sample or 0@xmath17fi@xmath17700 mjy km s@xmath16 for the low hi sample ( described in heller 1998 , hab98 ) .",
    "the lsb sub - sample is complete , in the sense that it contains all objects classified imiv or imv in the vcc with m@xmath1817.2 mag .",
    "the hsb sub - sample contains 45% of the vcc galaxies of this type with m@xmath1817.2 .",
    "although not complete , it is representative of this type of object in the vc .",
    "the galaxies were observed at the wise observatory ( wo ) in mizpe - ramon from 1990 to 1997 , with ccd imaging through the b , v , r , and i broad bands , and narrow h@xmath0 bandpasses in the rest frame of each galaxy .",
    "the discussion of all observations and their interpretation is the subject of other papers ( ab98 , hab98 ) .",
    "we restrict the discussion here to the analysis of the integrated h@xmath0 flux f(h@xmath0 ) , as it reflects on the global process of sf .",
    "in particular , we concentrate on correlations of this sfr index with other parameters collected from the literature .",
    "we compare our results with other dwarf galaxies for which we collected published data .",
    "we selected case galaxies from salzer ( 1995 , s95 ) of types hiih , dhiih , bcd , magirr , and girr , as most similar to our vc sample .",
    "we further required that hi observations would exist for the case galaxies , and collected seven such objects . as these galaxies do not have total h@xmath0 fluxes listed , we estimated those from ( a ) the total blue magnitude m@xmath19 , ( b ) the listed equivalent width of the h@xmath20 line , and ( c ) by assuming @xmath21=2.9 ( case b , with no extinction ) .",
    "a second comparison sample of eight galaxies originates from martin ( 1997 ) , where each object has an average h@xmath0 surface brightness measure in the 1 \" wide slit .",
    "fi and @xmath14(hi ) values were collected from huchtmeier & richter ( 1989 ) , while total blue magnitudes and sizes originate from ned .",
    "no corrections for galactic or internal extinction were applied to the data .",
    "we also assumed that the balmer emission observed spectroscopically is representative of the entire galaxy .",
    "we prefer to use here distance - independent measures , which are not sensitive to the exact location of a galaxy in the vc , to the value of h@xmath22 , or to deviations from a smooth hubble flow , and to stick , as much as possible , to directly observable quantities .",
    "the observables f(h@xmath0 ) , fi , and m@xmath19 have , therefore , been normalized to the optical area of each galaxy , yielding `` surface brightness '' measures per square arcmin .",
    "we calculated average blue surface magnitudes @xmath23(b ) , average hi flux integrals per unit surface @xmath23(hi ) , and average h@xmath0 surface brightnesses @xmath23(h@xmath0 ) for all objects .",
    "the optical area of a galaxy is defined here as a=@xmath24 , with d the major axis in arcmin and r the axial ratio listed in vcc or estimated from the image of the object on the digitized sky survey , to yield @xmath23(hi ) .",
    "we used in some correlations @xmath14(hi ) , and derived @xmath25 as a representative gas dynamical property at the outermost optical radius .",
    "this definition of @xmath26 is not purely equivalent to that used by kennicutt ( 1998 ) , but it does not require cosmological assumption in its derivation .",
    "we caution at this point that @xmath23(hi ) may overestimate the surface density of hi in cases where the hydrogen distribution extends beyond the opical area of an object .",
    "cases where the hi distribution was 3@xmath27 and more larger than the optical size of a galaxy were reported by taylor ( 1995 ) . however , while very extended hi distributions do exist , they are not a general characteristic of dwarf galaxies . hoffman ( private communication )",
    "found that only two of the five virgo cluster bcds mapped at arecibo showed evidence for being extended . in most cases ,",
    "the arecibo beam will cover more than 3@xmath27 the optical size of one of our objects , implying that not much hi could have been missed in the measurements we use here . in absence of synthesis or multi - beam mapping of the hi distributions",
    ", we selected to use the coarse measure of @xmath23(hi ) as defined here , with all caveats mentioned .",
    "the wo sample ranges over more than two orders of magnitude in @xmath23(hi ) , over more than three orders of magnitude in @xmath23(h@xmath0 ) , and over slightly less that two orders of magnitude in @xmath23(b ) .",
    "the comparison sample from salzer ( 1995 ) is more restricted in the range of h@xmath0 , while the galaxies from martin ( 1997 ) have more intense h@xmath0 than the wo objects .",
    "in general , galaxies from salzer are @xmath28 more distant than the vc sample , while objects from martin are @xmath29 closer than the vc .",
    "we checked first correlations between global parameters of our dwarf galaxy sample , such as total blue brightness , total hi content , _ etc .",
    "_ in all correlations we considered only detected quantities ( no upper limits were included ) .",
    "we did not find that m@xmath19 and the hi fis were correlated in any of the subsamples ( for the entire wo sample the correlation coefficient was 0.57 , f=17.4 ) .",
    "this scatterplot is shown in the top left panel of figure 1 .",
    "note that some degree of correlation would be expected only from the distance effect , with both m@xmath19 and fi being lower for more distant objects .",
    "the plot of @xmath23(b ) vs. @xmath23(hi ) , shown in the top right panel of fig .",
    "1 , indicates that galaxies with more hi per unit area tend also to have higher blue surface brightness , _",
    "i.e. , _ a higher past - averaged sfr , but this correlation was not very significant .",
    "we found that log@xmath23(h@xmath0 ) correlates with the hi line width ( correlation coefficient 0.61 , f=21.3 ) and show this in the left middle panel of fig .",
    "1 . dwarf galaxies with brighter blue surface brightness tend also to have wider hi profiles ( correlation coefficient 0.51 , f=13.6 ) , as the right middle panel of fig .",
    "@xmath23(hi ) correlates also weakly with @xmath14(hi ) .",
    "this is illustrated in the lower left panel of fig .",
    "kennicutt ( 1998 ) showed that in a sample of large spirals and starburst galaxies the average h@xmath0 disk surface brightness correlates well with the average molecular and atomic gas surface density .",
    "dwarf galaxies have very small quantities of molecular gas ( _ e.g. ,",
    "_ gondhalekar 1998 ) , therefore using here @xmath30 should represent well the total ism .",
    "this correlation , shown in the lower right panel of fig .",
    "1 , was also weak , and the combined wo sample had a correlation coefficient of only 0.52 ( f=13.1 )    a better correlation was found for @xmath23(h@xmath0 ) _ vs. _ the `` silk''-type parameter @xmath23(hi)@xmath26 .",
    "figure 2 shows this for the two vc samples ( hsb = filled diamonds , lsb = squares ) , as well as for the comparison samples from salzer ( 1995 ; triangles ) and martin ( 1997 ; filled circles ) .",
    "note that the two vc samples join up nicely , with the hsb galaxies being brighter and more h@xmath0-intense than the lsb objects .",
    "the correlation coefficient for the combined wo sample is 0.70 ( f=34.2 ) and the slope is 0.93@xmath310.16 .",
    "the log@xmath23(h@xmath0 ) correlates even better with the blue surface magnitude , as figure 3 shows .",
    "for the combined wo sample the correlation coefficient is 0.77 and the slope is 0.63@xmath310.09 ( f=51.2 ) .",
    "the salzer ( 1995 ) and the martin ( 1997 ) galaxies deviate in both plots from the trend set by the vc sample",
    ". some of the discrepancy may be the result of our samples being measured in a uniform and consistent manner , whereas the plotted parameters for the comparison samples were calculated from published data and some assumptions ( explained above ) .",
    "the martin galaxies appear consistently above the location of the wo galaxies ; it is probable that their total h@xmath0 flux was over - estimated by assuming that the slit average is representative of the entire galaxy .",
    "this is confirmed for the three objects in common with marlowe ( 1997 ) , which have consistently lower total h@xmath0 fluxes than adopted by us here . the salzer ( 1995 ) objects are generally below the wo objects .",
    "they have significant extinction ( @xmath32 ) , which translates into an under - estimate of the h@xmath0 emission when scaling from the h@xmath20 flux .",
    "in addition , the h@xmath20 fluxes were not corrected for underlying absorption ; this also causes an h@xmath0 under - estimate .",
    "other reasons for discrepancies may be the different distances to the two comparison samples , which influence @xmath26 we use here through the angular diameter of a galaxy , used in the present derivation .",
    "we mentioned above a number of triggers of star formation . some , such as shear and two - fluid instabilities , or spiral density waves , are important mainly in large disk galaxies and thus are not relevant for dwarfs .",
    "the sample studied here is comprised of fairly isolated galaxies , although this was not a selection criterion .",
    "the galaxies are distant enough from other objects to discount recent ( few 10@xmath33 yrs ) interactions as possible star formation triggers . in these",
    "dwarfs the expectation is that the sf may be regulated only by the gas density , or by the gas density combined with some factor connected with the stellar content of the galaxy .",
    "we checked here various correlations of the star formation indicator @xmath23(h@xmath0 ) with global or specific ( per unit area ) galaxy parameters .",
    "the `` expected '' correlations , observed by kennicutt ( 1998 ) to fit well spiral galaxies , were found to be much weaker in dwarfs .",
    "the strongest correlation was with @xmath23(b ) , while the local ism dynamic indicator @xmath23(hi)@xmath26 showed the second strongest correlation .",
    "the correlation found for the cfrs survey galaxies ( @xmath17z@xmath340.2 , tresse & maddox 1998 ) , between the global m@xmath19 and log l(h@xmath0 ) , can be understood if that survey selected preferentially galaxies of similar sizes in blue and in hydrogen emission , reducing the problem to a correlation between area - normalized quantities .",
    "these galaxies are much brighter ( m@xmath3521 mag ) than the dwarfs discussed here and , being selected on the basis of their i - band emission , are probably not representative of the `` star - forming dwarfs '' class .",
    "our findings support a scenario whereby the star formation is not controlled by the gas volume density , by its surface density , or by the ratio of the gas surface density to a local dynamical timescale .",
    "the strongest correlation , based on the correlation coefficient and the value of the f - statistic , was with the average blue surface magnitude , as found also by hunter ( 1998 ) .",
    "there the question was posed whether this was an effect of the sfr being @xmath12constant over the last @xmath121 gyr .",
    "we can definitely rule out this possibility , as at least one of our objects ( vcc 144 ; brosch 1998 ) seems to exhibit its first sf burst .",
    "many other galaxies , mainly from the lsb sample , show a number of small hii regions indicating localized star formation at present .",
    "the colors ( ab98 ) are best fitted by ( at least ) two stellar populations formed in short bursts , spaced a few 100 mys to 1 gyr apart .",
    "this indicates that a constant sf is not a serious possibility for the dwarf galaxies studied here .",
    "we tested correlations among parameters related to star formation , gas and stellar content , and internal dynamics on a sample of dwarf galaxies in the virgo cluster .",
    "we found that both the schmidt law and the more recent relation derived by silk ( 1997 ) do not fit these galaxies as well as they do spirals ( kennicutt 1998 ) .",
    "the strongest correlation of the h@xmath0 surface brightness , which measures the present star formation strength , was with the average blue surface brightness , supporting the proposition of hunter ( 1998 ) that a feedback mechanism must be at work to regulate the present sf by the older stellar population .",
