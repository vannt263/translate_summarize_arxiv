    "the density dependent sigma meson mass was also calculated including the quantum effects .",
    "it is believed that the formation of hyperons is a dominant mechanism at high densities and temperatures , which contributes to the neutron star matter and influences the equation of state ( eos ) @xcite .",

    "there have also been attempts to include the contribution of the filled negative sea of hyperons to the energy of nuclear matter at one - loop level through summing over the baryonic tadpole diagrams .",
    "this is the relativistic hartree approximation ( rha ) .",
    "the contribution arising from two - loop diagrams has also been considered @xcite , which showed a strong degree of cancellation between one- and two - loop contributions giving a negligible effect . however , this conclusion was strongly dependent on the rather uncertain values of the hyperon coupling constants .    in the present work , the nonperturbative formalism described in ref .",

    "this a reflection of a smaller coupling of hyperons to the sigma field .",
    "further , we note that the decrease in the effective mass , @xmath173 with density , is slower when quantum corrections from the sigma mesons through condensates are taken into account . the value of @xmath173 increases with @xmath131 which is a reflection of diminishing baryon sigma coupling strength for larger value of quartic self - interaction .    the meson field strengths are plotted in fig .",
    "the potentials can be obtained by multiplying the corresponding meson couplings to the baryons .",
    "the vector potential initially rises linearly and then the rise is slowed down for densities @xmath174 , when the hyperons start to appear @xcite .",
    "the magnitude as well as the rate of rise is decreased with inclusion of quantum corrections from the @xmath0 mesons .",
    "such a decrease is also observed for the scalar potential , which leads to a smaller value for the anti - baryon potential , @xmath175 , due to the @xmath0 meson quantum correction effects .",
    "the scalar field tends to saturate at high densities .",
    "the magnitude of isovector vector field , @xmath16 remains small ( reaching a maximum of @xmath176 15 - 20 mev ) throughout the density regime .",
    "inclusion of quantum corrections from the sigma meson leads to a self - consistent calculation of the in - medium sigma mass , given by equation ( [ mm2 ] ) which we plot in figure 4 .",
    "there is an increase in the scalar meson mass with density , since the quartic coupling @xmath131 is positive .",
    "the increase is sharper for higher value of the quartic coupling @xcite .    in figures 5 , 6 and 7 , the fractional particle densities ,",

    ", the lightest hyperon appears in all these situations .",
    "it is noticed that for little higher value for the density , the negatively charged hyperon @xmath179 appears , which competes with the leptons in maintaining charge neutrality .",
    "because of the larger coupling to the vector meson as compared to that of @xmath180-hyperon , the effective chemical potential for @xmath179 becomes large enough to have the threshold for occurrence of @xmath179 earlier than @xmath181 .",
    "we might note here that , this is in line with the extrapolated @xmath181 atomic data @xcite , which suggest that @xmath179 may feel repulsion at high density , which would mitigate against its appearance in dense matter @xcite , although this remains inconclusive .",
    "the appearance of @xmath179 leads to a depletion of the lepton concentrations consistent with charge neutrality condition .",
    "such a depletion is also seen , for example in the magnitude of the electron chemical potential , @xmath182 , plotted in figure 8 .",
    "the @xmath179-hyperon becomes more populous than @xmath2 almost immediately after it starts appearing .",
    "the proton concentration increases and saturates at higher densities , and the appearance of @xmath183 maintains charge neutrality condition .",
    "we might note here that the threshold condition for a given species to appear , is given by the equation ( [ thresh ] ) .",

    ", the threshold density for @xmath183 is smaller than @xmath184 and @xmath181 .",
    "this is due to the fact that first of all @xmath183 has a lower mass and its coupling to the iso - vector vector , @xmath5- meson decided by isospin leads to a higher effective chemical potential , compared to @xmath184 or @xmath181 .",
    "we also notice that after an initial rise of @xmath183 partial density , it starts decreasing at a higher density when @xmath179 saturates , to maintain charge neutrality as electron density keeps decreasing in this density regime .",
    "inclusion of quantum effects from scalar meson shifts the threshold densities for the hyperons to higher values .",
    "this is due to the fact that such quantum corrections lead to a higher effective mass as illustrated in fig . 2 , and hence the threshold condition ( [ thresh ] )",
    "is met at a higher density .    in figure 9 , we plot the mass of the neutron star as a function of the central energy densities for the situations of with and without the quantum correction effects from scalar mesons . for subnuclear densities",
    ", we use the results of negele and vautherin @xcite for the energy density regime 0.025 mev/@xmath185 50 mev/@xmath171 , the eos of baym , pethick and sutherland @xcite for 5@xmath186 10@xmath187 mev/@xmath188 0.025 mev/@xmath171 , and the eos of feynman _ et al _ @xcite below 10@xmath187 mev/@xmath171 .",
    "the value of the maximum mass of the neutron star in solar mass units is found to be 1.717 , 1.6 and 1.42 for rha , @xmath131 = 1.8 and 5 respectively , along with the corresponding radii as 12.0 , 11.62 and 11.1 kilometers .",
    "thus it is seen that inclusion of quantum effects reduces the maximum mass of stable neutron stars , which reflects the fact that the eos becomes softer due to quantum effects , as illustrated in figure 1 .",
    "such a decrease of maximum mass for the neutron star due to quantum effects was also seen in ref .",
    "@xcite . in fig .",
    "10 , the radius of the neutron star versus its mass is plotted for the different situations .",
    "the quantum effects are seen to reduce the radius of the maximum mass of the neutron star .",
    "to summarize , in the present work , we have derived the eos of charge neutral hyperonic matter including the quantum effects in a nonperturbative manner .",
    "the method consists of having an explicit ansatz for the ground state of dense matter with baryon - antibaryon condensates as well as scalar meson condensates .",
    "extremisation of the thermodynamic potential leads to determination of the condensate functions in a self consistent manner .",
    "this gave rise to a softer eos .",

    "the composition of the charge neutral dense matter is known to be rather sensitive to the hyperon meson coupling parameters , which involve large uncertainties . in particular",
    ", the uncertainty of the coupling of @xmath181 in dense matter raises the question of the behaviour of the electrochemical potential in the neutron star matter , which is crucial in the possible presence of the kaon condensed phase in the core of the neutron stars@xcite . with inclusion of quantum effects from @xmath0 meson ,",
    "one notices that the threshold densities for the onset of appearance of the hyperons increase , due to the larger values of the respective effective masses .",
    "we have also considered the neutron star structural properties using such an equation of state , which leads to a smaller value for the maximum mass as compared to when quantum effects from scalar mesons are not taken into account .",
    "the approximation here lies in the specific ansatz for the ground state structure .",
    "however , it would be interesting to investigate with a more general ground state including @xmath1 and @xmath5 mesons than what has been considered here .",
