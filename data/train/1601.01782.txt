    "<S> classical logic is embedded into constructive logic , through a definition of the classical connectives and quantifiers in terms of the constructive ones .    </S>",
    "<S> the history of the notion of constructivity started with a dispute on the deduction rules that one should or should not use to prove a theorem . depending on the rules accepted by the ones and the others , the proposition @xmath0 , for instance , had a proof or not .    </S>",
    "<S> a less controversial situation was reached with a classification of proofs , and it became possible to agree that this proposition had a classical proof but no constructive proof .    </S>",
    "<S> an alternative is to use the idea of hilbert and poincar that axioms and deduction rules define the meaning of the symbols of the language and it is then possible to explain that some judge the proposition @xmath0 true and others do not because they do not assign the same meaning to the symbols @xmath1 , @xmath2 , etc . the need </S>",
    "<S> to distinguish several meanings of a common word is usual in mathematics . </S>",
    "<S> for instance the proposition `` there exists a number @xmath3 such that @xmath4 '' is true of false depending on whether the word `` number '' means `` natural number '' or `` real number '' . even for logical connectives , </S>",
    "<S> the word `` or '' has to be disambiguated into inclusive and exclusive .    </S>",
    "<S> taking this idea seriously , we should not say that the proposition @xmath5 has a classical proof but no constructive proof , but we should say that the proposition @xmath6 has a proof and the proposition @xmath0 does not , that is we should introduce two symbols for each connective and quantifier , for instance a symbol @xmath1 for the constructive disjunction and a symbol @xmath7 for the classical one , instead of introducing two judgments : `` has a classical proof '' and `` has a constructive proof '' . </S>",
    "<S> we should also be able to address the question of the provability of mixed propositions and , for instance , express that the proposition @xmath8 has a proof .    </S>",
    "<S> the idea that the meaning of connectives and quantifiers is expressed by the deduction rules leads to propose a logic containing all the constructive and classical connectives and quantifiers and deduction rules such that a proposition containing only constructive connectives and quantifiers has a proof in this logic if and only if it has a proof in constructive logic and a proposition containing only classical connectives and quantifiers has a proof in this logic if and only if it has a proof in classical logic . </S>",
    "<S> such a logic containing classical , constructive , and also linear , connectives and quantifiers has been proposed by j .- y . </S>",
    "<S> girard @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this logic is a sequent calculus with _ unified sequents _ that contain a linear zone and a classical zone and rules treating differently propositions depending on the zone they belong .    </S>",
    "<S> our goal in this paper is slightly different , as we want to define the meaning of a small set of primitive connectives and quantifiers with deduction rules and define the others explicitly , in the same way the exclusive or is explicitly defined in terms of conjunction , disjunction and negation : @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> a first step in this direction has been made by gdel @xcite who defined a translation of constructive logic into classical logic , and kolmogorov @xcite , gdel @xcite , and gentzen @xcite who defined a translation of classical logic into constructive logic . </S>",
    "<S> as the first translation requires a modal operator , we shall focus on the second . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to consider constructive connectives and quantifiers as primitive and search for definitions of the classical ones . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we want to define classical connectives and quantifiers @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath7 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 and embed classical propositions into constructive logic with a function @xmath17 defined as follows .       </S>",
    "<S> * @xmath18 if @xmath19 is an atomic proposition * @xmath20 * @xmath21 * @xmath22 * @xmath23 * @xmath24 * @xmath25 * @xmath26 * @xmath27    if @xmath28 is a multiset of propositions , we write @xmath29 for the multiset @xmath30 .    kolmogorov - gdel - gentzen translation can be defined as follows    * @xmath31 , if @xmath19 is an atomic proposition * @xmath32 * @xmath33 * @xmath34 * @xmath35 * @xmath36 * @xmath37 * @xmath38 * @xmath39    or more succinctly as    * @xmath31 , if @xmath19 is an atomic proposition * @xmath40 , if @xmath41 is a zero - ary connective * @xmath42 , if @xmath41 is a unary connective * @xmath43 , if @xmath41 is a binary connective * @xmath44 , if @xmath41 is a quantifier    for instance @xmath45 and it is routine to prove that a proposition @xmath46 has a classical proof if and only if the proposition @xmath47 has a constructive one .    </S>",
    "<S> but , this translation does not exactly provide a definition of the classical connectives and quantifiers in terms of the constructive ones , because an atomic proposition is @xmath19 is translated as @xmath48 , while in a translation induced by a definition of the classical connective and quantifiers , an atomic proposition @xmath19 must be translated as @xmath19 .    </S>",
    "<S> thus , to view kolmogorov - gdel - gentzen translation as a definition , we would need to also introduce a proposition symbol @xmath49 defined by @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> but this would lead us too far : we want to introduce constructive and classical versions of the logical symbols  the connectives and the quantifiers  but not of the non logical ones , such as the predicate symbols .    </S>",
    "<S> if we take the definition    * @xmath51 * @xmath52 * etc .    where a double negation is put before each connective and quantifier </S>",
    "<S> , then the proposition @xmath6 is @xmath53 where , compared to the kolmogorov - gdel - gentzen translation , the double negations in front of atomic propositions are missing . another translation introduced by l. allali and </S>",
    "<S> o. hermant @xcite leads to the definition    * @xmath51 * @xmath54 * etc .    where double negations are put after , and not before , each connective and quantifier . </S>",
    "<S> the proposition @xmath6 is then @xmath55 , where the double negation at the top of the proposition is missing . using </S>",
    "<S> this translation allali and hermant prove that the proposition @xmath46 has a classical proof if and only if the proposition @xmath56 has a constructive one and they introduce another provability judgment expressing that the proposition @xmath57 has a constructive proof . </S>",
    "<S> this also would lead us too far : in our logic , we want a single judgment `` @xmath46 has a proof '' expressing that @xmath46 has a constructive proof , and not to introduce a second judgment , whether it be `` @xmath46 has a classical proof '' or `` @xmath57 has a proof '' .    in order to do so , we define the classical connectives and quantifiers by introducing double negations both before and after each symbol .       * @xmath58 * @xmath59 * @xmath60 * @xmath61 * @xmath62 * @xmath63 * @xmath64 * @xmath65    notice that the propositions @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 where @xmath69 is defined as @xmath70 , have proofs . thus , the symbols @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 could be just defined as @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath2 .    with this definition , neither the double negations in front of atomic propositions nor those at the top of the proposition are missing . </S>",
    "<S> the price to pay is to have four negations instead of two in many places , but this is not harmful .    yet </S>",
    "<S> , there is still a problem with the translation of atomic propositions : as with any definition based translation , the atomic proposition @xmath19 alone is translated as @xmath19 and not as @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the property that a sequent @xmath74 has a classical proof if and only if the sequent @xmath75 has a constructive one only holds when @xmath46 is not atomic . for instance , the sequent @xmath76 , that is @xmath77 , does not have a constructive proof .    </S>",
    "<S> a solution to this problem is to decompose hypothetical provability into absolute provability and entailment . for absolute provability , the property that a sequent @xmath78 has a classical proof if and only if the sequent @xmath79 has a constructive one holds for all propositions , because atomic propositions have no proof . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the sequent @xmath80 has a classical proof if and only if the sequent @xmath81 has a constructive one . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a system where we have only one notion of absolute provability , but two notions of entailment : `` @xmath46 has a proof from the hypothesis @xmath82 '' can either be understood as `` @xmath83 has a proof '' or `` @xmath84 has a proof '' .    </S>",
    "<S> classical provability is defined by the cut free sequent calculus rules of figure [ classical ] . </S>",
    "<S> we say that the proposition @xmath46 has a classical proof if the sequent @xmath78 does .    </S>",
    "<S> constructive provability , our main notion of provability , is obtained by restricting to sequents with at most one conclusion . </S>",
    "<S> this requires a slight adaptation of the @xmath85-l rule @xmath86 we say that the proposition @xmath46 has a constructive proof if the sequent @xmath78 does .    [ direct ] if the proposition @xmath87 has a constructive proof , then the proposition @xmath46 has a classical one .    _ </S>",
    "<S> proof . </S>",
    "<S> _ if the proposition @xmath87 has a constructive proof , then @xmath87 also has a classical proof . </S>",
    "<S> hence , @xmath87 being classically equivalent to @xmath46 , @xmath46 also has a classical proof .    </S>",
    "<S> we now want to prove the converse : that if the proposition @xmath46 has a classical proof , then @xmath87 has a constructive proof . </S>",
    "<S> to do so , we first introduce another translation where the top double negation is removed , when there is one .       </S>",

[ notnot ] if the proposition @xmath46 is atomic , then @xmath101 , otherwise @xmath102 .    </S>",

    "<S> _ proof . </S>",
    "<S> _ by proposition [ notnot ] , either @xmath101 , or @xmath102 . in the first case </S>",
    "<S> the result is obvious , in the second , we build a proof of @xmath104 with a @xmath2-l rule , a a @xmath2-r rule , and the proof of @xmath103 .    </S>",
