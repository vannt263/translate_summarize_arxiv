    "about 50 accretion powered x - ray pulsars are known .",
    "although most of them are in binary systems , binary orbital parameters are known for only half of them ( bildsten et al .",
    "the optically identified companions are generally high mass stars ( van paradijs 1995 ) . among the high mass companions half of them are giant or supergiant stars and the other half are oe and be stars with episodic mass loss events .",
    "the x - ray source sax j2103.5 + 4545 was discovered using the bepposax x - ray satellite ( hulleman , int zand , and heise 1998 ) .",
    "pulsations at 358.61 s were found .",
    "the x - ray spectrum was a power law with photon number index of 1.27 , typical of accreting high  field pulsars .",
    "in analogy to other x - ray pulsars this object was proposed to be a neutron star in a binary .",
    "it was noted that the b8 star hd 200709 was at the edge of the bepposax error box .    in this work",
    ", we report on x - ray observations made with the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) during an outburst two years later .",
    "we determine the orbital parameters using pulse arrival time analysis ( see also baykal , stark , and swank 2000 ) .",
    "sax j2103.5 + 4545 was observed during 1999 november 19 and december 27 for an rxte guest observer proposal to study the decays of transient pulsars .",
    "the results presented here are based on data collected with the proportional counter array ( pca ) ( jahoda et al .",
    "1996 ) and all sky monitor ( asm ) ( levine et al . 1996 ) .",
    "the pca instrument consists of five identical multi - anode proportional counter units ( pcus ) .",
    "the pca operates in the 2 - 60 kev energy range , with a total effective area of approximately 7000 @xmath6 and a field of view @xmath7 fwhm .",
    "the asm consists of three identical scanning shadow cameras ( sscs ) each of which has a net active area for detecting x - rays of @xmath830 @xmath6 .",
    "the asm sensitive range is 2 to 12 kev .",
    "it perform sets of 90 sec pointed observations , covering @xmath980@xmath10 of the sky every @xmath9 90 minutes .",
    "background light curves were generated by using the background estimator models based upon the rate of very large events , spacecraft activation , and cosmic x - ray emission with the standard pca analysis tools .",
    "the background light curves were subtracted from the source light curves which were obtained from the good xenon event data .",
    "the background subtracted light curve is presented in figure 1 .",
    "the observation times were corrected with respect to the barycenter of the solar system . then summed power spectra",
    "were used to estimate the average pulse frequency .",
    "pulse profiles were obtained by folding the lightcurves at the pulse period deduced from the power spectra .",
    "a template pulse profile is presented in figure 2 .",
    "pulse arrival times were found by cross - correlating the pulse profiles . in the pulse timing analysis , we have used the harmonic representation of pulse profiles ( deeter @xmath11 boynton 1985 ) .",
    "the pulse profiles were expressed in terms of harmonic series and cross - correlated with the template pulse profile .",
    "figure 3 , presents the pulse arrival times .",
    "the pulse arrival times showed a quadratic trend superposed on orbital doppler delays .",
    "the pulse arrival times can be written as ( deeter , boynton , @xmath11 pravdo 1981 )    @xmath12    here t@xmath13 is the mid - time of the observation ; @xmath14 is the deviation from mean pulse period @xmath15 ; @xmath16 is the time derivative of the pulse period ; @xmath17 is the light traveltime for projected semimajor axis ( where i is the inclination angle between the line of sight and the orbital angular momentum vector ) ; @xmath18 is the mean orbital longitude at time @xmath19 ; @xmath20 is the epoch when the mean orbital longitude is equal to 90 @xmath21 ; @xmath22 is the orbital period ; @xmath23 is the eccentricity ; and @xmath24 is the longitude of periastron .",
    "the above expression is fitted to the pulse arrival times data .",
    "table 1 presents the timing solution of sax j2103.5 + 4545 .",
    "figure 4 presents the pulse arrival times after the removal of the quadratic trend ( or intrinsic -@xmath16 ) .",
    "the source was spinning up during the observation at the rate of @xmath25 hz s@xmath5 .",
    "the periodic trend of the pulse arrival times yields an eccentric orbit ( e=@xmath0 ) with a orbital period of @xmath1 days .",
    "the pca lightcurve is folded at the orbital period of 12.68 days with respect to the reference time of mean longitude 90@xmath21 .",
    "the folded pca lightcurve is presented in figure 5 . in this figure",
    ", orbital phase @xmath80.4 corresponds to the periastron passage of the neutron star .",
    "it is clearly seen that the x - ray flux ( or count rate ) is increased at the periastron passage of the x - ray pulsar .",
    "this is strongly suggesting that the mass accretion rate onto the neutron star is increased during the periastron passage .    since sax j2103.5 + 4545 was observed with the bepposax satellite from february to september 1997 ( hulleman , int zand and heise 1998 ) we extracted the public asm data and presented 3 days average of asm light curve in figure 6 .",
    "the x - ray pulsar was actively seen in asm in 1997 for @xmath9 200 days . in order to see the x - ray flux modulations due to the eccentric orbit",
    ", we employed a @xmath26 search .",
    "the result is shown in figure 7 ; there is obvious peak centered at 12.6 days .",
    "the asm data folded on the orbital period is shown in figure 8 .",
    "the folded asm light curve also shows an increase in x - ray flux at the periastron passage .",
    "the asm and pca lightcurves are quite similar .",
    "the derived orbital parameters yield a mass function for the companion @xmath27 for an x - ray pulsar mass of ( @xmath91.4m@xmath28 ) and an inclination of 45@xmath21 , the companion mass would be @xmath87@xmath29 .",
    "high mass x - ray binaries fall into three separate groups when the pulse periods are compared with the orbital periods ( corbet 1986 ) . the systems with be companions show correlations between orbital period and spin periods ( corbet 1986 , van kerkwijk 1989 ) , while systems with giant and supergiant companions fall into two separate regions .",
    "x - ray pulsars with be type companions show transient behavior and these pulsars generally accrete from the variable envelope of a be star . the mass accretion increases at the periastron passages since the density of plasma is greater when the pulsar is close to the companion star .",
    "if sax j2103.5 + 4545 has a be type companion , according to the corbet diagram , a pulse period of @xmath9 358 s implies an orbital period of @xmath9190 d ( hulleman , int zand and heise 1998 ) .",
    "the measured orbital period and pulse period of sax j2103.5 + 4545 suggests that the companion star has to be a giant or a supergiant star ( corbet 1986 ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that even if this pulsar has a supergiant companion it is still a transient x - ray pulsar .",
    "hullemann , int zand , & heise ( 1998 ) attempted to use the theoretical relation between @xmath16 and x - ray luminosity to test the consistency of possible locations of the source , but their upper limits on @xmath16 were not restrictive . according to ghosh & lamb ( 1979 ) the maximum spin - up rate ( @xmath30 ) is given by      where @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 are the magnetic dipole moment in units of @xmath36 g @xmath37 , the mass in units of solar mass ( @xmath38 ) , the radius in units of 10@xmath39 cm and the moment of inertia in units of 10@xmath40 g @xmath6 , respectively , and @xmath41 represents the x - ray luminosity in units of @xmath42 erg s@xmath5 .",
    "the spin - up rate we observed ( @xmath43 s s@xmath5 ) implies an accretion luminosity of @xmath44 erg s@xmath5 for a typical surface magnetic field strenght of @xmath45 gauss .",
    "the average flux seen by the asm during the period of our pca measurements was only 5 mcrab and the pca average spectrum implied a total unabsorbed flux of @xmath46 ergs @xmath47 s@xmath5 .",
    "a distance can be estimated from this flux and the x - ray luminosity estimate given above ; the result is d = @xmath48 kpc .",
    "is about 5 kpc .",
    "the b star hd 200709 was suggested as a marginal candidate of optical counterpart at a distance of @xmath49 kpc ( hulleman , int zand and heise 1998 ) .",
    "our finding suggests that sax j2103.5 + 4545 is far beyond the star hd 200709 and that deeper searches are required for detection of an optical counterpart .",
