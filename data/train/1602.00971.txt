    "srruo@xmath0 is a metallic ferromagnetic perovskite - type ruthenate highly valued for its beneficial electrical and magnetic properties , thermal and chemical stability , atomically smooth surface , and a good lattice match with a wide variety of functional oxides [ ] . in recent years , srruo@xmath1 has become the most popular epitaxial electrode for complex oxide heterostructures and has been utilized in ferroelectrics , schottky junctions , magnetocalorics , and magnetoelectrics [ ] .",
    "moreover , it has attracted the attention of superconductor and spintronics communities [ ] . reflecting this broad interest , more",
    "than 1000 papers involving the physics , materials science , and applications of srruo@xmath1 have been published over the last two decades [ ] . but despite all that has been learned , there remain some issues that have not been fully addressed yet .    at ambient conditions ,",
    "bulk srruo@xmath0 crystallizes in an orthorhombic ( @xmath2 ) structure and upon heating undergoes phase transitions to tetragonal ( @xmath3 at 820 k ) and then to cubic ( @xmath4 at 950 k ) systems [ ] .",
    "although one can find several previous theoretical studies [ ] in which the ground - state orthorhombic structure is reproduced by density functional theory ( dft ) calculations within the local density approximation ( lda ) , generalized - gradient approximation ( gga ) , hybrid functional , and even @xmath5 or @xmath6 frameworks , a more detailed and systematic analysis of the obtained results in most cases is missing .",
    "this now seems like an obvious gap of knowledge , since the importance of geometry optimization has recently grown to a new level due to the experimental breakthrough in stabilizing tetragonal and/or monoclinic phases of srruo@xmath0 at room temperature by applying external pressure [ ] , introducing oxygen vacancies [ , ] , and employing compressive and/or tensile strains induced by different substrates [ ] . as it was noticed by herklotz @xmath7 @xmath8 .",
    "[ ] , an ongoing debate on the exact space group symmetry of the strained srruo@xmath0 films paves the way for the first - principles calculations which can lend a helping hand to the researchers in the laboratory .",
    "for example , in the work of vailionis @xmath7 @xmath8 .",
    "[ ] the authors state that a tensile strained srruo@xmath0 thin film most likely possesses a @xmath9 rather than @xmath10 space group symmetry , but the subtle differences between these two phases are too small to be detected experimentally . from a theoretical standpoint ,",
    "this issue could be more or less painlessly resolved by carefully performing geometry optimization at the dft level .",
    "what is more , geometry optimization also plays a significant role in theoretical modelling the electronic structure of srruo@xmath0 films grown on srtio@xmath0 substrates at the ultrathin limit [ ] .",
    "however , in order to effectively employ dft approaches for the strained systems , initially one should get acquainted with their side - by - side performance comparison produced for the ground - state configuration .    in this study , we have systematically investigated the @xmath2 crystalline structure of srruo@xmath0 and compared obtained results with the low - temperature experimental data . from a theoretical point of view",
    ", we have comprised three rungs of the jacob s ladder of dft approximations [ ]  the first , second , and fourth  by applying lda , ggas , and hybrid functionals that are widely used for the solid - state calculations .",
    "the third rung of the ladder assigned for the meta - ggas , which in turn consider kinetic - energy density as an additional variable , was not taken into account , since promising meta - ggas for solids , like revtpss [ ] , are still not implemented in many of the popular dft codes .",
    "we have distinguished structural parameters into three categories , namely , ( a ) lattice constants and volume , ( b ) tilting and rotation angles , and ( c ) internal angles and bond distances within ruo@xmath11 octahedra .",
    "on one hand , it is well known that lattice constants and volume are critically important for many inherent material properties  including phonon frequencies , elastic constants , ferromagnetism , and the possibility of structural phase transitions [ , ]  and therefore deserve an exceptional attention . on the other hand",
    ", it has been shown that octahedral rotations and tilts in the strained srruo@xmath0 thin films are a key factor for determining their functionalities and possible applications [ , , , ] .",
    "experimental recognition of epitaxially stabilized tetragonal structures with no octahedral rotations , but with octahedral deformations introduced instead [ , ] encourages to focus on the internal parameters of octahedra . as the electrical and magnetic properties of these thin films were discovered to exhibit a close relationship with the strain - induced octahedral deformations , we also found it important to check the performance of dft approaches in reproducing the ground - state geometry of ruo@xmath11 .",
    "for the sake of completeness , we have additionally presented the electronic structure and magnetic moment of srruo@xmath0 which allow us to demonstrate the versatility of the tested functionals in the context of physical features .",
    "in the lda framework [ ] , the exchange energy @xmath12 $ ] has the form @xmath13=\\int n\\varepsilon_{\\text{x}}^{\\text{lda}}(n)d^{3}r , \\label{eq : equ1}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 denotes the electron density and @xmath15 is the exchange energy density per particle for a uniform electron gas . the gga form for the exchange energy is simply @xmath16=\\int n\\varepsilon_{\\text{x}}^{\\text{lda}}(n)f_{\\text{x}}(s)d^{3}r , \\label{eq : equ2}\\ ] ] in which @xmath17 ( with fermi wave vector @xmath18 ) is the dimensionless reduced gradient and @xmath19 is the exchange enhancement factor .",
    "any gga that reproduces the uniform gas limit can be expressed as [ ] @xmath20 and accordingly @xmath16=\\int n\\varepsilon_{\\text{x}}^{\\text{lda}}(n)\\lbrace 1+\\mu_{\\text{ge}}s^{2}+\\ldots \\rbrace d^{3}r",

    "although this gga belongs to the class of parameter - free functionals , it still contains some arbitrary choices , e.g. , the analytical form of the enhancement factor or the constraints that have to be satisfied .",
    "it has been shown [ , ] that in order to obtain the accurate exchange energy for free neutral atoms , any gga must have @xmath22 . for the pbe functional , @xmath23 is set to 0.2195 from slightly different requirement which is based on the reproduction of the lda jellium response . here , @xmath19 has the form @xmath24 the parameter @xmath25 , which controls behaviour at @xmath26 , is set to 0.804 according to the relation @xmath27 to ensure the lieb - oxford ( lo ) bound [ ] , which is an upper limit on the ratio of the exact exchange - correlation energy to the value of the lda approximation of the exchange energy",
    "@xmath28\\geq e_{\\text{xc}}[n]\\geq \\lambda_{\\text{lo}}e_{\\text{x}}^{\\text{lda}}[n]$ ] with @xmath29 . at the limit of a slowly - varying high density ,",
    "the ge for the correlation energy of a gga can be written as @xmath30=\\int n\\lbrace \\varepsilon_{\\text{c}}^{\\text{lda}}(n)+\\beta_{\\text{ge}}t^{2}+\\ldots \\rbrace d^{3}r = e_{\\text{c}}^{\\text{lda}}[n]+\\int n\\lbrace \\beta_{\\text{ge}}t^{2}+\\ldots \\rbrace d^{3}r , \\label{eq : equ7}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the correlation energy per particle of the uniform electron gas , @xmath32 is a coefficient set to 0.0667 [ ] , and @xmath33 ( with thomas - fermi screening wave vector @xmath34 ) denotes an appropriate reduced density gradient for correlation . in the pbe correlation",
    "functional , the value of @xmath32 is retained , whereas in pbesol [ ] , it is chosen to be 0.046 in order to reproduce the accurate exchange - correlation energy for a jellium surface obtained at the meta - gga tpss [ ] level . in the pbesol exchange functional",
    ", the value of @xmath23 , which determines behaviour for @xmath35 , is restored back to @xmath36 , since it has been argued [ ] that @xmath22 is harmful for many condensed matter applications .",
    "this choice allows to recover the second - order ge , but on the other hand , it means that pbesol no longer satisfies the lda jellium response , because @xmath37 .",
    "thus , as @xmath35 , there is no complete cancellation between beyond - lda exchange and correlation contributions . while constructing the pbe functional , this sort of cancellation",
    "was believed to be more accurate than the lower - order gradient expansion for small @xmath38 .",
    "although pbe works equally well for finite and infinite systems [ ] , pbesol outperforms it in various crystalline structure calculations .",
    "nevertheless , this benefit is accompanied by a worsening of the thermochemical properties [ ] .",
    "it is evident that due to pretty simple mathematical form of gga one has to choose between improved atomization energies of molecules or improved lattice parameters of solids [ ] .",
    "the sogga exchange functional [ ] , used in combination with the pbe correlation functional , completely restores the ge to the second order for both exchange and correlation .",
    "the analytical form of the sogga exchange enhancement factor is expressed as an average of the pbe and rpbe [ ] exchange functionals @xmath39 in which @xmath40 .",
    "the parameter @xmath25 is set to 0.552 in order to satisfy a tighter lo bound @xmath28\\geq e_{\\text{xc}}[n]\\geq \\lambda_{\\text{tlo}}e_{\\text{x}}^{\\text{lda}}[n]$ ] with @xmath41 .",
    "the wc exchange enhancement factor is given by [ ] @xmath42 where @xmath43 parameters @xmath25 and @xmath23 have the same values as in pbe and @xmath44 is set to recover the fourth order parameters of the fourth order ge of the exchange functional for small @xmath38 ( unfortunately , incorrectly [ ] ) . on the whole , the analysis of a large set of solids [ ] shows that concerning the lattice constants pbesol , sogga , and wc perform quite similarly , and in most cases demonstrate an explicit improvement over the typically underestimated and overestimated values of lda and pbe , respectively .",
    "it is interesting to note that for some solids the overestimated lattice constants can be improved by including a fraction of the exact hartree - fock ( hf ) exchange energy [ ] . among the so called hybrid functionals ,",
    "pbe0 [ ] is defined by @xmath45=ae_{\\text{x}}^{\\text{hf}}+(1-a)e_{\\text{x}}^{\\text{pbe}}[n]+e_{\\text{c}}^{\\text{pbe}}[n ] , \\label{eq : equ11}\\ ] ] where the amount of mixing coefficient @xmath46 has been derived from theoretical arguments through the perturbation theory .",
    "however , due to the slow decay of the hf exchange interaction , which in some cases can reach up to hundreds of angstroms , the evaluation of @xmath47 may be computationally very demanding .",
    "fortunately , it was demonstrated [ ] that the screened hf exchange , in which the computationally expensive long - range part is replaced by a corresponding pbe counterpart , exhibits all physically relevant properties of the full hf exchange . the resulting expression for the exchange - correlation energy , known as hse06 [ ] ,",
    "is given by @xmath48=ae_{\\text{x}}^{\\text{hf , sr},\\omega}+(1-a)e_{\\text{x}}^{\\text{pbe , sr},\\omega}[n]+e_{\\text{x}}^{\\text{pbe , lr},\\omega}[n]+e_{\\text{c}}^{\\text{pbe}}[n ] .",
    "\\label{eq : equ12}\\ ] ] here , ( sr ) and ( lr ) denote the short- and long - range parts of the respective exchange interactions .",
    "the separation of them is achieved through a partitioning of the coulomb potential for exchange @xmath49 where @xmath50 , and @xmath51 is the screening parameter that defines the separation range .",
    "for @xmath52 , the pbe0 functional is recovered , and for @xmath53 , hse06 becomes identical to pbe .",
    "the value of the screening parameter @xmath54 bohr@xmath55 was chosen as a reasonable compromise between computational cost and the quality of the results which , regarding the lattice constants , are similar to those obtained using the pbe0 functional [ ] .",
    "interestingly , it appears that the accuracy of the lattice constants can be increased for both screened and non - screened hybrid schemes by substituting the pbe functional with the ones revised for solids . for the screened hybrids , the hsesol functional [ ]",
    "was introduced which has the same form ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : equ12 ] ) and the same range - separation parameter as hse06 , but it is based on pbesol for the exchange as well as correlation part . concerning the non - screened hybrids , the b1wc functional [ ]  which is in turn based on the pbe0 scheme ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : equ11 ] ) with the pbe exchange and correlation correspondingly replaced by wc and pw [ ] , and parameter @xmath56 set to 0.16  also shows promising results , especially for the perovskite - structured materials [ ] .",
    "the ferromagnetic state of low - temperature orthorhombic srruo@xmath1 was modelled with the crystal14 code [ ] employing a linear combination of atom - centered gaussian orbitals .",
    "the small - core hay - wadt pseudopotentials [ ] were utilized to describe the inner - shell electrons ( @xmath57 ) of sr and ru atoms .",
    "the valence part of the basis set for sr ( @xmath58 ) was adopted from the srtio@xmath1 study [ ] , while the valence functions for ru ( @xmath59 ) were taken from our previous work on non - stoichiometric srruo@xmath1 [ ] . regarding the o atom , the all - electron basis set with a double set of @xmath60 functions",
    "was applied from the caco@xmath1 study [ ] .",
    "all these aforementioned basis sets are also available online at crystal s basis sets library [ ] .",
    "while performing full geometry optimization , the default values were chosen for most of the technical setup , the details of which can be found in crystal14 user s manual [ ] .",
    "however , the parameters that define the convergence threshold on total energy and truncation criteria for bielectronic integrals were tightened to ( 8) and ( 8 8 8 8 16 ) , respectively .",
    "besides , the allowed root - mean - square values of energy gradients and nuclear displacements were correspondingly set to more severe ones : 0.00006 and 0.00012 in atomic units . in order to improve the self - consistence field convergence , the kohn - sham matrix mixing technique ( at @xmath61 ) together with anderson s method [ ] , as proposed by hamman [ ] , were applied .",
    "the reciprocal space was sampled according to regular sublattice with a shrinking factor of 8 , resulting in 125 independent * _ k _ * points in the first irreducible brillouin zone .",
    "we would like to remark that in this paper instead of the original pw functional the correlation part from the pbe framework was taken for the modified b1wc calculations , named as mb1wc . in the meantime",
    ", lda exchange was combined with vwn correlation [ ] , whereas pbe , sogga , and wc exchange functionals were used with the correlation part of pbe .",
    "the pbesol exchange functional was employed with the correlation part of pbesol and pbe .",
    "a separate notation pbesol^pbe^ was introduced for the latter combination .",

    "the low - temperature experimental data are also presented therein , however , no zero - point anharmonic expansion ( zpae ) corrections were applied . on one hand , it is not straightforward to evaluate zpae corrections for the non - cubic systems . on the other hand , zpae should not have a noticeable influence on material like srruo@xmath0 . our previous non - magnetic calculations [ ] indicate that zpae correction for the lattice constant of cubic srruo@xmath0 reaches at most @xmath62 and therefore can be treated as negligible .",
    "the given mean absolute relative errors ( mares ) were evaluated according to the expression @xmath63 in which @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the calculated and experimental values of the considered parameter , respectively .",

    "as it was already noted by garca - fernndez @xmath7 @xmath91 [ ] for a variety of perovskites , calculation of tilting and rotation angles involves energy changes that are much more subtle than those associated with lattice parameters , therefore relative errors of dft approaches become more pronounced . and",
    "indeed , table [ tab1 ] clearly demonstrates that deviations from experiment are much larger than previously discussed ones , especially for the rotation angle @xmath67 .",
    "revisions made to pbesol , sogga , and wc approximations have a quite small positive impact on the performance of pbe and , what is more surprising , are sufficient to outperform lda only for the tilting angle @xmath66 .",

    "however , the most interesting observation is that neither enhancement factor revision nor inclusion of a portion of exact exchange is able to alone improve the results of pbe to an acceptable level .",
    "only a combination of both has an effect large enough to reduce mare@xmath76 to values near a satisfactory threshold , like @xmath100 for hsesol and @xmath101 for mb1wc hybrids .",
    "this is a somewhat unexpected trend , once again confirming that variations in tilting and rotation angles are extremely energetically sensitive and difficult to accurately reproduce .",
    "an additional comparison to the @xmath5 [ ] performance with its mare@xmath76 reaching @xmath102 indicates that a hubbard - type electron correlation correction is negligible , as we have already remarked from the analysis of lattice parameters .",
    "in contrast to the tilting and rotation angles , the internal parameters of ruo@xmath11 octahedra are reproduced with commendable accuracy .",
    "even the pbe functional  the worst performer so far  yields reasonable results with its mare@xmath0 reaching @xmath103 , which is just slightly above the satisfactory threshold .",
    "the rest of the ggas , on the other hand , do not exceed @xmath79 for mare@xmath0 but their good execution remains a bit worse compared to that of lda ( @xmath104 ) , especially for the bond distances ru - o .",
    "however , the same can not be said about the results of @xmath5 [ ] framework , despite the fact that our previous analysis of lattice parameters and interoctahedral angles revealed only a small difference between lda and @xmath5 performance . in this case ,",
    "mare@xmath0 for @xmath5 increases to @xmath86 , and that is the most prominent discrepancy noticed for these two methods .",
    "it is no longer surprising that the inclusion of a portion of hf exchange has a positive impact on the results of pbe with mare@xmath0 being reduced to @xmath105 for pbe0 and @xmath106 for hse06 .",
    "although the interchange with pbesol functional gives even a better effect ( hsesol with @xmath107 ) , the closest resemblance to the experiment was demonstrated by mb1wc hybrid with its excellent mare@xmath0 value of @xmath108 .",
    "one can note that mb1wc is able to outperform lda for practically every parameter of ruo@xmath11 . on the whole",
    ", the performance of all presented functionals can be considered as rather good and , to be honest , that is not a very astonishing trend .",
    "octahedral deformations in srruo@xmath0 are very energetically costly [ ] , therefore large energy variations involved in ruo@xmath11 geometry optimization are easier to deal with for a variety of dft approximations .",
    "the values of mare@xmath77 reflect the overall performance of tested functionals in reproducing the ground - state crystalline structure of srruo@xmath0 by taking into account both the internal geometry of the unit cell and lattice parameters . from table",
    "[ tab1 ] it is seen that despite its well - known versatility for finite and infinite systems the original pbe approach undoubtedly remains the last selection among all the contestants .",
    "its mare@xmath77 value of @xmath109 practically two times exceeds our satisfactory threshold , and even the incorporation of @xmath85 of the exact full - range hf exchange does not help to achieve desired mare@xmath110 ( pbe0 with @xmath111 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the screening of hf exchange in the hse - type framework is effective enough to improve mare@xmath77 to a satisfactory result ( hse06 with @xmath112 ) , although the difference between the performance of these two hybrids is not very significant .",
    "the more surprising result is demonstrated by lda functional , since its value of @xmath113 is not only noticeably smaller than that of @xmath5 [ ] scheme ( @xmath114 )  conclusively convincing that the hubbard @xmath95 term is unnecessary for the geometry optimization of bulk srruo@xmath0 ,  but is also more or less of the same magnitude as mare@xmath77 of revised wc ( @xmath86 ) and pbesol ( @xmath115 ) approximations .",
    "the initial advantage of these two ggas obtained while reproducing lattice constants and volume is gradually lost when internal geometry of srruo@xmath0 is taken into consideration . and",
    "yet , the combination of @xmath116 $ ] and @xmath117 $ ] as well as modifications present in @xmath118 appear to be sufficiently fruitful to bring respective mare@xmath77 of pbesol^pbe^ ( @xmath119 ) and sogga ( @xmath120 ) close to  good \" theoretical values ( @xmath79 ) . a similar result is also yielded by hsesol hybrid ( @xmath88 ) , but in this case the largest benefit is derived from the superior reproduction of tilting and rotation angles .",
    "however , a mare@xmath77 value of @xmath121 apparently speaks of the best overall performance which belongs to the mb1wc hybrid  the only functional that tightly satisfied the @xmath84 criterion for all four considered mares .",
    "moreover , the values of mare@xmath122 , mare@xmath123 , and mare@xmath77 are found to be below @xmath79 threshold confirming its perfect suitability for the complete description of the crystalline structure of srruo@xmath0 .",
    "an analysis of previous study in which the older version of crystal code was employed [ ] reveals that mare@xmath77 values of dft results provided therein ( lda , pbe , pbesol , wc , pbe0 , mb1wc ) are worse compared to ours on average by about @xmath124 .",
    "we believe that the most probable source of this discrepancy lies in the basis sets utilized in the calculations and therefore has nothing to do with versions of the crystal code .",
    "since basis set for sr is well - tested and identical in both studies , basis sets for o are of the same reliable quality , the factor that remains is the difference between the basis sets for ru . we have adopted a valence part specially optimized for srruo@xmath0 , and it seems that our choice paid off , even despite the tighter convergence criteria applied in the work of garca - fernndez @xmath7 @xmath91 on the other hand , a direct comparison to the previous plane - wave based lda calculations , carried out by three groups using two distinct @xmath125 @xmath126 packages [ , , ] , shows a good agreement with the tendencies of lda noticed in our study : mare@xmath127 , mare@xmath128 , and mare@xmath129 . a somewhat worse overall performance of these works ( zayak @xmath7 @xmath91 with mare@xmath130 , rondinelli @xmath7 @xmath91 with mare@xmath131 , miao @xmath7 @xmath91 with mare@xmath132 ) could be influenced by different technical parameters , specific selection of @xmath133 $ ] parametrization , and even the way the dft functionals are implemented in a particular code [ ] .      the calculated electronic structure and magnetic moment of srruo@xmath0 can be found in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] and table [ tab1 ] , respectively .",
    "we have applied the experimental geometry while investigating these properties , since it allows us to eliminate the differences that may rise due to the non - equivalent lattice parameters , distorting the direct comparison between the performance of tested dft approaches .",
    "our decision was motivated by the work of grns @xmath7 @xmath91 [ ] in which the calculated magnetic moments appeared to be quite sensitive to the chosen equilibrium volume of srruo@xmath0 .",
    "in addition , we have excluded several functionals from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] leaving only those that satisfied the @xmath84 of mare@xmath77 criterion and reflected the typical behaviour of the particular rung of the ladder .",
    "therefore , the remaining functionals represent lda , gga ( pbesol^pbe^ ) , and hybrid approximations with a fraction of hf exchange set to @xmath89 ( mb1wc ) and @xmath85 ( hsesol ) .",
    "concerning the electronic structure , the nm density of states ( dos ) indicates that valence band of srruo@xmath0 is formed by strongly hybridized ru @xmath92 and o @xmath134 orbitals , with the former ones being dominant in the vicinity of @xmath135 and the latter ones being more pronounced at higher binding energy regions .",
    "the position of the main peaks and shape of the spectra are in a good overall agreement with some recent ultraviolet and x - ray photoemission spectroscopy measurements [ ] , and this result only quantitatively depends on the choice of the functional .",
    "one can note that performance of lda and gga in reproducing nm dos is identical , while hybrids demonstrate a suppression of electronic states at @xmath135 and a spectral shift of @xmath1360.5 ev for higher binding energies .",
    "however , the picture becomes qualitatively different when energetically more favourable fm solution appears on the scene . in this case ,",
    "not only does the spectral shift get more pronounced for the mb1wc and hsesol schemes , but also a band gap opens in the spin - up channel paving the way for the half - metal state in which conduction of the system is assured solely by the spin - down electrons . in the meantime ,",
    "lda and gga frameworks continue to demonstrate metallic behaviour , as their first peak in the spin - up channel clearly crosses @xmath135",
    ". a careful look at the fm part of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] reveals that lda exhibits a larger overlap of the spin - up and spind - down bands at @xmath135 compared to that of gga , and this is also reflected in the values of magnetic moment in table [ tab1 ] : @xmath137 versus @xmath138 @xmath139 per formula unit . if one would take into account experimental uncertainty , @xmath140 could practically ideally match the provided result of magnetization measurement in srruo@xmath1 .",
    "hybrids , on the other hand , yield a saturated magnetic moment of 2 @xmath139 per formula unit which has not been reported from the laboratories so far . thus",
    ", as long as the experimental observation of half - metallicity and the saturation of magnetic moment remains a serious challenge [ ] , lda seems to be the functional of choice for the realistic reproduction of electronic and magnetic structure of srruo@xmath1 .",
    "this outcome is also confirmed by different basis set , for instance , plane - waves [ ] or muffin - tin orbitals [ ] , calculations .",
    "the fact that we used the same correlation functional for pbe , pbesol^pbe^ , pbe0 , sogga , and wc allows us to present a few significant insights into the inner structure of srruo@xmath1 .",
    "firstly , a simple step that leads from @xmath141 to @xmath142 appears to be the most important for the accurate description of the geometry of srruo@xmath1 .",
    "this can be noticed by analysing the overall performance of pbe , pbesol^pbe^ , and pbe0 ( mare@xmath77 in table [ tab1 ] )  the inclusion of a fraction of hf exchange into the pbe framework is not that effective compared to the modification of parameter @xmath23 , which was set from @xmath143 to @xmath144 .",
    "secondly , the modification of parameter @xmath145 in the correlation part ( @xmath146 ) has much less impact  seen from comparison between mare@xmath77 of pbesol^pbe^ and pbesol  indicating that the magnitude of the exchange energy is substantially larger compared to the correlation energy .",
    "besides , a slightly better performance of the pbesol^pbe^ combination implies that the restoration of ge for correlation is more relevant for bulk srruo@xmath1 than the original choice to reproduce exchange - correlation energy of jellium surface at the tpss level [ ]",
    ". a close look at fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] reveals that @xmath141 and @xmath147 are nearly identical for @xmath148 .",
    "having in mind that mare@xmath77 results obtained with pbe and wc functionals are in a noticeable discrepancy , one can make an assumption that the average reduced density gradient @xmath38 should exceed this value in srruo@xmath1 .",
    "although the wc approach has rather complicated form , which ensures the same behaviour as pbe for @xmath149 and @xmath26 , examination of the terms in @xmath150 , presented in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , shows that at @xmath38 values larger than @xmath1360.5 the first term @xmath151 starts dominating over the remaining two . since this term is exactly the same as the one in pbesol , it becomes clear why these two functionals with distinct @xmath23 values are both able to improve the pbe calculations",
    "this once again confirms the significance of the exact second - order ge for the description of the crystalline structure of srruo@xmath1 .",
    "another close look at fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] indicates that the sogga and pbesol @xmath19 curves are almost identical up to @xmath152 .",
    "this observation is perfectly consistent with a very similar performance of sogga and pbesol^pbe^ reflected in the results of all four mares .",
    "if the average value of @xmath38 would be higher , we should obtain a more pronounced difference between sogga and pbesol^pbe^. however , the difference is negligible meaning that the average value of @xmath38 should fall in the range of @xmath153 .",
    "such range testifies about a moderately - varying density in srruo@xmath1 .",
    "it is also interesting that another two similarly performing functionals  pbesol and wc  have different parameters in exchange and correlation parts .",
    "as we have already found out that the first term in @xmath150 makes the largest contribution to @xmath147 , one can note that the effect of the addition of remaining two terms somewhat corresponds to the effect of the modification of correlation functional in pbesol .",
    "a comparison between the non - screened pbe0 hybrid and its screened hse06 counterpart also offers a few thoughts on the intrinsic features of srruo@xmath1 . on one hand , only a slightly improved performance of the hse06 functional shows that the non - screened lr part of the hf exchange interaction , present in the pbe0 scheme , is quite unimportant .",
    "a beneficial reduction of the self - interaction error , common for ggas , appears to take place at the sr distance , which turns out to be not so short , extending over two or three chemical bonds in various crystalline materials [ ] . on the other hand , a worse performance of the pbe0 functional unveils that the inclusion of the lr exact exchange has a small but negative impact on the geometry of srruo@xmath1 .",
    "this is not an unexpected trend , though , since the lr portion of the hf exchange may lead to unphysical results in solids [ ] , especially metallic systems , due to the incomplete cancellation with the approximate correlation functional [ ] .",
    "however , a factor that has a greater influence on the performance of hybrids is the amount of exact exchange incorporated through the mixing parameter @xmath56 . as we have already found that pbesol and wc demonstrate similar values of mares and hse - type correction is not essential , a comparison between hsesol and mb1wc allows to take a look at the effect of @xmath56 reduction from 0.25 to 0.16 . one can note that mb1wc produces noticeably better results which in turn indicate that the typical @xmath85 value of the hf exchange is not the best option for srruo@xmath1",
    "a fraction of @xmath89 , in the meantime , is in agreement with the recent observation that a mixing of @xmath154 seems to be more appropriate choice for the description of the perovskite family [ ] .",
    "the advantage of mb1wc over hsesol also points to the smaller self - interaction error the dft approaches deal with in this perovskite .",
    "in this work , we have investigated the crystalline structure of ground - state orthorhombic srruo@xmath0 by applying a bunch of functionals from three families of dft approximations : lda , ggas , and hybrids .",
    "the calculated equilibrium structural parameters  ( a ) lattice constants and volume , ( b ) tilting and rotation angles , and ( c ) internal angles and bond distances within ruo@xmath11 octahedra  were compared with the low - temperature experimental data .",
    "our analysis of the obtained results allows to highlight several important points .",
    "firstly , the pbe functional is apparently the worst performer among all the contestants , therefore it should be considered as the last option for the geometry optimization of srruo@xmath0 .",
    "secondly , the restoration of the exact second - order density ge for exchange  in one way or another incorporated into the revised pbesol , sogga , and wc ggas ",
    "effectively ameliorates performance of the pbe approach , especially for the lattice constants and volume .",
    "thirdly , the inclusion of a portion of the hf exchange also has a positive impact on the crystalline structure of srruo@xmath0 with respect to the pbe results .",
    "in addition , the hse - type screening of the lr part of the exact exchange is not an essential ingredient for the improvement provided by the hybrid framework .",
    "fourthly and finally , a combination of the revised ggas with the hybrid scheme seems to be the most appropriate tool for the accurate description of the external [ ( a ) ] and internal [ ( b ) and ( c ) ] structural parameters simultaneously .",
    "however , amounts of hf exchange smaller than the standard @xmath85 should be preferred . based on these findings",
    ", we are able to offer some recommendations for further theoretical modelling of experimentally observed phases of srruo@xmath0 .",
    "if the research is limited to the lattice constants and volume , one should give a chance to the revised ggas for solids ( pbesol / pbesol^pbe^ , sogga , wc ) due to their impressive performance and substantially lower computational cost compared to the hybrids .",
    "but if the field of interest comprises interoctahedral angles or full geometry of the system , one should lean towards the hybrids which are based on the revised ggas ( mb1wc , hsesol ) .",
    "although the internal geometry of ruo@xmath11 is well described by both families of functionals , in case of full geometry of the system hybrids are superior because of their significantly better performance in reproducing tilting and rotation angles .",
    "it is also interesting to note that additionally calculated electronic and magnetic structure of srruo@xmath0 indicates that lda , despite its striking simplicity , can be treated as the most universal of all the tested functionals .",
    "a reasonable geometry optimization followed by a realistic representation of electronic structure and magnetic moment shows that this approximation can be a serious competitor if the crystalline structure is not the only issue the research is focused on .",
