    "<S> systematic @xmath0p - nmr studies on lafe(as@xmath1p@xmath2)(o@xmath3f@xmath4 ) with @xmath5=0.05 and 0.1 have revealed that the antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations ( afmsfs ) at low energies are markedly enhanced around @xmath6=0.6 and 0.4 , respectively , and as a result , @xmath7 exhibits respective peaks at 24 and 27 k against the p substitution for as . </S>",
    "<S> this result demonstrates that the afmsfs are responsible for the increase in @xmath7 for lafe(as@xmath1p@xmath2)(o@xmath3f@xmath4 ) as a primary mediator of the cooper pairing . from a systematic comparison of afmsfs with a series of ( la@xmath8y@xmath9)feaso@xmath10 compounds in which @xmath7 reaches 50 k for @xmath11=0.95 </S>",
    "<S> , we remark that a moderate development of afmsfs causes @xmath7 to increase up to 50 k under the condition that the local lattice parameters of the feas tetrahedron approach those of the regular tetrahedron . </S>",
    "<S> we propose that @xmath7 of fe - pnictides exceeding 50 k is maximized under an intimate collaboration of the afmsfs and other factors originating from the optimization of the local structure . </S>"
