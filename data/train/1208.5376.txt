    "max - stable processes arise naturally when studying extremes of stochastic processes and therefore play a major role in the statistical modelling of spatial extremes @xcite .",
    "although a different spectral characterization of max - stable processes exists @xcite , for our purposes the most useful representation is @xcite @xmath0 where @xmath1 are the points of a poisson process on @xmath2 with intensity @xmath3 and @xmath4 are independent replicates of a non - negative continuous sample path stochastic process @xmath5 such that @xmath6 for all @xmath7 .",

    "@xcite propose a semi - parametric estimator and @xcite suggest the use of the maximum pairwise likelihood estimator .    paralleling the use of the variogram in classical geostatistics , the extremal coefficient function @xcite @xmath15 is widely used to summarize the spatial dependence of extremes .",
    "it takes values in the interval @xmath16 $ ] ; the lower bound indicates complete dependence , and the upper one independence .",
    "the last decade has seen many advances to develop a geostatistic of extremes and software is available to practitioners @xcite .",
    "however an important tool currently missing is conditional simulation of max - stable processes . in classical geostatistic based on gaussian models ,",
    "conditional simulations are well established @xcite and provide a framework to assess the distribution of a gaussian random field given values observed at fixed locations .",
    "for example , conditional simulations of gaussian processes have been used to model land topography @xcite .",
    "conditional simulation of max - stable processes is a long - standing problem @xcite .",
    "@xcite provide a first solution , but their framework is limited to processes having a discrete spectral measure and thus may be too restrictive to appropriately model the spatial dependence in complex situations .    based on the recent developments on the regular conditional distribution of max - infinitely divisible processes ,",
    "the aim of this paper is to provide a methodology to get conditional simulations of max - stable processes with continuous spectral measures .",
    "more formally for a study region @xmath17 , our goal is to derive an algorithm to sample from the regular conditional distribution of @xmath18 for some @xmath13 and @xmath19 conditioning locations @xmath20 .",

    "the second key point is that , conditionally on @xmath42 , the poisson point process @xmath34 can be decomposed into two independent point processes , say @xmath43 , where @xmath44    before introducing a procedure to get conditional realizations of max - stable processes , we introduce notation and make connections with the pioneering work of @xcite .    a function @xmath45 such that @xmath46 for some @xmath47 is called an extremal function associated to @xmath48 and denoted by @xmath49 .",
    "it is easy to show that there exists almost surely a unique extremal function associated to @xmath48 .",
    "although @xmath50 almost surely , it might happen that a single extremal function contributes to the random vector @xmath51 at several locations @xmath48 , e.g. , @xmath52 . to take such repetitions into account , we define a random partition @xmath53 of the set @xmath54 into @xmath55 blocks and extremal functions @xmath56 such that @xmath57 and @xmath58 if @xmath59 and @xmath60 if @xmath61 @xmath62 .",

    "the previous section introduced a procedure to get realizations from the regular conditional distribution of max - stable processes .",
    "this sampling scheme amounts to sample from a discrete distribution whose state space corresponds to all possible partitions of the set of conditioning points , see theorem  [ thm:3stepscondsim ] step 1 .",
