    "according to a well known principle , expanding ( and more generally , hyperbolic ) dynamical systems have combinatorial nature and are determined by a finite amount of data .",
    "for instance , they are _ finitely presented _ , see  @xcite .",
    "this principle can be also formulated in a form of structural stability or rigidity theorems : two hyperbolic dynamical systems that are topologically or homotopically close to each other are conjugate .",
    "the aim of our paper is to describe , by proving the corresponding rigidity theorem , a complete algebraic invariant of expanding dynamical systems .",
    "we translate then this algebraic invariant into a more geometric language of polyhedral models of dynamical systems ( and their julia sets ) .",
    "these models give a representation of the julia set of the dynamical system as an inverse limit of simplicial complexes that are constructed using simple cut - and - paste rules , similar to subdivision rules in one - dimensional complex dynamics .",
    "we illustrate our techniques , in particular , by constructing combinatorial models of the julia sets of multi - dimensional dynamical systems .",
    "we define the algebraic invariant ( called the _ iterated monodromy group _ ) in a general setting of a multi - valued partially defined dynamical system .",
    "namely , a _",
    "topological automaton _ is a pair of maps @xmath0 , @xmath1 between two topological spaces ( or orbispaces ) , such that @xmath2 is a finite covering map .",
    "if @xmath3 is a homeomorphism , then we can identify @xmath4 and @xmath5 by @xmath3 , thus getting a dynamical system @xmath6 . if @xmath3 is an embedding ,",
    "then @xmath0 is a partial self - covering .",
    "iterated monodromy groups were originally defined for partial self - coverings only ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "however , the fact that @xmath3 is an embedding is not used neither in the construction nor in the main results of  @xcite . moreover ,",
    "iterated monodromy groups of partial self - coverings of orbispaces are defined in  @xcite essentially in the setting of topological automata .",
    "topological automata were studied ( under different names ) by t.  katsura in  @xcite in relation with @xmath7-algebras , and by y.  ishii and j.  smillie  @xcite in relation with homotopical rigidity of hyperbolic dynamical systems .",
    "the last article was one of inspirations of our paper .",
    "a topological automaton @xmath8 can be naturally iterated .",

    "for instance , if @xmath0 is an expanding partial self - covering , then we can replace @xmath43 , @xmath2 and the embedding @xmath44 by homotopically equivalent spaces and maps @xmath24 , thus getting a topological automaton @xmath37 combinatorially equivalent to the partial self - covering @xmath2 . if we find a length structure on @xmath45 such that @xmath46 is contracting with respect to the lift of the length structure of @xmath45 to @xmath47 by @xmath2 , then theorem  [ th : main1 ]",

    "( here the julia set of an expanding map is defined as the limit set of inverse iterations . ) in particular , the spaces @xmath49 approximate the julia set of @xmath2 .",
    "a known example of this approach are the classical hubbard trees of post - critically finite polynomials ( see  @xcite ) , which are constructed by retracting the _ thurston orbispace _ of the polynomial onto a finite tree .",
