    "fingerprinting schemes have been invented for traitor tracing as a means of copyright protection . to this end , each user is provided with his own individually modified copy of the host signal ( i.e. , the content that is copyright protected ) .",
    "the modification entails embedding a unique signature , also known as a fingerprint , in the host signal .",
    "the fingerprint can later be retrieved by a detector examining an illegal copy of the content in order to implicate the users who took part in the forgery .",
    "a myriad of fingerprint designs and detection procedures have been proposed in the literature .",
    "examples include orthogonal fingerprints @xcite , regular simplex fingerprints @xcite , random gaussian fingerprints @xcite , @xcite , and fingerprints with equiangular tight frames ( etf ) @xcite .",

    ", one such type of collusion attack is linear averaging , in which the colluders estimate the host signal as the linear average of their marked copies .",
    "this attack is studied in numerous works @xcite .",
    "a novel collusion attack is introduced in @xcite that proves detrimental against both random and deterministic fingerprints as long as they are from a finite alphabet .",
    "the entries of random fingerprints are chosen i.i.d . from a finite set according to a distribution while deterministic fingerprints are designed non - randomly often according to some geometric or algebraic property .",
    "the analysis in @xcite shows that if the size of collusion is of order @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the length of a real - valued host signal , the attackers can accurately estimate the host signal with high probability . in particular",
    ", this attack improves over the previous best - known attack against etf fingerprints @xcite , i.e. , the linear averaging attack .",
    "it was shown that finite alphabet etf random or deterministic fingerprints can withstand linear averaging attack as long as number of colluders is bounded by @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively , where @xmath4 denotes the total number of fingerprinted copies @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we analyze the error probability of the aforementioned collusion attack against uniformly symmetric random fingerprints and obtain a bound on the number of colluders necessary to succeed with high probability .",
    "furthermore , we study the performance of the attack against two more probabilistic fingerprints : optimal probabilistic fingerprint ( opf ) codes , aka tardos codes , and column - wise random fingerprints ( tardos - like codes ) .",
    "the opf codes are introduced in @xcite that are @xmath5-secure against @xmath6 pirates and have length @xmath7 .",
    "our analysis shows that our collusion attack outperforms the linear averaging @xcite , minority voting @xcite , and the majority voting attacks @xcite , the latter two known to be effective collusion attacks against the opf codes .",
    "we further generalize the application of this collusion attack to continuous alphabet codes , specifically gaussian fingerprints by quantizing their support set .",
    "our analysis shows a good performance of the generalized attack compared with the uniform linear averaging attack , proved to be optimal among the class of order - statistic collusion attacks , when the colluders are subject to a mean squared distortion constraint @xcite .",
    "the rest of paper is organized as follows : section [ sec : set ] describes the mathematical model of the fingerprinting problem . in section [ att ] , we present the proposed collusion attack .",
    "section [ sec : etf ] , [ estim ] , and [ sec : pro ] examine the attack s effectiveness on both deterministic and random fingerprints and propose lower bounds on the number of colluders that can break the fingerprinting system with high probability . in section [ simulation ] , we use simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness of our attack on two types of fingerprint codes .",
