    "there is a long - standing problem in high - energy scattering which could have been addressed over a decade ago but was not , apparently for a lack of applications .",
    "the problem resurfaced a few years ago in a mutated form when ringwald@xcite and espinosa@xcite pointed out that a strict application of the standard dilute - instanton - gas approximation ( diga ) in the electroweak standard model leads to large @xmath5violating cross sections for @xmath3 scattering when @xmath6 ( that is , at energies @xmath7 sphaleron mass@xcite ) .",
    "shortly thereafter one us pointed out@xcite that the same diga , in the remarkable application of lipatov@xcite and others@xcite to finding the terms of large - order perturbation theory@xcite , gives the wrong high - energy behavior to purely perturbative processes essentially because the diga cuts off instanton size scales in the infrared by masses and not by characteristic energies .",
    "the lipatov - diga provides a convenient means of obtaining factorially divergent matrix elements @xmath8 ( for @xmath9 ) which ultimately need to be tamed by unitarity or , where applicable , borel summation@xcite . in this paper",
    "we will not be concerned with how these divergences are brought under control , which is an interesting and important issue by itself , but rather we will concentrate on the their energy dependence  an aspect which the lipatov - diga is not well suited to address .",
    "the shortcomings of the liptov - diga become evident if one considers the dependence of @xmath8 on the center of mass scattering energy @xmath10 when @xmath11 and the average energy per outgoing particle , @xmath12 are large compared to all masses involved , one anticipates that @xmath13 should scale like @xmath14 ( aside from logarithms and @xmath15dependent factors ) .",
    "however , in the lipatov - diga @xmath13 scales like @xmath16 for some fixed mass @xmath17 even if @xmath18 the suspicious energy - independence of the basic lipatov - diga calls into question the rle of energetic external particles in factorially divergent scattering amplitudes and leads one to ask how such amplitudes can co - exist with energy - dependent amplitudes which do not diverge factorially . in this paper",
    "we present a unified analysis of this problem based on conventional feynman diagram techniques which demonstrate the emergence of factorially divergent amplitudes and their interplay with familiar energy - dependent amplitudes .    for definiteness , we will study the two - particle total cross section in a theory characterized by the interaction lagrangian @xmath19 in particular , we will concentrate on the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude @xmath20 which is related to the two - particle total cross section through unitarity .",
    "in addition to introducing a class of amplitudes whose sum exhibits factorially divergent behavior we will also consider the consequences of amplitudes with high - energy infrared ( ir ) logarithms ( few graphs , but with many partial waves ) which profoundly alter the overall energy dependence .",
    "these ir logarithms , associated with the occurrence of many propagators with small momentum transfers arise from graphical analyses much older than the lipatov approach : multiperipheralism@xcite .    the study of multiperipheral graphs like the uncrossed ladder graph of fig .",
    "[ fi : ladder ] is based on considering large orders of perturbation theory with an emphasis on summing leading infrared logarithms which eventually appear as sums of powers of @xmath21 contributions of @xmath22 order ladder graphs to @xmath20 are not accompanied by a factor of @xmath23 but rather by a factor of @xmath24 and these sum to give@xcite @xmath25 \\,\\,.\\ ] ] the term with the sign of @xmath26 reversed ensures that only even powers of @xmath26 appear in the final answer .",
    "in contrast to ladder graphs , the class of graphs which we will introduce , whose sum gives @xmath23 behavior , is free from logarithms .",
    "the characteristic features of @xmath2 diagrams without logarithms in their imaginary part are the absence of multiple lines between vertices and the absence of lines beginning and ending on the same vertex ( tadpoles ) . in graph - theoretic language such diagrams",
    "are known as `` simple graphs '' . in section",
    "2 we introduce a subset of simple graphs which we call @xmath27graphs whose properties are easily understood since they are straightforward generalizations of multiperipheral graphs ; they have neither infrared nor ultraviolet logarithms in their imaginary part .",
    "a crucial part of our analysis is a factorization theorem , stated in section  3 and proved in appendix  d , which allows us to isolate the contribution of simple graphs from diagrams where they mix with ladder graphs . though we illustrate the factorization theorem using @xmath27graphs , the theorem holds for all simple graphs .",
    "using factorization to combine simple graphs with ladder graphs gives an extremely concise result : in the analysis of ladder graphs one effectively makes the substitution @xmath28 where the sum on the right - hand side is recognized as being factorially divergent .",
    "specifically , eq .  [ eq : arb ] is modified to @xmath29 \\ , \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath30 the difference between considering just @xmath27graphs or all simple graphs amounts to different estimates for the constant @xmath31 including only @xmath27graphs we find the bound @xmath32 and we estimate @xmath33 if all simple graphs are included ; the corresponding lipatov value is @xmath34 the difference between our estimates and the lipatov value likely reflects the fact that our graphical sum of contributions to @xmath35 is not exhaustive .    in eq .",
    "[ eq : dotdef ] we have introduced a modified equality sign @xmath36 which we use throughout the paper .",

    "consequently , @xmath50 factors which would normally appear in a sum like eq .",
    "[ eq : dotdef ] have no effect .",

    "[ eq : second]-[eq : dotdef ] is obvious and , in a rather hand - waving way , it is . the problem , however , is to find a way to derive it and we know of no direct application of the lipatov technique for doing this .",
    "our approach simply involves summing graphs , sometimes using the bethe - salpeter equation .",
    "though there are many regularities in our analysis which suggest an underlying semi - classical behavior , we can not yet assemble these clues into a lipatov - like semi - classical derivation of our results .",
    "the difficulty in obtaining the true high - energy behavior from lipatov theory can be traced to the fact that the lipatov - diga analysis is , in principle , only applicable to graphs with zero four - momentum on every external leg@xcite .",
    "this is a consequence of the vanishing of all the matrix elements of the semi - classical energy momentum tensor when evaluated on the lipatov instanton - like solutions of wrong - sign @xmath51 theory .",
    "one might hope that summing quantum corrections to the basic diga result will make it possible to derive high - energy results , but so far work@xcite on the analogous problem of high - energy b+l violation has not yet resolved this problem .",
    "what is needed for the semi - classical analysis to succeed at high energy is to find a means of communicating the energy of the external on - shell particles to the instantons , a feat which is most easily accomplished in minkowski space .",
    "otherwise , the instantons and analogous objects in the lipatov analysis can be of any size and , when all sizes are integrated over , the @xmath16 behavior for @xmath13 emerges , as mentioned earlier .",
    "there has been speculation as to how information on external energies can be transferred to the instantons by solving inhomogeneous instanton equations with external - particle energy - dependent sources@xcite but exact solutions of the relevant equations do not exist with the necessary generality .    in the graphical approach ,",
    "all graphs begin with the appropriate on - shell high - energy external lines attached .",
    "certain graphs , or parts of graphs , can be factored out or otherwise identified in the overall process , which have the property that they are independent of the external momenta , at least for forward scattering ; such graphs look very much like graphs with all four - momentum vanishing even though they are minkowski - space high - energy graphs , or parts thereof .",
    "it is these graphs which contribute to @xmath52 @xmath53 and the @xmath23 behavior of eq .",
    "[ eq : second ] .",
    "they are also the graphs for which we would expect some sort of semiclassical analysis to hold , but as mentioned above we do not know how to do this at the level of @xmath54 itself .",
    "an interesting problem for the future would be to find a semiclassical analysis for @xmath35 at high energy",
    ". a non - trivial extension of the present paper is to generalize the results on @xmath35 to multiloop graphs for @xmath55 the most challenging problem is to extend the results to gauge theories , where new complications arise . in @xmath2 theory",

    "[ eq : second ] are four - dimensional while in gauge theory they are two - dimensional@xcite .",
    "since there are infinitely many conformally invariant two - dimensional theories , there is no standard lipatov analysis for such theories .",
    "recently , there has been speculation@xcite on the form of this two - dimensional theory for non - abelian gauge theories and gravity in four dimensions , but the problems of incorporating the correct high - energy behavior ( i.e. , the leading logarithms ) has only begun to be addressed in this context .",
    "we will briefly discuss these problems for the future in the concluding section .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in sect .  2",
    "we identify a class of diagrams which generalizes the notion of multiperipheral graphs and we demonstrate that their contribution to @xmath35 gives rise to an energy - independent @xmath23 behavior analogous to that found by lipatov - diga techniques .",
    "we call the generalized graphs @xmath27graphs since we eventually use them to define a kernel for a bethe - salpeter equation . the statistical picture which emerges in sect .  2 brings to mind the work of bender and wu@xcite and parisi@xcite .",
    "our analysis goes beyond previous studies in that we keep track of the manner in which @xmath27graphs exhibit factorial divergences so that we can later merge them with energy - dependent amplitudes . in sect .",
