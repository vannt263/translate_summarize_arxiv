    "it is well - known that extending string theory off - shell is a hard problem . in the first quantized string theory based on an action of a single string ,",
    "the guiding principle is a local weyl invariance of string worldsheets .",
    "this immediately translates into on - shellness of string scattering amplitudes .",
    "off - shellness alone does not suggest any particular symmetry and one has to consider insertions of operators carrying dimensions of arbitrarily high degrees on the bulk of the string worldsheets : this is a hard task to carry out .",
    "situation can be more manageable to handle if the local weyl invariance is broken only on the boundaries of the worldsheets .    to date",
    "there are two proposals for off - shell string theory through deformation on the boundary of the string worldsheets .",
    "the one is the boundary string field theory ( bsft ) of witten @xcite on a unit disc and the other is the sigma model approach of open strings to the spacetime action @xmath0 .",
    "( see for example ref . @xcite and the references therein . ) to put simply , @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a partition function for a single string .",
    "the former proposal was successfully applied to the problem of open string tachyon condensation @xcite .",
    "it is well known that open strings alone do not serve as perturbatively stable system in flat spacetime @xcite .",
    "a possible next step common to these two approaches will be to extend the idea to the other worldsheet geometry which shares the same euler number as that of a disc , namely @xmath3 .",
    "this amounts to considering the string field theory of unoriented open and closed strings at least at the linearized level @xcite .",
    "this was considered and developed in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the above thoughts have also suggested that the off - shell extension of boundary states @xcite and that of crosscap states @xcite are an expedient tool and can be used in more general contexts . in particular , the computation of @xmath4 function is equivalent to the determination of the normalization of these states .",
    "( see refs . @xcite and the references therein . )",
    "bsft @xcite is defined on a disc worldsheet .",
    "let us consider an unit disc @xmath5 with worldsheet action i^disc = _ d^2 z x^ |x _ + _ ( ) , [ disc - action ] where @xmath6 is a generic scalar operator with ghost number @xmath7 let us consider the operator @xmath8 located on the boundary , where @xmath9 is the tangent component of the ghost field along the boundary .",
    "the defining differential equation for @xmath10 is written as & & tr ^ ( ) \\ { q_brs , o } ( ^ ) _ v , disc^ghost , + o ( ) & = & c^ ( ) v ( ) = _ _ c^ ( ) v^ ( ) = _ _ o^ ( ) , where @xmath11 denotes the trace over the chan - paton space .",
    "the brs charge @xmath12 corresponds to a fermionic vector field @xmath13 which is a basic ingredient of the formalism of bsft . here",
    "@xmath14 is the unnormalized path integral with respect to the worldsheet action ( [ disc - action ] ) , and can be represented as a matrix element @xmath15 .",
    "the bra vector @xmath16 obeys [ bcondition ] b .",
    "( ( z + |z ) x^ + ) |_z = e^i , |z= e^-i = 0 .",
    "we refer to @xmath17 as an off - shell boundary state ( obs ) of the disc .",
    "the condition ( [ bcondition ] ) is a consequence from the correspondence between the matrix element and the end point of the path integral .",
    "the latter one obeys the boundary condition derived from the worldsheet action @xmath18 on the disc .",
    "( [ bcondition ] ) tells us that , at the initial point of the coupling constant flow , the system obeys the neumann boundary condition , and the end point of the flow is described by zero of @xmath19 , namely the dirichlet boundary condition .",
    "we now proceed to construct the @xmath3 extension @xcite of bsft .",
    "@xmath3 is a non - orientable riemann surface of euler number one with no hole , no boundary and one crosscap .",
    "we construct the @xmath3 worldsheet on a complex @xmath20-plane by using an involution where we identify @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "we choose the fundamental region @xmath22 to be @xmath23 .",
    "the crosscap @xmath24 , the non - trivial closed loop of the @xmath3 worldsheet , is represented as half of unit circle @xmath25 in this case .",
    "let us consider the @xmath3 worldsheet with the following action : i^rp^2 = _",
    "^ -c d^2 z x^ | x _ + _ c ^ ( ) . [ rp2-action ] our first objective is to obtain the operator which corresponds to the fermionic vector field @xmath13 for the @xmath26 case .",
    "let us consider the following operator : @xmath27 where the subscript @xmath28 implies that the modes are restricted to the even ones .",
    "we can show that @xmath29 and @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the normal component of the ghost field along the loop .",
    "( @xmath32 is understood . )",
    "we also obtain @xmath33 .",
    "thus , the operator @xmath34 generates the brs transformations @xmath35 associated with the diffeomorphisms in the @xmath36 direction on @xmath32 .",
    "it is now immediate to carry out the action of @xmath34 on a generic operator with ghost number one .",
    "this also brings us an operator which is `` on - shell '' with respect to @xmath34 , that is , invariant under @xmath35 .",
    "let @xmath37 be a scalar operator with ghost number one , @xmath38 , where @xmath39 , @xmath40 are generic scalar relevant operators .",
    "we can show @xmath41 which is the condition we need in our formalism .    following the disc case ,",
    "we introduce a defining differential equation for @xmath42 & & _ c _ c ^ ( ) \\{q_brs^ ( ) , o } ( ^ ) _ v , rp^2^ghost + & = & 2 _ c _ c ( - ) c_1 c_0 c_-1 _ rp^2 f(, ) , where @xmath43 , @xmath44 .",
    "note that the allowed form of the nonvanishing ghost three point function has selected @xmath39 alone and @xmath40 has disappeared . here",
    "the unnormalized path integral @xmath45 is evaluated with respect to the action ( [ rp2-action ] ) , and can be represented as a matrix element between the ket vector of the closed string vacuum and the bra vector of the off - shell crosscap state ( ocs ) @xmath46 , namely @xmath47 .",
    "details of the ocs will be given in the next section .",
    "in this section , we consider the @xmath3 worldsheet with background dilaton field @xmath48 from the viewpoint of the sigma model approach @xcite .",
    "the basic idea of the sigma model approach is that the spacetime action for string fields is essentially the renormalized partition function of the worldsheet with corresponding background string fields . in the case of the disc for bosonic strings , for example , we need corrections of the disc partition function in order to subtract the divergence from the mbius infinity @xcite . however , the mbius group of @xmath3 is @xmath49 whose volume is finite , and we have no mbius infinity from the @xmath3 worldsheet .",
    "therefore it is natural to assume that the partition function of the @xmath3 worldsheet with background fields itself is the exact loop correction term from the @xmath3 graph in the presence of the quadratic background fields .    to begin with",
    ", we set the metric inside the unit circle ( @xmath50 ) on the complex plane as @xmath51 , @xmath52 .",
    "the metric outside the unit circle ( @xmath53 ) is obtained by the involution @xmath54 , @xmath55 as @xmath56 , where @xmath57 for @xmath58 .",
    "the worldsheet curvature @xmath59 is then given by @xmath60 , and we obtain @xmath61 here @xmath4 is the determinant of the worldsheet metric written in the polar coordinate @xmath62 .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ dilaton - rp2 ] ) gives the correct euler number of the @xmath26 ( which is one ) if we set @xmath63 .",
    "therefore the contribution of the background dilaton concentrates on the crosscap with the above gauge choice .",
    "let us consider the @xmath3 worldsheet @xmath22 with the following action : @xmath64 where @xmath65 .",
    "note that the worldsheet action is free in the  bulk \" region @xmath66 in this gauge choice .",
    "the aim of this subsection is to extend the on - shell crosscap conditions into the case @xmath67 .",
    "we should find , in other words , the constraints on the closed - string modes in the neighborhood of @xmath24 in the presence of interaction @xmath48 .",
    "we call these constraints off - shell crosscap conditions .",
    "we assert that the off - shell crosscap conditions can be written as @xmath68 where @xmath69 the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ k ] ) indicates the meaning of the off - shell crosscap conditions ; eq .",
    "( [ gen - cross - cond ] ) are the conditions so that the @xmath70 in the neighborhood of @xmath24 , as well as its image by the involution , connects smoothly with the @xmath70 on @xmath24 which obeys the equation of motion @xmath71 .",
    "has no boundary , @xmath72 which comes from the total derivative survives only on the crosscap due to the involution . ]",
    "the off - shell crosscap conditions ( [ gen - cross - cond ] ) are rewritten in terms of closed - string modes as @xmath73 where we do not sum over @xmath74 .",
    "we can easily check that the off - shell crosscap conditions interpolate between the usual on - shell crosscap conditions and their t - duals .",
    "we define ocs @xmath75 as @xmath76 , @xmath77 .",
    "the explicit form of @xmath75 is given as @xmath78 where @xmath79 , and @xmath80 .",
    "we can easily check that this ocs becomes ( the t - dual of ) the usual on - shell crosscap state if we take the limit @xmath81 ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "therefore the ocs naturally interpolates between the crosscap state for a higher - dimensional o - plane and that for a lower - dimensional o - plane . the coupling constant @xmath83 , which is a parameter of the configuration of the background dilaton field , controls the dimension of the corresponding o - plane .",
    "next , we show that the ocs is a useful tool to evaluate the quantities on the @xmath3 worldsheet . for example",
    ", we can calculate the green s function and the partition function on the @xmath3 worldsheet in the presence of interaction @xmath84 on the crosscap .",
    "let us consider one - dimensional target space and omit the superscript @xmath74 of @xmath85 and @xmath86 for simplicity .",

    "( [ def - x2 ] ) as @xmath94 by using a positive constant @xmath95 .",
    "the value for @xmath95 is ambiguous at this stage and depends on the renormalization scheme .",
    "we will determine the value for @xmath95 later .",
    "we can calculate the partition function of the @xmath3 worldsheet by using the relationship @xmath96 , and then we obtain @xmath97 up to the overall normalization factor . in general , the partition function for 26-dimensional target space with @xmath65 on the crosscap can be written as @xmath98 up to the overall normalization factor .",
    "obs s are useful tools for analyses of two - dimensional systems with boundaries . in the case",
    "the boundary interaction is quadratic , the proper form of the green s function and the @xmath4-function has been given by using obs @xcite . in the determination of the @xmath4-function which is defined as @xmath99 , the overall normalization of the obs is crucial .",
    "the normalization can be fixed by computing the partition function of the cylinder worldsheet , @xmath100 , and demanding @xmath101 , without taking the long cylinder limit @xcite . here",
    "@xmath102 is the hamiltonian on the cylinder of length @xmath103 , and @xmath104 and @xmath105 indicate the boundaries .",
    "the left - hand side is calculated via path integral with @xmath106-function regularization .",
    "for example , the @xmath4-function for bosonic theory ( [ disc - action ] ) with the quadratic boundary interaction @xmath107 is given by @xmath108 for supersymmetric extension with boundary mass , the fermionic sector gives @xmath109 which agree with the results of refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the descent relation among o - plane tensions can be also derived by using the result of sec .",
    "[ rp2 ] @xcite .",
    "let us define quantity @xmath110 as @xmath111 , where the limit is taken as @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",

    "then we can write @xmath120 we find @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the zero mode of @xmath123 and we have correctly extracted the integral of the zero - mode part of @xmath124 @xcite .",
    "here we have assigned the value 2 to @xmath95 because we can obtain a finite and non - zero value of @xmath125 in the limit @xmath126 if and only if @xmath127 .",
    "in other words , we have chosen the renormalization scheme in eq .",
    "( [ def - x2 ] ) so that we obtain a finite and non - zero value of @xmath125 in the limit @xmath126 .",
    "we therefore obtain @xmath128 this is precisely the ratio of the tension of an o@xmath129-plane and that of an o@xmath130-plane . in general",

    "off - shell crosscap states as well as off - shell boundary states are useful tools both for formulating off - shell theory ( worldsheet string field theory or off - shell non - linear sigma model ) of unoriented open and closed strings , and for performing computation .    in configuration space of strings ,",
    "interpolations of o - planes of various dimensions are certainly possible as are in d - branes , and the dilaton background is responsible for this .",
