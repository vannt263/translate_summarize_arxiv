    "an electromagnetic wave reflected off a moving mirror undergoes frequency multiplication and corresponding increase in the electric field magnitude .",
    "this phenomenon sometimes called the double doppler effect was discussed by a. einstein in his seminal paper @xcite where the frequency multiplication factor was calculated as an example of the use of lorentz transformations .",
    "the multiplication factor is approximately proportional to the square of the lorentz factor of the mirror , making this effect an attractive basis for a source of powerful high - frequency radiation . in relativistic plasma ,",
    "the double doppler effect manifests itself when a fast change of the electric current density leads to the conversion of an incident light into strongly compressed pulses of high - frequency electromagnetic radiation .",
    "pulse compression and frequency upshifting can be seen in a broad variety of configurations , @xcite .",
    "a specular reflection can be afforded by a sufficiently dense relativistic electron cloud as suggested in refs .",
    "@xcite ; a less dense bunch of relativistic electrons causes the backward thomson scattering as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite . the reflection at the moving ionization fronts was studied in refs .",
    "further examples of the manifestation of the double doppler effect in plasma whose dynamics is governed by the strong collective fields are seen in the concepts of the sliding mirror @xcite , oscillating mirror @xcite and flying mirror @xcite which can produce ultra - short pulses of xuv radiation and x - ray .",
    "the sliding mirror is formed by a thin foil whose density is so high that the electrons are confined whithin the boundaries of the ion layer .",
    "irradiated by a relativistically strong laser pulse , which is not capable to quickly break the confinement condition , these electrons perform nonlinear motion along the foil , enriching the ( partially ) reflected radiaiton ( as well as transmitted radiation ) with high harmonics , @xcite . in a less dense foil",
    "the electrons can perform collective motion in the direction perpendicular to the foil , thus forming a mirror oscillating with relativistic velocity . a portion of an incident relativistically strong electromagnetic wave , driving the oscillating mirror , is reflected in the form of strongly distorted wave carrying high harmonics , @xcite .    in the flying mirror concept @xcite ,",
    "the role of the mirror is played by the electron density modulations in a strongly nonlinear langmuir wave excited by an intense laser pulse ( driver ) in its wake in underdense plasma .",
    "a relatively weak counter - propagating electromagnetic wave ( source ) is ( partially ) reflected at these modulations moving with the velocity equal to the group velocity of the driving laser pulse .",
    "in addition , due to a finite waist of the driver pulse , the electron density modulations take a paraboloidal shape @xcite , and hence focus the reflected radiation ( signal ) .",
    "the most efficient reflection is afforded by a breaking wake wave , where the caustics of the plasma flow are formed and correspondingly the electron density becomes formally singular .",
    "the reflection coefficient is calculated in @xcite for a broad class of caustics . for the case of the breaking langmuir wave ,",
    "the reflection efficiency is high enough to acess , with present - day technology , the quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) critical field in the focus of the reflected signal @xcite .",
    "here we discuss a novel scheme of the flying mirror , the accelerating double - sided mirror , which can efficiently reflect the counter - propagating relativistically strong electromagnetic radiation .",
    "the role of the mirror is played by a high - density plasma slab which is accelerated as a whole by an ultra - intense laser pulse ( the driver ) in the radiation pressure dominant ( rpd ) regime ( synonymous to the laser piston regime ) , @xcite .",
    "such an acceleration can be described as the mirroring effect : it is the reflection that allows the energy transfer from the driver radiation to the co - propagating plasma slab .",
    "this effect is inverse with respect to the double doppler effect .",
    "this plasma slab also acts as a mirror for a counter - propagating relativistically strong electromagnetic radiation ( the source ) . as such it exhibits the properties of the sliding and oscillating mirrors , producing high harmonics . as a result , in the spectrum of the reflected radiation both the fundamental frequency of the incident radiation and all the high harmonics",
    "are multiplied by the same factor , approximately proportional to the square of the lorentz factor of the mirror .",
    "this concept opens the way towards extremely bright sources of ultrashort energetic bursts of x - ray and gamma - ray , which become realizable with present - day technology .    in the next sections we recall some aspects of the flying mirror concept",
    ", then we present the scheme of the accelerating mirror and corresponding computer simulations .",
    "finally , we discuss the prospects of the proposed concept .",
    "the factor by which the frequency of the reflected electromagnetic radiation is multiplied in the double doppler effect can be derived using simple geometric arguments , as shown in fig .",

    "the world line is stright and is inclined at the angle of @xmath4 ( clockwise ) with respect to the @xmath5-axis .",
    "the world line of a counter - propagating pulse is inclined at the angle of @xmath6 .",
    "the world line of a mirror , moving with a constant velocity , @xmath7 , in the direction of the @xmath1-axis , is also stright , but inclined at the angle of @xmath8 . in principle , the mirror velocity can be equal or greater than the speed of light in vacuum , e.  g. , when the mirror is formed by an ionization front in plasma , @xcite . in fig .",

    "however , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : mirror ] , the wave reflected by a superluminal mirror is reversed in time .",

    "the interaction is described by the maxwell equation : @xmath46where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the electron charge and mass , @xmath49 is the lorentz factor of the plasma slab .",
    "we consider a thin slab approximation , where the slab thickness tends to zero , @xmath50 , while the total number of particles in the slab is constant , @xmath51 .",

    "this approximation was used in ref .",
    "@xcite for calculating the reflection coefficient of the breaking wake wave , basing on the argument that in each period of the wake wave near breaking , nearly half of the electrons are concentrated in the spike of the electron density moving with the phase velocity of the wake , whereas another half are distributed almost homogeneously and moving in the opposite direction with the same velocity .    in the boosted reference frame , moving with the velocity of the plasma slab , the electromagnetic wave is interacting with an infinitely thin wall at rest .",
    "this allows us to use the analogy with the classical problem of the scattering theory ( e.g. , see refs . @xcite and @xcite ) . for the boosted frame",

    "a plasma slab moving with relativistic velocity can be created in the radiation pressure dominant ( rpd ) regime of the ion acceleration ( also called the laser piston regime ) , @xcite . in this regime",
    "an ultra - intense electromagnetic wave ( driver ) incident on a thin dense foil efficiently accelerates the irradiated region of the foil as a whole due to a strong radiation pressure and high reflectivity of the foil , fig .",

    "in this paper we show that a solid density plasma slab , accelerated in the radiation pressure dominant regime , can efficiently reflect a counter - propagating relativistically strong laser pulse ( source ) , thus playing a role of accelerating mirror . the reflected electromagnetic radiation consists of the reflected fundamental mode and high harmonics ,",
    "all multiplied by the factor @xmath125 , where @xmath7 is the increasing velocity of the plasma slab and @xmath94 is the corresponding lorentz factor . in general",

    ", the distance between electrons in the plasma slab in the proper reference frame becomes longer than the incident wavelength .",

    "the reflected radiation becomes linearly proportional to the number of particles .",
