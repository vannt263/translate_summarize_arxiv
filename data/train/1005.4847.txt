    "during the last couple of years or so a number of monte - carlo ( mc ) algorithms have been proposed which directly determine the density of states ( dos ) of a system .",
    "one of these is the transition matrix monte carlo ( tmmc ) algorithm developed by oliveria _",
    "et al _ @xcite and subsequently generalized by wang and co - workers @xcite .",
    "in this algorithm , during a random walk in the energy space , one keeps a record of the transitions between the microstates of the system .",
    "the entire history of the transitions is then used to obtain the density of states of the system .",
    "more recently wang and landau @xcite proposed another algorithm which goes by their name ( wl ) and has drawn wide attention of investigators . this algorithm employs a method of flat histograms , while a random walk is performed in the energy space and estimates the dos of the system by using an iterative scheme . both methods , the tmmc and wl , depend on broad sampling of the phase space and are easy to implement .",
    "a knowledge of the dos of a system as a function of energy , @xmath0 enables one to calculate the partition function @xmath1 by a simple boltzmann reweighting : @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the inverse temperature @xmath4 . with a knowledge of the partition function",
    "one can calculate the averages of thermodynamic quantities which are directly related to energy .",
    "it has been established that while the tmmc method gives more accurate estimation of the dos , the wl algorithm is more efficient in sampling the phase space .",
    "+ shell _ et al _ proposed @xcite an algorithm which is an amalgamation of the two algorithms and utilizes the benefits of each .",
    "this algorithm , now known as the wang landau transition matrix ( wltm ) monte carlo algorithm , is at the same time efficient and accurate .",
    "et al _ applied the algorithm to a two - dimensional ising model and a lennard - jones fluid .",
    "more recently ghulghazarya _ et al _ @xcite have applied this method to simulate protein and peptide .",
    "+ the sampling of the phase space which is done in each of the above methods need not be restricted to the evaluation of the density of states as a function of energy alone .",
    "one can determine the dos or to be more specific , the joint density of states ( jdos ) with a substantially more book - keeping .",
    "the jdos @xmath5 is a function of some variable @xmath6 ( which can be an order parameter , spin - spin correlation or any other observable ) besides the energy @xmath7 .",
    "this partition function is determined from : @xmath8 .",
    "the ensemble average of any function of @xmath6 at an inverse temperature @xmath3 is then given by @xmath9 most of the investigators have so far worked on the determination of dos or jdos in discrete systems using the three above mention algorithms @xcite . even in this domain",
    "the amount of work reported on the determination of jdos is relatively small . in an earlier paper @xcite we have reported on the working of wltm in two continuous lattice - spin models .",
    "while the discrete systems like ising or potts model can be handled in a straight forward manner , the investigation of continuous systems are more tedious .",
    "the range of energy ( and another observable in case of two - dimensional random walk ) needs to be discretized and several parameters appear which are to be chosen properly for the determination of dos or jdos . in the present communication",
    "we report the determination of jdos using the wltm algorithm in two continuous lattice spin models .",
    "the quantities evaluated other than energy and specific heat are the order parameter , susceptibility and correlation function .",
    "one of the models is the one - dimensional lebwohl - lasher model @xcite , which is exactly solvable @xcite and therefore allows us to check the accuracy of the results of our simulation .",
    "the other system is the two - dimensional xy - model where exact solutions are not available and we have compared the results with those obtained from the jdos determined using the wl algorithm .",
    "the aim of the present work is to test the feasibility of the determination of jdos in continuous models using the wltm algorithm .",
    "this turned out to be a some what difficult task as a formidable amount of computer memory is necessary even for systems of moderate size .",
    "we outline below the method of determination of the jdos , @xmath5 using the wl algorithm . in a system where @xmath7 and @xmath6 are continuous variables , discretization in required to label the macrostates of the system .",
    "the ranges of @xmath7 and @xmath6 are divided into a large number of bins of width @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively .",
    "let @xmath12 and @xmath13 be the mean energy and mean order parameter ( or correlation function ) corresponding to the @xmath14 bin of energy and the @xmath15 bin of the order parameter ( correlation function ) respectively .",
    "then @xmath16 denotes the number of microstates of the system having energy @xmath12 and order parameter ( correlation function ) @xmath13 or simply the degeneracy of the macrostate @xmath17 .",
    "since @xmath16 is a very large number , it is convenient to work with its natural logarithm and we use @xmath18 .",
    "+ we perform two dimensional random walk in the @xmath19 space .",
    "initially we do not have any knowledge of @xmath20 , and set @xmath21 for all values of @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "also , an histogram count @xmath24 of the states visited during the random walk is maintained .",
    "the wl algorithm generates the jdos profile , which progressively approaches the actual density of states of the system .",
    "the algorithm starts with some microstate of the system and successive microstates are generated by rotating one spin at a time .",
    "let @xmath17 and @xmath25 be the macrostates before and after rotating the spin and the corresponding microstates are @xmath26 and @xmath27 , where @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the transition probability from state @xmath26 to @xmath27 is given by @xmath30 thus the acceptance probability of the new state is inversely proportional to the current density of states .",
    "when the new state is accepted the density of states @xmath31 and the histogram count @xmath32 of the state @xmath25 are modified as    @xmath33    @xmath34    and when the new state is not accepted the old density of state @xmath20 and histogram count @xmath24 are modified as    @xmath35    @xmath36    here @xmath37 is a modification factor whose initial value was chosen to be equal to @xmath38 .",
    "when the histogram is sufficiently flat ( say , 80% ) i.e. , histogram count @xmath24 of each bin @xmath17 is at least @xmath39 of the mean histogram @xmath40 , @xmath41 being the total number of bins then one iteration is said to be complete . then the histogram is reset to zero for all values of @xmath22 and @xmath23 and the modification factor @xmath37",
    "is reduced in some prescribed manner ( we use @xmath42 ) .",
    "a fresh iteration is started with the modified value of @xmath43 and the old values of @xmath44 which were calculated in the previous iteration .",
    "one continues iterations with the same procedure until the modification factor becomes sufficiently small ( say , @xmath45 ) .",
    "the error introduced in the joint density of states has been predicted to be proportional to @xmath46 as is apparent from the theoretical work of zhou and bhatt @xcite .",
    "this has been tested for a number of discrete and continuous models and the prediction has been found to be correct @xcite . +      the tmmc algorithm is an efficient algorithm in which one directly calculates the density of states and was first proposed by oliveria et al . in the year 1996 . if the transition probability from a microstate @xmath26 to another microstate @xmath27 is @xmath47 and that from a macrostate @xmath17 to a macrostate @xmath25 is @xmath48 then @xmath49 with the following conditions :    @xmath50    @xmath51    if @xmath52 be the reverse transition then one can write    @xmath53    the transition probability @xmath47 actually is a product of two probabilities , @xmath54 here @xmath55 is the probability of the move @xmath56 being proposed and depends on the type of the monte carlo moves and while @xmath57 is the probability of proposed move being accepted and depends on the configurations @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "one can choose any value of @xmath58 and an infinite temperature transition probability @xmath59 can be chosen for which @xmath60 for all i , j and k , l .",
    "this is particularly easy to understand if one considers the metropolis algorithm at infinite temperature",
    ". this process does not affect the jdos to be determined since it is independent of temperature . using equations ( [ tmr1 ] ) and ( [ tap ] ) we can write : @xmath61 again for symmetric moves ( single spin flip dynamics ) @xmath62 and the summation terms on right hand side of equation ( [ tmr2 ] ) drops out and the equation can be simplified as    @xmath63    this equation relates the jdos with the infinite temperature transition probabilities .",
    "thus from the knowledge of infinite temperature transition probabilities one can estimate the jdos .",
    "now , one needs to calculate @xmath64(i , j;k , l ) which can be done by keeping a record of moves in the form of a matrix , called c - matrix , @xmath65 for all proposals @xmath66 , during the random walk .",
    "initially , we set @xmath67 for all i , j and k , l .",
    "at infinite temperature all the proposed moves are accepted so whenever a move is proposed we update the c - matrix as @xmath68 once the construction of c - matrix is started we never reset it to zero , because the c - matrix keeps the detail history of the transitions in the system .",
    "the current estimate of the infinite temperature transition probability ( @xmath69 ) is @xmath70 where the sum extends over all @xmath71 and @xmath72 and the tilde indicates the estimate . from equation ( [ tw ] ) and ( [ tes ] ) one can determine the joint density of states .",
    "but the equation ( [ tw ] ) is an over specified problem since for a system with @xmath73 macrostate having @xmath73 unknown quantities @xmath74 there are @xmath75 such equations . to calculate @xmath74",
    "one needs to minimize the total variance @xmath76 ^ 2}{\\sigma^{2}_{ijkl } } } } % \\sigma^2_{tot}=\\sum_{i , j;k , l}{\\displaystyle { \\frac{[s(i , j)-s(k , l)+ % ln ( \\widetilde{t}_{\\infty}(i , j;k , l)/\\widetilde{t}_{\\infty}(k , l;i , j))]^2}{\\sigma^{2}_{ijkl}}}}\\ ] ] with @xmath77 here we have used @xmath78 and @xmath79 . in order to ensure that the random walker visits all macrostates in the region of interest one considers a uniform ensemble , where all macrostates are equally probable .",
    "the probability of occurrence of a given microstate @xmath26 is therefore proportional to the multiplicity of the macrostate @xmath17 where @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "so the probability of acceptance of a move @xmath82 is given by @xmath83 since the jdos are not known a priori , the acceptance criteria can be written as @xmath84    where we have used equation ( [ tw ] ) so using the above acceptance probability together with equation ( [ tw ] ) and minimizing the total variance as discussed above , one can generate the profile of the joint density of states .",
    "the tmmc algorithm gives accurate value of jdos since it stores and uses the entire history of the transitions during the random walk .",
    "but this method has a drawback that the convergence is not guaranteed and a significant amount of cpu time is necessary . on the other hand",
    "the wl method ensures that all the macrostates are visited rather efficiently and more quickly .",
    "as proposed by shell and co - workers @xcite in the wltm method we combine the tmmc and wl algorithms in order to get the benefit of both the algorithms .",
    "this is discusses in the next section .",
    "+      in the wltm algorithm , one efficiently combines the wl and tm monte carlo algorithms . in this algorithm ,",
    "the phase space is sampled via the acceptance criteria given by equation ( [ apw ] ) as in the wl method .",
    "also @xmath20 and @xmath24 are updated in the same fashion as in the wl algorithm and in addition of these , a record of transitions between macrostates is kept in a c - matrix , which is never zeroed during the simulation . at the end of the simulation , from the knowledge of the c - matrix and using equation ( [ tw ] ) the joint density of states",
    "is determined by minimizing the total variance .",
    "we have determined the jdos and other thermodynamic quantities such as energy , specific heat , order parameter , correlation function etc . performing two dimensional random walk in @xmath85 space using wl and wltm algorithms for two continuous lattice spin models .",
    "we give below a brief description of the models and the related quantities we have measured . +      this model is a linear array of three dimensional spins @xmath86 interacting with nearest neighbors via the a potential @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the second legendre polynomial and @xmath89 is the angle between two nearest neighbor spins @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "spins are headless , i.e. it has o(3 ) as well as @xmath92 symmetry .",
    "this model represents one dimensional nematic liquid crystal and does not exhibit any finite temperature order disorder phase transition . +",
    "the order parameter is a quantity which describes the amount of order prevailing in a system . since in a nematic phase",
    "the ordering is the orientational , the order parameter quantifies the amount of orientational order present in the system . in a nematic liquid crystal",
    "the molecules are on the average aligned along a particular direction @xmath93 called the director .",
    "these molecules in general have equal probability of pointing parallel and anti - parallel to any given direction .",
    "if @xmath94 is the direction of a molecular axis of a molecule situated at position @xmath95 then @xmath96 have equal contribution as that of @xmath97 towards the order parameter .",
    "so a vector order parameter is inadequate for the system and a symmetric traceless tensor is used as the order parameter .",
    "this tensor is chosen in such a way that it is zero in the high temperature isotropic phase and is unity in the fully ordered phase .",
    "the order parameter tensor is given as @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the @xmath100 component of the unit vector @xmath101 , which points along the spin at position * x = a*. @xmath73 is the number of molecules in the system .",
    "the order @xmath102 prevailing in the system can be written as @xmath103 the second rank spin - spin correlation function @xmath104 is defined as @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the angle between two spins separated by @xmath107 lattice spacing @xmath107 .",
    "the order parameter @xmath108 and @xmath109 should vanish in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "however due to the finite size effect in systems of finite size both quantities have some small non zero value .",
    "the exact expression for the correlation function is given by @xcite @xmath110^r\\ ] ] where @xmath111 .",

    "the xy - model has also been the subject of extensive mc simulation over last few decades and some of the recent results may be found in @xcite .",
    "+ in this model , the orientational order parameter is defined as follows : let @xmath93 be the unit vector ( called the director ) in the direction of maximum order prevailing in the system and @xmath117 be the spin vector of unit magnitude then the order parameter @xmath108 is given by @xmath118 where @xmath6 is the angle between the director and the spin . the spin- spin correlation function for the 2d - xy model",
    "is defined as @xmath119 where @xmath106 is the angle between two spins separated by @xmath107 lattice spacing .",
    "two dimensional random walk has been performed in @xmath120 and @xmath121 space for one dimensional lebwohl - lasher model and two dimensional xy model .",
    "since both of these models are continuous , we discretize the system by dividing the whole energy range as well as the order parameter ( or correlation function ) range into a number of bins having widths @xmath10 and @xmath122 respectively .",
    "we simulated 2d xy system for lattice sizes @xmath123 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 and @xmath126 and 1d ll system for lattice sizes @xmath127 , @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "the 2d xy system can have energy between @xmath130 and @xmath131 but we simulated the system for the energy range @xmath132 to @xmath131 to avoid trapping of the random walker in low energy states as these are scarcely visited during the simulation .",
    "similarly the 1d ll system can have energy between @xmath133 and @xmath134 but we simulated the system for the energy range @xmath133 , @xmath130 with a small energy cut near the ground state .",

    "we have taken a random initial configuration and a new configuration is generated by rotating any one of the spins randomly using the prescription @xmath140 ( for i=1,2,3 ) , where @xmath141 is a random number between -1 and 1 . in the 2d xy model , each spin",
    "is specified by two direction cosines and new configurations are generated by rotating the spin in the same manner as above .",
    "initially , we do not have any prior knowledge about the dos , so we set @xmath21 for all values of the macrostates @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "a new microstate @xmath27 is generated from the old one @xmath26 by rotating one spin at a time and the acceptance probability @xmath142 is given by equation ( [ aprob ] ) .",
    "when the new state lies in the same macrostate as the old one the state is accepted .",
    "a histogram count is recorded in an array @xmath24 and whenever a state is proposed we update the c - matrix as @xmath143 .",
    "the random walk is continued till the histogram becomes flat ( say @xmath39 ) .",
    "we point out that in the case of 2-d random walk all the bins are not visited uniformly as this would need an enormous number of monte carlo sweeps ( mcs ) .",
    "we first sampled the system for about @xmath144 mcs which is called the pre - production run. during the pre - production run we marked by @xmath145 the bins which are visited at least @xmath39 of its average value and by @xmath146 those which are visited less than @xmath39 of the average value or are not visited at all . during the production run we checked the histogram flatness only for those bins which were marked @xmath145 .",
    "the average histogram is calculated by considering only those bins which are visited at least once discarding the bins which are not visited at all .",
    "some bins marked @xmath146 may qualify for the mark @xmath145 during the production runs .",
    "when the histogram gets flat the modification factor is changed as @xmath42 and the histogram count is reset to zero but the c - matrix is never reset to zero . the iteration is continued with the new modification factor and the same procedure is repeated until the modification factor becomes as small as @xmath147 for ll model and @xmath148 for xy model . at the end of the simulation the jdos is calculated from the knowledge of the c - matrix by minimizing the variance in equation ( [ var ] ) .",
    "this variance is minimized using the dowhill - simplex method @xcite .",
    "it may be noted that for the continuous system there are a large number of macrostates @xmath22 and @xmath23 . as a result , the number of elements in the four dimensional c - matrix is enormously large . to simulate the system a huge amount of computer storage ( ram ) is required which is beyond of our computer resources .",
    "but most of the elements of c - matrix are zero since a transition from a given macrostate @xmath17 to all macrostates @xmath25 is not possible . in general it is found that for the transition @xmath66 , the possible nonzero values of @xmath71 and @xmath72 lie within the range @xmath149 to @xmath150 and @xmath151 to @xmath152 respectively , where @xmath153 and @xmath154 are integers .",
    "some extra conditions are imposed for the low values of @xmath22 and @xmath23 . in our case",
    "the values of @xmath153 and @xmath154 are 5 and 1 respectively .",
    "so to avoid the problem with storage we transformed @xmath71 to @xmath155 and @xmath72 to @xmath156 and whenever the original values of @xmath71 and @xmath72 are necessary we make the reverse transformations .",
    "+ the jdos is obtained by minimizing the variance using the downhill simplex method @xcite .",
    "the variance is a function of more than one independent variable ; in fact it is a function of a large number of independent variables .",
    "it is also very difficult to minimize the multivariable function of such a large number of unknown variables using this method .",
    "for example , to minimize a function of @xmath73 variables ( which constitutes a point in an n - dimensional space ) it requires @xmath157 points in that space .",
    "one of these points is chosen as the starting point @xmath158 and other points are obtained by @xmath159 , where @xmath160 is a constant and is taken to be @xmath161 of the value of @xmath158 , and the @xmath162 s are @xmath73 unit vectors . in this method we need a two dimensional matrix ( @xmath163 ) of extents @xmath157 and @xmath73 . for a continuous model ,",

    "+ the correlation function @xmath199 has been plotted against temperature with @xmath107 , the spacing between spins , in figure 5 for lattice size l=80 and 15 different values of @xmath107 ranging from @xmath176 to @xmath186 .",
    "all data are obtained from 2-d random walk in @xmath121 space using both wl and wltm algorithms .",
    "it may be noted that , we had to run one simulation for each value of @xmath107 .",
    "with increase in temperature , the correlation between spins for a given value of @xmath107 decreases .",
    "again @xmath199 is plotted as a function of lattice spacing @xmath107 for seven different temperatures in figure 6 .",
    "@xmath199 decreases very rapidly with lattice spacing _",
    "i.e. _ spins which are a large distance apart are uncorrelated .",
    "this is expected since in the thermodynamic limit , @xmath200 .",
    "the finite values of correlation function that appears in the figures is due to the finite size effect .",
    "+      in this model the simulation has been carried out for lattice sizes @xmath201 , @xmath188 , @xmath189 and @xmath202 using both wl and wltm algorithms .",
    "two dimensional random walk in two different spaces ( @xmath120 and @xmath121 ) was performed to determine the order parameter , susceptibility and correlation function apart from average energy , specific heat etc which can be determined using 1-d random walk .",
    "the minimum energy for all lattice sizes was @xmath193 .",
    "the upper limit of energies of these system sizes over which the simulation has been carried out were @xmath203 , @xmath204 , @xmath205 and @xmath206 .",
    "we deleted a small region at the lower end of energy to overcome the trapping of the random walker .",
    "the order parameter ( correlation function ) can have values between @xmath130 and @xmath192 ( @xmath207 and @xmath208 ) .",
    "the whole energy and order parameter ( correlation function ) range is divided into a large number of bins of width @xmath209 and @xmath210 respectively .",
    "+ in figure 7 , the density of states obtained from the 2-d random walk for 2-d xy model for different lattice sizes have been plotted against the energy per particle .",
    "we have used both wl and wltm algorithms to obtain the data presented in figure 7 .",
    "the order parameter ( @xmath198 ) for 2-d xy model of linear lattice sizes @xmath123 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 and @xmath126 are plotted with temperature in figure 8 .",
    "the system is known to possess no true long range order and a quasi - long - range - order disorder transition takes place due to unbinding of topological defects .",
    "susceptibility of 2d xy model is also plotted as a function of temperature for four lattice sizes in figure 9 .",
    "it is observed that the height of the susceptibility peak increases with the increase of system sizes and also the position of susceptibility peak is shifted towards the lower temperature with the increase of system size . in figure 10 we have plotted the correlation function @xmath199 against temperature for ten values of @xmath107 for the xy - model .",
    "these were obtained from the jdos computed by using wl and wltm methods .",
    "the same data is depicted in a different way in figure 10 , where we have plotted @xmath211 against @xmath107 for eight different values of temperature .",
    "we have presented the results of monte carlo simulation performed in the 1-d ll model and 2-d xy - model for the evaluation of joint density of states using the wl and wltm algorithms .",
    "agreement of the statistical averages of different quantities obtained by using the two algorithms is excellent .",
    "calculation of jdos for continuous spin models has been done earlier @xcite .",
    "we have demonstrated in this work that , although computationally tedious , it is possible to use the wltm method for the evaluation of the jdos for a continuous spin model .",
    "this method may prove to be useful for future researchers who will need to generate the jdos in a discrete or coninuous spin model .",
