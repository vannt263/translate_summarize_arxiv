    "highly successful and experimentally verified standard model of the electroweak interactions has still one crucial particle undiscovered  the higgs boson .",
    "it is of great importance to estimate even possible range of the higgs - boson mass for two main reasons .",
    "firstly , the experimental methods that should be used for the discovery depend on the mass of the higgs boson . secondly , narrowing the possible ranges of the higgs boson mass may exclude certain models describing physics beyond the standard model .",
    "current direct experimental bound based on the lep2 data  @xcite is @xmath2 for the standard model higgs boson .",
    "in addition there exists the upper limit based from the indirect precision electroweak data  @xcite @xmath3 at 95 %  c.l .. yet for many of the extensions of the standard model these limits are much looser .",
    "in addition to these experimental limits there exist additional ones based on the theoretical arguments  so called triviality and vacuum stability bounds .    the triviality bound originates from the fact first described in the work by wilson  @xcite .",
    "it states that in the renormalizable theory containing massive scalar field the strength of the quartic self - interaction term reaches infinity at some scale @xmath4  and the stronger the interaction , the lower the scale at which it happens . as a consequence ",
    "the requirement of validity up to given scale bounds the size of the coupling from above what directly translates into the bound for the higgs boson mass .",
    "the only theory valid at all scales is the trivial one  with no quartic self - interaction , which is reflected in the name of this bound . since in practical terms the couplings have to be at most of the order of one in order for the theory to remain perturbative , we demand that up to some scale the coupling is smaller than some arbitrary value .",
    "we call this operational definition of the triviality condition",
    ". one should have in mind that violating this condition does not exclude the theory completely  it just means that the theory loses its predictivity , which may disfavors it against other , more predictive theories .",
    "it was noted by cabibbo  @xcite that quantum corrections may destabilize the electroweak potential leading to minimum in the wrong place , additional minimum or no minimum at all . with @xmath5 being proportional to the curvature of the potential at the minimum the vacuum is less stable for lower @xmath5 .",
    "thus the requirement for the correct vacuum structure leads to lower bound on the higgs boson mass .",
    "this talk is based on our work in which we established these bounds in the presence of the general high energy interactions described in terms of the effective lagrangian . for more detailed description of topics discussed here",
    "see the original publication  @xcite .",
    "the effective lagrangian method has been widely used in the past  @xcite .",
    "we followed the approach and conventions of buechmueller and wyler  @xcite . in the effective lagrangian method",
    "low - energy effects of the unknown high - energy physics are described in terms of the set of additional , non - renormalizable operators that are added to the original lagrangian .",
    "_ = l_0 + 1_1 + 1 ^ 2l_2 the operators are suppressed by the power of the scale of new physics @xmath6 . as terms contributing to @xmath7",
    "violate either lepton or baryon number ",
    "they are strongly constrained by experiment .",
    "hence we will limit ourselves to 81 independent operators of dimensions 6 constituting @xmath8 . _ 2 = _",
    "i_i o_i out of these , if just third generation fermions are taken into account , only 16 can be generated at the tree - level by the unknown , high - energy physics described by weakly coupled gauge theory . among these 16 only 5 listed below contribute directly to effective potential while 11 only through rg - mixing .",
    "* @xmath9 * @xmath10 * @xmath11 * @xmath12 * @xmath13    in addition to the above operators we have included one of the the remaining 11 : @xmath14 in order to estimate the importance of the mixing .",
    "the effective potential obtained after inclusion of these operators has the following form : @xmath15 ,   \\non\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with coefficients @xmath16 for @xmath17 respectively where @xmath18 .",

    "as both triviality and stability conditions are checked at various energy scales it is crucial to implement the renormalization group equation ( rge ) evolution for the couplings used .",
    "the full set of the rge running equations was presented in the earlier papers :  @xcite . here",

    "as one can see the dominant terms in the @xmath21 evolution are those related to the quartic scalar self - coupling and to the top quark yukawa coupling , so the impact of the 6-dim operators is expected to be small .",
    "on the other hand , for @xmath22 , for small and moderate @xmath21 the dominant terms are those proportional to @xmath22 and @xmath25 .",
    "yet it would be beneficial to check these hypothesis in detail .",
    "in this study we have included the basic tests against the precision electroweak observables . since only large ,",
    "tree - level generated operators have been included , it was enough to calculate only one - loop electroweak corrections .",
    "we limited our study to the observables that are relatively independent and are measured with sufficient precision : @xmath26 .",
    "for each tested point we demanded that combined @xmath27 .",

    "for @xmath31tev the only problematic region was one with large @xmath21 but even then the consistency with ew data could be obtained by allowing moderate changes in the coupling constants .    as our test models we chose models with @xmath32 ( i=1 .. 6 ) giving 64 different combinations of signs and employed the following algorithm :    1 .",

    "the condition t1 is the classic triviality condition .",
    "the condition t2 is its natural generalization for @xmath33 .",
    "the condition t3 demands that corrections from new physics are not too large so the whole procedure remains perturbative .",
    "one should remember that the conditions t2 and t3 are not triviality conditions in the strict sense but they are very similar to the operational definition of the triviality condition as they demand that given couplings are small enough for the theory to be consistent . in addition , the borders for all triviality conditions are fuzzy as the limit for the size of the couplings is arbitrary . the results for t1 have been plotted on fig .",
    "[ triv - only - plot ] . there is no significant departure from the sm limit as all 65 ( 64+the sm ) curves are very close to each other .",

    "as it was expected , the dominant role is played by @xmath22 .",
    "the positive sign destabilizes the potential while the negative sign stabilizes it . in spite of the complicated nature of the analysis performed here",
    ", it is worth to trace the way in which @xmath53 could influence the lower limit on the higgs - boson mass .",
    "the key point is the fact that @xmath54 modify the relation between the top - quark mass and its yukawa coupling .",
    "another mechanism of enhancing the contribution from @xmath54 is the very large numerical factor in front of @xmath53 in the evolution equation of @xmath55 . because of this a larger @xmath56 amplifies the evolution of @xmath55 thereby requiring a larger @xmath5 .",
    "both effects combine leading to the dependence on @xmath53 illustrated in fig.[stab - only - plot ] .",
    "it is worth noticing that @xmath57 whenever the effective operator @xmath58 is generated through the tree - level exchange of a heavy scalar isodoublet in the fundamental high - scale theory .    , and the lower ( red ) ones for @xmath59 .",
    "for each color the higher branches correspond to @xmath60 while lower for @xmath61 . ]                finally for each of the 64 analyzed models we applied all conditions combined .",
    "we present here figures for 3 representative cases with the @xmath33 signs as written on the figures .",
    "the upper and lower borders of the colored regions are triviality t1 and stability bounds as plotted on the previous figures .",
    "the black color regions , labeled t2 t3 , are such that both conditions are satisfied ; red areas , labeled @xmath62 t3 , represent the regions where t3 is satisfied but t2 is not ; green areas , labeled t2 @xmath63 , represent the regions where t2 is satisfied but t3 is not ; and blue areas , labeled @xmath62 @xmath63 , represent the regions where neither t2 nor t3 are satisfied . the conditions t2 and t3 seem to be quite strong and exclude a significant part of the parameters space .",
    "the violation of t2 is always due to @xmath55 or @xmath53 . for large ( small ) @xmath5 condition",
    "t2 is always stronger(weaker ) than t3 what can be deducted from the definitions of t2 and t3 . on all of the plots condition",
    "t3 bounds from below as it is expected while t2 bound can be from above or from both sides .",
    "we have also found that for @xmath64 and @xmath65 both t2 and t3 are violated in the whole parameter space .",
    "however , we would like to emphasize again that the bounds are fuzzy and that theory violating t2 and t3 may be still acceptable  nevertheless in such case corrections from new physics are large leading to potential lack of predictivity . if this happens to be the case in nature , the violation of t2 or / and t3 conditions will have to be thoroughly examined .",
    "we have calculated triviality and stability bounds on @xmath66 in the effective lagrangian approach for scale of new physics in the range : @xmath67 .",
    "the dominant operators contributing to the effective potential at one - loop level have been included in this analysis .",
    "one - loop basic electroweak constraints have been taken into account .",
    "we concluded that the classic triviality bound remains unchanged .",
    "in contrast , the stability limit is very sensitive to the effective operators : @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
