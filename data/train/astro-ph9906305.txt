    "soft x - ray transients ( sxt ) are binaries in which a black hole or a neutron star primary accretes matter from a main sequence or giant secondary ( van paradijs & mcclintock 1995 , tanaka & shibazaki 1996 ) .",

    "the x - ray luminosity observed during this state from binaries containing a black hole is systematically lower than that from systems with a neutron star .",

    "for a recent compilation of asca observations of sxts in quiescence see asai et al .",
    "it was suggested that in the neutron star systems part of the matter is thrown out by a magnetic propeller ( illarionov & sunyaev 1975 ) and therefore the luminosity is reduced ( asai et al . 1998 , menou et al .",
    "1999b ) .    for the x - ray",
    "nova a0620 - 00 in quiescence the comparison of observed optical and x - ray luminosity showed that the observed x - ray flux is much less than expected if one assumes the same accretion flow everywhere in the disk ( see mcclintock et al . 1995 and references therein ) .",
    "this observation led to the suggestion that most of the thermal and kinetic energy is carried into the black hole by an advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) and is not radiated away .",
    "the adaf model includes the physics of the hot accretion flow ( narayan et al .",

    "the accretion flow is transformed into a hot coronal flow and farther in no underlying cool disk exists anymore ( esin et al . 1997 ) .",

    "our present investigation studies evaporation as the source of the matter for the adaf .",
    "we have shown earlier ( meyer & meyer - hofmeister 1994 , liu et al 1995 , liu et al .",
    "1997 ) that evaporation of matter from a cool disk into an overlying hot corona is important for the evolution of accretion disks in binaries during quiescence .",

    "sxts the horizon lies at much smaller radii and the coronal flow continues into a probably more spherical inner area filled with very hot gas . if the standard thin accretion disk would extend to such small radii with the same mass flow rate as in the outer regions the matter would become ionized and the disk instability would not allow the whole disk to remain in a quiescent state .",

    "we checked the applicability of this result to larger compact object masses with respect to the following physical conditions : the electron - proton collision frequency is high enough that equilibrium is established within the dynamical timescale , the mean free path of transporting electrons is small compared to the temperature scale length in the conductive boundary layer .",
    "the ratio of advective to conductive energy flux remains the same .",
    "all these three ratios remain nearly invariant for large changes in central mass .      an important feature of the accretion disk in quiescence is the existence of a transition between cool disk and hot coronal flow . to evaluate the transition radius @xmath6 one needs to know the mass flow rate @xmath7 in the disk .",
    "the assumption of a quasi - stationary disk allows such an estimate . to determine how this location changes during the long period of quiescence one has to compute the evolution of the disk .",
    "we describe here briefly earlier results to show the similarity in the evolution of the inner disk in different binaries .",
    "to follow such a disk evolution it is necessary to include conservation of mass and angular momentum in the interacting cool disk and corona ( liu et al .",

    "disk evaporation creates a hole in the inner disk and the transition remains near @xmath18 cm while matter piles up in the outer disk until the onset of instability occurs near @xmath19 cm . without evaporation",
    "this would have happened near to the white dwarf surface . for a comparison of accretion disk instabilities in dwarf novae and",
    "transient x - ray sources see cannizzo ( 1998 ) .",
    "wz sge stars , a subgroup of dwarf nova ( ritter & kolb 1998 ) , have also very long outburst recurrence times similar to black hole sxts considered here ( kuulkers 1999 ) .",
    "this makes wz sge an interesting candidate to study the effect of evaporation . for the parameters we had chosen according to observations ( liu et al .",
    "1998 ) we found that during the first years of quiescence the mass flow rate in the inner disk is lower than the evaporation rate , @xmath20 , and a hole is formed . with the increasing accumulation of matter",
    "@xmath21 rises and the transition shifts towards the white dwarf until after about 9 years the hole is closed .",
    "evaporation goes on all the time , even after the inner edge of the disk has reached the white dwarf surface , until the outburst is triggered ( fig . 1 , meyer - hofmeister et al . 1998 ) .",
    "generally the inner edge of the cool disk will be established where the evaporation rate equals the mass flow rate in the disk .",
    "this balance determines the transition radius if the mass of the primary and the mass flow rate in the disk are known .",
    "the fact that the disks are quasi - stationary during long quiescence intervals allows a first estimate for @xmath6 .",

    "it was found that nearly all the optical flux comes from the adaf , the outer disk being quite negligible . from our point of view",
    "this means that the mass overflow rate is higher by the additional amount of matter accumulated in the outer disk for the outburst and by the amount lost in the wind when the coronal flow is formed .",

    "then no hole is created in the disk but evaporation still goes on continuously . in disks around black holes , as for example in a0620 , for the low accretion rates in quiescence a transition at a distance of about @xmath63 cm from the black hole results .",
    "the transition radius can be estimated without following the disk evolution if one assumes a mass flow rate in the disk .",
    "but the evaluation of radii together with the disk evolution includes the constraints on the evolution and is therefore more firm . taking the transition radius and the rate @xmath61 and calculating the evaporation rate one can compare these results .",

    "20 % is lost in a wind and the remaining 80% flows inward in the corona and provides the matter for the adaf in the very hot inner region close to the black hole .",

    "<S> using the black hole transient x - ray source a0620 - 00 as an example we study the physical interplay of three theoretical constituents for modelling these transient sources : ( 1 ) the advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) onto the central black hole , ( 2 ) the evaporation of matter from the cool outer disk forming a coronal flow and ( 3 ) standard disk evolution leading to outburst cycles by accretion disk instability ( dwarf nova mechanism ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the evolution of accretion disks during quiescence including the evaporation of gas in the inner part of the disk . about 20% of the matter </S>",
    "<S> is lost in a wind from the corona . </S>",
    "<S> the mass flow rate obtained from our model for the coronal flow towards the black hole , is about half of the matter flowing over from the companion star . </S>",
    "<S> it agrees with the rate independently derived from the adaf spectral fits by narayan et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1997 ) . </S>",
    "<S> about one third of the matter accumulates in the outer cool disk . </S>",
    "<S> the computed disk evolution is consistent with the observational data from the outburst in 1975 . </S>",
    "<S> the evolution of the accretion disk until the instability is reached shows that the critical surface density can not be reached for rates only slightly less than the rate derived here for a0620 - 00 . </S>",
    "<S> systems with such accretion rates would be globally stable , suggesting that many such faint permanently quiescent black hole x - ray binaries exist . </S>"
