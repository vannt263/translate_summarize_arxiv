    "it can be calculated that the superconducting shielding volume fraction is 55@xmath28 and the meissner volume fraction is 22@xmath28 at 10k .",
    "the synthesis and crystal structure of @xmath29 superconductor have been reported by j. shimoyama _",
    "et al . _ and t. mochiku _ et al .",
    "this suggests that @xmath3 superconductor might be obtained .",
    "it has been known that r-123 or 1212 phase can not be prepared by solid - state reaction under ambient pressure in r - sr - cu - o systems .",
    "however , in @xmath68 system , single phase of ( cu , fe)-1212 phase can be obtained because this phase can be stabilized by the substitution of @xmath0 for @xmath17 .",
    "the @xmath3 sample prepared under ambient pressure is not superconducting , but after high pressure synthesis , the sample becomes superconducting .",
    "this suggests that the origin of superconductivity in @xmath3 is similar to that in @xmath2 and @xmath1 superconductors of hp - samples .",
    "xrd patterns and @xmath14-@xmath58 curve of @xmath3 superconductor are shown in fig.7 , the @xmath59 is about 77k , and the sample is nearly single phase .",
    "the lattice parameters for hp - sample are @xmath53 = 0.3859(4)nm , @xmath55 = 1.1602(5)nm , while for am - sample , @xmath53 = 0.3871(3)nm , @xmath55 = 1.1669(5)nm .",
    "the oxygen content in the @xmath2 samples prepared by solid - state reaction under ambient pressure and high pressure synthesis were determined by a volumetric method @xcite .",
    "the principle of this method is to dissolve the sample in diluted hydrochloric acid , according to the liberated oxygen volume , the oxygen content is calculated .",
    "the obtained results are : 7+@xmath69 = 7.20(2 ) in am - sample and 7+@xmath69 = 7.35(2 ) in hp - sample .",
    "this indicates clearly that the oxygen content is increased by high pressure synthesis .",
    "a superconducting @xmath2 sample with @xmath21 @xmath6 60k was annealed in air at 210 , 290 400 , 500 , 700 , 900 and 950@xmath45c for 2 hours step by step .",
    "fig.8(a ) shows the magnetization @xmath57 temperature curves of the annealed @xmath2 hp - sample , indicating that the superconducting transition temperature @xmath21 and superconducting volume fraction decrease rapidly with the increase of annealing temperature , and the sample became non - superconducting when annealing temperature were higher than 500@xmath45c , and even after annealed under as low as 290@xmath45c , superconductivity in this sample was almost destroyed completely .",
    "the results of the annealed @xmath1 superconductor are similar to these results , which are shown in fig.8(b ) .",
    "fig.9 shows the local region xrd patterns ( 46@xmath45@xmath648@xmath45 in 2@xmath70 ) of the @xmath2 am - sample and the annealed hp - sample at different temperatures .",
    "after high pressure synthesis , the peaks of ( 006 ) and ( 200 ) shift to high angle degree and overlap each other , and with the increase of annealing temperature , the peaks shift to low angle degree again . when the annealing temperature is higher than 400@xmath45c , the positions of the peaks are nearly constant within experimental error , indicating that lattice parameters @xmath53 and @xmath55 stop increasing .",
    "it means that the extra oxygen introduced by high pressure synthesis is liberated almost completely at 400@xmath45c . as a result ,",
    "the annealed sample becomes non - superconducting .",
    "when temperature is higher than 500@xmath45c , the main role of the annealing is the improvement of lattice distortion , homogenizing and the increase of crystal grain size , which makes the peaks narrower and makes ( 006 ) and ( 200 ) peaks gradually apart from each other .",
    "a well - known fact in r-123 phase superconductors is that the superconductors with higher oxygen content have smaller lattice parameters @xmath53 and @xmath55 .",
    "this phenomenon was also observed in the @xmath27 superconductor @xcite and in @xmath29 superconductor @xcite obtained by high oxygen pressure synthesis . in these superconductors ,",
    "the diffraction peaks of ( 006 ) and ( 200 ) shift systematically to higher angle degree with the increase of oxygen content , which is similar to our results .",
    "all our hp - samples have smaller lattice parameters @xmath53 and @xmath55 than the corresponding am - samples , and the lattice unit cell of hp - samples displays an obvious shrinkage .",
    "since the relative shrinkage is not more bigger than other samples annealed under high oxygen pressure , and also for that @xmath29 sample can be made superconducting without high pressure synthesis , thereby this shrinkage can be attributed to the increase of oxygen content , but not the pressure effect caused by the high pressure synthesis procedure .",
    "then it can be deduced that in all @xmath7 samples the oxygen content increased after high pressure synthesis , which is validated by the oxygen content measurement in @xmath2 system where 7+@xmath69 increased from 7.20(2 ) in am - sample to 7.35(2 ) in hp - sample .",
    "the increased oxygen content provided the required charge which made the semiconducting - like am - samples changed to superconducting hp - samples .",
    "the diffusion of @xmath0 atom into @xmath19 planes in r-123 systems is believed to be very unfavorable for superconductivity because of its magnetic moment , and with the increase of @xmath0 concentration , this diffusion is inevitable in samples synthesized by common solid - state reaction @xcite .",
    "j. shimoyama _",
    "@xcite used a complex annealing procedure which is believed to suppress the incorporation of @xmath0 to the @xmath19 planes in @xmath29 system , and finally made it superconducting with @xmath21 @xmath6 60k . using neutron powder diffraction studies , t. mochiku _",
    "@xcite investigated the site - mixing between @xmath0 and @xmath17 atoms in @xmath29 samples synthesized through different procedures , and proved that simply increasing the oxygen content could not produce superconductivity and the ordered distribution of @xmath0 and @xmath17 atoms between @xmath8 and @xmath9 sites is also one of the key points to the origin of superconductivity . in our heavily @xmath0-doped r-1212 systems , high pressure synthesis procedure is believed to promote the transfer of @xmath0 atoms from @xmath9 site to @xmath8 site , and to make almost all the @xmath0 atoms to occupy the @xmath8 chain site .",
    "this redistribution of @xmath0 atoms is a needed requirement to ensure the occurrence of superconductivity , while the increase of oxygen content provides the needed amount of charge .",
    "the annealing experiments of @xmath2 and @xmath1 superconductors indicate clearly that the concentration of oxygen content affects superconductivity in hp - samples directly .",
    "since annealed under the temperature as low as 290@xmath45c during a short time of 2 hours , the occupation site of @xmath0 atoms could not be changed , but superconductivity in these superconductors was destroyed sharply .",
    "the local region xrd patterns in fig.9 indicated that the lattice parameters increased rapidly with the increase of annealing temperature below 400@xmath45c , which suggested the release of oxygen content , and this was the main reason for the loss of superconductivity .",
    "after the discovery of @xmath29 and @xmath2 superconductors , there is a doubt that the superconductivity in these superconductors is possibly from @xmath10 , @xmath11 or @xmath12 phase formed by phase segregation .",
    "it is known that @xmath12 superconductor with @xmath21 = 30 - 80k can be obtained also by high pressure synthesis and its superconductivity disappears after heat treating at 300 - 500@xmath45c . although the single phase of xrd pattern results and high superconducting volume fraction of these superconductors have excluded these disputes , the achievement of @xmath1 superconductor and the similarity of its superconductivity to those of @xmath2 and @xmath3 superconductors eliminate this doubt .",
    "the annealing experiments also eliminate the possibility that the superconductivity in @xmath1 hp - sample is from @xmath10 phase due to phase segregation , since it is well known that the superconductivity in @xmath10 can not be destroyed by annealing at the temperature of 200 - 500@xmath45c and the @xmath21 of @xmath10 obtained by high pressure synthesis is 92k @xcite .",
    "the discovery of these heavily - substituted superconductors with magnetic metal of @xmath0 atoms provides new platforms to investigate the mechanism of high temperature superconductivity and the correlation of magnetism and superconductivity , and it seems that we need to reconsider the influence of magnetism on superconductivity .",
    "three kind of superconductors with high @xmath0 concentration @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 were successfully prepared by solid - state reaction and high pressure synthesis .",
    "the high pressure synthesis resulted in the increase of oxygen content and redistribution of @xmath0 and @xmath17 atoms between @xmath8 and @xmath9 sites , which are two key factors for the occurrence of superconductivity .",
    "the annealing experimental results indicate these clearly and eliminate the doubt of superconductivity relative to possible secondary phase of @xmath10 , @xmath11 or @xmath12 superconductors .",
