    "the understanding of the nuclear force at a microscopic level is an important problem since it shall be the basis for the nuclear matter and finite nuclei calculations .",
    "the interactions of nucleons which may arise as a residual interaction due to their substructure of quarks and gluons is technically not solvable .",
    "the alternative approach is to tackle the problem through meson interactions .    in recent years",
    "relativistic mean field theory ( rmf)@xcite has been quite successful in describing nuclear matter and finite nuclei properties .",
    "the nn dynamics arises in this model from the exchange of a lorentz scalar isoscalar meson , @xmath0 , which provides the mid range attraction and an isoscalar vector meson , @xmath1 , which provides the repulsion .",
    "also , in this model the inclusion of the @xmath2- meson takes care of the neutron - proton asymmetry . with a small number of parameters",
    ", the rmf model reproduces the nuclear matter saturation and describes the bulk and the single particle properties for the finite nuclei reasonably well .    despite the success of the rmf model , several open questions still remain unanswered .",
    "firstly , the meson fields are classical and secondly the attractive part of the nuclear force is mediated through the hypothetical @xmath0 meson which could be an effect of multi - pion exchanges @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 can not be interpreted as the representation of a physical particle , since such a particle or resonant state remains still to be confirmed in the experiment .",
    "thus on aesthetic as well as phenomenological ground , alternative approaches will add to our understandings .",
    "the original walecka model at the hartree approximation does not contain a dynamical description of the pion fields . however the importance of the pions in nn dynamics can not be ignored . realizing the essential role of pion in the description of the nuclear medium an alternative approach for the nuclear matter @xcite , deuteron @xcite and for @xmath3he @xcite has been developed . in this method , it has been studied the description of nuclear matter using pion pairs through a squeezed coherent state type of construction @xcite .",
    "this simulates the effects of the @xmath0-meson and is a very natural quantum mechanical formalism for the classical fields .",
    "the generator coordinate method ( gcm ) is a technique of great physical appeal which has been developed @xcite to describe collective oscillations in nuclei . besides being extensively used in nuclear structure physics",
    ", it often finds application in various other branches of physics @xcite . in this work",
    "we investigate the pion condensation problem in nuclear matter and neutron matter using the generator coordinate method . in a simplified model , the problem had been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite where a coherent state description for the pions was used . using the gaussian overlap and harmonic approximation",
    ", the hamiltonian may be diagonalized by a randam phase approximation ( rpa ) like canonical transformation @xcite . in this methodology",
    ", one can go beyond the coherent state description . again",
    "the calculation can be carried out exactly , without further approximation .",
    "the present analysis is an extension of the mean field approach of walecka where classical fields are replaced by quantum coherent states for the pion pairs .",
    "this report has also an advantage that the one pion exchange correlation contributions are considered at rpa level using similar bogoliubov transformations . in the present model ,",
    "we have observed no sign of the pion condensations in the rpa modes .    the outline of the paper follows . in section 2 , we derive a pion nucleon hamiltonian in a non - relativistic limit .",
    "we then construct a bogoliubov transformations for the pion pair operators and calculate the energy associated with the pion pairs . in section 3",
    ", we calculate the correlation energies due to one pion exchange in nuclear matter and neutron matter at random phase approximation ( rpa ) .",
    "section 4 consists of the discussions of the saturation properties of nuclear matter , the pion dispersion relation in the medium and a concluding remarks .",
    "the lagrangian for the pion nucleon system is taken as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the doublet of the nucleon field with mass @xmath6 , @xmath7 s are pion fields and @xmath8 represents the off - mass shell isospin triplet pion field with mass @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath10 is the pion - nucleon coupling constant .",
    "repeated indices indicate summation .",
    "the representations of @xmath11 matrices are @xmath12 from the above lagrangian , the equation of motions are @xmath13 @xmath14 where , @xmath15 and @xmath16 . eliminating the small component @xmath17 from equation ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) we have @xmath18\\psi_i=0\\ .\\ ] ] equation ( 4 ) can be rewritten as @xmath19-g^2\\phi\\cdot \\phi\\right ] \\psi_i=0\\ .\\ ] ] from equation ( 5 ) , we can immediately identify the effective hamiltonian for the nucleons as @xmath20^{1/2}\\psi_i(\\vec x)\\nonumber\\\\ & \\simeq&\\psi_i^\\dagger(\\vec x)\\left[\\epsilon_x-\\frac{ig}{2\\epsilon_x } ( ( \\vec\\sigma\\cdot\\vec p)\\phi)+\\frac{g^2}{2\\epsilon_x}\\phi^2\\right ] \\psi_i(\\vec x)\\nonumber\\\\ & = & { \\cal h}^0_n(\\mathbf x)+{\\cal h}_{int}(\\mathbf x)\\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the single particle nucleon energy operator @xmath21 is given by @xmath22 . in the non - relativistic assumption , we have to replace @xmath21 by @xmath6 , when in a denominator and by @xmath23 when not in a denominator .",
