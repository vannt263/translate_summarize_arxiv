    "radio pulsars are believed to turn off when they can no longer produce electron - positron pairs in strong and curved magnetic fields within a so called inner accelerator region just above the polar cap .",
    "the limiting rotational period @xmath5 at which this occurs depends on the magnitude and configuration of the surface magnetic field @xmath6 .",
    "unfortunately , only the dipolar component @xmath7 of this field can be deduced from the observed spin - down rate .",
    "the line on the @xmath8 plane or @xmath9 plane corresponding to this critical period is called a death line .",
    "no radio pulsar should be observed to the right or above of this line i.e. with a period longer than the critical one .",
    "recently , @xcite reported on the existence of psr j2144@xmath03933 with a period of 8.5 second which is by far the longest known .",
    "this pulsar , which is located far beyond all conventional death lines , seem to challenge existing emission models .",
    "as @xcite concluded themselves , under the usual assumptions , this slowly rotating pulsar should not be emitting a radio beam .",
    "in this paper we attempt to examine this problem assuming that psr j2144@xmath03933 generates radio emission just the same way as other pulsars . assuming that pulsar s inner accelerator is the vacuum gap ( vg henceforth ) driven by curvature radiation ( cr henceforth ) for pair production in strong magnetic fields",
    ", we find that its radio detection is consistent with a strong and complicated surface magnetic field in pulsars .",
    "when such fields with a magnitude much greater than the measurable dipole component and radius of curvature much smaller than the neutron star radius @xmath4  cm is assumed , then one can easily find general death lines which include psr j2144@xmath03933 on their left side ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "this is consistent with @xcite , who noted that if pair creation is essential for coherent radio emission , then pulsars with very long periods ( @xmath10 seconds ) require more complex surface field than a pure dipole ( see also arons 2000 ) , where similar conclusions were drawn in a more complete treatment , including the inverse compton scattering ( ics henceforth ) as a source of pairs and frame - dragging effect modifying the electric field near the polar cap surface ) .",
    "we demonstrate in this paper that formation of vacuum gap above pulsar polar cap is possible , provided that the surface magnetic field is extremely non - dipolar ( sunspot - like ) .",
    "@xcite in their discovery paper already noticed that extremely curved and strong surface field would solve the problem of death line in psr j2144@xmath03933 .",
    "they were however reluctant to accept that such extreme configuration with @xmath11 and @xmath12 can exist .",
    "@xcite argued that if the pulsar s inner accelerator is the so - called space charge limited flow ( sclf henceforth ) with the ics as the dominating mechanism of pair production then a pure dipolar magnetic field configuration is sufficient to produce death lines which can explain the presence of this pulsar .",
    "we however , for reasons explained below , will assume that the surface magnetic field configuration required by the curvature radiation induced vacuum gap ( vg - cr ) and/or inverse compton scattering vacuum gap ( vg - ics ) is just what nature creates in pulsars , which perhaps is not the simplest explanation , but nevertheless a possibility , which we intend to explore in this paper .",
    "the only strong condition to define pulsar deathlines is the condition for pair production , regardless of the detailed mechanisms to produce these pairs .",
    "pulsar deathlines are therefore model dependent . in history",
    ", both the vg model and the sclf model have been developed and the corresponding death lines of both models were investigated by ruderman & sutherland ( 1975 ; rs75 henceforth ) and @xcite .",
    "the original versions of both models assume cr to be the dominating mechanism for pair production and neglect the influence of the general relativistic frame - dragging effect and other sources of pairs .",
    "both models were later improved to include the frame - dragging effect @xcite and the ics @xcite as an alternative mechanism for pair production .",
    "@xcite fully investigated death lines of all different kinds of the models . in ",
    "2 we argue that both the observational data and theory of coherent radio emission seem to favour the vg models of inner pulsar accelerator . we find that the group of pulsars with drifting subpulses can be naturally explained by the vg - cr model , but to explain all the normal pulsars one has to also invoke the vg - ics model .",
    "as mentioned above , two types of the polar cap acceleration models ( vg and sclf respectively ) are usually considered . in the vg models ,",
    "the free outflow of charges from the polar cap is impeded and the high acceleration potential drop is related to formation of an empty gap above the polar cap ( sturrock 1971 ; rs75 ; cheng & ruderman 1977 , 1980 ) . in the sclf models the charged particles flow freely from the polar cap surface and",
    "accelerate within a height scale of about one stellar radius @xmath4  cm due to the potential drop resulting from the curvature of magnetic field lines and/or inertia of outstreaming particles @xcite .",
    "although this potential drop is too weak to explain the entire population of existing radio pulsars , @xcite have shown that the relativistic effect of inertial frame dragging generates an additional potential drop within about one stellar radius , which is almost two orders of magnitude larger than the inertial potential drop . in both vg and sclf models , either the cr or the ics photons should be considered as the sources of pairs .",
    "it is well known that the vg models suffer from the so - called `` binding energy problem '' ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it was demonstrated that the binding energy of @xmath13fe ions is much too small to prevent thermionic emission from the surface , and thus formation of vacuum gap above pulsar polar cap was questionable .",
    "thus , the binding energy problem is an important difficulty of the vg models and in this sense the sclf models are more natural , unless some further assumptions are adopted and justified .",
    "xu et al . ( 1999 ; for review see xu et al .",
    "2000a ) proposed that pulsars showing drifting subpulses , thus requiring some kind of vg inner accelerator , are bare polar cap strange stars ( bpcss henceforth ) rather than neutron stars .",
    "this attractive but exotic conjecture and is based on the argument that the work function for both electrons and positrons in bpcss is practically infinite . in this paper",
    "we argue that the binding energy crisis can be solved alternatively and more naturally by assuming extremely strong and curved surface magnetic field above the ns polar cap .",
    "therefore , we conclude that invoking the bpcss conjecture is not necessary .",
    "an important feature that distinguishes vg models from sclf models is that the former produce sparks , as originally delineated by rs75 .",
    "each spark generates a plasma cloud and interaction of adjacent clouds may have something to do with the generation of coherent radio emission ( see below ) . due to @xmath14 drift within the gap , the subpulse associated sparks are expected to rotate slowly around the magnetic pole , at a rate which can be tested observationaly in pulsars showing drifting subpulses in their single pulse emission",
    "recently , @xcite analysed drifting subpulses in psr b0943@xmath1510 with a newly developed technique called `` cartographic transform '' , based on the sophisticated fluctuation spectra analysis .",
    "they obtained a clear map of the polar cap with 20 sparks rotating around the pole at the rate consistent with the rs75 model , with each spark completing one full rotation in 37 pulsar periods .",
    "it is this consistency which tells us that the rs75-type vg model is realized in nature , at least in pulsars showing periodicies in their fluctuation spectra that can be associated with rotating sparks .",
    "it is important to emphasize that it is not just a handful a pulsars with clearly drifting subpulses .",
    "@xcite demonstrated , that such periodicities in the range 2 - 15 pulsar periods are common among the so called conal profile components , while core components either do not show any evidence of periodicities or they are much weaker ( in the range 15 - 50 pulsar periods ) . in fig .  1 we marked by crossed circles 41 pulsars showing periodic subpulse modulations , following ( * ? ? ?",
    "* tables  2 and 3 ) .",
    "@xcite reanalysed the case of psr b0943@xmath1510 and three other pulsars with a clear subpulse drift ( see table 1 in this paper ) , within their modified rs75 model .",
    "they confirmed consistency of the observed periodicities with their modified rs75 vg model .",
    "the fundamental drift periodicity can be expressed by @xmath16 , where @xmath17 ( the complexity parameter ) is the ratio of the canonical polar cap radius to the gap heigh , @xmath5 is the pulsar period and @xmath18 is the number of sparks circulating around the pole . for psr b0943 + 10 @xmath19 , @xmath20 and therefore @xmath21 , as observed ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for small values of @xmath22 ,",
    "@xmath23 and the subpulse drift is hard to be detected . for medium values of @xmath22 , the @xmath24 values are in the range @xmath25 , and for very large @xmath26 ( core single pulsars - see gil & sendyk 2000 ) , the @xmath24 periods largely exceed @xmath27 .",
    "the fundamental problem of pulsar studies is that there is no consensus at all about the radio emission mechanism except that pair production is an essential condition and that the radiation mechanism must be coherent .",
    "yet another widely accepted constraint is that the emission region is located close to the neutron star , at altitudes about few percent of the light cylinder radius @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "however , in the millisecond pulsars it can reach even @xmath29 of @xmath30 @xcite .    after more then 30 years of intensive research , only few succesful , self - consistent models of generation of coherent pulsar radio emission can be found in the literature .",
    "historically , the first one ( called the georgian model ) was proposed by @xcite . in this model ,",
    "based on the sclf inner acceleration scenario , the radio emission is generated by a maser relativistic plasma radiation .",
    "this model requires relatively low magnetic field , thus high emission altitudes ( larger than 30% of @xmath30 ) , and therefore its possible applicability is restricted to millisecond pulsars .",
    "qiao and collaborators ( 1998 ; for review see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) proposed a coherent ics model of pulsar radio emission .",
    "this model is based on the sparking vg scenario @xcite .",
    "the low frequency electromagnetic wave associated with development and decay of a spark are scattered on bunches of outstreaming particles .",
    "the coherent ics model seems to have some observational difficulties .",
    "as @xcite argued , it can reproduce the core pulsar beam and two conal ( inner and outer ) beams .",
    "however , present day observational data suggest that pulsar beams may consist of up to three or even four nested cones @xcite , which can not be explained within the ics model , at least by its simplest published version ( including a double - peaked pair distribution function will probably result in more cones ; zhang 2000 , privat information ) .",
    "the more serious problem is the observed pulsar polarization .",
    "the coherent ics model predicts that the individual emission corresponding to the core beam should be circularly polarized , while the conal beams should demonstrate no significant circular polarization @xcite .",
    "however , available polarimetric observations of single pulses show that subpulses in conal pulsars are clearly circularly polarized , with sense reversals near the subpulse peak , consistent with the model of coherent curvature radiation @xcite .",
    "this property , if confirmed in larger sample of pulsars , might be a big challenge for the coherent ics model of pulsar radio emission .",
    "the same applies to the maser relativistic plasma radiation ( georgian model ) .",
    "recently , a new idea has been developed , according to which the observed pulsar radio emission is a coherent curvature radiation emitted by charged solitons associated with sparks operating in the inner vg accelerator @xcite .",
    "the model is entirely self - consistent and determines pulsar characteristics by two basic observables , @xmath5 and @xmath31 .",
    "the present version of the soliton model explores the vg - cr model , although the vg - ics alternative is not excluded .    pulsars with drifting",
    "subpulses , which require existence of sparks , are distributed more or less uniformly over the bulk of typical pulsars on the @xmath32 diagram ( fig .",
    "1 ) . on the other hand , radio emission of typical pulsars originates at low altitudes , which favours radiation models based on the sparking scenario .",
    "it is thus clear from the above discussion that the vg - cr and/or vg - ics models seem to be preferred in typical pulsars , both from the observational and theoretical point of view .",
    "we therefore concentrate in this paper on this class of inner accelerator models and we plan to give a full treatment , including the sclf along with the frame dragging effect ( which perhaps can be applied to millisecond pulsars ) in a separate paper .",
    "we will argue in this paper that the actual surface magnetic field is extremaly strong and curved with @xmath11 and @xmath12 , where @xmath33  g is the global surface dipole component ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , @xmath3 is the radius of curvature of surface field lines and @xmath4  cm is the ns radius .",
    "thus , for a convenience of further considerations we present in this section new results concerning gap formation and death lines in superstrong magnetic fields @xmath34 , where @xmath35  g is the critical magnetic field strenght at which the electron gyrofrequency @xmath36 is equal to its rest mass . above this strengh the photon splitting phenomenon may inhibit pair formation process @xcite .",

    "thus , it is obvious that all normal pulsar can be explained by vg - ics and/or vg - cr inner accelerator , without invoking the bpcss conjecture @xcite .    as one can see from fig .  1",

    "moreover , in the assymptotic case the gap height @xmath138 is quite long ( see eq . [ [ a12 ] ] ) and the polar cap heating is considerable .",
    "however , since @xmath139 , higher surface magnetic field @xmath1 leads to much lower gap heights in the near threshold case ( see eq . [ [ a11 ] ] ) and correspondingly lower surface temperatures @xmath115 .",

    "this striking property seems to have natural explanation within the framework of our model .",
    "in fact , the core single pulsars occupy regions of the @xmath32 diagram well above the critical lines for which @xmath141 . taking @xmath142  s and @xmath143 as the average values in the group of core single pulsars ( see fig .",
    "6 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) we obtain from equation  ( [ tsti ] ) that @xmath144 even for @xmath145 , so the vg - cr gap can always form in these objects .",
    "we intend to explore the above mentioned idea in a separate paper .",
    "in this section we examine an influence of strong surface magnetic fields required by the ion binding energy problem on the location of death lines on the @xmath32 diagram .",
    "we are specially interested in psr j2144@xmath03933 with the extremal period @xmath146  s , which lies well beyond all conventional death lines .",
    "an approximate condition for pair creation in strong magnetic field @xmath147 was given by @xcite .",
    "in the limit of high photon energies @xmath148 , the conversion rate depends sensitively on the parameter @xmath149 . @xcite",
    "considered the problem of death lines in nondipolar configurations of the surface magnetic field at the pulsar polar cap , using the asymptotic approximation described by the above condition @xmath150 .",
    "we first apply their results to the new 8.5 second period pulsar . with very curved lines and strong field",
    "the gap height is @xmath151 .",
    "when this reduction of the gap height is taken into account , then the corresponding death line equation takes the form @xmath152 where we introduced the radius of curvature explicitely . setting @xmath146  s and @xmath153  g",
    ", we find that @xmath154  g and @xmath155  cm .",
    "the above asymptotic considerations suggest that the surface magnetic field in psr j2144@xmath03933 should be very strong and extremaly curved ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , the asymptotic condition for magnetic pair creation is not valid for magnetic fields @xmath156  g , which is much lower than surface fields inferred just above , by means of this approximation .",
    "thus we have to use the near threshold condition @xmath157 , discussed generally in the   3 .",
    "a general near threshold cr death line is expressed by equation ( [ a10 ] ) . for psr j2144@xmath03933",
    "@xmath146  s and @xmath158 and thus we obtain a condition @xmath159 . treating this as a general condition we obtain a death line @xmath160 , which is presented as the line ( 4 ) in fig .  1 . since in psr j2114@xmath03933 @xmath161  g ( and @xmath162  g ) , then @xmath163 , which gives @xmath164 , respectively",
    "it is also interesting to compare the near threshold ics induced death line with the cr induced death line represented by the line ( 4 ) in fig .",
    "1 . using the equation ( [ a15 ] ) and putting @xmath122 and @xmath165 into it , one obtains death line @xmath166 which is presented as the line ( 5 ) in fig .  1 .",
    "obviously , this critical death line can explain all normal ( non - millisecond ) pulsars .",
    "however , the case of psr j2114@xmath03933 can be interpreted with much less ad hoc field configuration , for example @xmath167 and @xmath92 .",
    "in this paper we have examined an influence of extremely strong and curved surface magnetic field on the long standing binding energy problem ( for review see * ? ? ?",
    "we have demonstrated within cr and/or ics driven pair production model that formation of a vacuum gap above the pulsar polar cap is in principle possible , provided that @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "we have also addresed in this paper a very interesting and currently topical problem of why so many radio pulsars are beyond the conventional death lines , where theoretically they should not be converting high energy photons into electron - positron pairs .",
    "psr j2144@xmath03933 is the pulsar of our special interest with @xmath146  s and @xmath168 ( thus @xmath153  g ) , which is located extremely far beyond conventional death lines ( circle in fig .  1 ) .",
    "assuming strong multipolar surface magnetic field suggested by the binding energy problem , we can explain this extremal object without invoking any different radiation mechanism than that for ordinary pulsars .",
    "a value of @xmath169  g and @xmath170  cm seems to fit the constraint imposed by the 8.5  s period well .",
    "@xcite have noticed that extremely twisted field could marginally explain the pulsar location in the @xmath171 diagram , but they consider such fields unlikely .",
    "however , they did not consider a sunspot like configuration that we use in this paper .    there is a growing evidence that quite a large number of conal - type pulsars @xcite with drifting subpulses ( grazing cuts of the line - of - sight ) or periodic intensity modulation ( central cuts of the line - of - sight ) have the rs75-type polar gap accelerators with curvature radiation dominated magnetic pair production @xcite .",
    "we argue in this paper that in such cases the surface magnetic field penetrating the polar gap should be dominated by a strong multipolar ( presumably sunspot - like magnetic field with @xmath172 and @xmath12 ) components , reconnecting with a global dipole field well before the radio emission region .",
    "@xcite concluded in their recent paper that it is not necessary to postulate ad hoc multipolar field configuration to explain psr j2144@xmath03933 .",
    "in fact , they demonstrated that the ics induced sclf accelerator produces death lines that include psr j2144@xmath03993 .",
    "however , we would like to strongly emphasize that the sclf model is unable to explain the subpulse drift phenomenon , which seems to be a common phenomenon , at least among the conal - type profile pulsars @xcite , although there is no direct evidence for conal type emission in psr j2144@xmath03933 .    as can be seen from fig .  1",
    ", the vg formation is in principle possible for all normal pulsars ( excluding binary and millisecond ones ) , provided that the surface magnetic field is extremaly strong and curved .",
    "pulsars above the line ( 1 ) can form the vg - cr inner accelerator even with relatively low surface field @xmath173 .",
    "however , pulsars below this line require much higher fields @xmath11 to form the vg - cr ( @xmath130 at line ( 2 ) but it has to decrease towards the line ( 1 ) , as the actual field should not exceed the critical field @xmath174  g ) . below the line ( 2 )",
    "one can not form the vg - cr accelerator unless @xmath175 .",
    "however , it is possible to form a vg - ics inner accelerator with @xmath130 and @xmath77 on the line ( 3 ) .",
    "since the dipolar field @xmath134  g around this line , one can use @xmath62 even larger than 100 , and therefore all normal pulsars lie above critical lines for the vg formation .",
    "the general conslusion is that the vg formation , either cr or ics induced , require strong and curved surface magnetic field with radius of curvature @xmath176  cm and the field strenght @xmath11 , where @xmath177 is the photon splitting level .",
    "this implies , that radio pulsars ( at least non - milisecond ones ) are neutron stars with surface magnetic field strenght 10 - 100 times the surface dipolar component derived from @xmath5 and @xmath31 values .",
    "such ns can form vg - cr or vg - ics inner accelerators , which discharges via a number of localised sparks .",
    "both vg - cr and vg - ics produce sparks , importance of which for the mechanism of coherent pulsar radio emission was recently emphasised by @xcite .",
    "the sparking discharge within a vg inner accelerator is also a natural explanation of the subpulse drift / periodic modulation .",
    "the group of pulsars with clearly drifting subpulses seem to favour the vg - cr model , although the vg - ics model is not excluded .",
    "few well know drifters lying below the line ( 2 ) in fig .",
    "1 seem to require the ics contribution or even domination of the gap discharge .",
    "it is important to emphasize that pulsars with signatures of periodic subpulse modulations seem to be distributed all over the bulk of the @xmath32 plane @xcite .",
    "therefore , it seems unlikely that pulsars with drifting subpulses represent the vg accelerator while others are driven by the sclf accelerator .",
    "we suggest that normal radio pulsars are those neutron stars which can develope the vg inner accelerator above their polar caps .",
    "this interpretation is consistent with the current status of theory of the coherent pulsar radio emission , which also seem to favour the sparking vg model , at least in normal pulsars @xcite .",
    "the millisecond pulsars are probably driven by the sclf inner accelerator .",
    "this problem will be examined in the forthcoming paper .",
    "we would like to note that a sunspot - like configuration conjectured in this paper for vg formation and supported by the case of psr j2144@xmath03933 is also suggested by the spin - down index of psr b0540@xmath069 ( cr93 , * ? ? ?",
    "also @xcite , analyzing the x - ray emissions from regions near the polar cap of the rotation powered pulsars , argued that @xmath178  g and @xmath176  cm , which agrees well with our independent estimates .",
    "as already mentioned , @xcite attempting to explain morphological differences in pulse shapes and variations in polarization properties of different profile types as well as the subpulse drift rates , concluded that the surface magnetic field at the polar cap should be dominated by sunspot - like structures .",
    "it seems that there is a growing evidence of such small scale anomalies in surface magnetic field of radio pulsars ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and our paper gives independent arguments supporting this idea .",
    "polarization studies in radio pulsars seems to suggest that significant part of the radio emission arises from regions in the magnetosphere where the magnetic field is largely dipolar .",
    "also studies concerning the morphology of pulse profiles is consistent with dipolar magnetic field structure in the radio emission altitudes which is thought to be arising close to the stellar surface given by the relation @xmath179 @xcite .",
    "thus , if there are strong and complicated surface magnetic fields @xmath180 on the stellar surface it is important to access whether complicated fields would decay fast enough with altitude such that in the emission region the magnetic field structure is almost purely dipolar as constrained by observations . on the other hand",
    ", the radius of curvature of surface field lines should be about @xmath181  cm , which means that the structure of the gap magnetic field is determined by multipoles higher than the quadrupole .",
    "here we consider the model of the magnetic field to be sunspot like near the surface of the neutron star while the global dipolar magnetic field is that of a star centered dipole .",
    "such small scale magnetic fields on the surface of the neutron star has also been considered by several authors to explain the radio emission properties from pulsars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the ` crustal - model ' of the neutron star where the magnetic field is generated in neutron star due to the currents in the crust",
    ", it is predicted that these models are only capable of producing small scale magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "these small scale fields can be modelled as small current loops giving rise to dipolar fields which are oriented in different directions all over the stellar surface and superposed on the global dipole field . following",
    "this one can express the magnetic field @xmath182 at a distance @xmath183 from the stellar center as the multipolar expansion @xmath184 , where @xmath185 correspond to dipole , quadrupole , octupole etc . and",
    "@xmath186 is the magnetic field strength of a given pole at the neutron star s surface .",
    "the number of reversals of the magnetic field across the stellar surface depends on the order of the multipole in question .",
    "for example a pure dipolar field will have 2 reversals while a pure quadrupole will have 4 reversals and in general for a multipole of order @xmath187 there will be @xmath188 reversals . here",
    "we consider the multipolar field which has sun - spot like magnetic loops with typical radius of curvature @xmath189  cm .",
    "this type of structure corresponds to multipoles of order @xmath190 .",
    "the actual multipole order of a crust origin field clump can be estimated as @xmath191 , where @xmath192 is a characteristic crust thickness . for typical pulsars with @xmath193 second",
    "the radio emission arises at altitudes @xmath194 , and the ratio @xmath195 in the emission region even if @xmath196 at the surface .",
    "this means that radio emission arises from dipolar field lines even if there are strong , small scale multipolar anomalies on the surface of the polar cap .",
    "the field surface strenght of a local multipole is @xmath197 , where @xmath198 or 2 depending on relative orientation of adjacent magnetic moments ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this gives an estimate @xmath199 , as inferred in this paper using the binding energy arguments .",
    "we have shown in this paper that vg formation in typical pulsars requires the crust - origin surface multipolar field to be much stronger ( 10 - 100 times ) than the dipolar surface component of the star centered global field . in order to apply to the millisecond pulsars",
    ", we would have to invoke magnification factors @xmath200 .",
    "this would mean that the millisecond pulsars have surface magnetic fields of the same order as the typical ( normal ) pulsars .",
    "@xcite came to similar conclusion analysing the non - thermal x - ray emission from outer gaps of rotation powered pulsars .",
    "whether such strong surface magnetic field can exist in millisecond pulsars is not known .",
    "we would like to mention here one constraint found in the literature .",
    "@xcite has shown that the location of the spin - up line in the @xmath32 diagram constraints the large scale anomlies of the magnetic field at the surface to no more than about 40% of the surface strenght of dipolar field .",
    "this constraint does not concern the crust - origin small scale anomalies invoked in this paper , which will not affect the dipolar structure of the magnetic field in the radio emission region .",
    "however , if such extremely strong fields are excluded in the millisecond pulsars , then their inner accelerator must be of sclf type , which implies the maser kind of radio emission mechanism @xcite .",
    "it is worth to emphasize that all our conclusions presented in this paper concern vacuum gaps in neutron stars .",
    "therefore , we claim that it may not be necessary to invoke the bpcss conjecture proposed by @xcite , according to which pulsars , at least those with drifting subpulses , are strange stars with bare polar caps ( for review see xu et al .",
    "however , we have to admit that we can not exclude the bpcss hypothesis .    a complicated magnetic field with radius of curvature much smaller than the star radius has to be confined to the neutron star crust .",
    "@xcite examined the evolution of multipole components generated by currents in the outer crust .",
    "they found that mostly low order multipoles contribute to the required small radii of curvature , and that the structure of the surface magnetic field is not expected to change significantly during the radio pulsar lifetime .",
    "the important question is if the crust can support surface magnetic fields with a magnitude approaching @xmath201  g. equating the magnetic pressure of a strong multipolar field to the crustal stress one concludes that the maximum field which the neutron star can sustain is approximately about @xmath202 g @xcite .",
    "thus , our inferred magnitudes @xmath203 g are in the regime where cracking of the neutron star crust will still not occur .",
    "we would like to point out a small weakness of our paper , namely an apparent lack of pulsars in a valley between the marginal line ( 4 ) in fig .  1 ( including the extremal pulsar psr j2144@xmath03933 ) and the right - hand boundary of the bulk of @xmath32 distribution .",
    "the lack of pulsars at the long period regime near the 8.5 second pulsar is understandable , since detectibility of long period pulsars is much smaller than that of shorter ones , as pointed out by @xcite .",
    "the lack of shorter period pulsars within this valley has been explained by @xcite , who invoked a death line below which pair production is not supported by the sclf - ics mechanism ( line iv in their fig .  1 ) . within our vg scenario",
    ", this might just mean that strong multipole fields are possible but not common in old pulsars .",
    "another possible explanation concerns a luminosity issue .",
    "let us notice that psr j2144@xmath03933 is a very old ( 281 myr ) , extremaly weak ( 4 mjy ) and close to the earth ( 0.19 kpc ) pulsar . it would not probably be detected if it was located just a bit further away .",
    "so perhaps the radio luminosity of pulsars drops below a detection threshold of a typical survey before their inner accelerators stop completely producing a pair plasma .",
    "finally , we would like to emphasize once again that vacuum gaps which we have shown to exist in pulsars , produce sparking discharges .",
    "these isolated sparks seem to be naturally involved with drifting subpulses observed in typical pulsars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , spark - associated models of the coherent pulsar radio emission @xcite critically depend on existence of non - stationary vacuum gaps , and therefore our paper supports these ideas on fundamental grounds .",
