    "electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) in three - level @xmath1-systems is a phenomenon in which an initially absorbing medium is rendered transparent to a resonant weak probe laser when a strong coupling laser is applied to a second transition @xcite .",
    "in addition to its being a quantum interference phenomenon of fundamental interest , eit has been studied extensively for its numerous applications , such as in slow and fast light , light storage , sensitive magnetometry and optical information processing .",
    "an extension of the usual three - level eit to a four - level double - eit scheme has been shown to expand the utility of eit in a number of additional , potentially useful and easily controllable coherent nonlinear effects .",
    "these include engineering atomic response by perturbing a dark state @xcite , and control of group velocity via interacting dark resonances @xcite .",
    "the interest in four - level tripod - like atomic configurations started with an early work @xcite showing that in a tripod medium , there exists an internal state subspace spanned by two orthogonal dark states , which is immune to spontaneous decay .",
    "subsequently , the creation and measurement of a superposition of quantum states using stimulated raman adiabatic passage in a tripod have been proposed and demonstrated @xcite .",
    "simultaneous enhancement and suppression of a dark resonance have been observed by nondegenerate four - wave mixing in a solid in a tripod - like level configuration @xcite .",
    "large cross - phase modulation induced by interacting dark resonances in a tripod system of cold @xmath2rb has also been reported @xcite .",
    "tripod configurations with two probes and a common coupling beam have been studied in a variety of contexts  theoretically for the magneto - optical stern - gerlach effect @xcite , for the experimental demonstration of light storage at dual frequencies @xcite , in a proposal for all - optical quantum computation with efficient cross - phase modulation , and sensitive optical magnetometry @xcite , and experimentally for matched slow pulses using double eit in rb @xcite , and also for the study of nonlinear faraday effect in an inverted @xmath3 model in rb vapor @xcite .",
    "interacting dark resonances in tripod configurations with two coupling beams and a common probe have been used to obtain sub - doppler and subnatural narrowing of an absorption line , theoretically by goren _",
    "@xcite , and experimentally by gavra _",
    "_ in rb @xcite .",
    "a similar scheme has been suggested for applications in logic gates and sensitive optical switches @xcite .",
    "there are several such applications of controllable double dark resonances in four - level tripod systems , and there are not many experimental results on tripod systems reported in the literature so far . in this context , we wish to probe a simple system of @xmath0he * at room temperature .",
    "this medium has been shown to be an ideal candidate for achieving ultra - narrow ( less than 10 khz ) eit in a three - level @xmath1-system involving only electronic spins in the presence of doppler broadening @xcite .",
    "we have confirmed the true nature of the two - photon process of eit by our observation of asymmetric doppler - averaged fano - like transmission profiles in the presence of single - photon optical detunings .",
    "@xmath0he * has some peculiar favorable properties : ( i ) velocity - changing collisions enable us to span the entire doppler profile @xcite .",
    "( ii ) the absence of nuclear spin simplifies the level scheme and eliminates the need for repumping lasers compensating for losses into the other ground state hyperfine levels .",
    "( iii ) diffusive motion increases the transit time of the atoms through the laser beam and hence the raman coherence life - time .",
    "( iv ) collisions with the ground state atoms do not depolarize the colliding @xmath0he*. thus there are no background atoms to contribute to noise .",
    "( v ) penning ionization among identically polarized @xmath0he * atoms is almost forbidden @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "we show that @xmath0he * is a suitable candidate for realizing a clean four - level tripod system in a room - temperature gas .",
    "the excited state 2@xmath4 ( @xmath5 = 0 , @xmath6 ) of @xmath0he * can be coupled selectively to the 2@xmath7 sublevels , @xmath8 = @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) , 0 ( @xmath11 ) and + 1 ( @xmath12 ) , by co - propagating laser beams at around 1083 nm , with @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 polarizations , respectively .",
    "the energy separation between the 2@xmath4 and the next lower sublevel 2@xmath16 is large ( 29.6 ghz ) compared to the doppler width ( @xmath17 1 ghz ) , allowing one to ensure that each transition is isolated .",
    "this is not the case , for example , in rb @xcite .",
    "we focus on two different tripod configurations based on the interaction of the atoms with linearly polarized coupling and probe beams in the presence of a horizontal transverse magnetic field . in the first case ,",
    "the probe beam has vertical linear ( v ) polarization and the coupling beam has horizontal linear ( h ) polarization , while in the second case , the probe beam has h - polarization and the coupling beam has v - polarization .",
    "we can easily switch from one configuration to the other by just a change in the orientation of a wave - plate used in the set - up .",
    "the difference in the configurations comes from the number of probe transitions used , yielding a distinctive interplay of double dark resonances in each case . with @xmath0he * at room temperature , using a weak magnetic field and polarization selective transitions mentioned above , we experimentally realize a tripod configuration with two probed transitions in the first case , and observe that the double dark resonances add incoherently , as there is no coherence between the two populated probe ground levels .",
    "this configuration serves as a useful reference for the second configuration studied with two coupling transitions . in the second case ,",
    "double dark resonances are related to coherent population trapping in the ground states . as the number of excited states is less than the number of ground states , transfer of coherence does not play any role @xcite .",
    "thus these double dark resonances are not stimulated raman peaks @xcite but detuned eit peaks , interfering destructively with each other leading to an absorption dip in - between for non - zero magnetic fields .",
    "we model the system successfully and verify our experimental results .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii",
    ", we describe the experimental set - up . in sec.iii , we present the experimental results and compare them with our numerical simulations for the two different tripod configurations .",

    "the cell is placed in a three - layer @xmath18-metal shield to isolate the system from the earth s magnetic field inhomogeneities .",
    "helium atoms are excited to the metastable state by an rf discharge at 27 mhz .",
    "we use the 2@xmath19 transition of @xmath0he * ( @xmath20 line ) with the coupling and probe beams derived from a single laser at nearly 1082.9 nm wavelength ( linewidth @xmath21 10 mhz ) , with a beam diameter of 1 cm after the telescope .",
    "the maximum available power for the coupling beam is about 27 mw , which is large enough due to the fact that the saturation intensity in @xmath0he * is very low ( 0.167 mw/@xmath22 ) .",
    "a probe power of 100 @xmath18w has been used throughout .",
    "the frequencies and intensities of the coupling and probe beams are adjusted by the amplitudes and the frequencies of the rf signals driving the acousto - optic modulators aom-1 and aom-2 . in our experiment , a variable weak magnetic field ( b ) , generated by a pair of rectangular coils surrounding the helium cell , removes the degeneracy of the lower sublevels .",
    "these coils are able to produce a constant horizontal magnetic field perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the laser beams .",

    "this eit peak can be explained by the following change of basis , which is a simple example of morris - shore transformation @xcite : replace the two sublevels @xmath96 and @xmath97 by the usual dark ( @xmath129 ) and bright ( @xmath130 ) states for the cpt in a three - level system ( @xmath131 , @xmath97 and @xmath6 ) for the coupling beams . since the transition @xmath132 is not allowed , we have essentially obtained a three - level system ( @xmath133 , @xmath62 and @xmath6 ) with a probe and a coupling beam .",
    "hence we observe a single eit peak at the line center .",
    "the widths and heights of the eit windows increase with the coupling power .    when we apply a weak transverse magnetic field ,",
    "the degeneracy of the lower levels is removed . in this case ,",
    "two dark resonance peaks appear and they shift from the zero detuning position with increasing magnetic field .",
    "the separation between the two dark resonances varies linearly with the applied magnetic field .",
    "the double dark resonance can not be explained in terms of transfer of coherence from the excited level to the ground level @xcite but these dark resonances are two eit peaks at @xmath134 . when the coupling power is increased in the presence of the magnetic field",
    ", an absorption line appears , much narrower and deeper than that found in the first configuration , which is the signature of an interference phenomenon between the two induced eit windows @xcite .",
    "this is the main result of this paper .",
    "it is visible in both the experimental data and in simulations that these eit peaks are asymmetric at 10 and 22 mw coupling powers : the absorption dip walls are sharper than the external transparency window lines .",
    "although it is well known that eit profiles become asymmetric when the coupling beam is optically detuned , the optical detuning given by the zeeman shift can not explain such a shape : indeed , the detuning in our case is less than 100 khz while hundreds of mhz are necessary to obtain any significant asymmetry in our system @xcite . when comparing these profiles with the ones obtained with the first configuration ( see fig.[vprobe ] ) , one notices here that the double peak transmissions are much higher .",
    "for the two values of the zeeman shift used and at high enough coupling powers ( 10 and 22 mw ) , the transmissions are nearly as large as the transmission of the single peak recorded without any magnetic field : transmissions seem to be given by the total rabi frequency @xmath108 while the widths are much narrower than the width expected with such a coupling intensity .",
    "the resulting very deep absorption line seems to narrow with increasing coupling power instead of disappearing because of saturation .",
    "this is very different from the first case , where the transmissions corresponding to 80 khz of zeeman shift remain roughly half the transmission of this single peak , and the saturation broadening makes the dip disappear for 50 khz of zeeman shift .",
    "we have checked that an incoherent addition of susceptibilities or transmissions would give a behavior similar to the first case and can not explain the data recorded in the second configuration : the absorption dip appearing at the line center is narrower and deeper than is possible by adding two independent best - fit eit profiles .",
    "a common picture for eit in three - level systems is to consider that it is the result of interference between two absorption paths , a direct absorption from the probed level , and the other which is followed by induced emission and reabsorption by the coupling beam . in our tripod configuration , there can be emission and reabsorption with both @xmath56 and @xmath57coupling beams .",
    "the constructive or destructive nature of this interference mechanism depends on the signs of the superpositions in the two dark states corresponding to the two three - level systems . in our case , the components of the coupling beam lead to opposite signs for the @xmath135 and @xmath136 transition amplitudes . as a result",
    ", there is a destructive interference between two eit peaks at the center and we observe a sharp absorption dip , looking like ( but different in nature from ) eia @xcite , flanked by two eit ( detuned ) peaks @xcite .",
    "it is clear from fig.[hprobe ] that for fixed magnetic fields , the widths and heights of all the eit windows increase while the width of the absorption dip decreases with increasing coupling power ( the full - widths at half - maxima of the absorption dips are about 47 , 42 and 34 khz , for coupling powers of 1 , 10 and 22 mw , respectively , at b = 10 mg ) . in the absence of the magnetic field",
    ", the narrow absorption dip disappears and the system becomes transparent at the line center .",
    "we have been able to carve out a clean four - level tripod system in a simple system of room - temperature @xmath0he * using a weak magnetic field and polarization - selective transitions .",
    "interesting interplay between the double dark resonances has been recorded .    in the first tripod configuration with",
    "two probed transitions , when the coupling is parallel to the weak magnetic field , we have observed that two eit ( detuned ) add incoherently , and for large coupling power , these two peaks merge into a single eit like peak at the line center .",
    "such a double - eit configuration has potential application in light storage for two frequencies @xcite and coupling - induced switch in the presence of a small magnetic field .    in the second tripod configuration with two coupling transitions ,",
    "when the probe is parallel to the weak magnetic field , we have observed a remarkable destructive interference between the two eit peaks , leading to an extra , narrow absorption peak in - between the eit peaks .",
    "the absorption feature is seen to become narrower with increasing coupling power and could be made subnatural even in the presence of doppler broadening @xcite .",
    "we stress here that our results , shown in fig.[hprobe ] , can not be obtained from two independent eit systems , even if one allows for asymmetric eit windows resulting from detuned ( by a few tens of khz ) coupling fields .",
    "the absorption dip appearing at the line center is narrower and deeper than is possible by adding two independent asymmetric eit fits .",
    "the separation between the observed eit peaks is determined by the applied magnetic field .",
    "such a system may be used as a magnetometer , although the field values used by us are rather high .",
    "the shape of the resonances , however , depends critically on the direction of the magnetic field , making the sensor anisotropic . for known directions of the magnetic field",
    ", the symmetry of the system offers a specific advantage based on measurements of _ differences _ in frequencies @xcite . in the absence of the magnetic field",
    ", the narrow absorption maximum disappears and the system becomes transparent at the line center .",
    "it thus has the potential to be used as a magneto - optic switch , with pulsed operation .",
    "we have successfully modeled the system . for mixed polarizations of the coupling and the probe along the quantization axis ,",
