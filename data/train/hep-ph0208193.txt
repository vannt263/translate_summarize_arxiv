    "the super - kamiokande experiments  @xcite in the past several years , joined by sno  @xcite more recently , have given strong indications of neutrino oscillation that are corroborated and constrained by a variety of other experiments .",
    "these experiments started a new era in the study of neutrino physics and offered the best indication to date of physics beyond the standard model . to further probe neutrino physics , there are a number of ongoing and planned neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "these experiments promise to give a full description of the phenomenology of neutrino mixing .",
    "the most attractive experiments among the new generation of neutrino oscillation experiments are the long baseline ( lbl ) experiments .",
    "they are performed in the controlled environment of traditional experimental high energy physics and expected to allow precision measurements of the oscillation parameters , including the leptonic @xmath0 phase .",
    "notably , the recently approved superbeam facility , the high intensity proton accelerator ( hipa )  @xcite , which can provide intensive high energy neutrino beams from its 50 gev proton synchrotron , offers the possibility of even more desirable lbl experiments .",
    "so far , the possibility of two lbl experiments using the hipa superbeam have been discussed .",
    "one is hipa to kamiokande at a baseline length of about 300  km  @xcite known as j2k , and the other is hipa to a detector located 2100 km away near beijing  @xcite called h2b .",
    "it is well - known that there are parameter ambiguities that are generally associated with oscillation measurements at a single baseline@xcite .",
    "measurements at more than one baseline can be beneficial  @xcite ; our previous studies  @xcite showed that the joint analysis of the j2k and h2b experiments can offer extra leverages to resolve some of these ambiguities .",
    "our results , however , also showed that @xmath0 violation effects can not be determined at 3@xmath7 level even with the joint analysis considered in the study , in which no antineutrino beams were used .    since the leptonic @xmath0 phase and mass  squared difference sign are pertinent information in the physics of neutrino mixings , which seems to be very different from that of the quark sector , it is necessary to find out how to pin down these neutrino mixing parameters accurately in new experiments .",
    "it has been widely recognized that the neutrino factory  @xcite is an ideal facility for the study of neutrino mixings . however , because of the technical and budgetary challenges faced with building a workable neutrino factory in the near future , and because of the availability of a conventional superbeam from hipa in about five years , it is obviously advisable that we explore the full potential of the hipa superbeams . in this work ,",
    "we examine in further detail the measurement of the @xmath0 phase and the mass  squared difference sign from the joint analysis at the two long baselines with specific hipa superbeams and more suitable detectors .",
    "the neutrino beams are the 2-degree off - axis superbeams for the lbl at 300 km and a narrow band superbeam for vlbl at 2100 km .",
    "we evaluate the event rates and investigate their sensitivities to the @xmath0 phase and the sign of @xmath8 .",
    "taking into account all possible experimental errors , we find that a fairly precise measurement of the @xmath0 phase , the sign of the mass  squared difference and the mixing angle @xmath9 is possible but requires : ( 1 ) the joint analysis at the two baselines ; ( 2 ) that both a @xmath10 beam and a @xmath11 beam are needed at 300 km ; ( 3 ) that a @xmath11 beam is needed at 2100 km if @xmath8 is negative ; and ( 4 ) a significant increase in the statistics at both 300 km and 2100 km .",
    "we find that @xmath12 can be probed to very small values , depending on the value of the @xmath0 phase .    in sec .",
    "ii we describe how the simulations are performed . in sec .",
    "iii our results are presented .",
    "a brief discussion and conclusion can be found in sec .",
    "our oscillation analyses will be restricted to 3 flavors of active neutrinos .",
    "the parameters of the system consists of 2 mass  squared differences ( msd ) , 3 mixing angles and 1 measurable @xmath0 phase .",
    "the unitary mixing matrix in the vacuum is parameterized as usual @xmath13 where @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 , @xmath17 defined for @xmath18 are the mixing angles of mass eigenstates @xmath19 and @xmath20 , and @xmath1 is the @xmath0 phase angle .",
    "the three mass eigenvalues are denoted as @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 .",
    "the two independent msd are @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the inputs of the mixing angles and msd s are obtained from solar , atmospheric and reactor experiments : @xmath26 note that the sign of @xmath8 is unknown .",
    "the currently favored large mixing angle solar solution requires @xmath27 .    in lbl experiments the neutrino beam interacts with electrons contained in earth matter  @xcite . in the present study we use the preliminary reference earth model  @xcite , generally known as prem , for earth density profiles  @xcite and numerically integrate the schrdinger equation that descibes the propagation of the neutrino in matter for the treatment of distance dependent matter density",
    "however , we note that there exist more sophisticated approaches to earth matter effect , including both an updated average density profile known as the ak135  @xcite and treatments of uncertainties of the density profile  @xcite which can affected the determination of the @xmath0 phase angle",
    ".      the hipa 50 gev proton synchrotron beam calls for a power of 0.77 mw in phase i , to be upgraded to 4 mw in phase ii . the superbeam provided by hipa can be a wide band beam ( wbb ) , a pulsed narrow band beam ( nbb ) , or an off - axis beam ( oab ) .",
    "the wbb contains neutrinos with widely distributed energy . in a nbb",
    "the neutrino flux is concentrated in a narrow range of energies , with maximum energy @xmath28 where the intensity is peaked , and the intensity decreases rapidly below @xmath28 .",
    "an oab also peaks at a certain energy , but has a longer high - energy tail than that of a nbb .",
    "more details of the various beam profiles can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . for the 2100 km baseline",
    "we use a nbb  @xcite with peak energy of 4 gev .",
    "we have also investigated the beams of peak energies of 5 , 6 and 8 gev , but found that the 4 gev beam gives the best results . for 300 km",
    "we use the 2-degree oab ( 2@xmath29oab ) which has a peak energy at 0.8 gev  @xcite .    the detector at 2100 km is assumed to be a water cerenkov calorimeter with resistive plate chambers  @xcite located in beijing , tentatively called the beijing astrophysics and neutrino detector ( band ) .",
    "the size of the detector will be 100 kt at the beginning and can be upgraded to a much larger one depending on the physics requirements .",
    "the detector at 300 km is initially the kamiokande detector of the present size of 22.5 kt and upgraded later to 450 kt .      for the experimental errors we use 3@xmath7 throughout this work .",
    "all independent errors , statistical and systematic , are added in quadrature . for the statistical error we used @xmath30 poisson errors as described in the appendix of ref .",
    "@xcite , including a background at the 1% level of the rate of the survival channel . for the systematic error we assumed that the background is known at the 2% level as given in  @xcite . to estimate the error due to the uncertainty in the measurement of the mixing angle @xmath31",
    ", we assumed that @xmath32 is measured via the survival channel at @xmath33  km , with the event rate given by @xmath34 , where @xmath35 and @xmath36 is the number of events in the absence of oscillations .",
    "then the statistical uncertainty on @xmath32 is @xmath37 we then find the variation in the rate in question for a 3@xmath7 deviation in @xmath31 , and added this in quadrature to the other 3@xmath7 errors described above to obtain the total 3@xmath7 error .",
    "we consider three scenarios in the present investigation .",
    "the scenarios are summarized in table  1 .",
    "for scenario i the first stage involves a 5-year experiment with a water cerenkov detector of 22.5 kt at 300 km with the 2@xmath29oab @xmath10 beam  @xcite from hipa at 0.77 mw .",
    "this stage is contained in the plan of j2k  @xcite .",
    "the second stage of this scenario has hipa upgraded to 4 mw , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , to deliver a nbb @xmath10 beam to the water cerenkov detector of 100 kt at l=2100 km to run for 5 years .",
    "scenario ii has an upgraded 4 mw hipa and calls for both @xmath10 and @xmath11 beams .",
    "the experiment at 2100 km is the same as in scenario i. for 300 km , however , we assume a much larger water cerenkov detector of 450 kt .",
    "it will run for 2 years with 2@xmath29oab @xmath10 beam , and then 6 years with the 2@xmath29oab @xmath38 beam .",
    "scenario iii is similar to scenario ii , but calls for a much larger water cerenkov detector at 2100 km , to run either the @xmath39 or @xmath40 beam , for example , for 5000 kt - yr .",
    "whether a @xmath41 or @xmath11 beam is delivered to the 2100  km site depends on the sign of @xmath3 , as will be explained below .",
    "let us first describe briefly the strategy of our calculation .",
    "there are 6 measurable oscillation parameters in the 3-flavor neutrino scheme .",
    "there are two mass scales ; one is the atmospheric scale and the other the solar scale .",
    "existing oscillation experiments have determined that the two mass scales are widely separated and therefore sensitive to different @xmath42 regions .",
    "the lbl and vlbl we are considering are affected by the solar scale only at next  to  leading order , but can be strongly affected by the unknown parameters @xmath43 and @xmath9 . hence we will take @xmath44 and @xmath45 to be the values determined in solar experiments , as given in eq .",
    "( [ input12 ] ) .",
    "this leaves 4 parameters to be determined , but @xmath46 and @xmath31 are known already to a fair degree of accuracy from atmospheric neutrino experiments . therefore obtaining @xmath9 , @xmath1 , and",
    "the sign of @xmath3 is the main goal of our calculation .",
    "the current and soon to be online lbl experiments will determine @xmath46 and @xmath32 to a better accuracy ; @xmath47 and @xmath48 will be measured more precisely by kamland  @xcite .",
    "the first task of the scenarios we propose is to determine @xmath49 and @xmath32 more accurately , using the @xmath39 survival probability .",
    "this will allow us to have as small an uncertainty as possible in the determination of the parameters @xmath9 and @xmath43 .",
    "let us define @xmath50 as the number of charge ",
    "current events involving the @xmath51 charged lepton at the baseline @xmath52 .",
    "we assume that @xmath53 , which depends on the @xmath39 survival probability , is used to determine @xmath54 and @xmath31 with as small an error as possible .",
    "then in the various scenarios @xmath55 can not be used to determine @xmath9 and @xmath43 .",
    "= 300 km with better statistics are made , the improved @xmath55 will be used to update the values of @xmath54 and @xmath31 . ]      in this scenario we assume that only the @xmath10 beam is employed to run at @xmath52=300 km and 2100 km . since @xmath55 has already been used to determine @xmath54 and @xmath32 , we are left with three types of independent measurements for the determination of @xmath9 , @xmath1 and the sign of @xmath8 : @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "the measurements of these three types of events form a surface in a three - dimensional space when @xmath9 and @xmath43 are varied in their allowed ranges .",
    "the angle @xmath9 is constrained by the chooz reactor experiment  @xcite and the @xmath0 phase is completely unconstrained .",
    "therefore , we take their ranges to be : @xmath59 and @xmath60 ) .",
    "such three  dimensional surfaces , which are tube  like , are displayed in fig .",
    "the upper and lower surfaces are for negative and positive @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "the closed curves around the axes of the tubes are traced out by varying @xmath1 from @xmath61 to @xmath62 , while the lines running parallel to the axes of the tubes are determined by varying @xmath12 from @xmath63 to @xmath64 . for fixed @xmath12 values ,",
    "we then obtain the ellipses in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .",
    "when @xmath56 , the number of the @xmath65 appearance events at 300 km , is measured , it determines a closed curve which is obtained from the three - dimensional surface by a cut at a given value on the @xmath56 axis .",
    "the value of @xmath56 does not determine @xmath9 directly since @xmath66 is unknown ; for each of the closed curves we obtain a definite relation between @xmath66 and @xmath12 when the sign of @xmath8 is given . we show in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] two sets of such relations for each @xmath3 sign .",
    "as shown , we choose two extreme values of @xmath56 , each of which leads to a range of values for @xmath12 , depending on the sign of @xmath3 . for positive @xmath3 , the larger @xmath56 curve limits @xmath12 to the range ( @xmath67 ) , while the smaller one corresponds to @xmath12 lying in the range ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "similarly , the ranges of the values of @xmath12 for negative @xmath3 can be read off from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] .",
    "we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] the two - dimensional curves with fixed @xmath56 .",
    "note that the scale of the horizontal axis is logarithmic .",
    "if the scale was linear , the curves would be ellipses .",
    "an open square indicates the point on a curve with @xmath1=0@xmath29 , solid square 90@xmath29 , open circle 180@xmath29 , and solid circle 270@xmath29 .",
    "we also show a representative 3@xmath7 error bar for each curve .",
    "the assignment of statistical and systematic errors has been discussed in the preceding section .",
    "the total error is dominated mostly by the statistical error .",
    "one sees that although the sign of @xmath8 can be determined at the 3@xmath7 level , there is no sensitivity to the value of the @xmath0 phase .",
    "in particular , the error in the @xmath69 channel is very large in comparison with the range of variation in the number of events when @xmath1 varies ; we will encounter similar situation in the next scenario .      by including the @xmath11 beam aimed at the detector at 300  km , we have two more types of events , i.e. , @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "so , in addition to the three - dimensional surface in the @xmath56-@xmath57-@xmath58 space shown earlier in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we also have surfaces in the spaces @xmath56-@xmath71-@xmath72 and @xmath56-@xmath71-@xmath57 , as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig5 ] and [ fig8 ] , respectively . with several fixed values of @xmath12",
    "we obtain the curves shown in figs .",
    "[ fig6 ] and [ fig9 ] .",
    "we plot the two - dimensional projections of fixed @xmath56=1000 and 10000 in figs .",
    "[ fig7 ] and [ fig10 ] .",
    "we found in scenario  i that the 2100 km data with just a @xmath39 source can determine the sign of @xmath8 at 3@xmath7 , but can not measure the @xmath0 phase ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "in contrast , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , the 300 km data using both a @xmath41 and @xmath70 source can determine the @xmath0 phase in the ranges ( @xmath73 ) or ( @xmath74 ) , but can not distinguish between the two ranges since the measurement is only sensitive to @xmath75 . furthermore , unless @xmath43 is close to @xmath76 or @xmath77 the sign of @xmath8 can not be determined once all of the experimental errors , including the error in the determination of @xmath31 , are taken into account , leaving a four - fold ambiguity . the problem lies in the fact that @xmath78 is used ; as already noted in scenario i , survival data provide poor resolution to the @xmath0 phase , and the matter effect is small at the relatively short distance of 300  km .",
    "six more three - dimensional plots which will contain either @xmath72 , or @xmath69 , or both , can be made , but they are not very useful in the present analysis because they involve the survival data .    in order to obtain good resolution in the sign of the msd and to distinguish the two ranges of the @xmath0 phase as discussed in the preceding section , we have to use data of the electron flavor only .",
    "hence we need two experiments with different @xmath42 ratios and one of them should be a vlbl for a good sensitivity to the matter effect .",
    "this brings us to the combined analysis of @xmath56 , @xmath71 and @xmath57 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] .",
    "the sign of @xmath8 can be easily determined if @xmath12 is not too small and the @xmath0 phase can be measured with again the ambiguity between the two ranges ( @xmath73 ) and ( @xmath74 ) , as in the case of fig .",
    "the problem lies in the fact that the resolution in @xmath57 is poor due to the low number of events , while the resolution of the 300 km @xmath79 is excellent .",
    "so we have to increase the statistics at 2100 km .",
    "this takes us to scenario iii below .",
    "the situation of scenario ii can be improved if the statistics in @xmath57 are significantly increased .",
    "this can be achieved by using a larger detector and/or running for a longer period of time for the @xmath57 measurement . for scenario",
    "iii we set the detector size times the running time at @xmath52=2100 km to be 10 times larger than that of scenario ii , assuming that the number of events can be straightforwardly scaled up with the detector size .",
    "the running at 300 km is the same as in scenario  ii .",
    "the resultant two - dimensional plot is shown fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] . in this scenario ,",
    "the sign of @xmath8 can be clearly determined at the 3@xmath7 level , even for @xmath56=1000 which corresponds to a very small @xmath12 lying in the range ( @xmath68 ) , as indicated by the dotted curves in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] .",
    "if @xmath8 is positive , a reasonably accurate determination of @xmath43 can be made with no sgn(@xmath8 ) or @xmath9 ambiguity , and the @xmath11 beam is not needed at 2100 km even for very small @xmath12 in the range ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "this is consistent with the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was found that a @xmath80 and @xmath81 measurement at short distance and a @xmath80 measurement at a long distance could resolve parameter ambiguities for @xmath82 . to see the sensitivity more clearly for positive @xmath8 , we replot the results in figs .",
    "[ fig12 ] and [ fig13 ] respectively for @xmath56=10000 and 1000 .",
    "we see that for @xmath83 , which corresponds to larger @xmath12 ( @xmath84 ) as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , the @xmath0 phase can be determined better than 10@xmath29 at 3@xmath7 for @xmath1 small or around 180@xmath29 .",
    "the sensitivity deteriorates slowly when @xmath43 moves away from @xmath85 or @xmath86 , and the uncertainty becomes of the order of 25@xmath29 when @xmath1 is close to 90@xmath29 or 270@xmath29 .    even for @xmath56=1000 , which corresponds to very small @xmath12 in the range of ( @xmath68 ) ,",
    "the measurement of the @xmath0 phase is still reasonably good .",
    "it is interesting to note that the sensitivity of the @xmath0 measurement near @xmath87=0@xmath29 and 180@xmath29 for @xmath88 is comparable to that of the much higher number of events of @xmath56=10000 .",
    "hence , in this scenario , either case can establish whether or not @xmath0 in the lepton sector is violated if @xmath1 deviates by than 10@xmath29 from the @xmath0 conserving points of @xmath87=0@xmath29 or 180@xmath29 .",
    "if @xmath8 is negative , the @xmath89 oscillation is the favorable channel to investigate . hence once it is clear that @xmath3 is negative ( see the next section for a detailed discussion ) , the @xmath11 beam should be delivered to 2100 km to run for 5000 kt - yr .",
    "the results , which are the counterparts to fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig14 ] . with positron events at 2100 km the @xmath0 phase can be well measured . to see the sensitivity more clearly , we replot the results in figs .  [ fig15 ] and [ fig16 ] for @xmath56=10000 and 1000 respectively .",
    "the accuracy of the @xmath43 measurement for @xmath90 using the @xmath40 beam is about the same as that of the @xmath39 beam for @xmath91 , although the distinction between @xmath43 in the range ( @xmath74 ) and @xmath43 in the range ( @xmath73 ) is not as good for a @xmath40 beam with @xmath90 .",
    "we have also done the analysis assuming a @xmath41 or @xmath70 nbb of peak energy 5 , 6 , or 8  gev is delivered to the detector at 2100  km .",
    "we found that for these cases the ellipses in figs .",
    "[ fig11 ] to [ fig15 ] are much flatter than for the 4  gev nbb , so that they do not do as well in resolving the degeneracy in @xmath43 .",
    "we conclude that with a superbeam , such as that delivered by hipa , the joint analysis at two baselines , of which one is an lbl at 300 km and the other a vlbl at 2100 km , can determine the @xmath8 sign and give a reasonably precise measurement of the @xmath0 phase and @xmath9 . to achieve this ,",
    "both @xmath39 and @xmath40 beams are needed for the lbl experiment .",
    "the survival events @xmath92 and @xmath93 are generally insensitive to the matter and @xmath0 effects .    the initial hipa @xmath39 beam with power 0.77 mw will run with exposure 22.5@xmath945 kt - yr at a detector at @xmath52=300 km to obtain both survival events @xmath53 and appearance events @xmath56 .",
    "the former is used to improve the determination of the mixing angle @xmath31 and mass  squared difference @xmath95 , so as to reduce the uncertainty of these crucial input parameters .",
    "the latter can show the existence of an appearance signal for @xmath96 and find a crude relation between @xmath43 and @xmath9 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] .",
    "a detailed determination of the oscillation parameters will require an upgrade of the hipa beam power to 4  mw .",
    "using our studies in this paper as a guide , we suggest as one possibility the following experimental steps using the upgraded hipa beam : 1ex    * stage 1 * : deliver a 4  mw @xmath41 2@xmath29oab to a 450  kt detector at a distance of @xmath52=300  km for 2 years .",

    "the data can only determine @xmath43 and @xmath100 up to a 2-fold degeneracy because of the poor separation between @xmath66 and @xmath101 in the @xmath78 measurement , as demonstrated in fig .",
