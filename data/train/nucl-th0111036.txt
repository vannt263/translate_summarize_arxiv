    "microscopic calculations using the effective nucleon - nucleon interaction proposed by gogny have been shown to reproduce in very satisfactory way a variety of nuclear properties over a wide range of proton and neutron numbers @xcite .",
    "for instance , binding energies , separation energies of one or two nucleons and charge and neutron mean square radii usually agree quite well with known experimental data . in view of this",
    ", it seems appropriate to use theoretical results obtained in such a framework to derive systematics of nuclear properties that could be useful for making predictions concerning nuclear species or aspects of nuclear structure no yet known as neutron distribution radii or binding energies of superheavy nuclei .    in the present work ,",
    "simple formulas are used in order to represent the binding energies and the charge , proton and neutron root - mean - square ( r.m.s . )",
    "radii obtained in hfb calculations with the gogny force , and they are compared with existing phenomenological formulas .",
    "our aim is to determine simple but realistic enough parametrizations that would avoid performing time - consuming microscopic calculations when only rough estimates of the binding energies or radii are needed .",
    "some preliminary results have already been published in @xcite , for a smaller number of nuclei however .",
    "section  [ sect2 ] presents a short overview of the theoretical models used in this work .",
    "section  [ sect3 ] explains how the basis parameters employed in the self - consistent calculations have been determined . in section  [ sect4 ] ,",
    "the results concerning the single particle levels schemes of representative isotonic and isotopic chains are analysed .",
    "section  [ sect5 ] gives the method used to substract the neutron and proton shell and pairing corrections from the hfb energy .",
    "the `` macroscopic gogny energy '' obtained in this way is then parametrized by means of a liquid - drop like formula  @xcite . in section  [ sect6 ] , systematics of the mass ,",
    "charge , proton and neutron radii and of the ratios of proton to neutron radii are presented .",
    "simple isospin- and mass number - dependent parametrizations of these quantities are determined , which appear in excellent agreement with those derived using the relativistic mean field method @xcite . the formula obtained for the deformation - independent ratios of proton to neutron r.m.s .",

    "the gogny density - dependent effective nucleon - nucleon force is of the following form  @xcite : @xmath2^\\gamma + v_{\\rm coul } \\,\\ , , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which represents a central finite range interaction , a zero - range spin - orbit term and a zero - range density dependent interaction , respectively , to which one has to add the coulomb interaction in the case of protons .",
    "the central interaction is made up of two distinct gaussians with ranges @xmath3 and @xmath4 whose values are given below . @xmath5 and @xmath6 denote the spin and isospin exchange operators respectively , and @xmath7 represents the total density .",
    "+ we use the gogny d1s @xcite interaction the parameters of which are given below : @xmath8 when pairing correlations are neglected , the hfb approach reduces to the hartree - fock ( hf ) method which determines a self - consistent approximation of the nuclear mean - field .",
    "the corresponding ground state energy @xmath9 includes a contribution @xmath10 from shell effects which can be evaluated by applying the strutinsky smearing procedure @xcite to the hf single - particle level distribution .",
    "the remaining part of @xmath9 can be considered as a macroscopic , liquid- drop like contribution @xmath11 . denoting by @xmath12 the hf proton or neutron single - particle energies , the strutinsky shell correction energy @xmath10 is : @xmath13 where @xmath11 is the smoothed energy @xmath14 with the strutinsky prescription , the smoothed density @xmath15 is given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the fermi energy , @xmath18 the strutinsky ( 6@xmath19 order ) curvature correction polynomial and @xmath20 the width over which smoothing of the single particle level scheme is performed .",
    "the reliability of this procedure requires that @xmath10 displays a plateau when drawn as a function of @xmath20 , separately for protons and neutrons .",
    "a crucial parameter in this respect is the number of single particle levels taken into account in the evaluation of the shell correction .",
    "this problem will be discussed in section  [ sect5 ] .",
    "subtracting from the hartree - fock energy the shell correction energies of neutrons @xmath21 and of protons @xmath22 , one gets the following estimate of the macroscopic part of the binding energy : @xmath23    another correction to the macroscopic part of the binding energy is the contribution @xmath24 of pairing correlations .",
    "this correction has been calculated for each nucleus by taking the difference between the energy @xmath25 obtained in a full hfb calculation with the gogny force and the energy @xmath9 computed using the simple hf method : @xmath26    the obtained r.m.s .",
    "radii of the neutron , proton , charge and mass density distributions are obtained in the microscopic hfb calculations in the usual way . in deformed nuclei , these different radii contain the effect of the quadrupole and other deformations @xcite .",
    "however , the ratios of proton to neutron radii are almost deformation - independent since the proton and neutron density distributions are very similarly deformed .",
    "starting from the hfb mean square radii @xmath27 , equivalent spherical liquid - drop radii @xmath28 can be defined through the expression : @xmath29 which follows from the formula giving the mean square radius of a uniform spherical density distribution of radius @xmath28 : @xmath30    these equivalent radii have then been fitted to a three parameter formula , with explicit isospin and @xmath31 dependence @xmath32 similar to the formula used in ref .",
    "@xcite in the analysis of the radii obtained from relativistic mean field calculations . as the ratios of the proton and neutron r.m.s .",
    "radii are almost deformation independent , they could be well approximated by the following formula depending only on the numbers of protons and neutrons : @xmath33 this last relation , together with the effect of the non - point like charge distribution of the proton evaluated with the approximate formula : @xmath34 can be useful for estimating the neutron radius of a nucleus when its r.m.s .",
    "charge radius @xmath35 is known : @xmath36",
    "the nuclei studied in the present work are represented by crosses and dots in the ( @xmath1,@xmath0 ) plot of fig .",
    "these are the nuclei close to magic proton and neutron numbers and along the @xmath37-stability line whose ground states are expected to be spherical @xcite .",
    "they include ca , sr , sn , sm , pb and th isotopes , the @xmath1=50 , 82 and 126 isotone chains between the proton and neutron drip lines and a few @xmath37-stable spherical nuclei between @xmath38 and @xmath39 .    in the microscopic hf and hfb calculations , the self - consistent equations have been solved in matrix form by expanding the single particle or quasiparticle states on finite bases made of spherical harmonic oscillator ( ho ) eigenfunctions .",
    "these bases depend on two parameters : the number @xmath40 of major ho shells included in the bases and the oscillator parameter @xmath41 .    in the present study , bases with @xmath40=12 , 14 , 16 or 18 major shells",
    "have been taken into account , depending on the nucleus under study , the criterium being that @xmath40 is large enough to ensure convergence of the hfb energy ( @xmath42 ) within a few kev .",
    "for each nucleus and each value of @xmath40 , the parameter @xmath41 has been chosen as the value @xmath43 that minimizes the hf energy @xmath44 .",
    "the values of @xmath43 obtained for ca , sn and pb isotopes , and for the @xmath1=126 isotones are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] as a function of @xmath31 for @xmath40=14 , a value of @xmath40 large enough for all these nuclei .",
    "the error bars indicate the ranges of @xmath41 for which the variation of @xmath9 does not exceed 100 kev .",
    "one can see that , with this number of ho shells , relatively large changes in @xmath41 do not significantly affect calculated values of @xmath9 .",
    "consequently , approximate analytical interpolation formulas can be used .    a large scale investigation of the values found in spherical nuclei shows that an interpolation formula such as : @xmath45 can be adopted for all even - even nuclei , with n and k depending on the number @xmath40 of shells included in the bases . in the present work , all the obtained values of @xmath43",
    "could be fitted with the values @xmath46=64.05 mev and @xmath47=-0.46 .",
    "a even more accurate interpolation formula , represented by the solid curve in fig .  [ fig2 ] , has been obtained for the specific set of nuclei for which @xmath48=14 is found to be a sufficiently large number : @xmath49 this formula gives a better agreement to calculated @xmath50 for the ca up to the pb isotopes and for the @xmath1=126 isotones .",
    "in order to better visualize the origin of shell effects in the nuclei considered in this work , the hartree - fock single - particle energies obtained with the gogny force are plotted in figs .",
    "[ fig3a ] , [ fig3b ] and  [ fig3c ] for neutrons ( left hand sides ) and protons ( right hand sides ) .",
    "the three figures correspond to @xmath1=50 , @xmath1=82 and @xmath1=126 isotones , respectively , and the levels are drawn as functions of the proton number @xmath0 .",
    "they are labelled with the usual radial quantum numbers @xmath46 , orbital angular momentum @xmath51 and total angular momentum @xmath52 .",
    "the numbers @xmath53 between the levels indicate the number of nucleons necessary to fill all the levels located below .",
    "one can see that , in addition to the magic shells corresponding to @xmath53= 20 , 28 , 50 , 82 , 126 and 184 , well - marked subshells appear depending on the number of neutrons @xmath1 . for instance , subshells with @xmath53=40 are clearly visible in the neutron and proton level schemes of the @xmath1=50 and @xmath1=82 isotones , and @xmath53=64 also appears as a subshell in the @xmath1=126 isotones .    in figs .",
    "[ fig4a ] to [ fig4f ] the neutron ( left hand sides ) and proton ( right hand sides ) single particle levels of the ca , sr , sn , sm , pb and th isotopes are plotted as functions of the neutron number @xmath1 .",
    "subshells corresponding to @xmath53=40 , 64 or 100 can also be observed in these figures besides the usual magic numbers @xmath53=50 , 82 , 126 , 184 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the magnitude of the proton and neutron @xmath53=50 shell gaps steadily decreases from @xmath54 6 mev down to @xmath54 4 mev as the proton number @xmath0 increases from 20 to 90 .",
    "this decrease does not occur in the case of the other magic numbers @xmath53=82 and @xmath53=126 .",
    "as explained in section [ sect2 ] , the hf single - particle levels shown in figs .  [ fig3a ] to [ fig4f ] have been used to separate hf binding energies into two components by means of strutinsky s method : a macroscopic part behaving smoothly as a function of @xmath31 and a shell correction reflecting the neutron and proton shells .",
    "the method of strutinsky is a subtle technique which demands a very careful choice of the number of single - particle states above the fermi level included in the smoothing procedure so as to obtain a plateau in the variations of the shell corrections with respect to the smoothing width @xmath20 . in particular , including too many single particle states with positive energies strongly affects the determination of the shell effects associated with occupied orbitals .",
    "this is so because single particle states with positive energies are obtained in the present microscopic approach as a discrete set whose energy spectrum and shell structure can strongly depend on the choice of basis parameters .",
    "for this reason , the hf single - particle proton and neutron levels included in the strutinsky smoothing procedure have been chosen in the following way : for lighter nuclei , a cut off in the single particle energy has been introduced , having the usual value @xmath55 , with @xmath17 the proton or neutron fermi energy and @xmath56 the average spacing between major shells .",
    "the number of single - particle levels taken into account in this way is of the order of 30 , with maximum energies 5 mev for neutrons and 15 mev for protons above the fermi level . in heavier nuclei ,",
    "the number of levels included in the smoothing procedure was increased to 50 , which corresponds to a cut - off in the single particle energies of the order of @xmath57 , _",
    "i.e. _ 15 mev for neutrons and 30mev for protons .",
    "these numbers have been found to provide a satisfactory stabilization of shell corrections in all the nuclei studied in this work .    in order to find a plateau in the variations of the shell correction with respect to the width @xmath20 appearing in eq .",
    "( [ rho ] ) , @xmath20 has been varied , taking as a scale the average shell spacing @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "in fact strutinsky calculations generally obtain a plateau in the shell correction energy of both protons and neutrons for @xmath20 in the vicinity of the traditional value @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "[ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] give examples of the variations with @xmath60 of the shell corrections obtained in the present work .",
    "similar behaviours are found in all the nuclei displayed in the ( @xmath1,@xmath0 ) plot of fig .",

    "[ fig5 ] , the neutron ( solid lines ) and proton ( dashed lines ) shell corrections of twelve @xmath1=82 isotones ranging from nd to pb are plotted as functions of @xmath60 . in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , the different curves represent the shell corrections for neutrons ( top ) and protons ( bottom ) calculated in @xmath1=82 ( left ) and @xmath1=126 ( right ) isotones .",
    "one can see that , except for a few cases , as the proton shell corrections in @xmath61yb and @xmath62dy , reasonable plateaus are always found around the value @xmath63 .",
    "the results shown in the next figures are those obtained with the latter value of the averaging width @xmath20 .    in the upper part of fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] the neutron and proton ( dashed lines ) , and total ( solid lines ) shell corrections are drawn as functions of @xmath31 for the ca up to th isotopes ( left ) , @xmath1=50 , 82 and 126 isotones ( center ) and @xmath37-stable nuclei ( right ) included in this study .",
    "the lower part of this figure displays the corresponding pairing corrections calculated from eqs .",
    "( [ pair ] ) .",
    "one observes that the variations of the shell corrections nicely reproduce the expected pattern , with minima located at magic proton and neutron numbers .",
    "neutron shell corrections are seen to be almost independent of the nucleus neutron number @xmath1 , as they should , and proton shell corrections are found practically independent of @xmath0 .",
    "the macroscopic energies ( [ macr ] ) obtained by subtracting the proton and neutron shell corrections from the hartree - fock energies @xmath9 for all the nuclei displayed in fig .  [ fig1 ] are represented by lines in the three upper plots of fig .",

    "the numerical parameters in this formula are in good agreement with those of myers and wiatecki ( m - s ) @xcite , except for the coefficient in the last term : 1.99 instead of 1.21 .",
    "this term represents the correction to the coulomb energy of a charge liquid drop that accounts for the diffuseness of the proton density distribution .",
    "the correction appears to be larger in the case of formula ( [ eld ] )   the difference with the equivalent m - s term reaches @xmath54 30 mev in @xmath66fm   , which compensates for the fact that the coulomb energy derived from the self - consistent results is larger than the m - s one .",
    "let us also note that the asymmetry coefficients in the volume and surface terms of ( [ eld ] )   the coefficients of @xmath67   are not equal , contrary to what is assumed in the m - s formula .",
    "on the other hand , the parameters appearing in ( [ eld ] ) are closer to those of the most recent best empirical fits -  where the whole set of presently known nuclear masses and fission barriers is used  - than to those of the various formulae derived from liquid drop models @xcite .",

    "( [ eld ] ) , the differences @xmath69 are displayed in the lower part of the figure , using an enlarged energy scale .",

    "the ratios of proton to neutron radii could be fitted with the parametrization : @xmath81 this parametrization again appears very close to those derived in the studies of refs .",
    "@xcite mentioned above .",
    "let us point out that the parametrization given by formula ( [ rporn ] ) , which has been established for the spherical nuclei shown in fig .

    "in this work , the results of self - consistent hfb calculations performed with the gogny effective interaction for several isotopic and isotonic chains of spherical nuclei have been analysed and compared with those given by phenomenological expressions and by the relativistic mean field approach . the more important conclusions that can be drawn from this analysis",

    "( [ eld ] ) , is in excellent agreement with the liquid - drop formula of myers and wiatecki ( m - s ) @xcite .",
    "the main difference occurs in the term correcting the charged liquid drop coulomb energy for the diffuseness of the proton density .",
    "also , the asymmetry coefficients in the volume and surface terms are found unequal , contrary to the m - s formula , and the reduced radius parameter @xmath86 is slightly smaller ( @xmath86 = 1.19 fm instead of @xmath86 = 1.205 fm ) . when all contributions are added , the differences between eq .",
