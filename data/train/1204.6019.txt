    "gives a residual @xmath143 .",
    "[ fig : potts ] ]      here we present a numerical estimate of the residual entropy of the 4-coloring model on the diamond lattice . since the color variables are defined on bonds of the diamond lattice , it is more convenient to consider an equivalent potts model on the pyrochlore lattice whose sites correspond to the bond midpoints in the diamond lattice ; see fig .  1 in the main text .",
    "for convenience , we shall use @xmath55 , @xmath144 to denote the diamond sites , and use @xmath145 , @xmath146 for the sites on pyrochlore lattice .",
    "a potts variable @xmath147 is assigned to each pyrochlore site such that the corresponding phase is given by @xmath148 , where @xmath149 is the global u(1 ) phase .",
    "the constraint that bonds attached to the same vertex have different colors translates to an antiferromagnetic interaction between nearest - neighbor potts variables on the pyrochlore lattice : @xmath150 here the coupling constant @xmath151 .",
    "to avoid confusion , we use @xmath152 to label the pyrochlore sites .",
    "the hard constraint of the 4-coloring model is recovered in the @xmath153 limit .",
    "consider first a single tetrahedron , there are @xmath77 ground states in which the four sites are in different potts states .",
    "these correspond to the 24 coloring schemes on a diamond site .",
    "the pyrochlore potts model  ( [ eq : h - potts ] ) represents an under - constrained system with an extensively degenerate ground state , similar to their two - dimensional counterparts  @xcite .",
    "the residual entropy of the 4-coloring model can be computed by performing finite temperature monte carlo simulations of the pyrochlore potts model  ( [ eq : h - potts ] ) . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : potts](a ) , by integrating the numerical specific - heat curve and fixing the high-@xmath140 entropy density to @xmath142 ( a potts paramagnet ) , we obtain a zero - temperature entropy density @xmath94 .",
    "the degeneracy can also be computed using a method similar to the pauling estimation for the degeneracy of water ice @xcite .",
    "consider a single tetrahedron , @xmath154 out of @xmath88 potts configurations satisfy the color constraint .",
    "treating the constraints imposed by different tetrahedra as independent , the number of degenerate ground states is @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is the number of potts variables and @xmath92 is the number of tetrahedra ( or diamond sites ) .",
    "this estimation gives an entropy density : @xmath93 , which is very close to the numerical value @xmath94 .      to map the highly constrained 4-coloring manifold to the emergent flux fields , and to make manifest the analogy with the frustrated spin systems , we consider a heisenberg antiferromagnet on the pyrochlore lattice : @xmath155 here @xmath156 and @xmath157 denotes a classical @xmath158 vector of unit length .",
    "the second term represents a special ` tetrahedral ' anisotropy : the function @xmath159 has four degenerate minimum at directions @xmath160 pointing toward different coners of a regular tetrahedron ; see the inset of fig .",
    "3(a ) in the main text . in the @xmath161 limit ,",
    "hamiltonian  ( [ eq : heisenberg ] ) reduces to the potts model as the spins are aligned to the tetrahedral vectors according to @xmath162 , where @xmath109 is the corresponding potts variable at site @xmath145 . the exchange term in  ( [ eq : heisenberg ] )",
    "can be rewritten as @xmath163 up to an irrelevant constant , where @xmath164 denotes the total spin of a tetrahedron .",
    "the ground state of the above spin model is reached when the total spin @xmath165 for all tetrahedra .    since the potts variables @xmath109 in any individual tetrahedra assume four different values for a valid 4-coloring configuration on the diamond lattice , and noting that the four @xmath160 vectors sum to zero , we have : @xmath166 for all tetrahedra , indicating the corresponding magnetic state @xmath167 is a ground state of the spin model .",
    "we thus establish an one - to - one correspondence between the 4-coloring configuration and the ground states of the spin model .",
    "the mapping to the spin model  ( [ eq : heisenberg ] ) also allows us to recast the color constraint into a conservation law of effective magnetic flux similar to the case of pyrochlore spin model discussed in refs .",
    "we first define three ` magnetic ' fields , each corresponds to a component of the heisenberg spin , on the diamond site @xmath168 here @xmath32 , the summation is over the four nearest - neighbor bond directions @xmath13 , and the pyrochlore site @xmath145 corresponds to the bond @xmath169 in the diamond lattice . since for every tetrahedra in the ground state , there are two @xmath170 and two @xmath171 signs for each component @xmath172 of the four @xmath173 vectors .",
    "thus the @xmath174 field for _ each _ spin component @xmath172 corresponds to a two - in - two - out configuration , i.e. the flux fields are conserved in each tetrahedra ( no source or sink ) . in the coarse - grained approximation ,",
