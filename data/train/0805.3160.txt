    "the observed present acceleration of the universe was first confirmed a decade ago by two separate groups using type 1a supernovae ( sn ia , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "sn ia are one of a number of probes needed to obtain tighter constraints on dark energy equation of state , including any possible time evolution .",
    "this will require surveys of thousands of supernovae out to high redshifts to accurately measure their luminosity distances from which parameters describing the dark energy can be inferred . to achieve the desired constraints on dark energy , in particular a few percent constraint on the equation of state parameter @xmath0",
    ", the supernovae will have to be accurately calibrated .",
    "it is therefore vital that this calibration is done accurately , and it is the low redshift supernovae which are vital to achieve this , for details see @xcite . at low redshift",
    "the supernovae distances have little or no dependence on the cosmological parameters such as @xmath3 , @xmath9 and the dark energy equation of state @xmath0 .",
    "they do however put a tight constraint on a combination of what is essentially the calibrated magnitude zeropoint ( @xmath10 ) and the hubble constant @xmath11 , whereas for the high redshift supernovae there is a strong degeneracy between @xmath10 , @xmath11 and the cosmological parameters of interest .",
    "figure [ nolowz ] illustrates the importance of the low redshift supernovae in anchoring the hubble diagram .",
    "it shows the gold sample from @xcite constraints on @xmath3 and @xmath0 with and without supernovae with redshifts less than @xmath12 .",
    "one can see that without the low redshift supernovae ( blue / light contours , using 146 sn ia ) the constraints blow up significantly compared to the full gold sample ( red / dark contours , using 182 sn ia ) .",
    "there are several sources of systematic error which affect the calibration of the zeropoint , for example dust extinction , luminosity evolution , weak lensing , and malmquist bias ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for more details ) .",
    "this type of error is not decreased by having a large number of supernovae and will necessarily come to dominate the error budget .",
    "the systematic errors mentioned above have long been discussed in the literature and are not considered in this letter .",
    "there is a source of error which is unique in the fact that it affects only the low redshift  calibrating \" supernovae , their peculiar motions relative to the hubble flow .",
    "previous authors have set about using sn ia to quantify the degradation of dark energy errors due to peculiar motions or use them to trace the peculiar velocity field itself in a variety of ways .",
    "three distinct approaches to this have been discussed recently in the literature . in @xcite different flow models based on the iras pscz survey @xcite",
    "were used to ",
    "correct \" the luminosity distances by the known peculiar velocities before fitting them for the cosmological parameters of interest .",
    "they find the potential systematic error in @xmath0 caused by ignoring peculiar velocities is of the order of 4 percent , i.e. quite significant .",
    "@xcite compared peculiar velocities from 98 local supernovae with the gravity field predicted from iras . in @xcite an angular expansion of the radial velocity field was used to probe the local dipole and quadrupole of the velocity field at three different distances .",
    "they found that the dipole is consistent with galaxy surveys ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at the same hubble flow depths .",
    "the third and somewhat different method is utlised by @xcite who take a covariance matrix approach . from the fluctuation in the luminosity distance induced by the peculiar motions , ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for derivations ) , a covariance matrix for the resulting errors in the luminosity distance ( or similarly the apparent magnitude ) can be calculated .",
    "the covariance matrix depends on cosmological parameters which describe the growth and distribution of structure .",
    "in addition to the peculiar velocity effect this is due to gravitational lensing effect , which is important for redshifts larger than 1 , and we shall ignore it in this letter .",
    "@xcite found that peculiar velocities of the low redshift supernovae may prevent measurement of @xmath0 to better than 10 percent , and diminish the resolution of the time derivative of @xmath0 projected for planned surveys .",
    "@xcite used the covariance matrix approach on current data , showing the changing constraints on @xmath13 , @xmath3 and @xmath0 depending on the exact redshift range of the sn ia sample and whether the full covariance was included or not .",
    "they also apply the analysis to forecasting constraints for future surveys . here",
    "we unify the analysis of sn ia data to study simultaneously fits for the expansion of the universe and the growth of structure .",
    "there is plenty of discussion on the possibility that the accelerated expansion of the universe is caused by a modification of general relativity on large scales . by measuring the growth of structure , which directly effects the observed peculiar velocity field ,",
    "information is gained to differentiate between the two scenarios .",
    "the rest of the letter is organised as follows . in section [ sec : data ] we describe the sn ia sample used in this letter . in section [ sec : method ] we describe the theory underlying sn ia analysis in cosmology and the effect of the velocity field .",
    "we analyse both nearby supernovae ( @xmath14 ) from @xcite and high redshift supernovae ( @xmath15 ) from a sample compiled by @xcite which includes data from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite combined the data from the two samples by normalising to the low redshift supernovae they had in common . following @xcite 9 supernovae",
    "are excluded from the low redshift set , those that are unsuitable due to bad lightcurve fits .",
    "this includes supernovae with their first observation more than 20 days after maximum light , those that are hosted in galaxies with excessive extinction ( @xmath16 mag ) and one outlier ( sn1999e ) , which appears to have an extremely large peculiar velocity .",
    "this leaves 124 supernovae from the @xcite data set in the redshift range @xmath17 $ ] , and median redshift @xmath18 .",
    "the overlapping sn ia in the two data sets were used to estimate a small normalising offset to the magnitudes from the @xcite data set ( the extra magnitude error is negligibly small ) .",
    "the same procedure was used by @xcite in normalising the two high redshift data sets . after eliminating duplicated sn ia , our combined data set has 271 sne with @xmath19 $ ] , and @xmath20 .",
    "we describe here how we utilise the sn ia dataset described in section  [ sec : data ] to estimate cosmological parameters by including the peculiar velocity covariance .",
    "the luminosity distance @xmath21 is defined as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the observed flux of the supernova and @xmath24 is its intrinsic luminosity .",
    "the apparent magnitude @xmath25 of a supernova at redshift @xmath26 depends on the luminosity distance as follows @xmath27 where @xmath10 is the magnitude zeropoint , and @xmath28 is defined without the hubble constant as @xmath29 in kms@xmath30 .",
    "the equation above ignores the additional terms which involve applying dust corrections , k corrections etc . for a flat universe containing a matter component and a dark energy component with a constant equation of state , the luminosity distance",
    "can be written as @xmath31 if the universe was truly homogeneous and isotropic ( frw ) this would be the end of the story , the observed @xmath28 would be described accurately by eq .",
    "[ eq : dl ] .",
    "however peculiar velocities have the effect of perturbing the luminosity distance @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the radial peculiar velocity of the supernova and @xmath34 is the hubble parameter . see @xcite for a derivation .",
    "we emphasize that in the right hand side of the above equation @xmath21 is for an _ unperturbed _ frw universe , derived at a _ perturbed _ redshift @xmath26 .",
    "therefore the covariance of the perturbation in @xmath28 , @xmath35 for a pair @xmath36 is given by @xmath37 and @xmath38 is the linear theory radial peculiar velocity correlation function , @xcite .",

    "[ eq : diag ] below .",
    "the @xmath41 and @xmath42 can be calculated from the matter power spectrum using linear theory @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the matter power spectrum , @xmath45 and @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the first and second derivative of the zeroth order spherical bessel functions respectively and @xmath48 is the derivative of the growth function at redshift @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath48 is a function of the hubble parameter and @xmath3 .",
    "see section [ sec : faces ] for further discussion .",
    "the auto correlation is given by @xmath49 we can therefore calculate @xmath50 for a pair of supernovae at @xmath51 and @xmath52 respectively given a set of cosmological parameters .    in the above equations",
    "the growth factor is calculated exactly numerically .",
    "more insight to the dependence on @xmath3 is given by the commonly used approximation for the growth factor @xmath53 , where @xmath54 @xcite , with little dependence on the cosmological constant @xcite , and a slight dependence on @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "recent refined calculations predict @xmath55 for the concordance model , and @xmath56 @xcite for a particular modified gravity model , dgp braneworld gravity @xcite , though this is just an example of many possible modified gravity models .",
    "below we shall constrain @xmath57 from the sn ia data .      to find",
    "the set of cosmological parameters @xmath58 $ ] that best fit the data we find the set that maximise the likelihood function . assuming that the data and the observational errors are gaussian random fields the likelihood function can be written as @xmath59 where @xmath60 is defined as @xmath61 and @xmath62",
