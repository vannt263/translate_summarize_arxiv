    "a boundary curve performs an important role in shape analysis and representation .",
    "it is one of the most important visual attributes in image processing and computer vision .",
    "a large amount of information of the contour is redundant and it can be simplified without damaging the representation of the original shape . in biological vision systems , this evidence was demonstrated by atteneave @xcite .",
    "he did experiments in psychophysics observing whether man would be capable of recognising shapes containing only part of their outline .",
    "the experiments of atteneave demonstrated that points of high curvature observed in objects consist of the most important information about shape , and that the human visual system is capable of recognising the original shape by just observing the higher curvature segments of the contour .",
    "this evidence motivated the development of methods to reduce the information of the contour , without losing information from the original shape .    among these methods of contour curves reduction , there are algorithms for polygonal approximation .",
    "these methods preserve the main characteristics of the curve of a contour using as few line segments as possible .",
    "the polygonal approximation presents various advantages over other curve representation schemes ( various techniques can be seen in @xcite ) due to its computational simplicity , coding efficient , preservation of local properties and the low complexity of feature extraction .",
    "moreover , an important aspect of curve polygonal approximation is the preservation of shape perception .",
    "shapes can be represented easily by a set of straight line segments that interconnect high curvature points of an outline .",
    "usually , a human observer can recognise this type of representation .",
    "this fact has motivated researches in high curvature points detection and their polygonal approximation .    in this paper , we present a novel method for polygonal approximation of digital curves .",
    "the authors have been worked in this problem using the complex networks theory . in a previous work @xcite we proposed an algorithm based on vertex betweenness . here , we focus on the study of the evolution of its shortest path as we convert a regular network into a small - world network . the vertex betweenness and the shortest path , using different networks properties and characteristics .",
    "although , these approaches are different , they achieved similar general performance .",
    "as can be noticed , there are special situations of the problem in which one or other approach is more appropriate .",
    "we present experiments with contours and their respective results .",
    "we also compared the method with other polygonal approximation methods .",
    "results demonstrate the great ability of the complex networks techniques to remove redundant point of a digital curve , thus contributing to the problem of the polygonal approximation .",
    "in this section , we present the definition of the polygonal approximation problem , followed by the description of how we model the problem as a complex network ( here referred to as sp ) .",
    "consider @xmath0 a clockwise ordered set of points describing a curve or object contour .",
    "the aim of polygonal approximation is to find out @xmath1 , with @xmath2 $ ] and @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is a set of @xmath5 points , @xmath6 , arranged in ascending order which configures a set of @xmath5 line segments that preserve the main characteristics of @xmath7 .",
    "this set of @xmath5 line segments must describe the original shape as accurated as possible and using the minimum of information .",
    "this accuracy is given by the approximation error @xmath8 that exists between @xmath7 and @xmath9 .",
    "whereas the original set @xmath7 has an error equal to zero , once that in a discreet case , it owns all shape information , the resulting error from the polygonal approximation formed by @xmath9 can be calculated by the methodology used in @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we compute the polygonal approximation error as the square sum of the perpendicular distance from each point to the line segment formed by @xmath9 . in @xcite",
    "the error is defined as    @xmath10    where @xmath11 and @xmath12 is the approximation error between arc @xmath13 and the line segment @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath15 denotes the set of @xmath5 line segments formed by the points in @xmath9 :    @xmath16    the value of @xmath12 is given by the equation defined by @xcite , also used in the work of @xcite and @xcite ,    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the perpendicular distance from point @xmath19 to its corresponding segment , @xmath14 .",
    "figure [ fig : calculo_arco ] shows an arc @xmath20 as a collection of six points , @xmath21 and we compute the error of @xmath13 as the sum of @xmath22 .",
    "in order to apply the complex network theory to the problem , a representation of the problem should be built like a graph @xmath23 .",
    "we consider each point of the curve @xmath7 as a vertex in the graph , i.e. , @xmath24 .",
    "this first approach is similar to yin s ant colony search method ( acs ) for polygonal approximation @xcite .",
    "the difference remains in the fact that acs method computes the polygonal approximation as an optimization problem , while in this paper , properties from complex network theory are used in order to solve the polygonal approximation problem .",
    "we compute the set of edges _ e _ that composes the network in the following way : for each vertex @xmath25 , we examine the remaining vertices , @xmath26 , in clockwise order .",
    "we add a directed edge binding those vertices , @xmath27 , and the weight of that edge is the error of existing approximation between the arch @xmath28 and the segment of line @xmath29 , @xmath30 .    the initial network is composed by a set of edges _ e _ binding each pair of vertices of the network .",
    "this means that the network has regular behavior , once all vertices have the same number of connections .",
    "however , a regular network is not considered a complex network . it does not present any relevant property for the proposed application .",
    "so , it is necessary to transform this regular network into a complex network which owns relevant properties for the application .    analyzing the complex network models existing in the literature",
    ", we noticed that the small - world model proposed by watts and strongatz @xcite is the one which better fits into the polygonal approximation problem .",
    "this model is characterized by the existence of two basic properties in the network : ( i ) high clustering coefficient and ( ii ) small - world property .",
    "the clustering coefficient of a network is a measure of how interconnected its vertices are .",
    "it is defined as    @xmath31 ,    where @xmath32 is the number of existing triangles in the network and @xmath33 the number of connected triples .",
    "we consider a connected triple when a vertex @xmath34 is connected to a vertex @xmath35 , and this vertex @xmath35 is connected to vertex @xmath36 .",
    "a triangle occurs when vertices @xmath34 and @xmath36 are also connected .",
    "this is an interesting property , once the more the vertices are interconnected , the more paths between a pair of vertices are possible .",
    "the small - world property is a consequence of a high clustering coefficient .",
    "it is characterized by the existence of a small average geodesic path in the network .",
    "literature describes a geodesic path as the shortest path connecting two vertices @xmath34 and @xmath35 , where @xmath37 .",
    "therefore , these properties guarantee the existence of short paths among network vertices , and these short paths represent possible polygonal approximation of the curve .",
    "the existence of these properties in the network is essential for attaining good results in polygonal approximation , and it is necessary to model the digital curve as a small - world network . to construct a small - word network , we start with a regular lattice of @xmath38 vertices , where each vertex is connected to @xmath39 vertices , and @xmath40 .",
    "we randomly rearrange each edge with a probability @xmath41 . when @xmath42 , we have an ordered lattice with high number of loops but large distances . when @xmath43 , the network becomes a random graph with short distances but no loops .",
    "watts and strogatz have shown that , in an intermediate regime , both short distances and large number of loops are present .    therefore , for graph @xmath44 , a regular lattice can be attained by selecting the @xmath39 closest vertices of each vertex . considering that the probability @xmath41 is straightly related to the approximation error between the arc @xmath45 and the line segment @xmath46 , we built a small - world network where the arcs with small error have prevailed .",
    "the probability @xmath41 of a vertex @xmath34 to be connected to a vertex @xmath35 is defined as :    @xmath47    where , @xmath48 is the weight of the edge that connects the vertex @xmath34 to @xmath35 .    for a high value of @xmath39 and a maximum error @xmath49",
    ", the rearrangement of edges occurs in a small interval and only whether @xmath50 .",
    "this edge rearrangement is similar to apply a threshold @xmath49 to the edge set @xmath51 .    in the light of this ,",
    "the proposed idea of this work is : given a contour modeled as a regular network @xmath44 , we transform @xmath44 into a small - world network by applying a @xmath52 transformation over @xmath51 , using different values of @xmath49 .",
    "we apply this operation , henceforth represented as @xmath53 , to each edge @xmath48 , @xmath54 , yielding a subset of edges @xmath55 , @xmath56 .",
    "so :    @xmath57    we perform various @xmath52 transformations using different threshold @xmath49 , which we increase in a regular interval . in this case ,",
    "@xmath49 works as a visibility control of the network vertices , i.e. , it limits the number of vertices that a vertex can reach to compose the approximation of an arc .",
    "figure [ fig : vertice_visibility ] shows how the vertex visibility changes for different values of @xmath49 . as a consequence ,",
    "it is possible to convert a regular network into a complex network that fits in the small - world model proposed by watts and strongatz @xcite .",
    "once we model the contour as a small - world network , a possible solution for the polygonal approximation problem is the set of vertices throughout a path formed by a set of edges _ e * _ , which starts and ends in the same vertice , and that respects an error @xmath8 attributed to the polygonal approximation .",
    "therefore , we restricted the polygonal approximation problem to find the geodesic path ( between _ i _ and _ i _ ) existing inside the network , respecting error @xmath8 .",
    "for a better representation of the problem , some notations were defined .",
    "consider @xmath58 , the shortest cycle present in the network that begins and ends in vertex _ v _ , the number of vertices in @xmath58 as @xmath59 , and the error between the original curve _ s _ and the corresponding approximation @xmath58 as @xmath60 .",
    "in a complex network , given two vertices _ s _ and _ v _ the geodesic path problem ( or shortest path ) consists of minimising the cost of crossing the graph between those two vertices .",
    "we define this cost as the sum of the weights of each edge traveled or just the number of traveled edges .",
    "the geodesic path between two vertices is an important rule of characterization of the internal structure of a network @xcite .",
    "specialized algorithms are well known in the literature for solving the shortest path problem .",
    "one of the most used methods is the bellman - ford algorithm , an iterative algorithm that uses the technique of edge relaxation @xcite to find minimum paths between an origin _",
    "s _ and a destiny _ v _ in a network . for the yielded shortest path to be considered as a valid polygonal approximation",
    ", it is necessary to compute also the polygonal error of this .",
    "therefore , we developed an adapted version of the bellman - ford algorithm which computes the shortest path in a network , minimizing also its polygonal error . in this work , we opted for using the bellman - ford algorithm due to its simplicity , easy implementation and generality .",
    "given a weighed and directed graph @xmath61 , an origin _",
    "s _ and a weight function _ w _ , the algorithm returns the shortest path existing in the network , whose origin is the vertex _",
    "s _ , as well as the respective number of vertices and polygonal error of this way . for each vertex @xmath62 ,",
    "the attribute _",
    "d[v ] _ corresponds to the number of vertices in the shortest path between _ s _ and _ v_. the attribute _",
    "r[v ] _ specifies the vertex predecessor to vertex _",
    "v_. we also introduced an attribute _",
    "er[v ] _ , which specifies the error in the polygonal approximation computed from _ s _ to _ v_. the process of initialization of the minimum path occurs according to the following algorithm :    [ cols= \" < \" , ]     considering the same error tolerance @xmath63 , results show that the dpso approach produces an approximating polygon with a relatively larger number of vertices than other approaches . on the other hand , the two hybrid dpso versions , namely the hdpso1 and the hdpso2 , perform better than the dpso , both in terms of the number of polygon vertices and merit .",
    "the performance of hdpso2 is better than that of hdpso1 , as the hdpso2 uses a more sophisticated optimizer @xcite .",
    "our approach has proven to be efficient to compute polygonal approximations with smaller number of vertices for different error @xmath63 . moreover , our results are better than methods such as the acs in both numbers of vertices and merit .",
    "the bps method presents a poor performance as it does not consider different levels of details in the curve , i.e. , the algorithm computes the redundant points by considering the entire curve information .",
    "this reduces the efficiency of the algorithm .",
    "the performance of ao method is extremely dependent on the objective function . for the experiments",
    ", we considered as the the approximation error @xmath8 as the objective function , as in the experiments we always aimed to find a polygonal approximation that respects the maximum approximation error @xmath63 .",
    "we notice that our approach performed similarly to the dpd method . for some test cases ,",
    "the dpd method presented a smaller approximation error @xmath8 , thus leading to a higher merit ( as for the semicircle contour ) .",
    "however , for the leaf contour , our approach presented a smaller number of points , thus leading to a higher merit value .",
    "for the same number of points @xmath5 , we notice a smaller approximation error for the dpd method .",
    "such result occurs as dpd method uses a more sophisticated local optimization .",
    "in this paper , we proposed a novel polygonal approximation method using the networks shortest path .",
    "the method represents a contour as a small - world network , where we represent the points of the curve as network vertices .",
    "we represent the network edges by the line segments that compose a possible polygonal approximation of the curve .",
    "then , we compute the contour polygonal approximation as the shortest cycle that exists in this network .    the experiments illustrated that parameter @xmath49 acts as a visibility control in the network vertices , which limits the number of vertices that another vertex can reach to compose an approximation of the arc .",
    "we also observed that the initial vertex of the cycle does not interfere in the results , a problem that exists in sequential methods .",
    "the method is also deterministic , once it presents the same result over different runs .",
    "we also demonstrated that the proposed method is an excellent solution for the problem of polygonal approximation , performing better than traditional and more sophisticated methods .",
    "an important feature of the proposed method is its flexibility , as the visibility of @xmath49 enables us to compute different approximations for the same curve .",
    "concerning the complex network theory , this work demonstrates a good potential of application of this approach in problems of computer vision and digital imaging processing .",
