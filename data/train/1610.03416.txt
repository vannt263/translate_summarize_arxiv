    "<S> the body axis elongates while the psm continuously changes its length and eventually shortens . </S>",
    "<S> after a species - dependent number of segments is formed , the process terminates when the psm becomes very small @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the total segment number can vary from about ten in frog to several hundreds in snake @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the temporal progress of segmentation is controlled by oscillations of the cellular concentration levels of functional proteins in the psm @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these cellular oscillations are achieved through autoregulation of so - called ` cyclic genes ' @xcite . on the tissue level , these oscillations give rise to nonlinear waves that propagate through the psm @xcite , see fig .  </S>",

    "<S> a new segment is formed with each completed oscillation at the anterior end of the psm , corresponding to an arriving wave @xcite . hence , </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to pattern formation via instabilities of homogeneous states , segmentation is characterized by a spatially inhomogeneous system with the psm driving the patterning process . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , pattern formation takes place in a dynamic medium : the body axis continuously elongates during segmentation while the psm at the tail of the body axis shortens until segmentation terminates . a theoretical model that integrates pattern formation , tissue elongation and shortening , and termination of segmentation by a self - organized mechanism is still missing .    to yield robust morphological results , </S>",

    "<S> the resulting patterning system yields the correct spatial morphology and shortening of the segmenting tissue . </S>",
