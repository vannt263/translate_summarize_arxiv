    "d - branes at orbifold singularities have been intensively studied for recent years ( see @xcite-@xcite for example ) .",
    "one of the purposes is to investigate geometries of spacetime .",
    "d - branes serve as tools to study ultrashort structure of spacetime .",
    "so it is interesting to study geometries by using d - branes as probes and compare them with geometries probed by point particles or fundamental strings .",
    "orbifolds provide nontrivial but relatively simple examples for such a purpose .",
    "another motivation to study d - branes on orbifolds is to construct large families of gauge theories .",
    "various choices of orbifolds lead to gauge theories with various supersymmetries and dimensions .",
    "it is well - known that gauge theories can be constructed by using brane configurations following the work of @xcite .",
    "investigations from different approaches and comparison between them are useful to clarify various aspects of gauge theories .",
    "investigations along this line have been made in @xcite for example .    in this paper , we study d - branes on three - dimensional nonabelian orbifolds @xmath0 with @xmath8 . for these cases ,",
    "the gauge theories have @xmath9 supersymmetry compared with type ii string theory .",
    "it is known that finite subgroups of @xmath3 are classified into @xmath10-like series @xcite .",
    "we are concerned with `` d''-type subgroups @xmath6 and @xmath2 , where @xmath11 is a positive integer and the number in braces represents the order of the group .    in studying d - brane gauge theory on @xmath0 , the quiver diagram of @xmath7 plays an important role .",
    "the quiver diagram of @xmath7 is a diagram which represents algebraic structure of @xmath7 .",
    "it consists of nodes and arrows connecting the nodes .",
    "the nodes represent irreducible representations of @xmath7 , while the arrows represent structure of tensor products between a certain faithful three - dimensional representation and the irreducible representations . in the gauge theory ,",
    "the nodes represent gauge groups and the arrows represent matter contents .",
    "the quiver diagrams of the groups @xmath6 and @xmath2 were calculated in @xcite .",
    "the quiver diagram of @xmath6 can be considered as a @xmath12 quotient of that of @xmath13 , and the quiver diagram of @xmath2 is obtained by a further @xmath14 quotient . in @xcite , it was also pointed out that these quiver diagrams have similar structure to a web of @xmath55-branes of type iib string theory @xcite .",
    "so it is natural to expect that the d - brane gauge theories can be realized by brane configurations involving such a web of @xmath5 branes .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to construct brane configurations corresponding to d - branes on @xmath15 and @xmath16 .    in constructing brane configurations ,",
    "the brane box model @xcite provides useful information .",
    "the brane box model is a realization of d - brane gauge theory on @xmath4 via brane configurations .",
    "what is remarkable on the brane box model is that there is a correspondence between the quiver diagram of @xmath13 and the brane configuration for @xmath4 .",
    "we use such a correspondence as a guideline to construct brane configurations for @xmath0 . as stated above",
    ", the quiver diagram of @xmath6 is a @xmath12 quotient of that of @xmath13 .",
    "therefore , combining with the correspondence between quiver diagrams and brane configurations , we expect that the brane configuration for @xmath15 is obtained from that for @xmath4 by a @xmath12 quotient .",
    "however , we can not define a @xmath12 quotient on the brane box configuration since the @xmath12 is not a symmetry of the configuration .",
    "so we can not use the brane box configuration itself as a configuration for @xmath4 .",
    "instead , we construct a brane configuration with a @xmath12 symmetry maintaining the correspondence with the quiver diagram of @xmath13 .",
    "it consists of d3-branes and a web of @xmath5 5-branes of type iib string theory .",
    "the brane configuration for @xmath15 is obtained from such a configuration by a @xmath12 quotient .",
    "we can see that the configuration naturally reproduces the structure of the quiver diagram of @xmath6 .",
    "in other words , the brane configuration can be considered as a physical realization of the quiver diagram . the brane configuration for @xmath16",
    "is obtained by a further @xmath14 quotient .",
    "the quiver diagram of @xmath7 is also a key ingredient in the discussion of what is called mckay correspondence@xcite-@xcite .",
    "the mckay correspondence is a relation between the representation theory of a finite group @xmath7 and the geometries of @xmath17 .",
    "it was originally found for @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the mckay correspondence states that the quiver diagram of @xmath7 coincides with a diagram which represent intersections among exceptional divisors of @xmath20 .",
    "( @xmath21 represents the minimal resolution of @xmath22 . )",
    "we are concerned with its generalization to three dimensions .",
    "if @xmath7 is abelian , @xmath0 becomes a toric variety , and its resolution can be discussed by using toric method . in @xcite , relations between brane configurations and toric diagrams were discussed . applying such arguments to the case @xmath23 , we can see that the brane configuration and the orbifolds are related by t - duality , and the brane configuration is graphically dual to the corresponding toric diagram . combining with an observation that the brane configuration for @xmath0 can be regarded as the quiver diagram of @xmath7 , we can say that the quiver diagram and the toric diagram are related by t - duality .",
    "since the toric diagram represents geometric information of the orbifold such as intersections among exceptional divisors , it leads to an interpretation that the three - dimensional mckay correspondence can be understood as t - duality .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section 2 , we review a prescription to obtain worldvolume gauge theory of d - branes on an orbifold @xmath0",
    ". we also present quiver diagrams for @xmath1 and @xmath2 calculated in @xcite . in section 3 , we first review the brane box model .",
    "then we construct a brane configuration for @xmath4 which is appropriate to construct brane configuraions for nonabelian orbifolds . by taking its quotient ,",
    "we construct brane configurations for @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "we argue that the structure of the quiver diagrams of @xmath6 and @xmath2 can be explained by the brane configurations . in section 4",
    ", we discuss relations between brane configurations and toric diagrams .",
    "based on the discussion of @xcite which relates brane configurations and toric diagrams , we present evidence that the three dimensional mckay correspondence may be interpreted as t - duality .",
    "section 5 is devoted to discussions .",
    "in this section , we review the results of @xcite , in which the quiver diagrams for d - branes on orbifolds @xmath0 with @xmath1 and @xmath2 were obtained . we start with @xmath24 parallel d1-branes on @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the order of @xmath7 .",
    "we will discuss the reason to take d1-branes in sections 3 and 4 .",
    "the effective action of the d - branes is given by the dimensional reduction of ten - dimensional @xmath27 super yang - mills theory to two - dimensions .",
    "the bosonic field contents are a @xmath27 gauge field @xmath28 and four complex adjoint scalars @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) and @xmath31 .",
    "fermionic field contents are determined via unbroken supersymmetry , so we do not touch upon them .",
    "we take @xmath7 to act on complex three - dimensional space corresponding to @xmath29 . since @xmath31 is irrelevant in the following discussions , we set @xmath32 .",
    "next we project this theory onto @xmath7 invariant space .",
    "the condition is expressed as @xmath33 where @xmath34 , @xmath35 is a three - dimensional representation of @xmath7 which acts on spacetime indices @xmath36 and @xmath37 is the @xmath38 regular representation of @xmath7 which acts on chan - paton indices .",
    "@xmath35 defines how @xmath7 acts on @xmath25 to form the quotient singularity .",
    "the condition ( [ eq : projectiona ] ) implies that gauge fields surviving the projection are @xmath7-invariant parts of @xmath39 .",
    "since the regular representation @xmath37 has the following decomposition @xmath40 where @xmath41 denotes an irreducible representation of @xmath7 and @xmath42 is the number of irreducible representations of @xmath7 , we obtain the following expression , @xmath43 here we used schur s lemma .",
    "the equation means that the gauge symmetry of the resulting theory is @xmath44 if we consider @xmath11 d - branes on the orbifold , the gauge group becomes @xmath45    one can see the matter contents after the projection ( [ eq : projectionx ] ) in a similar way .",
    "they are @xmath7-invariant parts of @xmath46 . by defining the tensor product of the three - dimensional representation @xmath35 and",
    "an irreducible representation @xmath41 as @xmath47 one obtains the following expression , @xmath48 it means that @xmath49 is the number of bifundamental fields which transform as @xmath50 under @xmath51",
    ".    the gauge group and the spectrum are summarized in a quiver diagram . a quiver diagram consists of @xmath42 nodes corresponding to irreducible representations and arrows which connect these nodes corresponding to bifundamental matters .",
    "outgoing arrows represent fundamentals and ingoing arrows represent anti - fundamentals .",
    "@xmath49 is the number of arrows from the @xmath52-th node to the @xmath53-th node .",
    "the group @xmath54 consists of the following elements @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the @xmath58 elements \\{@xmath59 } correspond to a three - dimensional reducible representation of the abelian group @xmath13 .",
    "the elements of the group @xmath6 are obtained by multiplying the the following matrices @xmath60 to the elements \\{@xmath59}. the matrices ( [ eq : z3 ] ) are the elements of the group @xmath12 , so the group @xmath6 is isomorphic to the semidirect product of @xmath13 and @xmath12 .",
    "we first consider the cases with @xmath61 .",
    "the irreducible representations of @xmath6 consists of one - dimensional representations and three - dimensional representations .",
    "there are 3 one - dimensional representations which we denote as @xmath62 @xmath63 .",
    "the three - dimensional representations are labeled by two integers @xmath64 with @xmath65 .",
    "furthermore there are equivalence relations among the representations @xmath66 , @xmath67 thus the three - dimensional representations are labeled by the lattice points @xmath68 where the action of @xmath12 is defined by the relation ( [ eq : relation ] ) . by counting the number of the lattice points in @xmath68 one can see that there are @xmath69 three - dimensional irreducible representations .",
    "thus the gauge group of the d - brane worldvolume theory on @xmath15 is @xmath70 .",
    "now we choose the three - dimensional representation acting on the spacetime indices to be @xmath71 . by calculating tensor products between @xmath71 and irreducible representations of @xmath6",
    ", we can depict the quiver diagram of @xmath6 in a closed form .",
    "an example will be given in section 3 .",
    "however , it becomes very complicated as @xmath11 increases , so it is not useful to analyze structure of the gauge theories .",
    "therefore we would like to depict the quiver diagram of @xmath6 in a form such that its structure becomes simple .",
    "to this end , it is useful to define @xmath72 as @xmath73 then the tensor products of @xmath71 and the irreducible representations are given by a compact form , @xmath74 although @xmath72 is not an irreducible representation , the expression ( [ eq : a2 ] ) is so simple that we tentatively forget the structure ( [ eq : definition ] ) and treat it as if it were an irreducible representation .    as stated above , a quiver diagram consists of nodes associated with the irreducible representations and arrows associated with the structure of the tensor products . in the present case ,",
    "the irreducible representations are labeled by two integers modulo @xmath11 , so we put the nodes on the lattice points of @xmath13 . the equation ( [ eq : a2 ] )",
    "indicates that there are three arrows which start from each node @xmath75 .",
    "the end points are @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "the quiver diagram is obtained by putting such arrows to each node in @xmath13 and identifying the nodes according to the @xmath12 equivalence relations ( [ eq : relation ] ) .",
    "thus the quiver diagram of @xmath6 is basically a @xmath12 quotient of that of @xmath13 .",
    "it is depicted in figure [ fig : quiver1 ] .",
    "only one set of three arrows is depicted for simplicity although such a set of arrows start from every node . due to the @xmath12 identification , the fundamental region",
    "is restricted to the parallelogram surrounded by dashed lines . to be precise ,",
    "however , we must take the equation ( [ eq : definition ] ) into consideration .",
    "except for the fixed points , @xmath12 quotient means that three one - dimensional nodes related by @xmath12 must be identified .",
    "such nodes become three - dimensional after the @xmath12 quotient . for the fixed points such as the node at the origin",
    ", the @xmath12 quotient must be understood as a splitting into three one - dimensional nodes as indicated by the equation ( [ eq : definition ] ) .",
    "the rule of the @xmath12 quotient on arrows is defined according to the rule on nodes since each arrow is determined by specifying the starting node and the ending node .    for the cases with @xmath79 ,",
    "there are 9 one - dimensional representations which we denote as @xmath62 @xmath80 and three - dimensional representations labeled by @xmath81 where @xmath82 . as in the @xmath61 cases , there are equivalence relations ( [ eq : relation ] ) . by counting the number of the lattice points in @xmath83 , one can see that there are @xmath84 three - dimensional irreducible representations when @xmath85 is an integer .",
    "so the gauge group of the d - brane theory is @xmath86 .    by defining @xmath87 tensor products of @xmath71 and",
    "the irreducible representations are given as follows , @xmath88 the quiver diagram is shown in figure [ fig : quiver2 ] .",
    "it is essentially the same as in the @xmath61 cases except that the nodes @xmath89 and @xmath90 lie at fixed points of the @xmath12 action .",
    "we now turn to the group @xmath91 .",
    "the group @xmath2 with @xmath11 a positive integer consists of \\{@xmath59 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 } in ( [ eq : ace ] ) and the following matrices . @xmath94 as pointed out in @xcite , even if one choose @xmath11 to be an odd integer , the matrices generate elements of @xmath95 by multiplication .",
    "so we restrict the value of @xmath11 to even integers .",
    "the elements of the group @xmath2 are obtained by multiplying the matrices ( [ eq : z3 ] ) and @xmath96 to the elements \\{@xmath59 } in ( [ eq : ace ] ) .",
    "note that the six matrices ( [ eq : z3 ] ) and ( [ eq : s3 ] ) are the elements of the symmetric group @xmath97 of order six .",
    "thus the group @xmath2 is isomorphic to the semidirect product of @xmath13 and @xmath97 .    when @xmath85 is not an integer , the irreducible representations consist of 2 one - dimensional representations , 1 two - dimensional representation , @xmath98 three - dimensional representations and @xmath99 six - dimensional representations .",
    "thus the gauge group is @xmath100 .",
    "we denote the one - dimensional representations as @xmath101 @xmath102 , the two - dimensional representation as @xmath103 and the three - dimensional representations as @xmath104 , where @xmath105 and @xmath106 takes values in @xmath14 .",
    "the six - dimensional representations are labeled by @xmath107 where @xmath108 . as in the @xmath54 cases ,",
    "there are equivalence relations among the representations @xmath109 , @xmath110 @xmath111 hence the six - dimensional representations are labeled by the lattice points @xmath112 . here @xmath97 is the semidirect product of groups @xmath12 and",
    "@xmath14 whose action are defined by the relations ( [ eq : relation6 - 1 ] ) and ( [ eq : relation6 - 2 ] ) respectively .",
    "@xmath99 is the number of the lattice points in @xmath112 when @xmath85 is not an integer .    by defining @xmath113 tensor products of @xmath114 and",
    "the irreducible representations are given by , @xmath115 the quiver diagram is depicted in figure [ fig : quiver3 ] . due to the additional @xmath14 identification of ( [ eq : relation6 - 2 ] ) , the fundamental region",
    "is restricted to , say , the lower triangle surrounded by dashed lines in figure [ fig : quiver3 ] .",
    "we note that the nodes at @xmath116 correspond to fixed points of the @xmath14 action defined by ( [ eq : relation6 - 2 ] ) .",
    "in addition , the node at the origin corresponds to a fixed point of the @xmath12 action defined by ( [ eq : relation6 - 1 ] ) .",
    "when @xmath85 is an integer , the irreducible representations consist of 2 one - dimensional representations , 4 two - dimensional representations , @xmath98 three - dimensional representations and @xmath117 six - dimensional representations .",
    "so the gauge group is @xmath118 .",
    "we denote the two - dimensional representations as @xmath119 @xmath120 and use the same notations as the @xmath121 case for other representations . as in the @xmath61 case , there are equivalence relations ( [ eq : relation6 - 1 ] ) and ( [ eq : relation6 - 2 ] ) , so the six - dimensional representations are labeled by the lattice points @xmath122 where @xmath123 .",
    "@xmath117 is the number of the lattice points in @xmath122 when @xmath85 is an integer .    by defining @xmath124 tensor products of @xmath125 and the irreducible representations",

    "it is essentially the same as in the @xmath61 cases except that the node @xmath90 lies at a fixed point of the @xmath12 action .",
    "in the last section , we have presented the quiver diagrams for d - branes on orbifolds @xmath0 with @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "unexpectedly the quiver diagrams have a resemblance to the structure of string junctions @xcite or webs of @xmath5 5-branes @xcite .",
    "three @xmath5 strings of type iib theory are permitted to form a prong if the @xmath5 charge is conserved , @xmath126 in order to have a quarter supersymmetry , @xmath5 strings is constrained to have a slope @xmath127 on a plane where @xmath128 , @xmath129 is the coupling constant and @xmath130 is the axion of type iib string theory .",
    "similar conditions must be satisfied to form a prong of @xmath5 5-branes .",
    "the arrows in the quiver diagrams representing matter contents have the same structure .",
    "it is likely that the gauge theory represented by the quiver diagram have something to do with string junctions or a web of @xmath5 5-branes . in this section ,",
    "we consider realizations of the gauge theories of d - branes on the nonabelian orbifolds by using such brane configurations .    to investigate the brane configurations for nonabelian orbifolds @xmath131 , we first review the brane box model , which is a brane configuration corresponding to d - branes on an abelian orbifold @xmath4 @xcite . as noted in the last section , the finite groups @xmath6 and @xmath2 are closely related to @xmath13 .",
    "we study the brane configurations for @xmath131 based on the brane box model by using relations between the groups @xmath132 and @xmath13 .",

    "the point we would like to emphasize is that the quiver diagram for the orbifold @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) is essentially that for the orbifold @xmath4 with the @xmath12 equivalence relation ( [ eq : relation ] ) ( the @xmath137 equivalence relation ( [ eq : relation6 - 1 ] ) and ( [ eq : relation6 - 2 ] ) ) .",
    "the brane box is a model that provides the same gauge theory as the d - brane worldvolume theory on @xmath138 .",
    "it consists of the following set of branes ; ns5-branes along 012345 directions , ns5-branes along 012367 directions and d5-branes along 012346 directions .",
    "the brane box configuration is shown in figure [ fig : branebox ] .",
    "it represents the brane configuration on the 46-plane .",
    "ns and ns 5-branes are indicated by horizontal and vertical lines respectively .",
    "d5-branes lie on each box bounded by ns and ns 5-branes . in the brane box model , the first ns5(ns5)-brane and",
    "the ( n+1)-th ns5(ns5)-branes must be identified .",
    "the interest focuses on the gauge theory on the world - volume of the d5-branes .",
    "being finite in 46 directions , the d5-branes are macroscopically ( 3 + 1)-dimensional .",
    "each box provides a gauge group @xmath139 where @xmath140 denotes the number of d - branes on the @xmath52-th box .",
    "open strings connecting d - branes on neighboring boxes provide matters . in the absence of ns5 and ns5-branes ,",
    "two possible orientations are allowed for the strings .",
    "the orientation of ns5 and ns5-branes induces a particular orientation for the strings .",
    "one possible choice of orientations of strings is shown in figure [ fig : branebox ] @xcite .",

    "the oriented open strings stretching from d - branes on the @xmath52-th box to d - branes on the @xmath53-th box provide bifundamental matters @xmath141 .",
    "thus the matter contents of the brane box model are just what determined by the quiver diagram in figure [ fig : quiver5 ] .",

    ", an oriented open string stretching from the @xmath156-th d - brane to the @xmath157-th d - brane is the same as an open string stretching from the @xmath158-th d - brane to the @xmath159-th d - brane ( modulo 3 ) . since the @xmath160 component of the gauge field comes from the oriented open string from the @xmath156-th d - brane to the @xmath157-th d - brane , the @xmath161 components of the gauge field take the following form , @xmath162 it means that the box including the fixed point gives the gauge group @xmath163 instead of @xmath155 . as for the matters ,",
    "they come from open strings which connect d - branes on neighboring boxes .",
    "locally , every boundary between two boxes has the same structure ; there are three d - branes on both sides , so each boundary gives a matter with @xmath161 components .",
    "the @xmath160 component comes from an oriented open string stretching from the @xmath156-th d - brane on one side to the @xmath157-th d - brane on the other side .",
    "difference comes from global structure of d - branes meeting at each boundary .",
    "it determines how the matters transform under the gauge groups .",
    "if boxes on both side do not include fixed points of @xmath12 , the matter transforms as a bifundamental @xmath164 of @xmath165 . if a box on one side of the boundary include a fixed point , the corresponding representation @xmath166 splits into @xmath167 .",
    "d - branes on an orbifold , the gauge group coming from the box including a fixed point is @xmath168 instead of @xmath169 . accordingly , @xmath170 dimensional representation splits into @xmath171 ; each @xmath24 represents @xmath24-dimensional representation of each @xmath27 .",
    "] thus the @xmath161 components of the matter coming from such a boundary split into three @xmath172 or three @xmath173 .",
    "they coincide with the spectrum indicated by the arrows in the quiver diagram . collecting these results",
    ", one can see that the brane configuration in figure [ fig : quiver - brane](b ) presicely reproduces the structure of the quiver diagram in figure [ fig : quiver - brane](a ) .    in the @xmath61 case , only one of the three apexes",
    "is included in a box and the other two lie at boundaries of some boxes as shown in figure [ fig : quiver - brane](b ) . for @xmath79 ,",
    "on the other hand , we can see that three apexes lie inside of three boxes respectively .",
    "therefore each box at the apex gives a gauge group factor @xmath163 in accordance with the structure of the quiver diagram .",
    "now we would like to comment on the correspondence between the brane configuration and the quiver diagram . in the definition of the @xmath12 action on the quiver diagram ,",
    "a rather elaborate rule was necessary in relation to the fixed points of @xmath12 .",
    "in contrast , the rule of the @xmath12 quotient are automatically reproduced via the brane configurations although the quotienting procedure on the brane configurations is simple . in this respect",
    ", we can say that the brane configuration inherently posesses necessary property which the quiver diagrams should have .",
    "in other words , it seems reasonable to regard the brane configuration as a realization of the quiver diagram in the language of physics .",
    "the brane configuration for @xmath16 is obtained by making a @xmath14 quotient in addition to the @xmath12 quotient for @xmath15 .",
    "the @xmath14 quotient is determined through the relation ( [ eq : relation6 - 2 ] ) which defines the @xmath14 action on the quiver diagram .",
    "one can see that the brane configuration reproduces the structure of the quiver diagram of @xmath16 by a similar argument to the @xmath15 cases .",
    "in this section , we would like to discuss relations between the brane configurations obtained in the last section and geometries of @xmath0 .",
    "as we mentioned , the brane configuration for @xmath0 plays the role of the quiver diagram of @xmath7 , hence the relation can be considered as a relation between the tensor product structure of irreducible representations of @xmath7 and the geometry of @xmath0 .",
    "such a relation has been discussed in mathematics as the mckay correspondence .",
    "we will present evidence that the mckay correspondence may be understood as t - duality .    before we come to the discussion on duality",
    ", we make it clear what we mean by the term `` mckay correspondence '' .",
    "the mckay correspondence was originally observed for two - dimensional orbifolds@xcite .",
    "it is a relation between the quiver diagram of @xmath7 and a diagram representing intersections among exceptional divisors of @xmath20 .",
    "both of them coincide with a certain dynkin diagram of @xmath10 lie algebra .",
    "we consider its straightforward generalization as a three - dimensional mckay correspondence .",
    "that is , we use the term mckay correspondence to refer to a relation between the quiver diagram of @xmath7 and a diagram which represents intersections among exceptional divisors of @xmath174 . if @xmath7 is abelian",
    ", @xmath0 becomes a toric variety and its resolution is discussed by using toric method . in this case , information on intersections among exceptional divisors is represented by a toric diagram . in summary , we use the term mckay correspondence in dimension three as a relation between the quiver diagram of @xmath7 and the toric diagram of @xmath174 .",
    "fortunately , relations between brane configurations and toric varieties were generally discussed in @xcite .",
    "to explain the idea of @xcite , we briefly review toric virieties .",
    "a complex @xmath175-dimensional toric variety involves real @xmath175-dimensional torus @xmath176 .",
    "certain cycles of the torus @xmath176 shrink on some loci of the toric variety .",
    "a toric variety is determined by specifying which cycles shrink where .",
    "such information is represented by a diagram in real @xmath175-dimensional space , which we call a toric diagram .",
    "information on ( co)homology of the toric variety is encoded in the toric diagram . for toric varieties with vanishing first chern class ,",
    "toric diagrams are reduced to diagrams in ( @xmath177)-dimensional space .",
    "as we are considering complex three - dimensional toric varieties with vanishing first chern class , their toric diagrams represent how a torus @xmath154 of the toric variety shrinks .",
    "more precisely , what is identified with loci where @xmath154 shrinks is a dual diagram of the toric diagram .",
    "a line in the dual diagram with a slope @xmath178 represents locus at which a @xmath5 cycle of @xmath154 shrinks . keeping the property of toric varieties in mind",
    ", we turn to the explanation of @xcite which relates brane configurations and toric diagrams .",
    "it is known that m - theory on @xmath154 and type iib string theory on a circle @xmath179 are related by a kind of t - duality @xcite .",
    "vanishing @xmath5 cycles of @xmath154 of m - theory corresponds to @xmath5 5-branes of type iib string theory .",
    "if we consider m - theory on a toric variety and dualize in this sense along the 2-torus @xmath154 of the toric variety , we obtain type iib string theory on a circle with @xmath5 5-branes ; the skeleton of the dual diagram is identified with a web of @xmath5 5-branes .",
    "we would like to apply this argument to the case @xmath23 .",
    "the toric diagram of a certain resolution of the orbifold @xmath4 is depicted in figure [ fig : toric1 ] .",
    "its dual diagram depicted in figure [ fig : dual1 ] represents a web of @xmath5 5-branes in the sense described above .",
    "the brane configuration in figure [ fig : dual1 ] has the same structure as the configuration for @xmath4 in figure [ fig : brane](b ) at least locally . in this sense",
    ", the brane configuration for @xmath4 , which can be interpreted as the quiver diagram of @xmath13 , and the toric diagram of @xmath4 are related by t - duality .",
    "the global structure of figure [ fig : dual1 ] , however , is different from that of figure [ fig : brane](b ) ; to obtain the brane configuration in figure [ fig : brane](b ) , we must combine two brane configurations in figure [ fig : dual1 ] and make a certain identification .",
    "the difference stems from the non - compactness of the orbifold .",
    "the models discussed in section 3 are so - called elliptic models ; they are compactified along 56 directions to @xmath154 . on the other hand ,",
    "the toric diagram in figure [ fig : toric1 ] represents an open variety which does not have such compactness .",
    "in fact , such a manifold is not appropriate to perform t - duality since the radii of the circles performing t - duality become infinite as the distance from the singularity becomes infinite . in order to make the t - duality argument precise",
    ", we must replace the toric variety by a maniofold which have the same local structure but have another asymptotics , so that the radii of the circles are finite at infinity .",
    "it is analogous to the replacement of @xmath180 with a taub - nut space .",
    "we hope that the correspondence between the brane configuration and the toric diagram can be made definite when such a replacement is properly taken into account .",
    "thus it needs further study to make the t - duality argument precise , but there are some evidences to support such an argument .",
    "first , we would like to point out a nontrivial coincidence between the physical argument presented above and mathematical argument on the mckay correspondence . in resolving the singularity of @xmath4",
    ", there are many possibilities related by topology changing process called a flop . among such resolutions ,",
    "only one resolution represented by the toric diagram in figure [ fig : toric1 ] has a relation to the brane configuration for @xmath4 . in the mathematical argument @xcite ,",
    "the mckay correspondence is proved only for a paticular kind of resolution .",
    "it is so - called the hilbert scheme of @xmath4 , whose toric diagram is nothing but figure [ fig : toric1 ] .",
    "although the formulation of the mckay correspondence in @xcite is different from the naive one we are considering , it seems reasonable to regard the coincidence as a supporting evidence for the t - duality interpretation of the mckay correspondence .",
    "now we turn to the case @xmath1 .",
    "since the orbifolds @xmath15 is not a toric variety , we can not directly apply the above argument .",
    "however , the brane configuration for @xmath15 is obtained from that for @xmath4 by the @xmath12 quotient .",
    "so we use this relation to discuss the geometry of @xmath15 .",
    "the @xmath12 action on the brane configuration can be translated to the action on the toric diagram through the relation between the figure [ fig : toric1 ] and figure [ fig : dual1 ] .",
    "for example , @xmath12 acts cyclically on three apexes of the triangle which lies at the center of the toric diagram .",
    "since each lattice point inside the toric diagram represent an exceptional divisor , the @xmath12 quotient means that the three divisors must be identified . in this way",
    ", we obtain a @xmath12 quotient of the toric variety @xmath4 .",
    "the @xmath12 action on the quiver diagram is illustrated in figure [ fig : toric3 ] .",
    "in fact , resolutions of the singularity of @xmath15 were discussed in @xcite .",
    "broadly speaking , the singularity is resolved by the following procedure .",
    "first , consider toric resolutions of the abelian orbifold @xmath4 .",
    "then perform a certain @xmath12 quotient , and finally resolve singularities which occur due to the @xmath12 quotienting procedure .",
    "the group @xmath12 permutes exceptional divisors of the toric resolution of @xmath4 .",
    "in fact , the @xmath12 quotient is equivalent to that represented in figure [ fig : toric3 ] if we consider figure [ fig : toric1 ] as a resolution of @xmath4 . although the @xmath12 actions are equivalent , the origins are quite different .",
    "the @xmath12 action in figure [ fig : toric3 ] were determined by the discussion on the quiver diagrams , so it originates from the representation theory of @xmath6 . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath12 action in the process of the resolution of the singularity comes from geometrical argument .",
    "the coincidence between the two @xmath12 actions can be considered as one aspect of the mckay correspondence for @xmath1 , and again it serves as a supporting evidence for the t - duality interpretation of the mckay correspondence .",
    "now we comment on the difference between the brane configuration of figure [ fig : brane](a ) and that of figure [ fig : brane](b ) .",
    "they are only different in @xmath5 charges of 5-branes . from the toric geometry point of view",
    ", however , there is an essential difference @xcite .",
    "the toric diagram corresponding to the configuration of figure [ fig : brane](a ) before the @xmath12 identification is depicted in figure [ fig : resolution](a ) . in the figure",
    ", there is a lattice point in each triangle in contrast to figure [ fig : toric1 ] .",
    "it means that the orbifold singularity is not fully resolved . to resolve fully the orbifold singularity",
    ", we must subdivide the toric diagram as shown in figure [ fig : resolution](b ) .",
    "then each junction of @xmath5 5-branes is replaced by figure [ fig : resolution](c ) . on the other hand ,",
    "each junction in figure [ fig : brane](b ) can not be made such a replacement .",
    "therefore we can determine the right @xmath5 charges of 5-branes by requiring that each junction can not be replaced by a set of junctions as in figure [ fig : resolution](c ) .",
    "in this paper , we have studied brane configurations corresponding to d - branes on nonabelian orbifolds @xmath15 and @xmath16 based on the analyses of the quiver diagrams .",
    "we first constructed the brane configuration for @xmath4 by requiring that it had a @xmath12 symmetry .",
    "it consists of a web of @xmath5 5-branes and d3-branes . by making a @xmath12 ( @xmath137 ) quotient ,",
    "we have obtained the brane condigurations for @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "the structure of the quiver diagrams of @xmath6 and @xmath2 can be naturally explained via the brane configurations .",
    "we have also discussed relations between the brane configurations and toric diagrams . based on the argument which relates branes and the toric geometry ,",
    "we have pointed out that the three - dimensional mckay correspondence may be understood as t - duality .    in @xcite , it was shown that d3-branes on orbifolds and the brane box model are related by t - duality .",
    "now we would like to make a rough argument to relate the brane configurations and",
    "d - branes on orbifolds .",
    "we start with type iib string theory with a web of @xmath5 5-branes along 01234 directions and one direction of the 56 plane and d3-branes along 0156 directions .",
    "we first t - dualize along direction 9 and decompactify along direction 10 .",
    "then we obtain m - theory on an orbifold @xmath15 with m5-branes along 01569(10 ) directions . here",
    "@xmath15 extends to 56789(10 ) directions . to obtain type iib string theory on orbifolds ,",
    "we take a limit that the direction 1 shrinks .",
    "then we obtain type iia string theory on @xmath15 with d4-branes along 0569(10 ) .",
    "next we perform t - dualities along 256 directions . then we obtain type iib string theory on @xmath15 with d3-branes . here",
    "@xmath15 extends to 56789(10 ) directions , while d3-branes extend to 029(10 ) directions .",
    "if such an argument on duality is true , the right interpretation of the d1-branes discussed in section 2 seems to be d3-branes wrapped around two directions of the orbifold .",
    "d - branes wrapping on each cycle of an orbifold stick to the singularity @xcite . however , since we are considering a set of d - branes which corresponds to the regular representation of @xmath6 , they are allowed to move away from the singularity @xcite .",
    "anyway it needs further investigation on the argument of duality .",
    "one of the important problems which should be clarified is the structure of the kahler moduli space of nonabelian orbifolds . for three - dimensional abelian orbifolds ,",
    "their kahler moduli spaces were examined in @xcite by using a toric method combining with the fact that toric varieties can be realized as vacuum moduli spaces of two - dimensional gauged linear sigma models @xcite . on the other hand , this method can not be applied to nonabelian orbifolds since they are not toric varieries .",
    "the nonabelian orbifolds , however , are related to toric varieties through a quotienting procedure .",
    "it would be interesting to investigate whether the quotienting procedure can be incorporated into the toric method to analyze the structure of kahler moduli space of nonabelian orbifolds .",
    "it is also interesting to generalize the work to other cases . for the e - type subgroups of @xmath3 , a catalogue of quiver diagrams",
    "is given in @xcite .",
    "it is so complicated that construction of brane configurations seems to be difficult .",
    "however , unbroken supersymmetry may provide us a guide to the construction .",
    "for @xmath181 , classification of finite subgroups were summarized in @xcite . since there is no supersymmetry in these cases , quiver diagrams representing bosonic matter contents and those representing fermionic matter contents are different .",
    "it would be interesting to find a mechanism to provide such asymmetric matter contents from brane configurations .",
