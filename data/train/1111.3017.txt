    "graphene , which is a one - atom thick layer of carbon atoms has many exceptional properties@xcite making it one of the most interesting topics in condensed matter physics .",
    "the principle feature of graphene is that the quasi - particle excitations satisfy the dirac equation , where the speed of light @xmath0 is replaced by the so - called fermi velocity @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , the quantum field theory methods are very useful in the physics of graphene . by applying these methods ,",
    "one can explain anomalous hall effect in graphene , the universal optical absorption rate , the faraday effect , and predict the casimir interaction of graphene , and do much more .",
    "the purpose of this article is to give a non - technical introduction to and a short overview of the use of quantum field theory in graphene .",
    "we start in the next section with a derivation of the dirac model from the tight binding model and a discussion of possible generalizations of the former .",
    "quantum filed theory calculations in the dirac model are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec - pol ] at the example of polarization operator .",
    "this operator is then used in sec .",
    "[ sec - qhe ] to explain the anomalous hall conductivity of graphene , which is proportional to @xmath2 with an integer @xmath3 .",
    "next , in sec .",
    "[ sec - abs ] we derive the universal absorption rate of @xmath4 for optical frequencies . sec .",
    "[ sec - far ] is devoted to explanations of the measured giant faraday effect in graphene and to further study of the polarization rotation . sec .",
    "[ sec - cas ] contains a survey of calculations of the casimir interaction of graphene .",
    "the dirac model for quasi - particles in graphene was elaborated in full around 1984@xcite  twenty years before actual discovery of graphene .",
    "however , its basic properties , like the linearity of the spectrum , etc . , were well known and widely used much earlier due to the 1947 paper by wallace@xcite . the purpose of most of the works of the time was to describe graphite rather than graphene . for more details on the development and formulation of the dirac model",
    "we refer the reader to a recent review@xcite .",
    "in graphene , the carbon atoms form a honeycomb lattice ( see fig .  [ lattice ] ) with two triangular sublattices a and b. the lattice spacing is @xmath5 .",
    "the nearest neighbors of an atom from the sublattice a belong to the sublattice b , and vice versa . by adding to the location of an atom in the sublattice a any of the three vectors @xmath6 one arrives to the location of one of the nearest neighbors in the sublattice b.        in the _ tight binding model _ only the interaction between electrons belonging to the nearest neighbors",
    "is taken into account , so that the hamiltonian reads @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the so - called hopping parameter , and the operators @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 are creation and annihilation operators of electrons in the sublattices a and b , respectively .",
    "we adopt the units @xmath13 .",
    "these operators satisfy usual anticommutation relations .",
    "let us represent the wave function through a fourier transform . @xmath14",
    "the sublattice a is generated by shifts along the vectors @xmath15 and @xmath16 . therefore ,",
    "two momenta @xmath17 and @xmath18 are equivalent if @xmath19 for all integer @xmath20 and @xmath21 . representatives of the equivalence classes can be taken in a compact region in the momentum space  the brillouin zone , which is a hexagon with the corners at the points @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "opposite sides of this hexagon are identified , and , in particular , the corners @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are equivalent between themselves , as well as @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are",
    ".    one can calculate @xmath34 so that the stationary schrdinger equation @xmath35 becomes the matrix equation @xmath36 clearly , the eigenvalues read @xmath37 the spectrum is symmetric , with positive and negative parts meeting at the points where @xmath38 . solutions to this condition",
    "are easy to find , and they coincide with the corners of the brillouin zone .",
    "as we have discussed above , only two of the corners are independent .",
    "let us take @xmath39 as two independent solutions , called the dirac points , describing two independent ground states .",
    "the next step is to expand the wave functions around these dirac points , @xmath40 .",
    "we suppose here that @xmath41 is small compared to @xmath42 .",
    "then , one obtains the hamiltonians @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the fermi velocity , @xmath45 are the standard pauli matrices . by substituting in @xmath46 the value of @xmath47 given above and",
    "@xmath48 one obtains a number which is slightly below the commonly accepted value @xmath49 . by introducing a four - component spinor @xmath50",
    ", we can unify @xmath51 in a single dirac hamiltonian @xmath52 , @xmath53 , where we replaced the momenta @xmath54 by partial derivatives , and @xmath55 these @xmath56 gamma matrices are taken in a reducible representation which is a direct sum of two inequivalent @xmath57 representations .",
    "each of these two - component representations for graphene quasiparticles wave - function is somewhat similar to the spinor description of electrons in qed@xmath58 .",
    "however , in the case of graphene this _",
    "pseudo_spin index refers to the sublattice degree of freedom rather than the real spin of the electrons .",
    "the whole effect of the real spin , which by now did not appear in presented dirac model , is just in doubling the number of spinor components , so that we have 8-component spinors in graphene ( @xmath59 species of two  component fermions ) .",
    "we conclude , that the tight binding model is equivalent below the energies @xmath60 to a quasi - relativistic dirac model , where the speed of light is replaced by @xmath44 .",
    "one should keep in mind that the tight binding model itself is an approximation .",
    "one can improve this approximation by considering , for example , couplings between atoms in the same lattice a or b , that is a next - nearest neighbor coupling .",
    "the corresponding energy is estimated to be about @xmath61 , much smaller than the nearest neighbor coupling @xmath8 considered above .",
    "other possible couplings are summarized in ref .. it is expected that with suitable modifications the dirac model is valid at least until the energies of @xmath62 .    under various circumstances",
    ", it may make sense to consider the following modifications of the dirac model .",
    "* one can add an interaction with the electromagnetic field . to preserve gauge invariance ,",
    "this interaction is introduced by replacing the usual partial derivatives by gauge - covariant ones : @xmath63 .",
    "the electromagnetic potential is not confined to the graphene surface , but rather propagates in the ambient @xmath64 dimensional space .",
    "this field may be an external magnetic field , a classical electromagnetic radiation , or quantized fluctuations .",
    "* quasiparticles may have a mass .",
    "this mass is usually very small , but the introduction of a mass parameter may be convenient on theoretical grounds , e.g. , to perform the pauli - villars regularization . *",
    "a more important mass - like parameter is the chemical potential @xmath65 , which describes the quasiparticle density .",
    "this parameter can be easily varied in experiments by applying a gate potential to graphene samples . without a gate potential",
    ", @xmath65 is usually very small in a suspended graphene , but can be significant for epitaxial graphene due to interaction with the substrate . *",
    "impurities in graphene are described by adding a phenomenological parameter @xmath66 which reminds an imaginary mass and enters the propagator of quasiparticles exactly as @xmath67 in the feynman prescription of contour integration . *",
    "finally , most experiments with graphene are done at rather high temperatures , which can be taken into account by usual rules of real or imaginary time thermal field theory .",
    "let us proceed with quantum field theory calculations based on the dirac model . from the dirac hamiltonian one can derive the action @xmath68 where the dots denote any of additional terms described at the end of the previous section .",
    "tilde over @xmath69 means that the space - components are rescaled @xmath70 quantized fermions give rise to an effective action for external electromagnetic field ( given by a sum of one - loop diagrams ) . to the second order in @xmath71",
    ", it reads @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the polarization operator .    as an example , let us consider the polarization operator for a single massive two - component fermion at zero temperature , zero chemical potential , and without external magnetic field .",
    "simple calculations give @xmath74\\eta_l^n \\label{pmn}\\ ] ] with @xmath75 being the levi - civita totally antisymmetric tensor normalized according to @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 .",
    "@xmath79 is the fine structure constant .",
    "the tensor structure of @xmath80 is uniquely defined by quasi - relativistic and gauge invariances up to two functions , @xmath81 and @xmath82 , which read @xmath83 here @xmath84 , and we assume @xmath85 . from eq .",
    "( [ pmn ] ) one might get an impression that the polarization tensor is singular at the @xmath86 limit , or , that @xmath87 is greatly enhanced by the smallness of @xmath44 .",
    "a more careful analysis shows that it is not true , the polarization tensor remains finite in the @xmath86 limit provided the frequency is non - vanishing , @xmath88 .    for more complicated external conditions , like a magnetic field , or for a non - zero chemical potential ,",
    "the quasi - lorentz invariance is broken , and the polarization tensor has a more complicated form than eq .",
    "( [ pmn ] ) .",
    "particular importance of @xmath87 is due to the fact that this tensor defines how the electromagnetic field propagates through graphene .",
    "the full quadratic action for electromagnetic field is @xmath89 , where the effective action ( [ seff ] ) is confined to the surface of graphene , which we place at @xmath90 .",
    "the equations of motion following from this action contain a singular term @xmath91 we extended @xmath92 to a @xmath56 matrix with @xmath93 .",
    "the equations ( [ meq ] ) describe a free propagation of the electromagnetic field outside the surface @xmath90 subject to the matching conditions @xmath94 on that surface .",
    "the polarization tensor and , more generally , feynman diagrams involving @xmath95 dimensional fermions were considered in a large number of papers . still in 1980",
    "s the function @xmath81 ( for @xmath96 ) was calculated in ref .  , while the pseudotensor part was discussed about the same time in the context of the parity anomaly@xcite .",
    "a renormalization group approach to theories with @xmath97 was suggested in ref .  .",
    "in this century , extensive calculations were done by the kiev group and collaborators@xcite .",
    "the formulas ( [ pmn ] ) , ( [ psi ] ) and ( [ phi ] ) are consistent with that calculations .",
    "we proceed with considering some quantum field theory effects in graphene .",
    "specifically , we will be interested in applications of the polarization tensor @xmath98 .",
    "we shall see , that this quantity indeed defines important and interesting physics .",
    "first of all , we note that the polarization tensor can be interpreted in terms of the conductivity of graphene .",
    "indeed , variation of the effective action ( [ seff ] ) with respect to @xmath99 produces an expectation value of the electric current in graphene , i.e. @xmath100 . on the other hand , in the temporal gauge , @xmath101 , the electric field @xmath102 with the frequency @xmath103 is related to the vector potential by @xmath104 . by definition ,",
    "the conductivity is a matrix relating @xmath105 and @xmath106 . in this way , one arrives at the relation @xmath107    to study the conductivity tensor at zero frequency ( the dc conductivity ) one puts the graphene sample in a constant magnetic field perpendicular to its surface and measures the anti - diagonal conductivity as a function of the chemical potential @xmath65 .",
    "this is precisely the set - up for hall experiments .",
    "for a one - layer graphene it was observed@xcite that the off - diagonal ( hall ) conductivity is quantized according to the law @xmath108 i.e. , the conductivity is proportional to half - integer numbers .",
    "this particular type of the hall effect is called anomalous , or unconventional integer , or half - integer quantum hall effect . starting with the dirac model",
    ", the behavior ( [ qhe ] ) was predicted in ref . by using the feynman diagram approach described above , and in ref . from numerical simulations .",
    "this wonderful agreement between theory and experiment was the first confirmation of existence of the dirac quasi - particles in graphene .",
    "it is interesting to note , that the half - integer quantum hall effect is observed in the mono - layer graphene only .",
    "the double - layer graphene , for example , exhibits conventional integer quantum hall effect .",
    "this does not however imply that the dirac model is not applicable to double - layer graphenes .",
    "the later case may be recovered if one carefully considers phases of determinant of the dirac operator@xcite .",
    "another physical effect defined by the polarization operator is the absorption of light by a suspended monolayer graphene . in the simplest set - up",
    "one can neglect the chemical potential , suppose that there is no external magnetic field and put temperature to zero , @xmath109 .",
    "consequently , one can use the polarization operator ( [ pmn ] ) , where , because of @xmath59 generations of fermions in graphene , the scalar part @xmath81 is multiplied by @xmath110 , while the pseudo - scalar part @xmath82 cancells out .",
    "the cancellation occurs due to the form of gamma - matices ( [ gam ] ) , containing two inequivalent representations related by the parity transformations . in other words",
    ", we need to make a substitution @xmath111 let us consider a plane wave with the frequency @xmath103 propagating along the @xmath112-axis from @xmath113 with the initial polarization parallel to @xmath114 , which is being reflected by and transmitted through the graphene sample @xmath115 where @xmath116 are unit vectors in the direction @xmath117 . the mass - shell condition ( free maxwell equations away of the graphene sample ) implies @xmath118 . for such waves the matching conditions ( [ match ] ) simplify , @xmath119 where we used ( [ pmn ] ) and ( [ subs ] ) .",
    "the transmission coefficients can be easily found , see e.g. ref .",
    ", @xmath120 the intensity of transmitted light thus reads @xmath121 one can reformulate this result in terms of conductivity by noting that @xmath122 , as follows from ( [ pmn ] ) and ( [ sipi ] ) .    at large frequencies , @xmath123",
    ", we have @xmath124 , yielding @xmath125 .",
    "the same conclusion is also valid if the polarization tensor is calculated with more general external conditions@xcite .",
    "therefore , we confirm the prediction of refs . made on somewhat different theoretical grounds of universal absorption rate of @xmath126% , that was confirmed by the experiment@xcite .",
    "clearly , this uniform absorption rate is much larger than one would expect from a one - atom thick layer .",
    "the faraday effect reminds very much the hall effect at `` non - zero frequencies '' , and this analogy was used in ref .   to conjecture that the former should be common for hall systems .",
    "the set - up is , therefore , very similar : a graphene sample subject to a constant magnetic field perpendicular to its surface . instead of the hall conductivity",
    ", we shall be interested in the rotation of the polarization plane of a light beam passing through the surface of graphene .",
    "the frequency of photons shall be kept as a variable parameter , as well as the chemical potential .",
    "it can be shown that it is usually sufficient to consider the zero - temperature case only , but impurities are essential .    by solving again the matching conditions ( [ match ] ) for plane wave ( [ az ] ) , but now with a polarization operator calculated in presence of constant magnetic field , one finds that the angle @xmath127 of polarization rotation and the intensity @xmath128 of transmitted light are given by @xmath129 where we used ( [ sipi ] ) to express the @xmath92 components through diagonal and hall conductivities of graphene .",
    "an experiment@xcite made recently demonstrated a `` giant '' faraday rotation angle of about @xmath130rad peaked at low frequencies for a magnetic field of about @xmath131  tesla .",
    "a theoretical study@xcite shows a good agreement between this experiment and the dirac model . besides",
    ", the dirac model predicts other effects , like step - function like behavior of the rotation angle and the peaks at higher frequencies .",
    "another interesting theoretical observation is that although the data of ref .",
    "@xcite can be nicely fitted by the drude formula for conductivity , this drude - like behavior can not be uniformly extended for all frequencies .",
    "the casimir effect@xcite , which is one of the main topics of this workshop , is sometimes understood as any manifestation of the zero point energy .",
    "we consider the casimir effect in a stricter sense , as an interaction of two uncharged well - separated bodies due to quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic vacuum . in the framework of the present review ,",
    "let us take a suspended graphene sample separated by the distance @xmath10 from a parallel plane ideal conductor . under these conditions , one can neglect @xmath132 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 , but the temperature will be non - zero , in general .",
    "the lowest - order diagram which gives the casimir free energy is@xcite @xmath133 where the photon propagator satisfies conductor boundary conditions on the surface @xmath134 .",
    "( we use the free energy since this is the relevant quantity at finite temperature ) . in this expression ,",
    "one of the boundaries ( conductor ) is taken into account exactly , while the other one ( graphene ) - perturbatively , at the first order of @xmath135 .",
    "a better approximation may be obtained by considering a closed loop of a propagator satisfying both conductor boundary conditions at @xmath134 and the matching conditions ( [ match ] ) at @xmath90 .",
    "this boils down to the use of the lifshitz@xcite formula @xmath136 \\ , ,          \\label{el}\\ ] ] where @xmath137 , and @xmath138 are the matsubara frequencies .",
    "@xmath139 are the reflection coefficients for the te and tm modes at each of the two surfaces . for the second surface , which is an ideal conductor , we have @xmath140 , @xmath141 . the reflection coefficients for graphene",
    "are calculated similarly to the case considered in sec .",
    "[ sec - abs ] , though at non - zero temperature and arbitrary tangential momenta the calculations are more complicated .",
    "it is an interesting exercise to check that at the @xmath142 order the lifshitz formula reproduces the two - loop diagram ( [ e1 ] ) . at zero temperature",
    "both approaches give consistent result of the order of @xmath143 ( for the lifshitz formula ) of the casimir interaction between two ideal metals@xcite in the view of sec .",
    "[ sec - abs ] , this is not very surprising .",
    "some unexpected features appear at non - zero temperature@xcite .",
    "the perturbative result ( [ e1 ] ) rapidly becomes unreasonably large for growing @xmath144 signalling that we have left the perturbative region .",
    "roughly speaking , this effect is caused by a competition between two small parameters , @xmath135 and @xmath44 .",
    "the non - perturbative free energy ( [ el ] ) also grows with increase of the dimensionless parameter @xmath145 , and , at the large @xmath144 asymptotics we have @xmath146 which is just a half of the interaction between two ideal metals in the same regime , or is the same value as for non - ideal metals described by the so - called drude model !",
    "thus , the casimir interaction of graphene at high temperature is extremely strong .",
    "this agrees qualitatively with ref .   where the casimir interaction of two graphene samples was considered .",
    "we conclude this section with some references .",
    "other papers which study the casimir effect for graphene are refs .  .",
    "some earlier calculations used the hydrodynamic model for the electrons in graphene@xcite .",
    "since this model does not reproduce the linear dispersion law characteristic for graphene , this line of research was abandoned .",
    "more details on the presents status of casimir effect in graphene can be found in ref .  .",
    "the main message of this paper is that quantum field theory calculations based on the dirac model of quasiparticles are extremely effective in describing the physics of graphene .",
    "one of the reasons for this effectiveness is the equivalence between the tight binding model and the dirac model for small momenta .",
    "it is interesting to note that a single one - loop diagram of the polarization tensor considered in sec .",
    "[ sec - pol ] is responsible for many physical phenomena , such as the hall and faraday effects and the uniform light absorption rate ( where all experiments are in a good agreement with theory ) , and the casimir interaction of graphene ( where no experiment has been done so far ) .",
    "all the effects discussed above are very strong , much stronger than one would expect from a one - atom thick layers .",
    "since parameters of the dirac model may differ considerably from sample to sample of graphene , it makes sense to perform various types of experiments with the same samples .",
    "e.g. , one can combine optical measurements with casimir experiments .",
    "some topics were not considered here , though they definitely deserve being mentioned .",
    "one of such topics is the graphene nanoribbons . before calculating the polarization tensor , one should define boundary conditions which are compatible with quantum field theory .",
    "such an analysis was performed in ref .  .",
    "another extremely intersting topic is the topological effects in graphene ( see refs .   for a review ) , which includes the jackiw - pi model@xcite , applications of the index theorem , curvature effects , etc .",
    "this list of missing points is not exhaustive .",
    "there is much more in the area of applications of quantum field theory to graphene .",
