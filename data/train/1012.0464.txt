    "the study of dynamical processes on nonuniform or complex networks has attracted much attention ( motter et .",
    "2006 ; newman , barabsi and watts , 2006 ) .",
    "in particular , the influence of the network topology have been investigated on phenomena such as synchronization ( barahona and pecora , 2002 ) , pattern formation ( cosenza and tucci , 2001 ) , spatiotemporal intermittency ( cosenza and tucci , 2002 ) , phase - ordering and critical phenomena ( dorogovtsev , goltsev and mendes , 2008 ) , among others .    in this context",
    ", there has been interest in the research of the phenomenon of nontrivial collective behavior in dynamical networks .",
    "this phenomenon arises when dissimilar forms of temporal evolution of macroscopic and microscopic quantities coexist in a system ( manrubia , mikhailov and zanette , 2004 ) .",
    "two different manifestations of nontrivial collective behavior have been investigated .",
    "on one hand , there is emergence of order in the time evolution of the dynamics of macroscopic quantities of a system of chaotic elements .",
    "for example , the spatial average of the states of the elements may be periodic in time , while the evolution of the individual dynamics of these elements is chaotic and desynchronized . this kind of collective behavior has been widely studied ( kaneko , 1990a ; kaneko , 1994 ; chate and manneville , 1992 ; cosenza and gonzlez , 1998 ) .",
    "the counterpart of this phenomenon has also been observed : the persistence of collective chaos or temporal disorder at the macroscopic level in systems of interacting elements whose individual dynamics is periodic .",
    "this nontrivial behavior has been called _ collective chaos _ ( politi , livi , oppo and kapral , 1993 ;",
    "kapral , livi , oppo and politi , 1994 ; kapral , livi , oppo and politi , 1997 ) and is one of the least understood emergent phenomena in complex systems .",
    "stable collective chaos consists of an irregular behavior that can not be described by the presence of repellers in the phase space of the system , producing , as a consequence , the divergence of nearby trajectories .",
    "moreover , in such systems , the duration time of the transient regime can scale exponentially with respect to the size system , and the final stable attractor can not be reached in the practical sense for large enough systems ( crutchfield and kaneko , 1988 ; kaneko , 1990b ; politi et al . , 1993 ; cecconi , livi and politi , 1998 ; bagnoli and cecconi , 2001 ) .",
    "this type of irregular collective behavior that occurs in systems of coupled periodic dynamic elements is different from the phenomenon of transient chaos , which is a truly chaotic regime with a finite lifetime , and is characterized by the coexistence of stable attractors and non - attractive chaotic sets ( repellers ) in the phase space of a system ( tel and lai , 2008 ) . in such systems",
    ", a generic initial configuration typically produces an irregular trajectory until it suddenly collapses into a non - chaotic attractor ( wackerbauer and showalter , 2003 ) . in the case of stable collective chaos ,",
    "the transient collective behavior , which is usually considered irrelevant , is chaotic and statistically stationary .",
    "the behavior of the system in the transient regime can not be distinguished from a typical chaotic behavior .",
    "for this reason , we speak of the existence of supertransients , since the chaotic collective behavior is , even for a system of moderately small size , the only behavior observable in practice .",
    "this phenomenon was first reported in a network of coupled chaotic maps ( crutchfield and kaneko , 1988 ; kaneko , 1990b ) .",
    "this system may exhibit , for a system of @xmath1 elements and taking into account the speed and precision of the computer , a characteristic time of the supertransitory regime of about @xmath2 years ( crutchfield and kaneko , 1988 ) .",
    "this result has a deep impact on some physical processes that are not yet fully understood , such as turbulence in fluids or the observation of aperiodic behaviors in complex systems .",
    "such processes could correspond , from a strictly mathematical point of view , to a transient state . in practice",
    ", we may never reach the final regular behavior .",
    "thus , the truly stationary , observable behavior will be the supertransitory regime of collective chaos ( bagnoli and cecconi , 2001 ) .",
    "transient spatiotemporal chaos has been studied in reaction - diffusion continuous systems , such as gray - scott s equations ( wackerbauer and showalter , 2003 ; wackerbauer and kobayashi , 2007 ; wackerbauer , 2007 ; yonker and wackerbauer , 2006 ) , where it has been found that the spatial boundary conditions can induce the collapse of transient chaos towards a fixed point . on the other hand ,",
    "long transients appear in networks of model neurons when the number of connetions per neuron is small ( zillmer , brunel and d. hansel , 2009 ) .    in this article",
    "we investigate the influence of the topology of the connectivity in the process of collapse of collective chaos in networks of interacting dynamical elements .",
    "recently , intensive research has been performed on the theory and applications of small - world networks ( newman , barabasi and watts , 2006 ) .",
    "they constitute a class of networks with a high degree of local clustering and a small characteristic length between any two elements ( watts and strogatz , 1998 ) .",
    "it has been shown that small - world networks describe many natural and artificial networks . by varying a parameter",
    ", small - world networks can be continuously tuned between ordered , deterministic lattices and completely random networks . in this paper",
    "we consider a coupled map model defined on a small - world network that exhibits the phenomenon of collective chaos and show its collapse as a result of the variation in the connection topology of the system . because of their discrete spatial nature , coupled map systems are especially appropriate for investigating dynamical processes occurring in heterogeneous media or in complex networks .",
    "we use the algorithm of construction of small - world networks originally proposed by watts and strogatz ( watts and strogatz , 1998 ) . we start from a ring with @xmath3 nodes , where each node is connected to its @xmath4 nearest neighbors , @xmath4 being an even number",
    ". then each connection is rewired at random with probability @xmath0 to any other node in the network , to avoid self - connections . after the rewiring process , the number of elements coupled to each site  which we call neighbors of that site  may vary , but the total number of links in the network is constant and equal to @xmath5 .",
    "it is assumed that all links are bidirectional .",
    "the condition @xmath6 is employed in the algorithm to ensure that no node is isolated after the rewiring process , which results in a connected graph . for @xmath7 ,",
    "the network is completely regular , while for @xmath8 , the resulting network is completely random . with this algorithm ,",
    "a small - world network is formed for values of the probability in the range @xmath9 .",
    "the state of each node in the network can be characterized by a continuous variable , which evolves according to a deterministic rule depending on its own state and the states of neighboring nodes .",
    "we define a diffusively coupled map system on this network as @xmath10 \\ ,",

    "( [ eq : cml ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig1 ] shows the bifurcation diagram of the mean field , @xmath38 , and the average standard deviation @xmath31 as functions of coupling parameter @xmath18 for a network with @xmath39 and @xmath7 , which corresponds to a one - dimensional regular lattice .",

    "the global attractor of the system must be a synchronized orbit equal to the superstable period - three of the local maps .",
    "however , we observe that the quantity @xmath45 , indicating that the system does not reach a synchronized state in its long - term evolution . the convergence time to get",
    "the synchronized periodic asymptotic state is extremely large .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig1 ] shows evidence of the phenomenon of collective stable chaos occurring in this system .    to study the effects of long - range interactions in the phenomenon of stable chaos in the system eq .",
    "( [ eq : cml ] ) , we calculate the quantity @xmath31 as a function of the rewiring probability @xmath0 , as shown in figure  [ fig : fig2 ] .",
    "there is a critical value of the probability @xmath0 above which the system reaches a synchronized state , characterized by @xmath46 .",
    "this synchronized state corresponds to the superstable orbit of superstable period - three of the local map eq .",

    "( [ eq : cml ] ) implies that the chaotic behavior observed for certain ranges of @xmath0 in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] will eventually converge towards the stable period - three attractor of the local map .",
    "however , the regime of collective chaos is , indeed , supertransient for those parameter values . we have verified that , even for a small system consisting of @xmath53 maps , it requires about @xmath54 iterations to reach the synchronized period - three state .",
    "thus , in practice , collective stable chaos becomes the actual observable macroscopic state for those values of parameters .",
    "the existence of a supertransitory regime such as collective stable chaos can not be distinguished from a typical stable chaotic behavior in a system .",
    "for this reason the supertransitory states are , even for a moderately small system , the only real observable behavior .",
    "figure [ fig : fig2 ] shows that the system can reach the synchronized state of period three by changing the topology of the network .",
    "the presence of long - range interactions between the nodes , favored by increasing the rewiring probability @xmath0 , facilitates the transmission of information and the possibility of synchronization in small - world and random networks , and therefore contributes to the collapse of collective stable chaos .",
    "our results indicate that the persistence of collective chaos in spatiotemporal systems depends on topological properties of the spatial substrate and , therefore , are not robust properties .",
