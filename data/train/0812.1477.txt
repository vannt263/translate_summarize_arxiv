    "the study of semiconductor spintronics has attracted a great deal of attention for its potential application to spin - based devices.@xcite among different prerequisites for realizing these devices , such as efficient spin injection@xcite and suitable spin lifetime,@xcite long spin diffusion / transport length@xcite is required sometimes , especially for the design of spin transistor and spin valve .",
    "therefore , it is important to investigate the spin diffusion / transport in semiconductors .    in the study of spin diffusion / transport , the two - component drift - diffusion model",
    "is widely used in the literature.@xcite in this model the spin - diffusion length @xmath0 is connected to spin - relaxation time @xmath1 through spin - diffusion coefficient @xmath2 : @xmath3,@xcite with @xmath2 usually assumed to be equal to the charge - diffusion coefficient @xmath4.@xcite this equation implies infinitely long spin - diffusion length when the spin - relaxation time @xmath1 goes to infinity . in bulk si , there is no dyakonov - perel ( dp ) spin - orbit coupling@xcite due to the bulk inversion - symmetry .",
    "thus the dp spin - relaxation mechanism@xcite is absent and the spin - relaxation time in bulk si is infinite when the other spin - relaxation mechanisms ( such as the elliott - yafet mechanism@xcite ) are ignored .",
    "therefore , an extremely long or even infinite spin - diffusion length is expected in bulk si . however",

    "very recently , appelbaum _ et al .",
    "_ studied the spin transport in bulk si with a magnetic field perpendicular to both directions of spin transport and spin polarization.@xcite it has been shown that the spin - diffusion length is very small when the magnetic field becomes slightly strong ( typically the spin - diffusion length is about several microns when the magnetic field is in the order of 0.1  t).@xcite to account for the experimental spin relaxation and dephasing ( r&d ) along spin transport as well as the small spin - diffusion length , the drift - diffusion model was utilized and the interference among different spin - precession angles when reaching the same distance due to distinct transit times was suggested to be important.@xcite in fact , this spin r&d along spin diffusion due to the magnetic field in the absence of the dp spin - relaxation mechanism was predicted from a fully microscopic approach , i.e. , the kinetic spin bloch equation ( ksbe ) approach,@xcite back in 2002.@xcite in this approach , the momentum - dependent spin precessions give rise to the inhomogeneous broadening.@xcite in the presence of the inhomogeneous broadening , any scattering ( including the spin - conserving scattering ) leads to an irreversible spin r&d.@xcite in spin diffusion / transport , it has been shown that the inhomogeneous broadening is determined by the spin - precession frequency @xmath5 when the spin diffusion / transport is along the @xmath6-axis.@xcite here @xmath7 is the dp term.@xcite it was shown in ref .   that even when @xmath8 , the @xmath9 dependence in @xmath10 still causes spin r&d .",
    "this is exactly the case in the experimental work on si .",
    "the present work is to investigate the spin diffusion in si / sige quantum wells ( qws ) by means of the ksbe approach , in order to gain a deeper insight into the spin relaxation along spin diffusion in the absence of the dp spin - relaxation mechanism .",
    "the qws are symmetric with even number of monoatomic si layers and ideal heterointerfaces to exclude the rashba spin - orbit coupling.@xcite in addition , the study of spin relaxation in asymmetric si / sige qws has been carried out theoretically@xcite and experimentally,@xcite showing that the rashba spin - orbit coupling@xcite is very small ( typically about three orders of magnitude smaller than that in qw structures based on iii - v semiconductors@xcite ) and the spin - relaxation time is quite long ( in the order of @xmath11  s).@xcite thus even for asymmetric si / sige qws , the present study still makes senses as long as the dp term @xmath12 is weak enough compared to the magnetic - field term @xmath13 .",
    "we start our investigation from an @xmath14-type symmetric si / sige qw with its growth direction along the @xmath15 $ ] direction .",
    "the lowest conduction band in bulk si is located near the @xmath16 points of the brillouin zone . due to the quantum confinement along the @xmath17-direction ,",
    "the two degenerate @xmath18 valleys lie lower than @xmath19 and @xmath20 valleys .",

    "however , in the presence of scattering , this decay becomes irreversible , as shown in the exponential damping term for each @xmath84 in eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) . therefore , even without the dp term , there is spin relaxation accompanying the spin diffusion . due to the factor @xmath85 included in eq .",

    "it has been shown earlier that , in systems with the dp spin - orbit coupling , the scattering on one hand provides the spin - r&d channel in the presence of the inhomogeneous broadening from the dp term but , on the other hand , can have a counter - effect on the inhomogeneous broadening.@xcite in the strong scattering limit , the counter - effect dominates and thus increasing scattering strength results in a suppression of spin r&d in time domain@xcite or an enhancement of spin diffusion / transport in spatial domain.@xcite however , for the current case without the dp spin - orbit coupling , the scattering shows _",
    "no _ counter - effect on the inhomogeneous broadening but just suppresses the spin diffusion . except for the above analysis based on the simplified model , to gain a complete picture of the problem of spin diffusion",
    ", one must solve the ksbes taking into account the electron - phonon and electron - electron coulomb scatterings , both of which play an important role on spin r&d .",
    "to numerically solve the ksbes , the double - side boundary conditions are used.@xcite these conditions assume a steady spin polarization @xmath23 for electrons with @xmath90 at boundary @xmath22 and a vanishing spin polarization at finite sample length @xmath91 for electrons with @xmath92.@xcite for the poisson equation , the boundary conditions are set to be @xmath93 .",

    ", we also plot the absolute value of @xmath98 _ vs. _ @xmath6 on a log - scale in the same figure .",
    "all these curves indicate obvious spin relaxation along spin diffusion without the dp spin - relaxation mechanism . by comparing the curves labeled as `` ee '' and ``",
    "ei '' , one finds that the electron - electron coulomb scattering can suppress spin diffusion effectively .",
    "in fact , the coulomb scattering plays an important role in both spin r&d@xcite and spin diffusion / transport.@xcite in a system with the dp spin - orbit coupling , the coulomb scattering not only contributes to the total momentum relaxation time @xmath99,@xcite but also has a counter - effect to the inhomogeneous broadening.@xcite therefore , in the strong scattering limit , adding coulomb scattering may suppress the spin relaxation and enhance the spin diffusion / transport.@xcite for the current situation without the dp spin - orbit coupling , the coulomb scattering affects the spin diffusion only through @xmath99 and thus only suppresses the spin diffusion / transport .",
    "similarly , the electron - phonon scatterings , including both the intra- and inter - valley scatterings , also contribute to the momentum relaxation and suppress spin diffusion effectively , as shown by the `` ep '' curve . for the case of stronger scattering strength ( i.e. , with all the different scatterings included ) , the spin - diffusion length becomes much smaller .",
    "it is also noted that with the increase of scattering strength , the spatial spin - precession period decreases .",
    "this is because the spin - precession frequency increases with @xmath88 as shown in eq .",

    "the magnetic - field dependence of spin diffusion is investigated as well , with the results corresponding to different magnetic fields shown in fig .",
    "it is revealed that both the spin - diffusion length and the spin - precession period decrease with an increase of magnetic field strength @xmath100 .",

    "( [ eq3 ] ) .",

    "it is noted that when @xmath107  k , the spin diffusion is _ insensitive _ to the electron density .",
    "that is because the electrons are nondegenerate in the studied electron - density regime when @xmath107  k , due to the large transverse effective electron mass in @xmath16 valleys of si .",
    "however , when @xmath109 decreases to 10  k , the effect of electron density on the spin diffusion can be seen , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) . in the large density regime where the electrons become degenerate , the spin diffusion length increases with the electron density ( compare the situations with @xmath110 and 1.0@xmath96  @xmath97 ) .",
    "this is mainly due to the decrease of the damping rate with @xmath111 , as shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) .",
    "in addition , in the low density regime it is shown that the density again has a marginal effect on spin diffusion ( compare the situations with @xmath112 and 0.5@xmath96  @xmath97 ) , as the electrons remain nondegenerate there .",
    "it is noted that the density dependence of spin diffusion in si is very different from the density dependence of the spin relaxation in gaas qws where non - monotonic density dependence was predicted@xcite and realized experimentally very recently.@xcite this is due to the fact that in gaas qws the inhomogeneous broadening comes from the dp term which is , however , absent in the symmetric si / sige qws .",

    "in summary , the present work investigates the spin diffusion in symmetric si / sige ( 001 ) qws at low temperature .",
