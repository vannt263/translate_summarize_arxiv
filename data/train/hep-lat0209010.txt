    "numerical simulations of lattice field theories are usually performed in the lagrangian formulation .",
    "nonetheless , we think there are very good reasons to develop numerical simulation techniques for the hamiltonian approach  @xcite : powerful many - body techniques are available  @xcite , which allow the direct computation of the vacuum wave function properties ; fermions are implemented directly and need not be integrated out ; properties like the mass spectrum are more immediate .",
    "finally , universality checks between the lagrangian and the hamiltonian formalism are very welcome .",
    "we study the hamiltonian lattice version of the two - dimensional wess - zumino model described in refs .",
    "@xcite ; we only wish to highlight here the main features of the formulation .    in the hamiltonian formalism ,",
    "since @xmath0 is conserved , it is possible to preserve exactly a 1-dimensional subalgebra of the original supersymmetry algebra , i.e. , we can write @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is a fermionic charge . this subalgebra is enough to guarantee some of the most important property of supersymmetry , including a non - negative spectrum , and pairing of fermionic and bosonic states of nonzero energy ; spontaneous breaking of supersymmetry is equivalent to a strictly positive ground - state energy @xmath3 ; the full supersymmetry algebra is recovered in the continuum limit together with lorentz invariance .    in order to obtain a hamiltonian free of fermion sign problems , and therefore amenable to quantum monte carlo methods",
    ", we adopt free boundary conditions , with lattice size @xmath4 .",
    "the model is parametrized by a _",
    "@xmath5 , an arbitrary polynomial in the bosonic field .",
    "the two - dimensional wess - zumino model is superrenormalizable ; fields do not renormalize , and only @xmath5 needs to be normal ordered .    in strong coupling at leading order",
    ", the model reduces to independent copies of supersymmetric quantum mechanics , one for each site ; supersymmetry is broken if and only if the degree of the prepotential @xmath6 is even  @xcite . in weak coupling , on the other hand",
    ", supersymmetry is broken at tree level if and only if @xmath6 has no zeroes .",
    "the predictions of strong coupling and weak coupling are quite different , and it is interesting to study the crossover from strong to weak coupling .",
    "we perform our simulations using the green function monte carlo ( gfmc ) algorithm  @xcite .",
    "a discussion of gfmc in the context of the present problem can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite ; we only wish to remark the main features of the algorithm : the aim is to generate a stochastic representation of the ground - state wavefunction , which is then used to compute expectation values of observables .",
    "statistical fluctuations are reduced with the help of a guiding wavefunction , whose free parameters are determined dynamically during the simulation . in order to keep the variance of observables finite as the simulation proceeds ,",
    "it is necessary to simulate a population of @xmath7 _ walkers _ ( field configurations at fixed time ) , and extrapolate the results to @xmath8 .",
    "we focus on the case @xmath9 ; strong coupling always predicts supersymmetry breaking ; weak coupling predicts unbroken supersymmetry for @xmath10 ; according to ref .",
    "@xcite , unbroken supersymmetry should be accompanied by a nonzero @xmath11 ( parity breaking ) .",
    "perturbative computations show that @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the adimensional lattice bare coupling , @xmath14 is the renormalized ( continuum ) coupling , with dimension of @xmath15 , defined at the mass scale @xmath16 , and @xmath17 is the lattice spacing .",
    "we study , as @xmath18 , the trajectory @xmath19 corresponding to a perturbative rg trajectory ( [ eq : evol2_l ] ) ; the effect of @xmath20 is small in the range we considered , therefore we expect eq .",
    "( [ eq : trajectory ] ) to be a reasonable approximation to a true rg trajectory .",
    "we estimate the correlation length from the exponential decay of the connected correlation function @xmath21 averaged over all @xmath22 pairs with @xmath23 , excluding pairs for which @xmath24 or @xmath25 is closer to the border than ( typically ) 8 . in our formulation , fermions are staggered and even / odd @xmath26 correspond to different channels .",
    "we begin with the discussion of the case @xmath27 , for which we have obtained the statistics of @xmath28 gfmc iterations .",
    "the even-@xmath26 channel is plotted in fig .  [",
    "fig : xieven , l2=0.35 ] ; it is very difficult to extract a correlation length , presumably because @xmath29 has a very small overlap with the lightest state of the channel , and the value of @xmath30 quoted in fig .",
    "[ fig : xieven , l2=0.35 ] should be considered tentative .",
    "the odd-@xmath26 channel , plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : xiodd , l2=0.35 ] , is much cleaner , and it is possible to estimate @xmath30 with a good precision .    for the other values of @xmath31 , the situation is similar but with larger errors ; we have a statistics of at least @xmath32 iterations , which we are increasing to @xmath28 .",
    "the values of @xmath33 follow nicely the expected behavior @xmath34 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : xioddlog ] : the entire range @xmath35 seem to be in the scaling region , with @xmath36 a borderline case .",
    "the values of @xmath37 have very large errors , and it is hard to draw any conclusion from them .",
    "we measure the ground state energy @xmath3 along the trajectory ( [ eq : trajectory ] ) ; the measurements have a very small statistical error , ranging from 1% for @xmath38 ( where @xmath39 ) to 0.1% for @xmath36 .",
    "we extrapolate to @xmath40 and @xmath8 fitting @xmath41 to the form @xmath42",
    "@xmath41 is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : e0log ] : it seems to behave @xmath43 , while nave scaling would predict @xmath44 .",
    "the value of @xmath41 ( disregarding this puzzling exponent ) and the lack of any signal for a breakdown of parity ( like a double - peaked distribution of @xmath29 ) strongly hint that the trajectory ( [ eq : trajectory ] ) belongs to the phase with broken supersymmetry and zero @xmath11 .",
