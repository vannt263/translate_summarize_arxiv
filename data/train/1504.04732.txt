    "this is the first in a series of papers about the numerical treatment of collapsing gravitational waves using a new pseudospectral code developed for the problem . in the early  @xmath1s critical phenomena",
    "were discovered in gravitational collapse  @xcite , in spherical symmetry , with general relativity minimally coupled to a massless scalar field .",
    "one aspect of the finding was that , amazingly , the critical solution dividing the formation of a blackhole from dissipation of the field , was unique , in the sense that if one takes any one parameter family of initial data , with the parameter controlling somehow the strength of the data , and tunes this parameter to the threshold of blackhole formation , one finds that the same solution is always obtained , regardless of the family ! shortly thereafter similar phenomenology was reported in axisymmetric , vacuum general relativity  @xcite , or in other words in the collapse of gravitational waves . since then",
    "multiple studies have been performed to reproduce this finding , albeit with different initial data and numerical approaches , but without success . perhaps most strikingly , in  @xcite , numerical evidence of a different critical solution was presented .",
    "even if one completely accepts the available evidence for criticality in vacuum collapse , this obviously begs the question whether or not the naive expectation of uniqueness of the critical solution in axisymmetric , rather than spherical , collapse holds .",
    "roughly speaking there are two types of code being used used in  3d numerical relativity .",
    "the first uses the moving puncture method  @xcite , which consists , in essence , of a clever choice of evolved variables and gauge conditions , normally treated numerically by finite differencing . secondly is the pseudospectral method , most prevalently used with a first order generalized harmonic formulation of general relativity by the spec code  @xcite .",
    "recently , we presented a study of the collapse of gravitational waves using the moving puncture method  @xcite , in part to establish how close to the critical regime one can get with this standard approach .",
    "the conclusion being ; not very .",
    "major difficulties included the formation of coordinate singularities and a lack of accuracy .",
    "therefore one would like to tackle the problem using the pseudospectral approach to establish what can be achieved in that setting .",
    "we have thus developed a new pseudospectral code along the lines of spec , specializing the continuum and numerical method as much as possible towards the problem of vacuum gravitational collapse .",
    "the present paper represents the first outcome of this maneuver .",
    "herein we describe the formulation of gr employed , our boundary conditions , the code , calibration of the method , our initial data , our approach to axisymmetric apparent horizons , plus a suite of validation tests for gauge waves , gravitational waves , blackhole and collapse spacetimes . throughout",
    "we compare our results carefully with those in the literature .",
    "we aim to give a body of evidence for the correctness of the method that the reader will find compelling . with this out of the way , in subsequent papers we turn to the problem of critical collapse .",
    "a summary follows before the main text .    in section  [ section : ghg ]",
    "we look at a slightly modified version of the first order generalized harmonic formulation of  @xcite .",
    "we consider constraint preserving , radiation controlling boundary conditions , paying special attention to the constraint preserving boundaries . by considering the reflection of outgoing waves in the linear approximation",
    "we ultimately suggest modified conditions that should reduce spurious reflections caused by the use of constraint damping .",
    "we also suggest alternative gauge boundary conditions .",
    "next , in section  [ section : bamps ] , we outline the ` bamps ` code , including our carefully constructed cubed - sphere grids , which avoid clustering of grid - points in unfortunate positions of the domain .",
    "for the discretization we employ a pure chebyschev approach .",
    "we also discuss our ` octant ' symmetry implementation , the crucial patching - penalty approach for communicating data between neighboring coordinate patches , and finally the boundary implementation . in the follow - up section  [ section : energypenalty ]",
    "we complete the presentation of the penalty method by computing the penalty parameters appropriate for the semi - discrete system .    given the difficulties in the literature in reproducing the results of  @xcite it seems necessary to solve the problem in axisymmetry before moving to examine the collapse of fully  3d waves without symmetry . in our moving puncture gauge study",
    "@xcite a major disadvantage in using the bam code was that 3d grids were employed to evolve axisymmetric data . in section  [ section :",
    "axi ] we present our approach to evolving axisymmetric spacetimes with the ` bamps ` code , for which we employ the cartoon method  @xcite to reduce from the standard ` bamps ` 3d domains to a plane , by using the killing vector to evaluate any angular derivatives .",
    "we discuss various flavors of axisymmetric moment - of - time - symmetry initial data and their numerical construction .",
    "these initial data sets are evolved in a forthcoming study .",
    "we also give a detailed description of our formulation of the apparent horizon conditions in axisymmetry . to the best of our knowledge",
    "this is the first time that the regularity conditions on the symmetry axis have been carefully taken care of .",
    "this is important in later work as the search for apparent horizons will be our key diagnostic tool .",
    "the next three sections  ( [ section : experiments]-[section : supercritical ] ) contain a write - up of our development and validation tests .",
    "the tests include evolutions with the proposed gauge boundary conditions , which we find are helpful when using large gauge source parameters , as desired .",
    "they also include runs comparing the fully 3d , octant symmetry and cartoon evolutions , demonstrating that the various symmetry setups are well - behaved . in the evolution of single blackholes we test different gauges and boundary conditions , and following  @xcite ,",
    "look at evolutions in which the blackhole is perturbed by a gravitational wave injected through the outer boundary .",
    "our results are in good agreement with the earlier studies .",
    "we then examine the evolution of supercritical brill waves , where , after the formation of an apparent horizon the run is continued after interpolation onto an excision grid , as used to evolve a single blackhole , which is needed to evolve data with a horizon for long - times .",
    "finally we conclude in section  [ section : conclusions ] .",
