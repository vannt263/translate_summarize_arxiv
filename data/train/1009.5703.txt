    "resonances arise in many different branches of physics . near a resonance , certain physical observables",
    "are strongly enhanced , allowing one to probe the underlying physics at its `` extreme '' .",
    "resonances come in various types such as tunneling resonances ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , parametric resonances ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , stochastic resonances ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , or fano - feshbach resonances ( see , e.g. , ref .  @xcite ) .",
    "two - body fano - feshbach resonances play a key role in the study of ultracold atomic gases as they allow for the tuning of the interspecies and intraspecies @xmath0-wave scattering length @xmath1 essentially at will while leaving all other system parameters essentially unchanged  @xcite . in the ultracold regime ,",
    "the scattering lengths determine the effective interaction strengths of the system .",
    "thus , the tunability of @xmath1 allows for the realization of effectively repulsive and effectively attractive systems .",
    "furthermore , the interaction strength can be tuned such that the system is effectively non - interacting or infinitely strongly interacting .",
    "recent experiments that rely on this tunability include the study of the bcs - bec crossover problem  @xcite , the polaron problem  @xcite , and the creation of bosonic and fermionic feshbach molecules  @xcite .",
    "these feshbach molecules form an ideal starting point for creating polar molecules in the rovibrational ground state  @xcite .",
    "fano - feshbach resonances have also played a key role in recent experiments aimed at studying few - body physics .",
    "the most prominent example is the observation of efimov physics  @xcite , which relies on tuning the @xmath0-wave scattering length over several orders of magnitude .",
    "efimov physics manifests itself most clearly in the vicinity of resonances .",
    "in particular , efimov physics in the bosonic three - particle sector has been studied through the observation of enhanced three - body recombination loss rates near atom - dimer and atom - atom - atom resonances  @xcite .",
    "an atom - dimer resonance exists when the binding energy of the efimov trimer equals that of the dimer .",
    "an atom - atom - atom resonance exists when the efimov trimer has a zero - energy binding energy , i.e. , sits right at threshold .",
    "similarly , in the bosonic four - particle sector , the expected scaling associated with efimov physics has been confirmed through measurements of enhanced four - body recombination loss rates at atom - atom - atom - atom , atom - trimer and dimer - dimer resonances  @xcite .",
    "an intriguing aspect of the features associated with efimov physics is that the characterization of the three- and four - body sectors requires , for one - component bose gases , just two parameters , the @xmath0-wave scattering length @xmath1 and a three - body parameter , which can for example be parametrized in terms of the binding energy of one of the efimov trimers  @xcite .",
    "these two parameters determine the positions of all universal resonances eluded to above .",
    "efimov physics can also dominate the behavior of fermionic systems consisting of two or more components and of bose - fermi mixtures if the system parameters are tuned appropriately  @xcite .",
    "this paper investigates few - body resonances for two - component systems with infinitely large interspecies @xmath0-wave scattering length @xmath1 in the regime where three - body efimov physics is absent . building on earlier work  @xcite , we address the following questions : ( q1 ) under which conditions do atom - atom - atom resonances occur for the @xmath9 system ?",

    "our solutions to the schrdinger equation are obtained following two distinctly different approaches . on the one hand",
    ", we pursue an analytical treatment that employs hyperspherical coordinates and determines the solution in terms of some unknown . on the other hand",
    ", we solve the schrdinger equation numerically .",
    "the numerical solutions are then used to determine some of the unknowns that arise in the first approach , thereby providing an interpretation of the numerical results and , conversely , a check of the analytical framework .",

    "if @xmath15 ( @xmath16 or @xmath17 ) , no permutation symmetry of the @xmath18th species needs to be imposed ; this implies that the single particle species can be fermionic or bosonic .",

    ", we assume that the particles of the same species are effectively non - interacting , i.e. , we neglect intraspecies interactions . in the case of fermionic species",
    "this assumption is fullfilled with high accuracy for most systems since @xmath0-wave interactions are forbidden by symmetry and @xmath29-wave interactions are naturally suppressed  @xcite .",
