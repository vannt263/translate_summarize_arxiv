    "over the course of the past ten years the deficit of muon neutrinos from cosmic - ray showers in the atmosphere has been firmly established by the super - kamiokande experiment@xcite and confirmed by the macro@xcite and soudan  2@xcite experiments .",
    "the favoured interpretation of the data is @xmath7 neutrino oscillations .",
    "recent results from the super - kamiokande experiment@xcite provide direct evidence for atmospheric neutrino oscillations and yield best fit oscillation parameters of @xmath8 , where @xmath9 .",
    "results from the k2k experiment@xcite provide further confirmation of the @xmath7 oscillation hypothesis .",
    "the 5.4kiloton ( kt ) mass of the recently constructed minos ( main injector neutrino oscillation search ) far detector@xcite is much less than the fiducial mass of the super - kamiokande detector .",
    "however , it does possess one unique advantage , namely it is the first large deep underground detector to have a magnetic field .",
    "this allows studies of neutrino flavour oscillations for neutrinos and anti - neutrinos separately . a separate measurement of @xmath4 and @xmath5 oscillations could provide constraints on cpt violating models@xcite which have been invoked to accommodate simultaneously the solar , atmospheric and lsnd@xcite neutrino oscillation data .",
    "it should be noted that a number of recent studies have indicated difficulties with the cpt violating models ( see for example  @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , a direct measurement of @xmath4 and @xmath5 oscillations is of interest .",
    "in addition , minos is unique in its ability to provide an accurate measurement of the neutrino energy and direction for all contained - vertex @xmath4 charged - current ( cc ) interactions .",
    "this paper presents first results on atmospheric neutrinos from the minos experiment . here ,",
    "only results from @xmath4/@xmath5 cc events with neutrino interaction vertices contained inside the detector volume are considered ; results from events where the neutrino interacts in the surrounding rock will be the subject of a separate publication .",
    "the data used were recorded between august 2003 and february 2005 and correspond to a livetime of @xmath0 giving an exposure of @xmath10 kiloton - years ( @xmath11 kiloton - years fiducial ) .",
    "the data are compared to the expectation in the absence of neutrino oscillations and the favoured hypothesis of @xmath7 oscillations with @xmath12ev@xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the first direct results showing charge separated @xmath4 and @xmath5 atmospheric neutrino interactions are presented .",
    "the minos far detector is located at a depth of @xmath15 meters - water - equivalent ( mwe ) in the soudan mine , northern minnesota .",
    "the far detector is a steel - scintillator sampling calorimeter consisting of two super - modules ( sm ) separated by a gap of 1.1 m .",
    "the detector consists of octagonal planes of 2.54 cm thick steel followed by planes of 1 cm thick extruded polystyrene scintillator and a 2 cm wide air gap .",
    "the first and second sms are comprised of 248 and 236 scintillator planes respectively . each sm is magnetized to an average value of 1.3 t  by a 15ka current loop which runs through the coil hole along the detector central axis and returns below the detector .",
    "each scintillator plane is made up of 192 strips of width 4.1 cm and of length between @xmath16 m depending on position in the plane .",
    "the strips in alternating planes are oriented at @xmath17 to the vertical thereby providing two orthogonal coordinates - axis defined along the detector axis pointing away from fermilab and the @xmath18-axis vertical .",
    "the alternating scintillator planes provide measurements of the @xmath19 and @xmath20 coordinates which are related to @xmath21 and @xmath18 by @xmath22 and @xmath23 . ] .",
    "the scintillation light is collected using wavelength shifting ( wls ) fibers embedded within the scintillator strips .",
    "the wls fibers are coupled to clear optical fibers at both ends of a strip and are read out using 16-pixel multi - anode photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) .",
    "the signals from eight strips , separated by approximately 1 m within the same plane , are optically summed ( multiplexed ) and read out by a single pmt pixel .",
    "the multiplexing pattern is different for the two sides of the detector , which , for a single hit , enables the resulting eightfold ambiguity to be resolved .",
    "for all types of event , the ambiguities are efficiently resolved in software using additional information from timing and event topology .",
    "the detector is optimized for detecting beam neutrinos coming from the direction of fermilab . for the study of atmospheric neutrinos the planar structure",
    "presents a particular problem : cosmic - ray muons traveling almost parallel to the scintillator planes can penetrate deep into the detector by traveling in the steel or air between the planes . to reject this source of background",
    "a scintillator veto shield surrounds the upper part of the main detector .",
    "the veto shield is constructed from the same scintillator modules as used in the main detector but with the orientation of strips aligned along the z - axis .",
    "the veto shield comprises a `` ceiling '' section above the detector , consisting of two scintillator layers , and `` wall '' sections along each of the two sides of the detector formed from a single scintillator layer .",
    "the output signals from each pmt pixel are digitized and time - stamped ( with a 1.5625ns precision ) by the vme - based front - end electronics .",
    "the signals from the pixels are digitized by 14-bit analogue - to - digital converters ( adc ) when the dynode signal from the pmt exceeds a programmable threshold , corresponding to approximately one third of a photo - electron . to reduce the data flow , the pedestal corrected signals",
    "are only written to the daq output buffers if two out of thirty - six channels on the same readout board are above threshold .",
    "these thirty - six channels correspond to the readout on one side of the detector from a contiguous group of either 20 or 24 planes . the raw data rate is approximately 8mbs@xmath24 .",
    "the raw data are transferred to a pc based trigger farm where the data are divided into blocks bounded by regions of 100 clock ticks ( 156ns ) or more where no detector activity has been recorded .",
    "the primary trigger algorithm , applied to these blocks of data , requires there to be activity in at least @xmath25 planes out of any contiguous group of @xmath26 planes .",
    "the veto shield is read out in the same manner as the main detector except that the two out of thirty - six requirement is not applied and the dynode threshold is set to a level corresponding to approximately one and a half photo - electrons .    the minos far detector front - end electronics and data acquisition system are described in detail in  @xcite and  @xcite .      a minimum ionizing particle crossing at normal incidence to a plane gives a combined signal of approximately @xmath27 photo - electrons ( pes ) registered by the pmts at the two ends of the strip .",
    "the detector is calibrated using both a dedicated led system@xcite and cosmic - ray muons .",
    "the adc to pe calibration is performed using the led system and the cosmic - ray muon sample is then used to give a uniform response across the detector . from studies of cosmic - ray muons in the minos detector@xcite , the current uncertainty in the pe calibration is 5% .",
    "cosmic - ray muons are also used to calibrate the recorded times .",
    "after calibration , a single hit timing resolution of approximately 2.3ns is achieved .",
    "the timing calibration tracks all hardware changes .",
    "the data described in this paper were recorded in the 18 month period from august 2003 to february 2005 . only data taken when the minos far detector , including the veto shield , was fully operational are used .",
    "the final data sample corresponds to a livetime of @xmath0 giving an exposure of @xmath10 kiloton - years ( @xmath11 kiloton - years fiducial ) .",
    "the selection of contained - vertex neutrino interactions was optimized using a geant3@xcite simulation of the minos detector . for the simulation of atmospheric neutrino events",
    "the 3d flux calculation of barr  @xcite was used ( bartol 3d ) .",
    "the neugen3 program@xcite was used to simulate the neutrino interactions ( cross sections and hadronic final states ) . the earlier 1d flux calculation from the bartol group@xcite ( bartol 1d ) and",
    "the 3d calculation of battistoni  @xcite were used to assign systematic uncertainties .",
    "the response of the minos detector to electrons , muons and hadrons has been studied in a test beam at the cern ps using the 12.5 ton minos calibration detector@xcite .",
    "the test beam detector was constructed and read out in the same manner as the minos far detector .",
    "the interactions of hadronic particles are modeled with the gcalor package@xcite , which is found to give a reasonable description of low energy hadronic interactions in the minos calibration detector@xcite , rather than the default version of gheisha ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the `` slac version''@xcite of gheisha , which also provides a reasonable description of the test beam data , is used as an alternative model for hadronic interactions .",
    "a monte carlo ( mc ) sample of atmospheric neutrino interactions corresponding to over 1000 live - years was generated and used to optimize both the reconstruction algorithms and the event selection criteria .",
    "two large cosmic - ray muon background samples were generated : a sample of 19 million events full spectrum ( corresponding to approximately 280 days livetime ) and a further 2 million events with @xmath28 ( corresponding to a livetime of 4.1 years ) as lower energy events are an important component of the cosmic - ray muon background to the contained - vertex atmospheric neutrino selection .",
    "a 10% uncertainty on the normalisation of the cosmic - ray background is assigned .",
    "the error reflects the different normalisation obtained when normalising to the entire cosmic - ray sample or normalising to just those cosmic - ray muons which stop in the detector ( these form the main background to the event selection described below ) .",
    "it should be noted that for the results presented in this paper the cosmic - ray background in the selected event sample is estimated from data .",
    "the 10% uncertainty in the cosmic - ray normalisation is only used when comparing data and monte carlo at various stages in the event selection .      the theoretical prediction for the atmospheric neutrino event rate",
    "has large uncertainties from the primary cosmic - ray flux , hadron production models and neutrino interaction cross sections .",
    "the analysis of the soudan  2 @xmath29 data@xcite indicates that the combined prediction of the bartol 3d model@xcite and the neugen3@xcite neutrino cross section model should be scaled by @xmath30@xcite , where the error is statistical and it is implicitly assumed that atmospheric electron neutrinos are not oscillating . this normalization result is compatible with the results from a fit to the soudan  2 data including oscillations .",
    "the minos and soudan  2 detectors are located in the same mine ( _ i.e. _ at the same geomagnetic latitude ) and both are constructed from steel . consequently , for the analysis presented here the soudan  2 scale factor @xmath30 is used to correct the combined event rate predictions from the bartol 3d flux model and the neugen3 neutrino interaction model .",
    "an additional 5% uncertainty is added in quadrature to that estimated by the soudan  2 collaboration to account for differences arising from the different energy thresholds ( @xmath31mev in the case of soudan  2 compared to @xmath32mev for minos ) .",
    "finally an additional 2.5% uncertainty is assigned to account for the different phases in the solar cycle for the soudan  2 and minos data sets@xcite ; because of the relatively high neutrino energy threshold the selected atmospheric neutrino rate in minos depends only weakly on the phase in the solar cycle .",
    "the resulting total systematic uncertainty on the expected event rate is estimated to be 10% .",
    "the minos detector is optimized for beam neutrinos originating from fermilab . due to the curvature of the earth , beam neutrinos",
    "enter the detector from below the horizontal at an angle of @xmath33 with respect to the @xmath34-axis .",
    "the standard minos reconstruction software has been developed for these events .",
    "the analysis presented here uses reconstruction software optimized for atmospheric neutrinos@xcite .",
    "the first stage of the event reconstruction removes the eightfold ambiguity in the association of raw hits to strips .",
    "this is performed utilizing information from both strip ends . for cosmic - ray muons , an average of @xmath35 of the recorded pulse height",
    "is associated with the correct strip . at this stage",
    "the data are in the form of two 2d event views @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "an example event display of a cosmic - ray muon is shown in figure  [ fig : muonevent ] .",
    "tracks and showers are reconstructed independently in each view ; the two views are then matched to obtain a three - dimensional event .",
    "for cosmic - ray events that leave hits in both the veto shield and main minos far detector , the root - mean - square ( rms ) difference in times recorded in veto shield and the detector is @xmath25ns , allowing association of veto shield hits ( indicated in figure  [ fig : muonevent ] ) to activity in the main detector .",

    "a charged - current muon neutrino event is in general reconstructed as a muon track and a hadronic shower .",
    "a typical 1gev muon will traverse approximately 25 planes at normal incidence .",
    "reconstructed tracks are required to consist of at least 8 planes ( corresponding to a minimum energy of 0.4gev ) .",
    "for muons which start and stop within the detector volume the muon momentum is determined from range with a resolution of approximately @xmath39 for muons traveling at normal incidence to the detector planes ( where @xmath40 is measured in gev@xmath41 ) .",
    "the first term is dominated by fluctuations in energy loss and the second is dominated by sampling . for events",
    "where the muon exits the detector , the muon momentum is obtained from the curvature of the track in the magnetic field . for the selected cc atmospheric @xmath4/@xmath5 interactions , where the momentum is determined from curvature , the average momentum resolution is approximately @xmath42\\,\\mathrm{gev}^{-2}$ ] ( where @xmath40 is measured in gev@xmath41 ) .",
    "however , the resolution obtained from individual events depends strongly on how much of the trajectory of the muon is observed before it exits the detector and on the orientation of the trajectory relative to the local magnetic field .",
    "the hadronic energy is obtained by summing the pulse height in a shower which is spatially associated with the start of the track .",
    "the energy scale is obtained from monte carlo using the gcalor@xcite model of hadronic showers , which from the test beam results is found to provide a good description of the detector response to single @xmath43 and protons@xcite .",
    "the hadronic energy resolution is approximately @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is measured in gev .    for the study of atmospheric neutrinos it is necessary to determine whether the reconstructed track is upward or downward going .",
    "a relativistic normal incidence particle traverses ten planes in approximately 2ns which , when compared to the single hit resolution of 2.3ns , is sufficient to identify the direction of most selected events with little ambiguity .",
    "the sense of the direction of muon tracks is determined by comparing the hit times along the reconstructed track with the hypotheses that it is either upward or downward going ( assuming that the particle is traveling at the speed of light ) .",
    "the rms deviations of hit times about each of the two hypotheses are calculated ,  and . the hypothesis with the smallest rms",

    "event containment cuts are also made at the hit level to reduce the sensitivity to possible reconstruction errors where not all hits are correctly associated to the reconstructed track .",
    "for this purpose , the fiducial volume requirement of 50 cm from the detector edges is relaxed to 30 cm . in order to apply the containment cuts at the hit level",
    "it is necessary to convert the two - dimensional coordinates of a single hit into a point in space .",
    "this conversion is achieved by using the mean value of the orthogonal ( u / v ) coordinate in the surrounding two planes .",

    "* veto shield : * the efficiency of the veto shield cut is determined directly from data in two independent ways .",
    "firstly , a sample of cosmic - ray muons that stop in the detector and have @xmath113 is selected .",
    "these events occupy a similar region of phase space to the background .",
    "the veto shield cut rejects @xmath114% of this sample .",
    "a second estimate of the veto shield efficiency is obtained by relaxing the event selection cuts until the sample is dominated by background ( _ i.e. _ an expected signal fraction of less than 2% ) .",
    "the veto shield cut rejects @xmath115% of this sample which , when the expected signal ( assuming @xmath116 ) is taken into account , leads to an estimated veto shield efficiency of @xmath117% .",
    "from these two tests the veto shield efficiency is estimated to be @xmath118% , where the central value is taken from the high statistics stopping muon sample and a systematic error of @xmath119% is added reflecting the difference between the two methods .",
    "the fraction of signal events rejected due to accidental coincidences with hits in the veto shield is estimated by overlaying veto shield hits obtained from special minimum bias data taking runs onto monte carlo atmospheric neutrino events .",
    "the estimated fraction of signal events rejected due to spurious veto shield hits is @xmath120 , where the error represents systematic time dependent variations .",
    "in addition , from monte carlo studies it is estimated that @xmath121% of the selected signal downward - going events will be rejected due to hits in the veto shield associated with the neutrino interaction .",
    "* hadronic response : * the event selection efficiency depends on the detector response to hadrons and consequently the hadronic interaction model used .",
    "comparisons of gcalor and gheisha show no evidence for any significant difference in overall selection efficiency or reconstructed up - down ratio .",
    "the gcalor model is found to provide a good description of the response of the detector to single hadrons .",
    "systematic errors of 2.5% on the selection efficiency and 3.0% on the up - down ratio are assigned ; in both cases the estimates reflect the monte carlo statistical precision of the comparison .    *",
    "scintillator light calibration : * the overall calibration of the minos far detector is currently known to 5% .",
    "the mc response is tuned to agree with cosmic - ray muon data and has a corresponding 5% uncertainty .",
    "because the selection cuts use pulse height information , this leads to systematic errors of 0.6% on the selection efficiency and 0.3% on the up - down ratio .",
    "* timing calibration / resolution : * the timing calibration for each scintillator strip is determined from data in a manner that tracks hardware changes . the uncertainty on the timing calibration for the individual strips is @xmath122ns ,",
    "_ i.e. _ significantly less than the single hit resolution of 2.3ns .",
    "the effect on the selection is negligible .",
    "a more significant effect is that the single hit resolution in mc is better than that in the data , 2.2ns compared to 2.3ns .",
    "this is due to an incomplete simulation of the electronics readout .",
    "for this reason the times of the monte carlo hits are smeared by a gaussian of width 0.7ns .",
    "the difference between the the selection efficiencies before and after this smearing are compared .",
    "the overall selection efficiency for the smeared mc is reduced by 1.0% . the effect on",
    "the up - down ratio is small ( 0.1% ) .",
    "these differences are used as estimates of the systematic uncertainties .    *",
    ":* one of the main cuts in the event selection is the requirement that tracks leave hits in at least 8 scintillator planes .",
    "consequently , the event selection efficiency is sensitive to the monte carlo simulation of muon energy loss .",
    "the simulation of muon energy loss depends on the underlying simulation of the physics processes and the knowledge of the chemical composition of the minos detector .",

    "similarly the effect of changes to the nuclear physics model which affect the rate via pauli blocking of quasi - elastic and nuclear shadowing of dis events was studied .",
