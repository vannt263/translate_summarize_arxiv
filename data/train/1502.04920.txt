    "this feature allows for an electrical separation of the hot source from the actual rectifier which is a crucial prerequisite for energy harvesting applications .    during the past few years",

    ", the off - diagonal onsager coefficients that fully characterize thermoelectric transport in the linear response regime do not have to be equal to each other .",
    "this additional degree of freedom opens up the possibility to have ( at least in principle ) carnot efficiency @xmath0 at finite output power  @xcite .",

    "the resulting flux - dependent oscillations in the current were measured with visibilities reaching over @xmath12  @xcite . due to this high degree of coherence ,",
    "the mzi has been employed successfully in a number of experiments investigating coherent electron transport  @xcite .",
    "the main motivation for our work derives from the fact that in a mzi the energy dependence of the scattering matrix arises from the path length difference between the two interferometer arms only .",
    "thus , any thermoelectric response is of purely quantum mechanical origin .",
    "furthermore , as time - reversal symmetry is broken by the strong magnetic field required for the quantum hall effect , it offers an interesting playground to study the effects of broken time - reversal symmetry on the thermoelectric response in a mesoscopic multi - terminal heat engine .",
    "the rest of the paper is structured as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : mzi ] , we introduce the mzi as well as the important thermoelectric quantities that are used throughout the text .",

    "[ sec : results ] . before concluding in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] , we discuss the experimental feasibility of our proposal in sec .  [",
    "sec : exp ] .",
    "we describe our system with a non - interacting scattering matrix approach , which is suitable to describe the linear response regime of interest even for a mzi , where interaction effects are known to be of relevance in general  @xcite .",
    "the transmission probabilities through a mzi are then of the form @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the probability amplitude for going along path @xmath15 and @xmath16 is the phase picked up along that path .",
    "linearizing the spectrum @xmath17 , the energy - dependent difference of these phases is given by @xmath18 here @xmath19 is the magnetic flux in units of @xmath20 enclosed by the two paths and @xmath21 is the length - difference of the paths divided by the drift velocity .",
    "constant phases arising from the qpc s and the chemical potential are absorbed in @xmath19 .",
    "the transmission probabilities through a mzi thus show oscillations as a function of energy for an imbalanced mzi ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "it is this energy dependence which allows the mzi to be operated as a heat engine .",
    "the effects of a path - length difference on the charge current and noise has been investigated in ref .   for a dc bias and in ref .   for an ac bias .",
    "since we have @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are reflection and transmission probabilities of the quantum - point contact ( qpc ) @xmath15 , we focus on mzis with half - transparent qpcs ( i.e. @xmath26 ) , where the interference effects are most pronounced .",
    "note that a finite temperature , in combination with an energy - dependent transmission probability _ decreases _ the interference effect due to phase averaging .",
    "this determines a finite window for the product of temperature and path length difference where a thermally induced charge current is created exploiting the interference effect .",
    "additional sources of dephasing will be discussed below .",
    "we now introduce the different quantities that characterize the performance of a given setup as a heat engine .",
    "to constitute a heat engine , the system must produce a charge current @xmath27 as a response to a thermal bias @xmath28 between the hot and the cold reservoirs . in order to perform work",
    ", this thermal current has to overcome an externally applied voltage bias @xmath29 . the efficiency with which the heat engine converts thermal energy into electrical energy is given by the ratio between the output power and the input power .",
    "the input power is equal to the heat current @xmath30 which enters the system through the hot contacts and the output power reads @xmath31    throughout the paper , the quantities without a contact index refer to the currents and forces that characterize a given setup as a heat engine .",
    "having identified these quantities , it is convenient to relate them via the reduced onsager matrix  @xcite @xmath32 where the thermodynamic forces are given by @xmath33 the coefficients of the reduced onsager matrix then encode all the information on the heat engine in the linear response regime .",
    "for instance , the seebeck coefficient , which gives the ratio between bias voltage and temperature bias at which the current vanishes reads @xmath34 similarly , the power maximized with respect to the applied bias voltage is given by @xmath35 and the efficiency at maximum power by @xmath36 where @xmath37 denotes the carnot efficiency in linear response .",
    "in the second line of the last expression , we give the relation between @xmath38 and the figure of merit @xmath39 . since these quantities contain the same information , in the following we will describe the proposed heat engines using @xmath38 .",
    "in its most simple implementation , the mzi is usually fabricated as a three - terminal setup ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) consisting of a source and two drains .",
    "figure [ fig : setup1 ] schematically depicts such a three - terminal setup with contact @xmath3 being the source .",
    "we will first discuss this experimentally established setup and show that it can be employed as a heat engine with moderate efficiency in sec .",

    "[ ssec:2terminal ] , we show how the efficiency can be improved by employing different boundary conditions which results in an effective two - terminal setup . finally , in sec .",
    "[ ssec:4terminal ] , we analyze a four - terminal heat engine based on two mach - zehnder interferometers which constitutes our most powerful and efficient setup .      for the three - terminal setup sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup1 ] , the transmission probabilities read ( for half - transparent qpcs ) @xmath40 where @xmath41 is given by eq .",
    "and @xmath42 is the transmission amplitude from contact @xmath43 to contact @xmath11 . in order to operate the system as a heat engine",
    ", we heat up contact @xmath3 and we demand a vanishing charge current in the hot contact @xmath44 .",
    "the current produced by the engine then flows between the cold contacts .",
    "since the only channel entering contact @xmath3 is coming from contact @xmath5 with unit transmission , we find @xmath45 .",

    "since time - reversal symmetry enforces @xmath55  @xcite , this extreme asymmetry of the reduced onsager matrix is a direct consequence of the broken time - reversal symmetry in quantum hall systems . in this case , the maximal efficiency equals the efficiency at maximum power ( because the heat current is independent of the bias voltage ) and is bounded from above by @xmath56 for a three - terminal setup  @xcite .    evaluating eq .",

    ", we find that the maximal power will be of a form similar to eq .",
    "[ see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : doublepower ] ,  [ eq : doublepowernu2 ] ) below ] .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the fact that the sole energy dependence of the mzi enters through the phase - difference @xmath41 .",

    "below we discuss how this can be achieved by either combining contacts @xmath3 and @xmath5 ( obtaining a two - terminal setup , see sec .",
    "[ ssec:2terminal ] ) or by inserting an additional mzi in between contacts @xmath3 and @xmath5 ( obtaining a four terminal setup , see sec .",
    "[ ssec:4terminal ] ) . before embarking on this investigation",
    ", we conclude this section with a brief discussion on the influence of dephasing and higher filling factors .    to introduce dephasing , we couple one of the arms of the interferometer to a fictitious voltage probe  @xcite .",
    "the effect of the voltage probe is then to multiply every interference term in eqs .",
    "( [ eq:3onsev]-[eq:3onsht ] ) with a factor @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the probability to traverse the corresponding mzi arm _ without _ entering the voltage probe . the maximal output power is then modified to @xmath74 thus to a good approximation the power as well as the efficiency decrease linearly with increasing @xmath73 .",
    "note that the power goes to zero for complete loss of phase - information , reflecting the fact that the delivered power is of quantum - mechanical origin only .",
    "since most experiments are not conducted at filling factor @xmath75 but at @xmath76 , it is of experimental importance to investigate the effect of higher filling factors . at a qpc ,",
    "only one of the edge channels can be partitioned at once .",
    "all others will be either fully transmitted or reflected . in order to fabricate a mzi",
    ", it must be the same edge channel which is partitioned at both qpcs .",
    "one can then see from fig .",
    "[ fig : setup1 ] , that a higher filling factor will only add connections with unit transmission between contacts @xmath3 and @xmath5 ( and from contact @xmath4 back to itself ) .",
    "this is true independent of the choice for the partitioned channel .",
    "the charge current between the cold contacts , and with it the delivered power , is thus not affected but the heat current injected from contact @xmath3 is increased by a factor @xmath77 . therefore , the power remains unchanged while the efficiency drops down by a factor @xmath78 .",
    "the three - terminal mzi can also be operated by demanding zero charge _ and _",
    "heat current in contact @xmath3 , @xmath79 , and applying a temperature bias between the remaining terminals .",

    "we thus find that the thermoelectric properties of the mzi depend crucially on the choice of boundary conditions .",

    "[ fig : eff2terminal ] .    efficiency at maximum power for the effective two - terminal setup in units of @xmath0 .",

    "a slightly higher efficiency of @xmath90 can be reached for @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "however , the power delivered by the heat engine vanishes for this configuration .",
    "a further advantage of this setup is its insensitivity to higher filling factors . as can be inferred from fig .",
    "[ fig : setup1 ] , higher filling factors will only lead to edge states which return to the same contact they emerged from and therefore do not contribute to transport .      in this section , we discuss how the efficiency can be increased by using a setup based on two mzis as sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup2 ] . in this setup",
    "every path traverses a mzi leading to an interference contribution to all the charge and heat currents .",

    "this is not surprising since in this setup twice as many terminals are heated .",
    "as it turns out , the condition @xmath105 and @xmath106 also maximizes the delivered power .",

    "<S> we theoretically investigate the thermoelectric properties of heat engines based on mach - zehnder interferometers . </S>",
    "<S> the energy dependence of the transmission amplitudes in such setups arises from a difference in the interferometer arm lengths . </S>",
    "<S> any thermoelectric response is thus of purely quantum mechanical origin . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to an experimentally established three - terminal setup , we also consider a two - terminal geometry as well as a four - terminal setup consisting of two interferometers . </S>",
    "<S> we find that mach - zehnder interferometers can be used as powerful and efficient heat engines which perform well under realistic conditions . </S>"
