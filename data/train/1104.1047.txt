    "in the last decade , attention has been paid to queueing systems in which customers have deadlines .",
    "examples include telecommunication systems carrying digitized voice or video traffic , tracking systems and real - time control systems . in the case of voice or video ,",
    "packetized information must be received , processed and displayed within stringent timing bounds so that the integrity of the transmission is maintained .",
    "similarly , there are processing requirements for tracking systems that guarantee that a track can be successfully followed . real - time control systems ( e.g. , those associated with modern avionics systems , manufacturing plants or automobiles ) also gather data that must be processed within stringent timing requirements in order for the system to maintain stability or react to changes in the operating environment .",
    "we refer to queueing systems that process tasks with deadlines as `` real - time queueing systems . ''",
    "the performance of a real - time queueing system is measured by its ability to meet the deadlines of the customers .",
    "this is in contrast to ordinary queueing systems in which the measure of performance is often customer delay , queue length or utilization of a service facility .",
    "we use the fraction of `` reneged work , '' defined as the residual work not serviced due to elapsed deadlines , as our performance measure . to minimize this quantity , it is necessary to use a scheduling policy that takes deadlines into account .",
    "we use the earliest - deadline - first ( edf ) policy , which reduces to the more familiar first - in - first - out ( fifo ) policy when all customers have the same deadline . under general assumptions",
    ", we prove that edf is optimal with respect to this performance measure . a related result for @xmath0 queues , in which the number of reneging customers is used as a performance measure ,",
    "was obtained by panwar and towsley @xcite .",
    "heavy traffic analysis of a single real - time queue was initiated by lehoczky  @xcite .",
    "this was put on a firm mathematical foundation by doytchinov , lehoczky and shreve ( dls ) @xcite .",
    "the accuracy of heavy traffic approximations was developed in @xcite .",
    "the results of dls were generalized to the case of acyclic networks in @xcite . in these papers",
    "it was assumed that all customers are served to completion .",
    "the case in which late customers leave the system and their residual work is lost is addressed here .",
    "the main result of this paper is a heavy traffic convergence theorem , from which is derived a simple and practically useful approximation for the fraction of lost work when the system is heavily loaded .",
    "the mathematical formulation used by dls and related papers is based on random measures .",
    "in addition to the usual queue length and workload processes associated with the queueing system , to model the evolution of a real - time queueing system , one must keep track of the lead time of each customer , that is , the time until the customer s deadline elapses .",
    "this is done by measure - valued queue length and workload processes .",
    "the measure - valued queue length process puts unit mass on the real line at the lead time of each customer in the system , while the measure - valued workload process puts mass equal to the remaining service time of each  customer at the lead time of that customer .",
    "these measures evolve dynamically as customers arrive , age and depart . under the usual heavy traffic assumptions , since customers are served to completion in the dls framework , it is easy to see that the ordinary scaled workload process converges weakly to a reflected brownian motion with drift .",
    "dls showed that the suitably scaled workload and queue length measure - valued processes converge to an explicit deterministic function of the workload process .",
    "in this paper customers leave the system when their deadlines elapse , which we refer to as reneging . due to the preemptive nature of the edf policy ,",
    "it is not possible to determine at the time of admission whether a customer will be fully serviced before its deadline elapses .",
    "it is thus natural to have the controller make the decision only at the time the deadline elapses .",
    "the system with reneging shows marked improvement in performance over the dls system , in the sense that the fraction of reneged work in this system is much less than the fraction of work that becomes late in the dls system .",
    "this improvement is because once a customer misses its deadline , the processor devotes no further effort to it , but rather turns its attention to customers that are not late .",
    "the system with reneging is considerably more difficult to analyze than the dls system . in the reneging system ,",
    "the evolution of the scalar total workload process depends on the entire lead time distribution of customers in queue and the nature of the edf discipline .",
    "this is in stark contrast to the dls system , where the total workload process is independent of the scheduling discipline , and is identical to that of any @xmath1 queue with a work - conserving scheduling discipline .",
    "a key ingredient of our analysis is a mapping on the space of measure - valued functions which , when applied to the dls system , yields another system ( that we call the reference system ) whose difference from the reneging system vanishes in heavy traffic .",
    "this mapping can be viewed as a generalization of the scalar double reflection map to measure - valued processes , and , using its continuity properties , we identify the heavy traffic limit of the reference and hence the reneging systems . specifically , we show that the limit of the scaled workload process is a doubly reflected brownian motion with lower barrier zero and upper barrier at the mean of the lead time distribution .",
    "we also show that , conditional on the limiting workload , the resulting limiting measure - valued workload process is the same limiting process as when customers are served to completion , that is , in the dls system .",
    "however , the workload processes in these two systems differ , and so the unconditional limiting lead - time profiles of these two systems differ accordingly . in particular , unlike in the dls system , the measure - valued workload process in the reneging system is always concentrated on the positive real line due to the absence of late work in the reneging system .",
    "the results of this paper suggest a simple formula for the fraction of lost work in the edf system with reneging .",
    "in particular , consider a single - server queue with traffic intensity @xmath2 that is near one , where @xmath3 is the mean interarrival time and @xmath4 is the mean service time .",
    "let @xmath5 and @xmath6 be the standard deviations of the interarrival times and service times , respectively , and set @xmath7 , which we assume is nonzero .",
    "let @xmath8 denote the mean lead time for arriving customers",
    ". finally , set @xmath9 . under these circumstances , @xmath10 this formula is derived in section [ subsection7.3 ] and compared with simulations in section  [ subsection7.2 ] . if @xmath11 , in place of ( [ frw ] ) we have @xmath12 analysis of the limit of the standard ( nonreneging ) system suggests that when @xmath13 [ see ( [ lwcs2 ] ) and ( [ ratio ] ) ] , @xmath14 which , together with ( [ frw ] ) , yields the approximation @xmath15 if @xmath16 then all work is late in the limiting standard ( nonreneging ) system , which leads to the approximation @xmath17 when plotted on a log scale , the fraction of lost work in the reneging system and the fraction of late work in the standard system will be linear in @xmath8 , provided that @xmath18 , and these two plots will be separated by @xmath19 . when performance is measured in terms of the work whose service requirement is not met by the time its deadline elapses , then the reneging system is far superior to the nonreneging system .",
    "we refer the reader to the simulations in section [ subsection7.2 ] .",
    "the situation with reneged _ customers _ as opposed to reneged work is more complicated .",
    "dls shows that the number of customers in the limiting standard system at any time is just @xmath20 times the amount of work , the number of late customers is @xmath20 times the amount of late work and hence @xmath21\\\\[-8pt ] & & \\qquad\\approx \\mbox{fraction of late work in the standard system}\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] [ see also ( [ lwcs2 ] ) and its derivation for the case @xmath13 ] . in the limiting reneging system ,",

    "if the arrival process is poisson , the fraction of lost customers in the reneging system can be estimated by a heuristic argument [ see ( [ 7.6 ] ) ] which gives instead @xmath23\\\\[-8pt ] & & \\qquad\\approx \\frac{2}{\\mu^2\\beta^2 + 1}\\times ( \\mbox{fraction of lost work in reneging system}).\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      measure - valued processes have recently gained prominence in queueing theory .",

    "measure - valued processes have also proved useful in the heavy traffic analysis of queues with scheduling disciplines other than edf such as last - in - first - out @xcite , processor sharing , and shortest remaining processing time . as dynamical systems ,",
    "queueing systems present a mathematical challenge due to discontinuities in their evolution at boundaries ( which denote empty queues ) .",

    "recall from ( [ w * ] ) that the scaled workload process when all customers are served to completion converges to @xmath1057 , a reflected brownian motion with drift @xmath141 ( we now assume @xmath1058 in order to have a stationary distribution ) and variance  @xmath1059 .",
    "in particular , @xmath1060 .",
    "the stationary density for @xmath180 is @xmath1061 and so for large @xmath73 , the density of @xmath1062 is approximately @xmath1063 consequently , the long - run fraction of time @xmath121 spends above level @xmath8 is @xmath1064 . the workload level at which the limiting frontier reaches @xmath35 is @xmath190 , and hence it is approximately the case that the @xmath26th system sees lateness if and only if @xmath121 exceeds @xmath1065 . in other words ,",
    "the theory predicts that @xmath1066 we are using here the result for @xmath1 queues that @xmath1067 a result that grows out of the work of kingman @xcite ( see @xcite for a general result that specializes to the case under consideration ) .",
    "it is important to compare the fraction of work that reneges in the reneging system , given by ( [ lostwork ] ) , with the fraction of work that is late in the standard ( nonreneging ) system .",
    "the ratio of these quantities of lost / late work is @xmath1068 the parameter @xmath934 is @xmath1069 , @xmath1070 is @xmath1071 , and @xmath1072 is @xmath1069 .",
    "thus the ratio in ( [ ratio ] ) is @xmath1069 .",
    "[ r7.3 ] if lead times are a nonrandom constant @xmath8 , edf reduces to first - in - first - out , and the fraction of lost customers in an m / g/1 queue with @xmath1073 is @xmath1074 , where @xmath1038 is the steady - state workload in the corresponding nonreneging m / g/1 queue ( see @xcite ) . in the heavy traffic limit of our model , @xmath1075 [ see the derivation of ( [ lwcs2 ] ) ] . recalling that @xmath1076 in ( [ frw ] ) , we observe that this is consistent with ( [ frw ] ) .",
    "we conducted a simulation study to assess the accuracy of these approximations and to compare the performance of the systems with and without reneging .",
    "two systems were considered , an @xmath24 system presented in figure [ fig:4 ] and an m / d/1 system presented in figure [ fig:5 ] . in both cases ,",
    "@xmath1077 and @xmath1078 , and so the traffic intensity is @xmath1079 .",
    "these parameter values result in @xmath1080 for the @xmath24 case and @xmath1081 for the m / d/1 case .",
    "the initial deadline distribution is uniform on @xmath1082 $ ] with the mean deadline @xmath1083 , varying from @xmath1084 ( constant deadlines ) to @xmath1085 .",
    "the data points are the simulation results averaged over one billion customer arrivals per case .",
    "the curves that are superimposed on the data are the theoretical values , @xmath1064 for the case in which customers are served to completion ( the standard system ) , and equations ( [ frw ] ) and ( [ flcr ] ) for the fraction of work lost and the fraction of lost customers for the reneging system . equation ( [ flcr ] ) is derived in remark [ rq ] under the assumption of constant deadlines .",
    "nevertheless , we apply it for the variable deadline case in the simulation study . the fraction of late work or late customers for the system in which customers are served to completion is also presented to compare its performance with that of the reneging system .    the @xmath24 results are presented in figure [ fig:4 ] with the fraction of customers missing their deadlines , the fraction of customers reneging , and the fraction of work reneging plotted on a log scale on the @xmath246-axis against the mean deadline on the @xmath47-axis .",
    "there is nearly perfect agreement between the theoretical approximation and the simulation .",
    "in fact , one can not see the plot of `` fraction of customers late ( no reneging ) '' because it coincides with the `` theory '' plot at the top of the figure .",
    "similarly , one can see only parts of the plots of `` fraction of customers reneging '' and `` fraction of work reneging '' because they coincide with the `` theory '' plot in the middle of the figure .",
    "one can see the linear form for the case of service to completion .",
    "furthermore , the simulation confirms the prediction of ( [ frw])([7.3 ] ) that for sufficiently large values of @xmath8 , the performance of the reneging system is parallel on a log scale to that of the standard system with the two curves separated by approximately @xmath1086 .",
    "this corresponds to a reduction in work that misses its deadline by a factor of @xmath1087 to @xmath1088 .",
    "figure [ fig:5 ] presents the results for the m / d/1 system .",
    "the results are qualitatively identical to those of figure [ fig:4 ] , except the fits of the theoretical curves are not as exact as the fits for the @xmath24 system ; it appears that now the value @xmath1081 is slightly too small and hence the theory slightly overestimates the fraction of work that misses its deadline , especially when the mean deadline is large .",
    "also , the lost or late work and the customer loss or lateness fractions are significantly smaller than for the @xmath24 system owing to the reduction in variability of the customer service time distribution .",
    "the reduction in missed deadlines between the two systems for large values of @xmath8 is again a factor of 40 to 50 . in both figures ,",
    "it is clear that there are one to two orders of magnitude of improvement in the overall performance of the system resulting from stopping service on customers when their deadlines expire .",
