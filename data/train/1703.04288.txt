    "nonequilibrium dynamic transitions driven by cascade dynamics on complex networks have attracted considerable attention recently  @xcite .",
    "the spreading of epidemic disease on complex networks  @xcite is an instance , in which a pathogen is transmitted from an infected node ( e.g. , a person ) to a susceptible neighbor , who then becomes infected with a certain probability .",
    "if the transmission probability is sufficiently large ( small ) , the pathogen spreads out to a macroscopic scale ( remains local ) .",
    "an epidemic transition occurs between these two limits .",
    "the extent of spreading also depends on the structure of an underlying network  @xcite .",
    "when degree distribution of a network is highly heterogeneous , diseases can spread out massively even for a small transmission probability , so that an epidemic transition point can be zero  @xcite .",
    "information spreading in social media from one page to others may be modeled in a similar manner  @xcite .    among the several epidemic models ,",
    "one of the simple contagion models is the so - called susceptible - infected - recovered ( sir ) model  @xcite , in which each node has one of three states , susceptible ( denoted as @xmath3 ) , infected ( @xmath4 ) , or recovered ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "initially , all the nodes are in state @xmath3 except for one seed node in state @xmath4 .",
    "the contagion process starts from a single node in state @xmath4 .",
    "each node in state @xmath4 transmits pathogens to its neighbors in state @xmath3 and infects each of them with probability @xmath6 ; then , it changes its state to @xmath5 with unit probability .",
    "this contact process is repeated until the system reaches an absorbing state in which no infected node is left in the system .",
    "when the probability @xmath6 is sufficiently small ( large ) , the order parameter defined as the density of nodes in state @xmath5 after the system falls into the absorbing state , becomes @xmath7 [ @xmath0 ] ; i.e. , the system falls into a subcritical ( supercritical ) state . in between",
    ", an epidemic transition occurs at @xmath9 , and the system exhibits critical behavior .",
    "it is known that when the dynamics starts from a single seed on erds - rnyi ( er ) random networks  @xcite , the sir model undergoes a continuous percolation transition following the universal behavior of ordinary percolation .",
    "the sir model with multiple seeds has been considered  @xcite , in which two percolation transitions occur successively at @xmath10 and @xmath11 as @xmath6 is increased .",
    "the density of nodes in state @xmath5 is finite for @xmath12 , whereas the density of nodes in state @xmath3 disappears for @xmath13 .",
    "thus , there exists a state of coexisting nodes in states @xmath5 and @xmath3 between @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the sir model was extended to a two - step contagion model , in which a weakened state ( @xmath14 ) can exist between the @xmath3 and @xmath4 states .",
    "accordingly , this model is called the swir model  @xcite . nodes in state @xmath14",
    "are involved in the reactions @xmath15 and @xmath16 , which occurs in addition to the reactions @xmath17 and @xmath18 in the sir model .",
    "the properties of the epidemic transition in the swir model were extensively investigated for the single - seed case  @xcite .",
    "the order parameter defined as the density of nodes in state @xmath5 after an absorbing state is reached , displays a discontinuous transition , whereas other physical quantities such as the outbreak size distribution exhibit critical behaviors .",
    "thus , the phase transition occurring in the swir model with a single seed is regarded as a mixed - order phase transition  @xcite .",
    "the dynamic rule of the swir model is rather so simple that its underlying mechanism for the discontinuous behavior of the order parameter was disclosed  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the mechanism turned out to be universal in other models such as @xmath19-core percolation  @xcite , the cascading failure model on interdependent networks  @xcite , and the epidemic - related models  @xcite .    here",
    ", we investigate the phase transitions of the swir model with multiple seeds .",
    "the model with multiple seeds has been investigated in refs .",
    "@xcite : the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite used the mean - field approach and performed numerical simulations , obtaining the phase diagram as a function of the reaction rates .",
    "the order parameter exhibits either a discontinuous or continuous transition depending on the density of the infectious seeds and mean degree of a given network  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the discontinuous transition is regarded as a spinodal transition , because there is no co - existence phase in the system while the order parameter jumps .",
    "even though such results were obtained , the properties of the phase transitions and critical behaviors were not deeply investigated yet .    here",
    ", we reveal that the spread of contagion in the swir model with multiple seeds proceeds differently from that in the swir model with a single seed : in the multiple - seed case , the reactions @xmath16 often occur even in early time steps , because nodes in states @xmath14 and @xmath4 involved in that reaction can originate from different seeds ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "we note that the number of multiple seeds was taken as @xmath0 . on the contrary , in the single - seed case",
    ", such reactions rarely occur until the system reaches a characteristic dynamic step @xmath20 : when dynamic step @xmath21 is less than @xmath22 , the reactions @xmath17 and @xmath18 are dominant but the number of nodes in @xmath5 still remains as @xmath7 .",
    "the contagion spreads in the form of a branching tree . when the dynamics reaches @xmath22 , the branching tree forms long - range loops due to finite - size effect .",
    "once such loops form , the reaction @xmath16 occurs massively , in which the nodes in state @xmath14 were generated in early time steps .",
    "thus , the density of nodes in state @xmath5 increases drastically as many as @xmath0 in short time steps . due to these different contagion mechanisms ,",
    "the properties of epidemic transitions in the multiple seed case become different from those in the single seed case .",
    "we will determine the full set of critical exponents describing the phase transitions in the multiple seed case , and compare them with those obtained in the single seed case  @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , we present the rules of the swir model in detail . in sec .",
    "iii , we set up the self - consistency equation to derive the mean - field solution using the local tree approximation of the order parameter for the epidemic transition on the er networks .",
    "we show that , depending on the initial density of infectious nodes , different types of phase transition can occur . in sec .",

    "( c ) a node in state @xmath4 contacts a node in state @xmath14 from a different root .",
    "( d ) then , the node in state @xmath4 infects the node in state @xmath14 and changes its state to @xmath4 .",
    "the two clusters merge . ]",
    "the swir model with multiple seeds is simulated on er networks with @xmath1 nodes . initially",
    ", @xmath23 nodes are selected randomly from among those @xmath1 nodes and assigned to state @xmath4 ; the other nodes are assigned to state @xmath3 . at each time",
    "step @xmath21 , the following processes are performed .",
    "( i ) all the nodes in state @xmath4 are listed in random order .",
    "( ii ) the states of the neighbors of each node in the list are updated sequentially as follows : if a neighbor is in state @xmath3 , it changes its state in one of the two ways : either to @xmath4 with probability @xmath6 or to @xmath14 with probability @xmath24 .",
    "if a neighbor is in the state @xmath14 , it changes to @xmath4 with probability @xmath25 , where @xmath6 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 are the contagion probabilities for the respective reactions .",
    "( iii ) all nodes in the list change their states to @xmath5 .",
    "this completes the time step , and we repeat the above processes until the system reaches an absorbing state in which no infectious node is left in the system .",
    "the reactions are summarized as follows : @xmath26    the order parameter exhibits a discontinuous transition at a transition point @xmath9 when @xmath27 is less than a critical value @xmath28 , and it shows a continuous transition at @xmath9 when @xmath29 for given parameter values @xmath30 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 , where @xmath30 is the mean degree of a given er network .",
    "in an absorbing state , each node is in one of three states : the susceptible @xmath3 , weakened @xmath14 , and recovered @xmath5 states .",
    "the order parameter @xmath31 , the density of nodes in state @xmath5 in an absorbing state , is written using the local tree approximation as @xmath32 the first term in eq .",
    "( [ rho_r ] ) , @xmath33 , is the initial density of infected nodes . in the second term",
    ", the factor @xmath34 represents the probability that a node is originally in state @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath35 is the probability that a randomly selected node has degree @xmath19 ; @xmath36 is the probability that an arbitrarily chosen edge leads to a node that is in state @xmath5 but not infected through the chosen edge in the absorbing state .",
    "thus , @xmath37 is the probability that a node has degree @xmath19 and @xmath38 of them are in state @xmath5 in the absorbing state .",
    "@xmath39 is the conditional probability that a node is finally in state @xmath5 , provided that it was originally in state @xmath3 and its @xmath40 neighbors are in state @xmath5 in the absorbing state .",
    "similarly to @xmath41 , we define @xmath42 as the conditional probability that a node remains in state @xmath3 in the absorbing state , provided that it has @xmath40 neighbors in state @xmath5 and was originally in state @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath43 is defined similarly .",
    "we note that for a certain node to have @xmath44 neighbors in state @xmath5 in the absorbing state means that the node receives @xmath38 attempts to infect it when the recovered neighbors are in state @xmath4 .",
    "thus , a node still remaining in state @xmath3 with @xmath40 neighbors in state @xmath5 has to be unchanged from @xmath40 infection attempts through the entire process .",
    "thus , we obtain @xmath45 next , the probability @xmath46 is given as @xmath47 where @xmath48 denotes the number of attacks that a node sustains before it changes to state @xmath14 . using the relation @xmath49 , one can determine @xmath50 in terms of @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the local tree approximation allows us to define @xmath53 similarly to @xmath36 but now at the tree level @xmath21 .",
    "the probability @xmath54 can be derived from @xmath53 as follows :    @xmath55    where the factor @xmath56 is the probability that a node connected to a randomly chosen edge has degree @xmath19 . as a particular case ,",
