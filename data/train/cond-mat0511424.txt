    "the statistical scattering of waves through open chaotic cavities has been of great interest to many groups along the years @xcite .",
    "the investigations that have been carried out are relevant to a variety of problems , like the electronic transport through ballistic quantum dots , or the scattering of classical waves ( e.g. , electromagnetic or elastic waves ) in chaotic billiards .",
    "the approach provided by random - matrix theory has been particularly fruitful in the study of the statistical fluctuations of transmission and reflection of waves by a number of systems , including billiards with a chaotic classical dynamics . within this approach",
    "we wish to focus our attention on the model of refs .",
    "[ ] , which was introduced originally in the context of nuclear physics and was then applied to the domain of chaotic cavities .",
    "we recall that , very generally , we can describe a scattering process in terms of a scattering matrix @xmath0 . in",
    "the model referred to above , the statistical features of the problem are represented by a measure in @xmath0-matrix space which , through the assumption of  ergodicity \" , gives the probability of finding @xmath0 in a given volume element as the energy @xmath1 changes and @xmath0 wanders through that space .",
    "the problem is , of course , to find that measure .",
    "the key assumption is made that in the scattering process two distinct time scales occur , associated , respectively , with a prompt , or direct , response due to the presence of short paths , and a delayed , or equilibrated , response due to very long paths .",
    "it turns out that the prompt , or direct , processes can be expressed in terms of the energy average of @xmath0 , @xmath2 , also known as the _ optical _ @xmath0 matrix .",
    "the statistical distribution of the scattering matrix @xmath0 is then constructed through a maximum - entropy  ansatz \" , assuming that it depends parametrically solely on the optical matrix .",
    "the notion of ergodicity , which allows replacing energy averages by ensemble averages , e.g. , @xmath3 , is essential to the argument .",
    "the statistical properties of the conductance predicted by the maximum - entropy model we just described have been studied in the past ; these predictions have been also compared with the results of computer simulations which consist in solving the scalar schrdinger equation numerically for a number of structures @xcite .",
    "although in those structures the two time scales referred to above were not as well separated as in nuclear physics problems , they seemed to us to be sufficiently distinct to allow a meaningful description .",
    "it is the purpose of the present article to investigate further the validity of the maximum - entropy model , by extending our earlier studies in the following three ways .",
    "first , we wish to provide further predictions of our approach for other physical quantities in addition to the conductance . for this purpose",
    "we analyze the zero - frequency limit of the shot - noise power spectrum @xmath4 at zero temperature .",
    "for one open channel ( @xmath5 ) we show that the problem can be reduced to quadratures and , in a number of cases , we can even study analytically the influence of direct processes on the average , @xmath6 , of the zero - frequency shot - noise power spectrum over an ensemble of cavities .",
    "for an arbitrary number of channels , on the other hand , we show that @xmath6 can be evaluated analytically when direct processes are absent [ @xmath7 .",
    "second , we wish to extend the computer simulations mentioned above in a number of ways :    \\i ) in some of the cavities used in the present paper the short paths consist of whispering gallery modes ( wgm ) , which were excluded in refs . [ ] by the type of cavities that were used and the way the leads were attached .",
    "it is their effect that we wish to describe in terms of the optical @xmath0 matrix which , as we said , is precisely a measure of the short - time processes occurring in the scattering problem .",
    "information on the time scales involved could be provided by an analysis of the structure of @xmath8 in the complex - energy plane .",
    "although we do not have direct access to the poles of the @xmath0 matrix , the complex eigenvalues of the so - called  effective hamiltonian \" ( which essentially consists of the hamiltonian of the closed cavity plus the coupling to the continuum ) give evidence of a  sea \" of fine - structure , long - lived , resonances , plus a collection of shorter lived , more widely separated states .",
    "this evidence is indicated in the present paper and studied in detail in refs .",
    "\\ii ) earlier numerical simulations were performed for cavities with an applied magnetic field ( the unitary universality class characterized by the dyson parameter @xmath9 ) , in the presence of direct processes and for one channel ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the present simulations are performed for cavities with time - reversal invariance ( the orthogonal universality class , characterized by the dyson parameter @xmath10 ) , also in the presence of direct processes and for one ( @xmath5 ) and two ( @xmath11 ) open channels .",
    "third , we shall pay closer attention to the discrepancies between theory and numerical experiments .",
    "indeed , discrepancies similar to the ones that we shall observe in this paper were already present , to a certain extent , in ref .",
    "[ ] , but were overlooked at that time .    the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",

    "this model was introduced in the past in the domain of nuclear physics and was later used to study the quantum mechanical scattering occurring inside ballistic cavities ( whose classical dynamics is chaotic ) connected to the outside by means of waveguides @xcite .",

    "in the present paper we have gone further by studying , in addition to the conductance , the zero - frequency shot - noise power spectrum .",
    "the shot noise is a more complicated quantity than the conductance , in the sense that it involves electron correlations due to the pauli principle .",
    "we have been particularly interested in the effect that direct processes consisting of whispering gallery modes have on the conductance and on the shot - noise power ; these modes were promoted by choosing properly the structure of the cavities and the position of the leads .",
    "this kind of direct processes were , in fact , avoided in previous publications by some of the present authors .",
    "for the two symmetries ( @xmath147 ) studied here we have found that the ratio @xmath148 , as a function of the number of channels for @xmath54 , is larger for @xmath20 than for @xmath21 , indicating that small values of the transmission eigenvalues are favored by time - reversal symmetry .",
    "we have found that the agreement between the theoretical predictions and the results of computer simulations performed for one and two open channels is generally good . however , the systematic discrepancies that we have observed lead us to revise the notions under which our model has been constructed .",
    "indeed , the maximum - entropy model described in sec . [ pk ] relies on a number of assumptions .",
    "for instance , the extreme idealization is made of regarding @xmath8 as a  stationary random ( matrix ) function \" of energy . as a consequence ,",
    "the optical matrix @xmath149 is constant with energy and the characteristic time associated with direct processes is literally zero .",
    "the property of _ stationarity _ allows defining the notion of _ ergodicity _ which , together with _",
    "analitycity _ , gives the _ reproducing property _",
    ", eq . ( [ reprod ] ) , which is essential for the definition of poisson s kernel ( pk ) of eq .",
    "( [ poisson ] ) .",
    "needless to say , in realistic dynamical problems stationarity is only approximately fulfilled , so that one has to work with energy intervals @xmath144 across which the  local \" optical matrix @xmath149 is _ approximately constant _ , while , at the same time , such intervals should contain many fine - structure resonances .",
    "this compromise can actually be realized in nuclear physics , where the optical @xmath30 arises from the tail of many distant resonances or from a single - particle resonance that lies so far away in the complex-@xmath1 plane to act as a smooth background on top of the fine - structure compound - nucleus resonances : hence the huge separation between the two time scales .",
    "in contrast , as we saw in sec . [ num ] , such a compromise is difficult to fulfill for the physical systems studied here : this we believe to be the origin of the discrepancies observed between theory and numerical simulations .",
    "( indeed , discrepancies similar to the ones that we have observed in this paper were already there , to a certain extent , in refs .",
    "[ ] , but were overlooked at that time . ) in the present paper we give evidence that reducing @xmath144 literally to a point and collecting data over an ensemble constructed by changing the position of the obstacle inside the cavity , the agreement between theory and experiment is significantly improved , being excellent in several cases . in other words ,",
    "_ pk gives a good description of the statistics of the data taken across the ensemble_.    it is interesting to remark that also in ref .",
    "[ ] cases had been found in which stationarity obviously did not hold .",
    "energy averages were out of the question in those cases , so that an ensemble was generated by adding  noise \" along the wall : it was found that pk gave an excellent description of the data collected across the ensemble at a fixed @xmath1 .",
    "this point was merely indicated at that time and no results were published .    thus the results shown in the present paper give evidence that pk is valid beyond the situation where it was originally derived , which required the properties of analyticity , stationarity and ergodicity , plus a maximum - entropy ansatz .",
    "it is as though the reproducing property of eq .",
    "( [ reprod ] ) were valid even in the absence of stationarity and ergodicity ( analyticity is always there , of course ) . even at the present moment we are unable to give an explanation of this fact .",
    "a few remarks are in order in connection with this point .",
    "let us take the invariant measure @xmath150 of sec .",
    "[ pk ] as a model for the description of scattering by a chaotic cavity described by the scattering matrix @xmath151 and assumed to have ideal coupling to the leads .",
    "brouwer has shown ( see ref .",
    "[ ] , sec .",
    "v ) that when such a chaotic cavity is coupled to the leads by means of a tunnel barrier ( non - ideal coupling ) described by a fixed scattering matrix @xmath152 , say , the resulting @xmath0 , constructed using the combination law of @xmath151 and @xmath152 , is distributed according to pk .",
    "brouwer s proof , being essentially a change of variables from @xmath151 to the final @xmath0 , does not require stationarity , or ergodicity , or the maximum - entropy ansatz ; however , it neglects evanescent modes between the barrier and the cavity .",
    "in other words , the reproducing property , which is fulfilled identically for the invariant measure @xcite , is not destroyed by the presence of the tunnel barriers .",
    "the latter certainly give rise to a nonzero @xmath30 , so that the direct processes described by this @xmath30 , being produced by the tunnel barriers , take place outside the cavity ( see fig . 2 in ref . ) .",
    "in contrast , when direct processes take place inside the system , it is not possible , in general , to write the total @xmath0 as the combination of an @xmath151 and a _ fixed _",
    "@xmath152 , as required by brouwer s analysis .",
    "take , for instance , the system shown in fig .",
    "[ w(t)22 - 23](d ) .",
    "if we had , say , a long  neck \" between the small cavity and the big one , then we could define scattering matrices @xmath152 for the former and @xmath151 for the latter and combine them , disregarding evanescent modes , to obtain the total scattering matrix @xmath0 .",
    "however , this is not the case for the actual system under study . as an approximation",
    ", we might think of assigning to the small and big cavities of the system of fig .",
    "[ w(t)22 - 23](d ) the scattering matrices @xmath152 and @xmath151 , respectively , that would occur if we added the neck between the two ; the total @xmath0 obtained by combining these open - channel @xmath152 and @xmath151 would represent an approximation to the actual problem ; however , we are not in a position to know how close this approximation would be to the exact solution : we leave this open question for future investigation .",
    "once again we seem to find that the valididty of pk for the systems studied in the previous section goes beyond the domain in which brouwer s result was derived .",
    "brouwer has also shown @xcite that pk for the @xmath0 matrix can be obtained from a lorentzian ensemble of hamiltonians with an arbitrary number of levels @xmath153 . in the limit @xmath154",
    "the lorentzian ensemble becomes equivalent to a gaussian ensemble . in this limit ,",
    "in which we believe that the gaussian ensemble describes a chaotic cavity , the problem becomes once again stationary in energy .",
    "it thus seems that a derivation of pk or at least of the reproducing property for chaotic cavities with a general type of direct processes and in the absence of stationarity is , to our knowledge , still missing .",
    "when this work was completed , the present authors became aware of a study of the shot noise problem by d. savin et al .",
