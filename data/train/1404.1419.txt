    "casimir interactions between objects of nontrivial geometries have been under active studies in the past ten years .",
    "this is partly motivated by the advent of nanotechnology which explores physics and technology in a length scale that renders casimir interaction highly non - negligible .",
    "another motivation comes from casimir experiments where casimir force is usually measured for the sphere - plate configuration due to the absence of alignment problem @xcite .    in the past few years",
    ", multiple scattering formalism has been used to cook up a recipe for computing the exact functional representation for the casimir interaction energy between any two objects @xcite in @xmath2-dimensional spacetime . in principle",
    ", one has to compute the scattering matrices of the objects in specific coordinate systems and the translation matrices between different coordinate frames . for objects with additional symmetries such as planes , cylinders and spheres ,",
    "there are special coordinate systems available and the problem is tractable . given the explicit formula for the casimir interaction energy , one can then explore its properties numerically or analytically . of particular interest",
    "is the small separation and large separation limits .",
    "the computation of large separation limit is usually straightforward . in the small separation regime which is of more concern to nanotechnology",
    ", it has been long believed that the leading casimir interaction agrees with the proximity force approximation , and this has been verified for various geometric configurations @xcite . however , to better reflect the actual strength of the casimir force and for comparison to casimir measurements , there is a need to go beyond proximity force approximation .",
    "the computation of the next - to - leading order term in the small separation asymptotic expansion is not an easy task @xcite .",
    "a scheme based on derivative expansion has been proposed @xcite but yet to be verified .",
    "most of the above mentioned works only dealt with the zero temperature interaction . nonetheless , the finite temperature effect can not be neglected .",
    "of particular appeal is the limit of the casimir interaction in the high temperature regime .",
    "it has been long known that the high temperature leading term is linear in the temperature , given by the term with zero matsubara frequency .",
    "this term is known as the classical term since it does not depend on the planck constant @xmath1 . in the small separation regime , except for the leading term which agrees with proximity force approximation , the asymptotic expansion of this classical term is not much known .",
    "however , it was shown in @xcite that the classical casimir interaction between a sphere and a plate with dirichlet boundary conditions can be computed exactly which can be used to derive the full small separation asymptotic expansion .    studying physics in higher dimensional",
    "spacetime has become a norm rather than an exception .",
    "finite temperature casimir effect inside a rectangular cavity in @xmath0-dimensional minkowski spacetime has been explored in @xcite more than 30 years ago . as a first step to understand the casimir effect between two nontrivial objects in higher dimensional spacetime",
    ", we studied the zero temperature casimir effect between a sphere and a plate in @xmath0-dimensional minkowski spacetime in @xcite . in this work , we extend the work to finite temperature regime and consider the high temperature limit . as in the three dimensional case considered in @xcite , we expect that the classical term can be computed exactly .",
    "unlike @xcite , we do not make use of bi - spherical coordinates but use similarity transformation of matrices directly to obtain the result .",
    "an important tool in our computation is the generalized abel - plana summation formula @xcite . from the exact formula for the classical casimir interaction , we derive the small separation asymptotic expansion . in the case",
    "@xmath3 , we recover the result obtained in @xcite .",
    "in @xcite , we showed that when @xmath4 , the zero temperature casimir interaction energy between a dirichlet sphere of radius @xmath5 and a dirichlet plate can be written as @xmath6 where the elements @xmath7 of @xmath8 is @xmath9 here @xmath10 is the distance from the center of the sphere to the plate . for fixed @xmath11 ,",
    "the trace tr@xmath12 is @xmath13    when @xmath3 , we can also represent the casimir interaction energy by provided that the summation @xmath14 is replaced by the summation @xmath15 , where the prime @xmath16 indicates that the term @xmath17 is summed with weight @xmath18 .    using matsubara formalism , the finite temperature casimir",
    "free interaction energy between a dirichlet sphere and a dirichlet plate can be obtained by replacing the integration over @xmath19 by summation over @xmath20 for @xmath21 from @xmath22 to @xmath23 .",
    "namely , @xmath24    when @xmath25 is large , @xmath26 decays exponentially .",
    "hence , in the high temperature regime , the contribution to the casimir free interaction energy from those terms with @xmath27 in is exponentially small .",
    "the high temperature limit of the free energy is given by the @xmath28 term in , which is called the classical term since it is independent of the planck constant @xmath1 .",
    "namely , @xmath29here we do not put directly @xmath30 since @xmath26 might not be well - defined when @xmath30",
    ". nevertheless , the limit @xmath31 should be well - defined and this is what we are going to compute .",
    "as @xmath32 , @xmath33hence , we find that as @xmath34 , @xmath35 by making a change of variables @xmath36 , we have @xmath37to obtain the leading behavior of this integral when @xmath34 , we need to find the leading term of the gegenbauer polynomials @xmath38 when @xmath39 is large . from the rodrigues formula for the gegenbauer polynomial @xcite",
    ": @xmath40we find that the leading term of the polynomial @xmath38 is @xmath41 hence , as @xmath34 , the leading term of the integral is given by @xmath42 in the last row , we have used the identity @xmath43 from and , one can deduce that as @xmath34 , @xmath44 since the trace of a matrix is not changed if the matrix is replaced by a similar matrix , we define @xmath45 where @xmath46 is a diagonal matrix with elements @xmath47 then @xmath48 and it follows that @xmath49 hence , the classical casimir interaction energy is @xmath50 where @xmath51 since @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the distance from the sphere to the plate , the determinant @xmath54 is finite . in the next section , we will derive an alternative expression for this determinant .",
    "in this section , we use similarity transforms of matrices to find an alternative expression for the classical casimir interaction energy .",
    "essentially , we transform the matrices @xmath55 to upper triangular matrices and use the fact that the determinant of an upper triangular matrix is equal to the product of its diagonal elements .",
    "let @xmath56 let @xmath57 be a lower triangular matrix with elements @xmath58where @xmath59 is such that @xmath60 one can check that the inverse @xmath61 has elements @xmath62 using the fact that @xmath63 we find that @xmath64 notice that @xmath65 is an upper triangular matrix , and the diagonal elements are @xmath66 hence , @xmath67    in fact , using a suitable matrix @xmath68 , one can transform @xmath65 into a diagonal matrix .",
    "we leave it to the reader to check that if @xmath68 is the upper triangular matrix with elements @xmath69 where @xmath70then @xmath71    returning back to the classical casimir interaction energy , we obtain from and that @xmath72 notice that when @xmath3 , gives @xmath73 which is exactly the result derived in @xcite using bi - spherical coordinates .    from the definitions and",
    ", we find that @xmath74 when @xmath75 , @xmath76which shows that the large separation leading term of the classical casimir interaction energy comes from the @xmath77 term in and is given by @xmath78",
    "in this section , we use generalized abel - plana summation formula to compute the classical casimir interaction energy .",
    "we need to consider the case when @xmath79 is even and the case when @xmath79 is odd separately .",
    "let@xmath80where @xmath81    first , we want to rewrite . when @xmath79 is even , let @xmath82then @xmath83 notice that the summand is zero when @xmath84 .",
    "this allows us to start the summation from @xmath85 instead of @xmath86 .",
    "moreover , @xmath87 is a polynomial of degree @xmath88 in @xmath89 which can be written as @xmath90with @xmath91 when @xmath92 is odd .",
    "hence , @xmath93    when @xmath79 is odd , let @xmath94we find in the same way that @xmath95where now @xmath96with @xmath91 when @xmath92 is even .    as a function of the complex variable @xmath39 , @xmath97 does not have good analytic properties .",
    "so instead of considering the classical casimir energy , we consider the classical casimir force .",
    "since @xmath98 we find that when @xmath79 is even , @xmath99 and when @xmath79 is odd , @xmath100 notice that @xmath101 only if @xmath79 and @xmath92 have the same parity .",
    "now we have to deal with functions of the form @xmath102 which is not analytic but is meromorphic .",
    "we can not apply abel - plana summation formula , but instead we can apply the generalized abel - plana summation formula @xcite , which says that if @xmath103 is a meromorphic function that only has poles on the imaginary axis , @xmath104",
    "@xmath105    when @xmath79 is even , we apply with @xmath106 where @xmath107 is even .",
    "@xmath103 has poles at @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 hence , @xmath111this sum goes to zero exponentially fast when @xmath112 . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath113 @xmath114here @xmath115 is the riemann zeta function . since @xmath116 , the generalized abel - plana summation formula implies that @xmath117from this , we obtain the exact expression for the classical casimir interaction force : @xmath118    when @xmath79 is odd , we apply the generalized abel - plana summation formula with @xmath119 where @xmath107 is odd .",
    "then @xmath103 has poles at @xmath120 with @xmath121 consequently , @xmath122 on the other hand , @xmath123 @xmath124 which gives @xmath125 from these , we obtain the exact formula for the classical casimir interaction force : @xmath126    from the definition of @xmath127 , we find that as @xmath128 , @xmath129 hence , eqs . and are ideal for studying the small separation asymptotic behavior of the casimir interaction force .",
    "in particular , we find that when @xmath130 , @xmath131if @xmath79 is even ; and @xmath132 if @xmath79 is odd . in the latter ,",
    "we have used the fact that @xmath133 as @xmath130 .",
    "the proximity force approximation approximates the casimir interaction force between two objects by summing the local casimir force density between two planes over the surfaces . in @xmath0-dimensional",
    "minkowski spacetime , the classical casimir force density between two parallel plates both subject to dirichlet boundary conditions is given by @xcite : @xmath134where @xmath53 is the distance between the two plates .    as in @xcite , we find that the proximity force approximation to the classical casimir interaction force between a dirichlet sphere and a dirichlet plate in @xmath0-dimensional spacetime is @xmath135    from and , we find that when @xmath128 , the leading term of the classical casimir interaction force comes from the term with @xmath136 . since @xmath137 , we have @xmath138which agrees with the proximity force approximation .",
    "in this section , we derive the small separation asymptotic expansion of the classical casimir interaction force from and in terms of @xmath139 .",
    "as @xmath128 , @xmath140 @xmath141 which gives @xmath142 for the constants @xmath143 , it is straightforward to show that @xmath144 on the other hand , @xmath145 hence , @xmath146 when @xmath3 , , , and give @xmath147    = 0.5    when @xmath148 , , and give @xmath149    = 0.5    when @xmath150 , , , and give @xmath151    = 0.5    when @xmath152 , we do not need to take into account the term in nor the second term and third term in .",

    "both quantities are normalized by the proximity force approximation .",
    "it is observed that when @xmath155 , there is a considerable amount of correction to the proximity force approximation , but the three - term asymptotic expansion still give quite good approximation to the exact classical casimir term .",
    "however , the three - term approximation will breakdown when @xmath156 is larger .    in fig .",
    "[ f5 ] , we plot the dependence of the three term asymptotic expansion , normalized by the proximity force approximation , on the normalized distance @xmath156 and dimension @xmath79 . it is observed that the correction to the proximity force approximation becomes larger when @xmath79 is larger .",
    "in fact , from , we find that when @xmath79 is large , @xmath157this shows that the proximity force approximation becomes less accurate in spacetime with higher dimensions .",
    "in this work , we have computed the high temperature limit for the casimir free interaction energy between a dirichlet sphere and a dirichlet plate in @xmath0-dimensional minkowski spacetime .",

    "we derive two alternative exact expressions for this classical term .",
    "first we express the logarithms of the determinants as sums of the logarithms of the eigenvalues .",
